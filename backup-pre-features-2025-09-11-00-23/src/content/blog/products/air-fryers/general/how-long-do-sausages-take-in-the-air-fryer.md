title: "How Long do Sausages Take in the Air Fryer"
description: "Getting sausages spot-on in the air fryer is simpler than you think — and quicker than the oven. Whether you're cooking classic British sausages, chipolatas, or meat-free alternatives, most varieties are ready in just 10 to 15 minutes at 180°C. The trick is spacing: give them room to breathe so the heat can circulate evenly, turning once halfway through for a crisp, golden finish all over."

<h2 id=""><strong id="">How Long Do Sausages Take in the Air Fryer?</strong></h2><p id="">Getting <a target="_new" href="https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes" id="">sausages</a> spot-on in the <a target="_new" href="https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk" id="">air fryer</a> is simpler than you think — and quicker than the oven. Whether you're cooking <a target="_new" href="https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/lamb" id="">classic British sausages</a>, <a target="_new" href="https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes/air-fryer-chicken-mini-fillets" id="">chipolatas</a>, or <a target="_new" id="">meat-free alternatives</a>, most varieties are ready in just 10 to 15 minutes at 180°C. The trick is spacing: give them room to breathe so the heat can circulate evenly, turning once halfway through for a crisp, golden finish all over.</p><p id="">Cooking time depends on thickness and type. Slim <a target="_new" href="https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes/air-fryer-thin-steak" id="">chipolatas</a> take around 10 minutes, while chunkier links like <a target="_new" href="https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/beef" id="">beef sausages</a> or <a target="_new" href="https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes/air-fryer-ribeye-steak" id="">seasoned grillers</a> may need up to 14–15 minutes. Always check they're fully cooked inside — the juices should run clear, and the centre should be piping hot. If you're new to air frying, our <a target="_new" href="https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart" id="">Air Fryer Conversion Chart</a> helps translate any recipe to air fryer perfection, with no guesswork.</p><h2 id="">How to Cook Sausages in an Air Fryer (No Fuss, All Flavour)</h2><p id="">Start by <a target="_new" href="https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-knowledge-library" id="">preheating</a> your air fryer to 180°C — this only takes a few minutes and helps the <a target="_new" href="https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes/air-fryer-sausage-veg-tray-bake" id="">sausages</a> cook evenly. Lightly oil the basket if needed, then lay your sausages out in a single layer. There’s no need for turning them every few seconds — just flip once halfway through the cooking time for best results. You’ll get that lovely crisp exterior without drying them out.</p><p id="">If you're using <a target="_new" href="https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/frozen-foods" id="">frozen sausages</a>, there's no need to thaw. Just add a couple of minutes to the cook time and shake the basket halfway to prevent sticking. For even more inspiration, check out our <a target="_new" href="https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes" id="">full recipe archive</a>, including ideas like <a target="_new" href="https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes/air-fryer-chicken-wings" id="">Air Fryer Chicken Wings</a>, <a target="_new" href="https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes/air-fryer-sweet-potato-cubes" id="">Sweet Potato Cubes</a>, or <a target="_new" href="https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes/air-fryer-chicken-vegetable-tray-bake" id="">Vegetable Tray Bakes</a> — all delicious alongside your sizzling sausages.</p><h3 id="">Expert Tips for Crispy, Juicy Sausages Every Time</h3><p id="">Don’t overcrowd the basket — <a target="_new" href="https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes/air-fryer-burgers-uk" id="">sausages</a> need airflow to crisp properly. If cooking more than a few, batch it. Give them a quick <a target="_new" href="https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes/air-fryer-steak-bites-potatoes" id="">turn halfway through</a> to get colour on both sides, and consider a <a target="_new" href="https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner" id="">light spray of oil</a> if your sausages are lean. Want a full meal in one go? Toss in some <a target="_new" href="https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes/air-fryer-baby-potatoes" id="">baby potatoes</a> or <a target="_new" href="https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes/air-fryer-frozen-vegetables" id="">frozen vegetables</a> at the same time.</p><p id="">Use a <a target="_new" href="https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-knowledge-library" id="">meat thermometer</a> to ensure the inside hits 75°C — that’s the sweet spot for safe and juicy results. Rest the sausages for a minute or two after cooking to let the juices settle. Want more ideas for what to serve with them? Our <a target="_new" href="https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/categories/comfort-food" id="">Comfort Food</a> and <a target="_new" href="https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/potatoes" id="">Potatoes</a> sections have plenty of tasty pairings.</p><h2 id="">Can You Cook Frozen Sausages in the Air Fryer?</h2><p id="">Yes — and they turn out beautifully. Pop them in straight from the freezer, add 2–3 extra minutes to the standard time, and flip halfway. There’s no need to pre-boil or defrost, and no greasy splatter to clean up. This method works for all types, whether they’re seasoned grillers, plain links, or <a target="_new" href="https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes/crispy-air-fried-tofu" id="">spiced meat alternatives</a>.</p><p id="">Just make sure they don’t stick together in a frozen lump — separate them if needed. Check doneness by slicing one open or using a <a target="_new" href="https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-knowledge-library" id="">thermometer</a>. If the centre’s still pink, give them another 2 minutes. You’ll be surprised how crispy and well-cooked they are, without drying out.

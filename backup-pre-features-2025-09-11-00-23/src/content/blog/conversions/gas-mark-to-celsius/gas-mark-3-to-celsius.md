<p>Gas Mark 3 converts to 160°C in Celsius, making it a moderate oven temperature perfect for slow cooking and baking. This temperature is commonly used for roasting meats, baking cakes, and preparing casseroles. When using an air fryer, you'll often need to adjust cooking times as they heat up faster than conventional ovens.</p>

<h2>Understanding Gas Mark 3 Temperature</h2>
<p>Gas Mark 3 represents a gentle heat setting on traditional gas ovens, equivalent to 160°C or 320°F. This temperature is ideal for dishes that benefit from slow, even cooking without browning too quickly. Many classic British recipes, from Victoria sponge cakes to slow-roasted pork, specify Gas Mark 3 for perfect results. When converting Gas Mark 3 to Celsius for air fryer cooking, remember that the circulating hot air cooks food faster. You can find more conversion tips at <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>our air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>

<p>The Gas Mark system originated in the UK and remains popular in British cookbooks and recipes. While modern ovens often display temperatures digitally, many home cooks still refer to Gas Marks for traditional dishes. Gas Mark 3 to Celsius conversion is particularly important for baking, where precise temperatures affect texture and rise. For air fryer users, setting your appliance to 160°C when a recipe calls for Gas Mark 3 is a good starting point, though you may need to reduce cooking time by 20%.</p>

<h3>Why 160°C Matters in Cooking</h3>
<p>160°C (Gas Mark 3) sits in the sweet spot between gentle warming and active browning. This temperature allows flavours to develop gradually while preventing excessive moisture loss. When cooking chicken or other poultry in your air fryer at Gas Mark 3 equivalent (160°C), you'll achieve tender, juicy results without drying out the meat. Many <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipes</a> benefit from this moderate heat setting.</p>

<h2>Converting Gas Mark 3 for Air Fryers</h2>
<p>Modern air fryers typically use Celsius or Fahrenheit rather than Gas Marks, making conversion essential. When your recipe specifies Gas Mark 3, set your air fryer to 160°C for comparable results. However, remember that air fryers cook faster due to their powerful fans circulating hot air. A dish that takes 60 minutes at Gas Mark 3 in a conventional oven might only need 45 minutes at 160°C in an air fryer.</p>

<p>The compact size of air fryers also affects cooking at Gas Mark 3 temperatures. With less space for heat to circulate, food may cook more evenly than in a large oven. For best results when converting Gas Mark 3 to Celsius for air fryer use, check your food 5-10 minutes before the recipe's suggested time. Our collection of <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> includes adjusted timings for popular dishes originally designed for Gas Mark ovens.</p>

<h3>Common Uses for Gas Mark 3 (160°C)</h3>
<p>Gas Mark 3 to Celsius conversion is particularly useful for baking delicate items like cheesecakes, custards, and meringues. The gentle heat prevents curdling and ensures even setting without excessive browning. When making roasted vegetables in your air fryer at 160°C (Gas Mark 3 equivalent), you'll achieve tender interiors with slightly crisp edges. This temperature also works well for <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/potatoes>potato dishes</a> where you want thorough cooking without excessive crisping.</p>

<h2>Gas Mark 3 vs Other Cooking Temperatures</h2>
<p>Gas Mark 3 (160°C) sits between Gas Mark 2 (150°C) and Gas Mark 4 (180°C) in the temperature scale. It's considered a "moderate" oven setting, cooler than the standard baking temperature of Gas Mark 4. When converting Gas Mark 3 to Celsius for air fryer use, you might notice that some recipes suggest slightly higher temperatures to compensate for the air fryer's moisture-reducing effect.</p>

<p>Compared to higher temperature cooking, Gas Mark 3 equivalent (160°C) in an air fryer produces less browning and crisping. This makes it ideal for dishes where you want to maintain moisture, like bread puddings or quiches.

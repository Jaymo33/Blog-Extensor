faqQ1: "Can I use minced garlic instead of crushed garlic for 0.33 cup measurements?"
faqA1: "Yes, you can substitute minced garlic, but note that minced garlic is less potent than crushed. Use the same volume (0.33 cup), but expect a slightly milder flavour. For precise air fryer recipes, sticking to crushed garlic is best."
faqQ2: "How do I convert 0.33 cup of crushed garlic to grams?"
faqA2: "0.33 cup of crushed garlic weighs roughly 75 grams. If your recipe uses metric measurements, this conversion ensures accuracy. Always use a kitchen scale for the most reliable results in air fryer cooking."
faqQ3: "Why does 0.33 cup of crushed garlic vary in weight sometimes?"
faqA3: "The weight can vary due to how tightly the garlic is packed or its moisture content. For consistency, lightly pack the garlic and level it off. A scale eliminates this guesswork, especially for air fryer recipes."
faqQ4: "Can I freeze 0.33 cup portions of crushed garlic?"
faqA4: "Absolutely! Freeze crushed garlic in 0.33 cup portions in ice cube trays or small containers. Thaw as needed for air fryer recipes—it’ll save time and reduce waste. Just note that frozen garlic may be slightly less pungent."

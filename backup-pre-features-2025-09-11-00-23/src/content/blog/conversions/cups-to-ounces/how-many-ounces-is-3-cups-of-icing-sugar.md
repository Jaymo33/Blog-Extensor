faqQ1: "How do I convert 3 cups of icing sugar to grams?"
faqA1: "3 cups of icing sugar equals roughly 340 grams. This conversion is useful for recipes requiring metric measurements. For precise results, use a kitchen scale to weigh the sugar directly."
faqQ2: "Can I use granulated sugar instead of icing sugar in air fryer recipes?"
faqA2: "Granulated sugar won’t provide the same texture as icing sugar, which dissolves easily and creates smooth frostings. If substituting, blend granulated sugar into a powder first for similar results."
faqQ3: "Why does my air fryer dessert taste too sweet with 3 cups of icing sugar?"
faqA3: "Over-measuring can lead to excessive sweetness. Ensure you’re using the correct 12-ounce weight for 3 cups. If the recipe still tastes too sweet, reduce the sugar slightly and adjust to preference."
faqQ4: "How should I store leftover icing sugar after measuring 3 cups?"
faqA4: "Keep unused icing sugar in an airtight container to prevent clumping. Store it in a cool, dry place away from moisture. Proper storage ensures it stays fresh for future air fryer baking projects."

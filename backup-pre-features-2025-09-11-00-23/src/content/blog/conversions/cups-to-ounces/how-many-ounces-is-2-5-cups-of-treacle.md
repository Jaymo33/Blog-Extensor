faqQ1: "Can I use golden syrup instead of treacle in my air fryer recipe?"
faqA1: "Yes, you can substitute golden syrup for treacle, but the flavour will be milder. Use the same 2.5 cups (20 oz) measurement, as their densities are similar. Golden syrup works well in cakes and glazes but lacks treacle’s deep molasses notes."
faqQ2: "How do I clean treacle from my air fryer basket?"
faqA2: "Soak the basket in warm, soapy water to loosen sticky treacle residue. For stubborn spots, use a soft brush or sponge. Avoid abrasive cleaners that could damage the non-stick coating. Prevent mess by lining the basket with parchment when using 2.5 cups of treacle."
faqQ3: "Does treacle weigh the same as honey in ounces?"
faqA3: "No, honey is slightly denser than treacle. While 2.5 cups of treacle equals 20 oz, the same volume of honey would weigh about 24 oz. Adjust measurements accordingly if substituting to avoid overly sweet or thick results."
faqQ4: "Why is my treacle-based air fryer recipe burning?"
faqA4: "Treacle caramelises quickly at high heat. If using 2.5 cups (20 oz), reduce the air fryer temperature by 10–15°C and check frequently. Covering dishes with foil for part of the cooking time can also prevent burning while ensuring even cooking."

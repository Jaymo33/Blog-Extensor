faqQ1: "Can I use double cream instead of single cream in this measurement?"
faqA1: "Yes, but double cream is thicker and richer, so the texture of your dish may change. If substituting, use the same 0.125 cup (1 oz) measurement, but expect a heavier result. Adjust other liquids if needed."
faqQ2: "How do I measure 0.125 cup of single cream without a measuring cup?"
faqA2: "You can use tablespoons—0.125 cup equals 2 tablespoons. Alternatively, a kitchen scale set to ounces (1 oz) will give you the exact amount. Precision is key for air fryer recipes."
faqQ3: "Does the UK fluid ounce differ from the US fluid ounce for this conversion?"
faqA3: "No, in this case, 0.125 cup of single cream is 1 fluid ounce in both UK and US measurements. However, always check your recipe’s origin to avoid confusion with other ingredients."
faqQ4: "Can I freeze single cream if I only need 0.125 cup for a recipe?"
faqA4: "Freezing single cream isn’t recommended, as it can separate and become grainy when thawed. Instead, store leftover cream in the fridge and use it within a few days for best results."

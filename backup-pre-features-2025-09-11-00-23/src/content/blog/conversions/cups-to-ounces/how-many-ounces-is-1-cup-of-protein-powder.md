faqQ1: "Does the type of protein powder affect the ounce measurement per cup?"
faqA1: "Yes, the type of protein powder can affect the weight. Whey protein is lighter and fluffier, so 1 cup may weigh closer to 3.5 ounces. Plant-based or casein powders are denser and can weigh up to 4.5 ounces per cup. Always check the packaging for specific weight guidelines."
faqQ2: "Can I use a liquid measuring cup for protein powder?"
faqA2: "No, liquid and dry measuring cups aren’t interchangeable. Dry measuring cups are designed to be leveled off for accuracy, while liquid cups account for meniscus. Using the wrong type can lead to incorrect ounce measurements for your protein powder."
faqQ3: "Why does my protein powder measurement seem off sometimes?"
faqA3: "Clumping, humidity, or how you scoop the powder can cause variations. For the most accurate ounce measurement, fluff the powder with a fork before scooping and level it off. A kitchen scale eliminates these inconsistencies entirely."
faqQ4: "How do I convert grams to ounces for protein powder?"
faqA4: "To convert grams to ounces, divide the grams by 28.35. For example, 100 grams of protein powder is roughly 3.5 ounces. Most kitchen scales toggle between units, making conversions easy for air fryer recipes."

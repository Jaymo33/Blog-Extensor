faqQ1: "Does the brand of ketchup affect the weight per cup?"
faqA1: "Yes, different brands can vary slightly in thickness and density. Most major brands will be close to the standard 8.5 ounces per cup, but artisanal or reduced-sugar varieties may differ. When precision matters, it's best to weigh your ketchup rather than relying solely on volume measurements."
faqQ2: "Can I use this conversion for other tomato-based sauces?"
faqA2: "While this conversion works for standard tomato ketchup, other sauces like barbecue or cocktail sauce may have different densities. These often contain additional ingredients that change their weight per cup. For best results, check specific conversions for each sauce type or use kitchen scales."
faqQ3: "How do I measure sticky ingredients like ketchup accurately?"
faqA3: "For sticky substances like ketchup, lightly grease your measuring cups with oil first. This helps the ketchup slide out easily, giving you a more accurate measurement. Alternatively, use the displacement method: fill a liquid measuring cup with water, then add ketchup until the water rises by 1 cup."
faqQ4: "Why does my air fryer recipe call for ounces instead of cups?"
faqA4: "Many professional recipes use weight measurements (ounces) because they're more precise than volume measurements (cups). This is especially important in air frying, where exact ingredient ratios affect cooking time and texture. Investing in digital kitchen scales can improve your air fryer results significantly."

<p>1 cup of tomato ketchup equals approximately 8.5 ounces. This measurement is crucial when preparing sauces, glazes, or marinades for your air fryer recipes. Getting the quantities right ensures consistent flavour and texture in dishes like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer chicken wings</a> or homemade burgers.</p>

<h2>Why accurate ketchup measurements matter</h2>
<p>When cooking with an air fryer, precise ingredient ratios make all the difference. Too much tomato ketchup in a marinade can make food soggy, while too little might leave it lacking flavour. Many popular <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipes</a> call for specific amounts of ketchup to achieve that perfect sticky glaze.</p>
<p>The density of tomato ketchup means it doesn't follow the standard liquid conversion of 1 cup = 8 fluid ounces. Its thicker consistency results in slightly more weight per volume. This is why weighing ingredients often yields better results than volume measurements alone.</p>

<h2>Converting cups to ounces for ketchup</h2>
<p>For most cooking applications, you can use the standard conversion of 1 cup tomato ketchup = 8.5 ounces. This measurement works well whether you're making <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable dips</a> or basting meats. Keep in mind that different brands may vary slightly in thickness.</p>
<p>If you need smaller quantities, here are some helpful conversions: ½ cup = 4.25 ounces, ¼ cup = 2.125 ounces. These measurements come in handy when adjusting recipe portions for your air fryer's capacity.</p>

<h3>Measuring ketchup without scales</h3>
<p>No kitchen scales? No problem. You can measure tomato ketchup by volume using standard cups and spoons. A packed, level cup of ketchup will give you roughly 8.5 ounces. For smaller amounts, remember that 1 tablespoon equals about 0.5 ounces of ketchup.</p>

<h2>Using ketchup in air fryer recipes</h2>
<p>Tomato ketchup forms the base of many delicious air fryer sauces and glazes. From <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/beef>beef meatballs</a> to vegetable stir-fries, knowing your measurements ensures perfect results every time. The high heat of air frying caramelises the sugars in ketchup beautifully.</p>
<p>When substituting ketchup in recipes, remember that 8.5 ounces equals 1 cup. This conversion is particularly useful when scaling recipes up or down to suit your air fryer's size.

faqQ1: "Can I use cow’s milk instead of goat milk in air fryer recipes?"
faqA1: "Yes, cow’s milk can substitute goat milk in most recipes, but the flavour and texture may differ slightly. Goat milk is creamier and tangier, so adjust seasonings if needed. For precise results, stick to the same measurement—1.5 cups (12 oz) of cow’s milk equals the same volume."
faqQ2: "Why does my air fryer recipe turn out soggy with goat milk?"
faqA2: "Sogginess often comes from excess moisture. Ensure you’re measuring accurately—1.5 cups of goat milk should be 12 oz. Also, preheat your air fryer and avoid overcrowding the basket. Proper airflow is key to crispy results, especially with liquid-heavy ingredients."
faqQ3: "How do I store leftover goat milk for air fryer recipes?"
faqA3: "Store opened goat milk in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 5 days. Shake well before using, as separation is normal. For longer storage, freeze it in 1.5-cup (12 oz) portions—thaw in the fridge before cooking."
faqQ4: "Is goat milk healthier than cow’s milk for air frying?"
faqA4: "Goat milk has slightly more calcium and easier digestibility for some people, but both work well in air fryer recipes. The choice depends on dietary preferences. Nutritionally, 1.5 cups (12 oz) of either provides similar benefits when cooked."

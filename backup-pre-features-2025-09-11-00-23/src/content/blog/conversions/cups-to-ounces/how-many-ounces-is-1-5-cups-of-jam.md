faqQ1: "Does the type of jam affect the weight of 1.5 cups?"
faqA1: "Yes, thicker jams like marmalade or fruit preserves may weigh slightly more per cup than runnier jams. For absolute accuracy, weighing your jam with a kitchen scale is best, especially in air fryer cooking where consistency matters."
faqQ2: "Can I use grams instead of ounces for measuring jam?"
faqA2: "Absolutely! 1.5 cups of jam is roughly 340 grams. Many kitchen scales switch between ounces and grams, making it easy to measure jam for international recipes or precise air fryer cooking."
faqQ3: "How do I convert 1.5 cups of jam for a smaller air fryer batch?"
faqA3: "Simply halve or quarter the measurement—0.75 cups would be 6 oz, and 0.375 cups would be 3 oz. Air fryers excel at smaller portions, so adjusting jam quantities ensures perfect results without waste."
faqQ4: "Why does my jam glaze burn in the air fryer?"
faqA4: "Air fryers cook quickly, and sugary jams can caramelise or burn if applied too thickly. Brush a thin, even layer and check frequently. Reducing temperature slightly (by 10°C) can also help prevent burning."

<p>1.5 cups of jam equals approximately 12 ounces, making it easy to measure for your air fryer recipes.

Too much jam can lead to burning, while too little may leave your dish lacking flavour.</p>

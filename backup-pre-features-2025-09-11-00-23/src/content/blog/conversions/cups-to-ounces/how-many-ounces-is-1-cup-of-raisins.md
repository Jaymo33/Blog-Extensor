faqQ1: "Can I use a kitchen scale instead of measuring cups for raisins?"
faqA1: "Yes, a kitchen scale is the most accurate way to measure raisins. Since 1 cup equals about 5.5 ounces, weighing ensures precision, especially for baking. Scales eliminate packing inconsistencies and give reliable results every time."
faqQ2: "Do different types of raisins weigh the same per cup?"
faqA2: "Most raisins, whether golden or dark, weigh similarly per cup. However, jumbo raisins may take up more space, slightly affecting the weight. For best results, stick to the standard 5.5-ounce measurement unless specified otherwise."
faqQ3: "How do I convert grams to ounces for raisins?"
faqA3: "1 cup of raisins is approximately 155 grams, which converts to 5.5 ounces. If your recipe uses grams, multiply by 0.035 to get ounces. For quick conversions, refer to our air fryer measurement guides."
faqQ4: "Why does my raisin measurement seem off in air fryer recipes?"
faqA4: "Packing raisins too tightly or using stale raisins can alter measurements. Always measure lightly and check freshness. If your air fryer results vary, try weighing instead of using cups for better consistency."

<p>1 cup of raisins equals approximately 5.5 ounces (or 155 grams). This measurement is essential for air fryer recipes, ensuring your dishes turn out perfectly every time. Whether you're baking raisin-studded cookies or adding sweetness to a savoury dish, accurate measurements make all the difference.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate raisin measurements matter</h2>  
<p>Using the correct amount of raisins ensures balanced flavours and textures in your cooking. Too many can make a dish overly sweet, while too few might leave it lacking. For air fryer recipes, precise measurements help avoid uneven cooking or burning.

<h2>How to measure raisins correctly</h2>  
<p>For the most accurate results, use a kitchen scale to weigh your raisins. If you don’t have one, lightly spoon raisins into a measuring cup without packing them down. This prevents over-measuring and ensures consistency. Whether you're making a breakfast bake or a dessert, proper measuring guarantees success.</p>

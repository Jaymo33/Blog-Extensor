faqQ1: "Can I use grams instead of ounces for measuring semolina?"
faqA1: "Yes, grams are another precise way to measure semolina. Since 1 ounce equals roughly 28.35 grams, 10.5 ounces of semolina is about 298 grams. Many kitchen scales allow you to toggle between units for convenience."
faqQ2: "Does the type of semolina affect the weight per cup?"
faqA2: "Slightly. Fine semolina may pack more densely than coarse semolina, leading to a small weight variation. For consistency, always use the spoon-and-level method when measuring by volume."
faqQ3: "Can I substitute semolina with regular flour in air fryer recipes?"
faqA3: "While possible, the results will differ. Semolina adds a unique crunch and texture that regular flour can’t replicate. If substituting, adjust cooking times as flour browns faster."
faqQ4: "How do I store leftover semolina after measuring?"
faqA4: "Keep semolina in an airtight container in a cool, dry place. Proper storage prevents moisture absorption, ensuring it stays fresh for future air fryer recipes."

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on even heat distribution, and incorrect ingredient quantities can lead to uneven cooking.

Measuring 1.75 cups of semolina in ounces removes the guesswork, ensuring your recipes turn out perfectly.

<p>Using a kitchen scale is the most accurate way to measure semolina, but if you don’t have one, our conversion guide will help. Semolina’s density means 1 cup typically weighs around 6 ounces, so 1.75 cups comes to roughly 10.5 ounces. This precision is especially useful for recipes like semolina-crusted fish or air-fried falafel.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure Semolina Without a Scale</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a scale, use the spoon-and-level method for the most accurate cup measurement. Gently spoon semolina into a measuring cup without packing it down, then level it off with a straight edge. This prevents over-measuring, which can throw off your recipe.

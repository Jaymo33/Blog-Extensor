faqQ1: "Can I use instant oats instead of rolled oats for 0.125 cup measurements?"
faqA1: "Yes, you can use instant oats, but be aware they may pack differently. 0.125 cup of instant oats might weigh slightly less than rolled oats due to finer texture. For air fryer recipes, rolled oats often provide better texture."
faqQ2: "How do I measure 0.125 cup of oats without a measuring cup?"
faqA2: "If you don't have a 1/8 cup measure, use 2 level tablespoons as this equals 0.125 cup. For ultimate accuracy, use digital scales to measure out 1 ounce (28g) of oats, which is the equivalent weight."
faqQ3: "Does the type of oat affect the weight of 0.125 cup?"
faqA3: "Yes, different oat varieties can vary slightly in weight. Steel-cut oats are denser than rolled oats, so 0.125 cup would weigh more. For air fryer recipes, rolled oats are most commonly used and 0.125 cup typically weighs about 1 ounce."
faqQ4: "Why do my air fryer recipes call for such small amounts like 0.125 cup of oats?"
faqA4: "Air fryers have smaller capacities than conventional ovens, so recipes often use smaller quantities. 0.125 cup (1 ounce) of oats is perfect for single servings or coatings. This precision helps ensure even cooking in the compact air fryer space."

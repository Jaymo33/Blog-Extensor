<p>Air fryers rely on precise measurements to ensure even cooking and crispiness. Too much liquid, like apple juice, can create steam, which may prevent food from crisping up properly. On the other hand, too little liquid might result in dry or unevenly cooked dishes. For best results, measure your apple juice carefully and adjust other ingredients accordingly.

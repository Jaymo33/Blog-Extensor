faqQ1: "Can I use gelatin sheets instead of powder for 0.375 cup measurements?"
faqA1: "Gelatin sheets and powder aren’t interchangeable by volume, as sheets are measured by weight. For 0.375 cup (3 oz) of powder, you’d need about 9–10 sheets, depending on their strength. Always check the packaging for exact conversions, as sheet sizes vary by brand."
faqQ2: "Why does my air fryer gelatin dessert turn out rubbery?"
faqA2: "Using too much gelatin can make desserts rubbery. Ensure you’re measuring 0.375 cup (3 oz) accurately and not packing the powder. Overheating gelatin in the air fryer can also affect texture, so follow recipe temperatures closely."
faqQ3: "How do I store leftover gelatin powder?"
faqA3: "Keep unused gelatin powder in an airtight container in a cool, dry place. Moisture can cause clumping, which affects measurements. Properly stored, it lasts up to 2 years, but always check for freshness before using."
faqQ4: "Can I halve a recipe that uses 0.375 cup gelatin powder?"
faqA4: "Yes, you can halve the recipe to use 0.1875 cup (1.5 oz) of gelatin powder. Use a kitchen scale for precision, as measuring small volumes can be tricky. Adjust other ingredients proportionally for best results."

<h3>How to measure gelatin powder correctly</h3>  
<p>To measure 0.375 cup of gelatin powder accurately, use a dry measuring cup and level it off with a straight edge. Avoid packing the powder down, as this can lead to over-measuring. For best results, weigh it on a kitchen scale—3 ounces is the ideal weight for 0.375 cup. If you don’t have a scale, fluff the powder lightly before scooping to prevent compaction. This method works perfectly for air fryer recipes like jellies or no-bake cheesecakes.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for 0.375 cup gelatin powder</h2>  
<p>0.375 cup (3 oz) of gelatin powder is often used in small-batch desserts. It’s perfect for making individual jellies, mousses, or even marshmallows in the air fryer. Many <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert recipes</a> call for this amount to ensure a firm yet tender texture. Gelatin also works wonders in savoury dishes like terrines or aspics, though these are less common in air fryer cooking. Knowing the ounce equivalent helps adapt traditional recipes for air fryer use.</p>  

<p>Gelatin’s binding properties make it a versatile ingredient. In the air fryer, it can help stabilise whipped creams or create light, airy textures in mousses. If you’re new to using gelatin, start with 0.375 cup (3 oz) measurements for smaller batches. This reduces waste and lets you perfect your technique.

For smaller quantities, 0.25 cup is 2 ounces, and 0.125 cup is 1 ounce. These conversions are handy when scaling recipes up or down for air fryer cooking. Always measure gelatin by weight for the most accurate results, especially in delicate desserts.</p>

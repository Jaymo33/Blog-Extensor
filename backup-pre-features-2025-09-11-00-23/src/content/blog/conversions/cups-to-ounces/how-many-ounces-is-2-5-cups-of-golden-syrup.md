faqQ1: "Can I use honey instead of golden syrup in my air fryer recipes?"
faqA1: "Yes, you can substitute honey for golden syrup in most recipes, but keep in mind that honey is slightly sweeter and has a stronger flavour. Use a 1:1 ratio, but you may want to reduce the amount slightly to avoid overpowering the dish. Honey also browns faster in the air fryer, so adjust cooking times accordingly."
faqQ2: "How do I clean golden syrup from my air fryer basket?"
faqA2: "To clean golden syrup from your air fryer basket, soak it in warm, soapy water for 10-15 minutes to loosen the sticky residue. Use a soft sponge or brush to gently scrub away the syrup. Avoid abrasive cleaners, as they can damage the non-stick coating. For stubborn spots, a mixture of baking soda and water can help."
faqQ3: "Is golden syrup the same as corn syrup?"
faqA3: "No, golden syrup and corn syrup are not the same. Golden syrup is made from sugar cane and has a distinct caramel flavour, while corn syrup is made from corn starch and is milder in taste. They can sometimes be used interchangeably, but the flavour and texture of your dish may vary."
faqQ4: "Can I freeze dishes made with golden syrup in the air fryer?"
faqA4: "Yes, many dishes made with golden syrup can be frozen and reheated in the air fryer. Allow the dish to cool completely before freezing, and store it in an airtight container. When reheating, use a lower temperature to prevent burning, and check frequently to ensure even heating."

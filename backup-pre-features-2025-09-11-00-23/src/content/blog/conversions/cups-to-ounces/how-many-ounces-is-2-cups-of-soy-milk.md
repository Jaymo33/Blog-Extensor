<p>2 cups of soy milk equals approximately 16 fluid ounces (oz) in the UK. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements matter. Whether you’re making a creamy sauce or a fluffy cake, knowing the exact weight ensures perfect results every time.

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on precise ingredient ratios to deliver consistent results. Too much or too little liquid, like soy milk, can affect texture and cooking times. For example, adding 16 oz of soy milk instead of 2 cups could throw off a recipe’s balance. That’s why conversions matter, especially for baking or making batters. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more handy tips.</p>  

<p>Many air fryer recipes, like pancakes or muffins, use soy milk as a dairy-free alternative. Measuring correctly ensures your dishes turn out light and fluffy. If you’re experimenting with new recipes, always double-check your conversions. A kitchen scale can help, but knowing that 2 cups of soy milk equal 16 oz simplifies the process.</p>  

<h2>How to measure soy milk for air fryer recipes</h2>  
<p>Measuring soy milk accurately is easy with the right tools. Use a liquid measuring cup for the most precise results, filling it to the 2-cup mark. If you’re using a scale, 16 oz is your target weight. For recipes requiring smaller amounts, remember that 1 cup of soy milk equals 8 oz. This method works for all air fryer dishes, from savoury sauces to sweet desserts.</p>  

<h3>Common mistakes when measuring soy milk</h3>  
<p>One frequent error is using a dry measuring cup instead of a liquid one, which can lead to inaccuracies. Another is eyeballing the amount, which often results in too much or too little liquid. Always level off the top of your measuring cup for consistency. If you’re unsure, refer to our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a> for foolproof measurements.</p>

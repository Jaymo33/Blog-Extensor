<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Using the correct amount of cottage cheese can make or break your air fryer dish. Too much can lead to excess moisture, while too little might leave your meal lacking flavour. Measuring 0.125 cup of cottage cheese in ounces ensures consistency, especially when following recipes from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>our collection</a>. Whether you’re making a cheesy dip or a protein-packed breakfast, precision is key.</p>  

<p>Air fryers cook food quickly, so even small measurement errors can affect texture and taste. For example, if a recipe calls for 0.125 cup of cottage cheese (1 oz), adding more could make your dish soggy. Conversely, using less might result in dryness. That’s why we recommend using a kitchen scale for the most accurate results.</p>  

<h3>How to measure 0.125 cup of cottage cheese without scales</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a kitchen scale, you can still measure 0.125 cup of cottage cheese using standard measuring cups. One-eighth of a cup is equivalent to 2 tablespoons, which weighs roughly 1 ounce. For best results, lightly pack the cottage cheese into the measuring spoon to avoid air gaps. This method works well for recipes like air fryer stuffed mushrooms or cheesy potato bites.</p>

<h2>Storing and handling cottage cheese for air fryer recipes</h2>

Cottage cheese can spoil quickly if left at room temperature, so handle it with care when preparing air fryer meals.</p>

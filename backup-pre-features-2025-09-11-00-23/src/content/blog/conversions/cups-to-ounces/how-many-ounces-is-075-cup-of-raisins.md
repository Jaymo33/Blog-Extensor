faqQ1: "Can I use 0.75 cup of raisins in savoury air fryer dishes?"
faqA1: "Absolutely! Raisins add a natural sweetness that balances spicy or tangy flavours. Try them in air-fried Moroccan chicken or roasted root vegetables. Just remember to adjust cooking times slightly, as sugars can caramelise quickly."
faqQ2: "Do golden raisins weigh the same as regular raisins per 0.75 cup?"
faqA2: "Yes, golden and regular raisins have similar weights. 0.75 cup of either type equals about 3.5 ounces. The main difference is flavour—golden raisins are slightly sweeter and fruitier, while regular raisins have a deeper, richer taste."
faqQ3: "How should I adjust cooking times for 0.75 cup of raisins in air fryer recipes?"
faqA3: "Raisins cook quickly in the air fryer, usually needing just 2-3 minutes at 160°C. If they're mixed into batters or doughs, follow the main recipe's timing. For standalone roasting, check frequently to prevent burning."
faqQ4: "Can I substitute other dried fruits for 0.75 cup of raisins?"
faqA4: "You can swap raisins for chopped dates, dried cranberries, or currants in equal amounts by weight (3.5 oz). Adjust sweetness levels in your recipe accordingly, as some dried fruits are more concentrated than raisins."

<h2>Tips for working with raisins in the air fryer</h2>  
<p>Raisins can burn quickly in the air fryer due to their sugar content. To prevent this, toss them with a bit of oil or mix them into batters or doughs. For even cooking, spread them out rather than clumping them together. This ensures they caramelise without charring.</p>  
<p>If your recipe calls for plump raisins, soak them in warm water for 10 minutes before use. Drain and pat dry to avoid excess moisture in your air fryer. This trick works wonders for <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/breakfast>breakfast bakes</a> or energy bars.</p>  

<h3>Storing leftover raisins</h3>  
<p>After measuring out 0.75 cup, store any unused raisins in an airtight container in a cool, dark place. They’ll stay fresh for months, ready for your next air fryer adventure. For longer storage, refrigerate or freeze them to maintain their chewy texture.</p>

faqQ1: "Can I use bottled lemonade instead of fresh for 0.33 cup measurements?"
faqA1: "Yes, bottled lemonade works fine for measuring 0.33 cup (2.64 oz). Just ensure it’s unsweetened if your recipe requires less sugar. Fresh lemonade may have a brighter flavour, but bottled versions are convenient and consistent for air fryer recipes."
faqQ2: "How does 0.33 cup of lemonade affect cooking times in an air fryer?"
faqA2: "0.33 cup of lemonade (2.64 oz) adds minimal liquid, so it won’t significantly alter cooking times. However, if used in a marinade, pat proteins dry before air frying to avoid excess moisture. This ensures crispy results every time."
faqQ3: "Is 0.33 cup of lemonade the same as 0.33 cup of lemon juice?"
faqA3: "No, lemonade is sweeter and less concentrated than lemon juice. If substituting, adjust sugar and water in your recipe. For precise conversions, check our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>."
faqQ4: "Can I freeze 0.33 cup portions of lemonade for later use?"

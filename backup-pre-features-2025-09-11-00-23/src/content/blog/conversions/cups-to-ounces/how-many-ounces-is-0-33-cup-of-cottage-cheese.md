faqQ1: "Is 0.33 cup of cottage cheese the same as 1/3 cup?"
faqA1: "Yes, 0.33 cup is roughly equivalent to 1/3 cup, though it’s slightly less (0.33 is 33/100, while 1/3 is approximately 0.333). For most recipes, this minor difference won’t affect the outcome. In air fryer cooking, precision matters, so using a scale to measure 2.64 ounces ensures accuracy."
faqQ2: "Can I use grams instead of ounces for cottage cheese measurements?"
faqA2: "Absolutely! If you prefer metric measurements, 0.33 cup of cottage cheese is about 75 grams. Many kitchen scales allow you to switch between units, making conversions effortless. This is especially useful for air fryer recipes where consistency is key."
faqQ3: "Does the fat content of cottage cheese affect the weight per cup?"
faqA3: "The fat content (e.g., full-fat vs. low-fat) doesn’t significantly change the weight per cup, as the difference is minimal. However, thicker varieties may pack more densely, so weighing is still the most reliable method. For air fryer recipes, stick to 2.64 ounces for 0.33 cup regardless of fat content."
faqQ4: "How should I store leftover cottage cheese after measuring?"
faqA4: "Always store cottage cheese in an airtight container in the fridge and use it within 3–5 days. If you’ve measured out 0.33 cup, transfer the rest back to its original container promptly. For longer storage, consider freezing it, though the texture may change slightly upon thawing."

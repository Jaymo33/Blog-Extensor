faqQ1: "Can I use a kitchen scale to measure 2.5 cups of jam in ounces?"
faqA1: "Yes, a kitchen scale is the most accurate way to measure jam in ounces. Simply place your container on the scale, tare it to zero, and add jam until you reach 20 ounces. This method avoids the mess of sticky measuring cups."
faqQ2: "Does the type of jam affect the ounce measurement?"
faqA2: "While most jams have a similar density, thicker varieties like marmalade or preserves might weigh slightly more. For precise results, always weigh your jam if the recipe calls for ounces. A standard conversion assumes an average consistency."
faqQ3: "How many tablespoons are in 2.5 cups of jam?"
faqA3: "2.5 cups of jam equals 40 tablespoons (since 1 cup = 16 tbsp). This is useful for recipes that list smaller quantities. For air fryer sauces or glazes, tablespoons can be easier to work with than ounces."
faqQ4: "Can I substitute jam for other sweeteners in air fryer recipes?"
faqA4: "Yes, jam can replace sugar or syrup in many recipes, but adjust liquids accordingly. Since jam adds moisture, reduce other wet ingredients slightly.

faqQ1: "Can I use whole walnuts instead of chopped for 1.25 cups?"
faqA1: "Yes, but whole walnuts take up more space, so the weight will differ. Chopped walnuts pack more densely, so 1.25 cups equals about 5 ounces. For whole walnuts, you’ll need to adjust the measurement slightly."
faqQ2: "How do I convert 1.25 cups of chopped walnuts to grams?"
faqA2: "5 ounces of chopped walnuts is roughly 142 grams. If your recipe uses metric measurements, this conversion ensures accuracy. Always use a scale for the most precise results in air fryer cooking."
faqQ3: "Why does the weight of chopped walnuts vary?"
faqA3: "The weight can change based on how finely the walnuts are chopped and how tightly packed they are. Loosely filled 1.25 cups may weigh less than 5 ounces, while packed cups could weigh more."
faqQ4: "Can I substitute other nuts for chopped walnuts in air fryer recipes?"
faqA4: "Yes, almonds or pecans can work, but their weights differ. Always check conversion charts to ensure you’re using the right amount. For nut-free options, seeds like sunflower seeds are a great alternative."

faqQ1: "Can I use salted sunflower seeds in air fryer recipes?"

faqQ2: "How long do roasted sunflower seeds last in an airtight container?"
faqA2: "Properly stored, roasted sunflower seeds stay fresh for up to 3 months. Keep them in a cool, dark place to maintain crunchiness. For longer storage, refrigerate or freeze them in sealed bags."
faqQ3: "Can I substitute sunflower seeds for nuts in air fryer recipes?"
faqA3: "Absolutely! Sunflower seeds work well as a nut-free alternative in most recipes. They provide similar crunch and texture, though the flavour will differ slightly. Adjust cooking times if needed."
faqQ4: "Why do my sunflower seeds burn in the air fryer?"
faqA4: "Sunflower seeds have a high oil content, so they can burn quickly. Reduce the temperature to 160°C and check every 2-3 minutes. Shaking the basket halfway through also ensures even roasting."

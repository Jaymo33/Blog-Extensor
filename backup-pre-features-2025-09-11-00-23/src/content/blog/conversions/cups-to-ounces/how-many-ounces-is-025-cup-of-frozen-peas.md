faqQ1: "Can I use fresh peas instead of frozen for the 0.25 cup measurement?"
faqA1: "Yes, but fresh peas weigh slightly less—about 1.25 oz per 0.25 cup. Adjust cooking time to 2–3 minutes in the air fryer, as fresh peas cook faster. They also won’t have the ice glaze that frozen peas do, so you might need a light oil spray to prevent drying."
faqQ2: "How do I convert 0.25 cup of frozen peas to grams?"
faqA2: "0.25 cup of frozen peas equals roughly 42.5 grams. If your recipe uses metric measurements, this conversion ensures accuracy. Use a kitchen scale for precision, especially when scaling up for larger batches in the air fryer."
faqQ3: "Why does my air fryer cook 0.25 cup of frozen peas unevenly?"
faqA3: "Uneven cooking usually happens if peas are piled too high or not shaken during cooking. Spread them in a single layer and shake the basket halfway. Also, check for hot spots in your air fryer—some models have uneven airflow that affects smaller quantities."
faqQ4: "Can I season 0.25 cup of frozen peas before air frying?"
faqA4: "Absolutely! Toss the peas with a bit of oil, salt, pepper, or herbs before cooking. For 0.25 cup portions, a pinch of seasoning is enough. Avoid wet marinades, as they can make the peas soggy. Try paprika or lemon zest for extra zing."

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air frying</h2>  
<p>Getting the right quantity of frozen peas ensures even cooking and prevents overcrowding in your air fryer basket. Overloading can lead to unevenly cooked peas, while too few may dry out. Measuring 0.25 cup (1.5 oz) of frozen peas is ideal for single servings or small batches. If you're meal prepping, scale up accordingly and store extras in the freezer.

<p>Air fryers excel at reheating or crisping frozen vegetables like peas, but portion control is key. A 0.25 cup serving cooks quickly, usually in 3–5 minutes at 180°C. This small quantity works well alongside proteins or in mixed veggie trays. Remember, frozen peas don’t need thawing—toss them straight into the air fryer for best results.</p>  

<h3>Converting cups to ounces for frozen peas</h3>  
<p>While 0.25 cup of frozen peas weighs roughly 1.5 oz, slight variations can occur based on pea size and packing density. For precision, use a kitchen scale—especially when adapting recipes. If you don’t have one, fluff the peas in the cup before measuring to avoid compacting. Need more conversions?

<h2>Best ways to cook 0.25 cup of frozen peas in an air fryer</h2>  
<p>A 0.25 cup portion of frozen peas is perfect for quick snacks or garnishes. Lightly spray the basket with oil, add the peas, and cook at 180°C for 3–4 minutes, shaking halfway. For extra flavour, toss with a pinch of salt, garlic powder, or parmesan. These peas make a great topping for air-fried fish or a vibrant addition to grain bowls.</p>  

<p>If you’re batch-cooking, multiply the 0.25 cup measurement but avoid stacking peas too deeply. Spread them in a single layer for optimal crispness. Pair with other quick-cooking veggies like diced carrots or sweetcorn for a colourful mix.

<h3>Storing and reheating leftover peas</h3>  
<p>Cooked 0.25 cup portions of peas can be refrigerated for up to 3 days. Reheat them in the air fryer at 160°C for 2 minutes to restore texture. Avoid overcooking, as peas can become mushy. For freezer storage, spread cooked peas on a tray to freeze individually before bagging—this prevents clumping.</p>  

<h2>Common mistakes when measuring frozen peas</h2>  
<p>One error is packing the 0.25 cup too tightly, which skews the ounce conversion. Always spoon peas loosely into the measuring cup. Another mistake is assuming all frozen veggies weigh the same—peas are denser than leafy greens. Finally, forgetting to account for ice glaze can slightly increase weight. Pat peas dry if excess moisture is present.</p>  

<p>For perfectly measured 0.25 cup (1.5 oz) portions, consider pre-portioning peas in small bags or containers. This saves time and ensures consistency across recipes.

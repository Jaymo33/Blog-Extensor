faqQ1: "Can I use fresh ginger instead of ginger paste in my air fryer recipes?"
faqA1: "Yes, you can substitute fresh ginger for ginger paste in air fryer recipes. Use about 1 tablespoon of freshly grated ginger for every 0.125 cup (1 ounce) of ginger paste. Fresh ginger may have a slightly stronger flavour, so adjust to taste. Remember to grate it finely for even distribution in your dish."
faqQ2: "How long does ginger paste last in the fridge?"
faqA2: "Ginger paste typically lasts 2-3 weeks in the fridge if stored in an airtight container. For longer storage, freeze it in ice cube trays and thaw as needed. Always check for signs of spoilage, like mould or off smells, before using. Proper storage ensures your ginger paste stays fresh for air fryer recipes."
faqQ3: "Can I make ginger paste at home for air fryer cooking?"
faqA3: "Absolutely! Blend fresh ginger with a bit of water or oil until smooth to make homemade ginger paste. Store it in the fridge or freezer for future use. Homemade paste often has a fresher flavour than store-bought versions. Use our conversion to measure 0.125 cup (1 ounce) for your air fryer recipes."
faqQ4: "Does ginger paste lose its flavour when cooked in an air fryer?"
faqA4: "Ginger paste retains much of its flavour when cooked in an air fryer, thanks to the quick cooking time. However, prolonged high heat can slightly mellow its intensity. For the best results, add ginger paste towards the end of cooking or mix it into marinades beforehand. This preserves its vibrant taste in your dishes."

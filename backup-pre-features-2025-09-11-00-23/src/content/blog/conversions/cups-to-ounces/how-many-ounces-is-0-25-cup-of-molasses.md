faqQ1: "Can I use honey instead of 0.25 cup of molasses in air fryer recipes?"
faqA1: "Yes, you can substitute honey for 0.25 cup (3 ounces) of molasses, but the flavour will be different. Use the same 3 ounce measurement, but expect a lighter, less robust taste. Honey also burns more easily in the air fryer, so reduce the temperature slightly."
faqQ2: "Why does my air fryer recipe call for 0.25 cup of molasses specifically?"
faqA2: "Recipes often specify 0.25 cup (3 ounces) of molasses because it's a common measurement that provides enough flavour without overwhelming other ingredients. In air fryer cooking, this amount caramelises well without making food too sticky or causing excessive smoke."
faqQ3: "How do I measure 0.25 cup of molasses without making a mess?"
faqA3: "To measure 0.25 cup (3 ounces) of molasses cleanly, lightly oil your measuring cup first. Pour slowly and use a rubber spatula to scrape out every last bit. For even easier measuring, consider using a kitchen scale to weigh out exactly 3 ounces."
faqQ4: "Does blackstrap molasses measure the same as regular molasses for 0.25 cup conversions?"
faqA4: "Yes, 0.25 cup of blackstrap molasses also equals about 3 ounces by volume. However, blackstrap has a stronger, more bitter flavour, so you might want to use slightly less. The thickness is similar, so the measurement conversion remains the same."

faqQ1: "Can I use a tablespoon to measure 0.25 cup of worcestershire sauce?"
faqA1: "Yes, 0.25 cup equals 4 tablespoons, so you can measure it that way if you don’t have a measuring cup. However, using a kitchen scale for 2 ounces is more precise, especially for air fryer recipes where accuracy matters."
faqQ2: "Does the brand of worcestershire sauce affect the weight?"
faqA2: "Most worcestershire sauces have a similar density, so 0.25 cup should still be around 2 ounces regardless of brand. However, thicker or artisanal versions might vary slightly. For best results, check the label or use a scale."
faqQ3: "How long does 0.25 cup of worcestershire sauce last in the fridge?"
faqA3: "Worcestershire sauce has a long shelf life, even after opening. A 0.25 cup portion will stay fresh for months if stored properly. Just make sure the bottle is tightly sealed and kept in a cool, dark place."
faqQ4: "Can I substitute soy sauce for worcestershire sauce in air fryer recipes?"
faqA4: "While soy sauce can work in a pinch, it has a saltier and less complex flavour. If substituting, use slightly less soy sauce (about 1.5 ounces for 0.25 cup worcestershire) and adjust to taste. For authentic results, stick to worcestershire sauce where possible."

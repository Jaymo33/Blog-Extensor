faqQ1: "Can I use fresh pineapple juice instead of bottled for 0.75 cup measurements?"
faqA1: "Yes, fresh pineapple juice works perfectly. Just strain it to remove pulp before measuring. Note that fresh juice may be slightly tangier, so adjust other recipe ingredients if needed."
faqQ2: "How does 0.75 cup pineapple juice affect cooking time in an air fryer?"
faqA2: "The juice adds moisture, so foods may cook slightly faster. For marinades, pat excess juice off before air frying to prevent steaming. Always check doneness a few minutes early."
faqQ3: "Is 0.75 cup pineapple juice the same in weight ounces and fluid ounces?"
faqA3: "No, fluid ounces measure volume, while weight ounces measure mass. For pineapple juice, 0.75 cup equals 6 fl oz (volume) or roughly 6.2 oz by weight. Use fluid ounces for accuracy."
faqQ4: "Can I substitute 0.75 cup pineapple juice with another fruit juice in air fryer recipes?"
faqA4: "Orange or mango juice can work, but they’re sweeter. Reduce added sugars in the recipe. For acidity, dilute with a splash of vinegar. Adjust cooking times as needed for consistency."

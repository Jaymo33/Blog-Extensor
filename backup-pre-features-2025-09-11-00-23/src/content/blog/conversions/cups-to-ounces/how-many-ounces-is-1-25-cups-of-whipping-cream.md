faqQ1: "Does 1.25 cups of whipping cream weigh the same as 1.25 cups of milk?"
faqA1: "No, whipping cream is denser than milk due to its higher fat content. While 1.25 cups of whole milk equals about 10oz by volume, whipping cream will weigh slightly more at approximately 10.5oz. Always check your specific recipe requirements when substituting dairy products in air fryer cooking."
faqQ2: "Can I use millilitres instead of ounces for measuring 1.25 cups whipping cream?"
faqA2: "Absolutely! 1.25 UK cups of whipping cream converts to 284ml. Many digital scales and measuring jugs display both units. For air fryer recipes, millilitres can be more precise since they allow for smaller increments than fluid ounces, especially important when scaling down recipes for smaller appliances."
faqQ3: "How does the UK ounce measurement for whipping cream differ from the US?"
faqA3: "The UK uses imperial fluid ounces (1 cup = 8.12oz) while the US uses customary fluid ounces (1 cup = 8oz). This means 1.25 cups of whipping cream is 10.14oz in UK measurements versus exactly 10oz in US measurements. The difference is minimal but worth noting for precise baking in air fryers."
faqQ4: "What’s the best way to measure 1.25 cups of whipping cream without a measuring cup?"
faqA4: "If you don’t have measuring cups, use a standard UK tablespoon (15ml). 1.25 cups equals about 20 tablespoons of whipping cream. Alternatively, use a clean 500ml water bottle marked at the 284ml level. For air fryer recipes, we recommend investing in proper measuring tools for consistent results."

<h2>Converting 1.25 Cups Whipping Cream for UK Recipes</h2>
<p>Many British recipes, especially those in the <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert category</a>, specify ingredients by weight.

faqQ1: "Can I use a kitchen scale to measure worcestershire sauce in ounces?"
faqA1: "Yes, a kitchen scale is one of the most accurate ways to measure worcestershire sauce in ounces. Simply place your container on the scale, tare it to zero, then pour the sauce until you reach the desired weight. This method is especially useful for air fryer recipes where precision matters."
faqQ2: "Does the brand of worcestershire sauce affect the weight per cup?"
faqA2: "Most worcestershire sauces have a similar density, so the weight per cup remains fairly consistent across brands. However, thicker or reduced-sodium versions might vary slightly. For best results, stick to the standard conversion of 1 cup = 8 ounces unless the label specifies otherwise."
faqQ3: "How can I adjust a recipe if I only have a 10-ounce bottle of worcestershire sauce?"
faqA3: "Since 2 cups equal 16 ounces, a 10-ounce bottle won't be enough. You can either scale the recipe down or make up the difference with a similar ingredient like soy sauce or balsamic vinegar. Always taste as you go to ensure the flavour balance stays intact."
faqQ4: "Is there a difference between US and UK fluid ounces for worcestershire sauce?"
faqA4: "The UK uses imperial fluid ounces, which are about 4% larger than US fluid ounces. However, for practical purposes in cooking, the difference is negligible. Unless you're making large batches, you can safely use the standard 1 cup = 8 ounces conversion in either measurement system."

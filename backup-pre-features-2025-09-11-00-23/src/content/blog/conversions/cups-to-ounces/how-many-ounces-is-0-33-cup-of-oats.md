faqQ1: "Can I use 0.33 cup of oats for air fryer granola?"
faqA1: "Absolutely! 0.33 cup (1.06 ounces) of oats is perfect for small-batch granola in the air fryer. Mix with honey, nuts, and a pinch of salt for a quick, crunchy breakfast. Just spread evenly in the basket and cook at 160°C for 8-10 minutes, shaking halfway."
faqQ2: "How does 0.33 cup of oats compare to rolled oats vs. quick oats?"
faqA2: "Rolled and quick oats have similar weights, so 0.33 cup of either type equals roughly 1.06 ounces. However, quick oats may compact more, so fluff them before measuring for accuracy. Rolled oats work better for texture in recipes like coatings or granola."
faqQ3: "Why does my oat coating fall off in the air fryer?"
faqA3: "If your oat coating isn’t sticking, the issue might be moisture. Lightly dampen the food (like chicken or fish) before pressing the oats on. Also, avoid overcrowding the air fryer basket, as this can cause uneven cooking and loose coatings."
faqQ4: "Can I substitute 0.33 cup of oats with flour in air fryer recipes?"
faqA4: "Oats and flour have different textures, so substitutions aren’t always 1:1. If replacing 0.33 cup (1.06 oz) of oats, use slightly less flour (about 0.75 oz) and adjust liquids as needed. Oats add chewiness, while flour creates a lighter coating."

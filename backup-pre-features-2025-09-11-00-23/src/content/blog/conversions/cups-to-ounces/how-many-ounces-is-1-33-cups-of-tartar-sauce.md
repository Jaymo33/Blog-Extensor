faqQ1: "Can I use the same conversion for light and thick tartar sauce?"

faqQ2: "How does tartar sauce measurement affect air fryer cooking times?"
faqA2: "Using the correct 10.64 ounces (1.33 cups) of tartar sauce ensures proper cooking times in your air fryer. Too much sauce can create excess moisture, requiring longer cooking, while too little may dry out your dish. Stick to the converted measurement for best results."

faqA3: "Yes, 1.33 cups converts to 10.64 ounces in both UK and US measurements for tartar sauce. The slight difference between imperial and US fluid ounces doesn't significantly impact thick sauces like tartar sauce where weight and volume align closely."
faqQ4: "What's the best way to measure 1.33 cups of tartar sauce without a measuring cup?"
faqA4: "If you don't have a measuring cup, use a kitchen scale to weigh out 10.64 ounces of tartar sauce. Alternatively, approximate 1 cup plus 1/3 cup using any consistent container, though weighing is more accurate for air fryer recipes."

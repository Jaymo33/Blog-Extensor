faqQ1: "Can I use a kitchen scale to measure Thai curry paste?"
faqA1: "Yes, a kitchen scale is the most accurate way to measure Thai curry paste. Simply place your container on the scale, tare it to zero, then add the paste until you reach 16 ounces for 2 cups. This method eliminates guesswork and ensures consistency in your air fryer recipes."
faqQ2: "Does the brand of Thai curry paste affect the weight per cup?"
faqA2: "Different brands may vary slightly in density, which can affect the weight per cup. Thicker pastes will weigh more, while looser ones may be lighter. Always check the label for specific weight conversions if precision is crucial for your dish."
faqQ3: "How long does Thai curry paste last in the fridge?"
faqA3: "An unopened jar of Thai curry paste can last up to a year in the fridge. Once opened, it’s best used within 3–4 months for optimal flavour. Store it in an airtight container to prevent drying out or absorbing other odours."
faqQ4: "Can I freeze leftover Thai curry paste?"
faqA4: "Absolutely! Freezing Thai curry paste in ice cube trays is a great way to portion it for future use. Once frozen, transfer the cubes to a sealed bag. They’ll keep for up to 6 months, ready to enhance your next air fryer meal."

<p>2 cups of Thai curry paste equals approximately 16 ounces (or 1 pound). This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes, ensuring accurate measurements for the best results. Whether you're making a fragrant curry or marinating meats, knowing the weight helps balance flavours perfectly.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Precision is key when using an air fryer, as ingredients cook quickly and evenly. Too much Thai curry paste can overpower a dish, while too little may leave it bland. For consistent results, measuring by weight (ounces) is often more reliable than volume (cups). This is especially true for dense ingredients like curry paste, which can vary in density.</p>  
<p>If you're exploring new recipes, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipe collection</a> for inspiration. Many dishes, from marinated chicken to vegetable stir-fries, benefit from the bold flavours of Thai curry paste. Measuring correctly ensures your meals turn out just right every time.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure Thai Curry Paste for Air Fryer Recipes</h3>  
<p>For the most accurate measurement, use a kitchen scale to weigh your Thai curry paste in ounces. If you don’t have one, spoon the paste into a measuring cup and level it off. Remember, 2 cups of Thai curry paste will weigh roughly 16 ounces, but slight variations can occur depending on brand and consistency.</p>  

<h2>Converting Cups to Ounces for Different Ingredients</h2>  
<p>Not all ingredients weigh the same per cup. While 2 cups of Thai curry paste equal about 16 ounces, other items like flour or sugar differ. For example, 2 cups of flour weigh around 9 ounces. This is why a conversion chart, like our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion guide</a>, is handy.</p>  
<p>Thai curry paste is denser than liquids like broth or oil, so its weight per cup is higher. Understanding these differences helps when adapting recipes for your air fryer. Whether you're cooking <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken dishes</a> or experimenting with tofu, precise measurements make all the difference.</p>  

<h3>Common Mistakes When Measuring Thai Curry Paste</h3>  
<p>One mistake is packing the paste too tightly into the cup, which can lead to using more than needed. Another is assuming all brands have the same consistency—some are thicker than others. Always check the label for weight equivalents if available, and adjust as needed for your air fryer recipes.</p>  

<h2>Using Thai Curry Paste in Air Fryer Meals</h2>  
<p>Thai curry paste adds depth to air fryer dishes, from glazed salmon to spicy tofu. Since 2 cups equal 16 ounces, you can portion it out for multiple meals. Try mixing a small amount with coconut milk for a marinade, or brush it onto <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>roasted vegetables</a> for extra flavour.</p>

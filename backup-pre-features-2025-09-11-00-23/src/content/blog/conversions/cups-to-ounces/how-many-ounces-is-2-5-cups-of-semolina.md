faqQ1: "Can I use the same conversion for different types of semolina?"
faqA1: "Yes, the conversion of 2.5 cups to 10.6 ounces applies to most semolina varieties. However, very fine or coarse semolina might have slightly different weights per cup. For absolute precision, especially in baking, it's best to weigh your specific semolina type."
faqQ2: "How does semolina measurement affect air fryer cooking times?"
faqA2: "The amount of semolina (like 2.5 cups/10.6 oz) can influence cooking times in your air fryer. Thicker coatings may need slightly longer, while lighter coatings cook faster. Always check food a few minutes before the recommended time, as air fryer models vary in heating efficiency."
faqQ3: "Is there a difference between US and UK ounces for semolina?"
faqA3: "No, both US and UK use the same ounce measurement for weight. So 2.5 cups of semolina equals 10.6 ounces in both systems. The only difference might be in cup sizes, but our conversion uses standard UK cup measurements."
faqQ4: "Can I substitute semolina with flour in air fryer recipes?"
faqA4: "While you can substitute flour, the results will differ. Semolina (2.5 cups/10.6 oz) creates a crispier coating than flour in air fryers. If substituting, you may need to adjust quantities slightly as flour is lighter than semolina by volume."

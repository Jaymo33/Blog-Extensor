faqQ1: "Can I use honey instead of sugar syrup in air fryer recipes?"
faqA1: "Yes, honey can be a substitute for sugar syrup, but it’s thicker and sweeter. Use about ¾ of the amount (e.g., 9 ounces instead of 12 ounces for 1.5 cups). Adjust cooking times slightly, as honey may caramelise faster in the air fryer."
faqQ2: "How do I convert 1.5 cups of sugar syrup to grams?"
faqA2: "1.5 cups (12 ounces) of sugar syrup is roughly 340 grams. Since sugar syrup density varies slightly, weighing it with a kitchen scale ensures accuracy, especially for baking in your air fryer."
faqQ3: "Why does my sugar syrup burn in the air fryer?"
faqA3: "Sugar syrup burns easily due to the air fryer’s intense heat. To prevent this, reduce cooking time or temperature, and apply syrup in thin layers. Always monitor dishes with sugary glazes closely."
faqQ4: "Can I make sugar syrup in the air fryer?"
faqA4: "It’s not recommended, as the air fryer’s dry heat isn’t ideal for making syrups. Use a stovetop for better control. However, you can warm pre-made syrup in the air fryer for 1–2 minutes at a low temperature."

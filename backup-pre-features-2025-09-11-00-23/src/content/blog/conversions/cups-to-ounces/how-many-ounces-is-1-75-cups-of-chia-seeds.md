faqQ1: "Can I use grams instead of ounces for measuring chia seeds?"
faqA1: "Yes, you can use grams for more precision. 1.75 cups of chia seeds (9.5 ounces) equals approximately 269 grams. Many digital scales toggle between units, making conversions easy. Grams are often preferred for baking and air fryer recipes where accuracy is key."
faqQ2: "Why does 1.75 cups of chia seeds weigh 9.5 ounces?"
faqA2: "Chia seeds are dense and small, packing more weight per volume than larger ingredients. One cup holds about 5.4 ounces due to their size and how they settle. The 1.75-cup measurement totals 9.5 ounces, a standard ratio used in professional and home kitchens alike."
faqQ3: "How should I store leftover chia seeds after measuring?"
faqA3: "Store chia seeds in an airtight container in a cool, dark place to maintain freshness. They can last up to two years when properly sealed. For longer shelf life, refrigerate or freeze them. Always measure dry chia seeds for recipes, as pre-soaked ones weigh differently."
faqQ4: "Do chia seeds measurements differ for air fryer recipes vs. baking?"
faqA4: "The weight (9.5 ounces per 1.75 cups) stays the same, but usage may vary. In air fryers, chia often acts as a binder or coating, while baking uses them for texture and moisture. Always follow recipe-specific instructions for best results in either method."

<h2>Why accurate chia seed measurements matter</h2>

<p>Many UK cooks prefer weighing ingredients for better accuracy, especially with small seeds like chia. Volume measurements can vary based on how tightly packed the cup is, but weight stays consistent. This is why our guide focuses on ounces, the preferred unit for baking and air frying.

faqQ1: "Can I use a kitchen scale instead of measuring cups for sesame oil?"
faqA1: "Yes, a kitchen scale is more accurate for measuring sesame oil. Set it to ounces, and pour until you reach 10.14 ounces for 1.25 cups. This method eliminates guesswork and ensures consistency in your air fryer recipes."
faqQ2: "Does the type of sesame oil affect the weight per cup?"
faqA2: "Light and toasted sesame oil have similar densities, so the weight difference is minimal. However, toasted sesame oil is more potent, so you might use slightly less for flavour. Always measure by weight if precision is crucial."
faqQ3: "How do I convert 1.25 cups of sesame oil to grams?"
faqA3: "1.25 cups (10.14 ounces) of sesame oil equals roughly 287 grams. This conversion is handy for recipes using metric measurements. A digital scale set to grams will give you the most accurate result."
faqQ4: "Can I substitute another oil for sesame oil in air fryer recipes?"
faqA4: "Yes, but the flavour will differ. Neutral oils like vegetable or canola work, but reduce the quantity slightly since sesame oil is more aromatic. For best results, stick to the original measurement if possible."

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>

Whether you're cooking <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken</a> or roasting vegetables, precision is key.

<h3>How to Measure Sesame Oil Correctly</h3>  
<p>When measuring sesame oil, always use a liquid measuring cup for accuracy. Fill it to the 1.25-cup mark at eye level to avoid over-pouring. For sticky oils like sesame, lightly greasing the cup beforehand can help it slide out easily.

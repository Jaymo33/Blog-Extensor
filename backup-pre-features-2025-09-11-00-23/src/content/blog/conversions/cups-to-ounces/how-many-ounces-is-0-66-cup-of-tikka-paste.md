faqQ1: "Can I use 0.66 cup of tikka paste for marinating chicken in the air fryer?"
faqA1: "Absolutely! 0.66 cup of tikka paste (5.28 ounces) is perfect for marinating 4-6 chicken breasts or thighs. Just coat the chicken evenly and let it sit for at least 30 minutes before air frying for the best flavour. The high heat of the air fryer will caramelise the paste, giving you deliciously charred edges."
faqQ2: "How do I convert 0.66 cup of tikka paste to grams?"
faqA2: "0.66 cup of tikka paste is roughly 150 grams. If you prefer using metric measurements, a kitchen scale set to grams will help you measure accurately. This conversion is handy if you’re following European recipes or prefer weighing ingredients for precision."
faqQ3: "Is 0.66 cup of tikka paste too much for one serving?"
faqA3: "It depends on the dish. For a single serving of marinated protein or vegetables, 0.66 cup (5.28 ounces) might be excessive. However, it’s ideal for 2-4 portions, especially if you’re making a sauce or coating ingredients. Adjust based on your recipe and taste preferences."
faqQ4: "Can I substitute 0.66 cup of tikka paste with another spice mix?"
faqA4: "While you can use other spice mixes, the flavour profile will differ. Tikka paste has a unique blend of spices like cumin, coriander, and garam masala. If substituting, start with less and adjust to taste, as other pastes may be stronger or milder than tikka."

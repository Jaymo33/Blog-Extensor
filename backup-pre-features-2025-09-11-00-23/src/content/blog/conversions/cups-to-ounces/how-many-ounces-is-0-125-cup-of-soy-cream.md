faqQ1: "Can I use almond milk instead of soy cream in air fryer recipes?"
faqA1: "Yes, but almond milk is thinner than soy cream. For every 0.125 cup (1 oz) of soy cream, use 1 oz almond milk plus 1/2 teaspoon cornstarch to mimic the creaminess. Adjust cooking times slightly as almond milk may brown faster."
faqQ2: "How do I measure 0.125 cup of soy cream without measuring tools?"
faqA2: "Use two tablespoons (0.125 cup equals exactly 2 tbsp). Alternatively, fill a standard shot glass about halfway (most hold 1.5-2 oz). These approximations work well for small quantities in air fryer recipes."
faqQ3: "Does soy cream weigh the same as dairy cream in ounces?"
faqA3: "No, soy cream is slightly denser. While 0.125 cup of dairy cream weighs about 1 oz, soy cream may weigh 1-1.1 oz due to its plant-based proteins. For baking, this small difference usually doesn't affect results."
faqQ4: "Can I freeze leftover soy cream after measuring out 0.125 cup?"
faqA4: "Yes, but texture may change slightly. Freeze in 1 oz portions for easy use later. Thaw in the refrigerator and whisk before using in air fryer recipes. Separation is normal - just mix well before adding to your dish."

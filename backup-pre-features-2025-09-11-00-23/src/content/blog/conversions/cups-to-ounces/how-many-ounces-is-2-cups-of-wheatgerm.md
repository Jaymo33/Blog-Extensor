faqQ1: "Can I use wheatgerm straight from the bag, or should I toast it first?"
faqA1: "Toasting wheatgerm enhances its nutty flavour, but it’s optional. For air fryer recipes, you can use it raw if you’re short on time. If toasting, spread 2 cups (5.3 oz) in a single layer and air fry at 160°C for 3–4 minutes, shaking halfway."
faqQ2: "Does the type of wheatgerm affect the 2 cups to ounces conversion?"
faqA2: "No, whether it’s raw or toasted, 2 cups of wheatgerm will weigh approximately 5.3 ounces. However, finely ground wheatgerm may settle more densely, so fluff it before measuring for accuracy."
faqQ3: "How should I store leftover wheatgerm after measuring 2 cups?"
faqA3: "Store wheatgerm in an airtight container in the fridge to prevent rancidity. It lasts up to 6 months this way. For smaller portions, freeze it in bags labelled with the ounce equivalent for future recipes."
faqQ4: "Can I substitute wheatgerm with breadcrumbs in air fryer recipes?"
faqA4: "Yes, but adjust quantities since breadcrumbs are lighter. For 2 cups wheatgerm (5.3 oz), use about 2.5 cups breadcrumbs. Check our conversion chart for exact swaps based on your recipe’s needs."

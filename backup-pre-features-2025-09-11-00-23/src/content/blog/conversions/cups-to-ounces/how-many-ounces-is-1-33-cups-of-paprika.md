faqQ1: "Is 1.33 cups of paprika the same in UK and US measurements?"
faqA1: "While 1 US cup equals 240ml and 1 UK cup equals 284ml, the weight in ounces remains consistent for paprika. So 1.33 cups of paprika is approximately 3.2 oz in both systems. Always use a kitchen scale for the most accurate results."
faqQ2: "Can I use ground paprika instead of regular paprika for this measurement?"
faqA2: "Yes, ground and regular paprika have similar densities, so the conversion (1.33 cups = 3.2 oz) applies to both. However, smoked or hot paprika varieties may pack slightly differently, so adjust to taste if substituting."
faqQ3: "How should I store leftover paprika after measuring 1.33 cups?"
faqA3: "Store paprika in an airtight container away from heat and light to preserve its flavour and colour. Properly stored, it can last up to 2-3 years, though its potency diminishes over time."
faqQ4: "What’s the best way to measure 1.33 cups of paprika without a scale?"
faqA4: "Use dry measuring cups and level off the paprika with a straight edge. For 1.33 cups, measure 1 full cup plus 1/3 cup. For better accuracy, consider investing in a digital kitchen scale—they’re affordable and invaluable for air fryer cooking."

faqQ1: "Can I use any type of hot sauce for this measurement?"
faqA1: "Yes, the 0.375 cup to 3 oz conversion works for all hot sauce varieties, whether it’s Tabasco, sriracha, or homemade. Just note that thicker sauces may pack slightly more into a cup, so weighing gives the most accurate result for recipes."
faqQ2: "How does hot sauce affect air fryer cooking times?"
faqA2: "Hot sauce can slightly reduce cooking time as its acidity helps tenderise proteins. However, sugary sauces may caramelise faster, so check food a few minutes early to prevent burning. Always adjust times based on your air fryer model and sauce thickness."
faqQ3: "What if my recipe uses grams instead of ounces?"
faqA3: "3 ounces equals approximately 85 grams. Most kitchen scales toggle between units, making conversions simple. For more metric conversions, visit our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a> to streamline international recipes."
faqQ4: "Can I substitute fresh chillies for 0.375 cup hot sauce?"
faqA4: "Yes, but adjust for heat levels. About 2-3 blended fresh chillies equal 3 oz of mild hot sauce. Remove seeds to reduce spiciness. Always taste-test before adding to your air fryer dish, as fresh peppers vary in potency."

faqQ1: "Can I use a measuring cup instead of a scale for miso soup?"
faqA1: "Yes, a standard UK measuring cup works for miso soup, but a kitchen scale is more accurate. Miso soup's consistency can vary, so weighing ensures precision, especially for air fryer recipes where balance matters."
faqQ2: "Does the type of miso soup affect the weight per cup?"
faqA2: "Yes, thicker miso soups (like red miso) may weigh slightly more per cup than lighter varieties (white miso). For air fryer cooking, stick to the 8.45 oz standard unless the recipe specifies otherwise."
faqQ3: "How do I convert ounces back to cups for miso soup?"
faqA3: "Divide the ounce measurement by 8.45 to get the cup equivalent. For example, 16.9 oz of miso soup equals roughly 2 cups. This is handy when scaling air fryer recipes up or down."
faqQ4: "Why is measuring miso soup important for air fryer cooking?"
faqA4: "Precise measurements ensure even cooking and flavour balance in air fryer dishes. Too much miso soup can make food overly salty, while too little may lack depth. Accurate ounces per cup help perfect recipes."

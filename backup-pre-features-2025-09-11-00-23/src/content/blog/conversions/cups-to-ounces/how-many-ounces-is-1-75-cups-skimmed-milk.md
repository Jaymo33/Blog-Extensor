faqQ1: "Can I use whole milk instead of skimmed milk for 1.75 cups in an air fryer recipe?"
faqA1: "Yes, you can substitute whole milk for skimmed milk when measuring 1.75 cups (14 ounces). However, whole milk has a higher fat content, which may slightly alter the texture of your dish. For best results, stick to the recipe's recommendation unless you're comfortable with minor adjustments."
faqQ2: "How do I measure 1.75 cups of skimmed milk without a liquid measuring cup?"
faqA2: "If you don’t have a liquid measuring cup, you can use standard metric measurements. 1.75 cups equals roughly 414 millilitres. Alternatively, measure 1 cup plus 3/4 cup using dry measuring spoons, though this may be less precise. For accuracy, investing in a liquid measuring cup is ideal."
faqQ3: "Does skimmed milk weigh the same as other types of milk in ounces?"
faqA3: "Skimmed, semi-skimmed, and whole milk all weigh roughly the same per cup—about 8 ounces. The difference lies in fat content, not volume or weight. So, 1.75 cups of any milk type will still be approximately 14 ounces, though textures and flavours may vary."
faqQ4: "Can I freeze skimmed milk if I have leftover 1.75 cups?"
faqA4: "Yes, you can freeze skimmed milk if you have leftover 1.75 cups. Pour it into an airtight container, leaving room for expansion. Thaw in the fridge before using, and shake well to recombine any separation. Frozen milk works best in cooked dishes rather than drinking."

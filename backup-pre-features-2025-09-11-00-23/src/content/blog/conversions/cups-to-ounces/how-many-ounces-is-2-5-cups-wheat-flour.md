faqQ1: "Can I use 2.5 cups of wheat flour in gluten-free air fryer recipes?"
faqA1: "Yes, but gluten-free flours have different densities. While 2.5 cups of all-purpose wheat flour equals 10.6 oz, gluten-free blends may weigh slightly less. Always check the packaging or use a kitchen scale for accuracy."
faqQ2: "How do I convert 2.5 cups of wheat flour to grams?"

At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we focus on accuracy to help you achieve perfect results every time.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Flour Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Using the correct amount of wheat flour is crucial, especially in air fryer cooking. Too much flour can make baked goods dense, while too little may cause them to crumble. For air fryer recipes like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>cakes or cookies</a>, 2.5 cups of wheat flour (10.6 oz) ensures the right texture. Measuring by weight rather than volume eliminates guesswork, giving you reliable results.</p>  

<p>Different types of flour have varying densities, so weighing ensures consistency. For example, whole wheat flour is heavier than all-purpose flour, but 2.5 cups still converts to roughly 10.6 ounces. If you're adapting a traditional recipe for your air fryer, always check the flour weight.

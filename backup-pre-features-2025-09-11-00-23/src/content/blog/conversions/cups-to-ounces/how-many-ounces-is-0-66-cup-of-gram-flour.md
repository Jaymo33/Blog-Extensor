faqQ1: "How do I convert 0.66 cup of gram flour to ounces without scales?"
faqA1: "Use the spoon-and-level method: lightly spoon gram flour into a measuring cup until it's heaped, then level it off with a knife. This ensures accuracy close to weighing scales. For 0.66 cup, aim for roughly 2.64 ounces (oz) in UK measurements."

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on even heat distribution, and incorrect flour quantities can lead to uneven cooking. Too much gram flour may result in dry, crumbly dishes, while too little can leave food undercooked. Measuring 0.66 cup of gram flour in ounces ensures consistency, especially for recipes like onion bhajis or savoury pancakes. If you're experimenting with gluten-free baking, precise weights are even more critical. Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a> for inspiration.</p>  

<p>Gram flour is denser than wheat flour, so volume-to-weight conversions aren't always straightforward. A standard UK cup holds about 4 ounces of gram flour, meaning 0.66 cup equates to roughly 2.64 ounces. This small but important detail can elevate your air fryer dishes from good to great. For those who love crispy, golden results, weighing ingredients is a game-changer.

<h3>How to measure gram flour without scales</h3>  
<p>If you don't have kitchen scales, use the spoon-and-level method for accuracy. Lightly spoon gram flour into a measuring cup until it's heaped, then level it off with a knife. This avoids compacting the flour, which could skew your 0.66 cup measurement. For air fryer batters, consistency is key—too thick or thin, and your dish won't crisp up properly.

<h2>Common uses for gram flour in air fryers</h2>  
<p>Gram flour is a versatile ingredient, perfect for coating vegetables, fish, or tofu before air frying. Its high protein content creates a crispier texture than wheat flour, making it ideal for gluten-free diets. Measuring 0.66 cup of gram flour in ounces ensures your batter adheres evenly without clumping. Popular dishes include crispy okra, spiced chickpea bites, and even air-fried falafel.

<h3>Tips for storing gram flour</h3>  
<p>Keep gram flour in an airtight container to prevent moisture absorption, which can affect weight measurements. If stored properly, it stays fresh for months, ready for your next 0.66 cup to ounces conversion. For bulk buyers, dividing flour into smaller portions ensures accuracy when measuring. Always check for a nutty aroma—if it smells musty, it's time to replace it. Proper storage means your air fryer creations will always taste their best.</p>

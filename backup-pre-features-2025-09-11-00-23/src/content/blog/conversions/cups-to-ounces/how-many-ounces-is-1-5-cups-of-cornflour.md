<p>1.5 cups of cornflour equals approximately 6.35 ounces (oz) in the UK. This measurement is essential for precision in baking, especially when using an air fryer where ingredient ratios can make or break a recipe. Whether you’re whipping up crispy coatings or light batters, knowing this conversion ensures consistency. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we focus on helping you get the most out of your air fryer with accurate measurements and foolproof techniques.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate cornflour measurements matter</h2>  
<p>Cornflour is a staple in many air fryer recipes, from crispy chicken coatings to delicate sponges. Using the wrong amount can lead to dense, soggy, or overly dry results. For example, 1.5 cups of cornflour to ounces is a common query because many UK recipes use weight measurements for precision. Unlike volume measurements, weight ensures you’re adding the exact amount needed, regardless of how tightly packed the flour is. This is particularly important for air fryer cooking, where even distribution and texture are key.</p>  

<p>If you’re converting 1.5 cups of cornflour to oz, remember that slight variations can occur based on how you scoop the flour. For the most accurate results, we recommend using a kitchen scale. However, if you don’t have one, our conversion guide will help you approximate the correct amount.

<h3>How to measure cornflour without a scale</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a kitchen scale, spoon the cornflour into your measuring cup and level it off with a knife. Avoid packing it down, as this can lead to using more flour than intended. For 1.5 cups of cornflour in ounces, this method should give you close to the 6.35 oz mark. Keep in mind that humidity and storage conditions can affect the density of cornflour, so adjustments might be needed for perfect results.</p>

faqQ1: "Can I use double cream instead of single cream in air fryer recipes?"
faqA1: "Yes, but double cream has a higher fat content (around 48%) compared to single cream (18%). This means it’s thicker and richer, so you might need to adjust the quantity or dilute it slightly with milk. For best results, stick to the recipe’s recommended cream type."
faqQ2: "How do I store leftover single cream after measuring 3 cups?"
faqA2: "Store leftover single cream in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 3 days. Shake or stir it before using, as it may separate slightly. For longer storage, freeze it in ice cube trays and thaw as needed for cooking."
faqQ3: "Why does my air fryer recipe turn out watery with single cream?"
faqA3: "This can happen if the cream isn’t reduced properly or if too much liquid is added. To thicken sauces, let them simmer in the air fryer for a few extra minutes or add a cornflour slurry (1 tsp cornflour mixed with 1 tbsp water)."
faqQ4: "Is there a non-dairy substitute for single cream in air fryer recipes?"
faqA4: "Yes, coconut cream or oat cream works well as a dairy-free alternative. Keep in mind that the flavour and texture may vary slightly, so adjust seasonings accordingly. For specific substitutions, check our vegan recipe collection."

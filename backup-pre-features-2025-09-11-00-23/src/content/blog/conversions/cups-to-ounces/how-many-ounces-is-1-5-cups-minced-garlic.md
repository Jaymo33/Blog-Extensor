faqQ1: "Can I use jarred minced garlic instead of fresh for the 1.5 cup measurement?"
faqA1: "Yes, you can use jarred minced garlic as a substitute. The 1.5 cups to 12 ounces conversion works for both fresh and jarred varieties. However, jarred garlic might have a slightly different flavour profile due to preservatives, so you may want to adjust other seasonings accordingly in your air fryer recipes."
faqQ2: "How does the 1.5 cups minced garlic to ounces conversion affect cooking times in the air fryer?"
faqA2: "The quantity of garlic (12 ounces from 1.5 cups) doesn't significantly affect cooking times unless it's the main ingredient. When mixed with other foods in the air fryer, the garlic will cook at the same rate as the other components. For garlic-heavy dishes, you might reduce temperature slightly to prevent burning."
faqQ3: "Is there a difference in ounces between finely minced and roughly chopped garlic?"
faqA3: "While 1.5 cups of any minced garlic equals about 12 ounces, the texture does affect volume. Finely minced garlic packs more tightly, so you might get slightly more weight per cup compared to roughly chopped. For absolute precision in air fryer recipes, weighing your garlic is always best."
faqQ4: "How can I measure 1.5 cups of minced garlic without making a mess?"
faqA4: "Use a large measuring cup and lightly spoon in the minced garlic without packing it down. For easier handling, you can measure ½ cup three times. Wiping the measuring cup with a bit of oil first can prevent sticky garlic from clinging to the sides, making your air fryer meal prep cleaner and more efficient."

<h3>The science behind garlic measurements</h3>
<p>Garlic's density can vary based on how finely it's minced and how fresh it is. This is why 1.5 cups of minced garlic equals about 12 ounces rather than a fixed weight. Freshly minced garlic tends to be more compact than pre-minced jarred varieties, which might contain more liquid.</p>

<h2>Common uses for 1.5 cups of minced garlic</h2>
<p>Now that you know 1.5 cups of minced garlic is approximately 12 ounces, you might wonder what dishes require this quantity. Large batches of garlic bread, marinades for family meals, or bulk cooking for meal prep often call for these amounts. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable recipes</a> section features several dishes that benefit from generous garlic portions.</p>
<p>When working with such quantities in your air fryer, remember that garlic can burn quickly at high temperatures.

<h3>Storing leftover minced garlic</h3>
<p>If your recipe doesn't use all 12 ounces (1.5 cups) of minced garlic, proper storage is key. Transfer leftovers to an airtight container and refrigerate for up to two weeks. You can also freeze minced garlic in ice cube trays for convenient portioning in future air fryer recipes.</p>

<h2>Converting between fresh and pre-minced garlic</h2>
<p>When recipes call for fresh garlic cloves but you're using pre-minced, knowing that 1.5 cups equals about 12 ounces helps with substitutions. Generally, one medium garlic clove yields about ½ teaspoon of minced garlic, so 1.5 cups would be equivalent to roughly 144 cloves - a useful conversion for large-scale cooking.</p>

<h2>Why accurate cinnamon measurements matter</h2>

For sweet treats like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>cakes</a> or cookies, precision ensures balanced sweetness. Similarly, savoury dishes like spiced meats benefit from just the right amount.</p>  

<p>Using a kitchen scale for ground cinnamon is ideal, but if you're working with cups, our conversion ensures accuracy.

faqQ1: "Can I use liquid milk instead of powdered milk in air fryer recipes?"
faqA1: "Yes, but you'll need to adjust the recipe. Liquid milk adds moisture, which can affect crispiness. Replace 1.25 cups of powdered milk with 1 cup of liquid milk and reduce other liquids slightly."
faqQ2: "Does the brand of powdered milk affect the weight per cup?"
faqA2: "Most brands are similar, but always check the packaging for exact measurements. Some may be denser, so weighing (3.5 oz for 1.25 cups) is more reliable than volume."
faqQ3: "How long does powdered milk last once opened?"
faqA3: "Stored properly, it lasts 6–12 months. Keep it sealed and away from humidity to maintain freshness for air fryer recipes."
faqQ4: "Can I make a larger batch of powdered milk mix for future use?"
faqA4: "Absolutely! Mix 1.25 cups (3.5 oz) with dry ingredients and store in an airtight container. Add water when ready to use. Great for meal prep!"

<p>1.25 cups of powdered milk equals approximately 3.5 ounces (or 3.5 oz). This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements ensure the best results. Whether you're making a creamy sauce or baking a cake in your air fryer, knowing the exact weight of powdered milk helps maintain consistency.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>

Too much or too little powdered milk can affect texture and taste, especially in recipes like air fryer cheesecakes or breaded coatings.

<h3>How to measure powdered milk correctly</h3>  
<p>Always spoon powdered milk into a measuring cup and level it off with a knife for accuracy. Scooping directly from the bag can compact the powder, leading to incorrect measurements. This method ensures you get the right amount—3.5 ounces for 1.25 cups—every time.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for powdered milk in air fryer recipes</h2>  
<p>Powdered milk is often used in air fryer baking, such as cakes, bread, and coatings for fried foods. It adds richness without the moisture of liquid milk, which can affect crispiness.

<h3>Converting other powdered milk quantities</h3>  
<p>If your recipe calls for a different amount, here's a quick reference: 1 cup of powdered milk equals 2.8 ounces, while 2 cups equal 5.6 ounces. This makes scaling recipes straightforward, whether you're cooking for one or a crowd.</p>  

<h2>Tips for storing powdered milk</h2>

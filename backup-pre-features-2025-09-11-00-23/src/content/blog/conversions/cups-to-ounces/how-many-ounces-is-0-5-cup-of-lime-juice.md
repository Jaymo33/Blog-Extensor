faqQ1: "Can I use bottled lime juice instead of fresh for 0.5 cup measurements?"
faqA1: "Yes, you can use bottled lime juice as a substitute for fresh when measuring 0.5 cup (4 oz). The volume measurement remains the same, though fresh lime juice often has a brighter, more vibrant flavour. For best results in air fryer recipes, choose 100% lime juice without added preservatives or sweeteners."
faqQ2: "How many limes do I need for 0.5 cup of juice?"
faqA2: "You’ll typically need 4-5 medium limes to get 0.5 cup (4 oz) of juice. Lime size and juiciness can vary, so it’s good to have an extra lime or two on hand. Rolling limes on the counter before juicing and using a citrus juicer can help extract maximum juice from each fruit."
faqQ3: "Does 0.5 cup of lime juice weigh the same as 0.5 cup of water?"
faqA3: "No, 0.5 cup of lime juice weighs slightly more than water due to its density and dissolved solids. While 0.5 cup of water weighs about 4 oz (by volume), lime juice weighs approximately 4.2 oz by weight. For most air fryer recipes, this small difference won’t affect the outcome."
faqQ4: "Can I freeze 0.5 cup portions of lime juice for later use?"
faqA4: "Absolutely! Freezing 0.5 cup (4 oz) portions of lime juice is a great way to always have some on hand. Use small freezer-safe containers or ice cube trays (each cube is about 1 oz). Thaw in the refrigerator before use, and give it a good stir as separation may occur during freezing."

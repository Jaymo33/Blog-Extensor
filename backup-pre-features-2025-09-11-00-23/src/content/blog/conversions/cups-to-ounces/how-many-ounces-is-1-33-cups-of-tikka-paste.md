faqQ1: "Can I use grams instead of ounces for tikka paste measurements?"

faqA3: "Most tikka pastes last 4–6 weeks refrigerated. Always check the label, and store it in an airtight container. If you’ve measured out 1.33 cups (10.64 oz) for a recipe, freeze any excess in ice cube trays for future use."
faqQ4: "Can I substitute tikka paste with tikka powder in air fryer recipes?"
faqA4: "Yes, but adjust the quantities. Use 1 tablespoon of tikka powder per 1.33 cups of paste called for, and mix it with oil or yogurt. The texture will differ, so add liquid gradually to avoid dryness in your air fryer dish."

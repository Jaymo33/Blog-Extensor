faqQ1: "Can I use uncooked rice measurements instead of cooked for this conversion?"
faqA1: "No, uncooked rice expands when cooked, so the weight and volume change significantly. Always measure cooked rice separately for accuracy. For example, 0.66 cup of uncooked rice yields about 2 cups cooked, which weighs around 16 ounces."
faqQ2: "How does the type of rice affect the ounce measurement for 0.66 cup?"
faqA2: "Different rice varieties have slight density variations. For instance, 0.66 cup of sticky rice might weigh closer to 5.5 ounces, while basmati could be 5 ounces. However, 5.28 ounces is a reliable average for most types."
faqQ3: "Why is my 0.66 cup of cooked rice not weighing exactly 5.28 ounces?"
faqA3: "Small discrepancies can occur due to moisture content or packing density. If your rice is very wet or tightly packed, it may weigh slightly more. Fluffing it lightly before measuring helps standardize the weight."
faqQ4: "Can I freeze 0.66 cup (5.28 oz) portions of cooked rice for later use?"
faqA4: "Absolutely! Portioning 0.66 cup servings into freezer bags makes meal prep easy. Reheat frozen rice in the air fryer at 160°C for 4-5 minutes, stirring halfway. This method preserves texture better than microwaving."

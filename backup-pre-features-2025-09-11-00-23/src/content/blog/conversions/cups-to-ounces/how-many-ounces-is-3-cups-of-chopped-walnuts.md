<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Precision is key when using an air fryer, as even small variations can affect cooking times and results. Chopped walnuts, for instance, can vary in density depending on how finely they’re chopped. Measuring by weight (ounces) rather than volume (cups) ensures accuracy. This is especially important for recipes like walnut-crusted chicken or air-fried desserts, where texture and balance are crucial.

<p>Using a kitchen scale is the best way to measure chopped walnuts, but if you don’t have one, our conversion guide will help. For example, 3 cups of chopped walnuts to ounces is roughly 12 oz, but packing density can slightly alter this. Lightly packed walnuts may weigh less, while tightly packed ones could be heavier. Always fluff the walnuts with a fork before measuring for consistency.</p>  

<h3>How to measure chopped walnuts without a scale</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a kitchen scale, use the spoon-and-level method for measuring chopped walnuts. Gently spoon the walnuts into a measuring cup without packing them down, then level off the top with a knife. This method helps avoid over-measuring, which can throw off your recipe.

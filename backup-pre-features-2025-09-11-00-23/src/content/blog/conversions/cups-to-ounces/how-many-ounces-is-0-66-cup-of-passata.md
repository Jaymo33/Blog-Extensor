faqQ1: "Can I use chopped tomatoes instead of passata in my air fryer recipe?"
faqA1: "Yes, you can substitute chopped tomatoes for passata, but the texture and consistency will differ. Passata is smoother and thicker, so you may need to blend or cook down chopped tomatoes to achieve a similar result. Adjust the quantity slightly, as chopped tomatoes tend to be more watery."
faqQ2: "How do I measure 0.66 cup of passata without a measuring cup?"
faqA2: "If you don’t have a measuring cup, you can use a kitchen scale to weigh out 5.28 ounces of passata. Alternatively, fill a standard cup about two-thirds full, as 0.66 cup is roughly two-thirds of a standard 8-ounce cup."
faqQ3: "Does the brand of passata affect the weight per cup?"
faqA3: "Different brands may have slight variations in thickness, but the weight per cup is generally consistent. Always check the label for specific weight measurements if precision is crucial for your recipe."
faqQ4: "Can I freeze passata after measuring out 0.66 cup?"
faqA4: "Absolutely! Passata freezes well and can be stored for up to three months. Portion it into freezer-safe containers or bags for easy use in future recipes. Thaw in the fridge before using."

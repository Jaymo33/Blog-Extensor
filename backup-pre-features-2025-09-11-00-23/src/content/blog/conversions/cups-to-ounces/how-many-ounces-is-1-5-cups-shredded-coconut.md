faqQ1: "Can I use desiccated coconut instead of shredded coconut in air fryer recipes?"
faqA1: "Yes, you can substitute desiccated coconut for shredded coconut, but the texture will be finer. Use the same weight (4.5 oz for 1.5 cups), but note that desiccated coconut may cook faster due to its smaller size. Adjust cooking times accordingly to avoid burning."
faqQ2: "How do I prevent shredded coconut from burning in the air fryer?"
faqA2: "To prevent burning, lightly spray the shredded coconut with oil and cook at a lower temperature (around 160°C). Stir or shake the basket halfway through cooking for even browning. Keeping an eye on it during the last few minutes is key, as coconut can go from golden to burnt quickly."
faqQ3: "Is shredded coconut the same as coconut flakes?"
faqA3: "No, shredded coconut is finer and more uniform, while coconut flakes are larger and thicker. If substituting, 1.5 cups of shredded coconut (4.5 oz) equals roughly 1 cup of flakes by volume, but the texture will differ. Adjust cooking times as flakes may take longer to crisp up."
faqQ4: "Can I freeze shredded coconut for later use?"
faqA4: "Absolutely! Freeze shredded coconut in an airtight container or resealable bag for up to 6 months. Thaw it at room temperature before using. Measure out 1.5 cups (4.5 oz) as needed for recipes—freezing doesn’t affect the weight or volume."

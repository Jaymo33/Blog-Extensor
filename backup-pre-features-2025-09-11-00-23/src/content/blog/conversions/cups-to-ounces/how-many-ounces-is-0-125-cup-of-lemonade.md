faqQ1: "Is 0.125 cup of lemonade the same as 1 ounce?"
faqA1: "Yes, in UK measurements, 0.125 cup of lemonade equals exactly 1 fluid ounce. This conversion is standard for liquids and is especially useful for air fryer recipes where precision matters."
faqQ2: "Can I use a kitchen scale to measure 0.125 cup of lemonade?"

faqA3: "If your recipe calls for a different amount, use the 1-ounce equivalent of 0.125 cup as a base. For example, 0.25 cup would be 2 ounces, and 0.5 cup would be 4 ounces. This scaling ensures consistency in your air fryer dishes."
faqQ4: "Does the type of lemonade affect the conversion?"
faqA4: "The conversion applies to all liquid lemonade, whether homemade, store-bought, or concentrate. However, concentrate is more potent, so adjust other ingredients accordingly. Always measure liquids by volume for the best results in air fryer cooking."

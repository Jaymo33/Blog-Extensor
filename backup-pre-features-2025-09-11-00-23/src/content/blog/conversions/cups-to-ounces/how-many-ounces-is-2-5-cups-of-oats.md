faqQ1: "Can I use quick oats instead of rolled oats for the same weight?"
faqA1: "Yes, quick oats and rolled oats have similar weights, so 2.5 cups of quick oats will also be around 10 ounces. However, quick oats absorb liquid faster, which may affect cooking times in recipes. Adjust accordingly if substituting."
faqQ2: "How do I convert 2.5 cups of oats to grams?"
faqA2: "Since 1 ounce is approximately 28.35 grams, 10 ounces of oats (2.5 cups) equals about 283.5 grams. For precise baking or air fryer recipes, using a kitchen scale is recommended for accuracy."
faqQ3: "Does the brand of oats affect the weight per cup?"
faqA3: "Slight variations can occur between brands due to processing differences, but generally, 1 cup of oats weighs around 4 ounces. For consistency, stick to one brand when measuring for recipes."
faqQ4: "Can I use this conversion for steel-cut oats?"
faqA4: "Steel-cut oats are denser, so 2.5 cups will weigh slightly more—about 11-12 ounces. Adjust measurements if your recipe specifies steel-cut oats to avoid discrepancies in texture or cooking time."

faqQ1: "Can I use single cream instead of double cream in air fryer recipes?"
faqA1: "Yes, you can substitute single cream, but it has a lower fat content (around 18% compared to double cream’s 48%). This may affect the richness and texture of your dish. If using single cream, you might need to adjust cooking times slightly, as it’s less stable under heat."
faqQ2: "How do I convert ounces to grams for double cream?"
faqA2: "To convert ounces to grams, multiply the number of ounces by 28.35. For example, 13.28 ounces of double cream equals approximately 376 grams. This is handy if your recipe uses metric measurements or if you’re using a scale that displays grams."
faqQ3: "Why does my double cream sometimes curdle in the air fryer?"
faqA3: "Double cream can curdle if exposed to too high a temperature or if it’s heated too quickly. To prevent this, warm it gently or mix it with other ingredients before air frying. Also, ensure your air fryer isn’t overcrowded, as uneven heat distribution can cause issues."
faqQ4: "Where can I find more air fryer recipes using double cream?"

faqQ1: "Can I use dried beans instead of canned beans in air fryer recipes?"
faqA1: "Yes, you can use dried beans, but they require soaking and cooking before air frying. Replace 0.33 cup of canned beans with about 0.11 cup of dried beans, which expands when cooked. Remember to adjust cooking times as dried beans take longer to prepare."
faqQ2: "How do I store leftover canned beans after measuring 0.33 cup?"
faqA2: "Transfer unused canned beans to an airtight container and refrigerate for up to 3 days. For longer storage, freeze them in portions matching your typical measurements, like 0.33 cup (2.64 oz) servings. Thaw in the fridge before using in your next air fryer recipe."
faqQ3: "Do different types of canned beans weigh the same per 0.33 cup?"
faqA3: "Most canned beans weigh similarly, with slight variations. For example, 0.33 cup of chickpeas might be slightly heavier than black beans due to density. When precision matters, weigh your beans rather than relying solely on cup measurements."
faqQ4: "Why is my air fryer recipe using 0.33 cup of beans turning out dry?"
faqA4: "This could happen if the beans aren't properly coated with oil or if your air fryer runs hot. Try reducing the temperature by 10Â°C and cooking for less time. Also ensure your 0.33 cup (2.64 oz) measurement is accurate - too few beans will dry out faster."

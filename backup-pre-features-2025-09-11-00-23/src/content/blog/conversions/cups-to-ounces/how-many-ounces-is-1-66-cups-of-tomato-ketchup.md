faqQ1: "Can I use 1.66 cups of tomato ketchup in any air fryer?"
faqA1: "Yes, 13.28 ounces (1.66 cups) of tomato ketchup works in all air fryer models. Just ensure it’s used as a marinade or glaze rather than cooked alone, as ketchup can burn at high temperatures. Spread it evenly for best results."
faqQ2: "How does UK tomato ketchup differ in weight from US versions?"

faqQ3: "What’s the best way to store leftover tomato ketchup after measuring 1.66 cups?"

faqQ4: "Are there low-sugar alternatives to tomato ketchup that measure the same?"
faqA4: "Sugar-free ketchups have similar density, so 1.66 cups still equals about 13.28 ounces. For thinner options like passata, reduce the amount slightly or thicken with tomato paste to match the consistency."

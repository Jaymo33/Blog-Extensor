faqQ1: "How do I measure 3 cups of Nutella if I don’t have a measuring cup?"
faqA1: "You can use a kitchen scale to weigh out 24 ounces (680 grams) of Nutella instead. If you don’t have a scale, the water displacement method works—fill a container with water, add Nutella until the water level rises by 3 cups, then drain the water."
faqQ2: "Does Nutella weigh the same in ounces when melted?"
faqA2: "Yes, Nutella’s weight remains roughly 24 ounces for 3 cups whether solid or melted. However, melted Nutella is easier to pour, so it’s best to measure it in its original state for accuracy."
faqQ3: "Can I use 3 cups of Nutella in an air fryer without making a mess?"
faqA3: "Yes, but ensure your air fryer recipes are designed for sticky ingredients like Nutella. Use parchment liners or silicone molds to prevent spills. Clean your air fryer basket promptly to avoid residue buildup."
faqQ4: "Is 3 cups of Nutella the same in UK and US measurements?"
faqA4: "Yes, 3 cups of Nutella equals 24 ounces in both UK and US measurements. However, UK recipes may list it as 680 grams, so a kitchen scale can help avoid confusion."

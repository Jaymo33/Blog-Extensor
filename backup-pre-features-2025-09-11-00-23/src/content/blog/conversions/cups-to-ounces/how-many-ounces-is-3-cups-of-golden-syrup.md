faqQ1: "Can I use honey instead of golden syrup in air fryer recipes?"
faqA1: "Yes, but honey has a stronger flavour and thinner consistency, which may affect the outcome. Use a 1:1 ratio, but expect a slightly different taste and texture. Golden syrup’s buttery notes are unique, so substitutions work best in recipes where flavour isn’t the main focus."
faqQ2: "How do I clean golden syrup from my air fryer basket?"
faqA2: "Mix warm water with a mild detergent or use our recommended <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner</a>. Soak the basket briefly, then scrub gently with a non-abrasive sponge. Avoid harsh chemicals, as they can damage the non-stick coating."
faqQ3: "Why is measuring golden syrup by weight better than by volume?"
faqA3: "Weight (ounces) is more accurate because golden syrup’s thickness causes it to settle unevenly in cups. A kitchen scale ensures consistency, especially for recipes requiring precise ratios, like glazes or sauces."
faqQ4: "What’s the best way to store golden syrup for air fryer recipes?"
faqA4: "Keep it in an airtight container at room temperature, away from direct sunlight. If crystallised, warm the jar in hot water to restore smoothness. Proper storage ensures it’s ready for your next air fryer creation."

<p>3 cups of golden syrup equals approximately 36 ounces. This conversion is essential for precise measurements in baking and air fryer recipes, ensuring your dishes turn out perfectly every time.

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter</h2>  
<p>Golden syrup’s viscosity means even small measurement errors can affect your recipe’s outcome. Too much syrup can make desserts overly sweet or sauces too thick, while too little might leave dishes lacking flavour. Air fryer recipes, like glazed chicken or baked goods, rely on precise ratios for even cooking. Using 36 ounces (or 3 cups) ensures consistency, whether you’re scaling up or down.

<p>Measuring by weight (ounces) is often more reliable than volume (cups), especially for sticky ingredients like golden syrup. A kitchen scale eliminates discrepancies caused by how the syrup settles in a cup. If you don’t have one, spoon the syrup into a measuring cup and level it off for the closest approximation. Remember, 3 cups of golden syrup to ounces is a fixed ratio, but always double-check if adapting recipes.</p>  

<h2>Converting golden syrup for air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Many air fryer recipes call for golden syrup as a glaze or sweetener, from crispy bacon to roasted vegetables. Knowing that 3 cups equal 36 ounces helps you adjust quantities without compromising texture or taste. For example, a marinade might require ½ cup (6 ounces) of syrup—easy to calculate once you know the base conversion. Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipes</a> for inspiration on using golden syrup in savoury dishes.</p>  

<h3>Tips for measuring golden syrup</h3>  
<p>To avoid mess, lightly grease your measuring cup or spoon before adding golden syrup—it’ll slide out effortlessly. Warm the syrup slightly if it’s too thick to pour, but don’t overheat it, as this can alter its properties. For sticky residues, clean your air fryer basket promptly with our recommended <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner</a>. Proper tools and techniques make working with golden syrup a breeze.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for golden syrup in air fryers</h2>  
<p>Golden syrup isn’t just for desserts; it’s a versatile ingredient in air fryer cooking. Use it to glaze sausages, caramelise nuts, or add shine to pastries. Since 3 cups of golden syrup to oz is 36, you can easily halve or double amounts for different batch sizes. Try drizzling it over <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>air fryer desserts</a> like baked apples or banana fritters for a touch of sweetness. Its high sugar content also helps achieve a crispy finish on meats.</p>  

<p>When substituting golden syrup in recipes, note that its flavour is distinct from honey or maple syrup. Its buttery, caramel-like taste pairs well with both sweet and savoury dishes. If a recipe specifies 3 cups (36 ounces), stick to golden syrup unless alternatives are suggested.

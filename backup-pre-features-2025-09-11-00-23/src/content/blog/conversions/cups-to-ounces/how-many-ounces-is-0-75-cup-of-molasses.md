faqQ1: "Can I use blackstrap molasses instead of regular molasses in air fryer recipes?"
faqA1: "Yes, but blackstrap molasses has a stronger, more bitter flavour than regular molasses. It’s best used in small quantities or in savoury dishes like marinades. For baking, stick with lighter molasses unless the recipe specifically calls for blackstrap."
faqQ2: "How do I store molasses to keep it fresh?"
faqA2: "Store molasses in a cool, dark place like a pantry. Once opened, it can last up to a year if sealed tightly. Refrigeration isn’t necessary but can help prevent crystallisation in humid climates."
faqQ3: "Can I substitute honey or maple syrup for molasses in air fryer recipes?"
faqA3: "Yes, but the flavour and texture will differ. Honey is sweeter and thinner, while maple syrup has a distinct taste. Use a 1:1 ratio, but expect slight variations in the final dish."
faqQ4: "Why does my molasses measurement seem off when using cups?"
faqA4: "Molasses is dense and sticky, so it’s easy to under- or over-measure. Always use a liquid measuring cup and level it off with a spatula. For precision, weigh it—9 ounces for 0.75 cup is the most accurate."

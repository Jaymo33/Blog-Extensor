faqQ1: "Can I use frozen diced peppers instead of fresh for 0.375 cup measurements?"
faqA1: "Yes, frozen diced peppers can be used, but they may release more water during cooking. For 0.375 cup (3 ounces), thaw and drain them first to avoid soggy results. Fresh peppers are ideal for crispier textures in the air fryer."
faqQ2: "How do I store leftover diced peppers after measuring 0.375 cup?"
faqA2: "Store unused diced peppers in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 3 days. For longer storage, freeze them in 0.375 cup (3-ounce) portions. This makes future meal prep quick and easy."
faqQ3: "Does the type of pepper affect the weight of 0.375 cup?"
faqA3: "Slightly—bell peppers are less dense than chillies, so 0.375 cup may weigh closer to 2.5 ounces for chillies. For accuracy, always weigh your diced peppers if the recipe calls for ounces."
faqQ4: "Can I substitute jarred diced peppers for fresh in air fryer recipes?"
faqA4: "Jarred peppers work in a pinch, but they’re often softer and saltier. Rinse and pat them dry before using 0.375 cup (3 ounces) to reduce excess moisture and sodium in your dish."

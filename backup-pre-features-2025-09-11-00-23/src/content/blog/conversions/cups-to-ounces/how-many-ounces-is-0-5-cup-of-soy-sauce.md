faqQ1: "How do I measure 0.5 cup of soy sauce without a measuring cup?"
faqA1: "If you don’t have a measuring cup, you can use a kitchen scale to weigh out 4.23 oz of soy sauce, which is equivalent to 0.5 cup. Alternatively, a standard UK tablespoon holds about 0.5 oz, so roughly 8.5 tablespoons would give you the same amount."
faqQ2: "Does the brand of soy sauce affect the weight per cup?"
faqA2: "Most soy sauces have a similar density, so the weight per cup (around 8.45 oz) remains fairly consistent across brands. However, low-sodium or thick varieties might vary slightly. For best results, weigh your soy sauce if precision is crucial."
faqQ3: "Can I use this conversion for other liquids in air fryer recipes?"
faqA3: "This conversion applies specifically to soy sauce, as different liquids have varying densities. For example, water weighs about 8 oz per cup, while oil is closer to 7.7 oz. Always check a reliable conversion chart for other ingredients."
faqQ4: "Why is my air fryer dish too salty even with 0.5 cup of soy sauce?"
faqA4: "Soy sauce is naturally high in sodium, so even 0.5 cup (4.23 oz) can be overpowering if not balanced with other flavours. Try reducing the amount slightly or diluting it with water, vinegar, or citrus juice to tone down the saltiness."

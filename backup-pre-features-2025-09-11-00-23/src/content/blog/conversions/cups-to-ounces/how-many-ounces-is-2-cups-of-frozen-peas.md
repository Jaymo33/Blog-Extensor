faqQ1: "Can I use thawed peas instead of frozen in the air fryer?"

faqA2: "2 cups of frozen peas weigh approximately 283 grams. This conversion is useful for recipes requiring metric measurements. Always use a kitchen scale for the most accurate results."

<h2>Why measure frozen peas in ounces?</h2>  
<p>Measuring frozen peas by weight (ounces) rather than volume (cups) ensures consistency in your air fryer recipes. Volume measurements can vary based on how tightly peas are packed, but weight remains precise. This is especially important for air frying, where even cooking relies on uniform ingredient sizes. If you're prepping a batch of <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable-based dishes</a>, accurate measurements make all the difference.</p>  

<p>Frozen peas are a staple in many kitchens due to their convenience and nutritional value. They retain most of their vitamins and cook quickly in the air fryer, making them ideal for busy weeknights. By knowing that 2 cups equal roughly 10 ounces, you can easily scale recipes up or down.

<h3>How to measure frozen peas accurately</h3>  
<p>For the most precise measurement, use a kitchen scale to weigh your frozen peas directly in ounces. If you don't have a scale, lightly fill a measuring cup without packing the peas down. Avoid thawing them first, as this can alter the weight and texture. Keeping peas frozen ensures they cook evenly in the air fryer, whether you're roasting or adding them to a stir-fry.</p>  

<h2>Tips for cooking frozen peas in the air fryer</h2>  
<p>Frozen peas cook beautifully in the air fryer, retaining their vibrant colour and crisp-tender texture. Preheat your air fryer to 180°C (350°F) and spread the peas in a single layer for even cooking. A light spray of oil and a pinch of salt enhance their natural sweetness.

<h2>Why Measuring Milk Correctly Matters in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>
<p>Air fryers rely on circulating hot air to cook food evenly, and liquid ratios play a big role. Whether you're making a batter for <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>cakes</a> or a marinade for chicken, 1 cup of milk in ounces must be spot-on. Even a small deviation can affect texture and cooking time.</p>
<p>For example, if a recipe calls for 1 cup of milk (8.45 oz) and you accidentally use 8 oz, your batter might be thicker than intended. This could lead to uneven cooking or a denser final product. Always double-check your measurements to avoid these pitfalls.</p>

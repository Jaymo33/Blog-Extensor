faqQ1: "Can I use milk instead of cream if I don’t have 0.375 cup of cream?"
faqA1: "Yes, but the texture and richness will differ. Milk has less fat than cream, so your dish might be lighter or less creamy. For baking, you can add a tablespoon of butter per cup of milk to mimic cream’s fat content. However, for sauces or whipped toppings, the substitution may not work as well."
faqQ2: "How do I convert 0.375 cup of cream to grams?"
faqA2: "0.375 cup of cream is approximately 85 grams. This conversion is useful if you’re using a kitchen scale or following a metric recipe. Keep in mind that the exact weight can vary slightly depending on the cream’s fat content, but 85g is a reliable standard for most cooking and baking purposes."
faqQ3: "Is 0.375 cup of cream the same as 3/8 cup?"
faqA3: "Yes, 0.375 cup and 3/8 cup are the same measurement. Both represent three-eighths of a standard cup, which equals 3 fluid ounces or 6 tablespoons. This measurement is often used in smaller recipes or when halving larger quantities."
faqQ4: "Can I use whipped cream instead of liquid cream in a recipe calling for 0.375 cup?"
faqA4: "It depends on the recipe. Whipped cream has air incorporated, so it’s less dense than liquid cream. For baking, it’s best to use liquid cream unless the recipe specifies otherwise. For toppings or no-bake desserts, whipped cream can work, but adjust the quantity slightly to account for the air volume."

<p>0.375 cup of cream equals 3 ounces (oz). This conversion is essential for precise measurements in cooking and baking, especially when using an air fryer. Whether you’re whipping up a creamy dessert or a savoury sauce, knowing the exact weight ensures consistency. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we focus on helping you achieve perfect results with accurate conversions like this one.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Precision is key when using an air fryer, as even small deviations can affect texture and cooking times. For example, using too much cream in a recipe might make it overly rich or alter the cooking process. Conversely, too little could leave your dish dry. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> simplifies these calculations, ensuring your meals turn out just right every time.</p>  

<p>Many air fryer recipes, especially desserts like custards or cakes, rely on exact measurements. Cream, in particular, can vary in density, so weighing it in ounces provides more accuracy than volume measurements. This is why knowing that 0.375 cup of cream equals 3 oz is so useful for home cooks and bakers alike.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure 0.375 Cup of Cream Without a Scale</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a kitchen scale, you can still measure 0.375 cup of cream accurately. A standard US cup holds 8 fluid ounces, so 0.375 cup is equivalent to 3 fluid ounces. Use a liquid measuring cup and fill it to the 3-ounce mark for precision. Alternatively, you can use tablespoons—0.375 cup equals 6 tablespoons, which is handy for smaller quantities.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for 0.375 Cup of Cream in Air Fryer Recipes</h2>  
<p>This measurement often appears in smaller-batch recipes, such as single-serving desserts or sauces. For instance, a creamy garlic sauce for air-fried chicken or a small batch of whipped cream for topping air-fryer-baked desserts might call for 0.375 cup of cream. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipes section</a> for inspiration on how to use this measurement creatively.</p>  

<p>Another great use is in air fryer cheesecakes or custards, where precise cream measurements ensure the right texture. Too much cream can make the dessert soggy, while too little might result in a dry, crumbly finish. By converting 0.375 cup of cream to 3 oz, you can follow recipes with confidence and avoid common pitfalls.</p>  

<h3>UK vs. US Measurements for Cream</h3>  
<p>In the UK, cream is often sold in millilitres or grams, which can be confusing if you’re following a US recipe. However, the weight of cream is fairly consistent: 0.375 cup (3 oz) is roughly 85 grams. If you’re using a UK recipe, you might see 85g of double cream instead of 0.375 cup. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert category</a> includes recipes with both metric and imperial measurements for ease.</p>  

<h2>Tips for Storing and Handling Cream</h2>  
<p>Once opened, cream should be used within a few days to maintain freshness. If your recipe calls for 0.375 cup of cream but you’ve opened a larger container, consider using the rest in another dish. For example, you could make a batch of air-fryer scones or a creamy pasta sauce. Proper storage in an airtight container in the fridge is essential to prevent spoilage.</p>  

<p>If you’re working with leftover cream, freezing it in measured portions (like 0.375 cup or 3 oz) can be a lifesaver. Thaw it in the fridge before use, though note that whipped cream won’t hold its texture after freezing.

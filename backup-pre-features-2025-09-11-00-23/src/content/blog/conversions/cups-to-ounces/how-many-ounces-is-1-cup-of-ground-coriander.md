faqQ1: "Can I use whole coriander seeds instead of ground coriander in my air fryer recipes?"
faqA1: "Yes, but you'll need to adjust the amount. Whole coriander seeds have a more concentrated flavour, so use about half the quantity. For example, if a recipe calls for 1 cup (3.5 ounces) of ground coriander, try 0.5 cups of whole seeds. Crush them lightly before using for better flavour distribution."
faqQ2: "Does the brand of ground coriander affect the weight per cup?"
faqA2: "Slight variations can occur due to grinding consistency, but most brands will weigh around 3.5 ounces per cup. For precision, especially in baking or spice blends, weighing with a scale is best. If you're adapting a recipe from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, stick to their measurements for consistency."
faqQ3: "How do I convert ounces of ground coriander to grams for UK recipes?"
faqA3: "1 ounce equals approximately 28 grams, so 3.5 ounces of ground coriander is about 98 grams. Many UK recipes use grams, so this conversion helps when following international guides. Always double-check if the recipe specifies packed or loose measurements."
faqQ4: "Can I substitute ground coriander with another spice in air fryer cooking?"
faqA4: "Ground cumin is the closest substitute, though it has a smokier taste. Use the same 1 cup to 3.5 ounces ratio, but expect a slightly different flavour profile. For more substitution tips, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a>."

Whether you're making spiced chicken, roasted vegetables, or a fragrant curry, accurate measurements make all the difference.</p>

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Using the correct amount of ground coriander ensures your dishes aren't overpowering or bland. The air fryer's intense heat can amplify flavours, so precision is key. Too much coriander might make your meal bitter, while too little could leave it tasting flat.

<h3>How to measure ground coriander correctly</h3>  
<p>For the most accurate results, use a kitchen scale to weigh your ground coriander. If you don't have one, spoon the coriander into a measuring cup and level it off with a knife. Avoid packing it down, as this can lead to an uneven measurement. This method ensures you get the right 3.5 ounces per cup.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for ground coriander in air fryer recipes</h2>  
<p>Ground coriander adds warmth and depth to many air fryer dishes. Try it in spiced chicken wings, roasted potatoes, or even homemade falafel. It pairs beautifully with cumin, turmeric, and chilli powder for a flavourful rub.

<p>You can also use ground coriander to season vegetables like carrots, cauliflower, or sweet potatoes before air frying. A little goes a long way, so stick to the 1 cup to 3.5 ounces ratio for best results.

<h3>Converting other measurements for ground coriander</h3>  
<p>If your recipe calls for tablespoons or grams instead of cups, here's a quick reference: 1 tablespoon of ground coriander is roughly 0.2 ounces, and 100 grams equals about 3.5 ounces. These conversions help when adjusting portion sizes or trying new dishes.</p>  

<h2>Storing ground coriander for freshness</h2>  
<p>To keep your ground coriander fresh, store it in an airtight container away from heat and light. Proper storage ensures the spice retains its flavour, making your 1 cup (3.5 ounces) measurement consistently tasty.

<p>Ground coriander loses potency over time, so it's best used within six months. If your spice smells faint or lacks aroma, it might be time to replace it. Freshly ground coriander will give your air fryer dishes the best flavour, so measure carefully and enjoy the results.</p>

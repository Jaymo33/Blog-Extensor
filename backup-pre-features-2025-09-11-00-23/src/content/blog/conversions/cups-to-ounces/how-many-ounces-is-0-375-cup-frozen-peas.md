faqQ1: "Can I use fresh peas instead of frozen for 0.375 cup measurements?"
faqA1: "Yes, fresh peas can replace frozen in the same 0.375 cup (3-ounce) measure. However, fresh peas cook faster, so reduce air fryer time by 1–2 minutes. They also won’t release as much moisture, so a light oil spray helps with crisping."
faqQ2: "Do I need to thaw frozen peas before air frying?"
faqA2: "No, you can air fry frozen peas directly for best results. Thawing can make them mushy. The air fryer’s rapid heat will cook them evenly, and the slight crispiness adds great texture. Just adjust cook times as needed."
faqQ3: "How do I store leftover frozen peas after measuring 0.375 cup?"
faqA3: "Reseal the bag tightly or transfer unused peas to an airtight container. Return them to the freezer immediately to prevent freezer burn. Label with the date to track freshness—peas keep well for up to 6 months."
faqQ4: "Why does 0.375 cup of frozen peas weigh 3 ounces?"
faqA4: "Frozen peas have a consistent density, so 0.375 cup typically equals 3 ounces. This standard applies to most brands, but slight variations can occur. For absolute precision, use a kitchen scale, especially for baking or meal prepping."

faqQ1: "How do I measure 2 cups of chopped walnuts without a scale?"
faqA1: "Lightly fill a measuring cup with chopped walnuts without packing them down. Level off the top with a knife for an accurate 2-cup measurement, which equals roughly 8 ounces."
faqQ2: "Can I use whole walnuts instead of chopped for the same weight?"
faqA2: "Yes, but whole walnuts take up more space, so 8 ounces will yield slightly less than 2 cups when chopped. For precision, chop first, then measure."
faqQ3: "Do toasted walnuts weigh the same as raw ones?"
faqA3: "Toasting removes moisture, so toasted walnuts may weigh slightly less per cup. For recipes requiring toasted nuts, measure after chopping and toasting."
faqQ4: "How should I store leftover chopped walnuts?"
faqA4: "Keep them in an airtight container in a cool, dark place or the fridge for up to a month. For longer storage, freeze them in 8-ounce portions."

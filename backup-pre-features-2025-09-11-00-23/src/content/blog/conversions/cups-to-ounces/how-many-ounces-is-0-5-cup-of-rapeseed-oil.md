faqQ1: "Can I use 0.5 cup of rapeseed oil for deep frying in an air fryer?"
faqA1: "Air fryers aren’t designed for deep frying, so 0.5 cup of rapeseed oil would be excessive. Instead, lightly coat your food with 1-2 tablespoons for crispiness. The air fryer’s circulating heat ensures even cooking without needing large amounts of oil."
faqQ2: "Is rapeseed oil the best choice for air frying?"
faqA2: "Rapeseed oil is excellent for air frying due to its high smoke point (around 230°C) and neutral taste. It’s healthier than many alternatives and works well for most recipes. Olive oil can also be used but has a lower smoke point."

faqA3: "0.5 cup of rapeseed oil is approximately 113 grams. If you’re using a kitchen scale, this measurement ensures accuracy. For other conversions, refer to a reliable chart or calculator."
faqQ4: "What’s the difference between rapeseed oil and vegetable oil in air fryers?"
faqA4: "Rapeseed oil has a higher smoke point and milder flavour compared to standard vegetable oil. Both work in air fryers, but rapeseed oil is often preferred for its health benefits and versatility in high-heat cooking."

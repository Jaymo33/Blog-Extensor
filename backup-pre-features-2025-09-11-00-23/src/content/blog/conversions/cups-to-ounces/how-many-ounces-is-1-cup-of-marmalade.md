faqQ1: "Does the type of marmalade affect the weight per cup?"
faqA1: "Yes, thicker cut marmalade with larger peel pieces may weigh slightly more per cup than smooth varieties. However, the difference is usually minimal - about 0.5 ounces at most. For most recipes, you can use the standard 8.5 ounces per cup conversion regardless of marmalade type."
faqQ2: "Can I use this conversion for other fruit preserves?"
faqA2: "While similar, other preserves like jam or jelly may have slightly different weights per cup due to varying fruit content and sugar levels. As a general rule, most fruit preserves weigh about 8-9 ounces per cup. For precise baking, it's best to check specific conversions for each type."
faqQ3: "How do I measure sticky marmalade without making a mess?"
faqA3: "Lightly coat your measuring cup with cooking spray or oil first - the marmalade will slide out more easily. Alternatively, use the displacement method: fill a liquid measuring cup with water to a certain level, add marmalade until the water rises by 1 cup, then drain the water to leave perfectly measured marmalade."
faqQ4: "Why do some recipes use weight measurements for marmalade?"
faqA4: "Weight measurements (ounces or grams) are more accurate than volume measurements (cups) for sticky ingredients like marmalade. The exact amount can vary based on how the cup is filled. Professional recipes often use weights to ensure consistent results, especially in baking where precision matters."

faqQ1: "Can I use a regular measuring cup for protein powder?"
faqA1: "Yes, but for the most accurate results, a kitchen scale is better. Measuring cups can vary slightly, especially with fluffy or dense powders. If using a cup, fluff the powder first and level it off."
faqQ2: "Does the type of protein powder affect the weight?"
faqA2: "Yes, whey protein is usually lighter than plant-based options. Always check the label for specific weight per cup. Adjust measurements if your powder feels unusually dense or light."
faqQ3: "How do I convert ounces to grams for protein powder?"
faqA3: "Multiply ounces by 28.35 to get grams. For example, 12 ounces is about 340 grams. This is useful if your recipe or scale uses metric measurements."
faqQ4: "Can I use this conversion for other powders like flour or sugar?"
faqA4: "No, different ingredients have different densities. Protein powder is lighter than flour but heavier than powdered sugar. Always check a conversion chart for specific ingredients."

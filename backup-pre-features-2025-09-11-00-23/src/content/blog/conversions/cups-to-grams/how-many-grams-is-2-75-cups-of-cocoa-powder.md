faqQ1: "Why is it better to measure cocoa powder in grams rather than cups?"
faqA1: "Measuring cocoa powder in grams is more accurate because cups can vary based on how the powder is packed. Grams provide a consistent measurement, which is crucial for air fryer baking where precision affects texture and taste. A kitchen scale eliminates guesswork."
faqQ2: "Does the type of cocoa powder affect the conversion from cups to grams?"
faqA2: "Most cocoa powders, whether natural or Dutch-processed, have a similar density, so the conversion (1 cup = 100 grams) remains reliable. However, if your cocoa powder is unusually coarse or fine, it’s best to weigh it for absolute accuracy."
faqQ3: "Can I use this conversion for other dry ingredients in air fryer recipes?"
faqA3: "While this conversion works for cocoa powder, other dry ingredients like flour or sugar have different densities. Always refer to a dedicated conversion chart, like the one on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>our site</a>, for precise measurements."
faqQ4: "How do I clean my air fryer after baking with cocoa powder?"
faqA4: "Cocoa powder can leave residue, so wipe your air fryer basket with a damp cloth and use a mild detergent. For stubborn stains, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning guide</a> to keep your appliance in top condition."

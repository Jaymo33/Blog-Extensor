faqQ1: "Is 2.75 cups of icing sugar the same in the UK and USA?"
faqA1: "Yes, 2.75 cups of icing sugar is roughly 330 grams in both the UK and USA. However, cup sizes can vary slightly by brand, so weighing ingredients is more reliable. For air fryer baking, always use grams for precision."
faqQ2: "Can I use a regular measuring cup for icing sugar?"
faqA2: "Yes, but ensure it’s a dry measuring cup and not a liquid one. Spoon the icing sugar lightly into the cup and level it off for accuracy. For best results, use a kitchen scale to measure 330 grams directly."
faqQ3: "Why does icing sugar need to be measured so precisely?"
faqA3: "Icing sugar’s fine texture means it can compact easily, leading to inconsistent measurements. In air fryer baking, even small discrepancies can affect texture and rise. Weighing ensures your recipes turn out perfectly every time."
faqQ4: "What’s the best way to store leftover icing sugar?"
faqA4: "Keep icing sugar in an airtight container in a cool, dry place to prevent clumping. If it hardens, sift it before using. For more storage tips, visit <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>."

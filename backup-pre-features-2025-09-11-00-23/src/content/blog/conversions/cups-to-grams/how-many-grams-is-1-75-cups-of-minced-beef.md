faqQ1: "Does the fat content of minced beef affect the weight per cup?"
faqA1: "Yes, the fat content can slightly impact the weight. Leaner minced beef (90% lean) may weigh a bit less per cup compared to fattier cuts (80% lean). However, the difference is minimal, and 1.75 cups will still be close to 350 grams. For precise measurements, use a kitchen scale."
faqQ2: "Can I use this conversion for frozen minced beef?"
faqA2: "Frozen minced beef can be denser, so it’s best to thaw it before measuring. If you must measure it frozen, fluff it lightly to avoid compacting. Even then, 1.75 cups should still be around 350 grams, but a scale is more reliable for frozen meat."
faqQ3: "How many servings does 1.75 cups (350g) of minced beef make?"
faqA3: "It depends on the recipe. For burgers, 350 grams makes about four patties. For dishes like bolognese or tacos, it serves 3–4 people. Adjust based on your recipe and portion sizes. Check our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipes</a> for serving ideas."
faqQ4: "Is this conversion the same in the UK and USA?"
faqA4: "Yes, 1.75 cups of minced beef equals 350 grams in both the UK and USA. Cup measurements are standardized, but slight variations can occur due to packing density. For absolute accuracy, weigh your minced beef instead of relying solely on cups."

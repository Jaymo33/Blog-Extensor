faqQ1: "Does the weight of broccoli change if it’s frozen?"
faqA1: "Yes, frozen broccoli may weigh slightly more due to ice crystals, but the difference is minimal. Always check the packaging for exact gram measurements if precision is important. For air fryer cooking, thawing frozen broccoli first helps achieve crispier results."
faqQ2: "Can I use this conversion for other vegetables?"
faqA2: "No, different vegetables have varying densities, so their cup-to-gram ratios differ. For example, 3.0 cups of spinach weigh far less than broccoli. Always look up specific conversions for each ingredient to ensure accuracy in your air fryer recipes."
faqQ3: "Why is weighing broccoli better than using cups?"
faqA3: "Weight measurements are more precise because cup measurements can vary based on how the broccoli is packed or chopped. Grams eliminate inconsistency, especially important for air fryer recipes where even cooking is crucial. A kitchen scale is a worthwhile investment for accuracy."
faqQ4: "How do I adjust cooking time for 3.0 cups of broccoli in the air fryer?"
faqA4: "For 270 grams of broccoli, air fry at 190°C for 8–10 minutes, shaking halfway. If the broccoli is crowded, cooking time may increase slightly. Always check for desired crispness and adjust as needed. For more air fryer timing tips, visit our website."

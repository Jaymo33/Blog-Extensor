faqQ1: "How do I measure 75g of onion without a scale?"
faqA1: "If you don’t have a scale, a medium onion weighs about 150g, so half of it will be roughly 75g. Alternatively, finely chopped onion fills about ¾ of a standard measuring cup for 75g. For best results, especially in air fryer recipes, investing in a kitchen scale is recommended."
faqQ2: "Can I use frozen onions instead of fresh for 75g?"
faqA2: "Yes, you can substitute frozen onions for fresh in most recipes. 75g of frozen onion is equivalent to 75g of fresh, but be aware that frozen onions may release more moisture during cooking. Adjust cooking times slightly if using them in your air fryer."
faqQ3: "How many calories are in 75g of onion?"
faqA3: "75g of onion contains approximately 30 calories, making it a low-calorie way to add flavour to your air fryer dishes. Onions are also rich in vitamins and antioxidants, adding nutritional value to your meals."
faqQ4: "Does the type of onion affect the weight conversion?"
faqA4: "No, the conversion from grams to ounces is the same regardless of onion type—whether it’s red, white, or brown. However, sweeter onions like shallots may have slightly different densities, so weighing is always the most accurate method."

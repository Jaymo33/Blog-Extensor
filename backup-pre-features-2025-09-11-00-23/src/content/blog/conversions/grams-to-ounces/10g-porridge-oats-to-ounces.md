faqQ1: "Can I use US ounces for UK porridge oats measurements?"
faqA1: "Yes, but UK recipes typically use metric measurements. 10g of porridge oats equals 0.35 ounces in both US and UK systems. For air fryer recipes, stick to grams unless the recipe specifies otherwise."
faqQ2: "Why does my air fryer porridge turn out dry with 10g oats?"
faqA2: "Dry porridge often means too little liquid, not an issue with the 10g-to-ounces conversion. Try increasing water or milk slightly. The air fryer’s heat evaporates moisture faster than stovetop cooking."
faqQ3: "How many calories are in 10g (0.35 oz) of porridge oats?"
faqA3: "Ten grams of plain porridge oats contain roughly 38 calories. This remains true whether measured in grams or ounces. Air frying doesn’t significantly alter the calorie count unless you add oils or sweeteners."
faqQ4: "Can I substitute instant oats for porridge oats in a 10g measurement?"
faqA4: "Yes, but texture changes. Instant oats weigh the same (10g = 0.35 oz) but absorb liquid faster. Reduce cooking time slightly in the air fryer to prevent over-drying. Check for doneness 2-3 minutes early."

<p>10 grams of porridge oats equals approximately 0.35 ounces. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements can make or break your dish.

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter for porridge oats</h2>  
<p>Porridge oats absorb liquid differently depending on their weight, so 10g versus 0.35 ounces might seem minor but affects texture.

Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> takes the guesswork out of these measurements. For perfect porridge or crispy toppings, always measure by weight when possible.</p>

faqQ2: "How does 15g of worcestershire sauce affect the flavour of air fryer dishes?"
faqA2: "15g (0.53 oz) of worcestershire sauce adds a balanced umami depth without overpowering. It works well in marinades for chicken, beef, or even tofu, enhancing savoury notes. For stronger flavour, you can adjust slightly, but 15g is a great starting point."
faqQ3: "Is worcestershire sauce gluten-free?"
faqA3: "Most worcestershire sauces contain malt vinegar, which has gluten, but gluten-free versions are available. Always check the label if you’re cooking for someone with dietary restrictions. This ensures your air fryer meals are safe and delicious for everyone."

faqA4: "Soy sauce can work as a substitute, but it’s saltier and lacks the tang of worcestershire sauce. Use about 10g (0.35 oz) of soy sauce for every 15g (0.53 oz) of worcestershire sauce, and add a splash of lemon juice to mimic the acidity. Adjust to taste."

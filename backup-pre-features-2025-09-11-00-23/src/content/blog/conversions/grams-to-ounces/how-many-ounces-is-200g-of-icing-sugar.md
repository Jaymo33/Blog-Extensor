faqQ1: "Can I use cups instead of ounces for 200g of icing sugar?"
faqA1: "Yes, but cups are less precise. 200g of icing sugar is roughly 1.6 cups, but this can vary based on how the sugar is packed. For best results, use a digital scale or refer to a conversion chart like the one at <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart</a>."
faqQ2: "Why do UK recipes use grams instead of ounces?"
faqA2: "The UK uses the metric system, so grams are standard for baking measurements. Ounces are more common in the US. Converting between the two ensures you can follow any recipe accurately, whether it's from the UK or abroad."
faqQ3: "How do I measure 200g of icing sugar without a scale?"
faqA3: "If you don’t have a scale, use a measuring cup and spoon the sugar in lightly. 200g is about 1.6 cups, but sift the sugar first to avoid lumps. For air fryer recipes, accuracy is key, so consider investing in a cheap digital scale for best results."
faqQ4: "Does 200g of icing sugar equal 200ml?"
faqA4: "No, grams measure weight, while millilitres measure volume. Icing sugar’s density means 200g won’t be the same as 200ml. Always use weight measurements for baking to ensure consistency, especially in air fryer recipes where precision matters."

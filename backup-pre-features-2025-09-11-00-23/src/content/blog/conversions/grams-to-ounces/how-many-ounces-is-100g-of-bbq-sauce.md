faqQ1: "Can I use 100g of bbq sauce for multiple servings in the air fryer?"
faqA1: "Yes, 100g of bbq sauce (3.53 ounces) is enough for 2-3 servings, depending on the dish. For example, it can coat 2 chicken breasts or a small rack of ribs. If you’re making smaller portions, like nuggets or veggies, you might get 4 servings. Adjust as needed based on your recipe."
faqQ2: "How does the thickness of bbq sauce affect the 100g to ounces conversion?"
faqA2: "The thickness of bbq sauce doesn’t change the weight (100g will always be 3.53 ounces), but it can affect volume measurements. Thicker sauces may pack more densely, so if you’re using tablespoons, you might need slightly less. For accuracy, a scale is best."
faqQ3: "Is 100g of bbq sauce the same as 100ml?"
faqA3: "No, 100g of bbq sauce is not the same as 100ml. Weight (grams) and volume (millilitres) measure different things. The exact ml equivalent depends on the sauce’s density, but roughly, 100g of bbq sauce is about 95-100ml. Always weigh for precision in air fryer recipes."
faqQ4: "Can I substitute 100g of bbq sauce with another sauce in air fryer recipes?"
faqA4: "You can substitute 100g of bbq sauce with a similar thick sauce, like teriyaki or honey mustard, but the flavour will change. Adjust cooking times slightly, as sugar content varies and can affect browning. For best results, stick to the recipe or check our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe guides</a> for alternatives."

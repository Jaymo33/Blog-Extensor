faqQ1: "Can I use bottled lemon juice instead of fresh for 40g measurements?"
faqA1: "Yes, bottled lemon juice can be used as a substitute for fresh lemon juice when measuring 40g. However, fresh lemon juice often has a brighter, more vibrant flavour. Bottled juice may contain preservatives, which can slightly alter the taste of your dish."
faqQ2: "How many lemons do I need for 40g of juice?"
faqA2: "One medium-sized lemon typically yields about 30-40g of juice, so one lemon should be enough. If your lemons are smaller or less juicy, you might need 1.5 lemons to reach 40g. Roll the lemon on a counter before juicing to maximise yield."
faqQ3: "Does 40g of lemon juice change if it’s heated in the air fryer?"
faqA3: "Heating lemon juice in the air fryer can reduce its volume slightly due to evaporation, but the weight (40g) remains the same if measured before cooking. The flavour may intensify as the water content evaporates, so adjust other seasonings accordingly."
faqQ4: "What’s the best way to store leftover lemon juice?"
faqA4: "Leftover lemon juice can be stored in an airtight container in the fridge for up to a week. For longer storage, freeze it in ice cube trays—each cube is roughly 15g, making it easy to measure out 40g when needed."

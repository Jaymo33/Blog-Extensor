faqQ1: "Is 150g of Worcestershire sauce the same as 150ml?"
faqA1: "No, 150g of Worcestershire sauce isn't the same as 150ml. While they're close (about 5.29 oz vs 5.07 oz), weight (grams) and volume (ml) measure different properties. For air fryer recipes, we recommend using weight measurements for better accuracy."
faqQ2: "Can I use a tablespoon to measure 150g of Worcestershire sauce?"
faqA2: "You could, but it would take about 10 UK tablespoons to reach 150g (5.29 oz) of Worcestershire sauce. For better precision in air fryer cooking, we suggest using digital scales. This ensures your marinades and sauces have the perfect balance of flavours."
faqQ3: "How long does 150g of Worcestershire sauce last once opened?"
faqA3: "An opened bottle of Worcestershire sauce typically lasts 1-2 years in the fridge. The 150g (5.29 oz) portion you measure out will keep well in an airtight container for several weeks. Its high vinegar content acts as a natural preservative, making it ideal for frequent air fryer use."
faqQ4: "Are there any substitutes for 150g of Worcestershire sauce in air fryer recipes?"
faqA4: "If you're short of Worcestershire sauce, try mixing 150g (5.29 oz) of soy sauce with a teaspoon of vinegar and pinch of sugar. While not identical, this substitute works in many air fryer recipes. For authentic flavour though, nothing beats proper Worcestershire sauce."

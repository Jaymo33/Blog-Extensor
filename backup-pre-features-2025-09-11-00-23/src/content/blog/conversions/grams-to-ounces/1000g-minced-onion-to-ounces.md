faqQ1: "Can I use cups instead of ounces for 1000g of minced onion?"
faqA1: "While you can use cups, it’s not recommended for accuracy. Minced onion’s volume can vary based on how finely it’s chopped, leading to inconsistent measurements. Weight (grams or ounces) is far more reliable for recipes, especially in air fryer cooking where precision matters."
faqQ2: "Does 1000g of minced onion equal 1000g of whole onions?"
faqA2: "No, 1000g of minced onion refers to the weight after chopping. Whole onions include skins and cores, which add weight but aren’t used in recipes. Always measure minced onion after preparation for the most accurate results."
faqQ3: "How long does 1000g of minced onion last in the fridge?"
faqA3: "1000g of minced onion (35.27 oz) will last 3–5 days in the fridge if stored in an airtight container. For longer storage, freeze it in portions. Properly stored, frozen minced onion can last up to 6 months without losing flavour."
faqQ4: "Can I substitute dried minced onion for fresh in air fryer recipes?"
faqA4: "Yes, but the conversion differs. Generally, 1 tablespoon of dried minced onion equals about 1/4 cup of fresh. For 1000g (35.27 oz) of fresh, you’d need roughly 200g (7 oz) of dried. Rehydrate dried onion with water before using for best results."

<h2>Common mistakes when converting 1000g minced onion to ounces</h2>

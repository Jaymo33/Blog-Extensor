faqQ1: "Can I use liquid milk instead of 125g powdered milk in air fryer recipes?"
faqA1: "No, liquid and powdered milk aren’t interchangeable without conversion. 125g of powdered milk equals about 4.41 ounces and would need to be reconstituted with water per package instructions. For air fryer coatings or dry mixes, stick to powdered for best results."
faqQ2: "Why does my 125g of powdered milk measurement vary slightly?"
faqA2: "Variations can occur due to settling or how you scoop it. Always fluff powdered milk before measuring, and use a scale for accuracy. 125g should consistently equal 4.41 ounces if measured correctly."
faqQ3: "How long does 125g of powdered milk last once opened?"
faqA3: "An opened package of powdered milk lasts about 3–6 months if stored airtight in a cool, dry place. For air fryer recipes, clumping from moisture can affect measurements, so check freshness before use."
faqQ4: "Is 125g of powdered milk the same as 125ml?"
faqA4: "No, grams measure weight (125g = 4.41 oz), while millilitres measure volume. Powdered milk is lighter; 125ml would weigh less than 125g. Always use weight for dry ingredients in air fryer cooking."

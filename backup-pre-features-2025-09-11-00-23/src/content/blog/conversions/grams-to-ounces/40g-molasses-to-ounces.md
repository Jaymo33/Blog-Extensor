faqQ1: "Can I use honey instead of molasses in an air fryer recipe?"
faqA1: "Yes, you can substitute honey for molasses, but the flavour and texture will differ. Honey is sweeter and thinner, so you might need to adjust the quantity. For 40g of molasses, try using 30g of honey and add a teaspoon of lemon juice to mimic molasses’ tanginess."
faqQ2: "Why does my air fryer recipe call for molasses by weight instead of volume?"
faqA2: "Weight measurements (like grams) are more accurate than volume (like cups) for thick, sticky ingredients like molasses. A slight variation in volume can throw off your recipe’s balance, especially in air fryer cooking where precision affects texture and browning."
faqQ3: "How do I store leftover molasses after measuring 40g?"
faqA3: "Store molasses in an airtight container at room temperature for up to a year. If it crystallises, gently warm the jar in hot water to restore its smooth texture. Avoid refrigerating, as it can thicken and become harder to measure."
faqQ4: "Is blackstrap molasses the same as regular molasses for air fryer recipes?"
faqA4: "Blackstrap molasses is darker, more bitter, and less sweet than regular molasses. While you can use it, start with half the amount (e.g., 20g instead of 40g) and adjust to taste. It’s best suited for savoury dishes like baked beans or marinades."

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>

For example, a sticky glaze for air-fried chicken wings needs the right balance of sweetness and thickness. If you’re using a recipe from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>our collection</a>, converting 40g of molasses to ounces ensures consistency.</p>  

<p>Molasses is a dense liquid, so measuring by weight (grams) is more accurate than volume (cups or tablespoons). A digital kitchen scale is your best friend here. If your recipe calls for 40g of molasses, you’ll need roughly 1.41 ounces. This small but critical detail can elevate your air fryer dishes from good to great.</p>  

<h2>How to measure 40g of molasses without a scale</h2>  
<p>Don’t have a kitchen scale? No problem. You can still measure 40g of molasses using common household tools. One tablespoon of molasses weighs about 20g, so two tablespoons will give you roughly 40g (or 1.41 ounces). For smaller quantities, a teaspoon holds around 7g, so you’d need about 5.5 teaspoons to reach 40g.</p>  

<p>Keep in mind that molasses is sticky, so lightly greasing your measuring spoon with oil can help it slide off easily. This trick is especially handy when prepping ingredients for air fryer recipes like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>desserts</a> or marinades. Accuracy matters, but a little flexibility won’t hurt—just aim for close approximations if you’re without a scale.</p>

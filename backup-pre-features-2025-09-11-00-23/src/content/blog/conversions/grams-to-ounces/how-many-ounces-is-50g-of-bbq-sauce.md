faqQ1: "Is 50g of BBQ sauce the same as 50ml?"
faqA1: "No, 50g and 50ml are not the same. Grams measure weight, while millilitres measure volume. The exact conversion depends on the density of the BBQ sauce, but 50g is roughly 47–50ml for most brands."
faqQ2: "Can I use a tablespoon to measure 50g of BBQ sauce?"
faqA2: "Yes, but it’s less precise. Three tablespoons roughly equal 50g, but thicker sauces may weigh more. For accuracy, a kitchen scale is best, especially for air fryer recipes where consistency matters."
faqQ3: "How much BBQ sauce should I use for air fryer chicken wings?"
faqA3: "For 500g of chicken wings, 50g of BBQ sauce is a good starting point. Adjust to taste—brush half before cooking and the rest halfway through for a sticky glaze."
faqQ4: "Does the brand of BBQ sauce affect the 50g-to-ounces conversion?"
faqA4: "No, 50g always equals ~1.76 ounces, but thicker sauces may appear denser. Check labels for additives that could slightly alter weight, but the difference is minimal for most recipes."

faqQ1: "Is 200g of flour the same as 200ml?"
faqA1: "No, grams and millilitres measure different things - weight versus volume. 200g of flour is about 7.05 ounces by weight, while 200ml is a volume measurement that would weigh less for flour because it's less dense. Always weigh flour for baking accuracy."
faqQ2: "Can I use plain flour instead of self-raising if a recipe calls for 200g?"
faqA2: "You can substitute plain flour for self-raising, but you'll need to add raising agents. For every 200g of plain flour, add 2 teaspoons of baking powder to mimic self-raising flour. This adjustment is especially important in air fryer baking where even rise matters."
faqQ3: "How does flour type affect the 200g to ounces conversion?"
faqA3: "Different flour types have slightly different densities. While 200g of all-purpose flour is about 7.05 ounces, wholemeal flour might be slightly more due to its coarser texture. For most home cooking, the difference is negligible, but for precision baking, weigh each type separately."
faqQ4: "Why do some recipes use grams and others use ounces for flour?"
faqA4: "Grams are standard in metric system countries like the UK, while ounces are more common in the US. Many modern UK recipes use grams for precision, especially in baking.

<p>200g of flour equals approximately 7.05 ounces. This conversion is essential for anyone baking or cooking with an air fryer, where precise measurements can make or break a recipe. Whether you're whipping up a cake or coating chicken for a crispy finish, knowing how to convert grams to ounces ensures consistent results every time. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we understand the importance of accuracy, especially when adapting recipes for your air fryer.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate flour measurements matter</h2>  
<p>Using the correct amount of flour is crucial in baking and air frying. Too much flour can make your dishes dense or dry, while too little can lead to soggy or undercooked results. For example, if you're making air fryer cookies from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>our recipe collection</a>, 200g of flour (7.05 ounces) ensures the perfect texture. Even a small deviation can alter the outcome, so sticking to precise measurements is key.</p>  

<p>Many UK recipes use grams, while some older or American recipes rely on ounces. This can be confusing if you're not familiar with conversions. A digital kitchen scale is the best tool for accuracy, but if you don't have one, knowing that 200g of flour is roughly 7.05 ounces will help.

<h3>How to measure 200g of flour without scales</h3>  
<p>If you don't have scales, you can use measuring cups, though this method is less precise. One cup of all-purpose flour typically weighs around 120g, so 200g would be roughly 1 and 2/3 cups. However, flour can settle or become compacted, so spooning it lightly into the cup and levelling it off gives the most accurate result. For air fryer recipes like those in our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>cake category</a>, precision is especially important.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for 200g of flour in air frying</h2>  
<p>200g of flour is a common measurement in many air fryer recipes. It's enough to coat chicken for crispy tenders, make a small batch of dough for air fryer flatbreads, or prepare batter for onion rings. If you're meal prepping, you might use 200g of flour to make a batch of air fryer scones or muffins from our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/breakfast>breakfast recipes</a>.</p>  

<p>When working with frozen foods in your air fryer, like fish or vegetables, 200g of flour can be the perfect amount for a light dredge before cooking. This creates that desirable crispy exterior without being too heavy. Remember, keeping your air fryer clean is just as important as accurate measurements, so check out our guide on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaning</a> for best practices.</p>  

<h3>Converting other common flour amounts</h3>  
<p>While we've focused on 200g of flour (7.05 ounces), you might need other conversions. For instance, 100g is about 3.5 ounces, and 250g is approximately 8.8 ounces. Having these conversions handy makes adapting recipes much easier, whether you're using an air fryer or conventional oven. Bookmark our conversion resources for quick reference when cooking.</p>

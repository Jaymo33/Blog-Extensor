faqQ1: "Why is it better to weigh icing sugar rather than use cup measurements?"
faqA1: "Weighing icing sugar gives more accurate results because how the sugar is packed affects volume measurements. 40g of icing sugar might fill a cup differently depending on whether it's sifted or packed down. Scales eliminate this variability for consistent baking results every time."
faqQ2: "Can I use this 40g to ounces conversion for other types of sugar?"
faqA2: "While the weight conversion (40g equals 1.41oz) works for any ingredient, different sugars have varying densities. Granulated sugar weighs more per cup than icing sugar, so volume measurements would differ. Always check specific conversion charts for different sugar types."
faqQ3: "How do I measure 40g of icing sugar without scales?"
faqA3: "Without scales, you can approximate 40g of icing sugar as about 1/3 cup when lightly spooned (not packed). However, this isn't precise - the sugar's density affects volume measurements. For accurate results in air fryer baking, we strongly recommend using digital kitchen scales."
faqQ4: "Does humidity affect the weight of icing sugar?"
faqA4: "Humidity can cause icing sugar to clump and become more compact, potentially affecting volume measurements. However, 40g of icing sugar will always weigh 40g regardless of humidity. This is another reason weight measurements are more reliable than volume for consistent baking results."

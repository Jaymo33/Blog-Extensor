faqQ1: "Can I use a teaspoon to measure 20g of marmalade?"
faqA1: "A teaspoon holds about 7g of marmalade, so you’d need roughly 3 teaspoons for 20g (0.7 oz). For accuracy, slightly overfill each spoon. This method works for quick fixes, but scales are best for air fryer recipes requiring precision."
faqQ2: "Why does my air fryer marmalade glaze burn?"
faqA2: "Burning happens if the glaze is too thick or cooked too long. Thin 20g of marmalade with a splash of water before brushing. Air fry at 160°C for shorter intervals, checking every 2 minutes to prevent overcooking."
faqQ3: "How many calories are in 20g of marmalade?"
faqA3: "20g (0.7 oz) of standard orange marmalade contains roughly 54 calories, mostly from sugars. Light versions may have fewer. For healthier air fryer recipes, use sparingly or opt for reduced-sugar brands."
faqQ4: "Can I substitute honey for 20g of marmalade?"
faqA4: "Yes, but adjust quantities. Honey is sweeter, so use 15g (0.5 oz) instead of 20g. Add citrus zest to mimic marmalade’s tang. Note that honey caramelises faster in air fryers, so reduce cooking time slightly."

<p>75g of baking powder equals approximately 2.65 ounces. This conversion is essential for anyone using UK recipes or air fryer cooking, where precise measurements can make or break a dish. Whether you’re baking a cake or preparing a savoury recipe, knowing how to convert grams to ounces ensures consistency and perfect results every time.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer baking</h2>  
<p>Baking powder is a leavening agent, and using the right amount is crucial for achieving the desired rise and texture in your baked goods. Too little, and your cake might turn out dense; too much, and it could collapse. The air fryer’s rapid air circulation means even small measurement errors can affect the outcome. That’s why converting 75g of baking powder to ounces (2.65 oz) accurately is so important.</p>  
<p>For those who love experimenting with air fryer recipes, precise measurements ensure your dishes turn out perfectly every time. Whether you’re making fluffy pancakes or crispy onion rings, the right amount of baking powder makes all the difference.

<h3>How to measure 75g of baking powder without a scale</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a digital scale, you can still measure 75g of baking powder using tablespoons. One level tablespoon of baking powder weighs about 15g, so 75g would be roughly 5 tablespoons. However, for the most accurate results, especially in baking, a scale is highly recommended. A small investment in a digital kitchen scale can save you from recipe mishaps.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for 75g of baking powder in air fryer recipes</h2>  
<p>75g of baking powder is often used in larger batches of baked goods, such as cakes, muffins, or even homemade doughnuts. In the air fryer, this amount might be used for recipes like savoury fritters or tempura batter, where a light, crispy texture is key. The air fryer’s high heat ensures even cooking, but the right amount of baking powder ensures the perfect rise.</p>

<h3>Converting other baking ingredients from grams to ounces</h3>  
<p>While 75g of baking powder converts to 2.65 ounces, other ingredients have different conversions. For example, 75g of flour is about 2.65 ounces, but 75g of sugar is closer to 2.65 ounces as well. Always double-check conversions, especially when working with dense or powdery ingredients. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>cake recipes</a> often include both metric and imperial measurements for convenience.</p>  

<h2>Tips for storing baking powder for optimal results</h2>  
<p>To keep your baking powder fresh and effective, store it in an airtight container in a cool, dry place. Exposure to moisture can cause it to lose its potency, leading to flat cakes or soggy batters. If you’re unsure whether your baking powder is still active, test it by mixing a teaspoon with hot water—if it bubbles vigorously, it’s still good to use.</p>

faqQ1: "Can I use quick oats instead of rolled oats for air fryer recipes?"
faqA1: "Yes, you can substitute quick oats, but the texture will differ. Quick oats absorb liquid faster and may result in a softer texture in air fryer recipes like granola or coatings. For crisper results, stick with rolled oats when possible."
faqQ2: "How long do 500g of rolled oats last once opened?"
faqA2: "Properly stored in an airtight container, 500g of rolled oats stays fresh for 3-6 months. For best results in air fryer cooking, use them within 3 months as older oats may require longer cooking times and lose some flavour."
faqQ3: "Why does my air fryer oat granola burn before crisping?"
faqA3: "This usually happens when the temperature is too high or the basket is overcrowded. Try reducing the temperature by 10°C and cooking in smaller batches. Stirring halfway through also ensures even browning without burning."
faqQ4: "Can I make oat flour from 500g of rolled oats in my air fryer?"
faqA4: "While you can toast oats in the air fryer before blending into flour, the actual grinding should be done in a food processor or blender. Toast 100g batches at 160°C for 5-7 minutes, then blend until fine for best results."

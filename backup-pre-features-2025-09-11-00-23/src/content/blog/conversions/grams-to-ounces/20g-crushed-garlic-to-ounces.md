faqQ1: "Can I use minced garlic instead of crushed garlic in air fryer recipes?"
faqA1: "Yes, you can substitute minced garlic for crushed garlic, but the texture and intensity may differ slightly. Minced garlic is finer, so 20g will have a more concentrated flavour. Adjust quantities if needed, starting with a bit less and tasting as you go."
faqQ2: "How do I store leftover crushed garlic for future air fryer recipes?"
faqA2: "Store leftover crushed garlic in an airtight container in the fridge for up to a week. For longer storage, freeze it in ice cube trays with a bit of olive oil. Each cube (about 5g) can be popped straight into your air fryer dishes when needed."
faqQ3: "Does 20g of crushed garlic lose flavour when cooked in an air fryer?"
faqA3: "Air frying can mellow garlic’s sharpness but won’t eliminate its flavour entirely. For a stronger taste, add a bit more garlic or mix some in after cooking. High heat can caramelise garlic, adding a sweet, nutty depth to dishes."
faqQ4: "What’s the best way to clean my air fryer after cooking with garlic?"
faqA4: "Wipe the air fryer basket with warm, soapy water to remove garlic residue. For stubborn smells, a mix of baking soda and water works wonders. Regular cleaning prevents lingering odours and keeps your air fryer ready for the next recipe."

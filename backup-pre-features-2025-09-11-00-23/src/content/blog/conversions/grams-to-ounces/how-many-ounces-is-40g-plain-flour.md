faqQ1: "Can I use 40g of self-raising flour instead of plain flour in my air fryer?"
faqA1: "Yes, but self-raising flour contains baking powder, which may alter the texture of your dish. For coatings or crispy foods, plain flour (1.41 oz per 40g) is better. If substituting, omit added leavening agents in the recipe."
faqQ2: "How do I measure 40g of plain flour without scales?"
faqA2: "A UK metric tablespoon holds about 10g of plain flour, so 4 level tablespoons equal roughly 40g (1.41 oz). For accuracy, fluff the flour first and level off the spoon. A conversion chart helps when scales aren’t available."
faqQ3: "Why does my air fryer recipe require 40g of plain flour?"
faqA3: "40g (1.41 oz) is ideal for small portions or coatings in air fryers, ensuring even cooking. Larger amounts can clump or block airflow. Always measure precisely—air fryers cook faster, so ratios matter more than in conventional ovens."
faqQ4: "Does 40g of plain flour weigh the same as 40g of other ingredients?"
faqA4: "Yes, 40g always equals 1.41 oz, but ingredient density varies. For example, 40g of sugar occupies more volume than flour. Use weight (grams/ounces) for accuracy, especially in air fryer recipes where consistency affects results."

faqQ1: "How do I measure 15g of tahini without a scale?"
faqA1: "If you don’t have a scale, use a tablespoon—15g of tahini is roughly 1 level tablespoon. For accuracy, scrape off any excess tahini with a knife to ensure a clean measure. Sticky ingredients like tahini can cling to the spoon, so this step prevents under-measuring."
faqQ2: "Can I substitute tahini with another ingredient in air fryer recipes?"
faqA2: "While tahini has a unique nutty flavour, you can substitute it with smooth peanut butter or almond butter in most recipes. The texture will be similar, but the taste will differ slightly. For a nut-free option, try sunflower seed butter, though it may alter the dish’s flavour profile."
faqQ3: "Why does my tahini sauce separate in the air fryer?"
faqA3: "Tahini sauces can separate due to high heat or insufficient mixing. To prevent this, whisk the sauce thoroughly before use and avoid overcooking. If separation occurs, a quick stir after cooking usually brings it back together. Adding a splash of water or lemon juice can also help emulsify it."
faqQ4: "How should I store tahini after opening?"
faqA4: "Store tahini in an airtight container in the fridge to prevent rancidity. It may thicken when cold, so let it sit at room temperature for 10 minutes before use. Stir well to reincorporate any separated oil. Properly stored, tahini lasts up to 6 months."

<p>15 grams of tahini equals approximately 0.53 ounces. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements can make or break a dish. Whether you’re whipping up a tahini-based sauce or adding it to a marinade, knowing the exact weight ensures consistency. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we focus on helping you nail every detail, from conversions to cooking times.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate tahini measurements matter</h2>  
<p>Tahini’s thick, paste-like consistency means even small variations in weight can affect your recipe’s texture and flavour. Too much tahini can overpower a dish, while too little might leave it lacking depth. For air fryer cooking, where ingredients cook quickly, precision is key. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> simplifies these calculations, so you spend less time measuring and more time enjoying your meal.</p>  

<p>Many UK cooks prefer using grams, but some recipes—especially those from the US—list tahini in ounces. Converting 15g of tahini to ounces (0.53 oz) ensures you follow the recipe correctly. This is particularly useful for dishes like tahini-glazed chicken or roasted vegetables, where balance is everything. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a> for inspiration on using tahini in your air fryer.</p>  

<h3>Tools for measuring tahini</h3>  
<p>A digital kitchen scale is the most accurate way to measure 15g of tahini. If you don’t have one, a tablespoon can work in a pinch—roughly 1 tablespoon of tahini equals 15g. However, for sticky ingredients like tahini, scraping the spoon clean ensures you don’t under-measure. Always level off the spoon for consistency.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for tahini in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Tahini adds richness to marinades, dressings, and dips, making it a versatile ingredient for air fryer meals. Try it in a marinade for air-fried tofu or as a drizzle over roasted vegetables. Its nutty flavour pairs well with spices like cumin and paprika, common in Middle Eastern-inspired dishes. Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/tofu>tofu recipes</a> for tahini-infused ideas.</p>  

<p>Another great use for tahini is in sauces for air-fried chicken or lamb. A blend of tahini, lemon juice, and garlic makes a creamy, tangy topping. Since 15g of tahini equals 0.53 ounces, you can easily adjust quantities for larger batches.

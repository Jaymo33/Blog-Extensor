faqQ1: "Can I use jarred minced garlic instead of fresh for the 150g measurement?"
faqA1: "Yes, you can use jarred minced garlic as a substitute for fresh when measuring 150g (5.29 oz). However, jarred garlic often has a slightly different texture and moisture content, which might affect measurements slightly. For best results in air fryer recipes, drain any excess liquid before measuring."
faqQ2: "How does the conversion from 150g to ounces affect air fryer cooking times?"
faqA2: "The conversion from 150g to ounces (5.29 oz) doesn't directly affect cooking times, but the amount of garlic used can influence flavour intensity. In air fryer cooking, larger quantities of minced garlic might require slightly longer cooking if they're coating ingredients like chicken or vegetables, as the moisture needs to evaporate for proper crisping."
faqQ3: "Is 150g of minced garlic the same as 150g of whole garlic cloves?"
faqA3: "No, 150g of minced garlic is not the same as 150g of whole cloves. Whole cloves include peels and have a different volume once minced. If starting with whole cloves, you'll need more by weight to yield 150g of minced garlic. Typically, you'd need about 30-35 medium cloves to make 150g (5.29 oz) of minced garlic."
faqQ4: "How can I measure 150g of minced garlic without scales?"
faqA4: "Without scales, you can estimate 150g of minced garlic as roughly 15 level tablespoons (assuming 10g per tablespoon). However, this method isn't as precise as using digital scales. For air fryer recipes where accuracy matters, investing in a basic kitchen scale will give you more consistent results when converting between grams and ounces."

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>
<p>Air fryers rely on precise cooking times and ingredient quantities to deliver crispy, evenly cooked results. Using the correct amount of minced garlic, whether in grams or ounces, can affect flavour intensity and cooking performance. Too much garlic might overpower your dish, while too little could leave it lacking.

<p>Many UK recipes use grams, while some older cookbooks or international recipes might use ounces. Being able to convert between these units is particularly useful when preparing garlic-heavy dishes like roasted vegetables or garlic bread in your air fryer. The good news is that once you know the basic conversion, it's easy to adjust quantities as needed.</p>

<h3>How to measure minced garlic accurately</h3>
<p>When measuring 150g of minced garlic (or 5.29 ounces), it's best to use digital kitchen scales for precision. If you don't have scales, remember that one level tablespoon of minced garlic weighs about 10g, so 150g would be roughly 15 tablespoons. However, scales are far more accurate, especially for air fryer recipes where consistency is key.</p>

<h3>Storing leftover minced garlic</h3>

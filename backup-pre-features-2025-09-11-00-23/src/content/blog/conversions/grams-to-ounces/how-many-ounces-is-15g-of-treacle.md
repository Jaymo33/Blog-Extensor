faqQ1: "Can I use golden syrup instead of treacle in an air fryer recipe?"
faqA1: "Yes, golden syrup can substitute treacle, but it’s lighter and sweeter. Use the same weight (15g or 0.53 oz), but expect a milder flavour. Adjust spices like ginger or cinnamon to balance the taste."
faqQ2: "Why does my air fryer treacle glaze burn so quickly?"
faqA2: "Treacle’s high sugar content caramelises fast in an air fryer’s intense heat. To prevent burning, lower the temperature by 10°C and check frequently. A thin, even layer of 15g treacle works best."
faqQ3: "How do I store leftover treacle after measuring 15g?"
faqA3: "Keep treacle in an airtight container at room temperature. If it crystallises, warm the jar in hot water. Always wipe the rim clean to avoid stickiness."
faqQ4: "Is black treacle the same as molasses for air fryer recipes?"
faqA4: "Black treacle is similar to molasses but slightly sweeter and less bitter. You can swap them 1:1 by weight (e.g., 15g treacle = 15g molasses), but taste may vary slightly."

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on precise ingredient ratios to deliver even cooking and perfect textures. Using the correct amount of treacle—whether 15g or its ounce equivalent—ensures your dishes aren’t too sweet or too dry. For example, a <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>treacle-glazed salmon</a> requires just the right balance to caramelise properly. Even small deviations can affect browning and flavour, so measuring 15g of treacle accurately is key.</p>  

<p>Many UK recipes use grams, but if your kitchen scale only measures ounces, converting 15g of treacle to ounces (0.53 oz) is a lifesaver. This is especially handy for <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert recipes</a>, where treacle’s thickness can throw off volume-based measurements like tablespoons. Always weigh sticky ingredients like treacle for the best results.</p>

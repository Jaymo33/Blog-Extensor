faqQ1: "Can I use a tablespoon to measure 75g of condensed milk?"
faqA1: "While it’s possible, tablespoons measure volume, not weight, so accuracy may vary. One tablespoon of condensed milk is roughly 20g, so you’d need about 3.75 tablespoons for 75g. For best results, use a kitchen scale."
faqQ2: "Why does condensed milk weight matter in air fryer recipes?"
faqA2: "Air fryers cook food quickly and evenly, so precise measurements prevent over-sweetening or uneven textures. Too much condensed milk can make desserts overly sticky, while too little may leave them dry."
faqQ3: "How do I store leftover condensed milk after measuring 75g?"
faqA3: "Transfer leftovers to an airtight container and refrigerate for up to two weeks. For longer storage, freeze it in ice cube trays and thaw as needed for future recipes."
faqQ4: "Is 75g of condensed milk the same as evaporated milk?"
faqA4: "No, condensed milk is sweetened and thicker, while evaporated milk is unsweetened. Substituting one for the other will significantly alter the taste and texture of your dish."

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>When it comes to baking or making desserts in your air fryer, precision is key. Too much or too little condensed milk can alter the texture and taste of your dish. For example, a mousse or fudge recipe relying on 75g of condensed milk needs the exact amount to set properly.

faqQ1: "Can I use 5g of rolled oats for air fryer granola?"
faqA1: "Absolutely! 5g of rolled oats is a small but useful portion for testing granola mixes or adding to yogurt. For a full batch, scale up the recipe and spread the mixture evenly in the air fryer basket for even crisping."
faqQ2: "How do I store rolled oats for air fryer recipes?"
faqA2: "Keep rolled oats in an airtight container in a cool, dry place. For longer storage, freeze them in portions. This prevents clumping and makes it easy to grab 5g (0.18 oz) when needed for recipes."

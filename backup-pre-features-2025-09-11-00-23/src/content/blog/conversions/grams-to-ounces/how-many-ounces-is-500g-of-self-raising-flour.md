faqQ1: "Can I use plain flour instead of self-raising flour for 500g measurements?"
faqA1: "Yes, but you'll need to add baking powder. For every 500g (17.64 oz) of plain flour, mix in 2-3 teaspoons of baking powder. Sift them together to ensure even distribution, especially for air fryer recipes where consistency is key."
faqQ2: "How does air fryer baking affect self-raising flour measurements?"
faqA2: "Air fryers cook faster and with more concentrated heat, so precise measurements matter. 500g (17.64 oz) of self-raising flour behaves the same, but you may need to reduce cooking times by 10-15% compared to oven baking."
faqQ3: "Why is my 500g self-raising flour bake dense in the air fryer?"
faqA3: "Overmixing or inaccurate measurements can cause denseness. Ensure you’ve measured 500g (17.64 oz) correctly and fold ingredients gently. Also, check your air fryer’s temperature calibration—uneven heat can affect rise."
faqQ4: "Can I halve a recipe that calls for 500g of self-raising flour?"
faqA4: "Absolutely! Halving 500g (17.64 oz) gives you 250g (8.82 oz), which works well for smaller air fryer batches. Just adjust other ingredients proportionally and monitor cooking times closely, as smaller portions may cook faster."

<h2>Why Convert Grams to Ounces?</h2>  
<p>Many UK recipes use grams, while others rely on ounces, especially older or American-inspired recipes. Converting 500g of self-raising flour to ounces (17.64 oz) helps avoid measurement mishaps. This is particularly useful when using an air fryer, where precise ingredient ratios can affect texture and rise. If you're exploring new recipes, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a> offers plenty of inspiration.</p>  

<p>Self-raising flour contains baking powder, so accurate measurements are crucial for achieving the right lift in baked goods. Too much or too little can lead to dense or overly crumbly results. For air fryer baking, where heat distribution differs from conventional ovens, precision matters even more.</p>

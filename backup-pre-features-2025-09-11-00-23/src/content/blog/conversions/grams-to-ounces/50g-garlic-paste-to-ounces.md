faqQ1: "Can I use minced garlic instead of garlic paste in my air fryer recipe?"
faqA1: "Yes, you can substitute minced garlic for garlic paste, but the texture and intensity will differ. Use 1.5 times the amount of minced garlic to match the flavour of 50g (1.76 oz) of paste, as minced garlic is less concentrated. Adjust other liquids in the recipe if needed."
faqQ2: "How long does garlic paste last in the fridge?"
faqA2: "Homemade garlic paste lasts about 1-2 weeks in the fridge if stored in an airtight container. Store-bought varieties may last longer due to preservatives—always check the label. For longer storage, freeze it in portions."
faqQ3: "Why does my air fryer recipe taste bitter with garlic paste?"
faqA3: "Bitterness usually occurs when garlic paste burns at high temperatures. To prevent this, mix it with oil or other liquids before applying, and avoid cooking above 180°C. Also, ensure you’re using the correct amount—50g (1.76 oz) is ideal for most recipes."
faqQ4: "Is 50g of garlic paste the same as 50g of fresh garlic?"
faqA4: "No, fresh garlic and garlic paste have different intensities. 50g of fresh garlic yields about 30g of paste once peeled and blended. For recipes specifying paste, stick to the 50g (1.76 oz) measurement for accurate results."

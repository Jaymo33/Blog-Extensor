faqQ1: "Is 50g of water the same as 50ml?"
faqA1: "Yes, 50g of water is equivalent to 50ml, as water has a density of 1g/ml. This makes it easy to measure by volume if you don’t have a scale. However, for other liquids like oil or milk, the conversion may differ due to varying densities."

faqA4: "Adding 50g of water to an air fryer can create steam, which may slightly increase cooking times for certain dishes. It’s often used to keep food moist, like in steamed vegetables or cakes. Always adjust times based on your specific air fryer model."

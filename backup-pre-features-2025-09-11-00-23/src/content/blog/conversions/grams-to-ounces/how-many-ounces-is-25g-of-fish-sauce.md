faqQ1: "Can I use a tablespoon to measure 25g of fish sauce?"
faqA1: "While possible, it’s not the most accurate method. One tablespoon of fish sauce weighs about 15g, so 25g would be roughly 1.5 tablespoons. For precision, a digital kitchen scale is best."
faqQ2: "Does fish sauce expire?"
faqA2: "Fish sauce has a long shelf life—up to a year when stored properly. Keep it in a cool, dark place and ensure the lid is tightly sealed. Over time, the flavour may intensify but remains safe to use."
faqQ3: "Can I substitute soy sauce for fish sauce in a 25g measurement?"
faqA3: "Soy sauce can work in a pinch, but the flavours differ. Fish sauce adds umami depth, while soy sauce is saltier. If substituting, start with a smaller amount (e.g., 20g) and adjust to taste."
faqQ4: "Why is my air fryer dish too salty after using 25g of fish sauce?"
faqA4: "Fish sauce is highly concentrated. If your dish tastes too salty, balance it with a squeeze of lime or a pinch of sugar. Next time, reduce the fish sauce slightly and taste as you go."

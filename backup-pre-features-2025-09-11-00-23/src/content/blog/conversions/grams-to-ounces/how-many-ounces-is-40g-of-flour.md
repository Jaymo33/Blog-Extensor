faqQ1: "Why is 40g of flour a common measurement in air fryer recipes?"
faqA1: "40g of flour is often used in air fryer recipes because it’s ideal for small-batch baking or coating. Air fryers have limited space, so recipes are typically scaled down. This amount ensures even cooking and prevents overcrowding."
faqQ2: "Can I use a measuring cup instead of scales for 40g of flour?"
faqA2: "Yes, you can use a measuring cup if you don’t have scales. 40g of flour is roughly a third of a UK metric cup. Spoon the flour lightly into the cup and level it off for accuracy. For best results, though, digital scales are recommended."
faqQ3: "Does the type of flour affect the conversion from grams to ounces?"
faqA3: "The type of flour can slightly affect the weight due to density differences. However, for most all-purpose or plain flour, 40g will still be close to 1.41 ounces. Wholemeal or bread flour may vary slightly but not enough to impact most recipes."
faqQ4: "How do I store flour to keep it fresh for air fryer baking?"
faqA4: "Store flour in an airtight container in a cool, dry place to maintain freshness. For longer storage, keep it in the fridge or freezer. Always let it come to room temperature before using it in air fryer recipes to ensure accurate measurements."

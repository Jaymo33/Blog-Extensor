faqQ1: "Is 200g of soy sauce the same as 200ml?"
faqA1: "No, 200g of soy sauce is not the same as 200ml. Grams measure weight, while millilitres measure volume. The density of soy sauce means 200g is roughly 190ml, but always use a scale for accuracy, especially in air fryer recipes."
faqQ2: "Can I use a tablespoon to measure 200g of soy sauce?"
faqA2: "While possible, it’s not the most accurate method. One tablespoon of soy sauce weighs about 15g, so 200g would be roughly 13 tablespoons. For precision, a kitchen scale is best, especially for air fryer cooking where balance matters."
faqQ3: "Does the brand of soy sauce affect the weight-to-ounce conversion?"
faqA3: "Most soy sauces have similar densities, so 200g will generally equal 7.05 ounces regardless of brand. However, thicker or artisanal varieties might vary slightly. Always check the label if you’re unsure."
faqQ4: "How long does 200g of soy sauce last once opened?"
faqA4: "An opened bottle of soy sauce lasts about 2-3 years if stored properly. Keep it sealed and away from direct sunlight. For best flavour in air fryer recipes, use within a year of opening."

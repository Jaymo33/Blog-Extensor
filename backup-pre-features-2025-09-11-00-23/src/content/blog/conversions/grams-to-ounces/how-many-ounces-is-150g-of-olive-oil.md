faqQ1: "Is 150g of olive oil the same as 150ml?"
faqA1: "No, 150g of olive oil is not the same as 150ml. While they’re close in volume, olive oil’s density means 150ml weighs about 138g. For precise air fryer cooking, always measure by weight when the recipe specifies grams."
faqQ2: "Can I use other oils if I don’t have olive oil?"
faqA2: "Yes, you can substitute other oils like vegetable or sunflower oil in equal weights. However, olive oil has a distinct flavour and smoke point, which may affect your dish’s taste and cooking time in the air fryer."
faqQ3: "How do I store leftover olive oil after measuring 150g?"
faqA3: "Store opened olive oil in a cool, dark place away from heat sources. Use within 3-6 months for best quality. For air fryer cooking, fresh oil gives better results than oil that’s been sitting for months."
faqQ4: "Why do some air fryer recipes use grams instead of ounces for oil?"
faqA4: "Many professional recipes use grams for greater precision, especially in baking. Since air fryers cook quickly, exact measurements ensure consistent results. Our conversion guide helps bridge the gap between metric and imperial measurements."

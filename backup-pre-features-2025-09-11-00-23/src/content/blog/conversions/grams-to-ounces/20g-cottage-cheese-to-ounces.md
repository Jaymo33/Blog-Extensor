faqQ1: "Is 20g of cottage cheese the same as 20ml?"
faqA1: "No, grams measure weight while millilitres measure volume. 20g of cottage cheese equals about 20ml in volume, but this can vary depending on how packed or drained the cheese is. For air fryer recipes, weight measurements (grams/ounces) are more accurate."
faqQ2: "Can I freeze 20g portions of cottage cheese for later use?"
faqA2: "Yes, you can freeze 20g (0.71oz) portions of cottage cheese in airtight containers for up to 2 months. However, the texture becomes slightly grainy after thawing, making it better suited for cooked dishes like air fryer recipes rather than eating fresh."
faqQ3: "How does 20g of cottage cheese compare to other cheeses in air fryer cooking?"
faqA3: "20g of cottage cheese (0.71oz) has higher moisture content than hard cheeses, so it behaves differently in the air fryer. It works well as a binder or moistening agent rather than for melting. For crispy results, you might need to combine it with breadcrumbs or flour."
faqQ4: "What's the best way to measure 20g of cottage cheese for air fryer recipes?"
faqA4: "The most accurate method is using digital kitchen scales. If unavailable, use measuring spoons - 20g equals about 2 slightly heaped tablespoons. For recipes where precision matters, like air fryer baking, weighing is always preferable to volume measurements."

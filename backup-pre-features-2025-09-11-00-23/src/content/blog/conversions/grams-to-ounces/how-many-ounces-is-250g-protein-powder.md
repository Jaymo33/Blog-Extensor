faqQ1: "Is 250g of protein powder the same as 8 ounces?"
faqA1: "No, 250g of protein powder equals approximately 8.82 ounces, not 8 ounces exactly. The slight difference matters in recipes where precision is key, especially in baking. Always use a scale for the most accurate measurement."
faqQ2: "How many scoops is 250g of protein powder?"
faqA2: "This depends on your scoop size. A standard protein powder scoop holds about 30g, so 250g would be roughly 8 scoops. However, scoop sizes vary by brand, so weighing with a scale is more reliable for accuracy."
faqQ3: "Can I use cups instead of ounces for 250g of protein powder?"
faqA3: "Cups measure volume, not weight, so it's not ideal. 250g of protein powder is about 2.5 cups, but density varies between brands. For consistent results, stick to weight measurements (grams or ounces) using a kitchen scale."
faqQ4: "Why do some UK protein powders list weights in grams and ounces?"
faqA4: "Many UK brands include both metrics to cater to different preferences and international buyers. Grams are standard in the UK, while ounces are commonly used in the US. Always check which unit your recipe uses to avoid confusion."

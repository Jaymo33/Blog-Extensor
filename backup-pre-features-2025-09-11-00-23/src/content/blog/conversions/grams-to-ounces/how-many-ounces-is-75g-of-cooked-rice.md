faqQ1: "Is 75g of cooked rice the same as uncooked rice in ounces?"
faqA1: "No, 75g of cooked rice is not the same as uncooked rice in ounces. Cooked rice absorbs water, increasing its weight. 75g of uncooked rice yields about 225g cooked, which equals roughly 8 ounces. Always check whether a recipe refers to cooked or uncooked rice."
faqQ2: "How many calories are in 75g of cooked rice?"
faqA2: "75g of cooked white rice contains approximately 97 calories, while brown rice has about 82 calories. The exact count depends on the rice variety and cooking method. For healthier options, try air frying rice with vegetables from our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable recipes</a>."
faqQ3: "Can I freeze 75g portions of cooked rice for later use?"
faqA3: "Absolutely! 75g portions are ideal for freezing. Spread cooked rice on a tray to cool, then pack into airtight containers or bags. When ready to use, reheat from frozen in your air fryer at 160°C for 5-7 minutes, stirring halfway."
faqQ4: "Why does my air fryer rice sometimes come out dry?"
faqA4: "Dry rice usually means insufficient water or overcooking. For perfect air fryer rice, use a 1:1.5 rice-to-water ratio and check doneness at 15 minutes. Covering tightly with foil is crucial to trap steam. For more troubleshooting, see our air fryer tips section."

<h3>How to measure 75g of cooked rice without scales</h3>  
<p>If you don't have kitchen scales, you can estimate 75g of cooked rice using household items. A heaped tablespoon of cooked rice is roughly 15g, so five tablespoons equal approximately 75g.

<h2>Tips for cooking rice in your air fryer</h2>  
<p>Cooking rice in an air fryer is quicker than traditional methods and yields fluffy results. Start by rinsing your rice to remove excess starch, then add it to an oven-safe dish with water. Cover tightly with foil to trap steam, and cook at 180°C for 15-20 minutes. For more tips, visit our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>homepage</a>.</p>  

<p>Leftover rice works brilliantly in the air fryer for crispy textures. Spread 75g (2.65 oz) of cooked rice thinly on a liner for even crisping. This method is perfect for making rice crackers or reheating fried rice.

<h3>Common mistakes when weighing cooked rice</h3>  
<p>One mistake is weighing rice while it's hot, which can affect accuracy due to steam. Always let rice cool slightly before measuring 75g for precise results. Another error is packing rice too tightly into measuring cups, which leads to overestimating portions. For consistent results, fluff rice with a fork before measuring.</p>

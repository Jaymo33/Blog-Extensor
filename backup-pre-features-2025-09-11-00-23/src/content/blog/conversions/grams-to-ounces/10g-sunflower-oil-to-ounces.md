<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air frying</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on precise cooking times and ingredient quantities to deliver perfect results. Too much or too little oil can affect crispiness, browning, and even cooking. Sunflower oil, with its high smoke point, is a popular choice for air frying, but getting the right amount is key. A slight variation in oil quantity can make the difference between soggy and crispy chips. That’s why converting 10g of sunflower oil to ounces (0.35 oz) helps maintain consistency in your dishes.</p>  

<p>If you’re experimenting with new recipes, accurate measurements ensure repeatable success. For example, a drizzle of sunflower oil over potatoes before air frying enhances crispiness without making them greasy.

<h3>How to measure 10g of sunflower oil without scales</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a kitchen scale, you can still measure 10g of sunflower oil using household items. One teaspoon holds roughly 5ml of oil, which is about 4.5g. Two teaspoons would give you close to 10g (approximately 0.35 ounces). Alternatively, a tablespoon holds around 15ml (13.5g), so slightly less than a tablespoon will do the trick. Remember, these are approximations, but they work well for most air fryer recipes.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for 10g of sunflower oil in air frying</h2>  
<p>Sunflower oil is versatile and works well in many air fryer dishes. A 10g portion (0.35 oz) is perfect for lightly coating vegetables like carrots, broccoli, or sweet potatoes before roasting. It’s also ideal for greasing the air fryer basket to prevent sticking. For meat lovers, a small amount of sunflower oil helps achieve a golden crust on chicken or turkey.

<p>Baking in the air fryer? Sunflower oil adds moisture to cakes and muffins without overpowering the flavour. Just 10g (0.35 oz) can make a noticeable difference in texture. Whether you’re making savoury or sweet dishes, precise oil measurements ensure even cooking and great results every time.</p>  

<h3>Converting other oil quantities for air frying</h3>  
<p>If your recipe calls for more or less than 10g of sunflower oil, you can easily adjust the conversion. For example, 20g is roughly 0.7 ounces, while 5g is about 0.18 ounces. Keeping a conversion chart handy saves time and avoids guesswork.

<h2>Sunflower oil vs other oils in air frying</h2>  
<p>Sunflower oil is a great choice for air frying due to its neutral taste and high smoke point. Compared to olive oil or butter, it’s less likely to burn at high temperatures. However, if you’re watching calories, remember that 10g of sunflower oil (0.35 oz) contains around 90 calories. For healthier alternatives, consider using an oil spray to evenly distribute smaller amounts.</p>  

<p>Different oils can also affect the flavour of your dish. While sunflower oil is mild, coconut or sesame oil adds distinct tastes. Experiment with small quantities to find your preference. For more air fryer tips, explore <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>.</p>

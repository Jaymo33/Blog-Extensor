faqQ1: "Can I use plain flour instead of cornflour for air fryer recipes?"
faqA1: "While you can substitute plain flour, cornflour gives a crispier texture in air fryer cooking. Plain flour absorbs more moisture, which may result in a softer coating. For best results, stick to cornflour when the recipe calls for it."
faqQ2: "How do I measure 125g of cornflour without a scale?"
faqA2: "One UK cup of cornflour is roughly 125g, but this can vary slightly. For accuracy, we recommend investing in digital scales. If using cups, fluff the cornflour first and spoon it gently into the measuring cup without packing it down."
faqQ3: "Why does my air fryer coating turn out soggy?"
faqA3: "Soggy coatings often result from overcrowding the air fryer basket or using too much oil. Ensure your 125g of cornflour coating is evenly distributed and cook in batches if necessary. Preheat your air fryer for optimal crispiness."
faqQ4: "Can I use cornflour for gluten-free air fryer baking?"
faqA4: "Yes, cornflour is naturally gluten-free and works well in air fryer recipes. Combine it with other gluten-free flours for better texture in baked goods. Always check labels to ensure no cross-contamination if you're cooking for coeliacs."

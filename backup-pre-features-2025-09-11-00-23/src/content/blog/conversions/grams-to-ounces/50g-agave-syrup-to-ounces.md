faqQ1: "Can I use honey instead of 50g of agave syrup in air fryer recipes?"
faqA1: "Yes, you can substitute honey for agave syrup, but the flavour and texture will differ slightly. Honey is thicker and sweeter, so you may need to adjust the quantity. Start with 45g of honey for every 50g of agave syrup and tweak to taste."
faqQ2: "How do I measure 50g of agave syrup if I don’t have a scale?"
faqA2: "You can use tablespoons as a rough guide—2.5 tablespoons of agave syrup is approximately 50g. For better accuracy, consider using a measuring jug with millilitre markings, as 50g of agave syrup is roughly 38ml."
faqQ3: "Does agave syrup affect air fryer cooking times?"
faqA3: "Agave syrup can caramelise quickly in the air fryer, so watch cooking times closely. If using it in glazes or marinades, reduce the temperature slightly to prevent burning. Always check your dish a few minutes earlier than the recipe suggests."
faqQ4: "Is 50g of agave syrup the same as 50ml?"
faqA4: "No, 50g of agave syrup is not the same as 50ml due to its density. Agave syrup is thicker than water, so 50g equals roughly 38ml. Always weigh it for precise measurements in recipes."

faqQ1: "Can I use tomato sauce instead of tomato paste in air fryer recipes?"
faqA1: "Tomato sauce can work as a substitute, but it’s much thinner than tomato paste. To replace 100g (3.53 oz) of tomato paste, use about 200g of tomato sauce and reduce other liquids in your recipe. Keep in mind the flavour will be less concentrated."
faqQ2: "How long does tomato paste last once opened?"
faqA2: "Opened tomato paste lasts about 5-7 days in the fridge if stored properly. For longer storage, transfer it to an airtight container or freeze it in portions. Always check for mould or off smells before using."
faqQ3: "Why is my air fryer dish too tangy with tomato paste?"
faqA3: "Tomato paste is highly concentrated, so using too much can make dishes overly tangy. Stick to the 100g (3.53 oz) measurement and balance it with a pinch of sugar or cream if needed."
faqQ4: "Can I make my own tomato paste for air fryer recipes?"
faqA4: "Yes! Simmer tomatoes for several hours until thickened, then blend into a paste. Homemade tomato paste is fresher but may require adjusting measurements since store-bought versions are more concentrated."

<p>Tomato paste is a staple in many air fryer recipes, from hearty stews to quick weeknight dinners. Its concentrated flavour means small adjustments can have a big impact. Measuring 100g of tomato paste correctly (3.53 oz) helps maintain balance in dishes like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipes</a> or <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable roasts</a>.</p>  

<h3>How to measure tomato paste without scales</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a kitchen scale, you can still measure 100g of tomato paste (3.53 oz) using tablespoons. One tablespoon of tomato paste weighs roughly 15g, so 100g is about 6.5 tablespoons. This method isn’t as precise but works in a pinch for recipes like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer sauces</a>.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for 100g of tomato paste in air fryer recipes</h2>  
<p>Tomato paste adds depth to many air fryer dishes. A 100g portion (3.53 oz) is perfect for making marinades, glazes, or even a rich base for air-fried meatballs. Its concentrated flavour means a little goes a long way, so accurate measuring ensures you don’t overpower your dish.</p>  

<p>For example, in <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/beef>beef recipes</a>, 100g of tomato paste (3.53 oz) can create a robust sauce or glaze. It’s also great for adding umami to vegetarian dishes, like air-fried stuffed peppers. Keeping your measurements precise ensures every bite is packed with balanced flavour.</p>  

<h3>Storing leftover tomato paste</h3>  
<p>If your recipe only uses part of a 100g (3.53 oz) tomato paste portion, store the rest in an airtight container in the fridge. It’ll keep for up to a week, ready for your next air fryer creation. For longer storage, freeze it in ice cube trays for easy portioning later.</p>

faqQ1: "How does 381°F compare to gas mark in a fan oven?"
faqA1: "381°F converts to 190°C in a fan oven, which is between gas mark 5 and 6. For precise air fryer cooking, we recommend using Celsius settings for better accuracy."
faqQ2: "Can I use the 381°F fan oven conversion for all air fryer models?"
faqA2: "Yes, the 381°F to 190°C conversion works for all air fryers, though cooking times may vary slightly between models. Always check food earlier than recipe times suggest."
faqQ3: "Why does my food cook faster at 381°F in the air fryer than my fan oven?"
faqA3: "Air fryers circulate hot air more efficiently than fan ovens, cooking food about 20% faster at the same temperature (190°C/381°F). This makes them energy-efficient but requires timing adjustments."
faqQ4: "What's the best way to convert other Fahrenheit temperatures to fan oven for air frying?"
faqA4: "Use our conversion chart at airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart or subtract 20°C from the conventional oven temperature when converting Fahrenheit to fan oven settings for air frying."

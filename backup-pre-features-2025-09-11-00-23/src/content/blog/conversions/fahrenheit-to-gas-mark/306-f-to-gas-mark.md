faqQ2: "Why do some recipes use Gas Mark instead of Fahrenheit?"
faqA2: "Gas Mark is traditionally used in UK recipes because it corresponds directly to the numbered dials on British gas ovens. It's become standard in many cookbooks, even as electric ovens and air fryers using Fahrenheit become more common."
faqQ3: "How do I convert other temperatures to Gas Mark for my air fryer?"
faqA3: "Use our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a> for common temperature equivalents. Most air fryers display Fahrenheit or Celsius, so you'll rarely need Gas Mark - but it's helpful for adapting traditional recipes."
faqQ4: "What's the best way to cook at 306 F in an air fryer without drying out food?"
faqA4: "For slow cooking at 306 F (Gas Mark 2), use the air fryer's dehydrate function if available, or place a small oven-safe dish of water in the basket. Check food frequently and consider covering with foil for the first half of cooking to retain moisture."

<h2>Why Convert 306 F to Gas Mark?</h2>
<p>Many UK recipes use Gas Mark settings, while others specify temperatures in Fahrenheit. Knowing how to convert 306 F to Gas Mark helps you follow recipes accurately. This is especially useful when using an air fryer, as some models allow you to switch between temperature scales. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we often see questions about these conversions, particularly for baking and roasting.</p>

<h2>How to Use 306 F in an Air Fryer</h2>
<p>Air fryers cook faster than conventional ovens, so you may need to adjust cooking times. At 306 F (Gas Mark 2), foods like chicken thighs or roasted vegetables will need less time than in an oven. Always preheat your air fryer for even cooking, and check food a few minutes early to avoid overcooking.</p>
<p>For example, if a recipe calls for 30 minutes at Gas Mark 2 in the oven, try 20-25 minutes in the air fryer.

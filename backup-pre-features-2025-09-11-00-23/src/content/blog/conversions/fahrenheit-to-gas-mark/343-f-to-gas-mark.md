<p>343 F converts to Gas Mark 4, which is a common setting for roasting and baking in both conventional ovens and air fryers. This temperature is perfect for dishes that require gentle, even cooking without excessive browning.

At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we specialise in helping you master these essential cooking conversions. Let's explore how this temperature works across different cooking methods.</p>

<h2>Understanding Gas Mark Conversions</h2>
<p>The Gas Mark scale is uniquely British, ranging from 1/4 to 9 with each full mark representing about 25-30°C. Gas Mark 4 specifically equates to 343 F or 173°C, making it a versatile mid-range temperature. Many classic British recipes, from shepherd's pie to Victoria sponge, call for this setting. When using an air fryer, you might need to adjust cooking times slightly as they cook more efficiently. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> provides detailed guidance for all your temperature conversion needs.</p>

<p>Historically, Gas Marks were developed when most British homes used gas ovens without precise temperature controls. Today, even with modern appliances, many traditional recipes still reference this system. When converting 343 F to Gas Mark for your air fryer, remember that the circulating hot air cooks food faster. This means you might need to reduce cooking times by about 20% compared to conventional oven recipes.

<h3>Why 343 F (Gas Mark 4) Works So Well</h3>
<p>This temperature hits the sweet spot for many cooking techniques. It's hot enough to create delicious browning through the Maillard reaction, yet gentle enough to prevent burning. Proteins like chicken and beef cook through evenly at 343 F to Gas Mark 4, while vegetables develop wonderful caramelised flavours. In air fryers, this setting is ideal for achieving crispy textures without drying out your food. The circulating air ensures even cooking on all sides, something traditional ovens can struggle with.</p>

<h2>Converting 343 F to Gas Mark for Different Appliances</h2>
<p>While 343 F always equals Gas Mark 4, how you apply this temperature varies by appliance. Conventional ovens may have hot spots, requiring occasional tray rotation. Fan-assisted ovens cook about 20°C hotter than their setting indicates, so you'd typically reduce the temperature accordingly. Air fryers, being compact and powerful, achieve excellent results at 343 F to Gas Mark 4 with shorter cooking times. For baking enthusiasts, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>cake recipes</a> showcase how to adapt traditional Gas Mark recipes for air fryers.</p>

<p>Modern combi ovens with air fryer functions often allow you to select either Fahrenheit or Gas Mark settings directly. If yours doesn't, remember that 343 F is your Gas Mark 4 equivalent. When cooking frozen foods at this temperature, you might need to extend the time slightly compared to fresh ingredients. Always check packaging for specific instructions, and consider our guide to <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>keeping your air fryer clean</a> between uses, especially when cooking greasy foods at higher temperatures.</p>

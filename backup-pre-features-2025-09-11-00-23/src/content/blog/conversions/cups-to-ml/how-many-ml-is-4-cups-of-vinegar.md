<p>4.0 cups of vinegar equals approximately 946 ml in the US measurement system and 1136 ml in the UK metric system. Whether you're preparing a tangy marinade or a pickling solution for your air fryer, knowing this conversion ensures accuracy in your recipes.

<h2>Understanding Cup to ml Conversions</h2>  
<p>Converting cups to millilitres can be tricky, especially when dealing with liquids like vinegar. The US and UK cup measurements differ slightly, which affects the final ml value. For US cups, 1 cup equals 237 ml, making 4.0 cups 946 ml. In the UK, 1 cup is 284 ml, so 4.0 cups amount to 1136 ml. Always check which measurement system your recipe follows to avoid errors.</p>  

<p>If you're using an air fryer, precise liquid measurements matter even more due to the appliance's rapid cooking process. Too much vinegar can overpower flavours, while too little might not achieve the desired acidity.

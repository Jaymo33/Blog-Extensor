<p>0.5 cups of heavy cream equals approximately 120 ml. This conversion is essential for precise baking and cooking, especially when using an air fryer where measurements can make or break a recipe. Whether you're whipping up a creamy sauce or baking a decadent dessert, knowing how to convert cups to millilitres ensures consistent results every time.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter</h2>
<p>When cooking or baking, especially in an air fryer, precision is crucial. Too much or too little heavy cream can alter the texture and taste of your dish. For example, adding 120 ml (0.5 cups) of heavy cream to a cake batter ensures the right moisture level, while deviating from this measurement could result in a dry or overly dense cake. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we emphasise the importance of accurate conversions to help you achieve perfect results every time.</p>
<p>Heavy cream is a staple in many recipes, from creamy pasta sauces to air-fried desserts. If you're working with a recipe that lists measurements in cups but prefer millilitres, this conversion is a game-changer. It eliminates guesswork and ensures your dishes turn out as intended, whether you're following a British or American recipe.</p>

<h2>How to Measure 0.5 Cups of Heavy Cream</h2>
<p>Measuring 0.5 cups of heavy cream is straightforward if you have the right tools. A liquid measuring cup with clear millilitre markings is ideal. Simply pour the heavy cream until it reaches the 120 ml line, and you're good to go. If you don't have a measuring cup, a kitchen scale can also be used—120 ml of heavy cream weighs roughly 116 grams.</p>
<p>For those who frequently cook with heavy cream, keeping a <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a> handy can save time and hassle.

<h3>Common Uses for 0.5 Cups of Heavy Cream</h3>
<p>Heavy cream is incredibly versatile, and 0.5 cups (120 ml) is a common measurement in many recipes. You might use it to make a rich Alfredo sauce for pasta, a velvety soup, or even a batch of air-fried scones. It's also a key ingredient in many desserts, such as custards and ice creams, where precise measurements are critical for the right consistency.</p>

<h3>Converting Other Measurements</h3>
<p>If your recipe calls for a different amount of heavy cream, you can easily scale the conversion. For example, 1 cup of heavy cream equals 240 ml, while 0.25 cups is 60 ml.

<h2>Tips for Working with Heavy Cream</h2>
<p>Heavy cream can be tricky to work with if not handled properly. When measuring 0.5 cups (120 ml), ensure the cream is cold if you're whipping it, as warmer cream won't hold its shape as well. If you're using it in a sauce, gently heat it to avoid curdling. For air fryer recipes, heavy cream can add richness to dishes like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>desserts</a> or creamy casseroles.</p>
<p>Storing heavy cream correctly is also important. Keep it refrigerated and use it within a few days of opening for the best results. If you're unsure whether your cream is still good, give it a sniff—sour cream will have an off smell.

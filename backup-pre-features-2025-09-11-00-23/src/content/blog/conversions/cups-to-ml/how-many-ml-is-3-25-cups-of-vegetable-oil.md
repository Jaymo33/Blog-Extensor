faqQ1: "Can I use 3.25 cups of vegetable oil in my air fryer for deep frying?"
faqA1: "While air fryers are designed to use minimal oil, 3.25 cups (768 ml) is excessive for most models. Air fryers typically require just 1-2 tablespoons of oil for most recipes. If you're aiming for deep-fried results, consider a traditional deep fryer instead."
faqQ2: "How do I convert 3.25 cups of vegetable oil to grams?"
faqA2: "The conversion depends on the oil's density. Vegetable oil weighs roughly 0.92 grams per ml, so 768 ml (3.25 cups) equals about 707 grams. However, for air fryer recipes, ml measurements are more practical than weight."
faqQ3: "Is 3.25 cups of vegetable oil the same in UK and US measurements?"
faqA3: "No, there's a slight difference. In the UK, 3.25 cups equal 812.5 ml, while in the US, it's 780 ml. Most recipes use the US standard (240 ml per cup), so 768 ml is the safest conversion unless specified otherwise."
faqQ4: "What can I make with 3.25 cups of vegetable oil in an air fryer?"
faqA4: "This amount is more suited for large batches or marinating. You could prepare multiple servings of crispy chicken, roasted potatoes, or even doughnuts. Always check your air fryer's capacity to avoid overfilling. For inspiration, browse our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe section</a>."

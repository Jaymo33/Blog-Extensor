faqQ1: "Is 1.5 cups of tomato sauce the same in the UK and US?"
faqA1: "No, there’s a slight difference. In the US, 1 cup equals 240 ml, while in the UK, it’s 284 ml. However, most modern recipes—especially online—use the US measurement. So, 1.5 US cups of tomato sauce is 355 ml, whereas 1.5 UK cups would be 426 ml. Always check which standard your recipe follows."
faqQ2: "Can I use passata instead of tomato sauce in air fryer recipes?"
faqA2: "Yes, passata works well as a substitute, but it’s thicker. For 1.5 cups (355 ml) of tomato sauce, you may need to thin passata with a little water or broth. Adjust cooking times slightly, as thicker sauces can affect how the air fryer circulates heat."
faqQ3: "How do I store leftover tomato sauce after measuring 1.5 cups?"
faqA3: "Transfer unused sauce to an airtight container and refrigerate for up to 5 days. For longer storage, freeze it in portions. Reheat gently in a saucepan or microwave before using it in your air fryer recipes."
faqQ4: "Why does my air fryer recipe turn out soggy with tomato sauce?"
faqA4: "Too much sauce can trap steam, preventing crispiness. Stick to 1.5 cups (355 ml) or less, and spread it evenly. For dishes like meatballs, lightly coat them instead of drowning them in sauce. Preheating the air fryer also helps achieve a better texture."

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Using the correct amount of tomato sauce—355 ml for 1.5 cups—ensures your dish isn’t too dry or overly saucy. Air fryers circulate hot air rapidly, so ingredient ratios directly impact texture and flavour. Too much liquid can lead to soggy results, while too little may dry out your food. For consistent outcomes, always measure sauces like tomato puree or passata accurately.

<p>Tomato sauce is a staple in many air fryer recipes, from meatball subs to stuffed peppers. If you’re scaling a recipe up or down, converting cups to millilitres (like 1.5 cups to 355 ml) ensures uniformity. This is especially useful when adapting American recipes, which often use cup measurements.

<h3>How to Measure Tomato Sauce Correctly</h3>  
<p>To measure 1.5 cups (355 ml) of tomato sauce, use a liquid measuring cup for accuracy. Pour the sauce to the 1.5-cup mark, or use a metric jug for millilitres.

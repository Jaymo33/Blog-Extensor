faqQ1: "Is 3.25 cups of half and half the same in the UK and US?"
faqA1: "Yes, 3.25 cups of half and half is the same volume in both the UK and US. However, cup sizes are standardized internationally for liquid measurements, so 3.25 cups will always equal approximately 768 ml, regardless of location."
faqQ2: "Can I use milk instead of half and half in air fryer recipes?"
faqA2: "You can substitute milk, but the texture and richness will differ. Half and half contains more fat, which contributes to creamier results. If using milk, consider adding a tablespoon of butter per cup to mimic the consistency."
faqQ3: "How do I store leftover half and half after measuring 3.25 cups?"
faqA3: "Store leftover half and half in an airtight container in the fridge for up to a week. Shake well before using, as separation can occur. For longer storage, freeze it in measured portions for future recipes."
faqQ4: "Why is my air fryer recipe too runny when using half and half?"
faqA4: "If your dish turns out runny, you may have added too much liquid. Double-check your measurements—3.25 cups should be exactly 768 ml. Alternatively, reduce cooking time or thicken the mixture with a starch like cornflour."

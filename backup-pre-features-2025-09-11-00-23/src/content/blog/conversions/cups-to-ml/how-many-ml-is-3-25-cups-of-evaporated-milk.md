faqQ1: "Is 3.25 cups of evaporated milk the same as regular milk in ml?"
faqA1: "No, evaporated milk is more concentrated, so 3.25 cups equals about 768 ml. Regular milk would measure slightly differently due to its higher water content. Always check your recipe for the correct type of milk."
faqQ2: "Can I use a kitchen scale to measure 3.25 cups of evaporated milk?"
faqA2: "Yes, but you’ll need to know the weight per ml. Evaporated milk weighs roughly 1.03 grams per ml, so 768 ml would be about 791 grams. A liquid measuring cup is still the easiest method for accuracy."
faqQ3: "Do UK and US measurements differ for evaporated milk?"
faqA3: "The cup size is the same (240 ml per cup), so 3.25 cups of evaporated milk equals 768 ml in both regions. However, always verify if the recipe uses metric or imperial measurements to avoid confusion."
faqQ4: "What if my recipe only lists evaporated milk in grams?"
faqA4: "Convert grams to ml using the density of evaporated milk (1.03 g/ml). For 3.25 cups (768 ml), that’s roughly 791 grams. If your recipe lists grams, weigh it directly for the most precise measurement."

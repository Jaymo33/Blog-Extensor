faqQ1: "Is 3.75 cups of cream the same in the UK and US?"
faqA1: "While UK and US cup sizes differ slightly (284.13 ml vs. 236.59 ml), most modern recipes use the US standard. For 3.75 cups of cream, stick to 887.21 ml to ensure consistency in air fryer cooking."
faqQ2: "Can I use a kitchen scale instead of measuring cups for cream?"

faqQ3: "What if I only have millilitre markings on my measuring jug?"
faqA3: "No problem—simply measure out 887 ml for 3.75 cups of cream. The slight difference (0.21 ml) won’t affect most air fryer recipes. For baking, though, aim for the exact amount."
faqQ4: "How do I convert 3.75 cups of cream to fluid ounces?"
faqA4: "3.75 cups of cream equals about 30 fluid ounces (fl oz). This conversion is handy for older recipes or when using imperial measurements. Just remember: 1 cup = 8 fl oz."

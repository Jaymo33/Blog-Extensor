faqQ1: "Is 3.0 cups of olive oil the same in ml for all types of oil?"
faqA1: "No, different oils have slightly varying densities, but for most cooking oils like olive, vegetable, or sunflower oil, 1 cup equals roughly 237 ml. So, 3.0 cups would still be approximately 710 ml. Always check specific oil types if precision is critical."
faqQ2: "Can I use a kitchen scale instead of measuring cups for olive oil?"
faqA2: "Yes! One ml of olive oil weighs about 0.92 grams, so 710 ml would be roughly 653 grams. Using a scale can be more accurate, especially for baking. Most digital scales have a ml option for liquids like oil."
faqQ3: "Why do some recipes use cups instead of ml for oil measurements?"
faqA3: "Cups are more common in American recipes, while ml are standard in the UK and Europe. Many cooks find cups convenient for quick measuring, but ml provide greater precision. Always convert if your tools use different units."
faqQ4: "How long does 3.0 cups (710 ml) of olive oil last in an air fryer?"
faqA4: "You’d rarely use that much oil at once in an air fryer—it’s designed for minimal oil. However, 710 ml could last months if used sparingly for coating food. Store olive oil in a cool, dark place to maintain freshness."

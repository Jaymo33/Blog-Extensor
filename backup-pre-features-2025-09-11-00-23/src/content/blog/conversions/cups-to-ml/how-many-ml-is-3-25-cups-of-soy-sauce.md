faqA1: "Yes, 3.25 cups of soy sauce equals approximately 768.91 ml in both the UK and USA. Cup measurements are standardised in cooking, so the conversion remains consistent regardless of location. However, always double-check your recipe’s origin to ensure accuracy."
faqQ2: "Can I use a kitchen scale to measure 3.25 cups of soy sauce in ml?"

faqQ3: "What’s the best way to reduce saltiness if I’ve added too much soy sauce?"
faqA3: "If your dish is too salty, balance it by adding a sweetener like honey or sugar, or dilute it with a bit of water or unsalted broth. For air fryer recipes, you can also add more of the main ingredient (e.g., chicken or vegetables) to spread the flavour."
faqQ4: "How long does opened soy sauce last in the fridge?"
faqA4: "Opened soy sauce can last up to a year in the fridge if stored in an airtight container. Over time, its flavour may weaken, so it’s best used within 6 months for optimal taste in your air fryer recipes. Always check for off smells or changes in colour before using."

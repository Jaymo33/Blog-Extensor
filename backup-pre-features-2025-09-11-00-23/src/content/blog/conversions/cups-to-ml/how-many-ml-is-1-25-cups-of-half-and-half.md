faqQ1: "Is 1.25 cups of half and half the same in the UK and US?"
faqA1: "Yes, 1.25 cups of half and half equals approximately 296 ml in both the UK and US. While cup sizes can vary slightly by country, the standard metric conversion remains consistent for liquid measurements like half and half."
faqQ2: "Can I use milk instead of half and half in air fryer recipes?"
faqA2: "You can substitute milk for half and half, but the texture and richness of your dish may change. Half and half contains more fat, which adds creaminess. For best results, stick to the recipe’s recommended measurements or adjust other ingredients accordingly."
faqQ3: "How do I measure 1.25 cups of half and half without a measuring cup?"
faqA3: "If you don’t have a measuring cup, use a kitchen scale. Since 1 ml of half and half weighs roughly 1 gram, 296 ml equals about 296 grams. Alternatively, use a tablespoon (15 ml) and measure out 20 tablespoons for 300 ml, which is close enough for most recipes."
faqQ4: "Why is my air fryer recipe too runny when using half and half?"
faqA4: "If your dish turns out runny, you may have added too much half and half or not cooked it long enough. Always measure liquids carefully and follow cooking times. For thicker sauces, consider reducing the liquid or adding a thickening agent like cornstarch."

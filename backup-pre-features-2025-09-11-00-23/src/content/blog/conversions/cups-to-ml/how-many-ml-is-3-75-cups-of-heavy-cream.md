faqQ1: "Is 3.75 cups of heavy cream the same in the UK and US?"
faqA1: "While UK and US cups differ slightly (1 UK cup = 284 ml, 1 US cup = 236.59 ml), 3.75 cups of heavy cream is close enough for most recipes. The difference is minimal, so you can use 887 ml as a standard conversion for air fryer cooking."
faqQ2: "Can I use a kitchen scale instead of measuring cups for heavy cream?"
faqA2: "Yes! Heavy cream weighs roughly 240 grams per cup, so 3.75 cups would be about 900 grams. A kitchen scale is often more accurate than volume measurements, especially for baking."
faqQ3: "How long does 3.75 cups of heavy cream last in the fridge?"
faqA3: "Once opened, heavy cream lasts 3–5 days in the fridge. If you’ve measured 887 ml (3.75 cups) but don’t need it all, freeze portions in airtight containers for up to 2 months."
faqQ4: "What can I substitute for heavy cream in air fryer recipes?"
faqA4: "For a lighter option, try half-and-half or evaporated milk mixed with butter. Coconut cream works for dairy-free recipes. Note that substitutes may alter texture, so adjust cooking times slightly."

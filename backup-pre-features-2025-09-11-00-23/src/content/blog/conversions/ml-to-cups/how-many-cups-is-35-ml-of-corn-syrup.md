faqQ1: "Can I use honey instead of corn syrup in a 35 ml measurement?"
faqA1: "Yes, you can substitute honey for corn syrup in a 1:1 ratio, but keep in mind honey is sweeter and thicker. For 35 ml of corn syrup, use 35 ml of honey, but reduce other sugars in the recipe slightly. Honey also browns faster in an air fryer, so lower the temperature by 5–10°C to avoid burning."
faqQ2: "How do I clean my air fryer after using corn syrup?"
faqA2: "Corn syrup can leave sticky residues. Once the air fryer cools, wipe the basket with warm, soapy water or use our recommended <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner</a>. For stubborn spots, a paste of baking soda and water works well. Avoid abrasive scrubbers to protect non-stick coatings."
faqQ3: "Is 35 ml of corn syrup the same as golden syrup?"
faqA3: "No, corn syrup and golden syrup have different consistencies and flavours. While both are liquid sweeteners, 35 ml of golden syrup is denser and has a stronger taste. If substituting, adjust other liquids in the recipe slightly to compensate for the texture difference."
faqQ4: "Why do some air fryer recipes use small amounts like 35 ml of corn syrup?"
faqA4: "Air fryers require less liquid than traditional ovens due to their compact size and rapid air circulation. Using 35 ml of corn syrup (about 1/8 cup) ensures even distribution without making foods soggy. It’s perfect for glazes or binding coatings, like in <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cookies>cookie recipes</a>."

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>
<p>Precision is key when using an air fryer, especially with sticky ingredients like corn syrup. Too much or too little can alter the texture and taste of your dish. For example, a <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>glazed salmon recipe</a> might call for 35 ml of corn syrup to achieve that perfect caramelised finish. Measuring correctly ensures consistency, whether you’re cooking for one or meal prepping for the week.</p>
<p>Air fryers cook faster than conventional ovens, so small measurement errors can have a bigger impact. If you’re converting a traditional recipe to air fryer-friendly proportions, tools like our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> can help. Remember, 35 ml of corn syrup is just over 1/8 cup, but using a measuring spoon for the extra teaspoon ensures accuracy.</p>

<h2>How to Measure 35 ml of Corn Syrup Without a Measuring Cup</h2>
<p>Don’t have a measuring cup? No problem. A standard tablespoon holds about 15 ml, so 35 ml of corn syrup is roughly 2 tablespoons plus 1 teaspoon. For thicker syrups, lightly grease the spoon to help it slide off easily. This trick works well for <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert recipes</a> like sticky toffee pudding or air-fried doughnuts.</p>
<p>If you’re using a kitchen scale, 35 ml of corn syrup weighs around 47 grams. This method is ideal for those who prefer weight-based measurements for baking. Just pour slowly until you hit the mark, and you’re good to go.

<h3>Common Recipes Using 35 ml of Corn Syrup</h3>
<p>Many air fryer recipes call for small amounts of corn syrup. For instance, a <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>sponge cake</a> might use 35 ml to keep it moist, while a glaze for roasted vegetables could require the same measurement. The versatility of corn syrup makes it a staple in both sweet and savoury dishes, so mastering this conversion is a game-changer.</p>

<h2>UK vs. US Cup Measurements for Corn Syrup</h2>
<p>In the UK, a standard cup is 250 ml, while in the US, it’s 240 ml. This slight difference means 35 ml of corn syrup is 0.14 UK cups or 0.15 US cups. For most recipes, the variance is negligible, but for precision baking, it’s worth noting. Always check whether your recipe uses metric or imperial measurements to avoid confusion.</p>
<p>If you’re adapting a US recipe for your UK air fryer, rounding 35 ml of corn syrup to 1/8 cup plus a teaspoon works perfectly.

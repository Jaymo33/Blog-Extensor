faqQ1: "Is 985 ml of oat milk the same as 1 litre?"
faqA1: "No, 985 ml of oat milk is just under a litre. A full litre is 1000 ml, so 985 ml is 15 ml less. This small difference might not matter in some recipes, but for precise baking, it's best to measure accurately."
faqQ2: "Can I use a regular cup to measure 985 ml of oat milk?"
faqA2: "Yes, but ensure you know whether your recipe uses US or UK cup measurements. A US cup is 240 ml, so 985 ml equals roughly 4.16 cups. A UK cup is 284 ml, making 985 ml about 3.46 cups. For best results, use a measuring jug."
faqQ3: "Does oat milk measure the same as dairy milk in cups?"
faqA3: "Yes, oat milk has a similar density to dairy milk, so 985 ml of oat milk equals the same volume in cups as cow's milk. However, oat milk is slightly thinner, which may affect texture in some recipes."
faqQ4: "How can I measure 985 ml of oat milk without a measuring jug?"
faqA4: "If you don't have a jug, use standard cups. In the US, 4 cups plus 2 tablespoons will get you close to 985 ml. In the UK, use 3 and a half cups. For precision, a kitchen scale set to grams (985g) also works."

faqQ1: "Is 510 ml of condensed milk the same as 2 cups?"
faqA1: "No, 510 ml of condensed milk is approximately 2.15 cups. While 2 cups equal 473 ml, the extra 37 ml in 510 ml makes a slight but noticeable difference in recipes, especially in air fryer baking where precision matters."
faqQ2: "Can I use evaporated milk instead of condensed milk for 510 ml?"

faqQ3: "How do I measure 510 ml of condensed milk if I don’t have a measuring jug?"

faqQ4: "Does the cup measurement for 510 ml of condensed milk vary by country?"
faqA4: "Yes, US cups (237 ml) and UK cups (284 ml) differ slightly. For 510 ml, the US measurement is 2.15 cups, while the UK equivalent is about 1.8 cups. Always check which cup standard your recipe uses for the best results."

faqQ1: "Is 760 ml of chicken broth the same as 3 cups?"

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>
<p>Air fryers rely on even heat distribution, so using the right amount of liquid is crucial. Too much chicken broth can make dishes soggy, while too little may dry them out.

<p>Many air fryer recipes, especially those for soups or stews, call for chicken broth. Knowing that 760 ml of chicken broth is roughly 3.2 US cups simplifies scaling recipes. If you're adapting a family favourite, this conversion ensures you won’t over or under-season your dish.

<h3>US vs. UK Cup Measurements for Chicken Broth</h3>
<p>In the US, 1 cup equals 240 ml, so 760 ml of chicken broth is about 3.2 cups. In the UK, where 1 cup is 250 ml, 760 ml converts to 3.3 cups. This small difference matters in baking or slow-cooked air fryer dishes. Always check which measurement system your recipe uses to avoid mistakes.</p>

<h2>How to Measure 760 ml of Chicken Broth Without a Scale</h2>
<p>If you don’t have a measuring jug, use standard cups to portion 760 ml of chicken broth. Fill a US cup three times (720 ml) and add two tablespoons (40 ml) to reach 760 ml. For UK cups, measure three full cups (750 ml) and add two teaspoons (10 ml). This method works well for air fryer recipes requiring precision.</p>

<p>For dishes like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken-based meals</a>, accurate broth measurements enhance flavour. Too much liquid can dilute spices, while too little may leave meat tough. If you’re using store-bought broth, check the label—some brands list both ml and cup measurements for convenience.</p>

faqQ1: "Is 935 ml of vegetable oil the same as 4 cups?"
faqA1: "Not exactly. 935 ml of vegetable oil equals approximately 3.95 cups in the US measurement system (where 1 cup is 237 ml). In the UK, where 1 cup is 250 ml, it's closer to 3.74 cups. For most air fryer recipes, this small difference won't significantly impact the results."
faqQ2: "Can I use less oil than 935 ml in my air fryer?"
faqA2: "Yes, air fryers require far less oil than traditional frying methods. While 935 ml might be used for deep-frying, air fryers typically need just 1-2 tablespoons for most recipes. Adjust based on the dish, but always follow your recipe's guidelines for best results."
faqQ3: "How do I measure 935 ml of vegetable oil without a measuring jug?"
faqA3: "If you don't have a measuring jug, use standard cups. Since 1 cup is roughly 237 ml (US), 935 ml equals just under 4 cups. For more precision, use tablespoons (15 ml each) to fine-tune the measurement. Alternatively, check our conversion chart for quick reference."
faqQ4: "Does vegetable oil type affect the conversion from ml to cups?"
faqA4: "No, the type of vegetable oil doesn't change the ml-to-cup conversion. Whether it's sunflower, rapeseed, or blended oil, 935 ml will always equal approximately 3.95 cups. However, different oils have varying smoke points, which may affect air fryer cooking temperatures."

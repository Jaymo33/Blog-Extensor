faqQ1: "Can I use olive oil instead of vegetable oil for 135 ml in cups?"
faqA1: "Yes, you can substitute olive oil for vegetable oil in a 1:1 ratio. However, olive oil has a stronger flavour and lower smoke point, which may affect taste and cooking performance in air fryer recipes. For high-heat frying, vegetable oil is often preferred."
faqQ2: "How do I measure 135 ml of vegetable oil without a measuring jug?"
faqA2: "Use a kitchen scale to weigh 124 grams of oil (equivalent to 135 ml), or count 9 level tablespoons (15 ml each). A standard US cup is 240 ml, so fill it just over halfway for 135 ml. For more measurement hacks, visit our conversion guide."

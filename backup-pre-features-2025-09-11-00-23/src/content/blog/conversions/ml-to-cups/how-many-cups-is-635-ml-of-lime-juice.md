faqA3: "635 ml of lime juice equals roughly 42.3 tablespoons or 127 teaspoons. This conversion is handy for smaller batches or adjusting recipes. For precise air fryer cooking, use a digital scale or liquid measuring cup."
faqQ4: "Why does my lime juice measurement seem off when using an air fryer?"

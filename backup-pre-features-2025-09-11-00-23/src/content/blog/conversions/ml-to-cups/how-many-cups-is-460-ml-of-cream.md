faqQ1: "Is 460 ml of cream the same as 2 cups?"
faqA1: "No, 460 ml of cream is approximately 1.94 cups. While it’s close to 2 cups, the slight difference can affect recipes, especially in baking or air fryer cooking where precision matters. Always measure carefully for the best results."
faqQ2: "Can I use a regular drinking cup to measure 460 ml of cream?"
faqA2: "It’s not recommended, as drinking cups vary in size. For accuracy, use a standard metric or US measuring cup. If you don’t have one, a kitchen scale is a reliable alternative to ensure you get the right amount."

faqA3: "No, the conversion remains the same whether you’re using single, double, or whipping cream. However, the fat content may affect the recipe’s texture, so choose the right type for your dish."
faqQ4: "How can I measure 460 ml of cream without a jug or scale?"
faqA4: "You can use tablespoons as a rough guide—1 tablespoon is about 15 ml, so 460 ml would be roughly 31 tablespoons. This method isn’t as precise as using a measuring cup or scale but works in a pinch."

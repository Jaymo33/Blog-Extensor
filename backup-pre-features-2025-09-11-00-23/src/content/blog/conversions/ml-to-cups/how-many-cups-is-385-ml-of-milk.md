<h2>Why Accurate Milk Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Getting the right amount of milk ensures your recipes turn out perfectly. Too much or too little can affect texture, rise, and flavour.

<p>Many air fryer recipes, like our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>air fryer cakes</a>, rely on exact liquid ratios. Milk adds moisture, and 385 ml is a common quantity in European recipes. Knowing the cup equivalent saves time and avoids kitchen mishaps.</p>  

<h3>US vs. UK Cup Measurements</h3>  
<p>The slight difference between US and UK cups matters when converting 385 ml of milk. US cups are 240 ml, while UK metric cups are 250 ml. For 385 ml, that’s 1.63 US cups or 1.54 UK cups. Always check your recipe’s origin to pick the right conversion.</p>  

<h2>How to Measure 385 ml of Milk Without a Scale</h2>  
<p>If you don’t have a measuring jug, use a standard cup and some maths. For 385 ml of milk, fill a US cup to the top (240 ml), then add another 145 ml (about half a cup plus two tablespoons). For UK cups, it’s one full cup (250 ml) plus 135 ml (roughly half a cup plus a tablespoon).</p>  

<p>For air fryer recipes like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>pancakes or muffins</a>, eyeballing isn’t ideal. Invest in a liquid measuring cup for accuracy. A small error in 385 ml of milk could mean dense baked goods or split sauces.</p>

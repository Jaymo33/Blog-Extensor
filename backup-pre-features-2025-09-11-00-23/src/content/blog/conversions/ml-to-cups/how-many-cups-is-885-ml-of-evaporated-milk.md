faqQ1: "Is 885 ml of evaporated milk the same as regular milk in cups?"
faqA1: "No, evaporated milk is more concentrated than regular milk because about 60% of the water has been removed. While 885 ml of evaporated milk converts to roughly 3.74 US cups, if you substitute regular milk, you'll need to adjust other ingredients to compensate for the extra liquid."
faqQ2: "Can I use a can of evaporated milk instead of measuring 885 ml?"
faqA2: "Yes, many standard cans of evaporated milk hold around 410-415 ml, so two cans would give you approximately 820-830 ml. This is close enough to 885 ml for most recipes, but for precise baking, it's best to measure accurately."
faqQ3: "How do I convert 885 ml of evaporated milk to fluid ounces?"
faqA3: "885 ml is roughly 29.9 fluid ounces in the US measurement system. This conversion is useful if you're working with a recipe that uses ounces instead of cups or millilitres."
faqQ4: "Does the fat content affect the conversion of 885 ml of evaporated milk to cups?"
faqA4: "No, the fat content doesn't change the volume conversion. Whether you're using full-fat or reduced-fat evaporated milk, 885 ml will still equal approximately 3.74 US cups. However, the fat content may affect the recipe's final texture and taste."

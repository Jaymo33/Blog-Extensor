faqQ1: "Is 535 ml of evaporated milk the same as fresh milk in cups?"
faqA1: "No, evaporated milk is concentrated, so 535 ml of it is thicker than the same volume of fresh milk. However, the cup measurement remains the same—approximately 2.26 US cups or 2.11 UK cups. Always use evaporated milk as specified in recipes for best results."
faqQ2: "Can I use a regular cup to measure 535 ml of evaporated milk?"
faqA2: "While a standard drinking cup holds roughly 240–250 ml, it's not precise enough for baking or air fryer recipes. For accuracy, use a liquid measuring jug to measure 535 ml of evaporated milk. This ensures your dish turns out perfectly every time."
faqQ3: "How does 535 ml of evaporated milk affect air fryer cooking times?"
faqA3: "Evaporated milk can influence cooking times due to its richness. If your recipe calls for 535 ml, ensure it's evenly distributed to avoid uneven cooking. Check recipes on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> for guidance on adjusting times for creamy dishes."
faqQ4: "What if I only have a 400 ml can of evaporated milk for a 535 ml recipe?"
faqA4: "You can use two 400 ml cans and measure out 535 ml, storing the rest. Alternatively, adjust the recipe proportions accordingly. For precise conversions, refer to <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> to maintain balance in your dish."

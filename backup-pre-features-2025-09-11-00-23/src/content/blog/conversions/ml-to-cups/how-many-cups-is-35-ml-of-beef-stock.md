<p>35 ml of beef stock equals approximately 0.15 cups in the UK or 0.148 cups in the US. Whether you're preparing a rich gravy or a flavourful stew, getting the measurement right is key to perfect results. This guide will help you convert 35 ml of beef stock to cups accurately, ensuring your air fryer recipes turn out just as intended.</p>  

<h2>Understanding the Conversion</h2>  
<p>Converting millilitres to cups can be tricky, especially when dealing with small quantities like 35 ml of beef stock. In the UK, 1 cup is 250 ml, making 35 ml roughly 0.15 cups. In the US, where 1 cup is 236.59 ml, 35 ml is about 0.148 cups. This slight difference matters in baking and cooking, so always check which measurement system your recipe uses.</p>  

<p>For air fryer recipes, precision is crucial. Too much or too little liquid can affect texture and cooking time. If you're using a recipe from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, it likely follows UK measurements. However, if you're adapting a US recipe, adjust accordingly to avoid mishaps.</p>  

<h3>Why Accurate Measurements Matter</h3>  
<p>Beef stock adds depth to dishes, but over-pouring can make them too salty or watery. Measuring 35 ml of beef stock correctly ensures balanced flavours.

<h2>Tools for Measuring 35 ml of Beef Stock</h2>

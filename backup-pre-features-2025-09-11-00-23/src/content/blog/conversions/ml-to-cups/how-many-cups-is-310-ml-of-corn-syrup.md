faqQ1: "Is 310 ml of corn syrup the same as 1.31 cups?"
faqA1: "Yes, 310 ml of corn syrup is approximately 1.31 cups. This conversion is based on the US standard cup measurement of 240 ml. If you're using a UK cup (250 ml), it would be roughly 1.24 cups. For most recipes, this small difference won't affect the outcome."
faqQ2: "Can I use a kitchen scale to measure 310 ml of corn syrup?"
faqA2: "Absolutely! Since corn syrup has a consistent density, you can weigh it for accuracy. One milliliter of corn syrup weighs about 1.42 grams, so 310 ml would be around 440 grams. This method is especially useful if you're scaling recipes or don't have a liquid measuring cup handy."
faqQ3: "What can I substitute for 310 ml of corn syrup in a recipe?"
faqA3: "You can use honey, maple syrup, or golden syrup as substitutes, but keep in mind they'll change the flavor. Adjust the quantity slightly, as these alternatives are often sweeter or thicker than corn syrup. For baking, agave nectar or glucose syrup can also work well."
faqQ4: "How do I prevent corn syrup from sticking to the measuring cup?"
faqA4: "Lightly greasing the measuring cup with oil or cooking spray helps the syrup slide out easily. You can also warm the syrup slightly before measuring, as it becomes less viscous. A silicone spatula is great for scraping out every last bit without waste."

faqQ1: "Is 285 ml of balsamic vinegar the same in the UK and USA?"
faqA1: "Yes, 285 ml of balsamic vinegar is the same volume in both the UK and USA. However, cup sizes can vary slightly. In the UK, 1 cup is 250 ml, while in the USA, it’s 240 ml. For 285 ml, this means roughly 1.14 UK cups or 1.2 US cups."
faqQ2: "Can I substitute another vinegar for balsamic vinegar in air fryer recipes?"
faqA2: "You can substitute red wine vinegar or apple cider vinegar, but the flavour will differ. Balsamic vinegar is sweeter and thicker, so adjust the quantity and add a bit of honey or sugar if needed. For best results, stick to balsamic vinegar in recipes like glazes."
faqQ3: "How do I clean my air fryer after using balsamic vinegar?"
faqA3: "Balsamic vinegar can leave sticky residue. Use warm soapy water or our recommended <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner</a> to wipe down the basket and tray. Avoid abrasive scrubbers to prevent damage to non-stick surfaces."
faqQ4: "What’s the best way to store leftover balsamic vinegar?"
faqA4: "Store opened balsamic vinegar in a cool, dark place with the lid tightly sealed. It can last up to 3 years, but for best flavour, use it within a year. Avoid refrigeration as it can thicken the vinegar."

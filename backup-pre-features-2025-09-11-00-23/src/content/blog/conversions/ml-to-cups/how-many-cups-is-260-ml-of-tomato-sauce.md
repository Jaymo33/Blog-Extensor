faqQ1: "Is 260 ml of tomato sauce the same in the UK and USA?"
faqA1: "Yes, 260 ml is a metric measurement and equals the same volume in both the UK and USA. However, cup sizes can vary slightly. In the UK, 260 ml is about 1.1 cups, while US cups are roughly 240 ml each. Always check your recipe’s origin for accuracy."
faqQ2: "Can I use a tablespoon to measure 260 ml of tomato sauce?"
faqA2: "While possible, it’s not the most efficient method. One tablespoon is about 15 ml, so you’d need around 17 tablespoons for 260 ml. Using a measuring cup or jug is quicker and more precise for air fryer recipes."
faqQ3: "How does 260 ml of tomato sauce affect cooking time in an air fryer?"
faqA3: "Saucy dishes may need slightly longer in the air fryer to evaporate excess moisture. For 260 ml of sauce, preheat your air fryer and stir ingredients halfway for even cooking. Thicker sauces cook faster than watery ones."
faqQ4: "What if my recipe calls for cups but I only have ml measurements?"
faqA4: "Use the conversion 260 ml ≈ 1.1 cups. For other amounts, refer to a conversion chart or online tool. Air fryer recipes often need precise measurements, so double-check to avoid under or over-saucing your dish."

faqQ1: "Can I use evaporated milk instead of heavy cream for 410 ml?"
faqA1: "Yes, you can substitute evaporated milk for heavy cream, but the texture and taste will differ. For 410 ml of heavy cream, use 410 ml of evaporated milk mixed with 2 tablespoons of butter to mimic the richness. Keep in mind that evaporated milk is slightly sweeter, so adjust seasonings accordingly."
faqQ2: "How do I measure 410 ml of heavy cream without a measuring cup?"
faqA2: "If you don’t have a measuring cup, use a kitchen scale. Heavy cream weighs about 0.965 grams per millilitre, so 410 ml would be roughly 396 grams. Alternatively, use a standard drinking glass, but note that sizes vary, so this method is less precise."
faqQ3: "Does heavy cream whip the same at 410 ml as it does at smaller amounts?"
faqA3: "Yes, 410 ml of heavy cream will whip just like smaller amounts, provided it’s cold and you use the right technique. Chill your bowl and beaters beforehand, and whip at medium speed until soft peaks form. Larger quantities might take slightly longer to whip."
faqQ4: "Can I freeze 410 ml of heavy cream if I don’t use it all?"
faqA4: "Yes, you can freeze 410 ml of heavy cream for up to 3 months. Thaw it in the fridge overnight and give it a good stir before using. Note that frozen heavy cream may separate slightly, so it’s best used in cooked dishes rather than for whipping."

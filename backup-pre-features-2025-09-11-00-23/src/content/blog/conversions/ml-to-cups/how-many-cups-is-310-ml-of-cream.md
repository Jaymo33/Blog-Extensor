faqQ1: "Is 310 ml of cream the same as 1.5 cups?"
faqA1: "No, 310 ml of cream is not the same as 1.5 cups. In the UK, it's approximately 1.31 cups, and in the US, it's about 1.28 cups. Always check your recipe's measurement system for accuracy."
faqQ2: "Can I use 310 ml of double cream instead of single cream in a recipe?"
faqA2: "Yes, but you may need to adjust other liquids in the recipe. Double cream is thicker and richer, so using the same volume (310 ml) could make the dish heavier. Consider reducing other fats slightly for balance."
faqQ3: "How do I measure 310 ml of cream without a measuring cup?"
faqA3: "You can use a kitchen scale for precision—310 ml of cream weighs roughly 310 grams. Alternatively, use a tablespoon (15 ml per tbsp) and measure out about 20.5 tablespoons for 310 ml."
faqQ4: "Does the type of cream affect the ml-to-cups conversion?"
faqA4: "The conversion from ml to cups is based on volume, so the type of cream doesn't change the measurement. However, thicker creams like double cream may pack differently, so always measure carefully for best results."

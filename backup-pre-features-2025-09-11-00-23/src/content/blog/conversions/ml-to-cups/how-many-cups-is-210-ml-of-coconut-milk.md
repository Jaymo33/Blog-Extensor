<p>210 ml of coconut milk is approximately 0.89 cups (just under 1 cup). This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes, where precise measurements can make or break a dish. Whether you’re whipping up a curry, baking a cake, or making a creamy sauce, knowing how to convert millilitres to cups ensures consistency. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we’re all about making cooking easier, so let’s dive into the details.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on even heat distribution, so ingredient ratios are crucial. Too much or too little liquid, like coconut milk, can affect texture and cooking time. For example, adding 210 ml of coconut milk (0.89 cups) instead of a full cup might seem minor, but it can alter the moisture balance in baked goods or sauces. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for other common measurements.</p>  

<p>Recipes from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> often use metric measurements, but if your measuring tools are in cups, this guide is a lifesaver. Coconut milk’s richness means even small deviations can impact flavour, so precision matters. Whether you’re making a Thai curry or a dairy-free dessert, 210 ml of coconut milk translates to just under 1 cup.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure 210 ml of Coconut Milk Without a Scale</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a metric measuring jug, use a standard US cup (240 ml) and fill it just below the rim for 210 ml. For UK cups (250 ml), fill it to about 85% capacity. Shake the can of coconut milk well before measuring, as it separates. Stirring ensures an even consistency, especially for recipes like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>air fryer desserts</a> where texture is key.</p>  

<h2>Common Recipes Using 210 ml of Coconut Milk</h2>  
<p>Many air fryer recipes call for 210 ml of coconut milk, from creamy soups to marinades. For instance, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>air fryer chicken curry</a> uses this amount for the perfect sauce consistency. Coconut milk’s fat content also helps crisp foods like tofu or vegetables when used in batters. Remember, 210 ml equals 0.89 cups, so adjust your measurements accordingly.</p>  

<p>Baking with coconut milk? A <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>vegan air fryer cake</a> might require 210 ml for moisture without dairy. The slight reduction from a full cup prevents sogginess. Always use unsweetened coconut milk unless the recipe specifies otherwise.

<h3>UK vs. US Cup Measurements for Coconut Milk</h3>  
<p>In the UK, a cup is 250 ml, while in the US, it’s 240 ml. This means 210 ml of coconut milk is 0.84 UK cups or 0.89 US cups. Most recipes on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> use metric measurements, but if you’re adapting a US recipe, note the difference. For air fryer cooking, stick to one system to avoid inconsistencies.</p>

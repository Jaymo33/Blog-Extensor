Whether you're whipping up a cake or a creamy sauce, knowing how to convert millilitres to cups ensures your dish turns out perfectly.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of oat milk can make or break your recipe. Too little, and your baked goods might turn out dry. Too much, and they could become soggy.

<h2>Converting 235 ml of Oat Milk to Cups</h2>

<h3>Why Measure Oat Milk Accurately?</h3>
<p>Oat milk's consistency can vary between brands, so measuring 460 ml precisely ensures your recipes aren't too runny or thick. This is especially important for air fryer baking, where liquid ratios impact rising and browning. For example, a vegan cake requiring 460 ml of oat milk will turn out denser if you accidentally use 2 US cups instead of 1.94.</p>

<h2>Using 460 ml of Oat Milk in Air Fryer Recipes</h2>
<p>Many <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>air fryer dessert recipes</a> call for oat milk as a dairy substitute. When a recipe specifies 460 ml, using the correct cup measurement ensures the right moisture balance. For instance, a chocolate mug cake made with 460 ml of oat milk (1.94 US cups) will have a lighter crumb than one made with 2 full cups.</p>
<p>Savory dishes like creamy pasta sauces also benefit from accurate measurements. If a sauce requires 460 ml of oat milk, using 1.61 UK cups instead of 1.94 US cups could make it too thick. Always check which cup measurement your recipe uses, especially when adapting traditional oven recipes for the air fryer.</p>

<h3>Tips for Measuring 460 ml of Oat Milk Without a Scale</h3>
<p>If you don't have a measuring jug, use standard cups to portion 460 ml of oat milk. In the US, fill a cup to just under the 2-cup mark (about 1 cup + 3/4 cup + 1 tablespoon). In the UK, use 1.5 cups plus 2 tablespoons. Stir the oat milk before measuring, as some separation is natural.</p>

faqQ1: "Can I use milk instead of half and half for 535 ml in a recipe?"
faqA1: "Yes, you can substitute milk for half and half, but the result will be less creamy. Half and half contains more fat, which adds richness to dishes like sauces and desserts. If using milk, consider adding a tablespoon of butter per cup to mimic the texture."
faqQ2: "How does 535 ml of half and half compare to heavy cream?"
faqA2: "535 ml of half and half (about 2.26 cups) has less fat than heavy cream—typically 10-12% compared to 36%. Heavy cream will make dishes thicker and richer, while half and half offers a lighter consistency. Adjust cooking times slightly if substituting one for the other in air fryer recipes."
faqQ3: "Is 535 ml of half and half the same in the UK and US?"
faqA3: "Yes, 535 ml is the same volume in both the UK and US. However, cup sizes differ slightly—the UK uses 284 ml per cup, while the US uses 240 ml. For 535 ml, this translates to roughly 1.88 UK cups or 2.26 US cups."
faqQ4: "Can I freeze 535 ml of half and half if I don't use it all?"
faqA4: "Yes, you can freeze half and half, though it may separate when thawed. Stir well before using it in cooked dishes like soups or sauces. Avoid freezing if you plan to use it in coffee or drinks, as the texture may change. Always store it in an airtight container."

<p>535 ml of half and half is approximately 2.26 cups. This conversion is handy when you're following recipes, especially those designed for air fryers where precise measurements matter. Whether you're whipping up a creamy sauce or baking a delicious dessert, knowing how to convert millilitres to cups ensures your dish turns out perfectly every time.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>
<p>Air fryers rely on precise cooking times and ingredient measurements to deliver consistent results. Using the right amount of half and half can make the difference between a creamy, well-balanced dish and one that's too runny or thick. For example, if you're making a <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>creamy pasta bake</a>, 535 ml of half and half (or 2.26 cups) ensures the sauce coats the pasta perfectly without being overly heavy.</p>

<p>Many air fryer recipes, especially those for desserts like custards or puddings, call for half and half. If you're working with a recipe that lists measurements in millilitres but prefer using cups, this conversion is a lifesaver. You can also check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for other common measurements.</p>

<h3>How to Measure 535 ml of Half and Half Without a Measuring Cup</h3>
<p>If you don't have a measuring cup handy, you can still measure 535 ml of half and half accurately. A standard metric measuring jug will show millilitres, making it easy to pour the exact amount. Alternatively, you can use a kitchen scale—535 ml of half and half weighs roughly 535 grams, as its density is close to water. This method is particularly useful if you're preparing a <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert recipe</a> where precision is key.</p>

<h2>Converting 535 ml of Half and Half for Different Recipes</h2>
<p>Whether you're cooking a savoury dish or baking something sweet, 535 ml of half and half (2.26 cups) is a versatile measurement. For instance, if you're making a rich <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>creamy chicken dish</a>, this amount ensures the sauce is luxuriously smooth. On the other hand, if you're baking a cake or custard, the same measurement guarantees the right consistency for your batter or filling.</p>

<p>It's worth noting that half and half behaves similarly to milk in most recipes, so you can often substitute it directly. However, its slightly higher fat content means it adds extra richness, which is why it's a favourite for air fryer recipes.

<h3>Common Mistakes When Measuring Half and Half</h3>
<p>One of the most frequent errors when measuring 535 ml of half and half is using a liquid measuring cup incorrectly. Always pour the half and half to the marked line at eye level to avoid over- or under-measuring. Another mistake is assuming all cups are the same—US cups and UK cups differ slightly, so stick to the 2.26-cup measurement for accuracy. If you're unsure, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a> can help clarify.</p>

<h2>How to Store Leftover Half and Half</h2>
<p>If your recipe doesn't use the full 535 ml of half and half, you'll need to store the remainder properly. Transfer it to an airtight container and refrigerate it for up to five days. You can also freeze half and half, though it may separate slightly when thawed—perfect for cooking but less ideal for drinking.

<p>When you're ready to use the leftover half and half, give it a good stir or shake to recombine any separated fat. This ensures it performs just as well in your next air fryer creation, whether that's a creamy soup or a decadent dessert.</p>

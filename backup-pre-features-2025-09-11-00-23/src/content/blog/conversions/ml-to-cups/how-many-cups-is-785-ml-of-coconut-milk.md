faqQ1: "Is 785 ml of coconut milk the same as one can?"
faqA1: "No, standard coconut milk cans vary in size. While some are 400 ml, others are 785 ml or different amounts. Always check the label to confirm the exact volume before measuring for recipes."
faqQ2: "Can I use light coconut milk instead of regular for 785 ml measurements?"
faqA2: "Yes, you can substitute light coconut milk in the same 785 ml quantity, but be aware it will affect the richness and texture of your dish. Light coconut milk has more water content, so your recipe might need adjustment in cooking time or other ingredients."
faqQ3: "How do I measure 785 ml of coconut milk if I only have a 1-cup measure?"
faqA3: "For UK measurements, use your 1-cup measure (250 ml) three times (750 ml), then add about 35 ml more (just under 1/8 cup). For US cups (240 ml), measure three full cups (720 ml) plus about 65 ml (just over 1/4 cup)."
faqQ4: "Does the fat content affect how 785 ml of coconut milk converts to cups?"
faqA4: "No, the fat content doesn't change the volume conversion. Whether using full-fat or light coconut milk, 785 ml equals the same number of cups. However, higher fat content may affect how the coconut milk pours and mixes in recipes."

<h3>UK vs US Cup Measurements for Coconut Milk</h3>

<h2>How to Measure 785 ml of Coconut Milk Without a Scale</h2>
<p>If you don't have a measuring jug, you can use a standard cup to measure 785 ml of coconut milk. Fill the cup to the brim three times, then add a small amount to reach the full 785 ml. For more precise measurements, consider using a liquid measuring cup with millilitre markings.</p>

<p>Shake the coconut milk can well before measuring, as it tends to separate. Stirring ensures you get an even mix of the creamy and watery parts.

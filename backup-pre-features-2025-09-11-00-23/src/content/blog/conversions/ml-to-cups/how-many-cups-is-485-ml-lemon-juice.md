Whether you're making a tangy lemon drizzle cake or marinating chicken, knowing the exact cup equivalent ensures your dish turns out perfectly.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Cooking</h2>  
<p>Precision is key when working with ingredients like lemon juice, as too much or too little can drastically alter the taste of your dish. For air fryer recipes, where flavours are concentrated, getting the right balance is even more crucial. A slight miscalculation could make your dish overly tart or bland.</p>  
<p>If you're following a recipe from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, you'll often find measurements in millilitres or cups. Knowing how to convert between the two ensures you never go wrong. Whether you're making lemon-infused salmon or a zesty dessert, accurate conversions guarantee consistent results every time.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure 485 ml of Lemon Juice</h3>  
<p>To measure 485 ml of lemon juice, you can use a liquid measuring cup marked with millilitres or cups. If your cup measures in imperial units, remember that 1 cup equals roughly 237 ml. For 485 ml, you’d need just over 2 cups (2.05 cups to be exact). This is especially useful when scaling recipes up or down.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for 485 ml of Lemon Juice</h2>  
<p>Lemon juice is a versatile ingredient used in everything from marinades to desserts. If you're preparing a dish like lemon garlic shrimp in your air fryer, 485 ml of lemon juice would be enough for multiple servings. It’s also perfect for making lemon curd or a large batch of lemonade.</p>

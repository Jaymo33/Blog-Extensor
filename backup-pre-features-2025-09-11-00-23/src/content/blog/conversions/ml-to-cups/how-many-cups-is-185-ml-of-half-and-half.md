faqQ1: "Is 185 ml of half and half the same as 3/4 cup?"
faqA1: "No, 185 ml of half and half equals roughly 0.78 cups, which is slightly more than 3/4 cup (177 ml). For precise air fryer recipes, use a measuring jug or the tablespoon method mentioned above."
faqQ2: "Can I use milk instead of half and half in a 185 ml measurement?"
faqA2: "Yes, but the texture will be lighter. Half and half is 50% milk and 50% cream, so substituting milk may require adjusting other ingredients. For air fryer recipes, consider adding a teaspoon of butter per 185 ml to mimic richness."
faqQ3: "How do I measure 185 ml of half and half without a measuring cup?"
faqA3: "Use a tablespoon: 12 tablespoons (180 ml) plus 1 teaspoon (5 ml) equals 185 ml. Alternatively, a standard UK teacup holds about 190 ml, so fill it just below the rim."
faqQ4: "Does 185 ml of half and half weigh the same as water?"
faqA4: "No, half and half is slightly denser due to its fat content. While 185 ml of water weighs 185 grams, half and half weighs about 190 grams. For baking, stick to volume measurements unless the recipe specifies weight."

faqQ1: "Does the type of honey affect the 585 ml to cups conversion?"
faqA1: "While different types of honey (like runny or thick-set) have slight density variations, the conversion remains fairly consistent. 585 ml of honey generally equals 2.47 cups, regardless of the variety. For precise baking, warming crystallised honey before measuring ensures accuracy."
faqQ2: "Can I use the same conversion for other liquids like syrup or oil?"
faqA2: "No, honey’s density differs from other liquids, so 585 ml of syrup or oil won’t convert to the same cup measurement. Always check specific conversion charts for different ingredients, especially when adapting recipes for your air fryer."
faqQ3: "How do I measure 585 ml of honey without a measuring cup?"
faqA3: "If you don’t have a measuring cup, use a kitchen scale. Honey weighs approximately 340 grams per cup, so 585 ml would be around 840 grams. This method is just as accurate and avoids sticky messes."
faqQ4: "Why is my air fryer recipe too sweet even with the correct honey measurement?"
faqA4: "Honey’s sweetness can vary by brand and floral source. If your dish is too sweet, try reducing the honey slightly or balancing it with acidic ingredients like lemon juice. Always taste-test air fryer recipes before adjusting measurements."

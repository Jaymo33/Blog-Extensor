faqQ1: "Can I use honey instead of maple syrup in air fryer recipes?"
faqA1: "Yes, honey can substitute maple syrup in a 1:1 ratio by volume, but it’s slightly denser. For 5 tbsp (100g) of maple syrup, use about 105 grams of honey. Adjust cooking times slightly, as honey caramelises faster."
faqQ2: "How do I convert other amounts of maple syrup to grams?"
faqA2: "Use the ratio 1 tbsp = 20 grams for maple syrup. For smaller or larger quantities, multiply the tablespoons by 20. For example, 3 tbsp = 60 grams, and 10 tbsp = 200 grams."
faqQ3: "Does the type of maple syrup affect the weight?"
faqA3: "All pure maple syrups (Grade A or B) have similar densities, so the weight per tablespoon remains consistent. Flavoured or artificial syrups may vary slightly, so check the label for accuracy."
faqQ4: "Why is weighing ingredients better than measuring by volume?"
faqA4: "Weighing eliminates inconsistencies caused by air pockets or settling in dry ingredients. For liquids like maple syrup, it ensures precision, especially in baking or glazes where balance is crucial."

<p>5 tablespoons (tbsp) of maple syrup is equivalent to approximately 100 grams (g). This conversion is essential for precise measurements in air fryer recipes, ensuring your dishes turn out perfectly every time. Whether you’re glazing salmon or sweetening a dessert, knowing the exact weight helps maintain consistency. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we focus on accuracy to make your cooking experience effortless.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on precise ingredient ratios to achieve the best texture and flavour. Too much or too little maple syrup can alter the caramelisation and moisture levels in your dish. For example, a sticky glaze for chicken or a drizzle over roasted vegetables requires the right balance. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> simplifies these calculations, so you never have to second-guess.</p>  

<p>Maple syrup’s density means volume measurements like tablespoons can vary slightly in weight. That’s why weighing ingredients, especially for baking or marinades, ensures reliability. If you’re preparing a batch of cookies or a savoury glaze, 100 grams of maple syrup gives you the perfect sweetness without overpowering other flavours.</p>  

<h3>How to measure 5 tbsp of maple syrup without scales</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a kitchen scale, use a standard UK tablespoon (15ml) and fill it level for accuracy. Five tablespoons should roughly equal 100 grams, but slight variations can occur due to syrup thickness. For recipes where precision is key, like our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer dessert collection</a>, weighing is always recommended.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for 5 tbsp (100g) of maple syrup in air fryer recipes</h2>

In your air fryer, 100 grams can be used to glaze salmon fillets, sweeten roasted carrots, or add depth to a BBQ marinade.

<h3>Tips for storing and handling maple syrup</h3>  
<p>To keep maple syrup fresh, store it in a cool, dark place or refrigerate after opening. Its high sugar content prevents spoilage, but refrigeration maintains quality. If your syrup crystallises, gently warm it in a water bath before measuring.

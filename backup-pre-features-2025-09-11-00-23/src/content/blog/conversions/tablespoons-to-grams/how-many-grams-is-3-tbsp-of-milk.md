faqQ1: "Does 3 tbsp of milk weigh the same in all recipes?"
faqA1: "Yes, 3 tbsp of milk generally weighs around 45 grams regardless of the recipe. However, the type of milk (whole, skimmed, or plant-based) can slightly vary in density, though the difference is minimal for most cooking purposes."
faqQ2: "Can I use a kitchen scale instead of measuring spoons?"
faqA2: "Absolutely! A digital kitchen scale is the most accurate way to measure 3 tbsp of milk (45g). Spoons can vary slightly, especially if the milk isn’t levelled off properly. Scales eliminate guesswork for perfect results every time."
faqQ3: "How do I convert other milk measurements to grams?"
faqA3: "For larger quantities, multiply the number of tablespoons by 15 (since 1 tbsp = 15ml) and then by the milk’s density (roughly 1.03g/ml). For example, 6 tbsp would be about 90 grams. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a> simplifies this further."
faqQ4: "Why is my air fryer recipe too dry or wet with 3 tbsp of milk?"
faqA4: "If your dish turns out uneven, double-check your measurements. Too much milk can make batters runny, while too little can dry them out. Also, ensure your air fryer isn’t overcrowded, as this affects cooking consistency."

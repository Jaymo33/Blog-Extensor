faqQ1: "Can I use whipped soft cheese instead of regular for 4 tbsp to grams?"
faqA1: "Yes, but whipped soft cheese is aerated, so 4 tbsp may weigh slightly less than 60g. For accuracy, fluff it up before measuring or use a scale."
faqQ2: "Does the brand of soft cheese affect the 4 tbsp to grams conversion?"
faqA2: "Most full-fat soft cheeses weigh similarly, but always check the packaging for density. Store-brand and premium versions usually align with the 60g standard for 4 tbsp."
faqQ3: "How do I measure 4 tbsp of soft cheese if it’s very sticky?"
faqA3: "Lightly coat your spoon with oil or use a silicone spatula to scoop neatly. For ultra-sticky cheeses, weighing directly in grams avoids the hassle."
faqQ4: "Can I freeze dishes made with 4 tbsp (60g) of soft cheese after air frying?"
faqA4: "Yes, but texture may change upon thawing. Creamy dishes like dips freeze best, while baked goods with soft cheese can become grainy. Reheat in the air fryer for best results."

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on even heat distribution, so ingredient quantities must be spot-on for consistent results. Too much soft cheese can make dishes overly rich or soggy, while too little might leave them dry. Measuring 4 tbsp of soft cheese in grams ensures you get the right balance every time. If you're new to air frying, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> for inspiration.</p>  
<p>Soft cheese, like cream cheese or ricotta, is often used in air fryer recipes for dips, stuffed mushrooms, or even cheesecakes. Since air fryers cook faster than conventional ovens, precise measurements prevent overcooking. A kitchen scale is your best friend here—skip the guesswork and measure directly in grams for reliability.</p>

<h3>How to measure 4 tbsp of soft cheese without a scale</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a scale, use the spoon-and-level method for accuracy. Scoop the soft cheese into a tablespoon, then level it off with a knife. Repeat four times to get roughly 60g. For sticky cheeses, lightly grease the spoon first. Need cleaning tips for sticky messes? Try our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner guide</a>.</p>

<h2>Common uses for 4 tbsp of soft cheese in air fryer recipes</h2>  
<p>From savoury to sweet, 4 tbsp (60g) of soft cheese works wonders in the air fryer. Mix it into mashed potatoes for extra creaminess, or stuff chicken breasts for a juicy filling. For dessert lovers, swirl it into brownie batter before air frying—just 4 tbsp adds a luxurious touch.

<p>Soft cheese also shines in air-fried dips. Combine 4 tbsp with herbs and garlic for a quick party snack, or layer it in stuffed peppers. Since air fryers crisp while keeping interiors creamy, it’s the perfect tool for cheesy dishes. Remember, 60g is just the starting point—adjust to taste!</p>

<h3>Converting other soft cheese quantities to grams</h3>  
<p>Need more or less than 4 tbsp? Here’s a quick guide: 1 tbsp ≈ 15g, 2 tbsp ≈ 30g, and 8 tbsp ≈ 120g. These conversions work for most soft cheeses, including mascarpone and goat cheese. For larger batches, like our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/breakfast>breakfast recipes</a>, scale up accordingly.</p>

<h2>Tips for working with soft cheese in the air fryer</h2>  
<p>Soft cheese melts quickly, so watch cooking times closely. For stuffed dishes, seal edges tightly to prevent leaks. Preheating the air fryer ensures even cooking, especially for recipes using 4 tbsp (60g) of soft cheese. If you’re adapting a conventional recipe, reduce the temperature by 20°C and check frequently.</p>  
<p>For best results, let soft cheese come to room temperature before measuring. Cold cheese is denser, which can throw off your 4-tbsp-to-grams conversion. And if you’re experimenting, note that low-fat versions may behave differently—stick to full-fat for creamy reliability.</p>

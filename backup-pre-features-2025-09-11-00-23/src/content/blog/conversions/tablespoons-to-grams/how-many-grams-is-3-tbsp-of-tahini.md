faqQ1: "Can I use tahini in sweet air fryer recipes?"
faqA1: "Absolutely! Tahini adds a rich, nutty flavour to sweet dishes like cookies, brownies, or drizzled over fruit. Its versatility makes it great for both savoury and sweet air fryer recipes. Just remember to measure accurately—3 tbsp of tahini equals about 45 grams."
faqQ2: "Does the brand of tahini affect the weight per tablespoon?"
faqA2: "Different brands may have slight variations in density, but 3 tbsp of tahini generally weighs around 45 grams. For precise recipes, especially baking, it’s best to weigh it. Check the label if you’re unsure, as some brands may list nutritional info by weight."
faqQ3: "How do I measure tahini without making a mess?"
faqA3: "Use a silicone spatula to scoop tahini neatly from the jar. For sticky tahini, lightly oil the spoon first to help it slide off easily. A kitchen scale is the cleanest option—just zero it with your container and spoon in tahini until you hit 45 grams for 3 tbsp."
faqQ4: "Can I substitute other nut butters for tahini in air fryer recipes?"
faqA4: "Yes, but adjust quantities as needed. Almond or peanut butter can work, but they have different flavours and textures. For 3 tbsp of tahini (45g), start with the same weight of substitute and tweak to taste. Keep in mind tahini’s unique flavour profile for authentic results."

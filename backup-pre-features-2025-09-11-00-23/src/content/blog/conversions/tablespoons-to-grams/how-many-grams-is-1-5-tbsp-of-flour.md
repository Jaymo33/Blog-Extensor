faqQ1: "Can I use a regular spoon to measure 1.5 tbsp of flour?"
faqA1: "While you can use a regular spoon, it’s less precise. For accuracy, use a proper measuring tablespoon and level it off. For baking in an air fryer, even small discrepancies can affect texture, so a scale is best."
faqQ2: "Why does 1.5 tbsp of flour weigh 12 grams in some recipes but 15 grams in others?"
faqA2: "The weight varies based on flour type (e.g., plain vs. self-raising) and how it’s packed. Spooned flour weighs less than scooped. Always check if the recipe specifies a method or use a scale for consistency."
faqQ3: "How do I convert 1.5 tbsp of flour to grams for gluten-free flour?"
faqA3: "Gluten-free flours like almond or coconut are denser. For these, 1.5 tbsp may weigh closer to 15 grams. Check packaging for exact weights or weigh directly to avoid air fryer mishaps."
faqQ4: "Is 1.5 tbsp of flour enough to coat chicken in the air fryer?"
faqA4: "Yes, 1.5 tbsp (12g) is sufficient for a light coating. For crispier results, pair it with breadcrumbs or spices. Over-coating can block airflow in the fryer, leading to uneven cooking."

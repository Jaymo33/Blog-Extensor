faqQ1: "Does the type of onion affect the weight per tablespoon?"
faqA1: "Yes, different onions vary slightly in density. Spring onions and shallots may weigh less than standard yellow or red onions. For precise measurements, use a kitchen scale to confirm the grams in 5 tablespoons of onion."
faqQ2: "Can I use frozen onions instead of fresh for this conversion?"
faqA2: "Frozen onions often have a higher water content, so 5 tbsp may weigh slightly more than fresh. If substituting, thaw and drain excess moisture before measuring for accurate results in air fryer recipes."
faqQ3: "How do I convert grams back to tablespoons if needed?"
faqA3: "Since 5 tbsp of onion equals about 50 grams, you can reverse the calculation. Divide the grams by 10 to get the approximate tablespoons. For example, 30 grams would be roughly 3 tbsp."
faqQ4: "Why is weighing onions better than using tablespoons in air fryer cooking?"
faqA4: "Grams provide exact measurements, ensuring consistent flavour and texture. Air fryers cook quickly, so precise quantities prevent over or under-seasoning. For best results, use a scale when preparing recipes from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>."

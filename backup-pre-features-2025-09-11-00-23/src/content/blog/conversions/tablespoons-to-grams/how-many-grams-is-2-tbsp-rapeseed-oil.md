faqQ1: "Can I use olive oil instead of rapeseed oil in my air fryer?"
faqA1: "Yes, you can substitute olive oil, but be aware that it has a lower smoke point than rapeseed oil. For high-heat cooking, rapeseed oil is generally better. If using olive oil, stick to light or refined versions for air frying."
faqQ2: "How do I measure 2 tbsp of rapeseed oil without a scale?"
faqA2: "Use a standard UK tablespoon and fill it level to the brim for an accurate 14-gram measure. Two level tablespoons will give you approximately 28 grams of rapeseed oil. Avoid heaping or under-filling for best results."
faqQ3: "Does the type of rapeseed oil affect the weight?"
faqA3: "Most standard rapeseed oils have a similar density, so the weight per tablespoon remains consistent. Cold-pressed or flavoured varieties may vary slightly, but the difference is minimal for cooking purposes."
faqQ4: "Why is rapeseed oil recommended for air fryers?"
faqA4: "Rapeseed oil has a high smoke point (around 230°C), making it ideal for air frying at high temperatures. Its neutral flavour also won’t overpower your dishes, unlike stronger oils like coconut or sesame."

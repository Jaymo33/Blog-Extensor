faqQ1: "Does the type of BBQ sauce affect the weight of 2 tbsp?"
faqA1: "Yes, thicker, sugar-heavy sauces like Kansas City style may weigh slightly more (up to 32g per 2 tbsp), while vinegar-based sauces are lighter (around 28g). Always check the brand’s nutrition label for precise density."
faqQ2: "Can I use grams instead of tablespoons in air fryer recipes?"
faqA2: "Absolutely! Grams provide more accuracy, especially for sticky ingredients like BBQ sauce. Most modern air fryer recipes include both measurements. If yours doesn’t, assume 1 tbsp ≈ 15g for liquids and sauces."
faqQ3: "How do I convert grams back to tablespoons if my recipe uses weight?"
faqA3: "Divide the gram amount by 15 to get tablespoons. For example, 45g of BBQ sauce ÷ 15 = 3 tbsp. For small amounts, use teaspoons (5g per tsp) or adjust to taste."
faqQ4: "Why does my air fryer food get soggy with BBQ sauce?"
faqA4: "Over-saucing is the usual culprit. Stick to 2 tbsp (30g) per serving, and apply sauce in the last 2-3 minutes of cooking. Preheating the air fryer also helps crisp the exterior."

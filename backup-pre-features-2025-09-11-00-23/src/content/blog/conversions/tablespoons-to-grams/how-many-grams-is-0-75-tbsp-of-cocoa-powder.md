faqQ1: "Can I use heaped tablespoons for cocoa powder measurements?"
faqA1: "No, heaped tablespoons can add up to 50% more cocoa powder than leveled measurements. For accuracy in air fryer recipes, always level off your 0.75 tbsp with a knife. Excess cocoa can alter texture and taste."
faqQ2: "Does cocoa powder type affect the 0.75 tbsp to grams conversion?"
faqA2: "Slightly. Dutch-processed cocoa is denser than natural cocoa, but the difference is minimal for small amounts like 0.75 tbsp. Both types will weigh close to 4.5 grams per 0.75 tablespoon in UK measurements."
faqQ3: "Why do UK air fryer recipes use grams instead of tablespoons?"
faqA3: "Grams provide precision, especially for baking where ratios matter. Air fryers cook faster than ovens, so exact measurements prevent over-drying or undercooking. Scales also eliminate packing inconsistencies with spoon measurements."
faqQ4: "How do I adjust 0.75 tbsp cocoa powder for a larger air fryer batch?"
faqA4: "Multiply the 4.5g weight by your batch size. For example, doubling the recipe would require 9g (or 1.5 tbsp) of cocoa powder. Always mix dry ingredients thoroughly for even distribution in air fryer cooking."

faqQ1: "Can I use 1.5 tbsp of baking powder in all air fryer recipes?"
faqA1: "Not all recipes require 1.5 tbsp of baking powder—it depends on the quantity of other ingredients. For most small-batch air fryer cakes or batters, this amount works well. Always follow the recipe’s specific measurements to avoid over- or under-leavening."
faqQ2: "Why does my air fryer recipe taste bitter with 1.5 tbsp baking powder?"
faqA2: "Bitterness usually means too much baking powder was used. Even 1.5 tbsp can be excessive if the recipe isn’t balanced. Double-check your measurements and consider reducing slightly if the taste is off. Fresh baking powder also prevents metallic flavours."
faqQ3: "How do I store baking powder to keep it accurate for measuring?"
faqA3: "Keep baking powder in an airtight container in a cool, dry place. Humidity can clump it, leading to inaccurate measurements. Test its freshness by mixing 1 tsp with hot water—if it bubbles vigorously, it’s still active."
faqQ4: "Can I substitute bicarbonate of soda for 1.5 tbsp baking powder?"
faqA4: "No—bicarbonate of soda is 3–4 times stronger. Replace 1.5 tbsp baking powder with ½ tsp bicarbonate of soda plus an acid (like lemon juice). For air fryer recipes, stick to baking powder unless the recipe specifies otherwise."

<p>1.5 tablespoons (tbsp) of baking powder equals approximately 21 grams in UK measurements. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements can make or break your dish. Whether you’re whipping up fluffy cakes or crispy batters, knowing the exact weight ensures consistent results every time.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate baking powder measurements matter</h2>  
<p>Baking powder is a leavening agent that helps baked goods rise. Too little, and your air fryer cakes or muffins will be dense. Too much, and they might collapse or taste bitter. For air fryer recipes, where heat distribution is rapid, precision is key. A digital scale is your best friend here, as volume measurements (like tablespoons) can vary based on how you scoop.</p>  

<p>At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we recommend weighing ingredients for reliability. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> includes common baking powder conversions, so you’ll never second-guess measurements again. This is especially handy for recipes like air fryer doughnuts or savoury batters.</p>  

<h3>How to measure 1.5 tbsp baking powder correctly</h3>  
<p>To measure 1.5 tbsp of baking powder accurately, use a flat-edged utensil to level off the powder. Avoid packing it down, as this can lead to over-measuring.

It’s also ideal for homemade air fryer onion rings or fritters.</p>

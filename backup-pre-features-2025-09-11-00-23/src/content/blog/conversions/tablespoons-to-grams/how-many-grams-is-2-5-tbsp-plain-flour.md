faqQ1: "Why does 2.5 tbsp of plain flour weigh 20 grams in the UK?"
faqA1: "UK tablespoons hold slightly more volume than US tablespoons, which affects weight. A UK tablespoon of plain flour is about 8 grams, making 2.5 tbsp equal to 20 grams. Always check if your recipe uses UK or US measurements."
faqQ2: "Can I use 2.5 tbsp plain flour instead of 20 grams in air fryer recipes?"
faqA2: "Yes, but for best results, weigh the flour. Spooned and levelled, 2.5 tbsp should give you 20 grams, but scooping can add extra flour. Digital scales ensure accuracy, especially in baking."
faqQ3: "How does plain flour affect air fryer cooking compared to other types?"
faqA3: "Plain flour works well for coatings and light batters in air fryers. It crisps evenly without becoming too dense. Self-raising flour, however, may puff up more due to added leavening agents."
faqQ4: "What’s the best way to store plain flour for air fryer recipes?"
faqA4: "Keep plain flour in an airtight container in a cool, dry place. This prevents moisture absorption, which can throw off measurements like 2.5 tbsp to grams. For long-term storage, freeze it."

faqQ1: "Can I use honey instead of agave syrup in air fryer recipes?"
faqA1: "Yes, you can substitute honey for agave syrup, but adjust the quantity. Honey is slightly thicker, so use about 2.5 tbsp (63g) instead of 3 tbsp agave syrup. Reduce cooking time slightly, as honey caramelises faster."
faqQ2: "Why does my agave syrup glaze burn in the air fryer?"
faqA2: "Agave syrup has a high sugar content, which burns at lower temperatures. Try reducing the cooking time or temperature by 10°C. Alternatively, brush the glaze on during the last few minutes of cooking."
faqQ3: "How do I convert grams to tablespoons for agave syrup?"
faqA3: "Since 1 tbsp of agave syrup weighs about 21g, divide the gram amount by 21 to get tablespoons. For example, 63g ÷ 21 = 3 tbsp. Use a digital scale for the most accurate results."
faqQ4: "Is agave syrup healthier than sugar for air fryer recipes?"
faqA4: "Agave syrup has a lower glycemic index than sugar but is higher in fructose. While it’s sweeter (so you use less), moderation is key. For healthier options, try fruit-based sweeteners in our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert recipes</a>."

<p>3 tablespoons (tbsp) of agave syrup weigh approximately 63 grams. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements can make or break your dish.

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on even heat distribution, and incorrect ingredient quantities can lead to uneven cooking. Agave syrup, for example, caramelises quickly, so too much can cause burning. By converting 3 tbsp of agave syrup to grams (63g), you’ll avoid sticky situations. Many of our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> use agave syrup for its mild sweetness, so precision is key.</p>  

<p>Using a digital scale for measurements like 3 tbsp agave syrup to grams ensures consistency. Unlike volume measurements, weight isn’t affected by how tightly packed the ingredient is. This is especially useful for sticky substances like agave syrup, which can be tricky to measure by volume alone.

<h3>How to measure agave syrup without a scale</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a scale, use the spoon-and-level method for 3 tbsp of agave syrup in grams. Fill your tablespoon evenly, then scrape off the excess with a straight edge. Remember, 1 tbsp of agave syrup weighs about 21 grams, so 3 tbsp equals roughly 63 grams. This method works well for most <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/breakfast>breakfast recipes</a> featuring agave syrup.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for agave syrup in air fryer recipes</h2>  
<p>Agave syrup’s neutral flavour makes it ideal for glazes, marinades, and baked goods. For instance, 3 tbsp agave syrup (63g) can sweeten a batch of air-fried cookies or a glaze for chicken wings. Its high fructose content means it browns faster than sugar, so adjust cooking times accordingly.

<p>In savoury dishes, agave syrup balances spicy or tangy flavours. A mix of 3 tbsp agave syrup (63g), soy sauce, and garlic makes a killer glaze for salmon or tofu. Since air fryers circulate heat efficiently, these glazes caramelise beautifully without burning.

<h3>Agave syrup vs. other sweeteners</h3>  
<p>Agave syrup is about 1.5 times sweeter than sugar, so 3 tbsp (63g) replaces roughly 4.5 tbsp of granulated sugar. Unlike honey, it dissolves easily in cold liquids, making it great for dressings. However, it’s higher in fructose, so use it sparingly. For sugar-free alternatives, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert section</a>.</p>

faqQ1: "Can I use 5 tbsp of baking powder instead of 70 grams?"
faqA1: "Yes, 5 tablespoons of baking powder is roughly equivalent to 70 grams in the UK. However, for precision in air fryer baking, weighing ingredients is recommended. Volume measurements can vary due to settling or packing, while grams provide consistency."
faqQ2: "Does the brand of baking powder affect the conversion?"
faqA2: "Most UK baking powders have a similar density, so 1 tbsp ≈ 14 grams is standard. However, some specialty brands may differ slightly. Always check the packaging for weight guidelines if precision is critical, especially for air fryer recipes."
faqQ3: "How do I measure 5 tbsp of baking powder without scales?"
faqA3: "Use a tablespoon measure and level each scoop with a knife for accuracy. Avoid packing or tapping the spoon, as this compacts the powder. For air fryer baking, investing in a cheap digital scale ensures better results than volume measurements."
faqQ4: "Why does my air fryer cake taste bitter with 5 tbsp baking powder?"
faqA4: "Bitterness usually means too much baking powder was used. Even if you measured 5 tbsp correctly, expired baking powder can concentrate bitter compounds. Test its freshness and consider reducing to 60 grams (about 4.25 tbsp) for a milder taste."

<p>5 tablespoons (tbsp) of baking powder equals approximately 70 grams (g). This conversion is essential for precise baking, especially when using an air fryer where measurements can make or break a recipe. Whether you're making fluffy cakes or crispy batters, knowing the exact weight ensures consistency.

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer baking</h2>  
<p>Baking powder is a leavening agent, and even small discrepancies can affect how your air fryer recipes turn out. Too much can make cakes bitter or cause them to collapse, while too little may leave them dense. Using grams instead of tablespoons removes guesswork, ensuring your <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> are perfect every time. Digital scales are far more reliable than volume measurements, especially for ingredients like baking powder that can settle or clump.</p>  

<p>If you're adapting a traditional oven recipe for the air fryer, precise conversions are even more critical. Air fryers cook faster and hotter, so balanced ingredients are key. For example, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>air fryer cake recipes</a> rely on exact measurements to achieve the right rise and texture. Always level off tablespoons when measuring baking powder to avoid over-packing.</p>  

<h3>How to convert 5 tbsp baking powder to grams</h3>  
<p>The standard UK conversion for baking powder is 1 tablespoon = 14 grams. Therefore, 5 tablespoons of baking powder equal 70 grams. This applies to most commercial baking powders, but always check the packaging for specific density notes. If your recipe calls for 5 tbsp of baking powder and you're using a scale, simply weigh out 70 grams for accuracy.</p>  

<h2>Common baking powder measurement mistakes</h2>  
<p>One frequent error is scooping baking powder directly from the bag with a tablespoon, which can lead to uneven packing and excess. Instead, spoon the powder into the measuring spoon and level it off with a knife. Another mistake is using outdated baking powder, which loses potency over time. Test it by mixing a teaspoon with hot water—if it doesn’t bubble vigorously, replace it.</p>  

<p>For those who love baking in their air fryer, keeping ingredients fresh and correctly measured is crucial. Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>air fryer dessert collection</a> for recipes that rely on precise baking powder measurements. And don’t forget to clean your air fryer regularly—here’s a guide to the best <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaning methods</a>.</p>  

<h3>Adjusting recipes for altitude or humidity</h3>  
<p>If you live in a humid climate or at high altitude, you may need to tweak baking powder amounts. Humidity can cause baking powder to clump, affecting its volume-to-weight ratio. In high-altitude baking, reducing baking powder slightly (by about 1/8 tsp per teaspoon) can prevent over-rising. Always measure by weight for the most reliable results.</p>

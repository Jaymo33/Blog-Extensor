faqQ1: "Can I use other oils instead of sunflower oil in my air fryer?"
faqA1: "Yes, you can substitute sunflower oil with olive, rapeseed, or avocado oil in your air fryer. Just note that each oil has a slightly different weight per tablespoon, so adjust measurements accordingly. For example, 1.5 tbsp of olive oil is about 21g, compared to sunflower oil’s 20g."
faqQ2: "How do I measure 1.5 tbsp of sunflower oil without a tablespoon?"
faqA2: "If you don’t have a tablespoon, use a standard teaspoon—3 teaspoons equal 1 tablespoon, so 1.5 tbsp would be 4.5 teaspoons. Alternatively, a UK-standard 15ml medicine cup can help, as 1.5 tbsp equals 22.5ml."
faqQ3: "Why is my air fryer food greasy even with 1.5 tbsp of oil?"
faqA3: "Greasy results may stem from overcrowding the basket or uneven oil distribution. Ensure you’re spreading food in a single layer and tossing it halfway through cooking. Also, verify your tablespoon measurement—some spoons vary slightly in size."
faqQ4: "Is sunflower oil the best choice for air frying?"
faqA4: "Sunflower oil is excellent for air frying due to its high smoke point and neutral flavour. However, oils like avocado or peanut oil also work well. Choose based on your recipe’s requirements and personal taste preferences."

<p>1.5 tablespoons (tbsp) of sunflower oil equals approximately 20 grams (g). This conversion is essential for precise air fryer cooking, ensuring your recipes turn out perfectly every time. Whether you’re frying, roasting, or baking, knowing the exact weight of sunflower oil helps maintain consistency. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we focus on making measurements simple for hassle-free cooking.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate oil measurements matter in air frying</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of oil in your air fryer ensures even cooking and prevents overly greasy or dry results. Sunflower oil, a popular choice for its high smoke point, works well in air fryers but must be measured correctly. Too much oil can lead to splattering, while too little may leave food undercooked. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> simplifies these calculations for all your cooking needs.</p>  

<p>For example, if a recipe calls for 1.5 tbsp of sunflower oil, converting it to grams (20g) ensures precision. This is especially useful when scaling recipes up or down. Many air fryer dishes, like crispy vegetables or chicken wings, rely on the perfect oil balance for texture and flavour. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipes section</a> for more inspiration on oil measurements.</p>  

<h3>How to measure 1.5 tbsp of sunflower oil without scales</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a kitchen scale, you can still measure 1.5 tbsp of sunflower oil accurately. Use a standard tablespoon and fill it level to the brim, then add half another tablespoon. Alternatively, a standard UK tablespoon holds 15ml, so 1.5 tbsp equals 22.5ml. Since sunflower oil weighs roughly 0.9g per ml, this method confirms the 20g estimate.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for 1.5 tbsp of sunflower oil in air fryers</h2>  
<p>Sunflower oil is versatile in air fryers, perfect for roasting potatoes, crisping tofu, or preparing frozen foods. A measured 1.5 tbsp (20g) is often ideal for coating ingredients evenly without excess oil. For example, tossing sweet potato fries in this amount ensures a golden, crispy finish. Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/potatoes>potato recipes</a> for delicious ways to use this measurement.</p>  

<p>Another great use is marinating proteins like chicken or salmon. A light coating of 1.5 tbsp sunflower oil helps spices adhere and promotes even browning.

<h3>Comparing sunflower oil to other cooking oils</h3>  
<p>Sunflower oil isn’t the only option for air frying—olive, coconut, and rapeseed oil are alternatives. However, their weights per tablespoon vary slightly. For instance, 1.5 tbsp of olive oil weighs around 21g, while coconut oil is closer to 19g. Always adjust measurements based on the oil type to maintain recipe accuracy.</p>

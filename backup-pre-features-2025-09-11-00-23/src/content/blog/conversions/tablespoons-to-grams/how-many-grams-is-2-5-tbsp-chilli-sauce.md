<p>2.5 tablespoons (tbsp) of chilli sauce equals approximately 37.5 grams (g). This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precision matters, ensuring your dishes turn out perfectly every time.

At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we focus on making cooking easier with accurate measurements and delicious results.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of chilli sauce can make or break your dish. Too little, and your meal might lack flavour; too much, and it could become overpowering. The air fryer’s intense heat means sauces reduce quickly, so precise measurements prevent mishaps. For example, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>spicy air fryer chicken wings</a> rely on balanced seasoning for that perfect crispiness. Converting 2.5 tbsp of chilli sauce to grams ensures you nail the recipe every time.</p>  

<p>Many home cooks struggle with volume-to-weight conversions, especially with thick sauces like chilli. A standard UK tablespoon holds 15ml, but density varies. Chilli sauce typically weighs around 15g per tbsp, but checking your brand’s label guarantees accuracy.

faqQ1: "Can I use baking powder instead of baking soda in air fryer recipes?"
faqA1: "Baking powder isn’t a direct substitute for baking soda as it contains additional ingredients. For every 0.75 tbsp baking soda (11.25g), you’d need about 2-3 times more baking powder. However, this may alter texture and taste in air fryer recipes."
faqQ2: "Why does my air fryer recipe taste bitter with baking soda?"
faqA2: "Bitterness usually means you’ve used too much baking soda. Ensure your 0.75 tbsp measurement equals 11.25g precisely. Also check your baking soda isn’t expired – old product can develop a harsh taste that ruins air fryer dishes."
faqQ3: "How do I convert other baking soda amounts to grams?"
faqA3: "The standard ratio is 1 tbsp baking soda = 15g. For smaller amounts like 0.75 tbsp (11.25g), multiply the tablespoon quantity by 15. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a> covers all common measurements."
faqQ4: "Does baking soda affect cooking times in air fryers?"
faqA4: "Yes – baking soda promotes browning, which may slightly reduce cooking times. When using 0.75 tbsp (11.25g), check dishes 1-2 minutes earlier than recipe suggests. This prevents over-browning in your air fryer."

<p>0.75 tbsp of baking soda equals approximately 11.25 grams. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements can make or break your dish. Whether you’re whipping up fluffy cakes or crispy snacks, knowing the exact weight ensures consistent results every time.</p>

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on even heat distribution, and incorrect ingredient quantities can lead to uneven cooking or texture issues. Baking soda, in particular, affects browning and rise, so getting the grams right is crucial.

<p>Using a digital scale for dry ingredients like baking soda eliminates guesswork. Unlike volume measurements (tbsp), weight (grams) accounts for density variations. This is especially handy for UK bakers, where metric measurements are standard.</p>

<h3>How to measure 0.75 tbsp baking soda without scales</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have scales, fill a tablespoon measure three-quarters full for 0.75 tbsp. However, for air fryer recipes requiring precision, we recommend investing in a kitchen scale. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a> simplifies other common ingredient swaps too.</p>

<h2>Common uses for baking soda in air fryer recipes</h2>  
<p>Baking soda isn’t just for cakes – it’s a versatile air fryer staple. It helps crisp coatings on chicken wings, lightens batter for tempura, and even neutralises odours between cooks.

<p>When converting 0.75 tbsp baking soda to grams, remember it’s about 15 grams per full tablespoon. This ratio works for most UK-brand baking sodas, but check your packaging for density variations. Always level off your spoon for accuracy.</p>

<h3>Storing baking soda for optimal air fryer results</h3>  
<p>Keep baking soda in an airtight container to maintain potency. Humidity can cause clumping, affecting your 0.75 tbsp measurements. For deep-cleaning your appliance afterwards, try our recommended <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner</a> solutions.</p>

<h2>Troubleshooting baking soda measurements</h2>  
<p>If your air fryer dishes turn out dense or bitter, you might have mis-measured your 0.75 tbsp baking soda. Always use fresh product – old baking soda loses potency.

<p>Remember that 0.75 tbsp baking soda to grams conversions may vary slightly by brand. When scaling recipes up or down, always recalculate rather than eyeballing proportions. This ensures your air fryer creations turn out perfectly every time.</p>

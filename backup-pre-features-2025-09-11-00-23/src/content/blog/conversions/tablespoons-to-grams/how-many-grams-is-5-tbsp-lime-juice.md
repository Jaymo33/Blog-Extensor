faqQ1: "Can I use bottled lime juice instead of fresh for this conversion?"
faqA1: "Yes, bottled lime juice works for this conversion, but it may taste slightly different. Fresh lime juice often has a brighter flavour, while bottled versions can be more concentrated. Either way, 5 tbsp equals roughly 75 grams."
faqQ2: "Why does lime juice weight vary slightly in recipes?"
faqA2: "Lime juice density can change based on factors like temperature, pulp content, and whether it’s fresh or bottled. For air fryer recipes, sticking to 75 grams for 5 tbsp ensures consistency, but small variations won’t ruin your dish."
faqQ3: "How do I adjust this conversion for larger batches?"
faqA3: "Simply multiply the measurement proportionally. For example, 10 tbsp of lime juice would be about 150 grams. Always use a scale for larger quantities to maintain accuracy in your air fryer recipes."
faqQ4: "Does lime juice measurement affect air fryer cooking times?"
faqA4: "Indirectly, yes. Lime juice in marinades can tenderise proteins faster, potentially reducing cooking time. For dressings or glazes, the amount impacts flavour balance but not cooking duration. Always follow recipe guidelines for best results."

<p>5 tablespoons of lime juice equals approximately 75 grams. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precision matters, whether you're marinating chicken, dressing a salad, or whipping up a zesty sauce. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we know that accurate measurements can make or break a dish, so let’s dive into the details.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate lime juice measurements matter</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of lime juice ensures balanced flavours in your air fryer dishes. Too little, and your marinade might lack tang; too much, and it could overpower other ingredients. Whether you're preparing <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>air fryer chicken</a> or a citrusy dessert, 5 tbsp of lime juice (75g) is a common measurement in many recipes.

<p>Lime juice’s acidity can also affect cooking times and textures, especially in air fryer recipes. For example, marinating shrimp or tofu in lime juice requires precise amounts to avoid over-tenderising. If you’re unsure, always measure by weight for consistency.</p>  

<h2>How to measure lime juice correctly</h2>  
<p>For the most accurate results, use a digital kitchen scale to weigh your lime juice. If you don’t have one, a standard UK tablespoon holds about 15ml, which translates to roughly 15 grams for lime juice. This means 5 tbsp of lime juice will be close to 75 grams. Remember, freshly squeezed lime juice may vary slightly in density compared to bottled varieties.</p>  

<h3>Tips for consistent measurements</h3>  
<p>Strain your lime juice to remove pulp before measuring, as chunks can throw off the weight. Also, ensure your tablespoons are level—not heaped—for precision. If you’re scaling up a recipe, like our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer lime-infused dishes</a>, these small details matter.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for 5 tbsp of lime juice</h2>  
<p>This quantity is perfect for marinades, dressings, or even baking. Try it in air fryer fish tacos, citrus-glazed vegetables, or a tangy drizzle for desserts. Lime juice also works wonders in <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>air fryer desserts</a>, adding brightness to cakes and cookies.</p>  

<p>For cleaning your air fryer, a mix of lime juice and baking soda can help remove stubborn grease.

faqQ1: "Can I use fresh ginger instead of 0.25 tbsp ginger paste?"
faqA1: "Yes, you can substitute fresh ginger for ginger paste. About 1 teaspoon of freshly grated ginger equals 0.25 tbsp of ginger paste. However, fresh ginger may have a slightly stronger flavour, so adjust to taste."
faqQ2: "How long does ginger paste last in the fridge?"
faqA2: "Store-bought ginger paste typically lasts 2-3 weeks in the fridge once opened. Homemade ginger paste may last up to a month if stored in an airtight container. Always check for signs of spoilage before use."
faqQ3: "Is 0.25 tbsp of ginger paste the same as ground ginger?"
faqA3: "No, ginger paste and ground ginger have different intensities. Use about 1/4 teaspoon of ground ginger to replace 0.25 tbsp of ginger paste. The flavour profile will be slightly different, so adjust accordingly."
faqQ4: "Can I freeze ginger paste for later use?"
faqA4: "Absolutely! Freeze ginger paste in ice cube trays for easy portioning. Each cube (about 1 tbsp) can be thawed as needed. This method works perfectly for air fryer recipes where small amounts like 0.25 tbsp are often required."

faqQ1: "Can I use margarine instead of butter for 2.5 tbsp in air fryer recipes?"
faqA1: "Yes, you can substitute margarine for butter in a 1:1 ratio. However, margarine may have a higher water content, which can affect crispiness. Adjust cooking times slightly if needed."
faqQ2: "Why does 2.5 tbsp of butter sometimes weigh more or less than 35g?"
faqA2: "Butter density varies with temperature. Softened butter may weigh slightly less per tablespoon, while cold butter can be denser. For accuracy, use a kitchen scale or the wrapper markings."
faqQ3: "How do I measure 2.5 tbsp of butter if I don’t have tablespoon markings?"
faqA3: "A standard UK tablespoon holds about 14g of butter, so 2.5 tbsp is roughly 35g. Cut a 35g slice from a butter block using a ruler or estimate based on the pack’s weight."
faqQ4: "Can I use oil instead of 2.5 tbsp of butter in air fryer recipes?"
faqA4: "Yes, but oils have different smoke points and flavors. Use about 28ml (2.5 tbsp) of oil, but expect slight texture differences. Olive oil works well for savory dishes, while coconut oil suits baking."

<h2>Why Accurate Butter Measurements Matter in Air Fryers</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on precise ingredient ratios to achieve crispy, evenly cooked dishes. Too much butter can lead to soggy results, while too little might dry out your food.

<p>Butter measurements can vary slightly depending on its temperature and density.

If you're preparing a dish like garlic butter shrimp or buttery roasted potatoes, this conversion is a game-changer.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure 2.5 Tbsp of Butter Without Scales</h3>

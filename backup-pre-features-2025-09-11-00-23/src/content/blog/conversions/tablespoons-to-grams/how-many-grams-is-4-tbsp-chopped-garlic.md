faqQ1: "Can I use minced garlic instead of chopped for the 4 tbsp to grams conversion?"
faqA1: "Yes, but minced garlic is slightly denser, so 4 tbsp may weigh closer to 40g. For accuracy, weigh it directly or lightly spoon it into the measuring tablespoon without packing."
faqQ2: "How many garlic cloves equal 4 tbsp (36g) chopped?"
faqA2: "Approximately 6 medium cloves yield 4 tbsp when chopped. Clove sizes vary, so weighing ensures consistency, especially for air fryer recipes where precision matters."
faqQ3: "Does jarred chopped garlic weigh the same as fresh?"
faqA3: "Jarred garlic often weighs more due to added liquid. Drain it well before measuring, or use 3 tbsp plus 1 tsp (about 36g) to match fresh chopped garlic’s intensity."
faqQ4: "Why does my air fryer garlic taste bitter sometimes?"
faqA4: "Overcooking garlic in the air fryer can cause bitterness. Add it midway through cooking or mix with oil to prevent burning. Proper measurement (4 tbsp = 36g) also avoids overpowering flavours."

<p>4 tablespoons (tbsp) of chopped garlic equals approximately 36 grams (g). This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precision ensures even cooking and perfect flavour. Whether you’re making garlic butter shrimp or roasted vegetables, knowing the exact weight helps avoid over-seasoning or underwhelming results.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate garlic measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Garlic is a powerhouse ingredient that can transform any dish, but too much or too little can throw off your recipe. In an air fryer, where heat circulates rapidly, unevenly distributed garlic can burn or leave raw patches. By converting 4 tbsp of chopped garlic to grams, you ensure consistent flavour distribution.

<p>Many air fryer recipes, like garlic mushrooms or crispy tofu, rely on precise garlic quantities. A slight miscalculation could make your dish overly pungent or bland. Measuring in grams eliminates guesswork, especially when scaling recipes up or down. If you’re prepping meals in advance, accurate measurements save time and reduce waste.</p>  

<h3>How to measure chopped garlic correctly</h3>  
<p>Chopped garlic can vary in density depending on how finely it’s minced. For the most accurate conversion of 4 tbsp to grams, lightly pack the garlic into the spoon without compressing it. If you’re using pre-chopped garlic from a jar, drain excess liquid first. Freshly chopped garlic tends to be lighter, so adjust accordingly.</p>  

<h2>Common recipes using 4 tbsp of chopped garlic</h2>  
<p>Many air fryer dishes call for roughly 4 tbsp of chopped garlic, equating to 36g. Garlic butter salmon, for instance, benefits from this quantity for a robust flavour. Similarly, air-fried garlic bread or roasted potatoes need this measurement for balanced seasoning.

<p>If you’re cooking for a crowd, doubling or tripling the recipe requires precise conversions. Knowing that 4 tbsp equals 36g makes scaling effortless. For meal prep enthusiasts, this accuracy ensures every portion tastes identical.

<h3>Converting other garlic measurements to grams</h3>  
<p>If your recipe calls for cloves instead of tablespoons, note that one medium clove yields about 1 tsp (5g) when chopped. Six cloves roughly equal 4 tbsp (36g). For minced garlic, the weight may differ slightly due to finer texture. Always refer to a reliable conversion tool or chart for consistency.</p>  

<h2>Tips for storing chopped garlic</h2>  
<p>Freshly chopped garlic loses potency over time, so proper storage is key. Transfer unused portions to an airtight container and refrigerate for up to a week. For longer storage, freeze pre-measured 4 tbsp (36g) portions in ice cube trays. Thaw as needed for quick air fryer meals.</p>  

<p>Pre-chopped jarred garlic is convenient but often contains preservatives. If using it, adjust seasoning since it’s typically less pungent than fresh. After handling garlic, clean your air fryer basket thoroughly to prevent lingering odours.

<h3>Adjusting garlic quantities for personal taste</h3>  
<p>While 4 tbsp (36g) works for most recipes, garlic lovers may prefer extra. Start with the recommended amount, then adjust in future batches. For milder dishes, reduce by half and supplement with herbs. Remember, air frying intensifies flavours, so subtle adjustments go a long way.</p>

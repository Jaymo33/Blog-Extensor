<h2>Why Convert 3 tbsp of Marmalade to Grams?</h2>  
<p>Converting 3 tbsp of marmalade to grams is crucial for accuracy in recipes. Tablespoons can vary slightly in volume, but grams provide a consistent measurement. This is particularly important for air fryer recipes, where precise ingredients affect cooking times and textures. For example, a sticky glaze or marinade requires the right balance of sweetness and thickness. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> simplifies these calculations for you.</p>  

<p>Using grams also helps when scaling recipes up or down. If you're doubling a cake recipe or halving a sauce, weight measurements eliminate guesswork. Marmalade’s sticky consistency means volume measurements can be tricky, but grams offer reliability. Whether you're following a British recipe or experimenting with your air fryer, this conversion ensures success.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure 3 tbsp of Marmalade in Grams</h3>  
<p>To measure 3 tbsp of marmalade in grams, use a kitchen scale for accuracy. Scoop the marmalade into a tablespoon, levelling it off for consistency. Then, transfer it to the scale and note the weight. For 3 tablespoons, you’ll typically get around 60 grams, but slight variations can occur based on brand or thickness. If you’re preparing an air fryer dish like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>glazed chicken</a>, this precision ensures even cooking and flavour distribution.</p>

<h3>Tips for Storing and Using Marmalade</h3>

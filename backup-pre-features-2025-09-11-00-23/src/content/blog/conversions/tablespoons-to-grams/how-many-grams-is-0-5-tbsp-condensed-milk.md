faqQ1: "Can I use evaporated milk instead of condensed milk for 0.5 tbsp measurements?"
faqA1: "No, evaporated milk isn’t a direct substitute. While both are concentrated, condensed milk contains added sugar, making it thicker and sweeter. For 0.5 tbsp (9 grams) of condensed milk, you’d need to adjust recipes significantly if using evaporated milk, possibly adding sugar and reducing other liquids."
faqQ2: "Why does my air fryer recipe taste too sweet with 0.5 tbsp condensed milk?"
faqA2: "Condensed milk is about 45% sugar, so even 0.5 tbsp (9 grams) packs sweetness. If your dish is overly sweet, reduce other sugars in the recipe or dilute the condensed milk with a splash of unsweetened milk. Always taste-test air fryer batters or glazes before cooking."
faqQ3: "How should I store leftover condensed milk after measuring 0.5 tbsp?"
faqA3: "Transfer leftovers to an airtight container and refrigerate for up to 2 weeks. To prevent crystallization, press plastic wrap directly onto the milk’s surface before sealing. For frequent use, consider buying condensed milk in squeeze bottles for easier measuring."
faqQ4: "Do US and UK tablespoons measure the same for condensed milk?"
faqA4: "No, US tablespoons are 14.8ml versus the UK’s 15ml. While the difference is slight (0.2ml for 0.5 tbsp), it could affect precision in air fryer recipes. Always specify UK measurements when converting 0.5 tbsp condensed milk to grams (9 grams)."

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on precise ingredient ratios to achieve even cooking and perfect textures. Using the correct weight for 0.5 tbsp of condensed milk (9 grams) prevents overly dense or runny results in desserts like custards or frostings. Many air fryer recipes, such as those in our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert category</a>, require small, exact quantities. A slight variation could alter cooking times or moisture levels, so measuring grams instead of volume is often more reliable.</p>  

<p>Condensed milk is thicker than regular milk, so its weight per tablespoon differs significantly. While 0.5 tbsp of water weighs about 7.5 grams, the same volume of condensed milk is denser at 9 grams. This difference is crucial for air fryer recipes where liquids evaporate quickly. For conversions like 0.5 tbsp condensed milk to grams, always use UK-specific measurements, as tablespoon sizes vary globally. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a> simplifies these calculations.</p>  

<h3>How to measure 0.5 tbsp condensed milk without scales</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have digital scales, use a standard UK tablespoon (15ml) and fill it halfway for 0.5 tbsp (7.5ml), which equals 9 grams of condensed milk. For sticky ingredients like condensed milk, lightly grease the spoon first for easier pouring. Alternatively, use a syringe or medicine cup marked in millilitres for precision. Remember, 0.5 tbsp of condensed milk in grams is consistent across recipes, whether you’re making air fryer cheesecake or caramel drizzle.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for 0.5 tbsp condensed milk in air fryer recipes</h2>  
<p>This small quantity is perfect for adding subtle sweetness without overpowering dishes. Try it in air fryer banana bread glaze, where 0.5 tbsp (9 grams) of condensed milk mixed with cinnamon creates a glossy finish. It’s also ideal for single-serving desserts like mug cakes in our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>cake recipes</a>. The concentrated sweetness means a little goes a long way, helping you control sugar content while maintaining richness.</p>  

<p>For savoury dishes, 0.5 tbsp condensed milk can balance spices in marinades or glazes for air-fried meats.

faqQ1: "Can I use minced garlic instead of crushed garlic for the 2.5 tbsp measurement?"
faqA1: "Yes, but minced garlic is less dense than crushed, so 2.5 tbsp would weigh around 30g instead of 35g. If precision matters, weigh it for accuracy. For recipes where garlic is the star, fresh crushed garlic delivers better flavour."
faqQ2: "How do I convert 2.5 tbsp of crushed garlic to whole cloves?"
faqA2: "One medium garlic clove yields about 1 tsp (5g) when crushed. So 2.5 tbsp (35g) equals roughly 7 cloves. Adjust based on clove size—larger cloves may need fewer, while smaller ones require more."
faqQ3: "Why does my air fryer garlic taste bitter sometimes?"
faqA3: "Bitterness usually means the garlic burned. Air fryers cook quickly, so toss garlic with oil or add it later in cooking. Using the correct 2.5 tbsp (35g) measurement also prevents overpowering flavours."
faqQ4: "Is jarred crushed garlic the same as fresh for weight conversions?"
faqA4: "Jarred garlic often includes preservatives or liquid, making it slightly lighter. Drain it well before measuring. For 2.5 tbsp, fresh crushed garlic weighs 35g, while jarred might be closer to 30–32g."

<h2>Why accurate garlic measurements matter in air frying</h2>  
<p>Garlic is a powerhouse of flavour, but too much or too little can drastically alter your dish. In an air fryer, ingredients cook quickly, so balanced seasoning is key. Using 2.5 tbsp of crushed garlic (35g) ensures your recipes like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>garlic chicken</a> or roasted potatoes turn out perfectly. Overdoing it can lead to bitterness, while too little might leave your meal bland. Our guide helps you nail the measurement every time.</p>  

<p>Precision is especially important for batch cooking or meal prep. If you’re scaling up a recipe, converting tablespoons to grams guarantees consistency. For example, doubling a recipe would mean 70g of crushed garlic instead of guessing with tablespoons. Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a> for dishes where garlic plays a starring role.</p>  

<h3>How to measure crushed garlic accurately</h3>  
<p>Crushed garlic can be tricky to measure because it clumps together. For the most accurate 2.5 tbsp (35g), lightly pack the garlic into the spoon without pressing too hard. If using pre-minced garlic from a jar, drain excess liquid first. Freshly crushed garlic tends to be denser, so adjust slightly if needed.

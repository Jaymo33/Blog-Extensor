faqQ1: "Does the type of sesame oil affect the weight of 3 tablespoons?"
faqA1: "No, both regular and toasted sesame oil weigh the same – 3 tablespoons equal approximately 40.5 grams. The difference lies in flavour intensity, not density. Toasted sesame oil has a stronger taste, so you might use less of it in recipes."
faqQ2: "Can I use the same conversion for other oils in my air fryer?"
faqA2: "Different oils have slightly varying densities, but most cooking oils (like olive or vegetable oil) are close enough that 3 tablespoons will weigh roughly 40-42 grams. For precise air fryer results, it’s best to check specific conversions for each oil type."
faqQ3: "Why should I measure sesame oil by weight instead of volume?"
faqA3: "Weight measurements (grams) are more accurate because oils can settle or create air pockets when measured by volume (tablespoons). This precision matters in air fryer cooking where even small quantity differences can affect crispiness and cooking time."
faqQ4: "How do I convert larger amounts of sesame oil from tablespoons to grams?"
faqA4: "Simply multiply the number of tablespoons by 13.5 (since 1 tbsp ≈ 13.5g). For example, 6 tablespoons would be about 81 grams. This scaling works for any quantity, making it easy to adjust air fryer recipes up or down."

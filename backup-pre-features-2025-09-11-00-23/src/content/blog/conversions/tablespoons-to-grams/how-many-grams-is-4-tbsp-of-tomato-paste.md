faqQ1: "Can I use fresh tomatoes instead of tomato paste in air fryer recipes?"
faqA1: "Yes, but you’ll need to reduce fresh tomatoes to a thick consistency first. Replace 4 tbsp (60g) of tomato paste with about 120g of puréed and simmered fresh tomatoes. Keep in mind this may add extra moisture, so adjust cooking times slightly."
faqQ2: "Does the brand of tomato paste affect the weight per tablespoon?"
faqA2: "Most brands have a similar density, so 4 tbsp should still weigh around 60g. However, thicker or more concentrated pastes might vary slightly. For precision, weighing is always best, especially in air fryer cooking where consistency matters."
faqQ3: "How do I convert grams to tablespoons for other ingredients?"
faqA3: "Check our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a> for common ingredients. Grams are more accurate than volume measurements, so we recommend using a kitchen scale for air fryer recipes."
faqQ4: "Can I freeze leftover tomato paste for later use?"
faqA4: "Absolutely! Portion it into tablespoon-sized amounts (about 15g each) and freeze. Thaw as needed for air fryer recipes—it’s a great way to avoid waste and speed up meal prep."

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on hot air circulation to cook food evenly, so ingredient proportions can make or break a dish. Too much tomato paste, for example, might make a sauce overly thick or sticky.

<p>Tomato paste is a concentrated ingredient, so even small variations in quantity can have a big impact. If you’re adapting a traditional recipe for the air fryer, precise measurements ensure the dish turns out just right. Plus, grams are a more reliable unit than tablespoons, as scoop sizes can vary.

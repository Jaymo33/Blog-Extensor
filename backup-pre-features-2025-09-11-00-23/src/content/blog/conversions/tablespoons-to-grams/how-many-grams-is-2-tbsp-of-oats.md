faqQ1: "Does the type of oat affect how many grams are in 2 tablespoons?"
faqA1: "While different oat types (rolled, jumbo, quick) have slight density variations, 2 tablespoons generally weigh around 16 grams regardless. Steel-cut oats might be marginally heavier due to their larger size, but the difference is minimal for most recipes."
faqQ2: "Can I use a regular spoon to measure 2 tbsp of oats?"
faqA2: "It's best to use proper measuring spoons for accuracy. A regular eating spoon can vary significantly in size. If you must use one, heap the oats slightly to compensate, but investing in measuring spoons or a scale will give more reliable results."
faqQ3: "Why do some recipes use grams instead of tablespoons for oats?"
faqA3: "Weight measurements (grams) are more precise than volume measurements (tablespoons) because they account for how tightly packed the oats are. This precision is especially important in baking and air fryer recipes where consistency matters."
faqQ4: "How many calories are in 2 tbsp (16g) of oats?"
faqA4: "Approximately 60 calories. This makes 2 tablespoons of oats a great portion-controlled addition to meals. When prepared in an air fryer, you can enjoy them with minimal added fats, keeping the calorie count low while maximising nutrition."

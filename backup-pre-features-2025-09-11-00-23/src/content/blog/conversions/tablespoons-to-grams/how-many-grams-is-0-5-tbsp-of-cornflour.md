faqQ1: "Can I use plain flour instead of 0.5 tbsp cornflour in air fryer recipes?"
faqA1: "You can substitute plain flour for cornflour, but you'll need to use twice the amount. Since 0.5 tbsp of cornflour equals 4 grams, you'd need 1 tbsp (about 8 grams) of plain flour. Keep in mind this may affect the texture of your dish, as cornflour creates crispier results in air fryer cooking."
faqQ2: "How do I measure 0.5 tbsp of cornflour without measuring spoons?"
faqA2: "If you don't have measuring spoons, you can use a standard teaspoon - 0.5 tbsp equals 1.5 teaspoons. Alternatively, use a digital scale to measure out 4 grams. For rough estimates, 0.5 tbsp is about the size of two UK 5p coins stacked together in volume."
faqQ3: "Why do some air fryer recipes specify cornflour by weight (grams) rather than volume (tbsp)?"
faqA3: "Weight measurements are more accurate because how you fill a tablespoon can vary. 0.5 tbsp of cornflour (4 grams) is a precise measurement that ensures consistent results. This is especially important in air fryer cooking where small variations can affect cooking times and textures."
faqQ4: "Does the brand of cornflour affect the 0.5 tbsp to grams conversion?"
faqA4: "Most UK cornflour brands have similar densities, so 0.5 tbsp should equal about 4 grams regardless of brand. However, for absolute precision in air fryer recipes, it's best to weigh your cornflour. If switching brands, you might notice slight texture differences due to varying starch content."

faqQ1: "Can I use bottled lemon juice instead of fresh for this conversion?"
faqA1: "Yes, bottled lemon juice works, but check the label for added water or preservatives, which can slightly alter the weight. For best results in air fryer recipes, fresh juice is recommended—it’s brighter in flavour and free from additives."
faqQ2: "Why does 1.5 tbsp of lemon juice weigh 22.5 grams?"
faqA2: "Lemon juice has a density of about 1 gram per millilitre, and 1.5 UK tablespoons equal 22.5ml. Hence, the weight is roughly 22.5 grams. This consistency makes it easy to convert for air fryer recipes."
faqQ3: "How do I adjust lemon juice for a larger air fryer batch?"
faqA3: "Simply multiply the grams proportionally. For example, 3 tbsp would be 45 grams. Always distribute the juice evenly to ensure uniform flavour, especially when air frying proteins or vegetables."
faqQ4: "Does temperature affect the weight of lemon juice in recipes?"
faqA4: "No, the weight remains stable, but cold juice might be slightly denser. For air frying, room-temperature juice blends better with other ingredients, ensuring even coating and cooking."

<p>1.5 tablespoons (tbsp) of lemon juice equals approximately 22.5 grams (g). This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements can make or break a dish. Whether you’re marinating chicken or whipping up a tangy glaze, knowing the exact weight ensures consistency. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we focus on accuracy to help you achieve perfect results every time.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate lemon juice measurements matter</h2>  
<p>Lemon juice is a versatile ingredient in air fryer cooking, used in marinades, dressings, and even desserts. Too much can overpower a dish, while too little might leave it lacking flavour. For example, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>lemon-herb chicken recipe</a> relies on the perfect balance of acidity. Measuring by weight (grams) is more reliable than volume (tablespoons), especially when scaling recipes up or down.</p>  

<p>Air fryers circulate hot air rapidly, which means ingredients cook faster and more evenly. A slight variation in liquid measurements can affect texture and taste. If you’re preparing a <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken dish</a>, 22.5 grams of lemon juice will give you the right tang without drying out the meat. Always use a kitchen scale for the best results.</p>  

<h3>How to measure 1.5 tbsp lemon juice without scales</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a scale, use a standard UK tablespoon (15ml) and fill it 1.5 times for roughly 22.5 grams. Freshly squeezed lemon juice is ideal, but bottled works too—just check for additives.

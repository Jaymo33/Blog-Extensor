<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Using the correct amount of Nutella ensures your air fryer recipes turn out just right. Too much can make desserts overly sweet or sticky, while too little might leave them dry. Grams provide a more precise measurement than tablespoons, especially for dense spreads like Nutella. If you're new to air frying, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a> can help simplify the process. Accurate measurements also make it easier to scale recipes up or down.</p>  

<p>Many air fryer recipes, like Nutella-stuffed cookies or lava cakes, rely on precise quantities. A kitchen scale is the best tool for this, but if you don’t have one, our guide ensures you won’t go wrong. For more delicious ideas, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a>.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure Nutella Without a Scale</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a scale, use levelled tablespoons for accuracy. Scoop the Nutella and level it off with a knife to avoid excess. Remember, 3 tbsp of Nutella equals roughly 54 grams. For sticky ingredients, lightly greasing the spoon can help it slide off easily. This method works well for most air fryer baking recipes.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for 3 Tbsp of Nutella</h2>  
<p>This quantity is perfect for small-batch desserts or toppings. Try swirling it into air-fried pancakes or stuffing it inside croissants for a quick treat. Nutella also works beautifully as a dip for air-fried fruit like bananas or strawberries. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert category</a> for more inspiration.</p>  

<p>You can also use 3 tbsp of Nutella to make a quick chocolate-hazelnut sauce for drizzling. Simply warm it slightly in the air fryer for a few seconds. This measurement is ideal for single servings or small families. For larger batches, simply multiply the amount accordingly.</p>  

<h3>Storing Nutella for Best Results</h3>  
<p>Keep your Nutella in a cool, dry place to maintain its texture. If it hardens, a quick stir or a few seconds in the air fryer can soften it. Always use a clean, dry spoon to prevent spoilage. Proper storage ensures your 3 tbsp measurements remain consistent every time.</p>  

<h2>Converting Other Nutella Measurements</h2>  
<p>Need to adjust your recipe? Here’s a quick reference: 1 tbsp of Nutella is about 18 grams, while ¼ cup is roughly 72 grams. These conversions are handy for scaling air fryer recipes up or down.

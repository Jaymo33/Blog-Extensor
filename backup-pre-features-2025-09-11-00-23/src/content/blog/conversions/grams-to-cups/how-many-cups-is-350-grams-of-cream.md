faqQ1: "Is 350 grams of cream the same as 350ml?"
faqA1: "No, grams and millilitres measure different properties. Cream’s density means 350 grams won’t always equal 350ml. For most creams, 350 grams is roughly 350ml, but it’s best to weigh for accuracy, especially in baking."
faqQ2: "Can I use whipped cream instead of liquid cream for 350 grams?"
faqA2: "Whipped cream has more air, so 350 grams will take up more volume than liquid cream. If your recipe calls for liquid cream, it’s best to stick with that for consistent results. Check the recipe notes for substitutions."
faqQ3: "How do I store leftover cream after measuring 350 grams?"
faqA3: "Store leftover cream in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 3 days. For longer storage, freeze it in portions. Thaw in the fridge before using, and stir well to restore consistency."
faqQ4: "Why do US and UK cup measurements differ for 350 grams of cream?"
faqA4: "The US uses a 240ml cup, while the UK uses 250ml. This small difference affects conversions. Always check your recipe’s origin to ensure you’re using the right measurement. A kitchen scale eliminates this confusion."

<p>350 grams of cream is roughly equivalent to 1.48 cups in standard US measurements, or 1.23 cups in UK metric measurements. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precision ensures perfect texture and consistency. Whether you're whipping up a creamy dessert or a savoury sauce, knowing how to measure cream accurately can make all the difference.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Cream Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>
<p>Using the right amount of cream ensures your air fryer recipes turn out just as intended. Too little cream can leave dishes dry, while too much may make them overly rich or soggy. For example, a creamy pasta bake or a decadent cheesecake requires precise measurements to achieve the ideal balance. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we emphasise the importance of accurate conversions for flawless results every time.</p>
<p>Different types of cream, such as double cream or single cream, may have slight variations in density. However, 350 grams of most standard creams will fall within the 1.48 to 1.23 cup range. Always check your recipe for specific requirements, especially if it’s from a UK or US source, as cup measurements can differ slightly.</p>

<h2>How to Convert 350 Grams of Cream to Cups</h2>
<p>Converting grams to cups isn’t always straightforward, as cream’s density can vary. A general rule is that 350 grams of cream equals about 1.48 US cups or 1.23 UK cups.

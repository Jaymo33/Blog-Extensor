faqQ1: "Can I use frozen chicken breast for 375 grams to cups conversion?"

faqQ2: "How does cooking method affect the cup measurement for 375 grams of chicken breast?"
faqA2: "Cooking shrinks chicken, so raw measurements differ from cooked. 375 grams of raw chicken breast yields about 1.5 to 2 cups, but cooked it reduces to roughly 1 to 1.25 cups. Always measure raw chicken for recipes specifying uncooked quantities."

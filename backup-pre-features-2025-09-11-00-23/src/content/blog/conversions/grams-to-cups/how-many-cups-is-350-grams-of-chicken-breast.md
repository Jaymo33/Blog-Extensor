<p>350 grams of chicken breast roughly equals 1.5 to 2 cups when diced or shredded, depending on the size of the pieces.

<h2>Why Measuring Chicken Breast Accurately Matters</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of chicken breast ensures your air fryer meals cook evenly and taste delicious. Too much chicken can overcrowd the basket, leading to uneven cooking, while too little may dry out quickly. Recipes often list ingredients by weight (grams) or volume (cups), so knowing how to convert between them is crucial.

<p>Chicken breast is a lean protein, and its density affects cup measurements. Diced or shredded chicken fills cups differently than whole breasts, so always consider the preparation method. For example, 350 grams of finely diced chicken may fit into 1.5 cups, while larger chunks could take up to 2 cups. Keeping a kitchen scale handy helps, but if you don't have one, visual estimates work too.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure 350 Grams of Chicken Breast Without a Scale</h3>  
<p>If you don't have a scale, use common household items to estimate 350 grams of chicken breast. A standard chicken breast weighs about 150-200 grams, so 350 grams equals roughly 1.5 to 2 medium-sized breasts. Alternatively, a packed cup of diced chicken is approximately 150-200 grams, meaning 350 grams fills about 1.75 cups.

<h2>Converting Grams to Cups for Different Chicken Cuts</h2>  
<p>Boneless, skinless chicken breast is the most common cut used in air fryer recipes, but thighs and wings have different densities. For example, 350 grams of chicken thighs may yield slightly more cups due to higher fat content. Always adjust measurements based on the cut and cooking method.

<p>When converting 350 grams of chicken breast to cups, consider whether the meat is raw or cooked. Cooked chicken shrinks by about 25%, so 350 grams raw becomes roughly 260 grams cooked. This means cooked chicken will fill fewer cups than raw. If a recipe calls for cooked chicken, adjust your measurements accordingly to avoid over or under-seasoning.</p>  

<h3>Best Air Fryer Recipes Using 350 Grams of Chicken Breast</h3>

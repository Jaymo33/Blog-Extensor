faqQ1: "Does the type of rice affect how many cups 350 grams equals?"
faqA1: "Yes, the type of rice impacts the cup measurement. Long-grain rice like basmati is lighter, so 350 grams fills more cups (about 1.75 US cups). Short-grain or sticky rice is denser, so it may measure closer to 1.5 US cups for the same weight. Always check your recipe for specific rice varieties."
faqQ2: "How do I convert 350 grams of rice to cups without a scale?"
faqA2: "Use the spoon-and-level method: gently spoon rice into a measuring cup and level it off with a knife. For 350 grams, aim for roughly 1.75 US cups or 1.5 UK cups. However, a kitchen scale is more accurate, especially for air fryer recipes where precision matters."
faqQ3: "Why does my air fryer rice turn out dry or uneven?"
faqA3: "Dry or uneven rice often results from incorrect measurements or improper water ratios. Ensure you’re using the right cup conversion for 350 grams of rice and follow air fryer-specific recipes. Overcrowding the basket can also block airflow, leading to uneven cooking."
faqQ4: "Can I use the same conversion for cooked rice?"
faqA4: "No, cooked rice expands and absorbs water, so 350 grams of cooked rice will fill more cups than uncooked. For cooked rice, 350 grams is roughly 2.5 to 3 cups, depending on the rice type. Always measure uncooked rice by weight for recipe accuracy."

<p>350 grams of rice is roughly equivalent to 1.75 cups in standard US measurements or 1.5 cups in UK measurements. This conversion is essential for air fryer cooking, where precise measurements ensure even cooking and perfect texture. Whether you're preparing a quick rice dish or meal prepping, knowing how to convert grams to cups saves time and avoids guesswork.</p>  

<h2>Understanding Rice Measurements for Air Fryers</h2>  
<p>Rice is a staple in many air fryer recipes, from crispy fried rice to steamed sides. However, measuring it correctly is crucial because too much or too little can affect cooking times and results. For 350 grams of rice, the exact cup measurement depends on the type of rice and whether you're using US or UK cups. Long-grain rice, for example, is less dense than short-grain, so the volume may vary slightly.</p>  
<p>If you're using an air fryer, always fluff the rice before measuring for accuracy. Packed rice can lead to over-measuring, which might result in uneven cooking.

<h3>US vs UK Cup Measurements</h3>  
<p>In the US, a standard cup holds 240ml, while a UK cup is slightly larger at 250ml. This means 350 grams of rice equals about 1.75 US cups or 1.5 UK cups. If you're following a recipe from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, always check whether it uses metric or imperial measurements to avoid confusion.</p>  

<h2>Types of Rice and Their Conversions</h2>  
<p>Different rice varieties have different densities, which affects how they measure in cups. For instance, 350 grams of basmati rice will fill more cups than sticky rice due to its lighter, fluffier texture. Here’s a quick guide: long-grain rice (like basmati or jasmine) measures closer to 1.75 US cups, while short-grain (like Arborio) may be closer to 1.5 US cups for the same weight.</p>  
<p>If you're cooking rice in your air fryer, consider the recipe's requirements. Dishes like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>air fryer chicken and rice</a> need precise measurements to ensure the rice cooks evenly alongside the protein. Always weigh your rice if possible for the most accurate results.</p>  

<h3>Why Accuracy Matters in Air Fryer Cooking</h3>  
<p>Air fryers circulate hot air rapidly, so incorrect measurements can lead to dry or undercooked rice. Measuring 350 grams of rice correctly ensures the right water ratio and cooking time. For fluffy rice, use our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer rice recipes</a> as a guide to perfect results every time.</p>  

<h2>Tips for Measuring Rice Without a Scale</h2>  
<p>If you don’t have a kitchen scale, use the spoon-and-level method for cups. Gently spoon rice into a measuring cup and level it off with a knife—never pack it down. For 350 grams, this method should get you close to 1.75 US cups, but a scale is always more reliable.</p>  
<p>Pre-rinsing rice can also affect measurements, as wet rice clumps together. If your recipe calls for rinsed rice, account for the slight volume change.

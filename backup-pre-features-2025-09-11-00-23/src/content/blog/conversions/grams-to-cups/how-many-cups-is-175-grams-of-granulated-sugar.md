faqQ1: "Does 175 grams of granulated sugar measure differently in US and UK cups?"
faqA1: "Yes, there's a slight difference. 175 grams of granulated sugar equals about 0.88 US cups or 0.73 UK cups due to the different cup sizes (240ml vs 284ml). For air fryer recipes, it's best to use grams for complete accuracy."
faqQ2: "Can I use brown sugar instead of granulated sugar in a 175g measurement?"
faqA2: "You can substitute brown sugar, but note it's denser than granulated sugar. 175g of brown sugar would be slightly less in volume (about 0.8 US cups). The moisture content may also affect your air fryer recipe's texture."
faqQ3: "How should I store leftover granulated sugar after measuring 175g for my recipe?"
faqA3: "Store granulated sugar in an airtight container in a cool, dry place. If you frequently bake in your air fryer, consider keeping pre-measured portions (like 175g) ready to use for convenience."
faqQ4: "Why do my air fryer baked goods sometimes turn out too sweet or not sweet enough?"
faqA4: "Inconsistent sugar measurement is often the culprit. Using scales for 175 grams of granulated sugar ensures accuracy. Also, remember air fryers intensify flavours slightly, so you might want to reduce sugar by 10-15% in some recipes."

faqQ1: "Does the type of lentil affect the cup measurement for 400 grams?"
faqA1: "Yes, lentil size and density vary. Smaller lentils like red or split peas pack more tightly, so 400 grams may fill slightly fewer cups than larger green or brown lentils. For accuracy, weigh them or use the spoon-and-level method."
faqQ2: "Can I use the same conversion for cooked lentils?"
faqA2: "No, cooked lentils expand and absorb water, so 400 grams of raw lentils yields about 3–4 cups cooked. Adjust measurements based on whether your recipe calls for raw or pre-cooked lentils."
faqQ3: "Why do US and UK cup sizes differ for measuring lentils?"
faqA3: "The US uses a 240ml cup, while the UK uses 250ml. This small difference adds up in larger quantities, so always check which standard your recipe follows to avoid measurement errors."
faqQ4: "How do I store leftover cooked lentils from a 400-gram batch?"
faqA4: "Store cooked lentils in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 5 days, or freeze them for 3 months. Reheat portions in your air fryer for 3–5 minutes at 180°C for a quick meal."

faqQ1: "Does the type of lentil affect the cup measurement?"
faqA1: "Yes, but only slightly. Red lentils are smaller and may pack more densely, while green or brown lentils are larger. However, the general conversion of 300 grams of lentils to cups (1.5 US or 1.25 UK) works for most varieties. For precise results, weigh them if possible."
faqQ2: "Can I use dry lentils directly in the air fryer?"
faqA2: "It’s best to soak or pre-cook lentils before air frying, as dry lentils won’t soften properly. Soaking reduces cooking time and ensures even texture. For recipes like crispy lentils, parboil them first, then air fry for crunch."
faqQ3: "How do I store cooked lentils for later use?"
faqA3: "Cooked lentils keep well in the fridge for up to 5 days or can be frozen for 3 months. Portion them in airtight containers or freezer bags. When ready to use, reheat in the air fryer at 180°C for 5–7 minutes."
faqQ4: "Why is my lentil dish turning out dry in the air fryer?"
faqA4: "Overcooking or using too few lentils can cause dryness. Stick to the 300 grams of lentils in cups measurement (1.5 US) and avoid over-frying. Adding a bit of oil or moisture-rich ingredients like onions can also help."

faqQ1: "Does the type of milk affect the cup measurement for 325 grams?"
faqA1: "Yes, but only slightly. Whole milk, semi-skimmed, and skimmed milk have similar densities, so 325 grams will still be around 1.35–1.37 cups. Plant-based milks like almond or oat may vary more, so check the packaging for specific conversions."
faqQ2: "Can I use a dry measuring cup for 325 grams of milk?"
faqA2: "It's best to use a liquid measuring cup for accuracy. Dry cups can lead to small errors, which might affect air fryer recipes. For 325 grams of milk, fill a liquid cup to the 1.35-cup (US) or 1.37-cup (UK) mark."
faqQ3: "How do I convert 325 grams of milk to millilitres?"
faqA3: "325 grams of milk is roughly 315ml, as milk's density is close to water. This is useful for recipes that list liquids in millilitres. Always use a measuring jug for liquids to ensure precision."
faqQ4: "Why do UK and US cup measurements differ for 325 grams of milk?"
faqA4: "The UK uses a 250ml cup, while the US uses 240ml. This small difference means 325 grams of milk is 1.37 cups in the UK and 1.35 cups in the US. Always check which measurement system your recipe follows."

This conversion is essential for precise baking and cooking, especially when using an air fryer where measurements matter. Whether you're whipping up a cake or a creamy sauce, knowing how to convert grams to cups ensures your recipe turns out perfectly.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Milk Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Getting the right amount of milk is crucial for recipes, particularly in air fryer cooking where consistency affects texture and cooking time. Too much milk can make batters too runny, while too little can dry out dishes like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>cakes</a> or custards. For air fryer recipes, precision ensures even cooking and perfect results every time.</p>  
<p>Milk density can vary slightly depending on fat content, but for most standard whole or semi-skimmed milk, 325 grams translates to just over 1.3 cups. If you're using a digital scale, weighing ingredients like milk eliminates guesswork and improves accuracy.

<h2>UK vs. US Cup Measurements</h2>  
<p>In the UK, a standard cup holds 250ml, while in the US, it's 240ml. This small difference means 325 grams of milk equals approximately 1.37 cups in the UK and 1.35 cups in the US. If you're following a recipe from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, always check whether it uses UK or US measurements to avoid errors.</p>  

<h3>Converting Grams to Cups for Different Milk Types</h3>  
<p>Whole milk, skimmed milk, and plant-based alternatives like almond or oat milk have slightly different densities. For most dairy milk, 325 grams will still hover around 1.35–1.37 cups, but always double-check if using non-dairy substitutes. A kitchen scale is your best friend for exact measurements, especially when preparing <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>desserts</a> in your air fryer.</p>  

<h2>Tips for Measuring Milk Without a Scale</h2>  
<p>If you don’t have a scale, use a liquid measuring cup for accuracy. Pour milk to the 1.35-cup mark (US) or 1.37-cup mark (UK) for 325 grams. Avoid using dry measuring cups, as they can lead to slight inaccuracies. For air fryer recipes, even small measurement errors can affect cooking times, so precision is key.</p>  
<p>Another handy trick is to remember that 100 grams of milk is roughly 0.4 cups, making it easier to scale up or down. Need to clean your air fryer after a milky recipe?

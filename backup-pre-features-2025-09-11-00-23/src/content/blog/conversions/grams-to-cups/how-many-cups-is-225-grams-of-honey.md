faqQ1: "Is 225 grams of honey the same in US and UK cups?"
faqA1: "No, 225 grams of honey is approximately 0.67 cups in the US measurement system and 0.56 cups in the UK system. The difference comes from the slight variation in cup sizes between the two countries. Always check which measurement system your recipe uses for the best results."
faqQ2: "Can I use a regular cup to measure 225 grams of honey?"
faqA2: "While you can use a regular cup, it's not the most accurate method. For precise measurements, a kitchen scale is best. If using a cup, lightly grease it first to help the honey slide out, and measure to the appropriate mark (0.67 US cups or 0.56 UK cups for 225 grams)."
faqQ3: "Why does honey measurement vary with temperature?"
faqA3: "Honey's viscosity changes with temperature—it becomes thinner when warm and thicker when cool. This affects how it fills a measuring cup. For consistent results, measure honey at room temperature and use the same method each time to minimise variations."
faqQ4: "How do I adjust air fryer cooking times when using honey?"
faqA4: "Honey can cause foods to brown or burn faster due to its sugar content. When using 225 grams of honey in air fryer recipes, reduce the temperature by 10-15°C and check doneness earlier than the recipe suggests. Stir or flip foods more frequently to ensure even cooking."

<p>225 grams of honey is approximately 0.67 cups in the US measurement system and 0.56 cups in the UK measurement system. This conversion is essential for baking and cooking, especially when using an air fryer where precise measurements can make or break a recipe. Whether you're whipping up a cake or glazing chicken, knowing how to convert grams to cups ensures perfect results every time.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Honey Measurements Matter</h2>
<p>Honey is a sticky, dense ingredient that can vary in volume based on temperature and how it's measured. Unlike water, honey doesn't pour easily, making it tricky to measure accurately. For air fryer recipes, where even small deviations can affect cooking times and textures, getting the measurement right is crucial. Too much honey can lead to overly sweet or sticky dishes, while too little might leave your meal lacking flavour.</p>
<p>At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we emphasise the importance of precise measurements for consistent results. Whether you're following a <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>honey-glazed chicken recipe</a> or baking a cake, knowing how many cups 225 grams of honey equals will save you from kitchen mishaps. Always use a kitchen scale for the most accurate measurement, but if you don't have one, this conversion will help.</p>

<h2>US vs UK Cup Measurements for Honey</h2>
<p>It's important to note that US and UK cup measurements differ slightly. In the US, 1 cup is 240 ml, while in the UK, it's 250 ml. This means 225 grams of honey converts to roughly 0.67 US cups or 0.56 UK cups. These differences might seem small, but they can add up in recipes requiring precision.</p>
<p>For air fryer cooking, where ingredients are often compacted or spread thinly, even a slight variation can affect the outcome. If you're using a recipe from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert category</a>, always check whether it follows US or UK measurements. When in doubt, stick to grams for the most reliable results.</p>

<h3>How to Measure Honey Without a Scale</h3>
<p>If you don't have a kitchen scale, you can still measure 225 grams of honey using cups. Lightly grease your measuring cup with oil to help the honey slide out easily. Fill the cup to the appropriate mark (0.67 for US, 0.56 for UK) and level it off with a spatula. This method isn't as precise as weighing but works in a pinch.</p>

<h2>Common Recipes Using 225 Grams of Honey</h2>
<p>225 grams of honey is a common measurement in many air fryer recipes. From glazes for meats like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken</a> to sweetening baked goods, honey adds depth and moisture. For example, a honey-mustard glaze for salmon or a drizzle over roasted vegetables often calls for around this amount.</p>
<p>If you're experimenting with your own recipes, remember that honey burns faster than sugar. In the air fryer, lower temperatures and shorter cooking times are best when using honey.

<h3>Storing Leftover Honey</h3>
<p>If your recipe doesn't use all 225 grams of honey, store the rest in an airtight container at room temperature. Honey doesn't spoil easily but can crystallise over time. To liquefy crystallised honey, gently warm the container in a bowl of warm water.</p>

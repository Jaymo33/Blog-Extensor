faqQ1: "Does the type of pasta affect how many cups 200 grams equals?"
faqA1: "Yes, pasta shape impacts volume. Smaller shapes like macaroni pack more densely, so 200 grams may fill slightly fewer cups than long strands like spaghetti. For air frying, weighing is more accurate than measuring by cups."
faqQ2: "Can I cook 200 grams of pasta directly in the air fryer without boiling it first?"
faqA2: "It’s best to pre-cook pasta al dente before air frying. The air fryer won’t fully hydrate dry pasta, leading to uneven cooking. Boil first, then air fry for a crispy texture."
faqQ3: "How many servings does 200 grams of pasta make?"
faqA3: "200 grams of pasta typically serves two people as a main dish or four as a side. Adjust based on appetite and whether you’re pairing it with other ingredients in your air fryer recipe."
faqQ4: "Is 200 grams of pasta the same in UK and US measurements?"
faqA4: "The weight (200 grams) is the same, but cup sizes differ slightly. A UK cup is 250ml, while a US cup is 240ml. For air fryer recipes, sticking to grams ensures consistency."

<h2>Why Accurate Pasta Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Getting the right amount of pasta is crucial, especially when using an air fryer. Too little, and your dish might dry out; too much, and it won’t cook evenly. 200 grams of pasta in cups is a common query because many recipes list ingredients by weight rather than volume. This is particularly true for air fryer recipes, where precision ensures crispy, evenly cooked results. If you’re new to air frying, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a> has plenty of inspiration.</p>  

<p>Different pasta shapes can also affect how many cups 200 grams of pasta will fill. For example, penne and fusilli take up more space than spaghetti. That’s why weighing your pasta is often more reliable than measuring by volume. If you’re unsure, start with 200 grams of pasta and adjust based on your air fryer’s capacity.

<h2>Converting 200 Grams of Pasta to Cups</h2>  
<p>Converting 200 grams of pasta to cups isn’t an exact science, but a general rule is that 200 grams equals about 2 cups when uncooked. This can vary slightly depending on the pasta type—smaller shapes like macaroni may pack more densely, while long strands like linguine may take up more space.

<h3>UK vs. US Cup Measurements</h3>  
<p>In the UK, a standard cup holds 250ml, while in the US, it’s 240ml. This slight difference means 200 grams of pasta in cups might vary by a tablespoon or so. For air fryer cooking, this minor discrepancy won’t make a huge difference, but it’s worth noting if you’re following a recipe from another country.

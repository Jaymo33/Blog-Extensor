<p>No, you should not put a standard burrito wrapper in an air fryer as most wrappers will melt, burn, or release harmful chemicals. The high heat and rapid air circulation in an air fryer make it unsuitable for typical paper or foil wrappers. Instead, remove the wrapper before cooking or use air fryer-safe alternatives like parchment liners.</p>

<h2>Why Burrito Wrappers and Air Fryers Don’t Mix</h2>
<p>Standard burrito wrappers, whether paper or foil, aren’t designed for the intense heat of an air fryer. Paper wrappers can catch fire at high temperatures, while foil can block airflow and damage your appliance. The circulating hot air in an air fryer reaches up to 200°C, which is far beyond what most wrappers can handle safely.</p>
<p>Some manufacturers claim their wrappers are oven-safe, but air fryers work differently. The concentrated heat and powerful fan create conditions that can melt adhesives or coatings on wrappers.

<h2>What Happens If You Use a Wrapper in the Air Fryer?</h2>
<p>Using the wrong wrapper can lead to several problems. The wrapper might melt onto your food or the air fryer basket, creating a mess that’s difficult to clean. In worst cases, it could smoke or even catch fire, posing a safety risk. The wrapper might also block proper air circulation, resulting in unevenly cooked food.</p>
<p>Some users report success with specific brands of parchment paper designed for air fryers. However, even these should be used with caution and never left unattended.

<h3>Safe Alternatives to Burrito Wrappers</h3>
<p>Instead of risking your wrapper in the air fryer, try these safer methods. You can cook burritos directly in the basket, using a light spray of oil to prevent sticking. Another option is air fryer parchment paper with precut holes for proper airflow. These alternatives give you crispy results without the risks.</p>

<h2>Expert Tips for Air Frying Burritos</h2>
<p>For perfect air-fried burritos every time, remove any wrapper and brush the tortilla lightly with oil. This helps achieve that desirable crispy texture. Cook at 180°C for about 8-10 minutes, flipping halfway through. The exact time may vary depending on your air fryer model and the burrito’s size.</p>
<p>If you’re reheating a pre-made burrito, unwrap it completely first. The high heat can make trapped steam cause the wrapper to burst open messily.

<h3>Materials to Absolutely Avoid in Your Air Fryer</h3>
<p>Beyond burrito wrappers, several materials should never go in your air fryer. These include plastic wrap, wax paper, and most aluminum foils (unless specifically designed for air fryers). These can melt, release toxins, or create fire hazards. Always check manufacturer guidelines for your specific air fryer model.</p>

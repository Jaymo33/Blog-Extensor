<h3>Best Temperature for Reheating Mini Quiche</h3>  
<p>160°C (320°F) is the sweet spot for reheating mini quiche in an air fryer. This temperature warms the filling thoroughly without burning the pastry.

<p>If you’re reheating multiple batches, keep the cooked quiche warm in a low oven. Avoid overcrowding the basket, as this leads to uneven heating. For extra crispiness, lightly spritz the pastry with oil before reheating. Need cleaning tips?

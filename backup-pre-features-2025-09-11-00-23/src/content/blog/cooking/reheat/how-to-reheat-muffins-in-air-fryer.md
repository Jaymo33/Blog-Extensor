faqQ2: "How long does it take to reheat muffins in an air fryer?"
faqA2: "It takes just 3–4 minutes at 160°C (320°F). Larger muffins may need an extra minute, but always check halfway to prevent over-reheating."
faqQ3: "What’s the best temperature to reheat muffins in an air fryer?"

<p>To reheat muffins in an air fryer, set the temperature to 160°C (320°F) and warm them for 3–4 minutes. This method restores their freshness while keeping the inside moist and the top slightly crisp. Whether you’ve stored muffins in the fridge or left them out overnight, an air fryer is the perfect tool for bringing them back to life.</p>

<h2>Why Use an Air Fryer to Reheat Muffins?</h2>
<p>Air fryers circulate hot air around food, making them ideal for reheating baked goods like muffins. Unlike microwaves, which can leave muffins soggy, air fryers revive the texture beautifully. The even heat distribution ensures the muffin warms through without drying out. Plus, you’ll get that lightly crisp top that makes them taste freshly baked.

<p>Reheating muffins in an air fryer is also quicker than using an oven, saving energy and time. It’s perfect for busy mornings when you want a warm treat without the wait. Whether you’re reheating blueberry, chocolate, or savoury muffins, the air fryer delivers consistent results.

<h2>Step-by-Step Guide to Reheating Muffins</h2>
<h3>Preparing Your Muffins</h3>
<p>Before reheating, let refrigerated muffins sit at room temperature for 10 minutes to avoid a cold centre. If the muffins are particularly dry, lightly brush them with melted butter or a sprinkle of water. This helps retain moisture during reheating. For frozen muffins, thaw them first for best results.</p>

<h3>Air Fryer Settings and Timing</h3>
<p>Preheat your air fryer to 160°C (320°F) for 2 minutes. Place the muffins in the basket in a single layer, leaving space for air circulation. Reheat for 3–4 minutes, checking at the halfway mark. Larger muffins may need an extra minute. For a crispier top, increase the temperature to 180°C (350°F) for the last 30 seconds.</p>

<h2>Tips for Perfectly Reheated Muffins</h2>
<p>Avoid overcrowding the air fryer basket, as this can lead to uneven heating. If reheating multiple muffins, work in batches. For extra flavour, try adding a drizzle of honey or a dusting of cinnamon before reheating. If you’re reheating savoury muffins, a light brush of olive oil can enhance the texture.</p>

<p>Store leftover muffins in an airtight container to keep them fresh longer. Reheating muffins the next day works best when they’re properly stored.

<h2>Common Mistakes to Avoid</h2>
<p>Reheating muffins at too high a temperature can dry them out or burn the tops. Stick to 160°C (320°F) for the best balance of warmth and texture. Avoid using foil or parchment paper unless necessary, as it can block airflow. Always check muffins early to prevent over-reheating.</p>

<p>Another mistake is reheating muffins straight from the freezer without thawing. This can result in a cold centre and an overcooked exterior. For frozen muffins, thaw them overnight in the fridge or at room temperature first. Need more help?

<h2>Creative Ways to Serve Reheated Muffins</h2>
<p>Turn reheated muffins into a decadent dessert by serving them warm with a scoop of ice cream. For breakfast, pair them with fresh fruit and yoghurt. Savoury muffins taste great with a dollop of butter or cream cheese. The possibilities are endless when you master reheating muffins in an air fryer.</p>

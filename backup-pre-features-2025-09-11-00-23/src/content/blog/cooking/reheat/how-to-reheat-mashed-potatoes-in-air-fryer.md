<p>Reheating mashed potatoes in an air fryer is simple: set it to 160°C (320°F) and warm them for 3–5 minutes. This method prevents drying while keeping the texture creamy. Whether you’re using leftovers straight from the fridge or frozen, your air fryer can revive mashed potatoes better than a microwave.

<h2>Why Use an Air Fryer to Reheat Mashed Potatoes?</h2>  
<p>The air fryer circulates hot air evenly, reheating mashed potatoes without creating soggy or dry spots. Unlike microwaves, which can make them rubbery, the air fryer preserves the fluffy texture. It’s also faster than reheating in an oven, making it ideal for quick meals. If you love potato dishes, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/potatoes>potato recipes</a> for more inspiration.</p>  

<p>Another advantage is the slight crispiness you can achieve on top if desired. A light spray of oil before reheating adds a golden finish. This method works for both plain and loaded mashed potatoes with cheese or herbs.

<h3>Best Temperature to Reheat Mashed Potatoes</h3>  
<p>160°C (320°F) is the sweet spot for reheating mashed potatoes in an air fryer. Higher temperatures risk drying them out, while lower settings may not warm them thoroughly. If your mashed potatoes contain dairy, like butter or cream, this temperature ensures they heat gently without separating.</p>  

<h2>Step-by-Step Reheating Instructions</h2>  
<p>Start by transferring your mashed potatoes to an air fryer-safe dish or liner. Spread them evenly to promote consistent heating. If they seem dry, mix in a splash of milk or butter before reheating. Covering the dish with foil prevents excessive browning on top.

<p>Preheat your air fryer for 2 minutes to avoid cold spots. Reheat for 3 minutes, then stir and check the temperature. Add another 1–2 minutes if needed. For larger portions, extend the time in 2-minute increments. Always let them rest for a minute before serving to allow even heat distribution.</p>  

<h3>Tips to Prevent Dryness</h3>  
<p>Adding moisture is key to reheating mashed potatoes successfully. A drizzle of broth, melted butter, or cream revitalizes the texture. Stirring halfway through reheating ensures even warmth. For extra creaminess, top with a pat of butter right after removing them from the air fryer.</p>  

<h2>Reheating Frozen Mashed Potatoes</h2>  
<p>Thaw frozen mashed potatoes in the fridge overnight for best results. If reheating straight from frozen, add 2–3 extra minutes and cover with foil. Break up any ice crystals before placing them in the air fryer. Stir every few minutes to distribute heat evenly. For more frozen food tips, see our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/frozen-foods>frozen foods guide</a>.</p>  

<p>Portion frozen mashed potatoes before freezing for easier reheating. Small batches reheat more uniformly than a large block. If they’re still cold in the center after the suggested time, continue in 1-minute intervals. Avoid overcrowding the air fryer basket for optimal airflow.</p>  

<h3>Creative Leftover Ideas</h3>  
<p>Transform reheated mashed potatoes into crispy potato pancakes by mixing in an egg and flour. Shape into patties and air fry at 180°C for 8–10 minutes. Alternatively, use them as a topping for shepherd’s pie or mix with cheese for loaded potato bites.

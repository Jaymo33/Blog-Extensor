<p>30 grams of tomato paste equals approximately 1.06 ounces. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements can make or break a dish.

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on even heat distribution, and incorrect ingredient quantities can affect texture and taste. For example, using too much tomato paste might make a dish overly acidic or thick.

Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for other common measurements.</p>  

<p>Tomato paste is a staple in many recipes, from stews to air-fried meatballs. Its concentrated flavour means small amounts go a long way. If you’re working with 30g tomato paste in ounces, a digital kitchen scale or measuring spoons can help.

<h3>How to measure 30g tomato paste without scales</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a scale, 30g of tomato paste is roughly two tablespoons. However, this can vary slightly depending on the brand and density. For the most accurate 30g tomato paste to oz conversion, a scale is best. Pre-measured tubes or sachets often list weights, making it easier to portion.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for 30g tomato paste in air fryer recipes</h2>  
<p>Tomato paste adds depth to sauces, marinades, and even air-fried vegetables. For instance, a 30g portion (1.06 oz) is perfect for a single-serving pasta sauce or glaze. It’s also great for <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipes</a>, where it enhances flavour without overpowering.</p>  

<p>Another popular use is in homemade air-fryer pizza sauces. Mix 30g tomato paste with herbs and a splash of water for a quick base. For cleaning tips after cooking sticky sauces, visit our guide on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner</a>.</p>  

<h3>Storing leftover tomato paste</h3>

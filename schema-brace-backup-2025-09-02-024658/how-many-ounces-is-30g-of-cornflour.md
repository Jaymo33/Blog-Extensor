<p>30g of cornflour equals approximately 1.06 ounces. This conversion is essential for anyone using air fryer recipes or baking, where precise measurements can make or break a dish. Whether you're following a recipe from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> or experimenting with your own creations, knowing how to convert grams to ounces ensures accuracy.</p>

<h2>Why Convert 30g of Cornflour to Ounces?</h2>
<p>Many UK recipes, especially those for air fryers, use metric measurements like grams. However, some kitchen scales or older recipes might list ingredients in ounces. Converting 30g of cornflour to ounces (1.06 oz) helps you stay consistent. This is particularly useful for air fryer batters or coatings, where the right texture matters. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more handy tips.</p>
<p>Cornflour is a staple in many air fryer recipes, from crispy coatings to thickening sauces. Whether you're making chicken tenders or a dessert, getting the measurement right ensures perfect results. If you're new to air frying, browse our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a> for inspiration.</p>

<h2>How to Measure 30g of Cornflour Accurately</h2>
<p>For the most precise measurement, use a digital kitchen scale set to grams. Scoop the cornflour into a bowl until the scale reads 30g. If you don’t have a scale, 30g is roughly 2 tablespoons, but this can vary slightly depending on how packed the flour is. Always level off the top for consistency.</p>
<p>When preparing air fryer recipes, accuracy is key. Too much cornflour can make coatings overly dense, while too little might leave them soggy.

<h2>Converting Other Cornflour Measurements</h2>

<h3>Tips for Storing Cornflour</h3>

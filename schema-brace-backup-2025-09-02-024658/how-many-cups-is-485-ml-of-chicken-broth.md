<p>485 ml of chicken broth is approximately 2 cups, but precise measurements can make all the difference in your air fryer recipes. Whether you're making a hearty soup or a flavourful sauce, knowing the exact conversion ensures your dish turns out perfectly every time. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we’re all about helping you nail those measurements for flawless cooking.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>
<p>Using the right amount of liquid, like 485 ml of chicken broth, can affect the texture and flavour of your dish. Too much broth might make your recipe soggy, while too little could leave it dry. Air fryers circulate hot air, so precise measurements help maintain the perfect balance. For more tips on air fryer cooking, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipes</a> section.</p>
<p>Chicken broth is a staple in many dishes, from soups to casseroles. Converting 485 ml of chicken broth to cups ensures you’re following recipes correctly, especially when scaling up or down. If you’re unsure about other conversions, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> is a handy resource.</p>

<h2>How to Measure 485 ml of Chicken Broth Without a Measuring Cup</h2>
<p>Don’t have a measuring cup? No problem. You can use a standard mug, but keep in mind that mugs vary in size. A typical UK mug holds about 250 ml, so 485 ml would be just under two mugs. For accuracy, a kitchen scale set to millilitres is your best bet. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipe category</a> for dishes that use chicken broth.</p>

<h3>Does the Type of Chicken Broth Affect the Measurement?</h3>
<p>Whether you’re using homemade or store-bought chicken broth, 485 ml will always equate to roughly 2 cups. However, thicker broths or those with added ingredients might settle differently, so stirring before measuring is wise.

<h2>Common Recipes Using 485 ml of Chicken Broth</h2>
<p>Many air fryer recipes call for 485 ml of chicken broth, such as creamy chicken pasta or vegetable stew. This measurement is often used because it provides enough liquid to cook ingredients evenly without overwhelming them. For inspiration, browse our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipes</a> section.</p>
<p>If you’re adapting a stovetop recipe for the air fryer, converting 485 ml of chicken broth to cups ensures you’re not over or under-liquiding. The air fryer’s intense heat means liquids evaporate faster, so accuracy is key. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a> can help with other measurements too.</p>

<h3>Tips for Storing Leftover Chicken Broth</h3>
<p>If you’ve measured out 485 ml of chicken broth but don’t need it all, store the rest in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 3 days. Alternatively, freeze it in ice cube trays for easy portioning later.

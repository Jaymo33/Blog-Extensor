<p>1 tablespoon (tbsp) of minced garlic weighs approximately 8 grams. This measurement is key for air fryer recipes where precision ensures even cooking and perfect flavour. Whether you're whipping up garlic-infused chicken or roasted vegetables, knowing the exact weight helps avoid overpowering or underwhelming your dish.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate minced garlic measurements matter</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of minced garlic can make or break your air fryer recipes. Too little, and you'll miss that punchy garlic flavour; too much, and it can overwhelm other ingredients. For dishes like garlic butter shrimp or crispy garlic potatoes, 8 grams per tablespoon is the sweet spot. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more handy measurement guides.</p>  

<p>Garlic's potency varies depending on how finely it's minced, so weighing ensures consistency. If you're prepping ahead, consider mincing garlic in bulk and storing it in the fridge or freezer. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipes section</a> has plenty of ideas for using minced garlic efficiently.</p>  

<h3>Converting minced garlic for different recipes</h3>  
<p>Many air fryer recipes call for minced garlic by volume (tablespoons), but weighing it in grams is far more accurate. For example, if a recipe requires 2 tbsp of minced garlic, you'll need 16 grams. This precision is especially useful for meal prepping or scaling recipes up or down.</p>  

<h2>Tips for measuring minced garlic</h2>  
<p>To get the most accurate measurement, lightly pack the minced garlic into your tablespoon without pressing too hard. Level it off with a knife for consistency. If you're using pre-minced garlic from a jar, note that it may weigh slightly more due to added moisture or oils. For fresh garlic, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetables category</a> has great tips on prepping and storing.</p>  

<p>Investing in a small digital kitchen scale can revolutionise your air fryer cooking. It takes the guesswork out of measurements, ensuring your garlic mushrooms or garlic bread turn out perfectly every time. Don't forget to clean your air fryer after cooking garlic-heavy dishes – our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning guide</a> makes it easy.</p>  

<h3>Common minced garlic measurement mistakes</h3>  
<p>One frequent error is confusing minced garlic with garlic powder or granules. These have different weights and potencies – 1 tbsp of garlic powder weighs about 9 grams but packs much more flavour. Always check whether your recipe specifies fresh minced garlic or powdered alternatives.</p>  

<h2>Using minced garlic in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Minced garlic works beautifully in air fryer recipes, from garlic parmesan chicken wings to roasted garlic potatoes. The hot circulating air perfectly caramelises the garlic, creating deep, rich flavours without burning. For inspiration, browse our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipes</a> featuring garlic as a star ingredient.</p>  

<p>When adding minced garlic to air fryer dishes, timing is crucial. Adding it too early can cause burning, while adding it too late might leave it raw and pungent. A good rule of thumb is to mix minced garlic with a little oil and add it during the last few minutes of cooking for perfect results.</p>

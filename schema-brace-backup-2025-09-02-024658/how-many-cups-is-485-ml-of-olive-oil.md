<p>485 ml of olive oil equals approximately 2.05 cups. This conversion is essential for precise cooking and baking, especially when using an air fryer where measurements can make or break a recipe. Whether you're following a dish from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> or adjusting a family favourite, knowing how to convert 485 ml of olive oil to cups ensures consistency.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Frying</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on precise ingredient ratios to achieve the perfect texture and flavour. Too much or too little olive oil can affect crispiness and cooking times. For example, a recipe calling for 485 ml of olive oil in cups (2.05 cups) ensures even coating for dishes like roasted vegetables or crispy chicken. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for other common measurements.</p>  

<p>Using the correct amount of olive oil also prevents excess smoke or uneven cooking. A slight deviation, like mistaking 485 ml for 2 cups instead of 2.05 cups, might seem minor but can impact results. For air fryer recipes requiring precision, always measure carefully.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure 485 ml of Olive Oil Without a Scale</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a measuring jug, use standard cup measurements. Since 1 cup equals roughly 237 ml, 485 ml of olive oil is just over 2 cups (2.05 cups). For best results, use a liquid measuring cup with clear ml and cup markings. This method works well for recipes like those in our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable category</a>.</p>  

<h2>Converting 485 ml of Olive Oil for Baking</h2>  
<p>Baking demands even stricter measurements than air frying. When a recipe lists 485 ml of olive oil, converting it to cups (2.05 cups) ensures the right moisture and texture. Too much oil can make cakes greasy, while too little may dry them out. For baking tips, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a>.</p>  

<p>Olive oil adds richness to baked goods, but accuracy is key. If substituting butter, note that 485 ml of olive oil equals roughly 2.05 cups, while 485 grams of butter is closer to 2.14 cups. Always adjust based on your recipe’s requirements.</p>  

<h3>US vs. UK Cup Measurements for 485 ml of Olive Oil</h3>  
<p>While 485 ml converts to 2.05 US cups, UK cups differ slightly (1 UK cup = 284 ml). For UK readers, 485 ml is about 1.71 UK cups. Double-check your recipe’s origin to avoid confusion. Most air fryer recipes on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> use US measurements unless specified.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for 485 ml of Olive Oil</h2>  
<p>From marinades to dressings, 485 ml (2.05 cups) of olive oil is a versatile quantity. It’s enough to coat a large batch of air-fried potatoes or prepare a herb-infused oil for dipping bread.

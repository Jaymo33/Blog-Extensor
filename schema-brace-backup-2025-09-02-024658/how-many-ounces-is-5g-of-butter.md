<p>5 grams of butter equals approximately 0.18 ounces. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precision matters, ensuring your dishes turn out perfectly every time. Whether you're baking, frying, or roasting, knowing how to convert grams to ounces can make all the difference.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Butter Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of butter in your air fryer recipes ensures consistency and flavour. Too little, and your dish might turn out dry; too much, and it could become greasy. For example, a recipe calling for 5g of butter (0.18 ounces) needs to be spot-on for the best results. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we emphasise precision to help you cook like a pro.</p>  

<p>Many UK recipes use grams, while others prefer ounces, so knowing how to convert between the two is handy. A digital kitchen scale is the best tool for this, but if you don’t have one, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> can help. Whether you're making crispy potatoes or a buttery dessert, accurate measurements are key.</p>  

<h2>How to Measure 5g of Butter Without a Scale</h2>  
<p>If you don’t have a scale, you can still measure 5g of butter using tablespoons or teaspoons. One teaspoon of butter is roughly 5g (0.18 ounces), making it a handy alternative. However, for baking recipes, especially those in your air fryer, a scale is more reliable.</p>  

<p>Butter packaging often has markings to help you measure by sight. A standard UK block of butter is 250g, so 5g is about 1/50th of the block. For more tips on measuring ingredients, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipes section</a>, where precision is prioritised for perfect air fryer meals.</p>  

<h3>Common Uses for 5g of Butter in Air Fryer Cooking</h3>  
<p>5g of butter might seem small, but it’s perfect for lightly coating vegetables, adding richness to sauces, or greasing air fryer baskets. For example, tossing broccoli in 5g of melted butter before air frying enhances flavour without overpowering it. Visit our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetables category</a> for more inspiration.</p>  

<h2>Converting Other Butter Measurements</h2>  
<p>If your recipe calls for larger amounts, like 50g or 100g of butter, the same principles apply. 50g equals roughly 1.76 ounces, while 100g is about 3.53 ounces. Keeping a conversion chart handy, like the one on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, saves time and ensures accuracy.</p>  

<p>For those who love baking in their air fryer, precise butter measurements are crucial. Whether you're making cookies or cakes, even a small discrepancy can affect texture. Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>cakes category</a> for recipes where every gram counts.</p>  

<h3>Tips for Storing and Using Butter in Air Fryer Recipes</h3>  
<p>Butter should be stored in the fridge but softened slightly before use for even mixing. For air fryer recipes, melted butter works best for coating, while cold butter is ideal for pastry. Always measure butter after melting if the recipe specifies it.</p>

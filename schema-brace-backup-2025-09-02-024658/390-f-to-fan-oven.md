<p>390 F converts to approximately 175 C in a fan oven. This is a common temperature for roasting vegetables, baking cookies, or crisping up frozen foods in both fan ovens and air fryers. The conversion is essential for UK cooks who follow American recipes or use appliances with Fahrenheit settings.</p>

<h2>Understanding 390 F in Fan Ovens</h2>
<p>Fan ovens circulate hot air for even cooking, which means they typically require lower temperatures than conventional ovens. When converting 390 F to a fan oven, you'll need to reduce the temperature by about 20 C from the standard conversion. This adjustment prevents overcooking while maintaining the same delicious results.</p>
<p>Many modern air fryers operate similarly to fan ovens, using rapid air technology. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we recommend starting with 175 C when adapting 390 F recipes for either appliance. Check our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for precise adjustments across different cooking methods.</p>

<h3>Why 390 F Works for Fan Cooking</h3>
<p>This temperature hits the sweet spot for Maillard reactions - the chemical process that creates golden-brown crusts on foods. Whether you're using a fan oven or air fryer, 390 F (175 C fan) delivers enough heat for caramelisation without burning. It's ideal for <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken wings</a>, roasted potatoes, and even some baked goods.</p>

<h2>Converting Other Temperatures</h2>
<p>While we've focused on 390 F, the same principles apply across temperature ranges. For every 25 F difference, adjust by about 10 C in your fan oven. This rule of thumb helps when working with various recipes from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>our collection</a> or international sources.</p>
<p>Remember that cooking times may vary between fan ovens and air fryers. The compact size of air fryers means they often cook faster than full-sized ovens, even at identical temperatures. Always check food a few minutes early when trying new conversions.</p>

<h3>Air Fryer Adjustments for 390 F</h3>
<p>Most air fryers don't display Fahrenheit, making conversions like 390 F essential. If your model has presets, the "roast" or "bake" function at 175 C will approximate 390 F perfectly. For foods that normally cook at 390 F in conventional ovens, reduce cooking time by 20% in air fryers.</p>

<h2>Common Foods Cooked at 390 F</h2>
<p>This temperature works beautifully for crispy <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/potatoes>roast potatoes</a>, achieving that perfect balance of fluffy inside and crunchy exterior. It's also excellent for reheating pizza or cooking frozen snacks like spring rolls. The high heat ensures quick cooking without drying out the interior.</p>
<p>When baking at 390 F (175 C fan), cookies spread nicely while developing chewy centres. Muffins and scones benefit from the initial high heat which helps them rise before forming golden tops. Always preheat your fan oven or air fryer for best results at this temperature.</p>

<h3>Troubleshooting 390 F Conversions</h3>
<p>If foods brown too quickly at 390 F in your fan oven, try reducing the temperature by another 10 C. Conversely, if they're not crisping enough, extend cooking time rather than increasing heat. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning guide</a> can help maintain your appliance's performance for accurate temperature control.</p>

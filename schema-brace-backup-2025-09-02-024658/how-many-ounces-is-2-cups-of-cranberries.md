<p>2 cups of cranberries weigh approximately 8 ounces (or 226 grams). This measurement is essential for air fryer recipes, ensuring your dishes turn out perfectly every time. Whether you're making cranberry sauce, muffins, or a festive roast, accurate measurements matter.</p>  

<h2>Why measuring cranberries correctly matters</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of cranberries ensures balanced flavours and textures in your air fryer dishes. Too many cranberries can make a dish overly tart, while too few might leave it lacking. For recipes like cranberry-studded stuffing or air-fried desserts, precision is key. Visit <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes</a> for inspiration on using cranberries in your air fryer.</p>  

<p>Fresh cranberries are lighter than dried ones, so always measure by volume or weight for consistency. If you're adapting a recipe from cups to ounces, this conversion will save time and hassle. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for other handy measurements.</p>  

<h3>How to measure cranberries accurately</h3>  
<p>For the best results, use a kitchen scale to weigh your cranberries. If you don’t have one, lightly pack the cranberries into a measuring cup without crushing them. Avoid heaping the cup, as this can lead to uneven measurements. For more tips, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert recipes</a> featuring cranberries.</p>  

<h2>Converting cups to ounces for UK cooks</h2>  
<p>In the UK, recipes often use grams or ounces rather than cups. Knowing that 2 cups of cranberries equal 8 ounces (or 226 grams) simplifies adapting American recipes. This is especially useful for air fryer cooking, where precise quantities affect cooking times.</p>  

<p>If you're working with frozen cranberries, note that they may weigh slightly more due to ice crystals. Thaw and drain them before measuring for the most accurate results. For more air fryer tips, visit <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>.</p>  

<h3>Common uses for 2 cups of cranberries</h3>  
<p>Two cups of cranberries are perfect for making a small batch of cranberry sauce in your air fryer. They’re also ideal for adding to muffins, cakes, or even savoury dishes like glazed meats. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable recipes</a> for creative ways to incorporate cranberries.</p>  

<h2>Adjusting recipes for different cranberry forms</h2>  
<p>Dried cranberries weigh less than fresh ones—about 5 ounces per cup. If substituting dried for fresh, adjust quantities and add extra liquid to avoid dryness. Always refer to your recipe’s specific requirements for the best outcome.</p>  

<p>For cleaning your air fryer after cooking with cranberries (which can be sticky), our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning guide</a> has you covered. Proper maintenance ensures your appliance stays in top condition for future recipes.</p>

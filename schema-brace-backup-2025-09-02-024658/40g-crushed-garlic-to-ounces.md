<p>40g of crushed garlic equals approximately 1.41 ounces. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements can make all the difference. Whether you're whipping up garlic-infused dishes or experimenting with new flavours, knowing the exact weight ensures consistency. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we help simplify cooking conversions so you can focus on creating mouthwatering meals.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Garlic Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Garlic is a powerhouse ingredient that can elevate any dish, but too much or too little can throw off the balance.

<h3>How to Measure Crushed Garlic</h3>  
<p>Measuring crushed garlic can be tricky due to its sticky texture. A kitchen scale is the most accurate tool, but if you don’t have one, 40g roughly equals 8 teaspoons.

<h3>Converting Other Garlic Measurements</h3>

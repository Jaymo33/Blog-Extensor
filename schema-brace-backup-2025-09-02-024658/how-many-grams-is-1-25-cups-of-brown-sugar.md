<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Baking</h2>  
<p>Baking in an air fryer requires precision, as even small measurement discrepancies can affect texture and taste. Brown sugar, in particular, can vary in density depending on how it's packed. Using grams instead of cups eliminates guesswork, ensuring your <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> turn out perfectly every time. Whether you're making cookies or cakes, accuracy is key.</p>  

<p>Many air fryer recipes, especially those from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, provide measurements in grams for reliability. If you're adapting a traditional oven recipe for your air fryer, converting cups to grams is a must. This avoids under or over-measuring, which can lead to dry or overly dense results. Always use a kitchen scale for the best accuracy.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure Brown Sugar Correctly</h3>  
<p>To measure 1.25 cups of brown sugar accurately, lightly spoon it into the measuring cup and level it off. Avoid packing it down unless the recipe specifies "firmly packed." For gram conversions, a digital scale is your best friend. This method ensures you get the right amount every time, whether you're baking <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cookies>cookies</a> or a cake.</p>  

<h2>Common Conversions for Brown Sugar</h2>  
<p>Beyond 1.25 cups, here are some other handy brown sugar conversions: 1 cup equals 200 grams, and 0.5 cups equal 100 grams. These conversions are crucial for scaling recipes up or down. If you're working with a recipe that uses metric measurements, knowing these equivalents saves time and hassle.</p>

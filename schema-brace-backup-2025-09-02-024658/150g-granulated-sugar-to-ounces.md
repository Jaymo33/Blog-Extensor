<h3>Does Sugar Type Affect the Conversion?</h3>
<p>Granulated sugar’s density means 150g will always convert to roughly 5.29 ounces. Other sugars, like brown or caster, may vary slightly due to moisture content. However, for most air fryer recipes, granulated sugar is the go-to choice. Its fine texture ensures even distribution and consistent results. Stick to 150g (5.29 oz) for reliable outcomes in your baking.</p>

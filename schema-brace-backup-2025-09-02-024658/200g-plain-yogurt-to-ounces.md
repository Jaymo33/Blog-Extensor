<p>200g of plain yogurt is approximately 7.05 ounces. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements can make or break your dish. Whether you're whipping up a creamy dip or a fluffy cake, knowing how to convert grams to ounces ensures consistency. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we help simplify these conversions so you can focus on cooking.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on precise ingredient ratios to deliver perfect results. Too much or too little yogurt can affect texture, moisture, and cooking time. For example, adding 200g of plain yogurt (7.05 oz) to a batter ensures even browning and a light crumb. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more handy tips.</p>  

<p>Many UK recipes use grams, while others prefer ounces. Converting 200g plain yogurt to ounces (7.05 oz) bridges this gap. This is especially useful for baking, where small deviations can lead to dense or dry results. If you're meal prepping, accurate measurements also help with portion control.</p>  

<h3>How to measure 200g of plain yogurt without a scale</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a scale, use a measuring cup. 200g of plain yogurt equals roughly ¾ cup plus 1 tablespoon. However, density can vary slightly between brands, so a scale is ideal.

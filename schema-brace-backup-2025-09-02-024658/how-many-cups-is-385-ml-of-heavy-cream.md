<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Using the correct amount of heavy cream is crucial in air fryer recipes. Too little can leave your dish dry, while too much may cause excess moisture, affecting crispiness. For example, if you're making a creamy pasta bake in your air fryer, 385 ml of heavy cream (1.63 cups) provides the ideal richness without overpowering other ingredients.

Use leftovers in air fryer recipes like creamy soups or whipped toppings for desserts. Don’t forget to keep your air fryer clean with our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning guide</a> to maintain optimal performance.</p>

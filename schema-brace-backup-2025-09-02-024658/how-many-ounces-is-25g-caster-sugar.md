<p>25g of caster sugar equals approximately 0.88 ounces. This conversion is essential for air fryer baking, where precision can make or break your recipe. Whether you're whipping up cakes, cookies, or desserts, knowing how to convert grams to ounces ensures your measurements are spot-on. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we understand the importance of accuracy, especially when working with delicate ingredients like caster sugar.</p>

<h2>Why Convert 25g of Caster Sugar to Ounces?</h2>
<p>Many UK recipes use grams, but some kitchen scales or international recipes might list ingredients in ounces. Converting 25g of caster sugar to ounces (0.88 oz) helps you follow recipes accurately, whether you're baking a cake or making air fryer cookies. Precision is key in baking, as even small measurement errors can affect texture and taste. For more conversion tips, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>
<p>Air fryers heat quickly and evenly, so using the right amount of sugar ensures your baked goods caramelise perfectly. Too much sugar can lead to over-browning, while too little might leave your treats lacking sweetness. Whether you're making <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>cakes</a> or <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cookies>cookies</a>, this conversion is a game-changer.</p>

<h2>How to Measure 25g of Caster Sugar Without Scales</h2>
<p>If you don't have scales, you can still measure 25g of caster sugar (0.88 oz) using tablespoons. One level tablespoon of caster sugar weighs about 12.5g, so two tablespoons will give you roughly 25g. This method isn't as precise as weighing but works in a pinch. For best results, we recommend investing in digital scales for air fryer baking.</p>
<p>When measuring caster sugar, avoid packing it down, as this can lead to using more sugar than intended. Fluff the sugar with a spoon before measuring to ensure accuracy. For more baking tips, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a> at airfryerrecipe.co.uk.</p>

<h3>The Difference Between Caster Sugar and Granulated Sugar</h3>
<p>Caster sugar has finer grains than granulated sugar, which makes it dissolve faster—ideal for air fryer baking. While 25g of caster sugar equals 0.88 oz, the same weight of granulated sugar will have a slightly different volume due to grain size. Always check your recipe to see which type of sugar is specified.</p>

<h3>Common Uses for 25g of Caster Sugar in Air Fryer Recipes</h3>
<p>25g of caster sugar (0.88 oz) is often used in small-batch air fryer desserts like mug cakes, shortbread, or fruit crumbles. It's also perfect for sweetening whipped cream or dusting over churros. For inspiration, try our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert recipes</a> designed specifically for air fryers.</p>

<h2>Tips for Baking with Caster Sugar in Your Air Fryer</h2>
<p>Air fryers circulate hot air, which can cause sugars to caramelise quickly. When using 25g of caster sugar (0.88 oz) in recipes, keep an eye on cooking times to prevent burning. Lower temperatures and shorter cooking times often work best for sugary treats. Always preheat your air fryer for even baking.</p>
<p>After baking, clean your air fryer promptly to prevent sugar residues from hardening. Our guide on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaning</a> makes maintenance a breeze. Remember, accurate measurements like 25g of caster sugar to ounces (0.88 oz) are the first step to air fryer baking success.</p>

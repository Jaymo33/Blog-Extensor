<p>335°F converts to Gas Mark 3 in UK ovens and air fryers. This medium-low temperature is perfect for slow baking, roasting vegetables, or cooking delicate dishes that need gentle heat. Whether you're using a traditional oven or modern air fryer, understanding this conversion helps achieve consistent results.</p>

<h2>Understanding 335 F to Gas Mark Conversion</h2>
<p>The Gas Mark system is uniquely British, with temperatures ranging from Gas Mark ¼ to Gas Mark 9. At 335°F (168°C), you're working with Gas Mark 3, which sits comfortably in the middle of the scale. Many classic British recipes, especially those for cakes and biscuits, call for this precise temperature. When using an air fryer, you might need to adjust cooking times slightly as they circulate heat more efficiently than conventional ovens.</p>
<p>For those who love baking, <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> offers fantastic dessert recipes specifically tested for air fryer temperatures. The 335 F to Gas Mark conversion works equally well for savoury dishes too - think slow-roasted tomatoes or perfectly baked potatoes. Remember that oven thermostats can vary, so it's always worth investing in an oven thermometer for accuracy.</p>

<h2>How to Use 335 F in Your Air Fryer</h2>
<p>Modern air fryers typically display temperatures in Celsius or Fahrenheit, but understanding the Gas Mark equivalent helps when converting traditional recipes. At 335 F (Gas Mark 3), your air fryer becomes ideal for baking scones, roasting nuts, or cooking fish fillets. The rapid air circulation means you might reduce cooking times by 10-15% compared to conventional oven instructions.</p>
<p>When adapting recipes from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>cake recipes</a> to your air fryer, the 335 F to Gas Mark conversion remains consistent. However, you may need to use smaller baking tins or adjust quantities to fit your air fryer basket. For best results, preheat your air fryer for 3-5 minutes before adding food, just as you would with a conventional oven.</p>

<h3>Common Foods Cooked at 335 F (Gas Mark 3)</h3>
<p>This temperature works beautifully for delicate baked goods that need gentle, even heat. Victoria sponge cakes, shortbread biscuits, and meringues all thrive at 335 F to Gas Mark 3. It's also excellent for slow-roasting vegetables like peppers or aubergines, allowing their natural sugars to caramelise without burning.</p>

<h2>Temperature Conversion Charts</h2>
<p>While we've focused on 335 F to Gas Mark 3, having a full conversion chart handy makes kitchen life easier. Our comprehensive <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> covers all common temperature equivalents. Remember that fan-assisted ovens (common in the UK) cook about 20°C hotter than conventional ovens at the same Gas Mark setting.</p>
<p>When converting American recipes that use Fahrenheit to British Gas Mark measurements, the 335 F to Gas Mark 3 conversion is just one of many you'll need. For perfect results every time, consider bookmarking our conversion resources or printing a chart for your kitchen. This becomes especially helpful when working with temperamental ingredients like chocolate or delicate pastries.</p>

<h3>Adjusting Cooking Times at Gas Mark 3</h3>
<p>While the 335 F to Gas Mark conversion gives you the right temperature, cooking times may vary between appliances. Air fryers typically cook faster than conventional ovens, so start checking food 5-10 minutes before the recipe suggests. For example, a cake that takes 30 minutes in a conventional oven at Gas Mark 3 might be done in 22-25 minutes in an air fryer at the same temperature.</p>

<h2>Troubleshooting 335 F Cooking</h2>
<p>If foods aren't cooking evenly at 335 F to Gas Mark 3, your appliance might need calibration. Many modern ovens and air fryers allow temperature adjustment in their settings. Regular cleaning also ensures accurate temperature distribution - check out our guide on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>keeping your air fryer in top condition</a>.</p>
<p>Another common issue at this temperature is over-browning before food cooks through. If you notice this happening, try reducing the temperature by 10°F (to 325 F/Gas Mark 2-3) and extending the cooking time slightly. For foods that need crispiness, like roast potatoes, you might finish them at a higher temperature for the last few minutes.</p>

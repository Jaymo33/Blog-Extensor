<p>4 tablespoons (tbsp) of rapeseed oil equals approximately 54 grams (g). This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements can make or break your dish. Whether you’re frying, roasting, or baking, knowing the exact weight ensures consistent results every time.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on hot air circulation to cook food evenly, and using the right amount of oil is crucial. Too little oil can leave food dry, while too much can make it greasy. Rapeseed oil, with its high smoke point and neutral flavour, is a popular choice for air frying. By converting 4 tbsp of rapeseed oil to grams, you can follow recipes more accurately and achieve better results.</p>

Whether you’re preparing crispy vegetables or golden chicken wings, precise oil measurements ensure your dishes turn out perfectly every time.</p>  

<h3>How to measure rapeseed oil accurately</h3>  
<p>Using a kitchen scale is the most reliable way to measure 4 tbsp of rapeseed oil in grams. Simply tare your scale with an empty container, then pour the oil until it reaches 54 grams. If you don’t have a scale, a standard UK tablespoon holds roughly 13.5 grams of rapeseed oil, so 4 tbsp would be close to 54 grams.</p>

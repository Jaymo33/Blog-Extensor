<p>260 ml of yogurt equals approximately 1.1 cups. This conversion is essential for precise baking and cooking, especially when using an air fryer. Whether you're whipping up a cake or a savoury dish, knowing exact measurements ensures perfect results every time.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Yogurt Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of yogurt can make or break a recipe. Too much can make baked goods dense, while too little can dry them out. For air fryer recipes, consistency is key—whether you're making <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>cakes</a> or marinating chicken. A slight variation in yogurt quantity can alter texture and taste.</p>  

<p>Yogurt is a versatile ingredient, often used in both sweet and savoury dishes. From marinades to batter, its acidity and creaminess enhance flavours. That’s why converting 260 ml of yogurt to cups accurately ensures your dish turns out just right. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more handy measurement tips.</p>  

<h2>How to Measure 260 ml of Yogurt Without a Scale</h2>  
<p>Not everyone has a kitchen scale, but measuring cups are common. To measure 260 ml of yogurt, fill a standard measuring cup just over the 1-cup line. Since 1 cup equals 240 ml, you’ll need an extra 20 ml—roughly a tablespoon and a teaspoon.</p>  

<h3>Using Metric and Imperial Measurements</h3>  
<p>In the UK, metric measurements like millilitres are standard, while the US often uses cups. If you’re following a recipe from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, knowing both systems helps. For 260 ml of yogurt, 1.1 cups is the closest imperial equivalent.</p>  

<h2>Common Recipes Using 260 ml of Yogurt</h2>  
<p>Yogurt is a staple in many air fryer recipes. From fluffy pancakes to tender chicken, it adds moisture and richness. Try using 260 ml in our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/breakfast>breakfast recipes</a> for a protein-packed start to your day.</p>  

<p>For baking, 260 ml of yogurt works wonders in cakes and muffins. Its acidity reacts with baking soda, creating a light, airy texture. If you're making a marinade, this quantity is perfect for coating four chicken breasts evenly. Always measure carefully for best results.</p>  

<h3>Adjusting Recipes for Different Yogurt Types</h3>  
<p>Greek yogurt is thicker than regular yogurt, so 260 ml will weigh more. If substituting, you may need to adjust liquids in the recipe. For air fryer cooking, thicker yogurts work better as coatings, while runnier yogurts are ideal for batters.</p>  

<h2>Cleaning Up After Measuring Yogurt</h2>  
<p>Yogurt can be sticky, so clean your measuring tools promptly. Use warm soapy water or our recommended <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner</a> for stubborn residue. Proper maintenance keeps your kitchen tools in top shape for accurate measurements every time.</p>

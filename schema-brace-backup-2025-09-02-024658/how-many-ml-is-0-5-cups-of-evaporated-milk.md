<p>0.5 cups of evaporated milk equals approximately 118 ml. This conversion is essential for precise baking and cooking, especially when using an air fryer where exact measurements matter. Whether you're whipping up a creamy dessert or a savoury dish, knowing this conversion ensures consistency in your recipes.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Using the correct amount of evaporated milk can make or break a recipe. Too little, and your dish might lack creaminess; too much, and it could become overly dense. Air fryer recipes, in particular, rely on precise measurements for even cooking. For more conversions, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>  

<p>Evaporated milk is thicker than regular milk, so measuring it correctly ensures your dishes turn out as intended. Whether you're making a custard or a sauce, 0.5 cups (118 ml) is a common measurement in many recipes. If you're unsure, always measure liquids in a clear jug at eye level for accuracy.</p>  

<h3>Converting Cups to ml for Evaporated Milk</h3>  
<p>The standard conversion for liquid measurements is 1 cup = 236.59 ml. Therefore, 0.5 cups of evaporated milk is half of that, which is roughly 118 ml. This applies whether you're in the UK or the US, as metric measurements are universal in cooking.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for Evaporated Milk in Air Fryer Recipes</h2>  
<p>Evaporated milk is a staple in many air fryer recipes, from creamy pasta bakes to rich desserts. Its concentrated texture adds depth without excess moisture, making it ideal for air frying. For inspiration, browse our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> collection.</p>  

<p>Popular dishes include mac and cheese, bread pudding, and even some cake batters. Since air fryers cook quickly, the right balance of ingredients ensures perfect results. Always measure evaporated milk carefully to avoid altering the dish's texture.</p>  

<h3>Tips for Measuring Evaporated Milk</h3>  
<p>Use a liquid measuring cup for accuracy, and fill it just below the rim to prevent spills. If you don’t have a measuring cup, a kitchen scale can help—118 ml of evaporated milk weighs roughly 122 grams. For more tips, visit <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>.</p>  

<h2>Substitutes for Evaporated Milk</h2>  
<p>If you're out of evaporated milk, you can make a substitute by simmering regular milk until it reduces by half. Alternatively, half-and-half or cream diluted with water can work in a pinch. Just remember to adjust measurements accordingly.</p>  

<p>When substituting, keep in mind that texture and sweetness may vary. For air fryer recipes, consistency is key, so stick to evaporated milk when possible. Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert recipes</a> for ideas using this ingredient.</p>  

<h3>Cleaning Your Air Fryer After Using Evaporated Milk</h3>  
<p>Evaporated milk can leave sticky residues if spilled. Always wipe down your air fryer basket after use with warm, soapy water. For stubborn stains, check out our guide on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaning</a>.</p>

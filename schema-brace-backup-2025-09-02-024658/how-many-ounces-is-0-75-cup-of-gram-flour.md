Whether you're making crispy snacks or fluffy baked goods, knowing how to convert cups to ounces is a game-changer. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we focus on helping you achieve culinary success with accurate measurements and easy-to-follow guides.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Using the correct amount of gram flour can make or break your air fryer recipes. Too much or too little can affect texture, crispiness, and even cooking times. For example, if you're making gram flour-coated chicken or vegetable fritters, 0.75 cup of gram flour (3.17 oz) ensures the perfect crispy coating. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more handy measurement tips.</p>  

<p>Gram flour, also known as besan, is a staple in many cuisines, especially in Indian and Middle Eastern cooking. Its nutty flavour and binding properties make it ideal for air fryer recipes like pakoras or savoury pancakes. Measuring 0.75 cup of gram flour correctly (3.17 oz) ensures consistency, whether you're meal prepping or cooking for a crowd.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure 0.75 Cup of Gram Flour Accurately</h3>  
<p>To measure 0.75 cup of gram flour, use a dry measuring cup and level it off with a straight edge for precision. If you don’t have a measuring cup, a kitchen scale set to ounces (3.17 oz) works perfectly.

<h2>Common Uses for 0.75 Cup of Gram Flour in Air Fryers</h2>  
<p>From crispy snacks to gluten-free baking, 0.75 cup of gram flour (3.17 oz) is versatile. Try it in air-fried onion bhajis, gram flour muffins, or even as a coating for tofu. The key is ensuring the right balance—too little flour won’t bind, while too much can make dishes dense.

<p>1.5 tablespoons (tbsp) of hot sauce weighs approximately 22.5 grams. This conversion is essential for precise cooking, especially when using an air fryer, where ingredient ratios can affect texture and flavour. Whether you're making spicy wings or a zesty marinade, knowing the exact weight ensures consistency in your dishes. For more handy conversions, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on even heat distribution, so precise ingredient measurements help avoid soggy or unevenly cooked food. Hot sauce, with its varying thickness, can be tricky to measure by volume alone. Converting 1.5 tbsp of hot sauce to grams (22.5g) ensures you’re adding the right amount of heat without overpowering your dish. This is especially useful for recipes like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>spicy air fryer chicken</a>, where balance is key.</p>  

<p>Using grams instead of tablespoons also eliminates guesswork when scaling recipes up or down. If you’re meal prepping or adjusting spice levels, weight measurements provide reliability. Plus, many UK recipes list ingredients in grams, making this conversion a must-know for home cooks. For more tips, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipe collection</a>.</p>  

<h3>How to measure 1.5 tbsp of hot sauce accurately</h3>  
<p>For the most precise measurement, use a digital kitchen scale. Simply tare your bowl or spoon, then pour the hot sauce until it reaches 22.5 grams. If you don’t have a scale, level off your tablespoon with a knife to ensure an exact 1.5 tbsp portion. Remember, thicker hot sauces may weigh slightly more, so adjust if needed.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for 1.5 tbsp of hot sauce in air fryer recipes</h2>  
<p>This quantity is perfect for marinating proteins like chicken or tofu, adding a kick to <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>roasted vegetables</a>, or mixing into dips. For example, tossing 22.5 grams of hot sauce with olive oil and spices creates a bold coating for air-fried wings. It’s also ideal for balancing flavours in sauces without overwhelming milder ingredients.</p>  

<p>If you’re reheating leftovers, a dash of hot sauce (1.5 tbsp or 22.5g) can revive flavours lost during storage. Just be mindful of sodium content if you’re watching your intake. For cleaning sticky residue from hot sauce spills, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner guide</a> has you covered.</p>  

<h3>Adjusting heat levels with precision</h3>  
<p>Knowing that 1.5 tbsp equals 22.5 grams lets you tweak spice levels confidently. Start with half this amount if you’re sensitive to heat, then gradually increase. For fiery dishes, pair it with other spices like smoked paprika or cayenne. The key is consistency—weighing ensures every batch tastes just right.</p>

<p>2.25 cups of half and half is equivalent to approximately 532.32 millilitres (ml). This conversion is essential for precise cooking and baking, especially when using an air fryer where accurate measurements can make or break a recipe. Whether you’re whipping up a creamy sauce or baking a decadent dessert, knowing how to convert cups to millilitres ensures consistency and perfect results every time.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>When using an air fryer, precise measurements are crucial because the cooking process is faster and more intense than traditional methods. Too much or too little liquid, like half and half, can affect texture and flavour. For example, adding too much half and half to a batter might make it too runny, while too little could result in a dry, crumbly finish. That’s why converting 2.25 cups of half and half to ml (532.32 ml) is so important for air fryer recipes.</p>  
<p>If you’re exploring new recipes, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipe collection</a> for inspiration. Many of these dishes rely on precise measurements to achieve the perfect balance of flavours and textures. Whether you’re making a creamy pasta sauce or a rich dessert, knowing how to convert cups to millilitres will help you nail the recipe every time.</p>  

<h2>How to Measure Half and Half Correctly</h2>  
<p>Measuring half and half accurately starts with using the right tools. A liquid measuring cup is ideal for this task, as it allows you to see the exact volume at eye level. Pour the half and half slowly into the cup until it reaches the 2.25-cup mark. For even greater precision, a kitchen scale can be used to weigh the half and half, as 532.32 ml of half and half weighs roughly 532 grams.</p>  
<p>If you’re working with a recipe that calls for millilitres, a measuring jug with ml markings is your best bet. Simply fill it to the 532 ml line for 2.25 cups of half and half. This method eliminates guesswork and ensures your air fryer dishes turn out perfectly every time. For more tips on accurate measurements, take a look at our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>  

<h3>US vs UK Measurements</h3>  
<p>It’s worth noting that cup measurements can vary slightly between the US and UK. In the US, 1 cup is 240 ml, while in the UK, it’s 250 ml. For this conversion, we’ve used the US standard (2.25 cups x 236.59 ml per cup = 532.32 ml). If you’re following a UK recipe, double-check the cup size to avoid discrepancies. Most modern recipes specify which measurement system they use, but when in doubt, stick to millilitres for accuracy.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for Half and Half in Air Fryer Recipes</h2>  
<p>Half and half is a versatile ingredient that adds richness to both savoury and sweet dishes. In air fryer cooking, it’s often used in creamy sauces, custards, and even some baked goods. For example, a classic mac and cheese made in the air fryer might call for 2.25 cups of half and half to create a smooth, velvety cheese sauce. Similarly, a bread pudding or French toast casserole could use this measurement for a luscious, creamy texture.</p>  
<p>If you’re looking for recipe ideas, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert category</a> features several dishes that incorporate half and half. From creamy custards to indulgent cakes, these recipes showcase how precise measurements can elevate your air fryer cooking. Remember, 2.25 cups of half and half equals 532.32 ml, so you can confidently adapt any recipe to your preferred measurement system.</p>  

<h3>Substitutes for Half and Half</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have half and half on hand, you can make a substitute by mixing equal parts whole milk and heavy cream. For 2.25 cups (532.32 ml), combine 1.125 cups of milk with 1.125 cups of cream. This blend will mimic the richness and texture of half and half, ensuring your air fryer recipes turn out just as delicious. Alternatively, evaporated milk or a plant-based creamer can work in a pinch, though the flavour and consistency may vary slightly.</p>  

<h2>Tips for Storing Half and Half</h2>  
<p>To keep half and half fresh, always store it in the refrigerator at or below 4°C. Once opened, it should be used within 7–10 days for the best quality. If you’ve measured out 2.25 cups (532.32 ml) but don’t need it all, transfer the remaining half and half to an airtight container to prevent spoilage. For longer storage, half and half can be frozen, though it may separate slightly when thawed. Stir well before using it in your air fryer recipes.</p>

<p>960 ml of orange juice equals approximately 4.06 cups. This conversion is essential for baking, cooking, or preparing air fryer recipes where precise measurements matter. Whether you're whipping up a citrus glaze or a marinade, knowing how to convert millilitres to cups ensures your dish turns out perfectly every time.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>When using an air fryer, precise measurements can make or break a recipe. Too much liquid, like orange juice, can affect cooking times and textures. For example, a marinade with 960 ml of orange juice needs the right balance to avoid soggy results. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we emphasise the importance of accurate conversions for flawless dishes.</p>  

<p>Recipes often list ingredients in millilitres or cups, depending on the region. In the UK, millilitres are standard, while cups are more common in the US. Converting 960 ml of orange juice to cups (4.06) ensures you follow recipes correctly, whether you're baking a cake or preparing a glaze for air-fried chicken.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure 960 ml of Orange Juice</h3>  
<p>To measure 960 ml of orange juice, use a liquid measuring jug with millilitre markings. If you only have cups, fill just over 4 cups (4.06 cups precisely). For air fryer recipes, like those on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>our recipes page</a>, small deviations can be adjusted during cooking, but precision ensures consistency.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for 960 ml of Orange Juice</h2>  
<p>960 ml of orange juice is a versatile quantity for cooking and baking. It’s enough for a large batch of marinade, a citrusy cake, or a refreshing glaze for air-fried desserts. Check out <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>our dessert category</a> for inspiration on how to use this measurement creatively.</p>  

<p>In air fryer cooking, orange juice can tenderise meats or add brightness to sauces. For example, 960 ml of orange juice could be reduced to a syrup for drizzling over air-fried pastries. Precision ensures the right balance of sweetness and acidity, elevating your dish.</p>

For glazes, apply them in the last few minutes of cooking.

<p>2 tablespoons (tbsp) of baking soda equals approximately 28 grams (g). This conversion is essential for precise baking or cleaning, especially when using an air fryer. Whether you're whipping up a cake or deep-cleaning your appliance, knowing the exact weight ensures consistent results.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Using the correct amount of baking soda can make or break your air fryer recipes. Too much can leave a bitter taste, while too little might not provide the desired rise. For example, if you're making air fryer cookies from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>our recipe collection</a>, precise measurements ensure perfect texture and flavour.</p>  

<p>Baking soda also plays a role in cleaning your air fryer. A mix of baking soda and water can tackle stubborn grease, but the right ratio is key. Check out <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>our cleaning guide</a> for tips on maintaining your appliance.</p>  

<h3>How to measure 2 tbsp of baking soda without a scale</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a digital scale, use a standard UK tablespoon for accuracy. Fill it level with baking soda, avoiding heaping or compacting. Two level tablespoons will give you roughly 28 grams, ideal for recipes like air fryer cakes from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>our cake category</a>.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for 2 tbsp of baking soda in air fryers</h2>  
<p>Beyond baking, 2 tbsp of baking soda (28g) can be used to deodorise or clean your air fryer. A paste made with water helps remove grease, while a sprinkle absorbs odours between uses. For more kitchen hacks, explore <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>our conversion chart</a> for other handy measurements.</p>  

<p>In cooking, this amount is often used in recipes like air fryer pretzels or soda bread. If you're preparing <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable dishes</a>, a pinch of baking soda can help soften tougher veggies during cooking.</p>  

<h3>Does baking soda brand affect weight?</h3>  
<p>Most UK baking soda brands have similar densities, so 2 tbsp should consistently weigh around 28g. However, if your soda is clumpy, sift it before measuring for accuracy. This is especially important for air fryer recipes where precise leavening is crucial.</p>

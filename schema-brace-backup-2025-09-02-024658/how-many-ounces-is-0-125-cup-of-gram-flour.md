<p>0.125 cup of gram flour equals approximately 0.5 ounces (oz). This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements can make or break your dish. Whether you're whipping up crispy pakoras or fluffy gluten-free treats, knowing the exact weight ensures consistency. Gram flour, also known as besan, is a staple in many cuisines, and getting the measurements right is key to perfect results.

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on even cooking, and incorrect measurements can lead to uneven textures or undercooked food. For example, using too much gram flour in a batter can make it dense, while too little might not provide enough structure. This is especially important for recipes like onion bhajis or gluten-free muffins, where the flour's weight impacts the final product. A kitchen scale is your best friend here, but if you don't have one, our conversion guide will help.

<h3>How to Measure 0.125 Cup of Gram Flour Without a Scale</h3>  
<p>If you don't have a scale, use the spoon-and-level method to measure gram flour. Lightly spoon the flour into a measuring cup and level it off with a knife for accuracy. Remember, 0.125 cup is equivalent to 2 tablespoons, which weighs roughly 0.5 ounces. This method works well for small quantities, but for larger batches, investing in a scale is advisable.

<h2>Common Uses for Gram Flour in Air Fryer Recipes</h2>  
<p>Gram flour is incredibly versatile and works wonders in air fryer recipes. It's perfect for coating vegetables, making crispy fritters, or even binding ingredients in gluten-free dishes. For instance, you can use it to create crunchy cauliflower bites or savoury pancakes. The key is to measure accurately—0.125 cup (0.5 oz) is often enough for small batches.

<h3>Tips for Storing Gram Flour</h3>  
<p>To keep gram flour fresh, store it in an airtight container in a cool, dry place. This prevents clumping and preserves its nutty flavour, ensuring your air fryer dishes turn out perfectly every time. If you're using it frequently, consider buying in small quantities to maintain freshness. Proper storage also makes measuring easier, as clumpy flour can throw off your measurements.

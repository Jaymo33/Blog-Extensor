<p>1.25 cups of powdered milk equals approximately 3.5 ounces (or 3.5 oz). This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements ensure the best results. Whether you're making a creamy sauce or baking a cake in your air fryer, knowing the exact weight of powdered milk helps maintain consistency.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on even heat distribution, so ingredient ratios must be spot-on. Too much or too little powdered milk can affect texture and taste, especially in recipes like air fryer cheesecakes or breaded coatings. For more tips on perfecting your air fryer dishes, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a>.</p>  

<p>Powdered milk is a staple in many kitchens, and converting cups to ounces ensures you never over or under-measure. If you're scaling a recipe up or down, this conversion is invaluable. For a full breakdown of common air fryer conversions, visit our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a>.</p>  

<h3>How to measure powdered milk correctly</h3>  
<p>Always spoon powdered milk into a measuring cup and level it off with a knife for accuracy. Scooping directly from the bag can compact the powder, leading to incorrect measurements. This method ensures you get the right amount—3.5 ounces for 1.25 cups—every time.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for powdered milk in air fryer recipes</h2>  
<p>Powdered milk is often used in air fryer baking, such as cakes, bread, and coatings for fried foods. It adds richness without the moisture of liquid milk, which can affect crispiness. For dessert inspiration, browse our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>cake recipes</a>.</p>  

<p>It's also great for making dry mixes or marinades. If you're meal prepping, powdered milk saves fridge space and lasts longer. Need to clean your air fryer after cooking? Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning guide</a> has you covered.</p>  

<h3>Converting other powdered milk quantities</h3>  
<p>If your recipe calls for a different amount, here's a quick reference: 1 cup of powdered milk equals 2.8 ounces, while 2 cups equal 5.6 ounces. This makes scaling recipes straightforward, whether you're cooking for one or a crowd.</p>  

<h2>Tips for storing powdered milk</h2>  
<p>Keep powdered milk in an airtight container in a cool, dry place to prevent clumping. Proper storage ensures it stays fresh for months, ready for your next air fryer adventure. For more kitchen hacks, explore <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>.</p>

<p>1.5 cups of chicken broth equals 355 ml, making it easy to measure for your air fryer recipes. Whether you’re preparing soups, sauces, or marinades, this conversion ensures accuracy for perfect results every time. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we know precise measurements are key to nailing your dishes, especially when using an air fryer.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Using the correct amount of liquid, like chicken broth, ensures your air fryer meals cook evenly and retain moisture. Too little broth can dry out your dish, while too much may lead to soggy results. For recipes like air-fried chicken or roasted vegetables, 355 ml (1.5 cups) of broth is often ideal. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for other common measurements.</p>  

<p>Chicken broth adds depth to dishes like air-fryer risotto or gravy, so getting the ml conversion right is crucial. If you’re scaling a recipe, remember that 1.5 cups (355 ml) works for both UK and US measurements. For more recipe ideas, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> collection.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure 1.5 Cups of Chicken Broth Without a Measuring Cup</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a measuring cup, use a standard metric jug to measure 355 ml directly. Alternatively, 1.5 cups is roughly three-quarters of a 500 ml bottle. For consistent results, always level off the broth when measuring. Need more tips? Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipe category</a> has plenty of inspiration.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for 1.5 Cups of Chicken Broth in Air Fryer Recipes</h2>  
<p>This quantity is perfect for marinating proteins or creating a flavourful base for air-fried dishes. Try it in a herb-infused broth for chicken thighs or as a deglazing liquid for air-fryer pan sauces. The 355 ml measurement ensures balanced seasoning without overpowering your meal.</p>  

<p>For meal prep, 1.5 cups (355 ml) of broth can be portioned into freezer bags for future use. Simply thaw and add to your air fryer when needed. Looking for cleaning tips after cooking?

<h3>Adjusting Recipes When You Only Have ml Measurements</h3>  
<p>If a recipe lists ml instead of cups, remember that 355 ml equals 1.5 cups. This is handy for international recipes or when using pre-packaged broth. For more conversions, bookmark our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a>.</p>

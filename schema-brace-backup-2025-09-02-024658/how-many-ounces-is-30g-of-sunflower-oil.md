<p>30g of sunflower oil is approximately 1.06 ounces. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements can affect texture and cooking times. Whether you’re making crispy fries or a moist cake, knowing how to convert grams to ounces ensures consistent results every time.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of sunflower oil can make or break your air fryer dish. Too little oil, and your food may turn out dry; too much, and it could become greasy. Air fryers rely on hot air circulation, so even small variations in oil quantities can impact cooking. For perfect results, always measure your ingredients carefully, especially when following recipes from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>.</p>  

<p>Sunflower oil is a popular choice for air frying due to its high smoke point and neutral flavour. Whether you’re preparing vegetables, chicken, or even desserts, knowing how to convert 30g of sunflower oil to ounces helps you stick to the recipe. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more handy measurement tips.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure Sunflower Oil Without Scales</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have kitchen scales, you can still measure 30g of sunflower oil using tablespoons. One tablespoon of sunflower oil weighs roughly 14g, so 30g is just over two tablespoons. This method isn’t as precise as using scales, but it works in a pinch for recipes like those found in our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipes section</a>.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for 30g of Sunflower Oil in Air Fryers</h2>  
<p>30g of sunflower oil is often used for coating vegetables, marinating meats, or greasing air fryer baskets. For example, crispy potatoes or roasted chicken thighs often call for this amount. The oil helps achieve that golden, crunchy texture air fryers are famous for. Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/potatoes>potato recipes</a> for inspiration.</p>  

<p>Sunflower oil is also great for baking in air fryers. Cakes and muffins benefit from a light coating of oil to prevent sticking.

<h3>Storing and Handling Sunflower Oil</h3>  
<p>To keep sunflower oil fresh, store it in a cool, dark place away from direct sunlight. Always seal the bottle tightly to prevent oxidation. If you’re using it frequently in your air fryer, consider keeping a small bottle handy near your cooking station.

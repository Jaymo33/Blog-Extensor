<p>0.25 cup of sunflower seeds equals approximately 1.25 ounces (35 grams). This measurement is essential for air fryer recipes where precision ensures even cooking and perfect texture. Whether you're sprinkling them over a salad or using them as a coating for chicken, knowing the exact weight helps avoid over or under-seasoning.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on hot air circulation to cook food evenly, and incorrect ingredient quantities can lead to uneven results. Too many sunflower seeds, for example, might create a clumpy coating, while too few won’t provide enough crunch. That’s why converting 0.25 cup of sunflower seeds to ounces (1.25 oz) ensures consistency in your dishes.</p>  
<p>If you’re new to air frying, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for other common measurements. It’s a lifesaver when adapting traditional recipes for your air fryer. Plus, sunflower seeds add a nutritious boost to meals, packed with healthy fats and protein.</p>  

<h2>How to Measure Sunflower Seeds for Air Fryer Recipes</h2>  
<p>Using a kitchen scale is the most accurate way to measure 0.25 cup of sunflower seeds in ounces. However, if you don’t have one, a standard measuring cup will do. Just ensure the seeds are level with the rim for precision. Loose or packed measurements can vary slightly, so weighing is ideal.</p>  

<h3>Common Uses for Sunflower Seeds in Air Fryer Cooking</h3>  
<p>Sunflower seeds work wonderfully as a crunchy topping for air-fried vegetables or as a binder in veggie burgers. Try them in our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> for added texture. They also make a great alternative to breadcrumbs for a gluten-free coating on chicken or fish.</p>  

<h2>Converting Other Sunflower Seed Measurements</h2>  
<p>If your recipe calls for a different amount, here’s a quick reference: 1 cup of sunflower seeds equals roughly 5 ounces (140 grams). Half a cup is about 2.5 ounces (70 grams). These conversions help when scaling recipes up or down for your air fryer.</p>  
<p>For more tips on air fryer measurements, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable recipes</a>, where precise quantities ensure perfect roasting every time. Sunflower seeds pair especially well with roasted sweet potatoes or Brussels sprouts.</p>  

<h3>Storing Sunflower Seeds for Freshness</h3>  
<p>To keep sunflower seeds fresh, store them in an airtight container in a cool, dark place. If you buy in bulk, consider freezing portions to maintain their crunch. Proper storage ensures they’re ready whenever you need 0.25 cup (1.25 oz) for your next air fryer creation.</p>  

<h2>Frequently Asked Questions About Sunflower Seeds in Air Fryers</h2>  
<p>Many home cooks wonder if sunflower seeds can be toasted in the air fryer. Absolutely! Spread them in a single layer and cook at 160°C (320°F) for 3–5 minutes, shaking occasionally. This enhances their nutty flavour, perfect for salads or snacks.</p>

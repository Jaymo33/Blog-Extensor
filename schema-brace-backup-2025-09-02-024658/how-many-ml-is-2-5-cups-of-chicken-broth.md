<p>Use a liquid measuring cup for accuracy when portioning 2.5 cups (591.47 ml) of chicken broth. Place the cup on a flat surface and pour until the meniscus aligns with the 2.5-cup mark. For smaller quantities, a kitchen scale set to millilitres can also work. This method is particularly useful for air fryer cooking, where precision is key.</p>

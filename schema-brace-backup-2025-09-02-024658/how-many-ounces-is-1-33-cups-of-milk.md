<p>1.33 cups of milk equals approximately 10.64 ounces. This conversion is essential for precise measurements in air fryer recipes, ensuring your dishes turn out perfectly every time. Whether you're making a creamy sauce or a baked dessert, knowing how to convert cups to ounces can make all the difference.</p>

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of milk in your air fryer recipes ensures consistent results. Too much or too little can affect texture and flavour, especially in dishes like cakes or custards. For example, a <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>moist cake</a> requires precise liquid measurements to avoid dryness or sogginess.</p>  
<p>Air fryers cook food quickly, so even small measurement errors can lead to overcooking or undercooking. That's why converting 1.33 cups of milk to ounces (10.64 oz) helps maintain accuracy. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for other common measurements.</p>

<h2>How to measure 1.33 cups of milk accurately</h2>  
<p>For the best results, use a liquid measuring cup to measure 1.33 cups of milk. Fill it just below the 1 1/3 cup mark to avoid spills. If you don't have a measuring cup, a kitchen scale can help—simply weigh out 10.64 ounces.</p>  
<p>Remember, milk expands slightly when heated, so adjust accordingly for recipes like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>air fryer desserts</a>. For more tips on measuring ingredients, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning and maintenance guide</a> to keep your tools in top shape.</p>

<h3>Converting other milk measurements</h3>  
<p>If your recipe calls for a different amount of milk, here are some quick conversions: 1 cup = 8 ounces, 2 cups = 16 ounces, and 0.5 cup = 4 ounces. These conversions are handy for scaling recipes up or down.</p>

<h3>Using milk substitutes in air fryer recipes</h3>  
<p>Plant-based milks like almond or oat milk can also be measured as 1.33 cups = 10.64 ounces. However, their consistency may vary, so adjust cooking times slightly. For more recipe ideas, visit <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>.</p>

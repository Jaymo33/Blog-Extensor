<h2>Why accurate sugar measurements matter in air fryer baking</h2>
<p>Air fryers cook food faster and more evenly than conventional ovens, so precise measurements are crucial. Too much or too little sugar can affect texture, browning, and even cooking times. For example, 1.75 cups of caster sugar to ounces (12.25 oz) is a common measurement for many <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>air fryer cake recipes</a>. Getting it right ensures your bakes rise perfectly and have the ideal sweetness.</p>
<p>Using the correct weight (ounces) rather than volume (cups) is especially important for caster sugar, as it’s finer than granulated sugar. This means it packs differently, and 1.75 cups of caster sugar to oz will yield a slightly different weight compared to granulated. Always measure by weight for the best results in your air fryer.</p>

<h3>How to measure 1.75 cups of caster sugar accurately</h3>
<p>To measure 1.75 cups of caster sugar in ounces, use a kitchen scale for precision. Scoop the sugar into a measuring cup without packing it down, then level it off with a knife. If you don’t have a scale, remember that 1 cup of caster sugar is roughly 7 oz, so 1.75 cups equals 12.25 oz. For more tips, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a>.</p>

<h2>Common uses for 1.75 cups of caster sugar in air fryer recipes</h2>
<p>This measurement is often used in larger batches of desserts, like sponges or cookies. For instance, a classic Victoria sponge made in the air fryer might call for 1.75 cups of caster sugar (12.25 oz) to achieve the perfect lightness. It’s also a handy quantity for <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>air fryer desserts</a> like meringues or custards.</p>
<p>If you’re adapting a traditional recipe for the air fryer, converting 1.75 cups of caster sugar to ounces ensures you maintain the right balance of ingredients. The air fryer’s rapid air circulation can intensify flavours, so accurate measurements prevent overly sweet or bland results. Always double-check your conversions for the best outcome.</p>

<h3>Tips for storing caster sugar for air fryer baking</h3>
<p>Keep caster sugar in an airtight container to maintain its fine texture. Humidity can cause clumping, which affects how 1.75 cups of caster sugar measures in ounces. For long-term storage, consider a cool, dry place away from direct sunlight. Proper storage ensures your sugar is ready for all your <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> creations.</p>

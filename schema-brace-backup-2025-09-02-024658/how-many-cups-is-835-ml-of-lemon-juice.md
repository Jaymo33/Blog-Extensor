<p>835 ml of lemon juice is approximately 3.5 cups. This conversion is essential for baking, cooking, or preparing air fryer recipes where precision matters. Whether you're whipping up a zesty marinade or a tangy dessert, knowing the exact measurement ensures perfect results every time.</p>  

<h2>Understanding the Conversion</h2>  
<p>Converting millilitres to cups can be tricky, especially when dealing with liquids like lemon juice. The standard conversion is 1 cup equals 240 ml, meaning 835 ml of lemon juice translates to roughly 3.5 cups. This measurement is crucial for recipes where acidity and liquid balance affect the outcome.</p>  

<p>If you're using an air fryer, precise measurements help avoid soggy or overly dry dishes. For example, a lemon drizzle cake or citrus-glazed chicken requires the right amount of lemon juice. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more handy measurement tips.</p>  

<h3>Why Accuracy Matters</h3>  
<p>Lemon juice is highly acidic, and even small variations can alter the taste and texture of your dish. Too much can overpower other flavours, while too little might leave your recipe lacking zest. Measuring 835 ml of lemon juice correctly ensures consistency, whether you're cooking or baking.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for 835 ml of Lemon Juice</h2>  
<p>This quantity is often used in large-batch recipes, such as lemon curd, salad dressings, or marinades. If you're preparing a family-sized meal or meal-prepping, knowing how many cups 835 ml of lemon juice equals saves time and hassle.</p>  

<p>For air fryer enthusiasts, lemon juice is a staple for deglazing pans or adding brightness to proteins. Try our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>lemon-herb chicken recipe</a>, where precise measurements make all the difference. The acidity also helps tenderise meat, so getting the amount right is key.</p>  

<h3>Measuring Without a Scale</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a measuring jug, you can use standard cups to measure 835 ml of lemon juice. Fill a cup to the 240 ml mark three times, then add half a cup to reach 3.5 cups total. This method works well for home cooks who prefer simplicity.</p>  

<h2>Adjusting Recipes for Different Quantities</h2>  
<p>Sometimes, recipes call for odd measurements like 835 ml of lemon juice. If you need to scale up or down, remember that 1 cup equals 240 ml. For smaller batches, halve the amount, or double it for larger gatherings.</p>  

<p>Air fryer recipes often require adjustments due to the appliance's compact size. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert category</a> includes lemon-based treats where precise measurements ensure perfect results. Whether it's a tart or a glaze, accuracy is everything.</p>  

<h3>Storing Leftover Lemon Juice</h3>  
<p>If you have leftover lemon juice after measuring 835 ml, store it in an airtight container in the fridge for up to a week. You can also freeze it in ice cube trays for future use. This way, you’ll always have lemon juice ready for your next air fryer creation.</p>  

<h2>Tips for Working With Lemon Juice</h2>  
<p>Freshly squeezed lemon juice offers the best flavour, but bottled works in a pinch. When converting 835 ml of lemon juice to cups, ensure you’re using the same type (fresh or bottled) for consistency. Acid levels can vary between brands.</p>  

<p>For cleaning your air fryer after cooking with lemon juice, check out our guide on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer maintenance</a>. The acidity helps break down grease, making it a natural cleaner too!</p>  

<h3>Alternative Measurements</h3>

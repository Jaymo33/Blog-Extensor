<p>3 cups of desiccated coconut equals approximately 12 ounces (340 grams). This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes, where precise measurements ensure perfect texture and consistency. Whether you're baking coconut macaroons or adding a crunchy topping to desserts, knowing the exact weight helps avoid mishaps.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on even heat distribution, so ingredient quantities must be spot-on. Too much desiccated coconut can lead to uneven cooking, while too little might leave your dish lacking flavour. For best results, use a kitchen scale to weigh 3 cups of desiccated coconut if you’re unsure. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more handy measurement tips.</p>  

<p>Many UK recipes use ounces, so converting cups to ounces ensures you follow instructions correctly. Desiccated coconut is lightweight, but its volume can vary slightly depending on how tightly it’s packed. If you’re making a recipe from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>our collection</a>, always double-check measurements for the best outcome.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure Desiccated Coconut Correctly</h3>  
<p>To measure 3 cups of desiccated coconut accurately, fluff it lightly with a fork before spooning it into a measuring cup. Avoid packing it down, as this can lead to an incorrect weight. For air fryer baking, consistency is key—whether you’re making coconut shrimp or a tropical dessert.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for Desiccated Coconut in Air Fryers</h2>  
<p>Desiccated coconut adds texture and flavour to many air fryer dishes. From coating chicken tenders to sprinkling over cakes, its versatility makes it a pantry staple. If you’re exploring new recipes, browse our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert category</a> for inspiration.</p>  

<p>For a quick treat, try mixing desiccated coconut with melted chocolate and air frying for crispy clusters. Since 3 cups equals 12 ounces, you can easily adjust quantities based on your needs. Don’t forget to clean your air fryer afterward—our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning guide</a> makes it simple!</p>  

<h3>Converting Other Coconut Measurements</h3>  
<p>If a recipe calls for shredded or fresh coconut instead, the weight will differ. Desiccated coconut is drier and more compact, so 3 cups of shredded coconut will weigh slightly more. Always check the recipe notes for specifics, especially when using an air fryer.</p>  

<h2>Tips for Storing Desiccated Coconut</h2>  
<p>To keep desiccated coconut fresh, store it in an airtight container in a cool, dry place. If you’ve measured out 3 cups (12 ounces) but don’t need it all, seal the remainder properly to avoid spoilage. Proper storage ensures your coconut stays ready for your next air fryer creation.</p>

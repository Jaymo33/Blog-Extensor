<p>15g of plain yogurt equals approximately 0.53 ounces. This conversion is handy when following air fryer recipes that require precise measurements. Whether you're whipping up a marinade or a healthy dip, knowing the exact weight ensures perfect results every time.</p>

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on precise ingredient ratios to deliver crispy, evenly cooked dishes. Using the right amount of yogurt, like 15g, can affect texture and moisture levels. Too much or too little can throw off your recipe, especially in baked goods or coatings. For more tips on perfecting your air fryer meals, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipes section</a>.</p>  

<p>Many UK recipes list yogurt in grams, but some kitchen scales display ounces. Converting 15g of plain yogurt to ounces (0.53 oz) ensures you never second-guess measurements. This is particularly useful for dishes like marinades or air-fryer cakes, where precision is key.</p>  

<h3>How to measure 15g of plain yogurt without scales</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have digital scales, use a tablespoon to approximate 15g of plain yogurt. One level tablespoon typically holds around 15g, but this can vary slightly with thickness. For more conversion hacks, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for 15g of plain yogurt in air fryer recipes</h2>  
<p>Plain yogurt is a versatile ingredient in air fryer cooking. A 15g portion works well in marinades for chicken or lamb, adding tenderness without overpowering flavours. It’s also ideal for binding coatings on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/potatoes>air-fryer potatoes</a> or creating light batters.</p>  

<p>In baking, 15g of yogurt can replace small amounts of butter or oil for healthier air-fryer cakes or muffins. Its acidity also helps activate baking soda, ensuring a good rise.

<h3>Storing leftover plain yogurt</h3>  
<p>After measuring out 15g, seal your yogurt container tightly and refrigerate. Proper storage keeps it fresh for future air fryer recipes. Always check for spoilage before use, especially if it’s been open for a while.</p>  

<h2>Converting other yogurt amounts to ounces</h2>  
<p>While 15g equals 0.53 ounces, you might need other conversions. For example, 30g is roughly 1.06 ounces, and 50g is about 1.76 ounces. Bookmark our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a> for quick reference during cooking.</p>  

<p>Remember that yogurt density can vary between brands. Greek yogurt is thicker than regular plain yogurt, so 15g may occupy slightly less volume. When precision matters, always weigh rather than rely on volume measures.</p>  

<h3>Cleaning your air fryer after yogurt-based recipes</h3>  
<p>Yogurt can leave sticky residues in your air fryer basket. After cooking, wipe surfaces with a damp cloth and use our recommended <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner</a> for tough buildup. Regular maintenance ensures optimal performance.</p>

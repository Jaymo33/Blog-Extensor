<p>289°F converts to Gas Mark 1.5, making it a moderate heat setting ideal for slow roasting or gentle baking in your air fryer. This temperature is perfect for dishes that require even, controlled cooking without browning too quickly.</p>

<h2>Understanding Gas Mark and Fahrenheit</h2>
<p>Gas Mark is a temperature scale used primarily in the UK for ovens and now commonly referenced for air fryers. Unlike Fahrenheit, which measures exact degrees, Gas Mark uses increments (e.g., Gas Mark 1, 2, etc.). 289°F sits between Gas Mark 1 and 2, hence the 1.5 designation. This precision helps when adapting traditional oven recipes for your air fryer.</p>
<p>Many air fryer users find conversions confusing, but tools like our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> simplify the process. Whether you're baking cakes or roasting vegetables, knowing your Gas Mark equivalents ensures consistent results.</p>

<h2>Why 289°F Matters in Air Frying</h2>
<p>289°F (Gas Mark 1.5) is a versatile temperature for delicate foods. It’s excellent for reheating without drying out or cooking items like custards that need gentle heat. Unlike higher temperatures that can crisp or brown too quickly, 289°F provides steady, even cooking.</p>
<p>For example, if you’re adapting a <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>cake recipe</a> from an oven to an air fryer, this temperature prevents the edges from burning while the centre cooks through. It’s also ideal for proofing dough or warming pre-cooked dishes.</p>

<h3>How to Adjust Cooking Times</h3>
<p>When using 289°F (Gas Mark 1.5) in an air fryer, reduce cooking times by 15-20% compared to oven recipes. Air fryers circulate heat more efficiently, so check food early to avoid overcooking. For frozen foods, refer to our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/frozen-foods>frozen foods guide</a> for tailored advice.</p>

<h2>Common Uses for 289°F in Air Fryers</h2>
<p>This temperature works wonders for slow-cooked meats, like pulled pork or lamb shoulder. It’s also great for dehydrating fruits or making jerky. The low heat ensures tenderness without sacrificing moisture.</p>
<p>For vegetarian options, try roasting tofu or mushrooms at 289°F (Gas Mark 1.5) to enhance flavours without crisping. Pair these with recipes from our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetables section</a> for balanced meals.</p>

<h3>Tips for Accuracy</h3>
<p>Always preheat your air fryer to 289°F (Gas Mark 1.5) for 3-5 minutes before adding food. Use an oven thermometer to verify your air fryer’s calibration, as some models run hotter or cooler. Keep the basket no more than halfway full for even air circulation.</p>

<h2>Converting Other Temperatures</h2>
<p>If you frequently switch between Fahrenheit and Gas Mark, bookmark our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> for quick references. For instance, 300°F is Gas Mark 2, while 275°F is Gas Mark 1. Small adjustments can make a big difference in outcomes.</p>
<p>Cleaning your air fryer after low-temperature cooking is easier too—check our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning guide</a> to maintain performance. Regular upkeep ensures your 289°F settings remain accurate over time.</p>

<p>20g of peanut butter equals approximately 0.71 ounces. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements can make or break your dish. Whether you’re whipping up peanut butter cookies or a savoury satay sauce, getting the weight right ensures consistency. For more handy conversions, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on even heat distribution, so ingredient quantities must be spot-on. Too much peanut butter can make dishes greasy, while too little might leave them dry. For recipes like peanut butter protein bars or glazes, 20g (0.71 oz) is a common starting point. If you’re meal prepping, consider our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> for balanced portions.</p>  

<p>Digital kitchen scales are the best way to measure 20g of peanut butter accurately. Scooping it straight from the jar with a spoon can lead to inconsistencies. For sticky ingredients like peanut butter, lightly oiling your measuring spoon helps release every gram. Need cleaning tips? Our guide on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer maintenance</a> keeps your appliance in top shape.</p>  

<h3>Common uses for 20g of peanut butter</h3>  
<p>This amount is perfect for single-serving desserts or marinades. Try it in air-fried banana rolls or as a glaze for tofu. Peanut butter’s richness means a little goes a long way—20g packs about 120 calories, so measure mindfully. Explore more <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert recipes</a> to put your peanut butter to work.</p>  

<h2>Converting grams to ounces: A handy reference</h2>  
<p>While 20g of peanut butter is 0.71 oz, other common conversions include 50g (1.76 oz) and 100g (3.53 oz). Bookmark our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a> for quick checks mid-recipe. Remember, UK fluid ounces differ slightly from US weights, so always double-check your source.</p>  

<p>For nut butters, density matters—creamy varieties weigh differently than crunchy ones. When substituting, stick to weight (grams or ounces) rather than volume (cups or tablespoons) for accuracy. This is especially crucial in air frying, where excess moisture can affect crispiness.</p>  

<h3>Tips for measuring sticky ingredients</h3>  
<p>To measure 20g of peanut butter cleanly, use the tare function on your scale. Place a small bowl on the scale, zero it out, then add peanut butter until you hit 20g. For no-mess prep, parchment liners catch drips—find our top picks in the <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/meal-prep>meal prep section</a>.</p>

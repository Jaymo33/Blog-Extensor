    "@type": "Answer",
    "text": "For most meats, 157 C (140 C fan) is too low for proper cooking. Poultry should reach at least 75 C internally, so higher temperatures are typically needed. However, this setting works well for finishing already-cooked meats or gentle reheating."

<p>157 C in a fan oven is equivalent to approximately 140 C in a conventional oven. This 20-degree reduction accounts for the efficient heat circulation in fan-assisted cooking. Whether you're using an air fryer or fan oven, understanding this conversion ensures perfectly cooked dishes every time.</p>

<h2>Why Fan Oven Temperatures Differ</h2>
<p>Fan ovens circulate hot air constantly, cooking food more evenly and quickly than conventional ovens. This means you typically need to reduce the temperature by about 20 degrees when converting recipes. The 157 C to fan oven conversion follows this standard principle, making it ideal for air fryers which work similarly to fan ovens.</p>
<p>At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we've tested this conversion across various models and found consistent results. Whether baking cakes or roasting vegetables, the 157 C fan oven setting delivers reliable outcomes. This temperature works particularly well for delicate items that might dry out at higher heats.</p>

<h2>Converting 157 C for Air Fryers</h2>
<p>Most air fryers function like compact fan ovens, making the 157 C conversion straightforward. If your recipe calls for 157 C in a conventional oven, set your air fryer to 140 C instead. This adjustment prevents overcooking while maintaining texture and moisture.</p>
<p>Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> shows how this applies to various cooking methods. For example, 157 C works beautifully for scones, muffins, and certain <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken dishes</a> when adjusted correctly. Always check food a few minutes early as air fryers cook faster than traditional ovens.</p>

<h3>Common Uses for 157 C Fan Setting</h3>
<p>The 157 C fan oven temperature excels for baked goods requiring gentle heat. Victoria sponges, shortbread, and cheesecakes all benefit from this setting. In air fryers, it's perfect for reheating pastries or cooking delicate fish fillets without drying them out.</p>

<h2>Temperature Accuracy Tips</h2>
<p>Not all ovens and air fryers maintain exact temperatures, so an oven thermometer is invaluable. When converting 157 C to fan oven settings, verify the actual heat with a standalone thermometer. This ensures your 140 C setting truly matches the intended cooking temperature.</p>
<p>For best results with this conversion, preheat your air fryer thoroughly. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we recommend preheating for 3-5 minutes when using the 157 C fan oven equivalent. This stabilises the cooking environment for consistent results.</p>

<h3>Troubleshooting 157 C Conversions</h3>
<p>If food cooks too quickly at 140 C in your air fryer, try reducing the time by 15-20%. Conversely, if items need more browning, increase temperature in 5-degree increments. The 157 C to fan oven conversion is a guideline that may need slight personalisation for your specific appliance.</p>

<h2>Recipes Using 157 C Fan Equivalent</h2>
<p>Many classic recipes work beautifully at this temperature when converted correctly. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a> includes several options adapted for 140 C air frying. From lemon drizzle cake to honey-glazed carrots, the 157 C fan oven principle creates excellent results.</p>
<p>When preparing frozen foods at this temperature, like those in our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/frozen-foods>frozen foods section</a>, remember to check packaging for conventional oven instructions first. Then apply the 157 C to fan oven conversion by reducing both temperature and cooking time appropriately.</p>

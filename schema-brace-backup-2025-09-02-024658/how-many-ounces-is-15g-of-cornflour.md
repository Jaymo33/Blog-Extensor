<p>15g of cornflour equals approximately 0.53 ounces. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precision matters, especially when baking or coating ingredients. Whether you're making crispy fried chicken or light, fluffy cakes, knowing how to convert grams to ounces ensures consistent results every time.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Using the correct amount of cornflour can make or break your air fryer dish. Too little, and your coating won’t crisp up properly. Too much, and your food might turn out dry or overly dense. For perfect results, always measure ingredients like cornflour accurately. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for quick reference.</p>  

<p>Cornflour is a staple in many air fryer recipes, from crispy coatings to thickening sauces. If you're experimenting with new dishes, like those in our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipes section</a>, precise measurements ensure your meals turn out as intended. A digital kitchen scale is a great investment for accuracy.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure 15g of Cornflour Without a Scale</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a scale, you can use measuring spoons to approximate 15g of cornflour. One tablespoon of cornflour is roughly 10g, so 1.5 tablespoons will give you close to 15g. However, for best results, especially in baking, a scale is recommended.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for Cornflour in Air Fryer Recipes</h2>  
<p>Cornflour is versatile in air fryer cooking. It’s often used to create a light, crispy coating for fried chicken, fish, or vegetables. It also helps thicken sauces and gravies, making it a must-have for many dishes. Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipes</a> for inspiration.</p>  

<p>Another great use for cornflour is in gluten-free baking. If you’re making air fryer cakes or cookies, cornflour can replace wheat flour for a lighter texture. Just remember to adjust measurements carefully, as seen in our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>cake recipes</a>.</p>  

<h3>Converting Other Common Measurements</h3>  
<p>If you frequently work with grams and ounces, it’s helpful to memorise a few key conversions. For example, 30g of cornflour is about 1.06 ounces, while 50g is roughly 1.76 ounces. Keep our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a> bookmarked for quick checks.</p>  

<h2>Tips for Storing Cornflour</h2>  
<p>To keep cornflour fresh, store it in an airtight container in a cool, dry place. Moisture can cause clumping, which affects measurement accuracy. If your cornflour has hardened, sift it before use to ensure smooth incorporation into your air fryer recipes.</p>  

<p>Proper storage also prevents spoilage, ensuring your cornflour lasts longer. For more kitchen organisation tips, check out our guide on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>keeping your air fryer clean</a> and efficient.</p>

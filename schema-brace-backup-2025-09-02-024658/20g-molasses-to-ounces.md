<p>20 grams of molasses equals approximately 0.71 ounces. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes, where precise measurements can make or break your dish. Whether you’re whipping up a sticky glaze or a rich dessert, knowing how to convert grams to ounces ensures consistency. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we’re all about making cooking easier, so let’s dive into the details.</p>  

<h2>Why Convert 20g of Molasses to Ounces?</h2>  
<p>Many UK recipes use grams, but if you’re working with a scale or recipe that lists ounces, this conversion is a lifesaver. Molasses, a thick, sweet syrup, is often used in air fryer recipes like glazes for meats or desserts. Getting the measurement right ensures your dish isn’t too sweet or too bland. For more air fryer conversions, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>  

<p>Molasses adds depth and richness to dishes, so accuracy matters. Whether you’re making gingerbread cookies or a marinade, 20g of molasses (0.71 oz) is a common measurement. If you’re unsure, always measure by weight rather than volume for the best results. Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipes</a> for inspiration on how to use molasses in your air fryer.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure 20g of Molasses Accurately</h3>  
<p>Using a digital kitchen scale is the easiest way to measure 20g of molasses. Simply tare your scale with the container on it, then pour the molasses until it hits 20g. If you don’t have a scale, 20g is roughly one tablespoon, but this can vary based on the molasses’ thickness. For sticky ingredients like molasses, lightly greasing your measuring spoon can help it slide off easily.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for 20g of Molasses in Air Fryer Recipes</h2>  
<p>Molasses is a versatile ingredient that works wonders in air fryer cooking. From glazes for chicken or salmon to sweet treats like sticky toffee pudding, 20g of molasses (0.71 oz) is often the perfect amount. Its rich, caramel-like flavour enhances both savoury and sweet dishes. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert recipes</a> for ideas on how to incorporate molasses.</p>  

<p>Another great use for molasses is in marinades. A mix of 20g molasses, soy sauce, and garlic makes a delicious glaze for air-fried meats. The sticky consistency helps the coating adhere, creating a caramelised finish. For cleaning sticky residues from your air fryer, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner guide</a> has you covered.</p>  

<h3>Tips for Working with Molasses in Your Air Fryer</h3>  
<p>Molasses can be messy, so always line your air fryer basket with parchment or a liner to avoid sticky cleanup. When using it in glazes, mix it with other liquids to prevent burning. For even distribution, brush the molasses mixture onto your food halfway through cooking. This ensures a perfect balance of flavour and texture.</p>

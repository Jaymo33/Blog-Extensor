Whether you're meal prepping or following a dish from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, knowing this conversion ensures your portions are spot-on.</p>

<h2>Why Convert 40g of Cooked Rice to Ounces?</h2>  
<p>Many UK recipes, especially those for air fryers, use grams, while others may reference ounces. Converting 40g of cooked rice to ounces (1.41 oz) helps you follow recipes accurately. This is particularly useful for dishes like air-fried rice cakes or stuffed peppers, where portion control matters. If you're using an air fryer, precise measurements can affect cooking times and results.

<h3>How to Measure 40g of Cooked Rice</h3>  
<p>Using a kitchen scale is the most accurate way to measure 40g of cooked rice. If you don’t have one, a rough estimate is about 2 heaped tablespoons. Remember, rice expands when cooked, so 40g of uncooked rice will yield much more. For air fryer recipes, precise measurements help avoid overcrowding the basket, which can lead to uneven cooking.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for 40g of Cooked Rice in Air Fryers</h2>  
<p>Portioning 40g of cooked rice (1.41 oz) is ideal for single-serving dishes like air-fried rice patties or stuffed vegetables. It’s also perfect for adding to <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable-based recipes</a> without overwhelming other ingredients. Air fryers excel at reheating rice, so knowing this conversion helps avoid waste when storing leftovers.</p>  

<p>Another great use for 40g of cooked rice is in air-fried sushi rolls or crispy rice snacks. The air fryer’s rapid circulation ensures even crisping without drying out the rice.

<h3>Tips for Cooking Rice in an Air Fryer</h3>  
<p>While air fryers aren’t typically used to cook rice from scratch, they’re brilliant for reheating or crisping cooked rice. Spread 40g (1.41 oz) evenly in the basket for best results. Lightly spraying with oil can enhance crispiness. Always preheat your air fryer for consistent outcomes, especially with smaller portions like 40g.</p>

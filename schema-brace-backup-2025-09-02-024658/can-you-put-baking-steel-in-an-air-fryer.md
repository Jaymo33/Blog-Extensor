<p>No, you should not put baking steel in an air fryer. Baking steel is designed for conventional ovens and can disrupt airflow, damage the basket, or even pose fire risks in compact air fryers. While some might experiment with thin steel plates, most manufacturers explicitly warn against it due to safety concerns and potential voiding of warranties.</p>  

<h2>Why Baking Steel and Air Fryers Don’t Mix</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on rapid hot air circulation to cook food evenly, and adding dense materials like baking steel blocks this essential airflow. The steel absorbs heat unevenly, creating hotspots that may burn food or strain the appliance’s heating element. Unlike oven-safe pans, baking steel’s weight can also warp or scratch non-stick air fryer baskets, as noted in many user manuals. For safer alternatives, check out <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>airfryer-friendly accessories</a> designed specifically for these appliances.</p>  

<p>Another issue is heat retention. Baking steel stays scorching hot long after cooking, making it hazardous to handle in a small air fryer compartment. Unlike ceramic or silicone liners, steel doesn’t cool quickly, increasing burn risks during removal. If you’re craving pizza crusts or seared meats, try preheating your air fryer with a perforated pan instead—it’s a trick shared in our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable roasting guide</a>.</p>  

<h3>Fire and Melting Risks</h3>  
<p>While baking steel won’t melt, its high thermal mass can cause the air fryer’s thermostat to overcompensate, triggering overheating errors or, in rare cases, smoking. Thin steel sheets might seem harmless, but they can reflect heat onto sensitive components. Always prioritise accessories labelled "air fryer-safe" to avoid mishaps.</p>  

<h2>Better Alternatives to Baking Steel</h2>  
<p>For crispy textures, perforated metal pans or pizza stones made for air fryers distribute heat without blocking airflow. Silicone mats with raised edges are another excellent choice, especially for reheating leftovers—find inspiration in our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a> for adapting oven recipes. Lightweight ceramic dishes also work well for dishes like frittatas or baked oats.</p>  

<p>If you’re determined to use metal, opt for an air fryer-compatible mesh tray. These are engineered to promote circulation while supporting heavier foods. Remember, proper cleaning matters too—steel residue can accumulate and affect performance, so explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning tips</a> to maintain your appliance.</p>  

<h3>Manufacturer Guidelines Matter</h3>  
<p>Most brands, including Ninja and Philips, prohibit third-party metal inserts unless certified. Violating these guidelines may void warranties or, worse, cause electrical faults. When in doubt, stick to the accessories that came with your unit or approved upgrades.</p>  

<h2>What If You’ve Already Tried It?</h2>  
<p>If you’ve used baking steel without issues, monitor for scratches or unusual noises during future cycles. Warped baskets won’t circulate air properly, leading to uneven cooking. For troubleshooting, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>homepage</a> has a wealth of resources to keep your air fryer in top shape.</p>  

<p>Accidentally damaged your air fryer? Avoid DIY fixes and consult the manufacturer. Steel-related mishaps often require professional repairs due to compromised non-stick coatings or heating elements. Prevention is always cheaper than replacement!</p>

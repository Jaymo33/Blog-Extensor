At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we’re all about making cooking easier, especially when it comes to measurements.</p>

<h2>Why converting 150g of milk to ounces matters</h2>  
<p>Accurate measurements are crucial in cooking, especially when using an air fryer. Too much or too little liquid can affect texture and cooking times. Converting 150g of milk to ounces (5.29 oz) helps you follow recipes precisely, whether you’re making a batter or a marinade. Many UK recipes use grams, while others use ounces, so knowing both is handy.

<p>Milk is a common ingredient in air fryer recipes, from pancakes to custards. Measuring 150g of milk correctly ensures your dishes turn out just right. If you’re using a kitchen scale, it’s easy to weigh milk in grams, but some measuring jugs only show ounces. That’s where this conversion comes in handy.

<h3>How to measure 150g of milk without a scale</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a scale, you can still measure 150g of milk using a measuring jug. Since 150g of milk is roughly 5.29 ounces, look for the fluid ounce markings on your jug. Keep in mind that milk’s density means it weighs slightly more than water, so avoid guessing. For best results, use a dedicated measuring tool or a conversion app. Need cleaning tips for your air fryer after cooking?

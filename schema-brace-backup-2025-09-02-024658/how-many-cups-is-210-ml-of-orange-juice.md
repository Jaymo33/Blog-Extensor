<p>210 ml of orange juice is approximately 0.89 cups. This conversion is essential for precise baking and cooking, especially when using an air fryer where measurements can make or break a dish. Whether you’re whipping up a citrusy glaze or a refreshing marinade, knowing how to convert millilitres to cups ensures consistency.

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter</h2>
<p>When working with recipes, especially in an air fryer, precision is key. Too much or too little liquid can affect texture, cooking time, and flavour. For example, 210 ml of orange juice might seem like a small amount, but in baking, it can determine whether your cake is moist or dry. Air fryers cook food quickly, so even slight deviations can lead to uneven results. Always measure liquids like orange juice carefully for the best outcome.</p>

<p>Using a standard measuring cup is the easiest way to ensure accuracy. If you don’t have one, a kitchen scale can help you weigh 210 grams of orange juice, which is roughly equivalent to 210 ml. For more tips on air fryer conversions, check out <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart</a>.</p>

<h2>Converting 210 ml of Orange Juice to Cups</h2>
<p>To convert 210 ml of orange juice to cups, you’ll need to know that 1 cup equals 236.59 ml. This means 210 ml is just under a full cup, specifically about 0.89 cups. If your recipe calls for a full cup, you might need to adjust other ingredients slightly to compensate. This is particularly important in air fryer recipes, where balance is crucial for even cooking.</p>

<p>For those who prefer imperial measurements, 210 ml of orange juice is also equivalent to 7.1 fluid ounces. If you’re scaling a recipe up or down, these conversions can save you from kitchen mishaps.

<h3>Common Uses for 210 ml of Orange Juice</h3>
<p>210 ml of orange juice is a versatile amount in cooking and baking. It’s perfect for glazes, marinades, or even adding a citrusy twist to cakes and muffins. In an air fryer, you might use it to baste chicken or drizzle over roasted vegetables. The acidity in orange juice can also help tenderise meats, making it a handy ingredient for meal prep.</p>

<h3>Measuring Without a Cup</h3>
<p>If you don’t have a measuring cup, you can use a tablespoon to measure 210 ml of orange juice. There are 15 ml in a tablespoon, so 210 ml would be 14 tablespoons. Alternatively, a kitchen scale set to grams can give you a precise measurement.

<h2>Adjusting Recipes for Air Fryers</h2>
<p>Air fryers cook differently than conventional ovens, so recipe adjustments are often needed. When using 210 ml of orange juice in an air fryer recipe, consider reducing other liquids slightly to account for faster evaporation. This ensures your dish doesn’t end up too soggy or dry. Always preheat your air fryer for even cooking, and check food halfway through to avoid overcooking.</p>

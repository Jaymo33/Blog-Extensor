<p>75g of plain yogurt equals approximately 2.65 ounces. This conversion is handy for air fryer recipes where precise measurements matter. Whether you're making dips, marinades, or baked goods, knowing the exact weight ensures perfect results every time. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we focus on making cooking simpler with accurate conversions and delicious recipes.</p>  

<h2>Why convert grams to ounces for yogurt?</h2>  
<p>Many UK recipes use grams, but some kitchen scales or international recipes might list ounces instead. Converting 75g of plain yogurt to ounces ensures you get the right consistency in dishes like air fryer cakes or creamy sauces. It’s especially useful when following American recipes or using older cookbooks. For more conversions, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>  

<p>Yogurt is a versatile ingredient in air fryer cooking, from tenderising meats to adding moisture to baked goods. Whether you're making a Greek yogurt marinade for chicken or a yogurt-based dip, knowing the exact measurement helps. A slight variation can affect texture, so accuracy matters. Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipes</a> for inspiration on using yogurt in your air fryer.</p>  

<h3>How to measure 75g of plain yogurt accurately</h3>  
<p>Using a digital kitchen scale is the easiest way to measure 75g of plain yogurt. Simply place your bowl on the scale, tare it to zero, and spoon in the yogurt until you hit 75g. If you don’t have scales, 75g is roughly 5 tablespoons, but weights can vary slightly depending on yogurt thickness. For best results, stick to weighing for precision.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for 75g of plain yogurt in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Plain yogurt works wonders in air fryer recipes, from marinades to baked goods. A 75g portion is perfect for coating chicken before air frying, ensuring juicy, flavourful results. It’s also great in batters for lighter, crispier textures. Try it in our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipes</a> for a tenderising boost.</p>  

<p>Yogurt can also replace heavier ingredients like cream or mayo in dips and dressings. A 75g serving blends beautifully with herbs and spices for a healthy dip. If you're meal prepping, yogurt-based sauces keep well and pair perfectly with air-fried veggies.

<h3>Does yogurt type affect the conversion?</h3>  
<p>Greek yogurt is thicker than regular plain yogurt, but 75g still equals roughly 2.65 ounces. However, the volume may differ slightly due to density. For recipes requiring precise consistency, stick to the type specified. If substituting, adjust liquids accordingly to maintain the right texture in your air fryer dishes.</p>

<h2>Common Uses for 0.33 Cup of Whipping Cream in Air Fryer Recipes</h2>

<h2>Tips for Working with Whipping Cream in Your Air Fryer</h2>  
<p>Whipping cream can behave differently in an air fryer due to the intense heat. To prevent curdling or separating, add it gradually and mix well. For best results, use chilled cream and avoid overmixing. These small adjustments ensure your dishes turn out perfectly every time.</p>

Converting 100g of breadcrumbs to ounces (3.53 oz) ensures you’re using the right amount for air fryer cooking. Too little, and your coating won’t crisp properly; too much, and you’ll waste ingredients.

<p>Air fryers excel at creating crispy textures, and breadcrumbs are a staple for achieving that golden finish.

<h3>How to Measure 100g of Breadcrumbs Accurately</h3>  
<p>For the best accuracy, use a digital kitchen scale set to grams. Scoop your breadcrumbs until the scale reads 100g, then note the equivalent in ounces (3.53 oz).

It’s enough to coat 4-6 chicken breasts or a batch of <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>air-fried vegetables</a>. You can also mix them with herbs and spices for homemade seasoning blends. Since air fryers circulate heat evenly, breadcrumbs brown beautifully without excess oil.</p>  

<p>For frozen foods like fish fingers or mozzarella sticks, 100g of breadcrumbs provides ample coverage. If you’re prepping ahead, store extra breadcrumbs in an airtight container.

<p>685 ml of maple syrup is approximately 2.9 cups in the US and 2.4 cups in the UK. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes and baking, where precise measurements matter. Whether you're whipping up a glaze or a sweet marinade, knowing how to convert ml to cups ensures your dish turns out perfectly every time.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter</h2>
<p>Using the right amount of maple syrup can make or break your recipe. Too much, and your dish could be overly sweet or sticky. Too little, and you might miss out on that rich, caramelised flavour. For air fryer recipes, precision is key to achieving even cooking and perfect texture. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more handy tips.</p>
<p>Maple syrup is a popular ingredient in both sweet and savoury dishes. From glazing salmon to sweetening desserts, it's versatile. But because it's thicker than water, its volume-to-weight ratio differs. That's why converting 685 ml of maple syrup to cups isn't as straightforward as other liquids.</p>

<h2>US vs. UK Cup Measurements</h2>
<p>In the US, 1 cup equals 240 ml, while in the UK, it's 284 ml. This means 685 ml of maple syrup converts to roughly 2.9 US cups or 2.4 UK cups. If you're following a recipe from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, always check which measurement system it uses to avoid mistakes.</p>
<p>For air fryer cooking, even small measurement discrepancies can affect results. A sticky glaze might not crisp up properly, or a marinade could be too runny. That's why we recommend using a measuring jug for liquids like maple syrup. Eyeballing it rarely works!</p>

<h3>Tips for Measuring Maple Syrup</h3>
<p>To measure 685 ml of maple syrup accurately, lightly grease your measuring cup or spoon first. This helps the syrup slide out easily, ensuring you get the full amount. For sticky ingredients like maple syrup, a silicone spatula is your best friend. Scrape every last drop for perfect results.</p>

<h2>Common Uses for 685 ml of Maple Syrup</h2>
<p>685 ml of maple syrup is enough for multiple batches of air fryer granola, glazed carrots, or even a maple-infused cake. It's also perfect for marinades, like the ones in our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipes</a>. The rich flavour pairs beautifully with spices and herbs.</p>
<p>If you're meal prepping, 685 ml of maple syrup can be portioned out for several recipes. Store any leftovers in an airtight container to maintain freshness. For more inspiration, browse our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert collection</a> featuring maple syrup as a star ingredient.</p>

<h3>Converting Other Maple Syrup Amounts</h3>
<p>Need to convert a different amount? The same principles apply. For example, 250 ml of maple syrup is roughly 1 US cup or 0.88 UK cups. Bookmark our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a> for quick reference next time you're cooking.</p>

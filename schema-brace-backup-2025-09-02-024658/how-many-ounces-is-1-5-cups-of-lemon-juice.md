<p>1.5 cups of lemon juice equals approximately 12 ounces. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements can make all the difference. Whether you're whipping up a citrusy marinade or a tangy dessert, knowing this conversion ensures your dish turns out perfectly every time.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>
<p>Using the right amount of lemon juice can significantly impact the flavour and texture of your air fryer dishes. Too little, and your recipe might lack zest; too much, and it could become overly acidic. Accurate measurements like 1.5 cups to ounces help maintain balance. For more tips on perfecting your air fryer recipes, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipes section</a>.</p>

<p>Lemon juice is a versatile ingredient in air fryer cooking, from marinades to glazes. Whether you're cooking chicken, fish, or vegetables, the right amount of lemon juice can elevate your dish. If you're unsure about other conversions, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> is a handy resource.</p>

<h3>How to Measure Lemon Juice Correctly</h3>
<p>To measure 1.5 cups of lemon juice accurately, use a liquid measuring cup. Fill it to the 1.5-cup mark, ensuring the juice is level with the measurement line. This method guarantees you get the correct 12-ounce quantity for your recipe. For sticky ingredients like lemon juice, a non-stick measuring cup can make the process easier.</p>

<h2>Common Uses for 1.5 Cups of Lemon Juice in Air Fryer Recipes</h2>
<p>1.5 cups of lemon juice (or 12 ounces) is often used in larger batches of marinades or sauces. For example, a citrus glaze for air fryer salmon or a tangy dressing for roasted vegetables might call for this amount. If you're exploring new dishes, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/fish>fish recipes</a> offer plenty of inspiration.</p>

<p>Lemon juice also works wonders in air fryer desserts, like lemon drizzle cakes or citrus-infused cookies. The acidity balances the sweetness, creating a delightful flavour profile.

<h3>Converting Other Lemon Juice Measurements</h3>
<p>If your recipe calls for a different amount of lemon juice, here are some quick conversions: 1 cup equals 8 ounces, and 2 cups equal 16 ounces. These conversions are useful when scaling recipes up or down.

<h2>Tips for Storing Leftover Lemon Juice</h2>
<p>If you have leftover lemon juice after measuring out 1.5 cups, store it in an airtight container in the fridge. It will stay fresh for up to a week, ready for your next air fryer adventure. For more storage and cleaning tips, check out our guide on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer maintenance</a>.</p>

<p>Freezing lemon juice in ice cube trays is another great option. Each cube holds about 1 ounce, making it easy to measure for future recipes. This method ensures you always have lemon juice on hand without waste.</p>

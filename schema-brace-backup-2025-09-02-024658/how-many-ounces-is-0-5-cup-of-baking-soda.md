<p>0.5 cup of baking soda equals approximately 4 ounces (113 grams). This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes, where precise measurements can affect texture and rise. Whether you're whipping up a batch of air-fried cookies or using baking soda to clean your appliance, knowing the exact weight ensures consistency.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on even heat distribution, and incorrect ingredient quantities can lead to uneven cooking. Baking soda, often used in batters or as a leavening agent, needs precise measurement to avoid overly dense or flat results. For example, too much baking soda in an air fryer cake can cause a bitter taste, while too little may prevent proper rising.</p>  
<p>At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we emphasise the importance of accurate conversions for perfect results. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> simplifies these calculations, so you never have to guess.</p>  

<h3>How to measure 0.5 cup of baking soda correctly</h3>  
<p>Use a dry measuring cup for baking soda, levelling it off with a straight edge for accuracy. Scooping directly from the container can compact the powder, leading to excess. For even greater precision, a kitchen scale set to ounces ensures you get exactly 4 ounces (0.5 cup) every time.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for baking soda in air fryers</h2>  
<p>Beyond baking, baking soda is a versatile ingredient for air fryer maintenance. A paste made from baking soda and water can help remove stubborn grease from the basket. Simply mix 0.5 cup (4 ounces) of baking soda with a few tablespoons of water, apply, and scrub gently.</p>  
<p>For more cleaning tips, check out our guide on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>how to clean your air fryer</a>. Baking soda is also great for deodorising—just sprinkle a little inside the appliance and wipe after use.</p>  

<h3>Converting other baking soda quantities</h3>  
<p>If your recipe calls for a different amount, here’s a quick reference: 1 cup of baking soda equals 8 ounces (227 grams), while ¼ cup is 2 ounces (57 grams). These conversions are handy for scaling recipes up or down, especially when adapting traditional oven recipes for your air fryer.</p>  

<h2>Baking soda in air fryer recipes</h2>  
<p>From crispy <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>air-fried chicken</a> to fluffy desserts, baking soda plays a key role. In batters, it helps create a light, airy texture, while in marinades, it tenderises meat. Always measure carefully—0.5 cup (4 ounces) is often the perfect amount for family-sized portions.</p>

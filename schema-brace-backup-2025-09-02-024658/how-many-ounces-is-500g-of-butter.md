<p>500g of butter equals approximately 17.64 ounces. Whether you're prepping ingredients for an air fryer recipe or baking, knowing this conversion ensures accuracy. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we understand how crucial precise measurements are for perfect results. Let’s dive deeper into butter conversions and how they apply to your cooking.</p>  

<h2>Why Convert 500g of Butter to Ounces?</h2>  
<p>Many UK recipes, especially those for air fryers, use grams, while some older cookbooks or international recipes rely on ounces. Converting 500g of butter to ounces (17.64 oz) helps maintain consistency. If you’re using an air fryer for baking, even small measurement errors can affect texture and rise. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more handy tips.</p>  

<p>Butter is a staple in dishes like air-fryer cakes or cookies, where precision matters. A 500g block is common in UK supermarkets, so knowing its ounce equivalent simplifies scaling recipes. For example, if a US recipe calls for 16 oz of butter, you’ll know 500g is slightly more—adjust accordingly!</p>  

<h3>How to Measure 500g of Butter Without Scales</h3>  
<p>No scales? No problem! A standard UK block of butter is 250g, so two blocks make 500g (or roughly 17.64 oz). Each tablespoon of butter is about 14g, so 500g equals roughly 36 tablespoons. This method is handy for quick <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> where precision isn’t critical.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for 500g of Butter in Air Fryers</h2>  
<p>From flaky pastries to golden cookies, 500g of butter (17.64 oz) goes a long way in air fryer cooking. It’s ideal for batch baking or meal prep—think buttery scones or crispy shortbread. Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>cake recipes</a> to put your 500g butter conversion to delicious use.</p>  

<p>Butter also enhances savory dishes, like air-fried garlic bread or herbed potatoes. Since air fryers circulate hot air, butter helps achieve a crisp exterior without excess oil. Just remember: 500g of butter is rich, so moderation is key for healthier results.</p>  

<h3>Storing 500g of Butter for Air Fryer Recipes</h3>  
<p>Keep your 500g butter block fresh by wrapping it tightly or using an airtight container. Room-temperature butter spreads easily, but for air fryer baking, chilled butter works better for flaky layers. Need to clean butter residue? Try our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner guide</a> for hassle-free maintenance.</p>

<p>835 ml of water equals approximately 3.52 cups in UK measurements or 3.53 cups in US measurements. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise liquid measurements can make or break your dish. Whether you're baking a cake or preparing a savoury meal, knowing how to convert millilitres to cups ensures consistency. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we help you nail every measurement for flawless cooking.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of liquid is crucial in air fryer recipes. Too much water can make dishes soggy, while too little may dry them out. For example, if a recipe calls for 835 ml of water, converting it correctly to cups ensures the texture and flavour are spot-on. Many air fryer recipes, like those in our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipes section</a>, rely on precise measurements for perfect results.</p>  

<p>Air fryers cook food quickly, so even small measurement errors can lead to overcooking or undercooking. Whether you're making a cake or a stew, knowing that 835 ml of water is roughly 3.5 cups helps maintain consistency. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for other handy measurement swaps.</p>  

<h3>UK vs. US Cup Measurements</h3>  
<p>In the UK, a standard cup holds 250 ml, while in the US, it's 240 ml. This means 835 ml of water converts to 3.52 UK cups or 3.53 US cups. The difference is minimal but worth noting for precision. If you're following a recipe from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert category</a>, double-check which measurement system it uses.</p>  

<h2>How to Measure 835 ml of Water Without a Measuring Cup</h2>  
<p>If you don’t have a measuring cup, you can use a kitchen scale. Since 1 ml of water weighs 1 gram, 835 ml equals 835 grams. Alternatively, use a standard mug (about 300 ml) and fill it just under three times for an approximate measure. For more tips, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning and care guide</a> to keep your tools accurate.</p>  

<p>Another method is using tablespoons—20 UK tablespoons (15 ml each) make 300 ml, so you’d need about 56 tablespoons for 835 ml. While not ideal for large quantities, it works in a pinch. Always level off your measurements for the best results in air fryer cooking.</p>

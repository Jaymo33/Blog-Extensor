<p>1.5 cups of passata equals approximately 12 ounces. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements can make or break your dish. Whether you’re making a rich tomato sauce or a hearty stew, knowing the exact weight ensures consistency. Passata, a smooth tomato purée, is a staple in many recipes, and getting the measurement right is key.

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on even cooking, and incorrect measurements can lead to uneven results. Too much passata might make your dish soggy, while too little could leave it dry. Measuring 1.5 cups of passata to ounces ensures you get the perfect consistency every time. This is especially important for recipes like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer pasta bakes</a> or stuffed peppers. Precision helps you replicate your favourite dishes with confidence.</p>  

<p>Passata is thicker than tomato juice but lighter than tomato paste, so its weight can vary slightly. However, 1.5 cups typically translates to 12 ounces, making it easy to scale recipes. If you’re using a UK measuring cup, the conversion remains the same.

<h3>How to measure passata correctly</h3>  
<p>Use a liquid measuring cup for passata, as it’s pourable but thicker than water. Fill the cup to the 1.5 mark without packing it down. If you’re using a kitchen scale, 12 ounces is your target. This method works for all tomato-based recipes, including <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>air fryer chicken dishes</a>. Keeping your measurements accurate ensures your meals turn out perfectly every time.</p>

<p>1.5 tablespoons (tbsp) of apple cider vinegar equals approximately 22.5 grams. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precision matters, especially when marinating or creating sauces. Whether you’re whipping up a tangy glaze for chicken or a dressing for roasted vegetables, knowing the exact weight ensures consistent results. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we focus on accurate measurements to help you master air fryer cooking.</p>

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>
<p>Air fryers rely on precise ingredient ratios to achieve the perfect texture and flavour. Too much or too little apple cider vinegar can throw off the balance of your recipe. For example, a marinade with 1.5 tbsp of apple cider vinegar (22.5g) helps tenderise meat while adding a subtle tang. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for other common ingredient conversions.</p>
<p>Many air fryer recipes, like crispy tofu or glazed salmon, call for small amounts of liquids like apple cider vinegar. Measuring by weight (grams) is often more reliable than volume (tablespoons), especially for sticky or dense ingredients. This precision ensures your dishes turn out perfectly every time, whether you’re following a recipe from our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipes</a> section or creating your own.</p>

<h2>How to measure 1.5 tbsp of apple cider vinegar accurately</h2>
<p>For the most accurate measurement, use a digital kitchen scale set to grams. Pour the apple cider vinegar directly into a bowl on the scale until it reaches 22.5g. If you don’t have a scale, use a standard UK tablespoon (15ml) and fill it 1.5 times. Remember, UK tablespoons differ slightly from US measurements, so always double-check.</p>
<p>Apple cider vinegar’s density can vary slightly depending on temperature and brand, but 1.5 tbsp generally weighs around 22.5 grams. This consistency makes it easy to adapt recipes for your air fryer. For more tips on perfecting your air fryer measurements, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipe category</a>, where precise marinades are key.</p>

<h3>Common uses for 1.5 tbsp of apple cider vinegar in air fryer recipes</h3>
<p>This quantity is perfect for small-batch recipes. Use it in glazes for air-fried wings, dressings for roasted vegetable salads, or marinades for tofu. The acidity helps tenderise proteins while adding brightness to dishes. Visit <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> for creative ways to incorporate this versatile ingredient.</p>

<h2>Converting other vinegar measurements to grams</h2>
<p>While we’ve focused on 1.5 tbsp of apple cider vinegar (22.5g), you might need to convert other amounts. One tablespoon equals about 15g, and 2 tbsp would be 30g. These conversions work for most types of vinegar in air fryer cooking. Keep our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner</a> guide handy – vinegar is great for cleaning your appliance too!</p>
<p>When adjusting recipe quantities, remember that vinegar’s strong flavour means small changes can make a big difference. Whether you’re making pickled vegetables or a honey-vinegar glaze, precise measurements ensure balanced results. For more inspiration, browse our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetables section</a> for vinegar-enhanced air fryer dishes.</p>

<h3>Tips for working with apple cider vinegar in air fryers</h3>
<p>Always dilute concentrated vinegar when using it in marinades or sprays. The 1.5 tbsp (22.5g) measurement works well when combined with oils or other liquids. This prevents the vinegar from being too harsh on your air fryer’s non-stick coating while still delivering great flavour to your food.</p>

<p>5 tablespoons of cooked rice is approximately 75 grams. This conversion is essential for precise air fryer cooking, ensuring your meals turn out perfectly every time. Whether you're meal prepping or following a recipe, knowing the exact weight helps maintain consistency.

<h2>Why Measure Cooked Rice in Grams?</h2>  
<p>Measuring cooked rice in grams provides accuracy, especially when using an air fryer. Volume measurements like tablespoons can vary based on how the rice is packed, but weight remains consistent. This is crucial for recipes where precise ratios matter, such as fried rice or rice-based bakes. If you're exploring new dishes, browse our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> for inspiration.</p>  

<p>Using grams also simplifies scaling recipes up or down. For example, if a recipe calls for 150 grams of cooked rice, you'll know that’s roughly 10 tablespoons. This precision is particularly useful for meal prepping or dietary tracking. Plus, it ensures even cooking in your air fryer, preventing under- or overdone results.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure 5 Tbsp of Cooked Rice</h3>  
<p>To measure 5 tablespoons of cooked rice, lightly spoon the rice into the tablespoon without packing it down. Level off the top with a knife for an accurate measurement. If you’re converting to grams, a kitchen scale is your best friend—simply tare the scale with your bowl and add rice until it hits 75 grams.

<h2>Common Uses for 5 Tbsp of Cooked Rice</h2>  
<p>Five tablespoons of cooked rice (75 grams) is a versatile portion for air fryer dishes. It’s perfect for single-serving fried rice, stuffed peppers, or rice cakes. You can also mix it with vegetables and protein for a quick, balanced meal. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/meal-prep>meal prep recipes</a> for ideas.</p>  

<p>This amount is also ideal for side dishes or adding bulk to soups and stews. Since air fryers cook quickly, pre-measured rice saves time and ensures even heating. Whether you're cooking for one or prepping lunches, 5 tbsp of cooked rice is a handy measurement to know.</p>  

<h3>Tips for Cooking Rice in an Air Fryer</h3>  
<p>For best results, use leftover or pre-cooked rice in your air fryer. Freshly cooked rice can be too moist, leading to uneven crisping. Spread the rice in a thin layer for even heating, and consider spraying it lightly with oil for extra crunch. Need to clean your air fryer afterward? Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning guide</a> has you covered.</p>

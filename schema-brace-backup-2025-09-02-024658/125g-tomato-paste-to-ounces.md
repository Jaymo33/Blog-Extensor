<p>125g of tomato paste equals approximately 4.41 ounces. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements can make or break a dish. Whether you're making a rich pasta sauce or a flavourful marinade, knowing how to convert grams to ounces ensures accuracy. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we understand the importance of getting measurements right for perfect results every time.</p>  

<h2>Why Convert 125g of Tomato Paste to Ounces?</h2>  
<p>Many UK recipes, especially those for air fryers, use metric measurements like grams. However, some kitchen scales or international recipes might list ingredients in ounces. Converting 125g of tomato paste to ounces (4.41 oz) helps you follow recipes without guesswork. This is particularly useful for dishes like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>air fryer chicken recipes</a>, where tomato paste is often used as a base for marinades.</p>  

<p>Tomato paste is a concentrated ingredient, so even small measurement errors can affect the taste. If you're using an air fryer, precise quantities ensure even cooking and balanced flavours. For more conversions, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> to simplify your cooking process.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure 125g of Tomato Paste Accurately</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a kitchen scale, you can use volume measurements. 125g of tomato paste is roughly 8 tablespoons or half a US cup. However, weighing it is more accurate, especially for air fryer recipes where consistency matters. A digital scale that switches between grams and ounces is a great investment for any home cook.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for 125g of Tomato Paste in Air Fryer Recipes</h2>  
<p>Tomato paste is a versatile ingredient that adds depth to many air fryer dishes. From <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>roasted vegetables</a> to meaty mains, 125g (or 4.41 oz) of tomato paste can elevate your cooking. It’s often used as a base for sauces, glazes, or even as a binder for breadcrumbs in crispy air fryer coatings.</p>  

<p>For example, a 125g portion of tomato paste can make enough marinade for 4-6 chicken breasts. Mix it with herbs, garlic, and a splash of oil for a flavour-packed dish. If you're looking for inspiration, browse our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> to find creative ways to use tomato paste.</p>  

<h3>Storing Leftover Tomato Paste</h3>  
<p>If you only need part of a 125g tin, transfer the rest to an airtight container and refrigerate. It will keep for up to a week, or you can freeze it in ice cube trays for longer storage. This way, you’ll always have the right amount on hand for your next air fryer creation.</p>

<h2>Why Convert 10g of Tomato Ketchup to Ounces?</h2>  
<p>Many UK air fryer recipes use metric measurements, but some cooks prefer imperial units like ounces.

<h3>How to Measure 10g of Tomato Ketchup Without a Scale</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a scale, 10g of tomato ketchup is roughly 2 teaspoons. However, this can vary slightly depending on the brand and thickness. For best results, use a measuring spoon and level it off for accuracy. This method works well for recipes like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>air fryer chicken tenders</a>, where ketchup is used as a glaze or dip.</p>

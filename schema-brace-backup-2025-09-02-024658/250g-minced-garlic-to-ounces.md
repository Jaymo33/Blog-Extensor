<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of minced garlic can make or break your dish. Too little, and the flavour falls flat; too much, and it overpowers.

<p>Garlic’s potency varies with its form—fresh, minced, or powdered—so weight conversions are crucial. A digital kitchen scale is your best friend here, but if you don’t have one, our conversion guide helps. For example, 250g minced garlic to ounces is roughly 8.82 oz, a handy figure to remember. This accuracy ensures your air fryer dishes turn out perfectly every time.</p>  

<h3>How to measure minced garlic without a scale</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a scale, you can use volume measurements as a rough guide. One tablespoon of minced garlic weighs about 10g, so 250g would be around 25 tablespoons. However, this method isn’t as precise as weighing, so use it sparingly. For best results, invest in a digital scale or bookmark our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a>.</p>

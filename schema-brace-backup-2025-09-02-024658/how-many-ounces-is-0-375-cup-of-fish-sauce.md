<p>0.375 cup of fish sauce equals approximately 3 ounces. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements can make or break a dish. Whether you’re marinating chicken or adding depth to a stir-fry, knowing the exact weight ensures consistency. Fish sauce, a staple in many Asian-inspired dishes, can be tricky to measure by volume due to its viscosity. That’s why converting cups to ounces is so helpful for accuracy.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on even cooking, and incorrect measurements can throw off the balance of flavours and textures. Too much fish sauce can overpower a dish, while too little might leave it bland. For recipes like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer salmon</a> or <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken wings</a>, precise amounts ensure perfect results every time. Using a kitchen scale for liquids like fish sauce eliminates guesswork. If you don’t have one, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a> can help.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure Fish Sauce Without a Scale</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a scale, use a liquid measuring cup for fish sauce. Fill it to the 0.375 cup mark, then pour into a spoon or small bowl to estimate ounces. Remember, 1 fluid ounce is roughly 2 tablespoons, so 3 ounces would be about 6 tablespoons. For sticky liquids like fish sauce, lightly greasing the measuring cup helps it slide out easily. Always level off the top for the most accurate measurement.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for Fish Sauce in Air Fryer Recipes</h2>  
<p>Fish sauce adds umami depth to marinades, glazes, and dipping sauces. Try it in <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/shrimp>air fryer shrimp</a> or as part of a glaze for crispy tofu. A little goes a long way, so sticking to 0.375 cup (3 ounces) ensures balanced flavour. For cleaning up after cooking, check out our tips on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>keeping your air fryer spotless</a>. Experiment with different brands, as some are saltier than others.</p>  

<h3>Converting Other Liquid Measurements for Air Fryer Recipes</h3>  
<p>Liquids like soy sauce, vinegar, and oils often need converting in air fryer recipes. For example, 0.375 cup of soy sauce also equals roughly 3 ounces. Always check if your recipe lists weights for better accuracy. If you’re scaling up a dish, use a calculator to adjust measurements proportionally. This avoids over-seasoning or diluting flavours. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> has more handy conversion guides for all your cooking needs.</p>

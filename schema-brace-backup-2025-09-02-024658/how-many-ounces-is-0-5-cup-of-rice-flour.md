<p>0.5 cup of rice flour equals approximately 2.5 ounces (70 grams) in UK measurements. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes, where precision ensures the best texture and consistency. Whether you're baking gluten-free treats or coating ingredients for crispy results, knowing the exact weight of 0.5 cup of rice flour makes all the difference.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on even heat distribution, and incorrect flour quantities can lead to uneven cooking or overly dense results. Rice flour, in particular, behaves differently than wheat flour, so measuring 0.5 cup correctly ensures your recipes turn out light and crispy. For more air fryer baking tips, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipes section</a>.</p>  

<p>Many UK cooks prefer weighing ingredients like rice flour for consistency. While 0.5 cup is a common measurement in American recipes, converting it to ounces (2.5 oz) aligns with British kitchen scales. This small adjustment can elevate your air fryer dishes from good to great.</p>  

<h3>How to measure 0.5 cup of rice flour accurately</h3>  
<p>For the most precise 0.5 cup rice flour to ounces conversion, use the spoon-and-level method. Gently spoon flour into a measuring cup without packing it down, then level off the excess with a straight edge. This prevents compacting, which could add up to 20% more flour by weight.</p>  

<h2>Rice flour in air fryer recipes: Pro tips</h2>  
<p>Rice flour’s fine texture makes it ideal for air fryer coatings and batters. When converting 0.5 cup to ounces (2.5 oz), consider that rice flour absorbs less liquid than wheat flour. Adjust liquids slightly in recipes like tempura or onion bhajis for the perfect crispiness.</p>  

<p>For gluten-free air fryer baking, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a> helps adapt traditional recipes. Remember that 0.5 cup of rice flour equals 2.5 ounces, but other gluten-free flours may differ in weight. Always check specific conversions for alternative flours.</p>  

<h3>Common uses for 0.5 cup of rice flour</h3>  
<p>This quantity (2.5 oz) perfectly coats 2-3 chicken breasts for air frying or makes batter for a batch of vegetable fritters. Rice flour’s high smoke point makes it excellent for air fryer cooking, creating golden results without burning.</p>  

<h2>Converting between cups and ounces</h2>  
<p>While 0.5 cup of rice flour equals 2.5 ounces, note that cup-to-ounce conversions vary by ingredient. Always use a dedicated conversion tool like our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for different flours and ingredients.</p>  

<p>For cleaning rice flour residue from your air fryer, visit our guide on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>maintaining your appliance</a>. Rice flour can leave fine dust that requires proper cleaning to prevent smoke during future use.</p>  

<h3>Storing rice flour for air fryer recipes</h3>  
<p>After measuring out your 0.5 cup (2.5 oz) portions, store rice flour in an airtight container in a cool, dark place. Proper storage maintains freshness for up to 6 months, ensuring your air fryer recipes taste their best.</p>

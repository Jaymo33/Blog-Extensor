<p>5 tablespoons of tahini equals approximately 75 grams. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precision matters, ensuring your dishes turn out just right. Whether you're making hummus, dressings, or baking, knowing the exact weight helps avoid guesswork.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate tahini measurements matter</h2>  
<p>Using the correct amount of tahini ensures your recipes have the right consistency and flavour. Too much can make dishes overly thick, while too little might leave them lacking richness. For air fryer recipes, precise measurements help achieve even cooking and perfect textures.

<p>Tahini, a staple in Middle Eastern cuisine, is packed with nutrients like healthy fats and protein. Measuring it correctly ensures you get the nutritional benefits without overdoing it. Whether you're meal prepping or whipping up a quick snack, accuracy is key. Visit <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> for more tips on perfecting your air fryer meals.</p>  

<h3>How to measure tahini properly</h3>  
<p>To measure tahini accurately, use a flat-edged utensil to level off the tablespoon. Stirring the tahini first ensures a consistent texture, as it tends to separate. For sticky ingredients like tahini, lightly greasing the spoon can help it slide off easily. This method ensures you get exactly 15 grams per tablespoon, totalling 75 grams for 5 tbsp.</p>  

<h2>Converting tahini for different recipes</h2>  
<p>Many recipes, especially those for air fryers, list ingredients by weight for precision. Converting 5 tbsp of tahini to grams (75g) simplifies scaling recipes up or down.

<h3>Common mistakes when measuring tahini</h3>  
<p>One mistake is not stirring tahini before measuring, leading to inconsistent amounts. Another is packing it into the spoon, which can add extra grams unintentionally. For best results, always use a kitchen scale when possible, especially for air fryer recipes where precision affects cooking time and texture.</p>  

<h2>Using tahini in air fryer recipes</h2>  
<p>Tahini adds richness to marinades, sauces, and even baked goods in the air fryer.

<p>1.33 cups of cooked rice equals approximately 10.6 ounces (or 300 grams) when measured by weight. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes, ensuring accurate portions and consistent results. Whether you’re meal prepping or adjusting serving sizes, knowing the weight of cooked rice helps streamline cooking. For more air fryer conversions, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>  

<h2>Why Convert Cups to Ounces for Cooked Rice?</h2>  
<p>Measuring rice by weight (ounces) rather than volume (cups) ensures precision, especially in air fryer cooking. Rice density can vary based on grain type and cooking method, making weight a more reliable metric. For example, 1.33 cups of fluffy jasmine rice may weigh slightly less than sticky sushi rice. If you’re preparing <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/meal-prep>meal prep recipes</a>, weighing ingredients avoids guesswork and guarantees consistency.</p>  

<p>Air fryers excel at reheating rice, but portion control is key to avoiding dry or uneven results. A 10.6-ounce portion fits perfectly in most air fryer baskets, crisping up without overcrowding. For best results, spread the rice evenly and lightly spray with oil. Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer rice recipes</a> for creative ways to use leftover rice.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure 1.33 Cups of Cooked Rice Accurately</h3>  
<p>Use a kitchen scale for the most accurate conversion of 1.33 cups to ounces. Fluff the rice with a fork before lightly spooning it into a measuring cup—avoid packing it down. If you don’t have a scale, remember that 1 cup of cooked rice typically weighs 8 ounces, so 1.33 cups is roughly 10.6 ounces. This method works for basmati, brown, or white rice in <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>air fryer recipes</a>.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for 1.33 Cups of Cooked Rice</h2>  
<p>This portion size is ideal for single-serving air fryer dishes like crispy rice cakes or stuffed peppers. It’s also a great base for <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable-packed stir-fries</a>, ensuring balanced meals without leftovers. Since air fryers cook quickly, pre-measuring rice saves time and reduces food waste. For cleaning tips after cooking sticky rice, visit our guide on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer maintenance</a>.</p>  

<p>When reheating, 10.6 ounces of rice fits neatly in a single layer, allowing hot air to circulate evenly. Add a sprinkle of water to revive dryness, and air fry at 350°F for 3–5 minutes. This method works for fried rice, pilafs, or even rice pudding—just adjust timing based on your air fryer model.</p>  

<h3>Adjusting Recipes for Different Rice Types</h3>  
<p>Brown rice weighs slightly more than white rice due to its denser texture. If substituting, note that 1.33 cups of brown rice may be closer to 11 ounces. Always check your recipe’s requirements, especially for dishes like sushi or risotto where texture matters.

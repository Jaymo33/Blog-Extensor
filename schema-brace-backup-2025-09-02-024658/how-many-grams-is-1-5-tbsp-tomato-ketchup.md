<p>1.5 tablespoons of tomato ketchup weighs approximately 22.5 grams. This conversion is essential for precise cooking, especially when using an air fryer where measurements can impact texture and flavour. Whether you’re following a recipe from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> or creating your own, knowing exact weights ensures consistent results.</p>

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>
<p>Air fryers rely on hot air circulation to cook food evenly, so ingredient quantities can affect cooking times and outcomes. Too much or too little tomato ketchup in a marinade or glaze could lead to uneven browning or overly sticky results. For perfect air-fried dishes like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>glazed chicken wings</a>, precise gram measurements make all the difference.</p>
<p>Many air fryer recipes from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken dishes</a> to vegetable sides use tomato ketchup as a key ingredient. The 1.5 tbsp to grams conversion (22.5g) helps maintain recipe integrity whether you’re making sauces, glazes, or dips. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a> includes other common measurements for easy reference.</p>

<h3>How to measure 1.5 tbsp tomato ketchup accurately</h3>
<p>For the most precise 1.5 tablespoon measurement, use proper measuring spoons rather than estimating. Level off the ketchup with a straight edge for consistency. If your recipe calls for grams instead, 22.5g of tomato ketchup equals exactly 1.5 UK tablespoons.</p>

<h2>Common uses for 1.5 tbsp tomato ketchup in air fryer recipes</h2>
<p>This quantity frequently appears in recipes for single servings or small batches. You might use 1.5 tbsp (22.5g) of tomato ketchup when making a quick glaze for <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>roasted vegetables</a> or as part of a marinade for smaller cuts of meat. The tangy sweetness enhances flavour without overwhelming other ingredients.</p>
<p>When preparing <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/frozen-foods>frozen snacks</a> in your air fryer, 1.5 tbsp of tomato ketchup makes an ideal dipping portion. Remember to clean your air fryer basket with <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>proper cleaner</a> after using sticky ingredients like ketchup to maintain performance.</p>

<h3>Converting other ketchup measurements to grams</h3>

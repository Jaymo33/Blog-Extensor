<p>1.5 cups of milk is equivalent to 355 millilitres (ml). This conversion is essential for precise baking and cooking, especially when using an air fryer where measurements can make or break a dish. Whether you’re whipping up a cake or a creamy sauce, knowing how many ml is 1.5 cups of milk ensures consistency and delicious results.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on precise ingredient ratios to achieve the perfect texture and flavour. Using the correct amount of milk—355 ml for 1.5 cups—ensures your recipes turn out as intended. Too much or too little liquid can affect cooking times and results, leading to soggy or dry dishes. For more air fryer tips, visit <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>our conversion chart</a>.</p>  

<p>Many air fryer recipes, like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>cakes</a> or <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>desserts</a>, call for milk. Measuring 1.5 cups of milk in ml (355 ml) guarantees accuracy, whether you’re following a UK or US recipe. This small detail can elevate your cooking from good to great.</p>  

<h2>How to Measure 1.5 Cups of Milk in ml</h2>  
<p>To measure 1.5 cups of milk in millilitres, use a liquid measuring jug with ml markings. Fill it to the 355 ml line for perfect accuracy. If you don’t have a jug, remember that 1 cup equals 237 ml, so 1.5 cups is 355 ml (237 ml + 118 ml).</p>  

<h3>Using Metric vs. Imperial Measurements</h3>  
<p>In the UK, metric measurements like millilitres are standard, while the US often uses cups. Converting 1.5 cups of milk to ml (355 ml) bridges this gap, making recipes accessible no matter where they originate. For more measurement tips, explore <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>our recipe collection</a>.</p>  

<h2>Common Recipes Using 1.5 Cups of Milk</h2>  
<p>Many air fryer recipes require 1.5 cups of milk (355 ml), such as pancakes, custards, or creamy pasta sauces. Accurate measurements ensure the right consistency and flavour. For example, a <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/breakfast>breakfast</a> pancake batter with 355 ml of milk will be light and fluffy.</p>  

<p>If you’re making a savoury dish like a cheese sauce, 355 ml of milk (1.5 cups) creates the perfect base. Too little milk makes it thick and clumpy, while too much dilutes the flavour. Precision is key for air fryer success.</p>  

<h2>Tips for Measuring Milk in an Air Fryer Recipe</h2>  
<p>Always use room-temperature milk for accurate measurements, as cold milk can slightly contract. Stir the milk before measuring to ensure uniformity. For sticky ingredients, lightly grease your measuring cup to prevent residue.</p>

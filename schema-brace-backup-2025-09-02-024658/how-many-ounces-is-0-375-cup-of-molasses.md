<p>0.375 cup of molasses equals 3 ounces, making it easy to measure for your air fryer recipes. Whether you’re baking gingerbread cookies or glazing a ham, precise measurements ensure consistent results. Molasses, a thick, sticky sweetener, can be tricky to measure, but knowing this conversion simplifies the process. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we’re all about helping you nail every recipe with accurate conversions.</p>

<h2>Why accurate molasses measurements matter</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of molasses is crucial for balancing sweetness and texture in your dishes. Too much can overpower other flavours, while too little might leave your recipe lacking depth. For air fryer recipes, precise measurements ensure even cooking and perfect browning. Molasses also adds moisture, so getting the amount right prevents dry or soggy outcomes. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for other handy measurement tips.</p>  

<p>Molasses is denser than many liquids, so volume-to-weight conversions like 0.375 cup to ounces are especially helpful. This is why weighing ingredients like molasses can be more reliable than using cups. If you’re adapting a traditional recipe for the air fryer, converting measurements ensures success. For more recipe ideas, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> collection.</p>  

<h3>How to measure molasses accurately</h3>  
<p>To measure 0.375 cup (3 ounces) of molasses, use a liquid measuring cup with clear markings. Lightly grease the cup or spoon first to help the molasses slide out easily. For sticky ingredients like molasses, a kitchen scale is even better—simply weigh out 3 ounces. This method eliminates guesswork and ensures precision, especially for air fryer baking.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for 0.375 cup of molasses</h2>  
<p>This measurement is perfect for small-batch air fryer recipes, like 6–8 gingerbread cookies or a glaze for roasted vegetables. Molasses adds rich, caramelised notes to marinades, baked beans, and even barbecue sauces. It’s also a key ingredient in steamed puddings and some <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert recipes</a>. Knowing that 0.375 cup equals 3 ounces helps you scale recipes up or down with confidence.</p>  

<p>For savoury dishes, 0.375 cup of molasses can enhance the flavour of pulled pork or baked salmon. Its natural sweetness balances spices in rubs and marinades, making it versatile for both sweet and savoury air fryer dishes. If you’re experimenting with new recipes, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner</a> guide ensures your appliance stays in top condition.</p>  

<h3>Tips for working with molasses</h3>  
<p>Store molasses in a cool, dark place to prevent crystallisation. If it thickens over time, gently warm the jar in hot water to loosen it. For easy pouring, wipe the rim of the jar after each use to avoid sticky buildup. These small steps make measuring 0.375 cup (3 ounces) of molasses hassle-free.</p>

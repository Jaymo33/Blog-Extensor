<p>2.5 tbsp of baking soda equals approximately 37 grams. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes, where precise measurements ensure perfect texture and rise. Whether you're baking cakes, cookies, or even savoury dishes, knowing how to convert tablespoons to grams guarantees consistency. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we emphasise accuracy to help you achieve the best results with your air fryer.</p>

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer baking</h2>  
<p>Baking soda is a leavening agent, and even small measurement errors can affect your air fryer recipes. Too much can leave a bitter taste, while too little may result in dense, flat bakes. Using 37 grams (2.5 tbsp) ensures the right chemical reaction for fluffy cakes or crispy coatings. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> simplifies these calculations for all your cooking needs.</p>  
<p>Air fryers circulate hot air rapidly, so balanced ingredients are crucial. Unlike traditional ovens, uneven measurements can lead to inconsistent cooking. For example, a slight excess of baking soda might cause over-browning in your air fryer cookies. Stick to 37 grams for reliability, and explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> for foolproof ideas.</p>  

<h2>How to measure 2.5 tbsp of baking soda correctly</h2>  
<p>For accuracy, use a flat-edged utensil to level off your tablespoons. Scooping directly from the container can pack the powder, leading to more than 37 grams. If you’re scaling a recipe up or down, remember that 1 tbsp of baking soda equals roughly 14.8 grams. A kitchen scale eliminates guesswork—especially useful for air fryer baking, where precision impacts texture.</p>  
<p>Pre-measuring ingredients saves time and avoids mid-recipe adjustments. Store baking soda in an airtight container to prevent clumping, which can throw off your 2.5 tbsp measurement. Need more tips? Our guide on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>keeping your air fryer clean</a> ensures no residue affects future measurements.</p>  

<h3>Common air fryer recipes using 2.5 tbsp baking soda</h3>  
<p>This quantity often appears in larger batches, like air fryer cakes or savoury breadings. For example, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>air fryer cake recipes</a> might use 2.5 tbsp (37 grams) for a light, fluffy crumb. It’s also handy for homemade cleaning solutions to maintain your appliance—efficiency in and out of cooking!</p>  

<h3>UK vs. US tablespoon measurements</h3>  
<p>In the UK, 1 tbsp holds 15 ml, the same as the US, so 2.5 tbsp translates uniformly to 37 grams. However, always check your recipe’s origin, as some older UK references might differ slightly. When in doubt, weigh it out—your air fryer will thank you for the precision.</p>

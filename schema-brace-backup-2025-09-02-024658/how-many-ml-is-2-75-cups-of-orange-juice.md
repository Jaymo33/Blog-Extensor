<p>2.75 cups of orange juice equals approximately 651 ml. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precision matters. Whether you’re making a glaze, marinade, or sauce, knowing the exact millilitre measurement ensures consistent results. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we focus on helping you get the most out of your air fryer with accurate conversions.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of liquid, like orange juice, can make or break your air fryer dish. Too much liquid can lead to soggy results, while too little might dry out your food. For example, a marinade with 2.75 cups of orange juice (651 ml) should coat your chicken or vegetables perfectly.

<p>Precision is especially important when baking in the air fryer. Cakes and desserts often rely on exact liquid ratios for the right texture.

<h3>How to Measure 2.75 Cups of Orange Juice Correctly</h3>  
<p>To measure 2.75 cups of orange juice accurately, use a liquid measuring cup with clear markings. Fill it to the 2.75-cup line, or measure 651 ml directly if your cup has metric units. Avoid using dry measuring cups, as they won’t give you the same precision. For sticky liquids like orange juice, a quick spray of <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner</a> on your measuring tools makes cleanup easier.</p>

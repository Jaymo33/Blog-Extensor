<p>960 ml of double cream is roughly equivalent to 4 cups in UK measurements or just over 4 cups in US measurements. This conversion is essential for anyone using an air fryer to whip up creamy desserts, sauces, or indulgent dishes. Whether you’re following a recipe from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> or improvising, getting the measurement right ensures perfect results every time.</p>  

<h2>Understanding Double Cream Measurements</h2>  
<p>Double cream is a staple in many British recipes, from rich desserts to savoury sauces. When converting 960 ml of double cream to cups, it’s important to note that UK and US cup sizes differ slightly. In the UK, 1 cup equals 250 ml, making 960 ml approximately 3.84 cups. However, in the US, 1 cup is 240 ml, so 960 ml works out to exactly 4 cups.</p>  

<p>For air fryer recipes, precision matters. Whether you’re making a creamy pasta bake or a luscious custard, knowing how much double cream to use ensures the right consistency. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more handy measurement guides.</p>  

<h3>Why Accurate Measurements Matter</h3>  
<p>Using the correct amount of double cream can make or break a dish. Too little, and your sauce might be too thin; too much, and it could become overly rich. This is especially crucial for air fryer cooking, where ingredients need to be balanced for even cooking. If you’re experimenting with a new recipe, always measure carefully.</p>  

<h2>Converting 960 ml of Double Cream for Baking</h2>  
<p>Baking with double cream requires precision. Whether you’re making scones, cakes, or mousses, 960 ml of double cream translates to 4 cups in the US or just under 4 cups in the UK. For best results, use a measuring jug with clear ml and cup markings to avoid guesswork.</p>  

<p>Many of the dessert recipes on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> call for double cream, so having this conversion handy will save time. If you’re scaling a recipe up or down, remember that 1 cup (UK) is 250 ml, while 1 cup (US) is 240 ml.</p>  

<h3>Tips for Measuring Double Cream</h3>  
<p>For the most accurate measurement, pour the double cream into a liquid measuring cup at eye level. If you don’t have one, a standard kitchen scale can also work—960 ml of double cream weighs roughly 960 grams due to its density. Avoid using dry measuring cups, as they can lead to inconsistencies.</p>  

<h2>Using 960 ml of Double Cream in Air Fryer Recipes</h2>  
<p>Air fryers are fantastic for creating creamy dishes without excess oil. From rich carbonara to indulgent bread pudding, 960 ml of double cream (or 4 cups) is a common quantity. If you’re adapting a traditional recipe for the air fryer, this conversion ensures you won’t over or under-measure.</p>

<h3>Common Mistakes to Avoid</h3>

If you’re unsure, refer back to our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a> for clarity.</p>

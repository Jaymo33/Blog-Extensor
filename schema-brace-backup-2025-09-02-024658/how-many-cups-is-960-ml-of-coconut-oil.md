<p>960 ml of coconut oil equals approximately 4 cups in both UK and US measurements. This conversion is essential for baking, frying, or air frying, ensuring your recipes turn out perfectly every time. Whether you're whipping up a batch of cookies or crisping chicken in your air fryer, accurate measurements matter. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we make conversions straightforward so you can focus on cooking. Let’s dive deeper into how this measurement works and why it’s useful for air fryer recipes.</p>  

<h2>Understanding Coconut Oil Measurements</h2>  
<p>Coconut oil is a staple in many kitchens, especially for air frying, as it adds a delicious flavour and crisp texture. Measuring it correctly ensures your dishes aren’t too oily or dry. While millilitres (ml) are a metric measurement, cups are more common in recipes, particularly in the US and UK. For 960 ml of coconut oil, the conversion is straightforward: it’s roughly 4 cups. This applies whether you’re using solid or melted coconut oil, though the method of measuring may vary slightly.</p>  

<p>If you’re using an air fryer, precise measurements help avoid excess oil, which can lead to soggy results. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for other common ingredient conversions. Whether you’re making crispy potatoes or a moist cake, knowing how much coconut oil to use is key. For more recipe ideas, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a> tailored for air fryers.</p>  

<h3>Why Accuracy Matters in Air Frying</h3>  
<p>Air fryers rely on even heat distribution, and too much oil can disrupt this balance. Using the correct amount of coconut oil ensures your food cooks evenly and crisps up nicely. Whether you’re converting 960 ml of coconut oil for a marinade or a batter, precision helps avoid wasted ingredients and disappointing results. For cleaning tips after cooking with oils, visit our guide on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer maintenance</a>.</p>  

<h2>UK vs. US Cup Measurements</h2>  
<p>While 960 ml of coconut oil converts to 4 cups in both the UK and US, it’s worth noting that cup sizes can vary slightly. A UK cup is 250 ml, while a US cup is 240 ml. However, for coconut oil, the difference is negligible in most recipes. If you’re following a strict baking recipe, though, it’s best to stick to one measurement system for consistency.</p>  

<p>For air fryer recipes, such as those in our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert category</a>, small measurement differences rarely affect the outcome. However, if you’re scaling up a recipe, double-check your conversions to avoid mishaps. Whether you’re making coconut shrimp or a vegan cake, 960 ml of coconut oil will give you the perfect amount for 4 cups.</p>  

<h3>Tips for Measuring Coconut Oil</h3>  
<p>If your coconut oil is solid, pack it firmly into a measuring cup for accuracy. For melted oil, pour it into a liquid measuring cup at eye level. Remember, 960 ml of coconut oil is versatile—use it for frying, baking, or even as a butter substitute in air fryer recipes.

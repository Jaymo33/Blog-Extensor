This precision is especially important in baking and air fryer cooking where exact ratios affect the final product's texture and rise.

<p>1.33 cups of butter equals approximately 10.64 ounces. This conversion is essential for precise baking and cooking, especially when using an air fryer where measurements matter. Whether you're whipping up a cake or preparing a savoury dish, knowing how to convert cups to ounces ensures your recipes turn out perfectly every time.</p>

<h2>Why accurate butter measurements matter</h2>
<p>Accurate measurements are crucial in baking and cooking, as even small deviations can affect texture and taste. Butter, in particular, plays a key role in recipes, providing moisture, richness, and structure. When using an air fryer, precise measurements help achieve consistent results, whether you're making cookies or roasting vegetables. For more tips on conversions, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>

<p>Many UK recipes use ounces or grams, while others rely on cups. Understanding how to convert between these units ensures you can follow any recipe without confusion. This is especially handy if you're adapting a family favourite or trying out a new dish from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>our recipe collection</a>.</p>

<h2>How to measure 1.33 cups of butter</h2>
<p>Measuring butter can be tricky, especially when dealing with fractions of a cup. Here's a simple method: one standard cup of butter equals 8 ounces, so 1.33 cups would be 10.64 ounces. If you're using blocks of butter, most UK brands have markings on the wrapper to help you measure the correct amount.</p>

<h3>Using a kitchen scale</h3>
<p>For the most accurate results, use a digital kitchen scale. Place your bowl on the scale, tare it to zero, then add butter until you reach 10.64 ounces. This method eliminates any guesswork and ensures perfect measurements every time, whether you're baking or preparing an air fryer meal.</p>

<h2>Common butter conversions for air fryer recipes</h2>
<p>When adapting recipes for your air fryer, you might need to convert various butter measurements. Here are some common equivalents to keep handy:</p>
<ul>
<li>1 cup butter = 8 ounces</li>
<li>½ cup butter = 4 ounces</li>
<li>¼ cup butter = 2 ounces</li>
<li>1 tablespoon butter = 0.5 ounces</li>
</ul>

<p>These conversions are particularly useful when preparing <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>air fryer cakes</a> or other baked goods where precision is key. Remember, air fryers cook food faster than conventional ovens, so accurate measurements help prevent overcooking or undercooking.</p>

<h3>Butter alternatives in air fryer cooking</h3>
<p>If you're looking for healthier options, you can substitute butter with alternatives like olive oil or coconut oil in many air fryer recipes. However, keep in mind that these substitutes may change the texture and flavour of your dish. Always check conversion rates when substituting, as oils have different densities than butter.</p>

<h2>Tips for working with butter in air fryer recipes</h2>
<p>Butter can enhance the flavour and texture of many air fryer dishes, from roasted vegetables to crispy chicken. Here are some expert tips for best results:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use cold butter for pastry recipes to create flaky layers</li>
<li>Melt butter evenly before brushing it on foods for even browning</li>
<li>Combine butter with herbs or spices for extra flavour</li>
<li>Clean your air fryer basket promptly after cooking with butter to prevent buildup</li>
</ul>

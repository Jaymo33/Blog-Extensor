<p>0.33 cup of crushed garlic equals approximately 2.64 ounces. This measurement is essential for air fryer recipes where precise quantities can make or break a dish. Whether you’re preparing a garlic-infused marinade or seasoning vegetables, knowing the exact weight ensures consistency. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we help you nail these conversions for perfect meals every time.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate garlic measurements matter</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of crushed garlic is crucial for balancing flavours in your air fryer dishes. Too little, and your meal might lack depth; too much, and it can overpower other ingredients. For example, 0.33 cup of crushed garlic (2.64 ounces) works perfectly in recipes like garlic butter shrimp or roasted vegetables. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>garlic-heavy recipes</a> for inspiration.</p>  

<p>Garlic’s potency varies depending on how it’s prepared—crushed, minced, or chopped. Crushed garlic releases more oils, making it stronger in flavour. This is why measuring by weight (ounces) is often more reliable than volume (cups). If you’re unsure, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a> can help you switch between units effortlessly.</p>  

<h3>How to measure 0.33 cup of crushed garlic</h3>  
<p>To measure 0.33 cup of crushed garlic, use a liquid measuring cup for accuracy. Pack the garlic lightly to avoid air gaps, and level it off with a knife. If you don’t have a measuring cup, a kitchen scale set to ounces will do the trick—just aim for 2.64 ounces. This method is especially handy for air fryer recipes where precision matters.</p>  

<h2>Common recipes using 0.33 cup crushed garlic</h2>  
<p>Many air fryer dishes benefit from 0.33 cup (2.64 ounces) of crushed garlic. Try it in garlic bread, marinades for chicken, or even homemade garlic aioli.

<h3>Storing crushed garlic for future use</h3>  
<p>If you’ve measured out 0.33 cup of crushed garlic but don’t need it all, store the rest properly. Place it in an airtight container with a bit of olive oil to preserve freshness.

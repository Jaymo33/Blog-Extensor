<p>585 ml of buttermilk equals approximately 2.47 cups in the UK and 2.48 cups in the US. This conversion is essential for bakers and cooks who rely on precise measurements for perfect results. Whether you're whipping up pancakes, scones, or a moist cake, knowing how to convert 585 ml of buttermilk to cups ensures consistency in your recipes. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we understand the importance of accurate measurements, especially when using an air fryer for baking.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Buttermilk Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Using the correct amount of buttermilk can make or break a recipe. Too little, and your baked goods may turn out dry; too much, and they could become soggy. For air fryer recipes, precision is even more critical due to the appliance's rapid cooking process. Converting 585 ml of buttermilk to cups ensures you get the right texture and flavour every time. If you're unsure about other conversions, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for quick reference.</p>  

<p>Buttermilk adds a tangy flavour and tender crumb to cakes, muffins, and fried chicken. Whether you're following a British or American recipe, knowing that 585 ml of buttermilk equals roughly 2.47 cups (UK) or 2.48 cups (US) helps avoid guesswork. For more baking tips, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a>, which includes air fryer-friendly desserts and savoury dishes.</p>  

<h3>UK vs. US Cup Measurements</h3>  
<p>The slight difference between UK and US cup measurements stems from their respective standards. A UK cup holds 250 ml, while a US cup is 240 ml. This means 585 ml of buttermilk converts to 2.47 cups in the UK and 2.48 cups in the US. Though the variance is minimal, it's worth noting for precision baking. If you're using an air fryer, consistency is key, so always measure carefully.</p>  

<h2>How to Measure Buttermilk Without a Scale</h2>  
<p>If you don't have a measuring jug or scale, you can still measure 585 ml of buttermilk using standard cups. Fill a UK cup (250 ml) twice, then add another half cup (125 ml) to reach 585 ml. For US cups, use two full cups (480 ml) and a tablespoon (15 ml) to approximate 585 ml. This method works well for recipes like our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>air fryer cakes</a>, where buttermilk adds moisture and lift.</p>  

<p>Another tip is to use a liquid measuring cup with clear markings for accuracy. Pour the buttermilk slowly to avoid spills, and check at eye level for the correct measurement. For sticky ingredients like buttermilk, lightly greasing the cup can help it slide out easily. Need more air fryer tips?

<h3>Common Recipes Using 585 ml of Buttermilk</h3>  
<p>Many classic recipes call for around 585 ml of buttermilk, such as buttermilk pancakes, red velvet cake, or fried chicken. In an air fryer, buttermilk-marinated chicken turns out crispy and juicy. The acidity in buttermilk also helps tenderise meat, making it a favourite for <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>air fryer chicken recipes</a>. Whether baking or frying, accurate measurements ensure success.</p>  

<h2>Storing Leftover Buttermilk</h2>  
<p>If your recipe doesn't use all 585 ml of buttermilk, store the remainder in an airtight container in the fridge for up to two weeks. You can also freeze buttermilk in ice cube trays for future use. Thawed buttermilk works well in pancakes or muffins, though it may separate slightly—just give it a stir before using. For more storage tips, check our guide on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>keeping your air fryer clean</a> while cooking with buttermilk.</p>  

<p>Buttermilk substitutes include mixing milk with lemon juice or vinegar, but for the best results, stick to the real thing when possible. Converting 585 ml of buttermilk to cups ensures you're using the right amount, whether you're baking or marinating.

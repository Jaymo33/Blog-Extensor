<p>1.33 cups of tahini equals approximately 10.64 ounces. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements can make or break your dish. Whether you’re whipping up a batch of hummus or adding tahini to marinades, knowing the exact weight ensures consistency. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we focus on accuracy to help you achieve culinary perfection. Let’s dive deeper into why this measurement matters and how to use it effectively.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>
<p>Air fryers rely on even cooking, and precise ingredient measurements are key to achieving this. Too much tahini can make dishes overly dense, while too little might leave them lacking flavour. For recipes like tahini-glazed chicken or roasted vegetables, 10.64 ounces of tahini ensures the right balance. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for other common ingredient conversions. Accurate measurements also help when scaling recipes up or down for different serving sizes.</p>

<p>Using a kitchen scale is the best way to measure 10.64 ounces of tahini, but if you don’t have one, measuring cups will do. Just remember that tahini’s thick consistency can make cup measurements tricky. Stirring it well before measuring helps avoid air pockets. For more tips on perfecting your air fryer dishes, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipes section</a>. Consistency is the secret to restaurant-quality results at home.</p>

<h2>How to Use 1.33 Cups of Tahini in Air Fryer Recipes</h2>
<p>Tahini adds a rich, nutty flavour to many air fryer dishes. With 10.64 ounces, you can make a delicious tahini sauce for drizzling over falafel or roasted veggies. It’s also a key ingredient in marinades for chicken or tofu, ensuring a crispy exterior and moist interior. Visit our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipe category</a> for inspiration. The versatility of tahini makes it a staple in many cuisines, from Middle Eastern to Mediterranean.</p>

<h3>Storing Leftover Tahini</h3>
<p>If you don’t use all 10.64 ounces at once, store the leftover tahini in an airtight container in the fridge. It can last for months if kept properly sealed. Stir it well before reusing, as separation is natural. For more storage tips and tricks, check out our guide on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>keeping your air fryer clean</a>. Proper storage ensures your tahini stays fresh and ready for your next culinary adventure.</p>

<h2>Common Mistakes When Measuring Tahini</h2>
<p>One of the biggest mistakes is not stirring tahini before measuring, leading to inaccurate amounts. Another is using liquid measuring cups instead of dry ones, which can affect the volume. For 10.64 ounces of tahini, always use a dry measuring cup or a scale. Overpacking the cup can also result in more tahini than needed, throwing off your recipe. Precision is key, especially in air fryer cooking where balance is everything.</p>

<h3>Alternative Uses for Tahini in Your Air Fryer</h3>
<p>Beyond sauces and marinades, tahini can be used in air fryer desserts like tahini cookies or drizzled over roasted sweet potatoes. Its creamy texture and rich flavour make it a versatile ingredient. Experiment with 10.64 ounces of tahini in different dishes to discover new favourites.

<p>1.5 tablespoons of rice is approximately 18 grams, though this can vary slightly depending on the type of rice. Whether you're using an air fryer or preparing a stovetop dish, knowing this conversion ensures your recipes turn out perfectly. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we understand the importance of accurate measurements for consistent results.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Rice Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Getting the right amount of rice is crucial, especially when cooking in an air fryer. Too much rice can lead to uneven cooking, while too little might leave you with a dry or underwhelming dish. For air fryer recipes like crispy rice cakes or stuffed peppers, 1.5 tbsp of rice (about 18 grams) is often the perfect portion. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipes</a> section for inspiration on how to use this measurement in delicious meals.</p>  

<p>Different types of rice, such as basmati, jasmine, or brown rice, may have slight variations in weight per tablespoon. However, 18 grams is a reliable average for most white rice varieties. If you're meal prepping or scaling up a recipe, this conversion ensures you stay on track without needing a scale every time.</p>  

<h3>Types of Rice and Their Weights</h3>  
<p>While 1.5 tbsp of standard white rice weighs around 18 grams, brown rice tends to be slightly denser, coming in at about 20 grams for the same volume. Short-grain rice, like sushi rice, may also differ. For precise air fryer cooking, consider weighing your rice the first time to confirm the conversion for your preferred variety.</p>  

<h2>How to Measure Rice Without a Scale</h2>  
<p>If you don’t have a kitchen scale, using tablespoons is a handy alternative. A level 1.5 tbsp scoop of rice will give you roughly 18 grams, but avoid packing it down to prevent over-measuring. For more tips on air fryer conversions, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> is a great resource.</p>  

<p>Measuring rice correctly ensures your air fryer dishes, like fried rice or stuffed vegetables, have the ideal texture. Too much rice can make dishes stodgy, while too little might not hold together. Whether you're cooking for one or meal prepping, this small measurement makes a big difference.</p>  

<h3>Common Recipes Using 1.5 tbsp of Rice</h3>  
<p>This measurement is perfect for single-serving dishes like air fryer rice balls or stuffed mushrooms. It’s also useful for adding small amounts of rice to mixed dishes, such as stir-fries or casseroles. Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetables</a> category for creative ways to incorporate rice into your meals.</p>  

<h2>Tips for Cooking Rice in an Air Fryer</h2>  
<p>When using 1.5 tbsp of rice in an air fryer, pre-cooking it slightly ensures even results. Parboil or soak the rice for a few minutes before air frying to avoid dryness. For crispy rice dishes, a light spray of oil and a higher temperature work wonders.</p>  

<p>Cleaning your air fryer after cooking rice is essential to prevent residue buildup. Our guide on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner</a> offers simple steps to keep your appliance in top shape.

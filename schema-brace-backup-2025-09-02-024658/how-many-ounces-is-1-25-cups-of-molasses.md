<p>1.25 cups of molasses equals approximately 10.6 ounces (or 300 grams). This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes, where precise measurements can make or break your dish. Whether you’re baking gingerbread cookies or a sticky toffee pudding, knowing the exact weight ensures consistent results every time.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on even heat distribution, so ingredient ratios are crucial. Too much molasses can lead to overly dense or sticky results, while too little might leave your bake dry. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> simplifies these calculations, helping you adapt traditional recipes effortlessly.</p>  

<p>Molasses, a thick, sweet syrup, varies slightly in weight depending on brand and temperature. For UK bakers, using a kitchen scale is the most reliable method, but our cup-to-ounce conversion eliminates guesswork. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>molasses-based recipes</a> for inspiration!</p>  

<h3>How to Measure Molasses Without a Scale</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a scale, use the spoon-and-level method for cups. Lightly grease your measuring cup to help the molasses slide out cleanly. For 1.25 cups, fill one cup completely, then add a quarter cup—scraping the excess off with a straight edge.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for Molasses in Air Fryer Recipes</h2>  
<p>Molasses adds depth to baked goods and marinades. Try it in air-fried BBQ ribs or as a glaze for roasted vegetables. Its rich flavour pairs perfectly with spices like cinnamon and ginger, making it a staple for festive treats.</p>  

<p>For a healthier twist, swap refined sugar with molasses in <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>air fryer cakes</a>. Just remember: 1.25 cups of molasses (10.6 oz) is sweeter than granulated sugar, so adjust other liquids accordingly. Need cleaning tips after sticky bakes? Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner guide</a> has you covered.</p>  

<h3>Molasses Substitutes and Conversions</h3>  
<p>If you’re out of molasses, mix ¾ cup honey with ¼ cup dark brown sugar for a similar flavour. Note that substitutes may alter texture, so stick to the 10.6-ounce measurement for best results.

<p>2 tablespoons (tbsp) of coconut oil weigh approximately 28 grams. This conversion is essential for precise cooking, especially when using an air fryer where measurements can impact texture and cooking times. Whether you're following a recipe from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> or improvising, knowing the exact weight ensures consistent results.</p>

<h2>Why accurate coconut oil measurements matter</h2>  
<p>Using the correct amount of coconut oil in your air fryer recipes ensures even cooking and prevents excess grease. Too much oil can lead to soggy results, while too little may cause dryness. For dishes like crispy potatoes or air-fried chicken, 28 grams (2 tbsp) of coconut oil is often the perfect balance. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more handy measurement tips.</p>  

<p>Coconut oil’s density means volume measurements like tablespoons aren’t always precise. Factors like temperature (solid vs. melted) can slightly alter the weight, but 28 grams per 2 tbsp is a reliable standard. If you’re adapting recipes from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>our recipe collection</a>, this conversion keeps things simple.</p>  

<h3>How to measure coconut oil for air frying</h3>  
<p>For best results, use a kitchen scale to weigh 28 grams of coconut oil. If you don’t have one, level off 2 tbsp with a knife for a close estimate. Melted coconut oil can be measured by volume, but solid oil should be packed firmly into the spoon. This ensures accuracy for air fryer recipes like roasted vegetables or <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>crispy chicken</a>.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for 2 tbsp of coconut oil in air frying</h2>  
<p>Many air fryer recipes call for 2 tbsp (28 grams) of coconut oil to coat ingredients evenly. It’s ideal for roasting Brussels sprouts, crisping tofu, or making golden sweet potato fries. The oil’s high smoke point makes it perfect for air frying at high temperatures without burning. Explore <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert recipes</a> where coconut oil adds richness to baked goods too.</p>  

<p>Beyond cooking, coconut oil can help maintain your air fryer. A light coat (about 2 tbsp) on the basket prevents sticking, and it’s easy to clean with <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>our recommended cleaner</a>. Just remember: precise measurements keep your meals delicious and your appliance in top shape.</p>  

<h3>Converting other coconut oil amounts</h3>  
<p>If a recipe requires more or less coconut oil, here’s a quick guide: 1 tbsp ≈ 14 grams, 3 tbsp ≈ 42 grams, and ¼ cup ≈ 56 grams. These conversions work for both refined and unrefined coconut oil, though weights may vary slightly by brand. Always adjust air fryer temperatures and times based on the oil amount used.</p>

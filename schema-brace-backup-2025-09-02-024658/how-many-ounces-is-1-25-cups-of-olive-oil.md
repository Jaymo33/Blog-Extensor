<p>1.25 cups of olive oil equals 10 fluid ounces (fl oz) or approximately 10.6 ounces by weight. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements can make or break your dish. Whether you’re drizzling oil over vegetables or using it in a marinade, knowing the exact amount ensures perfect results every time. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we’re all about helping you cook with confidence, and this guide will make converting cups to ounces a snap.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate olive oil measurements matter</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of olive oil in your air fryer recipes is crucial for texture and flavour. Too little oil, and your food might dry out; too much, and it could become greasy. For example, crispy air-fried potatoes need just enough oil to coat them evenly without soaking. If you’re working with 1.25 cups of olive oil, knowing it’s 10 fluid ounces helps you portion it correctly. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more handy measurement tips.</p>  

<p>Olive oil is denser than water, so its weight and volume don’t align perfectly. While 1 cup of water is 8 fluid ounces, 1 cup of olive oil weighs about 7.7 ounces. That’s why 1.25 cups of olive oil translates to roughly 10.6 ounces by weight. For most air fryer recipes, fluid ounces (volume) are more practical, but weight can be useful for baking. If you’re prepping a marinade or dressing, fluid ounces will give you the consistency you need.</p>  

<h3>How to measure olive oil for air frying</h3>  
<p>The easiest way to measure 1.25 cups of olive oil is with a liquid measuring cup. Fill it to the 1-cup mark, then add another quarter cup. If you don’t have a measuring cup, you can use a kitchen scale set to ounces. Pour the oil until it reaches 10 fluid ounces (or 10.6 ounces by weight). For smaller batches, tablespoons and teaspoons work too—1.25 cups equals 20 tablespoons or 60 teaspoons. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a> includes plenty of dishes where precise oil measurements matter.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for 1.25 cups of olive oil in air fryers</h2>  
<p>This amount of olive oil is perfect for batch cooking or meal prep. For example, you might use it to coat a large tray of roasted vegetables or marinate chicken for a family dinner. Air-fried mushrooms or crispy tofu also benefit from a light oil coating—1.25 cups gives you enough for multiple servings. If you’re making homemade air fryer chips, this quantity ensures even crispiness without excess grease. Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable recipes</a> for inspiration.</p>  

<p>Olive oil isn’t just for cooking—it’s also great for seasoning your air fryer basket. A light wipe with oil prevents sticking and makes cleanup easier. Just be sure not to overdo it, as excess oil can smoke at high temperatures. After cooking, check out our guide on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning your air fryer</a> to keep it in top condition. Whether you’re frying, roasting, or baking, 1.25 cups (10 ounces) of olive oil is a versatile quantity to have on hand.</p>  

<h3>Tips for storing and reusing olive oil</h3>  
<p>If you’ve measured out 1.25 cups of olive oil but don’t use it all, store it properly to maintain freshness. Keep it in an airtight container away from heat and light. Used oil from air frying can be strained and reused once or twice, but discard it if it smells off. For best results, stick to fresh oil when cooking delicate dishes like fish or desserts.

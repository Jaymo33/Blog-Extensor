<p>1.5 cups of self-raising flour equals approximately 6.35 ounces (180 grams). This conversion is essential for precise baking, especially when using an air fryer for cakes or other flour-based recipes. Getting the measurement right ensures your baked goods rise perfectly and have the ideal texture. Whether you're following a recipe from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> or experimenting with your own creations, accurate measurements make all the difference.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Flour Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Baking is a science, and even small deviations in flour measurements can affect the outcome of your recipe. Too much flour can make your cakes dense, while too little may cause them to collapse. When converting 1.5 cups of self-raising flour to ounces, precision ensures consistency. This is particularly important for air fryer baking, where heat distribution is rapid and even. For more tips on perfecting your air fryer recipes, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>  

<p>Self-raising flour already contains baking powder, so measuring it correctly ensures the right rise. If you're adapting a recipe from cups to ounces, always use a kitchen scale for the best results. Many bakers prefer weighing ingredients because it eliminates the variability of scooping flour. Whether you're making a classic Victoria sponge or trying a new <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>air fryer cake recipe</a>, accurate measurements are key.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure 1.5 Cups of Self-Raising Flour</h3>  
<p>To measure 1.5 cups of self-raising flour correctly, fluff the flour with a spoon before lightly spooning it into a measuring cup. Level it off with a knife for an exact amount. This method prevents packing too much flour into the cup, which can lead to inaccurate conversions. If you're using a scale, 1.5 cups of self-raising flour should weigh around 6.35 ounces (180 grams). For more baking tips, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a>.</p>  

<h2>Common Conversions for Self-Raising Flour</h2>  
<p>Converting cups to ounces is straightforward once you know the standard weight of self-raising flour. One cup of self-raising flour typically weighs 4.25 ounces (120 grams), so 1.5 cups equal 6.35 ounces. This conversion is useful for scaling recipes up or down, especially when baking in smaller batches in your air fryer. If you're working with other ingredients, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a> can help you adjust measurements effortlessly.</p>  

<p>For those who prefer metric measurements, 1.5 cups of self-raising flour is roughly 180 grams. This is particularly helpful if you're following a UK-based recipe or using a digital scale. Remember, self-raising flour behaves differently than plain flour due to the added leavening agents. Always double-check your conversions to avoid baking mishaps. Whether you're making scones or muffins, precise measurements ensure success.</p>  

<h3>Tips for Baking with Self-Raising Flour in an Air Fryer</h3>  
<p>Air fryers are fantastic for baking, but they require slight adjustments compared to traditional ovens. When using self-raising flour, ensure your batter or dough isn't too thick, as it needs room to rise. Preheat your air fryer for even cooking, and avoid overcrowding the basket. For easy cleanup, consider using <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer liners</a> to keep your appliance in top condition.</p>

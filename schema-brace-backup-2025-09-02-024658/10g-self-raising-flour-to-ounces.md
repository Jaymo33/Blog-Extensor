<p>10g of self-raising flour equals approximately 0.35 ounces. This conversion is essential for bakers who need precise measurements, especially when using an air fryer for cakes or bread. Whether you're following a recipe from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> or adapting a traditional bake, knowing how to convert grams to ounces ensures consistent results.</p>

<h2>Why Convert 10g of Self-Raising Flour to Ounces?</h2>  
<p>Many UK recipes use grams, while some older cookbooks or international recipes might list ingredients in ounces. Converting 10g of self-raising flour to ounces (0.35 oz) helps maintain accuracy, particularly in air fryer baking where precise ratios matter. Self-raising flour contains baking powder, so getting the measurement right affects how well your baked goods rise.</p>  
<p>If you're exploring <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer cake recipes</a>, this conversion ensures your sponges turn out light and fluffy. Even small discrepancies can lead to dense or uneven results, so using a digital scale for 10g measurements is ideal before switching to imperial units.</p>  

<h2>How to Measure 10g of Self-Raising Flour Accurately</h2>  
<p>For the most precise 10g-to-ounces conversion, use a digital kitchen scale set to grams. Scoop the flour lightly into a measuring cup without packing it down, then level it off. If you don't have a scale, 10g of self-raising flour is roughly two levelled teaspoons, but weighing is always more reliable.</p>  
<p>When preparing <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>air fryer cakes</a>, sift the 10g of self-raising flour (0.35 oz) after measuring to incorporate air and prevent lumps. This step is crucial for even rising in the compact environment of an air fryer basket, where heat circulation differs from conventional ovens.</p>  

<h3>Common Uses for 10g of Self-Raising Flour</h3>  
<p>Small quantities like 10g (0.35 oz) of self-raising flour often appear in recipes for glazes, coatings, or small-batch bakes. For example, a single-serving air fryer mug cake might call for exactly 10g to achieve the perfect texture without waste. It's also handy for dusting surfaces when working with sticky doughs.</p>  

<h2>Converting Other Flour Quantities</h2>  
<p>Once you've mastered the 10g-to-ounces conversion, you can apply the same ratio to larger amounts. For instance, 100g of self-raising flour equals 3.5 ounces, while 50g translates to 1.75 ounces. Keep a <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a> handy for quick reference during recipe adjustments.</p>  
<p>Remember that self-raising flour behaves differently than plain flour due to its leavening agents. If substituting, you'll need to adjust baking powder separately.

<h3>Does Packing Affect the 10g Measurement?</h3>  
<p>Yes – densely packed 10g of self-raising flour will occupy less volume than sifted flour, though the weight remains constant. For consistent results in air fryer recipes, always measure 10g by weight (0.35 oz) rather than volume, especially when precision matters for chemical reactions in baking.</p>

<p>960 ml of coconut milk is equal to approximately 4.06 cups. This conversion is essential for anyone using coconut milk in recipes, especially when cooking with an air fryer. Whether you're making a creamy curry or a dairy-free dessert, knowing the exact measurement ensures perfect results every time. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we understand the importance of precise measurements for flawless dishes. Let’s dive deeper into how to measure coconut milk accurately for your air fryer recipes.</p>  

<h2>Understanding Coconut Milk Measurements</h2>  
<p>Coconut milk is a staple in many recipes, from curries to desserts, and getting the measurement right is crucial. The density of coconut milk can vary slightly depending on the brand and whether it's full-fat or light. For most standard conversions, 1 cup equals 236.59 ml, which means 960 ml translates to roughly 4.06 cups. This measurement is particularly useful when scaling recipes up or down for your air fryer.</p>  

<p>If you're working with a recipe that calls for 960 ml of coconut milk, you might wonder if you can eyeball it. While it’s tempting, we recommend using a measuring jug for accuracy.

<h3>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h3>  
<p>Air fryers rely on even cooking, and incorrect measurements can throw off the balance of your dish. Too much liquid, like coconut milk, can make food soggy, while too little might dry it out. Measuring 960 ml of coconut milk correctly ensures your air fryer dishes turn out just right.

<h2>Converting 960 ml of Coconut Milk for Baking</h2>  
<p>Baking with coconut milk requires precision, as even small measurement errors can affect texture and taste.

<p>To measure 960 ml of coconut milk accurately, use a liquid measuring jug with clear markings. Stir the coconut milk well before pouring, as it can separate in the can. For sticky or thick coconut milk, lightly grease the measuring cup to ensure all the liquid pours out. These small steps make a big difference in your air fryer cooking.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for 960 ml of Coconut Milk</h2>

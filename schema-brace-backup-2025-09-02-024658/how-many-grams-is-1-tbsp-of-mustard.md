<p>One tablespoon (1 tbsp) of mustard weighs approximately 15 grams. This measurement is based on standard UK mustard, whether it's English, Dijon, or wholegrain. Knowing this conversion is especially useful when preparing air fryer recipes, where precise ingredient weights can make all the difference. If you're using a recipe from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, this conversion ensures your dishes turn out perfectly every time. Mustard is a versatile ingredient, so getting the measurement right is key for marinades, dressings, or glazes.</p>

<h2>Why Measuring Mustard in Grams Matters</h2>
<p>When cooking with an air fryer, accuracy is crucial for consistent results. Unlike volume measurements (like tablespoons), grams provide a precise weight that eliminates guesswork. This is particularly important for recipes like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer chicken</a>, where mustard might be part of a marinade. Too much or too little can alter the flavour and texture. Using grams also makes scaling recipes up or down much easier. Whether you're meal prepping or cooking for one, grams ensure uniformity.</p>

<p>Mustard’s density can vary slightly depending on the type. Smooth mustard like Dijon may weigh a tad less than grainy varieties, but 15 grams per tablespoon is a reliable average. If you're unsure, a digital kitchen scale is the best tool for accuracy. For more conversion help, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>. It’s a lifesaver for all your cooking measurements, not just mustard!</p>

<h2>How to Convert 1 Tbsp Mustard to Grams</h2>
<p>Converting tablespoons to grams is simple once you know the standard weight. As mentioned, 1 tbsp of mustard equals about 15 grams. If your recipe calls for multiple tablespoons, just multiply accordingly. For example, 2 tbsp would be 30 grams, and half a tablespoon would be roughly 7.5 grams. This method works for all types of mustard, from classic yellow to spicy English varieties.</p>

<h3>Using a Kitchen Scale for Accuracy</h3>
<p>For the best results, use a digital kitchen scale. Place your bowl or container on the scale, tare it to zero, then add your mustard until you hit 15 grams. This eliminates any inconsistencies from how the mustard is packed into the spoon. If you're making a recipe like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>air fryer honey mustard chicken</a>, precision ensures the perfect balance of sweet and tangy.</p>

<h2>Common Mustard Measurements in Grams</h2>
<p>Here’s a quick reference for mustard conversions you might need:</p>
<ul>
<li>1 teaspoon mustard = 5 grams</li>
<li>1 tablespoon mustard = 15 grams</li>
<li>2 tablespoons mustard = 30 grams</li>
<li>¼ cup mustard = 60 grams</li>
</ul>
<p>These conversions are handy for scaling recipes or adjusting flavours. If you're experimenting with a new dish, like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>mustard-glazed veggies</a>, these measurements ensure consistency. Keep in mind that these weights are averages—always adjust to taste!</p>

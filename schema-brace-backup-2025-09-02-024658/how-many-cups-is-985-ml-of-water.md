<p>985 ml of water equals approximately 4.16 cups in the UK or 4.17 cups in the US. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise liquid measurements can make or break your dish. Whether you're preparing a sauce, batter, or marinade, knowing how to convert millilitres to cups ensures consistency and success. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we help you master these conversions for flawless cooking every time.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of liquid is crucial in air fryer recipes. Too much water can make food soggy, while too little may dry it out. For example, when making air fryer cakes or batters, 985 ml of water must be measured precisely to achieve the perfect texture. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> simplifies these calculations, so you never have to guess.</p>  
<p>Many air fryer recipes, like those for <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>cakes</a> or <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetables</a>, rely on liquid measurements. A slight deviation can alter cooking times and results. That’s why converting 985 ml of water to cups correctly ensures your dishes turn out as intended. Bookmark our guide for quick reference whenever you’re in doubt.</p>  

<h3>UK vs. US Cup Measurements</h3>  
<p>In the UK, 1 cup equals 284 ml, while in the US, it’s 240 ml. This means 985 ml of water is roughly 4.16 UK cups or 4.17 US cups. Always check your recipe’s origin to avoid confusion. For more air fryer tips, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a>.</p>  

<h2>How to Measure 985 ml of Water Without a Measuring Cup</h2>  
<p>If you don’t have a measuring cup, use a kitchen scale. Since 1 ml of water weighs 1 gram, 985 ml equals 985 grams. Alternatively, a standard mug holds about 250 ml, so 985 ml is just under 4 mugs. For air fryer recipes, precision is key, so investing in a good measuring jug is worthwhile.</p>  
<p>Another handy trick is to use tablespoons. One UK tablespoon holds 15 ml, so 985 ml is roughly 65.6 tablespoons. While this method works in a pinch, it’s less accurate for baking. For foolproof results, stick to millilitre or cup measurements, especially when trying new recipes from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>.</p>  

<h3>Common Uses for 985 ml of Water in Air Fryer Cooking</h3>  
<p>This quantity is often used for steaming vegetables, making broths, or preparing batters. For example, air fryer <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/potatoes>potato dishes</a> might require 985 ml of water for parboiling. Always adjust based on your air fryer’s capacity and the recipe’s requirements.</p>  

<h2>Tips for Converting Other Liquid Measurements</h2>  
<p>Need to convert different amounts? Remember that 250 ml equals 1 UK cup (1.06 US cups). For larger quantities, like 1 litre (1000 ml), it’s roughly 4.23 UK cups or 4.17 US cups. Keep our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a> handy for quick checks.</p>  
<p>When scaling recipes, ensure all ingredients are adjusted proportionally. For instance, if a recipe calls for 985 ml of water and serves 4, halving it requires 492.5 ml (about 2.08 UK cups). Consistency is key, especially for air fryer cooking, where even small changes can affect results.</p>  

<h3>Cleaning Your Air Fryer After Liquid-Based Recipes</h3>  
<p>Spills or splatters from liquids like 985 ml of water can leave residue. Use our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning guide</a> to keep your appliance in top condition. Regular maintenance ensures optimal performance and longevity.</p>

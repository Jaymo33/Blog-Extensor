<p>2.5 cups of crushed garlic equals approximately 20 ounces (UK measurement). This conversion is essential for precise cooking, especially when using an air fryer where ingredient ratios can affect texture and flavour. Whether you're following a recipe from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes</a> or improvising, knowing this measurement ensures consistency.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Garlic Measurements Matter in Air Fryers</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on even cooking, and incorrect garlic quantities can lead to overpowering flavours or uneven browning. Crushed garlic, in particular, releases more aroma and taste compared to whole cloves, so precise measurements are crucial. If you're preparing dishes like garlic butter shrimp or roasted vegetables, 2.5 cups (20 oz) of crushed garlic will deliver bold, balanced results. For more air fryer tips, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a>.</p>  

<p>Garlic’s moisture content can vary, so weighing it ensures accuracy. A kitchen scale is ideal, but if you're using cups, lightly pack the crushed garlic without compressing it too tightly. This method helps maintain the correct 2.5 cups to ounces ratio, preventing overly intense flavours in your air-fried meals.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure Crushed Garlic Without a Scale</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a scale, use standard measuring cups for 2.5 cups of crushed garlic. Fill the cup loosely and level it off with a knife for consistency. Remember, 1 cup of crushed garlic is roughly 8 ounces, so 2.5 cups equal 20 ounces. For recipes like garlic bread or marinades, this measurement ensures perfect seasoning every time.</p>  

<h2>Common Recipes Using 2.5 Cups of Crushed Garlic</h2>  
<p>Many air fryer recipes benefit from 2.5 cups (20 oz) of crushed garlic. Dishes like garlic Parmesan potatoes or lemon-garlic chicken wings rely on this quantity for robust flavour. Visit <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>airfryerrecipe.co.uk’s chicken recipes</a> for inspiration. The air fryer’s rapid circulation ensures the garlic infuses evenly without burning.</p>  

<p>For vegetarian options, try garlic-roasted mushrooms or tofu with 2.5 cups of crushed garlic. The high heat of the air fryer caramelises the garlic, enhancing its natural sweetness. If you’re meal prepping, this measurement scales easily for larger batches, saving time and effort.</p>  

<h3>Adjusting Garlic Quantities for Different Dishes</h3>  
<p>While 2.5 cups of crushed garlic equals 20 ounces, you might need less for milder dishes. Start with half the amount and adjust to taste, especially for delicate proteins like fish or tofu. For more tips, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning guide</a> to keep your air fryer fresh after garlic-heavy meals.</p>  

<h2>Storing Leftover Crushed Garlic</h2>  
<p>If you’ve measured 2.5 cups of crushed garlic but don’t need it all, store leftovers in an airtight container in the fridge for up to a week. You can also freeze portions in ice cube trays for future use. This way, you’ll always have the right amount of garlic on hand for quick air fryer meals.</p>  

<p>Garlic’s potency diminishes over time, so label containers with the date. For recipes requiring 20 ounces (2.5 cups), thawed garlic works just as well as fresh. This storage method minimises waste and keeps your air fryer dishes flavourful.</p>  

<h3>Converting Garlic Measurements for Other Recipes</h3>  
<p>If a recipe calls for minced or whole garlic instead of crushed, adjust the 2.5 cups (20 oz) measurement accordingly. Minced garlic is denser, so you’ll need slightly less, while whole cloves yield a milder flavour. Experiment to find the perfect balance for your air fryer creations.</p>

<p>20g of mayonnaise is approximately 0.705 ounces. This conversion is handy when following air fryer recipes that require precise measurements, especially for sauces or dressings. Whether you're making crispy chicken or a quick snack, knowing how to convert grams to ounces ensures your dish turns out perfectly every time.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of mayonnaise can make or break your air fryer dish. Too much can lead to soggy results, while too little might leave your food dry. For example, when coating chicken or fish, 20g of mayonnaise (0.705 ounces) is often just enough to help breadcrumbs stick without overpowering the flavour. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more handy measurement tips.</p>  

<p>Precision is key for air fryer cooking because the hot circulating air cooks food quickly. A slight variation in ingredients like mayonnaise can affect texture and taste. If you're experimenting with recipes, always measure carefully—especially when dealing with small quantities like 20g. For more recipe ideas, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a>.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure 20g of Mayonnaise Without a Scale</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a kitchen scale, you can still measure 20g of mayonnaise using tablespoons. One tablespoon of mayonnaise weighs roughly 14g, so 20g is just under 1.5 tablespoons. This method isn’t as precise as weighing, but it works in a pinch for recipes like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>air fryer chicken</a>.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for 20g of Mayonnaise in Air Fryer Recipes</h2>  
<p>Mayonnaise isn’t just for sandwiches—it’s a versatile ingredient in air fryer cooking. A 20g portion is perfect for binding breadcrumbs to fish fillets or creating a crispy coating for veggies. Try it in our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/potatoes>air fryer potato recipes</a> for extra crunch.</p>  

<p>Another great use for 20g of mayonnaise is in marinades. Mix it with herbs and spices to create a creamy base for chicken or tofu. The air fryer’s high heat will crisp the exterior while keeping the inside moist.

<h3>Converting Other Mayonnaise Quantities</h3>  
<p>If your recipe calls for more or less than 20g, here’s a quick reference: 50g equals 1.76 ounces, and 100g equals 3.53 ounces. Keep these conversions handy for scaling recipes up or down.</p>

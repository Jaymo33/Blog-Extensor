<p>260 ml of chicken broth equals approximately 1.1 cups. This conversion is essential for recipes where precision matters, especially when using an air fryer. Whether you're making soups, sauces, or marinades, knowing how to measure 260 ml of chicken broth in cups ensures your dish turns out just right. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we understand the importance of accurate measurements for air fryer cooking.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Using the correct amount of chicken broth can make or break a recipe. Too much liquid can lead to soggy results, while too little might leave your dish dry. When converting 260 ml of chicken broth to cups, it's helpful to know that 1 cup is roughly 240 ml. This means 260 ml is slightly more than a standard cup, coming in at around 1.1 cups. For air fryer recipes, especially those involving marinades or basting, this precision ensures even cooking and perfect texture.</p>  

<p>If you're working with a recipe from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>our collection</a>, you'll often find measurements in both ml and cups. This flexibility makes it easier to follow along, no matter which measuring system you prefer. Whether you're preparing a hearty chicken dish or a light vegetable broth, knowing how to convert 260 ml of chicken broth to cups is a handy skill.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure 260 ml of Chicken Broth Without a Measuring Cup</h3>  
<p>Don’t have a measuring cup? No problem. You can use a standard mug or glass to estimate 260 ml of chicken broth. A typical UK mug holds about 250 ml, so filling it just slightly above the rim will get you close to 260 ml. Alternatively, use a kitchen scale—260 ml of chicken broth weighs roughly 260 grams, as the density of broth is nearly equal to water.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for 260 ml of Chicken Broth in Air Fryer Recipes</h2>  
<p>Chicken broth is a versatile ingredient in air fryer cooking. From deglazing pans to creating rich sauces, 260 ml (or 1.1 cups) is a common measurement. For example, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipes</a> often call for this amount to keep meats juicy and flavourful. You might also use it to cook grains or vegetables in the air fryer, ensuring they absorb maximum flavour without becoming waterlogged.</p>  

<p>Another great use for 260 ml of chicken broth is in marinades. Combining it with herbs and spices creates a delicious base for meats and veggies. Since air fryers circulate hot air, the broth helps prevent drying while adding depth to your dish. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a> for more handy measurement tips.</p>  

<h3>Does the Type of Chicken Broth Affect the Measurement?</h3>  
<p>Whether you’re using homemade, store-bought, or low-sodium chicken broth, the volume remains the same. 260 ml of any type of chicken broth will still equal roughly 1.1 cups. However, thicker broths or those with added cream may vary slightly in density, so it’s always best to measure by volume for accuracy.</p>  

<h2>Converting Other Liquid Measurements for Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>If you frequently work with ml and cups, it’s worth memorising a few key conversions. For instance, 500 ml is about 2.1 cups, and 100 ml is roughly 0.4 cups. This knowledge comes in handy when scaling recipes up or down. For more tips on air fryer measurements, visit <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>.</p>  

<p>Cleaning your air fryer after using liquids like chicken broth is also important. Residual broth can cause odours or stains if left unattended. Our guide on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>keeping your air fryer clean</a> offers simple solutions to maintain your appliance.</p>

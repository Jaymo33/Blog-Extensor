<p>10 grams of onion equals approximately 0.35 ounces. This conversion is handy when preparing air fryer recipes, especially if you’re working with UK measurements. Whether you’re dicing onions for a stir-fry or caramelising them for a topping, knowing the exact weight ensures your dish turns out perfectly every time.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate onion measurements matter in air fryers</h2>  
<p>Getting the right amount of onion can make or break your air fryer dish. Too little, and you might miss out on flavour; too much, and it could overpower other ingredients. Air fryers cook food quickly, so precise measurements help ensure even cooking. For example, recipes like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer caramelised onions</a> rely on the correct onion-to-oil ratio for perfect results.</p>  

<p>If you’re converting from grams to ounces, remember that 10g of onion is roughly 0.35 oz. This small but crucial detail helps when following international recipes or adjusting portion sizes. For more conversions, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> to simplify your cooking process.</p>  

<h3>How to measure 10g of onion without scales</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a kitchen scale, you can estimate 10g of onion by volume. One small onion (about the size of a golf ball) typically weighs around 50g, so 10g would be roughly one-fifth of that. Alternatively, finely chopped onion fills about two tablespoons, which is close to 10g. This method isn’t as precise as weighing, but it works in a pinch for recipes like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>air fryer vegetable dishes</a>.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for 10g of onion in air fryer recipes</h2>  
<p>Small amounts of onion, like 10g, are often used to add subtle flavour without overwhelming a dish. For example, a sprinkle of finely diced onion can enhance air fryer meatballs or stuffed mushrooms. It’s also perfect for seasoning batters or marinades, where a little goes a long way. If you’re meal prepping, knowing that 10g equals 0.35 ounces helps with portion control.</p>  

<p>Another great use for 10g of onion is in homemade <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner solutions</a>. A small amount of onion peel can be boiled with water and vinegar to create a natural cleaning agent. This trick keeps your air fryer fresh without harsh chemicals, making it a favourite among eco-conscious cooks.</p>  

<h3>Converting larger quantities of onion</h3>  
<p>If your recipe calls for more onion, simply scale up the conversion. For instance, 100g of onion is about 3.5 ounces, while 250g is roughly 8.8 ounces. This is useful for batch cooking or when preparing sides like air fryer onion rings. Keep in mind that onion density can vary slightly depending on how finely it’s chopped, so always measure for the best results.</p>  

<h2>Tips for storing leftover onion</h2>  
<p>If you’ve measured out 10g of onion but don’t need it all, proper storage keeps it fresh. Place chopped onion in an airtight container or wrap it tightly in cling film. Stored in the fridge, it’ll last 2–3 days without losing flavour. For longer storage, freeze diced onion in portions—10g (0.35 oz) per ice cube tray slot works well for future air fryer recipes.</p>  

<p>Onion can also be dehydrated and powdered for seasoning. Just spread 10g of finely chopped onion on an air fryer tray at 60°C for 2–3 hours. Once dry, blend it into a powder and store in a spice jar. This trick is perfect for adding instant flavour to rubs or sauces, and it’s a great way to reduce waste.</p>  

<h3>How 10g of onion compares to other ingredients</h3>  
<p>Understanding how 10g of onion measures against other ingredients helps with recipe adjustments. For example, 10g of onion is roughly equivalent to one small shallot or half a spring onion. If you’re substituting, keep in mind that different alliums have varying intensities. This knowledge is especially handy when tweaking <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>air fryer chicken recipes</a> to suit your taste.</p>

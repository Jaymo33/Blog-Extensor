<p>25g of brown sugar is approximately 0.88 ounces. This conversion is essential for anyone using air fryer recipes, especially when precise measurements matter. Whether you’re baking cookies or preparing a savoury dish, knowing how to convert grams to ounces ensures your recipe turns out perfectly every time.</p>

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>
<p>When using an air fryer, precise measurements can make or break your dish. Too much or too little sugar can affect texture, browning, and even cooking times. For example, a recipe calling for 25g of brown sugar (0.88 ounces) needs that exact amount to achieve the right caramelisation and moisture balance.</p>
<p>Many air fryer recipes, especially those for desserts like cookies or cakes, rely on accurate sugar measurements. If you’re exploring sweet treats on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, you’ll notice how crucial this is. Even savoury dishes, like glazed meats or vegetables, often require precise sugar amounts for the perfect finish.</p>

<h2>How to measure 25g of brown sugar without scales</h2>
<p>Not everyone has a kitchen scale handy, but there are easy ways to measure 25g of brown sugar (0.88 ounces) without one. A standard UK tablespoon holds about 12.5g of brown sugar, so two level tablespoons will give you roughly 25g. Packed brown sugar will be slightly more, so adjust accordingly.</p>
<p>For air fryer recipes, consistency is key. If you’re making a batch of cookies or a glaze, using the right amount ensures even cooking. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more handy measurement tips.</p>

<h3>Converting other sugar amounts</h3>
<p>If your recipe calls for more or less brown sugar, here’s a quick reference: 50g is 1.76 ounces, and 100g is 3.53 ounces. These conversions are useful when scaling recipes up or down for your air fryer. Whether you’re cooking for one or a crowd, precise measurements ensure consistent results.</p>

<h2>Common uses for 25g of brown sugar in air fryer recipes</h2>
<p>25g of brown sugar (0.88 ounces) is a common measurement in many air fryer recipes. It’s often used in glazes for meats like chicken or pork, adding a sweet and sticky finish. You’ll also find it in desserts like air-fried cookies or crumbles, where it provides moisture and caramelisation.</p>

Many of these recipes use 25g of brown sugar as a key ingredient, ensuring perfect results every time. Whether you’re a beginner or a pro, accurate measurements are the secret to air fryer success.</p>

<h3>Storing brown sugar for air fryer recipes</h3>

<p>2.25 cups of butter is equivalent to approximately 510 grams. This conversion is essential for baking and air frying, where precision ensures perfect results. Whether you're making cookies, cakes, or crispy air-fried treats, knowing how to convert cups to grams is a game-changer. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we understand the importance of accurate measurements for flawless recipes.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Butter Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Using the correct amount of butter can make or break your dish. Too little, and your baked goods might turn out dry; too much, and they could become greasy. For air fryer recipes, precise butter measurements ensure even cooking and perfect texture. If you're working with 2.25 cups of butter, converting to grams removes guesswork. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more handy tips.</p>  

<p>Butter density can vary slightly depending on temperature and brand, but 2.25 cups reliably translates to 510 grams. This standardisation is especially useful for UK bakers, where metric measurements dominate. Whether you're following a British or American recipe, this conversion keeps things consistent. For more air fryer-friendly baking ideas, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>cake recipes</a>.</p>  

<h2>How to Measure 2.25 Cups of Butter in Grams</h2>  
<p>The easiest way to measure 2.25 cups of butter in grams is by using a kitchen scale. Simply place your mixing bowl on the scale, tare it to zero, and add butter until you reach 510 grams. If you don’t have a scale, remember that 1 cup of butter equals about 227 grams, so 2.25 cups is roughly 510 grams. This method is foolproof for recipes like air-fried pastries or buttery crumb toppings.</p>  

<h3>US vs UK Butter Measurements</h3>  
<p>While 2.25 cups of butter equals 510 grams in both the US and UK, butter packaging differs. In the UK, butter is often sold in 250g blocks, making it easier to measure. In the US, butter comes in sticks, with each stick being 113 grams (½ cup). For 2.25 cups, you’d need 4.5 sticks or 510 grams. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a> includes both metric and imperial measurements for convenience.</p>  

<h2>Common Recipes Using 2.25 Cups of Butter</h2>  
<p>Many decadent recipes call for 2.25 cups of butter, including rich pound cakes, flaky croissants, and buttery shortbread. In the air fryer, this amount is perfect for making crispy, golden pastries or layered doughs. If you're experimenting with air-fried desserts, precise butter measurements ensure even browning and perfect texture.

<h3>Adjusting Recipes for Smaller Batches</h3>  
<p>If a recipe calls for 2.25 cups of butter but you’re cooking for fewer people, halve the amount to 1.125 cups (255 grams). This adjustment works well for smaller air fryer batches, like mini cakes or single-serving cookies. Always double-check conversions to avoid mishaps—especially when baking.

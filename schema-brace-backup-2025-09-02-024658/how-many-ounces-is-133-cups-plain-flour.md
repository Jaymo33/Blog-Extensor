<p>1.33 cups of plain flour equals approximately 5.3 ounces (150 grams) in UK measurements. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes, where precise ingredient weights ensure even cooking and perfect texture. Whether you’re baking cakes, cookies, or bread, knowing how to convert cups to ounces eliminates guesswork. For more air fryer measurement tips, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate flour measurements matter in air fryer baking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers cook food faster and more evenly than conventional ovens, making precise measurements crucial. Too much flour can dry out your baked goods, while too little may cause them to collapse. For example, a classic <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>air fryer cake</a> relies on the right flour-to-liquid ratio for a fluffy texture. Measuring 1.33 cups of plain flour as 5.3 ounces ensures consistency across recipes, whether you’re using a digital scale or measuring cups.</p>  

<p>Many UK bakers prefer weighing ingredients for reliability, especially when adapting American recipes that use cup measurements. If you’re new to air frying, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a> includes weight conversions for foolproof results. Remember, sifting flour before measuring can affect the weight—always fluff it up for accuracy.</p>  

<h3>How to measure 1.33 cups of plain flour without a scale</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a kitchen scale, use the spoon-and-level method for 1.33 cups of plain flour. Gently spoon flour into a measuring cup without packing it down, then level off the excess with a knife. This prevents compacting, which could add extra ounces. For reference, 1 cup of plain flour typically weighs 4 ounces (113g), so 1.33 cups equals roughly 5.3 ounces. Need more air fryer baking tips?

<h2>Common air fryer recipes using 1.33 cups of plain flour</h2>  
<p>This measurement pops up in many air fryer favourites, from savoury batters to sweet treats. For instance, a small batch of air fryer pancakes might call for 1.33 cups of plain flour (5.3 oz) to serve two. Similarly, homemade <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>desserts</a> like shortbread or muffins often use this quantity. Keeping your flour measurements precise ensures these dishes cook evenly in the air fryer’s compact space.</p>  

<p>When working with frozen dough or pre-made mixes, check if they align with your 1.33-cup (5.3 oz) measurement. Some brands list cup and ounce equivalents on packaging—handy for quick adjustments.

<p>2.0 cups of self-raising flour equals approximately 240 grams. This conversion is essential for air fryer baking, where precise measurements can make or break your recipe. Whether you’re making fluffy cakes or crispy breaded dishes, knowing the exact gram equivalent ensures consistent results every time. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we prioritise accuracy to help you master air fryer cooking effortlessly.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Flour Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Baking is a science, and even small measurement errors can lead to dense cakes or uneven textures. Self-raising flour, which contains baking powder, requires extra precision to ensure proper rise. In an air fryer, where heat distribution is rapid, the right flour quantity prevents undercooked or overly dry results. For more baking tips, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> collection.</p>  

<p>Using a kitchen scale is the most reliable method, but if you only have measuring cups, our conversion ensures you’re close to the mark. Remember, 2.0 cups of self-raising flour in grams is 240g, but slight variations can occur based on how you scoop the flour. For foolproof air fryer cakes, always level off your cups with a knife.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure Self-Raising Flour Correctly</h3>  
<p>To avoid compacting the flour, lightly spoon it into the measuring cup instead of scooping directly from the bag. This prevents excess flour from skewing your measurements. If you’re converting 2.0 cups of self-raising flour to grams regularly, consider investing in a digital scale for absolute precision. Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for other common ingredient conversions.</p>  

<h2>UK vs. US Cup Measurements</h2>  
<p>While 2.0 cups of self-raising flour in the UK and US are roughly the same (240g), slight differences exist due to cup sizing standards. UK cups are typically 250ml, whereas US cups are 240ml. For air fryer recipes on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we use the UK standard, but adjustments are minimal. Always check the recipe origin if precision is critical.</p>  

<p>If you’re adapting a US recipe, 2.0 cups of self-raising flour in grams may translate to 225–230g due to the smaller cup volume. To avoid guesswork, stick to weight measurements for international recipes. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>cake category</a> features UK-tested recipes with gram measurements for hassle-free baking.</p>  

<h3>Common Uses for 2.0 Cups of Self-Raising Flour</h3>  
<p>This quantity is perfect for small-batch air fryer cakes, scones, or batter-based dishes like onion rings. Self-raising flour’s built-in leavening agent simplifies recipes, eliminating the need for additional baking powder.

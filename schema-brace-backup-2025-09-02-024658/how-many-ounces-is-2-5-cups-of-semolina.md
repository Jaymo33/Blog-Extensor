<p>2.5 cups of semolina equals approximately 10.6 ounces (oz) in UK measurements. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precision matters, ensuring your dishes turn out perfectly every time. Whether you're making crispy semolina-coated chicken or a fluffy semolina cake, knowing the exact weight helps avoid kitchen mishaps.</p>

<h2>Why accurate semolina measurements matter</h2>
<p>Using the correct amount of semolina ensures your air fryer recipes have the right texture and consistency. Too much can make dishes dry, while too little might leave them soggy. For example, if you're coating chicken or fish in semolina before air frying, 2.5 cups (10.6 oz) is ideal for a light, crispy finish. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more handy measurement tips.</p>
<p>Semolina is a versatile ingredient, perfect for everything from baking to frying. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we recommend weighing ingredients like semolina for consistent results. This is especially important when adapting traditional oven recipes for your air fryer, as cooking times and temperatures can vary.</p>

<h2>How to measure semolina correctly</h2>
<p>For the most accurate conversion of 2.5 cups semolina to ounces, use digital kitchen scales. Scoop the semolina into your measuring cup without packing it down, then level off the top with a straight edge. This method gives you the standard cup measurement used in our 10.6 oz conversion.</p>
<p>If you don't have scales, remember that 1 cup of semolina typically weighs about 4.25 oz. So 2.5 cups Ã— 4.25 oz = 10.6 oz. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipes section</a> includes many dishes where this measurement comes in handy, from semolina-crusted fish to air-fried falafel.</p>

<h3>Semolina in air fryer cooking</h3>
<p>Semolina's coarse texture makes it ideal for air frying. When converting 2.5 cups of semolina to ounces (10.6 oz), you'll find this quantity perfect for coating proteins or creating crispy toppings. The even heat distribution in air fryers means semolina coatings brown beautifully without burning.</p>

<h3>Storing semolina for best results</h3>
<p>After measuring out your 2.5 cups (10.6 oz) of semolina, store any leftovers in an airtight container. This prevents moisture absorption which could affect future measurements. Proper storage ensures your semolina stays fresh for all your <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipes</a> and other air fryer creations.</p>

<h2>Common uses for 2.5 cups of semolina</h2>
<p>This quantity (10.6 oz) is perfect for making semolina pudding for 4-6 people in your air fryer. It's also enough to coat 8 chicken thighs or a whole medium-sized fish before air frying. The exact amount needed may vary slightly depending on your specific air fryer model and recipe.</p>
<p>For those who love baking, 2.5 cups (10.6 oz) of semolina makes excellent air fryer shortbread or cake bases. The measurement works well in many <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert recipes</a>, giving a lovely golden colour and satisfying crunch when cooked in the air fryer.</p>

<h3>Adjusting recipes for different air fryer sizes</h3>
<p>If your air fryer is smaller, you might need to reduce the 2.5 cups (10.6 oz) quantity accordingly. Larger models may require slightly more semolina to coat foods evenly. Always check your manufacturer's guidelines when adapting recipes.</p>

<h3>Cleaning after using semolina</h3>

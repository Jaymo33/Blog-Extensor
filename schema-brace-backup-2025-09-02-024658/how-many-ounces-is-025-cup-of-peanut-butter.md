Whether you're making peanut butter cookies, satay sauce, or energy bites, knowing how many ounces are in 0.25 cup of peanut butter helps avoid kitchen mishaps.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate peanut butter measurements matter</h2>  
<p>Using the correct amount of peanut butter in air fryer recipes ensures balanced flavours and textures. Too much can make dishes greasy, while too little may leave them dry. For example, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>peanut butter cookie recipe</a> relies on this exact measurement for chewy, golden results. Air fryers cook quickly, so precision is key to avoid under or overcooking.</p>  

<p>Peanut butter's density can vary slightly between brands, but 0.25 cup typically weighs 2 ounces. Natural peanut butter may settle differently, so always stir well before measuring. For consistent results, use a kitchen scale or the spoon-and-level method when measuring by volume.

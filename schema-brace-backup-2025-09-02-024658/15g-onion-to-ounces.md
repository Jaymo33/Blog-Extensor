<p>15 grams of onion equals approximately 0.53 ounces. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements can make all the difference in texture and flavour. Whether you’re making crispy onion toppings or adding them to a stir-fry, knowing this conversion helps you follow recipes accurately. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we focus on making cooking simpler with clear measurements and easy-to-follow guides.</p>

<h2>Why accurate onion measurements matter in air frying</h2>  
<p>Getting the right amount of onion ensures your dish isn’t overpowering or lacking in flavour. In an air fryer, ingredients cook quickly, so balance is key. Too much onion can release excess moisture, affecting crispiness, while too little might leave your dish bland. For perfect results, check our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> to streamline your cooking process.</p>  

<p>Onions vary in density depending on how they’re chopped—finely diced onions pack more tightly than roughly sliced ones. This means 15g of finely chopped onion might look like less in volume compared to larger slices. Using a kitchen scale removes the guesswork, especially for recipes where precision matters, like onion rings or stuffed peppers.</p>  

<h3>How to measure 15g of onion without scales</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a scale, roughly 2 tablespoons of finely chopped onion will weigh around 15g (0.53 oz). For larger slices, it’s closer to 1/4 of a small onion. Keep in mind that these are estimates, and investing in a cheap kitchen scale will give you consistent results. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipes section</a> includes weight and volume measurements for hassle-free cooking.</p>  

<h2>Common recipes using 15g of onion</h2>  
<p>Many air fryer dishes call for small amounts of onion to enhance flavour without overwhelming other ingredients. For example, 15g of onion is perfect for seasoning homemade burgers, adding to omelettes, or mixing into meatballs. Browse our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable recipes</a> for inspiration on how to use this measurement creatively.</p>  

<p>Another great use is in marinades or dressings, where 15g of finely grated onion blends seamlessly. If you’re meal prepping, pre-measuring 15g portions saves time and ensures consistency across batches. For more tips on efficient cooking, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/meal-prep>meal prep guides</a>.</p>  

<h3>Storing leftover onion</h3>  
<p>If you’ve prepped more onion than needed, store it in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 3 days. For longer storage, freeze chopped onion in 15g portions—it’ll stay fresh for months and be ready for your next air fryer session. Always label containers with weights to avoid confusion later.</p>

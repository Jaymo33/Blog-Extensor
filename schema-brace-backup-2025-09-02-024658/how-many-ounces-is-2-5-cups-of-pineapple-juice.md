<p>2.5 cups of pineapple juice equals 20 fluid ounces (or approximately 20 oz). Whether you're prepping a marinade or crafting a tropical glaze for air fryer dishes, accurate measurements ensure perfect results every time.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Pineapple Juice Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Getting the right amount of pineapple juice is crucial, especially when using an air fryer. Too much liquid can affect texture, while too little might leave your dish dry. For recipes like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer glazed chicken</a> or <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>pineapple upside-down cake</a>, precision ensures balanced flavours. Pineapple juice also tenderises meat, so measuring correctly enhances your cooking.</p>  

<p>If you're scaling a recipe, knowing that 2.5 cups of pineapple juice is 20 oz helps avoid guesswork. This is particularly handy for batch cooking or meal prep. A quick check on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>our conversion chart</a> saves time and guarantees consistency.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure Pineapple Juice Correctly</h3>  
<p>Use a liquid measuring cup for accuracy, filling it to the 2.5-cup mark at eye level. For sticky juices like pineapple, lightly grease the cup first to ensure all liquid pours out. If your recipe calls for weight, note that 20 fluid ounces of pineapple juice weighs roughly 567 grams.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for 2.5 Cups of Pineapple Juice</h2>  
<p>This quantity is ideal for marinades, sauces, or even <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/breakfast>air fryer breakfast recipes</a>. Try it in a teriyaki glaze or mix it with spices for pulled pork. Pineapple juice’s natural sweetness also works wonders in desserts, like air fryer caramelised pineapple skewers.</p>  

<p>Leftover juice? Freeze it in ice cube trays for future use. Just thaw and measure as needed—no waste! For more creative ideas, browse <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>.</p>

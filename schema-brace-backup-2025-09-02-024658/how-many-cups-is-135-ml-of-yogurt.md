<p>135 ml of yogurt is approximately 0.57 cups (just over half a cup). Whether you're baking a cake or prepping an air fryer recipe, knowing this conversion ensures perfect results every time. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we understand how precise measurements can make or break a dish, especially when using an air fryer.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Yogurt Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of yogurt is crucial for achieving the right texture and moisture in your dishes. Too much can make baked goods soggy, while too little can leave them dry. If you're adapting a recipe for your air fryer, like those found in our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipes section</a>, precision is key. Yogurt adds richness and tenderness, so getting the 135 ml to cups conversion right matters.</p>  

<p>For air fryer cooking, yogurt is often used in marinades or as a binding agent. Whether you're making chicken skewers or a moist cake, knowing that 135 ml of yogurt equals roughly 0.57 cups helps streamline your prep. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more handy measurement swaps.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure 135 ml of Yogurt Without a Scale</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a measuring jug, you can use a standard metric cup. Fill it just over halfway to reach 135 ml. For thicker yogurts like Greek yogurt, spoon it into the cup and level it off for accuracy. This method works well for air fryer recipes, ensuring consistency in dishes like our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipes</a>.</p>  

<h2>Converting 135 ml of Yogurt in UK vs. US Cups</h2>  
<p>In the UK, 1 cup equals 250 ml, meaning 135 ml is roughly 0.54 UK cups. In the US, 1 cup is 240 ml, so 135 ml converts to about 0.56 US cups. The difference is minimal but worth noting for precision baking. If you're following an American recipe for your air fryer, stick to the US measurement.</p>  

<p>For air fryer-friendly desserts like muffins or pancakes, this small variance won’t ruin your dish. However, for delicate bakes, like those in our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>cakes category</a>, sticking to the exact 135 ml (0.57 cups) ensures perfection. Always use the same measuring system as your recipe to avoid confusion.</p>  

<h3>Common Recipes Using 135 ml of Yogurt</h3>  
<p>Many air fryer recipes call for 135 ml of yogurt, such as marinades for tandoori chicken or batter for onion bhajis. It’s also a key ingredient in moist banana bread or fluffy pancakes. For more inspiration, browse our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a> tailored for air fryer cooking.</p>  

<h2>Tips for Working with Yogurt in Air Fryer Recipes</h2>  
<p>Yogurt can curdle at high heat, so when using it in air fryer dishes, mix it with other ingredients first. For marinades, let the yogurt sit for at least 30 minutes to tenderise meat. If substituting Greek yogurt, note that it’s thicker, so you may need a splash of water to match 135 ml’s consistency.</p>  

<p>Cleaning your air fryer after yogurt-based recipes is easy with our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning guide</a>. Yogurt residues can stick, so a quick wipe post-cooking keeps your appliance in top shape. Whether you’re baking or marinating, 135 ml of yogurt (0.57 cups) is a versatile measurement to master.</p>

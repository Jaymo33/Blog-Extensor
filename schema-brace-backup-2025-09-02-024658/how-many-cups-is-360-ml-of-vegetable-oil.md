<p>360 ml of vegetable oil is approximately 1.52 cups. This conversion is essential for air fryer cooking, where precise measurements ensure perfect textures and flavours. Whether you're frying, baking, or making dressings, knowing how much 360 ml of vegetable oil translates to in cups helps streamline your recipes. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we focus on making conversions simple so you can cook with confidence.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of vegetable oil in your air fryer ensures even cooking and prevents dryness or sogginess. Too much oil can lead to greasy results, while too little may cause sticking or uneven browning. Converting 360 ml of vegetable oil to cups (1.52 cups) helps maintain consistency, especially when following recipes from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>our collection</a>. Whether you're making crispy chicken or golden fries, precision is key.</p>  

<p>Air fryers rely on hot air circulation, so the oil quantity directly affects texture. For example, 360 ml of vegetable oil (1.52 cups) is ideal for coating a batch of roasted potatoes or marinating tofu. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a> for other common measurements to simplify your cooking process.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure 360 ml of Vegetable Oil Without a Scale</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a measuring jug, use standard cup measurements. Since 1 cup equals 236.59 ml, 360 ml of vegetable oil is roughly 1 and a half cups plus 1 tablespoon. For accuracy, pour the oil into a liquid measuring cup and check the ml markings. This method ensures your air fryer dishes turn out perfectly every time.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for 360 ml of Vegetable Oil in Air Fryers</h2>  
<p>360 ml of vegetable oil (1.52 cups) is a versatile quantity for air fryer recipes. It’s enough to coat a family-sized portion of chicken wings or prepare a batch of doughnuts. For healthier options, try using this amount in marinades or for lightly brushing vegetables before air frying. Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipes</a> for inspiration.</p>  

<p>When baking in the air fryer, 360 ml of vegetable oil can be used for moist cakes or muffins. Since air fryers cook faster than ovens, the oil helps retain moisture. If you’re making crispy snacks like spring rolls, this measurement ensures even frying without excess grease.

<h3>Converting 360 ml of Vegetable Oil for UK and US Recipes</h3>  
<p>In the UK, recipes often use millilitres, while US recipes favour cups. Knowing that 360 ml of vegetable oil equals 1.52 cups helps adapt recipes seamlessly. This is especially useful for air fryer users who follow international cooking blogs or YouTube tutorials. Always double-check conversions to avoid mishaps.</p>  

<h2>Tips for Storing Leftover Vegetable Oil</h2>  
<p>If you have leftover oil after measuring 360 ml (1.52 cups), store it in an airtight container away from heat. Reusing oil in the air fryer is safe for 2–3 batches, but avoid mixing old and new oil. For recipes requiring smaller quantities, like our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert section</a>, measure carefully to prevent waste.</p>  

<p>Proper storage maintains the oil’s quality, ensuring your next air fryer dish tastes fresh. If the oil smells off or looks cloudy, discard it. Keeping track of how much you use—like 360 ml of vegetable oil—helps manage kitchen inventory efficiently.</p>

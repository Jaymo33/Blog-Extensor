<p>250g of brown sugar equals approximately 8.82 ounces. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes, especially when baking cakes, cookies, or desserts. Whether you're following a UK recipe or adjusting measurements, knowing how to convert grams to ounces ensures accuracy. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we make conversions simple so you can focus on cooking. Keep reading for tips on measuring brown sugar and using it in your air fryer.</p>  

<h2>Why Convert 250g of Brown Sugar to Ounces?</h2>  
<p>Many UK recipes use grams, but if you're working with a scale or recipe that lists ounces, conversions are necessary. Brown sugar’s texture can vary, so precise measurements matter for consistency. Air fryer baking, in particular, benefits from accurate ingredient weights to ensure even cooking. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> simplifies this process. Whether you're making cookies or a cake, 250g (8.82 oz) of brown sugar will deliver the right sweetness.</p>  

<p>Using the correct amount of brown sugar affects moisture and caramelisation in air fryer recipes. Too little can leave baked goods dry, while too much may cause over-browning. For perfect results, measure 250g of brown sugar carefully. If you’re unsure, check our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a> for foolproof ideas. From sticky toffee pudding to chocolate chip cookies, precise measurements make all the difference.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure 250g of Brown Sugar Accurately</h3>  
<p>The best way to measure 250g of brown sugar is with a digital kitchen scale. Scoop the sugar into a bowl until the scale reads 250g, which equals 8.82 ounces. If you don’t have a scale, lightly pack the sugar into a measuring cup—though this method is less precise. For air fryer recipes, consistency is key, so investing in a scale is worthwhile. Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert category</a> for inspiration on using brown sugar.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for 250g of Brown Sugar in Air Fryers</h2>  
<p>Brown sugar adds depth to air fryer desserts like cakes, cookies, and crumbles. A 250g portion is perfect for a batch of 12-15 cookies or a small cake. Its moisture-retaining properties make it ideal for chewy textures. Try our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cookies>cookie recipes</a> to put your 250g (8.82 oz) of brown sugar to good use. From classic chocolate chip to ginger snaps, the possibilities are endless.</p>  

<p>Beyond sweets, brown sugar works in savoury glazes for meats like chicken or salmon. A 250g quantity can make a delicious marinade or rub. The air fryer’s rapid heat caramelises the sugar beautifully. For savoury ideas, browse our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipes</a>. Whether baking or glazing, 250g of brown sugar is a versatile ingredient.</p>  

<h3>Tips for Storing Brown Sugar After Measuring</h3>  
<p>After measuring 250g of brown sugar, store it in an airtight container to prevent hardening. If it dries out, add a slice of bread to restore moisture. Keeping brown sugar fresh ensures consistent results in air fryer recipes.

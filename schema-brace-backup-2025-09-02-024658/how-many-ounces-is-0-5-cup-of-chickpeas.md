<p>0.5 cup of chickpeas equals approximately 3.5 ounces (or 100 grams). This measurement is handy for air fryer recipes, ensuring you get the perfect portion every time. Whether you're making crispy chickpeas or adding them to a dish, knowing this conversion helps streamline your cooking process.</p>

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>
<p>Precision is key when using an air fryer, as overcrowding or underfilling can affect cooking times and results. Chickpeas are a versatile ingredient, perfect for snacks, salads, or even <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a>. Measuring 0.5 cup of chickpeas correctly ensures even cooking and avoids waste. Plus, it helps you stick to portion control if you're meal prepping or following a specific diet.</p>

<p>Chickpeas are packed with protein and fibre, making them a healthy addition to your meals. Whether you're roasting them for a crunchy snack or blending them into hummus, knowing the weight in ounces helps you adjust recipes accurately. For more conversions, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>

<h2>How to measure 0.5 cup of chickpeas</h2>
<p>To measure 0.5 cup of chickpeas, use a dry measuring cup for consistency. Fill the cup halfway with chickpeas, levelling off the top with a straight edge. If you don't have a measuring cup, a kitchen scale is your best friend—simply weigh out 3.5 ounces (100 grams) for accuracy.</p>

<h3>Using canned vs. dried chickpeas</h3>
<p>Canned chickpeas are pre-cooked and ready to use, while dried chickpeas require soaking and cooking. If using canned, drain and rinse them before measuring. For dried chickpeas, cook them first, then measure 0.5 cup for your recipe. Both types work well in the air fryer, but canned chickpeas are quicker for snacks like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/snacks>air-fried crispy chickpeas</a>.</p>

<h2>Common recipes using 0.5 cup of chickpeas</h2>
<p>Half a cup of chickpeas is a versatile amount for many dishes. Try roasting them in the air fryer with spices for a crunchy snack, or blend them into hummus for dipping. They're also great in salads, stews, or even <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable-based air fryer recipes</a>.</p>

<p>For a quick meal, toss 0.5 cup of chickpeas with olive oil and your favourite seasonings, then air fry until crispy. This makes a protein-packed topping for soups or a standalone snack. If you're meal prepping, measure out portions in advance to save time during the week.</p>

<h3>Storing chickpeas for future use</h3>
<p>Cooked or canned chickpeas can be stored in the fridge for up to 5 days. For longer storage, freeze them in 0.5 cup portions (about 3.5 ounces) for easy use later. This way, you'll always have the right amount ready for your next air fryer creation.</p>

<h2>Tips for perfect air-fried chickpeas</h2>
<p>To get the crispiest chickpeas in your air fryer, pat them dry before cooking. Toss them with a bit of oil and spread them in a single layer to ensure even cooking. Shake the basket halfway through for uniform crispiness. For more cleaning tips, visit our guide on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>keeping your air fryer spotless</a>.</p>

<p>Experiment with seasonings like paprika, cumin, or garlic powder to customise your chickpeas. Whether you're using 0.5 cup or scaling up, accurate measurements help you achieve consistent results every time. Happy cooking!</p>

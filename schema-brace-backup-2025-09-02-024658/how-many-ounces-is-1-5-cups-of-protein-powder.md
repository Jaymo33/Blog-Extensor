<p>1.5 cups of protein powder equals approximately 12 ounces. This conversion is essential for accurately measuring ingredients, especially when preparing air fryer recipes or meal prep. Protein powder can vary slightly in density, but this measurement is a reliable standard for most brands.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Getting the right amount of protein powder ensures your recipes turn out perfectly. Whether you're making protein pancakes in your air fryer or adding it to smoothies, precision is key. Too much or too little can affect texture and taste. For more air fryer recipe ideas, check out <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>our collection</a>.</p>  

<p>Protein powder is often used in baking and cooking, so knowing how to convert cups to ounces is handy. If you're meal prepping, this accuracy helps maintain consistency. Visit <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>our conversion chart</a> for more measurement tips.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure Protein Powder Correctly</h3>  
<p>Use a kitchen scale for the most accurate results. Scooping directly from the bag can lead to inconsistencies. Fluff the powder first, then spoon it into a measuring cup. Level it off with a knife for precision.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for 1.5 Cups of Protein Powder</h2>  
<p>This amount is perfect for batch cooking or making larger portions. You might use it for protein bars, muffins, or even air fryer-friendly desserts. Explore <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert recipes</a> for inspiration.</p>  

<p>Protein powder can also be added to oatmeal or yoghurt for a boost. If you're into fitness, precise measurements help track macros. For cleaning tips, see <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>our guide</a>.</p>  

<h3>Adjusting Recipes for Different Brands</h3>  
<p>Some protein powders are denser than others. If yours feels heavier, reduce the amount slightly. Lighter powders may need a bit more. Always check the label for specific weight recommendations.</p>  

<h2>Converting Other Measurements</h2>  
<p>If you need smaller or larger amounts, the same principles apply. For example, 1 cup of protein powder is roughly 8 ounces. Half a cup would be about 4 ounces. Keep these conversions handy for quick reference.</p>

<p>135 ml of milk equals approximately 0.57 cups (just over half a cup). This conversion is handy for recipes, especially when using an air fryer, where precise measurements can make all the difference. Whether you're whipping up a cake or a creamy sauce, knowing how to convert 135 ml of milk to cups ensures your dish turns out perfectly.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>
<p>When using an air fryer, precise measurements like 135 ml of milk in cups can affect texture and cooking time. Too much liquid can lead to soggy results, while too little might dry out your dish. For example, if you're making air fryer pancakes or a batter-based recipe, getting the 135 ml to cups conversion right ensures fluffy, even results.</p>
<p>Many air fryer recipes, like those on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, rely on balanced wet and dry ingredients. A slight miscalculation with 135 ml of milk could throw off the entire dish. That’s why understanding conversions like 135 ml milk to cups is so important for consistent, delicious outcomes.</p>

<h2>How to Measure 135 ml of Milk Without a Measuring Cup</h2>
<p>If you don’t have a measuring cup handy, you can still measure 135 ml of milk using everyday items. A standard UK tablespoon holds about 15 ml, so 9 tablespoons will give you roughly 135 ml. Alternatively, a small teacup typically holds around 150 ml, so filling it just under the brim will get you close.</p>
<p>For baking or air fryer recipes, precision matters, so investing in a good measuring jug is worthwhile. Check out <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>our conversion chart</a> for more handy measurement tips to make cooking easier.</p>

<h3>US vs. UK Cup Measurements</h3>
<p>It’s worth noting that a US cup is 240 ml, while a UK cup is 250 ml. For 135 ml of milk, the difference is minimal—about 0.56 US cups vs. 0.54 UK cups. Most recipes won’t be affected by this tiny variance, but for baking, it’s good to know which standard your recipe follows.</p>

<h2>Common Recipes Using 135 ml of Milk</h2>
<p>Many air fryer recipes call for around 135 ml of milk, such as custards, batters, or creamy sauces. For example, a simple air fryer pancake recipe might use 135 ml of milk to create a light, fluffy texture. You can find inspiration in our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/breakfast>breakfast category</a> for more ideas.</p>
<p>Another great use for 135 ml of milk is in air fryer cakes or muffins. The liquid helps bind ingredients while keeping them moist. If you’re experimenting, remember that 135 ml converts to just over half a cup, making it easy to adjust recipes on the fly.</p>

<h3>Scaling Recipes Up or Down</h3>
<p>If a recipe calls for 270 ml of milk (about 1.14 cups), you can halve it to 135 ml for a smaller batch. This flexibility is perfect for air fryer cooking, where portion control is often key. Just remember that cooking times may need slight adjustments when scaling.</p>

<h2>Tips for Measuring Milk in Air Fryer Recipes</h2>
<p>When measuring 135 ml of milk for air fryer recipes, use a clear measuring jug at eye level for accuracy. If your recipe requires warmed milk, measure it cold first, then heat it to avoid evaporation errors. For sticky ingredients like condensed milk, lightly grease the measuring cup for easy pouring.</p>

    "@type": "Answer",
    "text": "Always seal opened marmalade jars tightly and refrigerate. The high sugar content helps preserve it, but refrigeration maintains quality. If you frequently use 0.33 cup portions (2.93 ounces), consider pre-measuring into small containers for convenience in your air fryer cooking routine."

    "@type": "Answer",
    "text": "Yes, but adjust expectations for flavour and texture. Apricot jam (2.93 ounces/0.33 cup) works well in most air fryer recipes calling for marmalade. The conversion remains the same by volume, but sweeter preserves may require reducing other sugars in your recipe. Always consider the flavour profile you want to achieve."

<p>Many UK cooks prefer weighing ingredients like marmalade for consistency. Ounces provide a more accurate measure than cups, especially for sticky substances. If you’re adapting a recipe from cups to ounces, our 0.33 cup marmalade to ounces conversion takes the guesswork out of your cooking.</p>

<h3>How to measure 0.33 cup of marmalade accurately</h3>
<p>Use a liquid measuring cup for sticky marmalade, and lightly grease it first for easy release. Fill to just below the 1/3 cup mark (0.33 cup) for the most precise measurement.

<p>1.25 cups of sesame seeds equals approximately 5.3 ounces. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements ensure perfect results. Whether you're making sesame-crusted chicken or toasted sesame snacks, knowing the exact weight helps avoid under or over-seasoning.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on even heat distribution, so ingredient quantities must be spot-on. Too many sesame seeds can lead to uneven cooking, while too few might leave your dish lacking flavour. For example, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>sesame-crusted salmon recipe</a> calls for precise amounts to achieve that perfect crunch. Always measure ingredients like sesame seeds by weight for consistency.</p>  

<p>If you're new to air fryer cooking, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for other common measurements. It’s a lifesaver when adapting traditional recipes for your air fryer. Whether you're cooking vegetables or proteins, accurate conversions make all the difference.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure Sesame Seeds Correctly</h3>  
<p>For the most accurate results, use a kitchen scale to weigh sesame seeds. Scooping them directly from the bag can lead to inconsistencies due to settling. Lightly spoon the seeds into a measuring cup and level them off for volume measurements. This method ensures you get the right amount every time.</p>  

<h2>Converting Other Sesame Seed Quantities</h2>  
<p>Need to convert different amounts? Here’s a quick reference: 1 cup of sesame seeds equals about 4.25 ounces, while ½ cup is roughly 2.1 ounces. These conversions are handy for scaling recipes up or down. For more tips, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipes</a>, where sesame seeds often add a delicious crunch.</p>  

<p>If you’re working with larger quantities, remember that 2 cups of sesame seeds weigh around 8.5 ounces. This is useful for batch cooking or meal prep. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/meal-prep>meal prep guide</a> includes plenty of ideas for using sesame seeds in advance cooking.</p>  

<h3>Common Uses for Sesame Seeds in Air Fryer Recipes</h3>  
<p>Sesame seeds are a versatile ingredient, perfect for coating proteins like chicken or tofu. They also add texture to air-fried vegetables or homemade crackers. Try sprinkling them over <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>air-fried veggies</a> for an extra nutty flavour. Just remember to measure carefully for the best results.</p>

<p>4 tablespoons (tbsp) of tahini equals approximately 60 grams (g). This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements ensure the best texture and flavour. Whether you're making dips, dressings, or marinades, knowing how to convert 4 tbsp tahini to grams helps you follow recipes accurately.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Using the correct amount of tahini ensures your air fryer dishes turn out perfectly. Too much tahini can make sauces overly thick, while too little might leave them lacking flavour. For recipes like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer falafel</a> or tahini-glazed vegetables, 60 grams of tahini per 4 tbsp is the ideal measurement.</p>  

<p>Many UK recipes use grams for consistency, so converting 4 tbsp of tahini into grams simplifies cooking. If you're using a digital scale, 60 grams is easy to measure, eliminating guesswork. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for other common ingredient conversions.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure Tahini Without a Scale</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a scale, use a standard UK tablespoon to measure tahini. Fill it level for accuracy, scraping off any excess. Remember, tahini’s thick consistency means it can vary slightly, so 4 tbsp tahini in grams might be between 58-62 grams depending on density.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for Tahini in Air Fryer Recipes</h2>  
<p>Tahini adds richness to many dishes, from marinades to dips. Try it in <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>air fryer chicken recipes</a> for a nutty depth of flavour. Since 4 tbsp of tahini equals 60 grams, you can adjust quantities easily for larger batches.</p>  

<p>Another great use is in dressings for air-fried vegetables. A mix of tahini, lemon, and garlic makes a creamy topping for roasted cauliflower or sweet potatoes. For more inspiration, browse our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a> at airfryerrecipe.co.uk.</p>  

<h3>Does Brand Affect the Weight of Tahini?</h3>  
<p>Different brands may have slight variations in texture, but 4 tbsp tahini to grams remains roughly 60g. Opt for well-stirred tahini to ensure consistency. If separation occurs, mix thoroughly before measuring for the most accurate results.</p>  

<h2>Converting Other Tahini Measurements</h2>  
<p>Need smaller or larger amounts? Here’s a quick guide: 1 tbsp tahini = 15g, 2 tbsp = 30g, and 8 tbsp = 120g. These conversions help scale recipes up or down while keeping flavours balanced.

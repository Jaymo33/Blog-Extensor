<p>0.5 cups of coconut oil equals approximately 118 ml. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes, where precise measurements can make or break your dish. Whether you're baking, frying, or roasting, knowing the exact ml equivalent ensures consistent results. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we provide accurate conversions to help you cook with confidence.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Using the correct amount of coconut oil in your air fryer ensures even cooking and prevents dryness or sogginess. Too little oil can leave food sticking to the basket, while too much may make it greasy. For recipes like crispy vegetables or golden chicken, 0.5 cups of coconut oil (118 ml) is often the perfect balance. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more handy measurement tips.</p>  

<p>Different brands of coconut oil may vary slightly in density, but 118 ml is a reliable standard. If you're working with solid coconut oil, gently melt it before measuring for accuracy. This small step can make a big difference in dishes like air-fried sweet potato fries or coconut shrimp.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure 0.5 Cups of Coconut Oil Correctly</h3>  
<p>For liquid coconut oil, use a clear measuring jug with ml markings for precision. If your oil is solid, spoon it into a measuring cup and level it off with a knife. Melt it down if your recipe requires liquid oil. For more air fryer tips, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a>.</p>

<p>75g of chopped onion equals approximately 2.65 ounces. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements can make all the difference. Whether you're following a British recipe or adjusting quantities, knowing how to convert grams to ounces ensures your dish turns out perfectly. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we understand the importance of accuracy, especially when working with ingredients like onions, which can vary in density.</p>

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on even cooking, and incorrect measurements can lead to uneven results. Chopped onion, for example, can pack differently depending on how finely it's diced. Using 75g of chopped onion (2.65 ounces) ensures consistency in recipes like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable stir-fries</a> or caramelised onion toppings. A digital kitchen scale is the best tool for this, but if you're in a pinch, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a> can help.</p>  

<p>For those who prefer volume measurements, 75g of chopped onion roughly fills a ½-cup measure. However, weight is always more reliable, especially when scaling recipes up or down. If you're preparing a larger batch, simply multiply the conversion—150g of chopped onion would be about 5.3 ounces. This precision is particularly useful for meal prepping or baking, where ratios are critical.</p>  

<h3>How to measure 75g of chopped onion without a scale</h3>  
<p>If you don't have a scale, use the spoon-and-level method for chopped onion. Lightly fill a measuring cup with the onion, then level it off with a knife. Avoid packing it down, as this can lead to an inaccurate measurement. For 75g (2.65 ounces), aim for a loosely filled ½-cup measure. Keep in mind that this method is less precise, so investing in a small digital scale is worthwhile for frequent air fryer users.</p>  

<h2>Common recipes using 75g of chopped onion</h2>  
<p>Many air fryer recipes call for 75g of chopped onion, from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>savoury frittatas</a> to homemade onion rings. This quantity is ideal for adding flavour without overpowering the dish. For example, a single-serving air fryer quiche might use 75g of onion for a balanced taste. If you're doubling the recipe, remember that 150g converts to 5.3 ounces.</p>  

<p>Onions are a staple in British cooking, and their weight can affect cooking times in the air fryer. Finely chopped 75g onions will cook faster than roughly diced ones, so adjust your timings accordingly. For caramelised onions, spread 75g evenly in the air fryer basket to ensure even browning. Check out our guide on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning your air fryer</a> after cooking pungent ingredients like onions.</p>  

<h3>Tips for storing chopped onion</h3>  
<p>If you've prepped 75g of chopped onion but only need half, store the rest in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 3 days. For longer storage, freeze the onion in a labelled bag with the weight (75g/2.65 ounces) for future use. Frozen onions can go straight into the air fryer—just add a minute or two to the cooking time.</p>

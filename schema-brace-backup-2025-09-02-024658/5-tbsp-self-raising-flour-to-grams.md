<p>5 tablespoons of self-raising flour equals approximately 45 grams. This conversion is essential for precise baking, especially when using an air fryer where measurements can make or break a recipe. Whether you're whipping up cakes, muffins, or savoury dishes, knowing the exact weight ensures consistency. For more air fryer-friendly recipes, check out <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate flour measurements matter</h2>  
<p>Baking is a science, and even small deviations in flour quantities can affect texture and rise. Self-raising flour contains baking powder, so incorrect measurements may lead to dense or overly puffed results. In air fryer cooking, where heat distribution is rapid, precision is even more critical. Too much flour can dry out your dish, while too little may cause it to collapse. For foolproof conversions, refer to our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>  

<p>Many UK bakers rely on tablespoons for small quantities, but grams offer better accuracy. Digital scales eliminate the variability of scooping techniques, ensuring your air fryer cakes turn out light and fluffy every time. If you're new to air fryer baking, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>cake recipes</a> for inspiration.</p>  

<h3>How to measure 5 tbsp of self-raising flour</h3>  
<p>For consistent results, spoon the flour into the tablespoon and level it off with a knife. Avoid packing or tapping the spoon, as this compacts the flour and skews the weight. If using scales, tare the bowl first, then add flour until it reaches 45 grams. This method works perfectly for air fryer recipes like scones or batter-based dishes.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for 5 tbsp of self-raising flour</h2>  
<p>This quantity is ideal for small-batch baking, such as single-serving mug cakes or coating proteins like chicken or fish. In air fryers, a light dusting of flour helps achieve crispy textures without deep frying. Try it in our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>air fryer chicken recipes</a> for golden, crunchy results.</p>  

<p>Self-raising flour also works wonders in quick breads and dumplings. Combined with wet ingredients, 45 grams provides just enough structure while keeping things tender.

<h3>Converting other flour quantities</h3>  
<p>If your recipe calls for more or less flour, here's a handy reference: 1 tbsp equals about 9 grams, while a cup (16 tbsp) is roughly 144 grams. These conversions ensure seamless adjustments whether you're scaling up or down.

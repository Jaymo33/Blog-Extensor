<p>360 ml of almond milk equals approximately 1.52 cups. This conversion is essential for anyone using almond milk in recipes, especially when baking or cooking with an air fryer. Whether you're whipping up a cake or preparing a creamy sauce, knowing the exact measurement ensures perfect results every time.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter</h2>
<p>Using the right amount of almond milk can make or break your recipe. Too little, and your dish might turn out dry; too much, and it could become soggy. Precision is key, especially when working with air fryers, where even small deviations can affect cooking times and textures.</p>
<p>For those who love experimenting in the kitchen, a reliable conversion chart is a must. You can find a handy <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> on our site to help with other common measurements. This takes the guesswork out of adapting recipes for your air fryer.</p>

<h2>How to Measure 360 ml of Almond Milk</h2>
<p>Measuring liquids like almond milk can be tricky if you don’t have a metric measuring jug. A standard US cup holds 240 ml, so 360 ml is roughly 1.5 cups. If you're in the UK, where a cup is 250 ml, 360 ml converts to about 1.44 cups.</p>
<p>For best results, use a liquid measuring cup with clear markings. Pour the almond milk to the desired level, checking at eye level to avoid over- or under-pouring. This method ensures consistency, whether you're making a <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>cake</a> or a savoury dish.</p>

<h3>Using Almond Milk in Air Fryer Recipes</h3>
<p>Almond milk is a versatile ingredient in air fryer cooking. It works well in batters, marinades, and even as a base for sauces. When converting 360 ml of almond milk to cups, remember that slight variations won’t ruin your dish, but precision helps achieve the best texture.</p>

<h2>Common Recipes Using 360 ml of Almond Milk</h2>
<p>Many recipes call for around 360 ml of almond milk, such as pancakes, muffins, or creamy pasta sauces. If you're making a <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/breakfast>breakfast</a> dish like overnight oats, this measurement ensures the right consistency.</p>
<p>For those who enjoy baking, 360 ml of almond milk is often used in vegan or dairy-free cakes. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipes</a> section for inspiration on how to incorporate this measurement into your cooking.</p>

<h3>Tips for Storing Almond Milk</h3>
<p>Once opened, almond milk should be refrigerated and used within 7–10 days. Shake well before measuring, as separation can occur. This ensures accurate measurements when converting 360 ml of almond milk to cups for your recipes.</p>

<h2>Converting Other Almond Milk Measurements</h2>
<p>If your recipe calls for a different amount, you can use the same method to convert ml to cups. For example, 180 ml is about 0.76 cups, while 500 ml is roughly 2.11 cups. Keeping a conversion chart handy saves time and reduces errors.</p>

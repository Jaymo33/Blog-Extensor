    "text": "You can substitute almond flour, but note that 0.125 cup of almond flour weighs slightly more (about 1.25 ounces). Almond flour browns faster in air fryers, so you may need to reduce cooking time or temperature when using it instead of rice flour."

For more air fryer conversions, visit our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on even heat distribution, so precise measurements like 0.125 cup of rice flour to ounces can make or break a recipe. Too much flour can lead to dense, gummy textures, while too little might not provide enough structure. Rice flour, in particular, behaves differently than wheat flour, so getting the 0.125 cup to ounce conversion right is crucial. Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> for dishes that use rice flour perfectly.</p>  

<p>Many UK cooks prefer weighing ingredients like rice flour for accuracy. A kitchen scale can help verify that 0.125 cup of rice flour is indeed 1 ounce. This method eliminates guesswork and ensures your air fryer creations turn out perfectly every time. If you’re new to air frying, check out our guide on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>keeping your air fryer clean</a> for hassle-free cooking.</p>  

<h3>How to measure 0.125 cup of rice flour without scales</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a scale, spoon the rice flour into a measuring cup designed for dry ingredients. Level it off with a straight edge to ensure an accurate 0.125 cup measurement. Remember, packed flour will weigh more, so fluff it up first for the correct ounce equivalent. For more baking tips, browse our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>cake recipes</a> that use rice flour.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for 0.125 cup of rice flour in air fryers</h2>  
<p>This small but precise amount of rice flour—0.125 cup or 1 ounce—is perfect for light coatings on chicken or fish in the air fryer. It creates a delicate crispness without heaviness. Rice flour’s fine texture also works well in batters for tempura-style vegetables, giving them that signature airy crunch. Discover more <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable recipes</a> that benefit from rice flour coatings.</p>  

<p>Another great use for 0.125 cup of rice flour is in gluten-free baking mixes for air fryer cakes or cookies. The 1-ounce measurement helps maintain the right balance with other flours in blends. Rice flour’s neutral taste won’t overpower other ingredients, making it versatile for both sweet and savoury dishes in your air fryer.</p>  

<h3>Storing rice flour for consistent measurements</h3>  
<p>Keep rice flour in an airtight container to prevent moisture absorption, which can affect the weight of your 0.125 cup measurement. Humidity can make flour compact, meaning you’d get more than 1 ounce in your 0.125 cup scoop. For best results, store it in a cool, dry place and give it a stir before measuring.</p>

<p>15g of soy sauce equals approximately 0.53 ounces. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements can make or break a dish. Whether you’re marinating chicken or whipping up a stir-fry, knowing how to convert grams to ounces ensures your flavours are spot-on. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we love helping home cooks nail these details for perfect results every time.</p>  

<h2>Why Convert 15g of Soy Sauce to Ounces?</h2>  
<p>Many air fryer recipes, especially those from the US, use ounces rather than grams. If you’re working with a recipe that calls for 15g of soy sauce but your measuring tools are in ounces, this conversion is a lifesaver. Precision matters in cooking, and even small discrepancies can alter the taste of your dish. For more handy conversions, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>  

<p>Soy sauce is a staple in many air fryer recipes, from glazes to marinades. Whether you’re cooking tofu, chicken, or vegetables, getting the measurement right ensures balanced flavours. A little too much soy sauce can overpower a dish, while too little might leave it tasting bland. That’s why converting 15g of soy sauce to ounces (0.53 oz) is so useful.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure 15g of Soy Sauce Without Scales</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a kitchen scale, you can still measure 15g of soy sauce using tablespoons. One tablespoon of soy sauce is roughly 15g or 0.53 ounces. This makes it easy to measure even without specialised tools. Just remember that different brands of soy sauce may vary slightly in density, so this method is best for rough estimates.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for 15g of Soy Sauce in Air Fryer Recipes</h2>  
<p>15g of soy sauce is a versatile amount, perfect for marinating proteins or adding depth to vegetable dishes. Try it in our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer chicken recipes</a>, where it adds a rich umami flavour. You could also use it to glaze salmon or tofu before air frying for a delicious caramelised finish.</p>  

<p>Another great use for 15g of soy sauce is in stir-fry sauces. Combine it with garlic, ginger, and a touch of honey for a quick glaze. This small amount packs a punch, so a little goes a long way. For more inspiration, browse our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipe category</a>, where soy sauce is a key ingredient in many dishes.</p>  

<h3>Does Soy Sauce Brand Affect the Weight?</h3>  
<p>While most soy sauces have a similar density, some premium or low-sodium versions may differ slightly. However, for most home cooking purposes, 15g of soy sauce will still be close to 0.53 ounces regardless of brand. If you’re using a particularly thick or thin soy sauce, adjust slightly to taste.</p>  

<h2>Tips for Storing and Using Soy Sauce in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>To keep your soy sauce fresh, store it in a cool, dark place. Once opened, refrigeration can help maintain its flavour. When measuring 15g for air fryer recipes, always use a clean spoon to avoid contamination. For sticky residues, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner guide</a> has handy tips.</p>  

<p>Soy sauce can also be used to deglaze your air fryer basket after cooking. A small amount mixed with water helps lift stuck-on bits without harsh scrubbing. Just remember to rinse thoroughly afterwards to prevent salt buildup. This trick works wonders for keeping your air fryer in top condition.</p>

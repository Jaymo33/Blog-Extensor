<p>1.5 cups of maple syrup equals approximately 12 ounces (340 grams) in UK measurements. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes, where precise measurements can make or break a dish. Whether you're glazing salmon or sweetening desserts, knowing the exact weight ensures consistency. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we focus on accuracy to help you achieve perfect results every time.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate maple syrup measurements matter</h2>  
<p>Maple syrup is denser than water, so volume-to-weight conversions aren’t straightforward. Using 1.5 cups of maple syrup in ounces ensures your air fryer recipes aren’t too sweet or too bland. For example, a sticky glaze for <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/salmon>salmon</a> requires the right balance. Too much syrup can cause burning, while too little may lack flavour. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a> simplifies this process.</p>  

<p>Air fryers circulate hot air, so sticky ingredients like maple syrup need careful measurement. A 12-ounce (1.5 cups) quantity works well for marinades or drizzles. If you’re baking <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>desserts</a>, this measurement ensures even caramelisation. Always use a kitchen scale for precision, especially when adapting recipes from cups to ounces.</p>  

<h3>Converting 1.5 cups of maple syrup to ounces</h3>  
<p>One US cup of maple syrup weighs roughly 8 ounces, so 1.5 cups equal 12 ounces. In the UK, this translates to 340 grams. For air fryer cooking, this measurement is ideal for sauces or glazes. If you’re unsure, refer to our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a> for tried-and-tested quantities.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for 1.5 cups of maple syrup</h2>  
<p>This amount is perfect for coating <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken wings</a> or roasting vegetables. The syrup’s thickness ensures even coverage in the air fryer basket. You can also mix it with mustard or soy sauce for a balanced marinade. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we recommend preheating the air fryer to prevent sticking.</p>  

<p>For desserts, 12 ounces of maple syrup sweetens cakes or cookies without overpowering. Drizzle it over air-fried apples or pears for a quick treat. Remember to clean your air fryer after using sticky ingredients—check our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning guide</a> for tips.</p>  

<h3>Tips for measuring maple syrup</h3>  
<p>Use a liquid measuring cup for accuracy, and level off the top with a knife. For sticky syrups, lightly grease the cup first. If scaling recipes, note that 1.5 cups of maple syrup to ounces stays consistent—adjust other ingredients proportionally.</p>

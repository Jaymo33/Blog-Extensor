<p>335 ml of buttermilk is approximately 1.42 cups in the US or 1.18 cups in the UK. This conversion is essential for baking, especially when using an air fryer for recipes like cakes or fried chicken. Precise measurements ensure your dishes turn out perfectly every time. Whether you're following a recipe from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes</a> or improvising, knowing how to convert ml to cups is a game-changer.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Buttermilk Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Buttermilk plays a crucial role in baking, adding moisture and a slight tang to recipes. Using 335 ml of buttermilk instead of the correct cup measurement can throw off the texture of your dish. For air fryer recipes, consistency is key—whether you're making fluffy pancakes or crispy chicken. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air-fryer-conversion-chart</a> for more handy measurement tips. Accurate conversions ensure your air fryer creations are always spot-on.</p>  

<p>In the UK, cup measurements differ slightly from the US, so it's important to know which system your recipe uses. For 335 ml of buttermilk, UK bakers will need roughly 1.18 cups, while US bakers use 1.42 cups. This small difference can impact recipes, especially when scaling up or down. Always double-check your conversions to avoid kitchen mishaps.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure 335 ml of Buttermilk Without a Scale</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a measuring jug with ml markings, you can still measure 335 ml of buttermilk using cups. In the US, fill a cup to just under 1 and a half cups (1.42 cups). In the UK, use 1 cup plus 2 tablespoons for accuracy. For air fryer recipes like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>air fryer cakes</a>, precision ensures even cooking and perfect texture.</p>  

<h2>Common Recipes Using 335 ml of Buttermilk</h2>  
<p>Many air fryer recipes call for buttermilk, especially for marinades or batters. Fried chicken, scones, and pancakes often use around 335 ml of buttermilk. If you're exploring new dishes, visit <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> for inspiration. Converting ml to cups correctly ensures your recipes turn out as intended.</p>  

<p>Buttermilk is also great for tenderising meats in the air fryer. A marinade with 335 ml of buttermilk (1.42 US cups) can make chicken or pork incredibly juicy. For cleaning tips after cooking, check out <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air-fryer-cleaner</a>. Proper measurements and maintenance keep your air fryer in top shape.</p>  

<h3>UK vs. US Cup Measurements for Buttermilk</h3>  
<p>The difference between UK and US cups means 335 ml of buttermilk isn’t the same in both systems. US cups are larger (240 ml per cup), while UK cups are 284 ml. Always confirm which measurement system your recipe uses to avoid errors. This is especially important for air fryer baking, where precision affects cooking times.</p>

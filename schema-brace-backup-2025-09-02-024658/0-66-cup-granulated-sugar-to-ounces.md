<p>0.66 cup of granulated sugar equals approximately 5.28 ounces (oz). This conversion is essential for precise baking, especially when using an air fryer where measurements can impact cooking times and textures. Whether you're making cakes, cookies, or desserts, knowing the exact weight ensures consistent results.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Sugar Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Granulated sugar is a staple in many recipes, from air fryer cakes to cookies. Measuring it correctly ensures your baked goods have the right sweetness and texture. Too much sugar can make desserts overly sweet or cause them to brown too quickly in the air fryer. Too little, and your treats may turn out dry or bland. That’s why converting 0.66 cup of granulated sugar to ounces (5.28 oz) is so helpful.</p>  

<p>If you're using an air fryer, precise measurements are even more critical. Air fryers cook food faster than conventional ovens, so imbalances in sugar can lead to uneven browning or burning. For perfect results, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for other common ingredient conversions.</p>  

<h2>How to Measure 0.66 Cup of Granulated Sugar</h2>  
<p>Measuring 0.66 cup of granulated sugar can be tricky if you don’t have a measuring cup with precise markings. One easy method is to use a digital kitchen scale. Simply set your scale to ounces, tare it to zero, and pour the sugar until it reads 5.28 oz. This method eliminates guesswork and ensures accuracy.</p>  

<p>If you don’t have a scale, you can use the spoon-and-level technique. Fill your measuring cup with granulated sugar using a spoon, then level it off with a straight edge. For 0.66 cup, measure two-thirds of a standard cup—just be mindful that slight variations can occur due to packing. For more baking tips, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> collection.</p>  

<h3>UK vs. US Measurements</h3>  
<p>In the UK, cup measurements can differ slightly from US standards due to varying cup sizes. However, granulated sugar’s weight remains consistent—1 cup equals approximately 8 ounces. This means 0.66 cup of granulated sugar is still roughly 5.28 oz in both regions. Always double-check if using a UK-specific recipe to avoid discrepancies.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for 0.66 Cup of Granulated Sugar</h2>  
<p>This measurement often appears in smaller-batch recipes, such as air fryer cookies or single-serving desserts. For example, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cookies>cookie recipes</a> sometimes call for 0.66 cup to balance sweetness without overwhelming the dough. It’s also useful for glazes, syrups, or sweetening homemade air fryer granola.</p>  

<p>If you’re scaling a recipe up or down, knowing that 0.66 cup equals 5.28 oz helps maintain consistency. Whether you’re baking or making air fryer caramel, precise sugar measurements ensure perfect results every time.

<h3>Storing Granulated Sugar for Air Fryer Use</h3>  
<p>Keep granulated sugar in an airtight container to prevent clumping, especially in humid kitchens. Proper storage ensures accurate measurements when you’re ready to bake. If your sugar has hardened, break it up with a fork before measuring 0.66 cup (5.28 oz) for your recipe.</p>

<p>3 cups of chia seeds weigh approximately 12 ounces (340 grams) in UK measurements. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes, ensuring accurate portioning for everything from breakfast puddings to healthy snacks. Whether you're meal prepping or experimenting with new dishes, knowing the exact weight helps achieve consistent results.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter for Chia Seeds</h2>  
<p>Chia seeds are a powerhouse of nutrition, packed with fibre, protein, and omega-3s. Using the correct weight ensures your recipes turn out perfectly every time. Too many chia seeds can make dishes overly thick, while too few might leave them runny. For air fryer recipes, precision is key—whether you're making energy bars or coating chicken for a crispy finish.</p>  
<p>If you're new to cooking with chia seeds, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for other common ingredient measurements. It’s a handy tool for quick reference, especially when adapting recipes for your air fryer.</p>  

<h2>How to Measure 3 Cups of Chia Seeds Correctly</h2>  
<p>Measuring chia seeds by volume can be tricky due to their small size. For the most accurate results, use a kitchen scale to weigh out 12 ounces (340 grams). If you don’t have a scale, lightly spoon the seeds into a measuring cup without packing them down. This prevents over-measuring and ensures consistency.</p>  
<p>Chia seeds are versatile and work well in both sweet and savoury dishes. Try adding them to <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/breakfast>breakfast recipes</a> like overnight oats or air-fried granola bars. Their neutral flavour makes them a great addition to almost any meal.</p>  

<h3>Common Uses for 3 Cups of Chia Seeds</h3>  
<p>Three cups of chia seeds go a long way in meal prep. You can make chia puddings, energy balls, or even use them as a binding agent in veggie burgers. In the air fryer, they’re perfect for creating crunchy coatings or adding texture to baked goods. Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a> for inspiration.</p>  

<h2>Converting Chia Seeds Between Cups and Ounces</h2>  
<p>If you need smaller or larger quantities, remember that 1 cup of chia seeds equals roughly 4 ounces (113 grams). This makes scaling recipes up or down simple. For example, 1.5 cups would be 6 ounces, while 6 cups would be 24 ounces. Always double-check conversions to avoid mistakes.</p>  
<p>Storing chia seeds properly ensures they stay fresh. Keep them in an airtight container in a cool, dark place. For longer shelf life, refrigerate them—this also helps maintain their nutritional value. If you’re unsure about storage, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning and maintenance guide</a> includes tips for keeping your kitchen staples fresh.</p>  

<h3>Tips for Cooking with Chia Seeds in an Air Fryer</h3>  
<p>Chia seeds can burn easily due to their high oil content. When using them in air fryer recipes, keep temperatures moderate (around 160°C) and check frequently. They work best as part of a mix, such as in coatings or mixed into doughs. For crispy results, lightly spray with oil before air frying.</p>

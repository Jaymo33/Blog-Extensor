<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of rapeseed oil in your air fryer ensures even cooking and prevents dryness or sogginess.

<h3>How to Measure 40g of Rapeseed Oil Without Scales</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a kitchen scale, you can still measure 40g of rapeseed oil using tablespoons. One tablespoon of rapeseed oil weighs roughly 14g, so 40g is just under 3 tablespoons. This method isn’t as precise as weighing but works in a pinch. For best results, invest in a digital scale to ensure accuracy, especially for baking recipes where precision is key.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for 40g of Rapeseed Oil in Air Fryer Recipes</h2>  
<p>40g of rapeseed oil (1.41 ounces) is often used in air fryer recipes for coating vegetables, marinating meats, or making crispy coatings. For example, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/potatoes>potato recipes</a> often call for this amount to achieve golden, crunchy results. The oil helps distribute heat evenly, ensuring your food cooks perfectly without excess grease.</p>  

<p>Another great use for 40g of rapeseed oil is in air fryer baking. Cakes and muffins benefit from the moisture and lightness that rapeseed oil provides. If you’re exploring <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>cake recipes</a>, this measurement ensures your batter has the right consistency. Remember, accurate conversions like 40g to 1.41 ounces make all the difference in baking.</p>  

<h3>Storing Rapeseed Oil for Optimal Freshness</h3>

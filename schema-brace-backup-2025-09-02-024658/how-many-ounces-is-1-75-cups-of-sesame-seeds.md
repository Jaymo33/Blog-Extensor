<p>1.75 cups of sesame seeds equals approximately 7.4 ounces (oz) in weight. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precision matters, ensuring your dishes turn out perfectly every time. Whether you're making sesame-crusted chicken or a nutty dessert, knowing the exact weight helps avoid over or under-seasoning. For more air fryer measurement tips, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of sesame seeds can make or break your dish. Too little, and you miss out on that rich, nutty flavour; too much, and it can overpower other ingredients. Air fryers rely on even distribution for consistent cooking, so measuring correctly ensures everything crisps up beautifully. If you're new to air frying, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a> has plenty of inspiration to get you started.</p>  

<p>Many home cooks assume volume measurements (like cups) are interchangeable with weight (like ounces), but density plays a big role. Sesame seeds are small and dense, so 1.75 cups weigh more than you might expect. Always use a kitchen scale for the most accurate results, especially when following air fryer recipes.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure Sesame Seeds Correctly</h3>  
<p>For the most precise conversion from cups to ounces, spoon the sesame seeds into your measuring cup rather than scooping. Scooping can compact them, leading to an inaccurate measurement. Level off the top with a straight edge for consistency. If you're scaling up a recipe, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion guide</a> can help adjust quantities effortlessly.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for Sesame Seeds in Air Fryer Recipes</h2>  
<p>Sesame seeds add crunch and flavour to countless air fryer dishes. Try them in crispy tofu, crusted salmon, or even sprinkled over roasted vegetables. Their high oil content means they toast beautifully in the air fryer, releasing a rich aroma. For more ideas, browse our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/tofu>tofu recipes</a> or <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable dishes</a>.</p>  

<p>Storing sesame seeds properly ensures they stay fresh for future recipes. Keep them in an airtight container in a cool, dark place to prevent rancidity. If you use them frequently, buying in bulk and freezing portions can save money without sacrificing quality.</p>  

<h3>Converting Other Sesame Seed Measurements</h3>  
<p>If your recipe calls for tablespoons or grams instead of cups, don’t worry—conversions are straightforward. One tablespoon of sesame seeds weighs roughly 0.25 ounces, while 100 grams equals about 3.5 ounces.

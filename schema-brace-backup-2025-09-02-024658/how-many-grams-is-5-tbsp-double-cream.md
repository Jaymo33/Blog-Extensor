<p>5 tablespoons (tbsp) of double cream equals approximately 75 grams (g). This conversion is essential for precise baking and cooking, especially when using an air fryer where measurements matter. Whether you're making a creamy sauce or a rich dessert, knowing the exact weight ensures perfect results every time.</p>  

<h2>Why converting tablespoons to grams matters</h2>  
<p>When cooking or baking, especially with air fryers, accuracy is key. Double cream’s density means volume measurements like tablespoons can vary slightly in weight. Converting 5 tbsp of double cream to grams (75g) ensures consistency, whether you're following a recipe from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> or improvising. This precision helps avoid overly rich or thin textures in dishes like custards or cakes.</p>  

<p>Many UK recipes, particularly those for air fryers, list ingredients by weight for reliability. If you're adapting a recipe from volume to grams, this conversion is a lifesaver. For more handy measurement guides, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>  

<h3>How to measure double cream accurately</h3>  
<p>For the most precise 5 tbsp double cream to grams conversion, use a kitchen scale. Scoop the cream into a tablespoon, level it off, and weigh it. If you don’t have scales, remember that 1 tbsp of double cream is roughly 15g, so 5 tbsp equals 75g. This method works well for air fryer recipes like creamy pasta bakes or indulgent desserts.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for 5 tbsp of double cream</h2>  
<p>Double cream is a staple in British cooking, adding richness to both sweet and savoury dishes. In air fryer recipes, 75g (5 tbsp) of double cream can elevate mashed potatoes, thicken soups, or create luscious fillings for tarts. It’s also perfect for whipping into peaks for desserts like Eton mess or topping scones.</p>  

<p>If you’re exploring <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert recipes</a>, this measurement is handy for custards or no-bake cheesecakes. For savoury dishes, try adding it to a creamy mushroom sauce for chicken—just pop it in the air fryer for a quick, decadent meal.</p>  

<h3>Adjusting recipes with double cream</h3>  
<p>If a recipe calls for 5 tbsp of double cream but you’re watching calories, you can substitute half with Greek yogurt (37.5g) and half with cream. This keeps the texture while reducing fat. For vegan alternatives, coconut cream (75g) works well in most air fryer recipes, though the flavour will differ slightly.</p>  

<h2>Tips for storing double cream</h2>  
<p>Once opened, double cream lasts 3–4 days in the fridge. To avoid waste, measure out 5 tbsp (75g) portions and freeze them in airtight containers. Thaw in the fridge before use—though whipped cream won’t hold its shape after freezing, it’s fine for cooking. For more storage hacks, visit <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>.</p>  

<p>Always check for freshness before using double cream in air fryer recipes. If it smells sour or has lumps, discard it. Proper storage ensures your 5 tbsp (75g) measurements stay accurate and safe for every dish.</p>

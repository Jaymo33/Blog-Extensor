For most standard family-sized air fryers, 3.1 kg (or 6.83 pounds) of food is a very large quantity that will almost certainly require cooking in multiple batches. It's essential to check your appliance's manual for its maximum recommended weight capacity and always avoid overcrowding the basket to ensure hot air can circulate freely for crispy results."

Then, multiply the decimal part (0.834322) by 16 to get the ounces: 0.834322 x 16 = approximately 13.35 ounces. So, 3.1 kg is equal to 6 pounds and 13.35 ounces. For most cooking purposes, rounding to 6 pounds and 13 ounces is perfectly acceptable."

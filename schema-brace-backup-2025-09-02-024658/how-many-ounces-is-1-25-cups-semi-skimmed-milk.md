<p>1.25 cups of semi skimmed milk equals approximately 10.14 ounces (oz). This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements can make or break your dish. Whether you’re whipping up a cake or a creamy sauce, knowing the exact weight ensures consistent results every time.</p>

<h2>Why accurate milk measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>
<p>When using an air fryer, precise measurements are crucial because the cooking environment is more concentrated than a conventional oven. Too much or too little liquid can affect texture and cooking times. For example, adding 1.25 cups of semi skimmed milk (10.14 oz) to a batter ensures the right consistency for even air frying. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more handy measurements.</p>
<p>Semi skimmed milk is a popular choice for air fryer recipes due to its balanced fat content. It’s lighter than whole milk but still provides enough richness for dishes like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>air fryer cakes</a> or custards. Measuring 1.25 cups (10.14 oz) accurately ensures your recipes turn out perfectly every time.</p>

<h2>How to measure 1.25 cups of semi skimmed milk</h2>

<p>If you don’t have measuring cups, you can use a standard UK tablespoon. There are 16 tablespoons in a cup, so 1.25 cups would be 20 tablespoons of semi skimmed milk. However, weighing it (10.14 oz) is far more precise for air fryer cooking.</p>

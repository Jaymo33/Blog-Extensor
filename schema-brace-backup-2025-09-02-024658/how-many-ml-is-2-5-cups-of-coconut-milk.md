At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we specialise in helping you nail these measurements effortlessly. Let’s dive deeper into why this conversion matters and how to use it.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on even heat distribution, so ingredient proportions can make or break a dish.

Whether you’re meal-prepping or cooking for one, accurate measurements streamline the process. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a> for inspiration. A little maths goes a long way in air fryer success!</p>  

<h3>How to Measure Coconut Milk Correctly</h3>  
<p>For the most accurate 591.47 ml (2.5 cups) measurement, use a liquid measuring jug with clear ml markings. Stir the coconut milk well before pouring, as it often separates in the can. If your recipe requires thicker cream, skim it from the top before measuring. Need a reliable air fryer cleaner for sticky spills?

<p>This quantity is perfect for batch-cooking creamy sauces, like a vegan tikka masala or laksa. In the air fryer, it’s ideal for marinating tofu or chicken, infusing rich flavour without excess oil.

<h3>UK vs. US Cup Measurements: Does It Affect Coconut Milk?</h3>

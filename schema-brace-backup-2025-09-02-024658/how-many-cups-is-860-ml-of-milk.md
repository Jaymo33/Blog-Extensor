<p>860 ml of milk is approximately 3.63 cups when using standard US measurements. This conversion is handy for baking, cooking, or preparing air fryer recipes where precision matters. Whether you're whipping up a cake or a creamy sauce, knowing how to convert millilitres to cups ensures your dish turns out just right. For more air fryer conversions, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Getting the right amount of milk can make or break a recipe. Too much or too little can affect texture, flavour, and cooking time, especially in an air fryer where precision is key. Whether you're making a custard or a batter, 860 ml of milk converted to cups ensures consistency. If you're working with UK or US measurements, slight variations may apply, but 3.63 cups is a reliable benchmark. For more tips on perfecting your dishes, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a>.</p>  

<h3>US vs. UK Cup Measurements</h3>  
<p>While the US uses a standard cup measurement of 240 ml, the UK metric cup is slightly larger at 250 ml. This means 860 ml of milk in the UK would be roughly 3.44 cups. However, most recipes account for minor discrepancies, so 3.63 cups (US) works universally. If you're adapting a British recipe, double-check the measurements for the best results.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for 860 ml of Milk</h2>  
<p>From creamy pasta sauces to fluffy pancakes, 860 ml of milk is a versatile ingredient. In air fryer cooking, it's often used for batters, custards, or even marinating proteins. For example, soaking chicken in milk before air frying can yield tender, juicy results. If you're looking for inspiration, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipes</a> showcase creative ways to use milk.</p>  

<h3>Converting for Baking</h3>  
<p>Baking requires precision, and 860 ml of milk translates neatly into cups for cakes, breads, and desserts. If a recipe calls for millilitres but you only have measuring cups, this conversion saves time. Remember, air fryer baking often requires adjustments, so always preheat and monitor cooking times closely.</p>  

<h2>Tips for Measuring Milk</h2>  
<p>Use a liquid measuring cup for accuracy, and fill it to the desired line at eye level. For 860 ml of milk, you’ll need just over 3.5 cups. If you’re scaling a recipe, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a> simplifies the process. Keep your air fryer clean for optimal performance—check our guide on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaning</a>.</p>  

<h3>Substitutes for Milk</h3>  
<p>If you're out of milk, alternatives like almond, oat, or soy milk can work in most recipes. Just ensure they’re unsweetened and unflavoured for savoury dishes.

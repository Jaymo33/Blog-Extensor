<p>150 grams of granulated sugar equals approximately 0.75 cups (¾ cup) when measured using standard UK cup measurements. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes, where precise measurements can make or break your baked goods. Whether you’re making cakes, cookies, or desserts in your air fryer, knowing how to convert grams to cups ensures consistent results every time.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Sugar Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Baking</h2>
<p>Air fryers cook food faster and more evenly than traditional ovens, which means ingredient ratios are crucial. Too much or too little sugar can affect texture, browning, and even cooking times. For example, a <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>cake recipe</a> with 150 grams of granulated sugar converted incorrectly might turn out overly dense or dry. Using the correct 0.75 cups ensures your treats rise properly and caramelise just right.</p>
<p>Granulated sugar’s density can vary slightly based on how it’s packed, so we recommend spooning the sugar into the measuring cup and levelling it off for accuracy. If you’re adapting a recipe from grams to cups, bookmark our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for quick reference. This method is especially handy for popular air fryer desserts like brownies or <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cookies>cookies</a>, where sugar plays a key role in texture.</p>

<h3>UK vs. US Cup Measurements for Granulated Sugar</h3>
<p>While 150 grams of granulated sugar equals 0.75 cups in the UK, it’s roughly 0.7 cups in the US due to slight measurement standard differences. Always check where your recipe originates—our guide focuses on UK conversions for local bakers. For international recipes, a digital kitchen scale is your best friend to avoid confusion.</p>

<h2>How to Measure 150 Grams of Granulated Sugar Without Scales</h2>
<p>No scales? No problem. To measure 150 grams of granulated sugar (or ¾ cup), use a dry measuring cup and the spoon-and-level method. Fill the cup loosely with sugar using a spoon, then level it with a straight edge. Avoid tapping or packing the sugar down, as this can add up to 20% extra volume. This technique works perfectly for <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> where precision matters.</p>
<p>If you’re using a tablespoon, note that 1 UK tablespoon holds about 12.5 grams of granulated sugar. That means 150 grams would be roughly 12 tablespoons. However, cups are far more reliable for larger quantities like this. Keep your <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> bookmarked for more measurement hacks and air fryer tips.</p>

<h3>Common Recipes Using 150 Grams of Granulated Sugar</h3>
<p>This quantity is ideal for small-batch air fryer bakes, like 6-8 cupcakes or a single-layer cake. Popular recipes include vanilla sponge, shortbread, or even a caramelised fruit crumble. Sugar isn’t just for sweetness—it helps with browning and structure in air fryer baking, so getting the 150-gram (or 0.75-cup) measurement right is key.</p>

<h2>Converting Other Sugar Types: Caster, Brown, and Icing</h2>
<p>While this guide focuses on granulated sugar, other types have different cup equivalents. For example, 150 grams of caster sugar equals about 0.85 cups due to its finer texture. Always check specific conversion charts for alternatives like brown or icing sugar, especially when preparing <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>desserts</a> in your air fryer.</p>

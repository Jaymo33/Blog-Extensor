<p>100g of brown sugar is approximately 3.53 ounces. This conversion is essential for anyone using an air fryer to bake or cook, ensuring your recipes turn out perfectly every time. Whether you're whipping up cookies, cakes, or glazes, knowing how to convert grams to ounces is a game-changer.</p>

<h2>Why converting 100g of brown sugar to ounces matters</h2>  
<p>When using an air fryer, precise measurements can make or break a recipe. Brown sugar, with its moisture content, can vary slightly in weight, but 100g reliably converts to 3.53 ounces. This accuracy is especially important for baking, where even small deviations can affect texture and taste.</p>  

<p>Many UK recipes, including those on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, list ingredients in grams. If your kitchen scale measures in ounces, this conversion ensures you’re using the right amount. No more guesswork—just perfect results every time.</p>  

<h3>How to measure brown sugar accurately</h3>  
<p>For the best results, use a digital kitchen scale to weigh your brown sugar. If you don’t have one, spoon the sugar into a measuring cup and level it off. Remember, packed brown sugar will weigh more than loosely filled, so 100g (3.53 oz) should be lightly packed for consistency.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for 100g of brown sugar in air fryer recipes</h2>  
<p>From cookies to glazes, 100g of brown sugar is a versatile ingredient. Try it in air fryer desserts like sticky toffee pudding or cinnamon rolls. You’ll find plenty of inspiration in the <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert category</a> on our site.</p>  

<p>Brown sugar also works wonders in savoury dishes, like glazed salmon or honey-mustard chicken. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more handy measurement swaps to simplify your cooking.</p>  

<h3>Tips for storing brown sugar</h3>  
<p>To keep brown sugar fresh, store it in an airtight container. If it hardens, place a slice of bread in the container overnight to restore moisture. This ensures your 100g (3.53 oz) measurements stay consistent for future recipes.</p>  

<h2>Converting other sugar amounts</h2>  
<p>Need to convert a different amount? Here’s a quick guide: 50g = 1.76 oz, 200g = 7.05 oz. Bookmark <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> for more conversion tips and air fryer hacks.</p>

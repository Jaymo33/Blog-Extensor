<h2>How to prepare and cook your 4.25 kg turkey crown in the air fryer</h2>
<p>Once you've converted your 4.25 kg turkey crown to pounds, it's time to think about preparation and cooking. A turkey crown of this size, approximately 9.37 pounds, is ideal for most family air fryers. Start by patting the skin dry and seasoning it generously with salt, pepper, and your favourite herbs. Letting it come to room temperature for about 30 minutes before cooking helps it cook more evenly. Preheating your air fryer to around 160°C is a good starting point for a turkey this size. Always use a meat thermometer to check the internal temperature reaches 75°C for food safety.</p>

<p>Cooking times can vary based on your specific air fryer model, but a general guide is about 25 minutes per pound. For your 4.25 kg turkey crown converted to pounds, that's roughly 9.37 pounds, so aim for around 3 hours and 45 minutes. However, always check the manufacturer's instructions and use a thermometer for accuracy. Basting the turkey halfway through cooking helps keep it moist and enhances the flavour. Letting it rest for at least 20 minutes after cooking allows the juices to redistribute, resulting in a more tender eat.

Adding aromatics like garlic, lemon, and thyme to the cavity infuses the meat with delicious notes during cooking. Trussing the crown neatly helps it cook evenly and maintain a nice shape. Using the air fryer basket without overcrowding ensures hot air circulates properly around the entire turkey. Finally, always clean your air fryer thoroughly after use with a product like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner</a> to keep it in top condition.</p>

<h2>Common questions about converting turkey crown weights</h2>
<p>Home cooks often have questions when converting weights like a 4.25 kg turkey crown to pounds. One frequent query is whether the conversion differs for boneless versus bone-in crowns, but the weight conversion remains the same.

Understanding these nuances ensures your 4.25 kg turkey crown turns out perfectly every time. For more answers, our FAQ section below covers these topics in detail.</p>

<p>2.5 tablespoons (tbsp) of hot sauce is approximately 37.5 grams (g). This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precision ensures the perfect balance of flavour and consistency. Whether you’re whipping up spicy wings or a zesty marinade, knowing the exact weight of your hot sauce can make all the difference.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on even heat distribution, and incorrect ingredient quantities can throw off cooking times and textures. Too much hot sauce might make your dish overly spicy or soggy, while too little could leave it bland. By converting 2.5 tbsp of hot sauce to grams, you ensure consistency in every batch. For more air fryer measurement tips, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>  

<p>Hot sauce density can vary slightly by brand, but a general rule is that 1 tbsp equals about 15 grams. This makes 2.5 tbsp roughly 37.5 grams. If you’re working with a thicker or thinner sauce, a kitchen scale will give you the most accurate reading. Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>spicy air fryer recipes</a> to put this conversion to delicious use.</p>  

<h3>How to measure hot sauce without a scale</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a scale, use standard measuring spoons and level off the sauce for accuracy. Remember, 2.5 tbsp is equivalent to 1.5 fluid ounces or 44 millilitres. For sticky sauces, lightly grease the spoon to help it slide off cleanly. Need more measurement hacks? Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipe category</a> includes plenty of saucy inspirations.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for 2.5 tbsp of hot sauce</h2>  
<p>This quantity is perfect for marinating 500g of chicken wings or adding a kick to dips and dressings. In air fryer cooking, evenly coating ingredients ensures crispy, flavourful results. Try it in our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable recipes</a> for a spicy twist on roasted veggies.</p>  

<p>Hot sauce also works wonders in glazes—brush it onto salmon or tofu before air frying for a caramelised finish. For cleaning up after saucy creations, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner guide</a> keeps your appliance spotless.</p>  

<h3>Adjusting heat levels in recipes</h3>  
<p>If 37.5 grams of hot sauce feels too fiery, mix in honey or yoghurt to balance the heat. For extra spice, add a pinch of cayenne pepper. The key is to tweak recipes to your taste while maintaining the right consistency for air frying.</p>

<p>860 ml of heavy cream is approximately 3.63 cups in the US measurement system and roughly 3.04 cups in the UK metric cup system. Whether you're whipping up a dessert or preparing a creamy sauce, knowing this conversion ensures your recipes turn out perfectly every time. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we understand how precise measurements can make or break a dish, especially when using an air fryer.</p>  

<h2>Understanding Cup Measurements for Heavy Cream</h2>  
<p>Heavy cream, also known as double cream in the UK, is a staple in many recipes, from air-fried desserts to rich sauces. The difference between US and UK cup sizes can be confusing—while a US cup holds 240 ml, a UK metric cup is 284 ml. This means 860 ml of heavy cream converts to 3.63 US cups or 3.04 UK cups. If you're following a recipe from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>our collection</a>, always check which measurement system it uses.</p>  

<p>For air fryer cooking, accuracy matters. Too much heavy cream can make dishes overly rich, while too little may leave them dry. Using a kitchen scale alongside measuring cups ensures precision. If you're scaling a recipe up or down, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> can help adjust quantities effortlessly.</p>  

<h3>Why Heavy Cream Measurements Matter in Air Fryers</h3>  
<p>Air fryers circulate hot air rapidly, so ingredients like heavy cream must be measured correctly to avoid splattering or uneven cooking. For example, adding 860 ml of heavy cream to a batter without adjusting other ingredients could throw off the texture. Whether you're making air-fried custards or creamy pasta bakes, precise conversions ensure consistent results.</p>  

<h2>Converting 860 ml of Heavy Cream for Baking</h2>  
<p>Baking is a science, and heavy cream plays a crucial role in recipes like scones, cakes, and mousses. If a recipe calls for 860 ml of heavy cream and you only have measuring cups, knowing the conversion (3.63 US cups or 3.04 UK cups) is essential. For more baking tips, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>cake recipes</a> designed for air fryers.</p>  

<p>Heavy cream adds moisture and richness, but over-pouring can lead to dense or soggy results. If you're adapting a traditional oven recipe for an air fryer, reducing the heavy cream slightly may help, as air fryers cook faster and more intensely. Always refer to trusted sources like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> for tested air fryer adjustments.</p>  

<h3>Tips for Measuring Heavy Cream Without a Scale</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a scale, use liquid measuring cups for accuracy. Pour 860 ml of heavy cream slowly, checking at eye level. For thicker creams, spooning it into the cup and leveling off avoids air gaps. Remember, 860 ml is just shy of 4 US cups, so stop at the 3.5-cup mark and add the remaining 0.13 cups carefully.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for 860 ml of Heavy Cream</h2>  
<p>From creamy pasta sauces to air-fried bread puddings, 860 ml of heavy cream is a versatile ingredient. It’s enough for a large batch of soup or a decadent dessert serving 6–8 people. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert recipes</a> for inspiration on using this quantity effectively.</p>  

<p>In savoury dishes, 860 ml of heavy cream can transform a simple chicken dish into a luxurious meal. When using an air fryer, mix it with herbs and spices for a quick sauce, or reduce it slightly for thicker consistency.

<p>0.5 tbsp of minced garlic weighs approximately 7 grams in UK measurements. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise ingredient quantities can make or break a dish. Whether you're whipping up garlic-infused chicken or a flavourful vegetable stir-fry, knowing the exact weight ensures consistency. For more handy conversions, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate garlic measurements matter</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of minced garlic is crucial for balancing flavours in air fryer dishes. Too little, and your meal might lack depth; too much, and it can overpower other ingredients. Garlic’s potency varies depending on how finely it’s minced, so weight-based measurements (like grams) are more reliable than volume (like tablespoons). If you love garlic-heavy recipes, browse our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>garlic chicken recipes</a> for inspiration.</p>  

<p>Air fryers circulate hot air rapidly, intensifying flavours, which means precise seasoning is key. A 7-gram portion of minced garlic (0.5 tbsp) distributes evenly, ensuring every bite is flavourful without being overwhelming. For dishes like garlic mushrooms or roasted potatoes, this measurement is a game-changer. Need cleaning tips after cooking?

<h3>How to measure minced garlic correctly</h3>  
<p>For accuracy, use a digital kitchen scale to weigh minced garlic. If you don’t have one, lightly pack the minced garlic into a measuring spoon without pressing too hard. Remember, 0.5 tbsp equals roughly 7 grams, but slight variations can occur based on moisture content. For more tips, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipe collection</a>.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for 0.5 tbsp minced garlic</h2>  
<p>This quantity is perfect for marinades, dressings, or seasoning proteins like chicken or shrimp. In air fryers, garlic’s flavour blooms under high heat, so 7 grams (0.5 tbsp) adds a robust touch without burning. Try it in <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>garlic-roasted vegetables</a> or as a base for sauces.</p>  

<p>Garlic also pairs well with herbs like rosemary or thyme in air-fried dishes. Since 0.5 tbsp minced garlic (7 grams) is a moderate amount, it’s versatile enough for most recipes. For garlic lovers, doubling the quantity is easy—just remember 1 tbsp equals about 14 grams. Craving more ideas?

<h3>Converting other garlic measurements</h3>  
<p>If a recipe calls for whole cloves, one medium clove yields about 0.5 tbsp (7 grams) when minced. For larger batches, scale up proportionally—e.g., 1 tbsp minced garlic equals 14 grams. This consistency ensures your air fryer meals turn out perfectly every time.</p>

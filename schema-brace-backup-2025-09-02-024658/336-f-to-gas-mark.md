<p>336 F converts to Gas Mark 3 for most UK ovens and air fryers. This medium heat setting is ideal for baking cookies, roasting vegetables, or cooking delicate proteins. Whether you're adapting a recipe or checking your air fryer manual, this conversion will help you achieve perfect results every time.</p>

<h2>Understanding 336 F to Gas Mark Conversions</h2>
<p>The Gas Mark system is uniquely British, with Gas Mark 3 representing approximately 160-170°C or 320-338°F. When your air fryer recipe calls for 336 F, you're working with a moderate heat perfect for even cooking. Many modern air fryers display both Fahrenheit and Gas Mark equivalents, but it's always good to double-check.</p>
<p>At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we recommend keeping a conversion chart handy for quick reference. This temperature works particularly well for baked goods like scones or muffins where you want gentle browning without burning the edges. The same applies when roasting nuts or dehydrating fruits in your air fryer.</p>

<h3>Why 336 F Matters in Air Fryers</h3>
<p>This specific temperature sits in the sweet spot for many air fryer functions. Unlike conventional ovens, air fryers circulate heat more efficiently, meaning Gas Mark 3 (336 F) can sometimes cook faster than expected. Always check food a few minutes early when trying new recipes at this temperature.</p>

<h2>Practical Applications for 336 F/Gas Mark 3</h2>
<p>From Sunday roasts to batch cooking, this temperature serves multiple purposes in British kitchens. When converting family recipes written for conventional ovens, you'll often encounter 336 F or Gas Mark 3 for casseroles and baked pasta dishes. The air fryer handles these beautifully with reduced cooking times.</p>
<p>For perfect roast potatoes, try parboiling first then air frying at 336 F (Gas Mark 3) for that crisp exterior and fluffy interior. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/potatoes>potato recipe collection</a> includes several variations using this temperature. It's also ideal for reheating leftovers without drying them out.</p>

<h3>Adjusting Cooking Times at Gas Mark 3</h3>
<p>When using 336 F in your air fryer, remember that cooking times may differ from traditional oven recipes. A cake that takes 30 minutes in a conventional oven at Gas Mark 3 might be done in 20-25 minutes in an air fryer. Always use visual cues and a skewer test for baked goods.</p>

<h2>Temperature Accuracy in Different Air Fryer Models</h2>
<p>Not all air fryers maintain temperatures exactly the same way. While 336 F should equate to Gas Mark 3 across devices, some budget models may run slightly hotter or cooler. If you notice consistent over-browning at this setting, try reducing the temperature by 5-10 degrees next time.</p>
<p>For those who love baking, <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>our cake recipes</a> include specific air fryer adjustments for Gas Mark 3 temperatures. Silicone liners (available in our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning accessories section</a>) can help prevent over-browning on delicate items like cupcakes.</p>

<h3>Converting Between Measurement Systems</h3>
<p>Beyond 336 F to Gas Mark, you might need to convert to Celsius (≈169°C) for some international recipes. Most quality air fryers allow switching between temperature units, but understanding these relationships helps when adapting handwritten recipes or older cookbooks.</p>

<h2>Special Considerations for Frozen Foods</h2>
<p>When cooking frozen items like chips or chicken nuggets at 336 F (Gas Mark 3), you may need to extend the time slightly compared to fresh preparations. The initial cold temperature affects heat transfer, so check packaging for air fryer-specific instructions or visit <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/frozen-foods>our frozen foods section</a> for guidance.</p>
<p>This temperature works particularly well for frozen fish fillets or veggie burgers, giving them time to heat through without burning the coating. Remember to shake the basket or turn items halfway for even cooking at Gas Mark 3 equivalents.</p>

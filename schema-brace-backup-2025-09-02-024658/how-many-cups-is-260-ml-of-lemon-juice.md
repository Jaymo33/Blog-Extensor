<p>260 ml of lemon juice is approximately 1.1 cups. This conversion is essential for baking, cooking, or preparing air fryer recipes where precise measurements matter. Whether you're making a zesty marinade or a tangy dessert, knowing how to convert millilitres to cups ensures your dish turns out perfectly.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Cooking</h2>  
<p>Accurate measurements are crucial, especially when working with ingredients like lemon juice, which can significantly alter the taste and texture of your dish. Too much acidity can overpower a recipe, while too little might leave it bland. For air fryer recipes, precision ensures even cooking and perfect results every time.</p>  
<p>If you're exploring new recipes on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, having a reliable conversion chart handy can save time and avoid mistakes. Lemon juice is a common ingredient in marinades, dressings, and desserts, so knowing how to measure it correctly is a game-changer.</p>

<h2>How to Convert 260 ml of Lemon Juice to Cups</h2>  
<p>Converting millilitres to cups is straightforward once you know the ratio. One cup equals 240 ml, so 260 ml is slightly more than one cup. For most recipes, this small difference won't drastically affect the outcome, but for precision, 1.1 cups is the exact measurement.</p>  
<p>If you're using a US measuring cup, note that it differs slightly from a UK cup (250 ml). For consistency, refer to <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>airfryerrecipe.co.uk's conversion chart</a> to avoid confusion. This is particularly helpful when adapting recipes from different regions.</p>

<h3>Using Lemon Juice in Air Fryer Recipes</h3>  
<p>Lemon juice adds brightness to air fryer dishes, from crispy chicken to roasted vegetables. When measuring 260 ml for a marinade or glaze, ensure you distribute it evenly for balanced flavour. Check out <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipes</a> for inspiration on using citrus in your cooking.</p>

<h2>Common Uses for 260 ml of Lemon Juice</h2>  
<p>260 ml of lemon juice is enough for several recipes, from salad dressings to desserts. It's a versatile ingredient that enhances both sweet and savoury dishes. If you're meal prepping, this quantity can be used across multiple meals, saving you time and effort.</p>  
<p>For those who love baking, 260 ml of lemon juice is perfect for cakes or tarts. Pair it with other ingredients from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert recipes</a> to create mouthwatering treats. The acidity also helps tenderise meats, making it ideal for marinades.</p>

<h3>Tips for Storing Lemon Juice</h3>  
<p>If you have leftover lemon juice, store it in an airtight container in the fridge for up to a week. For longer storage, freeze it in ice cube trays. This way, you'll always have lemon juice ready for your next air fryer adventure.</p>

<h2>Converting Other Lemon Juice Measurements</h2>  
<p>Beyond 260 ml, you might need to convert other quantities. For example, 125 ml is roughly half a cup, while 500 ml is about 2.1 cups. Keeping a conversion guide, like the one on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, ensures you're never caught off guard.</p>  
<p>Whether you're scaling a recipe up or down, understanding these conversions helps maintain consistency. This is especially useful when experimenting with new dishes or adjusting serving sizes for family meals.</p>

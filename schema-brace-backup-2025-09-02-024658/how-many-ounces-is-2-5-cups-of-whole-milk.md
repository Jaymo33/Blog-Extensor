<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of ingredients is crucial for air fryer recipes. Too much or too little liquid, like whole milk, can affect texture and cooking times. For example, if you’re making a batter for air-fried chicken, 2.5 cups of whole milk (20 ounces) ensures the right consistency.

<h3>How to Measure 2.5 Cups of Whole Milk Correctly</h3>  
<p>To measure 2.5 cups of whole milk accurately, use a liquid measuring cup with clear markings. Fill it to the 2.5-cup line, ensuring the milk sits level for precision. If you don’t have a measuring cup, a kitchen scale can confirm that 2.5 cups of whole milk weigh 20 ounces. This method is foolproof for air fryer cooking, where exact measurements matter.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for 2.5 Cups of Whole Milk in Air Fryer Recipes</h2>

Whole milk’s fat content also helps achieve a golden, crispy finish in air-fried dishes.</p>

<p>2 tablespoons (tbsp) of granulated sugar equals approximately 25 grams. This conversion is essential for precise baking, especially when using an air fryer where measurements matter. Whether you’re whipping up cakes or sweetening desserts, knowing the exact weight ensures consistency. For more air fryer-friendly recipes, visit <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes</a>.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Sugar Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Getting the right amount of granulated sugar is crucial for baking success. Too much or too little can affect texture, sweetness, and even cooking times in your air fryer. For example, cookies may spread too thinly if the sugar ratio is off. If you’re new to air fryer baking, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for other common ingredient swaps.</p>  

<p>Granulated sugar is a staple in many recipes, from cakes to glazes. Measuring by weight (grams) is far more reliable than volume (tablespoons) due to variations in packing density. A digital kitchen scale ensures precision, especially when adapting recipes for air fryers. For more baking tips, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>cake recipes</a>.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure 2 Tbsp Granulated Sugar Correctly</h3>  
<p>To measure 2 tbsp of granulated sugar accurately, lightly spoon the sugar into the tablespoon and level it off with a knife. Avoid packing it down, as this can lead to over-measuring. If you’re converting 2 tbsp granulated sugar to grams regularly, consider keeping a conversion cheat sheet handy.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for 2 Tbsp Granulated Sugar</h2>  
<p>Two tablespoons of granulated sugar (25g) is a common quantity in many air fryer recipes. It’s perfect for sweetening small batches of muffins, glazes, or even caramelising fruits. For savoury dishes needing a touch of sweetness, like glazed salmon, this measurement is ideal. Find more inspiration at <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert recipes</a>.</p>  

<p>Granulated sugar also plays a role in balancing flavours in sauces and marinades. Whether you’re making a quick teriyaki glaze or a simple syrup for drinks, 2 tbsp (25g) is a handy benchmark.

<h3>Converting Other Sugar Types</h3>  
<p>While this guide focuses on granulated sugar, other sugars like caster or brown have slightly different weights per tablespoon. Always check specific conversions if substituting. For example, 2 tbsp of brown sugar may weigh closer to 28g due to its moisture content.</p>

<p>1.25 cups of vegetable broth equals 10 fluid ounces (fl oz). This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes, where precise measurements can make or break your dish. Whether you’re making soups, stews, or marinades, knowing how to convert cups to ounces ensures consistency and perfect results every time.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on precise ingredient ratios to achieve even cooking and crispy textures. Too much or too little liquid, like vegetable broth, can affect the outcome. For example, adding 10 ounces of broth instead of 1.25 cups might seem minor, but it can alter the moisture balance in your dish. That’s why conversions matter—especially when following recipes from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>.</p>  

<p>Many air fryer recipes, like vegetable stir-fries or braised dishes, call for vegetable broth. Whether you’re using store-bought or homemade broth, measuring correctly ensures your dish turns out as intended. A handy <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a> can save time and prevent mistakes.</p>  

<h3>How to measure 1.25 cups of vegetable broth</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a measuring cup, use a kitchen scale for accuracy. Since 1 cup of vegetable broth weighs 8 fluid ounces, 1.25 cups will be exactly 10 fl oz. For UK cooks, note that fluid ounces are the same in both US and UK measurements, so no additional conversion is needed.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for vegetable broth in air fryer recipes</h2>  
<p>Vegetable broth adds depth to many air fryer dishes, from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable-based recipes</a> to marinades. It’s a staple in soups, grain dishes, and even as a base for sauces. Knowing that 1.25 cups equals 10 ounces helps you adjust recipes without hassle.</p>  

<p>For example, if a recipe calls for 20 ounces of broth, you’ll know that’s 2.5 cups. This precision is especially useful when scaling recipes up or down. Check out <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> for inspiration on how to use vegetable broth in your next air fryer meal.</p>  

<h3>Tips for storing and using vegetable broth</h3>  
<p>Store leftover broth in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 5 days, or freeze it for longer shelf life. Pre-measuring broth into 10-ounce portions (1.25 cups) can save time when cooking. This way, you’ll always have the right amount ready for your air fryer recipes.</p>  

<h2>Converting other liquid measurements for air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Beyond vegetable broth, many liquids need converting for air fryer recipes. Whether it’s oil, water, or sauces, knowing common conversions ensures accuracy. For example, 1 cup of water is also 8 fluid ounces, just like broth. Keeping a <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a> handy simplifies the process.</p>  

<p>If you’re working with thicker liquids, like cream or syrup, weight may vary slightly. However, for most cooking purposes, the standard 8-ounces-per-cup rule applies. This consistency makes it easier to follow recipes from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> without second-guessing measurements.</p>  

<h3>Why fluid ounces matter in air fryer recipes</h3>  
<p>Unlike dry ingredients, liquids are measured by volume, not weight. Fluid ounces ensure you’re adding the right amount of moisture to your dish. Too much liquid can make food soggy, while too little may cause uneven cooking. That’s why converting 1.25 cups of vegetable broth to 10 ounces is so important.</p>

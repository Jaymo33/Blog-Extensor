<p>1.5 cups of sunflower seeds equals approximately 7.5 ounces (213 grams). This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes, ensuring accurate measurements for perfect results every time. Whether you're roasting seeds for a snack or incorporating them into a dish, knowing the exact weight helps maintain consistency.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Precision is key when using an air fryer, as uneven measurements can affect cooking times and textures. Sunflower seeds, for example, roast best when spread evenly in a single layer. Too many seeds can lead to uneven cooking, while too few might burn quickly. For more tips on air fryer conversions, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>  

<p>Using the correct amount of sunflower seeds ensures your recipes turn out as intended. Whether you're making granola, breading, or a crunchy topping, 1.5 cups (7.5 oz) is a common measurement. If you're experimenting with new recipes, always weigh ingredients for the best results.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure Sunflower Seeds Correctly</h3>  
<p>For the most accurate measurement, use a kitchen scale to weigh your sunflower seeds. If you don’t have one, lightly pack the seeds into a measuring cup without pressing down too hard. This prevents overpacking, which could skew the weight. For more recipe ideas, visit our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipes section</a>.</p>  

<h2>Converting Cups to Ounces for Different Ingredients</h2>  
<p>Not all ingredients weigh the same per cup, so conversions vary. Sunflower seeds are lighter than nuts like almonds but denser than flaxseeds. If you're substituting seeds in a recipe, always verify the weight to avoid mishaps. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion guide</a> covers common ingredients for air fryer cooking.</p>  

<p>For example, 1.5 cups of almonds weigh about 7.5 oz, similar to sunflower seeds, but chia seeds would be much lighter. Always double-check weights when swapping ingredients in air fryer recipes to ensure proper cooking times and textures.</p>  

<h3>Common Uses for Sunflower Seeds in Air Fryer Recipes</h3>  
<p>Sunflower seeds add crunch and nutrition to many dishes. Try them in homemade granola, as a coating for chicken, or sprinkled over roasted vegetables. For inspiration, browse our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable recipes</a> featuring seeds. Their high oil content means they toast beautifully in the air fryer.</p>  

<h2>Tips for Storing and Prepping Sunflower Seeds</h2>  
<p>Keep sunflower seeds fresh by storing them in an airtight container in a cool, dark place. If you buy in bulk, portion them into smaller bags for easy use. Pre-measuring 1.5-cup portions (7.5 oz) saves time when cooking. For more meal prep ideas, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/meal-prep>meal prep section</a>.</p>  

<p>Toasting sunflower seeds in the air fryer enhances their flavor. Spread them in a single layer and cook at 160°C for 5–7 minutes, shaking halfway. Let them cool before adding to salads, yogurts, or baked goods. Always measure after toasting for accurate recipe quantities.</p>

<h2>How to measure 0.375 cup of diced peppers</h2>  
<p>To measure 0.375 cup of diced peppers, use a standard measuring cup and fill it just over one-third full. Alternatively, a kitchen scale will give you the most accurate result—3 ounces. If you don’t have a scale, lightly pack the peppers into the cup without crushing them. This method works well for recipes like fajitas or stuffed peppers.

This eliminates guesswork and ensures consistency across batches. It’s also handy for other ingredients, like chicken or tofu, which often require precise measurements.</p>

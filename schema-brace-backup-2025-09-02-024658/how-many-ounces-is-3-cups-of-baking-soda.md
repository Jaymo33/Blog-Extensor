<p>3 cups of baking soda equals approximately 24 ounces. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes, where precise measurements can make or break your dish. Whether you're prepping a crispy coating or a baking soda-based cleaner for your air fryer, knowing the exact weight ensures consistency.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on even heat distribution, and incorrect ingredient quantities can lead to uneven cooking. Baking soda, often used in batters or as a leavening agent, needs precise measurement. Too much can leave a bitter taste, while too little might affect texture. For more air fryer tips, check out <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>our conversion chart</a>.</p>  

<p>Many UK home cooks prefer weighing ingredients for accuracy, especially when scaling recipes. If you're adapting a US recipe, remember that UK cup sizes can differ slightly. Always double-check conversions to avoid mishaps. For more recipe ideas, visit <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>our recipe hub</a>.</p>  

<h3>How to measure 3 cups of baking soda correctly</h3>  
<p>Use a dry measuring cup and level off the top with a straight edge for accuracy. Avoid packing the baking soda down, as this can lead to over-measuring. If you have a kitchen scale, weighing 24 ounces (680 grams) is even more reliable. This method is especially useful for air fryer recipes requiring consistency.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for baking soda in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Baking soda isn't just for baking—it's a versatile ingredient in air fryer cooking. It helps create crispy coatings for chicken or vegetables, and can even be used to clean your air fryer basket. For a deep clean, mix baking soda with water and follow <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>our cleaning guide</a>.</p>  

<p>In recipes, baking soda reacts with acids like vinegar or lemon juice to create lift. This is perfect for air-fried doughnuts or fluffy tempura batter. Just remember: 3 cups of baking soda equals 24 ounces, so measure carefully to avoid overdoing it.

<h3>Converting other baking soda quantities</h3>  
<p>Need smaller or larger amounts? Here’s a quick reference: 1 cup of baking soda = 8 ounces, and ½ cup = 4 ounces.

<p>3 tablespoons of sesame oil weigh approximately 40.5 grams. This conversion is essential for air fryer cooking, where precise measurements can make or break a dish. Whether you’re whipping up a marinade or drizzling oil over veggies, knowing the exact weight ensures consistency. For more air fryer measurement tips, visit <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>our conversion chart</a>.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of sesame oil can affect texture, flavour, and even cooking time in your air fryer. Too much oil can make food greasy, while too little may leave it dry. Measuring by weight (grams) is more reliable than volume (tablespoons) because oils vary in density. If you’re new to air frying, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a> for inspiration.</p>  

<p>Sesame oil adds a rich, nutty flavour to dishes like stir-fries, roasted vegetables, or marinated meats. For best results, stick to the 3 tbsp sesame oil to grams conversion (40.5g) when following recipes. This ensures your air fryer meals turn out perfectly every time. Need cleaning tips? Check out <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>our guide</a> to keep your appliance in top shape.</p>  

<h3>How to measure sesame oil without scales</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have kitchen scales, use a standard UK tablespoon (15ml) to measure sesame oil. Three level tablespoons equal roughly 40.5 grams. Avoid heaping or under-filling the spoon for accuracy. For more air fryer hacks, browse our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable recipes</a> that make the most of sesame oil.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for sesame oil in air fryer recipes</h2>  
<p>Sesame oil works brilliantly in air fryer dishes, from crispy tofu to golden chicken wings. Its high smoke point makes it ideal for high-heat cooking. Try using 3 tbsp (40.5g) in marinades or as a finishing drizzle for extra flavour. Discover more ideas in our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipe section</a>.</p>  

<p>Remember that toasted sesame oil has a stronger flavour than regular sesame oil, so adjust quantities accordingly. Both types weigh the same (3 tbsp = 40.5g), but their taste profiles differ.

<p>1 cup of almonds equals approximately 5.3 ounces (150 grams). This measurement is key for air fryer recipes, ensuring consistent results every time. Whether you're roasting almonds or using them in dishes, knowing this conversion helps avoid guesswork.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Almond Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Using the correct weight for almonds ensures your air fryer recipes turn out perfectly. Too many almonds can overcrowd the basket, leading to uneven cooking. Too few might leave your dish lacking texture or flavour. For example, recipes like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer almond-crusted chicken</a> rely on precise measurements.</p>  

<p>Almonds are a versatile ingredient, whether whole, sliced, or ground. A cup of whole almonds weighs slightly more than a cup of sliced ones due to air gaps. Always check if your recipe specifies whole or sliced almonds for the best outcome. You can find more tips on our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>  

<h2>Converting Cups to Ounces for Almonds</h2>  
<p>Converting 1 cup of almonds to ounces is straightforward once you know the standard weight. As mentioned, 1 cup equals roughly 5.3 ounces. This conversion is especially useful for UK cooks using air fryers, as many recipes list ingredients by weight.</p>  

<p>If you don’t have a kitchen scale, measuring by volume works too—just fluff the almonds before scooping. For recipes like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>air fryer almond cookies</a>, consistency is key. Too much or too little almond flour can alter texture dramatically.</p>  

<h3>Whole vs. Sliced Almonds</h3>  
<p>Whole almonds and sliced almonds have different densities, affecting their weight per cup. Whole almonds pack more tightly, so 1 cup weighs closer to 5.3 ounces. Sliced almonds, with more air space, weigh about 3 ounces per cup. Always adjust based on your recipe’s requirements.</p>  

<h2>Using Almonds in Your Air Fryer</h2>  
<p>Almonds are a fantastic addition to air fryer meals, adding crunch and nutrition. Whether you’re making <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/breakfast>almond granola</a> or coating fish, precise measurements ensure success. Roasting almonds in the air fryer takes just 5–7 minutes at 160°C, but timing depends on quantity.</p>  

<p>For best results, spread almonds in a single layer in the basket. Overcrowding leads to uneven roasting. If you’re unsure about portion sizes, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning guide</a> also includes tips on maintaining your appliance after cooking nuts.</p>  

<h3>Storing Almonds for Freshness</h3>  
<p>Proper storage keeps almonds fresh longer. After measuring, store unused almonds in an airtight container away from heat. This preserves their natural oils, ensuring they stay crisp for future air fryer recipes.</p>

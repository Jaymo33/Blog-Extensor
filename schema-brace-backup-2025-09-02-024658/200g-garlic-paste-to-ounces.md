<h2>Why Convert 200g of Garlic Paste to Ounces?</h2>  
<p>Many UK recipes, especially those for air fryers, use metric measurements like grams. However, some kitchen scales or international recipes might list ingredients in ounces. Converting 200g of garlic paste to ounces (7.05 oz) helps avoid guesswork and ensures your dish turns out perfectly. Whether you're preparing a garlic-infused chicken dish or a flavourful vegetable stir-fry, precise measurements matter.</p>  
<p>Garlic paste is a staple in many cuisines, and its strong flavour means even small measurement errors can impact your dish. By using our conversion, you can confidently follow any recipe, whether it's from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>our recipe collection</a> or another source. Accurate conversions also help when scaling recipes up or down for meal prep.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure 200g of Garlic Paste Accurately</h3>  
<p>To measure 200g of garlic paste, use a digital kitchen scale for the most precise results. If your scale displays ounces, you'll see it reads roughly 7.05 oz. For those without scales, 200g of garlic paste is roughly equivalent to 12-13 tablespoons, but weighing is always more accurate. This ensures your air fryer dishes, like garlic butter shrimp or roasted vegetables, have the perfect balance of flavours.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for 200g of Garlic Paste in Air Fryer Recipes</h2>

Its concentrated flavour means a little goes a long way, making it a cost-effective ingredient for home cooks.</p>

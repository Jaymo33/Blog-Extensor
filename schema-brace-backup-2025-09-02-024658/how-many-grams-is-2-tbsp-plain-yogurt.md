<p>2 tablespoons (tbsp) of plain yogurt weigh approximately 30 grams. This measurement is handy for air fryer recipes where precision matters, ensuring your dishes turn out perfectly every time. Whether you're making marinades, dips, or baked goods, knowing this conversion helps streamline your cooking process.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on precise ingredient ratios to achieve the best texture and flavour. Too much or too little yogurt can affect moisture levels, cooking times, and even browning. For example, adding the right amount of yogurt to a marinade ensures your chicken stays juicy while crisping up nicely. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more handy measurement swaps.</p>  

<p>Many air fryer recipes, like our popular <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken dishes</a>, call for yogurt as a tenderiser. Measuring by weight (grams) rather than volume (tablespoons) eliminates guesswork, especially since yogurt thickness can vary. A kitchen scale is your best friend here, but if you don’t have one, our conversion guide ensures accuracy.</p>  

<h3>How to measure 2 tbsp of plain yogurt without scales</h3>  
<p>If you don’t own a kitchen scale, use standard measuring spoons for 2 tbsp of plain yogurt. Fill the spoon evenly without packing it down, and level off the excess with a knife. Remember, thicker Greek yogurt may weigh slightly more—around 35 grams per 2 tbsp—so adjust accordingly. For more tips, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a>.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for plain yogurt in air fryer recipes</h2>  
<p>Plain yogurt is a versatile ingredient in air fryer cooking. It works wonders in marinades for meats like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/lamb>lamb</a>, keeping them succulent during high-heat cooking. Yogurt also adds moisture to baked goods, such as air-fried muffins or cakes, without making them soggy.</p>  

<p>Another great use is in dips and sauces. Combine yogurt with herbs and spices for a tangy accompaniment to air-fried veggies or <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/potatoes>potatoes</a>. Since 2 tbsp equals roughly 30 grams, you can easily scale recipes up or down. For cleaning your air fryer after yogurt-based recipes, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning guide</a> has you covered.</p>  

<h3>Does yogurt type affect the weight?</h3>  
<p>Yes, yogurt density varies. Regular plain yogurt weighs about 30 grams per 2 tbsp, while Greek yogurt is denser at 35 grams. Always check your recipe’s requirements—some may specify which type to use. For consistent results, stick to the same brand or variety each time.</p>

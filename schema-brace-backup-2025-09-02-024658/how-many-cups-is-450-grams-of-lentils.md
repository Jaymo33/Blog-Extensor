For lentil-based dishes like falafel or burgers, follow recipe times but check for doneness as air fryer models vary. Always ensure lentils are spread evenly in the basket."

    "text": "Many air fryer recipes use weight measurements (grams) rather than volume (cups) because it's more precise. The way lentils settle in a cup can vary, but 450 grams is always 450 grams. This precision matters in air fryers where even cooking depends on consistent ingredient quantities. Investing in kitchen scales will improve your air fryer results."

<p>450 grams of lentils equals approximately 2.25 cups. This conversion is based on standard UK cup measurements, where 1 cup of lentils typically weighs around 200 grams. Whether you're using an air fryer or traditional oven, getting your measurements right is key to perfect results every time.</p>

<h2>Understanding Lentil Measurements</h2>
<p>When converting 450 grams of lentils to cups, it's important to consider how the lentils are packed. Loosely poured lentils will take up more space than firmly packed ones. For most recipes on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we recommend using the scoop-and-level method for consistent results. This means gently spooning lentils into your measuring cup without packing them down, then levelling off the top with a straight edge.</p>
<p>The type of lentil also affects the conversion slightly. While most varieties like green or brown lentils convert at roughly 200g per cup, smaller varieties like red lentils might be slightly denser. If precision matters for your air fryer recipe, weighing your ingredients will always be more accurate than volume measurements. Many modern air fryer recipes, especially those in our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/meal-prep>meal prep section</a>, include both weight and volume measurements for this reason.</p>

<h3>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryers</h3>
<p>Air fryers cook food by circulating hot air rapidly around the ingredients. When dealing with 450 grams of lentils (or 2.25 cups), proper measurement ensures even cooking. Too many lentils packed in can block airflow, while too few might cook unevenly. This is particularly important for recipes like crispy air-fried lentil snacks or lentil-based veggie burgers where texture is crucial.</p>

<h2>Converting 450g Lentils to Cups Around the World</h2>
<p>While we've used UK cup measurements (200g per cup) for our 450 grams of lentils conversion, it's worth noting that cup sizes vary globally. In the US, a standard cup is about 240ml compared to the UK's 250ml. However, for dry ingredients like lentils, the weight per cup is more important than the volume. American cooks might find 450 grams of lentils equals closer to 2 cups using their measurements.</p>
<p>If you're following an international recipe, always check whether it uses metric or imperial measurements. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> can help you navigate these differences. For 450 grams of lentils in particular, the slight variation between UK and US cups won't dramatically affect most air fryer recipes, but it's good to be aware of the difference.</p>

<h3>Tips for Measuring Lentils in Your Air Fryer</h3>
<p>When working with 450 grams of lentils (2.25 cups) in your air fryer, consider these pro tips: First, always rinse your lentils before measuring to remove any dust or debris. Second, for recipes where lentils will expand (like stews or curries), account for this growth by not overfilling your air fryer basket. Third, if converting between grams and cups for 450 grams of lentils, use the same measuring cup throughout the recipe for consistency.</p>

<h2>Common Air Fryer Recipes Using 450 Grams of Lentils</h2>
<p>What can you make with 450 grams of lentils (2.25 cups) in your air fryer? The possibilities are nearly endless! From crispy lentil snacks to protein-packed mains, this quantity is perfect for family meals. Our favourite uses include air-fried lentil falafel (using about 450 grams soaked lentils), crispy lentil-topped bakes, and even lentil-based veggie burgers that cook beautifully in the air fryer.</p>
<p>For those new to cooking lentils in air fryers, we recommend starting with simple recipes from our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetables category</a>. The high heat and rapid air circulation can transform 450 grams of lentils into delicious, crispy creations with minimal oil. Remember that cooking times may vary slightly depending on your specific air fryer model and how full the basket is with your 2.25 cups of lentils.</p>

<h3>Storing Leftover Lentils</h3>
<p>If your recipe doesn't use all 450 grams of lentils at once, proper storage is key. Cooked lentils keep well in the fridge for 3-4 days, making them perfect for <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/meal-prep>meal prep</a>. To reheat in your air fryer, spread them in a single layer and cook at 180°C for 3-5 minutes until heated through. Always ensure your air fryer is clean between uses - our guide to <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>keeping your air fryer clean</a> has all the tips you need.</p>

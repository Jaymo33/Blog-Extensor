However, the difference is usually minimal for most recipes. If precision is crucial, like in a glaze or sauce, account for a small reduction by starting with a tiny bit extra."

<p>185 ml of lemon juice equals approximately 0.78 cups. This conversion is handy for baking, cooking, or preparing air fryer recipes where precise measurements matter. Whether you're making a zesty marinade or a tangy dessert, knowing how to convert millilitres to cups ensures your dish turns out perfectly every time.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter</h2>
<p>When it comes to cooking, especially in an air fryer, precision is key. Too much or too little lemon juice can drastically alter the flavour and texture of your dish. For example, if you're making lemon drizzle cake or a citrusy glaze for salmon, 185 ml of lemon juice needs to be measured correctly. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes</a>, you'll find plenty of dishes where this conversion comes in handy.</p>
<p>Using the right amount of lemon juice also affects the acidity balance in recipes like dressings or marinades. A slight miscalculation could make your dish too tart or too bland. That's why knowing that 185 ml of lemon juice is roughly 0.78 cups can save your meal from disaster.</p>

<h2>How to Measure 185 ml of Lemon Juice</h2>
<p>If you don't have a measuring jug with millilitre markings, don't worry. You can still measure 185 ml of lemon juice accurately using a standard cup. Since 1 cup is about 240 ml, 185 ml is just under four-fifths of a cup. For best results, use a liquid measuring cup for precision.</p>
<p>Another handy trick is to use tablespoons. There are roughly 15 ml in a tablespoon, so 185 ml of lemon juice equals about 12.3 tablespoons. This method is great for smaller batches or when you need incremental adjustments.

<h3>UK vs. US Cup Measurements</h3>
<p>It's worth noting that UK and US cup measurements differ slightly. In the UK, 1 cup is 250 ml, while in the US, it's 240 ml. For 185 ml of lemon juice, this means 0.74 UK cups or 0.78 US cups. The difference is minimal but could matter in delicate recipes.</p>

<h2>Common Recipes Using 185 ml of Lemon Juice</h2>
<p>Many air fryer recipes call for around 185 ml of lemon juice. From tangy chicken marinades to refreshing lemon curd, this measurement pops up often. If you're exploring new dishes, <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipes</a> often benefit from a citrusy kick.</p>
<p>Lemon juice is also a staple in desserts. A classic lemon drizzle cake might require 185 ml for the perfect balance of sweetness and tartness. For more inspiration, browse our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert section</a> at airfryerrecipe.co.uk.</p>

<h3>Storing Leftover Lemon Juice</h3>
<p>If you have leftover lemon juice after measuring 185 ml, store it in an airtight container in the fridge. It'll stay fresh for about a week, ready for your next culinary adventure.

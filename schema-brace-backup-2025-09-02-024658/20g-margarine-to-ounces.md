<p>20g of margarine equals approximately 0.71 ounces. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements can make or break your dish. Whether you’re whipping up a batch of cookies or preparing a savoury dish, knowing how to convert grams to ounces ensures consistency. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we focus on making cooking conversions effortless, so you can focus on creating delicious meals.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate margarine measurements matter</h2>  
<p>Margarine plays a crucial role in baking and cooking, affecting texture, moisture, and flavour. Too much or too little can alter the outcome of your air fryer recipes. For example, using 20g of margarine instead of the correct ounce equivalent might result in dry cookies or overly greasy dishes. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> simplifies these calculations, so you never have to guess.</p>  

<p>Many UK recipes use grams, while others rely on ounces, making conversions a common kitchen task. If you’re working with a recipe from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>our collection</a>, knowing that 20g of margarine is 0.71 ounces ensures perfect results every time. This precision is especially important for air fryer cooking, where even small deviations can affect cooking times and textures.</p>  

<h3>How to measure 20g of margarine without a scale</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a kitchen scale, you can still measure 20g of margarine using tablespoons. One tablespoon of margarine weighs roughly 14g, so 20g is just under 1.5 tablespoons. For sticky margarine, lightly grease the spoon to help it slide off easily. This method isn’t as precise as weighing, but it works in a pinch for recipes like those in our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>cake category</a>.</p>  

<h2>Converting other margarine amounts</h2>  
<p>While 20g of margarine is 0.71 ounces, other common conversions include 50g (1.76 oz) and 100g (3.53 oz). These measurements are handy for scaling recipes up or down. For example, if a recipe calls for 40g of margarine, you’ll need 1.41 ounces. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a> covers these and more, making it a must-have kitchen resource.</p>  

<p>Margarine measurements are also crucial for air fryer liners and accessories. Using the right amount ensures even cooking and prevents sticking. If you’re preparing a dish from our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable category</a>, precise margarine measurements help achieve crispy, golden results. Always measure carefully, especially when adapting recipes for your air fryer.</p>  

<h3>Tips for working with margarine in air fryers</h3>  
<p>Margarine can melt quickly in an air fryer, so it’s best to use it sparingly. For 20g of margarine, consider brushing it lightly onto food rather than dolloping it in. This technique works well for recipes like air-fried potatoes or roasted vegetables.

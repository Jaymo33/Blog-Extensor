<p>0.375 cup of tomato ketchup equals 3 ounces. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes, where precise measurements can make all the difference. Whether you’re making glazes, sauces, or marinades, knowing the exact weight ensures consistent results. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we help you get the measurements spot-on for perfect dishes every time.</p>

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>
<p>Air fryers rely on even cooking, and the right amount of ingredients ensures your food turns out perfectly. Too much or too little tomato ketchup can throw off the balance of flavours and textures. For example, a glaze with too much ketchup might become overly sticky, while too little could leave your dish lacking flavour. That’s why knowing how many ounces are in 0.375 cup of tomato ketchup is so helpful.</p>
<p>Many air fryer recipes, like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>these delicious options</a>, call for small, precise amounts of ketchup. Whether you’re making meatloaf, chicken wings, or even a homemade BBQ sauce, accuracy is key. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> can help you convert other measurements too, making cooking even easier.</p>

<h2>How to measure 0.375 cup of tomato ketchup</h2>
<p>Measuring 0.375 cup of tomato ketchup might seem tricky, but it’s simpler than you think. Since 1 cup equals 8 ounces, 0.375 cup is exactly 3 ounces. You can use a liquid measuring cup or a kitchen scale for accuracy. If you don’t have a 0.375 cup measure, you can use tablespoons—0.375 cup is 6 tablespoons.</p>
<p>For those who prefer weighing ingredients, a kitchen scale is a great tool. Simply set it to ounces, pour your ketchup until it hits 3 ounces, and you’re done. This method is especially useful for sticky ingredients like ketchup, which can be messy to measure by volume. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner guide</a> for tips on keeping your kitchen tidy.</p>

<h3>Common uses for 0.375 cup of tomato ketchup</h3>
<p>Tomato ketchup is a versatile ingredient in air fryer cooking. A 0.375 cup (3 ounces) portion is perfect for glazes, dips, or marinades. For example, you might use it to make a tangy glaze for air-fried chicken wings or a base for homemade BBQ sauce. It’s also great for adding a touch of sweetness to meatloaf or burgers.</p>

<h3>Converting other ketchup measurements</h3>
<p>If you need to convert other amounts of tomato ketchup, here’s a quick reference: 1 cup is 8 ounces, 0.5 cup is 4 ounces, and 0.25 cup is 2 ounces. These conversions are handy for scaling recipes up or down. For more conversions, visit our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a>.</p>

<h2>Tips for cooking with tomato ketchup in your air fryer</h2>
<p>Tomato ketchup can add flavour and moisture to air-fried dishes, but it’s important to use it wisely. Too much can cause smoking or burning due to its sugar content. For best results, mix ketchup with other ingredients like vinegar, soy sauce, or spices to balance the sweetness. This is especially useful for <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipes</a>.</p>
<p>Another tip is to apply ketchup-based sauces towards the end of cooking. This prevents burning and ensures a glossy, sticky finish. If you’re using ketchup as a glaze, brush it on during the last 5-10 minutes of cooking. This technique works well for ribs, wings, and even vegetables.</p>

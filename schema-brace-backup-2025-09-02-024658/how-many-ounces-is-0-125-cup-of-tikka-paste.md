<p>0.125 cup of tikka paste equals approximately 1 ounce. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements can make or break your dish. Whether you're marinating chicken or preparing a quick curry, knowing the exact weight ensures consistent results every time.</p>

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>
<p>Air fryers rely on even heat distribution, and the right amount of ingredients ensures perfect cooking. Too much tikka paste can overpower the dish, while too little might leave it bland. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we emphasise precision for the best outcomes. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> helps simplify these calculations.</p>
<p>For tikka paste, 0.125 cup translates to roughly 1 ounce, but density can vary slightly. If you're using homemade paste, it might weigh a tad more due to chunkier ingredients. Store-bought versions are usually more consistent, making conversions easier.</p>

<h2>How to measure 0.125 cup of tikka paste</h2>
<p>Measuring small quantities like 0.125 cup can be tricky without the right tools. A standard US cup holds 8 ounces, so 0.125 cup is one-eighth of that. You can use a tablespoon (2 tablespoons equal 0.125 cup) or a kitchen scale for accuracy.</p>
<p>For air fryer recipes, we recommend weighing ingredients whenever possible. This ensures your <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipes</a> turn out perfectly every time. If you don't have a scale, the spoon method works in a pinch, but results may vary slightly.</p>

<h3>Converting other tikka paste measurements</h3>
<p>Need different amounts? Here's a quick reference: 0.25 cup equals 2 ounces, 0.5 cup equals 4 ounces, and 1 cup equals 8 ounces. These conversions work for most thick pastes and sauces used in air fryer cooking.</p>

<h2>Using tikka paste in air fryer recipes</h2>
<p>Tikka paste adds incredible flavour to air-fried dishes. From chicken tikka to vegetable skewers, this versatile ingredient is a staple in many kitchens. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>our chicken recipe category</a>, you'll find plenty of inspiration.</p>
<p>When using 0.125 cup (1 ounce) of tikka paste, it's perfect for marinating 2-3 chicken breasts or a similar portion of vegetables. Remember to coat evenly and let it sit for at least 30 minutes before cooking for maximum flavour penetration.</p>

<h3>Storing leftover tikka paste</h3>
<p>If you have leftover paste after measuring out your 0.125 cup, store it in an airtight container in the fridge. It typically keeps for 2-3 weeks. For longer storage, freeze it in ice cube trays - each cube is about 1 ounce, making future measurements effortless.</p>

<h2>Common mistakes when measuring tikka paste</h2>
<p>One frequent error is packing the paste into the measuring cup, which can nearly double the weight. For accurate 0.125 cup to ounce conversion, spoon the paste lightly into the measure and level it off. Another mistake is confusing fluid ounces with weight ounces - they're not always the same.</p>

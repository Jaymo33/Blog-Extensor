<h2>Why Measuring Nutella Accurately Matters</h2>  
<p>Using the correct amount of Nutella can make or break your recipe. Too little, and your dish might lack flavour; too much, and it could become overly sweet or sticky. Air fryer recipes, in particular, rely on precise measurements for even cooking. A tablespoon of Nutella (19g) is a common measurement in many UK recipes, from cakes to pancakes. For more delicious ideas, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a>.</p>  

<p>Nutella’s thick consistency means volume measurements like tablespoons can vary slightly. Weight measurements in grams eliminate this uncertainty, ensuring your air fryer creations turn out perfectly every time. This is especially important for baking, where precision is key. If you’re working with other ingredients, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a> can help.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure 1 Tbsp of Nutella Correctly</h3>  
<p>To measure 1 tablespoon of Nutella accurately, use a standard UK tablespoon (15ml) and level it off with a knife. For exactness, a kitchen scale is best—simply tare the scale and scoop until it reads 19g. This method avoids air pockets or uneven spreads, giving you the perfect amount for your air fryer recipes.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for 1 Tbsp of Nutella</h2>  
<p>One tablespoon of Nutella (19g) is perfect for drizzling over air-fried desserts like churros or pancakes. It’s also a great addition to breakfast dishes, such as stuffed French toast or porridge. For more inspiration, browse our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert recipes</a>.</p>  

<p>Nutella can even be used in savoury air fryer dishes, like glazed nuts or as a dip for fruit. Its versatility makes it a staple in many kitchens, and knowing the gram equivalent of 1 tbsp ensures you never over or under-measure.

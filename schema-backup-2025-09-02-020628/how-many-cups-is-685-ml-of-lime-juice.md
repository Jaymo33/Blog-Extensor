<p>685 ml of lime juice equals approximately 2.9 cups. Whether you're preparing a zesty marinade for chicken or a tangy glaze for salmon in your air fryer, knowing this conversion ensures your recipe turns out perfectly every time. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we understand how precise measurements can make or break a dish, especially when working with bold flavours like lime juice.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Lime Juice Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of lime juice is crucial for balancing flavours in air fryer recipes. Too little, and your dish might lack brightness; too much, and it could become overpowering. For example, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>lime-marinated shrimp recipe</a> relies on exact proportions to achieve the perfect tang. Measuring 685 ml of lime juice correctly ensures consistency, whether you're cooking for one or meal prepping for the week.</p>  

<p>Lime juice also plays a key role in tenderising meats like chicken or turkey before air frying. A precise 2.9 cups (685 ml) helps break down fibres without making the protein mushy. If you're experimenting with <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>lime-infused desserts</a>, accuracy prevents curdling or overly acidic results.</p>  

<h3>Converting 685 ml of Lime Juice to Other Measurements</h3>  
<p>While 685 ml translates to roughly 2.9 cups, you might need smaller increments for adjustments. For instance, 685 ml is also equivalent to 23.16 fluid ounces or 46.3 tablespoons. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> simplifies these calculations for all your cooking needs.</p>  

<h2>Tips for Measuring Lime Juice Efficiently</h2>  
<p>To measure 685 ml of lime juice accurately, use a liquid measuring cup with clear metric and imperial markings. Freshly squeezed lime juice yields the best flavour, but bottled works in a pinch—just check for additives. For sticky residues, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner guide</a> keeps your tools spotless.</p>  

<p>If scaling recipes, remember that 685 ml (2.9 cups) of lime juice pairs well with 3-4 cloves of garlic or 2 tablespoons of honey in marinades. For <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>lime-chicken dishes</a>, this quantity covers about 1.5 kg of meat evenly.</p>  

<h3>Common Uses for 685 ml of Lime Juice in Air Fryers</h3>  
<p>This amount is ideal for batch cooking. Try it in citrus-glazed salmon, Vietnamese-style wings, or dairy-free key lime "cheesecake" bites. The acidity also helps crisp vegetables like potatoes or tofu without oil.</p>

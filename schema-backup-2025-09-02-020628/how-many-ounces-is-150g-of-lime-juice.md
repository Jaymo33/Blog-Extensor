<p>150g of lime juice equals approximately 5.29 ounces. Whether you're preparing a zesty marinade for chicken or a tangy dressing for salads, accurate measurements ensure your air fryer recipes turn out perfectly every time. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we know precision matters, especially when balancing flavours in dishes like citrus-glazed salmon or lime-infused shrimp.</p>

<h2>Why Convert 150g of Lime Juice to Ounces?</h2>  
<p>Converting grams to ounces is essential for consistency in cooking, especially when following international recipes or using kitchen scales. Lime juice, with its bright acidity, is a staple in many air fryer dishes, from marinades to desserts. Knowing that 150g lime juice to ounces is roughly 5.29 oz helps you avoid guesswork and achieve the perfect balance in recipes like our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>lime-cilantro chicken</a>.</p>  
<p>Many UK cooks prefer using ounces for liquid measurements, as it aligns with common measuring jug markings. If your air fryer recipe calls for 150 grams of lime juice in ounces, this conversion ensures you won’t over- or under-season your dish. Plus, it’s handy for scaling recipes up or down—whether you’re meal prepping or cooking for one.</p>  

<h2>How to Measure 150g Lime Juice Accurately</h2>  
<p>For the most precise 150g lime juice to oz conversion, use a digital kitchen scale set to grams. Squeeze fresh limes until the scale reads 150g, then note the volume in fluid ounces (roughly 5.29 oz). If you don’t have a scale, remember that one medium lime yields about 30g (1 oz) of juice, so you’d need 5 limes for 150g.</p>  

<h3>Using Bottled vs. Fresh Lime Juice</h3>  
<p>While fresh lime juice offers superior flavour, bottled lime juice works in a pinch. Check the label—some brands list weight (grams) and volume (ml or fl oz), making it easier to measure 150g of lime juice in ounces without squeezing. For recipes like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>citrus-marinated chicken</a>, fresh juice is worth the effort.</p>  

<h2>Common Recipes Using 150g Lime Juice</h2>  
<p>From tangy glazes to refreshing dressings, 150g (5.29 oz) of lime juice elevates countless air fryer dishes. Try it in our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>-friendly recipe for lime-and-honey salmon, where the juice caramelises beautifully. It’s also perfect for vegan tofu marinades or balancing rich dishes like coconut shrimp.</p>  
<p>For dessert lovers, 150g lime juice makes a killer key lime pie filling—just swap the traditional baking method for an air fryer-friendly version. The acidity also tenderises meats, making it ideal for prepping <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/beef>beef fajitas</a> or lamb kebabs before air frying.</p>  

<h3>Storage Tips for Leftover Lime Juice</h3>  
<p>If you have extra lime juice after measuring 150g, freeze it in ice cube trays (each cube holds ~30g or 1 oz). Thaw as needed for future recipes, or use it to clean your <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer basket</a>—the acidity helps dissolve grease!</p>

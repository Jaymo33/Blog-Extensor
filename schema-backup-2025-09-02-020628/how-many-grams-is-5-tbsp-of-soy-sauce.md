<p>5 tablespoons (tbsp) of soy sauce equals approximately 75 grams (g). This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements ensure the best results. Whether you're marinating chicken or seasoning tofu, knowing the exact weight helps avoid overly salty or bland dishes. For more air fryer conversions, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate soy sauce measurements matter</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of soy sauce is crucial in air fryer cooking. Too much can overpower your dish, while too little may leave it lacking flavour. Many air fryer recipes, like those for <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken</a> or <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/tofu>tofu</a>, rely on precise soy sauce quantities for perfect seasoning. Measuring by weight (grams) is often more accurate than volume (tablespoons), especially with thick or reduced soy sauces.</p>  

<p>Different soy sauce brands may vary slightly in density, but 5 tbsp generally converts to 75g in UK measurements. This standardisation helps when following recipes from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> or adjusting portion sizes. Always use proper measuring spoons for consistency, and level off the top for an exact tablespoon measure.</p>  

<h3>How to measure soy sauce for air fryer recipes</h3>  
<p>For best results, use digital kitchen scales when converting 5 tbsp soy sauce to grams. Place your mixing bowl on the scales, tare to zero, then pour the soy sauce until it reaches 75g. This method eliminates guesswork and ensures your <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> turn out perfectly seasoned every time.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for 5 tbsp soy sauce in air frying</h2>  
<p>Five tablespoons of soy sauce (75g) is a common quantity in many air fryer marinades and sauces. It's enough to coat 500g of chicken wings or tofu cubes for delicious Asian-inspired dishes. The salty-umami flavour enhances meats, vegetables, and even <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/mushrooms>mushrooms</a> when air fried to crispy perfection.</p>  

<p>When making teriyaki or stir-fry style dishes in your air fryer, 5 tbsp soy sauce forms the flavour base. Combine it with honey, garlic, and ginger for a quick marinade. After cooking, remember to clean your air fryer basket thoroughly - soy sauce can leave stubborn stains. Our guide on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaning</a> has helpful tips.</p>  

<h3>Adjusting soy sauce quantities in recipes</h3>  
<p>If a recipe calls for 5 tbsp soy sauce but you prefer less saltiness, you can reduce it to 4 tbsp (60g) and compensate with other flavours. Conversely, for bolder dishes, increase to 6 tbsp (90g). Always adjust other liquid ingredients proportionally to maintain the right consistency for air frying.</p>

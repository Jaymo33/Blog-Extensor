<h2 id=""><strong id="">Cooking sausages in an air fryer – Perfect timing and technique</strong></h2><p id="">You love quick, crispy meals, and <a href="https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk" id="">Air Fryer Recipes UK</a> knows exactly how to make the most of them. When it comes to cooking sausages in an air fryer, aim for <strong id="">10–12 minutes at 180 °C (350 °F)</strong>. Preheat your air fryer, lay the sausages in a single layer, and turn them halfway through. You’ll get juicy sausages with golden skin — perfect for everything from <a target="_new" href="https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/categories/breakfast" id="">air fryer breakfasts</a> to weeknight dinners.</p><p id="">For even better results, check out our <a target="_new" href="https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart" id="">Air Fryer Conversion Chart</a>, ideal for adjusting temperatures and timings for pork, beef, turkey, or veggie sausages.

Lighter chipolatas or chicken sausages? Check at 7–10 minutes. Frozen sausages take a little longer—<strong id="">15–20 minutes at 180–200 °C</strong> is the sweet spot. That goes for meat-free sausages too. Turn halfway through for even cooking and consistent browning.</p><p id="">For recipe ideas, try pairing your sausages with <a target="_new" href="https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes/air-fryer-sweet-potato-fries" id="">air fryer sweet potato fries</a>, a <a target="_new" href="https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes/air-fryer-vegetable-medley" id="">vegetable medley</a>, or even a full <a target="_new" href="https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes/air-fryer-sausage-veg-tray-bake" id="">sausage veg tray bake</a>.

It helps lock in flavour and delivers that even golden crisp. Turn the sausages halfway to avoid uneven browning. Resist the urge to pierce — it’ll dry them out. For pork or chicken, that internal temp sweet spot is 75 °C.

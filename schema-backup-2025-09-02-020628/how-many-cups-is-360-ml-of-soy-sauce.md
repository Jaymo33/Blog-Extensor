<h2>Understanding Cup Measurements for Soy Sauce</h2>  
<p>When converting 360 ml of soy sauce to cups, it's important to note that US and UK cup sizes differ. A US cup holds 240 ml, while a UK cup holds 284 ml. This means 360 ml of soy sauce is roughly 1.5 US cups or 1.27 UK cups. For air fryer recipes, especially those involving marinades or sauces, accuracy matters. A slight miscalculation could lead to overly salty or bland dishes. Always use a measuring jug for liquids to ensure precision.</p>  

<p>If you're working with an air fryer, you might also need to adjust quantities based on the recipe's serving size. For example, a <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>teriyaki chicken recipe</a> might call for 360 ml of soy sauce, but you may need to scale it down. Understanding these conversions helps you adapt recipes effortlessly.

<h3>Why Precision Matters in Air Fryer Cooking</h3>  
<p>Air fryers cook food quickly and evenly, but they rely on balanced flavours. Too much soy sauce can overpower a dish, while too little might leave it tasting bland. Measuring 360 ml of soy sauce correctly ensures your marinades, glazes, and sauces hit the right notes. For dishes like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>air fryer chicken wings</a>, the perfect soy sauce ratio is key to achieving that crispy, flavourful finish.</p>  

<h2>Converting 360 ml of Soy Sauce for Different Recipes</h2>  
<p>Whether you're baking, stir-frying, or marinating, 360 ml of soy sauce can be used in various ways. In baking, it might be part of a glaze for <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/salmon>air fryer salmon</a>, while in stir-fries, it could be the base of your sauce. Knowing that 360 ml equals 1.5 US cups or 1.27 UK cups helps you follow recipes accurately. If you're scaling up or down, use a simple ratio: 120 ml equals 0.5 US cups or 0.42 UK cups.</p>  

<p>For those who love experimenting, try using 360 ml of soy sauce in a homemade teriyaki mix. Combine it with honey, garlic, and ginger for a delicious marinade. Don't forget to clean your air fryer afterward with <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>our recommended cleaner</a> to prevent lingering odours. Precision in measurement leads to better results, whether you're cooking for one or a crowd.</p>  

<h3>Common Mistakes When Measuring Soy Sauce</h3>  
<p>One of the biggest mistakes is using dry measuring cups for liquids like soy sauce. This can lead to inaccurate measurements, as liquids settle differently. Always use a liquid measuring jug for 360 ml of soy sauce to ensure you're getting the right amount. Another pitfall is forgetting to account for the difference between US and UK cups, which can throw off your recipe. Double-check your measurements to avoid disappointment.</p>

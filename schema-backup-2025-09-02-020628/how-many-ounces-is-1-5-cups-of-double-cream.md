<p>1.5 cups of double cream equals approximately 12 ounces (340 grams). This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements ensure perfect textures and results. Whether you're making a rich dessert or a creamy sauce, knowing how to convert cups to ounces helps avoid kitchen mishaps.</p>

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on even cooking, and incorrect ingredient quantities can throw off your dish. Too much double cream might make a recipe overly rich or soggy, while too little could leave it dry. Measuring 1.5 cups of double cream correctly (12 ounces) ensures consistency, especially for recipes like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer custards</a> or creamy pasta bakes.</p>  

<p>Using a kitchen scale for ounces is more precise than cup measurements, as double cream’s density can vary slightly. For UK cooks, 1.5 cups of double cream is roughly 12 fluid ounces by volume but weighs about 12 ounces (340g) by weight. This distinction matters when following <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion charts</a>.</p>  

<h3>How to measure double cream for air fryer recipes</h3>  
<p>For best results, use a liquid measuring cup for volume or a digital scale for weight. Spoon the cream into the cup without packing it down, and level it off. If your air fryer recipe calls for 1.5 cups of double cream (12 ounces), weigh it for accuracy. This method works perfectly for <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>air fryer desserts</a> like cheesecakes or mousses.</p>  

<h2>Common recipes using 1.5 cups of double cream</h2>  
<p>Many air fryer dishes use this quantity, from creamy soups to indulgent sauces. For example, a classic <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>air fryer chicken Alfredo</a> might require 1.5 cups of double cream (12 ounces) for a silky texture. Similarly, desserts like chocolate ganache or ice cream bases rely on this measurement.</p>  

<p>If you’re adapting a traditional recipe for the air fryer, converting 1.5 cups of double cream to ounces ensures it cooks evenly. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning tips</a> to keep your appliance in top shape after working with creamy ingredients.</p>  

<h3>Tips for substituting double cream in air fryer recipes</h3>  
<p>If you’re out of double cream, heavy cream or evaporated milk can work, but adjust the ounces accordingly. For 1.5 cups (12 ounces) of double cream, use the same volume of heavy cream, but note it has slightly less fat. Always check your air fryer’s manual for dairy-based recipe guidelines.</p>

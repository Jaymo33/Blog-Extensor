<p>1.5 cups of ground almonds equals approximately 6 ounces (170 grams). This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes, ensuring your dishes turn out perfectly every time. Whether you're making almond-crusted chicken or a gluten-free cake, precise measurements matter.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of ground almonds can make or break your air fryer recipes. Too much can dry out your dish, while too little may not provide the desired texture. Air fryers cook food quickly, so ingredient ratios are crucial. For example, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>almond-crusted salmon recipe</a> relies on this exact conversion for perfect crispiness.</p>  

<p>Ground almonds add a nutty flavour and help bind ingredients in gluten-free baking. If you're converting from cups to ounces, always use a kitchen scale for the best results. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more handy measurements.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure Ground Almonds Correctly</h3>  
<p>To measure 1.5 cups of ground almonds accurately, spoon the almonds into a measuring cup and level it off. Avoid packing them down, as this can lead to an incorrect weight. If you're using a scale, 6 ounces (170 grams) is your target.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for Ground Almonds in Air Fryer Recipes</h2>  
<p>Ground almonds are versatile in air fryer cooking. They work well as a coating for meats, like in our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>almond-crusted chicken recipes</a>, or as a flour substitute in baking. Their high-fat content helps create a crispy texture, perfect for air frying.</p>  

<p>You can also use ground almonds in desserts, such as air-fried almond cakes or cookies. For more inspiration, browse our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert category</a> for delicious almond-based treats.</p>  

<h3>Converting Other Almond Measurements</h3>  
<p>If you need to adjust your recipe, remember that 1 cup of ground almonds equals 4 ounces (113 grams). This makes scaling recipes up or down simple. Always double-check conversions to avoid mishaps, especially when baking.</p>  

<h2>Tips for Storing Ground Almonds</h2>  
<p>Ground almonds can go rancid quickly due to their high oil content. Store them in an airtight container in a cool, dark place or the fridge. For longer storage, freeze them in portions. This ensures your 1.5 cups (6 ounces) stay fresh for future air fryer creations.</p>  

<p>If you're unsure about freshness, give them a quick sniff—rancid almonds have a sharp, unpleasant odour. For more storage tips, visit <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>.</p>  

<h3>Buying Ground Almonds vs. Grinding Your Own</h3>  
<p>Pre-ground almonds are convenient, but grinding your own ensures maximum freshness. Use a food processor to pulse whole almonds until finely ground. Just be careful not to over-process, or you’ll end up with almond butter!</p>

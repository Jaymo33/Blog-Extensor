<p>85 ml of beef stock is approximately 0.36 cups. This conversion is essential for recipes requiring precise measurements, especially when using an air fryer. Whether you're making a rich gravy or a savoury stew, knowing how to convert 85 ml of beef stock to cups ensures consistency. For more air fryer-friendly recipes, visit <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes</a>.</p>  

<h2>Understanding the Conversion</h2>  
<p>Converting 85 ml of beef stock to cups is straightforward once you know the ratio. One standard cup equals 236.59 ml, so dividing 85 ml by this number gives you roughly 0.36 cups. This measurement is particularly useful for air fryer recipes, where precision can affect cooking times and results. If you're unsure, refer to our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for quick reference.</p>  

<p>Many recipes, especially those for air fryers, list ingredients in millilitres or cups. Knowing how to switch between the two ensures you never miss a beat in the kitchen. For example, if a recipe calls for 85 ml of beef stock, you can confidently measure out 0.36 cups instead. This flexibility is handy when scaling recipes up or down.</p>  

<h3>Why Accuracy Matters in Air Fryer Cooking</h3>  
<p>Air fryers rely on precise measurements to deliver even cooking and perfect textures. Using too much or too little liquid, like beef stock, can alter the outcome of your dish. For instance, 85 ml of beef stock in a marinade might need adjusting if the recipe expects cups. Always double-check conversions to avoid soggy or dry results.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for 85 ml of Beef Stock</h2>  
<p>Beef stock is a versatile ingredient, and 85 ml is often used in small batches of sauces, gravies, or marinades. In air fryer cooking, this amount might be used to baste meats or enhance the flavour of roasted vegetables. For inspiration, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/beef>beef recipe category</a>.</p>  

<p>Another popular use for 85 ml of beef stock is in deglazing pans or creating reductions. The concentrated flavour of beef stock can elevate even simple dishes. Whether you're making a quick jus or a hearty stew, knowing the cup equivalent of 85 ml ensures you get the ratios right every time.</p>  

<h3>Tips for Measuring Beef Stock</h3>  
<p>When measuring 85 ml of beef stock, use a liquid measuring cup for accuracy. If you don’t have one, a standard kitchen scale can help—85 ml of beef stock weighs roughly 85 grams. For more tips on kitchen measurements, check out our guide on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>keeping your air fryer tools in top shape</a>.</p>  

<h2>Converting Other Beef Stock Measurements</h2>  
<p>If your recipe calls for more or less than 85 ml of beef stock, the same conversion principle applies. For example, 170 ml would be roughly 0.72 cups, while 42.5 ml would be about 0.18 cups. Having these conversions at your fingertips makes adapting recipes a breeze.</p>  

<p>Remember, air fryer recipes often require adjustments for smaller quantities. If you’re halving a recipe that uses 85 ml of beef stock, you’d need 0.18 cups instead. Keeping a conversion chart handy, like the one on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, can save time and reduce errors.</p>

<p>960 ml of lime juice equals approximately 4.06 cups. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes that require precise measurements, ensuring your dishes turn out perfectly balanced every time. Whether you're making a citrusy marinade for chicken or a refreshing lime-infused dessert, knowing how to convert millilitres to cups is a game-changer. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we help simplify cooking conversions so you can focus on creating delicious meals.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Lime Juice Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of lime juice can make or break a recipe. Too little, and your dish might lack that vibrant tang; too much, and it could become overpowering. For air fryer recipes like citrus-glazed salmon or lime-marinated shrimp, precision is key. A handy <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a> can save you time and ensure consistency. Whether you're cooking for a family dinner or meal prepping, accurate measurements lead to better results.</p>  

<p>Lime juice is also a popular ingredient in baking, where exact ratios are crucial. If you're making lime-infused cakes or cookies in your air fryer, 960 ml of lime juice translates to roughly 4 cups plus a tablespoon. This level of detail ensures your baked goods have the perfect balance of acidity and sweetness. For more baking inspiration, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>air fryer cake recipes</a>.</p>  

<h3>US vs. UK Cup Measurements</h3>  
<p>It's worth noting that US and UK cup measurements differ slightly. In the US, 1 cup equals 240 ml, while in the UK, it's 250 ml. For 960 ml of lime juice, this means approximately 4 US cups or 3.84 UK cups. Always double-check which measurement system your recipe uses to avoid discrepancies. If you're unsure, <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> provides clear guidance for both systems.</p>  

<h2>How to Measure Lime Juice Without a Measuring Cup</h2>  
<p>Don't have a measuring cup handy? No problem. A standard lime yields about 2 tablespoons (30 ml) of juice, so 960 ml would require roughly 32 limes. While this method isn't as precise, it's a handy backup for quick recipes. For best results, though, investing in a good measuring jug or digital scale is ideal. If you're prepping a large batch of lime-based dishes, like our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/mixed-seafood>citrus seafood recipes</a>, accuracy ensures consistent flavour.</p>  

<p>Another tip is to use a liquid measuring cup with clear markings for millilitres and cups. Pour the lime juice slowly to avoid spills and check at eye level for the most accurate reading. If you're working with bottled lime juice, shake it well before measuring to ensure an even consistency.

<h3>Common Recipes Using 960 ml of Lime Juice</h3>  
<p>960 ml of lime juice is often used in large-batch recipes like ceviche, margarita mixes, or tangy salad dressings. In the air fryer, it's perfect for marinating proteins like chicken or fish, infusing them with bright, zesty flavours. Whether you're cooking for a crowd or stocking up on meal-prep favourites, this quantity ensures you won't run short.

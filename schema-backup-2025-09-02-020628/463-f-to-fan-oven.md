<p>463 F converts to approximately 240 C in a fan oven. This is the standard conversion for recipes requiring high-heat cooking, especially when using air fryers or convection ovens. Whether you're roasting, baking, or air frying, getting the temperature right ensures perfect results every time.</p>

<h2>Why Convert 463 F to Fan Oven?</h2>
<p>Fan ovens circulate hot air for even cooking, similar to air fryers. Converting 463 F ensures your dishes cook uniformly without burning. Many air fryer recipes, especially those from the US, list temperatures in Fahrenheit. Our <a href="https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart">air fryer conversion chart</a> simplifies this process for UK cooks.</p>
<p>High temperatures like 463 F are common for crispy foods. Think roasted vegetables, chicken wings, or even baked goods. Using the correct fan oven setting prevents undercooking or drying out your meals. For more recipe ideas, check out our <a href="https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken">chicken recipes</a> section.</p>

<h2>How to Adjust Cooking Times</h2>
<p>Fan ovens cook faster than conventional ovens. At 240 C (463 F), reduce cooking times by 10-15%. For air fryers, which are even more efficient, monitor your food closely. A recipe calling for 20 minutes at 463 F might only need 15 in an air fryer.</p>
<p>Always preheat your fan oven or air fryer for best results. This ensures the temperature is stable before cooking. For frozen foods, our <a href="https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/frozen-foods">frozen foods guide</a> offers tailored advice.</p>

<h3>Common Dishes at 463 F</h3>
<p>This temperature is ideal for crispy roast potatoes, homemade pizza, or searing meats. The high heat creates a golden crust while keeping interiors juicy. Explore our <a href="https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes">recipe collection</a> for inspiration.</p>

<h2>Air Fryer vs Fan Oven at 463 F</h2>
<p>Air fryers use rapid air technology, mimicking fan ovens but in a compact space. Cooking at 463 F (240 C) in an air fryer yields crispier results faster. However, portion sizes are smaller compared to fan ovens.</p>
<p>For larger batches, a fan oven might be more practical. But for quick, crispy meals, air fryers excel. Need cleaning tips? Visit our <a href="https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner">cleaning guide</a> to keep your appliance in top shape.</p>

<h3>Safety Tips for High-Temp Cooking</h3>
<p>Always use oven mitts when handling dishes at 463 F. Avoid overcrowding your air fryer basket to ensure proper air circulation. Check food regularly to prevent burning, especially with sugary or fatty ingredients.</p>

<p>0.125 cup of maple syrup equals approximately 1 ounce (1 oz). This conversion is handy for air fryer recipes where precise measurements matter. Whether you're drizzling syrup over air-fried pancakes or using it as a glaze, knowing the exact weight ensures perfect results every time.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>When using an air fryer, precise ingredient measurements can make or break a dish. Too much maple syrup can lead to overly sticky or burnt results, while too little might leave your food lacking flavour. For recipes like air-fried French toast or glazed salmon, 0.125 cup of maple syrup (1 oz) is often the perfect amount. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more handy measurement tips.</p>  

<p>Maple syrup’s viscosity means volume-to-weight conversions aren’t always straightforward. Unlike water, where 1 cup equals 8 fluid ounces, maple syrup is denser. That’s why weighing ingredients like 0.125 cup of maple syrup in ounces (1 oz) ensures consistency.

<h3>How to Measure 0.125 Cup of Maple Syrup</h3>

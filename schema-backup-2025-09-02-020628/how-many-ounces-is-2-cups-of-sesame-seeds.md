<p>2 cups of sesame seeds weigh approximately 10 ounces (283 grams). This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes, ensuring accurate measurements for perfect results. Whether you're making sesame-crusted chicken or toasted sesame snacks, knowing the weight helps avoid under or over-seasoning. For more air fryer conversions, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air frying</h2>  
<p>Using the correct amount of sesame seeds ensures even cooking and flavour distribution in your air fryer. Too many seeds can lead to uneven toasting, while too few might leave your dish lacking in crunch. For recipes like sesame-crusted tofu or crispy salmon, precision is key. Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> for inspiration on using sesame seeds creatively.</p>  

<p>Air fryers circulate hot air, so ingredients like sesame seeds toast quickly. Measuring by weight (ounces) rather than volume (cups) guarantees consistency. This is especially useful for batch cooking or meal prepping. If you're new to air frying, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable recipes</a> are a great starting point.</p>  

<h3>How to measure sesame seeds for air frying</h3>  
<p>For best results, use a kitchen scale to weigh your sesame seeds in ounces. If you don't have one, lightly spoon the seeds into a measuring cup without packing them down. Remember that 2 cups of sesame seeds equal roughly 10 ounces. This method works for both white and black sesame seeds in air fryer recipes.</p>  

<h2>Converting 2 cups of sesame seeds to ounces UK</h2>  
<p>In UK measurements, 2 cups of sesame seeds still convert to approximately 10 ounces. The slight variation in cup sizes between US and UK measurements doesn't significantly affect lightweight ingredients like seeds. For international cooks using air fryers, this standard conversion simplifies recipe following. Discover more tips in our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning guide</a> to maintain your appliance.</p>  

<p>When adapting recipes from different countries, weight measurements (ounces) are more reliable than volume (cups). This ensures your sesame-crusted dishes turn out perfectly every time in the air fryer. Whether making Asian-inspired chicken or Middle Eastern breads, accurate conversions matter. Try our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipes</a> for delicious sesame-coated options.</p>  

<h3>Common uses for 2 cups of sesame seeds in air fryers</h3>  
<p>Two cups (10 ounces) of sesame seeds are perfect for coating multiple portions of protein or making large batches of granola. The air fryer toasts them evenly, enhancing their nutty flavour without burning. This quantity works well for family meals or meal prepping several dishes at once.</p>

<p>0.75 tbsp of greek yogurt equals approximately 11.25 grams. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precision matters, especially when baking or marinating. Whether you're whipping up a quick breakfast or a creamy dessert, knowing the exact weight ensures consistent results every time.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on even cooking, and incorrect measurements can throw off textures and flavours. Greek yogurt is often used in marinades, dips, or even as a substitute for heavier ingredients like cream. For example, if you're making a <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>healthy air fryer chicken recipe</a>, the right amount of yogurt ensures tenderness without excess moisture.</p>  

<p>Many air fryer recipes, especially those for cakes or muffins, require precise ratios. Too much or too little yogurt can affect rise and texture. That’s why converting 0.75 tbsp of greek yogurt to grams (11.25g) helps maintain balance. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more handy measurements.</p>  

<h3>How to measure 0.75 tbsp of greek yogurt without scales</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a digital scale, use a standard UK tablespoon (15ml) and fill it halfway for 0.75 tbsp. Greek yogurt is thick, so levelling it off with a knife ensures accuracy. For recipes like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>air fryer desserts</a>, even small deviations can alter outcomes.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for 0.75 tbsp of greek yogurt in air fryer recipes</h2>  
<p>This small but mighty measurement pops up in many dishes. A dollop can enrich sauces, tenderise meats, or add moisture to baked goods. For instance, 0.75 tbsp of greek yogurt (11.25g) might be used in a single-serving <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/breakfast>air fryer breakfast muffin</a> to keep it light yet fluffy.</p>  

<p>It’s also perfect for marinades—just mix with herbs and spices for a quick coating. Whether you’re cooking <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>air fryer chicken wings</a> or roasted veggies, the right amount ensures flavour without sogginess. Always clean your air fryer after using yogurt-based mixes—our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning guide</a> makes it easy.</p>  

<h3>Converting other yogurt amounts to grams</h3>  
<p>If your recipe calls for 1 tbsp, that’s roughly 15g. For larger batches, scale up proportionally—e.g., 3 tbsp = 45g. Consistency matters, so stick to the same brand of greek yogurt for reliable results. Different brands may vary slightly in density.</p>

<p>2.5 cups of coconut oil equals approximately 20 ounces. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes, where precise measurements can make or break your dish. Whether you’re baking, frying, or roasting, knowing the exact weight ensures consistent results every time. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we help simplify these conversions so you can cook with confidence.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of coconut oil in your air fryer ensures even cooking and prevents sticking. Too little oil can leave food dry, while too much may make it greasy. For recipes like crispy chicken or roasted vegetables, 2.5 cups of coconut oil (20 ounces) is often ideal.

<h3>How to Measure Coconut Oil Correctly</h3>  
<p>When measuring coconut oil, always use a liquid measuring cup for accuracy. If your recipe calls for 2.5 cups (20 ounces), ensure the oil is melted for an even pour. Solid coconut oil can be tricky to measure, so warming it slightly helps.

<h2>Common Uses for Coconut Oil in Air Fryers</h2>  
<p>Coconut oil works wonders in air fryers, from greasing baskets to coating foods for extra crispiness. Recipes like air-fried shrimp or tofu often require 2.5 cups (20 ounces) for optimal results. Its mild flavour also makes it great for baking—try it in cookies or cakes for a healthier twist.</p>

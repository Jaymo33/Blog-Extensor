Rapeseed oil is ideal for air frying because it has a high smoke point (around 230°C), making it less likely to burn. Adjust quantities slightly as different oils have varying densities."

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>
<p>Using the right amount of oil is crucial in air fryer cooking. Too little, and your food might turn out dry; too much, and it could become greasy. Converting 1.5 tbsp of rapeseed oil to grams (20g) helps you strike the perfect balance. Rapeseed oil is a popular choice for air frying due to its high smoke point and neutral flavour, making it ideal for everything from roasting vegetables to frying fish. For more tips on perfecting your air fryer meals, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipes</a> section.</p>

<p>Many air fryer recipes call for small amounts of oil, often measured in tablespoons. However, kitchen scales measure in grams, so knowing how to convert 1.5 tbsp of rapeseed oil into grams simplifies the process. This is especially handy if you’re following a recipe from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> or adjusting quantities for smaller or larger batches. Accurate measurements ensure your dishes are cooked evenly and taste just as they should.</p>

<h2>How to Measure 1.5 tbsp of Rapeseed Oil Without Scales</h2>
<p>If you don’t have kitchen scales, you can still measure 1.5 tbsp of rapeseed oil accurately. A standard UK tablespoon holds 15ml of liquid, so 1.5 tbsp would be 22.5ml. Since rapeseed oil has a density of about 0.92g/ml, this translates to roughly 20 grams. For a visual guide, 1.5 tbsp is about the size of a ping-pong ball. This method is handy when you’re in a pinch, but investing in a set of digital scales will give you the most precise results for your air fryer cooking.</p>

<h3>Common Uses for 1.5 tbsp of Rapeseed Oil in Air Fryer Recipes</h3>
<p>1.5 tbsp (20g) of rapeseed oil is often used to coat vegetables like potatoes or Brussels sprouts before air frying. It’s also perfect for lightly greasing the air fryer basket to prevent sticking. If you’re making crispy chicken wings or tofu, this amount of oil helps achieve that golden, crunchy exterior.

<h2>Converting Other Oil Measurements for Your Air Fryer</h2>
<p>While this guide focuses on converting 1.5 tbsp of rapeseed oil to grams, you might need to adjust other measurements too. For example, 1 tbsp of rapeseed oil is about 13.3g, and 2 tbsp is roughly 26.6g. Keeping a <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a> handy can save time and ensure your air fryer meals are consistently delicious. Remember, different oils have slightly different densities, so these conversions are specific to rapeseed oil.</p>

<h3>Tips for Storing and Using Rapeseed Oil in Air Fryer Cooking</h3>
<p>To keep your rapeseed oil fresh, store it in a cool, dark place away from direct sunlight. Always check the expiry date, as rancid oil can ruin your dishes.

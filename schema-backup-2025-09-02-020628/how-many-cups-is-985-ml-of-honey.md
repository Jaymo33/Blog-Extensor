<p>985 ml of honey equals approximately 4.15 cups in the US measurement system and 3.46 cups in the UK system. Whether you're baking a cake or preparing a glaze for your air fryer chicken, accurate measurements are key. Honey's thick consistency makes it tricky to measure, but this guide simplifies the process for you.</p>

<h2>Understanding Honey Measurements</h2>
<p>Honey is denser than water, so its volume-to-weight ratio differs. While 985 ml of water would be easier to measure, honey requires a bit more precision. For air fryer recipes, especially glazes or marinades, getting the right amount ensures perfect results every time. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more handy tips.</p>
<p>In the US, a standard cup holds 240 ml, whereas a UK cup is 284 ml. This difference means 985 ml of honey translates to roughly 4.15 US cups or 3.46 UK cups. Always consider which measurement system your recipe uses to avoid mistakes. For more delicious ideas, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a>.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter</h2>
<p>Using too much or too little honey can throw off the balance of your dish. In baking, excess honey can make desserts overly sweet or sticky, while too little might leave them dry. For air fryer cooking, precise measurements ensure even coating and caramelisation. Visit our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert category</a> for honey-infused treats.</p>
<p>Honey's viscosity means it doesn't pour like water, so levelling off your measuring cup is essential. For sticky ingredients like honey, lightly greasing your measuring cup can help it slide out more easily. This trick is especially useful when preparing marinades for <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>air fryer chicken recipes</a>.</p>

<h3>Tools for Measuring Honey</h3>
<p>A liquid measuring cup with clear markings is ideal for measuring 985 ml of honey. For smaller quantities, use measuring spoons, but remember that 985 ml is best measured in cups. Digital kitchen scales can also help, especially if your recipe provides weight measurements. Keep your tools clean with our recommended <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner</a>.</p>

<h2>Converting 985 ml of Honey in Different Systems</h2>
<p>The US customary system and UK imperial system use different cup sizes, which affects how you measure 985 ml of honey. In the US, 1 cup equals 240 ml, making 985 ml roughly 4.15 cups. In the UK, where 1 cup is 284 ml, 985 ml equals about 3.46 cups. Always check which system your recipe follows.</p>
<p>For international recipes, especially those from Australia or Canada, note that they may use either system. When in doubt, refer to the recipe's origin or look for clarification in the instructions. This attention to detail will elevate your <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>air fryer cake recipes</a>.</p>

<h3>Tips for Measuring Sticky Honey</h3>
<p>To measure 985 ml of honey without waste, lightly coat your measuring cup with oil or cooking spray first. The honey will slide out more easily, giving you an accurate measurement. For precise baking, consider weighing your honey instead, as 985 ml of honey weighs approximately 1.36 kg.</p>

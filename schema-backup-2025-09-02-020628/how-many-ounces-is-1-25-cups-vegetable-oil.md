<p>1.25 cups of vegetable oil equals 10 ounces. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes, where precise measurements can make or break your dish. Whether you’re frying chicken, roasting vegetables, or baking, knowing how many ounces are in 1.25 cups of vegetable oil ensures consistent results.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on even heat distribution, and using the right amount of oil is crucial. Too much oil can lead to soggy food, while too little may cause dryness. For example, when making crispy <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/potatoes>air fryer potatoes</a>, 1.25 cups of vegetable oil (10 ounces) ensures a perfect golden finish. Check our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for other common measurements.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure Vegetable Oil Correctly</h3>  
<p>Use a liquid measuring cup for accuracy. Pour the oil slowly to the 1.25-cup mark, ensuring no air bubbles. If you’re converting to ounces, a kitchen scale is handy. For more tips, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> section.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for 1.25 Cups of Vegetable Oil in Air Fryers</h2>  
<p>This measurement is ideal for batch cooking or larger recipes. For instance, 1.25 cups (10 ounces) of vegetable oil works well for frying multiple portions of <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>air fryer chicken</a>. It’s also great for marinating or coating foods before air frying.</p>  

<h3>Converting Other Oil Measurements</h3>

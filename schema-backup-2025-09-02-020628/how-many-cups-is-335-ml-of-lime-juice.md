<p>335 ml of lime juice equals approximately 1.42 cups in UK measurements or 1.41 cups in US measurements. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes that require precise liquid measurements to achieve the best results. Whether you’re making marinades, dressings, or desserts, knowing how to convert millilitres to cups ensures your dish turns out perfectly every time.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Lime Juice Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of lime juice can make or break a recipe. Too little, and your dish might lack tanginess; too much, and it could become overpowering. For air fryer recipes, precise measurements are even more critical because the cooking process is faster and more intense. A slight imbalance can affect texture, flavour, and overall success. That’s why converting 335 ml of lime juice to cups correctly is so important.</p>  

<p>At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we emphasise the importance of accurate conversions for consistent results. Whether you’re following a zesty <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipe</a> or a refreshing dessert, getting the lime juice measurement right ensures balanced flavours. Plus, it helps avoid wasted ingredients and disappointing outcomes.</p>  

<h2>How to Measure 335 ml of Lime Juice</h2>  
<p>Measuring lime juice accurately doesn’t have to be complicated. If you don’t have a measuring jug, you can use standard cups. For 335 ml of lime juice, you’ll need just over 1 and 1/3 cups in both UK and US measurements. However, slight variations exist due to differences in cup sizes, so always double-check if precision is crucial.</p>  

<h3>Using a Measuring Jug</h3>  
<p>The easiest way to measure 335 ml of lime juice is with a liquid measuring jug. Simply pour the juice up to the 335 ml mark, and you’re good to go. This method eliminates guesswork and ensures your air fryer recipes turn out as intended. If you’re scaling a recipe, a jug also makes it simple to adjust quantities without errors.</p>  

<h3>Converting for Baking vs. Cooking</h3>  
<p>Baking often requires stricter precision than cooking, as chemical reactions depend on exact measurements. If your <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert recipe</a> calls for 335 ml of lime juice, stick to the exact conversion. For marinades or sauces, you can be slightly more flexible, but accuracy still helps achieve the best flavour balance.</p>  

<h2>Common Recipes Using 335 ml of Lime Juice</h2>  
<p>Many air fryer recipes benefit from the bright, tangy flavour of lime juice. From marinades to glazes, 335 ml is a common quantity in larger batches. For example, a citrusy <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/shrimp>shrimp recipe</a> might use this amount for a family-sized portion. Knowing the cup equivalent helps streamline your prep.</p>  

<p>Another popular use is in dressings or dips. If you’re making a lime-infused yoghurt sauce or a zesty drizzle for tacos, 335 ml of lime juice converts neatly to cups for easy mixing. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more handy measurement tips.</p>  

<h2>Adjusting Recipes for Different Servings</h2>  
<p>If your recipe serves four but you’re cooking for two, you might need to halve 335 ml of lime juice. In cups, that’s roughly 0.7 cups (UK) or 0.705 cups (US). Conversely, doubling the recipe would require about 2.84 cups (UK) or 2.82 cups (US). Keeping these conversions handy saves time and ensures consistency.</p>  

<h3>Storing Leftover Lime Juice</h3>  
<p>If you don’t use all 335 ml of lime juice, store it properly to maintain freshness. Transfer it to an airtight container and refrigerate for up to a week. You can also freeze lime juice in ice cube trays for future use in <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a>, ensuring no waste.</p>

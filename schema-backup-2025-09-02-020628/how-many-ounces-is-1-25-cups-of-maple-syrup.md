<p>1.25 cups of maple syrup equals 10 fluid ounces (fl oz) or approximately 10.6 ounces (oz) by weight. Whether you’re drizzling it over air-fried pancakes or glazing salmon, precise measurements ensure perfect results every time. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we know how crucial accurate conversions are for nailing air fryer recipes.</p>  

<h2>Understanding Maple Syrup Measurements</h2>  
<p>Maple syrup is thicker than water, so its volume-to-weight conversion differs slightly. While 1 cup of water equals 8 fluid ounces, 1 cup of maple syrup weighs around 11.2 ounces due to its density. For 1.25 cups, that’s roughly 10 fluid ounces or 10.6 ounces by weight. This distinction matters in baking and glazing, where consistency affects texture.</p>  

<p>If you’re working with UK measurements, note that 1 UK cup equals 10 UK fluid ounces, but maple syrup’s weight remains similar. For air fryer recipes like sticky <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken wings</a>, precision ensures even caramelisation. Check our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a> for other common ingredients.</p>  

<h3>Why Measure Maple Syrup Accurately?</h3>  
<p>Too much syrup can make dishes overly sweet or soggy, while too little might lack flavour. For example, air-fried <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>desserts</a> like apple crisps rely on balanced sweetness. A kitchen scale is ideal, but if using cups, spoon the syrup in gently to avoid air gaps.</p>  

<h2>Converting 1.25 Cups of Maple Syrup to Ounces</h2>  
<p>Here’s a quick reference: 1.25 US cups of maple syrup = 10 fl oz (volume) or ~10.6 oz (weight). For UK cooks, 1.25 UK cups ≈ 12.5 fl oz, but weight remains ~10.6 oz. Always clarify whether your recipe uses volume or weight measurements to avoid mishaps.</p>  

<p>Need to scale up? Two cups equal 16 fl oz or ~17.6 oz by weight. For smaller batches, 0.5 cups = 4 fl oz (~4.4 oz).

<h3>Tips for Using Maple Syrup in Air Fryers</h3>  
<p>Thin syrups with a splash of water to prevent burning. Brush meats or veggies lightly, and rotate trays for even coverage. For sticky residues, try our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning guide</a>.</p>

<p>1.5 cups of baking powder equals approximately 12 ounces (oz) in UK measurements. This conversion is essential for precise baking, especially when using an air fryer where ingredient ratios can make or break a recipe. Whether you’re whipping up cakes or savoury dishes, knowing the exact weight ensures consistent results. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we focus on helping you master measurements for flawless cooking.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer baking</h2>  
<p>Baking powder is a leavening agent, and using the wrong amount can lead to dense or overly puffed dishes. In an air fryer, where heat circulates rapidly, precise measurements are even more critical. Too much baking powder can cause uneven rising, while too little may leave your bakes flat. For perfect results, always measure by weight when possible. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for other common ingredient conversions.</p>  

<p>Many air fryer recipes, like those in our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>cake category</a>, rely on exact ratios. A slight deviation can alter texture and taste. If you’re converting from volume (cups) to weight (ounces), a kitchen scale is your best friend. This is especially true for UK bakers, where cup sizes can vary slightly from US standards.</p>  

<h3>How to measure 1.5 cups of baking powder correctly</h3>  
<p>To measure 1.5 cups of baking powder accurately, fluff the powder first with a spoon to avoid compacting it. Then, lightly spoon it into a measuring cup and level it off with a straight edge. For the most precise results, weigh it on a digital scale—12 ounces is your target. This method eliminates guesswork and ensures your air fryer recipes turn out perfectly every time.</p>  

<h2>Common baking powder conversions for air fryer recipes</h2>  
<p>Beyond 1.5 cups, here are other handy conversions for baking powder: 1 cup equals 8 ounces, and 0.5 cups equal 4 ounces. These measurements are useful when scaling recipes up or down for your air fryer. If you’re preparing smaller batches, like cookies from our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cookies>cookie category</a>, these conversions will come in handy.</p>  

<p>Remember, baking powder’s effectiveness can diminish over time. Always check the expiry date before use. If your bakes aren’t rising as expected, your baking powder might need replacing.

<h3>Adjusting recipes for different air fryer models</h3>  
<p>Not all air fryers cook the same way. Some models have stronger fans or varying heat distributions, which can affect baking times. If you’re adapting a recipe, start with the correct 1.5 cups (12 ounces) of baking powder, then tweak cooking times as needed.

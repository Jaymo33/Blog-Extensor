<p>2.5 cups of raisins equals approximately 12.5 ounces. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements can make or break your dish. Whether you're baking raisin cookies or adding them to a savoury dish, knowing the weight ensures consistency.

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on even cooking, and incorrect measurements can lead to uneven results. Raisins, for example, can clump or burn if not distributed properly. Using the right amount ensures your food cooks evenly and tastes perfect. Visit <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> for more tips on perfecting your air fryer meals.</p>  

<p>Many recipes call for raisins by weight rather than volume, especially in baking. Converting 2.5 cups of raisins to ounces helps you follow these recipes accurately. This is particularly useful for <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>air fryer cakes</a> or desserts where precision is key.</p>  

<h3>How to measure raisins correctly</h3>  
<p>For the most accurate conversion, use a kitchen scale to weigh your raisins. Scooping them directly from the bag can lead to inconsistent amounts due to settling. Fluff the raisins lightly before measuring to ensure an even distribution in your cup.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for raisins in air fryer recipes</h2>  
<p>Raisins add sweetness and texture to both sweet and savoury dishes. They work wonderfully in <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cookies>air fryer cookies</a>, granola, or even stuffed meats. Knowing how many ounces are in 2.5 cups helps you adapt recipes to your air fryer's capacity.</p>  

<p>You can also use raisins in breakfast dishes like oatmeal or <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/breakfast>air fryer breakfast bakes</a>. Their natural sweetness means you can often reduce added sugars in recipes. Just remember to account for their moisture content when adjusting cooking times.</p>  

<h3>Storing raisins for air fryer use</h3>  
<p>Keep raisins in an airtight container to maintain freshness. If they dry out, soak them briefly in warm water before use. This plumps them up, making them perfect for air frying without burning.</p>

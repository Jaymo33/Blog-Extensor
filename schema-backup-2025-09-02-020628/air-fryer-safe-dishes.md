<p id="">Not all dishes are safe for air fryers – only heat-resistant materials like ceramic, metal, and certain silicones should be used. Using the wrong containers could damage your appliance or even release harmful chemicals into your food. At <a href="https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/" id="">airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we frequently get asked about which dishes work best, so let’s clear up the confusion.</p><h2 id="">Can You Put a Casserole Dish in an Air Fryer?</h2><p id="">Ceramic and stoneware casserole dishes are generally safe if they fit inside your air fryer basket. The key is ensuring they’re oven-safe, as these materials can typically withstand air fryer temperatures up to 200°C. Always check for any manufacturer warnings before using your favourite casserole dish. For perfect portion control, consider smaller ramekins from our <a href="https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/meal-prep" id="">meal prep recipes</a> collection. Avoid dishes with metallic trim or delicate glazes that might crack under rapid heat changes.</p><p id="">Glass casserole dishes require extra caution – only use ones specifically labelled as thermal shock-resistant. Pyrex and similar brands often work well, but never place cold glass directly into a hot air fryer. Preheat both the air fryer and dish gradually to prevent shattering. Our <a href="https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes" id="">recipe section</a> includes several casserole ideas perfect for these dishes.</p><h2 id="">Can You Put a Plate in an Air Fryer?</h2><p id="">Most everyday plates aren’t designed for air fryer use – they can crack or even explode under high heat. However, some stoneware or porcelain plates marked as oven-safe may work if they fit properly. Always verify the maximum temperature rating matches your air fryer’s capabilities. For safer alternatives, consider using air fryer parchment liners or silicone mats from our <a href="https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner" id="">cleaning accessories</a> range.</p><p id="">Small appetizer plates or saucers sometimes work for single servings, but ensure there’s at least 2-3cm clearance around all sides for proper airflow. Never stack plates in the air fryer, as this blocks circulation and creates uneven cooking. If you’re reheating plate-sized items, it’s better to use an air fryer-safe tray or rack instead.</p><h3 id="">What About Plastic Containers?</h3><p id="">Never put plastic in an air fryer unless it’s specifically labelled as air fryer-safe. Most plastics melt at temperatures above 160°C, potentially ruining your appliance and contaminating food. Even microwave-safe plastics usually can’t handle the direct heat of an air fryer. For meal prep storage that transitions to cooking, use glass or silicone containers instead.</p><h2 id="">What Containers Can You Use in an Air Fryer?</h2><p id="">Metal pans and baskets designed for air fryers are always safe choices, especially for crispy foods like our <a href="https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/potatoes" id="">potato recipes</a>. Look for stainless steel or aluminium with proper ventilation holes. Silicone molds and liners work brilliantly for muffins, eggs, or delicate items – just ensure they’re food-grade and heat-resistant to at least 230°C.</p><p id="">Parchment paper rounds (not wax paper) can be used for certain recipes, but must be weighted down with food to prevent flying. Always trim the paper to fit without blocking airflow vents. For converting traditional oven recipes, our <a href="https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart" id="">conversion chart</a> helps adjust times and temperatures for these different containers.</p><h3 id="">Specialty Air Fryer Accessories</h3><p id="">Many brands now offer dedicated air fryer-safe dishes like pizza pans, grill plates, and even cake tins. These are designed with proper airflow and heat distribution in mind. While pricier than repurposing household items, they often yield better results and are worth considering for frequent air fryer users.</p><p id="">Remember that regardless of material, any dish must leave adequate space for air circulation – generally at least 25% of the basket should remain clear. Overcrowding leads to uneven cooking and defeats the purpose of your air fryer. With the right air fryer safe dishes, you can expand your cooking repertoire while keeping your appliance in top condition.</p>

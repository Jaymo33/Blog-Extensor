<p>960 ml of olive oil equals approximately 4.06 cups. This conversion is essential for precise cooking, especially when using an air fryer where measurements can affect texture and crispiness. Whether you're following a recipe from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> or improvising, knowing this conversion ensures consistent results every time.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Olive Oil Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of olive oil in your air fryer recipes can make or break the dish. Too little oil, and your food might turn out dry; too much, and it could become greasy. For example, crispy roasted vegetables or perfectly golden chicken from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>our recipe collection</a> rely on precise oil measurements. A slight variation can alter cooking times and textures, so getting it right matters.</p>  

<p>Olive oil is a staple in many air fryer recipes, from marinades to coatings. If you're converting from millilitres to cups, knowing that 960 ml equals roughly 4.06 cups helps streamline your prep. This is especially useful for batch cooking or meal prepping, where consistency is key. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for other handy measurement swaps.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure 960 ml of Olive Oil Without a Scale</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a measuring jug with millilitre markings, you can still measure 960 ml of olive oil using standard cups. Since 1 cup is roughly 237 ml, 960 ml works out to just over 4 cups. For best results, use a liquid measuring cup and fill it to the 4-cup mark, then add an extra tablespoon to account for the remaining 6 ml. This method ensures accuracy without specialised tools.</p>  

<h2>Converting 960 ml of Olive Oil for Different Recipes</h2>  
<p>Whether you're making air-fried potatoes or a Mediterranean-style salmon dish from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/salmon>our salmon recipes</a>, 960 ml of olive oil translates to the same cup measurement. However, some recipes may call for slight adjustments based on ingredient density or desired crispiness. For instance, denser foods like lamb or beef might require a bit more oil, while lighter items like shrimp or vegetables need less.</p>  

<p>If you're scaling a recipe up or down, remember that 960 ml (4.06 cups) of olive oil is a versatile starting point. For baking conversions, such as cakes or cookies, this measurement ensures even moisture distribution. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>cake recipes</a> often use olive oil for a lighter texture, so precise measuring is crucial.</p>  

<h3>Does Olive Oil Type Affect the Conversion?</h3>  
<p>No, whether you're using extra virgin or light olive oil, 960 ml will always equal roughly 4.06 cups. The viscosity might vary slightly, but the volume measurement remains consistent. This makes it easy to swap oil types in recipes without recalculating quantities.</p>  

<h2>Common Mistakes When Measuring Olive Oil</h2>  
<p>One frequent error is using dry measuring cups instead of liquid ones, which can lead to inaccuracies. Dry cups are designed for ingredients like flour, while liquid cups have spouts for precise pouring. Another mistake is eyeballing the measurement—960 ml of olive oil is just over 4 cups, so guessing could throw off your recipe.</p>  

<p>To avoid residue buildup in your air fryer from excess oil, always measure carefully.

Proper measurements not only improve your cooking but also extend the life of your air fryer.</p>

<p>Yes, you can use wooden skewers in an air fryer, but only if you soak them in water for at least 30 minutes first. This prevents them from burning or catching fire during cooking. The high-speed convection heat of air fryers requires extra precautions compared to traditional ovens.</p>

<h2>Why Wooden Skewers Need Special Care</h2>
<p>Wooden skewers are prone to drying out and charring under the intense, direct heat of an air fryer. Unlike conventional baking where heat circulates gently, air fryers blast food with concentrated hot air at up to 200Â°C. Dry wood can ignite at these temperatures, which is why pre-soaking is non-negotiable. At airfryerrecipe.co.uk, we recommend using this method for all skewered <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipes</a> like kebabs or satay.</p>
<p>The moisture from soaking creates a protective barrier that slows combustion. Bamboo skewers typically withstand heat better than cheaper wooden varieties, but both types require preparation. For best results, submerge skewers fully in cold water and weigh them down with a plate to ensure even saturation. This simple step makes all the difference between perfect kebabs and a smoky kitchen.</p>

<h2>Step-by-Step Safety Guide</h2>
<h3>Pre-Soaking Techniques</h3>
<p>Start by selecting high-quality, food-grade wooden skewers without splinters or cracks. Fill a deep container with cold water and add a tablespoon of vinegar or lemon juice to help the wood absorb moisture faster. Soak for a minimum of 30 minutes, though overnight soaking works best for thicker skewers. Pat them dry lightly before threading ingredients to prevent steaming.</p>

<h3>Loading the Air Fryer</h3>
<p>Arrange skewers in a single layer without overcrowding to ensure proper air circulation. Leave at least 2cm between each skewer and avoid contact with the heating element. For models like the Ninja Air Fryer, use the grill pan accessory to elevate skewers away from the base. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> helps adjust cooking times for skewered foods.</p>

<h2>Alternative Solutions</h2>
<p>If you're concerned about wooden skewers, metal skewers offer a completely fireproof option. Stainless steel varieties conduct heat evenly and can be reused indefinitely. Silicone-coated skewers are another excellent choice, especially for families with children. Both alternatives work beautifully in air fryers without pre-soaking, as confirmed in our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipe collection</a>.</p>
<p>For those committed to wooden skewers, consider cutting them shorter to fit your air fryer basket perfectly. Overhanging ends are most likely to char since they receive direct heat exposure. Some cooks wrap foil around exposed wood parts as an extra precaution, though this may affect crispiness.</p>

<h2>What Not to Do</h2>
<p>Never use dry wooden skewers straight from the packet in an air fryer. Avoid sugary marinades that can caramelise and stick to the wood, increasing burn risk. Don't attempt to reuse wooden skewers as they weaken after cooking. Always supervise the air fryer when using skewers and keep a kitchen fire extinguisher handy, though proper preparation makes accidents extremely unlikely.</p>
<p>For cleaning any residue, our guide to <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer maintenance</a> covers safe methods. Remember that while wooden skewers are air fryer-compatible with care, they're not ideal for extended high-temperature cooking. For dishes requiring over 20 minutes, consider alternative methods or materials.</p>

<h2>Best Recipes for Skewered Air Frying</h2>
<p>Skewers excel for quick-cooking proteins and vegetables in the air fryer. Try marinated chicken thighs cut into cubes with bell peppers and onions - a perfect 15-minute meal. Prawns and pineapple chunks make another fantastic combination that cooks in under 10 minutes. For vegetarian options, halloumi and cherry tomatoes work wonderfully when threaded onto properly prepared skewers.</p>
<p>Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable recipe section</a> for more inspiration. The key is cutting ingredients uniformly so everything cooks evenly. Smaller pieces not only cook faster but also reduce the time skewers are exposed to heat, minimising any safety concerns.</p>

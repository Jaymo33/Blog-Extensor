<p>4 tablespoons (tbsp) of soy sauce weigh approximately 60 grams (g). This conversion is essential for air fryer cooking, where precise measurements can make or break a dish. Whether you’re marinating chicken or whipping up a stir-fry, knowing the exact weight ensures consistency.

<h2>Why accurate soy sauce measurements matter</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of soy sauce is crucial for balancing flavours in air fryer recipes. Too little, and your dish might lack depth; too much, and it could become overly salty. Converting 4 tbsp of soy sauce to grams (60g) helps avoid guesswork. This is especially useful for marinades, sauces, and glazes. For more recipe ideas, visit our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipes section</a>.</p>  

<p>Many air fryer recipes call for soy sauce as a key ingredient, from crispy tofu to glazed salmon. Measuring by weight (grams) rather than volume (tablespoons) ensures accuracy, especially when scaling recipes. A digital kitchen scale is a handy tool for this. If you’re new to air frying, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipes</a> for inspiration.</p>  

<h3>How to measure soy sauce correctly</h3>  
<p>For the most accurate measurement, use a digital scale to weigh your soy sauce. If you don’t have one, a standard UK tablespoon holds about 15ml, which roughly translates to 15g for soy sauce. However, viscosity and brand variations can slightly alter this. Always level off your tablespoons for consistency. Need cleaning tips?

<h2>Common uses for 4 tbsp of soy sauce</h2>  
<p>Four tablespoons of soy sauce (60g) is a common quantity in many air fryer recipes. It’s perfect for marinating proteins like chicken, beef, or tofu before cooking. You can also use it to create glazes for roasted vegetables or stir-fries. The umami-rich flavour enhances dishes without overpowering them.

<p>Soy sauce is also a key component in dipping sauces and dressings for air-fried dishes. Combining 4 tbsp of soy sauce with ingredients like honey, garlic, or ginger creates a versatile base. Whether you’re cooking for one or meal prepping, precise measurements ensure great results every time.

<h3>Tips for substituting soy sauce</h3>  
<p>If you’re out of soy sauce, you can use tamari or coconut aminos as alternatives. These substitutes have similar weights, so 4 tbsp will still be around 60g. Adjust seasoning as needed, as some alternatives are less salty. Experimenting with flavours is part of the fun of air fryer cooking!</p>

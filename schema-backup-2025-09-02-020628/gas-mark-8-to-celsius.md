<p>Gas Mark 8 converts to 230°C, a crucial temperature for air fryer cooking. This high heat setting is perfect for achieving crispy textures while maintaining moisture inside. Whether you're adapting traditional oven recipes or following air fryer-specific instructions from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, understanding this conversion ensures consistent results every time.</p>

<p>Most air fryers operate within a range of 80°C to 200°C, but premium models can reach up to 230°C to match Gas Mark 8 requirements. This makes them excellent for roasting vegetables, baking goods, or cooking meats that need initial high heat. The concentrated airflow in air fryers means you might need to adjust cooking times slightly compared to conventional ovens.</p>

<h2>Why Gas Mark 8 Matters for Air Fryer Cooking</h2>

<p>Gas Mark 8 (230°C) represents the upper end of cooking temperatures for many recipes. In air fryers, this heat level creates the perfect environment for Maillard reactions – the chemical process that gives food its appealing brown crust. From crispy roast potatoes to perfectly baked cookies, this temperature delivers professional results in home kitchens.</p>

<p>When converting Gas Mark 8 to Celsius for your air fryer, remember that cooking times may be 20% shorter than conventional oven recipes. The rapid air circulation cooks food more efficiently, so always check progress a few minutes before the suggested time. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> provides detailed adjustments for all your favourite dishes.</p>

<h3>Common Foods Cooked at Gas Mark 8 (230°C)</h3>

<p>Several classic dishes rely on Gas Mark 8 temperatures for optimal results. In air fryers, these include crispy chicken wings (20-25 minutes), roasted root vegetables (15-18 minutes), and puff pastry items (10-12 minutes). The high heat ensures quick browning while locking in moisture – a balance traditional ovens struggle to achieve as efficiently.</p>

<h2>Converting Between Gas Marks and Celsius</h2>

<p>The Gas Mark scale, used primarily in UK recipes, can confuse those accustomed to Celsius measurements. Here's a quick reference: Gas Mark 1=140°C, increasing by approximately 15°C per mark until Gas Mark 9=240°C. Gas Mark 8 sits at 230°C, ideal for most roasting and baking in air fryers when you want that perfect golden finish.</p>

<p>For those adapting family recipes, remember that older cookbooks might use different terminology. If you see "very hot oven", it typically means Gas Mark 8 or 230°C. Modern air fryers with digital controls make temperature selection easier than ever – just dial in 230°C and you're set. Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a> for Gas Mark 8 inspired dishes optimised for air fryers.</p>

<h3>Temperature Accuracy in Air Fryers</h3>

<p>While most air fryers accurately maintain set temperatures, it's worth investing in an oven thermometer for precision cooking at Gas Mark 8 (230°C). The compact size of air fryers means hot spots can develop, so occasional shaking or turning of food ensures even cooking. This is particularly important for baked goods where consistent heat distribution matters.</p>

<h2>Adjusting Cooking Times for Gas Mark 8 Recipes</h2>

<p>When using Gas Mark 8 (230°C) in your air fryer, reduce conventional oven cooking times by about 15-20%. For example, oven-roasted chicken thighs at 230°C for 40 minutes would take just 30-35 minutes in an air fryer. The exact timing depends on your appliance's power and the food's thickness – always use a meat thermometer for proteins.</p>

<p>Air fryers excel at Gas Mark 8 temperatures for several reasons. The concentrated heat circulates rapidly around food, creating crispiness without drying. This makes them perfect for reviving leftovers or cooking frozen foods – check our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/Frozen-Foods>frozen food section</a> for inspired ideas. Just remember to preheat your air fryer for 3-5 minutes when cooking at 230°C for best results.</p>

<h3>Cleaning After High-Temperature Cooking</h3>

<p>Cooking at Gas Mark 8 (230°C) can lead to more splattering and residue in your air fryer basket. For easy cleanup, use our recommended <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning solutions</a> immediately after cooking while the appliance is still warm. This prevents baked-on grease that becomes harder to remove later, maintaining your air fryer's performance and longevity.</p>

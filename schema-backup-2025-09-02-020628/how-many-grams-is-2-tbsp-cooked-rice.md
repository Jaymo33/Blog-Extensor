<p>2 tablespoons of cooked rice weigh approximately 30 grams. This measurement is essential for portion control, especially when using an air fryer for meal prep or reheating. Whether you’re tracking calories or ensuring even cooking, knowing the exact weight helps streamline your recipes. For more air fryer conversions, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>

<h2>Why measuring cooked rice matters</h2>  
<p>Accurate measurements ensure consistency in your air fryer recipes. Cooked rice can vary in density, so relying on volume alone may lead to uneven results. By converting 2 tbsp of cooked rice to grams, you eliminate guesswork and achieve perfectly portioned meals. This is particularly useful for meal prep, where precise quantities matter. Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> for inspiration on using rice in creative ways.</p>  

<p>Using grams instead of tablespoons also simplifies scaling recipes. If a dish calls for 4 tbsp of cooked rice, you’ll know it’s roughly 60 grams. This precision is especially handy for air fryer cooking, where space and timing are critical. Whether you’re making fried rice or stuffed peppers, accurate measurements lead to better results. Don’t forget to clean your air fryer after cooking rice—here’s our guide on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>keeping it spotless</a>.</p>  

<h3>How to measure cooked rice correctly</h3>  
<p>For the most accurate conversion of 2 tbsp cooked rice to grams, use a kitchen scale. Lightly spoon the rice into the tablespoon without packing it down. Level it off with a knife for a consistent measurement. This method prevents overestimating the weight and ensures your air fryer dishes turn out perfectly. If you’re meal prepping, consider weighing larger batches for efficiency.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for 2 tbsp of cooked rice</h2>  
<p>Small portions of cooked rice are ideal for air fryer recipes like stuffed vegetables or rice cakes. For example, 30 grams of rice fits perfectly inside a bell pepper or mushroom cap. It’s also the right amount for single-serving fried rice or as a base for protein bowls. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable recipes</a> for ideas on incorporating rice.</p>  

<p>Another great use for 2 tbsp of cooked rice is in air fryer fritters or patties. Mixed with mashed beans or shredded chicken, 30 grams of rice binds ingredients without overwhelming the texture. This small quantity is also perfect for reheating leftovers evenly in the air fryer.

<h3>Tips for cooking rice in advance</h3>  
<p>When prepping rice for air fryer use, slightly undercook it to account for reheating. Store portions in 30-gram (2 tbsp) amounts for easy access. This prevents waste and makes it simple to grab the right quantity for recipes. Properly stored cooked rice lasts 3-4 days in the fridge or up to a month frozen.</p>

<p>238°C in a conventional oven converts to approximately 218°C in a fan oven. This 20°C reduction is standard for fan-assisted cooking, as the circulating air distributes heat more efficiently. If you're using an air fryer, which operates similarly to a fan oven, this conversion ensures your recipes cook evenly without burning.</p>

<h2>Why Convert 238°C to Fan Oven?</h2>
<p>Fan ovens and air fryers work by circulating hot air around the food, which speeds up cooking times. A conventional oven at 238°C would be too intense for most recipes when using a fan setting. By lowering the temperature to 218°C, you achieve the same results without overcooking the edges. This is especially important for baked goods like cakes or cookies from our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>cake recipes</a> collection.</p>
<p>Many modern recipes specify fan oven temperatures, but older cookbooks or international sources might use conventional oven settings. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> helps bridge this gap, whether you're cooking meat, vegetables, or desserts. The 238°C to fan oven conversion is particularly useful for roasting vegetables or baking puff pastry.</p>

<h2>Air Fryer Equivalent for 238°C</h2>
<p>Since air fryers are essentially compact fan ovens, the 238°C to fan oven conversion applies directly. Set your air fryer to 218°C for recipes that originally call for 238°C in a conventional oven. This temperature works perfectly for crispy roast potatoes or golden-brown pastry from our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe hub</a>.</p>
<p>Remember that air fryers cook faster than conventional ovens due to their powerful fans. You might need to reduce the cooking time by 5-10 minutes when converting 238°C recipes. Always check food a few minutes early, especially when trying new recipes in your air fryer.</p>

<h3>Baking at 238°C Fan Equivalent</h3>
<p>For baking, the 238°C to fan oven conversion (218°C) creates the ideal environment for quick breads or puff pastry. The slightly lower temperature prevents the outside from browning too quickly while ensuring the inside cooks through. Our testing shows this temperature works beautifully for air fryer croissants and danishes.</p>

<h3>Roasting at 238°C Fan Equivalent</h3>
<p>When roasting meats or vegetables at the 238°C fan equivalent, you'll get beautifully caramelised results without drying out the food. The circulating air creates an even crispness on all sides, much like professional convection ovens. This makes 218°C perfect for air fryer roast chicken or crispy potatoes.</p>

<h2>Temperature Conversion Tips</h2>
<p>While the standard 20°C reduction works for most recipes, some dishes might need slight adjustments. Denser foods like meatloaf or fruit cakes might benefit from a 15°C reduction instead. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning guide</a> also reminds you to maintain your air fryer for accurate temperature control.</p>
<p>Investing in an oven thermometer can help verify your air fryer's temperature accuracy, especially when working with precise conversions like 238°C to fan oven settings. Regular calibration ensures your 218°C setting truly matches the intended heat level for perfect results every time.</p>

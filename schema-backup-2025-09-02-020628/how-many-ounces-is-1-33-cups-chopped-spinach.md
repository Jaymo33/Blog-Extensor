<p>1.33 cups of chopped spinach equals approximately 3.2 ounces (oz) in UK measurements. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precision ensures even cooking and perfect texture. Whether you're preparing a spinach-filled quiche or a crispy air-fried side, knowing the exact weight saves time and guarantees consistency.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate spinach measurements matter</h2>  
<p>Using the correct amount of chopped spinach ensures your air fryer dishes cook evenly and retain the right moisture balance. Too much spinach can lead to soggy results, while too little might leave your meal lacking in flavour. For recipes like air-fried spinach and feta pastries or stuffed chicken breasts, 3.2 ounces (1.33 cups) is the sweet spot. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more handy measurement tips.</p>  

<p>Spinach shrinks significantly when cooked, so measuring it raw is crucial. If you're substituting frozen spinach, note that it’s denser—1.33 cups of frozen chopped spinach weighs closer to 4 ounces. Always adjust cooking times in your air fryer to account for these differences. For more recipe ideas, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable category</a>.</p>  

<h3>Tools for measuring chopped spinach</h3>  
<p>A kitchen scale is the most accurate way to measure 1.33 cups (3.2 oz) of chopped spinach. If you don’t have one, lightly pack the spinach into a measuring cup without compressing it. Avoid heaping it, as this can add up to an extra half-ounce. For air fryer recipes, consistency is key—whether you’re making crispy spinach chips or a cheesy bake.</p>  

<h2>Common recipes using 1.33 cups of spinach</h2>  
<p>Many air fryer dishes call for roughly 1.33 cups (3.2 oz) of chopped spinach. Try it in spanakopita triangles, spinach-stuffed mushrooms, or as a base for air-fried eggs Florentine. The mild flavour and quick cooking time make spinach a versatile ingredient. Visit <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>our recipe hub</a> for inspiration.</p>  

<p>Spinach also pairs well with proteins like chicken or salmon in the air fryer. A 3.2-ounce portion wilts perfectly under high heat without overcooking. For meal prep, pre-measure batches of chopped spinach to save time. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/meal-prep>meal prep section</a> has more time-saving tips.</p>  

<h3>Adjusting for UK vs. US measurements</h3>  
<p>While 1.33 cups of chopped spinach is 3.2 oz in the UK, US cups differ slightly due to density variations. Always confirm the origin of your recipe to avoid discrepancies. For air fryer cooking, sticking to weight (ounces) eliminates confusion. Need to clean your air fryer after a spinach-heavy dish?

<p>60 ml of cream equals approximately 0.25 cups (1/4 cup) in both UK and US measurements. Whether you're whipping up a dessert or adding cream to a savoury dish, precise measurements ensure perfect results every time. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we know how crucial accuracy is, especially when adapting recipes for your air fryer. Let’s break down the conversion and explore how to measure cream effortlessly.</p>

<h2>Understanding 60 ml of Cream in Cups</h2>  
<p>Converting 60 ml of cream to cups is straightforward once you know the basics. In both UK and US measurements, 60 ml translates to roughly 0.25 cups, or a quarter of a standard cup. This conversion is essential for baking, where even small discrepancies can affect texture and taste. If you're using an air fryer, precise measurements help avoid overflows or uneven cooking. For more conversions, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>  

<p>Measuring cream can be tricky due to its thickness, but using a liquid measuring cup ensures accuracy. Pour the cream slowly to avoid air bubbles, and check the measurement at eye level. If you're scaling a recipe up or down, remember that 60 ml of cream is equivalent to 4 tablespoons or 12 teaspoons. This versatility makes it easy to adjust quantities without hassle.</p>  

<h3>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h3>  
<p>Air fryers rely on even heat distribution, so ingredient proportions must be spot-on. Too much cream in a batter or sauce can lead to soggy results, while too little might dry out your dish. Whether you're making creamy pasta or a luscious dessert, 60 ml of cream (0.25 cups) is a common quantity in many recipes. For inspiration, browse our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> collection.</p>  

<h2>UK vs. US Cup Measurements for Cream</h2>  
<p>While 60 ml of cream equals 0.25 cups in both regions, it’s worth noting that UK and US cup sizes differ slightly for larger quantities. A UK cup holds 284 ml, whereas a US cup is 240 ml. However, for small amounts like 60 ml, the difference is negligible. This consistency simplifies cooking across recipes from different sources. If you're working with a recipe that uses grams, 60 ml of cream weighs roughly 60 grams.</p>  

<p>For those who prefer visual aids, filling a quarter-cup measure to the brim will give you the correct amount. Alternatively, use a kitchen scale for absolute precision. Cream is a staple in many <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert recipes</a>, so mastering this conversion opens up a world of culinary possibilities. From mousses to custards, accuracy ensures flawless results.</p>  

<h3>Tips for Measuring Cream Without a Measuring Cup</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a measuring cup handy, household items can serve as substitutes. A standard tablespoon holds 15 ml, so four tablespoons equal 60 ml of cream. A shot glass (typically 30-50 ml) can also help approximate the quantity. Just remember that these methods are less precise than proper measuring tools. For best results, invest in a set of measuring spoons and cups—your air fryer creations will thank you!</p>  

<h2>Common Recipes Using 60 ml of Cream</h2>  
<p>Many dishes call for 60 ml of cream, from rich sauces to air-fried desserts. A classic béchamel sauce, for instance, often starts with this amount for a silky texture. In baking, 60 ml of cream can elevate scones or cakes, adding moisture without heaviness. For savoury options, try incorporating it into a creamy mushroom sauce for chicken or fish. Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipes</a> for ideas.</p>  

<p>Air fryer desserts like custards or puddings also benefit from precise cream measurements. Too much can make them overly dense, while too little may result in a dry finish. Whether you're making a small batch or scaling up, knowing that 60 ml of cream equals 0.25 cups takes the guesswork out of cooking.

<h3>Converting Other Cream Quantities</h3>  
<p>Once you’ve mastered 60 ml of cream, scaling up or down becomes effortless. Double the amount to 120 ml, and you’ll need 0.5 cups (1/2 cup). Halve it to 30 ml, and that’s 0.125 cups (1/8 cup). This flexibility is handy for adjusting recipes to suit your air fryer’s capacity or serving size. Keep a conversion chart handy for quick reference during cooking sessions.</p>

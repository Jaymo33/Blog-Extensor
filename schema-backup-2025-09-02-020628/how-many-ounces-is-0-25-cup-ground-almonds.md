<p>0.25 cup of ground almonds equals approximately 0.88 ounces (25 grams) in UK measurements. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes, ensuring accurate ingredient portions for coatings, toppings, or baking. Whether you're making almond-crusted chicken or gluten-free treats, precise measurements guarantee perfect results every time.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Getting the right amount of ground almonds is crucial for air fryer recipes, especially when used as a coating or binding agent. Too little can result in uneven texture, while too much may dry out your dish. Ground almonds are a popular alternative to breadcrumbs for a low-carb or gluten-free diet, making them a staple in many air fryer meals.</p>  
<p>For recipes like almond-crusted fish or air-fried chicken tenders, the 0.25 cup to 0.88-ounce conversion ensures consistency. If you're adapting traditional oven recipes for your air fryer, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for temperature and timing adjustments. Many of our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> use ground almonds for added crunch without excess oil.</p>  

<h3>How to measure ground almonds correctly</h3>  
<p>For the most accurate measurement, lightly spoon ground almonds into a dry measuring cup and level off the top with a straight edge. Avoid packing them down, as this can lead to an incorrect weight. If you're working with whole almonds and grinding them yourself, note that 0.25 cup of whole almonds yields slightly less when ground due to air incorporation.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for ground almonds in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Ground almonds serve multiple purposes in air fryer recipes beyond just coatings. They can be used as a flour substitute in baked goods, adding moisture and richness to cakes and cookies. Their natural oils help create a golden crust on proteins while keeping them juicy inside.</p>  
<p>Try using your 0.25 cup (0.88 oz) portion in our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/Dessert>air fryer dessert recipes</a> for almond flour brownies or macarons. The measurement also works perfectly for creating crunchy toppings on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/Vegetables>air-fried vegetables</a> or as a binder in veggie burgers. After cooking, remember to clean your air fryer basket promptly - ground almonds can stick when cooled. Our guide on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaning</a> makes maintenance simple.</p>  

<h3>Storing ground almonds for freshness</h3>  
<p>Because of their high oil content, ground almonds can go rancid quickly. Store any unused portion in an airtight container in the fridge for up to three months, or freeze for longer storage. Always check for freshness before using in your air fryer recipes - stale almonds can impart off-flavors to your dishes.</p>

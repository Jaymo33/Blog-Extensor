<p>1.5 tablespoons (tbsp) of vegetable oil equals approximately 20 grams (g) in UK measurements. This conversion is essential for precise cooking, especially when using an air fryer, where accurate oil quantities can affect texture and crispiness. Whether you're following a recipe from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> or improvising, knowing this measurement ensures consistent results every time.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate oil measurements matter in air frying</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on hot air circulation to cook food, and using the right amount of oil is crucial for achieving the perfect crispiness. Too much oil can make food greasy, while too little may leave it dry. Measuring 1.5 tbsp of vegetable oil in grams helps maintain balance. For more air fryer tips, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a> to simplify your cooking process.</p>  

<p>Vegetable oil is a common choice for air frying due to its neutral flavour and high smoke point. Whether you're making crispy potatoes or golden chicken wings, 20 grams (1.5 tbsp) of oil is often the ideal amount for coating without overpowering the dish. Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipes</a> for inspiration on how to use this measurement effectively.</p>  

<h3>How to measure 1.5 tbsp of vegetable oil without scales</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a kitchen scale, you can still measure 1.5 tbsp of vegetable oil accurately. A standard UK tablespoon holds about 15ml, so 1.5 tbsp equals roughly 22.5ml. Since vegetable oil weighs approximately 0.9 grams per ml, this translates to around 20 grams. For more precision, consider investing in a digital scale or using a graduated measuring spoon.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for 1.5 tbsp of vegetable oil in air fryers</h2>  
<p>Many air fryer recipes call for 1.5 tbsp of vegetable oil to achieve the perfect texture. For example, roasted vegetables like carrots or Brussels sprouts benefit from this amount for even crisping. Similarly, homemade air-fried chips or chicken tenders need just enough oil to brown without becoming soggy. Browse our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/potatoes>potato recipes</a> for delicious ideas.</p>  

<p>Another great use for 1.5 tbsp of vegetable oil is marinating proteins before air frying. Coating chicken or fish with this quantity ensures a golden exterior while keeping the inside tender.

<h3>Does the type of vegetable oil affect the weight?</h3>  
<p>While most vegetable oils have similar densities, slight variations exist. For instance, sunflower oil and rapeseed oil weigh roughly the same as standard vegetable oil, so 1.5 tbsp will still be around 20 grams. However, thicker oils like coconut oil may differ slightly. Always check labels if precision is critical for your recipe.</p>

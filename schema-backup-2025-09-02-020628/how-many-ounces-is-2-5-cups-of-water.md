<p>2.5 cups of water equals 20 fluid ounces. This conversion is essential for precise cooking, especially when using an air fryer where measurements can make or break a recipe. Whether you're baking, steaming, or reheating, knowing how to convert cups to ounces ensures consistency. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we emphasise accuracy to help you achieve perfect results every time.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on precise measurements to deliver evenly cooked dishes. Too much or too little liquid can affect texture and cooking times. For example, adding 2.5 cups of water (20 ounces) to a steam function requires exactness to avoid soggy or dry outcomes. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> simplifies these calculations, so you never have to second-guess.</p>  

<p>Many air fryer recipes, like soups or steamed vegetables, call for specific water quantities. If a recipe lists 2.5 cups of water, knowing it's 20 ounces helps you measure correctly. This is particularly useful for UK cooks, where metric and imperial measurements often mix. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a> for dishes that put this knowledge to work.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure 2.5 Cups of Water Without a Scale</h3>  
<p>If you don't have a kitchen scale, use a liquid measuring cup marked in ounces. Fill it to the 20-ounce line for 2.5 cups. For smaller batches, a tablespoon holds 0.5 ounces, so 40 tablespoons equal 20 ounces. This method is handy for air fryer sauces or marinades where precision matters.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for 2.5 Cups of Water in Air Fryer Recipes</h2>  
<p>Steaming vegetables like broccoli or carrots often requires 2.5 cups of water (20 ounces) to create enough moisture. This quantity is also ideal for reheating leftovers, ensuring food stays juicy. Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable recipes</a> for steaming ideas that use this measurement.</p>  

<p>Some air fryer cakes or bread recipes use water to activate ingredients like baking powder. Adding 20 ounces (2.5 cups) ensures the right consistency.

<h3>Converting 2.5 Cups of Water to Other Units</h3>  
<p>Besides ounces, 2.5 cups of water equals 591 millilitres or 0.59 litres. This is useful for international recipes or when using metric measuring tools.

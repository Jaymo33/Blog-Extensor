<p>398 F converts to approximately 180 C in a fan oven. This is a common temperature for baking, roasting, and air frying, offering even heat distribution for consistent results. If you're using an air fryer, this conversion ensures your recipes turn out perfectly every time.</p>

<h2>Understanding 398 F in Fan Ovens</h2>
<p>Fan ovens, also known as convection ovens, circulate hot air for faster, more even cooking. When converting 398 F to a fan oven, you’ll typically reduce the temperature by 20 C compared to a conventional oven. This means 398 F (around 200 C in a conventional oven) becomes 180 C in a fan oven. This adjustment prevents overcooking and ensures your dishes are cooked evenly.</p>
<p>For air fryer users, this conversion is particularly useful. Air fryers work similarly to fan ovens, using rapid air circulation to cook food. If a recipe calls for 398 F in a fan oven, you can often use the same temperature in your air fryer. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more detailed guidance.</p>

<h2>Why 398 F Works for Air Fryers</h2>
<p>398 F (180 C in a fan oven) is a versatile temperature for air frying. It’s ideal for crispy fries, roasted vegetables, and even baked goods. The rapid air circulation in air fryers mimics a fan oven’s efficiency, making this temperature perfect for achieving golden, crispy results without drying out your food.</p>
<p>If you’re adapting a recipe from a fan oven to an air fryer, start with the same temperature and adjust cooking times slightly. Air fryers often cook faster, so keep an eye on your dish. For more recipe ideas, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> collection.</p>

<h3>Common Dishes Cooked at 398 F</h3>
<p>Many popular dishes are cooked at 398 F in a fan oven or air fryer. These include roasted chicken, crispy potatoes, and even homemade cookies. The temperature is high enough to crisp the exterior while keeping the interior moist and tender.</p>

<h2>Converting Other Temperatures</h2>
<p>If you frequently switch between Fahrenheit and Celsius, it’s helpful to know a few key conversions. For example, 350 F is roughly 180 C in a conventional oven but 160 C in a fan oven. Similarly, 400 F converts to 200 C in a conventional oven and 180 C in a fan oven.</p>
<p>For air fryer users, these conversions ensure you’re using the right settings. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a> simplifies this process, so you can focus on cooking delicious meals.</p>

<h3>Tips for Perfect Air Frying</h3>
<p>To get the best results at 398 F in your air fryer, preheat the appliance for a few minutes. This ensures even cooking from the start. Also, avoid overcrowding the basket, as this can block air circulation and lead to uneven results.</p>

<h2>Fan Oven vs. Air Fryer</h2>
<p>While both fan ovens and air fryers use convection cooking, air fryers are more compact and cook faster. This means you might need to adjust cooking times when converting recipes. For example, a dish that takes 30 minutes in a fan oven at 398 F might only need 20 minutes in an air fryer.</p>
<p>For more tips on maintaining your air fryer, check out our guide on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning your air fryer</a> to keep it in top condition.</p>

<h3>Recipe Adaptations</h3>
<p>When adapting fan oven recipes for your air fryer, consider the size of your appliance. Smaller batches often cook more evenly. Also, some dishes, like casseroles, might need slight modifications to work well in an air fryer.</p>

<p>275 grams of granulated sugar is approximately 1.37 cups when measured using standard US cup sizes. This conversion is essential for baking, especially when using an air fryer for desserts like cakes or cookies. If you're following a recipe from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, getting this measurement right ensures your treats turn out perfectly sweet and textured.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Sugar Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Granulated sugar is a key ingredient in many air fryer recipes, from fluffy cakes to crispy cookies. Using too much or too little can affect texture, browning, and sweetness. For example, if you're making air fryer brownies from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>our recipe collection</a>, 275 grams of sugar (about 1.37 cups) ensures the right balance of chewiness and sweetness. Always measure carefully for consistent results.</p>  

<p>Different brands of granulated sugar may have slight variations in density, so weighing is the most accurate method. However, if you don’t have scales, the cup conversion is a reliable alternative. For more precise measurements, check out <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>our air fryer conversion chart</a> for other common ingredients.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure 275 Grams of Granulated Sugar Without Scales</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a kitchen scale, use the spoon-and-level method for accuracy. Lightly spoon granulated sugar into a measuring cup until it’s slightly heaped, then level it off with a straight edge. This prevents compacting, which can lead to over-measuring. For 275 grams, you’ll need roughly 1 and 1/3 cups (1.37 cups).</p>  

<h2>Converting Grams to Cups for Different Sugar Types</h2>  
<p>Granulated sugar is denser than powdered or brown sugar, so conversions vary. For example, 275 grams of powdered sugar equals about 2.2 cups, while brown sugar (packed) is closer to 1.25 cups. Always check your recipe’s requirements—especially for air fryer desserts like those in <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>our cake category</a>.</p>  

<p>If you’re adapting a recipe from grams to cups, note that US and UK cup sizes differ slightly. A US cup is 240ml, while a UK cup is 250ml. For 275 grams of granulated sugar, the difference is minimal (about 1.37 US cups vs. 1.32 UK cups), but it’s worth checking your measuring cup’s origin.</p>  

<h3>Common Recipes Using 275 Grams of Granulated Sugar</h3>  
<p>Many air fryer cakes and cookies call for around 275 grams of sugar. For instance, a classic Victoria sponge or chocolate chip cookies often use this amount. Visit <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> for inspiration, and remember to keep your air fryer basket clean with <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>our cleaning tips</a> to avoid sticky residue from sugary recipes.</p>  

<h2>Tips for Measuring Sugar in an Air Fryer Recipe</h2>  
<p>Air fryers cook faster than conventional ovens, so precise measurements prevent burning or undercooking. When using 275 grams (1.37 cups) of sugar, mix it thoroughly with other dry ingredients to ensure even distribution. This is especially important for recipes like air fryer muffins or donuts.</p>  

<p>If reducing sugar for health reasons, note that it may affect browning and texture. For lighter alternatives, try recipes from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>our dessert section</a> designed with less sugar. Always adjust cooking times slightly, as sugar content impacts caramelization.</p>

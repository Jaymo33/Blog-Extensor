<p>1.5 tablespoons of granulated sugar equals approximately 18.75 grams in UK measurements. This conversion is essential for baking and cooking, especially when using an air fryer where precise measurements can affect texture and browning. Whether you're whipping up cakes, cookies, or glazes, knowing this conversion helps achieve consistent results every time.</p>

<h2>Why accurate sugar measurements matter in air frying</h2>
<p>When using your air fryer, precise ingredient measurements ensure even cooking and perfect texture. Too much sugar can cause excessive browning or burning, while too little might leave your baked goods lacking sweetness. The compact cooking space of an air fryer means measurements need to be more accurate than traditional oven baking. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we recommend weighing ingredients for best results.</p>
<p>Granulated sugar is particularly important to measure correctly as it affects both taste and chemical reactions in baking. In recipes like air fryer cookies or cakes, sugar helps with spreading, browning and moisture retention. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> makes these measurements simple for all your favourite treats.</p>

<h2>How to measure 1.5 tbsp granulated sugar accurately</h2>
<p>For the most precise measurement, use digital kitchen scales set to grams. If you don't have scales, the spoon-and-level method works well. Fill your tablespoon measure slightly heaped, then level off the excess with a straight edge. Do this once fully, then half fill the tablespoon again for your 1.5 tbsp measurement.</p>

<h3>Common UK baking measurements compared</h3>
<p>Understanding how 1.5 tbsp converts to grams helps when scaling recipes. For granulated sugar, 1 UK tablespoon equals about 12.5 grams, making 1.5 tbsp approximately 18.75 grams. This differs slightly from US measurements, so always check which system your recipe uses. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>cake recipes</a> specify UK measurements for accuracy.</p>

<h2>Converting other sugar quantities</h2>
<p>Once you know 1.5 tbsp granulated sugar equals 18.75 grams, you can easily calculate other amounts. Two tablespoons would be 25 grams, while half a tablespoon would be 6.25 grams. This knowledge is especially useful when adapting traditional recipes for air fryer cooking, where quantities sometimes need adjusting.</p>
<p>For larger batches, remember that 100 grams of granulated sugar equals about 8 UK tablespoons. Keep our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> bookmarked for all your conversion needs and recipe inspiration. Whether making <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cookies>cookies</a> or desserts, precise sugar measurements make all the difference.</p>

<h3>Sugar alternatives and their conversions</h3>
<p>If substituting other sweeteners, note that their weights differ. Brown sugar is denser, with 1.5 tbsp weighing about 21 grams. Icing sugar is lighter at around 11 grams per 1.5 tbsp. Always check specific conversion charts when using alternatives in your air fryer recipes.</p>

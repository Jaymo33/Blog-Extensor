<p>To reheat potato gratin in an air fryer, set the temperature to 160°C (320°F) and cook for 6–8 minutes until piping hot. This method restores crispiness to the top layer while keeping the creamy interior intact. Whether you’re working with fridge-cold leftovers or day-old gratin, your air fryer delivers far better results than a microwave. For more inspiration, browse our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> collection featuring potato classics.</p>

<h2>Why Use an Air Fryer for Reheating Potato Gratin?</h2>
<p>The air fryer’s circulating heat works wonders on potato gratin, reviving its texture better than conventional ovens. Unlike microwaving, which can make the dish soggy, the air fryer crisps up the cheesy topping while evenly warming through the layers. It’s also significantly faster than reheating in a conventional oven – perfect for quick weeknight meals. If you’re new to air frying, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a> helps adapt any recipe.</p>
<p>Leftover potato gratin often suffers from dried-out edges when reheated poorly. The air fryer solves this by cooking at a lower temperature than traditional methods, preventing moisture loss. For best results, always check your gratin halfway through cooking. You’ll find more potato-based tips in our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/potatoes>potato recipes category</a>.</p>

<h2>Step-by-Step Guide to Reheating</h2>
<h3>Preparing Your Potato Gratin</h3>
<p>Remove the gratin from the fridge 15 minutes before reheating to take the chill off. If the top looks dry, lightly brush with melted butter or cream. Cut larger portions into individual servings for even heating – this prevents cold spots in the centre. Always use an air fryer-safe dish or liner; our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning guide</a> shows how to maintain your basket.</p>

<h3>Ideal Temperature and Timing</h3>
<p>Set your air fryer to 160°C (320°F) for optimal reheating of potato gratin. Cook for 6 minutes initially, then check if the centre reaches 74°C (165°F). Add 2-minute increments if needed – thicker portions may require 10 minutes total. The cheese should bubble slightly, and the top should regain its golden colour without burning.</p>

<h2>Pro Tips for Perfect Results</h2>
<p>Place a foil tent over the gratin if the top browns too quickly, removing it for the last minute to crisp up. Sprinkle a tablespoon of grated cheese over older leftovers to refresh the topping. For extra creaminess, drizzle a teaspoon of warm milk between the potato layers before reheating. Discover more techniques in our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>air fryer resource hub</a>.</p>
<p>Avoid overcrowding the air fryer basket – reheating in batches ensures proper air circulation. If reheating frozen potato gratin, add 3–4 minutes to the cooking time and check internal temperature. The beauty of using an air fryer is how it revives dishes that normally don’t reheat well, making it perfect for potato gratin.</p>

<h2>Troubleshooting Common Issues</h2>
<h3>Preventing Dryness</h3>
<p>If your reheated potato gratin turns out dry, it likely cooked too long or at too high a temperature. Next time, reduce the heat to 150°C (300°F) and cover with foil for the first half of cooking. A light spritz of oil on the surface can also help retain moisture while still achieving crispiness.</p>

<h3>Dealing with Sogginess</h3>
<p>Soggy reheated gratin usually means insufficient air circulation or overcrowding. Ensure your air fryer isn’t overloaded, and consider using a perforated parchment liner to elevate the dish slightly. Patting the top layer dry with kitchen paper before reheating can also improve texture.</p>

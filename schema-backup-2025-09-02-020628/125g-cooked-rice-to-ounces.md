<h3>How to Measure 125g of Cooked Rice</h3>  
<p>To measure 125g of cooked rice, use a digital kitchen scale for accuracy. Scoop the rice into a bowl on the scale until it hits 125g.

<p>Another great use for 125g of cooked rice is reheating leftovers in the air fryer. Spread the rice evenly in the basket and heat at 160°C for 3-4 minutes. This method keeps the rice fluffy instead of soggy. For cleaning tips after cooking, see our guide on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner</a>.</p>  

<h3>Tips for Cooking Rice in an Air Fryer</h3>  
<p>If you're cooking rice from scratch in the air fryer, rinse it first to remove excess starch. Use a heatproof dish or liner to prevent sticking.

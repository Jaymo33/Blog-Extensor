<p>60 ml of vegetable oil is equal to approximately 0.25 cups (or 1/4 cup). This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes, where precise measurements can make or break your dish. Whether you're whipping up crispy chips or a moist cake, knowing how many cups is 60 ml of vegetable oil ensures consistency. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we focus on making cooking conversions simple and accurate.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of vegetable oil is crucial in air fryer recipes. Too little oil, and your food may turn out dry; too much, and it can become greasy. Converting 60 ml of vegetable oil to cups (0.25 cups) helps maintain balance. This measurement is especially useful for recipes like air-fried chicken or roasted vegetables, where oil is key to texture and flavour.</p>  

<p>If you're unsure about other conversions, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for quick reference. For more recipe ideas, browse our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>collection of air fryer recipes</a> designed for perfect results every time.</p>  

<h2>How to Measure 60 ml of Vegetable Oil Without a Scale</h2>  
<p>Not everyone has a kitchen scale, but most have measuring cups. To measure 60 ml of vegetable oil in cups, use a standard 1/4 cup measure—it’s the closest equivalent. If you don’t have one, a tablespoon can help: 4 tablespoons equal roughly 60 ml. This method works well for recipes like air-fryer brownies or crispy tofu.</p>  

<h3>UK vs. US Cup Measurements</h3>  
<p>In the UK, a standard cup is 250 ml, while in the US, it’s 240 ml. For 60 ml of vegetable oil, the difference is minimal (0.25 UK cups vs. ~0.24 US cups). Most air fryer recipes account for slight variations, so either measurement will work. For precise baking, stick to the 0.25 cup (60 ml) guideline.</p>  

<h2>Common Recipes Using 60 ml of Vegetable Oil</h2>  
<p>Many air fryer dishes call for 60 ml of vegetable oil, from savoury to sweet. Try it in <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>crispy chicken</a> or <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>moist cakes</a>. The oil helps achieve that golden crunch or tender crumb. Remember, 60 ml converts to 0.25 cups, so measure carefully for best results.</p>

<h3>Adjusting Recipes for Different Oils</h3>  
<p>If substituting olive or coconut oil for vegetable oil, 60 ml (0.25 cups) remains the same. However, smoke points and flavours vary, so adjust cooking times slightly. For high-heat air frying, vegetable oil is often the safest bet.</p>

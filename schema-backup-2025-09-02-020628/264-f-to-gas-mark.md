<p>264°F converts to Gas Mark 1, making it a low-temperature setting ideal for slow cooking or gentle baking in air fryers and ovens. This temperature is perfect for dishes that require even, gentle heat without browning too quickly. Whether you're adapting a recipe or troubleshooting your air fryer settings, knowing this conversion is essential. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we specialise in helping you master these conversions for flawless results. Let’s dive deeper into how to use this temperature effectively.</p>

<h2>Why Convert 264 F to Gas Mark?</h2>
<p>Gas Mark settings are commonly used in British ovens, and converting 264°F ensures compatibility with traditional recipes. Air fryers often default to Fahrenheit, so understanding this conversion helps bridge the gap. Gas Mark 1 is particularly useful for delicate bakes, like custards or slow-roasted vegetables. If you’re using an air fryer with a Gas Mark preset, this knowledge saves time and guesswork. For more conversions, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>

<p>Many air fryer models, like the Ninja Foodi or Philips XXL, allow you to switch between temperature units. However, some older models or budget options might only display Fahrenheit. In these cases, manually converting 264°F to Gas Mark 1 ensures you’re not overcooking or undercooking your meals. This is especially handy for recipes like our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert collection</a>, where precision matters.</p>

<h2>How to Adjust Cooking Times for Gas Mark 1</h2>
<p>When cooking at 264°F (Gas Mark 1) in an air fryer, you’ll typically need to extend the cooking time slightly compared to higher temperatures. For example, a cake that takes 25 minutes at Gas Mark 4 might need 40-45 minutes at Gas Mark 1. Always check for doneness with a skewer or thermometer. Air fryers circulate heat more efficiently than ovens, so keep an eye on your food to avoid drying it out.</p>

<p>For meats like chicken or turkey, Gas Mark 1 isn’t usually recommended unless you’re slow-cooking or reheating. Instead, opt for higher temperatures like Gas Mark 4 or 5 for crispy skin and thorough cooking. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipes</a> offer tailored guidance for these adjustments. Remember, air fryers cook faster than conventional ovens, so reduce times by 10-15% when converting.</p>

<h3>Common Dishes Cooked at 264 F (Gas Mark 1)</h3>
<p>This temperature is ideal for dehydrating fruits, making yogurt, or proofing dough in your air fryer. It’s also great for keeping dishes warm without further cooking. For instance, if you’ve prepared a batch of roasted nuts at a higher temperature, switching to Gas Mark 1 lets you maintain their crispness without burning. Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe hub</a> for inspiration on using low temperatures creatively.</p>

<h2>Troubleshooting Temperature Conversions</h2>
<p>If your air fryer doesn’t match the expected results at 264°F (Gas Mark 1), calibrate it using an oven thermometer. Some models run hotter or cooler than their displays indicate. Cleaning your air fryer regularly also ensures accurate temperature control—see our guide on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer maintenance</a> for tips. For baked goods, consider lowering the temperature further if edges brown too quickly, as air fryers concentrate heat.</p>

<p>When converting family recipes passed down in Gas Mark, write down the Fahrenheit equivalents for quick reference. Bookmarking conversion tools or charts saves time and avoids mishaps. Over time, you’ll develop an intuition for these adjustments, making air frying even more effortless.</p>

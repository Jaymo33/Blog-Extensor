<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of condensed milk can make or break your air fryer dessert. Too little, and your dish might lack sweetness; too much, and it could become overly dense. Air fryers cook quickly, so precise measurements ensure even cooking and perfect texture. If you're new to air fryer baking, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a> offers plenty of inspiration.</p>  

<p>Condensed milk is a staple in many desserts, from fudgy brownies to creamy cheesecakes. Measuring 335 ml correctly means your treats turn out just right.

<h3>How to Measure 335 ml of Condensed Milk Without a Scale</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a measuring jug, use a standard cup. One cup holds about 240 ml, so 335 ml is just over 1 and 1/3 cups. For sticky ingredients like condensed milk, lightly grease your measuring cup for easy pouring. Always level off the top for accuracy.</p>  

<h2>Converting 335 ml of Condensed Milk for Different Recipes</h2>  
<p>Whether you're making a no-bake cheesecake or a caramel drizzle, 335 ml of condensed milk equals 1.4 cups. This measurement works for both UK and US recipes, though cup sizes can vary slightly.

<h3>Common Mistakes When Measuring Condensed Milk</h3>

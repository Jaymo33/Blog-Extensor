<p>2 cups of self-raising flour equals approximately 9.6 ounces (oz). This conversion is essential for precise baking, especially when using an air fryer where measurements can impact texture and rise. Whether you're whipping up cakes, muffins, or bread, knowing the exact weight ensures consistent results every time.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Flour Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Baking is a science, and even small discrepancies in flour measurements can affect your final product. Too much flour can make baked goods dense, while too little may cause them to collapse. For air fryer recipes, where cooking times are shorter and temperatures higher, precision is even more critical. That’s why converting cups to ounces—or grams—can be a game-changer.</p>  
<p>At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we recommend using a kitchen scale for the most accurate results. If you don’t have one, spooning flour into a measuring cup and levelling it off helps avoid overpacking. Self-raising flour, which already contains baking powder, requires extra care to ensure the right balance in your recipes.</p>  

<h2>How to Convert Cups to Ounces for Self-Raising Flour</h2>  
<p>The general rule is that 1 cup of self-raising flour weighs around 4.8 ounces. Therefore, 2 cups would be roughly 9.6 ounces. However, factors like humidity and how tightly the flour is packed can slightly alter this measurement. For absolute precision, especially in air fryer baking, a digital scale is your best friend.</p>  
<p>If you’re working with a recipe from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>our collection</a>, always check whether it uses weight or volume measurements. Many UK recipes prefer grams or ounces, while US recipes often rely on cups. Converting between the two ensures your air fryer treats turn out perfectly every time.</p>  

<h3>Common Mistakes When Measuring Flour</h3>  
<p>One of the biggest mistakes is scooping flour directly from the bag with a measuring cup. This compacts the flour, leading to an excess amount. Instead, fluff the flour with a spoon, lightly fill the cup, and level it off with a knife. For air fryer recipes, where even small errors can affect cooking, this step is crucial.</p>  

<h2>Using Self-Raising Flour in Air Fryer Recipes</h2>  
<p>Self-raising flour is a staple in many air fryer recipes, from scones to quick breads. Its built-in leavening agent helps batters rise evenly in the compact cooking space of an air fryer. When converting recipes, always account for the flour’s weight to avoid dense or uneven results.</p>  
<p>For example, if you’re making air fryer cupcakes from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>our cake category</a>, precise flour measurements ensure a light, fluffy texture. Too much flour can make them dry, while too little may cause them to sink. Stick to the 9.6-ounce mark for 2 cups, and you’ll be golden.</p>  

<h3>Adjusting Recipes for Different Flours</h3>  
<p>If you’re out of self-raising flour, you can make your own by adding 2 teaspoons of baking powder to every 150g (about 5.3 ounces) of plain flour. Just remember to adjust your measurements accordingly. For more tips, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a> for seamless substitutions.</p>  

<h2>Tools for Perfect Flour Measurements</h2>  
<p>Investing in a good kitchen scale eliminates guesswork and ensures consistency. Look for one with both metric and imperial units to handle any recipe. If you’re using cups, opt for a set with clear markings and avoid overpacking. For air fryer baking, where precision is key, these tools are invaluable.</p>  
<p>Cleaning your measuring tools is just as important. Residue from old flour can throw off new measurements. Visit <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>our cleaning guide</a> for tips on keeping your kitchen tools spotless and your measurements accurate.</p>

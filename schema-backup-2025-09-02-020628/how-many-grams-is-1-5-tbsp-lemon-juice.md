<p>1.5 tablespoons (tbsp) of lemon juice equals approximately 22.5 grams (g). This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements can make or break a dish. Whether you’re marinating chicken or whipping up a tangy glaze, knowing the exact weight ensures consistency. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we focus on accuracy to help you achieve perfect results every time.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate lemon juice measurements matter</h2>  
<p>Lemon juice is a versatile ingredient in air fryer cooking, used in marinades, dressings, and even desserts. Too much can overpower a dish, while too little might leave it lacking flavour. For example, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>lemon-herb chicken recipe</a> relies on the perfect balance of acidity. Measuring by weight (grams) is more reliable than volume (tablespoons), especially when scaling recipes up or down.</p>  

<p>Air fryers circulate hot air rapidly, which means ingredients cook faster and more evenly. A slight variation in liquid measurements can affect texture and taste. If you’re preparing a <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken dish</a>, 22.5 grams of lemon juice will give you the right tang without drying out the meat. Always use a kitchen scale for the best results.</p>  

<h3>How to measure 1.5 tbsp lemon juice without scales</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a scale, use a standard UK tablespoon (15ml) and fill it 1.5 times for roughly 22.5 grams. Freshly squeezed lemon juice is ideal, but bottled works too—just check for additives. For more tips, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a> to streamline your cooking process.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for 1.5 tbsp lemon juice in air fryers</h2>  
<p>This quantity is perfect for glazing salmon, brightening roasted vegetables, or adding zest to desserts. Try it in our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/salmon>lemon-dill salmon recipe</a>, where 22.5 grams of juice creates a delicate balance with herbs. The air fryer locks in moisture, so precise measurements prevent sogginess or dryness.</p>  

<p>For cleaning your air fryer, a mix of lemon juice and baking soda works wonders. Check our guide on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>maintaining your appliance</a> to keep it in top condition. Accurate measurements ensure effective cleaning without residue buildup.</p>  

<h3>Converting other lemon juice quantities</h3>  
<p>Need 3 tbsp? That’s 45 grams. Half a tablespoon? About 7.5 grams. Bookmark our conversion resources for quick reference. Consistency is key, whether you’re cooking for one or meal prepping.</p>

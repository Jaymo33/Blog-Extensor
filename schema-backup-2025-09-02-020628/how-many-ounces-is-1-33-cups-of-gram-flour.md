<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on even heat distribution, and incorrect measurements can lead to uneven cooking or texture issues. For example, too much gram flour in a batter can make it dense, while too little might not hold together. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> simplifies these calculations, so you never have to guess. Gram flour, also known as besan, is a staple in many air fryer recipes, from savoury snacks to gluten-free baking.</p>  

<p>If you’re working with 1.33 cups of gram flour, weighing it in ounces ensures accuracy. A kitchen scale is the best tool for this, but our conversion gives you a reliable estimate. For more recipe ideas, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> collection, where precise measurements are key to success.</p>  

<h3>How to measure gram flour without a scale</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a scale, use the spoon-and-level method for cups. Lightly spoon gram flour into a measuring cup and level it off with a knife. Avoid packing it down, as this can lead to over-measuring. Remember, 1.33 cups of gram flour to ounces is roughly 5.3 oz, but slight variations can occur based on how the flour settles.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for gram flour in air fryers</h2>

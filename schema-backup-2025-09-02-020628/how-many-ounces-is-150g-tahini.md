<p>150g of tahini equals approximately 5.29 ounces. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements can make all the difference. Whether you're whipping up a batch of hummus or drizzling tahini over roasted vegetables, knowing the exact weight ensures perfect results every time. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we understand the importance of accuracy in cooking, especially when using an air fryer.</p>

<h2>Why converting 150g tahini to ounces matters</h2>  
<p>When following recipes, especially those designed for air fryers, precise measurements are crucial. Tahini, a staple in Middle Eastern cuisine, is often used in dips, dressings, and marinades. Converting 150g of tahini to ounces (5.29 oz) ensures your dish turns out just right. Many UK recipes list ingredients in grams, but if your kitchen scale uses ounces, this conversion saves time and hassle. For more air fryer conversions, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>  

<p>Using the correct amount of tahini can affect the texture and flavour of your dish. Too little, and your hummus might be too thick; too much, and it could become overly rich. Whether you're meal prepping or cooking for a crowd, knowing that 150g tahini equals 5.29 ounces helps streamline your process. This is especially handy if you're scaling recipes up or down for different serving sizes.</p>  

<h3>How to measure tahini accurately</h3>  
<p>Measuring tahini can be tricky due to its thick, sticky consistency. For 150g (5.29 oz), use a kitchen scale for the most accurate results. If you don’t have one, a standard measuring cup can work—roughly ⅔ cup of tahini equals 150g. However, weighing it is always best for precision, especially in air fryer recipes where consistency matters. For more tips on perfect measurements, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a>.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for 150g of tahini in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Tahini isn’t just for hummus—it’s a versatile ingredient that shines in air fryer recipes. A 150g (5.29 oz) portion can be used to make creamy dressings for air-fried salads or as a glaze for roasted vegetables. Try mixing it with lemon juice and garlic for a flavourful marinade for chicken or tofu. For inspiration, browse our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipe category</a>.</p>  

<p>Another great use for 150g of tahini is in baking. Air fryer-friendly cookies or cakes with tahini add a nutty depth of flavour. Since tahini is high in healthy fats, it also helps keep baked goods moist. If you’re experimenting with new recipes, remember that 150g tahini equals 5.29 ounces—this ensures your creations turn out perfectly every time.</p>  

<h3>Storing tahini for freshness</h3>  
<p>Once opened, tahini should be stored in the fridge to maintain its freshness. A 150g jar will typically last up to three months if sealed properly. Stir well before use, as the oil tends to separate.

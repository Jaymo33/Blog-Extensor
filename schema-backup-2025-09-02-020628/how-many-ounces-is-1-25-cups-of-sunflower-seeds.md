<h2>Why accurate measurements matter</h2>  
<p>Getting the right amount of sunflower seeds ensures your air fryer recipes turn out just right. Too few, and you might miss out on that satisfying crunch. Too many, and they could overcrowd the basket, leading to uneven cooking. Sunflower seeds are a fantastic addition to everything from salads to baked goods, so knowing how to measure them correctly is key.

<h3>How to measure sunflower seeds for air frying</h3>  
<p>For the best results, use a dry measuring cup to scoop the sunflower seeds, then level it off with a straight edge. Avoid packing them down, as this can lead to an inaccurate measurement. If you're using a kitchen scale, simply weigh out 6 ounces for 1.25 cups. This method is especially useful for recipes where precision is crucial, like energy bars or granola.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for sunflower seeds in air fryers</h2>  
<p>Sunflower seeds add a delicious crunch to many dishes, and the air fryer makes them even better. Try tossing them with a bit of oil and salt for a quick, healthy snack. They also work well as a topping for air-fried vegetables or mixed into homemade trail mix.

Don’t forget to clean your air fryer afterward with our recommended <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning products</a>.</p>  

<h3>Storing sunflower seeds for freshness</h3>  
<p>To keep your sunflower seeds fresh, store them in an airtight container in a cool, dark place. If you’ve bought them in bulk, consider portioning them out into smaller amounts. This way, you’ll always have the right quantity ready for your next air fryer adventure. Proper storage ensures they retain their flavour and nutritional value.</p>

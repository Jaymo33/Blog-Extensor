Due to its size (approximately 4.41 pounds), you'll likely need to cut it into smaller portions that fit your air fryer basket. For best results, divide the fillet into 2-3 pieces and cook at 200째C for 12-18 minutes, checking for doneness with a meat thermometer. The internal temperature should reach 63째C for perfectly cooked salmon."

    "@type": "Answer",
    "text": "Most standard home air fryers cannot accommodate a whole 2 kg salmon fillet (approximately 4.41 pounds) due to basket size limitations. The fillet would need to be cut into smaller portions that fit comfortably with space for air circulation. Some larger countertop oven-style air fryers might handle a whole fillet, but always check your specific model's capacity before attempting. Dividing the salmon ensures even cooking and proper crisping of the skin."

When reheating, use your air fryer at a lower temperature (around 160째C) for 3-5 minutes to restore crispness without overcooking. Always ensure the salmon is thoroughly reheated to 63째C before consuming."

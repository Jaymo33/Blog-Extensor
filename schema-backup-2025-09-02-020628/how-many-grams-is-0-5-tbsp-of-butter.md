<p>0.5 tbsp of butter equals approximately 7 grams. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements can make or break your dish. Whether you're baking, frying, or roasting, knowing the exact weight ensures consistent results every time.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate butter measurements matter in air frying</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of butter in your air fryer recipes ensures even cooking and perfect texture. Too much butter can lead to greasy results, while too little might leave your dish dry.

<h3>How to measure 0.5 tbsp of butter without scales</h3>

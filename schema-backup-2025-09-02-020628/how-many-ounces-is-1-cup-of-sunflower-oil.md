Whether you're making roasted vegetables or crispy tofu, accuracy is key.</p>  

<p>Sunflower oil is a popular choice for air frying due to its high smoke point and neutral flavour. Measuring it correctly ensures your dishes turn out golden and delicious every time.

<h3>How to measure sunflower oil for air frying</h3>  
<p>To measure 1 cup of sunflower oil accurately, use a liquid measuring cup designed for oils. Fill it to the 1-cup mark, ensuring the oil sits level for an exact 7.7-ounce measurement. Avoid using dry measuring cups, as they can lead to inaccuracies. For smaller quantities, a kitchen scale can help verify the weight in ounces.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for sunflower oil in air fryers</h2>  
<p>Sunflower oil is versatile in air frying, perfect for everything from crispy potatoes to juicy chicken wings. Its light flavour won't overpower dishes, making it ideal for recipes like those in our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/potatoes>potato category</a>. Whether you're reheating leftovers or cooking from scratch, the right oil measurement ensures perfection.</p>

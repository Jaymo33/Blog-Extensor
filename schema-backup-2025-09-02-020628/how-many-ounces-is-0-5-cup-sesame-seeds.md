<p>0.5 cup of sesame seeds equals approximately 2.5 ounces (70 grams) in UK measurements. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precision matters. Whether you’re making sesame-crusted chicken or sprinkling seeds over roasted vegetables, knowing the exact weight ensures consistency. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we focus on accurate measurements to help you achieve perfect results every time.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate sesame seed measurements matter</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of sesame seeds can make or break a dish. Too few, and you’ll miss out on that nutty crunch; too many, and the flavour can overpower other ingredients. In air fryer cooking, even distribution is key for even toasting. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> simplifies these calculations, so you never have to guess. Whether you’re following a recipe from our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipes</a> section or experimenting, precision ensures success.</p>  

<h3>How to measure sesame seeds correctly</h3>  
<p>For the most accurate results, use a digital kitchen scale to weigh sesame seeds. If you don’t have one, lightly spoon the seeds into a measuring cup without packing them down. Avoid tapping the cup, as this compacts the seeds and skews the measurement. This method ensures your 0.5 cup of sesame seeds truly equals 2.5 ounces, whether you’re air frying or baking.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for sesame seeds in air fryer recipes</h2>  
<p>Sesame seeds add texture and flavour to countless air fryer dishes. Try them in crispy tofu, sprinkled over salmon, or mixed into homemade granola. For inspiration, browse our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipes</a> featuring sesame crusts. They also work beautifully in Asian-inspired dishes, like air-fried dumplings or stir-fry toppings. Remember, 0.5 cup of sesame seeds (2.5 oz) is often enough for 4–6 servings.</p>  

<h3>Storing sesame seeds for freshness</h3>  
<p>To keep sesame seeds fresh, store them in an airtight container in a cool, dark place. They can last up to six months this way, or up to a year in the fridge. Proper storage ensures your 0.5 cup measurements remain consistent in flavour and quality. For more storage tips, check our guide on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>keeping your air fryer ingredients fresh</a>.</p>  

<h2>Converting other sesame seed measurements</h2>  
<p>If your recipe calls for tablespoons or grams instead of cups, here’s a quick reference: 1 tablespoon of sesame seeds weighs about 0.3 ounces (9 grams). For larger batches, 1 cup equals roughly 5 ounces (140 grams). These conversions are especially handy when scaling air fryer recipes up or down.

<h3>Troubleshooting sesame seed measurements</h3>  
<p>If your sesame seeds seem heavier or lighter than expected, check for moisture or staleness. Old seeds may have lost oil content, affecting weight. For consistent results in air frying, always use fresh ingredients and measure carefully. When in doubt, our 0.5 cup to 2.5 ounce conversion is a reliable starting point for most recipes.</p>

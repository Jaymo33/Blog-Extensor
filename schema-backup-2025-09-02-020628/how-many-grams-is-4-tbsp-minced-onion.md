<p>4 tablespoons (tbsp) of minced onion equals approximately 40 grams (g) in UK measurements. This conversion is essential for precise cooking, especially when using an air fryer where ingredient ratios can affect texture and flavour. Whether you’re following a recipe from <a href="https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk">airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> or improvising, knowing the exact weight ensures consistent results every time.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on even heat distribution, so ingredient quantities must be precise. Too much minced onion can overcrowd the basket, leading to uneven cooking, while too little might leave your dish lacking flavour. For recipes like air-fried onion rings or savoury bakes, 40g of minced onion provides the perfect balance. Check out our <a href="https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart">air fryer conversion chart</a> for other common ingredient swaps.</p>  

<p>Minced onion is a staple in many dishes, from meatloaf to vegetable stir-fries. If you’re meal prepping, knowing that 4 tbsp equals 40g helps streamline your process. For more inspiration, browse our <a href="https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables">vegetable recipes</a> tailored for air fryers.</p>  

<h3>How to measure minced onion correctly</h3>  
<p>For accuracy, lightly pack the minced onion into the tablespoon without compressing it too tightly. Level off the excess with a knife for a consistent 10g per tbsp. If your recipe calls for 4 tbsp minced onion to grams, this method ensures reliability.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for 4 tbsp (40g) minced onion</h2>  
<p>This quantity works perfectly for seasoning air-fried burgers, adding depth to roasted vegetables, or enhancing marinades. It’s also ideal for dishes like air-fryer stuffed mushrooms or onion-heavy casseroles. For more ideas, explore our <a href="https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes">recipe collection</a>.</p>  

<p>If you’re converting a US recipe, note that UK tablespoons are slightly larger (15ml vs. 14.8ml), but the 10g-per-tbsp rule remains practical. Always cross-check with a kitchen scale if precision is critical.</p>  

<h3>Storing minced onion for future use</h3>  
<p>Pre-minced onion can dry out quickly. Store leftovers in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 3 days or freeze in 40g portions for later use. This saves time when whipping up quick air fryer meals.</p>

<p>5 tablespoons of brown sugar weigh approximately 62.5 grams. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precision ensures perfect results. Whether you're making cookies, cakes, or glazes, knowing the exact weight helps avoid kitchen mishaps.</p>

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>
<p>Air fryers cook food quickly and evenly, but only if ingredients are measured correctly. Too much or too little sugar can affect texture, browning, and even cooking times. For consistent results, always weigh ingredients like brown sugar instead of relying solely on volume measurements.</p>
<p>At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we recommend using digital scales for baking. Many of our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>popular recipes</a> include both volume and weight measurements to help you achieve professional results at home. This is particularly important for delicate baked goods where precision matters most.</p>

<h2>How to measure brown sugar properly</h2>
<p>Brown sugar should be packed firmly into the tablespoon measure for accurate results. The packing method affects the final weight - loosely packed sugar will weigh less than the standard 62.5 grams for 5 tablespoons. Here's the proper technique:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use a dry measuring spoon, not a tableware spoon</li>
<li>Firmly press sugar into the spoon with the back of another spoon</li>
<li>Level off the top with a straight edge</li>
<li>Repeat until you've measured all 5 tablespoons</li>
</ul>

<h3>UK vs US tablespoon measurements</h3>
<p>In the UK, 1 tablespoon equals exactly 15ml, while US tablespoons are about 14.8ml. For brown sugar, this small difference has minimal impact on weight. Our conversion of 62.5 grams for 5 tablespoons applies to both UK and US measurements.</p>

<h2>Converting other sugar amounts</h2>
<p>Need different quantities? Here's a handy reference for common brown sugar conversions:</p>
<ul>
<li>1 tbsp brown sugar = 12.5g</li>
<li>2 tbsp brown sugar = 25g</li>
<li>3 tbsp brown sugar = 37.5g</li>
<li>4 tbsp brown sugar = 50g</li>
<li>5 tbsp brown sugar = 62.5g</li>
</ul>
<p>Bookmark our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for quick reference when cooking. These measurements work perfectly for all types of air fryer recipes, from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cookies>cookies</a> to glazes for meats.</p>

<h3>Types of brown sugar and their weights</h3>
<p>Light and dark brown sugars have slightly different weights due to moisture content. Light brown sugar weighs about 12.5g per tablespoon (62.5g for 5 tbsp), while dark brown sugar is slightly heavier at about 13g per tablespoon (65g for 5 tbsp). For most recipes, the difference is negligible.</p>

<h2>Using brown sugar in air fryer recipes</h2>
<p>Brown sugar adds moisture, color and flavor to air fryer dishes. It's perfect for creating caramelized coatings on meats, adding sweetness to vegetables, or making delicious desserts. The 5 tablespoon (62.5g) measurement is common in many recipes.</p>
<p>When using brown sugar in your air fryer, remember it can burn quickly due to the concentrated heat. Check our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning guide</a> for tips on removing burnt sugar residue. For best results, mix sugar with other ingredients or use it as a finishing touch.</p>

<p>1.25 cups of icing sugar equals approximately 5 ounces (oz) in UK measurements. This conversion is essential for precise baking, especially when using an air fryer for cakes, cookies, or desserts. Whether you’re following a recipe from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> or adjusting measurements, knowing the exact weight ensures perfect results every time.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Baking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers require precise ingredient measurements to ensure even cooking and perfect texture. Too much or too little icing sugar can affect the consistency of your batter or frosting. For example, a <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>vanilla sponge cake</a> needs the right balance of sugar to rise properly in the air fryer. Measuring by weight (ounces) is more reliable than volume (cups) because it accounts for variations in how ingredients settle.</p>  

<p>If you’re converting other ingredients, check our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for quick reference. This is especially helpful when scaling recipes up or down for smaller air fryer batches. Remember, 1.25 cups of icing sugar to ounces is just one of many conversions you might need for baking success.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure Icing Sugar Correctly</h3>  
<p>For the most accurate results, use a kitchen scale to weigh your icing sugar in ounces. If you don’t have one, fluff the sugar with a fork before lightly spooning it into a measuring cup. Avoid packing it down, as this can lead to over-measuring. Level off the top with a straight edge for consistency.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for 1.25 Cups of Icing Sugar</h2>  
<p>This amount is perfect for glazes, frostings, or dusting desserts like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>air fryer cakes</a>. For example, a simple glaze for cinnamon rolls might use 1.25 cups (5 oz) of icing sugar mixed with a splash of milk. It’s also ideal for buttercream frosting when halving or doubling recipes to fit your air fryer’s capacity.</p>  

<p>If you’re making cookies, 1.25 cups of icing sugar could be used for rolling dough or creating a sweet finish. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cookies>cookie recipes</a> for inspiration. Proper measurement ensures your treats come out perfectly sweet without being overly dense or crumbly.</p>  

<h3>Converting Other Sugar Amounts</h3>  
<p>Need to adjust your recipe? Here’s a quick reference: 1 cup of icing sugar equals 4 oz, so 1.25 cups is 5 oz. For larger batches, 2.5 cups would be 10 oz. Keep this ratio in mind when scaling recipes for your air fryer, especially for delicate bakes like meringues or shortbread.</p>  

<h2>Tips for Storing Icing Sugar</h2>  
<p>After measuring your 1.25 cups (5 oz) of icing sugar, store any leftovers in an airtight container to prevent clumping. Humidity can affect its texture, making it harder to measure accurately next time. If your sugar does clump, sift it before using it in your next <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>air fryer dessert</a>.</p>

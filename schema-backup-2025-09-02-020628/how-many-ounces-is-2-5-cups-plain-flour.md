<p>2.5 cups of plain flour equals approximately 10.6 ounces (oz). This conversion is essential for accurate baking, especially when using an air fryer for recipes like cakes or bread. Whether you're following a recipe from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> or experimenting with your own creations, knowing the exact weight ensures consistent results.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate flour measurements matter</h2>  
<p>Using the correct amount of flour is crucial for baking success. Too much flour can make your baked goods dense and dry, while too little can leave them crumbly. When converting 2.5 cups of plain flour to ounces, precision is key. This is especially important for air fryer recipes, where even small measurement errors can affect cooking times and textures.</p>  

<p>For example, if you're making air fryer cookies from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cookies>our cookie recipes</a>, the right flour weight ensures they spread evenly and bake perfectly. A kitchen scale is the most reliable tool for measuring flour, but if you don’t have one, our conversion guide will help you get close.</p>  

<h3>How to measure 2.5 cups of plain flour without a scale</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a scale, spoon the flour into your measuring cup and level it off with a knife. Avoid scooping directly from the bag, as this compacts the flour and leads to inaccurate measurements. Fluff the flour first with a fork to aerate it, then gently spoon it into the cup. This method will get you closer to the true 10.6-ounce weight for 2.5 cups.</p>  

<h2>Common baking conversions for air fryer recipes</h2>  
<p>Converting measurements is a common challenge in baking. Alongside knowing how many ounces 2.5 cups of plain flour weighs, it’s helpful to understand other conversions. For instance, 1 cup of plain flour typically weighs around 4.25 ounces, so 2.5 cups would be roughly 10.6 ounces. This knowledge is invaluable when adapting traditional oven recipes for your air fryer.</p>  

<p>Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more handy measurement tips. Whether you’re making air fryer cakes or bread, precise measurements ensure your dishes turn out perfectly every time.</p>  

<h3>Adjusting recipes for the air fryer</h3>  
<p>Air fryers cook differently than conventional ovens, so adjustments are often needed. If a recipe calls for 2.5 cups of plain flour (10.6 oz), you might need to reduce cooking time or temperature slightly. Always preheat your air fryer for even baking, and check our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>cake recipes</a> for tried-and-tested methods.</p>  

<h2>Tips for baking with plain flour in an air fryer</h2>  
<p>Plain flour is a staple in many air fryer recipes, from cookies to bread. To get the best results, ensure your flour is fresh and stored properly. Keep it in an airtight container to prevent moisture absorption, which can affect weight and texture. If your recipe calls for 2.5 cups of plain flour (10.6 oz), measure carefully for consistent results.</p>

However, oat milk is slightly sweeter and thicker, so it may alter the taste or texture slightly. For baking, this usually isn't an issue, but for savoury dishes, you might want to use an unsweetened variety."

Alternatively, a standard teacup in the UK holds about 150 ml, so you could fill it just under full. For air fryer recipes, being slightly off won't usually ruin the dish."

<p>135 ml of oat milk is approximately 0.57 cups. This conversion is handy when following recipes, especially for air fryer dishes where precision matters. Whether you're whipping up a cake or a creamy sauce, knowing how to measure oat milk correctly ensures your dish turns out perfectly every time.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter</h2>
<p>Getting the right amount of oat milk can make or break a recipe. Too much or too little can affect texture, consistency, and even cooking time. For air fryer recipes, precise measurements are crucial because the cooking environment is more concentrated than a conventional oven. A slight variation in liquid ingredients like oat milk can lead to uneven cooking or soggy results.</p>
<p>If you're exploring recipes on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, you'll notice many dishes rely on exact measurements. From breakfast bakes to desserts, oat milk is a popular dairy-free alternative. Knowing how to convert 135 ml to cups ensures you can follow any recipe with confidence, whether it's from the UK or the US.</p>

<h2>How to Measure 135 ml of Oat Milk</h2>
<p>Measuring 135 ml of oat milk is straightforward if you have the right tools. A liquid measuring cup with metric markings is ideal, but if you only have imperial cups, you'll need to convert. As mentioned, 135 ml equals roughly 0.57 cups. For practical purposes, you can use a half-cup measure and add a tablespoon to get close to the correct amount.</p>
<p>If you're preparing a dish like a vegan quiche or a dairy-free cake in your air fryer, accuracy is key. Oat milk adds moisture and richness, so getting the measurement right ensures your dish isn't too dry or too wet. For more tips on air fryer conversions, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>

<h3>US vs. UK Cup Measurements</h3>
<p>It's worth noting that US and UK cup measurements differ slightly. A US cup is 240 ml, while a UK cup is 250 ml. For 135 ml of oat milk, the difference is minimal—about 0.56 US cups vs. 0.54 UK cups. In most recipes, this small discrepancy won't affect the outcome, but it's good to be aware of if you're following a recipe from a different region.</p>

<h2>Common Uses for 135 ml of Oat Milk</h2>
<p>Oat milk is versatile and works well in both sweet and savoury dishes. A 135 ml portion is often used in air fryer pancakes, muffins, or creamy pasta sauces. It's also a great addition to smoothies or overnight oats, providing a creamy texture without dairy.</p>
<p>If you're experimenting with air fryer recipes, you might find 135 ml of oat milk called for in dishes like vegan mac and cheese or dairy-free custards. For inspiration, browse the <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert category</a> on our site, where oat milk is a star ingredient in many treats.</p>

<h3>Tips for Storing Oat Milk</h3>
<p>Once opened, oat milk should be refrigerated and used within 5–7 days. If your recipe only calls for 135 ml, consider using the rest in another dish or freezing it in ice cube trays for future use. This way, you can avoid waste and always have oat milk on hand for your next air fryer creation.</p>

<h2>Converting Other Oat Milk Measurements</h2>
<p>If you frequently work with oat milk, it's helpful to know other common conversions. For example, 250 ml is roughly 1 cup, and 60 ml is about 0.25 cups. Having these conversions at your fingertips makes it easier to adjust recipes on the fly, especially when using your air fryer for quick meals.</p>

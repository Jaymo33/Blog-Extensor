<h2>Why Convert 150g of Vegetable Oil to Ounces?</h2>  
<p>Many UK recipes, especially those for air fryers, use grams, while others rely on ounces. Converting 150g of vegetable oil to ounces (5.29 oz) helps you follow recipes accurately. This is particularly useful when using an air fryer, as oil quantities can affect texture and crispiness. Too much oil can make food soggy, while too little may dry it out. For perfectly crispy results, precise measurements are key.</p>  
<p>If you're exploring new recipes, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a> offers plenty of inspiration. From crispy chicken to roasted vegetables, knowing your conversions ensures success. Whether you're a beginner or a seasoned cook, accurate measurements take the guesswork out of cooking.</p>  

<h2>How to Measure 150g of Vegetable Oil Without Scales</h2>  
<p>Don't have a kitchen scale? No problem. You can still measure 150g of vegetable oil (5.29 oz) using common household items. One tablespoon of vegetable oil weighs roughly 14g, so 150g is about 10.7 tablespoons. A standard UK measuring cup holds around 240ml, so 150g of oil is roughly 2/3 of a cup.</p>  
<p>For air fryer cooking, precision matters. Too much oil can cause smoke, while too little may leave food dry. If you're unsure, start with slightly less oil and adjust as needed.

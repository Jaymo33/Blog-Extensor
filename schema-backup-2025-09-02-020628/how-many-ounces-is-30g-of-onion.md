<p>30g of onion is approximately 1.06 ounces, a handy measurement for air fryer recipes. Whether you're prepping a stir-fry or adding onions to a dish, knowing this conversion ensures accuracy. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we love helping you nail those precise measurements for perfect results every time.</p>

<h2>Why Convert 30g of Onion to Ounces?</h2>
<p>Converting 30g of onion to ounces is essential for following recipes accurately, especially in air fryer cooking. Many UK recipes use grams, while others might reference ounces, so knowing both is useful. For example, if a recipe calls for 30g of onion and your scales only measure in ounces, you'll need 1.06 ounces. This small but crucial detail can make or break a dish.</p>
<p>Precision matters in air fryer cooking because ingredients cook quickly and evenly. Too much or too little onion can affect texture and flavour. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more handy measurements to keep your cooking on point.</p>

<h2>How to Measure 30g of Onion Without Scales</h2>
<p>Don’t have scales? No problem! You can estimate 30g of onion by volume. One small onion, roughly the size of a golf ball, weighs about 30g or 1.06 ounces. Alternatively, half a medium onion or a heaped tablespoon of finely chopped onion will do the trick. This method isn’t as precise as weighing, but it works in a pinch.</p>
<p>For air fryer recipes, consistency is key. If you’re making a batch of <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable dishes</a>, eyeballing 30g of onion ensures even cooking. Just remember, finely chopped onions cook faster than larger pieces, so adjust your air fryer time accordingly.</p>

<h3>Common Uses for 30g of Onion in Air Fryer Recipes</h3>
<p>30g of onion is a versatile amount, perfect for adding flavour without overpowering a dish. Use it in air fryer fajitas, stir-fries, or as a base for sauces. It’s also great for topping burgers or mixing into meatballs. The mild sweetness of onions enhances many dishes, and 30g is just enough to notice the flavour without it dominating.</p>

<h2>Converting Other Onion Measurements</h2>
<p>If you need more or less than 30g of onion, here’s a quick reference: 15g is about 0.53 ounces, and 60g is roughly 2.12 ounces. Bookmark our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipes page</a> for dishes that use these measurements. Whether you’re cooking for one or a family, these conversions ensure you get the ratios just right.</p>
<p>For larger quantities, like 100g of onion (3.53 ounces), you might need a whole medium onion. Keep our guide handy, and you’ll never second-guess your measurements again. And if you’re cleaning up after cooking, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner tips</a> will help keep your appliance spotless.</p>

<h3>Tips for Storing Leftover Onion</h3>
<p>If you’ve chopped too much onion, store it in an airtight container in the fridge for up to three days. For longer storage, freeze chopped onion in 30g portions. This way, you’ll always have the right amount ready for your next air fryer masterpiece.</p>

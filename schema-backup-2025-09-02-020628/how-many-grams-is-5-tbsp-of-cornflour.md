<p>5 tablespoons of cornflour equals approximately 40 grams. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes, where precise measurements ensure perfect texture and consistency. Whether you’re breading chicken, thickening a sauce, or baking, knowing the exact grams in 5 tbsp of cornflour helps avoid kitchen mishaps. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we focus on making conversions simple so your cooking stays stress-free.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Cornflour Measurements Matter in Air Fryers</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on even coating and precise ingredient ratios for crispy, golden results. Too much cornflour can make coatings clumpy, while too little may leave food soggy. Converting 5 tbsp of cornflour to grams (40g) ensures consistency, especially in recipes like crispy tofu or air-fried tempura. For more measurement tips, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>  

<p>Cornflour is a staple in many air fryer recipes, from crunchy coatings to gluten-free baking. Its light texture helps achieve that coveted crispiness without excess oil. If you’re prepping a batch of <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>air-fried chicken</a>, 40g of cornflour per 5 tbsp ensures an even, golden finish. Always level your tablespoons for accuracy—a kitchen scale is even better!</p>  

<h3>How to Measure 5 Tbsp of Cornflour Without Scales</h3>  
<p>No scales? No problem. Use the spoon-and-level method: lightly spoon cornflour into a tablespoon and level it off with a knife. Five level tablespoons should give you roughly 40 grams. For best results, avoid packing the cornflour down, as this can lead to over-measuring. If you’re working with larger quantities, consider investing in a digital scale for precision.</p>  

<h2>Common Recipes Using 5 Tbsp (40g) of Cornflour</h2>  
<p>Many air fryer favourites call for 5 tbsp of cornflour. Think crispy onion rings, tempura vegetables, or even gluten-free fried chicken. The 40g measurement is ideal for light, crunchy coatings that don’t absorb too much oil. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipes section</a> for inspiration, from savoury snacks to sweet treats.</p>  

<p>Cornflour also works wonders in binding mixtures, like veggie burgers or fish cakes. If you’re experimenting with <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>air-fried vegetables</a>, a 40g cornflour dusting ensures they crisp up beautifully. Remember, storage matters too—keep cornflour in an airtight container to maintain freshness and accuracy in measurements.</p>  

<h3>UK vs. US Measurements: Does It Affect Grams?</h3>  
<p>In the UK, 1 tablespoon equals 15ml, the same as in the US, so 5 tbsp of cornflour converts to 40g in both regions. However, ingredient density can vary slightly between brands. For absolute precision, especially in baking, weigh your cornflour rather than relying solely on volume. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning guide</a> also helps maintain your air fryer’s performance for consistent results.</p>

<p>0.5 cup of granulated sugar equals approximately 3.5 ounces (100 grams). This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes, where precise measurements can make or break your dish. Whether you’re whipping up cakes, cookies, or desserts, knowing the exact weight ensures consistent results. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we focus on accuracy to help you achieve perfect bakes every time.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Sugar Measurements Matter in Air Fryers</h2>  
<p>Air fryers cook food faster and more evenly than traditional ovens, so precise ingredient measurements are crucial. Too much sugar can cause over-browning or uneven cooking, while too little may affect texture and taste. For example, a <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>cake recipe</a> requires the right sugar balance to rise properly. Using 0.5 cup of granulated sugar (3.5 oz) ensures your batter isn’t too dense or too sweet.</p>  
<p>Granulated sugar’s weight can vary slightly based on packing, but 0.5 cup typically weighs 3.5 ounces. If you’re adapting a recipe from volume to weight, this conversion is a lifesaver. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more handy measurements.</p>  

<h2>How to Measure 0.5 Cup of Granulated Sugar Correctly</h2>  
<p>For the most accurate results, use a kitchen scale to weigh 3.5 ounces of granulated sugar. If you don’t have one, spoon the sugar into a measuring cup and level it off with a knife. Avoid packing it down, as this can lead to excess sugar. This method ensures you’re using the right amount for air fryer recipes like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cookies>cookies</a> or crumbles.</p>  

<h3>Common Mistakes When Measuring Sugar</h3>  
<p>Many home cooks scoop sugar directly from the bag, which compacts it and adds extra weight. This can throw off your recipe, especially in an air fryer where heat distribution is intense. Always fluff the sugar first, then measure. For sticky recipes, like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>desserts</a>, precision is key to avoid soggy or burnt results.</p>  

<h2>Converting Other Sugar Amounts for Air Fryer Recipes</h2>  
<p>If your recipe calls for a different amount of granulated sugar, here’s a quick reference: 1 cup equals 7 ounces, and 1/4 cup equals 1.75 ounces. These conversions help when scaling recipes up or down. For example, doubling a recipe that uses 0.5 cup (3.5 oz) of sugar means you’ll need 7 ounces total.</p>  
<p>Remember, air fryers work best with balanced ingredients. Too much sugar can cause caramelization too quickly, while too little may leave your dish bland. For more tips, explore our guide on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>maintaining your air fryer</a> after sugary bakes.</p>  

<h3>Using Sugar Substitutes in Air Fryers</h3>  
<p>If you’re swapping granulated sugar for alternatives like erythritol or stevia, note that their weights differ. Always check the packaging for conversion ratios. For instance, 0.5 cup of erythritol may weigh less than 3.5 ounces, affecting your recipe’s outcome.</p>

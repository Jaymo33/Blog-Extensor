<p>150 grams of blueberries equals approximately 1.2 cups, making it easy to measure for air fryer recipes. Whether you're whipping up blueberry muffins or a fruity compote, getting the measurement right ensures perfect results every time. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we know precision matters, especially when adapting oven recipes for your air fryer.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Frying</h2>
<p>Air fryers cook food faster and more evenly than conventional ovens, so precise measurements are crucial. Using too many blueberries in a batter, for example, can make it soggy or unevenly cooked. Conversely, too few might leave your dish lacking in flavour or texture. That’s why converting 150 grams of blueberries to cups correctly is essential for consistent results.</p>
<p>For more air fryer measurement tips, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>. It covers everything from grams to cups for common ingredients, helping you adapt recipes seamlessly. Whether you’re making desserts or savoury dishes, accurate measurements ensure your air fryer performs at its best.</p>

<h2>How to Measure 150 Grams of Blueberries Without Scales</h2>
<p>If you don’t have kitchen scales, you can still measure 150 grams of blueberries using cups. A standard metric cup holds about 125 grams of fresh blueberries, so 1.2 cups will give you roughly 150 grams. For smaller berries, you might need slightly more, while larger berries may require less volume.</p>
<p>Another trick is to use a measuring jug: fill it to the 300ml mark for close to 150 grams. This method works well for recipes like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer blueberry pancakes</a>, where precision isn’t as critical as in baking. Just remember that air fryer recipes often benefit from exact measurements for the best texture.</p>

<h3>UK vs. US Cup Measurements</h3>
<p>In the UK, a standard cup is 250ml, while in the US, it’s 240ml. This slight difference means 150 grams of blueberries might fill a UK cup slightly more than a US one. For air fryer recipes, sticking to grams is often safer, but if using cups, note which system the recipe follows.</p>

<h2>Using 150 Grams of Blueberries in Air Fryer Recipes</h2>
<p>From compotes to crumbles, 150 grams of blueberries is a versatile quantity. Try tossing them with a teaspoon of cornflour and a sprinkle of sugar before air frying for a quick dessert. The cornflour thickens the juices, preventing sogginess—a common issue in air fryer fruit dishes.</p>
<p>For savoury options, 150 grams of blueberries can add a tangy twist to sauces for meats or <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>air fryer chicken dishes</a>. Their natural sweetness balances spices beautifully, and the air fryer caramelises them slightly for extra depth. Always measure carefully to avoid overpowering other flavours.</p>

<h3>Storing Leftover Blueberries</h3>
<p>If your recipe doesn’t use the full 150 grams, store leftovers in an airtight container in the fridge for up to five days. You can also freeze them for later use in smoothies or <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>air fryer desserts</a>. Just spread them on a tray to freeze individually before bagging to prevent clumping.</p>

<h2>Common Mistakes When Measuring Blueberries</h2>
<p>Packing blueberries tightly into a cup can lead to over-measuring—150 grams should be lightly filled, not compressed. Also, avoid using heaped cups unless specified, as this can add up to 20% extra fruit. For recipes like air fryer cakes, this extra moisture can affect rising and texture.</p>
<p>Another pitfall is mixing frozen and fresh blueberries without adjusting measurements. Frozen berries release more liquid, so if substituting, reduce the quantity slightly or pat them dry. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner guide</a> also has tips for dealing with sticky berry spills!</p>

<p>0.5 cup of self-raising flour equals approximately 2.1 ounces (59 grams). This measurement is essential for precise baking, especially when using an air fryer where accurate ingredient ratios can make or break your recipe. Whether you're whipping up a quick cake or perfecting fluffy scones, knowing this conversion ensures consistent results every time.</p>

<h2>Why accurate flour measurements matter in air fryer baking</h2>
<p>Air fryers cook food quickly and evenly, but they require precise measurements to achieve the best results. Too much or too little flour can affect the texture and rise of your baked goods. For example, if you're making air fryer cupcakes or muffins, the exact amount of self-raising flour ensures they rise properly and stay moist. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we always recommend weighing ingredients for the most reliable outcomes.</p>
<p>Self-raising flour already contains baking powder, so the correct measurement is crucial. If you use too much, your baked goods might collapse or become dense. Too little, and they won't rise adequately. This is why converting 0.5 cup of self-raising flour to ounces (2.1 oz) helps maintain the perfect balance in your recipes.</p>

<h2>How to measure 0.5 cup of self-raising flour accurately</h2>
<p>The most accurate way to measure flour is by weight rather than volume. Scooping flour directly from the bag can compact it, leading to more flour than intended. Instead, spoon the flour into your measuring cup and level it off with a knife. Better yet, use digital kitchen scales for precision – 0.5 cup of self-raising flour should weigh 2.1 ounces.</p>
<p>If you're adapting recipes from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes</a>, you'll notice many provide both cup and weight measurements. This is particularly helpful when baking in your air fryer, where small quantity adjustments can significantly impact the final product. Always opt for the weight measurement when available for foolproof results.</p>

<h3>The difference between UK and US cup measurements</h3>
<p>It's worth noting that UK and US cup measurements differ slightly. A UK cup is 250ml, while a US cup is 240ml. For self-raising flour, this small variation typically doesn't affect the ounce conversion dramatically – 0.5 UK cup is still approximately 2.1 ounces. However, for absolute precision in air fryer baking, sticking to one measurement system is advisable.</p>

<h2>Converting other common flour measurements</h2>
<p>While 0.5 cup of self-raising flour equals 2.1 ounces, you might need other conversions for different recipes. Here are some common measurements for self-raising flour:</p>
<ul>
<li>1/4 cup = 1.05 ounces (30g)</li>
<li>1/3 cup = 1.4 ounces (40g)</li>
<li>1/2 cup = 2.1 ounces (59g)</li>
<li>1 cup = 4.2 ounces (118g)</li>
</ul>
<p>These conversions are particularly useful when scaling recipes up or down for your air fryer. The compact size of air fryers often means adjusting traditional oven recipes to smaller quantities. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> can help you adapt all kinds of measurements for perfect air fryer cooking.</p>

<h3>Tips for baking with self-raising flour in your air fryer</h3>
<p>When using self-raising flour in air fryer recipes, remember that the baking powder in the flour activates with moisture and heat. Preheat your air fryer for a few minutes before adding your batter or dough to ensure even cooking. Also, avoid opening the air fryer basket too frequently during baking, as this can cause temperature fluctuations that affect the rise.</p>

<h2>Common recipes using 0.5 cup of self-raising flour</h2>
<p>Many delicious air fryer recipes call for approximately 0.5 cup of self-raising flour (2.1 ounces). These include small batches of scones, individual cakes, or biscuit toppings for fruit crumbles. The <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>cake category</a> on our site features several recipes that use this measurement, perfect for air fryer baking.</p>
<p>For example, a simple air fryer vanilla cake might use 0.5 cup self-raising flour combined with butter, sugar, and egg. The precise measurement ensures the cake rises properly in the compact air fryer environment. Similarly, small batches of cookies or muffins often start with this quantity of flour as their base.</p>

<h3>What if you don't have self-raising flour?</h3>
<p>If you only have plain flour, you can make your own self-raising flour by adding baking powder. For every 0.5 cup (2.1 ounces) of plain flour, add 1 teaspoon of baking powder and 1/4 teaspoon of salt. Sift them together thoroughly to ensure even distribution before using in your air fryer recipes.</p>

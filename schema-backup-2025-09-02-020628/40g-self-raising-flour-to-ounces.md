<p>40g of self-raising flour equals approximately 1.41 ounces. Whether you're baking a cake or preparing a batter for your air fryer, getting the measurements right is key to perfect results. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we know how crucial accuracy is, especially when converting grams to ounces for UK bakers.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Flour Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Baking is a science, and even small deviations in flour weight can affect texture and rise. Self-raising flour contains baking powder, so precise measurements ensure your cakes or air fryer bakes turn out light and fluffy. If you're using a recipe from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>our collection</a>, converting 40g to ounces correctly guarantees consistency.</p>  

<p>For air fryer recipes, where space and heat distribution differ from traditional ovens, exact measurements prevent dense or uneven results. A digital kitchen scale is ideal, but if you're working with ounces, knowing that 40g is roughly 1.41 oz keeps things simple.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure 40g of Self-Raising Flour Without Scales</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have scales, use the spoon-and-level method. Lightly spoon flour into a measuring cup and level it off with a knife. For 40g (1.41 oz), this usually equals about 5 tablespoons. Check our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a> for more handy tips.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for 40g of Self-Raising Flour</h2>  
<p>This small quantity is perfect for single-serving bakes or coating ingredients before air frying. Try it in mini cakes, scones, or even as a light batter for <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>air fryer chicken</a>. Since 40g converts to 1.41 oz, it’s easy to adjust recipes without leftovers.</p>  

<p>Self-raising flour’s leavening properties make it great for quick bakes. If you’re experimenting with <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>desserts</a>, 40g (1.41 oz) can be the base for a small batch of cookies or a mug cake—ideal for air fryer cooking.</p>  

<h3>Converting Other Flour Amounts</h3>  
<p>Need to scale up? Double 40g to 80g for 2.82 oz, or halve it for 20g (0.7 oz). Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion guide</a> covers everything from grams to ounces, so you’ll never second-guess measurements again.</p>

<p>375 grams of water equals approximately 1.58 cups in the US or 1.32 cups in the UK. This conversion is essential for precise baking and air frying, where accurate measurements can make or break a recipe. Whether you're preparing a cake, bread, or even a savoury dish in your air fryer, knowing how to convert grams to cups ensures consistency. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we emphasise the importance of getting measurements right for perfect results every time.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Water Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Using the correct amount of water is crucial, especially in air frying and baking. Too much water can make dough sticky or cause uneven cooking, while too little can dry out your dish. For example, when making air-fryer bread or cakes, 375 grams of water must be measured precisely to achieve the right texture. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> simplifies these calculations, so you never have to guess.</p>  

<p>Different recipes may call for grams or cups, so understanding conversions is key. If you're following a UK recipe, 375 grams of water is roughly 1.32 cups, whereas US recipes use 1.58 cups. Always check the origin of your recipe to avoid mistakes. For more air fryer-friendly recipes, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipes section</a>.</p>  

<h3>US vs. UK Cup Measurements</h3>  
<p>The difference between US and UK cup sizes affects how you measure 375 grams of water. A US cup holds 240ml, while a UK cup is 284ml. This means 375 grams of water fills about 1.58 US cups or 1.32 UK cups. Always double-check which measurement system your recipe uses to ensure accuracy.</p>  

<h2>How to Measure 375 Grams of Water Without Scales</h2>  
<p>If you don’t have a kitchen scale, you can still measure 375 grams of water using cups. Fill a liquid measuring cup to the 1.5-cup mark (US) or just over 1.25 cups (UK) for close accuracy. However, for best results, we recommend investing in a digital scale, especially for air frying, where precision matters. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning tips</a> to keep your tools in top shape.</p>  

<p>Another handy trick is to use a tablespoon conversion. Since 1 US tablespoon holds about 15 grams of water, 375 grams would be roughly 25 tablespoons. While not as precise as weighing, this method works in a pinch. For more measurement hacks, browse our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/baking>baking category</a>.</p>  

<h3>Common Recipes Using 375 Grams of Water</h3>  
<p>Many air fryer and baking recipes call for 375 grams of water, such as doughs, batters, and sauces. For example, a simple air-fryer bread recipe might require this exact measurement for optimal rise and texture. Always follow the recipe closely, and when in doubt, refer back to our conversion guides at <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>.</p>

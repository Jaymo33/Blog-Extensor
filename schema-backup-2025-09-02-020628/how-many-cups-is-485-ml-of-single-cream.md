<p>485 ml of single cream is roughly equivalent to 2 cups. This conversion is handy for recipes, especially when using an air fryer, where precise measurements can make all the difference. Whether you're whipping up a creamy sauce or baking a decadent dessert, knowing how to convert ml to cups ensures perfect results every time.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of single cream can affect the texture and consistency of your dish. Too much or too little can throw off the balance, especially in air fryer recipes where even cooking is key. For example, a creamy pasta bake or a rich custard requires precise measurements to avoid a runny or overly thick result.</p>  
<p>At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we emphasise the importance of accurate conversions for flawless cooking. If you're unsure about other measurements, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for quick reference. It’s a lifesaver for both beginners and seasoned cooks.</p>

<h2>How to Measure 485 ml of Single Cream Correctly</h2>  
<p>To measure 485 ml of single cream accurately, use a liquid measuring cup with clear markings. Pour the cream slowly to the 485 ml line, checking at eye level to avoid over-pouring. If you don’t have a measuring cup, a kitchen scale can also help—485 ml weighs approximately 485 grams.</p>  
<p>For those using an air fryer, consistency is crucial. Whether you’re making a creamy dip or a luscious dessert, precise measurements ensure even cooking. Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> for inspiration on how to use single cream in delicious ways.</p>

<h3>US vs UK Cup Measurements</h3>  
<p>It’s worth noting that US and UK cup measurements differ slightly. A US cup is 240 ml, while a UK cup is 250 ml. For 485 ml of single cream, this means roughly 2 US cups or just under 2 UK cups. Always check your recipe’s origin to avoid discrepancies.</p>

<h2>Common Uses for 485 ml of Single Cream in Air Fryer Recipes</h2>  
<p>Single cream is versatile and works beautifully in air fryer dishes. From creamy soups to indulgent desserts, 485 ml (or 2 cups) is a common quantity in many recipes. For example, a rich mushroom sauce or a velvety custard can be easily prepared with this amount.</p>

<h3>Substitutes for Single Cream</h3>  
<p>If you’re out of single cream, double cream or whole milk can work as substitutes, though the texture may vary. For a lighter option, try half-and-half or evaporated milk. Just remember to adjust quantities slightly to match the richness of single cream.</p>

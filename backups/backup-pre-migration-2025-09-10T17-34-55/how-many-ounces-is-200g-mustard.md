<h2>Why accurate mustard measurements matter</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of mustard can elevate your air fryer dishes, from crispy chicken to roasted vegetables. Too little, and you might miss out on flavour; too much, and the dish could become overpowering. Mustard’s tangy profile works wonders in marinades, dressings, and glazes, so getting the measurement right is key. If you're new to air frying, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a> offers plenty of inspiration. Remember, 200g of mustard is roughly 7.05 ounces, a handy figure to keep in mind.</p>  

<h3>Converting grams to ounces for mustard</h3>  
<p>The conversion from grams to ounces is straightforward: 1 gram equals 0.035 ounces. For 200g of mustard, simply multiply 200 by 0.035 to get 7.05 ounces. This calculation works for any ingredient, but mustard’s density means it’s a reliable benchmark. If you’re scaling a recipe, this conversion ensures accuracy.

<h2>Common uses for 200g of mustard in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Mustard is a versatile ingredient that shines in air fryer recipes. A 200g portion (7.05 ounces) is perfect for making a batch of honey-mustard glaze or a tangy marinade for meats. It’s also great for adding a kick to roasted potatoes or as a base for dipping sauces. If you’re cooking for a crowd, this quantity ensures everyone gets a flavourful bite.

<h3>Measuring mustard without scales</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a kitchen scale, you can estimate 200g of mustard using volume measurements. Roughly, 200g equals about 12 tablespoons or ¾ cup. However, for precision—especially in air fryer cooking—we recommend using scales. A clean air fryer is also crucial, so don’t forget to check our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning guide</a>.</p>  

<h2>Tips for storing leftover mustard</h2>  
<p>Once opened, mustard can last for months if stored properly. Keep it in an airtight container in the fridge to maintain freshness. If you’ve measured out 200g (7.05 ounces) and have leftovers, use them within a week for the best flavour. Mustard’s acidity makes it a natural preservative, but it’s still wise to check for spoilage. For more storage hacks, visit <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>.</p>

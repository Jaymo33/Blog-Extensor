<p>3 cups of condensed milk equals approximately 24 ounces. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes, ensuring accuracy and consistency in your cooking. Whether you’re making a creamy dessert or a rich sauce, knowing the exact weight helps achieve the best results. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we focus on precise measurements to elevate your air fryer cooking.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Using the correct amount of condensed milk ensures your recipes turn out perfectly every time. Too much or too little can affect texture, flavour, and cooking time.

<p>Condensed milk is a staple in many desserts, from fudge to cheesecakes. When converting 3 cups of condensed milk to ounces, it’s important to note that UK and US measurements may differ slightly.

<h3>How to measure condensed milk accurately</h3>  
<p>For the most precise measurement, use a kitchen scale to weigh your condensed milk. If you don’t have one, a liquid measuring cup will work, but ensure it’s levelled off. Stirring the condensed milk first can help avoid air pockets, giving you a more accurate reading.</p>

<p>0.5 cup of tomato paste equals approximately 4.5 ounces (128 grams). This measurement is essential for air fryer recipes, ensuring the right consistency and flavour balance. Whether you’re making a rich pasta sauce or a marinade, knowing the exact weight helps avoid recipe mishaps. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we focus on precise conversions to make cooking effortless. Keep reading for tips on measuring tomato paste and adapting recipes for your air fryer.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on precise ingredient ratios to deliver crispy, evenly cooked dishes. Too much tomato paste can make sauces overly thick, while too little may result in bland flavours. Measuring 0.5 cup of tomato paste correctly ensures your recipes turn out perfect every time. For more conversion tips, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>. Whether you’re cooking for one or meal prepping, accuracy is key to delicious results.</p>  

<p>Tomato paste is a concentrated ingredient, so even small measurement errors can impact your dish. If you’re scaling a recipe, knowing that 0.5 cup equals 4.5 ounces helps maintain consistency. Many <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable-based air fryer recipes</a> call for tomato paste, making this conversion particularly useful. Always use a kitchen scale for the most accurate results, especially when baking or making sauces.</p>  

<h3>How to measure tomato paste without a scale</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a kitchen scale, you can still measure 0.5 cup of tomato paste accurately. A standard US cup holds 8 fluid ounces, so half a cup is 4 fluid ounces. However, tomato paste is denser than water, so by weight, it’s closer to 4.5 ounces. Spoon the paste into a measuring cup and level it off for the best results.

<h2>Common uses for tomato paste in air fryer recipes</h2>  
<p>Tomato paste adds depth to many air fryer dishes, from marinades to stews. A 0.5 cup (4.5 oz) portion is perfect for making rich pasta sauces or coating vegetables before roasting. It’s also a key ingredient in <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipes</a>, adding a tangy umami flavour. When mixed with herbs and oil, it creates a delicious glaze for meats and veggies. Always store leftover tomato paste in an airtight container to keep it fresh.</p>  

<p>For those who love meal prep, tomato paste freezes well in 0.5 cup portions. Simply measure out 4.5 ounces, place it in a freezer bag, and thaw when needed. This saves time and reduces waste, making it easier to whip up quick air fryer meals. If you’re unsure how to clean your air fryer after cooking with tomato paste, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning guide</a> has you covered.</p>  

<h3>Adjusting recipes for different tomato paste quantities</h3>  
<p>Sometimes recipes call for odd amounts of tomato paste, like 0.5 cup. Knowing that this equals 4.5 ounces helps you adjust accordingly. If a recipe requires 1 cup, you’ll need 9 ounces, and so on. This is especially handy when scaling recipes up or down for your air fryer. Always double-check measurements to ensure your dish turns out as intended.</p>

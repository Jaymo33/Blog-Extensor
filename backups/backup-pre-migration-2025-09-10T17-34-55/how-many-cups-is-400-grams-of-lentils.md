<p>400 grams of lentils is roughly equivalent to 2 US cups or 1.6 UK cups. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes, where precise measurements ensure even cooking and perfect texture. Whether you're making a hearty lentil stew or crispy air-fried lentil bites, knowing how to convert grams to cups saves time and avoids kitchen mishaps.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter for Lentils in Air Fryers</h2>  
<p>Using the correct amount of lentils ensures your air fryer recipes turn out just right. Too many lentils can overcrowd the basket, leading to uneven cooking, while too few might dry out or burn. For dishes like air-fried lentil falafel or crispy spiced lentils, 400 grams is a common quantity—so knowing the cup equivalent is a game-changer.</p>  
<p>At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we emphasise precision for the best results. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for other common ingredient swaps. Lentils are versatile, whether you're adding them to <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable-based recipes</a> or using them as a protein-packed base.</p>  

<h3>US vs. UK Cup Measurements for Lentils</h3>  
<p>The difference between US and UK cup sizes affects how you measure 400 grams of lentils. A US cup holds 240ml, while a UK cup is 250ml. For 400g of lentils, this means approximately 2 US cups or 1.6 UK cups. Always check your recipe’s origin to avoid confusion.</p>  

<h2>How to Measure 400 Grams of Lentils Without Scales</h2>  
<p>No kitchen scales? No problem. Use a standard measuring cup and the spoon-and-level method for accuracy. Fill the cup with lentils, then level it off with a straight edge. For 400 grams, you’ll need about 2 US cups or 1.6 UK cups. This method works well for most <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a>.</p>  
<p>Lentils expand when cooked, so 400 grams yields roughly 3–4 cups after preparation. If you’re meal prepping, this makes them ideal for <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/meal-prep>batch cooking</a>. For crispy roasted lentils, spread them evenly in your air fryer basket to ensure they cook uniformly.</p>  

<h3>Common Recipes Using 400 Grams of Lentils</h3>  
<p>From air-fried lentil patties to spiced snacks, 400 grams is a handy quantity. Try mixing cooked lentils with herbs and breadcrumbs for crispy bites, or toss them with oil and seasoning for a protein-rich snack.

<p>60 ml of olive oil equals approximately 0.25 cups (or 1/4 cup). This conversion is essential for precise cooking, especially when using an air fryer, where accurate measurements can make or break a dish. Whether you're following a recipe from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> or improvising, knowing how to convert 60 ml of olive oil to cups ensures consistent results every time.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Olive Oil Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of olive oil in your air fryer recipes is crucial for texture and flavour. Too little, and your food might stick or dry out; too much, and it could become greasy. For example, when roasting vegetables or preparing crispy chicken, 60 ml of olive oil (or 0.25 cups) is often the perfect amount to coat ingredients evenly without excess oil pooling at the bottom of the basket.</p>  

<p>Many air fryer recipes, like those in our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipes section</a>, rely on precise measurements. If you're converting from metric to imperial, knowing that 60 ml of olive oil is 1/4 cup helps avoid guesswork. This is especially handy for baking, where exact ratios are key to success.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure 60 ml of Olive Oil Without a Scale</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a measuring jug with millilitre markings, you can still measure 60 ml of olive oil accurately. A standard US cup holds 240 ml, so filling it to the 1/4 mark gives you 60 ml. Alternatively, use a tablespoon—4 tablespoons equal 60 ml (since 1 tbsp is roughly 15 ml). This method works well for small batches of marinades or dressings for air fryer dishes.</p>  

<h2>Converting 60 ml of Olive Oil for Different Recipes</h2>  
<p>Whether you're making crispy potatoes or a moist cake, 60 ml of olive oil (0.25 cups) is a common measurement. For example, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/potatoes>potato recipes</a> often call for this amount to achieve golden, crunchy results. Similarly, Mediterranean-style dishes like roasted vegetables or fish fillets benefit from this precise oil quantity.</p>  

<p>If you're scaling a recipe up or down, remember that 60 ml of olive oil is equivalent to 1/4 cup. This conversion is consistent across most cooking methods, including air frying, baking, and sautéing.

<h3>Common Mistakes When Measuring Olive Oil</h3>  
<p>One mistake people make is eyeballing 60 ml of olive oil, which can lead to inconsistent results. Always use proper measuring tools for accuracy. Another pitfall is confusing fluid ounces with millilitres—60 ml is roughly 2 fluid ounces, but cup measurements are more reliable for cooking.

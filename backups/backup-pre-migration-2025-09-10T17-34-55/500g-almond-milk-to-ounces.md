<h2>Why convert 500g of almond milk to ounces?</h2>  
<p>Many UK recipes, especially those for air fryers, use grams, while others rely on ounces. Converting 500g of almond milk to ounces (17.64 oz) ensures consistency in your cooking.

<p>Precision matters in air fryer cooking, where even small measurement errors can affect texture and taste.

<h3>How to measure 500g of almond milk without scales</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a scale, you can use volume measurements to approximate 500g of almond milk. Since 500g is roughly 500ml (due to its water-like density), you can use a measuring jug. In ounces, this translates to about 17.64 oz, or just over two US cups. This method works well for most air fryer recipes, though a scale is always best for precision.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for 500g of almond milk in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Almond milk is a versatile ingredient in air fryer recipes, from batters to sauces. A 500g portion (17.64 oz) is perfect for making dairy-free pancakes, creamy soups, or even baking cakes.

<h3>Does almond milk weight vary by brand?</h3>  
<p>Most almond milks have a similar density to water, so 500g will generally equal 17.64 oz regardless of brand. However, flavoured or thickened varieties might differ slightly. Always check the label for specific weight-to-volume ratios if precision is crucial. For consistent results, stick to unsweetened, unflavoured almond milk in your air fryer recipes.</p>

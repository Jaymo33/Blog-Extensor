<p>75g of brown sugar equals approximately 2.65 ounces. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precision matters, ensuring your dishes turn out perfectly every time. Whether you’re baking cookies or glazing meats, knowing how to convert grams to ounces simplifies your cooking process. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we focus on making measurements effortless so you can focus on creating delicious meals.</p>  

<h2>Why Convert 75g of Brown Sugar to Ounces?</h2>  
<p>Many UK recipes, especially those for air fryers, use metric measurements like grams, while some kitchen scales or older recipes might list ounces. Converting 75g of brown sugar to ounces ensures accuracy, whether you’re following a classic dessert recipe or experimenting with new air fryer dishes. Brown sugar’s moisture content means its weight can vary slightly, so precise conversions help maintain consistency. For more conversion tips, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>  

<p>Using the correct amount of brown sugar affects texture and sweetness in baked goods. Too little can leave desserts bland, while too much may cause over-browning in the air fryer. Whether you’re making sticky toffee pudding or a glaze for air-fried ham, 75g (2.65 oz) is a common measurement worth mastering. Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a> for inspiration.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure 75g of Brown Sugar Accurately</h3>  
<p>For the most accurate conversion, use a digital kitchen scale set to grams. Scoop the brown sugar loosely into a measuring cup, then level it off without packing it down. If your scale only shows ounces, 75g translates to roughly 2.65 oz. Keep in mind that brown sugar’s moisture can cause slight variations, so measuring by weight is always best. For more baking tips, visit our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>cake recipes</a> section.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for 75g of Brown Sugar in Air Fryer Recipes</h2>  
<p>This amount is perfect for small-batch baking or glazes. For example, 75g of brown sugar can sweeten a batch of air-fried cinnamon apples or create a caramelised crust on roasted vegetables. It’s also ideal for marinades, like a honey-brown sugar glaze for air-fried chicken wings. The air fryer’s rapid heat helps caramelise the sugar evenly, adding depth to your dishes.</p>  

<p>If you’re meal prepping, 75g portions make it easy to divide recipes without fuss. Try it in air-fried granola or energy bites for a touch of sweetness. For savoury dishes, mix it with spices for a dry rub on pork or tofu. Discover more ideas in our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/meal-prep>meal prep recipes</a>.</p>  

<h3>Tips for Storing Brown Sugar</h3>  
<p>To prevent hardening, store brown sugar in an airtight container with a terra cotta disc or a slice of bread. If it clumps, revive it by microwaving briefly or pressing it through a sieve. Proper storage ensures your 75g measurements stay consistent for future recipes.

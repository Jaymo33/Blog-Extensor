<p>0.375 cup of gram flour equals approximately 1.5 ounces (oz). This conversion is essential for precise measurements in air fryer recipes, ensuring consistent results every time. Gram flour, also known as besan, is a staple in many dishes, from crispy snacks to gluten-free baking. Whether you're making onion bhajis or a batter for air-fried veggies, getting the weight right matters. Head over to <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes</a> for inspiration on how to use gram flour in your air fryer.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Frying</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on even cooking, and incorrect measurements can lead to uneven textures or undercooked food. For example, using too much gram flour in a batter can make it overly dense, while too little might not crisp up properly. Converting 0.375 cup of gram flour to ounces (1.5 oz) ensures you stick to the recipe’s intended balance. This is especially crucial for gluten-free or vegan recipes where gram flour acts as a binding agent. Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more handy measurement tips.</p>  

<p>Many air fryer recipes call for small quantities, like 0.375 cup, to avoid overcrowding the basket. Overloading can block airflow, leading to soggy results. By weighing ingredients like gram flour, you ensure every portion cooks evenly. Plus, precise measurements help when scaling recipes up or down. For example, doubling a recipe requires 3 oz of gram flour if the original calls for 0.375 cup. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable recipes</a> to see gram flour in action.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure 0.375 Cup of Gram Flour</h3>  
<p>To measure 0.375 cup of gram flour accurately, use a dry measuring cup and level it off with a straight edge. For even better precision, a kitchen scale set to ounces (1.5 oz) is ideal. Scooping flour directly from the bag can compact it, leading to more than needed. If you don’t have a scale, fluff the gram flour with a fork before measuring to avoid dense packs. This method ensures your air fryer dishes turn out light and crispy.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for Gram Flour in Air Fryers</h2>  
<p>Gram flour is incredibly versatile in air fryer cooking. It’s perfect for coating veggies like zucchini or aubergine before air frying for a crispy finish. You can also use it to bind falafel or make gluten-free onion rings. Since 0.375 cup equals 1.5 oz, it’s easy to adjust quantities for smaller batches. For inspiration, browse our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipes</a>, where gram flour adds crunch to tenders or wings.</p>  

<p>Another popular use is in batters for pakoras or tempura-style dishes. The light texture of gram flour crisps beautifully in the air fryer without absorbing too much oil. If you’re making a larger batch, remember that 0.75 cup would be 3 oz, doubling the original measurement. Keeping conversions handy saves time and ensures consistency. Don’t forget to clean your air fryer afterward with our recommended <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner</a> to maintain performance.</p>  

<h3>Tips for Storing Gram Flour</h3>  
<p>Gram flour has a longer shelf life if stored properly. Keep it in an airtight container in a cool, dark place to prevent moisture absorption. If you’re measuring 0.375 cup (1.5 oz) from a bulk bag, ensure the rest is sealed tightly. For frequent use, consider smaller containers to maintain freshness. Proper storage ensures your air fryer recipes taste their best every time.</p>

<p>364°F in a fan oven is equivalent to approximately 400°F in a conventional oven. This conversion ensures your recipes bake evenly, whether you're using a traditional oven or an air fryer. Understanding this temperature adjustment is key to achieving perfect results every time.</p>

<h2>Why Convert 364 Fan Oven to Fahrenheit?</h2>
<p>Fan ovens circulate hot air for faster, more even cooking, while conventional ovens rely on radiant heat. This means fan oven temperatures often need adjusting when using a standard oven. Converting 364 fan oven to Fahrenheit (400°F) ensures your dishes cook properly without over or undercooking.</p>
<p>Many recipes, especially those from the UK or Europe, list temperatures for fan ovens. If you're using a conventional oven or an air fryer, knowing how to convert these temperatures is essential. For more air fryer-specific conversions, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>

<h2>How to Convert 364 Fan Oven to Conventional Oven</h2>
<p>The general rule for converting fan oven to conventional oven temperatures is to increase the temperature by 20-25°F. For 364 fan oven, this means setting your conventional oven to 400°F. This adjustment accounts for the differences in heat distribution between the two oven types.</p>
<p>When using an air fryer, you might need to reduce the temperature slightly, as air fryers cook food faster than conventional ovens. Always check your food a few minutes early to avoid overcooking. For more tips on air fryer cooking, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a>.</p>

<h3>Temperature Conversion Chart</h3>
<p>Here's a quick reference for converting 364 fan oven to other oven types: Fan Oven 364°F = Conventional Oven 400°F = Air Fryer 375°F. These conversions ensure your dishes cook evenly, whether you're baking cakes or roasting vegetables.</p>

<h2>Common Uses for 364 Fan Oven Temperature</h2>
<p>364°F (400°F conventional) is ideal for roasting vegetables, baking cookies, or cooking chicken. This temperature provides enough heat to crisp the exterior while keeping the interior moist. It's a versatile temperature for many recipes, from savory to sweet.</p>
<p>If you're cooking frozen foods in your air fryer at this temperature, remember to shake or flip them halfway through. For more frozen food tips, visit our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/frozen-foods>frozen foods category</a>.</p>

<h3>Adjusting Cooking Times</h3>
<p>When converting 364 fan oven to conventional oven, you may need to adjust cooking times slightly. Conventional ovens often take longer to cook food than fan ovens, so add 5-10 minutes to the original recipe time. Always check for doneness with a thermometer or skewer.</p>

<h2>Tips for Perfect Results</h2>
<p>Use an oven thermometer to verify your oven's temperature accuracy. Ovens can vary, and an inaccurate thermostat could affect your results. Preheat your oven fully before baking, especially when converting temperatures.</p>
<p>For air fryer cooking at this temperature, avoid overcrowding the basket. Proper air circulation is key to even cooking. After cooking, clean your air fryer with our recommended <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner</a> to maintain performance.</p>

<h3>Recipe Adaptations</h3>
<p>When adapting recipes from fan oven to conventional oven or air fryer, consider the dish's moisture content. Cakes and breads might need slight temperature reductions to prevent drying out, while roasts can handle the full conversion.</p>

<p>125 grams of yogurt is approximately 0.5 cups (½ cup) in standard US and UK measurements. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise ingredient quantities ensure perfect results. Whether you’re whipping up a cake, marinade, or dip, knowing how to convert grams to cups makes cooking effortless.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Yogurt Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of yogurt in air fryer recipes ensures texture and moisture balance. Too much yogurt can make batters runny, while too little may dry out dishes like cakes or marinades. For example, our <a href="https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes">air fryer yogurt cake</a> relies on precise measurements for a fluffy, moist result. Always measure yogurt correctly to avoid kitchen mishaps.</p>  

<p>Different yogurt types (Greek, natural, or flavored) have slight density variations, but 125 grams generally equals ½ cup. If you’re using thicker Greek yogurt, fluff it lightly with a spoon before measuring. For more conversions, check our <a href="https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart">air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>  

<h3>Converting 125 Grams of Yogurt to Cups</h3>  
<p>To convert 125 grams of yogurt to cups, use a kitchen scale for accuracy. If you don’t have one, spoon the yogurt into a measuring cup without packing it down. Level it off with a knife for a precise ½ cup. This method works for most recipes, from <a href="https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert">desserts</a> to savory dishes.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for 125 Grams of Yogurt in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Yogurt is a versatile ingredient in air fryer recipes. Use 125 grams (½ cup) in marinades for chicken or lamb, adding tenderness and flavor. It’s also great for baking—try it in <a href="https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/breakfast">breakfast muffins</a> or as a substitute for buttermilk. Yogurt’s acidity helps activate baking soda, giving cakes a light texture.</p>  

<p>For a quick snack, mix 125 grams of yogurt with herbs for a dip or drizzle it over air-fried potatoes. Need cleaning tips for sticky yogurt spills? Our <a href="https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner">air fryer cleaner guide</a> has you covered.</p>  

<h3>Measuring Yogurt Without a Scale</h3>  
<p>If you’re without a scale, remember that 1 standard US/UK cup holds about 250 grams of yogurt. Half of that (125 grams) fills a ½ cup. For small quantities, tablespoons help—125 grams equals roughly 8 tablespoons. Always stir yogurt before measuring to ensure consistency.</p>

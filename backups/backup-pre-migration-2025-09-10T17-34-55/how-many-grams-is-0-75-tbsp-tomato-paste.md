<p>0.75 tablespoons (tbsp) of tomato paste equals approximately 11 grams. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements can make all the difference to your dish. Whether you're making a rich pasta sauce or a flavourful marinade, knowing this measurement ensures consistency.</p>

<h2>Why accurate tomato paste measurements matter</h2>
<p>Tomato paste is a concentrated ingredient that packs a powerful flavour punch. Using too much can overwhelm your dish, while too little might leave it tasting bland. When cooking in an air fryer, where ingredients cook quickly and intensely, getting the measurement right is even more crucial. That's why converting 0.75 tbsp tomato paste to grams (about 11g) helps achieve perfect results.</p>
<p>Many air fryer recipes from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> call for small amounts of tomato paste to create delicious coatings or sauces. The concentrated nature of tomato paste means even small quantity adjustments can significantly alter your dish's taste. That's why we recommend using digital scales for the most accurate measurements.</p>

<h2>How to measure 0.75 tbsp tomato paste</h2>
<p>Measuring 0.75 tbsp of tomato paste can be tricky without the right tools. Here are the most accurate methods to get exactly 11 grams of tomato paste for your air fryer recipes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Digital kitchen scales: The most precise method - simply spoon the paste until you reach 11g</li>
<li>Measuring spoons: Use a 1 tbsp measure and fill it three-quarters full</li>
<li>Visual estimation: About the size of a large grape or small walnut</li>
</ul>
<p>If you're preparing multiple air fryer meals, consider our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for quick reference to other common measurements. This is particularly handy when scaling recipes up or down.</p>

<h3>Tomato paste alternatives in air fryer cooking</h3>
<p>If you don't have tomato paste available, you can substitute 0.75 tbsp (11g) with other ingredients. Tomato purée (about 1.5 tbsp) or passata (2 tbsp) can work, though they'll add more liquid to your dish. For best results in air fryer cooking, you might need to adjust cooking times slightly when using substitutes.</p>

<h2>Common uses for 0.75 tbsp tomato paste in air fryer recipes</h2>
<p>This small but mighty measurement appears in many delicious air fryer dishes. Here are some popular ways to use 0.75 tbsp (11g) of tomato paste in your cooking:</p>
<ul>
<li>As a base for homemade air fryer pizza sauces</li>
<li>In marinades for chicken or vegetables before air frying</li>
<li>To add depth to air fried meatball recipes</li>
<li>In rubs for air fryer roasted potatoes</li>
<li>As a flavour booster in air fryer stews and casseroles</li>
</ul>
<p>For more inspiration, browse the <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipe category</a> at airfryerrecipe.co.uk where many dishes use this precise measurement of tomato paste to create rich, flavourful coatings.</p>

<h3>Storing leftover tomato paste</h3>
<p>After measuring out your 0.75 tbsp (11g), you'll likely have leftover tomato paste. To prevent waste, transfer it to an airtight container and refrigerate for up to 5 days. Alternatively, freeze teaspoon-sized portions for future air fryer recipes - they'll thaw quickly when needed.</p>

<h2>Conversion table for tomato paste measurements</h2>
<p>Here's a handy reference for converting different amounts of tomato paste between tablespoons and grams:</p>
<ul>
<li>0.25 tbsp = ~4g</li>
<li>0.5 tbsp = ~7g</li>
<li>0.75 tbsp = ~11g</li>

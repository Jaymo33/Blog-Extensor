<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>
<p>Baking soda is a staple in many air fryer recipes, from crispy coatings to fluffy cakes. Using the right amount ensures your dishes turn out perfectly. Too much can leave a bitter taste, while too little might not give the desired rise. That’s why converting 5g of baking soda to ounces (0.18 oz) is so important.</p>
<p>Air fryers cook food quickly and evenly, but they rely on precise ingredient ratios. Whether you’re making <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>air fryer cakes</a> or savoury snacks, accurate measurements guarantee consistency. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a> simplifies this process, so you never have to guess.</p>

<h2>How to measure 5g of baking soda without scales</h2>
<p>Not everyone has a kitchen scale, but you can still measure 5g of baking soda (0.18 oz) accurately. A level teaspoon holds roughly 5g of baking soda, making it a handy alternative. Just ensure you’re using a proper measuring spoon and not a regular teaspoon from your cutlery drawer.</p>

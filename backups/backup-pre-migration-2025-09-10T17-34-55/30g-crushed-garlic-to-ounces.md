<p>30 grams of crushed garlic equals approximately 1.06 ounces. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements can make or break a dish. Whether you're preparing a garlic-infused roast or a quick stir-fry, knowing the exact weight ensures perfect seasoning. For more handy conversions, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate garlic measurements matter</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of crushed garlic can elevate your air fryer dishes from good to great. Too little, and the flavour falls flat; too much, and it overpowers the meal. Garlic’s intensity varies based on how finely it’s crushed, so weight is more reliable than volume. If you love garlic-heavy recipes like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>garlic butter chicken</a>, precise measurements are key. Always use a digital scale for the best results.</p>  

<p>Crushed garlic also releases more flavour than whole cloves, meaning 30g packs a punch. This measurement is common in UK recipes, so converting to ounces helps if your scale uses imperial units. For more recipe ideas, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipe collection</a>.</p>  

<h3>How to measure 30g of crushed garlic</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a scale, 30g of crushed garlic is roughly two heaped tablespoons. However, this can vary based on how tightly packed the garlic is. For consistent results, invest in a kitchen scale—it’s a game-changer for air fryer cooking. Cleaning garlic residue from your air fryer? Try our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>recommended cleaner</a>.</p>  

<h2>Common recipes using 30g of crushed garlic</h2>  
<p>Many air fryer dishes call for 30g of crushed garlic, from marinades to sauces. For example, garlic prawns or roasted vegetables benefit from this exact measurement. If you're cooking <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>garlic roasted veggies</a>, 30g ensures even flavour distribution. Always adjust to taste, especially if using fresh garlic.</p>  

<p>Garlic’s potency means it pairs well with oils and herbs in the air fryer. A 30g portion is ideal for recipes serving 2–4 people. For larger batches, scale up proportionally. Need inspiration? Browse our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/beef>garlic butter steak bites</a> recipe.</p>  

<h3>Converting other garlic measurements</h3>  
<p>If a recipe calls for cloves instead of grams, one medium clove weighs about 5g. So, 30g equals roughly six cloves. Remember, minced garlic is denser than crushed, so adjust accordingly. For more tips, visit <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>.</p>

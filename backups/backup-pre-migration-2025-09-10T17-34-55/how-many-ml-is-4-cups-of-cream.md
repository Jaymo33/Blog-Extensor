Always use a measuring jug for liquids to avoid guesswork and achieve the best texture and flavour.</p>  

<h3>Why Accurate Measurements Matter</h3>  
<p>Using the correct amount of cream can make or break a recipe. Too little, and your sauce might be too thick; too much, and it could become runny. For air fryer cooking, where heat distribution is rapid, precise measurements ensure even cooking. If you're preparing a dish like creamy garlic mushrooms, 4.0 cups of cream in ml (946 ml) guarantees the right consistency.

<h3>Tips for Measuring Cream Accurately</h3>  
<p>Always use a liquid measuring jug for cream, as dry cups can lead to inaccuracies. Pour slowly to the 946 ml mark for 4.0 cups, ensuring no air bubbles distort the measurement.

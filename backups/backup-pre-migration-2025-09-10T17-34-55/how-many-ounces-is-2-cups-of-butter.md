<p>2 cups of butter equals 16 ounces (or 1 pound) in the UK and US measurement systems. This conversion is essential for baking, cooking, and especially when using an air fryer, where precise measurements can make or break a recipe. Whether you're whipping up a cake or preparing a buttery dish in your air fryer, knowing how to convert 2 cups of butter to ounces ensures consistency and delicious results.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Butter Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Getting the right amount of butter is crucial for achieving the perfect texture and flavour in your dishes. Too much butter can make baked goods greasy, while too little can leave them dry. In air fryer cooking, precise measurements help ensure even cooking and prevent excess oil from dripping into the basket. For example, if you're making <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer cookies</a>, using the correct amount of butter ensures they come out crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside.</p>  
<p>Butter is often measured by volume (cups) or weight (ounces or grams). While volume measurements are convenient, weight measurements are more accurate. This is especially important for air fryer recipes, where even small deviations can affect cooking times and results. If you're unsure, refer to our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for quick reference.</p>  

<h2>How to Measure 2 Cups of Butter Correctly</h2>  
<p>Measuring butter can be tricky, especially if you're using sticks or blocks. In the UK, butter is often sold in 250g blocks, which is roughly 1 cup (8 ounces). To measure 2 cups of butter, you'll need 16 ounces or 500g. If you're using sticks, 2 cups equal 4 sticks (each stick is 1/2 cup or 4 ounces).</p>  
<p>For air fryer recipes, softened butter is often easier to measure accurately. Use a kitchen scale for the most precise results, especially when making delicate dishes like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>air fryer cakes</a>. If you don't have a scale, pack the butter firmly into a measuring cup and level it off with a knife. Avoid air gaps, as these can lead to under-measuring.</p>  

<h3>Converting 2 Cups of Butter to Other Units</h3>  
<p>If you're working with a recipe that uses grams or milliliters, 2 cups of butter convert to approximately 500g or 473ml. This is handy for international recipes or when using a digital scale. For air fryer cooking, grams are often the most reliable unit, as they eliminate any ambiguity between US and UK cup measurements.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for 2 Cups of Butter in Air Fryer Recipes</h2>  
<p>Two cups of butter is a common measurement for larger batches of baked goods or rich dishes. In the air fryer, this amount might be used for recipes like buttery biscuits, shortbread, or even <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>air fryer desserts</a>. Because the air fryer circulates hot air evenly, it can handle buttery recipes without making them overly greasy.</p>  
<p>When using butter in the air fryer, it's important to monitor cooking times closely. Butter can brown quickly, so check your food periodically to avoid burning. For cleaning up afterward, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner guide</a> has tips for removing butter residue easily.</p>  

<h3>Tips for Storing and Handling Butter</h3>  
<p>Butter should be stored in the fridge or freezer to maintain freshness. If you're measuring 2 cups of butter for a recipe, let it soften at room temperature for about 30 minutes first. This makes it easier to measure and mix. For air fryer recipes, avoid using melted butter unless specified, as it can drip and cause smoke.</p>

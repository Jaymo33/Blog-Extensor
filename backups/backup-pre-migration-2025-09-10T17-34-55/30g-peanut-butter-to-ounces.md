<p>30 grams of peanut butter equals approximately 1.06 ounces. This conversion is handy for air fryer recipes where precise measurements matter, ensuring your dishes turn out perfectly every time. Whether you're making peanut butter cookies or a savoury satay sauce, knowing this conversion helps streamline your cooking process.</p>  

<h2>Why Convert 30g of Peanut Butter to Ounces?</h2>  
<p>Many UK recipes, especially those for air fryers, use grams for accuracy, while some kitchen scales or older recipes might list ounces. Converting 30g of peanut butter to ounces (1.06 oz) ensures you’re using the right amount for consistent results. This is particularly useful for baking, where even small measurement discrepancies can affect texture and taste.</p>  
<p>At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we emphasise precision in measurements to help you nail every dish. For more conversions, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>, which covers common ingredients and their weight equivalents.</p>  

<h2>How to Measure 30g of Peanut Butter Accurately</h2>  
<p>Using a digital kitchen scale is the easiest way to measure 30g of peanut butter. Simply zero the scale with your container, then scoop the peanut butter until it hits 30g. If you don’t have a scale, two level tablespoons (about 30ml) will roughly equal 30g, though this can vary slightly depending on the peanut butter’s density.</p>  
<p>For sticky ingredients like peanut butter, lightly greasing your measuring spoon or using a spatula can help ensure you get every bit into your mix. This trick is especially handy for air fryer recipes like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cookies>peanut butter cookies</a>, where consistency is key.</p>  

<h3>Common Uses for 30g of Peanut Butter in Air Fryer Recipes</h3>  
<p>Peanut butter is a versatile ingredient in air fryer cooking. A 30g portion works well in sauces, dips, or as a binding agent for energy balls. Try adding it to <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert recipes</a> for a rich, nutty flavour, or mix it into marinades for a hint of sweetness.</p>  

<h2>Converting Other Peanut Butter Amounts</h2>  
<p>If your recipe calls for more or less peanut butter, here’s a quick reference: 15g equals 0.53 oz, 50g equals 1.76 oz, and 100g equals 3.53 oz. Bookmark our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a> for easy access to these measurements.</p>  
<p>Remember, natural peanut butter may settle, so always stir it well before measuring to avoid oily or dense portions. This ensures your air fryer dishes, like satay chicken or peanut butter granola, turn out perfectly balanced.</p>  

<h3>Tips for Storing and Using Peanut Butter</h3>  
<p>To keep peanut butter fresh, store it in a cool, dark place and seal the jar tightly after each use. If you’re using it frequently for air fryer recipes, consider portioning it into 30g servings for convenience.

<p>2 cups of rice flour equals approximately 9.6 ounces (or 272 grams). Whether you're baking gluten-free treats or experimenting with air fryer recipes, accurate measurements are key. Rice flour is a staple in many kitchens, especially for those avoiding wheat, and knowing its weight ensures consistent results.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter for Air Fryer Recipes</h2>  
<p>Using the correct amount of rice flour can make or break your air fryer creations. Too much flour can lead to dry, crumbly results, while too little may cause batters to spread unevenly. For example, if you're making air fryer tempura or gluten-free onion bhajis, precise measurements ensure the perfect crispiness. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for other common ingredient swaps.</p>  

<p>Rice flour is lighter than all-purpose flour, so volume-to-weight conversions differ. This is especially important for recipes like air fryer doughnuts or crispy coatings, where texture is everything. A kitchen scale is your best friend here, but if you don’t have one, our guide will help you measure 2 cups of rice flour to ounces accurately.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure Rice Flour Correctly</h3>  
<p>Scooping rice flour directly from the bag can lead to packed cups, resulting in more flour than needed. For the most accurate 2 cups rice flour to ounces conversion, spoon the flour into your measuring cup and level it off with a knife. This method prevents compaction and ensures consistency across batches.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for Rice Flour in Air Fryers</h2>  
<p>Rice flour is a versatile ingredient in air fryer cooking. It’s often used for coating chicken, fish, or vegetables to achieve a light, crispy texture. For example, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> section includes gluten-free fried chicken that relies on rice flour for crunch.</p>  

<p>Beyond coatings, rice flour works well in batters for fritters or as a thickener in sauces. Since it lacks gluten, it won’t become chewy, making it ideal for delicate items like tempura. If you’re new to gluten-free baking, start with simple recipes and adjust measurements as needed.</p>  

<h3>Converting 2 Cups of Rice Flour to Ounces in the UK</h3>  
<p>In the UK, recipes often use grams, but ounces are still common for baking. To convert 2 cups of rice flour to oz UK, remember that 1 cup equals roughly 4.8 ounces. This means 2 cups weigh about 9.6 ounces, or 272 grams. Keep this in mind when adapting American recipes to UK measurements.</p>  

<h2>Tips for Storing Rice Flour</h2>  
<p>Rice flour has a shorter shelf life than wheat flour due to its higher fat content. Store it in an airtight container in a cool, dark place to prevent rancidity. If you use it infrequently, consider keeping it in the fridge or freezer. For more kitchen tips, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner</a> guide to maintain your appliance.</p>  

<p>Proper storage ensures your rice flour stays fresh, so your 2 cups rice flour to oz conversions remain accurate. Clumpy or stale flour can throw off measurements and affect recipe outcomes. Always check for off smells or discoloration before use.</p>  

<h3>Rice Flour vs. Other Gluten-Free Flours</h3>  
<p>Unlike almond or coconut flour, rice flour has a neutral taste and fine texture, making it a popular choice for air fryer recipes. However, its weight differs—2 cups of almond flour, for instance, weigh around 7 ounces, less than rice flour. Always adjust measurements when substituting flours.</p>

From air fryer cookies to cakes, precise measurements ensure success. Remember, 2 cups of rice flour equals 9.6 ounces, so weigh carefully for best results.</p>

<p>385 ml of lime juice is approximately 1.63 cups in the US measurement system and roughly 1.52 cups in the UK. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precision matters, especially when working with tangy ingredients like lime juice. Whether you're making marinades, dressings, or desserts, knowing the exact measurement ensures your dish turns out perfectly balanced.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Lime Juice Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Lime juice can make or break a recipe due to its strong acidity and flavour. Too much can overpower a dish, while too little might leave it bland. For air fryer cooking, where ingredients cook quickly and evenly, precise measurements are even more critical. A dish like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer lime-glazed shrimp</a> relies on the perfect balance of lime juice for that zesty kick.</p>  

<p>Using 385 ml of lime juice in a recipe might seem straightforward, but cup sizes differ between the US and UK. The US cup measures 240 ml, while the UK cup is 250 ml. This slight variation can affect your results, especially in baking or sauces. Always check whether your recipe follows UK or US measurements to avoid mishaps.</p>  

<h3>Converting 385 ml of Lime Juice for Air Fryer Recipes</h3>  
<p>If you're using an American recipe, 385 ml of lime juice equals about 1.63 cups. For UK recipes, it's closer to 1.52 cups. This difference might seem small, but in recipes where acidity plays a key role, like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>lime-marinated chicken</a>, accuracy ensures the right tang without overpowering.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for 385 ml of Lime Juice</h2>  
<p>This quantity is often used in larger batches of marinades, dressings, or cocktails. In air fryer cooking, it's perfect for glazes or citrus-infused dishes like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>key lime pie bites</a>. Since air fryers circulate hot air, lime juice helps tenderise proteins while adding brightness.</p>  

<p>Another great use is in homemade cleaning solutions for your air fryer. A mix of 385 ml lime juice, water, and baking soda makes a natural <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner</a> that cuts through grease without harsh chemicals. The acidity breaks down residue while leaving a fresh scent.</p>  

<h3>Tips for Measuring Lime Juice Accurately</h3>  
<p>Always use a liquid measuring cup for lime juice, not dry measuring cups, for precision. If your recipe calls for 385 ml but you only have fresh limes, about 12-14 medium limes will yield this amount. For consistent results in air fryer cooking, consider using bottled lime juice unless freshness is crucial.</p>  

<h2>Adjusting Recipes with 385 ml of Lime Juice</h2>  
<p>If a recipe calls for a different amount, refer to a reliable <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a> to scale it properly. For example, halving 385 ml would be 192.5 ml or roughly 0.81 US cups. Air fryer recipes often need slight adjustments due to faster cooking times, so precise measurements prevent over-reduction.</p>  

<p>When substituting lime juice in recipes, remember that bottled and fresh lime juice differ slightly in acidity. If using fresh, taste as you go, especially in dishes like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/seafood>citrusy seafood</a> where balance is key. The air fryer's intense heat can amplify flavours, so err on the side of caution with acidic ingredients.</p>

<p>1 cup of soy milk equals approximately 8.45 ounces (240 ml). This measurement is key for air fryer recipes, ensuring consistency in texture and flavour. Whether you're making dairy-free pancakes or a creamy dip, knowing this conversion helps avoid kitchen mishaps. For more air fryer measurement tips, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on precise ingredient ratios to deliver crispy, evenly cooked dishes. Too much or too little liquid, like soy milk, can affect browning and texture. For example, adding extra soy milk to batter might make it too thin, leading to soggy results. Stick to the 8.45-ounce measure for 1 cup to keep recipes on track. Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a> for perfectly measured ideas.</p>  

<p>British measuring cups differ slightly from US standards, so using weight (ounces) eliminates confusion. A kitchen scale ensures accuracy, especially for baked goods like dairy-free muffins. If you’re adapting a traditional recipe for your air fryer, converting cups to ounces is a smart first step. Need inspiration? Try our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>air fryer cake recipes</a>.</p>  

<h3>How to measure soy milk without a scale</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a scale, use a liquid measuring cup designed for UK fluid ounces. Fill it to the 240ml mark for 1 cup of soy milk. Avoid dry measuring cups, as they can’t account for liquid density. For sticky ingredients like soy milk, lightly grease the cup for easier pouring. Discover more tips in our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning guide</a> to keep tools in top shape.</p>  

<h2>Common recipes using 1 cup of soy milk</h2>  
<p>From vegan mac ‘n’ cheese to fluffy pancakes, soy milk is a versatile air fryer staple. A 1-cup (8.45-ounce) portion works perfectly in batters, sauces, and marinades. For a crispy coating, mix soy milk with flour for a dairy-free dredge. Find creative uses in our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable recipes</a>.</p>  

<p>Adjusting oven recipes for air fryers? Reduce soy milk by 1-2 tablespoons to account for faster evaporation. The concentrated heat intensifies flavours, so precise measurements prevent overpowering tastes. Always preheat your air fryer for consistent results with liquid-heavy ingredients like soy milk.</p>  

<h3>Soy milk vs. dairy milk in air fryer recipes</h3>  
<p>Soy milk’s slightly thicker texture means it behaves differently than dairy milk at high heat. Its 8.45-ounce-per-cup density helps create crispier coatings, ideal for tofu or chicken. For best results, shake the carton well before measuring to evenly distribute proteins. Craving crunch?

<p>75 grams of oats equals approximately 2.65 ounces. Whether you're preparing breakfast or baking in your air fryer, getting the measurements right is key to perfect results. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we know how important precision is for air fryer cooking, especially when dealing with ingredients like oats.</p>

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of oats ensures your recipes turn out as intended. Too much or too little can affect texture, cooking time, and even taste. For example, if you're making air fryer granola or oat-based cookies, 75g of oats (2.65 oz) is a common measurement. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more handy measurements.</p>  

<p>Oats are a versatile ingredient, whether you're whipping up a quick breakfast or adding crunch to a dessert. If you're new to air frying, precise measurements help avoid undercooking or burning. For more recipe ideas, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipes section</a>.</p>  

<h3>How to measure 75g of oats without scales</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a kitchen scale, you can use measuring cups or spoons. Roughly, 75g of oats is about ¾ cup. However, this can vary slightly depending on how packed the oats are. For best results, we recommend investing in a digital scale for accuracy.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for 75g of oats in air fryer recipes</h2>  
<p>Oats are a staple in many air fryer recipes, from breakfast to desserts. A 75g portion is perfect for making single-serving granola, oat bars, or even coating for chicken or fish. Visit our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/breakfast>breakfast category</a> for inspiration.</p>  

<p>You can also use 75g of oats to bulk up smoothies or create a crispy topping for fruit crumbles. The air fryer gives oats a lovely toasted flavour, making them even more delicious.

<h3>Converting other oat measurements</h3>  
<p>If you need to convert other amounts, remember that 1 gram of oats is roughly 0.035 ounces. This makes it easy to scale recipes up or down. For example, 100g would be 3.5 ounces, while 50g would be 1.75 ounces.</p>  

<h2>Tips for cooking with oats in your air fryer</h2>  
<p>Oats can burn quickly in the air fryer, so keep an eye on them. Stirring occasionally helps ensure even cooking. If you're making granola, mix 75g of oats with a little honey or oil for extra crispiness.</p>  

<p>For savoury dishes, oats make a great binder in veggie burgers or meatballs. The high heat of the air fryer gives them a satisfying crunch. Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetables category</a> for more ideas.</p>  

<h3>Storing leftover oats</h3>  
<p>If you have leftover oats, store them in an airtight container to keep them fresh. They’ll last for months in the cupboard or longer in the fridge. Just remember to measure out 75g (2.65 oz) portions for consistent results in future recipes.</p>

<p>1.5 cups of sesame seeds equals approximately 7.2 ounces. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements ensure perfect texture and flavour. Whether you're making sesame-crusted chicken or adding a nutty crunch to roasted vegetables, knowing the exact weight helps avoid over or under-seasoning. For more air fryer measurement tips, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Using the correct amount of sesame seeds ensures even cooking and prevents burning in your air fryer. Too many seeds can create excess oil, while too few may leave your dish lacking flavour. Air fryers circulate hot air rapidly, so balanced ingredient ratios are crucial. If you're experimenting with new recipes, visit <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>our recipe collection</a> for inspiration. Precise measurements also help when scaling recipes up or down for different serving sizes.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure Sesame Seeds Correctly</h3>  
<p>For the most accurate conversion, use a kitchen scale to weigh sesame seeds directly in ounces. If you don’t have one, lightly spoon the seeds into a measuring cup without packing them down. Avoid tapping the cup, as this compacts the seeds and skews the measurement. For air fryer-friendly dishes like sesame-crusted tofu or salmon, consistency is key—so measure carefully!</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for Sesame Seeds in Air Fryer Recipes</h2>  
<p>Sesame seeds add a delightful crunch to air-fried dishes, from breaded meats to roasted veggies. Try sprinkling them over <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>air-fryer chicken</a> or mixing them into homemade granola bars. Their high oil content means they toast quickly, so keep an eye on cooking times. For cleaning tips after oily recipes, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner guide</a> has you covered.</p>  

<h3>Converting Other Sesame Seed Measurements</h3>  
<p>If your recipe calls for tablespoons or grams, here’s a quick reference: 1 tablespoon of sesame seeds weighs roughly 0.3 ounces, and 100 grams equals about 3.5 ounces.

Remember, slight variations in seed size can affect weight, so adjust as needed.</p>

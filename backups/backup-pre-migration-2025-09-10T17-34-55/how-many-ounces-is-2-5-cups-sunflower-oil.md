<p>2.5 cups of sunflower oil equals approximately 20 fluid ounces (fl oz) or 19.5 ounces by weight (oz). This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes, where precise measurements ensure perfect results. Whether you’re frying, baking, or roasting, knowing the exact weight of your ingredients makes all the difference. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we help you nail every recipe with accurate conversions and expert tips.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air frying</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of sunflower oil in your air fryer ensures even cooking and prevents excess grease. Too much oil can lead to soggy food, while too little may cause sticking or uneven browning. For dishes like crispy chicken or roasted vegetables, 2.5 cups of sunflower oil (20 fl oz) is often ideal for coating or shallow frying. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more handy measurement guides.</p>  

<p>Sunflower oil is a popular choice for air frying due to its high smoke point and neutral flavour. Whether you’re making <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>air fryer chicken</a> or crispy chips, measuring 2.5 cups (20 fl oz) correctly ensures consistency. Keep a kitchen scale handy for weight-based recipes, especially when precision is key.</p>  

<h3>Converting cups to ounces for sunflower oil</h3>  
<p>One cup of sunflower oil typically equals 8 fluid ounces (fl oz) or roughly 7.8 ounces by weight. For 2.5 cups, that’s 20 fl oz or 19.5 oz by weight. This slight difference matters in baking or when following strict dietary guidelines. Always check whether your recipe uses fluid ounces (volume) or weight ounces to avoid mistakes.</p>  

<h2>How to measure sunflower oil for air fryer recipes</h2>  
<p>For best results, use a liquid measuring cup for fluid ounces or a kitchen scale for weight. Pouring 2.5 cups (20 fl oz) of sunflower oil into your air fryer basket ensures even coverage without overdoing it. If your recipe calls for weight, 19.5 oz is the equivalent. Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> for inspiration on using sunflower oil effectively.</p>  

<p>Sunflower oil’s light texture makes it perfect for air frying, but measuring it correctly is crucial. Too much oil can cause smoke, while too little may dry out your food. For dishes like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/potatoes>air fryer potatoes</a>, 2.5 cups (20 fl oz) is often the sweet spot for achieving that golden crispiness.</p>  

<h3>Common mistakes when measuring oil</h3>  
<p>Many home cooks confuse fluid ounces with weight ounces, leading to inaccurate measurements. Remember, 2.5 cups of sunflower oil is 20 fl oz by volume but 19.5 oz by weight. Using the wrong type of measuring tool can throw off your recipe, so always double-check.

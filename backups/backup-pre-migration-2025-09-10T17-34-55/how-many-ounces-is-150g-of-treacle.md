<p>150g of treacle equals approximately 5.29 ounces. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements can make or break a dish. Whether you're making sticky toffee pudding or glazing meats, knowing how to convert grams to ounces ensures perfect results every time. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we help simplify these conversions so you can focus on cooking.</p>  

<h2>Why converting 150g of treacle to ounces matters</h2>  
<p>Many UK recipes, especially those for air fryers, list ingredients in grams, while some cooks prefer ounces. Converting 150g of treacle to ounces (5.29 oz) ensures accuracy, whether you're baking or cooking. Treacle’s thick consistency means even small measurement errors can affect texture and flavour. For more air fryer measurement tips, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>  

<p>Using the correct amount of treacle is crucial for recipes like gingerbread or treacle tart. Too much can overpower other flavours, while too little may leave your dish lacking sweetness. If you're new to air fryer baking, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> for inspiration.</p>  

<h3>How to measure treacle accurately</h3>  
<p>Measuring treacle can be tricky due to its sticky nature. For 150g (5.29 oz), lightly grease your measuring spoon or cup to help the treacle slide out easily. A digital kitchen scale is the most precise tool for this conversion. If you're working with smaller quantities, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a> covers everything from grams to ounces.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for 150g of treacle in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Treacle adds depth to both sweet and savoury air fryer dishes. A 150g (5.29 oz) portion is perfect for glazing ham, making flapjacks, or adding richness to cakes. Its robust flavour pairs well with spices like ginger and cinnamon, making it a staple in many <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert recipes</a>.</p>  

<p>For a quick treat, try brushing treacle on air-fried apples or pears. It caramelises beautifully under high heat, adding a glossy finish. If you're experimenting with treacle in your air fryer, always measure carefully—150g is the sweet spot for most recipes.</p>  

<h3>Tips for working with treacle in air fryers</h3>  
<p>Treacle can burn quickly in an air fryer due to its sugar content. To prevent this, mix 150g (5.29 oz) with a little water or butter before applying it to food. Always preheat your air fryer and monitor cooking times closely.

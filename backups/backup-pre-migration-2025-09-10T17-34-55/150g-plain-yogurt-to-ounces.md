<p>150g of plain yogurt equals approximately 5.29 ounces. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements can make or break a dish. Whether you’re whipping up a creamy dip or a fluffy cake, knowing the exact weight ensures perfect results every time. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we’re all about making cooking simpler, so let’s dive deeper into why this conversion matters.</p>

<h2>Why convert 150g of plain yogurt to ounces?</h2>  
<p>Many UK recipes, especially those for air fryers, use grams, while some kitchen scales or international recipes might list ounces. Converting 150g of plain yogurt to ounces (5.29 oz) ensures you’re using the right amount for consistency. Whether you’re making a marinade or a dessert, accuracy is key. For more conversions, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>  

<p>Plain yogurt is a versatile ingredient in air fryer cooking, from tenderising meats to adding moisture to baked goods. A slight miscalculation could alter the texture or taste of your dish. That’s why we recommend using a digital scale for the most precise measurements. If you’re exploring new recipes, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a> has plenty of ideas to try.</p>  

<h3>How to measure 150g of plain yogurt without scales</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a scale, 150g of plain yogurt is roughly 5 heaped tablespoons or just under 2/3 of a standard UK cup (250ml). However, this method isn’t as accurate as weighing, so for best results, invest in a kitchen scale. Air fryer recipes often rely on precise ratios, especially for baking, where even small deviations can affect the outcome.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for 150g of plain yogurt in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Plain yogurt is a staple in many air fryer recipes, from marinades to desserts. For example, 150g (5.29 oz) of yogurt can be used to coat chicken before air frying, resulting in juicy, flavourful meat. It’s also great for making lighter versions of cakes or muffins, as it adds moisture without excess fat. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipes</a> for inspiration.</p>  

<p>Yogurt can even be used in savoury dishes, like dips or sauces for air-fried vegetables. If you’re meal prepping, 150g portions are ideal for single servings. For more ideas, browse our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/meal-prep>meal prep section</a>. Remember, keeping your air fryer clean is just as important as accurate measurements, so don’t forget to use our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning guide</a>.</p>  

<h3>Tips for storing and using plain yogurt in air fryer recipes</h3>  
<p>Always check the expiration date on your yogurt, as fresh ingredients yield the best results. If your recipe calls for 150g of plain yogurt but you’ve opened a larger tub, store the remainder in an airtight container in the fridge. Stir well before using, as yogurt can separate over time. For longer storage, consider freezing portions in 150g amounts, though the texture may change slightly when thawed.</p>

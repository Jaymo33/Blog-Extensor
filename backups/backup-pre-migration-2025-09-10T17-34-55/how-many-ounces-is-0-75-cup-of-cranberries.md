<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Precision is key when using an air fryer, as ingredient ratios affect texture and cooking times. Too many cranberries can overcrowd the basket, while too few may dry out. Measuring 0.75 cup of cranberries correctly (3 ounces) ensures even cooking and perfect results. This is especially important for recipes like cranberry oat bars or stuffed chicken breasts. Visit <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>our recipe hub</a> for more inspiration.</p>  

<p>Air fryers circulate hot air, so balanced ingredients cook uniformly. Whether you're making a cranberry glaze or adding them to a grain bowl, 0.75 cup (3 ounces) is a handy measurement. For frozen cranberries, note they may weigh slightly more due to ice content. Always fluff them before measuring for consistency.</p>  

<h3>Converting 0.75 cup of cranberries to ounces</h3>  
<p>One cup of whole cranberries typically weighs 4 ounces, so 0.75 cup equals 3 ounces. This applies to both US and UK measurements. If your recipe calls for chopped cranberries, the weight remains similar, but volume may vary slightly.

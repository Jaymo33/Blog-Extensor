<p>0.75 cup of pumpkin seeds equals approximately 3.5 ounces (or 100 grams). This measurement is essential for air fryer recipes, ensuring you get the perfect crunch and flavour every time. Whether you're roasting them as a snack or using them as a topping, accurate measurements make all the difference.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Using the correct amount of pumpkin seeds ensures even cooking and prevents overcrowding in your air fryer basket. Overloading can lead to unevenly roasted seeds, while too few might burn quickly. For best results, stick to the 0.75 cup (3.5 oz) measurement when following recipes from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>.</p>  
<p>Pumpkin seeds are a fantastic source of protein and healthy fats, making them a popular choice for air fryer snacks. Whether you're making a batch for meal prep or adding them to salads, knowing the exact weight helps maintain consistency. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more handy measurements.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure 0.75 Cup of Pumpkin Seeds</h3>  
<p>For precision, use a dry measuring cup and level off the top with a straight edge. If you don’t have a measuring cup, a kitchen scale set to ounces will give you the exact 3.5 oz needed. This method is especially useful for recipes requiring exact quantities, like those in our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/snacks>snacks category</a>.</p>  

<h2>Best Ways to Use Pumpkin Seeds in Your Air Fryer</h2>  
<p>Roasted pumpkin seeds are a versatile ingredient, perfect for salads, soups, or as a standalone snack. Toss them with a bit of olive oil and salt, then air fry at 160°C for 8–10 minutes. For more inspiration, browse our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a>.</p>  
<p>You can also use pumpkin seeds as a crunchy topping for air-fried vegetables or mixed seafood dishes. Their nutty flavour pairs well with spices like paprika or cumin. Just remember, 0.75 cup of pumpkin seeds equals 3.5 oz—so measure carefully for the best results.</p>  

<h3>Storing Leftover Pumpkin Seeds</h3>  
<p>If you have extra pumpkin seeds, store them in an airtight container to maintain freshness. They’ll keep for up to two weeks at room temperature. For longer storage, freeze them in portions—just measure out 0.75 cup (3.5 oz) batches for future use.</p>  

<h2>Common Mistakes When Measuring Pumpkin Seeds</h2>  
<p>One of the biggest mistakes is using a liquid measuring cup instead of a dry one, which can lead to inaccuracies. Another is guessing the weight—always use a scale if possible. For more tips on perfecting your air fryer techniques, visit <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>.</p>  
<p>Packing the seeds too tightly into the cup can also skew the measurement. Instead, lightly fill the cup and level it off. This ensures you’re getting the correct 3.5 oz equivalent for 0.75 cup of pumpkin seeds every time.</p>  

<h3>Converting Pumpkin Seed Measurements for Different Recipes</h3>  
<p>If a recipe calls for grams instead of ounces, 0.75 cup of pumpkin seeds is roughly 100 grams. This conversion is handy for international recipes or when using a metric scale.

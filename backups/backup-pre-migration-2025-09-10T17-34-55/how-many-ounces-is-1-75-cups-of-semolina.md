<p>1.75 cups of semolina equals approximately 10.5 ounces. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements can make or break your dish. Whether you’re making crispy semolina-coated chicken or a fluffy semolina cake, knowing the exact weight ensures consistent results every time.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on even heat distribution, and incorrect ingredient quantities can lead to uneven cooking. Semolina, a coarse wheat flour, is often used for coating or baking, and its weight can vary slightly depending on how it’s packed. Measuring 1.75 cups of semolina in ounces removes the guesswork, ensuring your recipes turn out perfectly. For more air fryer measurement tips, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>  

<p>Using a kitchen scale is the most accurate way to measure semolina, but if you don’t have one, our conversion guide will help. Semolina’s density means 1 cup typically weighs around 6 ounces, so 1.75 cups comes to roughly 10.5 ounces. This precision is especially useful for recipes like semolina-crusted fish or air-fried falafel.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure Semolina Without a Scale</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a scale, use the spoon-and-level method for the most accurate cup measurement. Gently spoon semolina into a measuring cup without packing it down, then level it off with a straight edge. This prevents over-measuring, which can throw off your recipe.

<h2>Common Uses for Semolina in Air Fryer Recipes</h2>  
<p>Semolina adds a delightful crunch to air-fried foods, from crispy chicken tenders to golden-brown vegetables. It’s also a key ingredient in air-fried desserts like semolina halva or cake. Knowing that 1.75 cups of semolina equals 10.5 ounces helps you adjust recipes effortlessly. For inspiration, browse our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert category</a>.</p>  

<p>Another popular use is coating fish or shrimp before air frying. The coarse texture of semolina creates a satisfying crunch without needing excessive oil. Whether you’re cooking for one or meal prepping, accurate measurements ensure your dishes are consistently delicious. Don’t forget to clean your air fryer afterward—our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning guide</a> makes it easy.</p>  

<h3>Converting Other Semolina Measurements</h3>  
<p>If your recipe calls for a different amount of semolina, here’s a quick reference: 1 cup = ~6 ounces, 0.5 cups = ~3 ounces, and 2 cups = ~12 ounces. These conversions work for most air fryer recipes, whether you’re making savoury or sweet dishes. For more tips, visit <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>.</p>

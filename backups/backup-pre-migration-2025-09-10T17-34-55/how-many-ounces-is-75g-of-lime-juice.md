<p>75g of lime juice is approximately 2.65 ounces. This conversion is handy when following air fryer recipes that require precise measurements, especially for marinades or dressings. Whether you're using fresh limes or bottled juice, knowing the exact weight-to-volume ratio ensures your dish turns out perfectly every time.</p>

<h2>Why Convert 75g of Lime Juice to Ounces?</h2>  
<p>Many UK recipes, especially those for air fryers, list ingredients in grams, while some kitchen scales or measuring tools use ounces. Converting 75g of lime juice to ounces (2.65 oz) helps maintain accuracy. This is particularly important for recipes where acidity balance matters, like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer marinades</a> or citrus-based sauces.</p>  
<p>Using the correct amount of lime juice ensures your food isn't too tart or bland. For example, a <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipe</a> might call for 75g of lime juice to tenderise the meat without overpowering it. Measuring precisely guarantees consistent results, whether you're cooking for one or meal prepping for the week.</p>

<h2>How to Measure 75g of Lime Juice</h2>  
<p>The easiest way to measure 75g of lime juice (2.65 oz) is with digital kitchen scales. Place your measuring cup on the scale, tare it to zero, then pour the juice until it hits 75g. If you don't have scales, use a liquid measuring cup marked in fluid ounces – though remember that weight (grams) and volume (ounces) aren't perfectly interchangeable for all liquids.</p>  
<p>For fresh limes, one medium lime yields about 30g (1 oz) of juice. So you'd need roughly 2.5 limes for 75g. Bottled lime juice is more consistent but check the label – some brands dilute their juice, affecting flavour intensity. Always taste and adjust if substituting bottled for fresh in <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>air fryer recipes</a>.</p>

<h3>Conversion Tips for Air Fryer Cooking</h3>  
<p>When adapting recipes for your air fryer, precise measurements like 75g lime juice to ounces matter more than with conventional cooking. The air fryer's rapid circulation means flavours concentrate quickly. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a> helps adjust traditional recipes for air frying, ensuring perfect results every time.</p>

<h2>Common Uses for 75g of Lime Juice</h2>  
<p>75g (2.65 oz) of lime juice features in many air fryer recipes. It's enough for marinating 500g of <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/shrimp>shrimp</a> or creating a zesty glaze for vegetables. The acidity helps tenderise proteins while adding bright flavour without excess liquid that could make food soggy in the air fryer.</p>  
<p>This quantity also works well in dressings for air-fried salads or as part of a cleaning solution for your <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer basket</a>. The citric acid helps break down grease while leaving a fresh scent – just mix with water and wipe after cooling.</p>

<h3>Storing Leftover Lime Juice</h3>  
<p>If your recipe only uses part of 75g lime juice, store the rest in an airtight container in the fridge for up to a week. Freeze small portions in ice cube trays for future use – each cube holds about 15g (0.5 oz), making it easy to measure out 75g when needed.</p>

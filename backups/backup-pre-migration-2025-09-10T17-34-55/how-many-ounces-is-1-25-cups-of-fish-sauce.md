<p>1.25 cups of fish sauce equals approximately 10 fluid ounces (oz). This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes, ensuring precise measurements for marinades, sauces, and glazes. Whether you’re cooking salmon, chicken, or tofu, accurate quantities make all the difference in flavour.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate fish sauce measurements matter</h2>  
<p>Fish sauce is a potent ingredient, and even small variations can significantly alter the taste of your dish. Too much can overpower, while too little may leave your meal lacking depth. For air fryer recipes, where flavours concentrate due to rapid cooking, precision is key. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we recommend measuring liquids like fish sauce by weight for consistency.</p>  

<p>Many home cooks assume cups and ounces are interchangeable, but fluid ounces measure volume, while weight ounces measure mass. Fish sauce has a density of about 1.2 g/ml, meaning 1.25 cups (296 ml) weighs roughly 355 grams or 12.5 weight ounces. However, most recipes refer to fluid ounces, so 10 fl oz is the standard conversion.</p>  

<h2>How to measure fish sauce for air fryer recipes</h2>  
<p>For best results, use a liquid measuring cup with clear markings at eye level. Pour the fish sauce slowly to avoid spills and check the meniscus (the curve at the liquid’s surface) for accuracy. If your recipe calls for 1.25 cups of fish sauce, fill to the 10-ounce line.</p>  

<h3>Using a kitchen scale</h3>  
<p>If you prefer weighing ingredients, set your scale to grams or ounces. Place your mixing bowl on the scale, tare it (zero it out), then pour fish sauce until it reaches 355 grams or 12.5 weight ounces. This method eliminates guesswork and ensures perfect results every time.</p>  

<h2>Common air fryer recipes using fish sauce</h2>  
<p>Fish sauce is a staple in many Asian-inspired air fryer dishes. Try it in our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer chicken wings</a> or <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/shrimp>shrimp recipes</a> for an umami boost. A 1.25-cup measurement might be used for larger batches, like meal prep or family-sized portions.</p>  

<p>For smaller servings, check our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a> to adjust quantities. Remember, fish sauce is salty, so balance it with lime juice, sugar, or water in marinades. Always taste as you go, especially when scaling recipes up or down.</p>  

<h2>Storing leftover fish sauce</h2>  
<p>Once opened, fish sauce keeps for months in the fridge. Transfer unused portions to an airtight container, and it’ll stay fresh for your next <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable stir-fry</a> or marinade.

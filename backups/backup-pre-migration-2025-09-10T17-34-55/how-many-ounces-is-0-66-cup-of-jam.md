<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on precise cooking times and ingredient ratios to deliver perfect results. Using the correct amount of jam, like 0.66 cup (or 5.28 ounces), ensures your dish isn’t too sweet or too dry. This is particularly important for recipes like air-fried pastries or glazed meats, where balance is key. If you're new to air frying, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a> offers plenty of inspiration.</p>  

<p>Jam density can vary slightly depending on the brand or type, but 0.66 cup generally translates to 5.28 ounces. For sticky ingredients like jam, measuring by weight (ounces) is often more reliable than volume (cups). This avoids discrepancies and guarantees your air fryer creations turn out just right.

<h3>How to measure 0.66 cup of jam without scales</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a kitchen scale, use a liquid measuring cup for 0.66 cup of jam. Fill it just below the 2/3 cup mark for accuracy. Alternatively, spoon the jam into the cup and level it off with a knife. Remember, 0.66 cup equals 5.28 ounces, so adjust your recipe accordingly.

<h3>Converting other jam quantities to ounces</h3>

<p>160 ml of yogurt equals approximately 0.68 cups in the UK and 0.67 cups in the US. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements can make or break your dish.

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>
<p>Using the correct amount of yogurt—or any ingredient—ensures your air fryer recipes turn out perfectly every time. Too much yogurt can make batters runny, while too little can dry out your dish. This is especially important for baking, where precision is key. If you’re working with 160 ml of yogurt, knowing its cup equivalent helps avoid guesswork. For more tips on perfecting your air fryer meals, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a>.</p>

<p>Air fryers cook food quickly and evenly, but only if the ingredients are measured correctly. Yogurt adds moisture and tenderness to dishes like marinated meats or baked goods. Whether you’re following a UK or US recipe, converting 160 ml of yogurt to cups ensures you stay on track.

<h2>How to Measure 160 ml of Yogurt Without a Scale</h2>
<p>If you don’t have a measuring jug, you can still accurately portion 160 ml of yogurt using standard cups. In the UK, 160 ml is roughly 0.68 cups, while in the US, it’s about 0.67 cups. A standard metric cup holds 250 ml, so 160 ml is just over half a cup. For best results, use a liquid measuring cup for yogurt, as its thickness can vary. Need more measurement tips? Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning and maintenance guide</a> to keep your tools in top shape.</p>

<h3>UK vs. US Cup Measurements</h3>
<p>It’s worth noting that UK and US cup measurements differ slightly. A UK cup is 284 ml, while a US cup is 240 ml. This means 160 ml of yogurt converts to 0.68 cups in the UK and 0.67 cups in the US. For most recipes, this small difference won’t matter, but for precision baking, it’s good to know. If you’re working with a US recipe, stick to the 0.67-cup measurement for 160 ml of yogurt.</p>

<h2>Common Recipes Using 160 ml of Yogurt</h2>
<p>Yogurt is a versatile ingredient in air fryer cooking, appearing in everything from cakes to marinades. For example, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>air fryer cake recipes</a> often call for 160 ml of yogurt to keep the batter moist. Yogurt also works wonders in marinades for chicken or lamb, tenderising the meat while adding flavour. Whether you’re baking or cooking, knowing how many cups 160 ml of yogurt equals ensures perfect results every time.</p>

<p>Another popular use for 160 ml of yogurt is in breakfast dishes like pancakes or muffins. The acidity in yogurt helps activate baking soda, giving your baked goods a light, fluffy texture. If you’re meal prepping, yogurt-based dips or sauces are a great way to add creaminess without excess fat.

<h3>Tips for Substituting Yogurt in Recipes</h3>
<p>If you’re out of yogurt, you can substitute sour cream or buttermilk in equal amounts. However, keep in mind that these alternatives may alter the flavour slightly. For vegan options, coconut or almond yogurt can replace dairy yogurt at a 1:1 ratio. Just remember to adjust other liquids if the substitute is thinner than regular yogurt. Always measure 160 ml of yogurt (or its substitute) accurately for the best results.</p>

<h2>Why accurate yogurt measurements matter</h2>  
<p>Using the correct amount of plain yogurt in recipes ensures balanced flavours and textures. Too much can make dishes soggy, while too little might leave them dry.

<p>Yogurt is a versatile ingredient in air fryer cooking, from tenderising meats to adding moisture to baked goods. Knowing that 0.75 cup equals 6 ounces means you can confidently adjust recipes without second-guessing. Whether you’re meal prepping or experimenting with new dishes, accurate conversions make all the difference.

<h2>How to measure 0.75 cup of plain yogurt</h2>  
<p>Measuring 0.75 cup of plain yogurt is simple with the right tools. Use a liquid measuring cup for the most accurate results, filling it to the three-quarter mark. Alternatively, a kitchen scale set to ounces will confirm you’ve reached the 6-ounce equivalent. This method eliminates guesswork and ensures your air fryer dishes turn out perfectly every time.</p>  

<h3>Using a kitchen scale</h3>  
<p>A digital kitchen scale is the most precise way to measure 0.75 cup of plain yogurt in ounces. Place your bowl on the scale, tare it to zero, then add yogurt until it reads 6 ounces. This method is ideal for recipes where exact proportions are crucial, such as baking or marinades.

The acidity breaks down proteins, resulting in juicier, more flavourful dishes.

<p>10 ml of chicken broth equals approximately 0.042 cups. This small measurement is often used in air fryer recipes to add flavour without overwhelming the dish. Whether you're making a sauce, marinade, or glaze, knowing this conversion ensures your cooking stays precise.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on precise cooking times and ingredient ratios to deliver crispy, evenly cooked results. Using too much or too little liquid, like chicken broth, can affect texture and taste. For example, adding excess broth might make food soggy, while too little could leave it dry.</p>  
<p>Many <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> call for small amounts of liquids, so understanding conversions like 10 ml to cups is essential. If you’re prepping a marinade for chicken or a glaze for vegetables, this knowledge ensures consistency. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more handy measurements.</p>  

<h2>How to Measure 10 ml of Chicken Broth Without a Scale</h2>  
<p>Not everyone has a kitchen scale or measuring jug handy, but there are easy ways to estimate 10 ml of chicken broth. A standard teaspoon holds about 5 ml, so two level teaspoons will give you roughly 10 ml. Alternatively, a tablespoon is around 15 ml, so fill it two-thirds full.</p>  
<p>For those who prefer visual cues, 10 ml is roughly the size of two dice. This tiny amount is perfect for enhancing flavours in air fryer dishes like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipes</a> without adding excess moisture. Always measure carefully to avoid altering your dish’s balance.</p>  

<h3>Common Uses for 10 ml of Chicken Broth in Air Fryer Cooking</h3>  
<p>Despite its small volume, 10 ml of chicken broth can elevate your cooking. It’s ideal for deglazing pans, thinning sauces, or adding depth to marinades. For example, a splash of broth in a garlic butter glaze can make air-fried shrimp or vegetables shine.</p>  

<h2>Converting Other Liquid Measurements for Air Fryer Recipes</h2>  
<p>If you’re working with larger quantities, it’s helpful to know that 240 ml equals 1 cup. This conversion is handy when scaling recipes up or down. For instance, if a dish calls for 1 cup of broth but you only need a fraction, you can adjust accordingly.</p>  
<p>Keep in mind that UK and US cup measurements differ slightly, so always double-check if following an international recipe. For more tips on perfecting your air fryer meals, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> guides and tutorials.</p>  

<h3>Tips for Storing Leftover Chicken Broth</h3>  
<p>If you’ve opened a carton of chicken broth for a 10 ml portion, store the rest properly to avoid waste. Transfer it to an airtight container and refrigerate for up to 4 days, or freeze in ice cube trays for easy future use. Each cube typically holds about 15 ml, so thaw as needed.</p>

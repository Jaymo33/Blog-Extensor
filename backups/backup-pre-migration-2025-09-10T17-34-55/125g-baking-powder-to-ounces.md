<p>125g of baking powder equals approximately 4.41 ounces. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements can make or break your dish. Whether you're whipping up cakes, batters, or crispy coatings, knowing how to convert grams to ounces ensures consistency. For more handy conversions, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Baking powder is a leavening agent, and using the right amount ensures your baked goods rise perfectly. Too little, and your cakes might turn out dense; too much, and they could collapse. Air fryers circulate hot air rapidly, so precise measurements are even more critical. If you're experimenting with new recipes, always measure ingredients like baking powder carefully. Visit <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>our recipe collection</a> for tried-and-tested ideas.</p>  

<p>Converting 125g of baking powder to ounces is simple with the right tools. A digital kitchen scale is ideal, but if you don't have one, our conversion guide helps. Remember, 1 gram equals roughly 0.035 ounces, so 125g translates to 4.41 ounces. This accuracy is especially useful for air fryer baking, where small deviations can affect texture and taste.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure 125g of Baking Powder Without a Scale</h3>  
<p>If you don't have a scale, you can use measuring spoons for approximate conversions. One teaspoon of baking powder weighs about 4g, so 125g would be roughly 31 teaspoons. However, this method isn't as precise as weighing, so for best results, invest in a scale.

<h2>Common Uses for 125g of Baking Powder in Air Fryer Recipes</h2>  
<p>125g of baking powder is a substantial amount, often used in larger batches of cakes, muffins, or batters. In air fryer cooking, it's perfect for making fluffy doughnuts or crispy tempura. Since air fryers cook faster than conventional ovens, the right leavening ensures even rising. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert section</a> for inspiration.</p>  

<p>Another great use for 125g of baking powder is homemade air fryer fried chicken. The baking powder helps create an ultra-crispy crust by drawing moisture to the surface. Just mix it with flour and spices for a foolproof coating. For cleaning tips after frying, see our guide on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer maintenance</a>.</p>  

<h3>Storing Baking Powder for Optimal Freshness</h3>  
<p>Baking powder loses potency over time, so store it in an airtight container away from moisture. If your 125g batch is leftover, label it with the date to track freshness. Test its effectiveness by mixing a teaspoon with hot water—if it bubbles vigorously, it's still active. Proper storage ensures your air fryer recipes turn out perfectly every time.</p>

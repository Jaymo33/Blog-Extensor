<p>160 ml of lime juice equals approximately 0.68 cups (just over 2/3 cup). This conversion is essential for recipes, especially when using an air fryer, where precise measurements can affect texture and flavour. Whether you're making marinades, dressings, or desserts, knowing how to convert 160 ml of lime juice to cups ensures consistent results. For more air fryer conversions, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Lime Juice Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of lime juice can make or break a dish. Too little, and your recipe might lack tang; too much, and it could become overpowering. When converting 160 ml of lime juice to cups, precision is key—especially in air fryer cooking, where evaporation rates differ from conventional ovens. Lime juice is a common ingredient in marinades, sauces, and even desserts, so getting the measurement right ensures balanced flavours. For more recipe ideas, visit our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipes section</a>.</p>  

<p>Air fryers excel at locking in moisture, but incorrect measurements can still lead to dry or soggy results. If a recipe calls for 160 ml of lime juice, using the correct cup equivalent (0.68 cups) ensures the dish cooks evenly. This is particularly important for citrus-based glazes or dressings, where consistency affects the final product. Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipes</a> for lime-infused dishes perfect for your air fryer.</p>  

<h3>Converting 160 ml of Lime Juice to Cups</h3>  
<p>To convert 160 ml of lime juice to cups, divide the millilitres by 237 (the number of ml in a standard US cup). This gives you roughly 0.68 cups, or just over 2/3 cup. If you’re in the UK, note that metric cups (250 ml) are slightly larger, making 160 ml equal to 0.64 cups. Always check whether your recipe uses US or UK measurements to avoid errors.

<h2>Using Lime Juice in Air Fryer Recipes</h2>  
<p>Lime juice adds brightness to air fryer dishes, from crispy chicken wings to zesty vegetables. When a recipe specifies 160 ml of lime juice, measuring accurately ensures the marinade or glaze isn’t too acidic or weak. For example, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/shrimp>shrimp recipes</a> often use lime juice for a fresh, tangy finish. Since air fryers circulate hot air, liquids reduce faster—so precise measurements prevent over-reduction.</p>  

<p>If you’re adapting a conventional recipe for the air fryer, remember that 160 ml of lime juice (0.68 cups) might need slight adjustments. Air fryers cook faster, so glazes or sauces with lime juice may thicken quicker than expected. For best results, start with the exact conversion and adjust to taste. Don’t forget to clean your air fryer after citrus-heavy recipes—our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning guide</a> has handy tips.</p>  

<h3>Common Recipes Using 160 ml of Lime Juice</h3>  
<p>Many dishes call for 160 ml of lime juice, from ceviche to key lime pie. In air fryer cooking, this amount is perfect for marinades—like those used in our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable recipes</a>. The acidity tenderises proteins and enhances flavours without overpowering. Whether you’re making tacos, skewers, or dressings, knowing that 160 ml equals 0.68 cups helps streamline prep.</p>

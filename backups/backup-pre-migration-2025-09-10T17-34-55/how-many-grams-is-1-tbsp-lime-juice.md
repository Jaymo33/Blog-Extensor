<p>1 tbsp of lime juice weighs approximately 15 grams. This measurement is key for air fryer recipes where precision ensures perfect flavour and texture. Whether you're marinating chicken or dressing a salad, knowing the exact weight helps avoid over or under-seasoning.

<h2>Why accurate lime juice measurements matter</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of lime juice can make or break a dish. Too little, and your meal lacks zest; too much, and it becomes overpowering. In air fryer cooking, balance is crucial, especially for marinades or glazes. A precise 15 grams per tbsp ensures consistency every time. Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a> for dishes that benefit from this exact measurement.</p>  

<p>Lime juice also affects texture, particularly in baked goods or sauces. Even a few grams off can alter the outcome, so accuracy matters. For example, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipes</a> often rely on lime juice for tenderising and flavour. Measuring correctly ensures your dish turns out as intended.</p>  

<h3>How to measure 1 tbsp lime juice in grams</h3>  
<p>The easiest way is to use a digital kitchen scale. Place your tablespoon on the scale, tare it to zero, then pour the lime juice until it reads 15 grams. If you don’t have a scale, a standard UK tablespoon holds roughly 15 grams of lime juice. For more tips, visit <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for lime juice in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Lime juice is a staple in many air fryer recipes, from marinades to dressings. It adds brightness to dishes like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/shrimp>shrimp skewers</a> or citrus-glazed vegetables. Knowing the gram weight helps you adjust recipes without compromising taste. It’s also handy for cleaning your air fryer—check our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning guide</a> for tips.</p>  

<p>For desserts, lime juice balances sweetness in treats like key lime pie or sorbets. A precise 15-gram tablespoon ensures the perfect tang. Whether savoury or sweet, accurate measurements elevate your air fryer creations.</p>  

<h3>Converting other lime juice measurements</h3>  
<p>If a recipe calls for teaspoons or millilitres, here’s a quick guide: 1 tsp lime juice is about 5 grams, and 1 ml is roughly 1 gram. These conversions help when scaling recipes up or down.

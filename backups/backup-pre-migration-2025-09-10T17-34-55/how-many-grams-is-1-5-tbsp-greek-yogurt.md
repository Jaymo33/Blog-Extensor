<p>1.5 tablespoons (tbsp) of greek yogurt equals approximately 22.5 grams in UK measurements. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precision ensures the best texture and consistency. Whether you’re making dips, marinades, or baked goods, knowing the exact weight saves time and avoids kitchen mishaps.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on even heat distribution, so ingredient ratios must be spot-on. Too much or too little greek yogurt can affect moisture levels, cooking times, and final results. For example, a marinade with 1.5 tbsp of greek yogurt (22.5g) helps tenderise chicken evenly, while a batter might need adjustments if the yogurt isn’t measured correctly. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for other common ingredient swaps.</p>  

<p>Greek yogurt is thicker than regular yogurt, so volume-to-weight conversions differ. A standard UK tablespoon holds 15ml, but density plays a role. For air fryer recipes like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken dishes</a>, 22.5g of greek yogurt provides the right acidity and creaminess without overwhelming other flavours.</p>  

<h3>How to measure 1.5 tbsp of greek yogurt without scales</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a kitchen scale, fill a tablespoon to the brim and level it off, then use half another tablespoon. For 1.5 tbsp of greek yogurt, this rough method gets you close to 22.5g, though scales are more reliable. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a> includes weight-based measurements for foolproof results.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for 1.5 tbsp of greek yogurt in air fryer recipes</h2>  
<p>This small but mighty quantity works wonders in air fryer cooking. Mix 1.5 tbsp (22.5g) of greek yogurt with herbs for a quick marinade, or swirl it into batters for added moisture. It’s also perfect for light dips—pair it with air-fried veggies from our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable category</a> for a healthy snack.</p>  

<p>In baking, 1.5 tbsp of greek yogurt (22.5g) can replace some fats, keeping cakes tender. Try it in our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>air fryer cake recipes</a> for a protein boost. After cooking, a dab of greek yogurt cleans stubborn air fryer grease—see our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning guide</a> for tips.</p>  

<h3>Does brand affect the weight of 1.5 tbsp of greek yogurt?</h3>  
<p>Full-fat greek yogurt is denser than low-fat versions, but the difference is minimal for small amounts like 1.5 tbsp (22.5g). Stick to the standard conversion unless a recipe specifies otherwise. For precision, always weigh ingredients when trying new dishes from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>.</p>

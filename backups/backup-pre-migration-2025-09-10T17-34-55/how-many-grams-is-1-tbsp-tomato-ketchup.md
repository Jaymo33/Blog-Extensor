<p>1 tablespoon (tbsp) of tomato ketchup weighs approximately 15 grams. This measurement is essential for air fryer recipes where precision matters, ensuring your dishes turn out perfectly every time. Whether you're glazing chicken wings or adding a tangy twist to meatballs, knowing the exact weight helps maintain consistency.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Using the correct amount of ingredients ensures your air fryer meals cook evenly and taste just right. Too much ketchup can make dishes overly sweet or soggy, while too little might leave them lacking flavour. For example, when making <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer chicken tenders</a>, a precise 15-gram dollop of ketchup per tablespoon ensures the perfect glaze. This accuracy is especially important for recipes like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>air fryer chicken recipes</a>, where balance is key.</p>  

<p>Many air fryer enthusiasts rely on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion charts</a> to switch between volume and weight measurements. Since air fryers cook food faster than conventional ovens, even small measurement errors can affect the outcome. A 15-gram tablespoon of ketchup ensures your marinades, dips, and sauces are spot-on every time.</p>  

<h2>How to Measure Tomato Ketchup for Air Fryer Recipes</h2>  
<p>For the most accurate results, use a digital kitchen scale to weigh your ketchup. Simply place a bowl on the scale, tare it to zero, and add ketchup until it reads 15 grams. If you don’t have a scale, a levelled tablespoon will give you a close approximation, though weights can vary slightly based on ketchup thickness.</p>  

<h3>Converting Other Ketchup Measurements</h3>  
<p>If your recipe calls for larger quantities, here’s a quick reference: 1 teaspoon of tomato ketchup is about 5 grams, while 1/4 cup weighs roughly 60 grams. These conversions are handy for batch cooking or meal prepping in your air fryer. For more tips, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion guide</a>.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for Tomato Ketchup in Air Fryer Recipes</h2>  
<p>Tomato ketchup isn’t just for dipping—it’s a versatile ingredient in air fryer cooking. Use it as a glaze for <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/beef>air fryer meatballs</a>, a marinade for chicken, or even as a base for homemade BBQ sauce. Since 1 tbsp equals 15 grams, you can easily adjust recipes to suit your taste without guesswork.</p>

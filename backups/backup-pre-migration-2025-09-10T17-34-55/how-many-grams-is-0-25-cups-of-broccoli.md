<p>0.25 cups of broccoli equals approximately 22 grams. This measurement is key for air fryer recipes where precision ensures even cooking and perfect texture. Whether you're whipping up a quick side or adding broccoli to a main dish, knowing this conversion helps avoid guesswork.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on hot air circulation to cook food evenly, so ingredient quantities matter. Too much broccoli can lead to steaming instead of crisping, while too little might burn. Measuring 0.25 cups of broccoli in grams ensures consistency, especially for recipes like roasted broccoli or stir-fries.

<p>Broccoli’s density can vary based on how it’s chopped—florets vs. stems—but 0.25 cups generally weighs around 22 grams. This makes it easy to scale recipes up or down without compromising results.

<h3>How to Measure 0.25 Cups of Broccoli</h3>  
<p>For accuracy, lightly pack chopped broccoli into a measuring cup without crushing it. If you don’t have cups, a kitchen scale simplifies things—just weigh out 22 grams. This method works for fresh or frozen broccoli, though frozen may need slight adjustments due to ice content.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for 0.25 Cups of Broccoli</h2>  
<p>This small-but-mighty portion is perfect for single servings or as part of a larger dish. Try it in air-fryer omelettes, grain bowls, or as a crispy topping for salads. For more ideas, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a>.</p>  

<p>Broccoli’s versatility shines in the air fryer—it can be roasted, steamed, or even turned into chips. Since 0.25 cups equals about 22 grams, you can easily adjust batch sizes. Need cleaning tips?

<h3>Converting Other Broccoli Amounts</h3>

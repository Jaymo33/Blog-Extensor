<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on precise ingredient ratios to achieve perfect texture and flavour. Too much tomato paste can overpower a dish, while too little might leave it bland. Measuring 5g of tomato paste correctly ensures your recipes turn out as intended. If you're new to air frying, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> for inspiration.</p>  

<p>Tomato paste is a concentrated ingredient, so even small amounts like 5g can have a big impact. Whether you're making a quick pizza sauce or a slow-cooked stew, accuracy is key.

<h3>How to measure 5g of tomato paste without scales</h3>  
<p>If you don't have a digital scale, you can estimate 5g of tomato paste using teaspoons. One level teaspoon holds roughly 5g of tomato paste, which is about 0.18 ounces. This method works well for small quantities in air fryer recipes.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for 5g of tomato paste in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Tomato paste adds depth to sauces, marinades, and even dry rubs. A small 5g portion can enhance the flavour of air-fried chicken, vegetables, or even homemade crisps. For recipe ideas, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipes</a> section.</p>  

<p>When working with 5g of tomato paste in an air fryer, remember it's highly concentrated. Dilute it with water or oil if using in sauces to prevent burning. For cleaning tips after cooking with sticky ingredients like tomato paste, visit our guide on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner</a>.</p>  

<h3>Storing leftover tomato paste</h3>  
<p>After measuring out your 5g portion, store the remaining tomato paste in an airtight container in the fridge. It will keep for about a week, ready for your next air fryer creation.</p>

<p>3 tablespoons (tbsp) of water equals approximately 45 grams (g). This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements can make all the difference. Whether you’re baking, frying, or steaming, knowing the exact weight ensures consistent results. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we focus on accuracy to help you achieve perfect dishes every time.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on precise ingredient ratios to deliver crispy, evenly cooked food. Too much or too little water can affect texture and cooking times. For example, adding 3 tbsp of water (45g) to a batter or marinade ensures the right consistency. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> simplifies these calculations, so you never have to guess.</p>  

<p>Many air fryer recipes, like those for <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>cakes</a> or steamed buns, require exact water measurements. Even a small deviation can lead to dry or soggy results. By converting 3 tbsp of water to grams (45g), you eliminate guesswork and ensure perfection. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a> for dishes that benefit from precise measurements.</p>  

<h3>How to measure 3 tbsp of water accurately</h3>  
<p>Use a standard UK tablespoon (15ml) for the most accurate results. Fill it to the brim without spilling, and level it off with a knife. Repeat three times to get 3 tbsp (45ml), which weighs 45g. For smaller quantities, a kitchen scale is invaluable, especially when working with air fryer recipes.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for 3 tbsp of water in air fryer recipes</h2>  
<p>From marinades to doughs, 3 tbsp of water (45g) plays a key role in many dishes. For example, it’s perfect for thinning sauces or creating steam for <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetables</a>. It also helps bind ingredients in homemade air fryer falafel or veggie burgers.</p>  

<p>If you’re reheating food, a spritz of water (about 3 tbsp) prevents drying out. Just be sure to measure carefully—too much can make food soggy. For more tips, explore our guide on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>keeping your air fryer clean</a> after cooking with liquids.</p>  

<h3>Converting other tablespoon measurements to grams</h3>  
<p>Need to convert 1 or 2 tbsp of water? Here’s a quick reference: 1 tbsp = 15g, 2 tbsp = 30g. These conversions are handy for scaling recipes up or down. Remember, accuracy is key for air fryer success!</p>

<p>2 cups of garlic paste equals approximately 16 ounces (or 1 pound) in weight. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements can make or break a dish. Whether you're whipping up a marinade or a sauce, knowing the exact weight ensures consistency and flavour balance.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on even cooking, and incorrect ingredient quantities can lead to uneven results. Too much garlic paste might overpower a dish, while too little could leave it bland. For perfect air fryer meals, always measure ingredients like garlic paste accurately. Visit <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>our conversion chart</a> for more handy measurement tips.</p>  

<p>Garlic paste is a staple in many recipes, from marinades to dips. Knowing how many ounces are in 2 cups helps you follow recipes precisely, especially when scaling up or down. If you're exploring new dishes, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> for inspiration.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure Garlic Paste Correctly</h3>  
<p>Use a liquid measuring cup for garlic paste, as itâ€™s thick but pourable. Scoop the paste into the cup and level it off with a spatula for accuracy. Avoid packing it down, as this can lead to over-measuring. For sticky ingredients like garlic paste, a quick spray of oil on the measuring cup can help it slide out easily.</p>  

<h2>Converting Cups to Ounces for Different Ingredients</h2>  
<p>Not all ingredients weigh the same per cup. While 2 cups of garlic paste is roughly 16 ounces, other ingredients like flour or sugar differ. Always refer to a reliable conversion guide, especially when adapting recipes for your air fryer. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable category</a> includes recipes where precise measurements are key.</p>  

<p>If you're unsure about conversions, a kitchen scale is a worthwhile investment. It eliminates guesswork and ensures your air fryer dishes turn out perfectly every time. For more cooking tips, explore <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>how to keep your air fryer clean</a> between uses.</p>  

<h3>Common Mistakes When Measuring Garlic Paste</h3>  
<p>One mistake is using a dry measuring cup instead of a liquid one, which can lead to inaccuracies. Another is eyeballing the amount, which often results in too much or too little. Always measure carefully, especially for strong flavours like garlic paste, to avoid overpowering your dish.</p>  

<h2>Using Garlic Paste in Air Fryer Recipes</h2>  
<p>Garlic paste adds depth to marinades, sauces, and rubs for air fryer dishes. Whether you're cooking chicken, vegetables, or seafood, the right amount ensures balanced flavour. Try our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipes</a> for delicious ways to use garlic paste.</p>  

<p>Remember, 2 cups of garlic paste equals 16 ounces, so adjust recipes accordingly. Too much can make a dish bitter, while too little might lack punch. For best results, stick to measured amounts and enjoy perfectly flavoured meals every time.</p>

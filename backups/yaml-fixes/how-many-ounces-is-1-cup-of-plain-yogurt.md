<h2>How many ounces is 1 cup of plain yogurt?</h2>  
<p>1 cup of plain yogurt equals approximately 8.64 ounces (245 grams) in the UK. This measurement is essential for air fryer recipes, ensuring accuracy for consistent results. Whether you’re making dips, marinades, or baked goods, knowing the weight helps avoid over or under-measuring. For more conversion tips, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>. Yogurt’s density can vary slightly, but this standard measurement works for most recipes.</p>  

<p>When using plain yogurt in your air fryer, precise measurements matter. Too much yogurt can make batters too wet, while too little may dry out dishes. Many <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> call for yogurt as a tenderiser or binder, so getting it right is key. If you’re scaling a recipe, remember that 1 cup equals roughly 8.64 ounces. For more cooking inspiration, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert recipes</a> featuring yogurt.</p>  

<h3>Why measuring yogurt correctly matters</h3>  
<p>Accurate measurements ensure your air fryer dishes turn out perfectly. Yogurt adds moisture and richness, but imbalance can affect texture. For example, air fryer cakes or muffins need precise ratios for the right crumb. If a recipe lists yogurt in ounces but you only have cups, this conversion saves time. Keep a kitchen scale handy for best results, or bookmark this guide for quick reference.</p>  

<h2>Converting cups to ounces for different yogurt types</h2>  
<p>While plain yogurt weighs about 8.64 ounces per cup, Greek yogurt is denser—around 10 ounces per cup. Always check your recipe’s requirements, as substitutions may need adjustments. For air fryer cooking, thicker yogurts like Greek work well in coatings or marinades. Lighter yogurts suit dressings or dips. Visit our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning guide</a> to keep your appliance spotless after sticky yogurt recipes.</p>  

<p>If you’re adapting a US recipe, note that UK cups differ slightly (1 UK cup = 8.64 oz vs. 8 oz in the US). This small variance can impact baking, so adjust accordingly. For savoury dishes like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>air fryer chicken</a>, yogurt measurements ensure juicy, flavourful results. When in doubt, weigh ingredients for precision.</p>  

<h3>Tips for measuring yogurt without scales</h3>  
<p>No kitchen scale? Use the spoon-and-level method: spoon yogurt into a measuring cup, then level it off with a knife. Avoid packing it down, as this adds excess weight. For small amounts, tablespoons help—1 cup equals 16 tablespoons (about 0.54 oz each). Sticky yogurt can be tricky, so lightly grease your measuring tools first.</p>  

<h2>Common yogurt uses in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Yogurt shines in air fryer recipes, from tenderising meats to creating crispy coatings. Marinate chicken in yogurt and spices for juicy kebabs, or mix it into batter for fluffy pancakes. Its acidity also helps break down proteins, making tougher cuts more succulent. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable recipes</a> for yogurt-based dips that pair perfectly with air-fried veggies.</p>  

<p>For healthier alternatives, yogurt replaces mayo or cream in many dishes. It binds ingredients in veggie burgers or adds tang to sauces. When baking, yogurt keeps cakes moist without excess oil. Experiment with flavoured yogurts, but adjust sugar levels in recipes. Remember, 1 cup of plain yogurt equals 8.64 ounces—whether you’re baking, marinating, or dipping.</p>

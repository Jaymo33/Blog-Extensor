<p>To reheat scones in an air fryer, set the temperature to 160°C (320°F) and warm them for 3–4 minutes. This method restores their crisp exterior while keeping the inside tender, making it far superior to microwaving. Whether your scones are freshly baked or stored overnight, an air fryer revives them with minimal effort. For more air fryer tips, visit <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>.</p>

<h2>Why Use an Air Fryer to Reheat Scones?</h2>
<p>Air fryers circulate hot air evenly, preventing scones from becoming soggy or drying out. Unlike microwaves, which can make baked goods rubbery, air fryers restore that just-baked texture. The rapid heating also means your scones are ready in minutes, perfect for a quick breakfast or afternoon tea. If you love scones, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> for more inspiration. Reheating scones in an air fryer is a game-changer for anyone who hates wasting leftovers.</p>

<p>Another advantage is the versatility—whether plain, fruit, or cheese scones, the air fryer handles them all. The compact size of most air fryers means they heat up faster than conventional ovens, saving energy. Plus, you won’t need to preheat, making it ideal for small batches. For best results, avoid overcrowding the basket to ensure even reheating. If you’re reheating scones from the fridge, let them sit at room temperature for 10 minutes first.</p>

<h2>Step-by-Step Guide to Reheating Scones</h2>
<h3>Preparing Your Scones</h3>
<p>If your scones are refrigerated, take them out 10 minutes beforehand to remove the chill. For frozen scones, thaw them overnight in the fridge or at room temperature for an hour. Lightly spritzing stale scones with water can help restore moisture before reheating. Place them in a single layer in the air fryer basket, leaving space between each for proper airflow. Avoid stacking, as this leads to uneven heating and soggy spots.</p>

<h3>Setting the Right Temperature and Time</h3>
<p>Preheat your air fryer to 160°C (320°F) for 2 minutes if your model requires it. Reheat scones for 3–4 minutes, checking halfway to prevent over-browning. Larger or denser scones may need an extra minute, while smaller ones could be ready sooner. For a crisper crust, brush the tops with a little melted butter before reheating. If you’re unsure about timing, refer to our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for guidance.</p>

<h2>Tips for Perfectly Reheated Scones</h2>
<p>To prevent dryness, wrap scones loosely in foil during the first half of reheating, then uncover for the last minute. Adding a slice of bread to the air fryer basket can absorb excess moisture and improve texture. For cheese scones, a quick 30-second blast at 180°C (356°F) at the end enhances browning. Always let reheated scones rest for a minute before serving—they’ll firm up slightly. For more baking tips, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>cake recipes</a> section.</p>

<p>If reheating multiple batches, keep finished scones in a warm oven (100°C) while you work through the rest. Avoid using parchment paper unless perforated, as it can block airflow in smaller air fryers. For gluten-free scones, reduce the temperature by 10°C to prevent over-drying. Cleaning your air fryer after use is easier if you use a dedicated <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner</a> to remove crumbs and grease.</p>

<h2>Common Mistakes to Avoid</h2>
<p>Overcrowding the basket is the top mistake—it leads to uneven heating and steamed rather than crispy scones. Reheating at too high a temperature can burn the exterior while leaving the centre cold. Skipping the preheat (if your model recommends it) may extend the total cooking time unnecessarily. Using a wet spritz on already moist scones can make them gummy rather than reviving them. Always adjust times based on your air fryer’s wattage and the scones’ size.</p>

<p>Another pitfall is reheating scones straight from the freezer without thawing—this creates icy pockets and a soggy texture. For day-old scones, a light butter brush works better than soaking them in liquid. If your air fryer has a reheat preset, test it first—some run too hot for delicate baked goods. Finally, avoid reheating cream-filled scones in the air fryer, as the filling may leak or split.</p>

<p>1 tablespoon (tbsp) of hot sauce weighs approximately 15 grams. This measurement is essential for air fryer recipes where precision ensures the perfect balance of flavour and texture. Whether you’re marinating chicken or spicing up vegetables, knowing the exact weight helps avoid over-seasoning.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on even heat distribution, and incorrect ingredient quantities can lead to uneven cooking. Hot sauce, with its liquid consistency, can vary in weight slightly depending on thickness. For consistent results, using a kitchen scale is ideal, especially when following recipes from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>.</p>  
<p>Many air fryer dishes, like spicy wings or marinated tofu, benefit from precise hot sauce measurements. Too much can overpower the dish, while too little might leave it bland. A 15-gram tablespoon ensures your meals are perfectly balanced every time.</p>  

<h2>Converting 1 Tbsp Hot Sauce to Grams</h2>  
<p>Converting tablespoons to grams is straightforward for hot sauce. Since most hot sauces have a similar density, 1 tbsp typically equals 15 grams. However, thicker sauces like sriracha may weigh slightly more, while thinner varieties could be closer to 14 grams.</p>  
<p>If you don’t have a scale, use a standard UK tablespoon (15ml) for accuracy. For more conversions, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> to simplify your cooking process.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure Hot Sauce Without a Scale</h3>  
<p>If you’re without a scale, fill a tablespoon evenly with hot sauce, levelling off the excess with a knife. This method ensures you’re close to the 15-gram mark. For recipes requiring larger quantities, multiply accordingly—e.g., 2 tbsp = 30 grams.</p>  

<h2>Using Hot Sauce in Air Fryer Recipes</h2>  
<p>Hot sauce adds depth to air-fried dishes like buffalo cauliflower or spicy shrimp. For best results, mix 1 tbsp (15g) with oil or marinades to evenly coat ingredients. Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>spicy chicken recipes</a> for inspiration.</p>  
<p>Remember, air fryers intensify flavours, so start with 1 tbsp and adjust to taste. Overdoing it can make dishes overly spicy or soggy. For cleaning tips after saucy meals, visit <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>our cleaner guide</a>.</p>  

<h3>Common Mistakes When Measuring Hot Sauce</h3>  
<p>Using a heaped tablespoon can add up to 20 grams, skewing your recipe. Always level off the sauce for accuracy. Also, avoid substituting hot sauce with dry spices without adjusting quantities, as their weights differ significantly.</p>

<p>1 tablespoon (tbsp) of caster sugar weighs approximately 12.5 grams in the UK. This measurement is essential for baking, especially when using an air fryer for desserts like cakes or cookies. Whether you're converting recipes or need precise sugar quantities, knowing this conversion ensures consistent results every time.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate sugar measurements matter</h2>  
<p>Getting the right amount of caster sugar is crucial for baking success. Too much can make desserts overly sweet or affect texture, while too little may leave them bland. When using an air fryer, precise measurements become even more important due to its rapid cooking method. For perfect air-fried cakes or cookies, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer dessert recipes</a>.</p>  

<p>Many UK recipes use grams for accuracy, while others rely on tablespoons. Knowing that 1 tbsp of caster sugar equals 12.5 grams helps bridge this gap. This is particularly useful when adapting traditional oven recipes for your air fryer, where ingredient ratios can make or break the result.</p>  

<h2>Converting caster sugar measurements</h2>  
<p>If a recipe calls for grams but you only have measuring spoons, this conversion is invaluable. For example, 50 grams of caster sugar would be roughly 4 tablespoons. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> includes these measurements for quick reference.</p>  

<h3>Measuring caster sugar correctly</h3>  
<p>To ensure accuracy, spoon caster sugar into the tablespoon and level it off with a knife. Don't scoop directly from the bag, as this compacts the sugar and leads to over-measuring. This technique is especially important for air fryer baking, where even small measurement errors can affect cooking times and results.</p>  

<h2>Caster sugar vs other sugars</h2>  
<p>Caster sugar's fine crystals make it ideal for baking, dissolving more easily than granulated sugar. Its weight per tablespoon differs slightly from other sugars – for instance, granulated sugar weighs about 15 grams per tablespoon. When adapting recipes for your air fryer, always use the correct sugar type for best results.</p>  

<p>If you're out of caster sugar, you can make your own by blitzing granulated sugar in a food processor. Just remember that homemade versions may vary slightly in density, so weighing is more reliable than volume measurements. For more baking tips, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>air fryer cake recipes</a>.</p>  

<h3>Air fryer baking with caster sugar</h3>  
<p>Air fryers excel at baking thanks to their circulating heat, but they require precise measurements. Since they cook faster than conventional ovens, the right sugar amount ensures proper browning and texture. Too much sugar can cause over-browning, while too little may result in dry baked goods.</p>  

<h2>Common measurement mistakes to avoid</h2>  
<p>One frequent error is confusing UK and US tablespoon measurements – they differ slightly. Always use UK measurements (15ml per tablespoon) when following British recipes. Another pitfall is using packed sugar, which can add up to 25% more sugar than intended. After baking, remember to <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>clean your air fryer</a> properly to remove any sugar residue.</p>  

<p>Digital scales provide the most accuracy, but if using tablespoons, always level them off. For recipes requiring multiple tablespoons, it's better to measure each one individually rather than trying to eyeball multiples in a larger spoon. This attention to detail makes all the difference in air fryer baking.</p>  

<h3>Storing caster sugar for freshness</h3>  
<p>Keep caster sugar in an airtight container to prevent clumping. Humidity can affect its texture and how it measures, potentially throwing off your recipes. For best results in air fryer baking, use fresh, free-flowing caster sugar and measure just before adding to your mixture.</p>

<p>3.5 cups of orange juice equals approximately 828 ml. Whether you’re whipping up a marinade, glaze, or a citrusy dessert in your air fryer, precise measurements ensure perfect results every time. Converting cups to millilitres might seem tricky, but with our simple guide, you’ll never second-guess your quantities again. For more air fryer-friendly conversions, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of liquid, like orange juice, can make or break your air fryer recipe. Too much, and your dish might turn soggy; too little, and it could dry out. Air fryers circulate hot air rapidly, so balancing moisture is key. Whether you’re making a tangy glaze for chicken or a moist cake, 3.5 cups of orange juice (828 ml) ensures consistency. Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipes</a> for inspiration on using orange juice in air fryer dishes.</p>  

<p>Many UK and US recipes use cups, but millilitres are often easier for precision. If you’re adapting a family favourite or trying a new dish, knowing that 3.5 cups of orange juice is 828 ml saves time and hassle. For more tips on perfecting air fryer meals, visit <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>.</p>  

<h2>How to Measure 3.5 Cups of Orange Juice Correctly</h2>  
<p>To measure 3.5 cups of orange juice accurately, use a liquid measuring cup with clear markings. Fill it to the 3-cup line first, then add another half cup. If you don’t have a measuring cup, a standard UK metric jug works too—just pour until you reach 828 ml. Avoid using dry measuring cups, as they won’t give you the exact liquid volume needed for recipes like our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>citrus-glazed chicken</a>.</p>  

<h3>Converting Other Cup Measurements to ml</h3>  
<p>If your recipe calls for a different amount of orange juice, here’s a quick reference: 1 cup = 237 ml, 2 cups = 473 ml, and 4 cups = 946 ml. This makes scaling recipes up or down a breeze. Need more conversions? Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> covers everything from grams to millilitres.</p>

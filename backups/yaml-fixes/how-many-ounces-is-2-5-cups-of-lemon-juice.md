<p>2.5 cups of lemon juice equals 20 fluid ounces (or approximately 20 oz). Whether you’re preparing a zesty marinade or a tangy dessert in your air fryer, knowing this conversion ensures your recipe turns out perfectly every time.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Precision is key when cooking with an air fryer, especially for recipes that rely on balanced flavours like lemon-based dishes. Too much or too little lemon juice can alter the taste and texture of your meal. For example, a marinade for air-fried chicken or a lemon drizzle cake requires exact measurements to achieve the best results. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we emphasise the importance of accurate conversions to help you cook with confidence.</p>  

<p>Lemon juice is often used in air fryer recipes for its acidity, which tenderises meats and adds brightness to desserts. Whether you’re making <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>lemon garlic shrimp</a> or a citrus-glazed salmon, knowing how to convert cups to ounces ensures consistency. This is particularly useful for UK cooks who may need to adjust measurements from American recipes.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure Lemon Juice Correctly</h3>  
<p>To measure 2.5 cups of lemon juice accurately, use a liquid measuring cup rather than dry measuring cups. Fill it to the 2.5-cup mark at eye level for precision. If you’re using freshly squeezed lemons, note that one medium lemon yields about 2-3 tablespoons of juice, so you’ll need roughly 16-20 lemons for 2.5 cups. For convenience, bottled lemon juice works just as well in most air fryer recipes.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for 2.5 Cups of Lemon Juice in Air Fryer Recipes</h2>  
<p>This quantity of lemon juice is perfect for batch cooking or meal prep. You might use it to marinate a whole chicken before air frying, create a citrus glaze for roasted vegetables, or whip up a large batch of lemon curd for desserts. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipes</a> for inspiration on how to incorporate lemon juice into your cooking.</p>  

<p>Another great use for 2.5 cups of lemon juice is in cleaning your air fryer. A mixture of lemon juice and water can help remove grease and odours, leaving your appliance fresh and ready for the next use.

<h3>Converting Other Lemon Juice Measurements</h3>  
<p>If you need to adjust the quantity, here’s a quick reference: 1 cup of lemon juice equals 8 fluid ounces, so 1.25 cups would be 10 oz, and 5 cups would be 40 oz. Keep our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a> handy for other common measurements used in air fryer cooking.</p>  

<h2>Tips for Storing Leftover Lemon Juice</h2>  
<p>If you have extra lemon juice after measuring out 2.5 cups, store it in an airtight container in the fridge for up to a week. Alternatively, freeze it in ice cube trays for future use. This way, you’ll always have lemon juice ready for your next air fryer adventure, whether it’s a quick <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert</a> or a savoury main.</p>

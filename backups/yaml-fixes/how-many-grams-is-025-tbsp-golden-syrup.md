<p>Golden syrup’s thick consistency means volume measurements like tablespoons can vary slightly. Weight measurements in grams eliminate this guesswork, making your cooking more reliable. If you’re adapting a traditional recipe for the air fryer, converting 0.25 tbsp of golden syrup to grams is a small but crucial step.

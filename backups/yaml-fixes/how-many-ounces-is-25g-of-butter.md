Try reducing the amount slightly (e.g., 20g) or brushing it on lightly instead of mixing it in. Also, ensure your air fryer is clean, as leftover grease can build up over time."

<p>25g of butter equals approximately 0.88 ounces. This conversion is essential for precise cooking, especially when using an air fryer where measurements can impact texture and flavour. Whether you're whipping up a batch of cookies or preparing a savoury dish, knowing how many ounces 25g of butter is ensures your recipes turn out perfectly every time.</p>

<h2>Why accurate butter measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>
<p>Air fryers rely on precise ingredient ratios to achieve the best results. Too much or too little butter can affect the crispiness, moisture, and overall taste of your dish. For example, if you're making air fryer cookies, 25g of butter (0.88 ounces) is often the perfect amount to balance richness without making them greasy. You can find more air fryer recipes at <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> to experiment with different measurements.</p>
<p>Butter is a common ingredient in many air fryer recipes, from cakes to roasted vegetables. Converting 25g of butter to ounces (0.88 oz) helps you follow recipes accurately, especially those from international sources. If you're unsure about other conversions, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> is a handy tool to keep nearby.</p>

<h2>How to measure 25g of butter without scales</h2>
<p>Not everyone has kitchen scales, but there are easy ways to measure 25g of butter (0.88 ounces) without them. Most butter packaging has markings indicating tablespoons or grams, making it simple to slice off the right amount. For 25g of butter, you’d need roughly 1.75 tablespoons, depending on the brand’s density.</p>
<p>If your butter comes in a block, a standard UK tablespoon holds about 14g of butter. So, 25g of butter is just under 2 tablespoons. This method isn’t as precise as using scales, but it works in a pinch. For more tips on measuring ingredients for your air fryer, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert recipes</a>, where precision is key.</p>

<h3>Converting 25g of butter to ounces for different recipes</h3>
<p>Whether you're making savoury or sweet dishes, knowing that 25g of butter is 0.88 ounces helps adapt recipes. For instance, if a US recipe calls for 1 ounce of butter, you’d need roughly 28g, which is slightly more than 25g. This small difference can matter in baking, so it’s worth double-checking.</p>

<h2>Common air fryer recipes using 25g of butter</h2>
<p>Many air fryer recipes use small amounts of butter, like 25g, to add flavour without excess grease. For example, garlic butter shrimp or buttered corn on the cob often call for this measurement. You can find inspiration for these dishes and more at <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>.</p>
<p>Another popular use for 25g of butter (0.88 ounces) is in air fryer cakes or muffins. The butter adds moisture and richness, but too much can make them heavy. If you're new to air frying, start with our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>cake recipes</a> to practice your measurements.</p>

<h3>Tips for storing and using butter in air fryer recipes</h3>
<p>Butter should be stored in the fridge but brought to room temperature before use in air fryer recipes. This ensures it mixes evenly with other ingredients. For 25g of butter, leaving it out for 10-15 minutes is usually enough. If you're in a hurry, cutting it into small pieces speeds up the process.</p>

<h2>Why UK measurements differ slightly</h2>
<p>In the UK, butter is often sold in 250g blocks, making it easy to measure 25g (one-tenth of the block). However, ounce measurements can vary slightly depending on the country. For example, 25g of butter is 0.88 ounces in the UK, but some US recipes might round it to 0.9 ounces. Always check the source of your recipe for clarity.</p>

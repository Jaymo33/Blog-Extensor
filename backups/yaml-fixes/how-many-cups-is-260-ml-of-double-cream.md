<p>260 ml of double cream is approximately 1.1 cups. This conversion is essential for baking and cooking, especially when using an air fryer where precise measurements matter. Whether you're whipping up a dessert or a savoury dish, knowing how to convert millilitres to cups ensures consistency in your recipes.</p>

<h2>Understanding the Conversion</h2>
<p>Converting millilitres to cups can be tricky, especially with ingredients like double cream, which has a thick consistency. The general rule is that 240 ml equals 1 cup, but double cream's density means 260 ml is slightly more. This small difference can impact recipes, so it's best to measure accurately. For more detailed conversions, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>

<p>When measuring double cream, it's helpful to use a liquid measuring cup for accuracy. If you don't have one, a standard metric measuring jug will do. Remember, air fryer recipes often require precise amounts to ensure even cooking, so getting this right is key. Visit <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> for more tips on perfecting your dishes.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter</h2>
<p>In baking, especially with air fryers, precise measurements are crucial. Too much or too little double cream can alter the texture and taste of your dish. For example, adding 260 ml of double cream instead of 1 cup could make a cake too dense. This is why understanding the conversion from millilitres to cups is so important.</p>

<p>Air fryers cook food quickly and evenly, but only if the ingredients are measured correctly. Whether you're making a creamy pasta sauce or a decadent dessert, knowing that 260 ml of double cream equals 1.1 cups ensures your dish turns out perfectly.

<h3>Using Double Cream in Air Fryer Recipes</h3>
<p>Double cream is a versatile ingredient in air fryer cooking. From rich sauces to fluffy desserts, it adds a luxurious touch. When a recipe calls for 260 ml of double cream, you now know it's roughly 1.1 cups. This measurement is handy for dishes like air-fried custards or creamy dips.</p>

<h3>Common Mistakes to Avoid</h3>

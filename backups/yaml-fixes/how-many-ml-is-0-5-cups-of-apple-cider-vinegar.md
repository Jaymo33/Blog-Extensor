<p>0.5 cups of apple cider vinegar equals approximately 118 ml. This conversion is essential for precise cooking, especially when using an air fryer, where accurate measurements can make or break a recipe. Whether you're marinating chicken, baking, or making dressings, knowing the exact ml equivalent ensures consistency.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on precise ingredient ratios to achieve the perfect texture and flavour. Too much or too little liquid, like apple cider vinegar, can affect cooking times and results. For example, a marinade with 0.5 cups of apple cider vinegar (118 ml) ensures even coating and tenderisation. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more handy measurements.</p>  

<p>Many air fryer recipes, such as crispy chicken wings or glazed vegetables, call for apple cider vinegar. Using the correct ml measurement guarantees the right balance of acidity and moisture. This is especially important for recipes like those in our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken category</a>, where marinades play a key role.</p>  

<h2>How to Measure 0.5 Cups of Apple Cider Vinegar</h2>  
<p>Measuring liquids like apple cider vinegar can be tricky if you don’t have the right tools. A liquid measuring cup with ml markings is ideal for accuracy. Pour the vinegar to the 118 ml line for 0.5 cups. If you only have a dry measuring cup, fill it to the brim and level it off.</p>  

<h3>Using a Kitchen Scale for Precision</h3>  
<p>For even greater accuracy, use a kitchen scale. Apple cider vinegar weighs roughly 236 grams per cup, so 0.5 cups would be 118 grams. This method eliminates guesswork and ensures your air fryer recipes turn out perfectly every time.</p>  

<h2>Common Recipes Using 0.5 Cups of Apple Cider Vinegar</h2>

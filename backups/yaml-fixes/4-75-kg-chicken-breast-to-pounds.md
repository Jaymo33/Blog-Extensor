Air fryers require space between food items for proper air circulation and even cooking. For this quantity, you'll need to cook in batches, typically ½-1 pound per batch depending on your air fryer's capacity. Between batches, allow the air fryer to reheat properly for consistent results, and use a meat thermometer to ensure each batch reaches a safe internal temperature of 75°C."

Cooked chicken should be cooled completely before transferring to airtight containers. Refrigerated chicken will stay fresh for 3-4 days, while frozen chicken can be stored for 2-3 months. For best results, divide the large quantity into meal-sized portions before storing, and always label containers with contents and dates to maintain organization and ensure you use them while still at peak quality."

<p>0.25 cup of margarine equals 2 ounces (oz). This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes, where precise measurements ensure perfect results. Whether you’re whipping up cakes, cookies, or savoury dishes, knowing how many ounces are in 0.25 cup of margarine helps you follow recipes accurately. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we focus on making conversions simple for hassle-free cooking. Keep reading for more tips on measuring margarine and using it in your air fryer.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of margarine ensures your air fryer dishes turn out perfectly crispy or moist, depending on the recipe. Too little margarine might leave your food dry, while too much can make it greasy. For example, if a recipe calls for 0.25 cup of margarine, you now know it’s 2 ounces. This precision is especially important for baking, where ratios are critical. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more handy measurements. Whether you’re making cookies or roasting vegetables, accurate conversions make cooking easier.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure Margarine for Air Fryer Recipes</h3>  
<p>Measuring margarine can be tricky since it’s often sold in sticks or tubs. If you’re using sticks, 0.25 cup is half a standard stick (4 tablespoons). For tub margarine, spoon it into a measuring cup and level it off. If you don’t have a measuring cup, a kitchen scale will give you the exact 2 ounces needed. For more recipe ideas, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> collection. Accurate measuring ensures your dishes are consistent every time.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for 0.25 Cup of Margarine in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Margarine is a versatile ingredient in air fryer recipes, from cakes to savoury dishes. For example, 0.25 cup (2 ounces) of margarine works perfectly in muffin or cookie batters. It’s also great for greasing the air fryer basket to prevent sticking. If you’re making roasted potatoes, a little margarine adds crispiness without excess oil. Visit our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert recipes</a> for sweet treats using this measurement. Margarine’s rich flavour enhances both sweet and savoury dishes.</p>  

<h3>Substitutes for Margarine in Air Fryer Recipes</h3>  
<p>If you’re out of margarine, butter is the closest substitute, with the same 0.25 cup to 2 ounces ratio. Coconut oil or vegetable oil can also work, but adjust quantities slightly. For healthier options, try applesauce in baking, though texture may vary. Always check our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning tips</a> to keep your air fryer in top condition after cooking with fats. Experimenting with substitutes can lead to delicious new recipes.</p>

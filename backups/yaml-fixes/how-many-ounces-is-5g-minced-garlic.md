<p>5g of minced garlic equals approximately 0.18 ounces. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements can make or break a dish. Whether you're following a recipe from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> or experimenting with your own creations, knowing this conversion ensures accuracy.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Garlic Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Garlic is a powerful ingredient that can easily overpower a dish if used incorrectly. In air fryer cooking, where flavours intensify due to the concentrated heat, getting the right amount of minced garlic is crucial. Too much can make your meal bitter, while too little might leave it bland. For dishes like garlic shrimp or roasted vegetables, 5g (0.18 ounces) is often the perfect balance.</p>  

<p>If you're preparing a recipe from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes</a>, you'll notice many list garlic in grams. This is because metric measurements are more precise, especially for small quantities. Converting 5g of minced garlic to ounces ensures you stay on track, whether you're cooking for one or meal prepping for the week.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure Minced Garlic Correctly</h3>  
<p>Measuring minced garlic can be tricky due to its sticky texture. For 5g (0.18 ounces), use a digital kitchen scale for the most accurate results. If you don't have one, a level teaspoon is roughly equivalent, though this can vary slightly depending on how finely the garlic is minced. Always pack it lightly to avoid over-measuring.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for 5g of Minced Garlic in Air Fryers</h2>  
<p>Many air fryer recipes call for 5g of minced garlic, especially in marinades or rubs. For example, <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>garlic butter chicken</a> often uses this amount to infuse flavour without overwhelming the dish. It's also perfect for garlic bread, roasted potatoes, or even homemade air fryer sauces.</p>  

<p>If you're working with frozen foods like garlic bread or pre-marinated meats, check the packaging to see if the garlic content aligns with your recipe. Sometimes, pre-prepared items already include garlic, so you might need to adjust your 5g (0.18 ounces) measurement accordingly.</p>  

<h3>Converting Other Garlic Measurements</h3>  
<p>If your recipe uses cloves instead of grams, one medium clove yields about 5g (0.18 ounces) when minced. For larger batches, refer to <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart</a> for quick conversions. This is especially helpful when scaling up recipes for family meals or gatherings.</p>  

<h2>Tips for Storing Minced Garlic</h2>  
<p>Freshly minced garlic is best used immediately, but if you have leftovers, store them in an airtight container in the fridge. 5g (0.18 ounces) portions can be frozen in ice cube trays for future use. This way, you'll always have the right amount ready for your next air fryer adventure.</p>

<p>0.33 cup of almond butter equals approximately 2.64 ounces (oz). This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes, where precise measurements ensure perfect texture and consistency. Whether you’re whipping up cookies, energy bars, or a savoury glaze, knowing how many ounces are in 0.33 cup of almond butter makes baking effortless.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate almond butter measurements matter</h2>  
<p>Almond butter is a staple in many air fryer recipes, from <a href="https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes">healthy snacks</a> to decadent desserts. Too much or too little can affect moisture, binding, and flavour. For example, if you’re making air fryer almond butter cookies, 0.33 cup (2.64 oz) ensures the dough holds together without becoming greasy. Check our <a href="https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart">conversion chart</a> for other common measurements.</p>  

<p>Nut butters like almond butter vary slightly in density, but 0.33 cup reliably translates to 2.64 oz in the UK. This consistency helps when scaling recipes up or down. If you’re meal prepping <a href="https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/breakfast">breakfast energy balls</a>, precise ounces prevent wasted ingredients.</p>  

<h3>How to measure 0.33 cup of almond butter</h3>  
<p>Use a dry measuring cup for sticky almond butter, scraping off the excess for accuracy. For smaller quantities, a kitchen scale set to ounces (2.64 oz) is foolproof. If your air fryer recipe calls for melted almond butter, measure it solid first for consistency.</p>  

<h2>Converting 0.33 cup almond butter in recipes</h2>  
<p>Many <a href="https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert">air fryer desserts</a>, like brownies or granola bars, list almond butter in cups. If you prefer weighing ingredients, 0.33 cup = 2.64 oz. This conversion also applies to nut-free alternatives, such as sunflower seed butter, in <a href="https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner">allergy-friendly recipes</a>.</p>  

<p>For savoury dishes, like almond-crusted chicken, 0.33 cup (2.64 oz) provides enough coating without overwhelming the dish. Always level off your measuring cup or use a scale for sticky ingredients to avoid discrepancies.</p>  

<h3>Common mistakes when measuring almond butter</h3>  
<p>Packing almond butter into a cup compresses it, leading to more than 2.64 oz. Instead, spoon it loosely into the cup. For oils that separate, stir well before measuring 0.33 cup to ensure even distribution of fats and solids.</p>

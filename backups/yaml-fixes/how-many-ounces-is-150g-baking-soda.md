<p>150g of baking soda equals approximately 5.29 ounces. Whether you're whipping up a batch of air fryer cookies or a savoury dish, getting the measurements right is key. Baking soda is a crucial ingredient in many recipes, and even a small miscalculation can affect the outcome. That’s why knowing how to convert grams to ounces is so handy, especially for UK cooks using air fryers.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Precision is everything when it comes to baking, and air fryer recipes are no exception. Too much or too little baking soda can alter the texture and rise of your baked goods.

Plus, it saves you from kitchen disasters and wasted ingredients.</p>  

<h2>How to Convert 150g of Baking Soda to Ounces</h2>  
<p>The conversion from grams to ounces is straightforward. One gram equals roughly 0.035 ounces, so multiplying 150g by this factor gives you 5.29 ounces.

<h3>Using a Kitchen Scale for Precision</h3>  
<p>For the most accurate results, a digital kitchen scale is your best friend. Simply set it to grams, measure out 150g of baking soda, and then switch to ounces to see the equivalent. This eliminates any guesswork and ensures your air fryer recipes turn out perfectly every time. It’s a small investment that pays off in flawless dishes.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for 150g of Baking Soda in Air Fryer Recipes</h2>

It’s also great for cleaning your air fryer, as shown in our guide at <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner</a>.</p>

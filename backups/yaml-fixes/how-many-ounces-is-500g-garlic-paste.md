<p>500g of garlic paste equals approximately 17.64 ounces. Whether you're using an air fryer or prepping ingredients for a recipe, knowing this conversion ensures accuracy in your cooking. Garlic paste is a staple in many dishes, from marinades to sauces, and getting the measurement right can make all the difference. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we understand the importance of precise measurements for perfect results every time.</p>  

<h2>Why Convert 500g of Garlic Paste to Ounces?</h2>  
<p>Many recipes, especially those from the UK or US, use ounces as a standard measurement. If you're following an air fryer recipe that lists garlic paste in ounces, converting 500g ensures you use the correct amount. This avoids over-seasoning or diluting flavours, which can happen if measurements are off. For example, a recipe like garlic butter shrimp from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>our recipe collection</a> might call for ounces, making this conversion handy.</p>  

<p>Garlic paste is denser than fresh garlic, so weight measurements like grams or ounces are more reliable than volume. Whether you're making a quick marinade or a slow-cooked dish, knowing 500g garlic paste to ounces helps maintain consistency. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for other common ingredient conversions.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure 500g of Garlic Paste Accurately</h3>  
<p>Using a digital kitchen scale is the easiest way to measure 500g of garlic paste. Simply place your container on the scale, tare it to zero, and scoop the paste until it reads 500g. If you don’t have a scale, 500g is roughly 17.64 ounces, which can be measured using a liquid measuring cup for approximate accuracy.

<h2>Common Uses for 500g of Garlic Paste</h2>  
<p>Garlic paste is incredibly versatile, especially in air fryer cooking. From marinades for chicken or lamb to flavourful bases for soups and stews, 500g can go a long way. If you're meal prepping, dividing 500g into smaller portions (like 50g or 100g) makes it easy to grab and use throughout the week. For inspiration, try our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> that feature garlic paste as a key ingredient.</p>  

<p>Another great use for 500g of garlic paste is making homemade sauces or dressings. Mix it with olive oil, lemon juice, and herbs for a quick drizzle over roasted vegetables or air-fried tofu. Storing garlic paste properly ensures it stays fresh—keep it in an airtight container in the fridge for up to two weeks.

<h3>Does Garlic Paste Weight Vary by Brand?</h3>  
<p>While 500g of garlic paste should always equal 17.64 ounces, some brands may have slight variations due to added oils or preservatives. Always check the label if precision is crucial for your recipe. Homemade garlic paste may also differ slightly in density, so weighing it ensures consistency.

<p>1.5 tablespoons (tbsp) of honey equals approximately 31.5 grams (g). This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements can make or break your dish. Whether you’re drizzling honey over roasted vegetables or using it in a marinade, knowing the exact weight ensures consistency. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we understand the importance of accurate conversions for perfect results every time.</p>  

<h2>Why Measuring Honey Accurately Matters</h2>  
<p>Honey’s thickness and stickiness make it tricky to measure by volume alone. Using grams instead of tablespoons eliminates guesswork, especially in air fryer cooking where even small imbalances can affect texture and caramelisation. For example, adding too much honey to a glaze can cause burning, while too little might leave your dish lacking sweetness. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> simplifies these calculations for hassle-free cooking.</p>  

<p>Many UK recipes list honey in grams, so converting 1.5 tbsp to grams ensures you follow instructions correctly. This is particularly useful for baking, where precision is key. If you’re preparing a honey-glazed salmon or sweetening air-fried desserts, 31.5 grams of honey delivers the perfect balance. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a> for inspiration on using honey in your air fryer.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure Honey Without a Scale</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a kitchen scale, use the spoon-and-level method for accuracy. Fill your tablespoon halfway, then add another full tablespoon to reach 1.5 tbsp. Honey’s density means it won’t settle like flour, but avoiding air gaps ensures consistency. For sticky ingredients like honey, lightly greasing the spoon helps it slide off easily.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for 1.5 Tbsp of Honey in Air Fryers</h2>  
<p>This measurement is ideal for glazes, marinades, and dressings. A mix of honey, soy sauce, and garlic makes a fantastic glaze for air-fried chicken wings. Drizzling 31.5 grams of honey over roasted carrots or sweet potatoes enhances their natural sweetness without overpowering them. Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipes</a> for more honey-infused ideas.</p>  

<p>Honey also works wonders in air-fried desserts. A 1.5 tbsp portion sweetens banana chips or apple slices beautifully. Mix it with cinnamon for a quick, healthy treat. Remember, keeping your air fryer clean after using sticky ingredients like honey is crucial—our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning guide</a> has handy tips.</p>  

<h3>Adjusting Recipes for Different Honey Types</h3>  
<p>Runny honey and set honey weigh slightly differently due to moisture content. For 1.5 tbsp of thicker honey, you might need to press it into the spoon for an accurate gram measurement. When substituting syrups like maple or agave, note that their weights differ—always check conversions to avoid recipe mishaps.</p>

<p>75 grams of granulated sugar equals approximately 0.375 cups in the US or 0.3 cups in the UK. This conversion is essential for baking, especially when using an air fryer where precise measurements matter. Whether you're whipping up cakes, cookies, or desserts, knowing how to convert grams to cups ensures your recipes turn out perfectly every time.</p>

<h2>Understanding Granulated Sugar Measurements</h2>
<p>Granulated sugar is a staple in baking, and measuring it accurately is crucial for recipe success. In the UK, 75 grams of granulated sugar is roughly 0.3 cups, while in the US, it’s about 0.375 cups. This difference arises because UK and US cup measurements vary slightly. For air fryer recipes, precision is key, so using a kitchen scale is ideal. However, if you don’t have one, this conversion will help you get close.</p>
<p>When converting 75 grams of granulated sugar to cups, consider the density and packing of the sugar. Lightly packed sugar will take up more volume than tightly packed sugar. For consistent results, spoon the sugar into the measuring cup and level it off with a knife. This method ensures you’re not over or under-measuring, which can affect your air fryer baking outcomes.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Sugar Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Baking</h2>
<p>Air fryers cook food quickly and evenly, but they require precise ingredient measurements to avoid mishaps. Too much sugar can cause burning or uneven cooking, while too little can result in bland or dry treats. Converting 75 grams of granulated sugar to cups correctly ensures your air fryer cakes, cookies, or desserts have the right sweetness and texture.</p>
<p>For example, if you’re making air fryer cookies, 75 grams of granulated sugar (or 0.375 US cups) will give you the perfect balance of crispiness and chewiness. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> for more inspiration. Accurate measurements also help when scaling recipes up or down, ensuring consistent results every time.</p>

<h3>UK vs. US Cup Measurements for Granulated Sugar</h3>
<p>In the UK, a standard cup holds 250ml, while in the US, it’s 240ml. This small difference means 75 grams of granulated sugar converts to 0.3 UK cups or 0.375 US cups. If you’re following a recipe from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, it’s best to use UK measurements unless specified otherwise. Always double-check the recipe’s origin to avoid confusion.</p>

<h2>Tips for Measuring Granulated Sugar Without a Scale</h2>
<p>If you don’t have a kitchen scale, use the spoon-and-level method to measure 75 grams of granulated sugar. Gently spoon the sugar into a measuring cup until it’s slightly heaped, then level it off with a straight edge. Avoid tapping or packing the sugar down, as this can lead to over-measuring. For best results, refer to our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for other common ingredient conversions.</p>
<p>Another handy tip is to use common household items for rough estimates. For instance, 75 grams of granulated sugar is roughly equivalent to 6 UK tablespoons or 5 US tablespoons. While not as precise as a scale, this can work in a pinch. Remember, accuracy is key for air fryer baking, so investing in a scale is worthwhile.</p>

<h3>Common Recipes Using 75 Grams of Granulated Sugar</h3>
<p>Many air fryer recipes call for 75 grams of granulated sugar, such as sponge cakes, shortbread, or meringues. This amount provides the right sweetness without overpowering other flavours. For a delicious air fryer dessert, try our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>air fryer cake recipes</a>, where precise sugar measurements are essential for light, fluffy results.</p>

<h2>Converting Other Sugar Types</h2>
<p>While this guide focuses on granulated sugar, other types like caster or brown sugar have different densities. For example, 75 grams of caster sugar may measure slightly differently due to its finer texture. Always check specific conversion charts for different sugar types. For more baking tips, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaning guide</a> to keep your appliance in top condition.</p>
<p>When substituting sugars, remember that brown sugar contains molasses, which adds moisture. This can affect the texture of your air fryer bakes. If a recipe calls for 75 grams of granulated sugar, you can use brown sugar, but expect a slightly chewier result. Experiment to find your preferred balance.</p>

<p>0.375 cup of frozen peas equals approximately 3 ounces. This measurement is key for air fryer recipes where precision ensures even cooking. Whether you're prepping a quick side dish or adding peas to a larger meal, knowing this conversion helps avoid guesswork. For more handy conversions, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on hot air circulation, so ingredient quantities affect cooking times and results. Too many peas can lead to uneven crisping, while too few might dry out. Frozen peas, in particular, release moisture as they cook, so measuring correctly ensures perfect texture. If you're new to air frying, browse our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> for inspiration.</p>  

<p>For 0.375 cup of frozen peas, 3 ounces is the standard conversion, but weighing them removes any doubt. A kitchen scale is a great tool for air fryer enthusiasts who want consistent results. Peas are a versatile ingredient, working well in everything from stir-fries to <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable-based dishes</a>.</p>  

<h3>How to measure 0.375 cup of frozen peas</h3>  
<p>Use a dry measuring cup for frozen peas, filling it loosely without packing them down. Level off the top with a straight edge for accuracy. If you don’t have a 0.375 cup measure, 6 tablespoons (or half of a 0.75 cup) will give you the same amount. For more tips, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning and maintenance guides</a> to keep your appliance in top shape.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for 0.375 cup of frozen peas</h2>  
<p>This portion is ideal for single servings or small-batch cooking. Try air-frying peas with a dash of olive oil and sea salt for a crispy snack. They also pair well with other <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/frozen-foods>frozen foods</a> like fish or chicken for a balanced meal. Since peas cook quickly, they’re perfect for last-minute additions.</p>  

<p>Another great option is adding them to air-fried rice or quinoa bowls. The 3-ounce portion ensures they heat through without overcooking. For more creative ideas, visit <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, where we share tested recipes and techniques.</p>  

<h3>Adjusting cook times for frozen peas</h3>  
<p>Since frozen peas retain moisture, they may need slightly longer in the air fryer than fresh ones. At 180°C, 3 ounces of frozen peas take about 5–7 minutes. Shake the basket halfway through for even cooking. Always check for doneness, as air fryer models vary.</p>

<p>335 ml of milk is roughly equivalent to 1.42 cups in standard US measurements. This conversion is handy for recipes, especially when using an air fryer, where precise measurements can make all the difference. Whether you're whipping up a cake or a creamy sauce, knowing how to convert millilitres to cups ensures your dish turns out perfectly every time.</p>  

<h2>Understanding the Conversion from Millilitres to Cups</h2>  
<p>Converting millilitres to cups can be tricky, especially since cup sizes vary between the UK and the US. In the US, 1 cup equals 240 ml, while in the UK, it's 250 ml. For 335 ml of milk, this means approximately 1.42 US cups or 1.34 UK cups. This slight difference might not matter for some recipes, but for baking, precision is key.</p>  
<p>If you're using an air fryer for recipes like muffins or custards, accurate measurements ensure even cooking. A <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>handy conversion chart</a> can help you switch between metric and imperial measurements effortlessly. Always double-check your recipe's origin to avoid confusion between US and UK cup sizes.</p>  

<h3>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h3>  
<p>Air fryers cook food quickly and evenly, but inconsistent measurements can lead to undercooked or dry results. For example, adding too much milk to a batter might make it too runny, while too little can dry it out. Measuring 335 ml of milk correctly ensures your air-fried dishes, like pancakes or quiches, turn out just right.</p>

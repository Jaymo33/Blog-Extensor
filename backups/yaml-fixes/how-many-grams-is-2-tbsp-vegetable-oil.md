<p>2 tablespoons (tbsp) of vegetable oil weigh approximately 28 grams in the UK. This conversion is essential for precise cooking, especially when using an air fryer where measurements can impact texture and crispiness. Whether you're following a recipe from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> or experimenting with your own dishes, knowing the exact weight ensures consistency.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air frying</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on even heat distribution, and using the right amount of oil is crucial. Too much oil can make food greasy, while too little may leave it dry. For example, recipes like crispy potatoes or air-fried chicken often call for 2 tbsp of vegetable oil to achieve the perfect balance. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for other common ingredient conversions.</p>  

<p>Many UK cooks prefer weighing ingredients for accuracy, as tablespoon measurements can vary slightly. If you're adapting a recipe from volume to weight, 28 grams is the standard for 2 tbsp of vegetable oil. This is particularly helpful for baking or making sauces where precision is key.</p>  

<h3>How to measure 2 tbsp of vegetable oil correctly</h3>  
<p>Use a standard UK tablespoon (15ml) and level it off for an exact measurement. For best results, pour the oil slowly into the spoon to avoid spills. If you're using a kitchen scale, tare it to zero before adding the oil to get an accurate 28-gram reading.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for 2 tbsp of vegetable oil in air fryers</h2>  
<p>From roasting vegetables to frying tofu, 2 tbsp of vegetable oil is a versatile quantity. It’s enough to coat ingredients lightly without overpowering them. For inspiration, browse our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable air fryer recipes</a>, where this measurement is frequently used.</p>  

<p>Some popular dishes include air-fried sweet potatoes, crispy Brussels sprouts, or even homemade onion rings. The 28-gram measurement ensures even cooking and a satisfying crunch. Remember, air fryers require less oil than traditional frying, so sticking to 2 tbsp is often ideal.</p>  

<h3>Converting other oil quantities to grams</h3>  
<p>If your recipe calls for more or less oil, here’s a quick reference: 1 tbsp equals 14 grams, while 3 tbsp weigh around 42 grams. For larger batches, 4 tbsp (56 grams) or 5 tbsp (70 grams) may be needed. Always adjust based on your air fryer’s capacity and the dish you’re preparing.</p>  

<h2>Tips for reducing oil in air fryer recipes</h2>  
<p>While 2 tbsp of vegetable oil (28 grams) works well for many dishes, you can often use less. Try spraying oil lightly instead of pouring it, or opt for oil-free recipes for healthier alternatives. Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a> for low-oil ideas that don’t sacrifice flavour.</p>  

<p>Cleaning your air fryer after using oil is also important. Residue can build up and affect performance. For tips on maintaining your appliance, visit our guide on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaning</a>.</p>

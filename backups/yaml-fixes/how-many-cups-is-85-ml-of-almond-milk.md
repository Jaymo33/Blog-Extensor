<p>85 ml of almond milk equals approximately 0.36 cups in the UK or 0.35 cups in the US. This conversion is handy for air fryer recipes, baking, or meal prep where precise measurements matter. Whether you're whipping up a cake or a creamy sauce, knowing how to convert ml to cups ensures your dish turns out perfectly every time.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of almond milk can make or break a recipe. Too little, and your dish might turn out dry; too much, and it could become soggy. Air fryer recipes, like those on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, often rely on precise liquid measurements for even cooking. Almond milk, being a popular dairy-free alternative, is commonly used in everything from pancakes to creamy pasta sauces.</p>  

<p>If you're working with a recipe that lists almond milk in ml but prefer using cups, this conversion is essential. For example, 85 ml of almond milk is just over a third of a cup, which is useful for scaling recipes up or down. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more handy measurement swaps.</p>  

<h3>UK vs. US Cup Measurements</h3>  
<p>It's worth noting that UK and US cup measurements differ slightly. In the UK, 1 cup equals 284 ml, while in the US, it's 240 ml. This means 85 ml of almond milk converts to 0.36 cups in the UK and 0.35 cups in the US. For most recipes, this small difference won’t affect the outcome, but for baking, precision is key.</p>  

<h2>How to Measure 85 ml of Almond Milk Without a Scale</h2>  
<p>If you don’t have a measuring jug with ml markings, you can still measure 85 ml of almond milk accurately. A standard UK tablespoon holds 15 ml, so 5 and 2/3 tablespoons will give you roughly 85 ml. Alternatively, use a US tablespoon (14.79 ml), which requires about 5.75 tablespoons to reach 85 ml.</p>  

<p>For those who prefer visual cues, 85 ml of almond milk fills just over a third of a standard 250 ml mug. This method is handy for quick measurements when you're mid-recipe. If you're prepping ingredients for an air fryer dish, like those in our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipes section</a>, these approximations can save time.</p>  

<h3>Using 85 ml of Almond Milk in Air Fryer Recipes</h3>  
<p>Almond milk is a versatile ingredient in air fryer cooking. From moistening cake batters to creating light coatings for crispy tofu, 85 ml (or roughly 0.35 cups) is a common measurement. For example, a small batch of air-fryer pancakes might call for this amount to achieve the perfect consistency.</p>  

<h2>Common Recipes Using 85 ml of Almond Milk</h2>  
<p>Many air fryer recipes use 85 ml of almond milk as a key component. Think creamy sauces for pasta, light batters for fish or chicken, or even dairy-free custards. If you're exploring plant-based cooking, almond milk is a staple, and knowing its cup equivalent helps streamline the process.</p>  

<p>For inspiration, browse our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert category</a>, where almond milk often features in puddings and cakes. Whether you're making a single-serving mug cake or a batch of dairy-free cookies, 85 ml of almond milk can be the difference between success and a kitchen mishap.</p>  

<h3>Storing Leftover Almond Milk</h3>  
<p>If your recipe only uses part of a carton, store leftover almond milk in the fridge for up to 5 days. Shake well before reusing, as separation is natural. For longer storage, freeze it in ice cube trays—each cube is roughly 30 ml, so three cubes will get you close to 85 ml when needed.</p>

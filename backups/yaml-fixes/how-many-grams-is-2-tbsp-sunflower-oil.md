<p>2 tablespoons (tbsp) of sunflower oil weigh approximately 28 grams. This conversion is essential for precise cooking, especially when using an air fryer where measurements can impact texture and crispiness. Whether you’re following a recipe from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> or experimenting with your own creations, knowing the exact weight ensures consistent results.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate oil measurements matter in air frying</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on hot air circulation to cook food, and using the right amount of oil is crucial. Too little oil can leave food dry, while too much can make it greasy. For example, 2 tbsp of sunflower oil (28g) is often enough to coat vegetables or chicken evenly without overdoing it. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for other common measurements.</p>  

<p>Sunflower oil is a popular choice for air frying due to its high smoke point and neutral flavour. Whether you’re making crispy potatoes or golden chicken wings, 2 tbsp (28g) provides just the right amount of fat for that perfect crunch. For more recipe ideas, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipes section</a>.</p>  

<h3>How to measure sunflower oil accurately</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a kitchen scale, use a standard UK tablespoon to measure 2 tbsp of sunflower oil. One level tablespoon holds about 14g, so two will give you 28g. For sticky or dense ingredients, always opt for weight measurements for better precision.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for 2 tbsp of sunflower oil in air fryers</h2>  
<p>From roasting vegetables to frying tofu, 2 tbsp (28g) of sunflower oil is a versatile quantity. It’s enough to lightly coat a batch of air-fried mushrooms or a tray of mixed seafood. For inspiration, browse our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable recipes</a> or <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/mixed-seafood>seafood dishes</a>.</p>  

<p>When reheating frozen foods like chips or nuggets, 2 tbsp of sunflower oil can revive their crispiness without excess grease. Just toss them in the oil before air frying for best results. Always clean your air fryer basket afterward with our recommended <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning tips</a>.</p>  

<h3>Converting other oil measurements to grams</h3>  
<p>If a recipe calls for a different amount of sunflower oil, remember that 1 tbsp equals roughly 14g. This makes scaling recipes up or down simple, whether you’re cooking for one or a family.</p>

<p>1.25 cups of lime juice equals 10 fluid ounces (or approximately 10 oz by weight for most practical purposes). Whether you're preparing a zesty marinade for chicken or a tangy dressing for salads, knowing this conversion ensures your air fryer recipes turn out perfectly every time. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we understand how precise measurements can make or break a dish, especially when working with citrus flavours.</p>

<h2>Why accurate lime juice measurements matter</h2>
<p>Using the right amount of lime juice is crucial for balancing flavours in your air fryer recipes. Too little, and your dish might lack that bright, tangy kick. Too much, and it could become overpoweringly sour. For example, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer lime chicken recipe</a> calls for precise lime juice measurements to achieve the perfect balance. The 1.25 cups to ounces conversion becomes particularly important when scaling recipes up or down.</p>
<p>Lime juice also plays a key role in tenderising meats and adding freshness to vegetables. When you're preparing dishes from our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipe category</a>, accurate lime juice measurements ensure consistent results. Whether you're making fajitas, skewers, or wings, 10 ounces of lime juice (from 1.25 cups) will give you reliable flavour every time.</p>

<h3>Understanding liquid vs weight measurements</h3>
<p>While 1.25 cups of lime juice equals 10 fluid ounces, the weight in ounces can vary slightly depending on factors like temperature and pulp content. For most cooking purposes, especially in air fryer recipes, the difference is negligible. However, if you're following a precise baking recipe from our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert section</a>, it's worth noting that 10 fluid ounces of lime juice weighs about 10.5 ounces on a kitchen scale.</p>

<h2>How to measure lime juice accurately</h2>
<p>The easiest way to measure 1.25 cups of lime juice is to use a liquid measuring cup with clear markings. Fill to the 1 cup line, then add another quarter cup. For smaller quantities, you might prefer using a kitchen scale - 10 ounces is about 283 grams. Many of our readers find our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> helpful for these kitchen calculations.</p>
<p>When working with fresh limes, remember that one medium lime typically yields about 2 tablespoons (1 fluid ounce) of juice. So for 10 ounces (1.25 cups), you'd need about 10 medium limes. If you're using bottled lime juice, check the label as concentrations can vary. Our tip? Always taste and adjust - air fryer cooking often benefits from that personal touch!</p>

<h3>Converting other citrus juice measurements</h3>
<p>The same 1.25 cups to 10 ounces conversion applies to other citrus juices like lemon or orange. This consistency makes it easier when substituting ingredients in air fryer recipes. For example, if a recipe calls for 1.25 cups of lemon juice but you only have limes, you can confidently use the same 10 ounce measurement.</p>

<h2>Using lime juice in air fryer cooking</h2>
<p>Lime juice works wonders in air fryer recipes, from marinades to finishing touches. That 1.25 cups (10 ounces) measurement might be used in a large batch of <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/shrimp>shrimp recipes</a>, where the acid helps tenderise the seafood while adding bright flavour. After cooking, a quick spritz of lime juice can refresh leftovers when reheating in the air fryer.</p>
<p>Remember to clean your air fryer basket promptly after cooking with lime juice, as the acidity can affect some surfaces over time. Our guide on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaning</a> has great tips for maintaining your appliance when working with citrus ingredients. Proper care ensures your air fryer stays in top condition for all your lime-infused creations.</p>

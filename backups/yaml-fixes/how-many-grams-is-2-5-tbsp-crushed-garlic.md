<p>2.5 tbsp of crushed garlic equals approximately 35 grams. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precision ensures even cooking and perfect flavour distribution. Whether you’re making garlic bread, marinades, or roasted vegetables, knowing the exact weight helps avoid over or under-seasoning. For more air fryer measurement tips, visit <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>our conversion chart</a>.</p>

<h2>Why accurate garlic measurements matter in air frying</h2>  
<p>Garlic is a powerhouse of flavour, but too much or too little can drastically alter your dish. In an air fryer, ingredients cook quickly, so balanced seasoning is key. Using 2.5 tbsp of crushed garlic (35g) ensures your recipes like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>garlic chicken</a> or roasted potatoes turn out perfectly. Overdoing it can lead to bitterness, while too little might leave your meal bland. Our guide helps you nail the measurement every time.</p>  

<p>Precision is especially important for batch cooking or meal prep. If you’re scaling up a recipe, converting tablespoons to grams guarantees consistency. For example, doubling a recipe would mean 70g of crushed garlic instead of guessing with tablespoons. Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a> for dishes where garlic plays a starring role.</p>  

<h3>How to measure crushed garlic accurately</h3>  
<p>Crushed garlic can be tricky to measure because it clumps together. For the most accurate 2.5 tbsp (35g), lightly pack the garlic into the spoon without pressing too hard. If using pre-minced garlic from a jar, drain excess liquid first. Freshly crushed garlic tends to be denser, so adjust slightly if needed. Keep your air fryer basket clean after cooking garlic-heavy dishes with <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>our cleaning guide</a>.</p>  

<h2>Common recipes using 2.5 tbsp of crushed garlic</h2>  
<p>Many air fryer favourites call for roughly 2.5 tbsp (35g) of crushed garlic. Garlic butter shrimp, roasted mushrooms, and even garlic-infused oils benefit from this measurement. For a quick <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>garlic vegetable medley</a>, toss your veggies with 35g of crushed garlic before air frying. The high heat of the air fryer caramelises the garlic, adding depth without burning.</p>  

<p>If you’re experimenting with homemade sauces or marinades, 2.5 tbsp of crushed garlic provides a robust base. Combine it with olive oil, herbs, and a pinch of salt for a versatile air fryer glaze. Remember, fresh garlic has a stronger flavour than jarred, so adjust to taste. For more inspiration, browse our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/mixed-seafood>seafood recipes</a> where garlic shines.</p>  

<h3>Converting other garlic measurements</h3>  
<p>If your recipe uses whole cloves instead of crushed garlic, one medium clove equals about 1 tsp (5g) when crushed. This means 2.5 tbsp (35g) is roughly 7 cloves. Minced garlic is slightly lighter, so 2.5 tbsp would be closer to 30g. Always check whether your recipe specifies fresh or pre-prepared garlic for the best results.</p>

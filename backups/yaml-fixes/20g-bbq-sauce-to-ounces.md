Brush it evenly over your food using a silicone brush to prevent sticking. This prevents burning while ensuring perfect caramelisation. For even coverage, toss smaller items like wings in the sauce before returning to the air fryer."

<p>20g of BBQ sauce equals approximately 0.71 ounces. This conversion is essential for air fryer cooking, where precise measurements can make all the difference to your dish. Whether you're marinating chicken wings or basting ribs, knowing exactly how much sauce to use ensures perfect results every time.</p>

<h2>Why accurate BBQ sauce measurements matter</h2>
<p>When using your air fryer, the right amount of BBQ sauce creates the perfect balance of flavour without making food soggy. Too much sauce can lead to uneven cooking, while too little might leave your dish tasting bland. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we know that precision matters, especially with sticky ingredients like BBQ sauce that can affect cooking times and textures.</p>

<p>Converting 20g of BBQ sauce to ounces (0.71 oz) helps when following recipes from different sources. Many UK recipes use grams, while some international ones prefer ounces. Having this conversion at your fingertips means you'll never need to guess measurements again. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more handy measurement swaps.</p>

<h3>How to measure 20g of BBQ sauce accurately</h3>
<p>The easiest way to measure 20g of BBQ sauce is using digital kitchen scales. Simply place your bowl or spoon on the scale, tare it to zero, then add sauce until you reach 20g. If you don't have scales, roughly 1Â½ tablespoons equals 20g, but this can vary slightly depending on the sauce's thickness.</p>

<h2>Using 20g of BBQ sauce in air fryer recipes</h2>
<p>20g of BBQ sauce (0.71 ounces) is the perfect amount for coating 2-3 chicken wings or a single pork chop in your air fryer. This quantity gives enough flavour without overwhelming the dish or causing excess dripping. For larger portions, simply scale up the measurement while maintaining the same ratio.</p>

<p>At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes</a>, you'll find dozens of dishes where this 20g to ounces conversion comes in handy. From sticky BBQ chicken thighs to glazed meatballs, precise sauce measurements help achieve restaurant-quality results at home. Remember to apply sauces towards the end of cooking to prevent burning.</p>

<h3>BBQ sauce thickness and measurement variations</h3>
<p>Different BBQ sauce brands vary in thickness, which can slightly affect the 20g to ounces conversion. Thicker sauces may measure slightly less in volume for the same weight, while runnier ones might appear more generous. When precision matters most, always weigh rather than use volume measurements.</p>

<h2>Converting other common BBQ sauce amounts</h2>
<p>Once you've mastered converting 20g of BBQ sauce to ounces (0.71 oz), you might need other common conversions. For example, 50g equals about 1.76 ounces, while 100g converts to approximately 3.53 ounces. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipe category</a> features several dishes where these conversions prove useful.</p>

<p>When preparing larger batches in your air fryer, like a family pack of drumsticks, you might need to convert 200g of BBQ sauce to ounces (7.05 oz). Keeping these conversions in mind helps maintain recipe consistency whether you're cooking for one or feeding a crowd. Don't forget to check our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner guide</a> for tips on removing sticky BBQ sauce residue afterwards.</p>

<h3>Storing leftover BBQ sauce properly</h3>
<p>After measuring out your 20g (0.71 oz) portion, store any remaining BBQ sauce in an airtight container in the fridge. Most quality sauces last 1-2 months when refrigerated properly. Always use clean utensils when scooping sauce to prevent contamination and extend shelf life.</p>

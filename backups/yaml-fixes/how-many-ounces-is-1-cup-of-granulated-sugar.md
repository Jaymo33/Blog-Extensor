<p>1 cup of granulated sugar equals approximately 7.05 ounces (200 grams) in UK measurements. This conversion is essential for baking precision, especially when using air fryers where ingredient ratios matter.</p>

<h2>Why accurate sugar measurements matter</h2>
<p>Getting your sugar measurements right is crucial for baking success. Too much sugar can make desserts overly sweet or cause uneven cooking in air fryers. Too little can affect texture and browning. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we always recommend weighing ingredients for consistent results.</p>

<p>Many air fryer recipes, especially cakes and cookies from our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>cake collection</a>, rely on precise sugar measurements. The 1 cup to 7.05 ounce conversion applies to standard UK measuring cups. American cups differ slightly, so always check your equipment.</p>

<h3>Converting between cups and ounces</h3>
<p>When converting 1 cup of granulated sugar to ounces, remember that UK and US measurements vary. Our conversion chart at <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart</a> covers all common ingredients. For granulated sugar specifically, 1 UK cup equals 7.05 ounces or 200 grams.</p>

<h2>Measuring sugar for air fryer recipes</h2>
<p>Air fryers cook differently than conventional ovens, making accurate measurements even more important. The concentrated heat means sugar ratios affect browning and texture significantly. Whether making <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cookies>cookies</a> or cakes, the 1 cup to 7.05 ounce conversion ensures perfect results.</p>

<p>If you don't have scales, fluff the sugar before spooning it into your measuring cup. Never pack it down, as this can add up to 25% more sugar. Level off the top with a straight edge for the most accurate 7.05 ounce measurement per cup.</p>

<h3>Common sugar measurement mistakes</h3>
<p>Many bakers accidentally use heaped cups rather than level measurements, throwing off the 1 cup to 7.05 ounce ratio. Another mistake is using American cups (240ml) instead of UK cups (250ml). Always check your equipment and consider investing in digital scales for precision.</p>

<h2>Alternative measurement methods</h2>
<p>If you don't have measuring cups, you can use household items to estimate 1 cup (7.05 ounces) of granulated sugar. A standard UK mug holds about 1.5 cups, while a teacup is roughly 3/4 cup. For more precise conversions, bookmark our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe section</a> with tested measurements.</p>

<p>When adjusting air fryer recipes, remember that 1 cup of granulated sugar equals 7.05 ounces. This conversion works for all types of white granulated sugar, including caster and superfine varieties. Brown sugars have different weights due to moisture content.</p>

<h3>Storing measured sugar</h3>
<p>After measuring out 1 cup (7.05 ounces) of granulated sugar for your air fryer recipe, store any excess in an airtight container. Sugar absorbs moisture, which can affect future measurements. Keep it in a cool, dry place away from strong odours.</p>

<p>For more baking tips and precise conversions, explore our complete guide at <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>. Whether you're making air fryer desserts or main dishes, accurate measurements make all the difference.</p>

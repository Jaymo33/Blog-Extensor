<p>0.75 cup of chickpeas equals approximately 6 ounces (170 grams). This measurement is key for air fryer recipes, ensuring your dishes have the right texture and cook evenly. Whether you're roasting chickpeas for a crunchy snack or adding them to a hearty meal, precise measurements matter. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we focus on accuracy to help you nail every recipe.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate chickpea measurements matter</h2>  
<p>Using the correct amount of chickpeas ensures your air fryer dishes cook evenly and taste perfect. Too many chickpeas can overcrowd the basket, leading to uneven cooking, while too few might dry out. For recipes like crispy roasted chickpeas or falafel, 0.75 cup (6 ounces) is a common portion. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more handy measurement tips.</p>  

<p>Chickpeas are versatile, working well in everything from salads to curries. When prepping for the air fryer, weighing them ensures consistency. If you’re meal prepping, knowing that 0.75 cup of chickpeas equals 6 ounces helps with portion control. Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a> for inspiration on using chickpeas in your air fryer.</p>  

<h3>How to measure 0.75 cup of chickpeas</h3>  
<p>For the most accurate results, use a kitchen scale to weigh 6 ounces of chickpeas. If you don’t have one, lightly fill a measuring cup without packing them down. Drained, canned chickpeas work well, but dried chickpeas need soaking first. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/beans>bean recipes</a> include tips for both types.</p>  

<h2>Converting chickpeas for air fryer recipes</h2>  
<p>Many air fryer recipes call for specific weights, so knowing 0.75 cup of chickpeas is 6 ounces simplifies adjustments. Whether you’re scaling up or down, this conversion keeps things easy. For crispy chickpeas, toss them in oil and seasonings before air frying at 190°C for 12-15 minutes.

<p>1.5 cups of soy sauce equals 355 ml, making it easy to measure for your air fryer recipes. Whether you're marinating chicken or whipping up a stir-fry, precise measurements ensure perfect results every time. This conversion is especially handy when following international recipes or adjusting portion sizes. For more air fryer tips, visit <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Soy Sauce Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of soy sauce can make or break your dish. Too little, and your meal might lack depth; too much, and it becomes overpoweringly salty. In air fryer cooking, where flavours concentrate, precision is key. A 1.5 cups to ml conversion ensures consistency, whether you're making glazes or marinades. Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> for inspiration.</p>  

<p>Many air fryer enthusiasts use soy sauce for its umami-rich flavour. From crispy tofu to sticky chicken wings, it’s a staple in Asian-inspired dishes. Knowing that 1.5 cups equals 355 ml helps streamline your prep work. For more measurement guides, check our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a>.</p>  

<h3>US vs. UK Cup Measurements</h3>  
<p>While 1.5 cups of soy sauce is universally 355 ml, cup sizes can vary slightly by region. US cups are 240 ml each, whereas UK cups are 284 ml. For soy sauce, this difference is negligible, but it’s worth noting for dry ingredients. Always use a liquid measuring jug for accuracy in air fryer recipes.</p>  

<h2>How to Measure Soy Sauce for Air Fryer Recipes</h2>  
<p>Liquid measurements are best done at eye level for precision. Pour soy sauce into a clear measuring jug until it reaches the 355 ml mark for 1.5 cups. Avoid using dry measuring cups, as they can lead to spills or inaccuracies. For sticky sauces like soy, a silicone spatula helps scrape every last drop. Find more kitchen hacks at <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>.</p>  

<p>If you’re scaling a recipe up or down, remember that 1.5 cups (355 ml) of soy sauce serves roughly 4–6 portions. For smaller batches, halve the amount to 177.5 ml. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipes</a> often use this measurement for marinades.</p>  

<h3>Soy Sauce Substitutes in Air Frying</h3>  
<p>If you’re out of soy sauce, try tamari or coconut aminos, using the same 355 ml measurement for 1.5 cups. These alternatives work well in air fryer dishes, offering similar savoury notes. Just adjust salt levels accordingly, as some substitutes are less salty.</p>  

<h2>Common Recipes Using 1.5 Cups of Soy Sauce</h2>  
<p>Many air fryer favourites, like teriyaki chicken or glazed salmon, call for 1.5 cups (355 ml) of soy sauce. This quantity is ideal for batch cooking or meal prep. For crispy tofu, marinate cubes in this amount for at least 30 minutes before air frying. Discover more ideas in our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/tofu>tofu category</a>.</p>  

<p>Stir-fries also benefit from this measurement, ensuring even coating without sogginess. Since air fryers circulate hot air, sauces reduce quickly, so 355 ml strikes the right balance. For lighter dishes, try low-sodium soy sauce in the same volume.</p>

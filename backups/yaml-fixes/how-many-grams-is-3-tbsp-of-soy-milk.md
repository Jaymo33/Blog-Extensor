<p>3 tablespoons of soy milk is approximately 45 grams. This conversion is handy for air fryer recipes where precision matters, ensuring your dishes turn out perfectly every time. Whether you're baking, marinating, or creating a sauce, knowing the exact weight of 3 tbsp of soy milk can make all the difference.</p>

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on precise cooking times and ingredient ratios to deliver crispy, evenly cooked results. Using the correct weight for liquids like soy milk ensures your recipes aren't too dry or too soggy. For example, if you're making a batter for <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer tempura</a>, 3 tbsp of soy milk (45g) provides the ideal consistency. Even small deviations can affect texture, so measuring grams instead of volume is often more reliable.</p>  

<p>Many air fryer recipes, especially baked goods or coatings, require exact liquid measurements. Soy milk is a popular dairy-free alternative, and knowing its weight helps when substituting it in recipes. If you're preparing a <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>vegan air fryer cake</a>, 3 tbsp of soy milk (45g) ensures the right moisture level. Always use a kitchen scale for the most accurate results.</p>  

<h3>How to measure 3 tbsp of soy milk in grams</h3>  
<p>The easiest way to convert 3 tbsp of soy milk to grams is by using a digital kitchen scale. Simply place your measuring spoon on the scale, tare it to zero, then pour in the soy milk until it reaches 45g. This method eliminates guesswork and guarantees consistency, especially for air fryer recipes where precision is key.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for 3 tbsp of soy milk in air fryer recipes</h2>  
<p>Three tablespoons of soy milk (45g) is a versatile measurement in air fryer cooking. It's often used in marinades for tofu or vegetables, adding moisture without overpowering flavours. For example, a <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/tofu>crispy tofu recipe</a> might use this amount to create a light coating before adding breadcrumbs. The exact gram measurement ensures the marinade isn't too thin or thick.</p>  

<p>In baking applications, 3 tbsp of soy milk (45g) can help bind ingredients together without making the mixture too wet. When making <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer pancakes</a>, this precise amount creates the perfect batter consistency. Remember that different brands of soy milk may vary slightly in density, so weighing eliminates this variability for perfect results every time.</p>  

<h3>Converting other soy milk measurements to grams</h3>  
<p>If your recipe calls for different amounts of soy milk, here's a quick reference: 1 tbsp equals about 15g, 2 tbsp equals 30g, and 4 tbsp equals 60g. These conversions are useful when scaling air fryer recipes up or down. Always measure liquids by weight for the most accurate results in your cooking.</p>  

<h2>Tips for working with soy milk in air fryer recipes</h2>  
<p>Soy milk behaves slightly differently than dairy milk in cooking. When using 3 tbsp (45g) in air fryer recipes, remember it may brown faster due to its sugar content. Adjust cooking times slightly and keep an eye on your dish. For cleaning up afterwards, check out our guide on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>maintaining your air fryer</a> to keep it in top condition.</p>  

<p>If you're substituting soy milk for regular milk in an air fryer recipe, the 3 tbsp (45g) measurement remains the same by weight. However, you might notice subtle flavour differences. Unsweetened varieties work best for savoury dishes, while vanilla-flavoured soy milk can add a nice touch to desserts. Experiment to find your perfect balance.</p>

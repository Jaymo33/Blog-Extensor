<p>235 ml of milk is approximately 1 cup in UK measurements and just under 1 cup (about 0.99 cups) in US measurements. Whether you're baking a cake or whipping up a creamy sauce in your air fryer, getting the milk measurement right is key to perfect results. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we know how important precise measurements are for air fryer cooking, so let’s break it down.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Milk Measurements Matter</h2>
<p>Using the right amount of milk ensures your recipes turn out as intended. Too much milk can make batters runny, while too little can leave dishes dry. For air fryer recipes like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>cakes</a> or <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>desserts</a>, precision is especially important. A slight variation in milk quantity can affect texture and cooking time. That’s why knowing how to convert 235 ml of milk to cups is so useful.</p>
<p>In the UK, a standard cup holds 250 ml, so 235 ml is just shy of a full cup. In the US, where a cup is 240 ml, 235 ml is about 0.99 cups. This small difference might not seem like much, but for baking, it can make or break your dish. Always check whether your recipe uses UK or US measurements to avoid mishaps.</p>

<h2>Converting 235 ml of Milk to Cups</h2>
<p>Converting millilitres to cups is straightforward once you know the standards. For UK recipes, 235 ml of milk is roughly 0.94 cups (since 250 ml = 1 UK cup). For US recipes, it’s about 0.99 cups (as 240 ml = 1 US cup). If you’re using an air fryer, consistency is key, so measuring correctly ensures even cooking.</p>
<p>If you don’t have a measuring cup, you can use a kitchen scale. Milk weighs roughly 1 gram per millilitre, so 235 ml of milk weighs about 235 grams. This method is handy for those who prefer weighing ingredients.

<h3>Tips for Measuring Milk in an Air Fryer</h3>
<p>When using milk in air fryer recipes, always measure it at room temperature for accuracy. Cold milk can slightly contract, giving you less than intended. Pour slowly to avoid spills, and level off the measuring cup for precision. For recipes like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/breakfast>breakfast dishes</a>, accurate milk measurements ensure perfect texture.</p>

<h2>Common Uses for 235 ml of Milk</h2>
<p>235 ml of milk is a common measurement in many recipes. It’s perfect for single-serving pancakes, small batches of custard, or creamy pasta sauces made in the air fryer. If you’re making a larger batch, simply scale up the measurement accordingly. Always refer to your recipe’s origin (UK or US) to confirm cup sizes.</p>
<p>For those who love baking, 235 ml of milk is often used in <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>muffin or cupcake recipes</a>. The air fryer’s even heat distribution ensures these treats bake perfectly every time. Just remember to adjust cooking times slightly, as air fryers cook faster than conventional ovens.</p>

<h3>Adjusting Recipes for Different Milk Types</h3>
<p>If you’re using skimmed, semi-skimmed, or whole milk, the volume remains the same (235 ml), but the fat content affects texture. Whole milk adds richness, while skimmed milk keeps things lighter. For non-dairy alternatives like almond or oat milk, stick to the same 235 ml measurement unless the recipe specifies otherwise.</p>

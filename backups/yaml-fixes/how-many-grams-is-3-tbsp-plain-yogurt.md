<p>3 tablespoons of plain yogurt weigh approximately 45 grams. This conversion is essential for precise cooking, especially when using an air fryer where measurements can make or break a recipe. Whether you're whipping up a marinade or baking a yogurt-based cake, knowing the exact weight ensures consistency. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we help you nail every measurement for flawless results.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on precise ingredient ratios to achieve even cooking and perfect textures. Too much or too little yogurt can affect moisture levels, browning, and overall taste. For example, a marinade with 3 tbsp plain yogurt (45g) will coat chicken evenly, while a batter with the same amount ensures fluffy cakes. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> simplifies these calculations for stress-free cooking.</p>  

<p>Many air fryer recipes, like our popular <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken dishes</a>, call for yogurt as a tenderiser. Measuring 3 tbsp plain yogurt to grams (45g) guarantees the right balance of acidity and creaminess. No more guessing—just reliable, restaurant-quality results every time.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure 3 Tbsp Plain Yogurt Without a Scale</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a kitchen scale, use standard measuring spoons for accuracy. Fill the tablespoon to the brim without packing it down, then level it off with a knife. Three level tablespoons will give you roughly 45 grams of plain yogurt. For thicker Greek yogurt, the weight may vary slightly, so adjust accordingly.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for 3 Tbsp Plain Yogurt in Air Fryer Recipes</h2>  
<p>This versatile measurement pops up in countless dishes. A 3-tbsp (45g) portion of plain yogurt works wonders in marinades for <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/lamb>lamb kebabs</a>, keeping the meat juicy and flavourful. It’s also key in baking—think air-fryer banana bread or tangy muffins. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a> for more inspiration.</p>  

<p>Yogurt’s acidity helps activate baking soda, making it indispensable for fluffy textures. When a recipe calls for 3 tbsp plain yogurt in grams (45g), you’re ensuring the right chemical reaction for perfect rise and browning. Plus, it adds a subtle tang that balances sweetness in desserts.</p>  

<h3>Converting Other Yogurt Amounts to Grams</h3>  
<p>Need to scale up or down? Here’s a handy reference: 1 tbsp plain yogurt equals 15 grams, while ½ cup (8 tbsp) is about 120 grams. Bookmark our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a> for quick checks mid-recipe. Remember, these values apply to plain, unsweetened yogurt—flavoured varieties may differ due to added sugars.</p>  

<h2>Tips for Storing and Using Plain Yogurt in Air Fryer Meals</h2>  
<p>Keep your yogurt fresh by storing it sealed in the fridge, and always check for spoilage before use. For best results in air fryer cooking, let refrigerated yogurt sit at room temperature for 10 minutes before measuring 3 tbsp (45g). This ensures even mixing and better texture in your dishes.</p>  

<p>Yogurt-based coatings can stick to air fryer baskets if not applied correctly. Lightly grease the basket or use parchment liners from our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning guide</a> to prevent mess. Whether you’re making tandoori chicken or yogurt-dipped veggies, precise measurements lead to perfection.</p>

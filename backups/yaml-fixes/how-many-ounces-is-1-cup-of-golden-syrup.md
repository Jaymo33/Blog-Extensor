<p>1 cup of golden syrup equals approximately 11.5 ounces (or 11.5 oz) in the UK. This measurement is crucial for air fryer recipes where precision matters. Golden syrup, a staple in British baking, has a thick, sticky consistency that requires accurate measuring for best results.</p>

<h2>Why measuring golden syrup correctly matters</h2>
<p>Using the right amount of golden syrup can make or break your air fryer recipes. Too much can make dishes overly sweet and sticky, while too little might leave them lacking flavour. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we know precise measurements are key to perfect results every time.</p>
<p>When converting 1 cup of golden syrup to ounces, it's important to use proper measuring tools. A liquid measuring cup works best for golden syrup due to its viscosity. For more conversion help, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>

<h2>How to measure golden syrup accurately</h2>
<p>Measuring sticky ingredients like golden syrup can be tricky. Here's our foolproof method for getting it right every time:</p>
<ul>
<li>Lightly grease your measuring cup with oil first</li>
<li>Pour the syrup slowly to avoid air bubbles</li>
<li>Level off the top with a straight edge</li>
<li>Use a spatula to remove all the syrup</li>
</ul>

<h3>The science behind golden syrup measurements</h3>
<p>Golden syrup's density affects its weight-to-volume ratio. At room temperature, 1 cup equals about 11.5 ounces because of its specific gravity. This differs from other syrups, so always check your recipe's requirements carefully.</p>

<h2>Common uses for golden syrup in air fryers</h2>
<p>Golden syrup works wonderfully in many <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a>. From sticky puddings to glazed meats, it adds a distinctive caramel flavour. Popular dishes include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Air fryer sticky toffee pudding</li>
<li>Golden syrup glazed gammon</li>
<li>Treacle tart in the air fryer</li>
<li>Syrup-drizzled doughnuts</li>
</ul>

<h3>Storing golden syrup for best results</h3>
<p>Keep your golden syrup in an airtight container at room temperature. Proper storage ensures consistent measurements when you're ready to use it in your next air fryer creation.</p>

<h2>Converting other golden syrup measurements</h2>
<p>While we've focused on 1 cup to ounces, you might need other conversions too. Here are some common ones:</p>
<ul>
<li>1 tablespoon = 0.72 ounces</li>
<li>1 teaspoon = 0.24 ounces</li>
<li>250ml = about 8.8 ounces</li>
</ul>
<p>For more measurement help, visit our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert recipes section</a> where golden syrup features prominently.</p>

<h3>Troubleshooting golden syrup measurements</h3>
<p>If your measurements seem off, check your syrup's temperature. Cold syrup pours more slowly and can lead to inaccurate measurements. Warm it slightly for easier handling and more precise results.</p>

<p>Remember, whether you're making <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>cakes</a> or glazes, knowing that 1 cup of golden syrup equals 11.5 ounces will help you achieve perfect results in your air fryer every time.</p>

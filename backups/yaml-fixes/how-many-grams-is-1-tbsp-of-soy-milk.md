<p>1 tablespoon (tbsp) of soy milk weighs approximately 15 grams. This measurement is essential for precise cooking, especially in air fryer recipes where ingredient ratios can affect texture and cooking times. Whether you're baking, marinating, or making sauces, knowing the exact weight ensures consistent results every time.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on hot air circulation to cook food evenly, and small deviations in ingredient quantities can impact the final dish. For example, adding too much soy milk to a batter can make it too runny, leading to uneven cooking. On the other hand, too little might dry out your dish. That's why converting 1 tbsp of soy milk to grams (15g) is so useful for precision.</p>  

<p>If you're experimenting with new recipes, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for other common ingredient measurements. It’s a handy tool for adapting traditional recipes to air fryer cooking.</p>  

<h3>How to measure soy milk correctly</h3>  
<p>For the most accurate results, use a digital kitchen scale to weigh your soy milk. While measuring spoons are convenient, they can vary slightly in volume. A scale eliminates guesswork, ensuring your air fryer recipes turn out perfectly every time.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for soy milk in air fryer recipes</h2>  
<p>Soy milk is a versatile ingredient in both sweet and savoury air fryer dishes. From creamy sauces to fluffy pancakes, knowing that 1 tbsp of soy milk equals 15 grams helps maintain consistency. Try it in our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer pancake recipe</a> for a dairy-free breakfast option.</p>  

<p>It’s also great for marinating tofu or coating vegetables before air frying. The slight sweetness of soy milk enhances flavours without overpowering them. For more inspiration, browse our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/tofu>tofu recipes</a>.</p>  

<h3>Does soy milk brand affect weight?</h3>  
<p>Most commercially available soy milks have a similar density, so 1 tbsp should still weigh around 15 grams. However, homemade or thickened varieties may differ slightly. If in doubt, weigh your soy milk for the best results.</p>  

<h2>Converting other soy milk measurements</h2>  
<p>If a recipe calls for millilitres instead of tablespoons, remember that 1 tbsp of soy milk is roughly 15ml. This makes conversions straightforward, whether you're scaling up or down. For larger quantities, check our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a>.</p>  

<p>Need to clean your air fryer after cooking with soy milk? Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning guide</a> has tips to keep it in top condition.</p>  

<h3>Storing soy milk for air fryer recipes</h3>  
<p>Once opened, soy milk should be refrigerated and used within a few days. Always give it a shake before measuring, as separation can occur. This ensures an accurate 15g per tablespoon every time.</p>

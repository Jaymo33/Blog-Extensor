<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on even cooking, and incorrect measurements can throw off the balance of your dish. Too much tomato paste can make your food overly tangy, while too little might leave it bland.

<p>Tomato paste is a concentrated ingredient, so small measurement errors can have a big impact. If you’re preparing a large batch, like a family-sized portion of <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>air fryer chicken recipes</a>, precise measurements become even more critical. Always use a kitchen scale for the most accurate results when converting 0.75 cup of tomato paste to oz.</p>  

<h3>How to measure tomato paste without a scale</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a kitchen scale, you can still measure 0.75 cup of tomato paste accurately. A standard US cup holds 8 ounces, so 0.75 cup is three-quarters of that. For UK measurements, the difference is minimal, but always double-check if your recipe specifies a regional standard.

<h2>Common uses for 0.75 cup of tomato paste in air fryer recipes</h2>  
<p>Tomato paste adds depth to many air fryer dishes, from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>roasted vegetables</a> to meat marinades. Knowing that 0.75 cup equals 6 ounces helps you adjust recipes effortlessly. For example, a rich bolognese or a tangy BBQ glaze often calls for this exact measurement.</p>

Remember, tomato paste is potent, so a little goes a long way in enhancing flavours.</p>  

<h3>Storing leftover tomato paste</h3>  
<p>If your recipe only uses part of a can, transfer the remaining tomato paste to an airtight container. It keeps for up to a week in the fridge or several months in the freezer. Label it with the weight (e.g., “6 oz”) for easy future use in air fryer recipes.</p>

<p>2 cups of molasses equals approximately 24 ounces (or 680 grams) in UK measurements. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes, where precise measurements can make or break your dish. Whether you’re baking gingerbread or glazing meats, knowing how many ounces are in 2 cups of molasses ensures consistency and delicious results.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Using the correct amount of molasses is crucial for air fryer recipes, as too much can make dishes overly sticky or sweet, while too little can leave them bland. Molasses adds depth to marinades, glazes, and baked goods, so getting the conversion right matters. For example, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer ginger cookies</a> rely on the perfect balance of molasses for that rich, spiced flavour.</p>  

<p>Air fryers cook food quickly and evenly, but they also amplify flavours, meaning precise measurements are key. If you’re adapting a traditional recipe for your air fryer, converting cups to ounces ensures you don’t end up with a soggy or burnt result. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more handy measurement tips.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure Molasses Correctly</h3>  
<p>Measuring molasses can be tricky due to its thick, sticky consistency. To get an accurate 2-cup measurement, lightly grease your measuring cup with oil first—this helps the molasses slide out easily. Alternatively, use a kitchen scale for the most precise 24-ounce measurement. This method is especially useful for <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>air fryer desserts</a> where texture is everything.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for Molasses in Air Fryer Recipes</h2>  
<p>Molasses is a versatile ingredient that works wonders in both sweet and savoury air fryer dishes. From sticky ribs to spiced cakes, its rich flavour enhances many recipes. For instance, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>molasses-glazed chicken</a> relies on the 2-cups-to-ounces conversion for the perfect caramelised finish.</p>  

<p>You can also use molasses in marinades for meats or as a sweetener in air-fried baked goods. Since air fryers circulate hot air rapidly, molasses-based glazes caramelise beautifully without burning. Just remember: 2 cups of molasses equals 24 ounces, so adjust other ingredients accordingly for balanced flavours.</p>  

<h3>Converting Other Molasses Measurements</h3>  
<p>If your recipe calls for a different amount of molasses, here’s a quick reference: 1 cup = 12 ounces, ½ cup = 6 ounces, and ¼ cup = 3 ounces. Keeping these conversions in mind simplifies scaling recipes up or down for your air fryer. For more measurement tips, visit our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion guide</a>.</p>  

<h2>Tips for Storing and Handling Molasses</h2>  
<p>To keep molasses fresh, store it in a cool, dark place and ensure the lid is tightly sealed. If it crystallises, gently warm the jar in hot water to restore its smooth texture. Proper storage ensures your 2 cups (24 ounces) of molasses stays ready for your next air fryer masterpiece.</p>  

<p>Cleaning up after using molasses is easier if you wipe utensils and bowls immediately with warm, soapy water. For stubborn residue, try our recommended <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner</a> to keep your kitchen spotless. Molasses may be sticky, but with the right techniques, it’s a breeze to work with.</p>

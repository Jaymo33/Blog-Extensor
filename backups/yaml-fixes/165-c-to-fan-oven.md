<p>165 C in a fan oven is equivalent to approximately 145 C in a conventional oven. This 20-degree reduction is standard for fan-assisted cooking, where circulating air distributes heat more efficiently. When using an air fryer, which works similarly to a fan oven, you can typically use the same 165 C setting for most recipes.</p>

<h2>Understanding Fan Oven Temperatures</h2>
<p>Fan ovens revolutionised home baking by cooking food faster and more evenly. The key difference lies in the built-in fan that circulates hot air, eliminating cold spots. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we recommend treating your air fryer like a compact fan oven - both benefit from slightly lower temperatures than traditional ovens.</p>
<p>For delicate bakes like souffl√©s or custards, maintaining precise temperature control is crucial. The 165 C fan setting works beautifully for these dishes, preventing the outer edges from overcooking before the centre sets. Many of our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> use this temperature for perfect results every time.</p>

<h2>Converting 165 C for Different Appliances</h2>
<p>When adapting recipes between appliances, remember that 165 degrees Celsius in a fan oven equals about 185 C in a conventional oven or gas mark 4. Your air fryer likely has similar performance to a fan oven, so no conversion is needed. We've created a handy <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a> for quick reference.</p>
<p>The 165 C setting shines for roasting vegetables or baking fish fillets. The circulating air creates beautifully crisp exteriors while keeping interiors moist. Try this temperature with our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/salmon>salmon recipes</a> for restaurant-quality results at home.</p>

<h3>Why 165 C Works So Well</h3>
<p>This moderate temperature strikes the perfect balance for many dishes. It's hot enough to brown and crisp, yet gentle enough to prevent burning. For air fryer users, 165 C delivers consistent results whether you're reheating leftovers or cooking from scratch.</p>

<h2>Air Fryer Tips at 165 C</h2>
<p>Modern air fryers excel at 165 C for dehydrating fruits or making jerky. The steady, moderate heat removes moisture gradually without scorching. Always preheat your air fryer for 3-5 minutes at this temperature for best results.</p>
<p>Cleaning becomes easier when you cook at controlled temperatures like 165 C. Food is less likely to stick or burn onto surfaces. After cooking, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning guide</a> shows how to maintain your appliance effortlessly.</p>

<h3>Troubleshooting 165 C Cooking</h3>
<p>If foods aren't cooking evenly at 165 C in your fan oven or air fryer, check the placement. Avoid overcrowding baskets or trays to ensure proper air circulation. Rotating pans halfway through cooking can also improve results.</p>

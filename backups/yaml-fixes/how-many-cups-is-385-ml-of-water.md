<p>385 ml of water equals approximately 1.63 cups. This conversion is essential for precise cooking and baking, especially when using an air fryer where measurements can make or break a recipe. Whether you're preparing a sauce, batter, or marinade, knowing how to convert 385 ml of water to cups ensures consistent results every time.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>
<p>Air fryers rely on precise measurements to achieve the perfect texture and flavour. Using the wrong amount of liquid, like 385 ml of water, can affect cooking times and outcomes. For example, adding too much water might make food soggy, while too little could dry it out. That’s why converting 385 ml of water to cups correctly is crucial for air fryer success.</p>
<p>If you're new to air fryer cooking, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for quick reference. It covers common measurements, including how many cups 385 ml of water is, so you can focus on creating delicious meals without the guesswork.</p>

<h2>How to Measure 385 ml of Water Without a Measuring Cup</h2>
<p>Don’t have a measuring cup handy? No problem. You can still measure 385 ml of water using everyday items. A standard mug holds about 250 ml, so 385 ml would be roughly one and a half mugs. Alternatively, use tablespoons—16 tablespoons equal 240 ml, so you’d need around 25 tablespoons for 385 ml.</p>
<p>For more tips on accurate measurements, browse our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipes section</a>, where we share foolproof methods for air fryer cooking. Whether you're making crispy veggies or juicy chicken, getting the liquid right is key.</p>

<h3>UK vs. US Cup Measurements</h3>
<p>It’s worth noting that UK and US cup measurements differ slightly. In the UK, 1 cup is 284 ml, while in the US, it’s 240 ml. So, 385 ml of water is about 1.36 UK cups or 1.63 US cups. Always check which standard your recipe uses to avoid confusion.</p>

<h2>Common Recipes Using 385 ml of Water</h2>
<p>Many air fryer recipes call for around 385 ml of water, especially for batters, soups, and marinades. For instance, a light tempura batter or a creamy mushroom sauce might require this amount. Visit our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable recipes</a> for ideas on how to use 385 ml of water in your cooking.</p>
<p>If you're prepping a large batch, remember that 385 ml of water converts to roughly 1.63 cups. This small detail can make a big difference in achieving the perfect consistency for your dishes.</p>

<h3>Converting Other Liquids</h3>
<p>While this guide focuses on water, the same conversion applies to other thin liquids like broth or milk. However, thicker liquids like syrup may vary slightly due to density. Always measure carefully for the best results in your air fryer creations.</p>

<h2>Tips for Perfect Air Fryer Measurements</h2>
<p>To ensure accuracy, use a clear measuring jug for liquids like 385 ml of water. Place it on a flat surface and check at eye level. For dry ingredients, spoon them into the cup and level off with a knife. These small steps prevent over- or under-measuring, which is vital for air fryer cooking.</p>

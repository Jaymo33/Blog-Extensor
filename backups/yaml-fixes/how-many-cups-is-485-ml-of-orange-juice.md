<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter</h2>
<p>When cooking or baking, especially in an air fryer, precise measurements can make or break a dish. Too much or too little liquid, like orange juice, can affect texture and flavour. For example, a marinade with too much juice might overpower the dish, while too little could leave it dry.</p>

<h2>How to Measure 485 ml of Orange Juice</h2>
<p>Measuring liquids like orange juice can be tricky, but using the right tools helps. A liquid measuring cup with clear markings is ideal for accuracy. Pour the juice slowly to the 485 ml line, or use a kitchen scale for weight-based measurements.</p>

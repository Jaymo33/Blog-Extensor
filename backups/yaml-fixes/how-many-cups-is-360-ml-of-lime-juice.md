<p>360 ml of lime juice is approximately 1.52 cups. This conversion is essential for recipes requiring precise measurements, especially when using an air fryer. Whether you're making marinades, dressings, or desserts, knowing how to convert millilitres to cups ensures consistent results. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we focus on making cooking conversions simple and accurate.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Lime Juice Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of lime juice can make or break a dish. Too little, and your recipe lacks zest; too much, and it becomes overpowering. For air fryer recipes, precise measurements ensure even cooking and balanced flavours. Whether you're making <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>lime-marinated chicken</a> or a tangy dessert, 360 ml of lime juice translates to roughly 1.52 cups.</p>  

<p>Different countries use varying measurement systems, which can be confusing. In the UK, millilitres are standard, while the US often relies on cups. If you're following a recipe from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, knowing these conversions helps avoid mistakes. A slight miscalculation could alter the acidity or moisture content of your dish.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure 360 ml of Lime Juice</h3>  
<p>To measure 360 ml of lime juice accurately, use a liquid measuring cup with millilitre markings. If your cup only has imperial units, remember that 1 cup equals 236.59 ml. For 360 ml, you’ll need just over 1.5 cups. Freshly squeezed lime juice is best, but bottled works too—just check for additives that might affect flavour.</p>  

<h2>Converting 360 ml of Lime Juice for Baking</h2>  
<p>Baking requires precision, and lime juice is no exception. Whether you're making a <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>key lime pie</a> or citrus-infused cookies, 360 ml of lime juice equals 1.52 cups. This measurement ensures your batter or filling has the right consistency and taste. Always level off your measuring cup for accuracy.</p>  

<p>If you’re scaling a recipe up or down, use our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for quick adjustments. For example, halving 360 ml of lime juice would be 180 ml, or roughly 0.76 cups. Keeping these conversions handy saves time and reduces errors, especially when experimenting with new dishes.</p>  

<h3>Using 360 ml of Lime Juice in Marinades</h3>  
<p>Marinades often call for lime juice to tenderise and flavour meats. For 360 ml of lime juice, use 1.52 cups to ensure even coating. This works perfectly for <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/shrimp>shrimp skewers</a> or chicken wings in the air fryer. The acidity helps break down proteins while adding a refreshing tang.</p>  

<h2>Common Mistakes When Measuring Lime Juice</h2>  
<p>One frequent error is confusing fluid ounces with millilitres, leading to incorrect measurements. Another is using dry measuring cups for liquids, which can cause spills or inaccuracies. Always use a jug with clear millilitre markings for 360 ml of lime juice. For sticky liquids like lime juice, lightly grease the cup for easier pouring.</p>  

<p>Bottled lime juice may differ in concentration from fresh, so adjust accordingly. If a recipe specifies fresh lime juice, stick to it for the best results. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we recommend fresh ingredients whenever possible for optimal flavour and texture in air fryer meals.</p>

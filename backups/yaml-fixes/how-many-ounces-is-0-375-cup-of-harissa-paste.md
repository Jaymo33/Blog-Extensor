<h3>How to measure harissa paste correctly</h3>  
<p>To measure 0.375 cup of harissa paste, use a liquid measuring cup for accuracy. Scoop the paste and level it off with a knife. If you don’t have a 0.375 cup measure, 6 tablespoons will give you the same amount. For those who prefer weight, 3 ounces is your target. This method works for all <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>harissa chicken recipes</a> or even roasted vegetable dishes.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for 0.375 cup of harissa paste</h2>  
<p>Harissa paste adds depth to many air fryer recipes. A 0.375 cup (or 3-ounce) portion is perfect for marinating proteins like chicken or lamb. It also works well as a base for sauces or rubs. Try it in <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>spicy air fryer recipes</a> for an extra flavour boost.</p>

This is especially useful for <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/meal-prep>meal prep recipes</a> where precision saves time and ensures delicious results.</p>  

<h3>Adjusting harissa paste quantities for taste</h3>  
<p>While 0.375 cup of harissa paste is 3 ounces, you can tweak this based on preference. For milder heat, reduce the amount slightly. For more intensity, add an extra tablespoon. Remember, air fryers intensify flavours, so start with the standard 3-ounce measurement and adjust from there.</p>

<p>1.5 tablespoons of plain yogurt equals approximately 22.5 grams. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements can make or break your dish. Whether you're making marinades, dips, or baked goods, knowing the exact weight ensures consistency. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we emphasise accuracy to help you achieve the best results. Let’s dive deeper into why this measurement matters and how to use it effectively.</p>

<h2>Why accurate yogurt measurements matter</h2>  
<p>Using the correct amount of plain yogurt in your air fryer recipes ensures the right texture and moisture level. Too much yogurt can make batters runny, while too little may dry out your dish. For example, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer chicken marinade</a> relies on precise yogurt quantities for perfect tenderness. Grams provide a more reliable measurement than volume, especially for thicker ingredients like yogurt. This is why we recommend using a kitchen scale for accuracy.</p>  

<p>Many air fryer recipes, like those in our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a>, list ingredients by weight for consistency. Whether you're making a creamy dip or a fluffy cake, 22.5 grams of yogurt ensures your dish turns out as intended. This small detail can elevate your cooking from good to great. Plus, it eliminates the hassle of scooping and levelling tablespoons, saving you time and effort.</p>  

<h3>How to measure 1.5 tbsp of plain yogurt without scales</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a kitchen scale, you can still measure 1.5 tablespoons of plain yogurt accurately. Use a standard UK tablespoon (15ml) and fill it level to the brim for each scoop. For thicker yogurts like Greek yogurt, gently stir to loosen it before measuring. This method works well for recipes like our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>air fryer desserts</a>, where precision is key. Remember, slight variations won’t ruin your dish, but sticking close to 22.5 grams ensures reliability.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for 1.5 tbsp of plain yogurt in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Plain yogurt is a versatile ingredient in air fryer recipes, from marinades to baking. A 1.5-tablespoon portion (22.5g) is perfect for coating chicken or fish before air frying, creating a crispy yet moist finish. It’s also ideal for small-batch recipes, like single-serve muffins or pancakes. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/breakfast>breakfast recipes</a> for creative ways to use yogurt in the air fryer. Its acidity helps tenderise meats while adding a subtle tang to baked goods.</p>  

<p>Yogurt also works wonders in dips and sauces for air-fried veggies or chips. Combine 22.5 grams of yogurt with herbs and spices for a quick, healthy topping. For cleaning tips after cooking, visit our guide on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>keeping your air fryer spotless</a>. Whether you’re cooking for one or meal prepping, knowing how many grams are in 1.5 tbsp of plain yogurt simplifies your kitchen routine. It’s a small measurement with big potential in air fryer cooking.</p>  

<h3>Tips for substituting plain yogurt in recipes</h3>  
<p>If you’re out of plain yogurt, you can substitute it with an equal weight (22.5g) of sour cream or buttermilk in most air fryer recipes. These alternatives work well in marinades and baked goods, though flavours may vary slightly. For vegan options, coconut yogurt is a great swap—just ensure you measure by grams for accuracy. Experiment with substitutes in our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable-based recipes</a> to find your favourite combination. Always adjust seasoning to balance any flavour differences.</p>

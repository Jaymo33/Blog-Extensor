<p>1.66 cups of crushed garlic equals approximately 13.28 ounces (oz). This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements ensure the best flavour and texture. Whether you're prepping a garlicky marinade or seasoning vegetables, knowing the exact weight saves time and avoids waste.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Garlic Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of crushed garlic can make or break a dish. Too little, and your meal lacks depth; too much, and it overpowers other flavours. Air fryers, like those featured on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, rely on even distribution of ingredients for consistent results. That's why converting 1.66 cups of crushed garlic to ounces (13.28 oz) is so helpful.</p>  

<p>Garlic’s intensity varies depending on how it’s prepared—minced, crushed, or powdered. Crushed garlic, often used in pastes or sauces, has a denser texture than minced. For air fryer recipes like garlic butter shrimp or roasted veggies, this measurement ensures balanced seasoning. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>garlic-infused recipes</a> for inspiration.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure Crushed Garlic Without a Scale</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a kitchen scale, use measuring cups and spoons. One cup of crushed garlic weighs roughly 8 ounces, so 1.66 cups would be just over 13 oz. Pack the garlic lightly to avoid compacting it, which could skew the measurement. For smaller quantities, tablespoons or teaspoons can help—just remember that 1 tablespoon equals about 0.5 ounces.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for 1.66 Cups of Crushed Garlic</h2>  
<p>This quantity is perfect for batch cooking or meal prep. Whip up a large batch of garlic paste, which can be stored in the fridge for weeks. It’s ideal for marinating chicken, beef, or tofu before air frying. Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>garlic chicken recipes</a> for delicious ideas.</p>  

<p>You could also use it to make garlic-infused oils or butters, adding rich flavour to air-fried bread or potatoes. For seafood lovers, try our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/shrimp>garlic shrimp recipes</a>, where precise measurements ensure the perfect balance of flavours.</p>  

<h3>Adjusting Recipes for Personal Taste</h3>  
<p>While 13.28 ounces is the standard conversion, garlic lovers might prefer a heavier hand. Start with the measured amount, then adjust to taste. Remember, air fryers intensify flavours, so a little goes a long way. For milder dishes, reduce the quantity slightly and add herbs like parsley or thyme.</p>  

<h2>Storing Leftover Crushed Garlic</h2>  
<p>If you’ve converted 1.66 cups of crushed garlic to ounces but don’t use it all, proper storage is key. Transfer leftovers to an airtight container and refrigerate for up to two weeks. For longer storage, freeze portions in ice cube trays—each cube holds about 1 ounce, making future meal prep effortless.</p>

<p>Maple syrup is a staple in many air fryer recipes, from glazes to marinades. Using too much or too little can alter the texture and flavour of your dish.

<h3>How to measure 0.5 tbsp of maple syrup</h3>
<p>Measuring sticky ingredients like maple syrup can be tricky. For 0.5 tbsp, use a graduated measuring spoon and level it off with a straight edge.

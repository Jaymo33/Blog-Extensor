<p>1 cup of raisins equals approximately 5.5 ounces (or 155 grams). This measurement is essential for air fryer recipes, ensuring your dishes turn out perfectly every time. Whether you're baking raisin-studded cookies or adding sweetness to a savoury dish, accurate measurements make all the difference.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate raisin measurements matter</h2>  
<p>Using the correct amount of raisins ensures balanced flavours and textures in your cooking. Too many can make a dish overly sweet, while too few might leave it lacking. For air fryer recipes, precise measurements help avoid uneven cooking or burning. If you're exploring new dishes, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipe collection</a> for inspiration.</p>  

<p>Raisins vary slightly in size and density, but the standard conversion remains reliable. Packed or loosely filled cups can affect the weight, so it's best to measure by weight for baking. For more conversions, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> simplifies all your cooking measurements.</p>  

<h2>How to measure raisins correctly</h2>  
<p>For the most accurate results, use a kitchen scale to weigh your raisins. If you don’t have one, lightly spoon raisins into a measuring cup without packing them down. This prevents over-measuring and ensures consistency. Whether you're making a breakfast bake or a dessert, proper measuring guarantees success.</p>  

<h3>Using raisins in air fryer recipes</h3>  
<p>Raisins add natural sweetness and chewiness to air-fried dishes. From oatmeal cookies to stuffed apples, they’re a versatile ingredient. Try them in our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert recipes</a> for a quick and healthy treat. Just remember, 1 cup of raisins equals 5.5 ounces for perfect results every time.</p>  

<h2>Common mistakes when measuring raisins</h2>  
<p>One frequent error is packing raisins too tightly into a cup, which leads to excess weight. Another is using a liquid measuring cup instead of a dry one, causing inaccuracies. Always level off the top with a knife for precision. For more air fryer tips, visit <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>.</p>  

<p>Storing raisins properly also affects their weight. If they’ve dried out, they’ll weigh less, while fresher raisins are slightly heavier. Keep them in an airtight container to maintain consistency. Need cleaning tips? Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner guide</a> keeps your appliance in top shape.</p>  

<h3>Converting raisins for UK recipes</h3>  
<p>In the UK, recipes may use grams instead of ounces. 1 cup of raisins is roughly 155 grams, making conversions simple. Whether you're following a British or American recipe, knowing these measurements ensures accuracy. For more UK-friendly conversions, explore our guides.</p>

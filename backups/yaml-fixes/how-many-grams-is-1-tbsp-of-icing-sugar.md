<p>1 tablespoon (tbsp) of icing sugar weighs approximately 8 grams in the UK. This measurement is essential for baking, especially when using an air fryer for desserts like cakes or cookies. Whether you're dusting a sponge or making frosting, knowing the exact conversion ensures perfect results every time.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Baking</h2>  
<p>Baking is a science, and even small deviations can affect texture and taste. Using the correct grams for 1 tbsp of icing sugar ensures your recipes turn out as intended. Air fryers, like those featured on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, require precise measurements for even cooking. Too much sugar can lead to over-browning, while too little might leave your dessert lacking sweetness.</p>  

<p>Many UK bakers rely on volume measurements like tablespoons, but weight (grams) is far more reliable. A digital kitchen scale removes guesswork, especially for air fryer recipes where consistency is key. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more handy measurement swaps.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure Icing Sugar Correctly</h3>  
<p>For the most accurate 1 tbsp icing sugar to grams conversion, spoon the sugar lightly into the tablespoon and level it off with a knife. Avoid packing it down, as this can add extra grams unintentionally. If you're adapting a recipe for your air fryer, this step is crucial for even heat distribution.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for Icing Sugar in Air Fryer Recipes</h2>  
<p>Icing sugar isn’t just for decorating—it’s a key ingredient in many air fryer desserts. From dusting <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>air fryer cakes</a> to sweetening cookie dough, knowing the grams per tablespoon helps perfect your treats. It also dissolves quickly, making it ideal for glazes and frostings that pair well with air-fried goods.</p>  

<p>If you're reheating pastries in your air fryer, a light sprinkle of icing sugar can revive their freshness. Just remember: 1 tbsp equals about 8 grams, so you don’t overdo it. For more inspiration, browse our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer dessert recipes</a>.</p>  

<h3>Converting Other Sugar Types</h3>  
<p>Granulated and caster sugar weigh differently per tablespoon compared to icing sugar. Always check conversions if substituting in air fryer recipes. For example, 1 tbsp of granulated sugar is roughly 12 grams—50% more than icing sugar. This difference can impact baking times and textures.</p>  

<h2>Tips for Storing Icing Sugar</h2>  
<p>Keep icing sugar in an airtight container to prevent clumping, especially in humid kitchens. If it hardens, pulse it in a blender before measuring. Proper storage ensures your 1 tbsp icing sugar in grams remains consistent for future bakes. For more kitchen hacks, visit <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>.</p>  

<p>For larger batches, note that 1 UK cup of icing sugar is about 120 grams (or 15 tbsp). This helps scale recipes up or down for air fryer-friendly portions. Always sift icing sugar before use to avoid lumps in batters or dustings.</p>

<p>185 ml of evaporated milk is approximately 0.78 cups. This conversion is essential for precise baking and cooking, especially when using an air fryer where measurements matter. Whether you're whipping up a dessert or a savoury dish, knowing how to convert ml to cups ensures consistency in your recipes.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of evaporated milk can make or break a recipe. Too little, and your dish might lack creaminess; too much, and it could become overly dense. For air fryer recipes, precise measurements help achieve the perfect texture and flavour. If you're exploring new dishes, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> for inspiration.</p>  

<p>Evaporated milk is a staple in many recipes, from custards to casseroles. Its concentrated nature means even small measurement errors can impact the final result. That's why converting 185 ml of evaporated milk to cups correctly is crucial. For more tips on conversions, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> is a handy resource.</p>  

<h2>How to Measure 185 ml of Evaporated Milk</h2>  
<p>If you don't have a measuring jug with ml markings, you can still measure 185 ml of evaporated milk accurately. One standard US cup is 240 ml, so 185 ml is roughly three-quarters of a cup plus one tablespoon. For UK measurements, it's slightly different due to metric variations.</p>  

<h3>Using a Kitchen Scale</h3>  
<p>For ultimate precision, weigh your evaporated milk. Since 185 ml of evaporated milk weighs about 195 grams, a kitchen scale can help you measure it perfectly. This method is especially useful for baking, where exact proportions are key.</p>  

<h2>Common Recipes Using 185 ml of Evaporated Milk</h2>  
<p>Many air fryer recipes call for evaporated milk, such as creamy pasta bakes or rich desserts. For example, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert recipes</a> often use this ingredient to add richness without excess liquid. Knowing how many cups 185 ml of evaporated milk equals ensures your dishes turn out just right.</p>  

<p>Another popular use is in savoury dishes like mashed potatoes or soups. The concentrated milk adds creaminess without diluting flavours. If you're prepping meals in advance, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/meal-prep>meal prep recipes</a> offer great ideas for using evaporated milk efficiently.</p>  

<h2>Tips for Storing Evaporated Milk</h2>  
<p>Once opened, evaporated milk should be refrigerated and used within a few days. If your recipe only calls for 185 ml, transfer the remaining milk to an airtight container to keep it fresh. For more kitchen organisation tips, check our guide on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning your air fryer</a> to maintain hygiene.</p>  

<h3>Substitutes for Evaporated Milk</h3>  
<p>If you're out of evaporated milk, you can make a substitute by simmering regular milk to reduce its volume. For 185 ml of evaporated milk, use about 250 ml of regular milk and cook until reduced by roughly a third. This works well in most recipes, though the texture may vary slightly.</p>

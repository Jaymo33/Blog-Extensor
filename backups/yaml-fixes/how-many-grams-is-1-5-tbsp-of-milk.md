<p>1.5 tablespoons (tbsp) of milk is approximately 22.5 grams (g). This conversion is essential for precise measurements in air fryer recipes, ensuring your dishes turn out perfectly every time. Whether you’re baking, cooking, or preparing a sauce, knowing the exact weight of milk can make all the difference.</p>

<h2>Why convert 1.5 tbsp of milk to grams?</h2>  
<p>Converting tablespoons to grams is crucial for accuracy, especially in air fryer cooking. Unlike volume measurements, weight (grams) provides consistency, as the density of ingredients like milk can vary. For example, 1.5 tbsp of milk might look slightly different depending on how it’s measured, but 22.5 grams is always precise.</p>  
<p>Using grams also simplifies scaling recipes. If you’re doubling a recipe or adjusting portions, working in grams ensures uniformity. This is particularly helpful for air fryer recipes, where precise measurements can affect cooking times and results. For more conversion tips, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>

<h2>How to measure 1.5 tbsp of milk accurately</h2>  
<p>To measure 1.5 tbsp of milk, use a standard tablespoon measure and fill it level. Avoid heaping or underfilling, as this can lead to inconsistencies. For even greater accuracy, a kitchen scale is ideal—simply tare the scale with your container and pour milk until it reaches 22.5 grams.</p>  
<p>If you don’t have a scale, remember that 1 tbsp of milk is roughly 15 grams, so 1.5 tbsp equals 22.5 grams. This method works well for most recipes, including those on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>our recipe page</a>. For best results, always use fresh milk at room temperature, as cold milk can slightly alter measurements.</p>

<h3>Does the type of milk affect the weight?</h3>  
<p>Yes, the fat content in milk can slightly change its density. Whole milk is marginally heavier than skimmed milk, but the difference is minimal—around 1-2 grams per 1.5 tbsp. For most air fryer recipes, this small variance won’t impact the outcome, so 22.5 grams is a reliable standard.</p>

<h2>Common uses for 1.5 tbsp of milk in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>1.5 tbsp of milk (22.5 grams) is often used in small-batch recipes, such as single-serving cakes, batters, or creamy sauces. For example, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>air fryer cake recipes</a> frequently call for precise milk measurements to achieve the perfect texture.</p>  
<p>It’s also handy for coating ingredients like chicken or fish before breading. A light milk wash helps breadcrumbs adhere better, creating a crispier finish in the air fryer.

<h3>Can I substitute other liquids for milk?</h3>  
<p>Yes, plant-based milks like almond or oat milk can be used in place of dairy milk. Their weights are similar—around 22-23 grams per 1.5 tbsp—so the conversion remains nearly identical. Just ensure the substitute matches the recipe’s flavour profile.</p>

<h2>Tips for measuring small quantities in air fryer recipes</h2>  
<p>When working with small amounts like 1.5 tbsp of milk, precision matters. Use measuring spoons or a digital scale for accuracy. If scaling up, remember that 3 tbsp of milk equals 45 grams, and so on. This approach is especially useful for <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>air fryer desserts</a>, where balance is key.</p>  
<p>For sticky ingredients, lightly grease your spoon to help milk slide off easily. And always measure over a clean surface to avoid spills—waste not, want not!</p>

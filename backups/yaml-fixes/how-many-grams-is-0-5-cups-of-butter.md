<p>0.5 cups of butter equals approximately 113 grams. This conversion is essential for precise baking and cooking, especially when using an air fryer where measurements can make or break a recipe. Whether you’re whipping up cookies or preparing a savoury dish, knowing how many grams 0.5 cups of butter translates to ensures consistency and delicious results.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Butter Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Using the correct amount of butter is crucial for achieving the right texture and flavour in your dishes. Too much or too little can affect everything from the crispiness of your air-fried cookies to the richness of your sauces. For air fryer recipes, precision is key because the cooking process is faster and more intense than conventional methods. A slight mismeasurement can lead to uneven cooking or overly greasy results.</p>  
<p>At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we emphasise the importance of accurate conversions to help you master air fryer cooking. Whether you’re following a recipe from our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipes</a> section or experimenting with your own creations, knowing how many grams 0.5 cups of butter weighs will set you up for success.</p>

<h2>How to Measure 0.5 Cups of Butter in Grams</h2>  
<p>The easiest way to measure 0.5 cups of butter in grams is by using a kitchen scale. Simply scoop the butter into a measuring cup, then weigh it for an exact gram measurement. If you don’t have a scale, you can use the standard conversion: 1 cup of butter equals 227 grams, so 0.5 cups is half of that, or 113 grams.</p>  
<p>For air fryer recipes, especially those in our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>cake category</a>, precise butter measurements ensure your baked goods rise evenly and have the perfect crumb. If you’re working with melted butter, remember that its volume may differ slightly, but the weight in grams remains the same.</p>

<h3>Butter Conversions for Different Recipes</h3>  
<p>Different recipes may call for butter in various forms—solid, melted, or softened. While 0.5 cups of butter in grams is always 113 grams, the way you incorporate it into your dish can vary. For air fryer cooking, softened butter blends more easily into batters, while melted butter works well for drizzling or coating.</p>

<h2>Common Mistakes When Measuring Butter</h2>  
<p>One of the most common mistakes is packing butter too tightly into a measuring cup, which can lead to using more than the recipe requires. Another error is assuming all butter brands have the same density, which isn’t always the case. For the most accurate results, weigh your butter in grams using a scale.</p>  
<p>If you’re converting a recipe from cups to grams, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for other common ingredient measurements. This tool is especially handy when adapting traditional oven recipes for your air fryer.</p>

<h3>Tips for Using Butter in Air Fryer Recipes</h3>  
<p>Butter can enhance the flavour and texture of air-fried dishes, but it’s important to use it wisely. Too much butter can cause smoking or uneven cooking. For best results, lightly brush or spray butter onto foods rather than pouring it directly into the air fryer basket.</p>

<h2>Butter Substitutes and Their Gram Equivalents</h2>  
<p>If you’re out of butter or prefer a healthier alternative, you can substitute margarine, coconut oil, or olive oil. However, these substitutes may require slight adjustments in quantity. For example, 0.5 cups of coconut oil weighs roughly 112 grams, while margarine is closer to 115 grams per 0.5 cups.</p>

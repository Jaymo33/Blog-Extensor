<p>1.0 cup of lemon juice is equivalent to 240 millilitres (ml). This standard conversion is essential for air fryer recipes, ensuring your dishes have the perfect balance of tangy flavour. Whether you're whipping up a zesty marinade or baking a citrus-infused dessert, precise measurements make all the difference. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we know how crucial accuracy is for air fryer cooking, so let’s dive deeper into lemon juice conversions.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Lemon Juice Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Using the correct amount of lemon juice can make or break your air fryer recipes. Too little, and your dish might lack brightness; too much, and it could become overpoweringly sour. For example, a marinade for <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>air fryer chicken</a> often calls for precise acidity to tenderise the meat without overwhelming it. Similarly, baking recipes like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>air fryer cakes</a> rely on exact liquid ratios for the perfect rise and texture.</p>  

<p>Lemon juice also plays a key role in preserving colour and adding freshness to vegetables. If you’re preparing <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>air fryer roasted veggies</a>, a splash of lemon juice can elevate their natural flavours. Knowing that 1.0 cups equals 240 ml helps you adjust recipes confidently, whether scaling up or down.</p>  

<h3>US vs. UK Cup Measurements</h3>  
<p>While 1.0 US cup of lemon juice is 240 ml, UK cups follow the metric system and measure 250 ml. For most home cooks, this slight difference won’t drastically affect recipes, but it’s worth noting for precision. If your air fryer recipe originates from the US, stick to 240 ml for authenticity. For UK-based recipes, check whether they use metric or imperial cups to avoid confusion.</p>  

<h2>Converting Lemon Juice for Air Fryer Recipes</h2>  
<p>Many air fryer recipes, like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>lemon garlic shrimp</a> or citrus-glazed salmon, specify lemon juice in millilitres for accuracy. If a recipe lists 1.0 cups, you now know it’s 240 ml—no guesswork needed. This is especially helpful for liquid-heavy dishes where balance is key, such as dressings or sauces. Bookmark our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for quick reference during cooking.</p>  

<p>For those who prefer weighing ingredients, 240 ml of lemon juice weighs approximately 244 grams due to its density. This option is handy if you’re using a kitchen scale instead of measuring cups. Remember, fresh lemon juice yields the best flavour, but bottled works in a pinch—just check for additives that might alter taste.</p>  

<h3>Tips for Measuring Lemon Juice</h3>  
<p>To measure 1.0 cups (240 ml) of lemon juice accurately, use a liquid measuring cup with clear ml markings. Strain freshly squeezed juice to remove pulp and seeds for consistent results. If substituting bottled juice, shake well before pouring to evenly distribute any settled concentrate. For smaller amounts, a tablespoon holds 15 ml, so 16 tablespoons equal 1.0 cups.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for 1.0 Cups of Lemon Juice in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>From marinades to desserts, 240 ml of lemon juice opens up a world of air fryer possibilities. Try it in a tangy glaze for <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/salmon>air fryer salmon</a>, or mix with olive oil and herbs for a vibrant dressing. It’s also a key ingredient in lemon curd or drizzle cakes, where acidity balances sweetness perfectly.</p>  

<p>For savoury dishes, lemon juice tenderises meats and brightens grains. A 1.0-cup batch can be divided for multiple recipes or used entirely in larger meals like lemon-infused roast dinners. After cooking, a splash of lemon juice mixed with water helps clean your air fryer basket—see our guide on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaning</a> for more tips.</p>

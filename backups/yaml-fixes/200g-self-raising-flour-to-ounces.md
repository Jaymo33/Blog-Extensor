<p>200g of self-raising flour equals approximately 7.05 ounces. This conversion is essential for air fryer baking, where precise measurements can make or break your recipe. Whether you're making fluffy cakes or crispy batters, knowing how to convert grams to ounces ensures consistent results every time.</p>  

<h2>Why Convert Grams to Ounces for Air Fryer Recipes?</h2>  
<p>Many UK recipes use grams, but some cooks prefer ounces for measuring ingredients like self-raising flour. Converting 200g of self-raising flour to ounces (7.05 oz) helps if your kitchen scales or recipe book uses imperial measurements. Air fryer recipes, especially baked goods, rely on accurate quantities to achieve the perfect texture and rise.</p>  

<p>For example, if you're following a cake recipe from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, knowing the exact weight ensures your batter isn’t too dense or dry. Self-raising flour already contains baking powder, so precise measurements prevent over- or under-leavening. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more handy measurement swaps.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure 200g of Self-Raising Flour Without Scales</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have digital scales, you can still measure 200g of self-raising flour using cups or spoons. One cup of self-raising flour weighs roughly 120g, so 200g is about 1⅔ cups. However, scooping flour directly can lead to compacting, so spoon it lightly into the cup for accuracy.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for 200g of Self-Raising Flour in Air Fryers</h2>  
<p>This quantity is perfect for small-batch baking in your air fryer. Popular recipes include scones, muffins, or even a quick sponge cake. Visit <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>our cake category</a> for inspiration—200g of flour is often the base for 6–8 servings.</p>  

<p>Self-raising flour is also great for coating foods like chicken or fish before air frying. A light dusting (about 20–30g per portion) creates a crispier texture. For more savoury ideas, browse our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipes</a> or <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable dishes</a>.</p>  

<h3>Does 200g of Self-Raising Flour Equal 200g of Plain Flour?</h3>  
<p>While the weight is the same, self-raising flour includes baking powder, which affects the recipe’s rise. If substituting, add 2 tsp of baking powder per 200g of plain flour. Always sift together to distribute evenly for air fryer baking.</p>

<p>335 ml of vinegar equals approximately 1.42 cups (US) or 1.18 cups (UK). Whether you're marinating chicken or whipping up a tangy glaze for air-fried veggies, getting the measurement right is key. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we know precision matters—especially when balancing acidity in recipes like air-fryer pulled pork or quick-pickled onions.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Vinegar Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Vinegar’s acidity can make or break a dish. Too much, and your air-fryer wings turn mouth-puckeringly sharp; too little, and your slaw lacks zing. For consistent results, converting 335 ml of vinegar to cups ensures your dressings, brines, and deglazing liquids hit the mark every time. Check our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for other common liquid conversions.</p>  

<p>In baking, vinegar activates baking soda—so 335 ml (about 1.4 US cups) must be precise for cakes or bread to rise properly. Even air-fryer doughnuts rely on this balance. For savoury dishes, like our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>air-fryer chicken recipes</a>, vinegar tenderises meat while adding brightness.</p>  

<h3>US vs. UK Cup Measurements</h3>  
<p>The difference between US and UK cups matters here. A US cup holds 240 ml, while a UK imperial cup is 284 ml. So, 335 ml converts to 1.42 US cups or 1.18 UK cups. Always check your recipe’s origin—especially for air-fryer sauces where consistency is crucial.</p>  

<h2>How to Measure 335 ml of Vinegar Without a Scale</h2>  
<p>No measuring jug? Use tablespoons: 335 ml equals roughly 22.5 UK tbsp or 22.3 US tbsp. For air-fryer marinades, this hack saves time. Alternatively, repurpose a clean 330 ml soda can (plus a teaspoon) for near-perfect 335 ml measurements. Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air-fryer recipes</a> for creative uses.</p>  

<p>For sticky ingredients like balsamic vinegar, lightly grease your measuring cup first—this ensures every drop counts. And if you’re scaling a recipe up or down, remember: 335 ml of vinegar is just over 1⅓ US cups. Need to clean spills? Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner guide</a> has tips.</p>  

<h3>Common Recipes Using 335 ml of Vinegar</h3>  
<p>This quantity shines in bulk prep. Think tangy BBQ sauces for air-fryer ribs, or vinegar-based slaws to pair with crispy fish. It’s also ideal for pickling vegetables—try it with air-fried beetroot from our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable recipes</a>.</p>

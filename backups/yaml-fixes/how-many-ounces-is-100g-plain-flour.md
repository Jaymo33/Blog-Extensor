<p>100g of plain flour equals approximately 3.53 ounces. This conversion is essential for air fryer baking, where precise measurements can make or break your recipe. Whether you're whipping up cakes, cookies, or bread, knowing how to convert grams to ounces ensures consistency. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we help you nail every measurement for perfect results every time.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate flour measurements matter</h2>  
<p>Using the correct amount of flour is crucial in air fryer baking. Too much flour can make your baked goods dense, while too little can leave them crumbly. For example, if a recipe calls for 100g of plain flour and you use the wrong ounce equivalent, your cake might not rise properly. That’s why knowing that 100g of plain flour is 3.53 ounces is so helpful. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more handy measurement tips.</p>  

<p>Many UK recipes use grams, but if you’re working with an older cookbook or an international recipe, ounces might be the default. Converting 100g of plain flour to ounces ensures you’re following the recipe correctly. This is especially important for air fryer recipes, where precision affects cooking time and texture. Whether you’re making <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>cakes</a> or bread, getting the flour right is key.</p>  

<h3>How to measure 100g of plain flour without scales</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a kitchen scale, you can still measure 100g of plain flour using cups or spoons. One cup of plain flour is roughly 120g, so 100g would be just under a cup. However, this method isn’t as precise as weighing, so for best results, we recommend using scales.

<h2>Common air fryer recipes using 100g of plain flour</h2>  
<p>Many air fryer recipes call for 100g of plain flour, from fluffy pancakes to crispy coatings. For instance, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cookies>cookie recipes</a> often use this measurement for the perfect texture. Knowing that 100g equals 3.53 ounces means you can adapt any recipe with confidence. Whether you’re baking or frying, precise flour measurements ensure delicious results.</p>  

<p>Another great example is air fryer tempura batter, which often uses 100g of plain flour for a light, crispy finish. If you’re making <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/shrimp>shrimp tempura</a>, getting the flour right is essential. Too much flour makes the batter heavy, while too little won’t coat properly. With our conversion, you’ll get it spot on every time.</p>  

<h3>Tips for storing plain flour</h3>  
<p>To keep your plain flour fresh, store it in an airtight container in a cool, dry place. This ensures your 100g measurements stay accurate over time.

        "@type": "Answer",

Lime juice has a density close to water, so 660 ml is roughly 660 grams, but this can vary slightly depending on acidity and pulp content. For precise air fryer recipes, always measure by volume when the recipe specifies millilitres."

If substituting, ensure the bottled juice is 100% lime juice without added sweeteners or preservatives. The 660 ml (2.79 cups) measurement remains the same, but taste may differ slightly in your air fryer dishes."

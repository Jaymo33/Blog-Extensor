Whether you're making breakfast bars or adding barley to a savoury dish, knowing the weight helps avoid under or over-measuring.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>

For perfect air fryer meals, always measure ingredients like rolled barley by weight when possible.

<p>Rolled barley is a versatile ingredient, great for breakfast bowls, stews, or even baking. If you're using it in an air fryer, remember that 1.33 cups equals roughly 5.3 oz. This ensures your recipes turn out just right, whether you're following a <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe from our collection</a> or experimenting on your own.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure Rolled Barley Correctly</h3>  
<p>For the most accurate measurement, use a kitchen scale. Scoop the barley into a measuring cup, then level it off with a straight edge. If you don’t have a scale, fluff the barley first to prevent compacting, which can lead to incorrect amounts. This method ensures you get the right 5.3 oz for 1.33 cups.</p>

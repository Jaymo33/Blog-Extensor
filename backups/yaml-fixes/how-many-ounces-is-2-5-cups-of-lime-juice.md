<h2>Why accurate lime juice measurements matter</h2>

A precise 2.5 cups (20 oz) of lime juice works perfectly for marinades, like those used in <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>air fryer chicken recipes</a>.

For best results, always measure liquids properly before adding them to your air fryer.</p>  

<p>Lime juice is a staple in many cuisines, from Mexican to Thai, making it a versatile ingredient.

<p>For the most accurate 2.5 cups (20 oz) measurement, use a liquid measuring cup rather than dry cups. Fill to the brim at eye level to avoid under- or over-pouring.

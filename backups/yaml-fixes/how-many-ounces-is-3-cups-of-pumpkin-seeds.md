<p>3 cups of pumpkin seeds weigh approximately 12 ounces (340 grams). This conversion is handy when preparing air fryer recipes, ensuring you get the perfect crunch every time. Whether you're roasting them as a snack or using them in a dish, accurate measurements matter. Visit <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> for more tips on perfecting your air fryer meals.</p>

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter</h2>
<p>Getting the right amount of pumpkin seeds ensures your air fryer recipes turn out just right. Too few, and your dish might lack texture; too many, and they won’t cook evenly. Pumpkin seeds are a great source of protein and healthy fats, making them a popular choice for air fryer snacks. For more recipe ideas, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipes section</a>.</p>

<p>Converting cups to ounces can be tricky, especially with ingredients like pumpkin seeds, which vary in size. A standard cup holds about 4 ounces of pumpkin seeds, so 3 cups equal roughly 12 ounces. This measurement is consistent whether you're using US or UK cups, but always double-check if precision is key. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a> can help with other common ingredients.</p>

<h3>How to measure pumpkin seeds correctly</h3>
<p>For the most accurate results, use a kitchen scale to weigh your pumpkin seeds. If you don’t have one, fluff the seeds in the container before scooping them into a measuring cup. Level off the top with a straight edge to avoid overpacking. This method ensures you’re getting the right amount for your air fryer recipes.</p>

<h2>Using pumpkin seeds in your air fryer</h2>
<p>Pumpkin seeds are incredibly versatile in the air fryer. You can roast them with a bit of salt for a crunchy snack or use them as a topping for salads and soups. They also add a nice crunch to baked goods like bread or muffins. For more inspiration, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/snacks>snacks category</a>.</p>

<p>When roasting pumpkin seeds in the air fryer, spread them out in a single layer for even cooking. A temperature of 160°C (320°F) for 10-12 minutes usually does the trick. Shake the basket halfway through to prevent burning. For cleaning tips after cooking, visit our guide on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer maintenance</a>.</p>

<h3>Storing leftover pumpkin seeds</h3>
<p>If you have leftover pumpkin seeds, store them in an airtight container at room temperature. They’ll stay fresh for up to a month, though they’re best enjoyed within a week for maximum crunch. You can also freeze them for longer storage, but let them come to room temperature before using.</p>

<h2>Common mistakes when measuring pumpkin seeds</h2>
<p>One of the biggest mistakes is packing the seeds too tightly into the measuring cup. This can lead to using more than the recipe calls for, affecting the final result. Another error is not shaking the air fryer basket during cooking, which can cause uneven roasting. Always follow the recipe’s measurements and instructions for the best outcome.</p>

<p>Another pitfall is assuming all pumpkin seeds weigh the same. Larger seeds might take up more space in the cup, while smaller ones pack more densely. If precision is crucial, weighing them is the way to go. For more air fryer tips and tricks, head back to <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>.</p>

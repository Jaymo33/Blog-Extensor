<p>1.5 cups of minced onion equals approximately 6 ounces (170 grams). This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements ensure even cooking and perfect results. Whether you're prepping a stir-fry, casserole, or seasoning blend, knowing the exact weight saves time and avoids guesswork.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on hot air circulation to cook food evenly, and incorrect ingredient quantities can lead to uneven results. Using 1.5 cups of minced onion (6 ounces) ensures consistency, especially in dishes like <a href="https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes">air fryer fajitas</a> or onion-heavy casseroles. Overloading the basket with too much onion can block airflow, while too little may dry out your dish.</p>  

<p>For UK cooks, note that 1 US cup equals 8 fluid ounces, but minced onion's weight varies slightly due to density. A kitchen scale is the best tool, but if you don't have one, our <a href="https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart">conversion chart</a> simplifies the process. Check out our <a href="https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables">vegetable recipes</a> for inspiration!</p>  

<h3>How to Measure Minced Onion Without a Scale</h3>  
<p>If you lack a scale, lightly pack the minced onion into a measuring cup without pressing down. Fluff it with a fork to avoid compacting, which can skew the weight. For 1.5 cups, aim for a mound slightly above the rim, then level it off with a knife.</p>  

<h2>Common Recipes Using 1.5 Cups of Minced Onion</h2>  
<p>Many air fryer dishes call for this quantity, such as <a href="https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes">onion bhajis</a> or stuffed peppers. The 6-ounce measurement ensures balanced flavour without overwhelming other ingredients. For frozen pre-minced onion, thaw and drain excess liquid first to avoid soggy results.</p>  

<p>Pair minced onion with proteins like <a href="https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken">chicken</a> or tofu for quick, flavourful meals. Need cleaning tips after chopping onions? Our <a href="https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner">air fryer cleaner guide</a> helps remove lingering odours.</p>  

<h3>Adjusting Recipes for Different Onion Cuts</h3>  
<p>If a recipe specifies diced or sliced onion instead of minced, adjust the volume. Minced onion packs more densely, so 1.5 cups of diced onion weighs slightly less (about 5 ounces). Always check the recipe's preferred cut for accuracy.</p>

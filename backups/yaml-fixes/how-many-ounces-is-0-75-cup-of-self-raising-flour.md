<p>0.75 cup of self-raising flour equals approximately 3.5 ounces (99 grams). This conversion is essential for baking, especially when using an air fryer, where precise measurements can make or break your recipe. Whether you're whipping up cakes, muffins, or bread, knowing the exact weight ensures consistency. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we focus on helping you achieve perfect results with accurate conversions and expert tips.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Flour Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Baking is a science, and even small deviations in flour measurements can affect texture and rise. Self-raising flour contains baking powder, so incorrect amounts may lead to dense or overly airy results. For air fryer recipes, precision is even more critical due to the compact cooking space. Using 0.75 cup of self-raising flour (3.5 oz) ensures your baked goods cook evenly. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more handy measurements.</p>  

<p>Measuring by weight (ounces or grams) is more reliable than volume (cups) because flour can settle or be packed differently. A kitchen scale eliminates guesswork, but if you don’t have one, fluff the flour before scooping and level it off. This method helps approximate the correct weight for 0.75 cup of self-raising flour. For more baking tips, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>cake recipes</a> designed for air fryers.</p>  

<h2>Converting 0.75 Cup Self-Raising Flour to Ounces</h2>  
<p>To convert 0.75 cup of self-raising flour to ounces, use the standard weight of 1 cup (4.6 oz or 130 grams). Multiply by 0.75 to get 3.5 ounces (99 grams). This measurement is consistent across UK recipes, ensuring your air fryer bakes turn out perfectly. If you’re adjusting a recipe, always double-check conversions to avoid mishaps.</p>  

<h3>Common Uses for 0.75 Cup Self-Raising Flour</h3>  
<p>This amount is ideal for small-batch baking, such as air fryer muffins, scones, or single-serving cakes. It’s also useful for coating proteins like chicken or fish before air frying. For inspiration, browse our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a>, where precise measurements guarantee success.</p>  

<h2>Tips for Measuring Flour Correctly</h2>  
<p>Always spoon flour into the measuring cup and level it with a knife for accuracy. Avoid tapping or packing the flour, as this adds extra weight. If using a scale, place your bowl on it first, then zero it out before adding flour. These steps ensure your 0.75 cup of self-raising flour equals 3.5 ounces every time.</p>  

<h3>Adjusting Recipes for Air Fryers</h3>  
<p>Air fryers cook faster than conventional ovens, so reduce baking times by 20-25%. For recipes using 0.75 cup of self-raising flour, check for doneness a few minutes early. Keep your air fryer clean for even cooking—our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning guide</a> has all the tips you need.</p>

<p>5 grams of hot sauce equals approximately 0.18 ounces. This conversion is handy when following air fryer recipes that require precise measurements for the perfect balance of flavour. Whether you’re whipping up spicy wings or a zesty marinade, knowing how to convert grams to ounces ensures your dish turns out just right.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Precision is key when cooking with an air fryer, especially with ingredients like hot sauce that can easily overpower a dish. Too much or too little can throw off the entire recipe. For example, if you’re making <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>spicy air fryer chicken wings</a>, 5g of hot sauce (0.18 oz) might be just enough for a mild kick, while doubling it could make them fiery hot.</p>  

<p>Many UK recipes use grams, but if you’re working with a kitchen scale that only measures ounces, this conversion is essential. A small discrepancy in measurements can affect texture, cooking time, and overall taste. That’s why we recommend keeping a <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a> handy for quick reference.</p>  

<h3>How to measure 5g of hot sauce without a scale</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a kitchen scale, you can estimate 5g of hot sauce using a teaspoon. Roughly, 5g is about one level teaspoon, though this can vary slightly depending on the sauce’s thickness. For thicker sauces like sriracha, it might be slightly less, while runnier sauces like Tabasco could fill the teaspoon more.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for 5g of hot sauce in air fryer recipes</h2>  
<p>Hot sauce is a versatile ingredient in air fryer cooking. From marinades to glazes, 5g (0.18 oz) can add just the right amount of heat. Try it in <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>air fryer chicken recipes</a> or drizzle it over roasted vegetables for an extra kick. It’s also great in dipping sauces when mixed with mayo or yoghurt.</p>  

<p>If you’re meal prepping, knowing how many ounces 5g of hot sauce is can help you batch-cook with consistency. For example, if you’re making a large batch of <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>spicy air fryer veggies</a>, scaling up the hot sauce proportionally ensures every portion has the same heat level.</p>  

<h3>Converting other hot sauce quantities</h3>  
<p>If your recipe calls for more or less hot sauce, here’s a quick reference: 10g is roughly 0.35 oz, and 15g is about 0.53 oz. For larger quantities, 100g equals approximately 3.53 oz. Keep these conversions in mind when adjusting recipes to suit your taste.</p>  

<h2>Tips for storing and using hot sauce in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Hot sauce can last a long time if stored properly, but always check for freshness before use. If you’re using 5g (0.18 oz) in a marinade, let the ingredients sit for at least 30 minutes to allow the flavours to meld. For glazes, brush the hot sauce onto your food during the last few minutes of air frying to prevent burning.</p>  

<p>Cleaning your air fryer after cooking with hot sauce is important to avoid lingering smells. Check out our guide on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>how to clean your air fryer</a> for tips on keeping it in top condition. A well-maintained air fryer ensures your dishes taste their best every time.</p>

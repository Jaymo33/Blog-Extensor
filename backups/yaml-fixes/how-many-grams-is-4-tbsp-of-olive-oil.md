<p>4 tablespoons (tbsp) of olive oil equals approximately 54 grams (g). This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes, where precise measurements can make or break your dish. Whether you’re drizzling oil over chips or marinating chicken, knowing the exact weight ensures consistent results. For more air fryer conversions, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate olive oil measurements matter</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of olive oil in your air fryer prevents soggy or overly dry results. Too much oil can lead to excess smoke, while too little may leave food undercrisped. A standard UK tablespoon holds roughly 13.5 grams of olive oil, so 4 tbsp equals 54 grams. This measurement is particularly useful for recipes like crispy potatoes or roasted vegetables. For more inspiration, browse our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a>.</p>  

<p>Olive oil’s density can vary slightly depending on type and temperature, but 54 grams is a reliable benchmark. Extra virgin olive oil may weigh marginally more due to its richer consistency. Always measure oil at room temperature for the most accurate results. This ensures your air fryer dishes turn out perfectly every time.</p>  

<h3>How to measure 4 tbsp of olive oil without scales</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have kitchen scales, use a standard UK tablespoon (15ml) to measure your olive oil. Fill it level to the brim for an accurate 13.5-gram portion. Four level tablespoons will give you approximately 54 grams. For sticky ingredients like honey, you might need a <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>special cleaner</a> to remove residue, but olive oil wipes away easily.</p>  

<h2>Converting other olive oil quantities to grams</h2>  
<p>Beyond 4 tbsp, you might need to convert other olive oil measurements for air fryer cooking. One teaspoon (tsp) equals about 4.5 grams, while a UK cup (250ml) holds roughly 216 grams. These conversions are handy when scaling recipes up or down. For example, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>air fryer chicken recipes</a> often call for precise oil measurements.</p>  

<p>Remember that different oils have different weights – coconut oil is denser, while vegetable oil is lighter. Always check specific conversions if substituting oils in air fryer recipes. Olive oil’s 54 grams per 4 tbsp makes it ideal for most air frying needs, providing just enough crispness without overpowering flavours.</p>  

<h3>Common air fryer recipes using 4 tbsp olive oil</h3>  
<p>Many air fryer dishes use around 4 tbsp (54g) of olive oil. This quantity perfectly coats a batch of homemade chips or a tray of roasted Mediterranean vegetables. It’s also ideal for marinating chicken thighs or preparing crispy tofu.

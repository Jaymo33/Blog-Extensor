<p>235 ml of evaporated milk is approximately 1 cup in both UK and US measurements. This conversion is essential for baking, cooking, or preparing air fryer recipes where precision matters. Whether you're making a creamy dessert or a savoury dish, knowing the exact measurement ensures perfect results every time.</p>

<h2>Understanding Evaporated Milk Measurements</h2>
<p>Evaporated milk is a staple in many recipes, from cakes to creamy sauces. When a recipe calls for 235 ml of evaporated milk, it's helpful to know how that translates to cups. In the UK and US, 1 cup is roughly 240 ml, making 235 ml just shy of a full cup. This small difference usually won’t affect most recipes, but for precision, it's good to be aware.</p>
<p>If you're using an air fryer for baking or cooking, accurate measurements are key. A slight variation in liquid ingredients like evaporated milk can alter the texture of your dish. For more air fryer conversion tips, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> to simplify your cooking process.</p>

<h3>Why Accurate Measurements Matter</h3>
<p>Using the right amount of evaporated milk ensures your recipes turn out as intended. Too much or too little can affect the consistency, flavour, and even cooking time. This is especially important in air fryer recipes, where precise measurements help achieve the perfect crispiness or tenderness.</p>

<h2>Converting 235 ml of Evaporated Milk to Cups</h2>
<p>To convert 235 ml of evaporated milk to cups, you can use a simple rule of thumb: 240 ml equals 1 cup. Since 235 ml is very close to this, you can safely use 1 cup in your recipes. For those who prefer exact measurements, 235 ml is about 0.98 cups, but rounding up to 1 cup is generally acceptable.</p>
<p>If you're working with a recipe that requires multiple measurements, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a> offers plenty of ideas to put your evaporated milk to good use. From desserts to mains, you'll find inspiration for every meal.</p>

<h3>Measuring Without a Cup</h3>
<p>If you don’t have a measuring cup handy, you can use a kitchen scale. Evaporated milk weighs roughly 250 grams per cup, so 235 ml would be about 245 grams. This method is just as accurate and can be a lifesaver when you're in a pinch.</p>

<h2>Common Uses for Evaporated Milk</h2>
<p>Evaporated milk is a versatile ingredient used in both sweet and savoury dishes. It’s often found in desserts like custards, pies, and fudge, as well as in creamy pasta sauces or soups. Its rich, concentrated flavour adds depth to any recipe.</p>
<p>For air fryer enthusiasts, evaporated milk can be used in recipes like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>desserts</a> or even creamy dips. Its consistency helps create a smooth texture, making it a favourite among home cooks.</p>

<h3>Storing Evaporated Milk</h3>
<p>Once opened, evaporated milk should be stored in the fridge and used within a few days. If you’re not planning to use it all at once, consider freezing it in ice cube trays for easy portioning later. This way, you’ll always have the right amount on hand for your next culinary adventure.</p>

<h2>Tips for Baking with Evaporated Milk</h2>
<p>When baking with evaporated milk, it’s important to account for its reduced water content. This means you may need to adjust other liquid ingredients in your recipe slightly. Always follow the recipe closely, especially when using an air fryer, as cooking times and temperatures can vary.</p>
<p>For more baking tips and tricks, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning and maintenance guide</a> to keep your air fryer in top condition. A well-maintained appliance ensures consistent results every time you cook.</p>

<h3>Substituting Evaporated Milk</h3>
<p>If you’re out of evaporated milk, you can make a substitute by simmering regular milk until it reduces by about 60%. This homemade version works well in most recipes, though it may not be as rich as the canned variety. Just remember to adjust your measurements accordingly.</p>

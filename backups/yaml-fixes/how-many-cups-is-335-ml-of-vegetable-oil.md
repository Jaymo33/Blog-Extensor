<p>335 ml of vegetable oil equals approximately 1.42 cups in US measurements or 1.18 cups in UK measurements. Whether you're using an air fryer or baking, getting the right amount of oil is crucial for perfect results. This guide will help you convert 335 ml of vegetable oil to cups accurately, so your recipes turn out just right every time.</p>  

<h2>Understanding the Conversion</h2>  
<p>Converting millilitres to cups can be tricky because the size of a cup varies between the UK and the US. In the US, 1 cup is 240 ml, while in the UK, it's 284 ml. For 335 ml of vegetable oil, this means you'll get different measurements depending on where you are. If you're using an air fryer, precision matters—too much oil can make food soggy, while too little can dry it out.</p>  
<p>For US measurements, 335 ml of vegetable oil is roughly 1.42 cups. In the UK, it's about 1.18 cups. Always double-check your recipe's origin to ensure you're using the right conversion. If you're unsure, refer to our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for quick reference.</p>  

<h3>Why Accurate Measurements Matter</h3>  
<p>Using the correct amount of vegetable oil ensures your food cooks evenly and retains the right texture. Whether you're air frying chicken or baking a cake, 335 ml of vegetable oil converted correctly can make or break your dish. Too much oil can lead to greasy results, while too little might leave your food dry and undercooked.</p>  

<h2>How to Measure 335 ml of Vegetable Oil</h2>  
<p>If you don't have a measuring jug, you can use a standard cup to measure 335 ml of vegetable oil. For US cups, fill it to just under 1.5 cups. For UK cups, aim for slightly more than 1 cup. A kitchen scale can also help—335 ml of vegetable oil weighs around 300 grams, depending on density.</p>  
<p>For air fryer recipes, precision is key. Many dishes, like crispy potatoes or chicken wings, rely on the right oil balance. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipes section</a> for dishes that use 335 ml of vegetable oil or similar measurements.</p>  

<h3>Common Uses for 335 ml of Vegetable Oil</h3>  
<p>335 ml of vegetable oil is often used in baking, frying, or air frying. It's enough for a batch of muffins, a large tray of roasted vegetables, or several servings of crispy air-fried chicken. If you're meal prepping, this measurement can help you portion oil evenly across dishes.</p>  

<h2>Converting Other Measurements</h2>  
<p>If you need to convert other amounts, the same principles apply. For example, 500 ml of vegetable oil is roughly 2.11 US cups or 1.76 UK cups. Always adjust based on your recipe's requirements. For more conversions, visit our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a>.</p>  
<p>Remember, air fryers often need less oil than traditional frying methods. A light coating of 335 ml of vegetable oil can go a long way when distributed properly.

<h3>Tips for Using Vegetable Oil in Air Fryers</h3>  
<p>When air frying, use a spray bottle to evenly distribute 335 ml of vegetable oil. This ensures crispiness without excess grease. For healthier options, consider using olive oil or avocado oil, but adjust measurements accordingly.</p>

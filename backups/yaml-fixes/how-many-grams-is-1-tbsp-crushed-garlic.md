<p>1 tablespoon (tbsp) of crushed garlic weighs approximately 9 grams. This measurement is essential for air fryer recipes where precision can make all the difference in flavour and texture. Whether you’re whipping up a quick garlic butter sauce or marinating chicken, knowing the exact weight ensures consistency. For more air fryer conversions, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate garlic measurements matter</h2>  
<p>Using the correct amount of crushed garlic can elevate your air fryer dishes from good to great. Too little, and the flavour might be underwhelming; too much, and it can overpower other ingredients. Garlic’s potency varies depending on how finely it’s crushed, so weighing it ensures accuracy. If you’re prepping meals in advance, precise measurements help maintain consistency across batches. Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> for inspiration on using garlic effectively.</p>  

<h3>How to measure crushed garlic correctly</h3>  
<p>For the most accurate results, use a digital kitchen scale to weigh your crushed garlic. If you don’t have one, lightly pack the garlic into a tablespoon without pressing too hard, as this can affect the weight. Freshly crushed garlic tends to be denser than pre-packaged varieties, so adjust accordingly. Always level off the spoon for consistency, especially when following recipes from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>.</p>  

<h2>Common conversions for crushed garlic</h2>  
<p>Beyond 1 tbsp, here are some handy conversions for crushed garlic: 1 teaspoon (tsp) equals roughly 3 grams, while 2 tbsp weigh around 18 grams. These measurements are useful when scaling recipes up or down. If you’re working with whole cloves, one medium clove yields about 1 tsp of crushed garlic.

<h3>Using crushed garlic in air fryer recipes</h3>  
<p>Crushed garlic adds depth to marinades, rubs, and sauces for air-fried dishes like chicken, potatoes, or vegetables. Mix it with olive oil for a simple glaze or combine it with herbs for a flavourful crust. Since air fryers cook quickly, garlic’s flavour infuses efficiently without burning.

<h2>Tips for storing crushed garlic</h2>  
<p>To keep crushed garlic fresh, store it in an airtight container in the fridge for up to a week. For longer storage, freeze it in ice cube trays with a bit of oil or water. Pre-measured portions save time and ensure you always have the right amount on hand. If you’re meal prepping, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/meal-prep>meal prep recipes</a> for ideas.</p>  

<h3>Adjusting garlic quantities to taste</h3>  
<p>While 1 tbsp of crushed garlic equals about 9 grams, personal preference plays a role. Start with the recommended amount and adjust gradually, especially if you’re new to cooking with garlic. Remember, air frying concentrates flavours, so a little often goes a long way. For more air fryer tips, visit <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>.</p>

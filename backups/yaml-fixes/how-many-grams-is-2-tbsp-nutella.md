<p>2 tablespoons (tbsp) of Nutella weigh approximately 37 grams. This measurement is essential for air fryer recipes where precision ensures perfect texture and consistency. Whether you’re baking Nutella-filled pastries or adding it to desserts, knowing the exact weight helps avoid over or under-measuring.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on even heat distribution, so ingredient accuracy is crucial. Too much Nutella can cause spills or uneven cooking, while too little might leave your dish lacking flavour. For recipes like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>Nutella-stuffed cookies</a>, 37 grams per 2 tbsp ensures the right balance.</p>  
<p>Using a digital scale is the easiest way to measure Nutella, as its thick texture can make spoon measurements inconsistent. If you don’t have one, levelling off your tablespoons with a knife helps. For more air fryer tips, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a>.</p>  

<h2>Converting 2 Tbsp of Nutella to Grams</h2>  
<p>The standard conversion for Nutella is 1 tbsp = ~18.5 grams, so 2 tbsp equals roughly 37 grams. This applies to UK measurements, where tablespoons are slightly larger than US ones. Always check your recipe’s origin to avoid discrepancies.</p>  
<p>Nutella’s density can vary slightly with temperature. If it’s warm, it may settle differently in a measuring spoon. For best results, weigh it directly. Need inspiration? Try our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert recipes</a> featuring Nutella.</p>  

<h3>Tips for Measuring Nutella Perfectly</h3>  
<p>For sticky ingredients like Nutella, lightly greasing your spoon or scale bowl prevents waste. If your recipe calls for melted Nutella, measure it solid first, then melt—this avoids inaccuracies from volume changes.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for 2 Tbsp of Nutella in Air Fryers</h2>  
<p>From <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/breakfast>Nutella-stuffed French toast</a> to drizzle over air-fried bananas, 37 grams is a versatile quantity. It’s enough to fill 4–6 mini pastries or top a batch of air-fried pancakes.</p>  
<p>Remember, Nutella burns easily at high heat. When using it in air fryers, opt for lower temperatures (160–180°C) and shorter times. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning guide</a> to tackle any sticky spills.</p>  

<h3>Nutella Substitutes and Their Weights</h3>  
<p>If substituting Nutella with peanut butter or chocolate spread, note that weights may differ. For example, 2 tbsp of peanut butter weighs ~32 grams. Always adjust measurements for alternative spreads.</p>

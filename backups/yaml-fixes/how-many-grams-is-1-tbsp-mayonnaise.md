<p>1 tablespoon (tbsp) of mayonnaise weighs approximately 14 grams in the UK. This measurement is essential for air fryer recipes where precision ensures perfect texture and flavour. Whether you’re making crispy chicken or a creamy dip, knowing the exact weight helps avoid soggy or dry results. For more air fryer conversions, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>

<h2>Why accurate mayonnaise measurements matter</h2>
<p>Using the correct amount of mayonnaise can make or break your air fryer dish. Too much can lead to excess oil, while too little might leave your food dry. A precise 14 grams per tablespoon ensures balanced moisture and crispiness. This is especially important for recipes like air-fried chicken or fish, where mayonnaise acts as a binder for breadcrumbs. Visit <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> for recipes that rely on accurate measurements.</p>
<p>Mayonnaise density can vary slightly by brand, but 14 grams is a reliable standard for UK measurements. If you’re using a heaped tablespoon, it might weigh closer to 16 grams. For best results, use a digital kitchen scale to confirm. This small step can elevate your air fryer cooking from good to great.</p>

<h2>How to measure 1 tbsp mayonnaise without scales</h2>
<p>If you don’t have a scale, use a levelled UK tablespoon for the closest approximation. Fill the spoon and scrape off the excess with a straight edge for accuracy. Remember, 1 tbsp of mayonnaise to grams is roughly 14g, but slight variations won’t ruin most dishes. For baking or precise recipes, though, scales are ideal.</p>
<p>Another trick is to check the mayonnaise jar’s nutrition label, which often lists grams per serving. Many UK brands specify 14g per tablespoon, making conversions easier. For more tips, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipe collection</a>, where measurements are key.</p>

<h3>Common mistakes when converting tablespoons to grams</h3>
<p>One error is using a dessert spoon instead of a tablespoon, which holds less mayonnaise. Another is compacting the mayonnaise into the spoon, which increases the weight. Always measure lightly for the most accurate 1 tbsp mayonnaise in grams result. These small details ensure your air fryer meals turn out perfectly every time.</p>

<h2>Mayonnaise conversions for popular air fryer recipes</h2>
<p>Many air fryer recipes, like crispy chicken or potato wedges, use mayonnaise for extra flavour and texture. For example, a coating of 28 grams (2 tbsp) of mayonnaise helps breadcrumbs adhere evenly. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipes</a> for ideas using this method.</p>
<p>If you’re adapting a recipe from cups to grams, note that 1 cup of mayonnaise weighs around 224 grams (16 tbsp). This conversion is handy for larger batches or meal prep. Whether you’re cooking for one or a family, precise measurements ensure consistent results.</p>

<h3>Does mayonnaise brand affect the weight per tablespoon?</h3>
<p>While most UK mayonnaise brands weigh about 14g per tbsp, lighter or premium versions may differ slightly. Always check the label if precision is crucial. For everyday cooking, the standard 1 tbsp mayonnaise to grams conversion works perfectly.</p>

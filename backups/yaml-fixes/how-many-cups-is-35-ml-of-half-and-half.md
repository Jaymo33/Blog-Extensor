<p>35 ml of half and half is approximately 0.15 cups (UK) or 0.148 cups (US). Whether you're whipping up a creamy sauce or baking a delicious dessert, knowing this conversion ensures your air fryer recipes turn out perfectly every time. Half and half, a blend of equal parts milk and cream, is a staple in many dishes, so getting the measurements right is key.</p>

<h2>Understanding Half And Half Measurements</h2>
<p>Half and half is a versatile ingredient used in everything from coffee to custards. Its unique 50-50 milk-to-cream ratio means it’s thicker than milk but lighter than heavy cream. When converting 35 ml of half and half to cups, it’s important to note whether you’re using UK or US measurements, as they differ slightly. For UK measurements, 35 ml equals roughly 0.15 cups, while in the US, it’s about 0.148 cups.</p>
<p>If you’re working with an air fryer, precise measurements can make or break your dish. For example, adding too much half and half to a batter could make it too runny, while too little might leave it dry. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> can help you nail these measurements every time.</p>

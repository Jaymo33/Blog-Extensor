<p>760 ml of lime juice equals approximately 3.2 cups in the UK or 3.21 cups in the US. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes, baking, and cooking where precise measurements matter. Whether you're making a zesty marinade or a tangy dessert, knowing how to convert 760 ml of lime juice to cups ensures consistent results every time.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Lime Juice Measurements Matter</h2>
<p>Getting the right amount of lime juice can make or break a recipe. Too little, and your dish lacks flavour; too much, and it becomes overpowering. For air fryer recipes, especially marinades or glazes, 760 ml of lime juice in cups is a common measurement. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we emphasise precision to help you achieve restaurant-quality results at home.</p>
<p>Lime juice is a versatile ingredient used in everything from dressings to desserts. Whether you're preparing a citrusy chicken dish or a refreshing sorbet, converting 760 ml of lime juice to cups ensures you follow the recipe correctly. This is particularly important for air fryer cooking, where balanced flavours are key to success.</p>

<h2>UK vs US Cup Measurements</h2>
<p>It's worth noting that UK and US cup measurements differ slightly. In the UK, 1 cup equals 284 ml, while in the US, it's 236.59 ml. This means 760 ml of lime juice converts to 3.2 UK cups or 3.21 US cups. For most recipes, this small difference won't matter, but for precision baking, it's good to be aware.</p>
<p>If you're using an air fryer recipe from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>our collection</a>, check whether it follows UK or US measurements. Many modern recipes specify, but when in doubt, UK measurements are a safe bet for British cooks. Either way, 760 ml of lime juice will give you roughly 3 and a bit cups.</p>

<h3>Converting 760 ml Lime Juice for Baking</h3>
<p>When baking with lime juice, accuracy is crucial. Too much liquid can throw off the texture of cakes or cookies. If your recipe calls for 760 ml of lime juice, measure carefully using a jug with both ml and cup markings. This ensures your air fryer desserts turn out perfectly every time.</p>

<h3>Using Lime Juice in Air Fryer Marinades</h3>
<p>Lime juice is a popular ingredient in air fryer marinades, especially for chicken or seafood. When converting 760 ml of lime juice to cups for a marinade, you can be slightly more flexible with measurements. The acidity helps tenderise meat while adding bright, fresh flavour to your dishes.</p>

<h2>Tips for Measuring Lime Juice</h2>
<p>For the most accurate measurement of 760 ml lime juice in cups, use a liquid measuring cup rather than dry measuring cups. The spout makes pouring easier and reduces spills. If you don't have measuring cups, remember that 760 ml is just over 3 cups - close enough for most cooking purposes.</p>
<p>At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>our conversion chart</a>, you'll find handy references for all your measurement needs. Whether you're converting lime juice or other ingredients, having these tools at your fingertips makes air fryer cooking simpler and more enjoyable.</p>

<h3>Storing Leftover Lime Juice</h3>
<p>If you don't use all 760 ml of lime juice at once, store the remainder in an airtight container in the fridge. It will keep for about a week, ready for your next air fryer adventure. You can also freeze lime juice in ice cube trays for convenient portioning later.</p>

<h2>Common Recipes Using 760 ml Lime Juice</h2>
<p>Several popular air fryer recipes call for around 760 ml of lime juice. These include citrus-glazed chicken, key lime pie filling, and tangy barbecue sauces. The bright acidity of lime juice balances rich flavours and adds a refreshing twist to both sweet and savoury dishes.</p>
<p>For inspiration, browse our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipes</a> featuring lime juice marinades. The 760 ml measurement often appears in bulk cooking or meal prep scenarios, perfect for making larger batches of your favourite dishes to enjoy throughout the week.</p>

<h3>Adjusting Recipes for Personal Taste</h3>
<p>While 760 ml of lime juice equals about 3.2 cups, feel free to adjust to your preferences. Some people prefer a more subtle lime flavour, while others love it bold and tangy. Your air fryer gives you the flexibility to experiment with these measurements until you find your perfect balance.</p>

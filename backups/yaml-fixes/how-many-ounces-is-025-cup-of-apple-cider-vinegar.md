<p>0.25 cup of apple cider vinegar equals 2 fluid ounces (fl oz). This measurement is essential for air fryer recipes, ensuring your marinades, sauces, and dressings are perfectly balanced. Whether you’re whipping up a tangy glaze or a healthy vinaigrette, knowing this conversion helps avoid guesswork.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Precision is key when using an air fryer, as ingredients cook faster and more evenly than in traditional ovens. Too much or too little liquid, like apple cider vinegar, can affect texture and flavour. For example, a marinade with the right balance of acidity ensures tender, juicy results. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more handy measurement tips.</p>  

<p>Apple cider vinegar is a popular ingredient in air fryer recipes, from crispy chicken wings to tangy roasted vegetables. Its acidity helps tenderise meats and adds a bright note to dishes. By measuring 0.25 cup (2 fl oz) correctly, you’ll achieve consistent results every time. Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> for inspiration.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure 0.25 Cup of Apple Cider Vinegar</h3>  
<p>Use a liquid measuring cup for accuracy, filling it to the 0.25 cup mark. Alternatively, a tablespoon measure can help—0.25 cup equals 4 tablespoons. For UK cooks, note that 1 UK fluid ounce is roughly equivalent to 1 US fluid ounce, so the conversion remains the same.

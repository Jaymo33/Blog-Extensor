<p>15 grams of baking soda equals approximately 0.53 ounces. This conversion is essential for anyone using UK recipes or working with air fryers, where precise measurements can make or break a dish. Whether you’re baking, cleaning, or experimenting with <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a>, knowing how to convert grams to ounces ensures consistency and success.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on precise ingredient ratios to achieve the perfect texture and flavour. Too much or too little baking soda can affect the rise of cakes, the crispiness of batters, or even the cleaning efficiency of DIY solutions. For example, if you’re making <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>air fryer cakes</a>, 15g of baking soda (0.53 oz) helps create a light, fluffy texture. Similarly, using the right amount ensures your <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaning</a> hacks work effectively without residue.</p>  

<p>Many UK recipes list ingredients in grams, but some cooks prefer ounces for convenience. A digital kitchen scale is the most reliable tool for these conversions, but if you don’t have one, memorising key conversions like 15g to ounces can save time. For more conversions, check our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>  

<h3>How to measure 15g of baking soda without a scale</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a scale, you can use measuring spoons to approximate 15g of baking soda. One level tablespoon holds about 10g, so 1.5 tablespoons will give you roughly 15g (0.53 oz). However, this method isn’t as precise as weighing, especially for recipes requiring exact measurements. For best results, invest in a digital scale or refer to our conversion guides.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for 15g of baking soda in air fryers</h2>  
<p>Baking soda isn’t just for cakes—it’s a versatile ingredient in air fryer cooking. From creating crispy coatings to neutralising odours, 15g (0.53 oz) can go a long way. For instance, adding a pinch to your <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>air fryer chicken</a> batter helps achieve a golden, crunchy exterior. It’s also great for deodorising your air fryer basket between uses.</p>  

<p>Another popular use is in homemade air fryer cleaning pastes. Mixing 15g of baking soda with water creates a gentle abrasive that removes stubborn grease without damaging non-stick coatings. This simple trick keeps your air fryer in top condition, ensuring even cooking and prolonging its lifespan.</p>  

<h3>Converting other baking soda amounts to ounces</h3>  
<p>If your recipe calls for more or less than 15g, here are some quick conversions: 5g is roughly 0.18 oz, 30g is about 1.06 oz, and 50g equals 1.76 oz. These conversions are handy when scaling recipes up or down. Remember, accuracy is key, especially when baking or preparing batters for air fryer dishes.</p>

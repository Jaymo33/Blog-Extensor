<p>1.75 cups of tahini equals approximately 14 ounces. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements can make or break your dish. Whether you're making hummus, dressings, or marinades, knowing how to convert cups to ounces ensures consistency and perfect results every time.</p>

<h2>Why accurate tahini measurements matter</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of tahini is crucial for balancing flavours in your air fryer recipes. Too much can overpower other ingredients, while too little might leave your dish lacking depth. Tahini's thick, paste-like consistency means volume measurements (like cups) can vary slightly, making weight measurements (like ounces) more reliable. For best results, we recommend using a kitchen scale when working with tahini.</p>  

<p>At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, weâ€™ve found that most air fryer-friendly dips and sauces call for tahini in ounce measurements rather than cups. This is particularly true for recipes like our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer falafel</a> or roasted vegetable dips where tahini is a key ingredient. Converting 1.75 cups to ounces (14 oz) gives you the precision needed for these dishes.</p>

<h3>How to measure tahini correctly</h3>  
<p>Measuring sticky ingredients like tahini can be tricky. For the most accurate 1.75 cups (14 oz) measurement, lightly spray your measuring cup with oil first. This helps the tahini slide out easily and ensures you get the full amount. Alternatively, use the displacement method: fill a liquid measuring cup with 1.75 cups of water, add tahini until the water reaches 3.5 cups, then drain the water.</p>

<h2>Converting tahini for UK air fryer recipes</h2>  
<p>Many UK air fryer enthusiasts prefer working in metric measurements, but some older recipes still use cups. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> can help bridge this gap. Remember that 1.75 cups of tahini equals 14 ounces or about 400 grams. This conversion is particularly useful when adapting American recipes for your UK kitchen.</p>  

<p>When preparing tahini-based marinades for <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>air fryer chicken</a>, precise measurements ensure even coating and perfect cooking. The 1.75 cups (14 oz) measurement works well for batch cooking or meal prep, giving you enough tahini for multiple servings without waste.</p>

<h3>Tahini storage tips for air fryer cooks</h3>  
<p>After measuring out your 1.75 cups (14 oz) of tahini, proper storage maintains its quality. Always stir well before use as the oil separates naturally. Store opened tahini in the refrigerator where it will keep for up to 6 months. For easy access when cooking, consider portioning your tahini into smaller containers using the 1.75 cups to ounces conversion as a guide.</p>

<h2>Common uses for 1.75 cups of tahini in air frying</h2>  
<p>This quantity (14 oz) of tahini is perfect for making large batches of air fryer-friendly sauces and dips. Try it in our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>roasted vegetable dips</a> or as a base for marinades. The rich, nutty flavour of tahini complements air-fried foods beautifully, adding depth without overpowering other ingredients.</p>

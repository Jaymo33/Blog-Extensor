<p>360 ml of condensed milk is approximately 1.5 cups. This conversion is essential for baking and cooking, especially when using an air fryer where precise measurements matter. Whether you're making a dessert or a savoury dish, knowing how to convert 360 ml of condensed milk to cups ensures your recipe turns out perfectly every time.</p>

<h2>Understanding the Conversion</h2>
<p>Converting millilitres to cups can be tricky, especially with ingredients like condensed milk, which has a thick consistency. For 360 ml of condensed milk, the standard conversion is 1.5 cups. This measurement is based on the UK metric cup, which holds 240 ml. If you're using a US cup, which is slightly smaller at 237 ml, the conversion remains roughly the same due to the minimal difference.</p>
<p>When working with air fryer recipes from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, accuracy is key. Too much or too little condensed milk can affect the texture and taste of your dish. Always use a measuring jug or cups designed for liquids to ensure precision. For more conversions, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>

<h2>Why Measurement Accuracy Matters</h2>
<p>Condensed milk is a staple in many desserts, from fudgy brownies to creamy cheesecakes. Using the correct amount ensures your dish has the right sweetness and consistency. In an air fryer, where cooking times are shorter, precise measurements prevent undercooked or overcooked results. For example, 360 ml of condensed milk in a recipe might need slight adjustments if you're scaling up or down.</p>
<p>If you're experimenting with air fryer desserts, like those in our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>cake category</a>, knowing how many cups 360 ml of condensed milk equals is invaluable. It saves time and reduces waste, making your baking experience smoother and more enjoyable.</p>

<h3>Tips for Measuring Condensed Milk</h3>
<p>To measure 360 ml of condensed milk accurately, use a liquid measuring cup with clear markings. Pour the milk slowly to avoid air bubbles, and level it off with a spatula. If your recipe calls for a different amount, you can easily scale the measurement. For instance, 180 ml would be 0.75 cups, and 720 ml would be 3 cups.</p>

<h3>Common Recipes Using 360 ml of Condensed Milk</h3>
<p>Many air fryer recipes, like banoffee pie or caramel slices, use 360 ml of condensed milk. This quantity is perfect for a medium-sized dessert serving 4-6 people. If you're making a larger batch, double the measurement to 3 cups (720 ml). For smaller portions, halve it to 0.75 cups (180 ml). Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert category</a> for inspiration.</p>

<h2>Converting Other Measurements</h2>
<p>Besides cups, you might need to convert 360 ml of condensed milk to other units. For tablespoons, 360 ml equals roughly 24 tablespoons. For ounces, it's about 12.2 fluid ounces. These conversions are handy when following international recipes or using specific measuring tools. Always refer to a reliable conversion guide, like the one on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, to avoid mistakes.</p>
<p>If you're cleaning your air fryer after making a sticky condensed milk dessert, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning guide</a> has you covered. Proper maintenance ensures your air fryer stays in top condition for all your culinary adventures.</p>

<p>635 ml of apple cider vinegar equals approximately 2.68 cups. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes, baking, or meal prep where precision matters. Whether you're whipping up a marinade or a tangy glaze, knowing the exact measurement ensures perfect results every time.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of apple cider vinegar can make or break a dish. Too little, and your marinade lacks tang; too much, and it overpowers other flavours. Air fryer recipes, like those on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, often rely on precise liquid measurements for even cooking. A slight variation can affect texture, especially in baked goods or glazes.</p>  

<p>For example, if you're preparing a crispy chicken recipe from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>our recipe collection</a>, the apple cider vinegar measurement ensures the meat stays tender. Similarly, dressings or pickling solutions need exact ratios for balanced acidity. Always measure liquids like apple cider vinegar carefully to avoid kitchen mishaps.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure 635 ml of Apple Cider Vinegar Without a Scale</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a measuring jug with millilitre markings, use standard cup measurements. Since 635 ml converts to roughly 2.68 cups, you can use a 1-cup measure twice and a 2/3 cup measure to get close. For even better accuracy, check our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for other common liquid conversions.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for 635 ml of Apple Cider Vinegar</h2>  
<p>Apple cider vinegar is a versatile ingredient in air fryer cooking. From marinades to cleaning solutions, here’s how 635 ml (or 2.68 cups) can be used. For tangy glazes on salmon or chicken, this quantity is perfect for batch cooking. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/salmon>salmon recipes</a> for inspiration.</p>  

<p>It’s also great for homemade pickling solutions or salad dressings. If you’re meal prepping, 635 ml of apple cider vinegar can make multiple servings of vinaigrette. And don’t forget—it’s a natural cleaner for your air fryer basket! Mix it with water and use our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning guide</a> for a sparkling appliance.</p>  

<h3>Does the Type of Cup Affect the Measurement?</h3>  
<p>Yes! The UK uses metric cups (250 ml), while the US uses customary cups (240 ml). For 635 ml of apple cider vinegar, the difference is minimal—about 2.68 UK cups vs. 2.65 US cups. For most air fryer recipes, this slight variance won’t impact results, but it’s good to know for precision baking.</p>

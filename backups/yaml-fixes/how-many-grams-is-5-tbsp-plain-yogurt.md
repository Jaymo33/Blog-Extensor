<p>5 tablespoons of plain yogurt is approximately 75 grams. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements can make or break your dish. Whether you're whipping up a marinade or baking a yogurt-based cake, knowing the exact weight ensures consistency. For more handy conversions, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter</h2>  
<p>Using the correct amount of yogurt can affect texture, moisture, and flavour in your air fryer dishes. Too much yogurt might make your batter too wet, while too little could leave it dry. This is especially important for recipes like air-fried yogurt chicken or yogurt-marinated vegetables. If you're new to air frying, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a> for inspiration.</p>  

<p>Measuring by weight (grams) is more reliable than volume (tablespoons) because yogurt density can vary. Greek yogurt, for example, is thicker and heavier than regular plain yogurt. Always use a kitchen scale for the best results, especially when precision is key.</p>  

<h2>Converting 5 tbsp plain yogurt to grams</h2>  
<p>As a general rule, 1 tablespoon of plain yogurt weighs about 15 grams. Therefore, 5 tablespoons equal roughly 75 grams. This conversion works for most standard plain yogurts available in UK supermarkets. For thicker yogurts like Greek or Skyr, the weight may be slightly higher—around 20 grams per tablespoon.</p>  

<h3>Factors affecting yogurt weight</h3>  
<p>The fat content and brand of yogurt can influence its weight. Full-fat yogurts tend to be denser than low-fat versions. Always check the nutrition label if you need exact measurements. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipe category</a> includes several dishes where precise yogurt measurements are crucial.</p>  

<h2>Using yogurt in air fryer recipes</h2>  
<p>Yogurt is a versatile ingredient in air frying, acting as a tenderiser for meats or a base for dips. For example, a 75-gram portion (5 tbsp) of yogurt can marinate two chicken breasts perfectly. It also works well in air-fried desserts like yogurt cakes or parfaits. Discover more ideas in our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert recipe section</a>.</p>  

<p>When substituting yogurt in recipes, remember that 5 tbsp (75g) can replace about 60ml of milk or buttermilk. This makes it a great alternative for those avoiding dairy or looking for a tangier flavour. Always adjust cooking times slightly, as yogurt-based dishes may brown faster in the air fryer.</p>  

<h3>Cleaning tips after using yogurt</h3>  
<p>Yogurt can stick to your air fryer basket if not cleaned promptly. Use warm, soapy water and our recommended <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner</a> to remove any residue. For stubborn spots, a soft sponge or brush works wonders without damaging non-stick coatings.</p>  

<h2>Common yogurt measurement questions</h2>  
<p>Many home cooks wonder if they can use heaped or level tablespoons for measuring yogurt. For accuracy, always level off the tablespoon with a knife. A heaped tablespoon could add an extra 5-10 grams, which might throw off your recipe. This is particularly important for baking, where ratios are critical.</p>  

<p>If you don't have a scale, remember that 5 tbsp of plain yogurt fills roughly half a standard UK teacup (150ml). For more measurement hacks, browse our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/tips>tips section</a>. Whether you're making tandoori chicken or a yogurt-based dip, precise measurements lead to better results.</p>

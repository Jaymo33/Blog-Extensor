<p>4 tablespoons (tbsp) of almond butter equals approximately 64 grams (g). This conversion is essential for precise cooking, especially when using an air fryer, where accurate measurements can make or break a recipe. Whether you're whipping up a batch of almond butter cookies or adding it to a savoury dish, knowing the exact weight ensures consistency. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we focus on helping you get the details right for flawless results every time.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on even cooking, and incorrect ingredient quantities can lead to uneven textures or undercooked food. Almond butter, with its thick consistency, needs precise measurement to avoid altering the recipe’s balance. For example, adding too much can make baked goods dense, while too little might leave them dry. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> simplifies these calculations, so you never have to guess.</p>  

<p>If you’re converting 4 tbsp of almond butter into grams for a recipe, using a kitchen scale is the most reliable method. Scooping almond butter straight from the jar can vary in weight due to its sticky texture. Levelling off each tablespoon ensures consistency, but weighing removes all doubt. For more tips on perfecting air fryer recipes, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a>.</p>  

<h3>How to measure almond butter without a scale</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a scale, spooning almond butter into a measuring tablespoon and levelling it off with a knife works. However, this method can still result in slight variations. For sticky ingredients like almond butter, lightly greasing the spoon helps it slide off easily. Remember, 4 tbsp almond butter to grams is roughly 64g, but slight differences won’t ruin most recipes.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for almond butter in air fryer recipes</h2>  
<p>Almond butter is a versatile ingredient in both sweet and savoury dishes. From energy bites to marinades, its rich flavour enhances many recipes. Try adding it to <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert recipes</a> like air-fried cookies or drizzling it over roasted vegetables. Its high oil content means it browns beautifully in the air fryer, adding depth to your dishes.</p>  

<p>For a protein-packed breakfast, spread almond butter on toast and air-fry for a crispy finish. You can also mix it into batters for muffins or pancakes. Since 4 tbsp of almond butter in grams is 64g, you can adjust recipes accordingly. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/breakfast>breakfast ideas</a> for more inspiration.</p>  

<h3>Storing almond butter for freshness</h3>

<p>960 ml of single cream is equivalent to approximately 4 cups. This conversion is essential for anyone preparing recipes that require precise measurements, especially when using an air fryer. Whether you're whipping up a creamy dessert or a savoury sauce, knowing how to convert millilitres to cups ensures your dish turns out perfectly every time.</p>

<h2>Understanding the Conversion</h2>
<p>Converting millilitres to cups can be tricky, especially when dealing with liquids like single cream. The standard conversion rate is 240 ml per cup, which means 960 ml divides neatly into 4 cups. This measurement is consistent across most UK and US recipes, making it easy to follow along without confusion.</p>
<p>If you're using an <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>, you'll find that liquid measurements are often listed in both millilitres and cups. This helps ensure accuracy, whether you're scaling a recipe up or down. Single cream, being a common ingredient in many air fryer dishes, benefits from precise measurement to achieve the desired consistency.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter</h2>
<p>When cooking or baking, especially in an air fryer, precise measurements can make or break a dish. Too much single cream can lead to overly rich or runny results, while too little might leave your recipe dry or lacking flavour. Measuring 960 ml of single cream correctly ensures your dishes turn out as intended.</p>
<p>For those who love experimenting with <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a>, knowing how to convert 960 ml of single cream to cups is a game-changer. It allows you to adapt recipes from different sources without worrying about inconsistencies. Plus, it saves time by eliminating guesswork.</p>

<h3>Tips for Measuring Single Cream</h3>
<p>To measure 960 ml of single cream accurately, use a liquid measuring cup with clear markings. Pour the cream slowly to avoid spills and check the measurement at eye level for precision. If you don't have a measuring cup, a kitchen scale can also help—1 ml of single cream weighs roughly 1 gram, so 960 ml would be 960 grams.</p>

<h2>Common Uses for 960 ml of Single Cream</h2>
<p>Single cream is a versatile ingredient used in both sweet and savoury dishes. From creamy pasta sauces to indulgent desserts, 960 ml (or 4 cups) of single cream can elevate your cooking. In the air fryer, it's perfect for making rich custards, velvety soups, or even as a base for marinades.</p>
<p>If you're preparing a <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert recipe</a>, 960 ml of single cream can be whipped into a light and fluffy topping or used to create a silky ganache. For savoury dishes, it adds a luxurious touch to mashed potatoes or a creamy Alfredo sauce. The possibilities are endless when you know how to measure it correctly.</p>

<h3>Adjusting Recipes for Smaller Batches</h3>
<p>If your recipe calls for less than 960 ml of single cream, simply divide the measurement accordingly. For example, half of 960 ml is 480 ml, which equals 2 cups. This flexibility makes it easy to scale recipes up or down depending on your needs, whether you're cooking for one or a crowd.</p>

<h2>Storing Leftover Single Cream</h2>
<p>If you don't use all 960 ml of single cream at once, proper storage is key to maintaining its freshness. Transfer any leftover cream to an airtight container and refrigerate it for up to three days. You can also freeze single cream, though it may separate slightly when thawed—perfect for cooking but less ideal for whipping.</p>

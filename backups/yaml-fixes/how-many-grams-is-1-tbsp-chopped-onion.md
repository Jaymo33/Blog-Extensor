<h2>Why accurate onion measurements matter</h2>  
<p>Using the correct amount of chopped onion is crucial for balancing flavours in your air fryer dishes. Too much can overpower, while too little might leave your meal tasting bland.

<h3>How to measure chopped onion correctly</h3>  
<p>To get an accurate 1 tbsp chopped onion to grams measurement, finely dice the onion and lightly pack it into the spoon. Avoid pressing too hard, as this can compact the onion and skew the weight. A level tablespoon is ideal for most recipes. If you're converting larger quantities, a kitchen scale will give you the most precise results.

<h2>Common uses for chopped onion in air fryers</h2>  
<p>Chopped onion adds depth to countless air fryer dishes, from fajitas to meatloaf. Knowing the grams in 1 tablespoon of chopped onion helps you replicate restaurant-quality meals at home. It's also useful for marinades, where precise ratios matter. Try adding 10 grams (1 tbsp) of onion to your next batch of air-fried chicken wings for extra flavour.

<p>For vegetarian options, 1 tbsp of chopped onion (10 grams) can elevate air-fried tofu or vegetable skewers.

<h3>Converting larger quantities</h3>  
<p>If your recipe calls for multiple tablespoons of chopped onion, simply multiply the grams accordingly. For example, 3 tbsp would be about 30 grams. This UK conversion for 1 tbsp chopped onion grams works for both fresh and frozen varieties. Just remember that frozen onions may release more moisture during cooking. Adjust cooking times slightly if needed, especially for crispy textures.</p>

<p>2.75 cups of broccoli roughly equals 220 grams, making it easy to measure for your air fryer recipes. Whether you're meal prepping or following a specific dish, knowing this conversion ensures accuracy and consistency in your cooking. Broccoli is a versatile vegetable that works brilliantly in air fryers, offering a crispy texture with minimal oil. For more air fryer conversions, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter for Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Precision is key when using an air fryer, as overcrowding or uneven portions can affect cooking times and results. Measuring 2.75 cups of broccoli in grams (220g) helps ensure even cooking and perfect crispiness. Air fryers rely on hot air circulation, so properly portioned ingredients cook more efficiently. If you're new to air frying, browse our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a> for inspiration.</p>  

<p>Broccoli is a staple in many healthy meals, and its weight can vary slightly depending on how finely it's chopped. For best results, lightly pack the broccoli into your measuring cup before converting to grams. This method gives the most consistent measurement for recipes like air-fried broccoli bites or stir-fries.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure Broccoli for Air Fryer Recipes</h3>  
<p>To measure 2.75 cups of broccoli accurately, use a kitchen scale for the most precise gram conversion. If you don't have a scale, lightly fill your measuring cups without compacting the florets too tightly. Remember that 2.75 cups of broccoli equals roughly 220 grams, but slight variations won't drastically alter most recipes. For more vegetable-focused dishes, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable recipes</a>.</p>  

<h2>Converting Cups to Grams for Different Broccoli Cuts</h2>  
<p>The way you chop broccoli affects its cup-to-gram ratio. Florets weigh slightly less than stems when measured by volume, so 2.75 cups of chopped florets may be closer to 200 grams. If you're using a mix of stems and florets, aim for the 220-gram benchmark. For recipes like air-fried broccoli cheese bites, consistency in size ensures even cooking.</p>  

<p>If you're working with frozen broccoli, note that 2.75 cups will weigh more due to ice content—around 250 grams. Thaw and drain it well before air frying to avoid excess moisture. Frozen broccoli works well in dishes like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/frozen-foods>frozen food recipes</a>, but fresh is ideal for crispier results.</p>  

<h3>Common Recipes Using 2.75 Cups of Broccoli</h3>  
<p>This measurement is perfect for serving 2–3 people in dishes like garlic parmesan broccoli or air-fried stir-fry. Since 220 grams of broccoli cooks quickly in an air fryer (usually 8–10 minutes at 190°C), it's great for weeknight meals. Pair it with proteins like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>air-fried chicken</a> for a balanced dinner.</p>  

<h2>Tips for Cooking Broccoli in Your Air Fryer</h2>  
<p>To get the best texture from your 220 grams (2.75 cups) of broccoli, toss it lightly in oil and seasonings before air frying. Avoid overcrowding the basket—cook in batches if needed. For easy cleanup, consider using <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer liners</a> to prevent sticking.</p>  

<p>Broccoli cooks faster in an air fryer than in an oven, so check it at the 6-minute mark to prevent burning. Shake the basket halfway through for even crisping. Whether you're making a side or main dish, this versatile veggie shines with minimal effort.</p>

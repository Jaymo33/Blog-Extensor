<p>4 tablespoons of crushed garlic equals approximately 48 grams. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements can make or break a dish. Whether you're whipping up garlic-infused chicken or a flavourful vegetable stir-fry, knowing the exact weight ensures consistency. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we emphasise accuracy to help you achieve restaurant-quality results at home. Keep reading for tips on measuring garlic and adapting recipes for your air fryer.</p>

<h2>Why accurate garlic measurements matter</h2>  
<p>Garlic is a powerhouse ingredient that can dominate a dish if overused. In air fryer cooking, where flavours intensify due to rapid air circulation, precise measurements are crucial. Too much garlic can overwhelm, while too little might leave your meal tasting bland. For example, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>garlic butter shrimp recipe</a> relies on the perfect 4 tbsp (48g) ratio for balanced flavour. This measurement also ensures even cooking, as larger chunks may burn before the dish is done.</p>  

<p>Crushed garlic differs from minced or chopped in density, which affects volume-to-weight conversions. That's why we specify crushed garlic in this guide—it's the most common form used in UK air fryer recipes. If you're substituting minced garlic, note that it packs more tightly, so 4 tbsp would weigh slightly more. Always refer to a reliable <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a> when adapting recipes between measurement types.</p>

<h3>How to measure crushed garlic correctly</h3>  
<p>For the most accurate 4 tbsp measurement, use the spoon-and-level method. Gently spoon crushed garlic into your tablespoon without packing it down, then level off the top with a knife. Avoid tapping the spoon, as this compresses the garlic and leads to inconsistent weights. If your recipe calls for 48g but you only have whole cloves, about 12 medium cloves (peeled) will yield the right amount when crushed.</p>

<h2>Adapting recipes for your air fryer</h2>  
<p>Many traditional recipes list garlic in tablespoons rather than grams, making conversions like 4 tbsp crushed garlic to grams invaluable for air fryer users. The concentrated heat of air frying means flavours like garlic become more pronounced. In dishes like our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>garlic chicken thighs</a>, the 48g measurement creates a robust but not overpowering garlic presence. Remember that air fryers cook faster than conventional ovens, so evenly distributed garlic ensures consistent flavouring throughout.</p>  

<p>When scaling recipes up or down, maintain the garlic-to-other-ingredients ratio. For instance, if doubling a recipe that calls for 2 tbsp (24g) garlic, use 4 tbsp (48g) rather than estimating. This precision becomes especially important in marinades and rubs, where garlic acts as both flavouring and tenderiser. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning guide</a> also recommends measuring garlic carefully to prevent excessive residue that can linger in your appliance.</p>

<h3>Common garlic measurement mistakes</h3>  
<p>One frequent error is assuming all garlic forms weigh the same. As mentioned, 4 tbsp of crushed garlic equals 48g, but the same volume of garlic paste might weigh 60g due to higher density. Another pitfall is using heaped tablespoons—a heaped tbsp of crushed garlic can contain up to 20% more by weight, throwing off your recipe's balance. Always use level measurements unless specified otherwise.</p>

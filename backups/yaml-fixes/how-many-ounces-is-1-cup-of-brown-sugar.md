<p>One cup of brown sugar weighs approximately 7.5 ounces (213 grams). This measurement is essential for baking and air frying, ensuring your recipes turn out perfectly every time. Whether you're making cookies, cakes, or even air-fried desserts, knowing the exact weight of brown sugar helps maintain consistency. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we understand the importance of accurate conversions for flawless results.</p>  

<h2>Why measuring brown sugar correctly matters</h2>  
<p>Brown sugar has a unique texture due to its molasses content, which makes it denser than granulated sugar. This means 1 cup of brown sugar to ounces isn’t the same as other sugars. Packing it too tightly or too loosely can throw off your recipe. For air fryer desserts like sticky toffee pudding or cinnamon rolls, precise measurements ensure the right sweetness and texture. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more handy baking tips.</p>  

<p>Many UK bakers wonder if 1 cup of brown sugar in ounces differs from US measurements. The answer is no—1 cup equals roughly 7.5 ounces in both systems. However, using a kitchen scale eliminates guesswork, especially for air fryer recipes where even small deviations can affect cooking times. Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipes</a> section for delicious ideas that rely on perfect measurements.</p>  

<h3>How to measure brown sugar without a scale</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a scale, spoon the brown sugar into a measuring cup and level it off with a knife. Avoid packing it down unless the recipe specifies "firmly packed." For air fryer baking, consistency is key—whether you’re making brownies or glazed carrots. A properly measured cup ensures your dish isn’t overly sweet or dry. Need cleaning tips for sticky sugar residue? Try our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner</a> guide.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for brown sugar in air fryers</h2>  
<p>Brown sugar isn’t just for baking—it’s fantastic in air fryer savoury dishes too. A sprinkle over bacon or a glaze for salmon adds depth and caramelisation. Since 1 cup brown sugar equals 7.5 ounces, you can easily adjust quantities for marinades or rubs. For inspiration, browse our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipes</a>, where brown sugar often stars in sticky sauces.</p>  

<p>Air fryers excel at caramelising sugars quickly, making them ideal for desserts like apple crisps or pecan pies. Knowing how many oz in 1 cup of brown sugar helps balance flavours without overpowering other ingredients. Whether you’re meal prepping or hosting, accurate measurements save time and stress. Visit <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> for more foolproof techniques.</p>  

<h3>Converting other sugar measurements</h3>  
<p>While 1 cup of brown sugar to oz is 7.5, granulated sugar weighs slightly less (7 ounces per cup). This difference matters in air fryer recipes, where moisture and density affect cooking. Always check whether your recipe calls for packed or loose brown sugar to avoid mishaps.

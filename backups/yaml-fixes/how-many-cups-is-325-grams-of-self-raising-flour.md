<p>325 grams of self-raising flour is roughly equivalent to 2.6 cups. This conversion is essential for baking, especially when using an air fryer where precise measurements matter. Whether you're whipping up cakes or bread, knowing how to convert grams to cups ensures your recipes turn out perfectly every time.</p>

<h2>Understanding Self-Raising Flour Measurements</h2>
<p>Self-raising flour is a staple in British baking, and getting the measurements right is crucial. When converting 325 grams of self-raising flour to cups, it's important to note that the density of flour can vary. However, a general rule is that 1 cup of self-raising flour weighs around 125 grams. This means 325 grams of self-raising flour is approximately 2.6 cups.</p>
<p>For those using an air fryer, accurate measurements are even more critical. Air fryers cook food faster and more evenly, so having the right amount of flour ensures your baked goods rise properly. If you're unsure, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more handy tips.</p>

<h3>Why Accuracy Matters in Baking</h3>
<p>Baking is a science, and even small deviations in measurements can affect the outcome. Too much or too little self-raising flour can lead to dense or flat cakes. Using 325 grams of self-raising flour (or 2.6 cups) ensures your recipes have the right balance of ingredients for perfect results.</p>

<h2>Converting 325 Grams of Self-Raising Flour to Cups</h2>
<p>Converting grams to cups isn't always straightforward, as different ingredients have varying densities. For self-raising flour, 325 grams translates to about 2.6 cups. This measurement is based on the standard UK cup size, which holds 250ml of liquid. If you're using a US cup, the measurement might differ slightly.</p>
<p>To make things easier, consider investing in a kitchen scale for precise measurements. Alternatively, you can use our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe section</a> for tried-and-tested conversions and baking tips.</p>

<h3>Tips for Measuring Self-Raising Flour</h3>

Whether you're making cakes, muffins, or bread, 325 grams of self-raising flour (or 2.6 cups) is a common measurement in many recipes. The hot, circulating air in an air fryer helps baked goods rise evenly, so getting the flour amount right is key.</p>

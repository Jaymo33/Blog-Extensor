<p>685 ml of lemon juice is approximately 2.9 cups. This conversion is essential for baking, cooking, or preparing air fryer recipes that require precise measurements. Whether you're making a zesty lemon drizzle cake or a tangy marinade, knowing how to convert millilitres to cups ensures your dish turns out perfectly every time.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter</h2>
<p>Precision is key when working with lemon juice, especially in recipes where acidity affects texture and taste. Too much or too little can alter the outcome of your dish. For air fryer recipes, like lemon-infused chicken or citrus-glazed salmon, the right balance ensures even cooking and optimal flavour. Visit <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes</a> for inspiration on how to use lemon juice in your air fryer creations.</p>
<p>Using 685 ml of lemon juice in cups (2.9 cups) helps standardise measurements across recipes. This is particularly useful if you're adapting a recipe from metric to imperial units or vice versa. A handy <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a> can save time and avoid kitchen mishaps.</p>

<h2>How to Measure 685 ml of Lemon Juice</h2>
<p>To measure 685 ml of lemon juice accurately, use a liquid measuring cup with clear metric and imperial markings. Fill it to the 685 ml line, or measure 2.9 cups if using imperial units. For smaller quantities, a tablespoon or teaspoon can help fine-tune the measurement. Freshly squeezed lemon juice is best for flavour, but bottled works in a pinch.</p>
<p>If you're scaling a recipe up or down, remember that 685 ml of lemon juice equals roughly 2.9 cups. This conversion is handy for batch cooking or meal prep, like marinating chicken for <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>air fryer chicken recipes</a>. Always taste as you go to adjust acidity levels.</p>

<h3>US vs. UK Cup Measurements</h3>
<p>Note that US and UK cup measurements differ slightly. In the UK, 1 cup is 284 ml, while in the US, it's 240 ml. For 685 ml of lemon juice, this translates to 2.9 US cups or 2.4 UK cups. Double-check your recipe's origin to avoid discrepancies.</p>

<h2>Common Uses for 685 ml of Lemon Juice</h2>
<p>685 ml of lemon juice (2.9 cups) is ideal for large-batch recipes like lemon curd, salad dressings, or marinades. In the air fryer, it works wonders for glazing vegetables or adding zest to <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>desserts</a>. Its acidity also helps tenderise meats, making it a versatile kitchen staple.</p>
<p>For cleaning your air fryer, a diluted lemon juice solution can remove grease and odours. Check out <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner</a> for natural cleaning tips. Always rinse thoroughly after use to avoid residual acidity affecting future cooks.</p>

<h3>Storing Leftover Lemon Juice</h3>
<p>If you don’t use all 685 ml of lemon juice at once, store it in an airtight container in the fridge for up to a week. Freezing in ice cube trays is another great way to preserve freshness for future recipes.</p>

<p>50g of rice equals approximately 1.76 ounces. This conversion is essential for precise air fryer cooking, ensuring your recipes turn out perfectly every time. Whether you're meal prepping or cooking a quick side dish, knowing how many ounces 50g of rice is can make all the difference. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we’re here to help you master these conversions for effortless cooking.</p>

<h2>Why convert 50g of rice to ounces?</h2>  
<p>Converting 50g of rice to ounces is crucial for accurate measurements, especially when using an air fryer. Many UK recipes use grams, but some kitchen scales or older cookbooks might list ounces. Knowing that 50g of rice is roughly 1.76 ounces ensures you never over or under-measure. This precision is key for dishes like air-fried rice cakes or crispy rice snacks, where portion size affects cooking time and texture.</p>  
<p>If you’re using an air fryer, precise measurements like 50g of rice to ounces help maintain consistency. For example, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> often call for specific weights to ensure even cooking. Whether you’re making a small batch or scaling up, converting 50g of rice to ounces simplifies the process. Plus, it’s handy for comparing portion sizes across different recipes or meal plans.</p>  

<h2>How to measure 50g of rice in ounces</h2>  
<p>Measuring 50g of rice in ounces is straightforward with a kitchen scale. Simply set your scale to grams, weigh out 50g, and note the equivalent in ounces (1.76 oz). If you don’t have a scale, use a measuring cup: 50g of uncooked rice is roughly ¼ cup, which translates to just under 2 ounces. This method works well for most rice types, from basmati to jasmine.</p>  

<h3>Using 50g of rice in air fryer recipes</h3>  
<p>50g of rice (1.76 oz) is a versatile portion for air fryer cooking. It’s ideal for single servings of crispy rice dishes or as a base for stir-fries. For example, try our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable rice bowls</a>, where 50g of rice pairs perfectly with air-fried veggies. The air fryer’s even heat distribution ensures fluffy, perfectly cooked rice every time.</p>  

<h2>Common questions about 50g rice to ounces</h2>  
<p>Many cooks wonder if the type of rice affects the 50g to ounces conversion. The answer is no—50g of any rice variety (white, brown, or wild) still equals 1.76 ounces. However, cooked rice will weigh more due to absorbed water. For air fryer recipes, we recommend using uncooked rice measurements like 50g for consistent results. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more handy tips.</p>  
<p>Another frequent question is whether 50g of rice is enough for a meal. While 50g (1.76 oz) of uncooked rice yields about 150g cooked, it’s perfect for a light lunch or side dish. For heartier meals, pair it with proteins or veggies from our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipes</a>. The air fryer makes it easy to cook everything together for a fuss-free dinner.</p>  

<h3>Tips for cooking 50g of rice in the air fryer</h3>  
<p>To cook 50g of rice in the air fryer, rinse it first to remove excess starch. Add the rice to a heatproof dish with 100ml of water (a 1:2 rice-to-water ratio works best). Cook at 180°C for 15–20 minutes, stirring halfway. This method ensures fluffy rice without the need for a stove.

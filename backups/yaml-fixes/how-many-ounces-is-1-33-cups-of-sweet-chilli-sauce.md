<p>1.33 cups of sweet chilli sauce equals approximately 10.64 ounces. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements can make or break a dish. Whether you're marinating chicken or drizzling sauce over crispy tofu, knowing the exact weight ensures consistent results. For more air fryer measurement tips, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on even heat distribution, and incorrect sauce quantities can lead to soggy or unevenly cooked food. Sweet chilli sauce, with its sticky consistency, needs careful measuring to avoid overpowering flavours or messy spills. A precise 1.33 cups to ounces conversion helps maintain the perfect balance in recipes like sticky wings or glazed salmon. Visit <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> for perfectly measured sweet chilli sauce recipes.</p>  

<p>Many UK cooks find cup measurements confusing, especially when dealing with thick sauces. Converting 1.33 cups of sweet chilli sauce to ounces (10.64 oz) provides a more reliable weight-based measurement. This is particularly useful when scaling recipes up or down for different air fryer basket sizes.</p>  

<h3>How to measure sweet chilli sauce correctly</h3>  
<p>For the most accurate 1.33 cups sweet chilli sauce to ounces conversion, use a liquid measuring cup on a flat surface. Pour slowly until the meniscus reaches the 1 1/3 cup mark, then weigh for confirmation. Thicker sauces may require gentle stirring to eliminate air pockets that can affect volume measurements.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for 1.33 cups of sweet chilli sauce</h2>  
<p>This quantity perfectly coats 500g of chicken wings in the air fryer or serves as a base for 4-6 portions of sweet chilli glazed vegetables. The 10.64-ounce measurement also works well in marinades for <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>air fryer chicken recipes</a>, providing enough sauce for thorough coating without waste.</p>  

<p>When making dipping sauces, 1.33 cups (10.64 oz) of sweet chilli sauce combines beautifully with 1/2 cup Greek yogurt for a crowd-pleasing accompaniment. This measurement scales perfectly for meal prep, storing well in <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer-safe containers</a> throughout the week.</p>  

<h3>Converting between US and UK measurements</h3>  
<p>While 1.33 cups converts to 10.64 US fluid ounces, UK cooks should note that imperial fluid ounces differ slightly. For absolute precision in UK air fryers, use a digital scale set to ounces rather than relying solely on cup conversions, especially with viscous ingredients like sweet chilli sauce.</p>  

<h2>Adjusting air fryer recipes with sweet chilli sauce</h2>  
<p>Knowing that 1.33 cups equals 10.64 ounces helps modify cooking times. Thicker coatings may require slightly longer air frying at lower temperatures to prevent burning. For perfect results, browse our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>sweet chilli sauce recipe collection</a> with tested air fryer timings.</p>

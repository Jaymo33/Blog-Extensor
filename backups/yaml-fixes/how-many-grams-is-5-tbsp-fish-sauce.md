<p>5 tablespoons of fish sauce equals approximately 75 grams. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements can make or break a dish. Whether you're marinating chicken or seasoning shrimp, knowing the exact weight ensures consistent flavour. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we help simplify these conversions for hassle-free cooking. Keep reading for more details on measuring fish sauce and its uses in air frying.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on even heat distribution, so ingredient proportions must be spot-on. Too much fish sauce can overpower a dish, while too little may leave it bland. For recipes like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>air fryer chicken</a>, 5 tbsp of fish sauce (75g) adds the perfect umami kick. Unlike ovens, air fryers cook faster, so imbalances in seasoning are more noticeable. Precise grams help replicate restaurant-quality results at home.</p>  

<p>Fish sauce is a staple in Asian-inspired air fryer dishes, from glazes to marinades. If you're preparing <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer shrimp</a>, 5 tbsp (75g) balances saltiness and depth. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a> simplifies switching between volume and weight. Remember, thicker sauces may vary slightly, but 75g is a reliable benchmark. Always level your tablespoons for consistency.</p>  

<h3>How to measure fish sauce correctly</h3>  
<p>Use a liquid measuring spoon for tablespoons, not a dinner spoon. Pour fish sauce to the brim, then level it off with a knife. For sticky sauces, lightly grease the spoon first. If your recipe calls for 5 tbsp of fish sauce (75g), a kitchen scale removes guesswork. Check our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning guide</a> to avoid lingering odours after measuring strong sauces.</p>  

<h2>Common recipes using 5 tbsp of fish sauce</h2>  
<p>Many air fryer favourites, like Vietnamese-style wings or Thai turkey lettuce wraps, use this quantity. For <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>air fryer vegetables</a>, dilute 5 tbsp (75g) with lime juice for a dipping sauce. The high salt content means you’ll rarely need more than 75g per batch. Pair it with sugar or honey in marinades to caramelise beautifully under the air fryer’s heat.</p>  

<p>Fish sauce also elevates <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/beef>air fryer beef</a> dishes—think 5 tbsp (75g) in a Korean bulgogi marinade. Since air fryers intensify flavours, start with slightly less and adjust. Visit <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> for recipes tailored to these measurements. Pro tip: Store opened fish sauce in the fridge to maintain its potency for future use.</p>  

<h3>Substitutes if you’re out of fish sauce</h3>  
<p>Soy sauce mixed with a pinch of sugar can mimic fish sauce’s savoury-sweet profile. For 5 tbsp (75g) fish sauce, use 4 tbsp soy sauce and 1 tbsp Worcestershire sauce. Note that substitutes may alter cooking times slightly in the air fryer. Always taste-test before committing to a full batch.</p>

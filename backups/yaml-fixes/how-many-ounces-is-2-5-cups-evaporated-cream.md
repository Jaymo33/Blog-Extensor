<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on even heat distribution, so ingredient quantities must be spot-on. Too much or too little evaporated cream can alter texture and cooking times. For example, a custard might turn out runny or overly thick if the measurement is off. That’s why converting 2.5 cups of evaporated cream to ounces (20 oz) is so helpful. It eliminates guesswork and ensures your dish turns out perfectly every time.</p>  
<p>If you're new to air fryer cooking, start with simple recipes like those found on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>our recipe page</a>. Many of these dishes use evaporated cream, so knowing the correct conversion will come in handy. From creamy pasta bakes to indulgent desserts, precise measurements are key.</p>  

<h3>How to measure evaporated cream correctly</h3>  
<p>Use a liquid measuring cup for accuracy when portioning 2.5 cups of evaporated cream. Fill to the brim and level off with a straight edge. If you’re using a kitchen scale, 20 ounces is your target weight. This method is especially useful for air fryer recipes where consistency matters. For more tips, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert category</a>, where evaporated cream is a star ingredient.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for evaporated cream in air fryer recipes</h2>

Converting 2.5 cups to ounces (20 oz) ensures you’re using the right amount for recipes like air-fried cheesecakes or creamy garlic chicken. The precise measurement helps maintain the dish’s integrity and flavour balance.</p>

<p>4 tablespoons of tomato paste equals approximately 60 grams. This conversion is essential for precise cooking, especially when using an air fryer, where ingredient ratios can affect texture and cooking times. Whether you're making a rich pasta sauce or a marinade, knowing the exact weight ensures consistency. For more air fryer measurement tips, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on hot air circulation to cook food evenly, so ingredient proportions can make or break a dish. Too much tomato paste, for example, might make a sauce overly thick or sticky. Conversely, too little could leave your dish lacking depth of flavour. That’s why converting 4 tbsp of tomato paste to grams (60g) is so useful—it takes the guesswork out of cooking. For recipe ideas, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a>.</p>  

<p>Tomato paste is a concentrated ingredient, so even small variations in quantity can have a big impact. If you’re adapting a traditional recipe for the air fryer, precise measurements ensure the dish turns out just right. Plus, grams are a more reliable unit than tablespoons, as scoop sizes can vary.

<h3>How to measure tomato paste without scales</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a kitchen scale, you can still measure 4 tbsp of tomato paste accurately. Use a standard tablespoon (15ml) and level it off with a knife for consistency. Remember, 4 tbsp equals 60 grams, so you can adjust quantities as needed. For more measurement hacks, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion guide</a>.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for tomato paste in air fryer recipes</h2>  
<p>Tomato paste adds depth to sauces, marinades, and even rubs for meats cooked in the air fryer. A precise 60g (4 tbsp) portion can enhance dishes like air-fried meatballs, stuffed peppers, or homemade pizza. For inspiration, browse our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable-based recipes</a> featuring tomato paste.</p>  

<p>Because tomato paste is so concentrated, it’s perfect for adding umami richness without excess moisture, which is ideal for air frying. Whether you’re making a quick pasta sauce or a glaze for chicken, knowing that 4 tbsp equals 60 grams helps streamline your prep.

<h3>Storing leftover tomato paste</h3>  
<p>If you’ve measured out 60g (4 tbsp) but only need half, store the rest in an airtight container in the fridge for up to a week. Alternatively, freeze tablespoon-sized portions for future use—handy for quick air fryer meals.

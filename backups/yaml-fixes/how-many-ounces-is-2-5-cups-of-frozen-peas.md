<p>2.5 cups of frozen peas weigh approximately 10.6 ounces (300 grams). This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes, ensuring precise measurements for even cooking. Whether you’re making a quick side dish or adding peas to a larger meal, knowing the weight helps avoid under or overloading your air fryer basket.</p>

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air frying</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on hot air circulation to cook food evenly, so overcrowding or underfilling the basket can lead to inconsistent results. Measuring 2.5 cups of frozen peas in ounces ensures you’re using the right quantity for optimal air flow. Frozen peas are a versatile ingredient, perfect for air fryer recipes like pea fritters or as a side to <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable-based dishes</a>.</p>  
<p>For those who prefer weight over volume, 10.6 ounces (300 grams) of frozen peas is the equivalent of 2.5 cups. This measurement is particularly useful when scaling recipes or adjusting portion sizes. If you’re unsure about conversions, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> can help simplify the process.</p>  

<h2>How to measure frozen peas for air frying</h2>  
<p>When measuring 2.5 cups of frozen peas, it’s best to use a dry measuring cup for accuracy. Lightly fill the cup without packing the peas down, then level off the top. If you’re using a kitchen scale, 10.6 ounces (300 grams) will give you the same quantity. This method ensures consistency, especially when following <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a>.</p>  

<h3>Tips for cooking frozen peas in an air fryer</h3>  
<p>Frozen peas cook quickly in an air fryer, usually in just 5–7 minutes at 180°C. Toss them with a little oil and seasoning for extra flavour. Avoid overcooking, as they can become mushy. For best results, shake the basket halfway through cooking to ensure even browning.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for 2.5 cups of frozen peas</h2>  
<p>2.5 cups (10.6 ounces) of frozen peas are ideal for making pea soups, adding to stir-fries, or creating air-fried pea croquettes. They’re also a great addition to <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/meal-prep>meal prep dishes</a>, as they retain their texture and nutrients when cooked properly. For a crispy snack, try air-frying them with a light coating of oil and salt.</p>  
<p>If you’re batch cooking, remember that 2.5 cups of frozen peas will yield roughly 4 servings as a side dish. Always check your air fryer’s capacity to avoid overcrowding. For more tips on maintaining your appliance, see our guide on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning your air fryer</a>.</p>  

<h3>Storing leftover frozen peas</h3>  
<p>If you don’t use all 2.5 cups of frozen peas, store them in an airtight container in the freezer. They’ll keep for up to 6 months. When reheating in the air fryer, spread them evenly in the basket to prevent clumping.</p>

<p>2 tablespoons (tbsp) of mayonnaise weigh approximately 30 grams. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements can make all the difference. Whether you're making crispy chicken or a quick mayo-based dip, knowing the exact weight ensures consistent results every time.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate mayonnaise measurements matter</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of mayonnaise in your air fryer recipes can affect texture, moisture, and even cooking time. Too much mayo can make food greasy, while too little might leave it dry. For dishes like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>air fryer chicken</a>, a precise 30-gram measure ensures perfect crispiness without excess oil.</p>  

<p>Many UK cooks rely on volume measurements like tablespoons, but grams provide a more accurate standard. This is especially useful when scaling recipes up or down. If you're preparing a batch of <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer snacks</a>, converting 2 tbsp mayonnaise to grams helps maintain balance in flavours and textures.</p>  

<h3>How to measure 2 tbsp mayonnaise without scales</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a kitchen scale, you can still measure 2 tbsp of mayonnaise accurately. Use a standard UK tablespoon (15ml per tbsp) and level it off with a knife. For thicker mayo, gently press it into the spoon to avoid air gaps. This method gets you close to the 30-gram mark, though scales are always best for precision.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for 2 tbsp mayonnaise in air frying</h2>  
<p>Two tablespoons of mayonnaise (30g) are often used as a binder for coatings or a base for marinades. For example, mixing it with breadcrumbs for <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/frozen-foods>frozen food upgrades</a> adds crispiness while keeping moisture locked in. It’s also perfect for light dips or dressings to accompany air-fried veggies.</p>  

<p>Some recipes, like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion-heavy dishes</a>, require exact gram measurements to replicate successfully. Whether you're adapting a family favourite or trying a new creation, knowing that 2 tbsp equals 30 grams simplifies the process.</p>  

<h3>Does mayonnaise brand affect the weight?</h3>  
<p>Different brands of mayonnaise can vary slightly in density, but most full-fat varieties will hover around 30 grams for 2 tbsp. Light or low-fat versions might weigh less due to higher water content. Always check labels if precision is crucial, especially for <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>health-conscious recipes</a>.</p>  

<h2>Converting other mayonnaise amounts to grams</h2>  
<p>If your recipe calls for more or less mayonnaise, here’s a quick guide: 1 tbsp is about 15 grams, while ¼ cup (4 tbsp) weighs roughly 60 grams. These conversions are handy for scaling up batch cooks or adjusting single servings in your air fryer.</p>  

<p>For larger quantities, remember that 100 grams of mayonnaise equals roughly 6.5 tbsp. This is useful when preparing marinades or coatings for family-sized portions. Keep our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> bookmarked for more measurement tips and tricks.</p>

<p>20g of sesame oil is approximately 0.705 ounces. Whether you're preparing a marinade, dressing, or stir-fry in your air fryer, getting the measurements right is key to perfect results. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we know how important precision is, especially when working with oils like sesame, which can impact flavour and texture.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Using the correct amount of sesame oil ensures your dishes aren’t overly greasy or dry. Air fryers circulate hot air, so too much oil can lead to splattering, while too little may leave food undercooked. For recipes like crispy tofu or sesame-glazed salmon, 20g of sesame oil (0.705 oz) is often the sweet spot. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for other common ingredient conversions.</p>  

<p>Sesame oil adds a rich, nutty flavour to dishes, but its potency means a little goes a long way. If you’re adapting a recipe from grams to ounces, remember that 20g sesame oil to ounces is roughly 0.7 oz. This measurement is handy for drizzling over roasted vegetables or mixing into marinades for chicken or shrimp.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure 20g of Sesame Oil Without Scales</h3>  
<p>No kitchen scales? No problem. One tablespoon of sesame oil weighs about 14g, so 20g is just under 1.5 tablespoons. For smaller quantities, a teaspoon holds roughly 4.5g, meaning 20g equals 4.5 teaspoons. Precision matters, so if you’re serious about air fryer cooking, invest in a digital scale or use our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe guides</a> for foolproof measurements.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for 20g of Sesame Oil in Air Fryers</h2>  
<p>From marinades to dressings, 20g of sesame oil (0.705 oz) is a versatile quantity. Try it in a honey-sesame glaze for air-fried salmon or as a base for stir-fried vegetables. Its high smoke point makes it ideal for air frying, unlike lighter oils that may burn. For inspiration, browse our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipes</a>, where sesame oil often stars.</p>  

<p>Another great use is in meal prep—tossing 20g of sesame oil with tofu or mushrooms before air frying enhances their flavour. Just remember: 20 grams of sesame oil to oz is 0.705, so adjust batch sizes accordingly. Too much oil can make food soggy, defeating the air fryer’s crispiness.</p>  

<h3>Storing Sesame Oil for Optimal Freshness</h3>  
<p>To keep sesame oil fresh, store it in a cool, dark place. Once opened, use it within 6 months for the best flavour. If your oil smells rancid, it’s time to replace it—check our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning tips</a> to avoid lingering odours in your air fryer. Proper storage ensures your 20g measurements deliver consistent results every time.</p>

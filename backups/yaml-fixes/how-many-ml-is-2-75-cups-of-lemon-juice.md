<p>2.75 cups of lemon juice equals approximately 650 ml. This conversion is essential for precise baking and cooking, especially when using an air fryer where exact measurements can affect texture and flavour. Whether you're making a zesty lemon drizzle cake or a tangy marinade, knowing how to convert cups to millilitres ensures consistency in your recipes.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on precise ingredient ratios to achieve the perfect crispiness and even cooking. Too much or too little liquid, like lemon juice, can alter the outcome of your dish. For example, a marinade with 650 ml of lemon juice instead of the intended 2.75 cups could make your chicken overly acidic or dry. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more handy measurement tips.</p>  

<p>Many recipes on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> use millilitres for accuracy, especially in baking. If you're adapting a US recipe that lists lemon juice in cups, converting to ml ensures you stay on track. This is particularly useful for dishes like lemon-infused salmon or citrus-glazed shrimp, where balance is key.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure Lemon Juice Correctly</h3>  
<p>For the most accurate conversion, use a liquid measuring cup specifically designed for millilitres. Pour the lemon juice to the 650 ml mark rather than relying on cup measurements. If you're using freshly squeezed lemons, strain the juice to remove pulp before measuring. This ensures your <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipes</a> turn out as intended.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for 2.75 Cups (650 ml) of Lemon Juice</h2>  
<p>This quantity of lemon juice is perfect for large-batch recipes. You might use it for a family-sized lemon chicken dish, a big jug of homemade lemonade, or multiple trays of lemon drizzle cupcakes. The air fryer excels at cooking citrus-marinated proteins like chicken or tofu, where 650 ml of lemon juice can tenderise and flavour four to six portions.</p>  

<p>For dessert lovers, 650 ml of lemon juice makes about two standard lemon tart fillings or one large lemon meringue pie. If you're meal prepping, this amount could also be divided into marinades for <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken</a> or <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/shrimp>shrimp</a> to use throughout the week. The versatility of lemon juice makes it a kitchen staple.</p>  

<h3>Adjusting Recipes for Different Lemon Juice Concentrations</h3>  
<p>If using bottled lemon juice instead of fresh, check the label as some brands are more concentrated. You may need to slightly reduce the quantity (about 10-15 ml less per cup) to account for intensity. Always taste-test your mixture before adding all 650 ml to ensure the flavour isn't overpowering.</p>

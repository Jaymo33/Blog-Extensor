<p>2 tablespoons (tbsp) of peanut butter weigh approximately 32 grams. This measurement is essential for air fryer recipes, ensuring consistency in texture and flavour. Whether you’re making peanut butter cookies or a savoury satay sauce, knowing the exact weight helps avoid kitchen mishaps. For more air fryer conversions, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on precise ingredient ratios to deliver crispy, evenly cooked results. Too much or too little peanut butter can alter the texture of your dish. For example, adding extra peanut butter to energy balls might make them overly dense. On the other hand, skimping on it in a satay sauce could leave it too runny. That’s why converting 2 tbsp of peanut butter to grams (32g) is so useful.</p>  
<p>If you’re meal prepping or scaling recipes, grams provide a more reliable measurement than volume. A digital kitchen scale is a must-have tool for air fryer enthusiasts. For more tips on perfecting your air fryer meals, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a>.</p>  

<h2>How to measure peanut butter for air fryer recipes</h2>  
<p>Measuring sticky ingredients like peanut butter can be tricky. For the most accurate results, use a spoon to scoop it into a measuring tablespoon, then level it off with a knife. Alternatively, weigh it directly on a digital scale for precision. If your recipe calls for 2 tbsp of peanut butter (32g), this method eliminates guesswork.</p>  

<h3>Using grams vs. tablespoons</h3>  
<p>Grams are more consistent than tablespoons because peanut butter’s density can vary based on brand or natural separation. For UK cooks, 2 tbsp of peanut butter equals 32 grams, regardless of whether it’s smooth or crunchy. This standardisation is especially helpful when adapting American recipes, which often use volume measurements.</p>  

<h2>Common air fryer recipes using 2 tbsp peanut butter</h2>  
<p>Peanut butter is a versatile ingredient in air fryer cooking. From sweet to savoury, here are some popular recipes where 2 tbsp (32g) of peanut butter shines. Try our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>peanut butter cookies</a> or a quick satay glaze for chicken skewers. The exact gram measurement ensures perfect results every time.</p>  
<p>Another great option is peanut butter-stuffed dates, a healthy snack that cooks beautifully in the air fryer. Just mix 2 tbsp (32g) of peanut butter with a pinch of salt, stuff into pitted dates, and air fry until crispy. For cleaning tips after sticky peanut butter recipes, visit our guide on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer maintenance</a>.</p>  

<h3>Adjusting recipes for different peanut butter types</h3>  
<p>Natural peanut butter tends to be runnier, while commercial brands are thicker due to added oils. However, 2 tbsp still equals roughly 32 grams in most cases. If your peanut butter is particularly oily, give it a stir before measuring to ensure consistency. This small step can make a big difference in recipes like air-fried peanut butter banana rolls.</p>  

<h2>Converting other peanut butter measurements</h2>  
<p>Need to scale up or down? Here’s a quick reference for peanut butter conversions: 1 tbsp = 16g, 3 tbsp = 48g, and ¼ cup = 64g. These conversions are handy for doubling batches of <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/breakfast>peanut butter granola</a> or adjusting sauce quantities.

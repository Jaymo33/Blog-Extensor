<p>560 ml of vegetable oil is approximately 2.37 cups in the US measurement system and roughly 2.46 cups in the UK. This conversion is essential for precise cooking, especially when using an air fryer where exact measurements can impact texture and crispiness. Whether you're following a recipe from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> or adapting a family favourite, knowing how to convert millilitres to cups ensures consistent results.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Frying</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on hot air circulation to cook food evenly, and the right amount of oil can make or break your dish. Too little oil, and your food may dry out; too much, and it can become greasy. Converting 560 ml of vegetable oil to cups helps maintain balance, especially for recipes like crispy chicken or roasted vegetables. For more air fryer tips, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a>.</p>  

<p>Many air fryer recipes, such as those in our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken category</a>, call for specific oil quantities to achieve the perfect crunch. Measuring 560 ml of vegetable oil accurately ensures your dishes turn out just right. If you're new to air frying, start with trusted recipes and adjust as you go.</p>  

<h3>US vs. UK Cup Measurements</h3>  
<p>It's important to note that US and UK cup measurements differ slightly. In the US, 1 cup equals 240 ml, while in the UK, it's 250 ml. This means 560 ml of vegetable oil converts to 2.37 US cups or 2.46 UK cups. Always check which system your recipe uses to avoid mistakes.</p>  

<h2>How to Measure 560 ml of Vegetable Oil Without a Scale</h2>  
<p>If you don't have a measuring jug, you can use standard cups to measure 560 ml of vegetable oil. For US cups, fill 2 cups completely and add about a third of another cup. For UK cups, fill 2 cups and add just under half of another. This method works well for most <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a>.</p>  

<p>Another handy trick is to use a tablespoon for smaller adjustments. Since 1 US tablespoon holds 15 ml, you can fine-tune your measurement if needed. For example, 560 ml equals roughly 37 tablespoons in the US system. This precision is especially useful for baking recipes in your air fryer.</p>  

<h3>Common Uses for 560 ml of Vegetable Oil</h3>  
<p>560 ml of vegetable oil is often used for batch cooking or larger recipes. For instance, it's enough to coat several portions of air-fried potatoes or a whole chicken. If you're meal prepping, this quantity can save time. Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/meal-prep>meal prep section</a> for ideas.</p>  

<h2>Storing Leftover Vegetable Oil</h2>  
<p>If you don't use all 560 ml of vegetable oil at once, store it properly to maintain freshness. Keep it in a cool, dark place and avoid contamination by using clean utensils. For more tips on maintaining your air fryer, see our guide on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning and care</a>.</p>  

<p>Leftover oil can be reused a few times, but discard it if it becomes cloudy or develops an off smell. Always strain it after use to remove food particles. This practice not only saves money but also reduces waste, making your air frying more sustainable.</p>

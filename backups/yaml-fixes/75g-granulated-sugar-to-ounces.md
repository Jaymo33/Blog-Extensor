<p>75g of granulated sugar equals approximately 2.65 ounces. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements can make or break your dish. Whether you’re whipping up a cake or caramelising sugar for a dessert, knowing the exact weight ensures consistency. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we focus on accuracy to help you achieve perfect results every time.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate sugar measurements matter</h2>  
<p>Granulated sugar is a staple in many air fryer recipes, from cakes to glazes. Even a small discrepancy in weight can affect texture and taste. For example, too much sugar can make desserts overly sweet or cause uneven browning. Too little might leave your baked goods dry or lacking flavour. That’s why converting 75g of granulated sugar to ounces (2.65 oz) correctly is crucial for air fryer cooking.</p>  

<p>If you’re scaling a recipe up or down, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> can help. It covers common ingredient weights, including sugar, flour, and butter, so you never have to guess. Whether you’re making cookies or a crumble, precise measurements ensure your air fryer dishes turn out just right.</p>  

<h2>How to measure 75g of granulated sugar without scales</h2>  
<p>Not everyone has a kitchen scale, but you can still measure 75g of granulated sugar accurately. One UK tablespoon holds roughly 12.5g of granulated sugar, so 6 level tablespoons will give you 75g. Alternatively, a standard UK metric cup (250ml) filled with granulated sugar weighs about 200g, so 75g would be just over a third of a cup.</p>  

<h3>Using measuring spoons for precision</h3>  
<p>Measuring spoons are a handy tool for small quantities like 75g of granulated sugar. If you’re following an air fryer recipe from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>our collection</a>, double-check whether the recipe uses level or heaped measurements. Level measurements are more precise, especially for baking, where consistency is key.</p>  

<h2>Common air fryer recipes using 75g of granulated sugar</h2>  
<p>Many air fryer desserts call for around 75g of granulated sugar. For example, a small batch of air fryer cookies or a single-serving cake might use this amount. If you’re making a glaze or caramel, 75g is often the perfect quantity for a balanced sweetness. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>cake recipes</a> for inspiration.</p>  

<p>Granulated sugar also works well in savoury air fryer dishes, like glazed meats or roasted vegetables. A light sprinkle can enhance caramelisation without overpowering the dish. For more ideas, browse our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert section</a>, where precise sugar measurements are a must.</p>  

<h3>Adjusting recipes for different sugar types</h3>  
<p>If you’re substituting caster or brown sugar for granulated, note that their weights differ slightly. Caster sugar is finer, so 75g will take up slightly less volume, while brown sugar is denser. Always weigh sugar for the most accurate results, especially in air fryer baking where even heating is crucial.</p>  

<h2>Tips for storing granulated sugar</h2>  
<p>To keep your granulated sugar fresh, store it in an airtight container in a cool, dry place. Moisture can cause clumping, which makes measuring 75g accurately more difficult. If your sugar has hardened, a quick blitz in a food processor can restore its texture. For more kitchen tips, visit <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>our cleaning guide</a> to keep your air fryer in top condition.</p>  

<p>Proper storage ensures your sugar stays free-flowing, making it easier to measure 75g for your next air fryer recipe. Whether you’re baking or cooking, precise ingredients lead to better results, so always double-check your conversions.</p>

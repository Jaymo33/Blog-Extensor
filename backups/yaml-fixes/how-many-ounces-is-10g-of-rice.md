<p>10g of rice equals approximately 0.35 ounces. This conversion is essential for air fryer cooking, where precise measurements can make all the difference. Whether you’re meal prepping or following a recipe, knowing how to convert grams to ounces ensures consistent results. For more handy conversions, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>  

<h2>Why converting grams to ounces matters</h2>  
<p>Accurate measurements are crucial when cooking with an air fryer, especially for ingredients like rice. Too much or too little can affect texture and cooking times. Converting 10g of rice to ounces (0.35 oz) helps you follow recipes precisely, whether you’re making a side dish or a main course. Many UK recipes use grams, but some air fryer guides prefer ounces, so knowing both is handy. For more rice-based recipes, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetables category</a>.</p>  

<h3>How to measure 10g of rice without scales</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a kitchen scale, you can estimate 10g of rice using a tablespoon. One level tablespoon of uncooked rice is roughly 10g or 0.35 ounces. This method isn’t as precise as weighing, but it works in a pinch. For best results, invest in a digital scale for your air fryer cooking. You’ll find more tips like this on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for 10g of rice in air fryer recipes</h2>  
<p>10g of rice might seem small, but it’s perfect for single servings or as part of a larger dish. Try it in air fryer stuffed peppers or as a base for grain bowls. The 0.35-ounce portion is ideal for controlling calories while still enjoying a satisfying meal. For inspiration, browse our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a>.</p>  

<h3>Does rice type affect the weight conversion?</h3>  
<p>Different rice varieties, like basmati or jasmine, have slightly different densities, but the 10g-to-0.35-ounce conversion remains consistent. The key is to measure uncooked rice, as cooked rice weighs more due to absorbed water. Always refer to your air fryer’s manual for specific rice-cooking guidelines.

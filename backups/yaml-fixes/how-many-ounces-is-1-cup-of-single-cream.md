<h3>How to measure single cream without a scale</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a kitchen scale, use a liquid measuring cup for single cream. Fill it to the 240 ml mark, which equals 1 cup or 8.45 ounces.

Always level off the top for the most accurate results.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for single cream in air fryer recipes</h2>  
<p>Single cream is versatile, perfect for both sweet and savoury air fryer dishes. It’s ideal for making custards, creamy pasta sauces, or even <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>cakes</a>.

Always check specific conversions for the cream type you’re using. This ensures your air fryer recipes turn out as intended, whether you’re baking or making sauces.</p>

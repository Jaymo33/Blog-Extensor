<p>360 ml of double cream is approximately 1.5 cups in standard US measurements or 1.25 cups in UK metric measurements. Whether you're whipping up a dessert or adding richness to a sauce, knowing this conversion ensures your recipes turn out perfectly every time. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we understand how crucial precise measurements are, especially when using an air fryer for delicate dishes.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter</h2>
<p>Using the right amount of double cream can make or break a recipe. Too little, and your dish might lack richness; too much, and it could become overly heavy or soggy. For air fryer recipes, precision is key because the cooking process is faster and more intense than conventional methods. A slight mismeasurement can lead to undercooked or burnt results. That’s why we always recommend using a kitchen scale or measuring jug for liquids like double cream.</p>
<p>If you're working with air fryer desserts, such as cakes or custards, the 360 ml to cups conversion becomes even more critical. Double cream adds moisture and fat, which affects texture and cooking time. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for other common measurement conversions to streamline your cooking process.</p>

<h2>UK vs. US Cup Measurements</h2>
<p>It’s important to note that cup sizes differ between the UK and the US. A US cup holds 240 ml, while a UK metric cup is slightly larger at 250 ml. This means 360 ml of double cream equals 1.5 US cups or 1.25 UK cups. For air fryer recipes, especially those from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>our collection</a>, we typically use UK measurements unless stated otherwise.</p>
<p>If you’re following an American recipe, adjust accordingly to avoid discrepancies. Many baking recipes, including those for air fryers, rely on precise ratios of wet to dry ingredients. A small variation in double cream quantity can alter the final product’s consistency, so always double-check your conversions.</p>

<h3>How to Measure Double Cream Without a Scale</h3>
<p>If you don’t have a kitchen scale, use a liquid measuring jug for accuracy. Pour the double cream up to the 360 ml mark, then transfer it to cups as needed. For thicker creams like double cream, avoid scooping with a dry measuring cup, as it can trap air and lead to inaccurate measurements. Instead, spoon the cream gently into the cup and level it off with a knife.</p>

<h2>Common Uses for 360 ml of Double Cream</h2>
<p>Double cream is a versatile ingredient in both sweet and savoury dishes. In air fryer cooking, it’s often used for creamy sauces, custards, or even as a topping for desserts. For example, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert recipes</a> frequently call for 360 ml of double cream to create rich, velvety textures. It’s also perfect for whipping into stiff peaks for cakes or mousses.</p>
<p>In savoury dishes, 360 ml of double cream can be reduced into a luxurious sauce for pasta or meat. When using an air fryer, remember that dairy-based sauces may require shorter cooking times to prevent curdling. Always preheat your air fryer and monitor the dish closely to achieve the best results.</p>

<h3>Storing Leftover Double Cream</h3>
<p>If you have leftover double cream, store it in an airtight container in the fridge for up to three days. You can also freeze it for longer storage, though the texture may change slightly upon thawing. For best results, use frozen double cream in cooked dishes rather than whipped applications.</p>

<h2>Tips for Cooking with Double Cream in an Air Fryer</h2>
<p>When using double cream in air fryer recipes, avoid overfilling the cooking basket to prevent spills. Cream-based dishes can bubble over, creating a mess and potentially damaging your appliance. For easy cleanup, consider using <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer liners</a> or parchment paper to catch drips.</p>
<p>Another tip is to preheat your air fryer before adding cream-based dishes. This ensures even cooking and reduces the risk of curdling. If you’re making a sauce, stir it occasionally during cooking to maintain a smooth consistency. With these tricks, you’ll master air fryer recipes featuring 360 ml of double cream in no time.</p>

<p>30g of minced garlic equals approximately 1.06 ounces. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements can make or break a dish. Whether you’re whipping up garlic butter shrimp or a fragrant stir-fry, knowing the exact weight ensures consistency. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we emphasise accuracy to help you nail every recipe.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Using the correct amount of minced garlic ensures your dish isn’t overpowering or bland. Air fryers cook food quickly, so balancing flavours is crucial. Too much garlic can burn, while too little might leave your meal lacking depth. For perfect results, stick to the 30g minced garlic to ounces conversion (1.06 oz). Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more handy tips.</p>  

<p>Many UK cooks prefer weighing ingredients for precision, especially with potent flavours like garlic. A digital kitchen scale is a must for air fryer enthusiasts. If you’re adapting a recipe from grams to ounces, this conversion ensures you stay on track. Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>garlic-heavy recipes</a> for inspiration.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure Minced Garlic Without a Scale</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a scale, 30g of minced garlic is roughly two tablespoons. However, this can vary based on how finely the garlic is chopped. For air fryer dishes, we recommend weighing for consistency. Pre-minced garlic from jars often has added moisture, so adjust accordingly. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable recipes</a> often feature garlic as a star ingredient.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for 30g of Minced Garlic</h2>  
<p>This amount is perfect for marinades, sauces, or seasoning proteins like chicken or shrimp. In the air fryer, minced garlic caramelises beautifully, adding depth to roasted veggies or meats. Try it in our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>garlic butter salmon recipe</a> for a quick, flavourful dinner. Remember, 30 grams of minced garlic in ounces is 1.06 oz—measure carefully!</p>  

<p>Garlic’s potency means a little goes a long way, especially in confined cooking spaces like an air fryer. For cleaning tips after cooking with garlic, visit our guide on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer maintenance</a>. Proper care ensures your appliance stays odour-free and ready for the next recipe.</p>  

<h3>Converting Other Garlic Measurements</h3>  
<p>If a recipe calls for cloves instead of grams, one medium clove yields about 5g. So, 30g of minced garlic equals roughly six cloves. This conversion helps when switching between fresh and pre-minced garlic.

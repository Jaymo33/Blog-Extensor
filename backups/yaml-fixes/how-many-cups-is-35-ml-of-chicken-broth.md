<p>35 ml of chicken broth equals approximately 0.15 cups (or roughly 1/8 cup plus 1 teaspoon). This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise liquid measurements can make or break a dish. Whether you're making a marinade, sauce, or soup, knowing how to convert millilitres to cups ensures consistent results every time.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on precise ingredient ratios to achieve the perfect texture and flavour. Too much liquid, like chicken broth, can lead to soggy results, while too little might dry out your dish. For example, when making a <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>chicken-based air fryer recipe</a>, 35 ml of broth might be used to keep the meat moist without over-saturating it. Always measure liquids carefully to avoid common pitfalls.</p>  

<p>Many air fryer enthusiasts use chicken broth to add depth to dishes like roasted vegetables or marinated proteins. If you're working with a recipe that calls for 35 ml, knowing the cup equivalent helps streamline your prep. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more handy measurement swaps.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure 35 ml of Chicken Broth Without a Scale</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a measuring jug with millilitre markings, use standard kitchen spoons. One tablespoon holds about 15 ml, so 35 ml is just over 2 tablespoons (30 ml) plus 1 teaspoon (5 ml). For recipes requiring exact amounts, like a <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken dish</a>, this method ensures accuracy without specialised tools.</p>  

<h2>Converting 35 ml of Chicken Broth for Different Recipes</h2>  
<p>Whether you're baking, sautéing, or air frying, 35 ml of chicken broth can enhance flavour without overwhelming other ingredients. In baking, it might replace oil or water for a richer taste. For air fryer meals, it’s often used to baste meats or deglaze a pan. Always adjust seasonings accordingly, as broth adds saltiness.</p>  

<p>For frozen foods like pre-marinated chicken, 35 ml of broth can prevent drying during air frying. Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/frozen-foods>frozen food recipes</a> for inspiration. Remember, precise measurements like 35 ml to cups ensure your dish turns out as intended.</p>  

<h3>Common Uses for 35 ml of Chicken Broth in Air Fryers</h3>  
<p>This small but mighty amount is perfect for light basting, creating pan sauces, or adding moisture to grains cooked in the air fryer. Try it in a marinade for tofu or drizzled over roasted potatoes. For more ideas, browse our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a>.</p>  

<h2>Tips for Storing Leftover Chicken Broth</h2>  
<p>After measuring out 35 ml, store the remaining broth in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 4 days. Freeze it in ice cube trays for future 35 ml portions—each cube is roughly 30 ml, making it easy to approximate. Always label containers with dates to avoid waste.</p>  

<p>Keep your air fryer in top condition between uses with our recommended <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning tips</a>. Proper maintenance ensures even cooking and prevents lingering odours from ingredients like chicken broth.</p>  

<h3>Scaling Recipes That Call for 35 ml of Chicken Broth</h3>  
<p>Doubling a recipe? 70 ml equals roughly 0.3 cups (or 1/4 cup plus 2 teaspoons). Halving it? 17.5 ml is about 1 tablespoon plus 1/2 teaspoon. Always use consistent units to avoid errors, especially when adapting recipes for the air fryer.</p>

<p>535 ml of evaporated milk is approximately 2.26 cups in US measurements or 2.11 cups in UK measurements. This conversion is essential for recipes, especially when using an air fryer for baking or cooking. Whether you're making a creamy dessert or a savoury dish, knowing the exact measurement ensures perfect results every time.</p>  

<h2>Understanding Evaporated Milk Measurements</h2>  
<p>Evaporated milk is thicker and richer than regular milk, making precise measurements crucial. If you're using 535 ml of evaporated milk in a recipe, it's important to know the exact cup equivalent. In the US, a standard cup holds 240 ml, while in the UK, it's 250 ml. This slight difference can affect your recipe, especially in baking where precision matters.</p>  

<p>For air fryer recipes, such as those found on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, accurate measurements ensure even cooking. Whether you're making a custard or a creamy pasta dish, converting 535 ml of evaporated milk to cups correctly guarantees consistency. Always use a measuring jug for liquids to avoid errors.</p>  

<h3>Why Accuracy Matters in Air Fryer Cooking</h3>  
<p>Air fryers circulate hot air rapidly, so ingredient ratios must be spot-on. Too much liquid, like evaporated milk, can lead to soggy results, while too little may dry out your dish. Measuring 535 ml of evaporated milk precisely ensures your recipe turns out as intended.</p>  

<h2>Converting 535 ml of Evaporated Milk to Cups</h2>  
<p>To convert 535 ml of evaporated milk to cups, divide the millilitres by the cup size in your region. For US cups (240 ml), 535 ÷ 240 = 2.26 cups. For UK cups (250 ml), 535 ÷ 250 = 2.11 cups. This simple calculation helps avoid guesswork and ensures recipe success.</p>  

<p>If you're adjusting a recipe from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, always double-check conversions. Many air fryer recipes rely on precise liquid measurements for optimal texture and flavour. Evaporated milk adds richness, so getting the amount right is key.</p>  

<h3>Common Recipes Using 535 ml of Evaporated Milk</h3>  
<p>Popular air fryer dishes like custards, cheesecakes, or creamy sauces often call for evaporated milk. For example, a <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert recipe</a> might require 535 ml to achieve the perfect consistency. Knowing the cup equivalent helps streamline preparation.</p>  

<h2>Tips for Measuring Evaporated Milk</h2>  
<p>Always shake the can of evaporated milk before measuring to ensure uniformity. Pour slowly into a measuring jug at eye level for accuracy. If your recipe calls for 535 ml of evaporated milk, use the correct cup size (US or UK) to avoid discrepancies.</p>

<p>No, you should never put cardboard in an air fryer. Cardboard is highly flammable and can catch fire when exposed to the high heat of an air fryer, which typically operates between 160°C and 200°C. Even small pieces or grease-soaked cardboard pose serious risks, from smoke damage to full-blown fires. Instead, opt for air fryer-safe liners or parchment paper designed for high temperatures. For more safe cooking tips, explore <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> that use proper materials.</p>  

<h2>Why Cardboard Is Dangerous in an Air Fryer</h2>  
<p>Cardboard is made from compressed paper fibres, which ignite at temperatures as low as 200°C—well within an air fryer’s range. Unlike oven-safe materials, cardboard lacks heat-resistant coatings, making it prone to smouldering or catching fire. Grease from food can saturate the cardboard, further increasing flammability. Even if it doesn’t ignite, melting glue or ink can release toxic fumes. Always check manufacturer guidelines at <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> for approved accessories.</p>  

<p>Many assume thin cardboard, like pizza boxes or takeaway containers, might be safe for short reheating. However, these often contain recycled materials with unpredictable burn points. A Ninja air fryer or other models circulate heat aggressively, accelerating risks. If you’ve accidentally used cardboard, unplug the appliance immediately and ventilate the area. For cleaning soot or residue, <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner</a> solutions can help restore your device safely.</p>  

<h3>What Happens If You Use Cardboard?</h3>  
<p>Cardboard in an air fryer typically smokes, chars, or ignites within minutes. The confined space traps heat, causing rapid combustion. Even unburnt cardboard leaves behind fibres that can clog vents or contaminate food. Some users report warped baskets or lingering smoke odours requiring deep cleaning. For safer reheating, try our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable recipes</a> that use no risky materials.</p>  

<h2>Safe Alternatives to Cardboard</h2>  
<p>Silicone liners and perforated parchment paper are excellent substitutes. They withstand temperatures up to 250°C and prevent food from sticking without hazards. Look for products labelled "air fryer-safe" and avoid wax-coated papers, which melt. For crispy results, a light spritz of oil on the basket works better than cardboard. Discover more tips in our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for adapting oven recipes safely.</p>  

<p>Some brands sell reusable mesh inserts for delicate foods like fish or pastries. These are dishwasher-safe and eliminate single-use waste. If you’re reheating pizza, place it directly on the rack or use a microwave-safe plate. For frozen foods, always check packaging for air fryer compatibility—some trays are oven-safe but not designed for rapid air circulation. Need inspiration?

<h3>Myths About Cardboard in Air Fryers</h3>  
<p>A common myth is that cardboard "insulates" heat or prevents messes. In reality, it disrupts airflow, leading to uneven cooking and potential appliance damage. Another misconception is that brief use is harmless—but even 30 seconds can start a fire. Always prioritise safety over convenience.</p>

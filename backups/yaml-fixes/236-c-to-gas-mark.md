<p>236 C converts to Gas Mark 9, which is a high heat setting ideal for roasting, baking, and air frying. This temperature is commonly used for dishes like Yorkshire puddings, crispy roast potatoes, or even certain cakes. If you're using an air fryer, you might need to adjust the cooking time slightly compared to a conventional oven.

Whether you're baking or roasting, knowing your 236 C to Gas Mark conversion ensures consistent results.</p>
<p>Gas Mark 9 is one of the highest settings on most ovens, making it perfect for achieving a crispy exterior while keeping the inside tender. If you're using a fan-assisted oven, you might need to reduce the temperature by 10-20 C, but Gas Mark remains the same. For air fryers, which cook faster, you might find recipes at <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes</a> helpful for timing adjustments.

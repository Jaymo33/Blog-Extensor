<p>328°F converts to Gas Mark 3 in UK ovens. This moderate temperature is perfect for slow baking, roasting vegetables, or cooking delicate dishes that need gentle heat. Whether you're using a conventional oven or adapting recipes for your air fryer, understanding this conversion is key to perfect results.</p>

<h2>Understanding 328 F to Gas Mark Conversion</h2>
<p>The Gas Mark scale is uniquely British, ranging from 1/4 to 9 with each full mark representing about 25-30°C. At 328°F (164°C), you're working with Gas Mark 3 - ideal for dishes that require steady, moderate heat. Many classic British recipes, from Victoria sponge to slow-roasted meats, use this temperature range. When converting for your air fryer, remember they cook faster than conventional ovens, so you may need to reduce cooking times by 20% while keeping the same temperature.</p>

<p>For those who love baking, Gas Mark 3 (328°F) is particularly useful for items that need to cook through without excessive browning. This includes custards, cheesecakes, and meringues. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we've found this temperature works beautifully for adapting these delicate bakes to air fryer cooking.</p>

<h3>Why 328 F Matters in Cooking</h3>
<p>This specific temperature sits in the sweet spot between gentle cooking and proper heat penetration. It's hot enough to cook food thoroughly without risking burning or drying out. In gas ovens, Gas Mark 3 provides consistent indirect heat that's excellent for even cooking. When using an air fryer at 328°F, the circulating hot air creates similar results but in less time - perfect for busy cooks.</p>

<h2>Converting 328 F to Gas Mark for Different Appliances</h2>
<p>While 328°F equals Gas Mark 3 in traditional ovens, air fryers handle this temperature slightly differently. The intense air circulation means foods cook faster, so you might need to adjust both time and rack position. For example, roasting vegetables at 328°F (Gas Mark 3 equivalent) in an air fryer typically takes 15-20 minutes instead of 30-40 minutes in a conventional oven.</p>

<p>Many modern air fryers come with temperature presets that make conversion easy. If yours doesn't have a Gas Mark setting, simply set it to 328°F. For those who prefer visual guides, <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> offers printable conversion charts that include both Fahrenheit and Gas Mark equivalents for all your cooking needs.</p>

<h3>Special Considerations for Air Fryers</h3>
<p>When cooking at 328 F (Gas Mark 3 equivalent) in an air fryer, remember to shake or turn food halfway through cooking. This ensures even exposure to the circulating hot air. Also, because air fryers are more compact than conventional ovens, you may need to cook in smaller batches to prevent overcrowding and ensure proper air flow.</p>

<h2>Popular Recipes Using 328 F (Gas Mark 3)</h2>
<p>This temperature works beautifully for a range of dishes. Classic examples include slow-roasted tomatoes, baked custards, and delicate sponge cakes. When adapting these for your air fryer, consider using oven-safe ramekins or baking pans that fit comfortably inside the basket. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert recipes</a> section features several Gas Mark 3 adaptations perfect for air fryers.</p>

<p>For savoury dishes, 328°F (Gas Mark 3) is excellent for cooking fish fillets or chicken breasts gently. The lower heat helps retain moisture while still cooking through properly. Try our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipes</a> collection for inspiration on adapting these dishes to your air fryer at this temperature.</p>

<h3>Baking Adjustments for Air Fryers</h3>
<p>When baking at 328 F (Gas Mark 3) in an air fryer, reduce standard oven times by about 20% and check for doneness early. The concentrated heat can cause baked goods to cook faster than in conventional ovens. Using parchment paper or silicone liners (available in our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>accessories section</a>) can help prevent sticking and make cleanup easier.</p>

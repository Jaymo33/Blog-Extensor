<h2>Tips for buying and storing 0.75 kg salmon fillet</h2>
<p>When purchasing a 0.75 kg salmon fillet, look for firm, bright flesh with a fresh sea smell. Avoid any fillets with discoloration or strong fishy odors. If buying frozen, ensure the packaging is intact and without frost buildup. Once home, store salmon in the coldest part of your fridge and use within two days. For longer storage, wrap tightly and freeze for up to three months.</p>

<p>Thawing frozen salmon properly is key to maintaining texture and flavor. Place it in the fridge overnight or use the defrost setting on your microwave. Never thaw salmon at room temperature, as this can promote bacterial growth. Once thawed, cook immediately for the best results.

Cook at 180Â°C for 12-15 minutes, depending on thickness. The salmon is done when it flakes easily with a fork. Let it rest for a few minutes before serving to retain juices. This method works perfectly for a 1.65-pound fillet, delivering delicious results every time.</p>

<h3>Common mistakes when cooking 0.75 kg salmon fillet</h3>
<p>Overcooking is the most common mistake with salmon, especially in air fryers. Since 0.75 kg equals 1.65 pounds, it's thicker than smaller fillets, so monitor closely. Avoid overcrowding the air fryer basket, as this leads to uneven cooking. Another error is not patting the fillet dry, which prevents proper browning. Always preheat your air fryer for best results, and don't forget to clean it afterwards with <a href="https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner">recommended products</a>.</p>

<p>4 tablespoons (tbsp) of plain yogurt equals approximately 60 grams (g). This conversion is essential for precise measurements in air fryer recipes, ensuring consistent results every time. Whether you’re whipping up a marinade, baking, or preparing a healthy snack, knowing the exact weight helps avoid guesswork. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we focus on making cooking simpler with accurate conversions and easy-to-follow guides.</p>

<h2>Why accurate yogurt measurements matter</h2>  
<p>Using the correct amount of yogurt in recipes ensures the right texture and flavour. Too much or too little can affect the outcome, especially in air fryer dishes where consistency is key. For example, adding 60 grams of yogurt to a marinade keeps chicken moist, while using it in baking helps achieve the perfect rise. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more handy measurement tips.</p>  

<p>Yogurt is a versatile ingredient in air fryer cooking, from tenderising meats to creating creamy dips. Whether you’re making a <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipe</a> or a dessert, precise measurements ensure success. If you’re unsure, weighing ingredients like yogurt eliminates errors and guarantees delicious results every time.</p>  

<h3>How to measure 4 tbsp of plain yogurt accurately</h3>  
<p>For the most precise measurement, use a kitchen scale to weigh 60 grams of plain yogurt. If you don’t have one, fill a tablespoon evenly without packing it down. Level off the excess with a knife for consistency. Remember, slight variations can occur depending on yogurt thickness, so a scale is always best.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for 4 tbsp of plain yogurt in air fryer recipes</h2>  
<p>Four tablespoons of plain yogurt (60g) is a common measurement in many air fryer dishes. It’s perfect for marinating chicken, making dressings, or adding moisture to baked goods. Try it in our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> for creamy, flavourful results without the guesswork.</p>  

<p>Yogurt also works wonders in <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert recipes</a>, like air-fried cakes or muffins. Its acidity helps activate baking soda, giving baked goods a light, fluffy texture. Whether you’re cooking savoury or sweet, 60 grams of yogurt adds richness without overpowering other flavours.</p>  

<h3>Tips for storing and using plain yogurt</h3>  
<p>Keep your yogurt fresh by storing it in an airtight container in the fridge. Stir it well before measuring, as separation can affect accuracy. For longer shelf life, freeze portions in ice cube trays and thaw as needed. Always check for spoilage before use to ensure food safety.</p>  

<p>Cleaning your air fryer after using yogurt-based recipes is easy with our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner guide</a>. Yogurt can sometimes stick, so a quick wipe-down keeps your appliance in top condition. Regular maintenance ensures your air fryer stays efficient and ready for your next culinary adventure.</p>

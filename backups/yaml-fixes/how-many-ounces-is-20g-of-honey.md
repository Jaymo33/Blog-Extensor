<p>20g of honey equals approximately 0.7 ounces, making it a handy measurement for air fryer recipes. Whether you’re drizzling honey over roasted vegetables or sweetening a cake batter, knowing this conversion ensures precision in your cooking. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we love helping you get the most out of your air fryer with accurate measurements and delicious results.</p>  

<h2>Why converting grams to ounces matters</h2>  
<p>Many recipes, especially those from the UK or Europe, list ingredients in grams, while others use ounces. If you’re following an air fryer recipe that calls for 20g of honey, knowing the ounce equivalent (0.7 oz) helps avoid guesswork. This ensures your dishes have the perfect balance of sweetness and texture. For more conversions, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>  

<p>Honey’s viscosity can make measuring tricky, but using weight (grams or ounces) instead of volume (teaspoons or tablespoons) guarantees accuracy. Whether you’re making sticky glazes for chicken or sweetening desserts like our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>air fryer cakes</a>, precise measurements matter.</p>  

<h3>How to measure 20g of honey without scales</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a kitchen scale, you can still measure 20g of honey using tablespoons. One tablespoon of honey weighs about 21g, so a slightly heaped tablespoon will give you roughly 20g (or 0.7 oz). For sticky ingredients like honey, lightly greasing the spoon helps it slide off easily.</p>  

<h2>Using honey in air fryer recipes</h2>  
<p>Honey adds a delightful sweetness and caramelisation to air-fried dishes. From glazed salmon to honey-roasted carrots, 20g (0.7 oz) is often the perfect amount for a family-sized portion. Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> for inspiration on using honey in your cooking.</p>  

<p>When air frying with honey, keep the temperature below 180°C to prevent burning. A light brush or drizzle ensures even coverage without overpowering the dish. For sticky marinades, mix honey with soy sauce or mustard for a balanced flavour.</p>  

<h3>Storing honey for air fryer cooking</h3>  
<p>Store honey in a cool, dry place to maintain its quality. If it crystallises, gently warm the jar in warm water to return it to a liquid state. Measuring 20g (0.7 oz) of honey is easier when it’s pourable, so keep it at room temperature before use.</p>  

<h2>Common honey conversions for air fryer recipes</h2>  
<p>Beyond 20g, here are other useful honey conversions: 50g equals 1.76 oz, and 100g equals 3.53 oz. These measurements come in handy for larger batches or meal prep. For more tips, check our guide on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning your air fryer</a> after sticky recipes.</p>

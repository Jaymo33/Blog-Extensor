<p>85 ml of lime juice equals approximately 0.36 cups (US) or 0.3 cups (UK). Whether you're whipping up a zesty marinade or baking a tangy dessert, knowing this conversion ensures your air fryer recipes turn out perfectly every time. Accurate measurements are key, especially when working with bold flavours like lime juice.</p>  

<h2>Understanding Lime Juice Measurements</h2>  
<p>Lime juice adds a bright, tangy kick to dishes, but measuring it correctly is crucial. In the UK, metric measurements like millilitres (ml) are standard, while the US often uses cups. For air fryer recipes, precision ensures even cooking and balanced flavours. If you're following a recipe from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, knowing how to convert 85 ml of lime juice to cups is handy.</p>  

<p>Most measuring jugs show both metric and imperial units, but if yours doesn’t, a simple conversion will do. For US cups, 85 ml is roughly 0.36 cups, while UK cups measure slightly larger at 0.3 cups. This small difference can impact recipes, so always check which cup measurement your recipe uses.</p>  

<h3>Why Accuracy Matters in Air Fryer Cooking</h3>  
<p>Air fryers cook food quickly and evenly, but incorrect measurements can throw off texture and taste. Too much lime juice might make a dish overly acidic, while too little could leave it bland. Whether you're making <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>lime-marinated chicken</a> or a citrusy dessert, precise conversions like 85 ml to cups ensure success.</p>  

<h2>Converting 85 ml of Lime Juice to Other Units</h2>  
<p>If you don’t have a measuring cup handy, you can use tablespoons or teaspoons. 85 ml of lime juice is about 5.7 tablespoons or 17 teaspoons. This is useful for smaller batches or when adjusting recipes. For more conversions, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>  

<p>Another tip is to use a kitchen scale. Since lime juice has a similar density to water, 85 ml weighs roughly 85 grams. This method is especially helpful for baking, where precision is non-negotiable. Whether you're making a key lime pie or a zesty glaze, these conversions save time and hassle.</p>  

<h3>Common Recipes Using 85 ml of Lime Juice</h3>  
<p>Many air fryer recipes call for 85 ml of lime juice, from marinades to dressings. For example, a tangy lime and garlic shrimp dish or a refreshing avocado lime dip. If you're exploring new flavours, browse our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a> for inspiration.</p>  

<h2>Tips for Measuring Lime Juice</h2>  
<p>Fresh lime juice tastes best, but bottled works in a pinch. One medium lime yields about 30 ml, so you’ll need roughly 3 limes for 85 ml. Roll limes before juicing to maximise yield. For consistent results, strain the juice to remove pulp.</p>  

<p>Store leftover lime juice in an airtight container in the fridge for up to a week. You can also freeze it in ice cube trays for future use. This is handy for quick <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert recipes</a> or last-minute marinades.</p>  

<h3>Cleaning Up After Using Lime Juice</h3>  
<p>Lime juice can leave sticky residues on your air fryer basket. For easy cleanup, use our recommended <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner</a>. A quick wipe prevents buildup and keeps your appliance in top condition.</p>

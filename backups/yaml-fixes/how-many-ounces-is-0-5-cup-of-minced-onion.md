<p>0.5 cup of minced onion equals approximately 2 ounces, making it easy to measure for your air fryer recipes. Whether you're prepping a stir-fry or adding flavour to a casserole, knowing this conversion ensures accuracy. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we help simplify cooking measurements so you can focus on creating tasty dishes.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Precision is key when using an air fryer, as ingredients cook faster and more evenly than in traditional ovens. Using the correct amount of minced onion—like 0.5 cup (2 ounces)—ensures balanced flavours and textures. Overloading your air fryer basket can lead to uneven cooking, while too little may leave your dish lacking depth. For more tips, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> to streamline your prep work.</p>  

<p>Minced onion is a versatile ingredient, often used in everything from meatloaf to vegetable stir-fries. Measuring 0.5 cup (2 ounces) correctly helps maintain consistency across recipes. If you're new to air frying, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a> offers plenty of inspiration for using minced onion effectively.</p>  

<h3>How to measure minced onion accurately</h3>  
<p>To measure 0.5 cup of minced onion, lightly pack the onion into a measuring cup without pressing too hard. This ensures you get the right volume, which translates to roughly 2 ounces. For best results, use fresh onions and mince them finely for even distribution in your air fryer dishes.</p>  

<h2>Common recipes using 0.5 cup of minced onion</h2>  
<p>Many air fryer recipes call for 0.5 cup of minced onion, such as savoury muffins, stuffed peppers, or onion-infused meats. This measurement (2 ounces) adds just the right amount of flavour without overpowering other ingredients. Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable recipes</a> for creative ways to incorporate minced onion.</p>  

<p>If you're meal prepping, knowing that 0.5 cup equals 2 ounces helps with portion control. You can also freeze minced onion in this quantity for later use, saving time on busy weeknights. For more meal prep ideas, visit <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>.</p>  

<h3>Converting other onion measurements</h3>  
<p>If a recipe calls for a whole onion instead of 0.5 cup (2 ounces), a medium onion typically yields about 1 cup when minced. This makes it easy to adjust quantities based on your needs. Keeping these conversions handy ensures you’ll never second-guess your measurements again.</p>

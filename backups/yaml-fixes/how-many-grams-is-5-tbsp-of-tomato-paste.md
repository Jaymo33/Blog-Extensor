<p>5 tablespoons of tomato paste equals approximately 85 grams. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precision matters, ensuring your dishes turn out perfectly every time. Whether you're making a rich pasta sauce or a flavourful marinade, knowing the exact weight helps maintain consistency. For more handy conversions, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on even cooking, and incorrect ingredient quantities can throw off the balance. Too much tomato paste, for example, might make your dish overly thick or acidic. On the other hand, too little could leave it bland. That's why converting 5 tbsp of tomato paste to grams (85g) ensures you get the right consistency and flavour. For more tips on perfecting your meals, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a>.</p>  

<p>Tomato paste is a concentrated ingredient, so small measurement errors can have a big impact. Using grams instead of tablespoons removes guesswork, especially when scaling recipes up or down. This is particularly useful for batch cooking or meal prepping, where consistency is key. If you're new to air frying, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable recipes</a> are a great place to start.</p>  

<h3>How to measure tomato paste accurately</h3>  
<p>For the most precise results, use a digital kitchen scale to weigh your tomato paste. Scoop the paste into a bowl or onto parchment paper and tare the scale to zero before measuring. If you don't have a scale, levelling off each tablespoon with a knife helps, but remember that 5 tbsp of tomato paste should weigh around 85 grams.

<h2>Common uses for tomato paste in air fryer recipes</h2>  
<p>Tomato paste adds depth to sauces, marinades, and even roasted vegetables in the air fryer. It's a staple in dishes like air-fried meatballs, stuffed peppers, or homemade pizza. Knowing that 5 tbsp of tomato paste equals 85 grams helps you adjust recipes without compromising taste. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipes</a> for ideas on incorporating tomato paste.</p>  

<p>Another great use is in homemade air fryer ketchup or barbecue sauce, where tomato paste forms the base. Since these recipes often require larger quantities, converting tablespoons to grams ensures uniformity. For cleaning tips after cooking sticky sauces, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner guide</a> has you covered.</p>  

<h3>Storing leftover tomato paste</h3>  
<p>If you've measured out 5 tbsp (85g) of tomato paste but only need half, store the rest in an airtight container in the fridge. It keeps for up to a week, or you can freeze it in ice cube trays for longer storage. This way, you'll always have the right amount ready for your next air fryer creation.</p>

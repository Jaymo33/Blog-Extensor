<p>500g of tahini equals approximately 17.64 ounces. This conversion is essential for anyone using air fryer recipes that require precise measurements. Whether you're making hummus, dressings, or marinades, knowing how to convert grams to ounces ensures your dishes turn out perfectly every time.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>
<p>Precision is key when it comes to air fryer cooking. Unlike traditional ovens, air fryers rely on rapid hot air circulation, which means ingredient ratios can significantly impact the final result. Using the correct amount of tahini—whether 500g or its ounce equivalent—ensures your recipes have the right consistency and flavour balance.</p>
<p>For example, if you're making a tahini-based sauce for <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer chicken</a>, too much or too little tahini can throw off the texture. That’s why conversions like 500g tahini to ounces are so handy. You’ll find plenty of recipes on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> that benefit from precise measurements.</p>

<h2>How to Convert 500g of Tahini to Ounces</h2>
<p>The conversion from grams to ounces is straightforward. One gram equals 0.035274 ounces, so 500g of tahini is roughly 17.64 ounces. This is particularly useful for UK cooks who might be using recipes with metric measurements but prefer imperial units for weighing ingredients.</p>
<p>If you don’t have a scale that displays both units, you can use a simple calculator or refer to a <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a>. For tahini, which is a dense paste, measuring by weight (grams or ounces) is more accurate than using volume measurements like cups or tablespoons.</p>

<h3>Common Uses for 500g of Tahini in Air Fryer Recipes</h3>
<p>Tahini is a versatile ingredient that works well in many air fryer dishes. From marinades for <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>air fryer chicken</a> to dips for roasted vegetables, having the right amount ensures your meals are flavourful and well-balanced. A 500g batch of tahini can be used in multiple recipes, so knowing its ounce equivalent helps with meal planning.</p>

<h3>Tips for Storing Tahini After Measuring</h3>
<p>Once you’ve measured out your 500g (or 17.64 ounces) of tahini, proper storage is key to maintaining its freshness. Store it in an airtight container in the fridge, and give it a good stir before use, as the oil tends to separate. This ensures your tahini stays smooth and ready for your next <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipe</a>.</p>

<h2>Frequently Asked Questions About Tahini Measurements</h2>
<p>Many home cooks wonder whether tahini measurements differ between brands or types. The good news is that 500g of tahini will always convert to roughly 17.64 ounces, regardless of the brand. However, the consistency might vary slightly, so always stir well before measuring for accuracy.</p>
<p>If you’re working with a smaller amount, like 250g, simply halve the conversion to get 8.82 ounces. For larger batches, such as 1kg, double it to 35.27 ounces. These conversions are handy for scaling recipes up or down, especially when experimenting with new dishes in your air fryer.</p>

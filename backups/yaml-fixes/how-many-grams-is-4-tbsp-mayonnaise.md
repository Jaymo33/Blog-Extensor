<p>4 tablespoons (tbsp) of mayonnaise weigh approximately 60 grams (g). This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements can make or break your dish. Whether you're whipping up a creamy sauce or coating chicken for a crispy finish, knowing the exact weight ensures consistency. For more air fryer conversions, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air frying</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on even cooking, and incorrect ingredient quantities can lead to uneven results. Too much mayonnaise might make your food greasy, while too little could leave it dry. Measuring 4 tbsp of mayonnaise to grams (60g) helps maintain balance, especially in recipes like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>air fryer chicken dishes</a>. For best results, use a digital kitchen scale to confirm the weight.</p>  

<p>Mayonnaise density can vary slightly between brands, but 60g is a reliable standard for UK measurements. If you're adapting a recipe from cups or ounces, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion guide</a> simplifies the process. Precision is key for air fryer success, whether you're cooking mains or <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>desserts</a>.</p>  

<h3>How to measure mayonnaise without scales</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have scales, use the spoon-and-level method for accuracy. Fill your tablespoon evenly without packing the mayonnaise down, then level it off with a knife. Four level tablespoons should give you roughly 60g. For sticky ingredients like mayonnaise, a silicone spatula helps scrape every bit into your mixing bowl.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for 4 tbsp mayonnaise in air fryer recipes</h2>  
<p>Four tablespoons of mayonnaise (60g) is a versatile quantity in air frying. It’s perfect for binding breadcrumbs to chicken tenders, creating a crispy coating for <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/potatoes>air fryer potatoes</a>, or mixing into dips. Since mayonnaise helps retain moisture, it’s a popular ingredient for juicy, golden results.</p>  

<p>For a healthier twist, light mayonnaise works too—just confirm the weight matches standard mayo. If you’re meal prepping, batch measurements save time. Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a> for inspiration on using 4 tbsp mayonnaise creatively.</p>  

<h3>Storing mayonnaise for air fryer cooking</h3>  
<p>Keep mayonnaise refrigerated and check the expiry date before use. If your recipe calls for room-temperature mayo, measure out 4 tbsp (60g) and let it sit for 10 minutes. This ensures even mixing with other ingredients. Always wipe the jar rim clean to prevent contamination.</p>

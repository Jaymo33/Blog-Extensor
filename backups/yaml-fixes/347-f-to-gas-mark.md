<p>347°F converts to Gas Mark 4 in UK ovens - a medium heat perfect for baking and roasting in both conventional ovens and air fryers. This temperature works particularly well for items that need gentle cooking with crisp finishing, from cakes to roasted vegetables.</p>

<h2>Understanding Gas Mark Conversions</h2>
<p>Gas Mark temperatures are specific to UK ovens and range from Gas Mark 1 (275°F) to Gas Mark 9 (475°F). The Gas Mark system was developed for gas ovens but is now used as a standard measurement across all oven types. When converting 347 Fahrenheit to Gas Mark, you're dealing with one of the most versatile baking temperatures.</p>
<p>Many traditional recipes at <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> originally designed for conventional ovens work beautifully at Gas Mark 4 (347°F) in air fryers. The circulating hot air mimics the even heat distribution of fan ovens, often yielding better results than conventional gas ovens at the same temperature setting.</p>

<h2>Why 347°F (Gas Mark 4) Works So Well in Air Fryers</h2>
<p>This temperature hits the sweet spot for numerous cooking techniques. At 347°F to Gas Mark 4, you get enough heat to create browning and crisping through the Maillard reaction, while being low enough to prevent burning delicate items. It's ideal for everything from scones to chicken thighs.</p>
<p>The rapid air circulation in air fryers means foods often cook faster than in conventional ovens. When adapting recipes from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>our conversion chart</a>, you might need to reduce cooking times by 15-20% when using 347 Fahrenheit to Gas Mark 4 settings. Always check food a few minutes early until you learn your appliance's quirks.</p>

<h3>Best Foods to Cook at 347°F (Gas Mark 4)</h3>
<p>This temperature excels for baked goods like Victoria sponge, cookies, and bread rolls - giving them time to rise properly while developing a golden crust. It's also perfect for roasting vegetables from our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable recipe collection</a>, allowing caramelisation without drying out.</p>

<h2>Converting Other Temperatures to Gas Mark</h2>
<p>While we've focused on 347 Fahrenheit to Gas Mark conversion, understanding the full scale helps with recipe adaptation. Gas Mark 3 is 325°F, Gas Mark 5 is 375°F, and Gas Mark 6 is 400°F. These conversions become second nature with practice.</p>
<p>For those using fan ovens, remember they typically require temperatures about 20°C (36°F) lower than conventional recipes suggest. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> team always includes both measurements in new recipes to simplify your cooking experience.</p>

<h3>Troubleshooting Temperature Issues</h3>
<p>If foods brown too quickly at 347°F to Gas Mark 4 in your air fryer, try reducing the temperature by 10-15°F or shielding delicate areas with foil. Conversely, if browning is insufficient, a quick 2-3 minute blast at a higher temperature at the end can perfect the finish without risking dryness.</p>

<h2>Maintaining Your Air Fryer at Optimal Performance</h2>
<p>Regular cleaning ensures your air fryer maintains accurate temperatures. Food buildup can affect heat distribution, making your 347 Fahrenheit to Gas Mark 4 setting perform differently over time. Use our recommended <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning methods</a> after every few uses for consistent results.</p>
<p>Different air fryer models may have slight variations in how they handle Gas Mark equivalent temperatures. It's worth doing a test bake with something simple like biscuits when you first convert 347°F to Gas Mark 4 in a new appliance, noting any needed adjustments for future reference.</p>

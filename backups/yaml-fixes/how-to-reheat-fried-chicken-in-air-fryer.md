<p>To reheat fried chicken in an air fryer, preheat to 180°C (350°F) and cook for 3-5 minutes until piping hot. This method restores crispiness while keeping the meat juicy – far better than microwaving. Whether you’ve got leftover KFC or homemade fried chicken, your air fryer’s rapid hot air circulation works wonders.</p>

<h2>Why Use an Air Fryer to Reheat Fried Chicken?</h2>
<p>Air fryers excel at reheating fried chicken because they recreate the original cooking environment. The intense circulating heat revives the crispy coating while gently warming the meat inside. Unlike microwaves that turn breading soggy or ovens that dry out chicken, air fryers deliver balanced results. For more air fryer reheating tips, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a> featuring dozens of clever techniques.</p>
<p>Compared to other methods, air frying requires minimal oil – just a quick spritz helps refresh the crust. The compact cooking chamber means faster reheating times too. Whether you’re working with drumsticks, wings or breast pieces, the air fryer’s even heat distribution prevents cold spots. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> to adapt any fried chicken recipe.</p>

<h3>Ideal Temperature for Reheating Fried Chicken</h3>
<p>180°C (350°F) is the sweet spot for reheating fried chicken in an air fryer. This temperature thoroughly heats the chicken without burning the coating. For extra-crispy results, some models have a ‘reheat’ preset – consult your manual. Thicker cuts like thighs may need 190°C for 5-6 minutes.</p>

<h2>Step-by-Step Guide to Reheating Fried Chicken</h2>
<p>Start by preheating your air fryer for 3 minutes – this ensures even cooking from the first second. Arrange chicken pieces in a single layer with space between them; overcrowding causes steaming. Lightly spray with oil if the coating looks dry. For bone-in pieces, place them meat-side down first, then flip halfway. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipe category</a> has more serving suggestions.</p>
<p>Check internal temperature with a meat thermometer – it should reach 74°C (165°F) for food safety. If reheating refrigerated fried chicken, add 1-2 minutes to account for the colder starting temperature. For large batches, work in multiple rounds rather than cramming the basket. Always let chicken rest 1 minute before eating to allow heat distribution.</p>

<h3>How Long to Reheat Fried Chicken in Air Fryer</h3>
<p>Most fried chicken reheats perfectly in 3-5 minutes at 180°C. Smaller pieces like wings may only need 2-3 minutes, while thick breasts could require 4-6 minutes. If your air fryer has a reheat function, it typically runs for 4 minutes – adjust based on your chicken’s thickness. For frozen fried chicken, extend time to 8-10 minutes.</p>

<h2>Tips for Crispy, Juicy Reheated Fried Chicken</h2>
<p>Place a slice of bread underneath the chicken to absorb excess grease and prevent sogginess. If the coating seems loose, brush with melted butter before reheating. For extra crunch, sprinkle a teaspoon of cornflour over the chicken before air frying. Discover more clever tricks in our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning and maintenance guide</a> to keep your appliance performing perfectly.</p>
<p>Store leftover fried chicken properly – place in an airtight container with paper towels to absorb moisture. Reheat within 3 days for best quality. For particularly dry chicken, lightly brush with chicken stock before reheating. Always use oven mitts when handling the hot basket, as the crispy coating can be deceptively hot.</p>

<h3>Common Mistakes When Reheating Fried Chicken</h3>
<p>Overcrowding the basket is the top mistake – it leads to uneven heating and soggy results. Another error is skipping the preheat, which extends cooking time. Using too high temperature burns the coating before the center warms through. Not flipping pieces halfway causes one side to become overly crisp while the other stays soft.</p>

<p>1.5 tablespoons (tbsp) of cornflour equals approximately 12 grams. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements ensure crispy, evenly cooked dishes. Whether you’re breading chicken or thickening a sauce, knowing the exact grams in 1.5 tbsp of cornflour makes all the difference.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on even heat distribution, and incorrect ingredient quantities can lead to uneven cooking or soggy results. For example, using too much cornflour in a coating can make it clumpy, while too little may not crisp up properly. That’s why converting 1.5 tbsp of cornflour to grams (12g) is so helpful for consistency. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we emphasise precision to help you achieve restaurant-quality results at home.</p>  

<p>Many air fryer recipes, especially those involving batters or coatings, require exact measurements. Cornflour is a common ingredient for creating light, crispy textures, whether you’re making fried chicken or onion rings. By knowing that 1.5 tbsp of cornflour is 12 grams, you can follow recipes more accurately and avoid guesswork.</p>  

<h2>How to measure 1.5 tbsp of cornflour correctly</h2>  
<p>To measure 1.5 tbsp of cornflour accurately, use a standard UK tablespoon (15ml) and fill it level, not heaped. Scoop the cornflour lightly, then sweep off the excess with a straight edge. If you’re using a digital scale, 1.5 tbsp of cornflour will weigh around 12 grams. This method ensures consistency, especially for air fryer recipes where texture is key.</p>  

<h3>Using a kitchen scale for better accuracy</h3>  
<p>A digital kitchen scale is the best way to measure 1.5 tbsp of cornflour in grams. Simply place your bowl on the scale, tare it to zero, then add cornflour until it reaches 12 grams. This eliminates any variability from scooping or packing the flour too tightly.

Cornflour is also great for thickening sauces or gravies in dishes like air-fried meatballs or stir-fries.</p>  

<p>If you’re experimenting with gluten-free air fryer recipes, cornflour is a fantastic alternative to wheat flour. It creates a lighter, crispier texture, perfect for frying or baking. Knowing that 1.5 tbsp equals 12 grams helps you adapt recipes with confidence.</p>  

<h3>Storing cornflour for long-term use</h3>  
<p>To keep your cornflour fresh, store it in an airtight container in a cool, dry place. This prevents clumping and ensures accurate measurements every time. If you’re using it frequently for air fryer recipes, consider buying in bulk and portioning it out as needed.</p>

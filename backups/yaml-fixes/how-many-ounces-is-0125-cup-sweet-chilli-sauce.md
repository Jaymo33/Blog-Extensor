<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on even cooking, and incorrect measurements can throw off textures and flavours. Sweet chilli sauce, for instance, can make or break a dish if used in the wrong quantity. Too much, and your meal might be overly sweet or sticky; too little, and it could lack depth. That’s why converting 0.125 cup of sweet chilli sauce to ounces (1 oz) is so helpful.

<p>Many air fryer enthusiasts swear by weighing ingredients for consistency. While cups are convenient, ounces provide a more precise measurement, especially for sauces like sweet chilli. If you’re new to air frying, mastering these conversions will elevate your cooking game. Plus, it saves time—no more guessing or messy spills!</p>  

<h3>How to measure 0.125 cup of sweet chilli sauce</h3>  
<p>Measuring small quantities like 0.125 cup (1 oz) of sweet chilli sauce can be tricky without the right tools. A liquid measuring cup with clear markings is ideal, but if you don’t have one, a tablespoon can work—0.125 cup equals 2 tablespoons. For sticky sauces, lightly grease the spoon for easier pouring.

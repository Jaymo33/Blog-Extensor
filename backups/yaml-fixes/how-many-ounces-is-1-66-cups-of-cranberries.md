Cranberries are a versatile ingredient, and getting the measurements right is the first step to culinary success.</p>

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>
<p>Air fryers rely on even cooking, and precise ingredient measurements play a crucial role. Too many cranberries can overcrowd the basket, leading to uneven cooking, while too few might dry out.

Whether you’re making cranberry compote or adding them to a roast, precision ensures balanced flavours. Scales are also handy for other ingredients, making them a worthwhile investment for any home cook.</p>

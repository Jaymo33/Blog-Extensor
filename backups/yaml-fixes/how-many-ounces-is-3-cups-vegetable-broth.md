<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Precision is key when using an air fryer, as the cooking process relies on even heat distribution. Too much or too little liquid, like vegetable broth, can affect texture and taste. For example, a recipe calling for 3 cups of vegetable broth (24 oz) ensures the right balance of moisture. If you're unsure, always measure liquids in fluid ounces for accuracy. Explore more <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> to perfect your technique.</p>  

<p>Many air fryer dishes, like vegetable stews or braised meats, depend on broth for depth of flavour. Using 24 oz (3 cups) of vegetable broth guarantees the dish won’t dry out. It’s also helpful for marinating proteins or deglazing the air fryer basket. For tips on maintaining your appliance, visit our guide on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning your air fryer</a>.</p>  

<h3>How to measure vegetable broth for air fryer recipes</h3>  
<p>To measure 3 cups of vegetable broth (24 oz), use a liquid measuring cup for accuracy. Pour the broth to the 3-cup line, or weigh it at 24 oz on a kitchen scale. This ensures consistency, especially for batch cooking or meal prep. For more <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable-based recipes</a>, precise measurements make all the difference.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for 3 cups of vegetable broth in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>From soups to grains, 3 cups (24 oz) of vegetable broth is a versatile ingredient. It’s perfect for cooking quinoa, lentils, or even poaching chicken in the air fryer. The broth infuses dishes with rich flavour while keeping them moist. Try it in our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipes</a> for a delicious twist.</p>  

<p>Another great use is for braising vegetables like carrots or mushrooms. The 24 oz of broth ensures they cook evenly without burning. You can also reduce it to create a concentrated sauce.

<h3>Converting other broth measurements</h3>  
<p>If a recipe calls for a different amount, remember that 1 cup of vegetable broth equals 8 oz. So, 2 cups would be 16 oz, and 4 cups would be 32 oz. This simple ratio makes scaling recipes up or down a breeze. Keep this in mind for all your air fryer cooking needs.</p>

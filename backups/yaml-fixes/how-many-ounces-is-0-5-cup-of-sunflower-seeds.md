<p>0.5 cup of sunflower seeds equals approximately 2.5 ounces (70 grams) in UK measurements. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes, ensuring accurate portioning and perfect results every time. Whether you're roasting seeds or adding them to a dish, knowing the weight helps maintain consistency.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Precision is key when using an air fryer, as cooking times and temperatures rely on ingredient quantities. Too many sunflower seeds can overcrowd the basket, leading to uneven cooking. Too few might burn or dry out. For best results, always measure your 0.5 cup of sunflower seeds in ounces before adding them to recipes.</p>  

<p>At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we emphasise the importance of accurate conversions.

Whether you're preparing snacks or main dishes, knowing 0.5 cup of sunflower seeds in ounces ensures perfect texture and flavour.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure Sunflower Seeds Correctly</h3>  
<p>For the most accurate measurement, use a kitchen scale to weigh 0.5 cup of sunflower seeds in ounces. If you don't have one, lightly pack the seeds into a measuring cup without pressing down. This method prevents overfilling and keeps portions consistent.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for Sunflower Seeds in Air Fryers</h2>  
<p>Sunflower seeds add crunch and nutrition to many dishes. Roasting 0.5 cup (2.5 oz) in an air fryer at 160°C for 5-7 minutes enhances their flavour.

<h2>Converting Other Sunflower Seed Measurements</h2>

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on even cooking, and incorrect measurements can throw off the balance of your dish. Too much fish sauce can overpower the flavours, while too little might leave your meal tasting bland. Measuring 0.66 cup of fish sauce in ounces ensures you get the right intensity every time. This is especially important for marinades, where the liquid-to-solid ratio affects texture and taste. Visit <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>our recipe collection</a> for dishes that use fish sauce perfectly.</p>  

<h3>How to measure fish sauce for air fryer recipes</h3>  
<p>Use a liquid measuring cup for accuracy when measuring 0.66 cup of fish sauce. Pour the sauce slowly to avoid spills and check at eye level. If you don’t have a measuring cup, a kitchen scale set to ounces will work just as well. Remember, 0.66 cup converts to roughly 5.28 ounces, making it easier to weigh. For more tips, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipes</a> that often feature fish sauce.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for fish sauce in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Fish sauce is a versatile ingredient that enhances everything from meats to vegetables. In air fryer cooking, it’s often used in marinades for chicken, shrimp, or tofu. A 0.66 cup measurement (5.28 ounces) is ideal for batch cooking or meal prep. It also works well in dipping sauces, adding a savoury kick to spring rolls or dumplings.

<h3>Storing fish sauce for long-term use</h3>  
<p>Fish sauce has a long shelf life, but proper storage keeps it fresh. After measuring 0.66 cup (5.28 ounces), seal the bottle tightly and store it in a cool, dark place. Avoid exposing it to heat or sunlight, which can degrade the flavour. If you use fish sauce frequently, consider buying smaller bottles to maintain quality.

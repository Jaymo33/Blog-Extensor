<p>1.25 cups of evaporated milk equals 10 fluid ounces (or approximately 10 oz by weight for most brands). This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes, where precise measurements can make or break your dish. Whether you’re making a creamy sauce, a dessert, or a savoury bake, knowing this conversion ensures consistency.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on even heat distribution, and incorrect ingredient quantities can lead to uneven cooking or texture issues. Evaporated milk, being thicker than regular milk, requires careful measurement. Too much can make dishes overly rich, while too little might leave them dry. For more air fryer measurement tips, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>  

<p>Many UK recipes use metric measurements, but some older or American recipes list evaporated milk in cups. If you’re adapting a recipe for your air fryer, converting 1.25 cups to ounces (10 oz) ensures you stay on track. This is especially handy for desserts like custards or cakes, where precision is key.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure Evaporated Milk Correctly</h3>  
<p>Use a liquid measuring cup for fluid ounces or a kitchen scale for weight. Evaporated milk is denser than regular milk, so 1.25 cups will weigh slightly more than 10 oz if measured by weight. For best results, stick to fluid ounces unless your recipe specifies otherwise. Need recipe ideas? Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> for inspiration.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for Evaporated Milk in Air Fryer Recipes</h2>  
<p>Evaporated milk adds creaminess to dishes like mac and cheese, bread puddings, or even mashed potatoes. Its concentrated flavour makes it a favourite for air fryer bakes. If you’re making a savoury dish, 1.25 cups (10 oz) can be the perfect amount for a family-sized portion.</p>  

<p>For sweet treats, evaporated milk is often used in flans, custards, or fudges. The 1.25-cup measurement translates neatly to 10 oz, simplifying adjustments. If you’re working with frozen ingredients, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/frozen-foods>frozen foods category</a> has handy tips.</p>  

<h3>Converting Other Evaporated Milk Measurements</h3>  
<p>If your recipe calls for a different amount, here’s a quick reference: 1 cup = 8 oz, 0.5 cups = 4 oz, and 2 cups = 16 oz.

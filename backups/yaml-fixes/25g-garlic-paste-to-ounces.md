<p>25g of garlic paste equals approximately 0.88 ounces. This conversion is handy when following air fryer recipes that require precise measurements, especially for marinades or sauces. Whether you're whipping up a quick garlic butter for your air fryer potatoes or prepping a marinade for chicken, knowing this conversion ensures accuracy. For more air fryer measurement tips, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of garlic paste can make or break your dish. Too little, and your meal might lack flavour; too much, and it could overpower other ingredients. The air fryer’s intense heat means flavours concentrate quickly, so precision is key. For example, a recipe calling for 25g of garlic paste (0.88 oz) ensures balanced taste without overwhelming the dish. If you’re experimenting with new recipes, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipe collection</a> offers plenty of inspiration.</p>  

<p>Garlic paste is a staple in many cuisines, from Mediterranean to Asian, and getting the measurement right ensures authenticity. Whether you’re making a garlic-infused oil for roasting vegetables or a marinade for shrimp, 25g (0.88 oz) is a common quantity. For more ideas, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable air fryer recipes</a>, where garlic plays a starring role.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure 25g of Garlic Paste Without Scales</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a kitchen scale, you can still measure 25g of garlic paste using tablespoons. One tablespoon of garlic paste weighs roughly 15g, so 1.5 tablespoons will give you close to 25g (0.88 oz). For sticky ingredients like garlic paste, lightly oiling the spoon helps it slide off easily. This trick is especially useful when prepping air fryer sauces or marinades in a hurry.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for 25g of Garlic Paste in Air Fryer Recipes</h2>  
<p>Garlic paste is incredibly versatile in air fryer cooking. A 25g portion (0.88 oz) is perfect for marinating chicken, coating potatoes, or adding depth to sauces. Try mixing it with olive oil and herbs for a quick garlic bread topping or blending it into a yogurt-based dip. For more creative ways to use garlic paste, browse our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken air fryer recipes</a>, where garlic is a frequent flavour booster.</p>  

<p>Another great use for 25g of garlic paste is in homemade air fryer sauces. Combine it with soy sauce, honey, and a splash of lime for a sticky glaze on salmon or tofu. The precise measurement ensures the sauce isn’t too pungent but still packs a punch. If you’re looking for more sauce ideas, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/salmon>salmon air fryer recipes</a> feature plenty of garlicky goodness.</p>  

<h3>Storing Leftover Garlic Paste</h3>  
<p>If you’ve opened a jar of garlic paste and only need 25g (0.88 oz), store the rest in an airtight container in the fridge. It’ll keep for up to two weeks, ready for your next air fryer adventure. To prevent spoilage, always use a clean spoon when scooping it out.

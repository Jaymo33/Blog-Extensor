<p>2 cups of baking powder equals approximately 16 ounces. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes, where precise measurements ensure perfect texture and rise. Whether you're making fluffy cakes or crispy coatings, knowing how many ounces are in 2 cups of baking powder guarantees consistent results. For more air fryer measurement tips, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer baking</h2>  
<p>Baking powder is a leavening agent that helps air fryer recipes rise evenly. Too much can make baked goods bitter, while too little results in dense textures. Measuring 2 cups of baking powder correctly in ounces ensures your air fryer cakes, muffins, or batters turn out light and fluffy. If you're new to air frying, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> for inspiration.</p>  

<p>Using a kitchen scale for ounces is more precise than cup measurements, especially for baking powder. Scooping directly from the bag can compact the powder, leading to uneven amounts. For best results, spoon the baking powder into the cup and level it off before converting to ounces. This method ensures your 2 cups of baking powder truly equals 16 ounces.</p>  

<h3>How to measure baking powder for air fryer recipes</h3>  
<p>For UK bakers, 2 cups of baking powder converts to roughly 16 ounces or 450 grams. Always use standard measuring cups (not mugs) for accuracy. If your air fryer recipe calls for 2 cups of baking powder but you only have scales, now you know it’s 16 ounces. Need cleaning tips after baking?

<h2>Common air fryer recipes using 2 cups of baking powder</h2>  
<p>While 2 cups of baking powder is a large quantity, it’s useful for batch cooking or commercial recipes. For home air fryer use, you might scale down but still need the 2 cups to ounces conversion for bigger projects. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>air fryer cake recipes</a> often use baking powder for lift.</p>  

<p>Examples include air fryer sponge cakes, doughnuts, or tempura batters where 2 cups of baking powder could be part of a larger recipe. Remember, 16 ounces of baking powder goes a long way – most home recipes use just 1-2 teaspoons. Store any excess in an airtight container to maintain potency.</p>  

<h3>Adjusting recipes between cups and ounces</h3>  
<p>If a US recipe lists 2 cups of baking powder but you prefer weighing in ounces, now you can confidently use 16 ounces instead. This conversion is particularly handy for air fryer users who value precision.

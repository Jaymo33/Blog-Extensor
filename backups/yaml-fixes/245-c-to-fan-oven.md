<p>245 C in a fan oven is equivalent to approximately 220 C with the fan setting. This 25-degree reduction accounts for the fan's efficient heat circulation, ensuring even cooking without overheating. Whether you're baking, roasting, or using your air fryer, this conversion is key to perfect results.</p>

<h2>Understanding Fan Oven Temperature Conversion</h2>
<p>When converting 245 C to fan oven settings, the general rule is to reduce the temperature by 20-25 degrees. This adjustment compensates for the fan's ability to distribute heat more evenly throughout the oven cavity. For precise cooking, especially with delicate items like cakes or pastries, maintaining this conversion ratio is crucial. Many modern recipes at <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> now include both conventional and fan oven temperatures to eliminate guesswork.</p>

<p>The science behind this conversion lies in heat transfer efficiency. A fan oven's circulating air cooks food faster at lower temperatures compared to conventional ovens. This principle applies equally to air fryers, which are essentially compact fan ovens. When following recipes from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>cake recipes</a>, always check whether the temperatures are specified for fan or conventional ovens.</p>

<h3>Why 245 C Requires Adjustment in Fan Ovens</h3>
<p>At 245 C, the fan's forced air circulation would create excessive browning if not adjusted downward. The 220 C fan setting provides equivalent cooking power without the risk of burning. This is particularly important for items like roasted vegetables or <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipes</a> where even cooking is essential.</p>

<h2>Practical Applications for 245 C Conversion</h2>
<p>Many British baking recipes traditionally use 245 C as a standard temperature for items like Yorkshire puddings or certain breads. When using a fan oven, applying the 245 C to 220 C conversion ensures these classics turn out perfectly. The same principle applies when using an air fryer - consult our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a> for precise adjustments.</p>

<p>Professional chefs recommend verifying your oven's actual temperature with an independent thermometer, as calibration can vary. This is especially true when working with precise temperatures like 245 C converted to fan settings. For those using combination microwave/oven units, the conversion might differ slightly - always refer to manufacturer guidelines.</p>

<h3>Air Fryer Equivalent for 245 C</h3>
<p>Modern air fryers typically operate like compact fan ovens, so the 245 C to 220 C conversion applies similarly. However, cooking times may be shorter due to the air fryer's smaller capacity and more intense air circulation. When adapting conventional oven recipes to air fryer use, always reduce both temperature and time accordingly.</p>

<h2>Common Mistakes When Converting 245 C</h2>
<p>Many home cooks forget to adjust cooking times when converting 245 C to fan oven settings. While the temperature decreases, cooking duration often needs reduction too - typically by 5-10 minutes per hour. Another frequent error is assuming all ovens behave identically; always perform visual checks on your food, especially when trying new recipes from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>.</p>

<p>Seasoned bakers recommend keeping a conversion chart handy until the adjustments become second nature. For those regularly switching between conventional and fan ovens (or air fryers), noting successful conversions in your recipe books can save future frustration. Remember that 245 C converted to fan settings isn't just about temperature - it affects texture, browning, and moisture retention too.</p>

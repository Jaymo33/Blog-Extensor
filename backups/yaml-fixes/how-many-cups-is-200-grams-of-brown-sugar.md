<p>200 grams of brown sugar is roughly equivalent to 1 cup when lightly packed. This conversion is essential for baking and air frying, where precision ensures perfect results every time. Whether you're whipping up cookies or a glaze for air-fried desserts, knowing how to measure brown sugar correctly makes all the difference.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Brown Sugar Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of brown sugar ensures your recipes turn out as intended—too much can make dishes overly sweet, while too little may leave them bland. Air fryer recipes, like those on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, often rely on exact measurements for even cooking. Brown sugar’s moisture content means it packs differently than granulated sugar, so measuring by weight (grams) is more reliable than volume (cups).</p>  

<p>For air frying, consistency is key—whether you're making sticky glazes or caramelised toppings. A digital kitchen scale is the best tool for accuracy, but if you don’t have one, our conversion guide will help. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for other common ingredient swaps.</p>  

<h2>How to Measure 200 Grams of Brown Sugar Without a Scale</h2>  
<p>If you don’t have a scale, lightly spoon brown sugar into a measuring cup and level it off for the closest approximation. Packing it tightly can result in up to 1.25 cups, so aim for a gentle press. For air fryer recipes like those in our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert category</a>, this method works well for most needs.</p>  

<h3>Differences Between UK and US Cup Measurements</h3>  
<p>In the UK, a standard cup holds 250ml, while in the US, it’s 240ml. This slight variation means 200 grams of brown sugar may fill a UK cup more densely. For precision, stick to weight measurements or adjust slightly if following a US-based recipe. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a> includes both metric and imperial conversions for hassle-free cooking.</p>  

<h2>Common Recipes Using 200 Grams of Brown Sugar</h2>  
<p>From air-fried cinnamon rolls to sticky BBQ glazes, 200 grams of brown sugar is a versatile ingredient. Try it in our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>cake recipes</a> for a rich, moist texture. Brown sugar also caramelises beautifully in the air fryer, making it ideal for toppings on desserts or roasted vegetables.</p>  

<h3>Storing Brown Sugar for Longevity</h3>  
<p>Keep brown sugar in an airtight container to prevent hardening. If it clumps, revive it with a slice of bread or a quick zap in the microwave. Proper storage ensures your 200-gram measurements stay consistent for future bakes and air fryer creations.</p>

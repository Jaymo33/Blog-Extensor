<p>35 ml of condensed milk is approximately 0.15 cups (or roughly 1/7 of a cup). This conversion is essential for baking, cooking, or using your air fryer to ensure your recipes turn out perfectly every time. Whether you're making a dessert or a savoury dish, knowing how to measure condensed milk accurately can make all the difference.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>When working with condensed milk, even small measurement discrepancies can affect the texture and taste of your dish. Too much can make desserts overly sweet or dense, while too little might leave them dry. For air fryer recipes, precise measurements ensure even cooking and perfect results. That’s why converting 35 ml of condensed milk to cups correctly is so important.</p>  
<p>If you’re using an air fryer, consistency is key. Many recipes on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> rely on exact measurements to achieve the best outcomes. Whether you’re making cakes, cookies, or even savoury dishes, knowing how to convert 35 ml of condensed milk to cups will help you follow recipes with confidence.</p>  

<h2>How to Measure 35 ml of Condensed Milk</h2>  
<p>Measuring 35 ml of condensed milk can be tricky if you don’t have a metric measuring cup. A standard US cup is 240 ml, so 35 ml is just under 1/7 of a cup. For UK bakers, a metric cup is 250 ml, making 35 ml roughly 0.14 cups. Using a kitchen scale can also help—35 ml of condensed milk weighs about 45 grams.</p>  
<p>If you’re working with an air fryer, consider using a syringe or small measuring jug for accuracy. Many air fryer recipes, like those in the <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert category</a>, call for small amounts of condensed milk, so precision is crucial.</p>  

<h3>Common Uses for 35 ml of Condensed Milk</h3>  
<p>This small amount of condensed milk is often used in recipes like glazes, fillings, or drizzles. For example, a 35 ml portion is perfect for topping <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer pancakes</a> or adding richness to a coffee-based dessert. It’s also a key ingredient in many Asian-inspired sweets, where a little goes a long way.</p>  

<h2>Converting 35 ml of Condensed Milk in Different Countries</h2>  
<p>Measurement standards vary globally, which can cause confusion. In the UK, 35 ml of condensed milk is about 0.14 cups, while in the US, it’s closer to 0.15 cups. If you’re following a recipe from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>our conversion chart</a>, always check whether it uses metric or imperial measurements.</p>  
<p>For air fryer users, this small difference might not seem significant, but it can affect the final result. Always double-check your conversions, especially when working with condensed milk, as its thickness can make measuring by volume less precise.</p>  

<h3>Tips for Working with Condensed Milk in an Air Fryer</h3>  
<p>Condensed milk can caramelise quickly in an air fryer due to its high sugar content. To avoid burning, reduce cooking times or temperatures slightly when using it. For best results, mix 35 ml of condensed milk with other ingredients evenly, as clumping can lead to uneven cooking.</p>

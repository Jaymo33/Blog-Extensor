Whether you're making cookies, sauces, or marinades, knowing the exact weight helps maintain consistency. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we focus on making conversions effortless for home cooks. Keep reading to learn more about measuring peanut butter and other handy tips.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of peanut butter ensures your air fryer recipes turn out as intended. Too much or too little can affect texture, flavour, and cooking time. Peanut butter is dense, so volume-to-weight conversions like 1.33 cups to ounces are crucial. For more air fryer measurement tips, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>. Accurate measurements also help when scaling recipes up or down for meal prep.</p>  

<p>Many air fryer recipes, like peanut butter cookies or satay sauces, rely on precise peanut butter quantities. A slight variation can make baked goods too dry or sauces too thick. If you're experimenting with <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert recipes</a>, exact measurements ensure success. Measuring by weight (ounces) is often more reliable than volume (cups), especially for sticky ingredients like peanut butter.</p>  

<h3>How to measure peanut butter correctly</h3>  
<p>To measure 1.33 cups of peanut butter, use a dry measuring cup and level it off with a spatula. For even greater accuracy, a kitchen scale is ideal—simply weigh out 10.64 ounces. If your recipe calls for melted peanut butter, measure it before melting for consistency. Sticky ingredients can be tricky, so lightly greasing the measuring cup helps release the peanut butter easily.</p>

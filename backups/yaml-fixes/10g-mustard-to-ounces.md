<h2>Why accurate mustard measurements matter in air frying</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of mustard can make or break your air fryer dish. Too little, and your marinade might lack depth; too much, and it could overpower other flavours. Mustard acts as both a seasoning and a binding agent in recipes like crispy chicken or roasted vegetables. For perfectly balanced dishes, always measure ingredients like mustard precisely. Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> for inspiration on using mustard in your cooking.</p>

<h3>How to measure 10g of mustard without scales</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have digital scales, you can still measure 10g of mustard (0.35 oz) using spoons. Roughly, one level tablespoon of mustard weighs around 15g, so two-thirds of a tablespoon will give you 10g. For smaller amounts, a teaspoon holds about 5g, so two teaspoons will get you close. Remember, mustard’s thickness can vary, so these are approximate measures.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for 10g of mustard in air fryer recipes</h2>  
<p>Mustard is incredibly versatile in air fryer cooking. A 10g portion works perfectly in marinades for chicken, pork, or tofu. It also adds a zesty touch to coatings for crispy fish or veggies. Try mixing 10g of mustard with honey for a quick glaze or with mayo for a dipping sauce.

Mustard also helps bind breadcrumbs to food, creating a crispier texture. Whether you’re cooking for one or meal prepping, precise measurements ensure delicious results.

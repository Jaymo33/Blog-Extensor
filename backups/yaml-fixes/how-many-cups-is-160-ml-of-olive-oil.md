<p>160 ml of olive oil equals approximately 0.68 cups. This conversion is essential for accurate cooking and baking, especially when using an air fryer where precise measurements can make or break a dish. Whether you're following a recipe from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> or improvising, knowing this conversion ensures consistent results.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Frying</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on precise ingredient ratios to achieve the perfect texture and flavour. Too much or too little olive oil can affect crispiness, browning, and overall taste. For example, recipes like air-fried vegetables or crispy chicken often call for a light coating of oil. Measuring 160 ml of olive oil correctly ensures your dishes aren’t greasy or dry.</p>  
<p>If you’re unsure about conversions, refer to our handy <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>. It covers common measurements, making it easier to adapt recipes. Whether you’re cooking for one or meal prepping, accuracy saves time and reduces waste.</p>  

<h2>How to Measure 160 ml of Olive Oil Without a Scale</h2>  
<p>Not everyone has a kitchen scale, but you can still measure 160 ml of olive oil accurately using cups. A standard US cup holds 240 ml, so 160 ml is roughly two-thirds of a cup. For UK measurements, a metric cup is 250 ml, making 160 ml about 0.64 cups.</p>  
<p>If you don’t have measuring cups, use a tablespoon. One tablespoon holds about 15 ml, so 160 ml equals roughly 10.5 tablespoons. This method works well for drizzling oil over <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>air-fried vegetables</a> or marinating proteins.</p>  

<h3>Common Recipes Using 160 ml of Olive Oil</h3>  
<p>Many air fryer recipes use 160 ml of olive oil for dressings, marinades, or coatings. For example, crispy potatoes or roasted chickpeas often require this amount. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a> for inspiration.</p>  

<h2>Converting 160 ml of Olive Oil for Baking</h2>  
<p>Baking in an air fryer? 160 ml of olive oil replaces about 0.68 cups of butter or other fats. This substitution works well in cakes, muffins, and even bread. Olive oil adds moisture and a subtle flavour, perfect for <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>air-fryer cakes</a>.</p>  
<p>Remember, air fryers cook faster than conventional ovens, so adjust baking times accordingly. Always preheat your air fryer and use the right liners or inserts for even cooking.</p>  

<h3>Tips for Storing and Using Olive Oil</h3>  
<p>Store olive oil in a cool, dark place to preserve its quality. If you’ve measured 160 ml but don’t need it all, transfer the excess to an airtight container. Use it within a few weeks for the best flavour in your air-fryer dishes.</p>

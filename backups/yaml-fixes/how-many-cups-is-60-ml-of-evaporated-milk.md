<p>60 ml of evaporated milk equals approximately 0.25 cups (1/4 cup). This conversion is essential for baking and cooking, especially when using precise measurements for air fryer recipes. Whether you're making custards, cakes, or creamy sauces, knowing how to convert millilitres to cups ensures consistency. For more handy conversions, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Cooking</h2>  
<p>Using the correct amount of evaporated milk can make or break a recipe. Too little, and your dish might lack creaminess; too much, and it could become overly dense. This is especially important in air fryer cooking, where ingredient ratios affect texture and browning. Many of our favourite <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipes</a> rely on precise measurements for perfect results.</p>  

<p>Evaporated milk is thicker than regular milk, so measuring it accurately ensures your dishes turn out as intended. Whether you're making a savoury casserole or a sweet dessert, 60 ml (or 0.25 cups) is a common measurement in many recipes. For more baking tips, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>cake recipes</a>.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure 60 ml of Evaporated Milk</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a measuring jug, you can use a standard tablespoon. One tablespoon holds about 15 ml, so four tablespoons equal 60 ml (0.25 cups). Alternatively, a quarter-cup measuring cup will give you the exact amount needed. For more measurement hacks, visit <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>.</p>  

<h2>Common Recipes Using 60 ml of Evaporated Milk</h2>  
<p>Many air fryer recipes call for 60 ml of evaporated milk, including creamy pasta sauces, flans, and even some bread recipes. Its rich texture adds depth to dishes without the need for heavy cream. If you're looking for inspiration, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert recipes</a> feature plenty of ways to use this ingredient.</p>  

<p>For example, a classic pumpkin pie often requires 60 ml of evaporated milk to achieve the perfect custard-like filling. Similarly, mac and cheese made in the air fryer benefits from the creaminess of evaporated milk. Always measure carefully to ensure the best results.</p>  

<h3>Converting Other Measurements for Evaporated Milk</h3>  
<p>If your recipe calls for a different amount, here’s a quick reference: 120 ml equals 0.5 cups, and 240 ml equals 1 cup. Keeping these conversions in mind simplifies baking and cooking.

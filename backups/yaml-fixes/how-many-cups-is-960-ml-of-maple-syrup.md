<p>960 ml of maple syrup equals approximately 4.06 cups. This conversion is essential for baking, cooking, or using your air fryer, where precise measurements can make or break a recipe. Whether you're whipping up a glaze for air-fried salmon or sweetening a dessert, knowing how to convert 960 ml of maple syrup to cups ensures consistency and delicious results.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter</h2>
<p>When working with maple syrup, even small measurement errors can affect texture and flavour. Too much syrup can make dishes overly sweet or sticky, while too little might leave them bland. For air fryer recipes, like glazed carrots or sticky wings, the right balance is key. That’s why converting 960 ml of maple syrup to cups accurately is so important.</p>
<p>At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we emphasise precision in every recipe. Whether you're using UK or US cup measurements, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> can help you nail the perfect ratios every time. Maple syrup’s thickness also means it’s best measured in liquid cups for accuracy.</p>

<h2>Converting 960 ml of Maple Syrup to Cups</h2>

<p>If you’re in the UK, note that metric measurements are standard, but many recipes still use cups. For convenience, keep a measuring jug with both ml and cup markings handy. This is especially useful for recipes like maple-glazed <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>air fryer chicken</a> or sweet desserts.</p>

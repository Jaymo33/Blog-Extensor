<h2>Why accurate flour measurements matter</h2>  
<p>Baking is a science, and even small measurement errors can lead to dry, dense, or unevenly cooked results. When using an air fryer, precise flour quantities ensure crispy coatings without sogginess. For example, 1.75 cups of flour to ounces translates to 7.4 oz, which is crucial for recipes like air-fried chicken or homemade doughnuts.

<p>Different types of flour (plain, self-raising, or wholemeal) have slightly varying weights per cup. However, the standard conversion for 1.75 cups of flour in ounces remains reliable for most baking needs. Always spoon flour into measuring cups rather than scooping to avoid compacting it.

<h3>Converting 1.75 cups of flour to ounces</h3>  
<p>The easiest way to convert 1.75 cups flour to oz is to remember that 1 cup of flour weighs roughly 4.25 oz. Multiplying this by 1.75 gives you 7.4 oz. This conversion works for UK recipes, though US cups differ slightly. If you’re adapting a recipe from grams, 1.75 cups of flour equals about 210 grams.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for 1.75 cups of flour in air fryers</h2>  
<p>Many air fryer recipes call for 1.75 cups of flour, especially for batters and coatings.

<h3>Tips for measuring flour without scales</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a kitchen scale, use the spoon-and-level method to measure 1.75 cups of flour in ounces. Gently spoon flour into the cup until heaping, then level with a knife. Avoid tapping the cup, as this compacts the flour and leads to over-measuring. For best results, stick to standard UK measuring cups.</p>

<p>0.75 cups of lentils equals approximately 150 grams. This conversion is essential for air fryer cooking, where precise measurements can make or break a recipe. Whether you're preparing a hearty lentil stew or crispy air-fried lentil snacks, knowing the exact gram equivalent ensures consistency. For more air fryer measurement tips, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Lentil Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Accurate measurements are crucial when cooking lentils in an air fryer. Too many lentils can overcrowd the basket, leading to uneven cooking, while too few may dry out. Converting 0.75 cups of lentils to grams (150g) helps maintain the right texture and flavour. This is especially important for recipes like air-fried lentil patties or roasted lentils, where precision ensures crispiness without burning. Visit <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>our recipe collection</a> for inspiration.</p>  

<p>Lentils come in different varieties, such as green, red, and brown, but the weight per cup remains relatively consistent. However, slight variations may occur based on packing density. For best results, use a kitchen scale to measure 150 grams directly. This eliminates guesswork and guarantees perfect results every time.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure 0.75 Cups of Lentils Without a Scale</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a kitchen scale, you can still measure 0.75 cups of lentils accurately. Fill a measuring cup to the three-quarter mark, ensuring the lentils are level and not packed down. This method works well for most lentil types, though a scale is always more precise.

<h2>Common Uses for 0.75 Cups of Lentils in Air Fryers</h2>  
<p>0.75 cups (150g) of lentils is a versatile quantity for air fryer recipes. You can use them to make crispy lentil falafels, roasted lentil snacks, or even as a protein boost in air-fried veggie mixes. The key is to pre-soak or parboil the lentils for even cooking. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/meal-prep>meal prep ideas</a> for lentil-based dishes.</p>  

<p>Another great option is air-fried lentil burgers, where 150g of lentils provides the perfect base. Combine them with spices and breadcrumbs, then air-fry for a crispy exterior and tender interior. For cleaning tips after cooking, see our guide on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer maintenance</a>.</p>  

<h3>Adjusting Cooking Times for Lentils in Air Fryers</h3>  
<p>Since 0.75 cups of lentils weigh 150 grams, adjust cooking times based on the recipe. Pre-cooked lentils may need only 10-15 minutes, while raw lentils require longer. Always shake the basket midway for even crisping. Experiment with flavours like garlic or paprika for added depth.</p>

This conversion is essential for baking, especially when using an air fryer for desserts like cakes or cookies. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we know precise measurements make all the difference in achieving the perfect texture and sweetness.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Using the correct amount of icing sugar ensures your baked goods have the right consistency and flavour. Too much can make desserts overly sweet or dry, while too little may leave them lacking in texture.

<h2>How to Measure Icing Sugar Without Scales</h2>  
<p>If you don’t have a kitchen scale, fluff the icing sugar with a fork before spooning it into a measuring cup. Level it off with a knife for the most accurate 350 grams of icing sugar in cups. This method prevents packing too much sugar into the cup, which can throw off your recipe.</p>

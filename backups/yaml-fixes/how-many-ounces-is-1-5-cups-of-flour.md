<p>1.5 cups of flour equals approximately 6.6 ounces (187 grams) when using standard UK measurements. This conversion is essential for baking and air frying, where precision matters. Whether you're making air fryer cakes or breaded chicken, accurate flour measurements ensure consistent results every time.</p>

<h2>Why accurate flour measurements matter</h2>
<p>Getting your flour measurements right can make or break a recipe. Too much flour leads to dense, dry bakes, while too little results in soggy or crumbly textures. This is especially important in air frying, where even cooking relies on proper ingredient ratios. Visit <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes</a> for perfectly measured air fryer recipes.</p>

<p>Different types of flour have slightly different weights, but all-purpose flour is the standard for these conversions. If you're using self-raising or wholemeal flour, you might need slight adjustments. Always spoon flour into measuring cups rather than scooping to avoid compacting it.</p>

<h3>Converting cups to ounces for UK bakers</h3>
<p>While many UK recipes use grams, some still reference cups. The UK cup measurement is slightly different from the US cup, holding 250ml versus 240ml. However, for flour, the weight difference is minimal - about 0.1 ounces per 1.5 cups. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> helps with all your measurement needs.</p>

<h2>How to measure 1.5 cups of flour accurately</h2>
<p>The most accurate way to measure flour is by weight using digital scales. If you don't have scales, use the spoon-and-level method: gently spoon flour into the measuring cup, then level off the top with a knife. Never pack flour down or tap the cup, as this adds extra ounces unintentionally.</p>

<p>For air fryer cooking, especially when making coatings or batters, precise flour measurements ensure even crisping. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>air fryer chicken recipes</a> for perfect flour-to-coating ratios every time.</p>

<h3>Common recipes using 1.5 cups of flour</h3>
<p>Many air fryer recipes call for about 1.5 cups of flour. This amount is perfect for coating 4-6 chicken pieces, making a small batch of cookies, or creating light batter for fish. The 6.6 ounce measurement works well for most standard recipes without needing adjustment.</p>

<h2>Adjusting for different flour types</h2>
<p>While all-purpose flour weighs about 4.4 ounces per cup, other flours vary. Whole wheat flour is denser at about 4.8 ounces per cup, while cake flour is lighter at 4 ounces per cup. When converting 1.5 cups to ounces, these differences matter for perfect results in your air fryer creations.</p>

<p>For cleaning up after flour-heavy recipes, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner guide</a> helps maintain your appliance. Flour can create stubborn residues if not cleaned properly after cooking.</p>

<h3>Tips for measuring without scales</h3>
<p>If you need to measure 1.5 cups of flour without scales, use proper dry measuring cups (not liquid ones). Fill the cup loosely, then level with a straight edge. Remember that 1.5 cups equals 3 half-cup measures or 12 tablespoons. For most air fryer recipes, this method works well enough for good results.</p>

<p>0.375 cup of soy milk equals 3 ounces (oz) in the UK measurement system. This conversion is essential for precise cooking, especially when using an air fryer where ingredient ratios matter. Whether you’re whipping up a creamy sauce or baking a dairy-free dessert, knowing this measurement ensures consistency. For more air fryer conversions, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on even cooking, and incorrect measurements can throw off textures and flavours. Soy milk, often used as a dairy substitute, needs precise amounts to avoid overly dry or soggy results. A 0.375 cup measurement translates neatly to 3 oz, making it easy to scale recipes. If you’re experimenting with plant-based ingredients, accuracy ensures your dish turns out perfectly every time. Visit <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> for more tips on perfecting air fryer meals.</p>  

<p>Many air fryer recipes call for small quantities like 0.375 cup of soy milk, especially in desserts or batters. Measuring correctly helps maintain the right moisture balance, crucial for crispy or tender outcomes. Whether you’re making vegan pancakes or a creamy dip, 3 oz of soy milk is the golden measurement. For recipe ideas, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> collection.</p>  

<h3>How to measure 0.375 cup of soy milk without a scale</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a kitchen scale, use a liquid measuring cup marked in cups and ounces. Fill it to the 0.375 cup line, which is halfway between 1/4 and 1/2 cup. Alternatively, 3 fluid ounces (fl oz) also equals 0.375 cup, so a standard shot glass or small jug can work in a pinch. For more measurement hacks, browse our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert recipes</a> section.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for 0.375 cup of soy milk in air fryer recipes</h2>  
<p>This quantity is perfect for small-batch recipes, like single-serving cakes or coatings. For example, a vegan batter for onion rings or tempura might call for 0.375 cup of soy milk to bind the crumbs. It’s also ideal for creamy sauces drizzled over air-fried veggies or tofu. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/tofu>tofu recipes</a> for inspiration.</p>  

<p>Another popular use is in dairy-free scrambled eggs or quiches made in the air fryer. The 3 oz measurement ensures the right consistency without making the dish too watery. If you’re meal prepping, knowing this conversion saves time and reduces waste.

<h3>Converting other soy milk quantities to ounces</h3>  
<p>If your recipe scales up or down, here’s a quick reference: 1 cup of soy milk equals 8 oz, so 0.5 cup is 4 oz, and 0.25 cup is 2 oz. This makes 0.375 cup (3 oz) a handy midpoint for smaller servings. Always use UK fluid ounces for accuracy in British recipes.</p>

<p>0.33 cup of chickpeas equals approximately 2.64 ounces (74.8 grams). This measurement is essential for air fryer recipes, ensuring your dishes turn out perfectly every time. Whether you're making crispy roasted chickpeas or adding them to a hearty meal, accurate measurements are key. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we understand the importance of precision in cooking, especially when using an air fryer.</p>

<h3>How to Measure 0.33 Cup of Chickpeas</h3>  
<p>Measuring 0.33 cup of chickpeas is simple with the right tools. Use a dry measuring cup and level off the top for accuracy. If you don't have a 1/3 cup measure, fill a 1/4 cup and add a tablespoon. For best results, weigh your chickpeas using a kitchen scale to confirm 2.64 ounces.</p>  

<h2>Using Chickpeas in Your Air Fryer</h2>  
<p>Chickpeas shine in the air fryer, becoming crispy and golden with minimal oil. Start by rinsing and drying them thoroughly to ensure even cooking.

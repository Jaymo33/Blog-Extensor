<p>3 cups of rolled barley equals approximately 24 ounces (680 grams). This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes, ensuring you get the perfect texture and consistency every time. Whether you're making a hearty breakfast or a wholesome side dish, knowing the exact weight helps avoid under or over-measuring.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Precision is key when using an air fryer, as uneven measurements can lead to inconsistent results. Rolled barley, a nutritious whole grain, requires the right balance of moisture and heat to cook perfectly. Too much barley can overcrowd the air fryer basket, while too little may dry out quickly. For more air fryer tips, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> to simplify your cooking process.</p>  

<p>Many air fryer recipes, like our popular <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>barley-stuffed peppers</a>, rely on precise measurements for the best outcome. Rolled barley expands slightly during cooking, so starting with the correct weight ensures even cooking and optimal flavour. If you're new to air frying, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/breakfast>breakfast recipes</a> are a great place to start experimenting with this versatile grain.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure Rolled Barley Correctly</h3>  
<p>For the most accurate conversion from cups to ounces, use a kitchen scale. Scoop the rolled barley into a measuring cup without packing it down, then level it off with a straight edge. This method prevents over-pouring and guarantees consistency. If you don’t have a scale, remember that 1 cup of rolled barley is roughly 8 ounces, so 3 cups equal 24 ounces.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for Rolled Barley in Air Fryer Recipes</h2>  
<p>Rolled barley is a fantastic ingredient for air fryer meals, adding fibre and a nutty flavour. Try it in grain bowls, as a coating for chicken, or mixed into veggie patties. For inspiration, browse our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable-based recipes</a> that pair perfectly with barley. Its chewy texture holds up well under high heat, making it ideal for crispy toppings or fillings.</p>  

<p>Cleaning your air fryer after cooking barley is simple with our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>recommended cleaner</a>. Since barley can leave slight residue, a quick wipe-down ensures your appliance stays in top condition. Whether you're meal prepping or cooking for one, rolled barley’s versatility shines in the air fryer.</p>  

<h3>Adjusting Cooking Times for Rolled Barley</h3>  
<p>When converting 3 cups of rolled barley to ounces, consider adjusting your air fryer’s cooking time. Heavier batches may need a few extra minutes, while lighter ones cook faster. Always shake the basket halfway through to ensure even crisping.

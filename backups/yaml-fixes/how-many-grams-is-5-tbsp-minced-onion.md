<p>5 tablespoons (tbsp) of minced onion equals approximately 30 grams (g). This conversion is handy when following air fryer recipes that require precise measurements for the best results. Whether you're making a savoury stir-fry or a flavourful marinade, knowing the exact weight ensures consistency in your cooking. For more air fryer measurement tips, visit <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>our conversion chart</a>.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on even heat distribution, and incorrect ingredient quantities can affect texture and taste. Too much minced onion, for example, might make your dish overly pungent or soggy. Conversely, too little could leave it bland. By converting 5 tbsp of minced onion to grams, you ensure balanced flavours and perfect cooking times. Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> for inspiration on using minced onion effectively.</p>  

<p>Many UK recipes list minced onion in tablespoons, but weighing ingredients is often more precise. A kitchen scale eliminates guesswork, especially for dishes like air-fried onion rings or stuffed mushrooms. If you're new to air frying, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning guide</a> to keep your appliance in top condition.</p>  

<h3>How to measure minced onion correctly</h3>  
<p>For the most accurate conversion of 5 tbsp minced onion to grams, lightly pack the onion into the spoon without compressing it. Overpacking can add extra weight, skewing your recipe. If you don’t have a scale, remember that 1 tbsp of minced onion is roughly 6 grams. This rule of thumb works well for most <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable-based recipes</a>.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for minced onion in air fryer recipes</h2>  
<p>Minced onion adds depth to dishes like air-fried meatballs, stuffed peppers, or homemade onion bhajis. Since 5 tbsp equals about 30 grams, you can easily adjust quantities for larger batches. For example, doubling a recipe would require 60 grams (or 10 tbsp) of minced onion. Find more ideas in our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/beef>beef recipes section</a>.</p>  

<p>If you're reheating pre-prepared meals in the air fryer, minced onion can revive flavours. Sprinkle a teaspoon (about 2 grams) over leftovers before reheating for a fresh taste. Always store minced onion in an airtight container to maintain its potency. For more tips, browse <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>.</p>  

<h3>Converting other minced onion measurements</h3>  
<p>If your recipe calls for cups instead of tablespoons, 1 cup of minced onion is roughly 160 grams. This means 5 tbsp (30g) is just under a quarter cup. Keeping these conversions in mind simplifies scaling recipes up or down. For precise measurements, invest in a digital kitchen scale—it’s a game-changer for air fryer cooking.</p>

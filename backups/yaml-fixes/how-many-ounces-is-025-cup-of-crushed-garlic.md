<p>0.25 cup of crushed garlic equals approximately 1.5 ounces (42.5 grams). This measurement is essential for air fryer recipes where precise garlic quantities can make or break a dish. Whether you're whipping up garlic-infused chicken or roasted vegetables, knowing this conversion ensures consistent flavour every time.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate garlic measurements matter</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of crushed garlic is crucial for balancing flavours in air fryer recipes. Too little, and your dish might lack depth; too much, and it can overpower other ingredients. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we recommend measuring garlic by weight rather than volume for the most reliable results. This is especially important when preparing garlic-heavy dishes like our popular <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>garlic butter chicken</a>.</p>  

<p>Crushed garlic's density can vary based on how finely it's prepared, which is why weight measurements are more accurate than cup measurements. For consistent results in your air fryer, we suggest investing in a small kitchen scale. This tool will help you nail the perfect 1.5-ounce portion every time you need 0.25 cup of crushed garlic.</p>  

<h3>Converting cups to ounces for different garlic preparations</h3>  
<p>While 0.25 cup of crushed garlic equals 1.5 ounces, other garlic preparations have different weights. Minced garlic is slightly lighter at about 1.25 ounces per 0.25 cup, while garlic paste can be denser. Always refer to our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for precise measurements across different ingredients.</p>  

<h2>How to measure crushed garlic for air fryer recipes</h2>  
<p>The easiest way to measure 0.25 cup of crushed garlic is to use a liquid measuring cup for sticky ingredients. Pack the garlic lightly without compressing it too much, then level off the top with a straight edge. For those who prefer weight measurements, simply tare your scale with an empty bowl and add garlic until it reaches 1.5 ounces.</p>  

<p>When preparing multiple air fryer dishes, consider pre-measuring your garlic to save time. Many of our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer meal prep recipes</a> benefit from having ingredients measured in advance. Store any extra crushed garlic in an airtight container in the fridge for up to two weeks, or freeze it in 0.25 cup portions for future use.</p>  

<h3>Common air fryer recipes using 0.25 cup crushed garlic</h3>  
<p>Several delicious air fryer dishes call for approximately 0.25 cup of crushed garlic. Our garlic parmesan potatoes, roasted garlic mushrooms, and garlic butter shrimp all use this measurement as a key flavour component. For vegetarian options, try our garlic-roasted cauliflower or garlic-infused tofu from our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/tofu>tofu recipe collection</a>.</p>  

<h2>Tips for working with crushed garlic in air fryers</h2>  
<p>When using 0.25 cup of crushed garlic in air fryer recipes, distribute it evenly to prevent burning. Garlic can become bitter if exposed to direct high heat for too long. Mix it with a small amount of oil before adding to other ingredients, or place it underneath proteins to protect it from direct heat.</p>  

<p>After cooking garlic-heavy dishes, clean your air fryer promptly to prevent lingering odours. Our guide to <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaning</a> offers simple solutions for removing garlic smells. Remember that proper maintenance ensures your air fryer continues to produce perfectly cooked meals every time.</p>

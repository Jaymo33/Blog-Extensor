<p>150 grams of brown sugar equals approximately 5.29 ounces. This conversion is essential for anyone using an air fryer to bake or cook, ensuring precise measurements for perfect results. Whether you're making cookies, cakes, or glazes, knowing how to convert grams to ounces can make all the difference. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we understand the importance of accuracy in recipes, especially when using an air fryer where measurements can affect cooking times and textures.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Recipes</h2>  
<p>Using the correct amount of brown sugar ensures your air fryer recipes turn out just right. Too much sugar can cause burning or uneven cooking, while too little might leave your dish lacking in flavour. Brown sugar, in particular, adds moisture and depth to baked goods, so getting the measurement spot-on is crucial. For more air fryer baking tips, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> to simplify your cooking process.</p>  

<p>Many UK recipes use grams, while others rely on ounces, so knowing how to switch between the two is a handy skill. If you're working with a recipe from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>our collection</a>, this conversion will help you adapt measurements effortlessly. Whether you're making sticky toffee pudding or a savoury glaze, 150g of brown sugar translates to roughly 5.29 ounces.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure Brown Sugar Correctly</h3>  
<p>Brown sugar should be packed firmly into your measuring cup or spoon for accuracy. Unlike granulated sugar, it tends to clump, so pressing it down ensures you get the right amount. If you're using scales, simply weigh out 150g, which is equivalent to 5.29 ounces. For more precision, digital kitchen scales are a great investment for air fryer cooking.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for 150g of Brown Sugar in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>This measurement is often found in recipes for cookies, cakes, and marinades. For example, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cookies>cookie recipes</a> frequently call for 150g of brown sugar to achieve that perfect chewiness. It’s also great for glazing meats or adding sweetness to air-fried desserts like apple crisps or banana bread.</p>  

<p>If you're experimenting with your own creations, remember that 150g of brown sugar (5.29 oz) will caramelise beautifully in the air fryer, adding rich flavour to dishes. For cleaning sticky residues left behind, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner guide</a> has handy tips to keep your appliance in top condition.</p>  

<h3>Converting Other Sugar Measurements</h3>  
<p>If your recipe calls for a different amount, the same principle applies: 1 gram of brown sugar equals roughly 0.035 ounces. So, 100g would be 3.53 ounces, and 200g would be 7.05 ounces. Keeping a conversion chart handy can save time and ensure consistency in your air fryer cooking.</p>

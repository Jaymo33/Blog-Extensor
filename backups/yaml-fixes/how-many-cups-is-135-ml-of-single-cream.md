<p>135 ml of single cream is approximately 0.57 cups. This conversion is essential for anyone using recipes that require precise measurements, especially when working with air fryers where ingredient ratios can affect cooking times and textures. Whether you're whipping up a creamy sauce or baking a dessert, knowing how to convert millilitres to cups ensures consistency in your dishes.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on precise ingredient ratios to deliver perfectly cooked meals. Using too much or too little single cream can alter the texture and taste of your dish. For example, adding 135 ml of single cream instead of the correct cup measurement might make a sauce too runny or a cake too dense. Consistency is key, especially when following recipes from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>.</p>  

<p>Many air fryer recipes, like those in our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipes section</a>, call for single cream in specific quantities. Measuring 135 ml accurately ensures your dishes turn out as intended. If you're unsure about conversions, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> can be a handy reference.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure 135 ml of Single Cream Without a Measuring Cup</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a measuring cup, you can still measure 135 ml of single cream using tablespoons. One tablespoon holds about 15 ml, so 135 ml equals roughly 9 tablespoons. This method is handy for quick adjustments, though a measuring cup is always more precise for baking.</p>

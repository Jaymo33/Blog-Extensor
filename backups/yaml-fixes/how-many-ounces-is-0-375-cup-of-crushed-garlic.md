Air fryer enthusiasts love this precision, especially when adapting stovetop recipes. Need a quick garlic bread side? This measurement helps nail the flavour every time.</p>  

<h3>Why Accurate Garlic Measurements Matter</h3>

<h3>Tips for Measuring Crushed Garlic</h3>  
<p>To measure 0.375 cup of crushed garlic, lightly pack it into a measuring cup without pressing too hard. Overpacking can skew the weight, leading to more than 3 ounces. For sticky minced garlic, a spatula helps scrape every bit into your air fryer basket. This technique works wonders for dishes like garlic butter salmon or roasted vegetables.</p>

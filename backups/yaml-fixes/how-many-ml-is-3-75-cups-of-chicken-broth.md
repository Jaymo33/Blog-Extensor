<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on precise ingredient ratios to achieve the perfect texture and flavour. Too much or too little liquid, like chicken broth, can affect cooking times and outcomes. For example, adding 887.21 ml (3.75 cups) of broth to a marinade or sauce ensures even distribution and optimal moisture. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more handy measurements.</p>  

<p>Many air fryer recipes, especially those for soups or stews, call for chicken broth. Using the correct millilitre measurement guarantees the dish isn’t too watery or dry.

<h3>How to Measure 3.75 Cups of Chicken Broth Without a Measuring Cup</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a measuring cup, you can use a kitchen scale. One cup of chicken broth weighs about 240 grams, so 3.75 cups would be roughly 900 grams.

<h2>Converting Cups to ml for Different Ingredients</h2>  
<p>While 3.75 cups of chicken broth is 887.21 ml, other liquids may vary slightly due to density. For instance, water and broth have similar densities, but thicker liquids like cream will differ. Always double-check conversions for accuracy, especially when adapting recipes for your air fryer.</p>

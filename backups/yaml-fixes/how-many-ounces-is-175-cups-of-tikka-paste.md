<p>1.75 cups of tikka paste equals approximately 14 ounces. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes, where precise measurements can make or break your dish. Whether you're marinating chicken or prepping a batch of lamb, knowing the exact weight ensures consistent results every time.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>
<p>Air fryers rely on even heat distribution, and incorrect measurements can lead to uneven cooking. For example, using too much tikka paste might make your dish overly spicy or soggy, while too little could leave it bland. That's why converting 1.75 cups of tikka paste to ounces (14 oz) is so important. You can find more handy conversions on our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>

<p>Many air fryer recipes, like our popular <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken tikka</a>, call for specific amounts of paste to achieve the perfect balance of flavours. Measuring by weight (ounces) is often more accurate than volume (cups), especially for thick ingredients like tikka paste. This precision ensures your meals turn out just right, whether you're cooking for one or meal prepping for the week.</p>

<h2>How to Measure 1.75 Cups of Tikka Paste</h2>
<p>If you don't have a measuring cup handy, you can use a kitchen scale to weigh out 14 ounces of tikka paste. Simply place your container on the scale, tare it to zero, and spoon in the paste until you reach the desired weight. This method is particularly useful for sticky or dense ingredients that might not level neatly in a cup.</p>

<p>For those who prefer using cups, 1.75 cups is equivalent to 1 cup plus 3/4 cup. Use a liquid measuring cup for the most accurate results, and level off the top with a straight edge. Remember, the density of tikka paste can vary slightly between brands, so weighing it removes any guesswork. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a> for more measurement tips and tricks.</p>

<h3>Common Uses for 1.75 Cups (14 oz) of Tikka Paste</h3>
<p>This quantity is perfect for marinating 1-1.5 kg of protein, whether you're cooking chicken, lamb, or tofu in your air fryer. It's also ideal for batch cooking â€“ divide the paste into portions and freeze for future use. Many of our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/meal-prep>meal prep recipes</a> call for this exact amount to streamline your cooking process.</p>

<h3>Adjusting Recipes for Different Quantities</h3>
<p>If your recipe calls for more or less than 1.75 cups of tikka paste, you can easily scale the measurements. For example, half this amount would be 0.875 cups (7 oz), while double would be 3.5 cups (28 oz). Always adjust cooking times accordingly when changing quantities in your air fryer. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning guide</a> can help you maintain your appliance after cooking with sticky ingredients like tikka paste.</p>

<h2>Tips for Working with Tikka Paste in Your Air Fryer</h2>
<p>When using 1.75 cups of tikka paste (14 oz) in your air fryer, consider lining the basket with parchment paper to prevent sticking. The high sugar content in many tikka pastes can caramelize and adhere to the basket if not properly prepared. Always preheat your air fryer for 2-3 minutes before adding marinated ingredients for best results.</p>

<p>For even cooking, arrange items in a single layer and shake the basket halfway through cooking time. This ensures all surfaces get equal exposure to the hot air circulation. If you're cooking larger quantities that require multiple batches, keep cooked portions warm in a low oven while you finish the rest. Proper measurement of your 1.75 cups (14 oz) of tikka paste is just the first step to air fryer success!</p>

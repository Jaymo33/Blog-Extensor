<p>20g of almond milk is approximately 0.71 ounces. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precision matters, especially when baking or preparing sauces. Whether you’re making a creamy dessert or a light breakfast, knowing how to convert grams to ounces ensures your dish turns out perfectly every time.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on precise ingredient ratios to deliver consistent results, especially for recipes like cakes or custards. Almond milk, often used as a dairy substitute, requires accurate measurement to avoid overly dry or runny textures. A slight variation in liquid quantities can affect cooking times and final dish quality, making conversions like 20g almond milk to ounces crucial.</p>  

<p>For example, if you’re following a recipe from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, getting the almond milk measurement right ensures your dish matches the intended flavour and texture. Whether you’re meal prepping or experimenting with new recipes, a reliable conversion chart simplifies the process.</p>  

<h3>How to measure 20g of almond milk without scales</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a kitchen scale, you can use volume measurements to approximate 20g of almond milk. One tablespoon of almond milk weighs roughly 15g, so 20g is just over 1.3 tablespoons. For UK cooks, this translates to about 0.71 ounces, a handy reference when using air fryer recipes that list ingredients in grams or ounces.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for almond milk in air fryer recipes</h2>  
<p>Almond milk is a versatile ingredient in air fryer cooking, often used in desserts like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>cakes</a> or breakfast items such as pancakes. Its light consistency makes it ideal for batters and sauces, while its subtle nutty flavour enhances both sweet and savoury dishes. Converting 20g almond milk to ounces ensures you’re adding just the right amount for balanced results.</p>  

<p>For savoury dishes, almond milk can be used in marinades or creamy sauces for <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken</a> or vegetables. Its low calorie count and dairy-free properties make it a popular choice for health-conscious cooks. Whether you’re baking or frying, precise measurements guarantee your dish turns out as intended.</p>  

<h3>Converting other almond milk quantities</h3>  
<p>If your recipe calls for larger or smaller amounts of almond milk, the same conversion principle applies. For instance, 50g of almond milk equals roughly 1.76 ounces, while 100g is about 3.53 ounces. Keeping a <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a> handy saves time and eliminates guesswork, especially when adapting recipes for your air fryer.</p>  

<h2>Tips for storing and using almond milk</h2>  
<p>To maintain freshness, store almond milk in the fridge and shake well before use, as separation is common. For air fryer recipes, room-temperature almond milk blends more evenly into batters and sauces. If you’re converting 20g almond milk to ounces frequently, consider pre-measuring portions for quicker meal prep.</p>

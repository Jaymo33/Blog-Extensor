<p>1.25 cups of semolina equals approximately 6.25 ounces (oz). This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precision matters, ensuring your dishes turn out perfectly every time. Whether you’re making crispy semolina-coated chicken or a fluffy semolina cake, knowing the exact weight helps avoid under or over-measuring. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we understand the importance of accurate measurements for consistent results. Let’s dive deeper into why this conversion matters and how to use it in your cooking.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on precise ingredient ratios to achieve the perfect texture and doneness. Too much semolina can make coatings overly thick, while too little may result in uneven crispiness. For example, when making semolina-crusted fish or chicken, 1.25 cups (6.25 oz) ensures a golden, crunchy exterior without excess dryness. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> simplifies these calculations, so you can focus on cooking. Consistency is key, especially when adapting traditional recipes for air fryer use.</p>  

<p>Semolina’s density can vary slightly depending on how it’s packed, so weighing it removes guesswork. A kitchen scale is the most reliable tool, but if you don’t have one, spooning the semolina into a measuring cup and leveling it off works too. For more tips on perfecting air fryer recipes, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a>, featuring everything from crispy snacks to hearty mains. Accurate measurements also help when scaling recipes up or down, ensuring your dishes turn out just right.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure 1.25 Cups of Semolina Without a Scale</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a scale, use the spoon-and-level method for the most accurate cup measurement. Gently spoon semolina into a dry measuring cup until it’s heaped, then level it off with a straight edge. Repeat this process until you’ve measured 1.25 cups (6.25 oz). Avoid packing the semolina down, as this can lead to over-measuring. For recipes like semolina pudding or air-fried falafel, precision ensures the right consistency. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert category</a> for sweet semolina treats.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for Semolina in Air Fryer Recipes</h2>  
<p>Semolina adds a delightful crunch to air-fried foods, from breaded meats to vegetable fritters. Coating chicken or fish with 1.25 cups (6.25 oz) of semolina creates a crispy, golden crust that holds up well in the air fryer’s high heat. It’s also a great binder for veggie patties or arancini, helping them stay intact during cooking. For inspiration, browse our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipes</a>, where semolina often plays a starring role. Experimenting with different textures and flavors is part of the fun!</p>  

<p>Beyond coatings, semolina works wonders in baked goods like air-fried cakes or cookies. Its coarse texture adds structure, while its mild flavor pairs well with sweet or savory ingredients. When converting traditional oven recipes to air fryer versions, adjusting measurements like 1.25 cups to ounces ensures success. Need help cleaning your air fryer after a semolina-heavy recipe?

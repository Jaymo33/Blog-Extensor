<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Precision is key when working with lemon juice, especially in recipes where acidity affects texture and taste. Too much or too little can alter the outcome of your dish. For example, in air fryer baking, the right amount ensures proper rising and flavour balance. If you're exploring new recipes, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a> has plenty of inspiration.</p>  

<p>Lemon juice is often used in marinades, dressings, and desserts. A slight variation in measurement can make a big difference. That’s why converting 285 ml of lemon juice to cups correctly is so important. Whether you're following a British or American recipe, this guide ensures you get it right.</p>  

<h3>UK vs. US Cup Measurements</h3>  
<p>In the UK, 1 cup equals 250 ml, while in the US, it's 240 ml. This means 285 ml of lemon juice is roughly 1.2 cups in the UK and 1.18 cups in the US. If you're using an air fryer for recipes, always double-check which measurement system your recipe follows.

<h2>How to Measure Lemon Juice Without a Scale</h2>  
<p>If you don’t have a measuring jug, you can use tablespoons or teaspoons to approximate 285 ml of lemon juice. One tablespoon holds about 15 ml, so you’d need roughly 19 tablespoons. For air fryer recipes, accuracy matters, so investing in a good measuring cup is wise. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning guide</a> to keep your tools in top shape.</p>  

<p>Another handy trick is to use a standard drinking glass, which often holds around 200-250 ml. Fill it slightly more than full to reach 285 ml. Remember, fresh lemon juice is always best for flavour, but bottled works in a pinch.

<p>235 ml of vegetable oil equals approximately 1 cup (or 0.99 cups to be precise). Whether you're using an air fryer or baking, accurate measurements ensure your dishes turn out perfectly every time. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we know how crucial conversions like these are for hassle-free cooking.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Frying</h2>  
<p>Getting the right amount of vegetable oil can make or break your air fryer recipes. Too little, and your food might stick or dry out. Too much, and you risk soggy results. That’s why converting 235 ml of vegetable oil to cups correctly is essential. Many air fryer recipes, like crispy chicken or roasted vegetables, rely on precise oil measurements for the best texture and flavour.</p>  
<p>If you're new to air frying, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for quick reference. It covers common measurements, so you’ll never second-guess your ingredients again. Whether you're making desserts or savoury dishes, knowing how much 235 ml of vegetable oil translates to in cups keeps your cooking consistent.</p>  

<h2>How to Measure 235 ml of Vegetable Oil Without a Scale</h2>  
<p>Not everyone has a kitchen scale, but most cooks have measuring cups handy. To measure 235 ml of vegetable oil without one, use a standard metric cup. Since 1 cup is roughly 240 ml, 235 ml is just shy of a full cup. For most recipes, this small difference won’t affect the outcome, but for precision, you can fill the cup just below the brim.</p>  
<p>If you're working with American recipes, note that US cups differ slightly (236.59 ml per cup). However, the difference is minimal, so 235 ml of vegetable oil still rounds to about 1 cup. For more air fryer tips, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a>, where we share foolproof methods for perfect meals every time.</p>  

<h3>Common Uses for 235 ml of Vegetable Oil in Air Frying</h3>  
<p>Many air fryer recipes call for around 235 ml (or 1 cup) of vegetable oil, especially for marinades or coating. For example, crispy tofu or battered fish often need this amount to achieve a golden finish. If you're prepping ahead, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/meal-prep>meal prep recipes</a> include oil measurements to streamline your cooking.</p>  

<h2>Converting Other Oil Measurements for Air Fryer Recipes</h2>  
<p>While 235 ml of vegetable oil is straightforward, other amounts might need converting too. For instance, 120 ml is half a cup, and 60 ml is a quarter cup. Keeping these conversions in mind helps when scaling recipes up or down. If you're unsure, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a> is a handy tool.</p>  
<p>For cleaning your air fryer after oily recipes, check out our guide on the <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>best air fryer cleaners</a>. Oil buildup can affect performance, so regular maintenance ensures your appliance lasts longer and cooks evenly.</p>  

<h3>Does the Type of Oil Affect the Measurement?</h3>  
<p>Whether you use vegetable, olive, or coconut oil, 235 ml will always equal roughly 1 cup. However, oils vary in density, so weight measurements differ. For air frying, vegetable oil is ideal due to its high smoke point and neutral flavour.</p>

<h2>How to measure single cream accurately</h2>  
<p>Measuring liquids like single cream can be tricky, but using a liquid measuring cup ensures precision. Pour the cream to the 1.5-cup mark, or weigh it on a kitchen scale for 12 ounces. This method eliminates guesswork and guarantees consistent results in your air fryer recipes.</p>

<h3>Common uses for single cream in air fryer cooking</h3>  
<p>Single cream is a versatile ingredient in air fryer recipes, from creamy pasta dishes to luscious desserts. Its rich texture enhances flavours and adds moisture, making it a staple in many dishes. Whether you’re making a custard or a savoury sauce, 1.5 cups (12 ounces) is often the perfect amount.</p>  

<h3>Converting other cream measurements</h3>  
<p>If your recipe calls for a different amount of single cream, here’s a quick guide: 1 cup = 8 ounces, 0.5 cup = 4 ounces, and 2 cups = 16 ounces. These conversions help you adapt recipes effortlessly. For more tips, visit <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>.</p>  

<h2>Tips for working with single cream in air fryers</h2>  
<p>Single cream can curdle if overheated, so it’s best added towards the end of cooking. When using 1.5 cups (12 ounces), stir it gently into hot dishes to maintain a smooth texture. This technique works well for creamy soups, sauces, and even desserts like crème brûlée.</p>  
<p>For cleaning your air fryer after cooking with creamy ingredients, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner guide</a> has you covered. Keeping your appliance clean ensures it performs at its best for every recipe.</p>  

<h3>Storing leftover single cream</h3>  
<p>If you have leftover single cream from your 1.5-cup (12-ounce) measurement, store it in an airtight container in the fridge. Use it within a few days for best results, or freeze it for longer storage. Thawed cream may separate, but it’s still great for cooking.</p>

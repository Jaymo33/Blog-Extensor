<p>2 tablespoons (tbsp) of cream weigh approximately 30 grams. This conversion is essential for precise cooking, especially when using an air fryer where ingredient ratios can affect texture and cooking times. Whether you're whipping up a creamy sauce or baking a dessert, knowing the exact weight ensures consistency. For more air fryer measurement tips, check out <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>our conversion chart</a>.</p>

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on even heat distribution, and incorrect measurements can lead to uneven cooking or overly dense textures. Cream, in particular, can vary in density depending on its fat content, so weighing it ensures accuracy. If you're making a dish like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>air fryer desserts</a>, precise grams prevent soggy or dry results. Always use a kitchen scale for best results, especially with liquids like cream.</p>  

<p>Many air fryer recipes call for small quantities, so converting tablespoons to grams eliminates guesswork. For example, a creamy pasta sauce or a light mousse requires exact proportions. Explore more <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> that benefit from precise cream measurements.</p>  

<h3>Types of cream and their weights</h3>  
<p>Not all creams weigh the same per tablespoon. Double cream is denser than single cream, so 2 tbsp may weigh closer to 35 grams. Always check the fat content if precision is crucial. For recipes like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>air fryer cakes</a>, this small difference can impact rise and moisture.</p>  

<h2>How to measure cream without scales</h2>  
<p>If you don’t have a scale, use the spoon-and-level method for semi-liquid ingredients like cream. Fill the tablespoon evenly without packing it down. For thicker creams, gently sweep off the excess with a knife. Remember, 2 tbsp of cream to grams is roughly 30g, but slight variations can occur.</p>  

<p>For sticky or thick creams, lightly grease the spoon first to ensure a clean release. This trick works well when prepping ingredients for <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/breakfast>air fryer breakfasts</a>. Keep your air fryer in top shape with <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>proper cleaning</a> to avoid residue buildup from creamy dishes.</p>  

<h3>Common recipes using 2 tbsp of cream</h3>  
<p>From creamy soups to indulgent desserts, 2 tbsp of cream is a versatile measurement. Try it in air fryer scrambled eggs or a rich carbonara. The 30-gram equivalent ensures your dish isn’t overly heavy or lacking richness.</p>

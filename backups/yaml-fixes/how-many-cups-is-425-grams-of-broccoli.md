<p>425 grams of broccoli is roughly equivalent to 4.5 to 5 cups when chopped, depending on how finely it’s cut. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes, where precise measurements can make all the difference. Whether you’re making crispy roasted broccoli or adding it to a stir-fry, knowing how many cups 425 grams of broccoli yields ensures consistent results. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we focus on making cooking conversions simple, so you can focus on creating delicious meals.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of broccoli ensures even cooking and prevents overcrowding in the air fryer basket. Overcrowding can lead to unevenly cooked veggies, with some pieces remaining soggy while others crisp up too much. For 425 grams of broccoli, spreading it out in a single layer is key to achieving that perfect crunch. If you’re unsure about other conversions, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for quick reference.</p>  

<p>Broccoli’s density can vary based on whether it’s florets or stems, so weighing it is the most accurate method. However, if you don’t have a scale, using the cup measurement for 425 grams of broccoli will still yield great results. For more recipe ideas, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetables category</a>, packed with air fryer-friendly dishes.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure 425 Grams of Broccoli Without a Scale</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a kitchen scale, you can estimate 425 grams of broccoli by filling a measuring cup. One cup of chopped broccoli typically weighs around 90-100 grams, so 4.5 to 5 cups should give you roughly 425 grams. Keep in mind that tightly packed broccoli will weigh more, so fluff it lightly for accuracy. This method works well for most air fryer recipes, ensuring you get the right portion every time.</p>  

<h2>Best Air Fryer Recipes Using 425 Grams of Broccoli</h2>  
<p>Once you’ve measured your 425 grams of broccoli, try tossing it with olive oil, garlic, and a pinch of salt before air frying at 180°C for 10-12 minutes. This simple method delivers crispy, flavourful broccoli every time. For more inspiration, browse our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipes section</a>, where you’ll find creative ways to use broccoli in your air fryer.</p>  

<p>Another great option is adding 425 grams of broccoli to a stir-fry or mixing it with other veggies for a hearty side dish. The air fryer locks in nutrients while giving broccoli a delicious texture. Don’t forget to check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning tips</a> to keep your appliance in top shape after cooking.</p>  

<h3>Adjusting Cooking Times for 425 Grams of Broccoli</h3>  
<p>Since 425 grams of broccoli fills about 4.5 to 5 cups, you may need to cook it in batches depending on your air fryer’s size. Cooking in smaller batches ensures even crisping and prevents steaming. If you’re short on time, shaking the basket halfway through helps distribute heat evenly. This technique works wonders for achieving that restaurant-quality crunch at home.</p>

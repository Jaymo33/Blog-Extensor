<h2>Understanding the Conversion</h2>
<p>Converting 335 ml of corn syrup to cups is straightforward once you know the ratio. One cup is equivalent to 236.59 ml, so dividing 335 ml by this number gives you roughly 1.42 cups. This measurement is crucial for recipes where accuracy matters, such as cakes or glazes for air fryer dishes.</p>

<h2>Why Accuracy Matters</h2>
<p>When working with corn syrup, even small measurement errors can affect the texture and taste of your dish.

<h3>Measuring Tools to Use</h3>
<p>To measure 335 ml of corn syrup accurately, use a liquid measuring cup with clear markings. Pour the syrup slowly to avoid air bubbles, which can skew the measurement. For sticky ingredients like corn syrup, lightly greasing the measuring cup can help it slide out easily.</p>

<h3>Adjusting Recipes for Different Quantities</h3>
<p>If your recipe calls for a different amount of corn syrup, you can scale the conversion accordingly. For example, 167.5 ml would be roughly 0.71 cups. Always double-check your measurements to avoid mistakes, especially when adapting recipes for your air fryer.</p>

<h2>Tips for Working with Corn Syrup</h2>
<p>Corn syrup can be sticky and messy, so here are some tips to handle it easily. Warm the syrup slightly before measuring to make it pour smoothly. Store it in a cool, dry place to maintain its quality, and always clean your air fryer after using sticky ingredients to prevent buildup.</p>

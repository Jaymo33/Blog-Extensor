<p>325 grams of broccoli is roughly equivalent to 3.5 to 4 cups when chopped. This measurement can vary slightly depending on how finely the broccoli is cut, but it's a reliable starting point for air fryer recipes. Whether you're making crispy roasted broccoli or adding it to a stir-fry, knowing this conversion ensures your dish turns out perfectly.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Precision is key when using an air fryer, as overcrowding or underfilling the basket can affect cooking times and results.

If you're following a recipe from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, getting the right amount of broccoli ensures the dish cooks as intended.

<h3>How to Measure Broccoli for Air Fryer Recipes</h3>  
<p>To measure 325 grams of broccoli in cups, start by chopping the florets into even-sized pieces. Pack them lightly into a measuring cup without pressing down too hard, as this can compress the broccoli and skew the measurement. If you're using a kitchen scale, weigh the broccoli first, then transfer it to cups for visual confirmation. This method ensures you get the right amount for your air fryer basket.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for 325 Grams of Broccoli</h2>  
<p>325 grams of broccoli is a great amount for many air fryer dishes. You could make crispy garlic parmesan broccoli, a quick stir-fry, or even a broccoli and cheese stuffed chicken breast.

<h3>Tips for Cooking Broccoli in the Air Fryer</h3>

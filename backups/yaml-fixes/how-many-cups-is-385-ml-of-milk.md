<p>385 ml of milk is approximately 1.63 cups in standard US measurements. If you're using UK metric cups, it's roughly 1.54 cups. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precision matters, especially in baking or creamy dishes like custards or sauces.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Milk Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Getting the right amount of milk ensures your recipes turn out perfectly. Too much or too little can affect texture, rise, and flavour. For air fryer cooking, precise measurements help avoid soggy or dry results. Whether you're making a cake or a creamy pasta sauce, 385 ml of milk converted correctly keeps things consistent. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more handy measurement swaps.</p>  

<p>Many air fryer recipes, like our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>air fryer cakes</a>, rely on exact liquid ratios. Milk adds moisture, and 385 ml is a common quantity in European recipes. Knowing the cup equivalent saves time and avoids kitchen mishaps.</p>  

<h3>US vs. UK Cup Measurements</h3>  
<p>The slight difference between US and UK cups matters when converting 385 ml of milk. US cups are 240 ml, while UK metric cups are 250 ml. For 385 ml, that’s 1.63 US cups or 1.54 UK cups. Always check your recipe’s origin to pick the right conversion.</p>  

<h2>How to Measure 385 ml of Milk Without a Scale</h2>  
<p>If you don’t have a measuring jug, use a standard cup and some maths. For 385 ml of milk, fill a US cup to the top (240 ml), then add another 145 ml (about half a cup plus two tablespoons). For UK cups, it’s one full cup (250 ml) plus 135 ml (roughly half a cup plus a tablespoon).</p>  

<p>For air fryer recipes like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>pancakes or muffins</a>, eyeballing isn’t ideal. Invest in a liquid measuring cup for accuracy. A small error in 385 ml of milk could mean dense baked goods or split sauces.</p>  

<h3>Common Recipes Using 385 ml of Milk</h3>  
<p>This quantity often appears in custards, béchamel sauces, or single-layer cakes. For example, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>air fryer crème brûlée</a> uses close to 385 ml of milk for the perfect creamy texture. It’s also handy for creamy pasta bakes or mashed potatoes.</p>  

<h2>Converting Other Milk Quantities</h2>  
<p>Once you master 385 ml of milk in cups, scaling up or down is easier. For 200 ml, it’s 0.85 US cups; for 500 ml, it’s 2.1 US cups. Bookmark our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion guide</a> for quick reference mid-recipe.</p>  

<p>Remember, air fryer cooking thrives on precision. Whether it’s 385 ml of milk or oil, correct measurements ensure crispy, even results.

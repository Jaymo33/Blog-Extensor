<p>1.5 tablespoons (tbsp) of marmalade weighs approximately 30 grams in the UK. This conversion is essential for precise baking or cooking, especially when using an air fryer where measurements matter. Whether you're making a glaze for meats or adding sweetness to desserts, knowing the exact weight ensures consistency. For more air fryer-friendly conversions, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on precise ingredient ratios to achieve perfect results. Too much or too little marmalade can affect texture and flavour. For instance, a sticky glaze might burn if over-applied, while too little won’t caramelise properly. Many <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> call for small quantities, making conversions like 1.5 tbsp marmalade to grams crucial. Consistency is key, whether you're cooking for one or meal prepping.</p>  

<p>Using a digital scale eliminates guesswork. While tablespoons measure volume, grams account for density, which varies between brands. Homemade marmalade, for example, might be chunkier than store-bought, affecting weight. For reliable results, always weigh ingredients when possible. Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert recipes</a> for inspiration on using marmalade in air fryer treats.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure 1.5 tbsp Marmalade Without Scales</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have scales, use levelled tablespoons for accuracy. Scoop marmalade and level off the excess with a knife. Note that 1.5 tbsp equals 22.5 ml, but weight remains the gold standard. For sticky ingredients like marmalade, lightly greasing the spoon helps release it cleanly. Need more tips? Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning guide</a> ensures your tools stay residue-free.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for 1.5 tbsp Marmalade in Air Fryer Recipes</h2>  
<p>Marmalade adds a citrusy sweetness to both savoury and sweet dishes. Glaze chicken or salmon with 1.5 tbsp (30g) for a caramelised finish, or swirl it into cake batters. In the air fryer, marmalade’s sugar content helps create crispy edges—ideal for <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/breakfast>breakfast recipes</a> like French toast. For a quick dessert, brush it over puff pastry before air frying.</p>  

<p>Experiment with flavours by adjusting the quantity. A heaped 1.5 tbsp (closer to 35g) intensifies sweetness, while a scant measure keeps it subtle. Pair marmalade with spices like ginger or chilli for depth. Looking for more ideas? Browse our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>cake recipes</a> for marmalade-infused bakes.</p>  

<h3>Converting Other Marmalade Quantities to Grams</h3>  
<p>Need to scale up or down? Here’s a quick reference: 1 tbsp marmalade ≈ 20g, 2 tbsp ≈ 40g, and 3 tbsp ≈ 60g. These conversions work for most UK brands, but always check labels for specifics. For larger batches, like jams for <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/meal-prep>meal prep</a>, weighing saves time and ensures uniformity.</p>

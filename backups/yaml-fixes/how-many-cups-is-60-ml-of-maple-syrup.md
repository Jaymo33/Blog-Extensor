<p>60 ml of maple syrup equals approximately 0.25 cups (or 1/4 cup). This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes, where precise measurements ensure the best texture and flavour. Whether you're making glazes, marinades, or baked goods, knowing how to convert millilitres to cups saves time and avoids kitchen mishaps.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on even heat distribution, so ingredient ratios must be spot-on. Too much or too little maple syrup can alter caramelisation, moisture, and cooking times. For example, a sticky glaze with 60 ml of maple syrup needs the right balance to avoid burning. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for other common measurements.</p>  

<p>Maple syrup’s thickness means it doesn’t pour like water, so measuring by volume (cups) is more practical than weight. A 60 ml portion fits neatly into a 1/4 cup measure, making it easy to scale recipes. For more air fryer-friendly recipes, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a>.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure 60 ml of Maple Syrup Without a Measuring Cup</h3>  
<p>No measuring cup? Use tablespoons: 60 ml equals 4 tablespoons (since 15 ml = 1 tbsp). Alternatively, fill a standard shot glass (usually 50 ml) and add an extra teaspoon (10 ml). For sticky ingredients like maple syrup, lightly grease the spoon or cup for cleaner pouring.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for 60 ml of Maple Syrup in Air Fryer Recipes</h2>  
<p>This amount is perfect for glazing salmon, sweetening oatmeal, or adding depth to roasted vegetables. Try it in our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/salmon>salmon recipes</a> for a caramelised finish. Since air fryers intensify flavours, 60 ml of maple syrup delivers just the right sweetness without overpowering.</p>  

<p>For baking, 60 ml (1/4 cup) of maple syrup can replace 50 grams of granulated sugar. Reduce other liquids in the recipe by 2 tablespoons to balance moisture. Discover more tips in our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert category</a>.</p>  

<h3>Does Maple Syrup Type Affect the Measurement?</h3>  
<p>All pure maple syrups (Grade A or B) have similar densities, so 60 ml equals 0.25 cups regardless of colour or flavour. However, artificial syrups may differ slightly due to added thickeners. Always check labels for consistency.</p>  

<h2>Converting 60 ml of Maple Syrup for UK and US Recipes</h2>  
<p>Both UK and US cups measure 240 ml, so 60 ml is 1/4 cup in either system. The difference lies in other ingredients (e.g., UK tablespoons are 15 ml vs. 14.8 ml in the US), but maple syrup conversions stay consistent.

<p>If scaling up, remember: 120 ml = 0.5 cups, 180 ml = 0.75 cups, and 240 ml = 1 cup. Keep a conversion cheat sheet handy—like our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning and maintenance guide</a>—to streamline cooking.</p>

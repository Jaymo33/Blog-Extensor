<h2>Special Considerations for Air Fryers</h2>
<p>Converting 253 c to gas mark uk measurements for air fryer use requires some special attention. Unlike traditional ovens, air fryers have much more concentrated heat distribution.

Just be sure to check packaging instructions as some frozen foods may have maximum recommended cooking temperatures.</p>

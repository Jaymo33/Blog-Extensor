Whether you're making sticky buns, glazes, or desserts, knowing how to convert 135 ml of corn syrup to cups simplifies your cooking process.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on precise ingredient ratios to achieve the best texture and flavour. Too much or too little corn syrup can alter the caramelisation, moisture, and overall taste of your dish. For example, a glaze with 135 ml of corn syrup in cups (0.57) ensures the right sweetness without overpowering other flavours. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more handy measurement tips.</p>  

<p>Many air fryer recipes, like our popular <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>sticky cinnamon rolls</a>, call for corn syrup to enhance texture and shine. Measuring 135 ml of corn syrup accurately guarantees consistent results, whether you're cooking for one or meal prepping for the week. If you're new to air frying, precise measurements help avoid common pitfalls like soggy or overly dry outcomes.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure 135 ml of Corn Syrup Without a Scale</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a kitchen scale, use a liquid measuring cup to measure 135 ml of corn syrup. Fill it to the 135 ml mark, then pour it into a dry measuring cup to see the cup equivalent (0.57). Corn syrup’s thick consistency means it won’t level like water, so scrape the excess with a spatula for accuracy.

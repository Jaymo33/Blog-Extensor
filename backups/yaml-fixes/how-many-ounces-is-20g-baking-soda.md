<p>20g of baking soda equals approximately 0.71 ounces. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes, where precise measurements can make or break your dish. Whether you're whipping up fluffy cakes or crispy snacks, knowing how to convert grams to ounces ensures consistency. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we simplify these conversions so you can focus on cooking. Let’s dive deeper into why this matters for your air fryer.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on precise ingredient ratios to achieve the perfect texture and flavour. Too much baking soda can leave a bitter taste, while too little might not give your baked goods the desired rise. Converting 20g of baking soda to ounces (0.71 oz) helps avoid these pitfalls. For more air fryer tips, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a>. Whether you're making cookies or savoury dishes, accuracy is key.</p>  

<p>Many UK recipes use grams, but if your kitchen scale measures in ounces, this conversion is a lifesaver. Baking soda is a leavening agent, so even small deviations can affect your results. For foolproof recipes, bookmark our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a>. From crispy chicken to fluffy cakes, we’ve got you covered with precise measurements.</p>  

<h2>How to measure 20g of baking soda without a scale</h2>  
<p>If you don’t have a scale, you can use measuring spoons to approximate 20g of baking soda. One level tablespoon holds about 15g, so 20g is roughly 1 tablespoon plus 1 teaspoon. However, for air fryer recipes, we recommend investing in a digital scale for accuracy. A slight mismeasurement can alter the texture of your dish, especially in baking.</p>  

<h3>Common uses for 20g of baking soda in air fryer recipes</h3>  
<p>Baking soda isn’t just for cakes—it’s a versatile ingredient in air fryer cooking. Use 20g (0.71 oz) to tenderise meats, crisp up veggies, or even clean your air fryer basket. For cleaning tips, visit our guide on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer maintenance</a>. From fluffy pancakes to golden fish fillets, baking soda plays a crucial role.</p>  

<h2>Converting other common baking ingredients</h2>  
<p>While 20g of baking soda equals 0.71 ounces, other ingredients have different conversions. For example, 20g of flour is about 0.7 oz, whereas 20g of sugar is closer to 0.71 oz. These small differences matter in air fryer recipes, where precision ensures even cooking. Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>cake recipes</a> for more measurement tips.</p>  

<p>If you’re scaling a recipe up or down, always double-check your conversions. A handy tip: 1 ounce equals roughly 28.35 grams, so 20g is just under three-quarters of an ounce.

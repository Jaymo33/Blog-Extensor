faqQ1: "Can I use 130 C fan oven temperature in my air fryer?"
faqA1: "Yes, you can use 130 C fan oven settings in most air fryers. The cooking time will typically be shorter due to the air fryer's more intense air circulation. Start checking your food about 20% earlier than the recipe suggests."
faqQ2: "How does 130 C in a fan oven compare to gas mark?"
faqA2: "130 C in a fan oven is roughly equivalent to gas mark 1/2 (between gas mark 1 and 2). However, gas ovens don't have fans, so the cooking characteristics will differ. Fan ovens at 130 C cook more evenly than gas ovens at similar temperatures."
faqQ3: "Why would I bake at 130 C in a fan oven instead of higher temperatures?"
faqA3: "Baking at 130 C fan is ideal for delicate items that might burn at higher heats, like meringues or cheesecakes. It's also perfect for slow-cooking meats to retain moisture or drying fruits and herbs without scorching them."
faqQ4: "Do I need to adjust cooking times when converting 130 C to fan oven?"
faqA4: "When converting from conventional to fan oven at 130 C, you generally don't need to adjust cooking times significantly. The fan circulates heat more efficiently, but the lower temperature compensates. However, always check food 5-10 minutes before the recipe's suggested time."

<p>130 C in a fan oven is equivalent to approximately 110 C in a conventional oven without the fan. This conversion is crucial for baking delicate items like cakes or biscuits where precise temperature control matters. When using an air fryer, you might need to adjust cooking times slightly as the rapid air circulation works similarly to a fan oven.</p>

<h2>Understanding Fan Oven Temperatures</h2>
<p>Fan ovens circulate hot air around the food, cooking it more evenly and often faster than conventional ovens. This means you typically need to reduce the temperature by 20 C when converting from a regular oven recipe. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we've found this rule holds true for most baking scenarios. The 130 C fan setting is particularly useful for slow-roasting vegetables or drying fruits.</p>
<p>Many modern recipes specifically state fan oven temperatures, but older cookbooks might only provide conventional oven settings. When you see 130 C in a fan oven recipe, you're seeing the actual temperature to use - no conversion needed. This differs from gas mark settings which follow a completely different scale. For perfect results, always check whether your recipe was developed for fan or conventional ovens.</p>

<h3>Air Fryer Equivalent to 130 C Fan</h3>
<p>Air fryers operate similarly to fan ovens but with more intense air circulation. For most foods, you can use the same 130 C fan oven temperature in your air fryer. However, cooking times may be 20-30% shorter due to the compact space and powerful fan. We recommend checking <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> for specific timing adjustments on different foods.</p>

<h2>When to Use 130 C in Fan Oven</h2>
<p>The 130 C fan setting is ideal for several cooking techniques. Slow-cooking meats to retain moisture, drying herbs, or making meringues all benefit from this gentle heat. It's also perfect for keeping food warm without continuing to cook it. Many bakers use 130 C fan for the final stages of baking delicate sponges to prevent over-browning.</p>
<p>For frozen foods like pastries or pies, 130 C in a fan oven gives time for thorough defrosting before the pastry browns. This temperature also works well for reheating leftovers evenly without drying them out. If you're adapting a conventional oven recipe that calls for 150 C, reducing to 130 C fan will likely give better results with similar cooking times.</p>

<h3>Converting Other Temperatures to Fan</h3>
<p>The general rule for converting conventional oven temperatures to fan is to reduce by 20 C. So 150 C becomes 130 C fan, 180 C becomes 160 C fan, and so on. This conversion works for most recipes, though very high temperatures (above 220 C) might only need a 10 C reduction. Always refer to your oven's manual as some models may vary slightly in their fan efficiency.</p>

<h2>Tips for Baking at 130 C Fan</h2>
<p>When baking at 130 C in a fan oven, position your baking tray in the centre of the oven for even heat distribution. Rotate trays halfway through cooking if you're baking multiple items at once. Use an oven thermometer to verify your oven's accuracy, as some models can run hotter or cooler than their displays indicate.</p>
<p>For best results with cakes at 130 C fan, consider using light-coloured metal tins rather than dark ones which absorb more heat. Reduce sugar slightly in recipes as lower temperatures can make sweets taste more pronounced. After cooking, remember to <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>clean your air fryer</a> or oven while it's still warm for easier maintenance.</p>

<h3>130 C Fan Oven for Different Foods</h3>
<p>Vegetables roast beautifully at 130 C fan, developing deep flavours without burning. Try this temperature for slow-roasted tomatoes or caramelised onions. For meats, 130 C fan is excellent for tenderising tougher cuts over several hours. Fish also benefits from this gentle heat, remaining moist while cooking through evenly.</p>

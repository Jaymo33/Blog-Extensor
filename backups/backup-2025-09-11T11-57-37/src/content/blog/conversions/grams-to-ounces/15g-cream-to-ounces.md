faqQ1: "Can I use milk instead of cream if I don't have 15g of cream?"
faqA1: "Yes, you can substitute milk for cream, but the texture and richness will differ. For 15g of cream, use an equal amount of milk, but consider adding a small amount of butter (about 1/2 teaspoon) to mimic cream's fat content. This works well in most air fryer recipes."
faqQ2: "How do I store leftover cream after measuring 15g?"
faqA2: "Leftover cream should be stored in an airtight container in the fridge and used within 2-3 days. To prevent spoilage, avoid returning unused cream to its original container. For longer storage, freeze cream in ice cube trays and thaw as needed."
faqQ3: "Is 15g of cream the same as 15ml?"
faqA3: "No, 15g of cream is not the same as 15ml. Cream's density means 15g is roughly 14.5ml, but this can vary slightly depending on fat content. For precise air fryer recipes, always weigh cream for accuracy."
faqQ4: "Can I use whipped cream instead of liquid cream in air fryer recipes?"
faqA4: "Whipped cream isn't ideal for most air fryer recipes as it contains added air and sugar. Stick to liquid cream unless the recipe specifically calls for whipped cream. For desserts, consider folding whipped cream in after cooking."

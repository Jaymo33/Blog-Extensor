faqQ1: "Is 500g of minced garlic the same as fresh cloves?"
faqA1: "500g of minced garlic is roughly equivalent to 50-60 medium cloves, depending on size. Minced garlic is more concentrated, so adjust recipes accordingly. For air fryer dishes, minced garlic distributes flavour evenly compared to whole cloves."
faqQ2: "Can I substitute garlic powder for 500g minced garlic?"
faqA2: "Yes, but the conversion differs. Use 1 teaspoon of garlic powder for every 10g of minced garlic (about 50 teaspoons for 500g). Garlic powder lacks moisture, so reduce other dry ingredients in air fryer recipes slightly."
faqQ3: "How long does 500g minced garlic last in the fridge?"
faqA3: "Stored properly, 500g minced garlic stays fresh for 2 weeks refrigerated. Freeze portions in small containers for up to 3 months. Always check for discolouration or off smells before using in air fryer recipes."
faqQ4: "Why does my air fryer recipe taste too garlicky with 500g minced garlic?"
faqA4: "500g minced garlic (17.64 oz) is a large quantityâ€”reduce it by half for milder flavours. Air fryers intensify garlic's potency due to concentrated heat. Start with less and adjust to taste in future batches."

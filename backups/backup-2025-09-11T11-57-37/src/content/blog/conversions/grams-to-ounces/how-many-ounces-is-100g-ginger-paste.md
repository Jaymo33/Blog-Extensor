faqQ1: "Can I use fresh ginger instead of ginger paste in my air fryer recipes?"
faqA1: "Yes, you can substitute fresh ginger for ginger paste. Use about 1 tablespoon of freshly grated ginger for every 15g (0.53 ounces) of ginger paste. Fresh ginger has a sharper flavour, so adjust to taste."
faqQ2: "How long does ginger paste last in the fridge?"
faqA2: "Ginger paste typically lasts 2-3 weeks in the fridge if stored in an airtight container. For longer storage, freeze it in portions (like 100g or 3.53 ounces) and thaw as needed."
faqQ3: "Is 100g of ginger paste the same as 100ml?"
faqA3: "No, grams measure weight, while millilitres measure volume. Since ginger paste is thick, 100g won’t necessarily equal 100ml. Always weigh it for accuracy in air fryer recipes."
faqQ4: "Can I make ginger paste at home for air fryer recipes?"
faqA4: "Absolutely! Blend fresh ginger with a bit of water or oil until smooth. Homemade ginger paste is fresher and free of preservatives. Store it in the fridge or freezer for future use."

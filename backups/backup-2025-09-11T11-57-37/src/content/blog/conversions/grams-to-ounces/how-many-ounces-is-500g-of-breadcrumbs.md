faqQ1: "Can I use panko breadcrumbs instead of regular breadcrumbs for 500g?"
faqA1: "Yes, you can substitute panko breadcrumbs for regular breadcrumbs in a 1:1 ratio by weight. However, panko is lighter and flakier, so you might need slightly more volume to reach 500g (17.64 oz). Adjust based on your recipe’s texture preferences."
faqQ2: "How long does 500g of breadcrumbs last in the pantry?"
faqA2: "Stored in an airtight container, 500g of breadcrumbs can last up to 3 months in a cool, dry place. For longer storage, freeze them for up to 6 months. Always check for freshness before use—they should smell neutral and feel dry."
faqQ3: "Is 500g of breadcrumbs enough for a family meal?"
faqA3: "Absolutely! 500g (17.64 oz) of breadcrumbs is perfect for coating 4-6 servings of chicken, fish, or vegetables in the air fryer. For larger gatherings, you might need to double the quantity, depending on the recipe."
faqQ4: "Can I make gluten-free breadcrumbs for 500g measurements?"
faqA4: "Yes, gluten-free breadcrumbs weigh similarly to regular ones. Use the same 500g (17.64 oz) measurement, but check your recipe for any adjustments in cooking time, as gluten-free coatings may crisp up faster in the air fryer."

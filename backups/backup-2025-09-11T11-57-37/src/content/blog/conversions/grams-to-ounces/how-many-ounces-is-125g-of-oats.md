faqQ1: "Can I use cups instead of weighing 125g of oats?"
faqA1: "While you can use cups (125g is roughly 1¼ cups of oats), weighing is more accurate for consistent results. Oats can settle differently in cups, affecting your recipe outcomes. For air fryer cooking where precision matters, we recommend using digital scales."
faqQ2: "Does the type of oat affect the 125g to ounces conversion?"
faqA2: "No, the conversion remains the same regardless of oat type - 125g always equals about 4.41 ounces. However, different oat varieties (like rolled vs instant) may have slightly different volumes per gram, which is why weighing is preferable for air fryer recipes."
faqQ3: "How many servings does 125g of oats make in air fryer recipes?"
faqA3: "125g of oats typically serves 2-4 people depending on the recipe. For coatings, it covers 4 chicken breasts. For oat-based dishes like granola or cookies, it makes about 12 portions. Check specific recipes on airfryerrecipe.co.uk for exact serving sizes."
faqQ4: "Why do UK air fryer recipes use grams instead of ounces?"
faqA4: "The UK primarily uses metric measurements (grams) in cooking, while ounces are more common in the US. At airfryerrecipe.co.uk, we provide both measurements to cater to all users. Grams offer more precision, which is particularly important for air fryer cooking where quantities affect cooking times and results."

<h2>Why accurate oat measurements matter in air frying</h2>
<p>When using oats in your air fryer, whether as a coating or ingredient, precision matters. Too many oats can make coatings dry and crumbly, while too few won't provide enough texture. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we've found that 125g of oats (about 4.41 ounces) is the perfect amount for coating 4 chicken breasts or making a batch of air-fried oat cookies.</p>

<p>Many UK air fryer enthusiasts prefer weighing ingredients rather than using volume measurements. This is because oats can settle differently in measuring cups, leading to inconsistent results. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> takes the guesswork out of these measurements, especially when adapting recipes from American sources that typically use ounces.</p>

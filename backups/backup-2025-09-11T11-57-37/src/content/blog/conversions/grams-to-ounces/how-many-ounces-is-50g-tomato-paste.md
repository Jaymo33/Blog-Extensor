faqQ1: "Can I use tomato sauce instead of tomato paste in air fryer recipes?"
faqA1: "Tomato sauce can work as a substitute, but it’s much thinner than tomato paste. For every 50g (1.76 oz) of tomato paste, you’d need about 100g of tomato sauce and should reduce other liquids in the recipe. Keep in mind the flavour will be less concentrated."
faqQ2: "How long does tomato paste last once opened?"
faqA2: "Opened tomato paste lasts about 5-7 days in the fridge if stored in an airtight container. For longer storage, freeze it in portions—it’ll keep for up to 3 months. Always check for mould or off smells before using."
faqQ3: "Why do air fryer recipes often use tomato paste?"
faqA3: "Tomato paste adds rich, concentrated flavour without adding excess moisture, which is perfect for air fryer cooking where crispiness is key. Its thickness also helps coatings and marinades stick better to foods like chicken or vegetables."
faqQ4: "Is 50g of tomato paste the same as 50ml?"
faqA4: "No, grams measure weight while millilitres measure volume. 50g of tomato paste is roughly 45ml due to its dense texture. For accuracy in air fryer recipes, always weigh ingredients like tomato paste rather than using volume measures."

<p>50g of tomato paste equals approximately 1.76 ounces. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes, where precise measurements can make all the difference. Whether you're whipping up a quick pasta sauce or a flavourful marinade, knowing how to convert grams to ounces ensures your dish turns out perfectly. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we’re all about making cooking easier, so let’s dive into the details.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on precise cooking times and ingredient quantities to deliver crispy, evenly cooked results. Using too much or too little tomato paste can throw off the balance of your recipe. For example, a sauce might become too thick or too watery if the tomato paste measurement isn’t spot-on. That’s why converting 50g of tomato paste to ounces (1.76 oz) is so helpful—it ensures consistency. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more handy tips.</p>  

<p>Tomato paste is a concentrated ingredient, so even small variations in quantity can significantly impact flavour and texture. Whether you’re making a rich bolognese or a tangy BBQ glaze, getting the 50g tomato paste to ounces conversion right is key. Plus, many air fryer recipes, like stuffed peppers or meatballs, call for precise amounts to avoid soggy or dry results. Trust us, your taste buds will thank you for the accuracy!</p>  

<h2>How to measure 50g of tomato paste without scales</h2>  
<p>Not everyone has kitchen scales handy, but don’t worry—there are easy ways to measure 50g of tomato paste in ounces (1.76 oz) without them. A standard tablespoon holds about 15g of tomato paste, so 3 heaped tablespoons will give you roughly 50g. Alternatively, a small 50g tin of tomato paste is a common supermarket size, making it a convenient option.

<h3>Using visual cues for accuracy</h3>  
<p>If you’re eyeballing it, 50g of tomato paste is roughly the size of a golf ball. This visual trick helps when you’re in a pinch and need a quick estimate. Remember, though, that for baking or sauces where precision matters, scales are best. For dishes like air fryer pizza or stuffed mushrooms, a little extra or less tomato paste might not ruin the dish, but sticking to 50g (1.76 oz) ensures consistency.</p>  

<h2>Common recipes using 50g of tomato paste</h2>  
<p>Tomato paste is a staple in many air fryer recipes, from hearty stews to zesty marinades. A 50g portion is perfect for a family-sized batch of air fryer meatballs or a rich tomato-based sauce for pasta. It’s also ideal for adding depth to dishes like air fryer ratatouille or homemade BBQ sauce.

<p>Another great use for 50g of tomato paste is in air fryer-friendly curries or soups. Its concentrated flavour means a little goes a long way, so converting 50g to ounces (1.76 oz) helps avoid overpowering your dish. Whether you’re cooking for one or a crowd, this measurement is a handy benchmark.

<h3>Storing leftover tomato paste</h3>  
<p>If your recipe only uses part of a 50g tin, transfer the leftover paste to an airtight container and refrigerate. It’ll keep for up to a week, ready for your next air fryer adventure. You can also freeze it in ice cube trays for portioned convenience—just pop out a cube whenever you need roughly 15g (about 0.5 oz) of tomato paste.</p>

faqQ1: "Can I use tomato sauce instead of tomato paste in my air fryer recipes?"
faqA1: "Tomato sauce can be used as a substitute, but it’s much thinner than tomato paste. To replace 20g (0.71 ounces) of tomato paste, use about 60g of tomato sauce and reduce other liquids in the recipe. Keep in mind the flavour will be less concentrated."
faqQ2: "How do I convert other amounts of tomato paste from grams to ounces?"
faqA2: "To convert any amount, multiply the grams by 0.035 to get ounces. For example, 50g of tomato paste is 1.76 ounces. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a> makes this easy for all your air fryer cooking needs."
faqQ3: "Does the brand of tomato paste affect the weight conversion?"
faqA3: "Most tomato pastes have a similar density, so 20g will generally equal 0.71 ounces regardless of brand. However, organic or specialty pastes may vary slightly. Always check the label if precision is crucial for your recipe."
faqQ4: "What’s the best way to measure sticky ingredients like tomato paste?"
faqA4: "For sticky ingredients, lightly oil your measuring spoon or use a spatula to scrape out every bit. This ensures you get the full 20g (0.71 ounces) without waste. Pre-portioned tubes of tomato paste can also simplify measuring."

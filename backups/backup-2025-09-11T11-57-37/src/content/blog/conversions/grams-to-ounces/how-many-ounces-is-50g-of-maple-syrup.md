faqQ1: "Can I use honey instead of maple syrup in air fryer recipes?"
faqA1: "Yes, honey can substitute maple syrup in a 1:1 ratio by weight (50g honey = 1.76 oz). Adjust cooking times slightly, as honey caramelises faster. For best results, reduce the air fryer temperature by 5°C to prevent burning."
faqQ2: "How do I store opened maple syrup for air fryer recipes?"
faqA2: "Store opened maple syrup in the fridge to prevent mould. It thickens when cold, so warm it slightly before measuring 50g (1.76 oz) for recipes. Proper storage keeps it fresh for up to a year."
faqQ3: "Why is my air-fryer glaze with maple syrup too runny?"
faqA3: "If your glaze is runny, reduce the maple syrup by simmering it on the stove first. Alternatively, mix 50g (1.76 oz) with a thickener like cornstarch or mustard before applying. This ensures a sticky, even coating."
faqQ4: "Is maple syrup healthier than sugar in air fryer cooking?"
faqA4: "Maple syrup contains minerals like zinc and manganese, making it a slightly healthier option than refined sugar. However, it’s still high in calories, so use 50g (1.76 oz) sparingly in balanced recipes."

<p>50g of maple syrup equals approximately 1.76 ounces. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements can make or break a dish. Whether you're drizzling it over air-fried pancakes or using it as a glaze for roasted vegetables, knowing the exact weight ensures consistency. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we focus on making cooking conversions effortless for home chefs. Let’s dive deeper into why this measurement matters and how to use it effectively.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate conversions matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on precise ingredient ratios to achieve the perfect texture and flavour. Using too much or too little maple syrup can affect caramelisation and moisture levels. For example, 50g of maple syrup (1.76 oz) is ideal for glazing air-fryer salmon or sweetening a batch of granola.

Consistency is key, especially when adapting recipes from grams to ounces.</p>  

<p>Maple syrup’s viscosity means volume measurements (like tablespoons) can vary, making weight more reliable. A kitchen scale ensures accuracy, whether you’re preparing a marinade or baking air-fryer cookies.

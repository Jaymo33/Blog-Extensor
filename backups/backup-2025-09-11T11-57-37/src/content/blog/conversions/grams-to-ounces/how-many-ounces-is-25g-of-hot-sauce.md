faqQ1: "Can I use 25g of hot sauce in any air fryer recipe?"
faqA1: "Yes, 25g of hot sauce (about 0.88 ounces) works well in most air fryer recipes, from marinades to glazes. Adjust the amount based on your heat preference and the dish’s other flavours. For delicate proteins like fish or tofu, start with less and add gradually."
faqQ2: "How do I convert 25g of hot sauce to cups?"
faqA2: "25g of hot sauce is roughly 1.5 tablespoons or just under 1/8 cup. Since hot sauce viscosity varies, weighing it is more accurate. For precise conversions, refer to our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>."
faqQ3: "Does the type of hot sauce affect the 25g to ounces conversion?"
faqA3: "The conversion (25g = 0.88 oz) remains the same, but thicker sauces like chipotle may weigh slightly more per volume than thinner ones like Tabasco. For consistent results, always measure by weight when possible."
faqQ4: "What’s the best way to store leftover hot sauce after measuring 25g?"
faqA4: "Keep opened hot sauce in the fridge to maintain freshness. Ensure the lid is tightly sealed to prevent oxidation. Most hot sauces last 6–12 months refrigerated, though homemade varieties may spoil sooner. Always check for off smells or mould before use."

<h2>Tips for Working with Hot Sauce in Your Air Fryer</h2>  
<p>Hot sauce can caramelise quickly in the air fryer, so it’s best to add it towards the end of cooking or mix it with oil to prevent burning. For sticky glazes, brush the sauce on in thin layers and air fry at a slightly lower temperature. Always clean your air fryer basket promptly—check our guide on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaning</a> for tips.</p>  
<p>Experimenting with 25g of hot sauce? Start with less if you’re sensitive to heat, then adjust. The air fryer’s intense heat can amplify spiciness, so taste as you go. And don’t forget—proper measurement ensures consistent results every time!</p>

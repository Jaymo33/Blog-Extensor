faqQ1: "Is 50g of sunflower oil the same as 50ml?"
faqA1: "No, 50g of sunflower oil is not the same as 50ml. Due to its density, 50g of sunflower oil equals roughly 54ml. Grams measure weight, while millilitres measure volume, so the conversion depends on the oil’s density."
faqQ2: "Can I use olive oil instead of sunflower oil in my air fryer?"
faqA2: "Yes, you can substitute olive oil, but it has a lower smoke point than sunflower oil. For high-temperature air frying, sunflower oil is better. Use the same weight (50g or 1.76 oz) for accurate results."
faqQ3: "How do I convert 50g of sunflower oil to cups?"
faqA3: "50g of sunflower oil is approximately ¼ cup (60ml). Since oil density varies slightly, weighing it is more accurate. For air fryer recipes, precise measurements ensure even cooking."
faqQ4: "Why is my air-fried food greasy with 50g of sunflower oil?"
faqA4: "Using too much oil can make food greasy. Ensure you’re measuring 50g (1.76 oz) accurately and evenly coating ingredients. For lighter results, try spraying oil instead of pouring."

<p>Sunflower oil is a popular choice for air frying due to its high smoke point and neutral flavour. Measuring it accurately ensures your dishes turn out just right. If you’re using a recipe from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, you’ll often find measurements in grams, so this conversion is handy.

<h3>Why convert grams to ounces for air frying?</h3>

<h2>How to measure 50g of sunflower oil without scales</h2>  
<p>If you don’t have a kitchen scale, you can measure 50g of sunflower oil using tablespoons or a measuring cup. One tablespoon of sunflower oil weighs about 14g, so 3.5 tablespoons will give you roughly 50g. Alternatively, 50g is just under ¼ cup (60ml) of oil. For precise air fryer recipes, like those on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>our chicken recipe category</a>, accuracy is key.</p>  

<p>Another method is to use a liquid measuring jug with ounce markings. Since 50g equals 1.76 ounces, you can pour the oil until it reaches this mark. This is especially useful for recipes requiring small amounts of oil, such as air-fried vegetables or lean meats. Always level off your measurements for the best results.</p>  

<h3>Does the type of oil affect the conversion?</h3>  
<p>While most oils have similar densities, slight variations exist. Sunflower oil weighs about 0.92 grams per millilitre, so 50g takes up slightly more volume than denser oils like coconut oil. However, the 50g to ounces conversion (1.76 oz) remains consistent for sunflower oil.

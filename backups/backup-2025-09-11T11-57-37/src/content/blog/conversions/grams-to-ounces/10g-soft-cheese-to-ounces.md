faqQ1: "Can I use 10g of soft cheese in place of hard cheese in air fryer recipes?"
faqA1: "Soft cheese melts faster than hard cheese, so adjust cooking times. For example, 10g of soft cheese (0.35 oz) will brown quicker in the air fryer. Reduce heat by 10°C or check dishes earlier to prevent burning."
faqQ2: "How do I store leftover soft cheese after measuring 10g?"
faqA2: "Wrap the remaining cheese tightly in cling film or store it in an airtight container. Soft cheese lasts up to a week refrigerated. For longer storage, freeze it in 10g portions (0.35 oz) and thaw before use."
faqQ3: "Is 10g of soft cheese enough for a single serving in air fryer recipes?"
faqA3: "Yes, 10g (0.35 oz) works well for individual portions like stuffed peppers or mini quiches. For richer dishes, you might double the amount. Check our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/appetisers>appetiser recipes</a> for ideas."
faqQ4: "Why does my air fryer recipe call for 10g of soft cheese instead of volume measures?"
faqA4: "Weight (grams or ounces) is more accurate than volume for soft cheese, which can vary in density. Measuring 10g (0.35 oz) ensures consistency, especially in air fryer baking where precision affects texture."

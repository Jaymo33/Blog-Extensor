faqQ1: "Can I use minced garlic instead of crushed garlic for 150g?"
faqA1: "Yes, minced garlic can substitute crushed garlic at a 1:1 ratio by weight. Since 150g equals 5.29 ounces, the measurement stays the same. However, minced garlic may have a slightly stronger flavour due to finer texture."
faqQ2: "How many cloves make up 150g of crushed garlic?"
faqA2: "Approximately 30-35 medium cloves yield 150g (5.29 ounces) of crushed garlic. Clove sizes vary, so weighing ensures accuracy. For air fryer recipes, crushed garlic blends better than whole cloves."
faqQ3: "Does 150g of crushed garlic change weight when cooked?"
faqA3: "Cooking reduces garlic’s water content, so 150g (5.29 ounces) may shrink slightly. However, the flavour intensifies. In air fryers, spread garlic evenly to prevent burning during cooking."
faqQ4: "Can I convert 150g of crushed garlic to tablespoons?"
faqA4: "150g of crushed garlic is roughly 10-12 tablespoons, but weight is more reliable. Air fryer recipes often need precision, so stick to grams or ounces for best results."

faqQ1: "Is 30g of rapeseed oil the same as 30ml?"
faqA1: "No, 30g of rapeseed oil isn't exactly the same as 30ml. While they're close in volume, oil's density means 30g is about 32.6ml. For air frying, this small difference usually doesn't affect results, but for precise baking, it's better to measure by weight (grams) rather than volume (ml)."
faqQ2: "Can I use other oils instead of rapeseed oil in my air fryer?"
faqA2: "Yes, you can substitute other oils with similar smoke points, like sunflower or vegetable oil, using the same 30g (1.06 oz) measurement. Avoid extra virgin olive oil for high-temperature air frying as it has a lower smoke point. Always check your air fryer's manual for oil recommendations."
faqQ3: "How do I measure 30g of rapeseed oil without scales?"
faqA3: "Without scales, you can use volume measurements. Two level tablespoons of rapeseed oil equals roughly 30g (1.06 oz). For more accuracy, use proper measuring spoons rather than tableware. Alternatively, a standard UK teaspoon holds about 5g of oil, so six teaspoons would give you approximately 30g."
faqQ4: "Why does my air fryer recipe specify grams instead of ounces for oil?"
faqA4: "Many UK and European recipes use grams as it's more precise for small measurements like 30g of oil. Professional chefs prefer weight measurements (grams) over volume (ounces) for consistency. If your air fryer manual uses ounces, simply remember 30g equals about 1.06 ounces for easy conversion."

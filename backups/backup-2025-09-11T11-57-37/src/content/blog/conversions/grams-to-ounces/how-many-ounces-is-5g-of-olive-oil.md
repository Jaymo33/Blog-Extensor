faqQ1: "Is 5g of olive oil the same as 5ml?"
faqA1: "Not exactly. While 5g of olive oil is roughly 5ml, weight (grams) and volume (millilitres) measure different properties. For precision in air fryer cooking, grams are more reliable."
faqQ2: "Can I use a tablespoon to measure 5g of olive oil?"
faqA2: "A UK tablespoon holds about 15ml, which is roughly 15g of olive oil—three times more than 5g. For accuracy, use a teaspoon (5ml) or a digital scale set to grams or ounces."
faqQ3: "Why is measuring olive oil important for air fryers?"
faqA3: "Too much oil can make food greasy and cause smoke, while too little may lead to sticking. 5g (0.18 oz) is often the sweet spot for even crisping without excess fat."
faqQ4: "How do I convert other oil amounts from grams to ounces?"
faqA4: "Multiply grams by 0.035 to get ounces. For example, 10g is 0.35 oz. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a> simplifies this for all common measurements."

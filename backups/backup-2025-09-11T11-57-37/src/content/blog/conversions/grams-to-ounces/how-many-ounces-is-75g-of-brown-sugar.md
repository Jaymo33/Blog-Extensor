faqQ1: "Is 75g of brown sugar the same as 75g of white sugar in ounces?"
faqA1: "Yes, 75g of any sugar (brown or white) equals approximately 2.65 ounces by weight. However, brown sugar is denser due to its moisture content, so it may take up slightly less volume than white sugar when measured by cups."
faqQ2: "Can I use a measuring cup instead of a scale for 75g of brown sugar?"
faqA2: "While a scale is more accurate, you can use a measuring cup in a pinch. Loosely fill the cup with brown sugar without packing it down—75g is roughly ⅓ cup. For precision in air fryer recipes, though, weighing is best."
faqQ3: "Why does my air fryer recipe call for brown sugar in grams?"
faqA3: "Many modern recipes, especially those from the UK or Europe, use grams for consistency. Grams provide exact measurements, which is crucial for air fryer cooking where small changes can affect texture and browning."
faqQ4: "How do I convert other amounts of brown sugar to ounces?"
faqA4: "Use the ratio 28.35g = 1 ounce. For example, 100g would be about 3.53 oz. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a> simplifies these calculations for all your air fryer needs."

faqQ1: "Can I use 75g of fresh yeast instead of dry yeast?"
faqA1: "Yes, but you'll need about 3 times as much fresh yeast by weight. So 75g fresh yeast replaces roughly 25g dry yeast. In ounces, that's approximately 2.65oz fresh yeast for 0.88oz dry yeast. Always check your specific recipe's requirements."
faqQ2: "How long will 75g of yeast last once opened?"
faqA2: "Fresh yeast lasts about 2 weeks refrigerated, while dry yeast stays active for 4-6 months stored properly. For best results in air fryer baking, use opened yeast within these timeframes. You can test yeast freshness by mixing a pinch with warm water and sugar – it should foam within 10 minutes."
faqQ3: "Why does my air fryer bread with 75g yeast taste bitter?"
faqA3: "Bitterness usually means over-proofing. The air fryer's intense heat makes yeast work faster. Try reducing proofing time by 20% when converting traditional oven recipes. Also ensure your 75g (2.65oz) yeast measurement is accurate – too much yeast can cause off-flavours."
faqQ4: "Can I freeze dough made with 75g of yeast?"
faqA4: "Absolutely! Dough with 75g yeast freezes well after the first rise. Portion it before freezing for easy air fryer baking later. Thaw overnight in the fridge, then let it come to room temperature before shaping and final proofing. The yeast will remain active through freezing."

Whether you're making dough in your air fryer or prepping ingredients for a traditional oven, accurate measurements ensure perfect results every time.</p>  

<h2>Why converting 75g of yeast to ounces matters</h2>  
<p>Many UK bakers use grams for precision, but some recipes, especially older or American ones, list yeast in ounces. Knowing that 75g of yeast is roughly 2.65 ounces helps avoid guesswork. This is particularly useful when adapting recipes for your air fryer, where exact measurements can affect texture and rise.

<p>Yeast is a live ingredient, and even small measurement errors can lead to dense or overly risen bakes. If you're converting 75g yeast to oz for air fryer bread or pizza dough, a digital scale is your best friend. For those without one, visualising 75g as just under 3 ounces can help. Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for other common measurement swaps.</p>  

<h3>How to measure 75g of yeast without scales</h3>  
<p>If you don't have scales, 75g of fresh yeast is roughly a walnut-sized piece. For dry yeast, 75g equals about 5 UK tablespoons. Remember that yeast types vary – always check whether your recipe uses fresh, active dry, or instant yeast. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>cake recipes</a> section includes yeast-based bakes with both metric and imperial measurements.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for 75g of yeast in air fryer baking</h2>  
<p>75g of yeast (2.65 ounces) is perfect for medium-sized batches of air fryer doughnuts, bread rolls, or pizza bases. This quantity typically serves 4-6 people when making enriched doughs. The air fryer's rapid heat circulation means yeast activates quickly, so precise measurements prevent over-proofing.</p>  

<p>When converting 75g yeast to ounces for air fryer recipes, consider your machine's capacity. Most compact air fryers work best with half-standard bread recipes. For cleaning sticky yeast dough from your basket afterwards, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner guide</a> has handy tips. The 75g measurement also works well for <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/breakfast>breakfast pastries</a> like cinnamon rolls.</p>  

<h3>Storing leftover yeast after measuring 75g</h3>  
<p>Once you've measured out your 75g (2.65oz) of yeast, store any excess in an airtight container in the fridge (fresh yeast) or cool, dark cupboard (dry yeast). Proper storage maintains potency for future air fryer baking sessions. Always check yeast freshness before use – it should smell pleasantly earthy, not sour.</p>

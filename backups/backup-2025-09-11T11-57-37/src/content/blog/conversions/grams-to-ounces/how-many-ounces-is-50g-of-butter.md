<h2>Why accurate butter measurements matter</h2>  
<p>Using the correct amount of butter is crucial for texture and flavour in air fryer cooking. Too much butter can lead to greasy, unevenly cooked food, while too little might leave your dish dry.

<p>Butter measurements also affect baking times in the air fryer. Since air fryers cook faster than conventional ovens, precise quantities help avoid undercooked or burnt results.

<h2>How to measure 50g of butter without scales</h2>  
<p>If you don’t have a kitchen scale, you can still measure 50g of butter (1.76 ounces) using tablespoons.

<h3>Converting butter for different recipes</h3>

<h2>Common mistakes when measuring butter</h2>  
<p>One common error is using volume measurements (like cups) instead of weight, which can lead to inconsistencies. For example, a cup of melted butter weighs differently than a cup of solid butter. Always opt for weight measurements like grams or ounces for accuracy. If you're unsure, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner</a> guide also includes tips on maintaining your appliance for perfect cooking.</p>  

<p>Another mistake is not accounting for the wrapper’s weight when measuring butter. Most butter wrappers have markings for grams and ounces, making it easy to slice off 50g (1.76 ounces) without guesswork. This small step can make a big difference in your air fryer dishes, ensuring consistent results every time.</p>

faqQ1: "Can I use golden syrup instead of treacle in my air fryer recipe?"
faqA1: "Yes, golden syrup can substitute for treacle, but it has a lighter flavour. Use the same weight (200g or 7.05 oz) for similar sweetness. Adjust other spices in the recipe to balance the milder taste."
faqQ2: "How do I clean my air fryer after using treacle?"
faqA2: "Treacle can be sticky, so wipe the basket with warm, soapy water immediately after use. For stubborn residue, soak the basket in hot water with baking soda. Avoid abrasive scrubbers to protect non-stick coatings."
faqQ3: "Why is my treacle measurement different on two scales?"
faqA3: "Scales can vary in accuracy, especially with sticky ingredients like treacle. Always use a digital scale for precision. If measuring ounces, ensure the scale is set to the correct unit (oz vs. fluid oz)."
faqQ4: "Can I freeze leftover treacle?"
faqA4: "Yes, treacle freezes well. Store it in an airtight container for up to 6 months. Thaw at room temperature before use. Stir well if it separates after freezing."

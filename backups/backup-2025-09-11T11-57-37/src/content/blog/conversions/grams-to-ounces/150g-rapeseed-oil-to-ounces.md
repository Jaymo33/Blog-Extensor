faqQ1: "Why is it important to measure rapeseed oil accurately in an air fryer?"
faqA1: "Accurate measurement ensures even cooking and prevents excess oil, which can lead to soggy or greasy results. Air fryers work best with precise amounts of oil to achieve that perfect crispiness without overdoing it."
faqQ2: "Can I use a different oil if I don’t have rapeseed oil?"
faqA2: "Yes, you can substitute with oils like sunflower or vegetable oil, but adjust quantities slightly as densities vary. Rapeseed oil’s neutral flavour and high smoke point make it ideal for air frying, so results may differ with other oils."
faqQ3: "How do I convert ounces back to grams if my recipe uses ounces?"
faqA3: "To convert ounces to grams, multiply the ounce measurement by 28.35. For example, 5.29 oz x 28.35 = 150g. This simple calculation helps you switch between measurement systems effortlessly."
faqQ4: "Does rapeseed oil affect cooking times in an air fryer?"
faqA4: "Rapeseed oil doesn’t significantly alter cooking times, but using too much can increase splattering and smoke. Stick to recommended amounts like 150g (5.29 oz) for best results and to maintain your air fryer’s performance."

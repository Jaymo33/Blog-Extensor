faqQ1: "Can I use plain flour instead of self-raising flour for 20g measurements?"
faqA1: "Yes, but you’ll need to add baking powder. For every 20g of plain flour, mix in ½ teaspoon of baking powder to mimic self-raising flour. This ensures your air fryer bakes rise properly."
faqQ2: "How do I measure 20g of self-raising flour without scales?"
faqA2: "Use tablespoons: 4 level tablespoons of self-raising flour equal roughly 20g (0.71 oz). Fluff the flour first, then spoon it into the measuring spoon without packing it down."
faqQ3: "Why does 20g of self-raising flour weigh less in ounces than other flours?"
faqA3: "All flours have the same weight conversion (20g = 0.71 oz), but self-raising flour’s added baking powder can make it slightly fluffier. Always measure by weight for accuracy."
faqQ4: "Can I convert 20g of self-raising flour to cups instead of ounces?"
faqA4: "20g of self-raising flour is about ⅛ cup, but weighing it (0.71 oz) is more precise. Cup measurements vary based on how the flour is packed, so a scale is best for air fryer recipes."

faqQ1: "Can I use tablespoons to measure 30g of gelatin powder?"
faqA1: "While possible, tablespoons aren’t the most accurate way to measure 30g of gelatin powder. A digital scale is recommended for precision, as gelatin’s density can vary. One tablespoon of gelatin powder is roughly 7g, so you’d need about 4.3 tablespoons for 30g."
faqQ2: "Does gelatin powder behave differently in an air fryer?"
faqA2: "Gelatin powder works the same in air fryer recipes as it does in traditional cooking. However, because air fryers cook faster, ensure your gelatin mixtures are well-prepared before adding them to avoid uneven setting. Always follow recipe timings closely."
faqQ3: "How do I convert ounces back to grams for gelatin powder?"
faqA3: "To convert ounces to grams, multiply the ounce value by 28.35. For example, 1.06 ounces of gelatin powder equals 30g. This conversion is handy if you’re adapting recipes from US measurements to UK standards."
faqQ4: "Can I substitute sheet gelatin for 30g of gelatin powder?"
faqA4: "Yes, but the conversion isn’t 1:1. Typically, 30g of gelatin powder equals about 10 sheets of gelatin (depending on sheet size). Always check the packaging for specific conversion guidelines, as sheet gelatin strengths can vary."

faqQ1: "How do I convert 1000g minced garlic to ounces without a scale?"
faqA1: "If you don’t have a scale, you can estimate using volume measurements. One tablespoon of minced garlic weighs about 10g, so 1000g would be roughly 100 tablespoons. However, a digital scale is far more accurate for precise conversions like 1000g to 35.27 ounces."
faqQ2: "Can I use 1000g minced garlic in one air fryer recipe?"
faqA2: "Using 1000g of minced garlic in a single recipe is uncommon unless you’re batch cooking. Most air fryer recipes call for smaller amounts, like 10-50g. For large quantities, consider dividing the garlic into portions for multiple dishes or freezing the excess."
faqQ3: "Does minced garlic weigh the same as whole garlic cloves?"
faqA3: "No, minced garlic is denser than whole cloves. One clove weighs about 3-7g, while minced garlic packs more into the same volume. Always measure by weight (grams or ounces) for accuracy, especially when converting 1000g to ounces."
faqQ4: "How long does 1000g minced garlic last in the fridge?"
faqA4: "Stored in an airtight container, 1000g of minced garlic lasts up to two weeks in the fridge. For longer storage, freeze it in portions. Proper storage ensures the garlic stays fresh for future air fryer recipes."

faqQ1: "Can I use volume measurements instead of weight for chopped onion?"
faqA1: "While possible, weight measurements are more accurate for chopped onion. Volume can vary based on chop size and packing density. 20g equals about 2 tablespoons when finely chopped, but scales give reliable results every time."
faqQ2: "Does the type of onion affect the weight-to-ounce conversion?"
faqA2: "No, the 20g to 0.7oz conversion applies to all onion varieties. However, moisture content differs slightly - red onions are juicier than yellows, but the weight measurement remains consistent for recipe purposes."
faqQ3: "How should I store leftover chopped onion after measuring 20g?"
faqA3: "Keep unused portions in an airtight container in the fridge for 2-3 days. For longer storage, freeze measured 20g portions in bags. Thaw before using in air fryer recipes to prevent excess moisture."
faqQ4: "Why do air fryer recipes often specify weights like 20g instead of volumes?"
faqA4: "Weight measurements ensure consistency regardless of how finely you chop. Air fryers cook quickly, so precise amounts prevent over- or under-seasoning. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>recipes</a> use weights for foolproof results every time."

In air fryer cooking, even distribution is key for even cooking. Recipes like air-fried fajitas or onion-topped burgers rely on balanced portions.

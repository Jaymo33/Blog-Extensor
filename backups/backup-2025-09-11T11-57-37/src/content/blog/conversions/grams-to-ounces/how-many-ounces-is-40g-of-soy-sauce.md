faqQ1: "Can I use tablespoons to measure 40g of soy sauce?"
faqA1: "Yes, you can approximate 40g of soy sauce using tablespoons. One tablespoon holds about 15g of soy sauce, so 40g is roughly 2.5 tablespoons. For greater accuracy, especially in air fryer recipes, a digital scale is recommended."
faqQ2: "Does the type of soy sauce affect the 40g to ounces conversion?"
faqA2: "The conversion from 40g to ounces (1.41 oz) remains consistent across soy sauce types, but thickness varies. Light soy sauce is slightly less dense than dark, but the weight difference is negligible for home cooking. Always measure by weight for precision."
faqQ3: "How much sodium is in 40g of soy sauce?"
faqA3: "40g of standard soy sauce contains approximately 2,300mg of sodium—almost a full day’s recommended intake. For healthier air fryer meals, opt for reduced-sodium versions, which cut the sodium by about 40% while maintaining flavour."
faqQ4: "Can I substitute 40g of soy sauce with other liquids in air fryer recipes?"
faqA4: "For a soy-free alternative, try 40g of tamari (1.41 oz) or coconut aminos, which have similar consistency. In a pinch, mix 1 teaspoon of salt with 40g of water and a dash of vinegar, but this won’t replicate soy sauce’s umami depth."

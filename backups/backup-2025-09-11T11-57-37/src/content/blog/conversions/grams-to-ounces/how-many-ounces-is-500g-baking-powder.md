faqQ1: "Can I use cups to measure 500g of baking powder instead of ounces?"
faqA1: "Yes, but it’s less accurate. One cup of baking powder weighs about 120g, so 500g would be roughly 4.17 cups. For best results, use a digital scale or convert 500g to ounces (17.64 oz) for precision."
faqQ2: "Does baking powder weight change in an air fryer?"
faqA2: "No, the weight remains the same, but air fryers cook faster than ovens, so measurements must be precise. Too much baking powder can cause over-rising or bitterness, especially in small air fryer baskets."
faqQ3: "How long does 500g of baking powder last once opened?"
faqA3: "Opened baking powder lasts 6–12 months if stored in a cool, dry place. To test if it’s still active, mix a teaspoon with hot water—if it bubbles, it’s good to use."
faqQ4: "Can I substitute baking soda for baking powder in air fryer recipes?"
faqA4: "Not directly. Baking soda is 3–4 times stronger, so you’d need less. For every teaspoon of baking powder, use 1/4 teaspoon baking soda plus an acid (like lemon juice). Adjustments may vary by recipe."

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Baking</h2>  
<p>Baking powder is a leavening agent, and even small measurement errors can affect your dish. Too little, and your cake won’t rise; too much, and it might taste bitter. Air fryers cook food quickly, so precision is key. If you’re experimenting with recipes from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, knowing how to convert 500g of baking powder to ounces ensures consistency. This is especially useful if you’re adapting American recipes, which often use ounces instead of grams.</p>  

<p>Many UK bakers prefer grams, but some older recipes or international guides might list ingredients in ounces. Converting 500g of baking powder to ounces (17.64 oz) helps bridge this gap.

<h3>How to Measure 500g of Baking Powder Without Scales</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a digital scale, you can still measure 500g of baking powder using volume. One tablespoon of baking powder weighs roughly 10g, so 500g would be about 50 tablespoons. However, this method isn’t as precise as weighing, so we recommend using scales for accuracy.

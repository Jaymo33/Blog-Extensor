faqQ1: "Is 200g of balsamic vinegar the same as 200ml?"
faqA1: "No, 200g of balsamic vinegar is not the same as 200ml. Grams measure weight, while millilitres measure volume. Balsamic vinegar has a density of about 1.04g/ml, so 200g would be roughly 192ml. Always use a scale for accuracy, especially in air fryer recipes."
faqQ2: "Can I use a measuring cup to measure 200g of balsamic vinegar?"
faqA2: "While you can use a measuring cup, it’s less accurate than a kitchen scale. Balsamic vinegar’s sticky consistency can cling to the cup, leading to slight variations. For precise measurements, especially in air fryer cooking, a scale is recommended."
faqQ3: "How long does 200g of balsamic vinegar last once opened?"
faqA3: "An opened bottle of balsamic vinegar can last up to 3 years if stored properly. Keep it in a cool, dark place with the lid tightly sealed. The vinegar may thicken over time but remains safe to use."
faqQ4: "What can I substitute for 200g of balsamic vinegar in a recipe?"
faqA4: "If you’re out of balsamic vinegar, you can substitute red wine vinegar mixed with a teaspoon of sugar. The flavour won’t be identical, but it will provide a similar tangy sweetness. This works well in most air fryer recipes."

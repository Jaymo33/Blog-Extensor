faqQ1: "Why is it important to convert 25g of milk to ounces for air fryer recipes?"
faqA1: "Converting 25g of milk to ounces ensures accuracy in air fryer recipes, where precise measurements affect texture and cooking times. Since air fryers cook faster than traditional ovens, even small discrepancies can lead to uneven results.

Too much or too little milk can alter the texture of cakes, custards, or batters."
faqQ4: "Are there any air fryer recipes where 25g of milk is commonly used?"

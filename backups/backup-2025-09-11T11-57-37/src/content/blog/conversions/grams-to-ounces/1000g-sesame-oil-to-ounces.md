faqQ1: "Is 1000g of sesame oil the same as 1000ml?"
faqA1: "No, grams measure weight, while millilitres measure volume. Since sesame oil has a different density than water, 1000g won’t equal 1000ml. For accuracy, always weigh sesame oil when converting to ounces."
faqQ2: "Can I use sesame oil for air frying at high temperatures?"
faqA2: "Yes, sesame oil has a high smoke point (around 210°C), making it suitable for air frying. However, use it sparingly to avoid excessive smoke. For best results, combine it with a neutral oil like vegetable oil."
faqQ3: "How long does 1000g of sesame oil last once opened?"
faqA3: "Opened sesame oil lasts about 6–12 months if stored properly. Keep it away from heat and light to maintain freshness. Always check for off smells before using it in your air fryer."
faqQ4: "Why do some recipes list sesame oil in grams and others in ounces?"
faqA4: "Recipes may use grams or ounces depending on regional preferences. Grams are standard in the UK, while ounces are common in the US. Converting 1000g to ounces ensures you follow the recipe correctly, no matter the source."

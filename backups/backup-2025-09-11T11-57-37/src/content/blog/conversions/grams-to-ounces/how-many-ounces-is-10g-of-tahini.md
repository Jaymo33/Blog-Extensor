faqQ1: "Can I use volume measurements instead of weight for tahini?"
faqA1: "While you can use volume measurements like tablespoons, weight (grams or ounces) is more accurate for tahini. Its thick, sticky consistency means volume measurements can vary. For precise air fryer recipes, weighing 10g (0.35 oz) is best."
faqQ2: "Does tahini’s brand affect the weight-to-ounce conversion?"
faqA2: "Different brands may have slightly varying thicknesses, but the weight-to-ounce conversion remains consistent. 10g of tahini will always be approximately 0.35 oz, regardless of brand. Stirring well before measuring ensures accuracy."
faqQ3: "How do I measure tahini if I don’t have a scale?"
faqA3: "If you don’t have a scale, use spoons: 10g of tahini is roughly two-thirds of a tablespoon. This method is less precise but works in a pinch. For best results, consider buying an affordable digital kitchen scale."
faqQ4: "Can I substitute tahini with another ingredient in air fryer recipes?"
faqA4: "If you’re out of tahini, you can use smooth peanut butter or almond butter as substitutes, though the flavour will differ. Adjust quantities to match the 10g (0.35 oz) measurement for consistency. These swaps work well in most air fryer dishes."

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on precise ingredient ratios to achieve crispy, evenly cooked dishes. Using the correct amount of tahini—whether in grams or ounces—can make or break a recipe. Too much tahini might make a dish overly rich, while too little could leave it lacking in flavour. That’s why understanding conversions like 10g tahini to ounces is so important.

<p>Many UK cooks prefer weighing ingredients in grams, but some recipes use ounces. Knowing how to switch between the two ensures you can follow any recipe with confidence. Whether you're making hummus, salad dressings, or marinades, getting the tahini measurement right is key. A digital kitchen scale is a great tool for this, but our quick conversion guide helps when you're in a pinch.</p>  

<h3>How to measure tahini without a scale</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a kitchen scale, you can still measure 10g of tahini (0.35 oz) using spoons. One tablespoon of tahini weighs roughly 15g, so 10g is about two-thirds of a tablespoon. This method isn’t as precise as weighing, but it works in a pinch. For best results, we recommend investing in a digital scale for accurate air fryer cooking.</p>

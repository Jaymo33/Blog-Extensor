faqQ1: "Is 50g of soy milk the same as 50ml?"
faqA1: "For soy milk, 50g is roughly equivalent to 50ml because its density is close to water. However, slight variations can occur with thicker or sweetened brands. For air fryer recipes, this small difference usually isn’t critical."
faqQ2: "Can I use a measuring cup instead of a scale for 50g of soy milk?"
faqA2: "Yes, you can use a measuring cup if you don’t have a scale. Since 50g of soy milk is approximately 50ml, fill a measuring cup to just under ¼ cup for a close estimate. For baking, a scale is more accurate."
faqQ3: "Why do air fryer recipes sometimes use weight instead of volume?"
faqA3: "Weight measurements (like grams or ounces) are more precise than volume (cups or tablespoons), especially for liquids like soy milk. Air fryer cooking benefits from accuracy to ensure even cooking and perfect textures."
faqQ4: "How do I convert other amounts of soy milk from grams to ounces?"
faqA4: "To convert any amount, multiply the grams by 0.035 to get ounces. For example, 100g of soy milk equals 3.5 oz. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a> simplifies this for common measurements."

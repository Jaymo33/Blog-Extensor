faqQ1: "Is 100g of granulated sugar the same as 100ml?"
faqA1: "No, 100g of granulated sugar is not the same as 100ml. Weight (grams) and volume (millilitres) measure different properties. 100g of granulated sugar equals about 118ml in volume due to sugar's density. For accurate baking, always measure sugar by weight rather than volume."
faqQ2: "Can I use brown sugar instead of granulated sugar in air fryer recipes?"
faqA2: "You can substitute brown sugar for granulated sugar, but you'll need to adjust quantities slightly. Brown sugar is more moist and dense, so 100g would be slightly less in volume than granulated. Expect a richer flavour and chewier texture in baked goods. Reduce cooking time by 1-2 minutes as brown sugar caramelises faster."
faqQ3: "How do I clean sticky sugar residue from my air fryer?"
faqA3: "For sugar spills in your air fryer, wait until the appliance cools, then wipe with a damp cloth. For stubborn residue, use a soft brush with warm soapy water. Avoid harsh abrasives that could damage non-stick coatings. Check our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaning guide</a> for more tips."
faqQ4: "Why do my air fryer cakes sometimes taste too sweet?"
faqA4: "Air fryers concentrate flavours more than conventional ovens, which can make sugar taste more intense. If your cakes taste too sweet, try reducing the sugar by 10-15g (about 0.35-0.53 ounces) while keeping other ingredients the same. The rapid air circulation enhances sweetness perception, so less sugar is often needed."

<p>100g of granulated sugar equals approximately 3.53 ounces. This conversion is essential for precise baking, especially when using an air fryer where measurements can make or break your recipe. Whether you're whipping up cakes or cookies, getting the sugar quantity right ensures perfect results every time.</p>

<h2>Why accurate sugar measurements matter in air fryer baking</h2>
<p>Air fryers cook food differently than conventional ovens, circulating hot air rapidly around the ingredients. This means your measurements need to be spot-on to avoid dry or overly sweet results. Granulated sugar affects texture, browning and moisture retention in baked goods. Too little and your <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>air fryer cakes</a> won't brown properly. Too much and they may become sticky or burn.</p>
<p>Many British recipes use grams while some older cookbooks still reference ounces. Knowing that 100g granulated sugar equals 3.53 ounces helps bridge this measurement gap. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> makes these calculations simple for all your baking needs.</p>

<h2>How to measure 100g of granulated sugar without scales</h2>
<p>If you don't have digital scales handy, you can use volume measurements as a rough guide. 100g of granulated sugar equals about 8 level tablespoons or half a US cup. However, we always recommend using scales for baking where precision matters most. The density of sugar can vary slightly depending on how compacted it is in your measuring cup.</p>
<p>For the most accurate results in your air fryer, invest in a set of digital kitchen scales that measure in both grams and ounces. This takes the guesswork out of converting 100g granulated sugar to ounces and ensures your <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cookies>air fryer cookies</a> turn out perfectly every time.</p>

<h3>The science behind sugar measurements</h3>
<p>Granulated sugar weighs about 200g per cup, though this can vary by about 10-15g depending on how you scoop it. That's why weight measurements (grams or ounces) are more reliable than volume measurements for baking. When converting 100g of granulated sugar to ounces, you're dealing with a standard conversion factor where 1 ounce equals approximately 28.35 grams.</p>

<h2>Common air fryer recipes using 100g sugar</h2>
<p>Many popular air fryer desserts call for around 100g of granulated sugar. This includes small batch brownies, fairy cakes, and shortbread biscuits. The 100g measurement (3.53 ounces) is ideal for recipes serving 4-6 portions in most standard air fryer baskets.</p>
<p>If you're adapting a conventional oven recipe for your air fryer, you might need to slightly reduce the sugar quantity. Air fryers intensify flavours and can make sweets taste more sugary. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipe collection</a> includes many tested recipes with perfect sugar measurements.</p>

<h3>Storing granulated sugar for air fryer baking</h3>
<p>Keep your granulated sugar in an airtight container to prevent clumping and moisture absorption. This ensures your 100g measurements remain accurate over time. For best results in air fryer baking, use fresh, free-flowing sugar rather than hardened or compacted sugar that may have absorbed kitchen humidity.</p>

<h2>Converting other sugar quantities</h2>
<p>Once you know that 100g equals 3.53 ounces, you can easily calculate other amounts. For example, 50g would be 1.76 ounces, while 200g would be 7.05 ounces. This knowledge helps when scaling recipes up or down for your air fryer's capacity.</p>
<p>Remember that different types of sugar have slightly different weights. Icing sugar, for instance, is lighter than granulated sugar. Always check specific conversion charts when working with alternative sugars in your <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>air fryer recipes</a>.</p>

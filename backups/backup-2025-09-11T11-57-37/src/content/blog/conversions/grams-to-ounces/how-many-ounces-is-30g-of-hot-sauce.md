faqQ1: "Can I use a tablespoon to measure 30g of hot sauce?"
faqA1: "Yes, but it’s not always precise. A standard tablespoon holds about 15g of hot sauce, so 30g would be roughly two tablespoons. However, thicker sauces may vary, so a kitchen scale is recommended for accuracy."
faqQ2: "How does 30g of hot sauce compare to other condiments in ounces?"
faqA2: "30g of hot sauce equals 1.06 ounces, similar to about two tablespoons of ketchup or mustard. However, hot sauce is often denser, so weight measurements are more reliable than volume for consistent results."
faqQ3: "Why is 30g of hot sauce a common measurement in recipes?"
faqA3: "30g (1.06 oz) strikes a balance between adding noticeable heat without overwhelming the dish. It’s enough to flavour a meal for 2–4 people, making it a practical standard for many air fryer recipes."
faqQ4: "Does the type of hot sauce affect the 30g-to-ounces conversion?"
faqA4: "No, the conversion remains the same regardless of the hot sauce brand or variety. Whether it’s Tabasco or sriracha, 30g will always be 1.06 ounces. The difference lies in flavour intensity, not weight."

<h3>How to Measure 30g of Hot Sauce Accurately</h3>  
<p>A digital kitchen scale is the easiest way to measure 30g of hot sauce. Simply place your container on the scale, tare it to zero, and pour until you hit 30g. If you don’t have a scale, remember that 30g equals roughly two tablespoons, but this can vary slightly based on the sauce’s thickness. For sticky sauces, lightly grease your spoon to ensure all 30g slides off effortlessly.</p>

faqQ1: "Can I use other oils instead of vegetable oil in my air fryer?"
faqA1: "Yes, you can substitute vegetable oil with other oils like olive oil, sunflower oil, or even coconut oil. Just ensure you use the same weight (50g or 1.76 ounces) for consistent results. Some oils may have a stronger flavour, so choose based on your recipe."
faqQ2: "Why is 50g of vegetable oil a common measurement in air fryer recipes?"
faqA2: "50g of vegetable oil is enough to coat ingredients evenly without making them greasy. It’s a balanced quantity for achieving crispiness while keeping dishes light. Many recipes, like air-fried potatoes or chicken, rely on this amount for perfect texture."
faqQ3: "How do I store leftover vegetable oil after measuring 50g?"
faqA3: "Store leftover vegetable oil in a cool, dark place in an airtight container. Avoid exposing it to heat or sunlight, as this can degrade the oil’s quality. Use it within a few months for best results in your air fryer recipes."
faqQ4: "Is 50g of vegetable oil the same as 50ml?"
faqA4: "No, 50g of vegetable oil is not the same as 50ml. Oil is less dense than water, so 50g of vegetable oil equals roughly 55ml. Always measure by weight (grams or ounces) for accuracy in air fryer cooking."

faqQ1: "Can I use minced garlic instead of garlic paste for 75g?"
faqA1: "Yes, but the texture and intensity will differ. Minced garlic is less concentrated, so you might need slightly more to match the flavour of 75g (2.65 oz) of garlic paste. Adjust to taste and consider blending minced garlic into a paste for consistency."
faqQ2: "How does 75g of garlic paste compare to fresh garlic cloves?"
faqA2: "One medium garlic clove yields about 5g of paste, so 75g equals roughly 15 cloves. Garlic paste is more potent and evenly distributed, making it ideal for marinades. Fresh cloves offer a sharper bite but require more prep."
faqQ3: "Is 75g of garlic paste the same in US and UK measurements?"
faqA3: "Yes, 75g converts to 2.65 ounces in both US and UK measurements. However, UK recipes may default to grams, while US ones often use ounces. Always double-check your recipe’s origin for clarity."
faqQ4: "What’s the best way to clean my air fryer after using garlic paste?"
faqA4: "Garlic paste can leave strong odours. Wipe the basket with warm, soapy water, then use a mix of baking soda and lemon juice for lingering smells. For a deep clean, try our recommended <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner</a>."

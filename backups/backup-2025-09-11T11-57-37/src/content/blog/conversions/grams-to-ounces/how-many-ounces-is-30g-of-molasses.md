faqQ1: "Can I substitute honey for molasses in air fryer recipes?"
faqA1: "Yes, but honey is sweeter and thinner, so use 25% less and adjust cooking times. Molasses adds a deeper, richer flavour, so the result will differ slightly. For best results, stick to recipes designed for honey if you’re swapping."
faqQ2: "How do I clean molasses residue from my air fryer basket?"
faqA2: "Soak the basket in warm, soapy water to loosen the sticky residue. A soft brush or sponge helps remove stubborn bits. For tougher stains, a paste of baking soda and water works wonders. Always dry thoroughly before reuse."
faqQ3: "Why is my air-fried molasses glaze burning too quickly?"
faqA3: "Molasses has a high sugar content, which caramelises fast. Lower the temperature by 10°C and reduce cooking time by a few minutes. Covering the dish with foil for the first half of cooking can also prevent burning."
faqQ4: "Can I use blackstrap molasses in air fryer recipes?"
faqA4: "Blackstrap molasses is more bitter and less sweet than regular molasses. It works in savoury dishes but may overpower desserts. If substituting, reduce the quantity by half and balance with a touch of sugar or syrup."

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on even cooking, and incorrect measurements can throw off textures and flavours.

<h3>How to measure molasses without a scale</h3>  
<p>If you’re in a pinch, use the displacement method. Fill a measuring cup with water, note the level, then add molasses until the water rises by the equivalent of 1.06 ounces. This trick works well for sticky ingredients like molasses or honey. Just remember to grease your measuring spoon first to help the molasses slide out easily.</p>

faqQ1: "Can I use tablespoons instead of a scale to measure 75g of tahini?"

faqQ3: "How long does 75g of tahini last once opened?"
faqA3: "Opened tahini lasts up to 6 months in the fridge if stored properly. Stir it well before using your 75g portion, as oil separation is normal. Check for rancidity if it’s been stored for a while."
faqQ4: "Can I substitute other nut butters for tahini in air fryer recipes?"

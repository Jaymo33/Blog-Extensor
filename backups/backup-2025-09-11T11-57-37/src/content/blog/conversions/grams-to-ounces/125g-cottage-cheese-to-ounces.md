faqQ1: "Can I use cups instead of grams or ounces for cottage cheese?"
faqA1: "While possible, cups are less accurate due to cottage cheese’s variable density. For 125g (4.41 oz), roughly ½ cup works, but weighing ensures precision, especially in air fryer recipes where texture matters."
faqQ2: "Does cottage cheese weight change when cooked in an air fryer?"
faqA2: "Yes, cottage cheese loses moisture when heated, reducing its weight slightly. For dishes like fritters, account for a 5–10% weight loss. Pre-measuring 125g ensures consistent results."
faqQ3: "How long does 125g of cottage cheese last in the fridge?"
faqA3: "Once opened, 125g of cottage cheese stays fresh for 3–5 days. For air fryer recipes, use it within this window to avoid separation or off-flavours."
faqQ4: "Can I freeze 125g portions of cottage cheese?"
faqA4: "Freezing alters cottage cheese’s texture, making it grainy. It’s best used fresh, but if frozen, thaw it in the fridge and blend before adding to air fryer recipes like pancakes or fillings."

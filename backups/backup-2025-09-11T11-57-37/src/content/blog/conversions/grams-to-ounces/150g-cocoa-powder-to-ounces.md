faqQ1: "How do I convert 150g of cocoa powder to ounces without a scale?"
faqA1: "If you don’t have a scale, use the conversion rate of 1 gram = 0.035 ounces. Multiply 150g by 0.035 to get approximately 5.29 ounces. For accuracy, consider investing in a digital scale or referring to an online converter."
faqQ2: "Why is 150g of cocoa powder a common measurement in recipes?"
faqA2: "150g of cocoa powder is a standard amount for many chocolate-based recipes, providing the right balance of flavour without overpowering other ingredients. It’s frequently used in cakes, brownies, and cookies, especially in air fryer baking where precise ratios matter."
faqQ3: "Can I use volume measurements (cups) instead of weight for cocoa powder?"
faqA3: "While possible, weight measurements (grams or ounces) are more accurate for cocoa powder due to its density. One cup of cocoa powder is roughly 100g, so 150g would be about 1.5 cups. For best results, stick to weight measurements."
faqQ4: "Does the type of cocoa powder affect the conversion from grams to ounces?"
faqA4: "No, the conversion remains the same regardless of cocoa powder type (natural or Dutch-processed). However, Dutch-processed cocoa is slightly denser, so always measure by weight for consistency in air fryer recipes."

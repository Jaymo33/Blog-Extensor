faqQ1: "Is 50g of milk the same as 50ml?"
faqA1: "No, 50g of milk is not the same as 50ml. While they’re close, milk’s density means 50g is roughly 48.5ml. For precise air fryer recipes, always weigh ingredients like milk for accuracy."
faqQ2: "Can I use plant-based milk instead of regular milk in air fryer recipes?"
faqA2: "Yes, plant-based milk can replace regular milk in most air fryer recipes. Just ensure you measure 50g (1.76 ounces) by weight, as thickness may vary. Almond, soy, or oat milk work well with minor adjustments."
faqQ3: "Why do air fryer recipes often use grams instead of ounces?"
faqA3: "Many air fryer recipes use grams because it’s a more precise measurement system, especially for small quantities like 50g of milk. Digital scales often default to grams, making it easier for consistent results."
faqQ4: "How do I convert larger amounts of milk from grams to ounces?"
faqA4: "To convert larger amounts, multiply the grams by 0.035 to get ounces. For example, 100g of milk is 3.5 ounces. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a> simplifies this for all your air fryer needs."

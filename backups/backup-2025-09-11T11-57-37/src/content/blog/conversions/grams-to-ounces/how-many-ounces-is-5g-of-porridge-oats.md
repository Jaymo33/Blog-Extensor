faqQ1: "Can I use a measuring spoon instead of a scale for 5g of porridge oats?"
faqA1: "Yes, a level tablespoon of porridge oats is roughly 5g, but this can vary slightly depending on the oat type and how tightly packed they are. For the most accurate results, especially in air fryer recipes, a digital scale is best."
faqQ2: "Does 5g of porridge oats change weight when cooked?"
faqA2: "Porridge oats absorb liquid when cooked, so their weight increases, but the dry measurement (5g or 0.18 oz) remains the same. In air fryer recipes, oats are often used dry for texture, so no adjustment is needed."
faqQ3: "How many calories are in 5g of porridge oats?"
faqA3: "5g of porridge oats contains about 19 calories. This small portion is perfect for adding crunch to yoghurt or as part of a larger air fryer recipe without significantly increasing calorie intake."
faqQ4: "Can I substitute instant oats for porridge oats in a 5g measurement?"
faqA4: "Yes, instant oats and porridge oats have similar weights, so 5g (0.18 oz) of either will work in air fryer recipes. However, instant oats may cook faster, so adjust cooking times slightly if needed."

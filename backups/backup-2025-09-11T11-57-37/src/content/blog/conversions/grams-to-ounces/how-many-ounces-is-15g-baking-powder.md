faqQ1: "How do I measure 15g of baking powder without a scale?"
faqA1: "You can use a tablespoon to measure 15g of baking powder, as one level tablespoon is roughly equivalent to 15g (0.53 oz). However, for the most accurate results, a digital kitchen scale is recommended, especially for air fryer baking where precision matters."
faqQ2: "Why is 15g of baking powder important in air fryer recipes?"
faqA2: "Baking powder is a leavening agent, and 15g (0.53 oz) is often the perfect amount to ensure your baked goods rise properly in the air fryer. Too little can result in dense textures, while too much may cause bitterness or collapse."
faqQ3: "Can I use 15g of baking powder for savoury air fryer dishes?"

faqQ4: "How long does 15g of baking powder last once opened?"
faqA4: "Once opened, baking powder typically lasts 6–12 months if stored in a cool, dry place. To test its potency, mix a teaspoon with hot water—if it bubbles vigorously, it’s still active. If not, it’s time to replace it for optimal air fryer results."

<h2>Tips for storing baking powder for air fryer use</h2>  
<p>To maintain its effectiveness, store baking powder in a cool, dry place. Exposure to moisture can cause it to clump or lose potency, which could throw off your measurements. Always check the expiry date, as old baking powder may not provide the same lift in your air fryer recipes.</p>

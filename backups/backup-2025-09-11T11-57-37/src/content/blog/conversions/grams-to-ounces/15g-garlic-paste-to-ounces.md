faqQ1: "Can I use fresh garlic instead of 15g of garlic paste?"
faqA1: "Yes, you can substitute fresh garlic for garlic paste. One clove of fresh garlic is roughly equivalent to 5g of paste, so you’d need about three cloves to match 15g (0.53 oz). Adjust to taste, as fresh garlic can be stronger."
faqQ2: "How long does 15g of garlic paste last in the fridge?"
faqA2: "An opened jar of garlic paste typically lasts 2–3 weeks in the fridge. Store it in an airtight container to preserve freshness. Always check for off smells or discolouration before use."
faqQ3: "Does 15g of garlic paste weigh the same as minced garlic?"
faqA3: "No, minced garlic is less concentrated than paste. 15g of minced garlic equals about 0.53 oz, but you may need slightly more for the same flavour intensity. Adjust recipes accordingly."
faqQ4: "Can I freeze 15g portions of garlic paste?"
faqA4: "Yes, freezing garlic paste in 15g (0.53 oz) portions works well. Use ice cube trays for easy storage. Thaw in the fridge before use for best results."

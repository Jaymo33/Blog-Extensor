At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we understand how crucial precise measurements are for perfect results. Let’s dive deeper into butter conversions and how they apply to your cooking.</p>  

<h2>Why Convert 500g of Butter to Ounces?</h2>  
<p>Many UK recipes, especially those for air fryers, use grams, while some older cookbooks or international recipes rely on ounces. Converting 500g of butter to ounces (17.64 oz) helps maintain consistency. If you’re using an air fryer for baking, even small measurement errors can affect texture and rise.

<p>Butter is a staple in dishes like air-fryer cakes or cookies, where precision matters. A 500g block is common in UK supermarkets, so knowing its ounce equivalent simplifies scaling recipes. For example, if a US recipe calls for 16 oz of butter, you’ll know 500g is slightly more—adjust accordingly!</p>  

<h3>How to Measure 500g of Butter Without Scales</h3>  
<p>No scales? No problem! A standard UK block of butter is 250g, so two blocks make 500g (or roughly 17.64 oz). Each tablespoon of butter is about 14g, so 500g equals roughly 36 tablespoons. This method is handy for quick <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> where precision isn’t critical.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for 500g of Butter in Air Fryers</h2>

<h3>Storing 500g of Butter for Air Fryer Recipes</h3>

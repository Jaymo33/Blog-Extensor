faqQ1: "Is 20g of flour the same as 20g of other ingredients in ounces?"
faqA1: "No, weight-to-volume conversions vary by ingredient. While 20g of flour is about 0.71 oz, 20g of sugar or butter would differ due to density. Always check specific conversions for each ingredient."
faqQ2: "Can I use cups instead of ounces for 20g of flour?"
faqA2: "Yes, but it’s less precise. Roughly, 20g of flour is 1/8 cup (using the spoon-and-level method). For air fryer recipes, scales or ounce conversions are more reliable for consistent results."
faqQ3: "Why do some UK recipes use grams and others ounces?"
faqA3: "The UK uses both metric (grams) and imperial (ounces) measurements. Grams are more common in baking for precision, while ounces appear in older or adapted recipes. Always double-check which unit your recipe uses."
faqQ4: "How do I clean flour residue from my air fryer basket?"
faqA4: "After cooking, let the basket cool, then wipe with a damp cloth or use a soft brush. For stubborn flour, try a non-abrasive <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner</a> to maintain your appliance."

<p>20 grams of flour equals approximately 0.71 ounces. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precision matters, especially when baking or coating ingredients. Whether you're whipping up air fryer cookies or breaded chicken, knowing how many ounces 20g of flour is can make all the difference.</p>

<h2>Why Convert 20g of Flour to Ounces?</h2>
<p>Many UK recipes, especially those for air fryers, use grams, but some cooks prefer ounces for measuring. Converting 20g of flour to ounces ensures accuracy, whether you're following a recipe from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> or adapting a family favourite. A slight mismeasurement can affect texture, so getting it right matters.</p>
<p>Air fryer recipes often require small quantities, like 20g of flour for dusting or battering. If your scales only show ounces, this conversion is a lifesaver. Plus, understanding both metrics helps when using international recipes or meal prepping.</p>

<h2>How to Measure 20g of Flour Accurately</h2>
<p>For the best results, use digital kitchen scales set to grams. If you only have ounce measurements, remember that 20g of flour is roughly 0.71 oz. Spoon the flour lightly into a measuring cup to avoid compacting it, which can lead to over-measuring.</p>
<p>Air fryer cooking thrives on precision, especially for baked goods like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>air fryer cakes</a>. Too much flour can make them dense, while too little affects structure. If you're converting 20g of flour to ounces often, bookmark this guide for quick reference.</p>

<h3>Common Uses for 20g of Flour in Air Fryers</h3>
<p>This small amount is perfect for light coatings, such as dusting chicken wings or making tempura batter for veggies. It’s also ideal for thickening sauces or creating crispy layers in <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/potatoes>air fryer potato recipes</a>.</p>

<h2>Conversion Tips for Other Quantities</h2>
<p>If your recipe calls for more or less flour, here’s a handy rule: 1 ounce equals about 28.35 grams. So, 10g is roughly 0.35 oz, and 50g is around 1.76 oz. Keep an <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> nearby for quick checks.</p>
<p>For larger batches, like meal prepping <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/meal-prep>air fryer freezer meals</a>, scaling up conversions ensures consistency. Remember, flour type (plain, self-raising, or wholemeal) doesn’t change the weight-to-volume ratio significantly.</p>

<h3>When Precision Matters Most</h3>
<p>Baking in the air fryer, like making cookies or muffins, relies on exact measurements. Even 20g of flour can impact rise and texture. If you lack scales, use the spoon-and-level method for closest accuracy.</p>

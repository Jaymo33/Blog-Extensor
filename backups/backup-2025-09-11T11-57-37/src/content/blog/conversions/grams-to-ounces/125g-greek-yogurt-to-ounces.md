faqQ1: "Can I use regular yogurt instead of greek yogurt in air fryer recipes?"
faqA1: "While you can substitute regular yogurt, greek yogurt's thicker consistency works better in air fryer recipes. If using regular yogurt, reduce the quantity by about 25% as it's more watery. For 125g (4.41oz) of greek yogurt, you'd use about 95g (3.35oz) of regular yogurt."
faqQ2: "How many calories are in 125g of greek yogurt?"
faqA2: "The calorie content depends on the fat content. Full-fat greek yogurt contains about 130-150 calories per 125g (4.41oz), while low-fat versions have about 80-100 calories. Always check the nutritional information on your specific brand for accurate details."
faqQ3: "Can I freeze 125g portions of greek yogurt for later use?"
faqA3: "Yes, you can freeze greek yogurt in 125g portions, though the texture may become slightly grainy after thawing. It's best used in cooked dishes like marinades or baking after freezing. Thaw in the fridge overnight before use for best results."
faqQ4: "What's the best way to measure 125g of greek yogurt without scales?"
faqA4: "Without scales, you can use measuring spoons - 125g (4.41oz) is approximately 8 level tablespoons of greek yogurt. Alternatively, it's roughly half a standard UK small pot (250g) of yogurt. For most accurate results in air fryer recipes, we recommend investing in digital scales."

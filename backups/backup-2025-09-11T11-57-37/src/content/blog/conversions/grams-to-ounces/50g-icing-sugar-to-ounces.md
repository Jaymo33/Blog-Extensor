faqQ1: "Can I use granulated sugar instead of icing sugar for 50g?"
faqA1: "No, granulated sugar won’t work the same way. Icing sugar is finely ground and contains cornflour, which affects texture. For frostings or dusting, stick to icing sugar."
faqQ2: "How do I measure 50g of icing sugar without scales?"
faqA2: "Use tablespoons: 6 level tablespoons equal roughly 50g. For accuracy, fluff the sugar first and spoon it lightly into the measuring spoon."
faqQ3: "Why does my icing sugar clump when stored?"
faqA3: "Humidity causes clumping. Store it in an airtight container with a silica gel packet to absorb moisture. Sift before use if needed."
faqQ4: "Can I use this conversion for other types of sugar?"
faqA4: "The gram-to-ounce ratio is the same, but textures vary. Brown or caster sugar may measure differently by volume, so weighing is best."

<p>50g of icing sugar equals approximately 1.76 ounces. This conversion is essential for bakers and home cooks who need precise measurements for recipes, especially when using an air fryer for desserts. Whether you're making frosting, dusting cakes, or preparing a sweet treat, knowing how to convert grams to ounces ensures accuracy.</p>  

<h2>Why Convert 50g of Icing Sugar to Ounces?</h2>  
<p>Many UK recipes use grams, while others rely on ounces, making conversions necessary. If you're following an international recipe or using kitchen scales with different units, knowing that 50g of icing sugar is roughly 1.76 ounces saves time. This is particularly useful for air fryer recipes, where precise measurements can affect texture and consistency.</p>  

<p>For example, if you're baking air fryer cookies or cakes from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, getting the sugar ratio right ensures perfect results. Too much or too little can alter the sweetness and structure of your dessert. A digital scale helps, but if yours only displays ounces, this conversion is a lifesaver.</p>  

<h2>How to Measure 50g of Icing Sugar Without Scales</h2>  
<p>Don’t have a kitchen scale? No problem! You can still measure 50g of icing sugar using volume equivalents. One tablespoon of icing sugar weighs about 8g, so 50g would be roughly 6 tablespoons. However, this method isn’t as precise as weighing, especially for delicate recipes like macarons or meringues.</p>  

<p>For best results, invest in a digital scale that switches between grams and ounces. Many affordable options are available, and they’re perfect for air fryer cooking, where precision matters.

<h3>Converting Other Sugar Amounts</h3>

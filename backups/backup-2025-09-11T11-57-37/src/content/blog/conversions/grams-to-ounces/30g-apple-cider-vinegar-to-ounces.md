faqQ1: "Is 30g of apple cider vinegar the same as 30ml?"
faqA1: "No, 30g of apple cider vinegar is not exactly the same as 30ml. While they're close in volume, weight (grams) and volume (millilitres) measure different properties. The density of apple cider vinegar means that 30g equals about 28.5ml, though for most cooking purposes this small difference won't significantly affect your recipe."
faqQ2: "Can I use a regular spoon to measure 30g of apple cider vinegar?"
faqA2: "While you can use spoons for approximate measurements, they're not precise enough for exact 30g measurements. A tablespoon of apple cider vinegar typically weighs about 15g, so you'd need 2 tablespoons for 30g. However, for accurate results in air fryer cooking, especially with marinades, using digital scales is recommended."
faqQ3: "Does the conversion change for different types of vinegar?"
faqA3: "The conversion from grams to ounces is essentially the same for all vinegars, as their densities are quite similar. Whether you're working with apple cider, white, or balsamic vinegar, 30g will always equal about 1.06 ounces. The minor density variations between vinegar types won't significantly affect this conversion in home cooking."
faqQ4: "Why do some recipes use grams instead of ounces for liquids?"
faqA4: "Many professional recipes and those from metric-using countries specify liquids in grams because weight measurements are more precise than volume measurements. Measuring 30g of apple cider vinegar by weight eliminates variables like meniscus reading errors or slight density changes due to temperature, ensuring consistent results in your air fryer cooking."

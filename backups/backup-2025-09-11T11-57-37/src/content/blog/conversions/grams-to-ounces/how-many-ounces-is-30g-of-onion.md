<h2>Why Convert 30g of Onion to Ounces?</h2>
<p>Converting 30g of onion to ounces is essential for following recipes accurately, especially in air fryer cooking. Many UK recipes use grams, while others might reference ounces, so knowing both is useful. For example, if a recipe calls for 30g of onion and your scales only measure in ounces, you'll need 1.06 ounces. This small but crucial detail can make or break a dish.</p>
<p>Precision matters in air fryer cooking because ingredients cook quickly and evenly. Too much or too little onion can affect texture and flavour.

<p>Don’t have scales? No problem! You can estimate 30g of onion by volume. One small onion, roughly the size of a golf ball, weighs about 30g or 1.06 ounces. Alternatively, half a medium onion or a heaped tablespoon of finely chopped onion will do the trick. This method isn’t as precise as weighing, but it works in a pinch.</p>
<p>For air fryer recipes, consistency is key. If you’re making a batch of <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable dishes</a>, eyeballing 30g of onion ensures even cooking.

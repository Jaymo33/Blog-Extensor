faqQ1: "Is 40g of coconut oil the same as 40ml?"
faqA1: "No, 40g and 40ml of coconut oil aren't identical. Weight (grams) and volume (ml) measure different properties. For coconut oil, 40g equals about 44ml when melted due to its density. Always check whether your recipe specifies weight or volume measurements."
faqQ2: "Can I substitute butter for 40g of coconut oil in air fryer recipes?"
faqA2: "Yes, you can generally substitute butter for coconut oil at a 1:1 ratio. However, butter contains water that coconut oil doesn't, which may slightly affect cooking times and browning. For best results, reduce other liquids in the recipe slightly when using butter instead."
faqQ3: "How many calories are in 40g of coconut oil?"
faqA3: "40g of coconut oil contains approximately 354 calories. It's energy-dense, so a little goes a long way in air fryer cooking. The good news is you typically use less oil in an air fryer compared to traditional frying methods."
faqQ4: "Does coconut oil smoke at air fryer temperatures?"
faqA4: "Refined coconut oil has a smoke point of about 232째C (450째F), making it suitable for most air frying. Unrefined (virgin) coconut oil smokes at around 177째C (350째F), so it's better for lower temperature cooking. Always monitor your air fryer when using oils."

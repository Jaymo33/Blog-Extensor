faqQ1: "Can I use margarine instead of butter for 40g in air fryer recipes?"
faqA1: "Yes, you can substitute margarine for butter in most air fryer recipes. However, margarine has a higher water content, which might affect texture. For best results, stick to butter unless the recipe specifies otherwise."
faqQ2: "How do I measure 40g of butter if I don’t have a scale?"
faqA2: "You can use tablespoons to measure 40g of butter—about 2.8 tablespoons. For more accuracy, refer to the markings on butter packaging, which often show gram measurements per segment."
faqQ3: "Why does my air fryer smoke when I use butter?"
faqA3: "Butter has a low smoke point, which can cause smoking in the air fryer. To prevent this, use clarified butter or reduce the amount slightly. Always preheat your air fryer to avoid sudden temperature changes."
faqQ4: "Is 40g of butter the same as 40ml?"
faqA4: "No, grams measure weight, while millilitres measure volume. Butter’s density means 40g is roughly 42ml, but for accuracy, always weigh it. This is especially important in air fryer baking."

<h2>How to Measure 40g of Butter Without a Scale</h2>

<h2>Common Mistakes When Measuring Butter</h2>  
<p>One mistake people make is using cold butter straight from the fridge, which is harder to measure accurately. For best results, let butter soften slightly before measuring 40g. Another error is packing butter into a measuring cup, which can lead to over-measuring. Instead, use the spoon-and-level method for tablespoons or weigh it directly.

faqQ1: "Can I use 0.25 tbsp of cottage cheese in all air fryer recipes?"
faqA1: "Yes, 0.25 tbsp (3.75g) of cottage cheese works in most air fryer recipes where small amounts are needed. It's perfect for toppings, fillings, or when you want just a hint of creaminess. However, for recipes requiring larger quantities, you'll need to scale up accordingly while maintaining the same ratio."
faqQ2: "How do I measure 0.25 tbsp of cottage cheese without special spoons?"
faqA2: "If you don't have a 0.25 tbsp measure, you can use a regular tablespoon and fill it to one-quarter capacity. Alternatively, use a digital scale to measure out exactly 3.75 grams. Another method is to divide 1 teaspoon (5g) into approximately three-quarters for close accuracy."
faqQ3: "Does the fat content affect the 0.25 tbsp to grams conversion?"
faqA3: "The fat content slightly affects the weight, but not significantly for small amounts like 0.25 tbsp. Full-fat cottage cheese might weigh marginally more than low-fat versions, but the difference in 3.75 grams is negligible for most air fryer cooking purposes."
faqQ4: "Can I substitute ricotta for 0.25 tbsp of cottage cheese?"
faqA4: "Yes, you can substitute ricotta for cottage cheese in a 1:1 ratio by volume (0.25 tbsp to 0.25 tbsp). However, ricotta is slightly denser, so by weight you'd use about 4 grams instead of 3.75 grams. The texture difference might be noticeable in some air fryer recipes."

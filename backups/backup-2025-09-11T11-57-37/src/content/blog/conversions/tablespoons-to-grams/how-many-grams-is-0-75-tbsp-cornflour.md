faqQ1: "Can I substitute plain flour for cornflour in air fryer recipes?"
faqA1: "Yes, but the results will differ. Cornflour creates a crispier texture due to its finer consistency. If substituting, use the same weight (5.6g for 0.75 tbsp), but expect a slightly less crunchy outcome."
faqQ2: "Why does my air fryer coating turn out soggy?"
faqA2: "Sogginess often occurs if too much cornflour is used or if the food isn’t patted dry before coating. Stick to precise measurements like 0.75 tbsp (5.6g) of cornflour and ensure ingredients are dry for optimal crispiness."
faqQ3: "How do I convert grams back to tablespoons for cornflour?"
faqA3: "To convert grams to tablespoons, divide the gram amount by 7.5 (since 1 tbsp ≈ 7.5g). For example, 5.6g of cornflour equals 0.75 tbsp. Always level off the spoon for accuracy."
faqQ4: "Is cornflour gluten-free for air fryer cooking?"
faqA4: "Yes, cornflour is naturally gluten-free, making it ideal for gluten-free air fryer recipes. Just ensure your other ingredients are also gluten-free if needed. Measure carefully—0.75 tbsp (5.6g) works perfectly for coatings and thickeners."

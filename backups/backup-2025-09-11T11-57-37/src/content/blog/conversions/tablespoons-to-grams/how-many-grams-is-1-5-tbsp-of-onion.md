faqQ1: "Can I use dried onion instead of fresh for 1.5 tbsp?"
faqA1: "Yes, but the conversion differs. 1.5 tbsp of fresh onion equals about 1 tsp of dried onion flakes. Rehydrate dried onion with water before use for better texture in air fryer recipes."
faqQ2: "Does the type of onion affect the weight per tablespoon?"
faqA2: "Slightly. Red onions are denser than white or yellow varieties, so 1.5 tbsp may weigh closer to 12 grams. For most recipes, the 11-gram average works well."
faqQ3: "How do I convert grams back to tablespoons if my scale fails?"
faqA3: "As a rule, 1 gram of chopped onion equals roughly 0.14 tbsp. So 11 grams would be just under 1.5 tbsp. Keep a set of measuring spoons handy for backup."
faqQ4: "Will 1.5 tbsp of onion change weight when cooked in the air fryer?"
faqA4: "Yes, onions lose about 25% of their weight when air-fried due to moisture loss. For recipes requiring cooked onion, start with 15 grams (2 tbsp) to yield 11 grams after cooking."

<h2>Why Accurate Onion Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Getting the right amount of onion is crucial for balancing flavours in your air fryer dishes. Too much can overpower, while too little might leave your meal tasting bland. Onions also contain moisture, which affects cooking times—another reason why grams are more reliable than volume measurements.

<p>For UK cooks, tablespoon sizes are standardised, but onion density can vary based on how finely it’s chopped. That’s why weighing in grams removes the guesswork. Whether you’re making crispy onion toppings or a savoury base for sauces, precision ensures perfect results every time.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure 1.5 Tbsp of Onion Correctly</h3>  
<p>Use a flat-edged knife to level off your tablespoon for an exact 1.5 tbsp measurement. For even greater accuracy, a kitchen scale is ideal—especially if you’re scaling recipes up or down.

<h2>Common Recipes Using 1.5 Tbsp Onion</h2>

<h3>Tips for Storing Leftover Onion</h3>

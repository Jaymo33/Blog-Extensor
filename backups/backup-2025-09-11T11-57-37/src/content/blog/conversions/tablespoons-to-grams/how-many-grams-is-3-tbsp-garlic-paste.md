faqQ1: "Can I use minced garlic instead of garlic paste in my air fryer recipes?"
faqA1: "Yes, but the measurements differ. Minced garlic is less dense, so 3 tbsp ≈ 25–30 grams. Adjust quantities to avoid overpowering your dish. For precise conversions, refer to our air fryer conversion chart."
faqQ2: "How do I make homemade garlic paste for air fryer cooking?"
faqA2: "Blend peeled garlic cloves with a bit of oil or water until smooth. Store it in the fridge for up to 2 weeks. Homemade paste lets you control texture and flavour, perfect for marinades."
faqQ3: "Why does my garlic paste burn in the air fryer?"
faqA3: "Garlic burns easily due to its high sugar content. Mix it with oil or other ingredients before air frying, and cook at lower temperatures (160°C or less) for even results."
faqQ4: "Is garlic paste healthier than fresh garlic in air fryer meals?"
faqA4: "Both offer similar health benefits, but paste is more concentrated. Use slightly less paste than fresh garlic to balance flavour. Always opt for preservative-free versions for the best results."

<p>3 tablespoons of garlic paste equals approximately 45 grams. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements ensure perfect flavour balance. Whether you're whipping up a marinade or seasoning meats, knowing the exact weight helps avoid over or under-seasoning. Garlic paste is a staple in many dishes, from curries to roasted vegetables, and getting the measurement right can elevate your cooking.

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on even heat distribution, so ingredient quantities must be precise for consistent results. Too much garlic paste can overpower a dish, while too little might leave it bland. Measuring by weight (grams) is more reliable than volume (tablespoons) because density varies. For example, a heaped tablespoon of garlic paste will weigh more than a levelled one. This is especially important when following recipes from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, where balanced flavours are key.</p>  

<p>Garlic paste is often used in marinades for chicken, beef, or vegetables, all of which cook beautifully in an air fryer. A precise 45-gram measure ensures your spices and herbs blend harmoniously. If you're meal prepping, accurate conversions save time and reduce waste. Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipe category</a> for ideas on using garlic paste effectively.</p>  

<h2>How to Measure 3 Tbsp of Garlic Paste Correctly</h2>  
<p>To measure 3 tablespoons of garlic paste accurately, use a standard UK tablespoon (15ml per tbsp). Scoop the paste without packing it down, then level off the excess with a knife. For sticky pastes, lightly oil the spoon first to help it slide off easily. If you don’t have scales, remember that 1 tbsp ≈ 15 grams, so 3 tbsp ≈ 45 grams. This method works for most recipes on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>.</p>  

<h3>Common Mistakes When Measuring Garlic Paste</h3>  
<p>One mistake is using a heaped tablespoon, which can add up to 20% extra weight. Another is guessing the amount, which risks uneven seasoning. Always measure rather than eyeball, especially for strong flavours like garlic. If your paste is very thick, warm the spoon slightly to make it easier to handle. For more tips, see our guide on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning your air fryer</a> after working with sticky ingredients.</p>  

<h2>Converting Other Garlic Paste Measurements</h2>  
<p>If your recipe calls for a different amount, here’s a quick reference: 1 tbsp = 15g, 2 tbsp = 30g, and 4 tbsp = 60g. For smaller quantities, 1 tsp ≈ 5g. These conversions are handy when scaling recipes up or down. Garlic paste is versatile, perfect for everything from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>roasted vegetables</a> to marinades, so bookmark this guide for future use.</p>  

<h3>Storing Garlic Paste for Freshness</h3>  
<p>To keep garlic paste fresh, store it in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 2 weeks. For longer storage, freeze it in ice cube trays (each cube ≈ 1 tbsp). Thaw before use to maintain consistency. Proper storage ensures your 3-tbsp (45g) measures are as flavourful as possible.</p>

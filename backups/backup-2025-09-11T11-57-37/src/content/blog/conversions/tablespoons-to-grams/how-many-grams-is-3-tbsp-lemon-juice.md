faqQ1: "Can I use bottled lemon juice instead of fresh for air fryer recipes?"
faqA1: "Yes, bottled lemon juice can be used, but fresh lemon juice often has a brighter, more natural flavour. If substituting, ensure the bottled juice is pure with no added sugars or preservatives. The conversion remains the same: 3 tbsp equals 45 grams."
faqQ2: "Does the temperature of lemon juice affect the weight measurement?"
faqA2: "No, the temperature of lemon juice doesn’t significantly impact its weight. Whether cold or room temperature, 3 tbsp of lemon juice will still weigh approximately 45 grams. However, chilled juice may pour more slowly, so measure carefully."
faqQ3: "How do I adjust lemon juice measurements for a larger air fryer batch?"
faqA3: "Simply scale the measurement proportionally. For example, if a recipe calls for 3 tbsp (45g) per serving and you’re making four servings, use 12 tbsp (180g). Always mix well to ensure even distribution of flavours in your air fryer."
faqQ4: "What if I don’t have a kitchen scale to measure 3 tbsp lemon juice in grams?"
faqA4: "If you don’t have a scale, use standard measuring spoons. Fill the tablespoon to the brim three times for 3 tbsp (45g). For smaller amounts, use teaspoons—1 tbsp equals 3 tsp, so 9 tsp would also give you 45 grams of lemon juice."

faqQ1: "Can I use plain flour instead of self-raising flour for 0.5 tbsp measurements?"
faqA1: "Yes, but you’ll need to add baking powder. For every 0.5 tbsp (4g) of plain flour, mix in 1/8 tsp of baking powder to mimic self-raising flour. This ensures your air fryer bakes rise properly."
faqQ2: "Why does my air fryer recipe specify grams instead of tablespoons for flour?"
faqA2: "Grams provide precision, especially in air fryers where small cavities need exact measurements. Tablespoons can vary based on how flour is packed, but grams guarantee consistent results every time."
faqQ3: "How do I store self-raising flour to keep it fresh for small measurements?"
faqA3: "Store in an airtight container in a cool, dry place. Self-raising flour loses potency over time, so label it with the purchase date and use within 3 months for best results in air fryer recipes."
faqQ4: "Can I double this conversion for 1 tbsp of self-raising flour?"
faqA4: "Absolutely! 1 tbsp equals roughly 8 grams of self-raising flour. This scaling works for most air fryer recipes, from muffins to coatings. Just ensure you’re using the spoon-and-level method for accuracy."

<p>0.5 tbsp of self-raising flour equals approximately 4 grams. This precise measurement is essential for air fryer baking, where accuracy ensures light, fluffy results. Whether you’re adjusting a recipe or scaling down ingredients, knowing this conversion saves time and avoids guesswork.

<h2>Why accurate flour measurements matter</h2>  
<p>Self-raising flour contains baking powder, so even small deviations can affect your air fryer bakes. Too much flour leads to dense cakes, while too little results in flat, crumbly textures. Measuring 0.5 tbsp as 4 grams guarantees consistency, especially for smaller batches. If you’re baking <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>air fryer cakes</a>, precision is key to achieving that perfect rise.</p>  

<p>Digital scales are ideal for tiny quantities like 0.5 tbsp, but if you’re using spoons, fluff the flour first for an even measure. Always level off the spoon with a knife for accuracy.

<h3>Converting other flour quantities</h3>  
<p>If your recipe calls for 1 tbsp of self-raising flour, that’s roughly 8 grams. Doubling or halving measurements becomes simple once you know the base conversion. For larger batches, like those in our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cookies>cookie recipes</a>, scaling up ensures uniform texture and bake.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for 0.5 tbsp of self-raising flour</h2>  
<p>This small quantity often appears in recipes for single-serving desserts or coatings. For example, dusting fruit before air frying or thickening a sauce for one. It’s also handy for adjusting batter consistency in mini <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>desserts</a> without overdoing it.</p>  

<p>When reheating fried foods in your air fryer, a light 0.5 tbsp flour coating can restore crispiness. Just mix with a pinch of seasoning for extra flavour.

<h3>Measuring without scales</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have scales, use the spoon-and-level method for 0.5 tbsp. Gently spoon flour into the measuring spoon until heaped, then level with a straight edge. Avoid tapping or packing the flour, as this compacts it and skews the weight. For sticky ingredients, a quick spray of oil on the spoon helps release every gram.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Using the correct amount of breadcrumbs ensures your food cooks evenly and achieves that desirable crunch. Too little, and your coating might be patchy; too much, and it could become overly dry. For air fryer recipes, 3 tbsp of breadcrumbs to grams is a common conversion, especially for dishes like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>air-fried chicken</a> or crispy tofu.

<h3>How to Measure Breadcrumbs Correctly</h3>  
<p>To get an accurate 3 tbsp breadcrumbs in grams measurement, use a kitchen scale for precision. Spoon the breadcrumbs into the tablespoon without packing them down, then level off the excess. This method prevents over-measuring, which can affect texture. If you're preparing a larger batch, multiply accordingly—for example, 6 tbsp would be roughly 42 grams.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for 3 tbsp of Breadcrumbs in Air Fryers</h2>  
<p>Three tablespoons of breadcrumbs are perfect for coating small portions, like a single chicken breast or a serving of <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/shrimp>air-fried shrimp</a>. This amount provides enough coverage without overwhelming the dish. Breadcrumbs add texture and help lock in moisture, making them a staple for air fryer cooking. Whether you're making nuggets, fish fillets, or veggie patties, 21 grams of breadcrumbs will give you that ideal crunch.</p>  

<p>For recipes like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air-fryer meatballs</a>, you might need to adjust the quantity based on the mixture's stickiness. Always start with 3 tbsp (21g) and add more if needed. Storing leftover breadcrumbs in an airtight container ensures they stay fresh for future use—just weigh them again to maintain accuracy.</p>  

<h3>Converting Other Breadcrumb Amounts</h3>  
<p>If your recipe calls for a different quantity, here's a quick reference: 1 tbsp of breadcrumbs is about 7 grams, and 1/2 tbsp is roughly 3.5 grams. For larger batches, 100 grams of breadcrumbs equal around 14 tbsp. Keep these conversions handy, especially when experimenting with new dishes in your air fryer.</p>  

<h2>Tips for Perfect Breadcrumb Coating</h2>  
<p>To ensure your breadcrumbs adhere well, pat your protein or veggies dry before coating. Dip them in flour, then egg, and finally the breadcrumbs for a flawless finish. For extra crispiness, lightly spray the coated food with oil before air frying. This technique works wonders for everything from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>air-fried vegetables</a> to mozzarella sticks.</p>  

<p>If you're out of breadcrumbs, crushed cornflakes or panko make great substitutes—just adjust the weight accordingly.

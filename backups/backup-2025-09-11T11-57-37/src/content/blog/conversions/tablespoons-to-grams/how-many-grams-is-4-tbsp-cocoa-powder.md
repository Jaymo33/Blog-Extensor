faqQ1: "Does 4 tbsp of cocoa powder weigh the same as 4 tbsp of flour?"
faqA1: "No, 4 tbsp of cocoa powder (24g) weighs less than 4 tbsp of flour (around 32g). Cocoa powder is denser but lighter by volume due to its fine texture. Always check weight conversions for accuracy in air fryer baking."
faqQ2: "Can I use drinking chocolate instead of cocoa powder for 4 tbsp in grams?"
faqA2: "Drinking chocolate contains sugar and milk powder, so it won’t provide the same results. For 4 tbsp (24g) of pure cocoa powder, stick to unsweetened varieties. Substitutes may alter taste and texture in air fryer recipes."
faqQ3: "Why do UK and US tablespoons differ for cocoa powder measurements?"
faqA3: "A UK tablespoon holds 15ml, while a US tablespoon is 14.8ml—a slight but meaningful difference in baking. For 4 tbsp cocoa powder, this can add up to a 1-2 gram variance. Always specify which measurement system your recipe uses."
faqQ4: "How should I store cocoa powder after measuring 4 tbsp for air fryer recipes?"
faqA4: "Keep cocoa powder in an airtight container in a cool, dark place to prevent clumping. Humidity can affect its weight and texture, so reseal it promptly after measuring your 4 tbsp (24g) portion. Proper storage ensures consistent results."

<p>British baking standards often rely on grams for consistency, so converting 4 tbsp cocoa powder to grams is a must. Digital kitchen scales are ideal for this, as scooping methods can vary.

faqQ1: "Does the type of yogurt affect the weight of 3 tablespoons?"
faqA1: "Yes, thicker yogurts like Greek or skyr will weigh slightly more per tablespoon due to lower water content. For standard plain yogurt, 3 tbsp equals 45 grams, but for Greek yogurt, it may be closer to 50 grams. Always check the product’s nutrition label for precise density."
faqQ2: "Can I use flavoured yogurt instead of plain for air fryer recipes?"
faqA2: "Flavoured yogurts contain added sugars and stabilisers, which can alter cooking results. Stick to plain yogurt for marinades and baking unless the recipe specifies otherwise. The 3 tbsp (45g) measurement applies only to unsweetened varieties."
faqQ3: "How do I convert grams back to tablespoons if a recipe lists yogurt by weight?"
faqA3: "Divide the gram amount by 15 to get the tablespoon equivalent. For example, 30 grams of plain yogurt equals 2 tbsp. Keep in mind this ratio works for runny plain yogurt—adjust for thicker styles as needed."
faqQ4: "Why do some air fryer recipes use yogurt instead of oil?"
faqA4: "Yogurt adds moisture without excess fat, creating a crispier exterior in air fryer cooking. A 3-tbsp (45g) portion provides enough acidity to tenderise proteins while promoting browning. It’s a healthier alternative that doesn’t sacrifice texture."

<p>3 tablespoons of plain yogurt weigh approximately 45 grams. This conversion is essential for precise cooking, especially when using an air fryer where measurements can make or break a recipe.

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on precise ingredient ratios to achieve even cooking and perfect textures. Too much or too little yogurt can affect moisture levels, browning, and overall taste.

<h3>How to Measure 3 Tbsp Plain Yogurt Without a Scale</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a kitchen scale, use standard measuring spoons for accuracy. Fill the tablespoon to the brim without packing it down, then level it off with a knife.

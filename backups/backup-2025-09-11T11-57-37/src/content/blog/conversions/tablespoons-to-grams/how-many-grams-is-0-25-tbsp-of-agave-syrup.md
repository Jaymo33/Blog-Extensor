faqQ1: "Can I use honey instead of 0.25 tbsp agave syrup in air fryer recipes?"
faqA1: "Yes, you can substitute honey for agave syrup in equal amounts (0.25 tbsp or 5g). However, honey is slightly thicker and sweeter, so you might want to reduce other liquids in the recipe slightly. In air fryer cooking, both work well for glazes and marinades."
faqQ2: "How do I measure 0.25 tbsp of agave syrup if I don't have measuring spoons?"
faqA2: "You can estimate 0.25 tbsp (5g) of agave syrup using a standard teaspoon. Since 1 tbsp equals 3 tsp, 0.25 tbsp is roughly ¾ tsp. Dip a clean teaspoon into the syrup and fill it three-quarters full for an approximate measurement."
faqQ3: "Does 0.25 tbsp of agave syrup affect cooking times in an air fryer?"
faqA3: "This small amount (5g) won't significantly change cooking times, but it can affect browning. Agave syrup caramelises faster than sugar, so watch items like glazed meats or desserts in the final minutes. Reduce temperature by 5°C if you notice excessive browning."
faqQ4: "Is 0.25 tbsp of agave syrup suitable for diabetic air fryer recipes?"
faqA4: "While 0.25 tbsp (5g) contains less sugar than a full tablespoon, agave syrup still impacts blood sugar. For diabetic-friendly alternatives in air fryer cooking, consider using stevia or erythritol. Always consult nutritional guidelines for specific dietary needs."

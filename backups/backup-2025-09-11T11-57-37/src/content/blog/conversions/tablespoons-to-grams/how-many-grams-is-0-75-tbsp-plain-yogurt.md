faqQ1: "Can I use Greek yogurt instead of plain yogurt for this measurement?"
faqA1: "Yes, but Greek yogurt is thicker, so 0.75 tbsp weighs slightly more—about 12-13 grams. You may need to adjust liquids in your air fryer recipe accordingly for the best texture."
faqQ2: "Why does my air fryer recipe specify yogurt in grams rather than tablespoons?"
faqA2: "Grams provide precise measurements, especially important in baking. Tablespoons can vary based on how you scoop the yogurt, but grams ensure consistency every time you use your air fryer."
faqQ3: "How do I measure 0.75 tbsp without a measuring spoon?"
faqA3: "Use a regular teaspoon: 0.75 tbsp equals 2.25 teaspoons. Alternatively, eyeball it by filling a tablespoon three-quarters full for approximate accuracy in your air fryer cooking."
faqQ4: "Does the fat content of yogurt affect the gram measurement?"
faqA4: "Full-fat, low-fat, and skim yogurts have similar weights per tablespoon (around 15g). However, richer yogurts may compact slightly more, so weighing with a scale is ideal for air fryer recipes."

faqQ1: "Can I use caster sugar instead of granulated sugar for 0.75 tbsp in grams?"
faqA1: "Yes, but caster sugar is slightly finer, so 0.75 tbsp weighs about 8.44 grams instead of 9.38 grams for granulated. Adjustments may be needed for delicate air fryer bakes where texture matters."
faqQ2: "Why does my air fryer recipe need exact sugar measurements?"
faqA2: "Air fryers cook faster than conventional ovens, so small measurement errors can lead to over-browning or uneven baking. Precise sugar amounts (like 0.75 tbsp = 9.38g) ensure consistent caramelisation and texture."
faqQ3: "How do I measure 0.75 tbsp of granulated sugar without a tablespoon?"
faqA3: "Use a teaspoon: 0.75 tbsp equals 2¼ tsp. Alternatively, fill a regular spoon halfway and add another quarter for accuracy. For best results, invest in digital scales for exact gram measurements."
faqQ4: "Does 0.75 tbsp of granulated sugar affect air fryer cooking times?"
faqA4: "Yes, sugar promotes browning, so recipes with 9.38g (0.75 tbsp) may cook slightly faster. Check dishes 1–2 minutes early to prevent over-caramelisation, especially for glazes or sugary toppings."

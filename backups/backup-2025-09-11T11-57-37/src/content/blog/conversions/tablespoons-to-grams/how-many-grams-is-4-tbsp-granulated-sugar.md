faqQ1: "Can I use 4 tbsp of granulated sugar in my air fryer for caramelising?"
faqA1: "Absolutely! 4 tbsp (50g) of granulated sugar works well for caramelising fruits or creating glazes in the air fryer. Spread the sugar evenly over the food to prevent clumping, and monitor closely as air fryers can vary in heat distribution."
faqQ2: "Does the brand of granulated sugar affect the 4 tbsp to grams conversion?"
faqA2: "Most UK granulated sugars have similar densities, so brand differences are minimal. However, always spoon and level your tablespoons for accuracy. If in doubt, weighing with scales eliminates any uncertainty."
faqQ3: "How does 4 tbsp of granulated sugar compare to sweeteners like honey in grams?"
faqA3: "Liquid sweeteners like honey weigh more per tablespoon (about 21g per tbsp). For 4 tbsp, you’d need roughly 84g of honey, but adjust recipes carefully as sweetness and moisture content differ significantly from granulated sugar."
faqQ4: "Why do some UK recipes list sugar in grams instead of tablespoons?"
faqA4: "Grams provide precision, especially in baking where ratios matter. Tablespoons can vary based on how the sugar is scooped. For air fryer recipes, weight measurements ensure even cooking and consistent results every time."

<p>4 tablespoons (tbsp) of granulated sugar equals approximately 50 grams in UK measurements. This conversion is essential for precise baking and cooking, especially when using an air fryer where ingredient accuracy can affect texture and browning. Whether you’re whipping up cakes, cookies, or even caramelising fruits, knowing how many grams 4 tbsp of granulated sugar weighs ensures consistent results.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate sugar measurements matter</h2>  
<p>Granulated sugar is a staple in many recipes, from air fryer desserts to savoury glazes. Using the correct weight ensures your dishes turn out perfectly every time. Too much sugar can lead to over-browning or excessive sweetness, while too little might leave your baked goods dry or lacking flavour. For air fryer recipes, where heat distribution is rapid, precise measurements like 4 tbsp of granulated sugar in grams help avoid uneven cooking.</p>  

<p>If you’re exploring <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a>, you’ll notice many rely on grams for consistency. Unlike volume measurements (like tablespoons), weight measurements eliminate variables like packing density or scooping technique. This is particularly useful for sugar, which can settle or clump over time.</p>  

<h3>How to measure 4 tbsp of granulated sugar accurately</h3>  
<p>To convert 4 tbsp of granulated sugar into grams, use a digital kitchen scale for the most reliable results. Spoon the sugar into the tablespoon without packing it down, then level it off with a straight edge. Repeat four times, and you’ll have roughly 50 grams. For larger batches, consider using a conversion chart like our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion guide</a> to streamline the process.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for 4 tbsp of granulated sugar</h2>  
<p>This measurement pops up frequently in both traditional and air fryer cooking. For example, 4 tbsp (50g) of granulated sugar is often used to sweeten muffin batters, dust churros, or balance the acidity in tomato-based sauces. In the air fryer, it’s perfect for creating crispy coatings on fruits like apples or peaches.</p>  

<p>If you’re preparing <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>air fryer cakes</a>, 4 tbsp of granulated sugar might be part of the batter or a sprinkle topping. Similarly, savoury dishes like glazed meats or roasted vegetables sometimes call for a touch of sugar to enhance caramelisation. Always double-check your recipe’s requirements, as some may list sugar by weight (grams) or volume (tablespoons).</p>  

<h3>Adjusting recipes for different sugar types</h3>  
<p>While this guide focuses on granulated sugar, other types like caster or brown sugar have different weights per tablespoon. For instance, 4 tbsp of brown sugar weighs slightly more due to its moisture content. If substituting, refer to a dedicated conversion tool or our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer measurement guide</a> for precise adjustments.</p>  

<h2>Tips for storing granulated sugar</h2>  
<p>To keep your sugar fresh and clump-free, store it in an airtight container in a cool, dry place. Humidity can cause granulated sugar to harden, making it tricky to measure accurately. If your sugar has solidified, break it up with a fork before scooping to ensure your 4 tbsp granulated sugar to grams conversion remains precise.</p>  

<p>For those who frequently bake or use their air fryer for sweets, consider pre-measuring batches of sugar in grams and labelling them. This saves time and guarantees consistency, especially when experimenting with new recipes from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>. A well-organised pantry is a baker’s best friend!</p>

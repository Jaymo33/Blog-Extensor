faqQ1: "Can I use 2.5 tbsp of sunflower oil for all air fryer recipes?"
faqA1: "While 2.5 tbsp (34g) of sunflower oil works for many recipes, some may require less or more. Lighter foods like vegetables often need just 1 tbsp, while denser items like chicken wings may use up to 3 tbsp. Always check your specific recipe for guidance."
faqQ2: "How does 2.5 tbsp of sunflower oil compare to spray oil in an air fryer?"
faqA2: "2.5 tbsp (34g) of sunflower oil equals about 5-6 seconds of continuous spraying with most oil sprayers. Spraying distributes oil more evenly, but measuring 2.5 tbsp ensures precise quantity control for consistent results."
faqQ3: "Is 2.5 tbsp of sunflower oil too much for air frying?"
faqA3: "For most recipes, 2.5 tbsp (34g) is a moderate amount that provides crispiness without excess grease. However, very small batches may only need 1 tbsp. The key is coating food lightly rather than drowning it in oil."
faqQ4: "How many calories are in 2.5 tbsp of sunflower oil?"
faqA4: "2.5 tbsp (34g) of sunflower oil contains about 300 calories, as oil is calorie-dense. When air frying, most excess oil drips off, making it a healthier option than deep frying while still achieving great texture."

<p>2.5 tablespoons (tbsp) of sunflower oil weighs approximately 34 grams (g). This conversion is essential for air fryer cooking, where precise measurements can make or break a recipe. Whether you’re whipping up crispy chips or a succulent roast, knowing the exact weight ensures perfect results every time.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate oil measurements matter in air fryers</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on hot air circulation to cook food, and too much oil can lead to soggy results. Measuring 2.5 tbsp of sunflower oil in grams (34g) helps maintain the right balance. For recipes like roasted vegetables or homemade crisps, this precision ensures a crispy texture without excess grease.

<p>Sunflower oil is a popular choice for air frying due to its high smoke point and neutral flavour. Whether you’re following a recipe from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> or experimenting with your own creations, accurate conversions like 2.5 tbsp to grams are crucial. Too little oil, and your food may dry out; too much, and it won’t crisp properly.</p>  

<h3>How to measure 2.5 tbsp of sunflower oil without scales</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a kitchen scale, use a standard UK tablespoon (15ml) to measure sunflower oil. Fill it to the brim twice, then half-fill a third spoon to reach 2.5 tbsp (37.5ml total).

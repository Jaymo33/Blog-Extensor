faqQ1: "Can I use regular yogurt instead of greek yogurt in air fryer recipes?"
faqA1: "Yes, you can substitute regular yogurt, but remember it has more liquid content. For 0.25 tbsp of greek yogurt (3.75g), you might need slightly less regular yogurt as it's less dense. Adjust other liquid ingredients accordingly to maintain the right consistency in your recipe."
faqQ2: "How do I measure 0.25 tbsp of greek yogurt without measuring spoons?"
faqA2: "If you don't have measuring spoons, use a standard teaspoon and fill it about one-quarter full. Alternatively, use a digital scale to measure out 3.75 grams. For visual reference, 0.25 tbsp is roughly the size of a large pea or two coffee beans."
faqQ3: "Does the fat content of greek yogurt affect its weight per tablespoon?"
faqA3: "The fat content doesn't significantly change the weight, but it can affect the density slightly. Full-fat greek yogurt might be marginally heavier than fat-free versions, but for most recipes, the 3.75g measurement for 0.25 tbsp remains accurate enough."
faqQ4: "Why would a recipe call for such a small amount as 0.25 tbsp of greek yogurt?"
faqA4: "Small amounts like 0.25 tbsp (3.75g) are often used in recipes where yogurt acts as an acidic component to activate baking soda, or when you need just enough moisture without altering the flavor profile. It's common in single-serving recipes or when making small batches in air fryers."

faqQ1: "Can I use tahini in air fryer desserts?"
faqA1: "Absolutely! Tahini adds a rich, nutty flavour to air fryer desserts like cookies or cakes. Just ensure you measure it accurately—0.75 tbsp (11.25 grams) is perfect for small batches. It pairs wonderfully with chocolate or honey in baked treats."
faqQ2: "Why does my tahini measurement seem off?"
faqA2: "Tahini’s thickness can vary, especially if it’s been sitting. Always stir it well before measuring to ensure consistency. If you scoop directly from the jar, you might pack too much, leading to inaccurate grams. Use a spoon to lightly fill your tablespoon for best results."
faqQ3: "How do I convert grams to tablespoons for tahini?"
faqA3: "To convert grams back to tablespoons, divide by 15 (since 1 tbsp = 15 grams). For example, 11.25 grams ÷ 15 = 0.75 tbsp. This is handy when adjusting recipes or using scales instead of measuring spoons."
faqQ4: "Can I substitute tahini in air fryer recipes?"
faqA4: "While tahini has a unique flavour, you can substitute it with almond or peanut butter in a pinch. Adjust the quantity slightly, as these alternatives may be thicker. For authentic results, though, stick to tahini and measure carefully—0.75 tbsp (11.25 grams) works perfectly."

faqQ1: "Is 0.25 tbsp of plain flour the same as 1.95 grams in all countries?"
faqA1: "No, tablespoon measurements vary slightly between countries. The 1.95 gram conversion applies specifically to UK tablespoons. US tablespoons are about 14.8ml compared to the UK's 15ml, so the weight would be marginally different. For air fryer recipes from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, always use UK measurements."
faqQ2: "Can I use this conversion for self-raising flour in my air fryer?"
faqA2: "Self-raising flour weighs slightly less than plain flour due to the added raising agents. For 0.25 tbsp, the difference is minimal (about 1.85g vs 1.95g), but for larger quantities in air fryer baking, it's best to use specific conversions for self-raising flour to ensure perfect results."
faqQ3: "How do I measure 0.25 tbsp of plain flour without special tools?"
faqA3: "You can use a standard teaspoon - 0.25 tbsp equals Â¾ teaspoon. Alternatively, fill a tablespoon halfway, then divide that portion in half again. For absolute precision in air fryer recipes, investing in digital scales that measure grams is recommended, especially for baking."
faqQ4: "Why does my air fryer recipe require such a small amount of flour?"
faqA4: "Many air fryer recipes use minimal flour to create light, crispy coatings without excess. 0.25 tbsp of plain flour is often enough to help breadcrumbs or seasonings adhere to food. The air fryer's circulating heat means you need less coating than traditional frying methods for excellent results."

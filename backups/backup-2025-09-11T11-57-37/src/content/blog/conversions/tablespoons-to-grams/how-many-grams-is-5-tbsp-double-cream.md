faqQ1: "Can I use single cream instead of double cream for 5 tbsp (75g)?"
faqA1: "Yes, but single cream has a lower fat content (18% vs. 48%), so the texture will be thinner. For cooking, it works in sauces or soups, but avoid whipping it. In air fryer recipes, you may need to reduce liquid elsewhere to compensate."
faqQ2: "How do I measure 5 tbsp of double cream without scales?"
faqA2: "Use a standard UK tablespoon (15ml) and level off the cream with a knife. Five level tablespoons equal roughly 75g. For accuracy, especially in air fryer baking, investing in cheap digital scales is worthwhile."
faqQ3: "Does 5 tbsp of double cream equal 75g in all brands?"
faqA3: "Most UK double creams are similar in density, but check the label for specific weight per ml. Premium brands may be slightly thicker, but the difference is minimal for home cooking."
faqQ4: "Can I freeze dishes made with 5 tbsp (75g) of double cream?"
faqA4: "Yes, but creamy sauces may separate when thawed. Reheat gently in the air fryer at 160°C, stirring occasionally. For best results, freeze before adding cream, then stir it in fresh after reheating."

<p>5 tablespoons (tbsp) of double cream equals approximately 75 grams (g). This conversion is essential for precise baking and cooking, especially when using an air fryer where measurements matter. Whether you're making a creamy sauce or a rich dessert, knowing the exact weight ensures perfect results every time.</p>  

<h2>Why converting tablespoons to grams matters</h2>  
<p>When cooking or baking, especially with air fryers, accuracy is key. Double cream’s density means volume measurements like tablespoons can vary slightly in weight. Converting 5 tbsp of double cream to grams (75g) ensures consistency, whether you're following a recipe from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> or improvising. This precision helps avoid overly rich or thin textures in dishes like custards or cakes.</p>  

<p>Many UK recipes, particularly those for air fryers, list ingredients by weight for reliability. If you're adapting a recipe from volume to grams, this conversion is a lifesaver.

<h3>How to measure double cream accurately</h3>  
<p>For the most precise 5 tbsp double cream to grams conversion, use a kitchen scale. Scoop the cream into a tablespoon, level it off, and weigh it. If you don’t have scales, remember that 1 tbsp of double cream is roughly 15g, so 5 tbsp equals 75g. This method works well for air fryer recipes like creamy pasta bakes or indulgent desserts.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for 5 tbsp of double cream</h2>  
<p>Double cream is a staple in British cooking, adding richness to both sweet and savoury dishes. In air fryer recipes, 75g (5 tbsp) of double cream can elevate mashed potatoes, thicken soups, or create luscious fillings for tarts. It’s also perfect for whipping into peaks for desserts like Eton mess or topping scones.</p>  

<p>If you’re exploring <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert recipes</a>, this measurement is handy for custards or no-bake cheesecakes. For savoury dishes, try adding it to a creamy mushroom sauce for chicken—just pop it in the air fryer for a quick, decadent meal.</p>  

<h3>Adjusting recipes with double cream</h3>  
<p>If a recipe calls for 5 tbsp of double cream but you’re watching calories, you can substitute half with Greek yogurt (37.5g) and half with cream. This keeps the texture while reducing fat. For vegan alternatives, coconut cream (75g) works well in most air fryer recipes, though the flavour will differ slightly.</p>  

<h2>Tips for storing double cream</h2>  
<p>Once opened, double cream lasts 3–4 days in the fridge. To avoid waste, measure out 5 tbsp (75g) portions and freeze them in airtight containers. Thaw in the fridge before use—though whipped cream won’t hold its shape after freezing, it’s fine for cooking.

faqQ1: "Can I use a regular spoon to measure 5 tbsp of sunflower oil?"

faqA2: "Different brands may refine sunflower oil to varying densities, affecting weight. However, the difference is minimal—around 1-2g per 5 tbsp. Always measure by weight for precision, especially in air fryer cooking."
faqQ3: "How do I convert grams back to tablespoons if needed?"

faqQ4: "Is sunflower oil the best choice for air frying?"
faqA4: "Sunflower oil is excellent for air frying due to its high smoke point and neutral taste. However, alternatives like rapeseed or avocado oil also work well. Choose based on flavour and heat tolerance."

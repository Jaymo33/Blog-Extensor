faqQ1: "Can I use single cream instead of double cream in air fryer recipes?"
faqA1: "Yes, you can substitute single cream, but keep in mind it has a lower fat content (around 18% compared to 48% in double cream). This may affect the richness and texture of your dish. For best results, adjust cooking times slightly as single cream may thin out sauces or batters more than double cream."
faqQ2: "How do I store leftover double cream after measuring 2.5 tbsp?"
faqA2: "Leftover double cream should be stored in an airtight container in the fridge and used within 2-3 days. To prevent spoilage, avoid returning unused cream to its original container. If you won’t use it soon, consider freezing it in small portions for future recipes."
faqQ3: "Why does my air fryer recipe call for grams instead of tablespoons?"
faqA3: "Grams provide a more accurate measurement than volume (like tablespoons), especially for dense ingredients like double cream. Air fryer recipes often require precision for even cooking, so weight measurements help ensure consistent results. Investing in a kitchen scale is highly recommended for air fryer cooking."
faqQ4: "Can I whip 2.5 tbsp of double cream in my air fryer?"
faqA4: "Whipping such a small amount of double cream (37.5g) isn’t practical in an air fryer. It’s better to whip it by hand or with a mixer. However, you can use air-fried desserts as a base for whipped cream toppings. Just ensure the cream is well-chilled before whipping for best results."

<p>2.5 tablespoons (tbsp) of double cream equals approximately 37.5 grams. This conversion is essential for precise cooking, especially when using an air fryer where measurements can affect texture and consistency. Whether you're making a rich dessert or a creamy sauce, knowing the exact weight ensures perfect results every time.</p>

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on precise ingredient ratios to achieve the best texture and flavour. Using too much or too little double cream can alter the outcome of your dish. For example, a <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>creamy pasta bake</a> might turn out too dry or overly rich if the cream measurement is off. Accurate conversions like 2.5 tbsp of double cream to grams help maintain consistency.</p>  
<p>Many <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion charts</a> include common ingredients, but double cream can be tricky due to its density. A kitchen scale is the most reliable tool, but if you don’t have one, this guide ensures you get it right. Whether you're preparing a <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>decadent dessert</a> or a savoury dish, precision is key.</p>

<h2>How to measure 2.5 tbsp of double cream without a scale</h2>  
<p>If you don’t have a scale, use a standard UK tablespoon (15ml) to measure your double cream. Fill it slightly over the rim for an accurate 2.5 tbsp measurement. Remember, double cream is denser than single cream, so volume-to-weight conversions are crucial. For reference, 1 tbsp of double cream weighs around 15 grams, making 2.5 tbsp roughly 37.5 grams.</p>  
<p>This method works well for recipes like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>air fryer cakes</a>, where even small measurement errors can affect rise and texture. If you’re unsure, err on the side of slightly less cream to avoid overly rich results.

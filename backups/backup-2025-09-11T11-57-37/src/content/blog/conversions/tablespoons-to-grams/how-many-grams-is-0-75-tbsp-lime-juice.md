faqQ1: "Can I use bottled lime juice instead of fresh for the 0.75 tbsp measurement?"
faqA1: "Yes, you can use bottled lime juice, and the 0.75 tbsp to grams conversion remains the same (about 11.25g). However, fresh lime juice typically has brighter flavour and better acidity. If using bottled, check for added preservatives or sweeteners that might affect your recipe’s taste."
faqQ2: "How does lime juice affect cooking times in an air fryer?"
faqA2: "Lime juice itself doesn’t significantly change cooking times, but marinades containing it might. The acidity can slightly tenderise proteins, potentially reducing cooking time by 1-2 minutes. Always check food early when using lime-based marinades, especially for delicate items like fish or shrimp."
faqQ3: "What’s the best way to measure 0.75 tbsp without measuring spoons?"
faqA3: "If you don’t have measuring spoons, use a standard teaspoon: 0.75 tbsp equals 2¼ teaspoons. Alternatively, estimate by filling a regular spoon about three-quarters full. For utmost accuracy, invest in cheap measuring spoons or use the 11.25g weight method with kitchen scales."
faqQ4: "Can I substitute lemon juice for lime juice in the same quantity?"
faqA4: "Yes, you can substitute lemon juice in the same 0.75 tbsp (11.25g) quantity, but expect a slightly different flavour profile. Lemon juice is brighter and less complex than lime, which might affect the final taste of your dish. The acidity levels are similar, so no recipe adjustments are needed."

<h2>Why accurate lime juice measurements matter</h2>
<p>When cooking with an air fryer, precision is key. Too much lime juice can overpower your dish, while too little might leave it lacking flavour. For example, if you’re making <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer lime chicken</a>, 0.75 tbsp of lime juice (11.25g) provides the perfect balance of acidity and zest.

The density of lime juice can vary slightly depending on temperature and freshness, which is why weighing gives superior results.</p>

faqQ1: "Can I use dairy milk instead of almond milk in air fryer recipes?"
faqA1: "Yes, you can substitute dairy milk for almond milk, but adjust the grams accordingly. Dairy milk is denser, so 0.75 tbsp weighs around 11.5 grams. The slight difference may affect texture, so reduce other liquids slightly if needed."
faqQ2: "Why is measuring almond milk in grams better than tablespoons?"
faqA2: "Grams provide precision since almond milk’s density varies by brand. Tablespoons measure volume, which can differ based on how you fill them. For air fryer recipes, weight ensures consistent results every time."
faqQ3: "How do I convert larger amounts of almond milk from tablespoons to grams?"
faqA3: "Multiply the number of tablespoons by 15 to get grams. For example, 2 tbsp of almond milk equals 30 grams. This scaling works for any quantity, making batch cooking easier."
faqQ4: "Does the type of almond milk (sweetened vs. unsweetened) affect the gram weight?"
faqA4: "Sweetened almond milk is slightly heavier due to added sugar, but the difference is minimal. For 0.75 tbsp, the gram weight remains close to 11.25 grams. Always check labels for exact nutritional info."

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air frying</h2>

<h3>Tips for storing and using almond milk</h3>
<p>Store almond milk in the fridge and shake well before measuring, as separation can occur. This ensures uniformity in your 0.75 tbsp (11.25g) measurements. For recipes requiring warmth, gently heat the almond milk to avoid curdling. Its lower fat content means it behaves differently than dairy milk in high heat. Always adjust air fryer temperatures slightly when using almond milk-based recipes.</p>

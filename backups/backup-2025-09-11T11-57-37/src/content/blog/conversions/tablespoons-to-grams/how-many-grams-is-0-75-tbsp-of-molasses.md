faqQ1: "Can I use black treacle instead of molasses in air fryer recipes?"
faqA1: "Yes, black treacle is a close substitute for molasses and can be used in the same 0.75 tbsp (15g) measurement. It has a slightly stronger, more bitter flavour, so adjust to taste. Both work well in air fryer glazes and baked goods."
faqQ2: "Why does my air fryer smoke when cooking with molasses?"
faqA2: "Molasses has a high sugar content, which can caramelise and smoke at high temperatures. To prevent this, apply glazes in the last few minutes of cooking. Also, ensure your air fryer is clean, as leftover residues can burn and cause smoke."
faqQ3: "How do I measure 0.75 tbsp of molasses without a measuring spoon?"
faqA3: "If you don’t have a tablespoon measure, use a teaspoon and scoop 2¼ teaspoons (since 1 tbsp = 3 tsp). For sticky ingredients like molasses, lightly oil the spoon to help it slide off cleanly. A digital scale is the most accurate option."
faqQ4: "Can I reduce the amount of molasses in an air fryer recipe?"
faqA4: "Yes, but keep in mind molasses adds moisture and flavour. Reducing it may affect texture and taste. If substituting, consider adding a bit of honey or maple syrup to balance sweetness. Always adjust other liquids slightly to maintain the right consistency."

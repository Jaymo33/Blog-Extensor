<p>1 tablespoon (tbsp) of condensed milk weighs approximately 19 grams. This measurement is essential for precise baking and cooking, especially when using an air fryer where ingredient ratios can affect texture and cooking times. Whether you're making desserts or glazes, knowing this conversion ensures consistent results every time.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on even heat distribution, so ingredient quantities must be precise. Too much or too little condensed milk can alter the moisture content of your dish, leading to uneven cooking.

Using 19 grams per tablespoon ensures your air fryer creations turn out perfectly every time.</p>  

<p>Condensed milk is thicker and denser than regular milk, which is why measuring by weight (grams) is more reliable than volume (tablespoons). If you're adapting a recipe from cups or tablespoons to grams, this conversion is a game-changer.

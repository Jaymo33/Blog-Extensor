faqQ1: "Is 1 tbsp of molasses the same as 20 grams in all recipes?"
faqA1: "In most cases, yes—1 tbsp of molasses weighs around 20 grams in UK measurements. However, factors like temperature (cold molasses is denser) or brand variations can cause slight differences. For baking in an air fryer, where precision matters, weighing is best."
faqQ2: "Can I use a regular spoon to measure 1 tbsp of molasses?"
faqA2: "While a standard tablespoon can work, it’s less accurate than a proper measuring spoon. Molasses’ sticky texture makes it easy to over- or under-measure. For reliable results, use a dedicated tbsp measure or a scale."
faqQ3: "How do I convert grams of molasses to cups for larger recipes?"
faqA3: "One cup of molasses weighs roughly 340 grams (about 17 tbsp). If scaling up an air fryer recipe, use weight for consistency. Our conversion chart simplifies these calculations for popular ingredients."
faqQ4: "Does blackstrap molasses weigh the same as regular molasses?"
faqA4: "Blackstrap molasses is slightly denser due to reduced sugar content, but the difference is minimal—about 21 grams per tbsp. For most air fryer recipes, you can use the standard 20-gram measure without issue."

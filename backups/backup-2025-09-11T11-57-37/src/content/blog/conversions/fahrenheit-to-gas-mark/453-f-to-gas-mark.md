Start checking your food a few minutes earlier than the recipe suggests to avoid overcooking.

<p>Always use a meat thermometer to check internal temperatures when cooking at 453 F (Gas Mark 8). This ensures meats are cooked safely without drying out. For poultry, aim for an internal temperature of 75 C, while beef and lamb should reach at least 63 C for medium-rare. Let meats rest for a few minutes after cooking to allow juices to redistribute. This step is crucial for achieving tender, flavourful results every time.</p>

<h3>Tips for Baking at 453 F (Gas Mark 8)</h3>
<p>When baking at 453 F (Gas Mark 8), use light-coloured baking trays to prevent over-browning. Dark trays absorb more heat and can cause the bottom of your baked goods to burn. If your air fryer has a baking setting, use it to ensure even heat distribution. For best results, rotate trays halfway through cooking to promote uniform browning. This is especially important for items like cookies or scones.</p>

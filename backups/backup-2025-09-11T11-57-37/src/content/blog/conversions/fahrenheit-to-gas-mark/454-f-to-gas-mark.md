<p>454 degrees Fahrenheit converts to Gas Mark 8 in UK ovens and air fryers. This high temperature is perfect for baking, roasting meats, or creating crispy textures in your air fryer. Many British recipes use Gas Mark rather than Fahrenheit, making this conversion essential for home cooks.</p>

<h2>Understanding 454 F to Gas Mark Conversion</h2>
<p>The Gas Mark scale is uniquely British, ranging from 1/4 to 9 for most domestic ovens. When converting 454 F to Gas Mark, you'll need to know that each Gas Mark represents about 25-30°C (45-54°F).

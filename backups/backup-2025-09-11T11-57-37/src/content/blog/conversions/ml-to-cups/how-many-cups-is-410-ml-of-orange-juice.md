faqQ1: "Is 410 ml of orange juice the same as 1.73 cups in the US and UK?"
faqA1: "Yes, 410 ml of orange juice is approximately 1.73 cups in both the US and UK. The slight difference between US (240 ml per cup) and UK (250 ml per cup) standards doesn't significantly affect this conversion. For most recipes, the measurement works interchangeably."

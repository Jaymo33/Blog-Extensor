faqQ1: "Is 685 ml of beef stock the same as 3 cups?"
faqA1: "No, 685 ml of beef stock is approximately 2.9 cups, not 3 cups. While the difference might seem small, it can affect recipes, especially in air fryer cooking where liquid evaporation is faster. For precision, stick to 2.9 cups or use a kitchen scale."
faqQ2: "Can I use chicken stock instead of beef stock in the same measurement?"
faqA2: "Yes, you can substitute chicken stock for beef stock in the same measurement (685 ml or 2.9 cups). However, the flavour profile will change, so adjust seasonings accordingly. This swap works well in most air fryer recipes."
faqQ3: "How do I measure 685 ml of beef stock if I only have a 1-cup measure?"
faqA3: "If you have a 1-cup measure, use it twice for 2 cups (500 ml), then add another 185 ml (just under ¾ cup) to reach 685 ml. Alternatively, weigh it—685 ml of beef stock weighs roughly 685 grams."
faqQ4: "Why do air fryer recipes sometimes specify ml instead of cups?"
faqA4: "Many air fryer recipes use millilitres (ml) for precision, as cups can vary by region. Metric measurements ensure consistency, especially important for liquids like beef stock in air fryer cooking. Always double-check conversions for best results."

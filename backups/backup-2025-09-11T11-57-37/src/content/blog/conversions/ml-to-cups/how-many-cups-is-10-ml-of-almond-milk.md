faqQ1: "Can I use dairy milk instead of almond milk for 10 ml measurements?"
faqA1: "Yes, you can substitute dairy milk for almond milk in the same quantity (10 ml). However, keep in mind that dairy milk is creamier, which might slightly alter the texture of your dish. For air fryer recipes, almond milk’s lighter consistency often works better for crispiness."
faqQ2: "How do I measure 10 ml of almond milk without a measuring spoon?"
faqA2: "If you don’t have a measuring spoon, use a standard teaspoon (5 ml) twice for 10 ml. Alternatively, a tablespoon holds about 15 ml, so fill it just under two-thirds full. For the most accuracy, a small liquid measuring cup with millilitre markings is ideal."
faqQ3: "Why do some recipes use 10 ml of almond milk instead of larger amounts?"
faqA3: "Recipes call for small amounts like 10 ml of almond milk to add moisture without making the dish too wet. In air fryer cooking, excess liquid can lead to steaming instead of crisping, so precise measurements help maintain the right texture."
faqQ4: "Does 10 ml of almond milk change weight in different brands?"
faqA4: "The weight of 10 ml of almond milk stays roughly the same across brands, but thickness may vary slightly. Always stir almond milk before measuring to ensure consistency, especially for baking or air fryer recipes where precision matters."

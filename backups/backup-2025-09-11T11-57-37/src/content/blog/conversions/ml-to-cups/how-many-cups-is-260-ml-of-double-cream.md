faqQ1: "Can I use single cream instead of double cream in a recipe calling for 260 ml?"
faqA1: "Yes, you can substitute single cream for double cream, but the texture and richness will differ. Double cream has a higher fat content, so your dish may be less creamy. Adjust cooking times slightly if using an air fryer, as single cream may behave differently under heat."
faqQ2: "How do I measure 260 ml of double cream without a measuring jug?"
faqA2: "If you don't have a measuring jug, you can use a standard tablespoon. There are roughly 15 ml in a tablespoon, so 260 ml would be about 17 tablespoons. Alternatively, use a kitchen scaleâ€”260 ml of double cream weighs approximately 260 grams."
faqQ3: "Why does my air fryer recipe call for 260 ml of double cream specifically?"
faqA3: "Recipes often specify 260 ml of double cream to ensure the right consistency and flavour balance. In air fryer cooking, precise amounts help achieve even cooking and perfect texture. Straying too far from the measurement could affect the dish's outcome."
faqQ4: "Is 260 ml of double cream the same in the UK and US?"
faqA4: "Yes, 260 ml of double cream is the same measurement in both the UK and US. However, cup sizes can vary slightly between countries, so it's best to stick to millilitres for accuracy. Always double-check conversions if using a recipe from another country."

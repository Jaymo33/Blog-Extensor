faqQ1: "Is 110 ml of evaporated milk the same as fresh milk in cups?"
faqA1: "No, evaporated milk is thicker and more concentrated due to reduced water content. While 110 ml equals roughly 0.46 cups for both, evaporated milk’s density means it weighs more per cup. Adjust recipes accordingly for texture."
faqQ2: "Can I use a tablespoon to measure 110 ml of evaporated milk?"
faqA2: "Yes, but it’s less precise. Since 1 tablespoon is about 15 ml, you’d need roughly 7.3 tablespoons for 110 ml (just over 7 tablespoons). For accuracy, a measuring cup or scale is best, especially in baking."
faqQ3: "Does the brand of evaporated milk affect the 110 ml to cups conversion?"
faqA3: "No, the volume remains the same (0.46 cups per 110 ml) regardless of brand. However, some brands may vary slightly in thickness, so stir well before measuring for consistency."
faqQ4: "How do I store leftover evaporated milk after measuring 110 ml?"
faqA4: "Transfer leftovers to an airtight container and refrigerate for up to 5 days. For longer storage, freeze in ice cube trays (1 cube ≈ 30 ml), then thaw as needed. Avoid refreezing once thawed."

faqQ1: "Can I use olive oil instead of vegetable oil for 860 ml in air fryer recipes?"
faqA1: "Yes, you can substitute olive oil for vegetable oil in the same quantity (860 ml or 3.63 cups). However, olive oil has a lower smoke point, so it’s best for low to medium-heat cooking. For high-heat air frying, vegetable oil is more stable and less likely to burn."
faqQ2: "How do I measure 860 ml of vegetable oil if I don’t have a measuring jug?"
faqA2: "You can use a kitchen scale: 860 ml of vegetable oil weighs about 790 grams. Alternatively, a standard UK mug holds roughly 284 ml, so three mugs will give you approximately 852 ml—close enough for most recipes. For precision, invest in a measuring jug for future cooking."
faqQ3: "Is 860 ml of vegetable oil too much for an air fryer?"
faqA3: "860 ml of vegetable oil (3.63 cups) is suitable for large batches or recipes requiring generous oil coverage. However, air fryers typically need less oil than traditional frying. Adjust the quantity based on your recipe—some dishes may only need a light coating for crispiness."
faqQ4: "How do I clean my air fryer after using 860 ml of vegetable oil?"
faqA4: "After using 860 ml of vegetable oil, wipe the air fryer basket and tray with warm, soapy water. For stubborn residue, use a non-abrasive sponge or our recommended <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning products</a>.

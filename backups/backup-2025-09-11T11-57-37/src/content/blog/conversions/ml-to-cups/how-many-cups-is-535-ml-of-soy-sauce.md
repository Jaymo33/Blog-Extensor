faqQ1: "Is 535 ml of soy sauce the same in UK and US cups?"
faqA1: "While the difference is minimal, UK cups are slightly larger (284 ml) compared to US cups (240 ml). For 535 ml of soy sauce, this translates to roughly 1.88 UK cups or 2.26 US cups. Always check your recipe's origin to ensure accuracy."
faqQ2: "Can I use a tablespoon to measure 535 ml of soy sauce?"

faqQ3: "Does the type of soy sauce affect the conversion?"
faqA3: "Light and dark soy sauce have similar densities, so the conversion remains roughly the same. However, thicker varieties like tamari may vary slightly. Always check the label if precision is critical for your recipe."
faqQ4: "How long does 535 ml of soy sauce last once opened?"
faqA4: "An opened bottle of soy sauce lasts about 2-3 years if stored properly. Keep it sealed and refrigerated to preserve its flavour. For best results, use it within a year for optimal taste in your air fryer dishes."

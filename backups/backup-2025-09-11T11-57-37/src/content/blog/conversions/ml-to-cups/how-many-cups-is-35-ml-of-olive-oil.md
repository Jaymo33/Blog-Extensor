faqQ1: "Is 35 ml of olive oil the same in the UK and USA?"
faqA1: "Yes, 35 ml of olive oil is the same volume in both the UK and USA. However, cup sizes differ slightly—the UK uses the metric cup (250 ml), while the US uses a customary cup (240 ml). For 35 ml, the difference is negligible (approx. 0.148 cups in both)."
faqQ2: "Can I use a kitchen scale to measure 35 ml of olive oil?"
faqA2: "While scales measure weight, not volume, you can approximate 35 ml of olive oil by weight. Olive oil weighs about 0.92 grams per ml, so 35 ml would be roughly 32 grams. However, for precision, a liquid measuring cup is best."
faqQ3: "How does 35 ml of olive oil affect air fryer cooking times?"
faqA3: "Using 35 ml of olive oil in the air fryer helps food crisp up faster due to better heat transfer. However, too much oil can cause smoke, so stick to this measured amount for optimal results without altering cooking times drastically."
faqQ4: "What’s the best way to clean my air fryer after using olive oil?"
faqA4: "After cooking with olive oil, wipe the air fryer basket with warm, soapy water or use a non-abrasive sponge. For stubborn residue, check out <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>our cleaning guide</a> for detailed tips. Regular maintenance prevents oil buildup."

<p>35 ml of olive oil is approximately 0.148 cups (or just under 1/7 of a cup). This conversion is essential for precise cooking and baking, especially when using an air fryer where exact measurements can impact texture and crispiness. Whether you're whipping up a quick snack or a full meal, knowing how to convert millilitres to cups ensures your dishes turn out perfectly every time.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Olive Oil Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of olive oil in your air fryer recipes can make all the difference. Too little, and your food might stick or dry out; too much, and it could become greasy. For example, when making crispy potatoes or roasting vegetables, 35 ml of olive oil (or 0.148 cups) provides just enough coating without excess oil pooling at the bottom of the basket. If you're unsure about other conversions, <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>our air fryer conversion chart</a> is a handy reference.</p>  

<p>Many air fryer recipes, like those for chicken or tofu, call for precise oil measurements to achieve the ideal balance of crispiness and tenderness.

<h3>How to Measure 35 ml of Olive Oil Without a Scale</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a measuring jug with millilitre markings, you can use standard kitchen tools to measure 35 ml of olive oil. A tablespoon holds about 15 ml, so 2 tablespoons plus 1 teaspoon will give you roughly 35 ml. Alternatively, a US liquid measuring cup marked in cups can help—just fill it to just under 1/7 of a cup for the same amount.</p>  

<h2>Converting 35 ml of Olive Oil for Different Recipes</h2>  
<p>Whether you're baking or frying, 35 ml of olive oil (0.148 cups) works well in various dishes. For air-fried desserts like cakes or cookies, this amount ensures moisture without making the batter too dense. If you're preparing a savoury dish, such as roasted vegetables from our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable recipes</a>, this measurement helps achieve even crispiness.</p>

<h3>Common Mistakes When Measuring Olive Oil</h3>  
<p>One mistake people make is eyeballing olive oil, which can lead to inconsistent results. For accuracy, always use proper measuring tools. Another error is confusing weight and volume—35 ml of olive oil is a volume measurement, not weight. Stick to liquid measuring cups or spoons for best results.</p>  

<h2>Using 35 ml of Olive Oil in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>In air fryer cooking, 35 ml of olive oil is ideal for coating proteins like chicken or tofu before seasoning. It’s also perfect for tossing vegetables before roasting, ensuring they crisp up nicely.

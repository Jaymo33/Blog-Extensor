faqQ1: "Is 385 ml of beef stock the same as 1.63 cups in the UK and US?"
faqA1: "Yes, 385 ml of beef stock equals approximately 1.63 cups in both the UK and US. While cup sizes can vary slightly (the UK uses 250 ml per cup, and the US uses 236.59 ml), the difference is minimal for most recipes. For precise air fryer cooking, stick to millilitres or grams if possible."
faqQ2: "Can I use a kitchen scale to measure 385 ml of beef stock?"
faqA2: "Absolutely! Since beef stock has a density close to water, 385 ml weighs roughly 385 grams. Using a kitchen scale is often more accurate than measuring cups, especially for thicker or reduced stocks. This method ensures consistency in your air fryer recipes."
faqQ3: "What happens if I use too much beef stock in my air fryer?"
faqA3: "Excess beef stock can make food soggy or cause splattering in the air fryer basket. The high-speed air circulation evaporates liquids quickly, but too much liquid can lead to uneven cooking. Stick to 385 ml (1.63 cups) unless the recipe specifies otherwise."
faqQ4: "How do I adjust cooking time when using 385 ml of beef stock in an air fryer?"
faqA4: "Recipes with 385 ml of beef stock may need slightly longer cooking times to reduce the liquid and concentrate flavours. Start with the recommended time, then check every few minutes. For braised dishes, covering with foil can help retain moisture without overcooking."

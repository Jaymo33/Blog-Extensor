faqQ1: "Is 85 ml of coconut milk the same as 0.36 cups in all countries?"
faqA1: "Yes, 85 ml of coconut milk equals roughly 0.36 cups universally, but cup sizes can vary slightly by region. In the UK and US, a standard cup is 240 ml, making the conversion consistent for air fryer recipes."
faqQ2: "Can I use light coconut milk instead of full-fat for 85 ml measurements?"
faqA2: "Yes, light coconut milk works for the same 85 ml (0.36 cups) measurement, but it’s less creamy. Adjust cooking times in your air fryer, as lighter milk may reduce browning or crispiness."
faqQ3: "How do I store leftover coconut milk after measuring 85 ml?"
faqA3: "Transfer leftover coconut milk to an airtight container and refrigerate for up to 3 days. Shake well before reusing. For longer storage, freeze in 85 ml portions for future air fryer recipes."
faqQ4: "Why does my 85 ml of coconut milk look thicker or thinner than expected?"
faqA4: "Coconut milk separates naturally—the cream rises to the top. Stir thoroughly before measuring 85 ml (0.36 cups) for consistent results. Thickness varies by brand, so adjust air fryer cooking times accordingly."

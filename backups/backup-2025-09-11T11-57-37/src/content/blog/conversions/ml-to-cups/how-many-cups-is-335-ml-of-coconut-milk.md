faqQ1: "Can I use light coconut milk instead of full-fat for 335 ml measurements?"
faqA1: "Light coconut milk has more water, so 335 ml won’t provide the same richness as full-fat. If substituting, reduce other liquids in the recipe slightly. For air fryer cooking, full-fat works best for texture and flavour."
faqQ2: "How do I measure 335 ml of coconut milk if I only have a US cup set?"
faqA2: "A US cup is 240 ml, so 335 ml equals about 1 and 1/3 cups plus 2 teaspoons. For precision, use a liquid measuring jug or our conversion chart at <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>."
faqQ3: "Does 335 ml of coconut milk weigh the same as water?"
faqA3: "No, coconut milk is denser due to its fat content. While 335 ml of water weighs 335 grams, coconut milk weighs roughly 315–325 grams. Always measure by volume for recipes unless specified otherwise."
faqQ4: "Can I freeze leftover 335 ml portions of coconut milk?"
faqA4: "Yes! Freeze 335 ml (1.42 cups) in an airtight container for up to 3 months. Thaw in the fridge before use. Stir well, as separation may occur. Perfect for future air fryer recipes."

<p>335 ml of coconut milk equals approximately 1.42 cups. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes, where precision ensures perfect textures and flavours. Whether you're making curries, desserts, or marinades, knowing how to measure coconut milk accurately can make all the difference. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we help you nail every recipe with precise conversions and expert tips.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of coconut milk ensures your dishes aren’t too dry or overly saturated. Air fryers rely on even heat distribution, and incorrect measurements can throw off cooking times. For example, too much liquid might lead to steaming instead of crisping. Too little, and your dish could end up dry. That’s why converting 335 ml of coconut milk to cups (1.42 cups) is so important for consistency.</p>  

<p>If you’re working with recipes from different regions, you’ll often find measurements in millilitres or cups. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> simplifies this, so you never have to guess. Whether you’re making a Thai curry or a coconut-based dessert, precise measurements guarantee success.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure 335 ml of Coconut Milk Without a Scale</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a measuring jug, you can use standard cups to measure 335 ml of coconut milk. A UK metric cup holds 250 ml, so 335 ml is roughly 1 and 1/3 cups plus a tablespoon. For US cups (240 ml), it’s about 1.42 cups. Shake the coconut milk well before measuring, as it separates in the can. Stirring ensures an even consistency for accurate results.</p>  

<h2>Best Air Fryer Recipes Using 335 ml of Coconut Milk</h2>  
<p>Coconut milk adds richness to both savoury and sweet air fryer dishes. Try it in a creamy <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken curry</a>, where 335 ml (1.42 cups) creates the perfect sauce consistency. For desserts, coconut milk works wonders in air-fried banana fritters or dairy-free puddings. The key is balancing moisture—too much can make batters soggy, while too little dries them out.</p>  

<p>Another great option is marinating proteins like shrimp or tofu in coconut milk before air frying. The milk tenderises while adding subtle sweetness. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a> for more inspiration. Each recipe includes precise measurements, so you’ll never have to second-guess conversions.</p>  

<h3>Does Coconut Milk Brand Affect Measurement Accuracy?</h3>  
<p>Most canned coconut milk brands have similar densities, so 335 ml should convert reliably to 1.42 cups. However, lighter "coconut beverage" drinks differ—they’re more diluted, so stick to full-fat canned milk for cooking. Always check labels if substituting, as thickness varies. For best results, use our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion guide</a> to adjust recipes accordingly.</p>  

<h2>Common Mistakes When Measuring Coconut Milk</h2>  
<p>One mistake is not shaking the can first, leading to uneven fat distribution. Another is eyeballing—always use proper measuring tools for 335 ml (1.42 cups) accuracy. Pouring straight from the can can also cause spills, wasting precious liquid. Instead, transfer to a jug for cleaner measuring. And remember, air fryer recipes need precision—guesswork can ruin textures.</p>  

<p>Storing leftover coconut milk? Freeze it in ice cube trays for future use. Each cube is about 30 ml, so 11 cubes roughly equal 335 ml. This hack saves time and reduces waste. For more storage tips, visit <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>.</p>  

<h3>Converting Other Coconut Milk Amounts for Air Frying</h3>  
<p>Need to adjust a recipe? Here’s a quick reference: 250 ml = 1 cup (UK), 240 ml = 1 cup (US). For half batches, 167.5 ml is about 0.71 cups. Doubling? 670 ml equals roughly 2.84 cups.

faqQ1: "Is 935 ml of corn syrup the same in UK and US cups?"
faqA1: "Yes, 935 ml of corn syrup equals approximately 3.95 cups in both UK and US measurements. While UK and US cups are slightly different (1 UK cup = 284 ml, 1 US cup = 237 ml), the difference is negligible for most recipes. For air fryer cooking, this minor variance won’t affect your results."
faqQ2: "Can I use a kitchen scale instead of measuring cups for 935 ml of corn syrup?"
faqA2: "Absolutely! Weighing corn syrup is often more accurate. Since corn syrup weighs about 1.42 grams per ml, 935 ml would be roughly 1,327 grams. This method eliminates sticky measuring cups and ensures precision, especially for air fryer recipes where consistency matters."
faqQ3: "What if I don’t have corn syrup? Can I substitute it in a recipe calling for 935 ml?"
faqA3: "You can substitute honey, maple syrup, or golden syrup in a 1:1 ratio, but keep in mind the flavour will differ. For air fryer recipes, these substitutes may also affect browning and texture. Adjust cooking times slightly if needed."
faqQ4: "How do I clean my air fryer after using 935 ml of corn syrup in a recipe?"
faqA4: "Sticky residues from corn syrup can be tough to clean. Use warm, soapy water and a soft sponge to wipe down the basket. For stubborn spots, a mix of baking soda and water works well. Always unplug your air fryer first and avoid abrasive cleaners."

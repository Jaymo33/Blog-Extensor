faqQ1: "Is 160 ml of lime juice the same as 160 grams?"
faqA1: "No, 160 ml of lime juice is not the same as 160 grams. The weight depends on density—lime juice is roughly 1.04 grams per ml, so 160 ml equals about 166 grams. For precise baking, use a kitchen scale."
faqQ2: "Can I use bottled lime juice instead of fresh for 160 ml?"
faqA2: "Yes, but bottled lime juice often has preservatives and a slightly different flavour. Fresh lime juice (160 ml or 0.68 cups) is brighter and more aromatic. If substituting, adjust sugar or salt in the recipe to balance taste."
faqQ3: "How do I measure 160 ml of lime juice without a measuring cup?"
faqA3: "Use a standard tablespoon (15 ml)—160 ml is about 10.5 tablespoons. Alternatively, a US liquid measuring cup marked in ml works best. For air fryer recipes, accuracy ensures even cooking."
faqQ4: "Does 160 ml of lime juice change when heated in an air fryer?"
faqA4: "Yes, heating reduces lime juice’s volume due to evaporation. If a recipe calls for 160 ml (0.68 cups) post-cooking, you may need to start with slightly more. Stir sauces mid-cook to prevent over-thickening."

<h2>Why Accurate Lime Juice Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of lime juice can make or break a dish. Too little, and your recipe might lack tang; too much, and it could become overpowering.

Lime juice is a common ingredient in marinades, sauces, and even desserts, so getting the measurement right ensures balanced flavours.

<p>Air fryers excel at locking in moisture, but incorrect measurements can still lead to dry or soggy results. If a recipe calls for 160 ml of lime juice, using the correct cup equivalent (0.68 cups) ensures the dish cooks evenly. This is particularly important for citrus-based glazes or dressings, where consistency affects the final product.

<h2>Using Lime Juice in Air Fryer Recipes</h2>  
<p>Lime juice adds brightness to air fryer dishes, from crispy chicken wings to zesty vegetables. When a recipe specifies 160 ml of lime juice, measuring accurately ensures the marinade or glaze isn’t too acidic or weak. For example, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/shrimp>shrimp recipes</a> often use lime juice for a fresh, tangy finish. Since air fryers circulate hot air, liquids reduce faster—so precise measurements prevent over-reduction.</p>  

<p>If you’re adapting a conventional recipe for the air fryer, remember that 160 ml of lime juice (0.68 cups) might need slight adjustments. Air fryers cook faster, so glazes or sauces with lime juice may thicken quicker than expected. For best results, start with the exact conversion and adjust to taste. Don’t forget to clean your air fryer after citrus-heavy recipes—our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning guide</a> has handy tips.</p>

faqQ1: "Is 885 ml of almond milk the same as 885 ml of regular milk in recipes?"
faqA1: "While the volume is identical, almond milk has a thinner consistency and slightly sweeter taste than cow’s milk. This can affect texture in baked goods or sauces. For air fryer recipes, you may need to adjust thickening agents like flour or cornstarch when substituting."
faqQ2: "Can I use a kitchen scale to measure 885 ml of almond milk?"
faqA2: "Yes, but since almond milk’s density is close to water, 885 ml weighs roughly 885 grams. Use a liquid measuring cup for simplicity, as scales are better for dry ingredients. For air fryer recipes, volume measurements are often more practical."
faqQ3: "How do I store leftover almond milk after measuring 885 ml?"
faqA3: "Transfer unused almond milk to an airtight container and refrigerate for up to 5 days. Shake well before reuse, as separation is normal. For air fryer cooking, fresh almond milk ensures the best flavour in batters or marinades."
faqQ4: "Why do UK and US cup measurements differ for 885 ml of almond milk?"
faqA4: "The US uses a 240 ml cup, while the UK uses 250 ml, a legacy of imperial vs. metric systems. Always check your recipe’s origin—especially for air fryer dishes where precision impacts cooking time and texture."

faqQ1: "Is 785 ml of chicken broth the same in UK and US cups?"
faqA1: "Yes, 785 ml of chicken broth equals about 3.3 cups in both UK and US measurements. While the imperial cup is technically 284 ml, most modern recipes use the 240 ml metric cup standard. For air fryer cooking, this small difference won't significantly impact most dishes."
faqQ2: "Can I use a mug to measure 785 ml of chicken broth?"
faqA2: "We don't recommend using a mug as sizes vary widely. A standard UK mug holds about 300 ml, so you'd need roughly 2.6 mugs for 785 ml. For accurate results, use proper measuring cups or convert 785 ml to grams (785g) using kitchen scales."
faqQ3: "How does 785 ml of chicken broth affect air fryer cooking times?"
faqA3: "The amount of liquid slightly affects cooking times. With 785 ml (3.3 cups) of broth, dishes may need 2-3 minutes longer than drier recipes. Always check food doneness with a thermometer when cooking with liquids in your air fryer."
faqQ4: "Where can I find recipes using 785 ml of chicken broth?"
faqA4: "Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a> features many dishes using similar broth quantities. Look for soups, braises, and grain dishes in the 750-800 ml range. The exact amount can often be adjusted up or down by 50 ml without issues."

<h2>Understanding the Conversion from ml to Cups</h2>
<p>Converting 785 ml of chicken broth to cups is straightforward once you know the basics. One standard cup holds about 240 ml, so dividing 785 by 240 gives you roughly 3.3 cups.

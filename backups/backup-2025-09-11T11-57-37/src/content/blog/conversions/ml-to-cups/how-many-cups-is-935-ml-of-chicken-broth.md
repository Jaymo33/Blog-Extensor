faqQ1: "Is 935 ml of chicken broth the same as 4 cups?"
faqA1: "935 ml of chicken broth is approximately 3.95 cups, which is very close to 4 cups. For most recipes, this small difference won’t matter, but for precise baking or reductions, it’s best to measure accurately."
faqQ2: "Can I use a standard measuring cup for 935 ml of chicken broth?"
faqA2: "Yes, a standard 250 ml measuring cup works perfectly. Simply measure out 3 full cups (750 ml) and then add an additional 185 ml (just under ¾ cup) to reach 935 ml."
faqQ3: "Does the type of chicken broth affect the measurement?"
faqA3: "No, whether you use homemade, store-bought, or low-sodium chicken broth, the volume remains the same. However, thicker broths may settle, so stir well before measuring."
faqQ4: "How do I adjust a recipe if I only have 935 ml of chicken broth but need 4 cups?"
faqA4: "Since 935 ml is just shy of 4 cups, you can top it up with 5 ml (1 teaspoon) of water or stock if precision is crucial. Alternatively, slightly reduce other liquids in the recipe."

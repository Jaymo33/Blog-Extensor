faqQ1: "Is 860 ml of milk the same as 3.63 cups in all countries?"
faqA1: "No, cup measurements vary slightly by region. In the US, 860 ml equals roughly 3.63 cups (240 ml per cup), while in the UK, it's closer to 3.44 cups (250 ml per cup). Most recipes account for this small difference, so 3.63 cups works universally."
faqQ2: "Can I use a dry measuring cup for 860 ml of milk?"
faqA2: "It's best to use a liquid measuring cup for accuracy. Dry cups can lead to slight variations, which might affect recipes, especially in air fryer cooking where precision matters. Always measure liquids at eye level for consistency."
faqQ3: "How does 860 ml of milk affect air fryer cooking times?"
faqA3: "Milk-based recipes, like batters or custards, may require adjusted cooking times in an air fryer. Since 860 ml is a substantial amount, ensure even distribution and check for doneness earlier than usual. Preheating the air fryer helps too."
faqQ4: "What if I only have a 1-cup measure for 860 ml of milk?"
faqA4: "Simply measure out 3 full cups (720 ml) first, then add another 140 ml (about 0.63 cups) to reach 860 ml. A tablespoon holds roughly 15 ml, so 9 tablespoons plus 1 teaspoon will get you close. For precise conversions, refer to our air fryer conversion chart."

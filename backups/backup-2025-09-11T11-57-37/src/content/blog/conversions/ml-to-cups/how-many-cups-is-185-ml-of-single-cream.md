faqQ1: "Is 185 ml of single cream the same as 185 grams?"
faqA1: "Yes, 185 ml of single cream is approximately 185 grams, as the density of single cream is close to 1 gram per millilitre. However, slight variations can occur depending on the brand or fat content. For precise baking, weighing is often more accurate than measuring by volume."
faqQ2: "Can I use double cream instead of single cream in a 185 ml measurement?"
faqA2: "You can substitute double cream, but note that it has a higher fat content, which may affect the texture of your dish. If using double cream, you might want to slightly reduce the quantity or adjust other liquid ingredients to balance the richness."
faqQ3: "How do I measure 185 ml of single cream without a measuring cup?"
faqA3: "If you don't have a measuring cup, use a kitchen scale—185 ml of single cream weighs about 185 grams. Alternatively, a standard tablespoon holds about 15 ml, so 12 tablespoons plus 1 teaspoon would give you roughly 185 ml."
faqQ4: "Does the conversion change for UK and US cups?"
faqA4: "Yes, UK cups are slightly larger (284 ml) compared to US cups (240 ml). For 185 ml of single cream, it's about 0.65 UK cups or 0.78 US cups. Always check which cup measurement your recipe uses to avoid errors."

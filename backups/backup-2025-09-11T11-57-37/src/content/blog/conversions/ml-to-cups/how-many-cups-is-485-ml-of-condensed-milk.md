faqQ1: "Is 485 ml of condensed milk the same as 2 cups?"
faqA1: "Yes, 485 ml of condensed milk is approximately equal to 2 standard US cups. This conversion works for most recipes, though UK cups are slightly different at about 1.7 cups for the same amount. Always check your specific measuring cups for accuracy."
faqQ2: "How do I measure sticky condensed milk without making a mess?"
faqA2: "Lightly grease your measuring cup with oil or cooking spray before adding condensed milk. This helps it slide out more easily. You can also warm the can slightly in warm water to make the milk less viscous and easier to pour and measure accurately."
faqQ3: "Can I use evaporated milk instead of condensed milk in recipes?"
faqA3: "Evaporated milk isn't a direct substitute as it lacks the sugar content of condensed milk. If substituting, you'll need to add sugar (about 1 cup per 485 ml of evaporated milk) and adjust other liquids in the recipe. The texture and flavour will be slightly different."
faqQ4: "How long does opened condensed milk last in the fridge?"
faqA4: "Opened condensed milk keeps for about 2 weeks in the refrigerator when stored in an airtight container. For longer storage, you can freeze it for up to 3 months. Always check for any changes in smell, colour or texture before using."

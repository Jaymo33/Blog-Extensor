faqQ1: "Is 810 ml of soy sauce the same in US and UK cups?"
faqA1: "No, there's a slight difference. A UK metric cup is 250 ml, while a US cup is about 236.588 ml. So, 810 ml is roughly 3.42 US cups or 3.24 UK cups. Always check your recipe's origin for the most accurate conversion."

<p>Different countries use varying cup sizes, but the metric cup (250 ml) is common in the UK. If you're following a US recipe, note that their cup is slightly smaller (236.588 ml). Always double-check your recipe's origin to ensure accuracy. For air fryer cooking, even small discrepancies can affect the outcome, so measuring correctly is key.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter</h2>

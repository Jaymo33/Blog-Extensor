faqQ1: "Is 335 ml of coconut oil the same as 335 grams?"
faqA1: "No, 335 ml of coconut oil is not the same as 335 grams. The density of coconut oil varies slightly, but generally, 335 ml equals about 304 grams. Always check your recipe for weight vs. volume measurements to ensure accuracy."
faqQ2: "Can I substitute butter for 335 ml of coconut oil in air fryer recipes?"
faqA2: "Yes, you can substitute butter for coconut oil, but the results may differ. Butter contains water, which can affect texture, while coconut oil is pure fat. Use a 1:1 ratio, but expect slight variations in crispiness and flavour."
faqQ3: "How do I store leftover coconut oil after measuring 335 ml?"
faqA3: "Store leftover coconut oil in an airtight container at room temperature or in the fridge. It solidifies when cool but melts easily for future use. Avoid contamination by using clean utensils when scooping."
faqQ4: "Why is my air fryer smoking when I use coconut oil?"
faqA4: "Smoking usually occurs if the oil exceeds its smoke point (around 177°C for unrefined coconut oil). Ensure your air fryer isn’t overheating, and consider using refined coconut oil for higher-temperature cooking."

faqQ1: "Is 410 ml of half and half the same in the UK and USA?"
faqA1: "Yes, 410 ml of half and half is the same volume in both the UK and USA. However, cup sizes can vary slightly between countries. In the UK, a standard cup is 250 ml, while in the USA, it's 237 ml. For 410 ml, the difference is minimal, so 1.73 cups works for both."
faqQ2: "Can I use milk instead of half and half if I don't have 410 ml?"
faqA2: "You can substitute milk, but the texture and richness will differ. Half and half is half milk, half cream, so using just milk will make your dish less creamy. If you're in a pinch, mix 205 ml of milk with 205 ml of heavy cream to replicate 410 ml of half and half."
faqQ3: "How do I measure 410 ml of half and half without a measuring cup?"
faqA3: "If you don't have a measuring cup, use a kitchen scale. Half and half has a similar density to water, so 410 ml weighs about 410 grams. Alternatively, use a tablespoon (15 ml) and measure out roughly 27 tablespoons to get close to 410 ml."
faqQ4: "What recipes commonly use 410 ml of half and half?"

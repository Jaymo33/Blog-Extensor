<p>210 ml of condensed milk is approximately 0.89 cups in the US and 0.88 cups in the UK. This conversion is essential for baking and cooking, especially when using an air fryer for recipes that require precise measurements. Whether you're making a cake, fudge, or a creamy dessert, knowing how to convert 210 ml of condensed milk to cups ensures consistency in your results.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Condensed milk is a staple in many desserts, and even a slight variation in quantity can affect texture and sweetness. If you're using an air fryer for baking, precise measurements become even more critical due to the appliance's rapid cooking process. Too much condensed milk can make your dish overly sweet or soggy, while too little might leave it dry.

<p>Many recipes, especially those from different regions, use varying measurement systems. A UK recipe might list condensed milk in millilitres, while a US one uses cups. Understanding these conversions helps you follow any recipe without hassle. If you're exploring international desserts, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a> offers plenty of inspiration.</p>  

<h3>US vs. UK Cup Measurements</h3>  
<p>While the difference between US and UK cups is minimal, it's worth noting for precision. A US cup is 240 ml, whereas a UK cup is 250 ml. This means 210 ml of condensed milk is roughly 0.89 US cups or 0.88 UK cups. For most home baking, this small discrepancy won’t make a noticeable difference, but professional bakers might prefer the exact measurement.</p>  

<h2>How to Measure Condensed Milk Without a Scale</h2>  
<p>If you don’t have a measuring jug or scale, you can still measure 210 ml of condensed milk using tablespoons. One tablespoon holds about 15 ml, so 210 ml equals roughly 14 tablespoons. However, this method is less precise, so using a measuring cup is ideal for accuracy. For more measurement hacks, visit <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>.</p>  

<p>Another handy trick is to use the markings on the condensed milk can. Many brands include millilitre measurements, making it easy to pour the exact amount needed. If you're working with a new brand, always check the label first.

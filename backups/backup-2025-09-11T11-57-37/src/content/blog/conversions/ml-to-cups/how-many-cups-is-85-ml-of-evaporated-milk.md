faqQ1: "Is 85 ml of evaporated milk the same as regular milk?"
faqA1: "No, evaporated milk is thicker and more concentrated than regular milk. It’s made by removing about 60% of the water content, so 85 ml of evaporated milk has a richer texture and flavour. If substituting, dilute it with water (1:1 ratio) to match regular milk’s consistency."
faqQ2: "Can I use 85 ml of evaporated milk in air fryer baking?"
faqA2: "Absolutely! Evaporated milk adds creaminess and moisture to air fryer cakes, muffins, and custards. Just remember that 85 ml equals roughly 0.36 US cups, so measure carefully to avoid altering the recipe’s texture."
faqQ3: "How do I measure 85 ml of evaporated milk without a scale?"
faqA3: "Use a liquid measuring jug with millilitre markings for accuracy. If you only have cups, 85 ml is about 1/3 of a US cup or just under 1/3 of a UK cup. A tablespoon holds 15 ml, so 5 tablespoons plus 2 teaspoons will get you close."
faqQ4: "Does evaporated milk behave differently in air fryer recipes?"
faqA4: "Evaporated milk can caramelise faster due to its sugar content, so watch cooking times. In sauces or custards, it thickens well but may require slight adjustments in liquid ratios. Always preheat your air fryer for even results."

<p>85 ml of evaporated milk is roughly 0.36 cups in standard US measurements or 0.3 cups in UK imperial measurements. Whether you're baking a cake or whipping up a creamy sauce in your air fryer, getting the measurements right is key. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we know how crucial precision is for perfect results. Let’s dive into the details of converting 85 ml of evaporated milk to cups.</p>  

<h2>Understanding Evaporated Milk Measurements</h2>  
<p>Evaporated milk is a staple in many recipes, from desserts to savoury dishes. When a recipe calls for 85 ml of evaporated milk, it’s helpful to know the cup equivalent. In the US, 1 cup equals 240 ml, so 85 ml works out to just over a third of a cup (0.36 cups). In the UK, where 1 cup is 284 ml, 85 ml is closer to 0.3 cups. This small difference can matter in baking, so always check which measurement system your recipe uses.</p>  

<p>If you're using an air fryer for recipes like custards or creamy pasta bakes, precise measurements ensure even cooking.

It’s packed with handy tips for adapting traditional recipes to your air fryer.</p>  

<h2>Why Accuracy Matters in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers cook food quickly and evenly, but only if the ingredient ratios are correct. Too much liquid, like evaporated milk, can make dishes soggy, while too little can dry them out. Measuring 85 ml of evaporated milk accurately ensures your recipes turn out just right. A kitchen scale can help, but if you’re using cups, remember that 85 ml is slightly less than half a US cup.</p>  

<p>For air fryer baking, like making a moist cake or fluffy pancakes, evaporated milk adds richness without excess moisture. Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> for inspiration on using evaporated milk in sweet and savoury dishes. From creamy mac and cheese to indulgent bread puddings, the possibilities are endless.</p>  

<h3>Converting 85 ml of Evaporated Milk for Different Recipes</h3>  
<p>Some recipes, especially those from the US, might list evaporated milk in cups rather than millilitres. If you’re working with 85 ml, remember it’s about 0.36 US cups or 0.3 UK cups. For small batches of sauces or custards in the air fryer, this measurement is often just enough to add creaminess without overpowering other flavours.</p>  

<h3>Common Mistakes When Measuring Evaporated Milk</h3>  
<p>One mistake people make is confusing evaporated milk with condensed milk, which is much sweeter and thicker. Another is using a liquid measuring cup for small amounts like 85 ml—opt for a kitchen scale or a graduated measuring jug for accuracy.

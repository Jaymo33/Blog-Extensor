faqQ1: "Is 210 ml of vinegar the same as 1 cup?"
faqA1: "No, 210 ml of vinegar is slightly less than 1 cup. In the UK, 1 cup is 250 ml, so 210 ml equals 0.84 cups. In the US, 1 cup is 240 ml, making 210 ml roughly 0.875 cups."
faqQ2: "Can I use a tablespoon to measure 210 ml of vinegar?"
faqA2: "Yes! Since 1 tablespoon holds 15 ml, you’d need 14 tablespoons to reach 210 ml. This method is handy if you don’t have a measuring cup, though a scale (210 grams) is even more precise."
faqQ3: "Does the type of vinegar affect the cup measurement?"
faqA3: "No, all vinegar types (white, apple cider, balsamic) have similar densities, so 210 ml will always equal roughly 0.89 cups. However, flavours vary, so adjust recipes accordingly."
faqQ4: "How do I convert 210 ml of vinegar for a US air fryer recipe?"
faqA4: "For US recipes, 210 ml is about 0.875 cups. If the recipe calls for 1 cup, you’ll need to add an extra 30 ml (2 tablespoons) to match the measurement. Always check your air fryer’s capacity to avoid overflow."

<p>210 ml of vinegar is approximately 0.89 cups (just under 1 cup). This conversion is essential for precise cooking and baking, especially when using an air fryer where measurements can make or break a recipe. Whether you're whipping up a marinade or a tangy glaze, knowing how to convert millilitres to cups ensures your dish turns out perfectly every time.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of vinegar in your air fryer recipes can significantly impact the flavour and texture of your dish. Too much vinegar can overpower the taste, while too little might leave your meal lacking that zesty kick. For example, a recipe like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer honey-glazed chicken</a> relies on a balanced vinegar-to-honey ratio for the perfect sweet and sour finish.</p>  

<p>Additionally, precise measurements ensure even cooking. Air fryers circulate hot air rapidly, so liquids like vinegar evaporate faster than in conventional ovens. Measuring 210 ml of vinegar correctly (0.89 cups) helps maintain moisture and prevents drying out.

<h3>How to Measure 210 ml of Vinegar Without a Measuring Cup</h3>

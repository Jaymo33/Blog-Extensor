faqQ1: "Is 185 ml of condensed milk the same as ¾ cup?"
faqA1: "No, 185 ml of condensed milk is approximately 0.78 cups, which is just under ¾ cup. For precise baking, measure it as ¾ cup minus 1 teaspoon to avoid over-pouring."
faqQ2: "Can I use a kitchen scale to measure 185 ml of condensed milk?"
faqA2: "Yes, weighing condensed milk is another accurate method. Since its density is about 1.3 g/ml, 185 ml weighs roughly 240 grams. Use a kitchen scale for exact measurements if you prefer."
faqQ3: "Does the brand of condensed milk affect the conversion?"
faqA3: "Most brands have similar consistency, so the 185 ml to cups conversion stays consistent. However, check labels for added thickeners, which may slightly alter density in rare cases."
faqQ4: "How do I adjust air fryer cooking times for condensed milk recipes?"
faqA4: "Condensed milk sugars caramelise quickly, so reduce cooking times by 1–2 minutes and check frequently. Cover dishes with foil if browning too fast, as air fryers cook hotter than conventional ovens."

faqQ1: "Is 685 ml of balsamic vinegar the same as 3 cups?"
faqA1: "No, 685 ml of balsamic vinegar is approximately 2.9 cups, not 3 cups. While the difference might seem small, it can affect recipes, especially in air fryer cooking where precise measurements matter. Always use accurate conversions for best results."
faqQ2: "Can I use a kitchen scale instead of measuring cups for balsamic vinegar?"
faqA2: "Yes, a kitchen scale can provide even more accuracy. Balsamic vinegar weighs roughly 1.04 grams per ml, so 685 ml would be about 712 grams. However, measuring cups are more common in recipes, so knowing that 685 ml equals 2.9 cups is still useful."
faqQ3: "Does the type of balsamic vinegar affect the conversion?"
faqA3: "No, the conversion from ml to cups remains the same regardless of the balsamic vinegar’s quality or thickness. Whether it’s aged or cheap, 685 ml will always be approximately 2.9 cups. However, thicker varieties may pour more slowly, so measure carefully."
faqQ4: "How do I adjust a recipe if I only have 500 ml of balsamic vinegar?"
faqA4: "If a recipe calls for 685 ml (2.9 cups) but you only have 500 ml (about 2.1 cups), you can reduce other liquid ingredients slightly or make a smaller batch. Alternatively, substitute the missing vinegar with a mix of water and a splash of lemon juice for acidity."

faqQ1: "Is 360 ml of olive oil the same in US and UK cups?"
faqA1: "No, US and UK cups differ slightly. A UK metric cup is 250 ml, so 360 ml equals 1.44 cups. A US cup is 240 ml, making 360 ml approximately 1.5 cups. For air fryer recipes, this small difference usually won’t affect the outcome, but precise baking may require adjustments."
faqQ2: "Can I use a kitchen scale instead of measuring cups for 360 ml of olive oil?"
faqA2: "Yes, a kitchen scale is more accurate. Olive oil weighs roughly 0.92 grams per ml, so 360 ml equals about 331 grams. If your scale measures in grams, this method eliminates guesswork. However, most air fryer recipes provide measurements in volume (ml or cups) for convenience."
faqQ3: "How long will 360 ml of olive oil last in air fryer cooking?"
faqA3: "It depends on usage. Air fryers require less oil than deep frying—typically 1-2 tablespoons per batch. At this rate, 360 ml (about 24 tablespoons) could last for 12-24 cooking sessions. Storing olive oil in a cool, dark place preserves its quality for longer use."
faqQ4: "What’s the best way to measure 360 ml of olive oil without a jug?"
faqA4: "Use a standard drinking glass as a rough guide. A typical UK glass holds 200-250 ml, so 360 ml would be just under 1.5 glasses. For better accuracy, repurpose a clean yogurt pot marked with measurements or use tablespoon counts (360 ml ≈ 24 tablespoons)."

<h2>Understanding the Conversion</h2>  
<p>Converting 335 ml of yogurt to cups depends on which cup measurement you're usingâ€”US or UK. The US cup holds 240 ml, while the UK cup is slightly larger at 284 ml.

Always check whether your recipe uses UK or US measurements to avoid mistakes.</p>  

<h3>Why Accuracy Matters in Air Fryer Cooking</h3>

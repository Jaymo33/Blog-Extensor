faqQ1: "Does 2.0 cups of brown sugar weigh the same as white sugar?"
faqA1: "No, brown sugar is denser due to its molasses content. While 2.0 cups of granulated white sugar weigh about 400 grams, packed brown sugar can be slightly heavier—around 440 grams if firmly pressed. Always check your recipe’s requirements for accuracy."
faqQ2: "Can I reduce the sugar if converting a recipe for the air fryer?"
faqA2: "Air fryers intensify flavours, so you might reduce sugar by 10-15% without sacrificing taste. For 2.0 cups of brown sugar (400g), try 360g instead. Adjust based on your preference, but note that sugar also affects texture and browning."
faqQ3: "Why does my air fryer recipe taste too sweet with 2.0 cups of brown sugar?"
faqA3: "Air fryers caramelise sugars faster than ovens, amplifying sweetness. If your dish tastes overly sweet, try reducing the brown sugar to 1.5 cups (300g) or balancing it with acidic ingredients like lemon juice or yoghurt."
faqQ4: "How do I store leftover brown sugar after measuring 2.0 cups?"
faqA4: "Keep brown sugar in an airtight container to prevent hardening. If it clumps, revive it with a slice of bread or a microwave-safe damp paper towel for 20 seconds. Proper storage ensures it’s ready for your next air fryer baking session."

faqQ1: "Is 3.0 cups of butter the same in the UK and US?"
faqA1: "While the volume (3.0 cups) is the same, UK and US butter can differ slightly in density. UK butter blocks may weigh marginally more than US sticks. For precision, always convert 3.0 cups of butter to grams (680g) to ensure consistency in recipes."
faqQ2: "Can I use margarine instead of butter for 3.0 cups in grams?"
faqA2: "Margarine can be substituted, but its water content varies, affecting texture. If replacing, use the same gram weight (680g) for 3.0 cups, but expect slight differences in baking results. For air fryer recipes, butter is often preferred for flavour and browning."
faqQ3: "How do I measure 3.0 cups of butter if I don’t have a measuring cup?"
faqA3: "Use butter packaging markings—1 cup is typically 227g, so 3.0 cups would be roughly 680g. Alternatively, a standard 250ml metric cup can help approximate, though weighing is more reliable for baking."
faqQ4: "Why do air fryer recipes often use grams instead of cups?"
faqA4: "Grams provide precise measurements, crucial for air fryers’ rapid cooking. Unlike cups, grams account for ingredient density, ensuring even cooking and perfect texture. Converting 3.0 cups of butter to grams (680g) guarantees consistent results in air fryer baking."

<h2>Why Accurate Butter Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Baking is a science, and butter plays a crucial role in texture and flavour. Too much or too little can ruin a recipe, which is why converting 3.0 cups of butter to grams is so important. Air fryer recipes, like those on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, often require precise measurements for even cooking. Grams provide a more accurate measurement than cups, as butter density can vary slightly.</p>  

<p>For example, a <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>cake recipe</a> using 3.0 cups of butter will turn out perfectly if measured in grams. European and UK recipes typically use grams, making this conversion handy for international bakers. If you’re using an air fryer for baking, always weigh ingredients for the best results.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure Butter Correctly</h3>  
<p>Measuring butter can be confusing, especially when recipes call for cups or grams. For 3.0 cups of butter, use a kitchen scale for accuracy. If you don’t have one, check our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for quick reference. Pack butter firmly into a measuring cup, ensuring no air gaps, then level it off with a knife.</p>  

<h2>US vs. UK Butter Measurements</h2>  
<p>Butter measurements can differ between the US and UK. In the US, butter is often sold in sticks, while UK butter comes in blocks. This means 3.0 cups of butter in the US may slightly differ in weight from UK butter. Always double-check packaging labels for exact gram equivalents.</p>  

<p>For air fryer recipes, like those in our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cookies>cookie section</a>, sticking to grams eliminates confusion. If a recipe calls for 3.0 cups of butter, converting to grams ensures consistency regardless of where your butter comes from.</p>

faqQ1: "Is 2.75 cups of self-raising flour the same in the UK and US?"
faqA1: "While the cup measurement is the same, UK and US self-raising flours may differ in baking powder content. For accuracy, always weigh 2.75 cups as 330 grams, especially in air fryer recipes where precise rising is crucial."
faqQ2: "Can I use plain flour instead of self-raising flour for 2.75 cups?"
faqA2: "Yes, but you'll need to add baking powder. For every 330 grams (2.75 cups) of plain flour, mix in 2 teaspoons of baking powder. This adjustment ensures proper rise in air fryer bakes."
faqQ3: "Why does my air fryer cake turn out dense with 2.75 cups of self-raising flour?"
faqA3: "Over-measuring the flour could be the issue. If you packed the cups instead of weighing 330 grams, excess flour creates density. Always use a scale for air fryer baking to avoid this."
faqQ4: "How do I store self-raising flour after measuring 2.75 cups?"
faqA4: "Keep unused self-raising flour in an airtight container in a cool, dry place. This preserves its rising power for future air fryer recipes. For long-term storage, freeze the flour in a sealed bag."

<p>2.75 cups of self-raising flour equals approximately 330 grams. This conversion is essential for baking accuracy, especially when using an air fryer for cakes or bread. Whether you're following a recipe from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> or adjusting measurements, knowing the exact weight ensures perfect results every time.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Flour Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Baking is a science, and even small measurement errors can lead to dense or dry results. Self-raising flour contains baking powder, so precision is crucial. If you're using an air fryer for baking, like the recipes found on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes</a>, grams provide a more reliable measurement than cups. A digital kitchen scale removes guesswork and guarantees consistency.</p>  

<p>Many UK bakers prefer weighing ingredients, as cup measurements can vary based on how the flour is scooped. For air fryer recipes, especially cakes or muffins, 330 grams of self-raising flour ensures the right rise and texture.

<h3>How to Measure 2.75 Cups of Self-Raising Flour</h3>  
<p>To measure 2.75 cups of self-raising flour accurately, fluff the flour with a spoon before lightly scooping it into a measuring cup. Level off the excess with a knife for consistency. However, weighing 330 grams on a scale is far more reliable, especially for air fryer baking where even heat distribution affects outcomes.</p>  

<h2>Converting Cups to Grams for Different Flours</h2>  
<p>Not all flours weigh the same per cup. While 2.75 cups of self-raising flour is 330 grams, plain flour is slightly heavier at around 345 grams for the same volume. This difference matters in recipes, particularly for air fryer baking where texture is key. Always refer to a trusted conversion guide, like the one on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, for precise measurements.</p>  

<p>If you're adapting a US recipe, note that UK self-raising flour may have a different rising agent concentration. For best results, stick to weight measurements. Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>cake recipes</a> tailored for air fryers, where gram measurements ensure foolproof baking.</p>  

<h3>Common Mistakes When Measuring Flour</h3>  
<p>Packing flour into a cup or tapping the measuring cup compacts the flour, leading to excess. This can make your air fryer bakes dense. Always spoon flour lightly into the cup and level it off. For 2.75 cups of self-raising flour (330 grams), a scale eliminates these issues entirely.</p>  

<h2>Using Self-Raising Flour in Air Fryer Recipes</h2>  
<p>Self-raising flour works beautifully in air fryer cakes, scones, and batters. Since air fryers cook faster than ovens, precise measurements like 330 grams for 2.75 cups ensure even rising.

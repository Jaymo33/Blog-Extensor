faqQ1: "Does the type of cocoa powder affect the gram measurement?"
faqA1: "Yes, natural cocoa powder and Dutch-processed cocoa powder have slightly different densities, but the difference is minimal. For most recipes, 3.0 cups of either type will still weigh around 288 grams. Always spoon and level for the most accurate measurement."
faqQ2: "Can I use this conversion for other ingredients like flour or sugar?"
faqA2: "No, different ingredients have varying densities. For example, 3.0 cups of flour weigh about 360 grams, while sugar is closer to 600 grams. Always check a conversion chart specific to the ingredient you’re using."
faqQ3: "Why is measuring by weight better than measuring by cups?"
faqA3: "Weight measurements are more precise because cup measurements can vary based on how the ingredient is packed. Using grams ensures consistency, especially in air fryer baking where small deviations can affect cooking times and results."
faqQ4: "How should I store leftover cocoa powder after measuring 3.0 cups?"
faqA4: "Keep cocoa powder in an airtight container in a cool, dark place to maintain freshness. Proper storage prevents clumping and preserves flavour, ensuring your next bake with 3.0 cups (288g) of cocoa powder tastes just as good."

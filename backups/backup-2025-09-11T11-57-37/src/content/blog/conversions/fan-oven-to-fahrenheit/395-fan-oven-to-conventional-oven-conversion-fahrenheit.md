faqQ1: "What is 395 fan oven in Fahrenheit?"
faqA1: "395 fan oven is equivalent to 350°F in a conventional oven. This conversion is necessary because fan ovens circulate hot air, cooking food faster and more evenly. Always adjust your recipes accordingly for best results."
faqQ2: "How do I convert 395 fan oven to a conventional oven?"
faqA2: "To convert 395 fan oven to a conventional oven, simply reduce the temperature by 20-25 degrees. This means 395 fan oven becomes 350°F in a conventional oven. The same rule applies when using an air fryer."
faqQ3: "Can I use the same temperature for my air fryer?"
faqA3: "Yes, air fryers operate similarly to fan ovens, so you can use the same temperature conversion. For example, 395 fan oven translates to 350°F in both conventional ovens and air fryers. Always check your food for doneness, as cooking times may vary."
faqQ4: "Why do fan ovens cook faster than conventional ovens?"
faqA4: "Fan ovens circulate hot air, which cooks food more evenly and quickly. This is why you need to reduce the temperature when converting from a fan oven to a conventional oven. The same principle applies to air fryers, which also use circulating hot air."

<h2>Practical Tips for Cooking a 3.25 kg Beef Joint in Your Air Fryer</h2>
<p>Cooking a 3.25 kg beef joint in an air fryer requires some planning due to its size. Ensure your air fryer basket is large enough to accommodate the joint without overcrowding.

Save the drippings to make a delicious gravy to accompany your meal. Find more detailed cooking guides and times at <a href="https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk">airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>.</p>

This level of detail can be useful for baking or when preparing exact portions for specific dietary needs."

<p>Accurate measurements are the cornerstone of successful air fryer cooking, and converting 2.9 kilograms to pounds is a common need for many home chefs.

This is especially useful when dealing with frozen foods or large cuts of meat that need to be weighed before cooking.

For air frying, this level of precision helps ensure proper cooking times and temperature settings for your turkey crown."
faqQ2: "Why do I need to convert kg to pounds for air fryer cooking?"
faqA2: "Most air fryer recipes and cooking guidelines use pound measurements for specifying cooking times and temperatures. Converting your 10 kg turkey crown to pounds (approximately 22.05 pounds) ensures you follow these instructions accurately, preventing undercooking or overcooking. Since air fryers cook food rapidly with circulating hot air, precise timing based on weight is crucial for perfect results and food safety."
faqQ3: "Can my air fryer handle a 10 kg (22 lb) turkey crown?"
faqA3: "Most standard home air fryers cannot accommodate a full 10 kg (22 lb) turkey crown due to size limitations. You'll need to check your specific air fryer's capacity specifications before attempting to cook such a large cut. Some larger capacity or commercial-style air fryers might handle it, but you may need to cook in sections or use additional accessories like roasting racks for proper air circulation around the turkey crown."
faqQ4: "How long does a 10 kg turkey crown take in the air fryer?"
faqA4: "A 10 kg turkey crown (approximately 22 pounds) would typically require about 20-25 minutes per pound in an air fryer, totaling roughly 7-9 hours of cooking time.

For larger turkey crowns, traditional oven roasting is usually more appropriate, while air fryers work better with smaller cuts or turkey crown portions."

faqQ1: "How do I measure 1.66 cups of sesame seeds without a measuring cup?"
faqA1: "If you don’t have a measuring cup, you can use a kitchen scale to weigh out 13.28 ounces of sesame seeds instead. Alternatively, you could use a standard drinking glass (about 8 ounces) and measure approximately two-thirds of it to get close to 1.66 cups."
faqQ2: "Does the type of sesame seeds affect the weight measurement?"
faqA2: "While different types (white, black, or hulled) might have slight variations in density, the weight difference is minimal for cooking purposes. 1.66 cups of any sesame seeds will still be approximately 13.28 ounces. For most air fryer recipes, this small variation won’t affect the outcome."
faqQ3: "Can I use this conversion for other seeds in air fryer recipes?"
faqA3: "This specific conversion applies to sesame seeds, as different seeds have varying densities. For example, sunflower seeds or pumpkin seeds would have different weight measurements for the same volume. Always check specific conversion charts for other seeds when preparing air fryer recipes."
faqQ4: "Why do air fryer recipes sometimes use weight instead of volume measurements?"
faqA4: "Weight measurements are more accurate because volume can vary based on how ingredients are packed. In air fryer cooking, where even cooking is crucial, weight measurements like ounces ensure consistent results. That’s why knowing that 1.66 cups equals 13.28 ounces of sesame seeds is so helpful for air fryer recipes."

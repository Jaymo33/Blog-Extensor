faqQ1: "How do I convert 1.66 cups of turmeric to ounces without a scale?"
faqA1: "You can use measuring cups and spoons as a rough guide. Since 1 cup of turmeric is about 8 ounces, 1.66 cups would be roughly 13.28 ounces. For better accuracy, consider investing in a kitchen scale, especially for air fryer recipes where precise measurements matter."
faqQ2: "Does the type of turmeric affect the weight per cup?"
faqA2: "Yes, finely ground turmeric packs more densely than coarsely ground, so weight can vary slightly. However, for most home cooking, the standard conversion of 1.66 cups to 13.28 ounces works well. Always check your recipe for specific instructions."
faqQ3: "Can I use this conversion for fresh turmeric root?"
faqA3: "No, fresh turmeric has a different density. One cup of grated fresh turmeric weighs about 4.5 ounces, so 1.66 cups would be roughly 7.47 ounces. Powdered and fresh turmeric aren’t interchangeable without adjusting quantities."
faqQ4: "Why is measuring turmeric in ounces better for air fryer recipes?"
faqA4: "Air fryer cooking relies on even seasoning for consistent results. Measuring turmeric by weight (ounces) ensures uniformity, especially in marinades or rubs. Volume measurements (cups) can vary due to settling or packing, affecting flavour balance."

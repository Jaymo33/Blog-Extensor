faqQ1: "Can I use a dry measuring cup for 0.5 cup of fish sauce?"
faqA1: "No, dry measuring cups aren’t ideal for liquids like fish sauce. Use a liquid measuring cup for accuracy, as it accounts for the meniscus (the slight curve at the top). This ensures your 0.5 cup fish sauce to ounces conversion is precise."
faqQ2: "Does fish sauce weight vary by brand?"
faqA2: "Most fish sauces have a similar density, so 0.5 cup should equal roughly 4 ounces across brands. However, thicker or artisanal varieties might differ slightly. For critical recipes, weigh your fish sauce to confirm."
faqQ3: "How do I adjust recipes if I only have a scale?"
faqA3: "If your recipe calls for 0.5 cup of fish sauce (4 oz), simply weigh out 4 ounces on your scale. This method is often more accurate than volume measurements, especially for sticky liquids."
faqQ4: "Can I substitute soy sauce for fish sauce in air fryer recipes?"
faqA4: "While soy sauce can replace fish sauce in a pinch, the flavours differ. Fish sauce adds a unique umami depth. If substituting, start with half the amount (2 oz for 0.5 cup fish sauce) and adjust to taste."

faqQ1: "Does 0.33 cup of chopped garlic weigh the same as minced garlic?"
faqA1: "Yes, 0.33 cup of chopped garlic and minced garlic weigh roughly the same—about 1.76 ounces. However, minced garlic may pack slightly denser in a measuring cup, potentially adding an extra 0.1-0.2 oz. For absolute precision in air fryer recipes, weighing with a kitchen scale is best."
faqQ2: "Can I use jarred garlic instead of fresh for the 0.33 cup measurement?"
faqA2: "Jarred garlic can be substituted, but its weight per cup may differ due to added preservatives or oils. Typically, 0.33 cup of jarred chopped garlic weighs closer to 1.9 ounces. Adjust seasonings accordingly, as jarred garlic often has a milder flavour than fresh."
faqQ3: "How should I store leftover chopped garlic after measuring 0.33 cup?"
faqA3: "Store unused chopped garlic in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 2 weeks. For longer storage, freeze pre-portioned 0.33 cup (1.76 oz) amounts in ice cube trays with a bit of olive oil. This works perfectly for future air fryer recipes."
faqQ4: "Why do some recipes list garlic in ounces rather than cups?"
faqA4: "Weight measurements (ounces) are more accurate than volume (cups) because garlic’s density can vary. A 0.33 cup measurement equals 1.76 oz, but scales eliminate guesswork. Many UK air fryer recipes prefer weights for consistency, especially in baking or marinades."

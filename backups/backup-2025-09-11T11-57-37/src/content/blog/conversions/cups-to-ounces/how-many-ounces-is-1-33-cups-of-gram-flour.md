faqQ1: "Can I use gram flour interchangeably with all-purpose flour in air fryer recipes?"
faqA1: "Gram flour and all-purpose flour have different properties, so they’re not always interchangeable. Gram flour is gluten-free and absorbs more liquid, which can affect texture. For best results, follow recipes designed specifically for gram flour, like those on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>."
faqQ2: "Why does my gram flour coating turn out soggy in the air fryer?"
faqA2: "Sogginess usually happens if the coating is too thick or the food isn’t patted dry before coating. For crispier results, lightly spray the coated food with oil and avoid overcrowding the air fryer basket."
faqQ3: "How do I convert grams to ounces for gram flour?"
faqA3: "To convert grams to ounces, divide the gram weight by 28.35. For example, 150 grams of gram flour is roughly 5.3 ounces. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a> simplifies this for all common ingredients."
faqQ4: "Can I use gram flour for sweet air fryer recipes?"

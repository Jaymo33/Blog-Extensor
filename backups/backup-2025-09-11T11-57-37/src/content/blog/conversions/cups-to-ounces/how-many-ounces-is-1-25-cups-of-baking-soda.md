faqQ1: "How do I convert 1.25 cups of baking soda to ounces without a scale?"
faqA1: "You can use the spoon-and-level method: fluff the baking soda, spoon it into a measuring cup, and level it off. 1.25 cups roughly equals 10 ounces. For better accuracy, consider investing in a kitchen scale, especially for baking."
faqQ2: "Why does baking soda measurement matter in air fryer recipes?"
faqA2: "Baking soda is a leavening agent, so too much or too little can affect texture and taste. Precise measurements ensure your air fryer dishes, like cakes or fried chicken, turn out perfectly every time."
faqQ3: "Can I use baking powder instead of baking soda in air fryer recipes?"
faqA3: "Baking powder and baking soda aren’t interchangeable. Baking soda is stronger and requires an acid (like yogurt or vinegar) to activate. Check your recipe—substituting can alter the results."
faqQ4: "How long does baking soda last in the cupboard?"
faqA4: "Baking soda lasts about 6 months to a year if stored properly in an airtight container. To test its freshness, mix a little with vinegar—if it fizzes, it’s still active."

<p>1.25 cups of baking soda equals approximately 10 ounces. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes, where precise measurements can make or break your dish. Whether you're whipping up crispy <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer chicken</a> or fluffy baked goods, knowing the exact weight ensures consistency. Baking soda is a key ingredient in many recipes, and getting the amount right is crucial for texture and rise. Let’s dive deeper into why accurate conversions matter and how to measure baking soda perfectly every time.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate baking soda measurements matter</h2>  
<p>Using the correct amount of baking soda ensures your air fryer recipes turn out just right. Too little, and your baked goods won’t rise properly; too much, and they’ll taste bitter. Baking soda is a leavening agent, so precision is key. For example, if you’re making <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>air fryer cakes</a>, even a slight miscalculation can affect the final result. Measuring by weight (ounces) is often more reliable than volume (cups), especially for ingredients like baking soda that can settle or clump.</p>  

<p>Many home cooks rely on volume measurements, but weight is the gold standard in professional baking. A kitchen scale eliminates guesswork and ensures consistency. If you’re serious about air frying or baking, investing in a good scale is a game-changer. It’s also handy for converting other ingredients, like flour or sugar, which you might use in <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion charts</a>.</p>  

<h3>How to measure 1.25 cups of baking soda accurately</h3>  
<p>To measure 1.25 cups of baking soda, fluff the powder first to avoid compacting it. Spoon it lightly into a measuring cup and level it off with a straight edge. For the most accurate results, weigh it on a kitchen scale—10 ounces is your target. If you don’t have a scale, use the spoon-and-level method to minimise errors. This technique works well for other dry ingredients too, like when prepping <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cookies>air fryer cookies</a>.</p>  

<h2>Common baking soda conversions for air fryer recipes</h2>  
<p>Beyond 1.25 cups, here are some other handy baking soda conversions for air fryer cooking: 1 cup equals 8 ounces, 0.5 cup equals 4 ounces, and 2 cups equal 16 ounces. These conversions are useful for scaling recipes up or down. For instance, if you’re making a large batch of <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>air fryer veggies</a> with a baking soda wash, knowing these equivalents saves time.</p>  

<p>Baking soda isn’t just for baking—it’s also great for cleaning your air fryer. A mixture of baking soda and water can help remove stubborn grease.

Whether you’re cooking or cleaning, accurate measurements ensure the best results.</p>  

<h3>Tips for storing baking soda</h3>  
<p>Keep baking soda in an airtight container to maintain its potency. Moisture and air can cause it to clump or lose effectiveness over time. Store it in a cool, dry place, away from strong odours, as baking soda absorbs smells. Proper storage ensures it works perfectly in your air fryer recipes, from crispy coatings to fluffy batters.</p>

faqQ1: "Can I use a heaped cup of almond butter instead of weighing it?"
faqA1: "A heaped cup can lead to inaccurate measurements, as almond butter is dense and sticky. For best results, use a kitchen scale to measure 8.5 ounces per cup. This ensures your air fryer recipes have the right texture and don’t turn out overly greasy or dry."
faqQ2: "Does almond butter weight change if it’s natural or processed?"
faqA2: "Natural almond butter (without additives) may separate, making it slightly less dense. Stir it well before measuring to ensure consistency. Processed almond butter often has a uniform texture, but 1 cup still averages 8.5 ounces. Always check labels for oil content variations."
faqQ3: "How do I convert ounces to grams for almond butter?"
faqA3: "1 ounce equals roughly 28 grams, so 8.5 ounces of almond butter is about 240 grams. This conversion is useful for UK recipes or if your scale uses metric measurements. Precision matters in air fryer cooking, so grams can be easier for small adjustments."
faqQ4: "Can I substitute peanut butter for almond butter in air fryer recipes?"
faqA4: "Yes, but peanut butter has a slightly different density (1 cup ≈ 9 ounces). Adjust measurements accordingly and expect a flavour variation. Almond butter’s milder taste works well in desserts, while peanut butter adds a stronger, savoury note to dishes like satay."

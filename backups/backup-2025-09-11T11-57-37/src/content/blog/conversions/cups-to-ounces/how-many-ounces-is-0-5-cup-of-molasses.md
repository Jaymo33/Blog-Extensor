faqQ1: "Can I use honey instead of molasses in my air fryer recipe?"
faqA1: "Yes, you can substitute honey for molasses, but the flavour and texture will differ. Honey is sweeter and thinner, so use 0.5 cup (6 ounces) of honey but reduce other sugars in the recipe. Keep in mind that honey browns faster in the air fryer, so adjust cooking times accordingly."
faqQ2: "Why does my air fryer recipe taste too bitter with molasses?"
faqA2: "Bitterness can occur if you're using blackstrap molasses, which has a stronger, more robust flavour. For sweeter results, opt for light or dark molasses and stick to the 0.5 cup (6 ounces) measurement. Balancing it with spices like cinnamon or ginger can also help mellow the taste."
faqQ3: "How do I clean molasses residue from my air fryer?"
faqA3: "Molasses can be sticky, so wipe the air fryer basket with warm, soapy water immediately after use. For stubborn spots, a mix of baking soda and vinegar works well.

faqQ4: "Can I freeze leftover molasses for later use?"
faqA4: "Yes, molasses freezes well. Portion it into 0.5 cup (6-ounce) amounts in airtight containers or ice cube trays for easy use. Thaw at room temperature before adding it to your air fryer recipes. Freezing doesn’t affect its flavour or consistency."

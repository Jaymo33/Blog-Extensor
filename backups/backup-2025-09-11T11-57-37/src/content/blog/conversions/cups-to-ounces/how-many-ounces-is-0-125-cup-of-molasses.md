faqQ1: "Why is measuring molasses by weight better than by volume?"
faqA1: "Measuring molasses by weight (ounces) is more accurate because its thick, sticky consistency can lead to uneven filling in cups. A slight overpour or underpour can significantly alter your recipe. For air fryer baking, where precision matters, weighing ensures consistency."
faqQ2: "Can I use a tablespoon measure instead of 0.125 cup for molasses?"
faqA2: "Yes! 0.125 cup equals 2 tablespoons, so you can use a tablespoon measure if you don’t have a 1/8-cup measure. However, for the most accuracy, especially in air fryer recipes, a kitchen scale measuring 1.5 ounces is ideal."
faqQ3: "Does the type of molasses affect the weight per 0.125 cup?"
faqA3: "Light, dark, and blackstrap molasses have slightly different densities, but the difference in weight per 0.125 cup is minimal (about 1.4–1.6 oz). For most air fryer recipes, 1.5 ounces is a safe standard regardless of type."
faqQ4: "How do I clean molasses residue from my air fryer basket?"
faqA4: "Mix warm water with a little dish soap and let the basket soak to loosen sticky molasses residue. Avoid abrasive scrubbers that could damage non-stick coatings. For tough buildup, check our air fryer cleaner guide for detailed tips."

<p>0.125 cup of molasses equals approximately 1.5 ounces. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements can make or break your dish. Whether you're baking gingerbread cookies or glazing a ham, knowing the exact weight ensures consistency.

<h2>Why Convert Cups to Ounces for Molasses?</h2>  
<p>Measuring molasses by weight (ounces) is often more reliable than using volume (cups) because of its dense, viscous nature. A slight variation in how you fill the cup can lead to significant differences in the amount used. For air fryer recipes, especially those requiring precise ratios like cakes or sauces, accuracy is key. Converting 0.125 cup of molasses to ounces ensures you get the right consistency and flavour every time. Plus, it simplifies scaling recipes up or down without guesswork.</p>

If you don’t have one, lightly grease your measuring cup with oil to help the molasses slide out easily. Fill the cup to the 1/8th mark (since 0.125 cup is equivalent to 2 tablespoons). For air fryer recipes, even small discrepancies can affect texture, so weighing is the gold standard.

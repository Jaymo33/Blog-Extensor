faqQ1: "Can I use whole coriander seeds instead of 0.33 cup ground coriander?"
faqA1: "Yes, but you'll need to adjust the quantity. Whole coriander seeds are less concentrated in flavour. For every 0.33 cup (1.06 oz) of ground coriander, use about 0.5 cup of whole seeds, lightly crushed. Toast them briefly in your air fryer at 160Â°C for 2 minutes to enhance their aroma before grinding."
faqQ2: "How long will 0.33 cup of ground coriander stay fresh?"
faqA2: "Properly stored in an airtight container away from light and heat, ground coriander maintains optimal flavour for 6 months. The 0.33 cup (1.06 oz) portion will gradually lose potency after this period. For best results in air fryer cooking, buy small quantities and refresh your supply regularly."
faqQ3: "Does the brand of ground coriander affect the 0.33 cup to ounce conversion?"
faqA3: "Different brands can vary slightly in grind density, but the difference is minimal. Premium brands may be more finely ground, potentially packing slightly more into 0.33 cup. When precision matters for air fryer recipes, weighing your 0.33 cup portion (aiming for 1.06 oz/30g) eliminates any uncertainty."
faqQ4: "Can I substitute fresh coriander for 0.33 cup ground in air fryer recipes?"
faqA4: "Fresh coriander (cilantro) has a completely different flavour profile and moisture content. For dry rubs or spice mixes in air fryer cooking, stick to ground coriander. If a recipe specifically calls for fresh, use about 1 cup chopped leaves to replace 0.33 cup ground, adjusting other liquid ingredients accordingly."

<p>If you don't have scales, fluff the coriander with a fork before lightly spooning it into a measuring cup. Avoid packing it down, as this can lead to nearly 20% more spice than intended.

faqQ1: "Can I use less than 1.5 cups of vegetable oil in my air fryer?"
faqA1: "Absolutely! Air fryers are designed to use minimal oil compared to traditional frying methods. While 1.5 cups (12 ounces) might be needed for certain recipes, you can often reduce this amount significantly. Many dishes achieve perfect crispiness with just a light spray of oil."
faqQ2: "Does the type of vegetable oil affect the ounce measurement?"
faqA2: "No, the type of vegetable oil doesn't change the volume-to-weight conversion. Whether you're using sunflower, canola, or corn oil, 1.5 cups will always equal 12 ounces. However, different oils have varying smoke points, which may affect cooking temperatures in your air fryer."
faqQ3: "How do I measure 1.5 cups of vegetable oil without a measuring cup?"
faqA3: "If you don't have measuring cups, you can use a kitchen scale to weigh out 12 ounces of vegetable oil. Alternatively, remember that 1 tablespoon equals 0.5 ounces, so you'd need 24 tablespoons to make 1.5 cups (12 ounces). A standard drinking glass holds about 8 ounces, so 1.5 glasses would approximate the measurement."
faqQ4: "Is 1.5 cups of vegetable oil too much for air fryer cooking?"
faqA4: "For most air fryer recipes, 1.5 cups (12 ounces) would be excessive unless you're preparing a large batch or certain battered foods. Typically, air frying requires just 1-2 tablespoons of oil. Always check your specific recipe requirements and remember that air fryers need far less oil than deep frying methods."

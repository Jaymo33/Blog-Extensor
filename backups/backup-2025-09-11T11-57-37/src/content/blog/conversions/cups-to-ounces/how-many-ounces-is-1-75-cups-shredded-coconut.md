faqQ1: "Can I use desiccated coconut instead of shredded coconut in air fryer recipes?"
faqA1: "Yes, you can substitute desiccated coconut for shredded coconut, but the texture will differ. Desiccated coconut is finer and drier, so you may need slightly less (about 1.5 cups or 4.5 oz for the same flavour intensity). Adjust based on your recipe’s needs."
faqQ2: "How do I convert 1.75 cups of shredded coconut to grams?"
faqA2: "1.75 cups of shredded coconut (5.25 oz) is approximately 150 grams. If your air fryer recipe uses metric measurements, this conversion ensures accuracy. Always use a kitchen scale for the most precise results."
faqQ3: "Why does my air fryer recipe call for shredded coconut by weight instead of volume?"
faqA3: "Weight measurements (like ounces or grams) are more accurate than volume (cups) because shredded coconut can settle or fluff up. This precision is crucial in air fryer cooking, where even heat distribution affects the final result."
faqQ4: "Can I freeze shredded coconut for later use in air fryer recipes?"
faqA4: "Absolutely! Freezing shredded coconut preserves its freshness. Just portion it into 1.75-cup (5.25 oz) amounts for easy use later. Thaw at room temperature before adding to your air fryer dishes."

faqQ1: "Can I use grated carrot instead of shredded carrot for 0.375 cup?"
faqA1: "Yes, grated carrot can be used as a substitute for shredded carrot in most recipes. However, grated carrot tends to be finer, which may slightly affect texture. For 0.375 cup (1.5 oz), the weight remains the same, but the volume might appear different due to the finer shred."
faqQ2: "How do I store leftover shredded carrot for air fryer recipes?"
faqA2: "Store leftover shredded carrot in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 3 days. For longer storage, freeze it in portions. When ready to use, thaw and pat dry to remove excess moisture before adding to your air fryer recipes."
faqQ3: "Does 0.375 cup of shredded carrot change weight when cooked?"
faqA3: "Yes, shredded carrot loses some water content when cooked, making it lighter. Raw 0.375 cup (1.5 oz) may reduce to about 1.2 ounces after air frying. Adjust recipes accordingly if precision is crucial."
faqQ4: "Can I use baby carrots instead of shredded carrot for this measurement?"
faqA4: "Baby carrots can be shredded to match 0.375 cup (1.5 oz), but whole baby carrots won’t provide the same texture or cook evenly in an air fryer. For best results, shred them finely before measuring."

faqQ1: "Can I use liquid milk instead of powdered milk in air fryer recipes?"
faqA1: "Yes, but you’ll need to adjust the recipe. Substitute 1 cup of liquid milk for every 1/4 cup of powdered milk plus 1 cup of water. Keep in mind that liquid milk adds moisture, which may affect crispiness in air-fried dishes."
faqQ2: "Why does powdered milk weigh less per cup than liquid milk?"
faqA2: "Powdered milk is dehydrated, removing water content, so it’s lighter by volume. One cup of powdered milk weighs about 4 ounces, while liquid milk weighs 8 ounces per cup. Always check your recipe’s requirements for accuracy."
faqQ3: "How do I convert ounces back to cups if my scale stops working?"
faqA3: "For powdered milk, 1 ounce equals roughly 0.125 cups. So, 14 ounces (1.75 cups) would be 14 x 0.125 = 1.75 cups. Keep a conversion chart handy for quick reference during kitchen emergencies."
faqQ4: "Does the brand of powdered milk affect the weight per cup?"
faqA4: "Slight variations exist between brands due to processing methods, but the difference is minimal. For precise baking, stick to one brand or weigh your powdered milk to ensure consistency in air fryer recipes."

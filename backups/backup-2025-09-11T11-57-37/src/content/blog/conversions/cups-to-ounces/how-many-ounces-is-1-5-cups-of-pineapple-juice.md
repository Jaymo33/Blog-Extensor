<p>1.5 cups of pineapple juice equals 12 fluid ounces (oz). Whether you're whipping up a marinade, glaze, or a refreshing drink for your air fryer recipes, knowing this conversion ensures accuracy in your cooking. Pineapple juice adds a sweet-tangy kick to dishes, and measuring it correctly can make all the difference.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Precision is key when working with liquids like pineapple juice, especially in air fryer cooking. Too much or too little can alter the texture and flavour of your dish. For example, a marinade with too much juice might make meat soggy, while too little could leave it dry. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we emphasise the importance of exact measurements for consistent results.</p>  

<p>If you're adapting a recipe from cups to ounces, a reliable conversion chart is handy. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for quick reference. Whether you're making glazed chicken or a tropical dessert, 1.5 cups (12 oz) of pineapple juice will give you the perfect balance.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure Pineapple Juice Correctly</h3>  
<p>Use a liquid measuring cup for accuracy, filling it to the 1.5-cup mark at eye level. If you're using a kitchen scale, set it to fluid ounces and pour until it hits 12 oz. For recipes requiring weight instead of volume, note that 1.5 cups of pineapple juice weighs roughly 12.5 oz due to its density.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for Pineapple Juice in Air Fryer Recipes</h2>  
<p>Pineapple juice isn't just for drinking—it's a versatile ingredient in air fryer cooking. From tenderising meats to adding sweetness to desserts, it’s a staple in many kitchens. Try it in a Hawaiian-style glaze for chicken or as a base for a tropical marinade. Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> for inspiration.</p>  

<p>For a quick and easy dish, mix 1.5 cups (12 oz) of pineapple juice with soy sauce, garlic, and ginger for a flavourful marinade. Let your protein soak for 30 minutes before air frying for a juicy, tangy result. Pineapple juice also works wonders in desserts like upside-down cake or as a glaze for grilled fruit.</p>  

<h3>Converting Pineapple Juice for UK Measurements</h3>  
<p>In the UK, fluid ounces are slightly different from US measurements, but for pineapple juice, the difference is minimal. 1.5 UK cups equal approximately 12.3 oz, close enough for most recipes. If precision is critical, use a digital scale set to metric (355 ml for 1.5 cups).</p>  

<h2>Tips for Storing Pineapple Juice</h2>  
<p>Once opened, pineapple juice lasts about 7–10 days in the fridge. For longer storage, freeze it in ice cube trays and use as needed.

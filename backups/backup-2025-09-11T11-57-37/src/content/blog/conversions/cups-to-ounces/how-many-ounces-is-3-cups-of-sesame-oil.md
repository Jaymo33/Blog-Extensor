faqQ1: "Is 3 cups of sesame oil the same as 24 oz in the UK?"
faqA1: "Yes, 3 cups of sesame oil equals 24 fluid ounces in the UK, just like in the US. Fluid ounces measure volume, not weight, so the conversion remains consistent. This applies to all liquid ingredients, including oils."
faqQ2: "Can I use a kitchen scale to measure 3 cups of sesame oil?"
faqA2: "A kitchen scale measures weight, not volume, so 3 cups (24 oz) of sesame oil would weigh roughly 24 oz by volume. For precision, use a liquid measuring cup for volume or confirm your scale’s fluid-ounce setting."
faqQ3: "How much sesame oil should I use in an air fryer?"
faqA3: "For air frying, 1–2 tablespoons (0.5–1 oz) of sesame oil per batch is usually enough. Since air fryers require less oil than traditional frying, 3 cups (24 oz) would be excessive unless cooking in bulk."
faqQ4: "Does sesame oil smoke at high temperatures in an air fryer?"
faqA4: "Sesame oil has a high smoke point (around 410°F or 210°C), making it suitable for air frying. However, using too much (like 24 oz for a small batch) can cause smoke. Stick to light coatings for best results."

<p>3 cups of sesame oil equals approximately 24 fluid ounces (or 24 oz). This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements ensure perfect results. Sesame oil is a staple in many dishes, from stir-fries to dressings, and knowing its weight helps streamline cooking. Whether you're using an air fryer or traditional methods, accurate conversions prevent mishaps.

<h2>Why accurate sesame oil measurements matter</h2>  
<p>Sesame oil adds depth to marinades, sauces, and air-fried dishes, but too much can overpower flavours. Measuring 3 cups of sesame oil correctly (24 oz) ensures balanced recipes. Air fryers, with their rapid cooking, need precise oil quantities to avoid soggy or dry results. Over-pouring can also lead to excess smoke, while under-measuring may leave food bland.

<p>Different oils have varying densities, but sesame oil’s weight is consistent at 8 oz per cup. This makes scaling recipes straightforward, whether doubling or halving quantities. If you’re adapting a recipe from volume (cups) to weight (ounces), this ratio is key. For example, a recipe calling for 1.5 cups of sesame oil would need 12 oz.

<h3>How to measure sesame oil for air frying</h3>  
<p>Use a liquid measuring cup for accuracy when portioning 3 cups (24 oz) of sesame oil. Pour slowly to the brim at eye level, avoiding spills or air gaps. For smaller amounts, a kitchen scale set to ounces ensures precision. Since air fryers require minimal oil, measuring correctly prevents wasteful overuse. Need cleaning tips after oil-heavy recipes?

<h2>Common uses for sesame oil in air fryers</h2>  
<p>Sesame oil’s nutty flavour enhances air-fried vegetables, tofu, and meats. A light coating (about 1–2 oz per batch) ensures crispiness without greasiness. For marinades, blend 3 cups (24 oz) of sesame oil with soy sauce, garlic, and ginger. This quantity suits large batches, ideal for meal prepping.

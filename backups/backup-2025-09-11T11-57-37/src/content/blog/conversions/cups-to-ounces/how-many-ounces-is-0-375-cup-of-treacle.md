faqQ1: "Can I use golden syrup instead of treacle in my air fryer recipe?"
faqA1: "Yes, golden syrup can substitute treacle in most recipes. Use the same weight (3 oz for 0.375 cup) for similar results. Golden syrup is lighter in flavour, so adjust spices if needed. It works well in cakes, glazes, and marinades."
faqQ2: "How do I clean treacle residue from my air fryer basket?"
faqA2: "Soak the basket in warm, soapy water to loosen treacle residue. For stubborn spots, use a soft brush or sponge. Avoid abrasive cleaners to protect non-stick coatings. Regular cleaning prevents buildup and maintains performance."
faqQ3: "Why is measuring treacle by weight better than volume?"
faqA3: "Treacle’s thickness makes volume measurements inconsistent. Weighing ensures accuracy, especially in air fryer recipes where precision affects cooking times and textures. A kitchen scale eliminates guesswork for perfect results every time."
faqQ4: "Can I reduce the amount of treacle in a recipe for less sweetness?"
faqA4: "Yes, but adjust other liquids to maintain balance. Reducing treacle by half (1.5 oz for 0.375 cup) still adds flavour without overpowering sweetness. Experiment with small batches to find your preferred taste."

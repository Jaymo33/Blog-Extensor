faqQ1: "Can I use double cream instead of single cream in a 1.75 cup measurement?"
faqA1: "Yes, but note that double cream is thicker and richer, so the weight will differ slightly. While 1.75 cups of single cream equals 14 fluid ounces, double cream may weigh more due to its higher fat content. Adjust other recipe elements accordingly."
faqQ2: "How do I convert 1.75 cups of single cream to grams?"
faqA2: "1.75 cups (14 fluid ounces) of single cream is roughly 400 grams. For precise baking or air fryer recipes, use a kitchen scale to measure by weight, as volume measurements can vary slightly depending on the cream’s temperature and density."
faqQ3: "Is there a difference between US and UK ounces for single cream?"
faqA3: "Yes, US fluid ounces are slightly smaller than UK fluid ounces. A UK fluid ounce is about 28.4ml, while a US fluid ounce is 29.6ml. For 1.75 cups of single cream, this means 14 UK fluid ounces equals roughly 13.2 US fluid ounces."
faqQ4: "Can I substitute milk for single cream in a 1.75 cup measurement?"
faqA4: "You can, but milk has a lower fat content, which may affect texture and flavour. If replacing 1.75 cups of single cream with milk, consider adding a thickener like cornflour or reducing the liquid slightly to compensate for the difference in richness."

<p>Measuring liquids like single cream can be tricky, as volume and weight don’t always align perfectly. A standard UK cup holds 8 fluid ounces, so 1.75 cups would be 14 fluid ounces. However, density can vary slightly, so using a kitchen scale for precision is recommended. This is particularly useful for air fryer recipes where even small discrepancies can affect cooking times and textures.</p>  

<h3>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h3>

Too much or too little single cream can alter the moisture content of your dish, leading to soggy or dry results.

<h2>Converting Cups to Ounces for Different Ingredients</h2>  
<p>While 1.75 cups of single cream equals 14 fluid ounces, other ingredients may differ.

faqQ1: "Is 0.5 cup of vegetable oil the same as 4 ounces in the UK?"
faqA1: "Yes, 0.5 cup of vegetable oil is approximately 4 ounces (113 grams) in the UK. While cup measurements can vary slightly by region, this conversion is standard for most recipes, including air fryer dishes. Always use a kitchen scale for absolute precision."
faqQ2: "Can I use olive oil instead of vegetable oil in the same amount?"
faqA2: "Yes, you can substitute olive oil for vegetable oil in a 1:1 ratio by volume (0.5 cup equals 4 ounces). However, olive oil has a stronger flavour and lower smoke point, which may affect taste and cooking performance in an air fryer. Adjust based on your recipe’s needs."
faqQ3: "How do I measure 0.5 cup of vegetable oil without a measuring cup?"
faqA3: "If you don’t have a measuring cup, use a kitchen scale to weigh out 4 ounces (113 grams) of vegetable oil. Alternatively, a standard UK tablespoon holds 0.5 ounces, so 8 tablespoons equal 0.5 cup. For more measurement tips, visit our conversion guide."
faqQ4: "Why does my air fryer recipe specify oil in ounces instead of cups?"
faqA4: "Ounces provide a more accurate measurement, especially for air fryers where excess oil can lead to uneven cooking or smoke. Weight measurements (like 4 ounces for 0.5 cup) eliminate variability from how ingredients settle in a cup. This precision is key for perfect air-fried results."

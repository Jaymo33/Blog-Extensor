faqQ1: "Does the type of onion affect the weight of 0.5 cup?"
faqA1: "While red, white, and yellow onions have similar densities, spring onions or shallots may vary slightly. For most standard onions, 0.5 cup will weigh approximately 2 ounces. If using a different variety, a kitchen scale ensures accuracy."
faqQ2: "Can I use frozen chopped onion instead of fresh?"
faqA2: "Yes, but frozen onions may release more moisture during cooking. If substituting, use the same 0.5 cup measurement (about 2 ounces) but pat them dry first. Adjust air fryer time slightly to account for extra moisture."
faqQ3: "How do I store leftover chopped onion?"
faqA3: "Store unused chopped onion in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 3 days. For longer storage, freeze it in 0.5 cup (2-ounce) portions. Thaw before using in air fryer recipes to avoid excess water."
faqQ4: "Why does my air fryer recipe taste too oniony?"
faqA4: "If your dish tastes overly strong, you may have used more than 0.5 cup (2 ounces) of chopped onion. Measure carefully next time, and balance flavours with other ingredients like herbs or spices. Overcrowding the air fryer can also intensify onion flavours."

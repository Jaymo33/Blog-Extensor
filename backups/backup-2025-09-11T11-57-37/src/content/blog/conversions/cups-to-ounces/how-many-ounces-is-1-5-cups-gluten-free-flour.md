faqQ1: "Does the type of gluten-free flour affect the weight per cup?"
faqA1: "Yes, different gluten-free flours (almond, rice, coconut) vary slightly in density. Almond flour is lighter, while coconut flour is more absorbent. Always check the package or weigh for accuracy, especially in air fryer recipes where precision matters."
faqQ2: "Can I use the same conversion for regular flour?"
faqA2: "No, regular wheat flour weighs about 4.5 oz per cup, while gluten-free blends average 4.2–4.5 oz. Stick to gluten-free-specific conversions for best results, particularly in air fryer baking where texture is key."
faqQ3: "Why is weighing flour better than using cups?"
faqA3: "Weighing eliminates inconsistencies from packing or scooping techniques. Gluten-free baking relies on exact ratios, and a scale ensures reliability. For air fryer recipes, this precision prevents undercooked or overly dense results."
faqQ4: "How do I adjust air fryer recipes for gluten-free flour?"
faqA4: "Reduce cooking time slightly, as gluten-free goods brown faster. Add 1 tsp xanthan gum per cup of flour for binding. Check our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> for tested gluten-free adaptations."

<h2>How many ounces is 1.5 cups of gluten-free flour?</h2>  
<p>1.5 cups of gluten-free flour equals approximately 6.35 ounces (180 grams).

<p>Gluten-free flours vary in density, so weighing ingredients is more reliable than volume measurements.

<h3>Why weight matters in gluten-free baking</h3>  
<p>Gluten-free flours lack the binding properties of wheat flour, making accurate measurements crucial. Too much or too little flour can lead to crumbly or gummy textures. For air fryer recipes, where heat circulates rapidly, precise ratios ensure even browning. A kitchen scale is your best friend here—skip the guesswork and measure directly in ounces.

<h2>Converting cups to ounces for UK bakers</h2>  
<p>In the UK, bakers often work in grams, but ounces are still widely used. 1.5 cups of gluten-free flour translates to 6.35 oz (180g), regardless of location. If your recipe uses metric measurements, a digital scale simplifies the process. Air fryer baking benefits from this precision, as even slight imbalances affect cooking time.

<p>Note that US and UK cup sizes are identical (240ml per cup), so no adjustment is needed. However, gluten-free flour brands may vary in weight per cup due to texture. Always check the packaging or weigh for accuracy. Planning a batch of air fryer cookies?

<h3>Tips for measuring gluten-free flour</h3>  
<p>Spoon the flour into the measuring cup and level it off—don’t scoop directly, as this compacts the flour. For air fryer recipes, sifting the flour first ensures a lighter texture. If you’re doubling a recipe, weigh each batch separately to maintain consistency.

faqQ1: "Can I use fresh ginger instead of 0.375 cup ginger paste?"
faqA1: "Yes, you can substitute fresh ginger for ginger paste. Use about 1 tablespoon of freshly grated ginger for every 3 ounces (0.375 cup) of ginger paste required. Keep in mind the flavour will be slightly more intense and texture different in your air fryer dishes."
faqQ2: "How long does 0.375 cup of ginger paste last in the fridge?"
faqA2: "A measured 0.375 cup (3 ounces) of ginger paste will last about 2 weeks in the refrigerator when stored properly in an airtight container. For longer storage, freeze it in portions. Always check for mould or off smells before using in your air fryer recipes."
faqQ3: "Why is weighing ginger paste better than measuring by volume?"
faqA3: "Weighing ginger paste gives more accurate results because its density can vary. A 0.375 cup measurement might not always equal exactly 3 ounces if the paste is particularly thick or watery. For consistent air fryer results, a kitchen scale is your best friend."
faqQ4: "What air fryer recipes commonly use 0.375 cup ginger paste?"
faqA4: "Many Asian-inspired air fryer recipes use this amount of ginger paste, including ginger chicken, glazed pork, and vegetable stir-fries. It's also perfect for marinades and sauces. Check our recipe collection for dishes specifically calling for this measurement."

<p>0.375 cup of ginger paste equals approximately 3 ounces. This conversion is essential for precise cooking, especially when using an air fryer where ingredient measurements can impact texture and flavour. Whether you're following a recipe from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> or experimenting with your own dishes, knowing the exact weight ensures consistent results.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate ginger paste measurements matter</h2>  
<p>Ginger paste adds a punch of flavour to dishes, but too much or too little can throw off your recipe. In an air fryer, where cooking times are shorter, precise measurements help avoid overpowering or underwhelming results. For example, a dish like air-fried ginger chicken from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>our recipe collection</a> relies on the right balance of ginger paste for the perfect taste.</p>  

<p>Using 0.375 cup of ginger paste (or 3 ounces) ensures you get the intended flavour without wasting ingredients. This measurement is particularly useful for marinades, sauces, and rubs where ginger paste plays a starring role.

<h3>How to measure ginger paste correctly</h3>  
<p>For the most accurate measurement, use a kitchen scale to weigh your ginger paste. If you don't have one, spoon the paste into a measuring cup and level it off with a straight edge. Remember that ginger paste can vary in density, so weighing is always best for precision.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for 0.375 cup ginger paste</h2>  
<p>This quantity of ginger paste (3 ounces) is perfect for many air fryer recipes. It's enough to marinate 4-6 chicken thighs or create a flavourful glaze for vegetables.

<p>Beyond meats, 0.375 cup of ginger paste works wonderfully in vegetarian dishes too. Try it in an air-fried tofu stir-fry or as part of a marinade for roasted vegetables. The versatility of this measurement makes it a kitchen staple for air fryer enthusiasts.</p>  

<h3>Storing leftover ginger paste</h3>  
<p>If you have leftover ginger paste after measuring out your 0.375 cup (3 ounces), store it in an airtight container in the fridge. It will keep for about 2 weeks, ready for your next air fryer creation. For longer storage, freeze portions in ice cube trays.</p>  

<h2>Converting other ginger paste measurements</h2>  
<p>While we've focused on 0.375 cup to ounces, you might need other conversions. A full cup of ginger paste equals about 8 ounces, while 1 tablespoon is roughly 0.5 ounces. These conversions come in handy when scaling recipes up or down for your air fryer.</p>

<h3>Ginger paste substitutes in a pinch</h3>

faqQ1: "How do I convert 2.5 cups of baking powder to grams?"
faqA1: "To convert 2.5 cups of baking powder to grams, multiply the ounces by 28.35 (since 1 ounce = 28.35 grams). So, 20 ounces (2.5 cups) equals approximately 567 grams. This conversion is useful for recipes that use metric measurements."
faqQ2: "Can I use baking soda instead of baking powder in air fryer recipes?"
faqA2: "Baking soda and baking powder are not interchangeable. Baking soda requires an acidic ingredient to activate, while baking powder contains its own acid. If a recipe calls for 2.5 cups of baking powder (20 ounces), substituting baking soda could alter the texture and taste."
faqQ3: "How long does baking powder last once opened?"
faqA3: "Opened baking powder typically lasts 6–12 months if stored properly in an airtight container. To test its potency, mix a teaspoon with hot water—if it fizzes, it’s still active. Expired baking powder won’t give your air fryer recipes the desired rise."
faqQ4: "Why does my air fryer cake taste bitter?"
faqA4: "A bitter taste often results from using too much baking powder. Ensure you’re measuring accurately—2.5 cups equals 20 ounces. Over-measuring can leave a metallic aftertaste. Also, check that your baking powder isn’t expired, as this can affect flavour."

<p>2.5 cups of baking powder equals approximately 20 ounces. This conversion is essential for precise baking, especially when using an air fryer for cakes, cookies, or other treats. Accurate measurements ensure your recipes turn out perfectly every time, whether you’re following a classic cake recipe or experimenting with new air fryer creations.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Baking</h2>  
<p>Baking powder is a leavening agent, and using the right amount is crucial for achieving the perfect rise in your baked goods. Too little, and your cakes or cookies may turn out dense. Too much, and they could collapse or taste bitter. When using an air fryer, precise measurements like converting 2.5 cups of baking powder to ounces (20 oz) help maintain consistency across recipes.</p>  
<p>For example, if you’re making air fryer cupcakes or muffins, the correct amount of baking powder ensures a light, fluffy texture. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> for inspiration on how to use these measurements in delicious desserts.</p>

<h3>How to Measure 2.5 Cups of Baking Powder Correctly</h3>  
<p>To measure 2.5 cups of baking powder accurately, use a dry measuring cup and level it off with a straight edge. Scooping directly from the container can compact the powder, leading to an incorrect measurement. For best results, weigh it on a kitchen scale—20 ounces is the precise weight for 2.5 cups.</p>

<h2>Common Uses for 2.5 Cups of Baking Powder</h2>  
<p>This quantity is often used in large-batch baking, such as for multiple cakes or a big batch of cookies. If you’re meal prepping or hosting, knowing that 2.5 cups of baking powder equals 20 ounces helps streamline your cooking process. It’s also handy for scaling recipes up or down depending on your needs.</p>  
<p>For instance, if you’re preparing a big batch of air fryer cookies, you might need to adjust the recipe. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> can help you make these adjustments effortlessly.</p>

<h3>Converting Other Baking Powder Quantities</h3>  
<p>If you need to convert smaller or larger amounts, the same principle applies: 1 cup of baking powder equals 8 ounces. So, 1.5 cups would be 12 ounces, and 3 cups would be 24 ounces. This makes it easy to adapt any recipe, whether you’re baking a single cake or a large batch of desserts.</p>

<h2>Tips for Storing Baking Powder</h2>  
<p>To keep your baking powder fresh and effective, store it in an airtight container in a cool, dry place. Moisture can cause it to clump or lose its potency, which could affect your air fryer recipes. If you’re unsure whether your baking powder is still active, test it by mixing a teaspoon with hot water—if it bubbles, it’s still good to use.</p>

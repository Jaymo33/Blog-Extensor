<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on even heat distribution, so ingredient proportions can make or break a dish. Too many chia seeds, for example, can dry out a recipe, while too few might not provide the desired binding effect. This is especially important for baked goods like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>air fryer cakes</a> or energy bites. Measuring 0.375 cup of chia seeds correctly ensures your recipes turn out flawless every time.</p>  

<p>Chia seeds absorb liquid, so their weight can slightly vary based on moisture content. However, 0.375 cup typically translates to 1.5 ounces, making it easy to scale recipes. If you’re meal prepping or doubling a recipe, this conversion saves time and guesswork.

<h3>How to measure 0.375 cup of chia seeds without scales</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a kitchen scale, use a dry measuring cup and level off the top with a straight edge. A 0.375 cup measurement is equivalent to 6 tablespoons, which is handy for quick conversions. For best results, fluff the chia seeds before scooping to avoid compacting them. This method ensures you get the correct 1.5-ounce measurement for your air fryer recipes.</p>

faqQ1: "Can I use grams instead of ounces for 1.66 cups of semolina?"
faqA1: "Yes! 1.66 cups of semolina equals roughly 213 grams. Many UK scales offer gram measurements, which can be even more precise for baking. If your air fryer recipe uses grams, this conversion ensures accuracy."
faqQ2: "Why does my semolina coating fall off in the air fryer?"
faqA2: "This usually happens if the semolina isn’t pressed firmly onto the food or if the surface isn’t moist enough. For 1.66 cups (7.5 oz) of semolina, pat it onto damp chicken or fish. Preheat the air fryer to help the coating adhere."
faqQ3: "How long does semolina last once opened?"
faqA3: "Stored in an airtight container, semolina stays fresh for up to a year. If you’ve measured out 1.66 cups (7.5 oz) and have leftovers, seal them tightly to prevent moisture absorption, which affects texture in air fryer recipes."
faqQ4: "Can I substitute semolina with flour in air fryer recipes?"
faqA4: "Flour works but won’t give the same crispiness. Semolina’s coarse texture (like 1.66 cups/7.5 oz) creates a better crunch. For gluten-free options, try fine cornmeal in the same weight."

<p>1.66 cups of semolina equals approximately 7.5 ounces (oz). This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precision ensures perfect results every time. Whether you're making crispy semolina-coated chicken or baking a semolina cake, knowing the exact weight helps avoid kitchen mishaps.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on even cooking, and incorrect measurements can lead to uneven textures or undercooked food. Semolina, a coarse wheat flour, is often used for coating or baking, so getting the right amount ensures crispiness without excess. For example, if a recipe calls for 1.66 cups of semolina, using 7.5 oz guarantees consistency.

<p>Many UK cooks prefer weighing ingredients like semolina for accuracy. Cups can vary based on how you scoop, but ounces provide a reliable standard. This is especially useful for air fryer recipes, where even small deviations affect cooking times.

<h3>How to Measure Semolina Correctly</h3>  
<p>For the most accurate 1.66 cups-to-ounces conversion, use a kitchen scale. Spoon semolina into a measuring cup without packing it down, then level it off. This method prevents over-measuring, which could make coatings too thick or batters too dense. If you’re adapting a recipe from volume to weight, 1.66 cups of semolina will always be close to 7.5 oz.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for Semolina in Air Fryers</h2>

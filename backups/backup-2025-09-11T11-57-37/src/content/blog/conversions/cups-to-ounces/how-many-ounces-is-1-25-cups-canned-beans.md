faqQ1: "Can I use dried beans instead of canned for this measurement?"
faqA1: "Yes, but you’ll need to cook and hydrate dried beans first. 1.25 cups of canned beans equals roughly ½ cup of dried beans before cooking. Soak them overnight, then simmer until tender. Drain before using in your air fryer."
faqQ2: "Do different types of canned beans weigh the same per cup?"
faqA2: "Most canned beans (kidney, black, pinto) weigh about 8 ounces per cup when drained. However, larger beans like butterbeans might be slightly heavier. Always check the can’s label for net weight if precision is crucial."
faqQ3: "How should I store leftover canned beans after measuring?"
faqA3: "Transfer unused beans to an airtight container and refrigerate for up to 3 days. For longer storage, freeze them in portion-sized bags. Thaw before reheating in the air fryer at 180°C for 2–3 minutes."
faqQ4: "Why does my air fryer recipe call for ounces instead of cups?"
faqA4: "Weight measurements (ounces) are more accurate than volume (cups), especially for air frying. Beans packed tightly in a cup can vary in quantity, while ounces ensure consistency. Use a kitchen scale for best results."

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on hot air circulation to cook food evenly, so ingredient quantities can affect cooking times and textures. Too many beans packed into the basket can lead to uneven crisping, while too few might dry out. Using 10 ounces (1.25 cups) of canned beans ensures consistent results for recipes like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/beans>bean-based dishes</a>. Drain and rinse the beans before measuring to avoid excess liquid skewing the weight.</p>  

<p>For best results, spread the beans in a single layer in your air fryer basket. This allows maximum airflow and even browning. If doubling a recipe, adjust the cooking time slightly—crowding the basket may require a few extra minutes. Need recipe ideas?

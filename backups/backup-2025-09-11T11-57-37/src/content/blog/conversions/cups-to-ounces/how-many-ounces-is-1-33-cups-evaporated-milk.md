faqQ1: "Can I use regular milk instead of evaporated milk in air fryer recipes?"
faqA1: "Yes, but you’ll need to adjust the quantity. Regular milk is thinner, so use 1.5 times the amount of evaporated milk. For 1.33 cups of evaporated milk, substitute with 2 cups of regular milk. Keep in mind the texture and flavour may differ slightly."
faqQ2: "How do I store leftover evaporated milk?"
faqA2: "Transfer any unused evaporated milk to an airtight container and refrigerate. It will keep for up to 5 days. For longer storage, freeze it in ice cube trays and thaw as needed. Always give it a good stir before using."
faqQ3: "Why is evaporated milk preferred in air fryer recipes?"
faqA3: "Evaporated milk’s concentrated richness enhances flavours without adding excess moisture, which is crucial for air fryer cooking. It helps achieve crispy textures while keeping dishes creamy inside. Plus, it’s less likely to curdle under high heat."
faqQ4: "Can I make my own evaporated milk at home?"
faqA4: "Absolutely! Simmer regular milk on low heat until it reduces by 60%. Stir frequently to prevent scorching. Homemade evaporated milk works just as well in air fryer recipes, though store-bought offers consistent results."

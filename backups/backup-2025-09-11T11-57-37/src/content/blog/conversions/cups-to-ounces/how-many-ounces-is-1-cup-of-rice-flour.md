faqQ1: "Does 1 cup of rice flour weigh the same as all-purpose flour?"
faqA1: "No, 1 cup of rice flour (4.5 oz) is lighter than all-purpose flour (5 oz per cup). Rice flour's finer texture means it packs differently, so always measure by weight for accuracy, especially in air fryer recipes."
faqQ2: "Can I substitute rice flour directly in recipes calling for wheat flour?"
faqA2: "Not always. Rice flour lacks gluten, so it may require additional binders like eggs or xanthan gum. For air frying, test small batches when converting 1 cup of rice flour to ounces in coatings or batters."
faqQ3: "Why does my rice flour measurement vary between brands?"
faqA3: "Different brands may grind rice flour to varying fineness, affecting how it settles in a cup. For consistent 1 cup rice flour to ounces results, weigh it or use the spoon-and-level method."
faqQ4: "How do I adjust cooking times for rice flour coatings in the air fryer?"
faqA4: "Rice flour browns faster than wheat flour. Reduce air fryer temperatures by 10Â°C and check food early. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>recipes</a> include tailored timing for gluten-free options."

<h2>Tips for Baking with Rice Flour</h2>

<h3>Storing Rice Flour Properly</h3>

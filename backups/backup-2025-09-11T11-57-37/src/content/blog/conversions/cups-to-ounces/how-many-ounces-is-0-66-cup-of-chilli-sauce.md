faqQ1: "Can I use a UK measuring cup for 0.66 cup of chilli sauce?"
faqA1: "Yes, UK and US cup measurements are the same for liquid ingredients like chilli sauce. Just ensure you’re using a standard metric cup (240ml) and not a teacup. For precision, weighing out 5.28 ounces is even better."
faqQ2: "How do I adjust the recipe if I only have a 1-cup measure?"
faqA2: "Fill your 1-cup measure two-thirds full to approximate 0.66 cup. Alternatively, use 1/3 cup twice. For exact results, weigh 5.28 ounces on a kitchen scale. This method eliminates guesswork in air fryer cooking."
faqQ3: "Does the type of chilli sauce affect the ounce conversion?"
faqA3: "Thicker sauces may weigh slightly more, but the difference is minimal for most recipes. Stick to the 5.28-ounce conversion unless your sauce is extremely dense. Always taste and adjust seasonings as needed."
faqQ4: "Can I freeze 0.66 cup portions of chilli sauce for later use?"
faqA4: "Absolutely! Freezing 5.28-ounce portions in airtight containers works well. Thaw in the fridge before using in your air fryer. This is great for meal prep or saving leftover sauce from larger bottles."

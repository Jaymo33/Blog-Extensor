faqQ1: "Can I use golden syrup instead of treacle in my air fryer recipes?"
faqA1: "Yes, you can substitute golden syrup for treacle, but the flavour will be lighter. Golden syrup is less intense, so adjust sweetness accordingly. It works well in most recipes, but treacle’s robust taste is hard to replicate."
faqQ2: "How do I store leftover treacle?"
faqA2: "Store treacle in an airtight container at room temperature. It has a long shelf life due to its high sugar content. Keep it away from moisture to prevent crystallization. A cool, dark cupboard is ideal."
faqQ3: "Why is my treacle measurement not exact?"
faqA3: "Treacle’s thickness can cause slight variations in volume measurements. For precision, weigh it using a kitchen scale. Temperature also affects its viscosity, so measure at room temperature for consistency."
faqQ4: "Can I freeze treacle for later use?"
faqA4: "Freezing treacle isn’t recommended as it can alter its texture. It stores well at room temperature for months. If you must freeze it, thaw it slowly and stir well before use to restore consistency."

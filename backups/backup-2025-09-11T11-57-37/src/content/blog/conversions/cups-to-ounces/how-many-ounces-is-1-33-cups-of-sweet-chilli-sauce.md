faqQ1: "Can I use the same conversion for other thick sauces?"
faqA1: "While 1.33 cups generally equals 10.64 ounces for sweet chilli sauce, thicker sauces like hoisin or barbecue may vary slightly in weight. Always check specific product densities or weigh your sauce for critical recipes, especially when air frying delicate items that require precise sauce quantities."
faqQ2: "How does altitude affect sweet chilli sauce measurements in air fryers?"
faqA2: "At higher altitudes, sweet chilli sauce may thicken slightly due to faster evaporation, potentially affecting the 1.33 cups to ounces ratio.

faqQ4: "Can I freeze leftover sweet chilli sauce after measuring 1.33 cups?"
faqA4: "Absolutely! The 10.64-ounce portion freezes well in airtight containers for up to 3 months. Thaw overnight in the fridge before using in air fryer recipes. For best results, stir well after thawing as separation may occur - this won't affect the measured quantity or cooking performance."

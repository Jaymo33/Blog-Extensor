faqQ1: "Can I use tablespoons to measure 0.375 cup of cocoa powder?"
faqA1: "Yes, 0.375 cup equals 6 tablespoons of cocoa powder, or roughly 1.5 oz. However, for air fryer recipes, weighing it (1.5 oz) is more precise. Tablespoons can vary slightly in density, affecting your bake."
faqQ2: "Does cocoa powder type affect the 0.375 cup to ounce conversion?"
faqA2: "Dutch-process and natural cocoa powders have similar weights, so 0.375 cup is still ~1.5 oz. However, Dutch-process is often finer, so avoid packing it down. Always fluff the powder before measuring for accuracy."
faqQ3: "How do I adjust air fryer recipes if I only have ounces listed?"
faqA3: "If a recipe lists cocoa powder in ounces (e.g., 1.5 oz), use 0.375 cup as your measure. Air fryers benefit from weight-based measurements, so invest in a small scale for best results."
faqQ4: "Why does my air fryer bake taste bitter with 0.375 cup cocoa powder?"
faqA4: "Bitterness may mean your 0.375 cup (1.5 oz) was over-measured or packed. Always spoon lightly into the cup and level it off. Also, check expiry dates—old cocoa powder can develop a harsh taste."

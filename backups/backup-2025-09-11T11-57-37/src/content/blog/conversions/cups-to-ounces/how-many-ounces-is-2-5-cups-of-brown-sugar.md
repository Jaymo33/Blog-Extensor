<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of brown sugar can make or break your air fryer recipe. Too much sugar can cause burning, while too little may leave your dish lacking flavour. Air fryers cook food quickly, so precision is key to avoid mishaps.

For sticky ingredients like brown sugar, a scale is even more reliable.</p>

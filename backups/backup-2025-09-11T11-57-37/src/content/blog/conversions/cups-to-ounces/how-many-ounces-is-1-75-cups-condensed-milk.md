faqQ1: "Can I use evaporated milk instead of condensed milk in air fryer recipes?"
faqA1: "No, evaporated milk and condensed milk aren’t interchangeable. Condensed milk is sweetened, while evaporated milk is unsweetened and thinner. Substituting one for the other will alter the taste and texture of your dish."
faqQ2: "How do I store leftover condensed milk after measuring?"
faqA2: "Transfer any unused condensed milk to an airtight container and refrigerate it. It’ll keep for up to two weeks. For longer storage, freeze it in portions—thaw in the fridge before using."
faqQ3: "Why does my air fryer dessert taste too sweet with condensed milk?"
faqA3: "Condensed milk is very sweet, so reduce added sugar in your recipe. If it’s still too sweet, balance it with a pinch of salt or a splash of citrus juice to cut through the richness."
faqQ4: "Can I make my own condensed milk for air fryer recipes?"
faqA4: "Yes! Simmer milk and sugar until reduced by half. Homemade condensed milk works well but may be slightly thinner than canned versions. Adjust cooking times accordingly in your air fryer."

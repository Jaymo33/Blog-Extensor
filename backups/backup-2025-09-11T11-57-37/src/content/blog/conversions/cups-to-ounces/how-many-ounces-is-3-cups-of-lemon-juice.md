faqQ1: "Can I use bottled lemon juice instead of fresh for air fryer recipes?"
faqA1: "Yes, bottled lemon juice works fine in air fryer recipes, though fresh lemon juice often has a brighter flavour. If using bottled, check for added preservatives or sweeteners, which might alter the taste. For marinades or glazes, either option will work."
faqQ2: "How many lemons do I need to make 3 cups (24 oz) of juice?"
faqA2: "You’ll need about 12–15 medium-sized lemons to yield 3 cups (24 oz) of juice. Roll the lemons on a countertop before juicing to maximise extraction. A citrus juicer can also help streamline the process."
faqQ3: "Does lemon juice affect air fryer cooking times?"
faqA3: "Lemon juice itself doesn’t significantly alter cooking times, but excess liquid can create steam, potentially affecting crispiness. Pat proteins or vegetables dry before air frying, and use marinades sparingly for best results."
faqQ4: "Can I freeze leftover lemon juice for later use?"
faqA4: "Absolutely! Freeze lemon juice in ice cube trays for easy portioning. Each cube holds about 1 ounce, so 24 cubes equal 3 cups. Thaw as needed for future air fryer recipes or dressings."

If you’re scaling a recipe up or down, converting 3 cups of lemon juice to ounces ensures you maintain the right ratios. This is especially useful for meal prep or batch cooking, where consistency is crucial.</p>

The acidity also helps tenderise proteins, making it ideal for air fryer cooking. Just remember to pat ingredients dry before air frying to avoid excess moisture.</p>  

<h3>Tips for Measuring Lemon Juice Accurately</h3>  
<p>For precise measurements, use a liquid measuring cup rather than dry cups. Fill it to the 3-cup mark at eye level to avoid over- or under-pouring.

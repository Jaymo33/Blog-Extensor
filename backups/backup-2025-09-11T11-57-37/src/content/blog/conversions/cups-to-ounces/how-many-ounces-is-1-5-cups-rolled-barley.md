faqQ1: "Can I use pearl barley instead of rolled barley in my air fryer?"
faqA1: "Yes, but pearl barley takes longer to cook than rolled barley. Adjust your cooking time by about 10-15 minutes and check for doneness. The texture will be slightly chewier than rolled barley."
faqQ2: "How do I know if my 1.5 cups of rolled barley measurement is accurate?"
faqA2: "The most accurate way is to use a kitchen scale - 1.5 cups should weigh about 6 ounces. If using measuring cups, fluff the barley first and level it off. Packed barley will weigh more than the standard measurement."
faqQ3: "Can I toast 1.5 cups of rolled barley in the air fryer?"
faqA3: "Absolutely! Spread the barley evenly in the air fryer basket and cook at 160°C for 5-7 minutes, shaking occasionally. Toasted barley adds wonderful nutty flavour to salads and grain bowls."
faqQ4: "How long does cooked rolled barley last in the fridge?"
faqA4: "Cooked rolled barley keeps well for 3-4 days in an airtight container. You can reheat portions in the air fryer at 160°C for 3-4 minutes. Add a splash of water if it seems dry before reheating."

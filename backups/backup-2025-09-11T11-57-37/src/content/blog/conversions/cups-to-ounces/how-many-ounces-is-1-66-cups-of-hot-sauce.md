faqQ1: "Can I use 1.66 cups of hot sauce for marinating chicken in the air fryer?"
faqA1: "Absolutely! 1.66 cups of hot sauce (13.28 ounces) is a great amount for marinating a whole chicken or several pounds of chicken pieces. Just be sure to pat the chicken dry before air frying to ensure crispy skin. For best results, marinate for at least 2 hours or overnight."
faqQ2: "How does the thickness of hot sauce affect the 1.66 cups to ounces conversion?"
faqA2: "While most standard hot sauces will convert at 8 ounces per cup (so 1.66 cups = 13.28 ounces), thicker sauces like sriracha might weigh slightly more. If precision is crucial, it's always best to weigh your hot sauce rather than relying solely on volume measurements."
faqQ3: "What's the best way to measure 1.66 cups of hot sauce without a measuring cup?"
faqA3: "If you don't have a measuring cup, you can use a kitchen scale to weigh out 13.28 ounces directly. Alternatively, you can estimate using common household items - 1.66 cups is roughly equivalent to a standard soup can (about 400ml) filled about three-quarters full."
faqQ4: "Can I substitute 1.66 cups of hot sauce with another spicy ingredient in air fryer recipes?"
faqA4: "You can substitute with other spicy ingredients, but the flavor profile will change.

Start with smaller amounts and adjust to taste, as powdered spices are more concentrated."

<h2>Tips for working with hot sauce in the air fryer</h2>
<p>Hot sauce can be sticky and messy, so it's important to clean your air fryer basket promptly after use. A quick wipe with a damp cloth or a run through the dishwasher (if your basket is dishwasher-safe) will do the trick. For tougher stains, try our recommended <a href="https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner">air fryer cleaner</a>.</p>
<p>When using hot sauce in the air fryer, consider tossing your ingredients in the sauce after cooking to prevent burning. Alternatively, you can brush the sauce on during the last few minutes of cooking for a caramelized finish. This technique works great for wings, ribs, or even tofu.</p>

<h3>Storing leftover hot sauce</h3>
<p>If you have leftover hot sauce from your 1.66-cup measurement, store it in an airtight container in the fridge. Most hot sauces will keep for several months, but always check for signs of spoilage like mold or off smells. You can also freeze hot sauce in ice cube trays for easy portioning later.</p>

<h3>Adjusting spice levels</h3>
<p>If 1.66 cups of hot sauce (13.28 ounces) seems too spicy for your taste, you can dilute it with a bit of melted butter or oil. This will mellow the heat while still giving you that classic hot sauce flavor. For a creamier result, mix in some mayonnaise or yogurt.</p>

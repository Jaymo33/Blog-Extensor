faqQ1: "Does the type of mustard affect the ounce measurement for 1.5 cups?"
faqA1: "Yes, slightly. Dijon and yellow mustard have similar densities, so 1.5 cups will still be around 12 ounces. Grain mustard, however, may vary due to its chunkier texture. For precise air fryer recipes, stick to smooth varieties unless the recipe specifies otherwise."
faqQ2: "Can I use a kitchen scale to measure 1.5 cups of mustard in ounces?"
faqA2: "Absolutely! A kitchen scale is the most accurate way to measure mustard. Simply set your scale to ounces, tare the container, and spoon in mustard until it reaches 12 ounces. This method eliminates any guesswork with cup measurements."
faqQ3: "How does UK mustard compare to US mustard in ounce measurements?"
faqA3: "UK mustard, like Colman’s, is often stronger but has a similar density to US mustard. This means 1.5 cups will still convert to roughly 12 ounces. However, always check the recipe’s origin, as UK fluid ounces can differ slightly from US weight ounces."
faqQ4: "What’s the best way to store leftover mustard after measuring 1.5 cups?"
faqA4: "Store mustard in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 2 months. If you’ve used 1.5 cups (12 ounces) from a larger jar, ensure the lid is sealed tightly to preserve freshness. Mustard may thicken over time—just stir in a splash of water if needed."

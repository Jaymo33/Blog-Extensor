faqQ1: "Can I use whole milk instead of semi skimmed milk in this conversion?"
faqA1: "Yes, you can use whole milk instead of semi skimmed milk, but the weight may vary slightly. Whole milk is denser, so 1.75 cups would be around 15 ounces. Adjustments might be needed depending on the recipe."
faqQ2: "How do I measure 1.75 cups of semi skimmed milk without a measuring cup?"
faqA2: "If you don’t have a measuring cup, you can use a kitchen scale to weigh out 14.79 ounces of semi skimmed milk. Alternatively, use a standard mug (about 8-10 oz) and fill it roughly 1.75 times, though this method is less precise."
faqQ3: "Why is weight more accurate than volume for measuring milk?"
faqA3: "Weight is more accurate because volume measurements can be affected by factors like temperature and how the milk is poured. A kitchen scale eliminates these variables, ensuring consistent results in your air fryer recipes."
faqQ4: "Can I use this conversion for other types of milk, like almond or soy milk?"
faqA4: "Almond or soy milk may have different densities, so the conversion might not be exact. For example, 1.75 cups of almond milk is roughly 14 ounces. Always check the specific type of milk for accurate measurements."

faqQ1: "Can I use double cream instead of whipping cream in air fryer recipes?"

faqQ2: "How do I measure 1 cup of whipping cream without a scale?"
faqA2: "Use a liquid measuring cup for the most accurate results. Fill it to the 1-cup mark, ensuring the cream is level at the top. Remember that 1 cup equals roughly 8.11 ounces in UK measurements."
faqQ3: "Does whipping cream weight change if it's whipped?"

faqQ4: "What's the best way to store leftover whipping cream?"
faqA4: "Store leftover whipping cream in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 3 days. If you've whipped it, it may separate slightly, but it's still usable in cooked dishes like air fryer sauces or soups."

faqQ1: "Can I use fresh pineapple juice instead of canned for 0.5 cup measurements?"
faqA1: "Yes, fresh pineapple juice works just as well as canned for measuring 0.5 cup (4 oz). However, fresh juice may have a stronger flavour, so adjust other seasonings accordingly. Strain it to remove pulp if a smoother consistency is needed for your air fryer recipe."
faqQ2: "Does 0.5 cup of pineapple juice weigh the same as 0.5 cup of water?"
faqA2: "No, pineapple juice is slightly denser than water due to its sugar content. While 0.5 cup of water weighs about 4 oz, pineapple juice may be marginally heavier. For most air fryer recipes, the small difference won’t affect results significantly."
faqQ3: "How can I measure 0.5 cup of pineapple juice without a measuring cup?"
faqA3: "If you don’t have a measuring cup, use a standard drinking glass marked at the halfway point for 0.5 cup (4 oz). Alternatively, 8 level tablespoons equal 0.5 cup. For the most accuracy, especially in air fryer cooking, investing in proper measuring tools is best."
faqQ4: "Can I substitute another fruit juice for 0.5 cup of pineapple juice in recipes?"
faqA4: "Orange or apple juice can work as substitutes for 0.5 cup of pineapple juice, but the flavour profile will change. Adjust sweetness or acidity as needed. For air fryer marinades, pineapple juice’s tenderising enzymes make it unique, so substitutions may alter texture slightly."

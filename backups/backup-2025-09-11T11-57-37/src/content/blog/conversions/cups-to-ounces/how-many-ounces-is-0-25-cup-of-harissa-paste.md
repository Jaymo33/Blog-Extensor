faqQ1: "Can I use harissa powder instead of paste in my air fryer recipes?"
faqA1: "Yes, you can substitute harissa powder for paste, but the measurements differ significantly. For 0.25 cup (2 ounces) of harissa paste, use about 2 tablespoons of harissa powder mixed with 1-2 tablespoons of oil or water. The powder might be more concentrated, so adjust to taste and watch for drying in the air fryer."
faqQ2: "How does harissa paste affect cooking times in the air fryer?"
faqA2: "Harissa paste doesn't significantly change air fryer cooking times, but its sugar content can cause faster browning. When using 0.25 cup (2 ounces) in marinades, monitor your food closely during the last few minutes. The paste's oil content may also produce more smoke at high temperatures, so consider reducing heat slightly."
faqQ3: "Is 0.25 cup of harissa paste very spicy for air fryer cooking?"
faqA3: "0.25 cup (2 ounces) of harissa paste provides moderate to strong heat for most air fryer recipes. The spiciness varies by brand, so taste a small amount first. For milder dishes, mix the 2 ounces of harissa with yogurt, lemon juice, or tomato paste to temper the heat while maintaining flavour."
faqQ4: "Can I freeze leftover harissa paste after measuring out 0.25 cup portions?"
faqA4: "Absolutely! Freezing harissa paste in 0.25 cup (2 ounce) portions works perfectly. Use ice cube trays or small containers, leaving some headspace for expansion. Frozen harissa keeps for 3-4 months and thaws quickly at room temperature, ready for your next air fryer adventure."

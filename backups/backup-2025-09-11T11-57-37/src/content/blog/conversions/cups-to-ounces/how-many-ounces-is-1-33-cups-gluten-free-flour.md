faqQ1: "Can I use a regular measuring cup for gluten-free flour?"
faqA1: "Yes, but for the most accurate results, use the spoon-and-level method. Spoon the flour into the cup and level it off with a knife. This prevents over-packing, which can lead to incorrect measurements. For best results, a kitchen scale is recommended."
faqQ2: "Why does gluten-free flour weigh differently than regular flour?"
faqA2: "Gluten-free flour blends often contain denser ingredients like rice flour or almond flour, which weigh more than wheat flour. This means volume measurements (cups) can vary significantly, making weight measurements (ounces) more reliable for consistent results."
faqQ3: "How do I adjust cooking times for gluten-free recipes in an air fryer?"
faqA3: "Gluten-free baked goods may cook faster in an air fryer due to the concentrated heat. Start checking for doneness a few minutes earlier than the recipe suggests. Use a toothpick to test cakes or muffins—if it comes out clean, they’re done."
faqQ4: "Where can I find more gluten-free air fryer recipes?"
faqA4: "Explore our collection of <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>gluten-free air fryer recipes</a>, tailored for precise measurements and perfect results. From savoury dishes to sweet treats, we’ve got plenty of inspiration for your next air fryer adventure."

<p>1.33 cups of gluten-free flour equals approximately 5.6 ounces (oz). This conversion is crucial for air fryer baking, where precise measurements can make or break your recipe. Whether you’re making gluten-free cakes, cookies, or bread in your air fryer, knowing the exact weight ensures consistency and perfect texture every time.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Baking</h2>  
<p>Gluten-free flour behaves differently than regular flour, making precise measurements essential. Too much or too little can affect the texture and rise of your baked goods. For air fryer recipes, where cooking times are shorter and temperatures higher, accuracy is even more critical. A slight deviation in flour weight can lead to dry or dense results, so measuring by weight (ounces) is often more reliable than volume (cups).</p>

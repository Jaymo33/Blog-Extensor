faqQ1: "Can I use shredded coconut instead of desiccated in air fryer recipes?"
faqA1: "Yes, but shredded coconut has more moisture, so adjust cooking times slightly. It may also brown faster in the air fryer due to its texture. For best results, reduce the temperature by 5-10°C if substituting."
faqQ2: "How do I store desiccated coconut to keep it fresh for air fryer recipes?"
faqA2: "Store it in an airtight container in a cool, dark place. For longer shelf life, refrigerate or freeze it. Always check for rancidity before use—fresh coconut should smell sweet, not sour."
faqQ3: "Why does my air-fried coconut topping burn so quickly?"
faqA3: "Coconut browns fast due to its sugar content. To prevent burning, add it halfway through cooking or cover the dish with foil initially. Lowering the temperature by 10°C also helps."
faqQ4: "Can I toast desiccated coconut in the air fryer?"
faqA4: "Absolutely! Spread it in a thin layer and air fry at 150°C for 2-3 minutes, shaking halfway. Watch closely—it toasts quickly. Use toasted coconut for garnishing desserts or savoury dishes."

<h3>How to Measure Desiccated Coconut Without a Scale</h3>

faqQ1: "Can I use beef broth instead of beef stock in air fryer recipes?"
faqA1: "Yes, you can use beef broth as a substitute for beef stock in most air fryer recipes. Both add rich flavour, but broth is typically saltier, so adjust seasonings accordingly. Stock is made from bones, giving it a deeper taste, while broth is made from meat."
faqQ2: "How do I convert 1 cup of beef stock to grams?"
faqA2: "1 cup of beef stock weighs approximately 240 grams. If you’re using a kitchen scale, this conversion helps for recipes requiring metric measurements. Remember, 8.45 ounces is the equivalent in weight for 1 cup of beef stock."
faqQ3: "Why does my air fryer recipe taste bland even with beef stock?"
faqA3: "If your dish tastes bland, you might need to reduce the beef stock to concentrate the flavour or add more seasonings. Also, ensure you’re using high-quality stock. Too much liquid can dilute flavours, so stick to the 1 cup (8.45 oz) measurement."
faqQ4: "Can I make my own beef stock for air fryer recipes?"
faqA4: "Absolutely! Homemade beef stock is easy to make by simmering beef bones, vegetables, and herbs for several hours. It’s richer than store-bought versions and lets you control the salt content. Just measure 1 cup as 8.45 ounces for accurate use in recipes."

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on precise ingredient ratios to deliver crispy, evenly cooked meals. Too much or too little liquid, like beef stock, can affect texture and flavour.

<h2>How to Measure Beef Stock Correctly</h2>  
<p>Measuring liquids like beef stock can be tricky if you don’t have the right tools. A liquid measuring cup is the most accurate way to measure 1 cup of beef stock. Fill it to the 1-cup mark, then check the weight if you have a kitchen scale. Remember, 1 cup equals 8.45 ounces, but slight variations can occur depending on the stock’s density.</p>  

<h3>Using a Kitchen Scale for Precision</h3>

<h2>Common Uses for Beef Stock in Air Fryer Recipes</h2>  
<p>Beef stock is a staple in many air fryer dishes. It’s perfect for deglazing pans, creating rich sauces, or adding moisture to meats. For example, try brushing beef stock on roast potatoes for extra flavour. You can also use it to baste meats like steak or chicken for a juicier result. The key is to measure correctly—1 cup of beef stock to ounces (8.45 oz) ensures balanced flavours.</p>  

<p>Another great use for beef stock is in marinades. Combine it with herbs and spices, then let your meat soak for a few hours before air frying.

faqQ1: "Can I use minced garlic instead of crushed garlic for 0.5 cup measurements?"
faqA1: "Yes, but note that minced garlic is slightly denser than crushed. 0.5 cup of minced garlic weighs about 2.8 ounces, compared to 2.5 ounces for crushed. Adjust other liquid ingredients in your air fryer recipe if swapping between the two for consistent texture."
faqQ2: "How long does 0.5 cup of crushed garlic last in the fridge?"
faqA2: "When stored properly in an airtight container, 0.5 cup of crushed garlic stays fresh for up to 7 days in the fridge. For longer storage, freeze it in portions—thawed garlic works perfectly in cooked air fryer dishes like roasted vegetables or meats."
faqQ3: "Is 0.5 cup of crushed garlic too much for one air fryer meal?"
faqA3: "It depends on the recipe and serving size. 0.5 cup (2.5 ounces) is ideal for 4–6 portions of dishes like garlic bread or marinades. For smaller batches or milder flavours, reduce the amount by half and adjust other seasonings accordingly."
faqQ4: "Why does my air fryer recipe taste bitter with 0.5 cup crushed garlic?"
faqA4: "Overcooking garlic can cause bitterness. If using 0.5 cup in marinades, add it toward the end of cooking time. For dry rubs, mix garlic with oil to prevent burning. Always preheat your air fryer to ensure even cooking and avoid hot spots that scorch garlic."

<p>0.5 cup of crushed garlic equals approximately 2.5 ounces (70 grams). This measurement is essential for air fryer recipes, where precise ingredient quantities can make or break a dish. Whether you’re whipping up a garlic-infused marinade or seasoning meats, knowing the exact weight ensures consistent flavour and texture.

<h2>Why accurate garlic measurements matter</h2>  
<p>Garlic is a powerhouse ingredient in many air fryer dishes, from roasted vegetables to crispy chicken. Too little, and your dish might lack depth; too much, and it can overpower other flavours. Measuring 0.5 cup of crushed garlic correctly (2.5 ounces) ensures balanced taste every time. If you love garlic-heavy recipes, browse our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>garlic chicken recipes</a> for inspiration.</p>  

<p>Crushed garlic also varies in density compared to minced or whole cloves, so volume-to-weight conversions are crucial. A packed 0.5 cup will weigh slightly more than a loosely filled one. For consistent results, lightly pack the garlic without compressing it too tightly. This method works perfectly for air fryer sauces and rubs.</p>  

<h3>Tools for measuring crushed garlic</h3>  
<p>While measuring cups are handy, a kitchen scale is the most accurate tool for converting 0.5 cup of crushed garlic to ounces. Digital scales eliminate guesswork, especially when scaling recipes up or down. If you don’t have one, use the spoon-and-level method: spoon crushed garlic into a measuring cup and level it off with a knife.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for 0.5 cup crushed garlic</h2>  
<p>This quantity is ideal for batch cooking or meal prep. For example, 0.5 cup (2.5 ounces) of crushed garlic can season a whole tray of air-fryer potatoes or marinate several chicken breasts. It’s also perfect for garlic butter sauces or dips. Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipe collection</a> for creative ways to use this amount.</p>  

<p>If you’re prepping frozen foods like garlic bread or shrimp, 0.5 cup of crushed garlic adds robust flavour without overwhelming the dish. Just remember to adjust cooking times slightly when adding wet ingredients like garlic to avoid sogginess.

<h3>Storing leftover crushed garlic</h3>  
<p>If you’ve measured 0.5 cup but only need half, store the rest properly to maintain freshness. Transfer it to an airtight container, cover with olive oil, and refrigerate for up to a week. Alternatively, freeze portions in ice cube trays for future air fryer recipes. Always label containers with dates to track freshness.</p>  

<h2>Adjusting recipes with 0.5 cup crushed garlic</h2>  
<p>When a recipe calls for whole cloves but you’re using pre-crushed garlic, remember that one medium clove equals about 0.5 teaspoon crushed. So 0.5 cup (2.5 ounces) roughly equals 24 cloves—useful for scaling family-sized meals. For dishes like garlic mushrooms or tofu, this conversion ensures flavour accuracy.</p>  

<p>If you’re doubling a recipe that uses 0.5 cup crushed garlic, note that garlic’s intensity doesn’t always scale linearly. Taste as you go, especially with delicate proteins like fish or turkey. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/turkey>turkey recipes</a> offer guidance on balancing strong flavours like garlic.</p>  

<h3>Cleaning garlic residue from your air fryer</h3>  
<p>After cooking with 0.5 cup of crushed garlic, your air fryer might retain strong odours. Wipe the basket with a damp cloth and use our recommended <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner</a> to eliminate lingering smells. For stubborn residue, a baking soda paste works wonders without harsh chemicals.</p>

faqQ1: "Does the weight of chopped spinach change if it's packed tightly?"
faqA1: "Yes, tightly packed chopped spinach will weigh more than loosely packed. For accurate measurements, it's best to lightly pack the spinach when measuring by volume or use a kitchen scale for precise weight. In air fryer recipes, consistency in packing helps ensure even cooking."
faqQ2: "Can I use frozen spinach instead of fresh for air fryer recipes?"
faqA2: "You can use frozen spinach, but remember to thaw and drain it thoroughly first. Frozen spinach is more compact, so you'll need about 10 ounces frozen to equal 1.25 cups chopped fresh spinach after cooking. Always squeeze out excess moisture to prevent steaming in the air fryer."
faqQ3: "How does spinach behave differently in an air fryer compared to oven cooking?"
faqA3: "In an air fryer, spinach cooks much faster and can crisp up beautifully when prepared correctly. The concentrated hot air circulation creates a different texture than oven baking. For 1.25 cups (2.5 ounces) of chopped spinach, reduce cooking time by about half compared to conventional oven methods."
faqQ4: "What's the best way to store leftover chopped spinach for air fryer use?"
faqA4: "Store leftover chopped spinach in an airtight container with a paper towel to absorb moisture. It will keep for 2-3 days in the refrigerator. When ready to use, pat dry if needed before air frying. For longer storage, blanch and freeze the spinach in measured portions."

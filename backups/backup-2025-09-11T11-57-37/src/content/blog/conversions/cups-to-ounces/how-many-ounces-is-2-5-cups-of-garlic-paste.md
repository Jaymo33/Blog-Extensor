faqQ1: "Can I use minced garlic instead of garlic paste in my air fryer recipes?"
faqA1: "Yes, you can substitute minced garlic for garlic paste, but the measurements will differ. Minced garlic is less dense, so you’ll need about 1.5 times the volume to match the flavour intensity of paste. Adjust seasonings to taste for the best results."
faqQ2: "How long does garlic paste last in the fridge?"
faqA2: "Garlic paste typically lasts 2-3 weeks in the fridge if stored in an airtight container. For longer storage, freeze it in small portions. Always check for off smells or mould before using."
faqQ3: "Why is my garlic paste turning green in the air fryer?"
faqA3: "Garlic can turn green due to a natural chemical reaction when exposed to heat or acidic ingredients. It’s safe to eat but may look unusual. To prevent this, mix the paste with oil before cooking."
faqQ4: "Can I make garlic paste at home for air fryer recipes?"
faqA4: "Absolutely! Blend peeled garlic cloves with a bit of oil or water until smooth. Homemade paste is fresher and free of preservatives. Store it in the fridge or freezer for future use."

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on even cooking, and incorrect measurements can lead to uneven results. Too much garlic paste might overpower a dish, while too little could leave it bland. Using 20 ounces for 2.5 cups ensures your recipes turn out perfectly every time. This is especially important for dishes like garlic butter shrimp or roasted vegetables, where flavour balance is crucial. Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipes</a> section for inspiration on using garlic paste in your air fryer.</p>  

<p>Garlic paste is denser than liquids like water, so volume-to-weight conversions aren’t always straightforward. A standard cup of garlic paste weighs around 8 ounces, making 2.5 cups equal to 20 ounces. This measurement is consistent across most brands, but checking the label for specific weights is always a good idea.

<h3>How to Measure Garlic Paste for Air Fryer Recipes</h3>  
<p>Using a kitchen scale is the most accurate way to measure garlic paste. Simply tare your scale with an empty container, then add the paste until it reaches 20 ounces. If you don’t have a scale, spoon the paste into a measuring cup, ensuring it’s level for accuracy. Avoid packing the paste down, as this can lead to over-measuring.

<h3>Adjusting Recipes for Different Garlic Paste Brands</h3>  
<p>Not all garlic pastes have the same consistency, so adjustments may be needed. Thicker pastes might require slightly less volume to reach 20 ounces, while thinner ones could need more. Always taste and adjust seasonings as you cook to ensure the perfect balance. Experimenting with small batches is a great way to find what works best for your air fryer recipes.</p>

faqQ1: "Can I use a UK measuring cup for 3 cups of rolled barley to ounces?"
faqA1: "Yes, UK and US measuring cups are nearly identical in volume for dry ingredients like rolled barley. 3 cups will still equate to roughly 24 ounces (680 grams). For absolute precision, a kitchen scale is best."
faqQ2: "Does the weight of rolled barley change if it’s packed tightly in the cup?"

faqQ3: "How do I store leftover rolled barley after measuring 3 cups?"
faqA3: "Store unused rolled barley in an airtight container in a cool, dry place. It stays fresh for up to 6 months. For longer storage, keep it in the freezer, where it’ll last up to a year without losing quality."
faqQ4: "Can I substitute rolled barley with another grain in air fryer recipes?"
faqA4: "Yes, steel-cut oats or quinoa work well as substitutes, but adjust cooking times as they may cook faster or slower. Check our conversion chart for precise measurements to ensure your dish’s texture stays on point."

faqQ1: "Can I use 0.66 cup of wholemeal flour interchangeably with white flour in air fryer recipes?"
faqA1: "While you can substitute 0.66 cup of wholemeal flour for white flour, adjustments are needed. Wholemeal flour absorbs more liquid and has a denser texture. For air fryer recipes, add a bit more moisture (like milk or oil) to compensate. Expect a nuttier flavour and slightly heavier result."
faqQ2: "How do I measure 0.66 cup of wholemeal flour without a scale?"
faqA2: "Use the spoon-and-level method: gently spoon flour into a measuring cup until slightly heaped, then level off with a knife. For 0.66 cup, fill a 1/3 cup measure twice. Avoid packing or tapping the cup, as this compacts the flour and leads to over-measuring."
faqQ3: "Does 0.66 cup of wholemeal flour weigh the same in UK and US measurements?"
faqA3: "Yes, 0.66 cup of wholemeal flour is approximately 2.64 oz in both UK and US measurements. However, UK cups are slightly larger (284ml vs. 240ml), but the weight per cup of wholemeal flour remains consistent. Always check your recipe’s origin to be safe."
faqQ4: "What’s the best way to store leftover wholemeal flour after measuring 0.66 cup?"
faqA4: "Transfer remaining wholemeal flour to an airtight container and store in a cool, dark place. Wholemeal flour spoils faster due to its higher oil content. For long-term storage, keep it in the freezer. Use within 3 months for best results in air fryer baking."

<h2>Why accurate flour measurements matter</h2>  
<p>Measuring flour by weight (ounces) rather than volume (cups) is crucial for baking success. Wholemeal flour can settle or fluff up, leading to inconsistent cup measurements. In an air fryer, where heat distribution is rapid, precise ratios ensure even cooking. A slight variation in flour weight can affect texture, rise, and browning. For perfect air fryer cakes or cookies, always weigh your ingredients.</p>  

<p>Wholemeal flour is denser than white flour, so 0.66 cup (2.64 oz) packs more nutritional punch. If you’re adapting a recipe from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>our collection</a>, note that weights may differ slightly based on brand or grind. For best results, use a kitchen scale—especially for air fryer recipes, where precision is key.</p>  

<h3>How to measure 0.66 cup of wholemeal flour</h3>  
<p>Spoon wholemeal flour into a measuring cup and level it off with a knife for the most accurate 0.66 cup measurement. Avoid scooping directly from the bag, as this compacts the flour. For 2.64 oz, a digital scale is foolproof. If you’re scaling up, remember: 1 cup of wholemeal flour ≈ 4 oz, so 0.66 cup is roughly two-thirds of that.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for 0.66 cup wholemeal flour</h2>  
<p>This quantity is perfect for small-batch air fryer baking. Try it in wholemeal muffins, flatbreads, or coating for <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>air fryer chicken</a>.

<h3>Converting other flour amounts to ounces</h3>  
<p>If your recipe calls for a different quantity, here’s a quick reference: 1/4 cup ≈ 1 oz, 1/2 cup ≈ 2 oz, and 1 cup ≈ 4 oz. For irregular amounts like 0.66 cup, a scale eliminates guesswork. Keep our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner</a> handy—wholemeal flour can leave more residue than white flour.</p>  

<h2>Tips for baking with wholemeal flour in an air fryer</h2>  
<p>Wholemeal flour absorbs more liquid than white flour, so adjust wet ingredients slightly. For 0.66 cup (2.64 oz), add an extra tablespoon of liquid if the batter seems dry. Air fryers circulate hot air, which can dry out baked goods faster. Covering loosely with foil halfway through prevents over-browning.</p>  

<p>Store wholemeal flour in an airtight container to maintain freshness. Since 0.66 cup is a smaller amount, it’s easy to use up quickly.

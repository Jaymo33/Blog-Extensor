faqQ1: "Can I use 2.5 cups of skimmed milk in any air fryer recipe?"
faqA1: "Yes, 2.5 cups (20 oz) of skimmed milk works well in most air fryer recipes, from batters to sauces. Just ensure you adjust cooking times if the recipe originally uses a different milk type. Always check for consistency before cooking."
faqQ2: "Does skimmed milk weigh the same as whole milk in ounces?"
faqA2: "Skimmed and whole milk have nearly identical weights per cup (around 8 oz), but whole milk is slightly denser due to its fat content. For most recipes, the difference is negligible, but for precision baking, stick to the specified type."
faqQ3: "How do I measure 2.5 cups of skimmed milk without a measuring cup?"
faqA3: "If you don’t have a measuring cup, use a standard UK mug (about 10 oz) and fill it just under halfway for 2.5 cups (20 oz). Alternatively, weigh 600 grams on a kitchen scale for an exact equivalent."
faqQ4: "Can I substitute almond milk for skimmed milk in a 2.5-cup measurement?"
faqA4: "Yes, but almond milk is thinner, so your recipe might need slight adjustments. Use the same 20-ounce quantity, but consider adding a thickener like cornflour if the texture seems off. Always test a small batch first."

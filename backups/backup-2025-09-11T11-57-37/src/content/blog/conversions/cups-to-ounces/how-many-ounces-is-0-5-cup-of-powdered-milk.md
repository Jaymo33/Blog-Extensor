faqQ1: "Can I use liquid milk instead of powdered milk in air fryer recipes?"
faqA1: "Yes, you can substitute liquid milk for powdered milk, but adjustments are needed. Generally, 1 cup of liquid milk replaces ¼ cup of powdered milk mixed with 1 cup of water. Keep in mind that liquid milk adds more moisture, which may affect cooking times in the air fryer."
faqQ2: "How do I store powdered milk for long-term use?"
faqA2: "Powdered milk should be stored in an airtight container in a cool, dry place. For maximum freshness, keep it away from heat and humidity. Properly stored, it can last up to 18 months. Always check for clumping or off smells before use."
faqQ3: "Does powdered milk work well in air fryer baking?"
faqA3: "Absolutely! Powdered milk is great for air fryer baking because it blends smoothly into dry mixes and doesn’t add excess moisture. It’s perfect for cakes, cookies, and breads, giving them a rich, creamy texture without altering cooking times."
faqQ4: "Why is my powdered milk clumping in the air fryer?"
faqA4: "Clumping usually happens if the powdered milk isn’t fully dissolved or if there’s too much humidity. To prevent this, mix it thoroughly with other dry ingredients before adding liquids. If clumps form during cooking, gently break them apart with a fork."

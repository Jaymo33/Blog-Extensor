faqQ1: "Can I use bottled lime juice instead of fresh for air fryer recipes?"
faqA1: "Yes, bottled lime juice works in a pinch, but fresh lime juice offers brighter flavour. If using bottled, check for additives and adjust measurements slightly, as some brands are more concentrated. For best results in air fryer recipes, fresh is preferred."
faqQ2: "How do I convert 2 cups of lime juice to millilitres?"
faqA2: "2 cups of lime juice equals roughly 473 millilitres. This conversion is handy for recipes using metric measurements. Always use a liquid measuring cup or kitchen scale for accuracy, especially in air fryer cooking where precision matters."
faqQ3: "Does the weight of lime juice change if it’s strained or with pulp?"
faqA3: "Strained lime juice may weigh slightly less due to removed pulp, but the difference is minimal. For 2 cups (16 ounces), the variance is negligible in most air fryer recipes. If a recipe specifies strained juice, follow that for consistency."
faqQ4: "What’s the best way to juice limes for air fryer recipes?"
faqA4: "Roll limes firmly on a countertop before cutting to maximise juice yield. Use a citrus juicer or reamer for efficiency. For 2 cups (16 ounces), you’ll need about 12–16 medium limes, depending on their juiciness. Freshly squeezed juice elevates air fryer dishes."

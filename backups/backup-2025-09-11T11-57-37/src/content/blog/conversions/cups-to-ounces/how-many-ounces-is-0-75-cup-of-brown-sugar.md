faqQ1: "Can I use granulated sugar instead of brown sugar for 0.75 cup in air fryer recipes?"
faqA1: "While you can substitute granulated sugar, the texture and flavour will differ. Brown sugar adds moisture and a caramel-like taste. If swapping, reduce liquid slightly and expect a crisper result."
faqQ2: "Why does my air fryer recipe with 0.75 cup brown sugar turn out too sweet?"
faqA2: "Overpacking the measuring cup can add extra ounces, increasing sweetness. Always measure lightly or use a scale for 6 oz (170g). Also, check if your recipe accounts for brown sugar’s moisture."
faqQ3: "How do I store leftover brown sugar after measuring 0.75 cup?"
faqA3: "Keep it in an airtight container to prevent hardening. Adding a slice of bread or a terra cotta disc helps retain moisture. Avoid refrigeration, as it can dry out the sugar."
faqQ4: "Can I reduce the 0.75 cup brown sugar in air fryer recipes for health reasons?"
faqA4: "Yes, but expect texture changes. Brown sugar contributes to chewiness in baked goods. For a healthier option, try halving the sugar or using alternatives like mashed banana or applesauce."

faqQ1: "How do I measure 1.5 cups of maple syrup without a scale?"
faqA1: "Use a liquid measuring cup and fill it to the 1.5-cup mark. For sticky syrups, lightly coat the cup with oil to ensure easy pouring. If precision is critical, consider investing in a kitchen scale for accurate conversions."
faqQ2: "Can I use honey instead of maple syrup in the same quantity?"
faqA2: "Honey is denser than maple syrup, so 1.5 cups would weigh slightly more (about 13 ounces). Adjust other liquids in your recipe to balance the consistency. Always taste-test, as honey has a stronger flavour."
faqQ3: "Why does my air fryer recipe burn with maple syrup?"
faqA3: "Maple syrup caramelises quickly at high heat. Reduce the air fryer temperature by 10°C and cook for slightly longer. Alternatively, brush syrup in layers during cooking to prevent burning."
faqQ4: "Is 1.5 cups of maple syrup the same in US and UK measurements?"
faqA4: "Yes, 1.5 US cups equal 1.5 UK cups in volume. However, always check if the recipe specifies weight (ounces or grams), as this ensures accuracy regardless of regional cup sizes."

faqQ1: "Can I use golden syrup instead of treacle in air fryer recipes?"
faqA1: "Yes, golden syrup can substitute for treacle in most recipes, though it's slightly lighter in colour and flavour. Use the same 1.75 cups to 14 oz conversion, as their densities are similar. The texture of your baked goods may be marginally less dense with golden syrup."
faqQ2: "How do I prevent treacle from sticking to my air fryer basket?"
faqA2: "Lightly grease the basket with oil before adding treacle-heavy mixtures. For very sticky recipes like treacle tart, consider using parchment paper or silicone liners designed for air fryers. Always clean your air fryer promptly after use to prevent buildup."
faqQ3: "Why does my air fryer treacle pudding sometimes overflow?"
faqA3: "Overflowing usually means you've filled the container too full. With treacle mixtures, leave at least 2cm headspace as they expand during cooking. Also ensure your air fryer isn't overcrowded, as this affects air circulation and can cause uneven rising."
faqQ4: "Is black treacle the same as molasses in UK measurements?"
faqA4: "Black treacle is similar to molasses but slightly less bitter. They can generally be used interchangeably in recipes with the same 1.75 cups to 14 oz conversion. However, molasses may make baked goods darker and more intensely flavoured than treacle."

<p>1.75 cups of treacle equals approximately 14 fluid ounces (or 14 oz) in the UK. This conversion is essential for baking, especially when using an air fryer for desserts like sticky toffee pudding or treacle tart. Whether you're scaling a recipe or adjusting measurements, knowing the exact weight ensures perfect results every time.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Treacle Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of treacle is crucial for achieving the desired texture and sweetness in your baked goods. Too much can make desserts overly sticky, while too little may leave them dry. For air fryer recipes, precision is even more important due to the compact cooking space.

<p>Treacle, a thick syrup made during sugar refining, is denser than liquids like water or milk. This means volume-to-weight conversions aren't always straightforward. A standard UK cup holds 8 fluid ounces, but treacle's viscosity means 1.75 cups will weigh slightly more than you might expect. Always measure treacle by weight for the most accurate results.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure Treacle for Air Fryer Recipes</h3>  
<p>For best results, use a kitchen scale to weigh treacle directly in ounces. If you don't have one, lightly grease your measuring cup with oil to help the treacle slide out easily. This trick works wonders for sticky ingredients and ensures you get every last drop.

<h2>Common Treacle Conversions for UK Bakers</h2>  
<p>Beyond 1.75 cups, here are some other handy treacle conversions: 1 cup = 8 oz, 0.5 cup = 4 oz, and 2 cups = 16 oz. These measurements are especially useful when adapting traditional oven recipes for the air fryer. Remember that treacle measurements can vary slightly between brands, so always check the label if precision is key.</p>  

<p>If you're working with smaller quantities, note that 1 tablespoon of treacle equals about 0.5 oz. This comes in handy when making glazes or sauces in your air fryer.

<h3>Treacle in Popular Air Fryer Desserts</h3>  
<p>Treacle features in many classic British desserts that adapt beautifully to air frying. From treacle sponge pudding to parkin (a traditional gingerbread), this syrup adds moisture and depth of flavour. When converting these recipes, the 1.75 cups to 14 oz measurement ensures your treats bake evenly in the air fryer's concentrated heat.</p>  

<p>For those watching their sugar intake, you can slightly reduce the treacle in recipes by substituting with applesauce or mashed banana. Just remember this will affect both sweetness and texture.

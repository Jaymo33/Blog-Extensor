faqQ1: "Can I use golden syrup instead of molasses in a 0.66 cup measurement?"
faqA1: "Yes, you can substitute golden syrup for molasses in equal amounts (0.66 cup or 7.5 oz), but the flavour will be lighter and less robust. Golden syrup works well in air fryer recipes where you want a milder sweetness, like glazed carrots or flapjacks."
faqQ2: "Why does my air fryer recipe with molasses cook unevenly?"
faqA2: "Uneven cooking often occurs when molasses isn’t thoroughly mixed into batters or marinades. Ensure you whisk it properly before adding to your air fryer. Also, rotate your basket halfway through cooking for even heat distribution, especially with sticky molasses-based dishes."
faqQ3: "How do I clean molasses from my air fryer basket?"
faqA3: "For stubborn molasses residue, soak the basket in warm, soapy water for 15 minutes before scrubbing. Avoid abrasive pads that could damage the non-stick coating. For tough buildup, use our recommended <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner</a> solutions."
faqQ4: "Is black treacle the same as molasses for measuring 0.66 cup?"
faqA4: "Black treacle is very similar to molasses and can be used interchangeably in the same 0.66 cup (7.5 oz) quantity. It has a slightly stronger, more bitter flavour, which works well in rich air fryer dishes like sticky toffee pudding or barbecue sauces."

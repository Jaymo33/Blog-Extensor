faqQ1: "Can I use a kitchen scale to measure 1.66 cups of sweet chilli sauce in ounces?"
faqA1: "Yes, a kitchen scale is the most accurate way to measure 1.66 cups of sweet chilli sauce in ounces. Simply set your scale to ounces, tare the container, and pour the sauce until it reaches 13.28 oz. This method eliminates guesswork and ensures precision."
faqQ2: "How does sweet chilli sauce affect air fryer cooking times?"
faqA2: "Sweet chilli sauce can slightly increase cooking times due to its sugar content, which caramelises during air frying. If glazing, apply it in the last 5-10 minutes to prevent burning. For marinades, pat excess sauce off proteins to avoid uneven cooking."
faqQ3: "Is 1.66 cups of sweet chilli sauce the same in UK and US measurements?"
faqA3: "Yes, 1.66 cups converts to the same ounces (13.28 oz) in both UK and US measurements. However, always double-check your measuring tools, as cup sizes can vary slightly by brand. A kitchen scale ensures consistency regardless of location."
faqQ4: "What can I substitute for sweet chilli sauce in air fryer recipes?"
faqA4: "If you’re out of sweet chilli sauce, try a mix of honey and sriracha for a similar sweet-spicy flavour. Alternatively, hoisin sauce or barbecue sauce can work, though they’ll alter the taste. Adjust quantities to match the 13.28 oz (1.66 cups) measurement for best results."

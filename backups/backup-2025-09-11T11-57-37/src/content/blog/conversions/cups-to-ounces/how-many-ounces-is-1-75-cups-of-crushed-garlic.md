<p>1.75 cups of crushed garlic equals approximately 14 ounces. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements can make or break a dish. Whether you're preparing garlic-infused meats or roasted vegetables, knowing the exact weight ensures consistent flavour and texture. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we emphasise accuracy to help you achieve restaurant-quality results at home.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Garlic Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Garlic is a powerhouse ingredient that can transform any dish, but too much or too little can throw off the balance. In air fryer cooking, where heat distribution is rapid, precise measurements prevent overpowering flavours or underwhelming results. For example, 1.75 cups of crushed garlic to ounces ensures your marinades and rubs are spot-on. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> simplifies these calculations, so you never have to guess.</p>  

<p>Crushed garlic packs differently than minced or whole cloves, which is why volume-to-weight conversions are crucial. A packed cup will weigh more than a loosely filled one, so consistency is key. If you're prepping a batch of garlic-heavy dishes like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>garlic chicken</a>, this accuracy saves time and reduces waste.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure Crushed Garlic Correctly</h3>  
<p>To measure 1.75 cups of crushed garlic, use a dry measuring cup and lightly press the garlic to remove air pockets without compacting it too tightly. This method ensures you get the right amount—roughly 14 ounces—for your recipes. If you're scaling up or down, remember that 1 cup of crushed garlic equals about 8 ounces.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for 1.75 Cups of Crushed Garlic</h2>  
<p>This quantity is ideal for large-batch cooking, such as meal prepping or family dinners. From garlic butter shrimp to roasted potatoes, 1.75 cups of crushed garlic in ounces (14 oz) adds depth to your air fryer creations. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a> for inspiration on using this measurement effectively.</p>  

<p>Garlic's versatility shines in marinades, sauces, and rubs. For instance, a garlic-herb paste for lamb or a spicy garlic glaze for salmon benefits from precise measurements.

<h3>Converting Other Garlic Measurements</h3>

faqQ1: "Can I use a kitchen scale to measure 1.25 cups of miso soup?"
faqA1: "Yes, a kitchen scale works perfectly. Since 1.25 cups of miso soup equals 10 fl oz, you can weigh it instead. Just ensure your scale is set to fluid ounces for accuracy. This method is especially useful for thicker miso pastes."
faqQ2: "Does the type of miso soup affect the ounce measurement?"
faqA2: "The measurement stays the same (10 fl oz per 1.25 cups), but thicker miso pastes may need dilution. For clear broths, no adjustment is needed. Always stir well before measuring to ensure consistency."
faqQ3: "How do I convert 1.25 cups of miso soup to grams?"
faqA3: "Since miso soup’s density varies, fluid ounces are more reliable. However, 10 fl oz of standard miso broth weighs roughly 300 grams. For precise baking or marinating, stick to volume measurements."
faqQ4: "Can I freeze 1.25 cups of miso soup for later use?"
faqA4: "Absolutely! Portion 1.25 cups (10 fl oz) into airtight containers before freezing. Thaw in the fridge overnight or reheat directly in the air fryer. Avoid freezing miso soup with tofu, as it alters texture."

<h3>How to Measure Miso Soup Correctly</h3>  
<p>Use a liquid measuring cup for the most accurate results. Fill it to the 1.25-cup mark, ensuring the soup sits level at eye view. If you’re using a scale, 10 fl oz is your target.

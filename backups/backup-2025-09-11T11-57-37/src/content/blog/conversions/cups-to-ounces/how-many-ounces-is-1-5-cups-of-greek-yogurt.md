faqQ1: "Can I use regular yogurt instead of greek yogurt in air fryer recipes?"
faqA1: "Yes, you can substitute regular yogurt, but adjust the quantity slightly. Greek yogurt is thicker, so 1.5 cups (12 oz) may need reducing if using regular yogurt. Always check the consistency before cooking."
faqQ2: "How do I measure 1.5 cups of greek yogurt without a measuring cup?"
faqA2: "If you don’t have a measuring cup, use a kitchen scale to weigh 12 ounces of greek yogurt. Alternatively, a standard mug holds roughly 1 cup, so 1.5 cups would be one mug plus half."
faqQ3: "Why is greek yogurt preferred in air fryer recipes?"
faqA3: "Greek yogurt is thicker and creamier, making it ideal for marinades, dips, and baked goods. Its consistency helps coatings stick better and adds moisture without excess liquid, perfect for air frying."
faqQ4: "Does the brand of greek yogurt affect the ounce measurement?"
faqA4: "Most brands of greek yogurt have similar densities, so 1.5 cups should still equal around 12 ounces. However, always check for any variations in thickness, especially with low-fat or flavoured options."

faqQ1: "Can I use honey instead of agave syrup in my air fryer recipes?"
faqA1: "Yes, honey can substitute agave syrup, but adjust measurements slightly. Since honey is thicker, use about 0.7 cup (5.6 ounces) for every 0.75 cup of agave syrup. Reduce cooking time slightly to prevent over-browning."
faqQ2: "Does agave syrup burn easily in the air fryer?"
faqA2: "Agave syrup caramelises at high temperatures, so watch cooking times closely. For glazes, brush them on in the last 5 minutes to avoid burning. Lower temperatures (around 160°C) work best for syrupy coatings."
faqQ3: "How do I store leftover agave syrup after measuring 0.75 cup?"
faqA3: "Store opened agave syrup in a cool, dark place or the fridge. It lasts up to a year unopened and about 6 months once opened. Always use a clean spoon to prevent contamination."
faqQ4: "Is 0.75 cup of agave syrup the same weight as other liquids?"
faqA4: "No, agave syrup is denser than water. While 0.75 cup of water weighs 6 ounces, syrups vary. Always check specific conversions—agave’s weight matches its volume here, but this isn’t true for all liquids."

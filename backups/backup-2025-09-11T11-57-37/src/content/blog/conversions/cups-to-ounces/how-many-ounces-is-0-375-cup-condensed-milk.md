faqQ1: "Can I use evaporated milk instead of condensed milk for 0.375 cup measurements?"
faqA1: "No, evaporated milk and condensed milk are not interchangeable. Condensed milk is sweetened, while evaporated milk is unsweetened. Using evaporated milk will alter the taste and texture of your recipe. Stick to condensed milk unless the recipe specifies otherwise."
faqQ2: "How do I measure 0.375 cup of condensed milk without a measuring cup?"
faqA2: "If you don’t have a measuring cup, use a kitchen scale to weigh out 3 ounces (85 grams) of condensed milk. Alternatively, 0.375 cup is roughly 6 tablespoons, so you can measure it with a tablespoon measure for close accuracy."
faqQ3: "Why does my air fryer recipe require such a precise amount of condensed milk?"
faqA3: "Air fryers cook food quickly and evenly, so precise measurements prevent over-sweetening or uneven cooking. Too much condensed milk can cause dripping or burning, while too little might not provide enough moisture or flavour."
faqQ4: "Can I freeze leftover condensed milk after measuring 0.375 cup?"
faqA4: "Yes, you can freeze condensed milk in an airtight container for up to 3 months. Thaw it in the fridge before using it again. Stir well to restore its smooth consistency, as separation may occur during freezing."

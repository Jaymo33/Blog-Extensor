faqQ1: "Can I substitute rice flour for all-purpose flour in air fryer recipes?"
faqA1: "Yes, but keep in mind that rice flour is gluten-free, so it behaves differently. For coatings, it works well, but for baking, you may need to mix it with other gluten-free flours or add a binder like xanthan gum. Start with 0.33 cup (1.5 oz) and adjust as needed."
faqQ2: "Why does my rice flour coating turn out soggy in the air fryer?"
faqA2: "Sogginess can happen if the flour isn’t evenly distributed or if there’s too much moisture. Pat your ingredients dry before coating, and use a light spray of oil to help crispiness. Measuring 0.33 cup (1.5 oz) accurately ensures the right texture."
faqQ3: "How do I convert grams to ounces for rice flour in air fryer recipes?"
faqA3: "1 ounce is roughly 28 grams, so 0.33 cup (1.5 oz) of rice flour equals about 42 grams. A kitchen scale is the best tool for precise conversions, especially when working with gluten-free ingredients."
faqQ4: "Can I use rice flour to reheat fried food in the air fryer?"
faqA4: "Absolutely! Lightly dusting leftovers with rice flour before reheating helps restore crispiness. Use about 0.33 cup (1.5 oz) for a batch, and air fry at 180°C for 3-5 minutes. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>reheating tips</a> for best results."

<p>0.33 cup of rice flour equals approximately 1.5 ounces (oz). This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements ensure the best texture and consistency. Whether you’re baking gluten-free treats or coating ingredients for frying, knowing the exact weight of rice flour makes all the difference.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Using the correct amount of rice flour ensures your air fryer recipes turn out perfectly every time. Too much flour can make coatings clumpy, while too little might not provide enough crispiness. For example, if you’re making air-fried chicken or crispy tofu, 0.33 cup of rice flour (1.5 oz) is often the ideal amount for a light, even coating.</p>  

<p>Rice flour is a popular choice for gluten-free cooking, and its weight can vary slightly depending on how it’s packed. Scooping versus spooning the flour into the measuring cup can affect the final weight, so weighing it in ounces removes any guesswork.

<h3>How to Measure 0.33 Cup of Rice Flour Correctly</h3>  
<p>For the most accurate measurement, use a kitchen scale to weigh 1.5 oz of rice flour. If you don’t have one, lightly spoon the flour into a measuring cup and level it off with a knife. Avoid packing the flour down, as this can lead to using more than needed. This method ensures consistency, especially for delicate recipes like air fryer cookies or cakes.</p>

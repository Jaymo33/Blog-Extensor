faqQ1: "Can I use a kitchen scale to measure 0.25 cup of Nutella?"
faqA1: "Absolutely! A kitchen scale is the most accurate way to measure Nutella. Simply set your scale to ounces or grams, then measure out 2.1 ounces (60 grams) for 0.25 cup. This method eliminates guesswork and ensures consistency in your air fryer recipes."
faqQ2: "Why does 0.25 cup of Nutella weigh 2.1 ounces?"
faqA2: "Nutella’s density means it weighs slightly more than liquids like water. While 0.25 cup of water is 2 ounces, Nutella’s thicker consistency adds a bit of extra weight. This difference is why weight measurements (ounces/grams) are more reliable for baking and air frying."
faqQ3: "How do I measure Nutella without a scale?"
faqA3: "If you don’t have a scale, use the spoon-and-level method: gently spoon Nutella into a measuring cup without packing it down, then level off the top with a knife. Avoid scooping directly from the jar, as this compresses the spread and leads to inaccurate measurements."
faqQ4: "Can I substitute 0.25 cup of Nutella with another chocolate spread?"
faqA4: "Yes, but check the substitute’s consistency and sweetness. Some spreads are thinner or sweeter than Nutella, which could affect your recipe. For best results, stick to the same weight (2.1 ounces) rather than volume to maintain the intended texture and flavour."

faqQ1: "Does the type of orange juice affect the weight per cup?"
faqA1: "Yes, freshly squeezed orange juice may weigh slightly more due to pulp, while store-bought filtered juice is closer to the standard 8.45 ounces per cup. Always measure for accuracy, especially in air fryer recipes where consistency matters."
faqQ2: "Can I use this conversion for other citrus juices?"
faqA2: "Most citrus juices, like lemon or grapefruit, have similar densities, so 1 cup will also be around 8.45 ounces. However, thicker juices (like lime with pulp) might vary slightly. When in doubt, weigh it for precision."
faqQ3: "Why does my air fryer recipe call for orange juice in ounces instead of cups?"
faqA3: "Ounces provide a more precise measurement, which is crucial for air fryer cooking where small changes can affect texture. Using weight (like 8.45 oz per cup) ensures consistency, especially in marinades or glazes."
faqQ4: "How do I adjust a recipe if I only have a 200ml carton of orange juice?"
faqA4: "200ml is roughly 6.76 ounces, so you’d need about 1.7 ounces more to reach 1 cup (8.45 oz). Either top up with water or reduce other liquids slightly. For air fryer recipes, small adjustments like this usually work fine."

<p>1 cup of orange juice equals approximately 8.45 ounces (or 8.45 oz) in the UK. This measurement is essential for precision in cooking, especially when using an air fryer where ingredient ratios can affect texture and cooking times. Whether you're making glazes, marinades, or desserts, knowing this conversion ensures your dishes turn out perfectly every time.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on precise ingredient ratios to achieve even cooking and crispy results. Using too much or too little liquid, like orange juice, can throw off the balance. For example, a marinade with the wrong consistency might not coat evenly, leading to uneven browning. That’s why converting 1 cup of orange juice to ounces (8.45 oz) is so helpful.</p>

It’s a lifesaver for adapting traditional recipes to air fryer cooking. Plus, many of our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipes</a> use orange juice in glazes or sauces, so this conversion comes in handy often.</p>  

<h3>How to measure orange juice for air fryer recipes</h3>  
<p>For the most accurate results, use a liquid measuring cup or a kitchen scale. Pour the orange juice to the 1-cup mark, or weigh it to 8.45 ounces. If your recipe calls for a different amount, you can easily scale up or down. For example, half a cup would be 4.23 ounces, and two cups would be 16.9 ounces.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for orange juice in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Orange juice isn’t just for drinking—it’s a versatile ingredient in air fryer recipes. It adds brightness to marinades for chicken or shrimp, balances sweetness in glazes for desserts, and even tenderises meats.

<p>Another great use is in baking. Orange juice can replace some of the liquid in cakes or cookies for a citrusy twist. Just remember: 1 cup of orange juice equals 8.45 ounces, so adjust other wet ingredients accordingly. And don’t forget to clean your air fryer afterward—sticky citrus residues can build up.

<h3>Converting other orange juice measurements</h3>  
<p>If your recipe uses millilitres or grams, here’s a quick reference: 1 cup (240 ml) of orange juice weighs about 240 grams, which is roughly 8.45 ounces. For smaller amounts, 1 tablespoon is about 0.5 ounces, and 1 teaspoon is roughly 0.17 ounces. These conversions are handy for adjusting recipes on the fly.</p>  

<h2>Tips for working with orange juice in air fryers</h2>  
<p>Freshly squeezed orange juice works best for flavour, but store-bought is fine too—just check for added sugars. When using it in marinades, let the meat sit for at least 30 minutes for maximum flavour. For glazes, reduce the juice slightly on the stove first to thicken it, then brush it on during the last few minutes of air frying.</p>

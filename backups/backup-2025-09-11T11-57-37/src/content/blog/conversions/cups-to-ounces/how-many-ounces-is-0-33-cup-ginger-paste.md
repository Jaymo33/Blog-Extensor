faqQ1: "Can I use fresh ginger instead of 0.33 cup ginger paste?"
faqA1: "Yes, you can substitute fresh ginger for paste. About 1 tablespoon of freshly grated ginger equals 0.33 cup (2.64 oz) of paste. Adjust to taste, as fresh ginger tends to be more potent. This swap works well in air fryer marinades and sauces."
faqQ2: "How long does 0.33 cup of ginger paste last in the fridge?"
faqA2: "A 0.33 cup portion of ginger paste stays fresh for about 2-3 weeks when refrigerated in an airtight container. For best results in air fryer cooking, check for discolouration or off smells before use. Freezing extends its shelf life significantly."
faqQ3: "Why do air fryer recipes often use ginger paste measurements in cups?"
faqA3: "Cup measurements are common in recipes for consistency and ease. While 0.33 cup equals 2.64 oz, cups are more accessible for most home cooks. However, weighing ingredients (ounces) often provides greater accuracy for air fryer cooking, where small quantities matter."
faqQ4: "Can I make my own ginger paste from 0.33 cup fresh ginger?"
faqA4: "Absolutely! Blend 0.33 cup peeled fresh ginger (about 2.64 oz) with 1-2 tablespoons water until smooth. Homemade paste works perfectly in air fryer recipes and lets you control the texture. Store it like shop-bought paste for future use."

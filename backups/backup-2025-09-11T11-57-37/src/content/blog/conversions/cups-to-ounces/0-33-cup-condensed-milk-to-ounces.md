faqQ1: "Can I use evaporated milk instead of condensed milk in air fryer recipes?"
faqA1: "Evaporated milk isn’t a direct substitute for condensed milk, as it lacks added sugar. Condensed milk is thicker and sweeter, which affects texture and taste. If substituting, you’ll need to adjust sweetness and liquid ratios in your recipe."
faqQ2: "How do I store leftover condensed milk after measuring 0.33 cup?"
faqA2: "Transfer leftovers to an airtight container and refrigerate for up to 2 weeks. Ensure the lid is sealed tightly to prevent drying or absorbing fridge odours. Stir well before reusing, as separation can occur."
faqQ3: "Why does my air fryer recipe taste too sweet with 0.33 cup of condensed milk?"
faqA3: "Condensed milk is intensely sweet, so even small amounts like 0.33 cup (2.93 oz) can dominate. Balance it with acidic ingredients like lemon juice or reduce other sugars in the recipe. Taste-test before cooking."
faqQ4: "Can I freeze condensed milk for later use in air fryer recipes?"
faqA4: "Yes, condensed milk freezes well for up to 3 months. Thaw it overnight in the fridge and stir vigorously to restore consistency. Avoid freezing in the original can—transfer to a freezer-safe container instead."

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer baking</h2>  
<p>Baking powder is a leavening agent that helps air fryer recipes rise evenly. Too much can make baked goods bitter, while too little results in dense textures. Measuring 2 cups of baking powder correctly in ounces ensures your air fryer cakes, muffins, or batters turn out light and fluffy.

<p>Using a kitchen scale for ounces is more precise than cup measurements, especially for baking powder. Scooping directly from the bag can compact the powder, leading to uneven amounts. For best results, spoon the baking powder into the cup and level it off before converting to ounces. This method ensures your 2 cups of baking powder truly equals 16 ounces.</p>

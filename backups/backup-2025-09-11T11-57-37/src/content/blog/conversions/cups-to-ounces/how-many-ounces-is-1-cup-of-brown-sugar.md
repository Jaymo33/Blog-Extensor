faqQ1: "Does 1 cup of brown sugar weigh the same as white sugar?"
faqA1: "No, brown sugar is denser due to its molasses content. One cup of packed brown sugar weighs about 7.5 ounces, while granulated white sugar is closer to 7 ounces per cup. Always check your recipe for specific packing instructions."
faqQ2: "How do I measure brown sugar if I don’t have a scale?"
faqA2: "Use the spoon-and-level method: gently spoon brown sugar into a measuring cup without packing it, then level it off with a knife. For recipes requiring \"packed\" brown sugar, press it down slightly before levelling."
faqQ3: "Can I substitute brown sugar for white sugar in air fryer recipes?"
faqA3: "Yes, but expect a richer flavour and moister texture due to molasses. Adjust slightly—since brown sugar is heavier, use 7.5 ounces per cup instead of 7 ounces for white sugar."
faqQ4: "Why does my air fryer dessert turn out too sweet?"
faqA4: "Over-measuring brown sugar is a common culprit. Ensure you’re using 7.5 ounces per cup (not heaped) and balance it with acidic ingredients like lemon juice or yoghurt to cut sweetness."

<p>One cup of brown sugar weighs approximately 7.5 ounces (213 grams). This measurement is essential for baking and air frying, ensuring your recipes turn out perfectly every time. Whether you're making cookies, cakes, or even air-fried desserts, knowing the exact weight of brown sugar helps maintain consistency. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we understand the importance of accurate conversions for flawless results.</p>  

<h2>Why measuring brown sugar correctly matters</h2>  
<p>Brown sugar has a unique texture due to its molasses content, which makes it denser than granulated sugar. This means 1 cup of brown sugar to ounces isn’t the same as other sugars. Packing it too tightly or too loosely can throw off your recipe. For air fryer desserts like sticky toffee pudding or cinnamon rolls, precise measurements ensure the right sweetness and texture.

<p>Many UK bakers wonder if 1 cup of brown sugar in ounces differs from US measurements. The answer is no—1 cup equals roughly 7.5 ounces in both systems. However, using a kitchen scale eliminates guesswork, especially for air fryer recipes where even small deviations can affect cooking times. Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipes</a> section for delicious ideas that rely on perfect measurements.</p>  

<h3>How to measure brown sugar without a scale</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a scale, spoon the brown sugar into a measuring cup and level it off with a knife. Avoid packing it down unless the recipe specifies "firmly packed." For air fryer baking, consistency is key—whether you’re making brownies or glazed carrots. A properly measured cup ensures your dish isn’t overly sweet or dry.

<h3>Converting other sugar measurements</h3>  
<p>While 1 cup of brown sugar to oz is 7.5, granulated sugar weighs slightly less (7 ounces per cup). This difference matters in air fryer recipes, where moisture and density affect cooking. Always check whether your recipe calls for packed or loose brown sugar to avoid mishaps.

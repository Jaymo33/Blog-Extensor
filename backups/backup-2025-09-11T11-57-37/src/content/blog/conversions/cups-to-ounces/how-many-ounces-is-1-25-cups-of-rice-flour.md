<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on even heat distribution, and incorrect flour amounts can lead to dry or dense results. Rice flour, in particular, absorbs moisture differently than wheat flour, so weighing it ensures consistency. If you're adapting a traditional recipe for your air fryer, converting cups to ounces is a must. Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> for inspiration on using rice flour in dishes like tempura or cakes.</p>  

<p>Many UK bakers prefer weighing ingredients for reliability, as cup measurements can vary. A kitchen scale eliminates guesswork, especially for gluten-free baking. For example, 1.25 cups of rice flour (5.3 oz) is ideal for coating chicken or making light batters. Need more guidance?

<h3>How to measure rice flour without a scale</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a scale, spoon the flour into a measuring cup and level it off—don’t pack it down. This method helps approximate the weight, though a scale is more accurate. For 1.25 cups of rice flour (5.3 oz), lightly fill two ½-cup measures and one ¼-cup measure. This technique works well for air fryer batters and coatings, ensuring even cooking.</p>

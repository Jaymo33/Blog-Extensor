faqQ1: "Can I use fresh corn instead of frozen corn in this measurement?"
faqA1: "Yes, you can use fresh corn, but the weight may vary slightly. Fresh corn kernels are slightly heavier due to higher moisture content. For 0.375 cup, you’d still need roughly 3 ounces, but adjust based on kernel size."
faqQ2: "Does the brand of frozen corn affect the weight per cup?"
faqA2: "Most frozen corn brands have similar weights per cup, but always check the packaging for specifics. Some brands may cut kernels smaller, affecting density. When in doubt, weigh it for accuracy."
faqQ3: "How do I defrost frozen corn before air frying?"
faqA3: "You can air fry frozen corn directly without defrosting for a crispier texture. If a recipe calls for thawed corn, leave it in the fridge overnight or rinse under cold water for a few minutes."
faqQ4: "Can I use this measurement for other frozen vegetables?"
faqA4: "This conversion applies specifically to frozen corn. Other vegetables like peas or carrots have different densities, so check individual conversion charts. Always weigh for best results."

At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we emphasise the importance of getting measurements right for the best results.</p>
<p>Honey’s density means it weighs more than other liquids, so volume-to-weight conversions like 3 cups to ounces are particularly useful. This is especially true for air fryer cooking, where even small deviations can affect cooking times and outcomes. Whether you’re making honey-glazed chicken or a sweet dessert, knowing the exact weight ensures consistency every time.</p>

<h2>How to measure honey accurately</h2>
<p>Measuring honey can be tricky due to its sticky nature. To get an accurate 3 cups of honey, lightly grease your measuring cup with oil or spray to help the honey slide out easily. This method prevents waste and ensures you’re using the correct amount. For air fryer recipes, precision is even more critical, as the cooking process is faster and more intense.</p>

<h2>Tips for working with honey in the air fryer</h2>
<p>Honey can caramelise quickly in the air fryer, so it’s best to add it towards the end of cooking. For example, if you’re making honey-glazed chicken, brush the honey on during the last 5-10 minutes to prevent burning. This technique ensures a glossy, sticky finish without overdoing it.

<p>Another tip is to thin the honey slightly with water or lemon juice if you’re using it as a glaze. This helps it spread more evenly and prevents clumping.

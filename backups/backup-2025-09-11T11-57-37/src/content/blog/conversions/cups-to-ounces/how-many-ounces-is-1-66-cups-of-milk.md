<p>1.66 cups of milk equals approximately 13.28 ounces. This conversion is essential for precise cooking, especially when using an air fryer where measurements can make or break a recipe. Whether you're whipping up a creamy sauce or baking a cake, knowing the exact weight ensures consistency.

<h2>Why Convert Cups to Ounces?</h2>  
<p>Converting cups to ounces is crucial for recipes that require precision, such as air fryer desserts or sauces. Cups measure volume, while ounces measure weight, and milk's density means the two aren't interchangeable. For example, 1.66 cups of milk to ounces ensures you add the right amount for a creamy texture. Many UK recipes, especially those on <a href="https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes">airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes</a>, use ounces for consistency. This avoids over- or under-measuring, which can affect taste and texture.</p>

faqQ1: "Can I use butter instead of margarine in air fryer recipes?"
faqA1: "Yes, you can substitute butter for margarine in air fryer recipes, but adjust measurements slightly. Butter contains less water, so use about 10% less (5.4 ounces for 0.75 cup equivalent). Monitor cooking times as butter browns faster in air fryers."
faqQ2: "How do I measure 0.75 cup of margarine without a measuring cup?"
faqA2: "If you don't have measuring cups, use a kitchen scale to weigh out 6 ounces (170g) of margarine. Alternatively, a standard UK tablespoon holds 0.5 ounces, so 12 tablespoons equal 0.75 cup. Always pack margarine firmly for accurate measurements."
faqQ3: "Does margarine type affect the 0.75 cup to ounces conversion?"
faqA3: "Different margarine brands may vary slightly in density. Standard block margarine measures 6 ounces per 0.75 cup, while softer tub varieties might be slightly less dense. For precision in air fryer recipes, weighing is most reliable."
faqQ4: "Why does my air fryer recipe need exactly 0.75 cup of margarine?"
faqA4: "The 0.75 cup (6 ounces) measurement balances moisture and fat content in air fryer cooking. Too little margarine can dry out food, while too much may cause smoking. This quantity ensures even cooking and perfect texture in most recipes."

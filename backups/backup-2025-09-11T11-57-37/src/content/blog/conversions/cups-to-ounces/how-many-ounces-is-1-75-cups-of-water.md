faqQ1: "Is 1.75 cups of water the same as 1.75 cups of other liquids in ounces?"
faqA1: "Yes, for most liquids with a similar density to water (like milk or broth), 1.75 cups equals 14 fluid ounces. However, thicker liquids like syrup or oil may vary slightly due to density differences. Always check specific conversions for viscous liquids."
faqQ2: "How do I measure 1.75 cups of water without a measuring cup?"
faqA2: "If you don't have a measuring cup, use a standard 8-ounce glass: 1.75 cups would be 1 full glass plus 3/4 of another. Alternatively, use a kitchen scale - 14 fluid ounces of water weighs approximately 414 grams. For air fryer recipes, precision matters, so we recommend proper measuring tools."
faqQ3: "Why do some recipes use ounces instead of cups for water measurements?"
faqA3: "Ounces provide more precision, especially for air fryer cooking where small quantity changes affect results. Cups can vary based on how ingredients are packed, while fluid ounces are consistent. Professional recipes often use weights (ounces) for accuracy in baking and cooking."
faqQ4: "Does the type of cup affect the 1.75 cups to ounces conversion?"
faqA4: "Standard measuring cups (240ml per cup) will give you 14 oz for 1.75 cups. However, if using a teacup or mug, the volume may differ. Always use proper kitchen measuring cups for air fryer recipes to ensure the correct 1.75 cups to ounces (14 oz) conversion."

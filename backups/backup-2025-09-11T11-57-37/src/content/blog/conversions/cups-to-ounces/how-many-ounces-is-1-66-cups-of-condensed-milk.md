faqQ1: "Can I use evaporated milk instead of condensed milk in air fryer recipes?"
faqA1: "No, evaporated milk and condensed milk are not interchangeable. Condensed milk is sweetened, while evaporated milk is unsweetened. Substituting one for the other will drastically alter the taste and texture of your recipe."
faqQ2: "How do I measure 1.66 cups of condensed milk without a measuring cup?"
faqA2: "If you don’t have a measuring cup, use a kitchen scale to weigh out 13.28 ounces of condensed milk. Alternatively, a standard UK tablespoon holds 0.5 ounces, so you’d need roughly 26.5 tablespoons for 1.66 cups."
faqQ3: "Why does my condensed milk burn in the air fryer?"
faqA3: "Condensed milk burns easily due to its high sugar content. To prevent this, cook at a lower temperature (150°C or lower) and check frequently. Covering the dish with foil can also help distribute heat evenly."
faqQ4: "Can I make my own condensed milk for air fryer recipes?"
faqA4: "Yes! Simmer 2 cups of milk with 1 cup of sugar until reduced by half. This homemade version works well in air fryer recipes, though it may be slightly thinner than store-bought condensed milk."

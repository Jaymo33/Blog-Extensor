faqQ1: "Can I use tomato sauce instead of tomato paste in my air fryer recipe?"
faqA1: "Tomato sauce can be used, but it’s much thinner than paste. You’ll need to reduce the quantity of other liquids in your recipe. For every 0.25 cup (2 ounces) of tomato paste, use about 1 cup of tomato sauce and simmer to thicken."
faqQ2: "How do I convert 0.25 cup of tomato paste to grams?"
faqA2: "0.25 cup (2 ounces) of tomato paste is approximately 56 grams. This conversion is useful if you’re using a kitchen scale for more precise measurements in your air fryer recipes."
faqQ3: "Why does my air fryer recipe specify tomato paste instead of fresh tomatoes?"
faqA3: "Tomato paste is concentrated, providing intense flavour without excess moisture. In air fryers, too much liquid can prevent proper crisping. The 0.25 cup measurement gives flavour without making food soggy."
faqQ4: "Can I freeze leftover tomato paste for future air fryer recipes?"
faqA4: "Absolutely! Portion your leftover tomato paste into tablespoon amounts (about 0.5 ounces each) and freeze. These pre-measured amounts make it easy to grab just what you need for future 0.25 cup measurements in recipes."

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on even cooking, and incorrect measurements can lead to uneven results. Too much tomato paste might make your dish overly thick, while too little could leave it lacking flavour. This is especially important for recipes like meatballs or stuffed peppers, where balance is key. If you’re new to air frying, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipes section</a> has plenty of inspiration. Always measure ingredients like tomato paste carefully for the best outcome.</p>  

<p>Tomato paste is a concentrated ingredient, so small variations can have a big impact. Using 2 ounces (0.25 cup) ensures your dish has the right consistency and taste. For dishes like air fryer lasagna or stuffed mushrooms, this precision is vital. Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable recipes</a> for ideas on how to use tomato paste effectively.</p>  

<h3>How to measure 0.25 cup of tomato paste accurately</h3>  
<p>Use a liquid measuring cup for the most precise measurement. Scoop the tomato paste into the cup and level it off with a straight edge. If you don’t have a measuring cup, 2 ounces is roughly four tablespoons. For sticky ingredients like tomato paste, spraying your measuring spoon with oil can help it slide out easily.

<h3>Storing leftover tomato paste</h3>  
<p>If you have leftover tomato paste, transfer it to an airtight container and refrigerate. It will keep for about a week, or you can freeze it in ice cube trays for longer storage. Each cube is roughly one tablespoon, making future measurements easy. This way, you’ll always have the right amount for your next air fryer creation.</p>

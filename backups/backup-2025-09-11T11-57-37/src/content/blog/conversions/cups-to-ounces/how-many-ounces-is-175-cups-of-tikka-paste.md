faqQ1: "Can I use 1.75 cups of tikka paste straight from the jar for air frying?"
faqA1: "Yes, you can use 1.75 cups (14 oz) of tikka paste directly from the jar, but thinning it slightly with yogurt or oil helps it coat ingredients more evenly. For air frying, a thicker marinade works well as it clings to food better during the high-heat cooking process."
faqQ2: "How long should I marinate food with 1.75 cups of tikka paste before air frying?"
faqA2: "For best results, marinate your protein with 1.75 cups (14 oz) of tikka paste for at least 2 hours, or overnight for deeper flavour. The air fryer's intense heat means you don't need as long as traditional oven cooking, but adequate marinating time ensures the spices penetrate properly."
faqQ3: "Does the brand of tikka paste affect the 1.75 cups to ounces conversion?"
faqA3: "While 1.75 cups generally equals 14 ounces, some brands of tikka paste may be slightly more or less dense. For absolute precision, especially in air fryer cooking where consistency matters, weighing your paste is recommended regardless of brand."
faqQ4: "Can I freeze leftover tikka paste after measuring out 1.75 cups?"
faqA4: "Absolutely! Any leftover tikka paste from your 1.75 cup (14 oz) measurement can be frozen for up to 3 months. Portion it into ice cube trays or small containers for easy use in future air fryer recipes. Thaw in the refrigerator before using."

<p>Many air fryer recipes, like our popular <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken tikka</a>, call for specific amounts of paste to achieve the perfect balance of flavours. Measuring by weight (ounces) is often more accurate than volume (cups), especially for thick ingredients like tikka paste. This precision ensures your meals turn out just right, whether you're cooking for one or meal prepping for the week.</p>

<h2>How to Measure 1.75 Cups of Tikka Paste</h2>
<p>If you don't have a measuring cup handy, you can use a kitchen scale to weigh out 14 ounces of tikka paste. Simply place your container on the scale, tare it to zero, and spoon in the paste until you reach the desired weight. This method is particularly useful for sticky or dense ingredients that might not level neatly in a cup.</p>

<p>For those who prefer using cups, 1.75 cups is equivalent to 1 cup plus 3/4 cup. Use a liquid measuring cup for the most accurate results, and level off the top with a straight edge. Remember, the density of tikka paste can vary slightly between brands, so weighing it removes any guesswork.

<h2>Tips for Working with Tikka Paste in Your Air Fryer</h2>
<p>When using 1.75 cups of tikka paste (14 oz) in your air fryer, consider lining the basket with parchment paper to prevent sticking. The high sugar content in many tikka pastes can caramelize and adhere to the basket if not properly prepared. Always preheat your air fryer for 2-3 minutes before adding marinated ingredients for best results.</p>

<p>For even cooking, arrange items in a single layer and shake the basket halfway through cooking time. This ensures all surfaces get equal exposure to the hot air circulation. If you're cooking larger quantities that require multiple batches, keep cooked portions warm in a low oven while you finish the rest. Proper measurement of your 1.75 cups (14 oz) of tikka paste is just the first step to air fryer success!</p>

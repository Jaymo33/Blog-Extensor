faqQ1: "Can I use regular milk instead of evaporated milk in air fryer recipes?"
faqA1: "Yes, but you’ll need to adjust the quantity. Regular milk is thinner, so use 1.5 times the amount of evaporated milk. For example, if a recipe calls for 1.66 cups (13.28 oz) of evaporated milk, use 2.49 cups of regular milk. Keep in mind the texture and flavour will be slightly different."
faqQ2: "How do I measure 1.66 cups of evaporated milk without a measuring cup?"
faqA2: "If you don’t have a measuring cup, use a kitchen scale to weigh 13.28 ounces of evaporated milk. Alternatively, you can estimate using common household items: 1.66 cups is roughly equivalent to 400 ml. For accuracy, we recommend investing in a simple measuring cup or scale."
faqQ3: "Does evaporated milk weigh the same as condensed milk?"
faqA3: "No, evaporated milk and condensed milk have different weights due to their sugar content. Evaporated milk weighs about 8 oz per cup, while sweetened condensed milk is denser at around 10 oz per cup. Always check your recipe to ensure you’re using the correct type and amount."
faqQ4: "Can I freeze leftover evaporated milk?"
faqA4: "Yes, you can freeze evaporated milk for up to 3 months. Thaw it in the fridge overnight and stir well before using. Note that the texture may change slightly, so it’s best used in cooked dishes like sauces or baked goods rather than fresh applications. Always store it in an airtight container."

<h3>How to Measure Evaporated Milk Correctly</h3>
<p>For the most accurate measurement, use a kitchen scale to weigh your evaporated milk in ounces. If you don’t have one, a liquid measuring cup will work, but ensure you level it off properly.

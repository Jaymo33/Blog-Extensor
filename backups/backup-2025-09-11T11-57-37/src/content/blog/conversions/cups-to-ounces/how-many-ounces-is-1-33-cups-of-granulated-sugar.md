faqQ1: "Is 1.33 cups of granulated sugar the same as 1 and 1/3 cups?"
faqA1: "Yes, 1.33 cups is the decimal equivalent of 1 and 1/3 cups. Both measurements refer to the same amount of granulated sugar, which converts to roughly 9.5 ounces in UK measurements. This is useful for scaling recipes or when using digital scales."
faqQ2: "Can I use brown sugar instead of granulated sugar in air fryer recipes?"
faqA2: "You can substitute brown sugar, but it will affect moisture and flavour. Brown sugar contains molasses, making it denser—1.33 cups of packed brown sugar weighs more than granulated. Adjust measurements slightly and expect a richer taste in dishes like air fryer cookies or glazes."
faqQ3: "How do I convert 1.33 cups of granulated sugar to grams?"
faqA3: "1.33 cups of granulated sugar equals approximately 270 grams. For air fryer baking, grams are often more precise than ounces or cups. Use a kitchen scale for the best results, especially in recipes where sugar plays a key structural role."
faqQ4: "Why does my air fryer recipe taste too sweet with 1.33 cups of sugar?"
faqA4: "Air fryers cook faster than conventional ovens, which can intensify sweetness. Try reducing the sugar by 10-15% or balancing it with acidic ingredients like lemon juice. Always taste batters or mixes before cooking to adjust flavours as needed."

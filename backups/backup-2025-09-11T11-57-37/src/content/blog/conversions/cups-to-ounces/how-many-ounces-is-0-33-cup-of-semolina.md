faqQ1: "Can I use flour instead of semolina in air fryer recipes?"
faqA1: "Yes, but results will differ. Semolina’s coarse texture creates a crispier coating, while flour may yield a softer finish. For breading, mix semolina with breadcrumbs for extra crunch."
faqQ2: "Why does my air-fried semolina coating taste bitter?"
faqA2: "Overcooking can cause bitterness. Air fry at 180°C for 8–10 minutes, shaking halfway. Also, check your semolina’s freshness—rancid grains develop off-flavours."
faqQ3: "How do I store leftover semolina for air frying?"
faqA3: "Keep it in an airtight container in a cool, dry place. For long-term storage, freeze semolina in portions. Bring to room temperature before using."
faqQ4: "Is 0.33 cup of semolina the same as 1/3 cup?"
faqA4: "No—0.33 cup is slightly less than 1/3 cup (0.333 cup). For precision, use a scale: 0.33 cup equals 1.76 oz, while 1/3 cup is about 1.82 oz."

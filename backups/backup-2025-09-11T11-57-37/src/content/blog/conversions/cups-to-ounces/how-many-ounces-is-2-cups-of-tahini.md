faqQ1: "Does tahini weight change if it’s refrigerated?"
faqA1: "Yes, refrigerated tahini thickens, making it denser. For accurate measurements, let it come to room temperature and stir well before measuring. This ensures your 2 cups of tahini to ounces conversion stays consistent."
faqQ2: "Can I use a liquid measuring cup for tahini?"
faqA2: "It’s better to use dry measuring cups for tahini, as its thick consistency can make it hard to pour. Spoon it into the cup and level it off for the most accurate 2 cups tahini to ounces measurement."
faqQ3: "How do I convert tahini from grams to ounces?"

faqQ4: "Why does my tahini measurement seem off?"
faqA4: "Tahini can settle and separate, leading to inconsistent measurements. Always stir it thoroughly before measuring to ensure accuracy. If your 2 cups of tahini in ounces seems incorrect, check if the tahini was properly mixed."

<p>2 cups of tahini equals approximately 16 ounces (or 1 pound). This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precision matters, ensuring your dishes turn out perfectly every time. Whether you're making a creamy tahini dip or a marinade, knowing the exact weight helps maintain consistency.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on even cooking, and incorrect ingredient quantities can throw off texture and flavour. Tahini, a thick sesame paste, is often used in dressings, sauces, and even baked goods. Measuring it correctly ensures your recipes, like those on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, turn out just right.</p>  

<p>Using weight (ounces) instead of volume (cups) is more reliable, especially for dense ingredients like tahini. A kitchen scale is a great tool for this, but if you don’t have one, our conversion guide will help.

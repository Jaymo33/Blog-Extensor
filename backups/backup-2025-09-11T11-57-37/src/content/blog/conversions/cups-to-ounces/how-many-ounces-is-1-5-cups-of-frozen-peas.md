faqQ1: "Can I use thawed peas instead of frozen for air frying?"
faqA1: "Thawed peas will cook faster and may become mushy in the air fryer. For best results, use them frozen to retain texture and prevent overcooking. If you must use thawed peas, reduce the cooking time by 2–3 minutes."
faqQ2: "How do I convert 1.5 cups of frozen peas to grams?"
faqA2: "1.5 cups of frozen peas weigh approximately 340 grams. This conversion is handy for recipes using metric measurements. Always weigh peas for accuracy, especially in air fryer cooking where precision affects results."
faqQ3: "Why do my air-fried peas come out soggy?"
faqA3: "Sogginess usually happens if the peas are overcrowded or not shaken during cooking. Use a single layer and shake the basket halfway. Also, ensure your air fryer is preheated to the right temperature for crisper results."
faqQ4: "Can I cook 1.5 cups of frozen peas with other vegetables?"
faqA4: "Absolutely! Peas pair well with carrots, corn, or green beans in the air fryer. Just adjust cooking times as needed—harder veggies may need a few extra minutes. Keep portions balanced for even cooking."

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter for Frozen Peas</h2>  
<p>Using the correct weight of frozen peas ensures even cooking in your air fryer. Too many peas can lead to steaming instead of crisping, while too few might burn. Frozen peas are a staple in many air fryer recipes, from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable medleys</a> to protein-packed meals. Measuring by weight (ounces) is often more reliable than volume (cups), as peas can settle or vary in density.</p>  

<p>If you’re scaling a recipe up or down, converting 1.5 cups of frozen peas to ounces (12 oz) makes adjustments simple. For example, doubling a recipe would mean using 24 ounces instead of 3 cups. This precision is especially useful for meal preppers or those cooking for larger families. Need inspiration? Browse our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> for creative ways to use frozen peas.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure Frozen Peas Correctly</h3>  
<p>For the most accurate measurement, use a kitchen scale to weigh your frozen peas directly in ounces. If you don’t have one, lightly spoon the peas into a measuring cup without packing them down. Avoid thawing the peas first, as this can alter the weight and texture. Keeping them frozen ensures they cook evenly and retain their vibrant colour in the air fryer.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for 1.5 Cups of Frozen Peas in Air Fryers</h2>  
<p>Frozen peas are incredibly versatile in air fryer cooking. A 1.5-cup (12 oz) portion works perfectly for sides like garlic-pea mash or crispy pea fritters. They also pair well with proteins like salmon or chicken in one-tray meals. Since peas cook quickly, they’re ideal for last-minute additions to stir-fries or grain bowls prepared in the air fryer.</p>  

<p>For a simple snack, toss 1.5 cups of frozen peas with a bit of olive oil and salt, then air fry at 180°C for 8–10 minutes. The result? Lightly crispy peas with a tender interior. If you’re experimenting with new dishes, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/frozen-foods>frozen foods section</a> has plenty of ideas to get you started.</p>  

<h3>Tips for Cooking Frozen Peas in an Air Fryer</h3>  
<p>To prevent sogginess, spread the peas in a single layer in the air fryer basket. Shake them halfway through cooking for even browning. Since 1.5 cups of frozen peas equals 12 ounces, you’ll need to adjust cooking times if scaling the quantity. Always preheat your air fryer for the crispiest results, and consider pairing peas with other veggies for a balanced dish.</p>  

<h2>Converting Other Frozen Vegetable Measurements</h2>  
<p>While 1.5 cups of frozen peas equal 12 ounces, other veggies may differ. For example, 1.5 cups of frozen broccoli florets weigh closer to 10 ounces due to their shape and density. Always check weight conversions when substituting ingredients in air fryer recipes.

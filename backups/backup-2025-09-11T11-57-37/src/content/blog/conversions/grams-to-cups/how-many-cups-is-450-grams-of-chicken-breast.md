faqQ1: "Can I use 450 grams of chicken breast straight from frozen?"
faqA1: "It's best to thaw 450 grams of chicken breast before measuring or cooking. Frozen chicken can cook unevenly in the air fryer, and the ice crystals may affect the cup measurement. For safety and accuracy, defrost it in the fridge overnight."
faqQ2: "Does the type of chicken breast affect the cup measurement?"
faqA2: "Yes, boneless, skinless chicken breast yields a different cup measurement than bone-in varieties. Diced or shredded chicken also varies in volume. For air fryer recipes, boneless and skinless is easiest to measure and cooks more evenly."
faqQ3: "How do I adjust cooking time for 450 grams of chicken breast in the air fryer?"
faqA3: "For 450 grams of chicken breast, cook at 180°C for 15–20 minutes, flipping halfway. Thicker pieces may need extra time. Always check the internal temperature reaches 75°C for safety."
faqQ4: "Can I substitute 450 grams of chicken breast with thighs in cups?"
faqA4: "Chicken thighs have more fat and may shrink less, but 450 grams roughly equals the same cup measurement. Adjust cooking time slightly, as thighs can take longer to crisp in the air fryer."

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Using the correct amount of chicken breast ensures even cooking and prevents overcrowding in the air fryer basket. Overloading can lead to unevenly cooked food, while too little might dry it out.

<p>Different cuts of chicken breast can slightly alter the cup measurement. For example, finely diced chicken packs more densely into a cup than larger chunks.

<h3>How to Measure 450 Grams of Chicken Breast Without Scales</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have kitchen scales, visual cues can help. A standard cup holds about 150–180 grams of diced chicken breast, so 450 grams would fill roughly 2.5 to 3 cups. Keep in mind that shredded chicken takes up more volume than cubed. For air fryer cooking, slightly underfilling the cup prevents spillage and promotes crispiness. Need cleaning tips?

faqQ1: "Does 100 grams of broccoli change in volume when cooked?"
faqA1: "Yes, broccoli shrinks slightly when cooked due to water loss. 100 grams of raw broccoli yields about 3/4 cup after air frying. Always measure raw broccoli for recipes unless specified otherwise."
faqQ2: "Can I use frozen broccoli instead of fresh for 100 grams?"
faqA2: "Absolutely! Frozen broccoli works well—100 grams is still roughly 1 cup. No need to thaw; just add 1–2 extra minutes in the air fryer. Pat dry after cooking to remove excess moisture."
faqQ3: "How many calories are in 100 grams of broccoli?"
faqA3: "100 grams of raw broccoli contains about 34 calories, making it a low-calorie, nutrient-dense choice for air frying. It's packed with fibre, vitamin C, and antioxidants."
faqQ4: "Should I weigh broccoli before or after trimming the stems?"
faqA4: "Weigh after trimming unless your recipe specifies otherwise. Most recipes assume trimmed broccoli, but if using stems (great for slaws!), include them in your 100-gram measurement for accuracy."

<p>100 grams of broccoli is approximately 1 cup when chopped, making it easy to measure for air fryer recipes. Whether you're prepping a quick side dish or adding broccoli to a main meal, knowing this conversion ensures consistent results. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we focus on precise measurements to help you cook with confidence.</p>

<h2>Understanding Broccoli Measurements</h2>
<p>Broccoli can be tricky to measure because its volume changes depending on how it's prepared. Chopped broccoli takes up less space than florets, so 100 grams of chopped broccoli fills about 1 cup. If you're using whole florets, the same weight may occupy slightly more space. For best results, weigh your broccoli first or use a measuring cup for accuracy.</p>
<p>Many air fryer recipes, like those found in our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetables category</a>, rely on precise measurements for even cooking. Whether roasting, steaming, or crisping, 100 grams of broccoli cooks beautifully in an air fryer in just 8–10 minutes. Always check your recipe for specific preparation tips.</p>

<h3>Why Weighing Broccoli Matters</h3>
<p>Weighing ingredients ensures consistency, especially in air frying where space and heat distribution matter. A kitchen scale removes guesswork, so 100 grams of broccoli is always 100 grams—whether finely chopped or in large florets. This precision helps avoid undercooking or overcrowding your air fryer basket.</p>

<h2>Converting Grams to Cups for Broccoli</h2>
<p>While 100 grams of broccoli equals roughly 1 cup, slight variations occur based on packing density. Lightly packed broccoli may measure closer to 1.25 cups, while tightly packed could be just under 1 cup. For baking or meal prep, like our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a>, weighing is best for accuracy.</p>
<p>If you don't have a scale, fluff the broccoli in the measuring cup without pressing down. This method gets you closest to the 100-gram mark. Remember, air fryers cook best with evenly spaced food, so proper measuring prevents soggy or unevenly crisped broccoli.</p>

<h3>Broccoli Prep Tips for Air Frying</h3>
<p>For perfect air-fried broccoli, cut florets into uniform sizes. This ensures 100 grams cooks evenly, whether you're making a single serving or batch cooking. Toss with a bit of oil and seasoning before air frying at 190°C for crispy, golden results every time.</p>

<h2>Common Uses for 100 Grams of Broccoli</h2>
<p>100 grams of broccoli is ideal for single servings in the air fryer. It's enough for a side dish, salad topping, or mixed into stir-fries. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>airfryerrecipe.co.uk/conversions</a>, you'll find more handy measurement guides to simplify cooking.</p>
<p>This portion also works well in meal prep—roast 100-gram batches and store for quick weekday lunches. Pair with proteins or grains from our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/meal-prep>meal prep recipes</a> for balanced, air-fried meals all week.</p>

<h3>Storing Leftover Broccoli</h3>
<p>If you cook extra, store leftover air-fried broccoli in an airtight container for up to 3 days. Reheat in the air fryer at 180°C for 2–3 minutes to restore crispiness. Always let it cool completely before refrigerating to maintain texture.</p>

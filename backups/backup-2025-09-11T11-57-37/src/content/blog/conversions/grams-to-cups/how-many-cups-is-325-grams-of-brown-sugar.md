faqQ1: "Does 325 grams of brown sugar equal the same in cups for all recipes?"
faqA1: "No, the cup measurement for 325 grams of brown sugar can vary slightly depending on how tightly it’s packed. For baking or air fryer recipes where precision matters, weighing is best. Our conversion guide provides averages for both UK and US cups."
faqQ2: "Can I use granulated sugar instead of brown sugar for 325 grams?"

faqQ4: "Why does my air fryer recipe call for 325 grams of brown sugar instead of cups?"

<p>Brown sugar is denser than granulated sugar, so volume measurements vary. Packing it tightly into a cup yields more than a loosely filled one. This is why weighing 325 grams of brown sugar ensures accuracy, especially in air fryer baking where even heat distribution relies on balanced ingredients.</p>  

<h2>UK vs US Cup Measurements</h2>  
<p>In the UK, 1 cup of brown sugar is roughly 200 grams, meaning 325 grams equals about 1.6 cups. In the US, a cup is around 220 grams, so 325 grams is closer to 1.5 cups. If you're following a recipe from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>our collection</a>, always check which measurement standard it uses.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure Brown Sugar Correctly</h3>  
<p>For the most accurate conversion of 325 grams of brown sugar to cups, use a kitchen scale. If you don’t have one, spoon the sugar into a measuring cup and level it off without packing it down. This method works well for air fryer recipes where consistency is key.</p>

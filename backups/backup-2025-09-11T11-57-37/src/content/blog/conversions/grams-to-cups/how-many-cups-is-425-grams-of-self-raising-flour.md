faqQ1: "Does 425 grams of self-raising flour equal 3 cups?"
faqA1: "No, 425 grams of self-raising flour equals approximately 3.4 cups when measured correctly. The exact amount can vary slightly depending on how you scoop and level the flour. For precise baking, especially in air fryers where space matters, we recommend using digital scales."
faqQ2: "How do I convert 425g of self-raising flour to cups without scales?"
faqA2: "To convert 425 grams of self-raising flour to cups without scales, use the spoon-and-level method. Gently spoon flour into a measuring cup until heaping, then level off with a straight edge. Remember that 425g equals about 3.4 UK cups or 3.5 US cups. For air fryer recipes, consistency is key, so try to borrow scales if possible."
faqQ3: "Why does my air fryer baking fail with 425g flour measurements?"
faqA3: "If your air fryer baking fails with 425 grams of self-raising flour, check your conversion accuracy and the freshness of your flour. Old self-raising flour loses its raising power. Also ensure you're not overmixing the batter, as this develops gluten and creates dense results in the air fryer's intense heat."
faqQ4: "Can I use plain flour instead of self-raising for 425g measurements?"
faqA4: "Yes, but you'll need to add baking powder. For every 425 grams of plain flour, mix in 3 teaspoons of baking powder to create self-raising flour. Sift together thoroughly for even distribution. This substitution works well in air fryer recipes when you're out of self-raising flour."

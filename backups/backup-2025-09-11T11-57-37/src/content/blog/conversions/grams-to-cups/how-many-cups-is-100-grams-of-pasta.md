faqQ1: "Does the type of pasta affect how many cups 100 grams equals?"
faqA1: "Yes, pasta shape impacts cup measurements. Long pasta like spaghetti bundles differently than short shapes like penne or rotini. Generally, 100 grams of dried pasta is about 1 cup, but compact shapes may measure slightly more."
faqQ2: "How much cooked pasta does 100 grams of dry pasta yield?"
faqA2: "100 grams of dry pasta roughly doubles when cooked, yielding about 2 cups. This is useful for meal prep or adjusting air fryer recipes where texture matters, like crispy pasta dishes."
faqQ3: "Can I use a measuring cup instead of a scale for 100 grams of pasta?"
faqA3: "Absolutely! Use a dry measuring cup and lightly fill it without packing. For most pasta, 100 grams equals 1 cup, but fluffier shapes like fusilli may need a bit more."
faqQ4: "Why is measuring pasta important for air fryer cooking?"
faqA4: "Accurate measurements prevent overcrowding, ensuring even cooking and crispiness. Too much pasta can steam instead of crisp, while too little may burn. Stick to 100 grams (about 1 cup) for best results."

<h2>Why Measuring Pasta Correctly Matters</h2>  
<p>Cooking pasta in an air fryer requires precision to avoid under or overcooking. Too much pasta can lead to clumping, while too little may dry out. Measuring 100 grams of pasta in cups ensures consistency, especially for recipes like air-fried mac and cheese or crispy noodle snacks. If you're new to air frying, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a> has plenty of inspiration.</p>  

<p>Different pasta shapes can slightly alter the cup measurement. For example, 100 grams of penne may fill a cup differently than spaghetti. Always fluff the pasta lightly before measuring for accuracy. This is particularly useful when preparing dishes from our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable pasta recipes</a>.</p>  

<h3>Types of Pasta and Their Cup Measurements</h3>  
<p>Long pasta like spaghetti or linguine will measure differently than short shapes. 100 grams of spaghetti typically fills about 1 cup when bundled, while fusilli or rotini may measure closer to 1.25 cups due to their compact shape. Always adjust based on the pasta type for best results in your air fryer.</p>  

<h2>Converting Grams to Cups for Air Fryer Recipes</h2>  
<p>Converting 100 grams of pasta to cups is simple with a kitchen scale. If you don’t have one, use the general rule of 1 cup per 100 grams for most dried pasta. This works well for air fryer dishes like crispy pasta chips or baked ziti. For more tips, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning guide</a> to keep your appliance in top shape.</p>  

<p>Remember, cooked pasta expands, so 100 grams uncooked yields about 2 cups cooked. This is crucial for meal prep or batch cooking. Whether you're making a <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken pasta bake</a> or a simple garlic butter noodle dish, precise measurements ensure perfect results every time.</p>  

<h3>Tips for Measuring Pasta Without a Scale</h3>  
<p>If you’re without a scale, use a standard measuring cup and lightly fill it with pasta. Avoid packing it down, as this can lead to inaccuracies. For smaller shapes like orzo, 100 grams may be closer to ¾ cup. Experiment with your favourite air fryer recipes to find the ideal portion for your needs.</p>

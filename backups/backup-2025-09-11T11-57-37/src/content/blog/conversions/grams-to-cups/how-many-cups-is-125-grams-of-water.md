faqQ1: "Does 125 grams of water equal 125 ml?"
faqA1: "Yes, for practical cooking purposes, 125 grams of water equals exactly 125 millilitres due to water's density. This makes measuring easier when using liquid measuring cups in your air fryer recipes."
faqQ2: "How do I measure 125 grams of water without scales?"
faqA2: "Use a liquid measuring cup: 125 grams equals 125 ml, which is approximately 0.53 UK cups or 0.5 US cups. For accuracy, fill to the 125ml mark or halfway between 1/4 and 3/4 cup in a standard UK measuring cup."
faqQ3: "Why do air fryer recipes sometimes use grams instead of cups?"
faqA3: "Grams provide precise measurements unaffected by ingredient settling or packing, crucial for air fryer cooking where small quantity changes impact texture. Weight measurements also eliminate variability between different cup sizes or brands."
faqQ4: "Can I use the same conversion for other liquids like milk or oil?"
faqA4: "No, this conversion applies only to water. Milk and oil have different densities, so 125 grams would equal slightly different cup measurements. Always check specific density charts for non-water liquids in air fryer cooking."

<p>125 grams of water equals approximately 0.53 cups in the UK or 0.5 cups in the US. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements can make or break your dish. Whether you're baking, cooking, or prepping meals, knowing how many cups is 125 grams of water ensures consistent results every time.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Water Measurements Matter in Air Fryers</h2>
<p>Air fryers rely on precise ingredient ratios to achieve perfect texture and doneness. Using the wrong amount of water can affect everything from batter consistency to steaming vegetables. For example, if you're making air fryer cakes or bread, 125 grams of water in cups must be spot-on to avoid dry or soggy results. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we emphasise accuracy for foolproof cooking.</p>
<p>Many air fryer recipes, especially those for desserts or steamed dishes, list ingredients by weight. Converting 125g water to cups helps when you don’t have scales handy. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> simplifies these calculations for all your cooking needs.</p>

<h2>UK vs US Cup Measurements for 125 Grams of Water</h2>
<p>In the UK, 1 cup holds 284 ml of water, making 125 grams roughly 0.53 cups. In the US, where 1 cup is 240 ml, 125 grams equals about 0.5 cups. This small difference matters in air fryer recipes requiring exact hydration levels, like doughs or batters. Always check whether your recipe uses UK or US measurements.</p>
<p>For context, 125 grams of water in cups is just over half a UK cup or exactly half a US cup. This measurement is common in recipes like air fryer steamed puddings or marinades.

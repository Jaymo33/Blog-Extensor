faqQ1: "Does 500 grams of cheddar cheese equal the same in cups for all types of cheese?"
faqA1: "No, different cheeses have varying densities. Cheddar is denser than softer cheeses like mozzarella, so 500 grams may fill fewer cups if using a lighter cheese. Always check specific conversions for the cheese type you're using."
faqQ2: "Can I use pre-shredded cheese for measuring 500 grams in cups?"
faqA2: "Yes, but pre-shredded cheese often contains anti-caking agents, which can slightly alter volume. For the most accurate measurement, weigh 500 grams first, then lightly fill your cups without packing too tightly."
faqQ3: "How should I store leftover cheddar cheese after measuring 500 grams?"
faqA3: "Wrap leftover cheddar cheese tightly in parchment paper or cling film and store it in the fridge. Proper storage keeps it fresh for up to two weeks, ready for your next air fryer recipe."
faqQ4: "Why does my air fryer recipe call for grams instead of cups for cheese?"
faqA4: "Grams provide a more precise measurement, especially important in air fryer cooking where even heat distribution matters. Cups can vary based on how cheese is packed, but weight ensures consistency every time."

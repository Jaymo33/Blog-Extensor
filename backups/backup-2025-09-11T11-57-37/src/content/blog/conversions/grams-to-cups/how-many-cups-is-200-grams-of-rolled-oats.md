<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter</h2>

<h2>How to Measure 200 Grams of Rolled Oats</h2>
<p>The most accurate way to measure 200 grams of rolled oats is by using kitchen scales. If you don't have scales, the spoon-and-level method works well.

<h3>Packed vs. Unpacked Measurements</h3>
<p>Packed rolled oats will measure differently than loosely filled cups. For 200 grams, if you pack the oats firmly into the cup, you might only need about 2 cups. However, for most recipes, we recommend the looser measurement of 2.5 cups per 200 grams. This ensures your air fryer creations like granola or oat coatings have the ideal texture.</p>

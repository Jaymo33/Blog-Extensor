faqQ1: "Is 375 grams of self-raising flour the same as plain flour in cups?"
faqA1: "No, self-raising flour and plain flour have different densities due to the added baking powder in self-raising flour. While 375 grams of self-raising flour equals roughly 3 cups, plain flour may measure slightly differently. Always check your recipe for the correct type of flour."

<h2>Why Accurate Flour Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of self-raising flour is crucial for achieving the perfect texture in your baked goods. Too much flour can make your cakes dense, while too little can leave them flat. Air fryer recipes, like those on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, rely on precise measurements for consistent results. Whether you’re baking a Victoria sponge or fluffy scones, 375 grams of self-raising flour should translate to roughly 3 cups. Always spoon the flour into the cup and level it off for accuracy.</p>  

<p>Different brands of self-raising flour may vary slightly in density, so weighing is always best. However, if you don’t have scales, the cup method is a reliable alternative.

<h3>How to Measure 375 Grams of Self-Raising Flour Without Scales</h3>  
<p>If you don’t own kitchen scales, use the spoon-and-level method to measure 375 grams of self-raising flour. Gently spoon the flour into a measuring cup until it’s heaped, then level it off with a knife. Repeat this until you’ve filled 3 cups, which equals roughly 375 grams. Avoid scooping directly from the bag, as this compacts the flour and leads to inaccurate measurements.

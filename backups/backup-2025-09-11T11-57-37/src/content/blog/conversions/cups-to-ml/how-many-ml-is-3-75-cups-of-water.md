faqQ1: "Is 3.75 cups of water the same in UK and US measurements?"
faqA1: "No, UK and US cup measurements differ slightly. A US cup is 236.59 ml, while a UK cup is 284.13 ml. For 3.75 cups, this means 887.21 ml in the US and 1065.49 ml in the UK. Most air fryer recipes use US measurements for consistency."
faqQ2: "Can I use a kitchen scale instead of a measuring cup for 3.75 cups of water?"
faqA2: "Yes! Since 1 ml of water weighs 1 gram, you can measure 887.21 grams of water for 3.75 cups. This method is especially useful if you don’t have a measuring jug with ml markings. Just ensure your scale is set to grams for accuracy."
faqQ3: "Why does my air fryer recipe require such precise water measurements?"
faqA3: "Air fryers cook food quickly and evenly, so exact liquid quantities prevent under- or overcooking. Too much water can make food soggy, while too little may dry it out. Precision ensures perfect texture, especially in baked goods or steamed dishes."
faqQ4: "How do I adjust 3.75 cups of water for a smaller air fryer?"
faqA4: "Simply halve or quarter the measurement. For example, 1.875 cups (443.6 ml) or 0.9375 cups (221.8 ml) would suit smaller batches. Always check your air fryer’s capacity and adjust cooking times accordingly for best results."

faqQ1: "Does the type of coconut milk affect the ml conversion?"
faqA1: "No, the conversion remains the same whether you use full-fat, light, or canned coconut milk. However, thicker varieties may require stirring before measuring to ensure accuracy. Always shake or mix well for consistent results."
faqQ2: "Can I use this conversion for other liquids in air fryer recipes?"
faqA2: "Yes, this conversion applies to any liquid measured in cups, like broth or plant-based milk. However, viscosity differences (e.g., oil vs. coconut milk) may affect recipe outcomes. Adjust air fryer times slightly for thicker liquids."
faqQ3: "Why does my air fryer recipe turn out soggy with coconut milk?"
faqA3: "Sogginess usually means too much liquid or insufficient cooking time. Reduce coconut milk slightly or extend cooking time by 2–3 minutes. Preheating the air fryer can also help achieve a crispier texture."
faqQ4: "Is 1.75 cups of coconut milk the same in US and UK measurements?"
faqA4: "The UK cup (237 ml) and US cup (240 ml) are nearly identical, so the difference is negligible for most recipes. For precision baking, stick to one measurement system or use weight (grams) instead."

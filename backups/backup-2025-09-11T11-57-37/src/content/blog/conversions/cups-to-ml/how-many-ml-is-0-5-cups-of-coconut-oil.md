faqQ1: "Is 0.5 cups of coconut oil the same in the UK and USA?"
faqA1: "Yes, 0.5 cups of coconut oil equals 118 ml in both the UK and USA. While cup sizes can vary slightly for dry ingredients, liquid measurements like coconut oil remain consistent. Always use a standard measuring cup for accuracy."
faqQ2: "Can I use solid coconut oil instead of liquid for air fryer recipes?"
faqA2: "Absolutely! Solid coconut oil works fine—just melt it gently before measuring 0.5 cups (118 ml). It will solidify again when cooled, so mix it well into your ingredients for even distribution. This works great for coatings or baking."
faqQ3: "How do I measure 0.5 cups of coconut oil without a measuring jug?"
faqA3: "If you don’t have a jug, use tablespoons: 0.5 cups equals 8 tablespoons (about 118 ml). For solid oil, pack it loosely into the spoon and level it off. A kitchen scale can also help—0.5 cups weighs roughly 108 grams."
faqQ4: "Does coconut oil smoke in the air fryer at high temperatures?"
faqA4: "Coconut oil has a smoke point of around 175°C, so it’s fine for most air frying. Avoid exceeding this temperature to prevent smoking. For high-heat cooking, opt for refined coconut oil, which has a higher smoke point."

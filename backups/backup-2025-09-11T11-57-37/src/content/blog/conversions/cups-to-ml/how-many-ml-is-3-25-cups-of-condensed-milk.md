faqQ1: "Is 3.25 cups of condensed milk the same as one can?"
faqA1: "No, a standard can of condensed milk is usually 397 grams (about 1.5 cups or 354 ml). For 3.25 cups (768 ml), you’d need roughly two and a half cans. Always check the label for exact measurements before substituting."
faqQ2: "Can I use evaporated milk instead of condensed milk in air fryer recipes?"
faqA2: "Evaporated milk lacks the sweetness of condensed milk, so it’s not a direct swap. If substituting, add sugar (about 1 cup per 3.25 cups of evaporated milk) and reduce other liquids in the recipe."
faqQ3: "How do I store leftover condensed milk after measuring 3.25 cups?"
faqA3: "Transfer leftovers to an airtight container and refrigerate for up to two weeks. For longer storage, freeze in portions and thaw before use. Always stir well after refrigeration to restore consistency."
faqQ4: "Why does my air fryer recipe with condensed milk turn out too sweet?"
faqA4: "Condensed milk is intensely sweet, so reduce added sugar in the recipe. For 3.25 cups (768 ml), cut other sweeteners by half and adjust to taste. Balancing flavours is key in air fryer baking."

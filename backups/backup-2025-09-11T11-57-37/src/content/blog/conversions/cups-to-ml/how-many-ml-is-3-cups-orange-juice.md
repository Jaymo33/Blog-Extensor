faqQ1: "Is 3.0 cups of orange juice the same in UK and US measurements?"
faqA1: "No, there’s a slight difference. In the US, 3.0 cups equal 710 ml, while the UK metric cup is 250 ml per cup, making 3.0 cups 750 ml. Most air fryer recipes use US measurements, so stick to 710 ml unless specified otherwise."
faqQ2: "Can I use bottled orange juice instead of fresh for air fryer recipes?"
faqA2: "Yes, bottled orange juice works, but check for added sugars or preservatives, as these can alter the recipe’s flavour and texture. Fresh juice often provides a brighter taste, but bottled is convenient for consistent measurements like 3.0 cups (710 ml)."
faqQ3: "How do I adjust cooking time when using 3.0 cups of orange juice in a marinade?"
faqA3: "Marinating with 710 ml of orange juice may require slightly shorter cooking times in the air fryer, as the acidity can tenderise proteins faster. Reduce heat by 5–10°C and check for doneness a few minutes earlier to avoid overcooking."
faqQ4: "What’s the best way to store leftover orange juice after measuring 3.0 cups?"
faqA4: "Transfer unused juice to an airtight container and refrigerate for up to 3 days. For longer storage, freeze in ice cube trays (each cube is about 30 ml) and thaw as needed for future recipes requiring 3.0 cups (710 ml) conversions."

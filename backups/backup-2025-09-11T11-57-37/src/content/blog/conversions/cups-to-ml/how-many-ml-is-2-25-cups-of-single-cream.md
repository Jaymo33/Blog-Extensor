faqQ1: "Is 2.25 cups of single cream the same in the UK and US?"
faqA1: "While the cup measurement is similar, slight variations exist due to different standards. In the UK, 1 cup is 284 ml, whereas in the US, it's 237 ml. For 2.25 cups, this means roughly 639 ml (UK) vs 532.5 ml (US). Always check which system your recipe uses."
faqQ2: "Can I use double cream instead of single cream in the same quantity?"
faqA2: "No, double cream has a higher fat content and thicker consistency. If substituting, use slightly less double cream (about 1.5 cups or 355 ml for a similar richness). Adjust based on your recipe’s needs to avoid overly heavy results."
faqQ3: "How do I measure 2.25 cups of single cream without a measuring jug?"
faqA3: "If you lack a jug, use a standard metric scale. Single cream weighs roughly 1.02 grams per ml, so 532.5 ml equals about 543 grams. Alternatively, use a tablespoon (15 ml) and measure 35.5 tablespoons for 2.25 cups."
faqQ4: "What’s the best way to clean my air fryer after using single cream?"
faqA4: "Wipe spills immediately with a damp cloth to prevent sticking. For baked-on residue, use warm soapy water or our recommended <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner</a>. Avoid abrasive scrubbers to protect non-stick coatings."

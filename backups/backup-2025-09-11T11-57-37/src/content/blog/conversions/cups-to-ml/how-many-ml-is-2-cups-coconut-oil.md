faqQ1: "Is 2.0 cups of coconut oil the same in the UK and USA?"

faqQ2: "Can I use a kitchen scale instead of measuring cups for coconut oil?"

faqQ4: "How do I store leftover coconut oil after measuring 2.0 cups?"
faqA4: "Store coconut oil in an airtight container in a cool, dark place. If it’s melted, let it solidify before sealing. Proper storage keeps it fresh for up to two years."

<h3>How to Measure Coconut Oil Correctly</h3>  
<p>Coconut oil can be tricky to measure since it changes texture with temperature. If it’s solid, pack it firmly into the measuring cup. If it’s liquid, pour it slowly to avoid spills.

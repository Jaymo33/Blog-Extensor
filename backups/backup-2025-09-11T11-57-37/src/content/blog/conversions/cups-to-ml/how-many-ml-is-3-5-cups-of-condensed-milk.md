faqQ1: "Is 3.5 cups of condensed milk the same in the UK and US?"
faqA1: "Yes, 3.5 cups of condensed milk is the same volume in both the UK and US. However, cup sizes can vary slightly in other countries, so always double-check if using international recipes. For air fryer cooking, sticking to 828 ml ensures consistency."
faqQ2: "Can I use evaporated milk instead of condensed milk in this measurement?"
faqA2: "No, evaporated milk and condensed milk are not interchangeable. Condensed milk is sweetened and thicker, so substituting it will alter the recipe’s taste and texture. Stick to 828 ml of condensed milk for best results."
faqQ3: "How do I store leftover condensed milk after measuring 3.5 cups?"
faqA3: "Transfer any unused condensed milk to an airtight container and refrigerate. It will keep for up to two weeks. For longer storage, freeze it in portions and thaw as needed for future air fryer recipes."
faqQ4: "Why does my air fryer recipe with condensed milk turn out too sweet?"
faqA4: "Condensed milk is inherently sweet, so recipes using 3.5 cups (828 ml) may need balancing with tart or bitter ingredients. Try adding citrus zest or reducing sugar elsewhere in the recipe to counteract the sweetness."

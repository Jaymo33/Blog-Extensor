faqQ3: "What if my measuring jug doesn't have ml markings?"
faqA3: "If your jug only shows cups, remember that 1 US cup equals about 237 ml. Multiply by 3 to get 710 ml for 3.0 cups. Alternatively, use an online converter or refer to our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a> for quick reference."
faqQ4: "Why does my air fryer recipe require milk in ml instead of cups?"
faqA4: "Millilitres provide a more precise measurement than cups, which is crucial for air fryer cooking due to its fast, intense heat. Using ml ensures consistent results, especially for batters, sauces, or baked goods where liquid ratios affect texture and cooking time."

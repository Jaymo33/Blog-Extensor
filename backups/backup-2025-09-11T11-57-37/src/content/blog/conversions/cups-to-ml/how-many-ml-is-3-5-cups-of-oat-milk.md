faqQ1: "Is 3.5 cups of oat milk the same in ml for all recipes?"
faqA1: "Yes, 3.5 cups of oat milk always equals 828 ml in US measurements, which most recipes use. However, UK cup measurements differ slightly (994 ml for 3.5 cups), so always check your recipe's origin. For air fryer cooking, sticking to ml ensures accuracy."
faqQ2: "Can I use a scale to measure 3.5 cups of oat milk in ml?"
faqA2: "Yes, many digital kitchen scales have a ml mode for liquids like oat milk. Set your scale to ml, then pour until it reads 828 ml for 3.5 US cups. This method is often more precise than using measuring cups, especially for air fryer recipes."
faqQ3: "Does oat milk measure the same as dairy milk in cups to ml?"
faqA3: "Yes, oat milk and dairy milk have similar densities, so 3.5 cups of either equals 828 ml. However, oat milk may froth or separate differently when heated, so ml measurements help maintain consistency in recipes, especially for air fryer cooking."
faqQ4: "How do I adjust recipes if I only have a 250 ml measuring cup?"
faqA4: "For 3.5 cups (828 ml) of oat milk, use three full 250 ml cups (750 ml) plus 78 ml (about a third of the cup). Alternatively, measure 800 ml and add 28 ml (roughly two tablespoons) for a close approximation in air fryer recipes."

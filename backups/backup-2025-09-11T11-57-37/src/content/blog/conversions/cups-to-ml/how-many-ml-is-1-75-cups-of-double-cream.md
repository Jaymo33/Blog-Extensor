faqQ1: "Is 1.75 cups of double cream the same in the UK and USA?"
faqA1: "Yes, 1.75 cups of double cream is the same volume in both the UK and USA, equalling approximately 414 ml. However, double cream in the UK has a slightly higher fat content (around 48%) compared to heavy cream in the USA (36-40%). This difference can affect texture in air fryer recipes."
faqQ2: "Can I use single cream instead of double cream in air fryer recipes?"
faqA2: "You can substitute single cream, but the results will be less rich and creamy. Double cream’s higher fat content helps it hold up better under the air fryer’s heat. If using single cream, reduce the quantity slightly (by about 10-15%) to avoid a runny consistency."
faqQ3: "How do I store leftover double cream after measuring 1.75 cups?"
faqA3: "Store leftover double cream in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 3 days. You can also freeze it for longer storage, though it may separate slightly when thawed. Shake or whisk it before using in air fryer recipes."
faqQ4: "Why does my air fryer recipe with double cream turn out greasy?"
faqA4: "This usually happens if the cream isn’t evenly distributed or if the air fryer temperature is too high. Try mixing the cream thoroughly with other ingredients and reducing the cooking temperature by 10-15°C. Preheating the air fryer can also help prevent greasiness."

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Using the correct amount of buttermilk ensures your recipes turn out just right. Too much can make baked goods dense, while too little may leave them dry. Air fryer cooking relies on precision, especially when baking cakes or frying chicken. The 1.25 cups to ml conversion (296 ml) is a common measurement in many recipes.

<p>Buttermilk’s acidity also reacts with baking soda, helping batters rise. This makes accurate measuring crucial for texture and flavour. Whether you’re using UK or US cups, the ml conversion remains consistent. Always use a liquid measuring jug for the best results. If you’re unsure, our guide simplifies the process for hassle-free cooking.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure Buttermilk Correctly</h3>  
<p>For the most accurate results, pour buttermilk into a liquid measuring cup up to the 296 ml mark. Avoid using dry measuring cups, as they can lead to inconsistencies.

This method works for all air fryer recipes, from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>air fryer cakes</a> to marinades.</p>

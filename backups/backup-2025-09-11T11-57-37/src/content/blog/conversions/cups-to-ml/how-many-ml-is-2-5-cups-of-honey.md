faqQ1: "Is 2.5 cups of honey the same in the UK and USA?"
faqA1: "Yes, 2.5 cups of honey is the same volume in both the UK and USA. However, cup sizes can vary slightly in other countries, so always double-check if using international recipes."
faqQ2: "Can I use a kitchen scale instead of measuring cups for honey?"
faqA2: "Absolutely! Weighing honey is often more accurate. Since honey weighs about 340 grams per cup, 2.5 cups would be roughly 850 grams. This method eliminates sticky measuring cups."
faqQ3: "Does the type of honey affect the ml measurement?"
faqA3: "No, the ml measurement remains the same regardless of honey type (e.g., raw, manuka). However, thicker honey may take longer to pour, so greasing your measuring cup helps."
faqQ4: "How do I adjust cooking times when using honey in an air fryer?"
faqA4: "Honey can caramelise quickly, so reduce the temperature slightly or shorten cooking time. Always check your dish a few minutes early to prevent burning. For more tips, visit our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>air fryer recipe hub</a>."

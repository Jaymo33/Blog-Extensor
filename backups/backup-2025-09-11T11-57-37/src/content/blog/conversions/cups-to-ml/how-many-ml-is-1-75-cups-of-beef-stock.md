<h3>How to Measure Beef Stock Correctly</h3>  
<p>For the most accurate results, use a liquid measuring jug with clear millilitre markings. Pour the beef stock slowly to avoid spills and read the measurement at eye level. If you don’t have a jug, a kitchen scale can help—1.75 cups of beef stock weighs roughly 414 grams, as 1 ml of stock is about 1 gram.

faqQ1: "Is 1.25 cups of coconut milk the same in the UK and US?"
faqA1: "Yes, 1.25 cups of coconut milk equals 296 ml in both the UK and US. While cup sizes can vary slightly by country, this measurement remains consistent for liquid ingredients like coconut milk. Always use a liquid measuring cup for accuracy."
faqQ2: "Can I use canned coconut milk for air fryer recipes?"

faqA4: "If you don’t have a measuring cup, use a kitchen scale: 296 ml of coconut milk weighs about 280 grams. Alternatively, a standard mug holds roughly 250 ml, so 1.25 cups is just slightly more than one mugful. Stir well for consistency."

<h2>Why Accurate Conversions Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on precise ingredient ratios to achieve even cooking and perfect textures. Too much or too little liquid, like balsamic vinegar, can affect browning, crispiness, and flavour balance. For example, 3.75 cups of balsamic vinegar (887.21 ml) is a common quantity for marinades or reductions. If you’re preparing a batch of <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer glazed vegetables</a>, this measurement ensures the right acidity and sweetness.</p>  

<p>Using millilitres instead of cups eliminates guesswork, especially for UK cooks who typically work with metric measurements. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> simplifies these calculations, so you can focus on cooking rather than maths.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure 3.75 Cups of Balsamic Vinegar</h3>  
<p>For accuracy, use a liquid measuring cup with clear ml markings. Fill it to the 887 ml line, or measure 3 full cups (710 ml) plus 3/4 cup (177 ml) separately. If your recipe calls for 3.75 cups of balsamic vinegar in ml, a kitchen scale set to grams (1 ml = 1 g for vinegar) can also work. This method is handy for sticky ingredients like balsamic vinegar, which can cling to measuring cups.</p>

<h3>UK vs. US Cup Measurements</h3>  
<p>While 1 US cup equals 236.59 ml, UK cups historically used 284 ml (though metric is now standard).

faqQ1: "Can I use a kitchen scale instead of measuring cups for semolina?"
faqA1: "Absolutely! A kitchen scale is often more accurate for measuring semolina. Set it to ounces (2.5 oz for 0.5 cup) or grams (70g) for precise results, especially in air fryer recipes where consistency is key."
faqQ2: "Does the type of semolina affect the weight per 0.5 cup?"
faqA2: "Yes, finer semolina may weigh slightly less than coarse varieties due to packing density. However, the difference is minimal—around 2.4 to 2.6 oz per 0.5 cup. For air fryer recipes, either works well."
faqQ3: "How do I store leftover semolina after measuring 0.5 cup?"
faqA3: "Keep semolina in an airtight container in a cool, dry place. Proper storage ensures it stays fresh for months, ready for your next air fryer recipe."
faqQ4: "Can I substitute semolina with flour in air fryer recipes?"
faqA4: "While possible, flour won’t give the same crispiness as semolina. If substituting, use the same weight (2.5 oz per 0.5 cup) but expect a slightly different texture in your air-fried dishes."

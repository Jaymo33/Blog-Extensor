<p>0.66 cup of soy sauce equals approximately 5.28 ounces. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements can make or break a dish. Whether you're marinating chicken or whipping up a stir-fry, knowing the exact weight ensures consistency. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we focus on accuracy to help you cook with confidence. Let’s dive deeper into why this measurement matters.</p>  

<h2>Understanding the Conversion</h2>  
<p>Converting cups to ounces isn’t always straightforward, especially with liquids like soy sauce. A standard US cup holds 8 fluid ounces, but soy sauce has a different density. For 0.66 cup, the calculation is simple: multiply 8 ounces by 0.66 to get 5.28 ounces. This measurement is crucial for air fryer recipes, where even small deviations can affect texture and flavour. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more handy tips.</p>  

<p>Why does this matter? Air fryers cook food quickly, and imbalances in marinades or sauces can lead to uneven results. Too much soy sauce might make your dish overly salty, while too little could leave it bland. Precision ensures your meals turn out perfect every time. Whether you're cooking <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken</a> or tofu, accurate measurements are key.</p>  

<h3>Why Use Ounces Instead of Cups?</h3>  
<p>Ounces provide a more precise measurement than cups, especially for liquids. Cups can vary based on how you fill them, but ounces are consistent. This is why many professional chefs and air fryer enthusiasts prefer weighing ingredients. If you're serious about cooking, investing in a kitchen scale is a game-changer.

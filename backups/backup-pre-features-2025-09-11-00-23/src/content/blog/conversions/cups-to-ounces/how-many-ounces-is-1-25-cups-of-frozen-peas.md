faqQ1: "Can I use fresh peas instead of frozen in this measurement?"
faqA1: "Yes, but the weight differs slightly. Fresh peas are denser, so 1.25 cups would be about 11-12 ounces. Adjust cooking times as fresh peas cook faster in the air fryer than frozen ones."
faqQ2: "Why does my air fryer cook frozen peas unevenly?"
faqA2: "Uneven cooking usually means overcrowding. Even with 10 ounces (1.25 cups), spread peas in a single layer. Shake the basket halfway through cooking for best results. Some air fryer models have hotter spots that may require extra shaking."
faqQ3: "How long do I cook 1.25 cups of frozen peas in the air fryer?"
faqA3: "For basic heating, cook at 190°C for 6-8 minutes. For crispy peas, go 8-10 minutes. Times vary by air fryer size and model, so check after 5 minutes if it's your first time cooking this amount."
faqQ4: "Can I season the peas before air frying?"
faqA4: "Absolutely! Toss your 10 ounces of frozen peas with olive oil, salt, and your favourite spices before cooking. Garlic powder, paprika, or parmesan work wonderfully. Add seasonings after cooking if you prefer fresh herb flavours."

<h3>How to Measure Frozen Peas Correctly</h3>

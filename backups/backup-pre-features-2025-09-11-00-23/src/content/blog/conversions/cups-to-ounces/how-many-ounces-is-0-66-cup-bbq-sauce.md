faqQ1: "Can I use 0.66 cup of bbq sauce for vegetarian air fryer recipes?"
faqA1: "Absolutely! 0.66 cup of bbq sauce (5.28 ounces) works wonderfully with vegetarian options like cauliflower wings or tofu. The measurement remains the same whether you're cooking meat or plant-based proteins in your air fryer. Just adjust cooking times slightly for different ingredients."
faqQ2: "How does the thickness of bbq sauce affect the 0.66 cup to ounces conversion?"

faqQ4: "Can I substitute other sauces using the same 0.66 cup to ounces measurement?"
faqA4: "Yes, the 0.66 cup to 5.28-ounce conversion works for most liquid sauces like teriyaki or buffalo sauce. However, very thick sauces like mayonnaise or peanut sauce may differ slightly in weight. Always check specific conversions for alternative sauces when adapting air fryer recipes."

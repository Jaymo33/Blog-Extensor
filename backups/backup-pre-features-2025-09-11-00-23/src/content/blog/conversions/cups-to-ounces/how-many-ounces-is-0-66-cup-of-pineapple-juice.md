faqQ1: "Can I use canned pineapple juice instead of fresh for 0.66 cup measurements?"
faqA1: "Yes, canned pineapple juice works just as well as fresh for measuring 0.66 cup (5.28 oz). Just ensure it’s unsweetened if your recipe calls for it. The consistency is similar, so it won’t affect your air fryer results."
faqQ2: "How do I measure 0.66 cup of pineapple juice without a measuring cup?"
faqA2: "If you don’t have a measuring cup, use a kitchen scale to weigh out 5.28 ounces. Alternatively, 0.66 cup is roughly two-thirds of a standard cup, so you can estimate by filling a cup just over halfway."
faqQ3: "Does 0.66 cup of pineapple juice weigh the same as other liquids?"
faqA3: "Most liquids, like water or milk, weigh the same per cup (8 oz), so 0.66 cup would be 5.28 oz. Pineapple juice has a similar density, so the weight is nearly identical. Always double-check for thicker juices or syrups."
faqQ4: "Can I freeze 0.66 cup portions of pineapple juice for later use?"
faqA4: "Absolutely! Freezing 0.66 cup (5.28 oz) portions in ice cube trays or small containers is a great way to save pineapple juice for future air fryer recipes. Thaw it in the fridge before use for best results."

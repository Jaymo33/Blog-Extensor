faqQ1: "How many ounces are in half a cup of minced garlic?"
faqA1: "Half a cup of minced garlic equals approximately 4 ounces. This measurement is useful for smaller batches or when adjusting recipes. Always use a kitchen scale for the most accurate results, especially in air fryer cooking where precision matters."
faqQ2: "Does minced garlic weigh the same as chopped garlic?"
faqA2: "Minced garlic is slightly denser than chopped garlic due to its finer texture. One cup of minced garlic weighs about 8 ounces, while chopped garlic may be closer to 7 ounces. For air fryer recipes, stick to the specified preparation method for best results."
faqQ3: "Can I use jarred minced garlic instead of fresh?"
faqA3: "Yes, but jarred minced garlic often has a milder flavour. Use the same 1-cup-to-8-ounce ratio, but consider adding a bit more if you prefer a stronger taste. Fresh garlic tends to have a sharper, more vibrant flavour in air fryer dishes."
faqQ4: "How do I convert garlic powder to minced garlic?"
faqA4: "One teaspoon of garlic powder equals about two cloves of minced garlic. For one cup of minced garlic (48 cloves), you'd need roughly 24 teaspoons of powder. However, fresh minced garlic delivers better texture and flavour in air fryer recipes."

<h2>Why accurate garlic measurements matter</h2>  
<p>Garlic is a powerhouse ingredient that can make or break a dish. Too little, and your meal lacks depth; too much, and it overpowers other flavours.

Whether you're cooking chicken, vegetables, or seafood, getting the garlic right elevates the dish.</p>  

<p>Minced garlic is denser than whole cloves, so volume-to-weight conversions are key. A standard US cup holds about 8 ounces of minced garlic, but UK measurements may vary slightly. Always check your recipe's origin to ensure accuracy.

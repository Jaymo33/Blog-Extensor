<p>0.75 cup of rice flour equals approximately 3.5 ounces (99.22 grams). This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes, ensuring your baked goods or coatings turn out perfectly every time. Rice flour is a staple in gluten-free cooking, and knowing its weight helps maintain consistency in texture and taste.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Precision is key when using an air fryer, especially for baking. Unlike traditional ovens, air fryers circulate hot air rapidly, which can affect how ingredients behave. Too much or too little rice flour can alter the crispiness or density of your dish. For example, if you're making air fryer onion rings, the right amount of rice flour ensures a light, crispy coating.</p>  
<p>Rice flour is also popular for gluten-free recipes like air fryer tempura or crispy tofu. A slight variation in measurement can lead to a gummy or overly dry result. That’s why converting 0.75 cup of rice flour to ounces (3.5 oz) is so important.

<h2>How to Measure Rice Flour Correctly</h2>  
<p>Measuring rice flour by weight (ounces or grams) is more accurate than using cups, as it eliminates packing inconsistencies. To measure 0.75 cup of rice flour, fluff the flour with a spoon before lightly scooping it into a measuring cup. Level it off with a knife for precision. If you have a kitchen scale, weigh out 3.5 ounces for the most reliable results.</p>

<p>Rice flour is a versatile ingredient, often used for crispy coatings, gluten-free batters, and even thickening sauces. In the air fryer, it’s perfect for creating light, crunchy textures without deep-frying. Try it in recipes like air fryer chicken tenders or tempura vegetables for a healthier twist.</p>

faqQ1: "Can I use 0.375 cup of miso paste instead of miso soup?"
faqA1: "No, miso paste is much more concentrated than miso soup. If a recipe calls for 0.375 cup (3 oz) of miso soup, using the same amount of paste will make the dish far too salty. Instead, dilute miso paste with water or broth to match the consistency of miso soup."
faqQ2: "How does 0.375 cup of miso soup affect air fryer cooking times?"
faqA2: "Since miso soup is mostly liquid, using 0.375 cup (3 oz) in an air fryer may slightly increase cooking time due to evaporation. For best results, reduce other liquids in the recipe or add the miso soup towards the end of cooking to prevent over-drying."
faqQ3: "Is 0.375 cup of miso soup the same as 3 fluid ounces?"
faqA3: "Yes, in most cases, 0.375 cup of miso soup equals 3 fluid ounces. However, if your miso soup contains chunky ingredients like tofu or seaweed, the weight in ounces might be slightly higher due to the added solids."
faqQ4: "Can I freeze 0.375 cup portions of miso soup for later use?"
faqA4: "Absolutely! Freezing 0.375 cup (3 oz) portions of miso soup is a great way to have ready-to-use amounts for air fryer recipes. Just thaw in the fridge overnight or defrost in the microwave before adding to your dish."

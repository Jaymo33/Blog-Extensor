faqQ1: "Can I use canned chickpeas instead of dried for 0.375 cup measurements?"
faqA1: "Yes, you can use canned chickpeas, but make sure to drain and rinse them first. Canned chickpeas are pre-cooked, so they’ll have a slightly different texture when air-fried. For accurate measurements, 0.375 cup of drained canned chickpeas also weighs around 3 ounces."
faqQ2: "How do I store leftover chickpeas after measuring 0.375 cup?"
faqA2: "Store leftover chickpeas in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 3 days. If you’ve cooked them, they’ll keep for about 5 days. For longer storage, freeze them in portions—they’ll last up to 3 months and can be reheated straight from frozen in the air fryer."
faqQ3: "Why do my air-fried chickpeas turn out soggy?"
faqA3: "Soggy chickpeas are often caused by overcrowding the air fryer basket or not drying them properly before cooking. Make sure to pat them dry and cook in small batches. Also, shaking the basket halfway through helps them crisp up evenly."
faqQ4: "Can I use 0.375 cup of chickpeas in desserts?"
faqA4: "Absolutely! Chickpeas work well in desserts like blondies or cookie dough. Just blend them into a smooth paste before mixing with other ingredients. The mild flavour pairs well with sweeteners like maple syrup or chocolate. Check our dessert section for recipe ideas."

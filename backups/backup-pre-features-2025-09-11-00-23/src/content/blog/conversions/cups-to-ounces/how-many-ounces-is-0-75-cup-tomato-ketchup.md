faqQ1: "Can I use 0.75 cup of tomato ketchup for air fryer chicken wings?"
faqA1: "Absolutely! 0.75 cup (6 ounces) of tomato ketchup is perfect for coating a batch of air fryer chicken wings. Mix it with other ingredients like soy sauce, honey, or spices to create a delicious glaze. Apply the sauce during the last few minutes of cooking to prevent burning."
faqQ2: "How does 0.75 cup of tomato ketchup compare to other sauce measurements?"

faqQ3: "Is 0.75 cup of tomato ketchup the same weight as other liquids?"
faqA3: "No, different liquids have different weights. While 0.75 cup of tomato ketchup weighs about 6 ounces, water would weigh 6.3 ounces in the same volume. Ketchup is slightly less dense due to its sugar and tomato content. Always check specific conversions for accuracy in air fryer recipes."
faqQ4: "What's the best way to measure 0.75 cup of tomato ketchup without a measuring cup?"
faqA4: "If you don't have measuring cups, you can use a kitchen scale to measure 6 ounces of ketchup. Alternatively, a standard UK tablespoon holds about 0.5 ounces, so you'd need 12 level tablespoons to make 0.75 cup. For sticky ingredients like ketchup, a scale is often the most accurate method."

faqQ1: "Can I use a kitchen scale instead of measuring cups for lentils?"
faqA1: "Absolutely! A kitchen scale is often more accurate for measuring lentils, especially for small amounts like 0.25 cup (1.75 oz). Simply set your scale to ounces, tare the container, and add lentils until you reach the desired weight."
faqQ2: "Do lentils weigh the same before and after cooking?"
faqA2: "No, lentils absorb water and expand when cooked, so their weight increases. For example, 0.25 cup (1.75 oz) of dry lentils yields about 0.5 cup cooked. Always measure dry lentils for recipes specifying uncooked amounts."
faqQ3: "How long do lentils take to cook in an air fryer?"
faqA3: "Pre-soaked lentils cook in about 10-12 minutes at 180°C in the air fryer. For unsoaked lentils, extend the time to 15-18 minutes, shaking the basket halfway for even cooking."
faqQ4: "Are lentils a good protein source for air fryer meals?"
faqA4: "Yes! Lentils pack plant-based protein and fiber, making them ideal for air-fried veggie patties or crispy snacks. A 0.25-cup (1.75 oz) serving provides roughly 12g of protein, perfect for healthy meals."

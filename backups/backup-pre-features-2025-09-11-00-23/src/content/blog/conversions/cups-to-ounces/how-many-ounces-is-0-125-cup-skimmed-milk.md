faqQ1: "Can I use whole milk instead of skimmed milk for 0.125 cup measurements?"
faqA1: "Yes, you can substitute whole milk for skimmed milk in the same 0.125 cup (1 oz) quantity. However, whole milk has a higher fat content, which may slightly alter the texture of your dish. For air fryer recipes, this could result in a richer, slightly crispier outcome."
faqQ2: "How do I measure 0.125 cup of skimmed milk without a measuring cup?"
faqA2: "If you don't have a measuring cup, you can use a tablespoon to measure 0.125 cup of skimmed milk. Since 1 cup equals 16 tablespoons, 0.125 cup is equivalent to 2 tablespoons. Alternatively, a kitchen scale set to ounces will give you the exact 1 oz measurement needed."
faqQ3: "Does 0.125 cup of skimmed milk weigh the same as other liquids in an air fryer recipe?"
faqA3: "While 0.125 cup of skimmed milk equals 1 oz by volume, the weight may vary slightly for other liquids due to density differences. For example, water also measures 1 oz per 0.125 cup, but thicker liquids like cream may weigh more. Always check specific conversions for accuracy in air fryer cooking."
faqQ4: "Why do some air fryer recipes use 0.125 cup of skimmed milk?"
faqA4: "Air fryer recipes often use small amounts like 0.125 cup (1 oz) of skimmed milk to maintain balance in coatings or batters. This quantity adds moisture without making the mixture too wet, ensuring crispy results. It's commonly used in light batters, glazes, or marinades for optimal texture."

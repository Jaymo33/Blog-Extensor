faqQ1: "Does the type of protein powder affect the cup to ounce conversion?"
faqA1: "Yes, different protein powders have varying densities. Whey protein is typically lighter than plant-based options like pea or rice protein. Always check your specific brand's packaging for the most accurate conversion."
faqQ2: "Can I use the same conversion for other dry ingredients in my air fryer?"
faqA2: "No, each dry ingredient has its own density. Flour, sugar, and protein powder all convert differently between cups and ounces. For best results, use a kitchen scale or refer to specific conversion charts."
faqQ3: "How can I measure 1.75 cups without a measuring cup?"
faqA3: "You can use a standard mug (about 250ml) as a rough guide - 1.75 cups would be roughly 1 mug plus 3/4 of another. However, for precise baking in your air fryer, investing in proper measuring cups is recommended."
faqQ4: "Why does my air fryer protein recipe turn out dry sometimes?"
faqA4: "Using too much protein powder can absorb excess moisture. Stick to the 1.75 cups (14 oz) measurement and consider adding a tablespoon of applesauce or yogurt to maintain moisture in your air fryer creations."

<h2>Why accurate protein powder measurements matter</h2>  
<p>Using the correct amount of protein powder ensures your recipes turn out perfectly every time. Too much powder can make baked goods dense, while too little might leave them lacking in protein. Air fryer recipes, like protein muffins or energy bites, rely on precise measurements for texture and taste. If you're meal prepping, accuracy helps maintain nutritional consistency.

<h3>How to measure protein powder correctly</h3>  
<p>For the most accurate results, use a kitchen scale to weigh your protein powder in ounces. Scooping directly from the bag can lead to inconsistencies due to settling. Fluff the powder lightly with a spoon before measuring to avoid compacting it. If you don't have a scale, spoon the powder into a measuring cup and level it off. This method works well for recipes like air fryer protein pancakes.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for 1.75 cups of protein powder</h2>  
<p>This amount is perfect for batch cooking protein-rich treats. You could make a large batch of protein bars, enough for a week's worth of snacks. It's also ideal for protein-packed desserts like air fryer brownies or cookies. Many fitness enthusiasts use this quantity for meal prep shakes or overnight oats.

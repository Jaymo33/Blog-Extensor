faqQ1: "Can I use evaporated milk instead of condensed milk in air fryer recipes?"
faqA1: "Evaporated milk and condensed milk aren’t interchangeable. Condensed milk is sweetened, while evaporated milk is unsweetened. Using evaporated milk will result in a less sweet and less creamy texture. If you’re in a pinch, you can mix evaporated milk with sugar, but it won’t be exactly the same."
faqQ2: "How do I store leftover condensed milk after measuring 0.66 cup?"
faqA2: "Transfer any leftover condensed milk to an airtight container and refrigerate. It will keep for up to two weeks. Make sure to press a piece of cling film directly onto the surface to prevent a skin from forming. You can also freeze it for up to three months."
faqQ3: "Why is my air fryer recipe with condensed milk too runny?"
faqA3: "This could be due to using too much condensed milk or not cooking it long enough. Always measure carefully – 0.66 cup should be exactly 5.28 ounces. Also, some recipes need time to set after cooking, especially desserts like flans or custards."
faqQ4: "Can I make my own condensed milk for air fryer recipes?"
faqA4: "Yes, you can make condensed milk by simmering regular milk and sugar until reduced by about half. However, homemade versions may be slightly thinner than canned. For best results in air fryer recipes, stick to the measured amounts – 0.66 cup (5.28 ounces) of store-bought condensed milk works perfectly."

This is especially important for desserts like flans or custards, where texture is key.</p>

<h2>How to measure 0.66 cup of condensed milk</h2>
<p>Measuring condensed milk can be tricky due to its thick, sticky consistency. For 0.66 cup, you can use a liquid measuring cup or a kitchen scale. If using a scale, 5.28 ounces is your target. This method is more accurate and avoids the mess of sticky measuring cups.</p>
<p>For those who prefer visual cues, 0.66 cup is roughly two-thirds of a standard cup.

<h3>Tips for working with condensed milk in air fryers</h3>
<p>Condensed milk can caramelise quickly in an air fryer, so keep an eye on cooking times. For best results, use it in recipes where it’s mixed with other ingredients, like batters or fillings. If you’re making a sauce, consider diluting it slightly to prevent burning. And don’t forget to clean your air fryer basket afterwards – sticky residues can be tough to remove.

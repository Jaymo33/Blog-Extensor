faqQ1: "Can I use a UK measuring cup for 1.66 cups of hoisin sauce?"
faqA1: "Yes, but note that UK and US cup sizes differ slightly. A UK cup is 284 ml, while a US cup is 240 ml. For accuracy, use a kitchen scale to weigh 13.28 ounces directly, or adjust the measurement if using UK cups. This ensures your air fryer recipe turns out as intended."

faqQ3: "Does the brand of hoisin sauce affect the weight per cup?"
faqA3: "Yes, thicker or sweeter hoisin sauces may weigh slightly more per cup due to density differences. For best results, check the label for weight per serving or use a scale. In most cases, 1.66 cups will still be close to 13.28 ounces."
faqQ4: "What’s the best way to clean hoisin sauce from my air fryer basket?"
faqA4: "Soak the basket in warm, soapy water to loosen sticky residue, then scrub gently with a non-abrasive sponge. For stubborn spots, use a paste of baking soda and water. Regular cleaning prevents buildup and keeps your air fryer working efficiently."

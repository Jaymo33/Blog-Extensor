faqQ1: "Can I use whole mushrooms instead of sliced for 1.66 cups?"
faqA1: "Yes, but whole mushrooms will weigh slightly more due to less air space. For 1.66 cups, expect about 5–5.5 ounces. Adjust cooking time by 1–2 minutes in the air fryer."
faqQ2: "How do I store leftover sliced mushrooms after measuring 1.66 cups?"
faqA2: "Store unused mushrooms in a paper bag in the fridge for up to 3 days. For longer storage, sauté and freeze them in 4.5-ounce (1.66-cup) portions for future air fryer meals."
faqQ3: "Does the thickness of the slices affect the ounce conversion for 1.66 cups?"
faqA3: "Thicker slices may compact slightly, adding 0.2–0.3 ounces. For recipes requiring precision, like duxelles, weigh the mushrooms after slicing for the most accurate 4.5-ounce measure."
faqQ4: "Can I substitute dried mushrooms for 1.66 cups of fresh sliced ones?"
faqA4: "Dried mushrooms expand when rehydrated. Use 0.5 ounces (14g) of dried mushrooms, which will yield roughly 1.66 cups (4.5 oz) once soaked. Adjust air fryer time to account for extra moisture."

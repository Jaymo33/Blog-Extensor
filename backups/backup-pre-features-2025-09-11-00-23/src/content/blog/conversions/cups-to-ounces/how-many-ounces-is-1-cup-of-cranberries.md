faqQ1: "Can I use dried cranberries instead of fresh in air fryer recipes?"
faqA1: "Yes, but you'll need to adjust quantities. Dried cranberries are more concentrated, so use about 1/3 cup (1.3 oz) to replace 1 cup (4 oz) of fresh. Soak them briefly in warm water first to prevent drying out during cooking."
faqQ2: "Do cranberries weigh the same when frozen?"
faqA2: "Frozen cranberries weigh slightly more due to ice crystals, but the difference is minimal. You can still use the 1 cup = 4 oz measurement. Just account for extra liquid released during cooking by reducing other wet ingredients slightly."
faqQ3: "How do I prevent cranberries from bursting in the air fryer?"
faqA3: "Prick each cranberry with a toothpick before cooking to release steam gradually. Alternatively, cook at a slightly lower temperature (160°C) for longer. This gentle approach helps maintain their shape while still softening them."
faqQ4: "Can I substitute other berries using the same 1 cup to ounce conversion?"
faqA4: "No, different berries have varying densities. While 1 cup of cranberries is 4 oz, blueberries are about 5 oz per cup, and raspberries are roughly 4.5 oz. Always check specific conversions for the berry you're using in air fryer recipes."

<h2>Why measuring cranberries accurately matters</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of cranberries ensures balanced flavours and textures in your air fryer dishes. Too many cranberries can make a recipe overly tart, while too few might leave it bland. For recipes like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer cranberry muffins</a>, precision is crucial.</p>  

<p>Air fryers cook food quickly, so ingredient ratios matter even more than in conventional ovens. A slight variation in cranberry quantity can affect moisture levels and cooking times. That's why converting 1 cup of cranberries to ounces (4 oz) helps maintain recipe integrity.</p>  

<h3>How to measure cranberries for air frying</h3>  
<p>For best results, use a kitchen scale to weigh your cranberries. If you don't have one, lightly pack the cranberries into a measuring cup without crushing them. This method gives you the closest approximation to 4 ounces per cup.</p>

<h2>Tips for cooking with cranberries in air fryers</h2>  
<p>Since air fryers circulate hot air, cranberries cook faster than in conventional ovens. For even cooking, shake the basket halfway through. This prevents berries from sticking or burning, especially when making <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer desserts</a>.</p>  

<p>After cooking, always clean your air fryer promptly. Cranberry juices can stick to surfaces if left to cool. Use our recommended <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner</a> to maintain your appliance's performance.</p>

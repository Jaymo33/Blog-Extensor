faqQ1: "Can I use a dry measuring cup for Worcestershire sauce?"
faqA1: "No, dry measuring cups aren’t ideal for liquids like Worcestershire sauce. Use a liquid measuring cup with clear markings for accuracy. If you only have dry cups, weigh the sauce to confirm it’s 10.64 ounces for 1.33 cups."
faqQ2: "Does the brand of Worcestershire sauce affect the ounce measurement?"
faqA2: "Most brands have a similar density, so 1.33 cups should equal 10.64 ounces. However, thicker or imported sauces might vary slightly. When in doubt, weigh it for precision, especially for air fryer recipes."
faqQ3: "How do I adjust the recipe if I only have a 1-cup measure?"
faqA3: "Measure 1 cup (8 ounces) first, then add roughly 1/3 cup (2.64 ounces) to reach 1.33 cups total. Alternatively, use a kitchen scale to measure 10.64 ounces directly for perfect results."
faqQ4: "Can I substitute Worcestershire sauce with soy sauce in air fryer recipes?"
faqA4: "Yes, but adjust the quantity since soy sauce is saltier. Use about 3/4 the amount of Worcestershire sauce (around 8 ounces for 1.33 cups). Taste as you go to avoid over-seasoning your dish."

faqQ1: "Can I use grams instead of ounces for measuring tomato paste?"
faqA1: "Yes, you can use grams for more precision. 2.5 cups of tomato paste (20 ounces) equals roughly 567 grams. A kitchen scale set to grams will give you the most accurate measurement, especially for air fryer recipes where consistency is key."
faqQ2: "How long does 2.5 cups of tomato paste last in the fridge?"
faqA2: "Once opened, tomato paste lasts about 5-7 days in the fridge if stored in an airtight container. For longer storage, freeze portions in ice cube trays—each cube is roughly 1 ounce, making it easy to thaw only what you need for air fryer recipes."
faqQ3: "Can I substitute tomato sauce for tomato paste in air fryer recipes?"
faqA3: "You can, but you’ll need to adjust quantities. Tomato sauce is less concentrated, so use 5 cups (40 ounces) to match the intensity of 2.5 cups (20 ounces) of tomato paste. Reduce other liquids in the recipe to compensate for the added moisture."
faqQ4: "What’s the best way to clean tomato paste residue from my air fryer?"
faqA4: "For stubborn tomato paste stains, use a soft sponge and warm, soapy water. Avoid abrasive cleaners that could damage the non-stick coating.

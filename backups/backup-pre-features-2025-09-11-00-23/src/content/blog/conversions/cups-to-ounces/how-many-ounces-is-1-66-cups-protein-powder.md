<h2>How to measure protein powder correctly</h2>  
<p>Measuring protein powder can be tricky due to its varying density. Scooping directly from the bag can lead to inconsistent amounts, so it’s best to use a kitchen scale for ounces or a measuring cup for volume. If you don’t have a scale, fluff the powder first to avoid compacting it.</p>

<h3>Common mistakes when measuring protein powder</h3>  
<p>One of the biggest mistakes is tapping or shaking the measuring cup, which compacts the powder and leads to excess. Another is using a heaped scoop instead of a levelled one. Both can result in more protein powder than intended, altering the texture of your air fryer dishes.</p>

<p>0.375 cup of chopped garlic equals approximately 3 ounces (or 85 grams) in UK measurements. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise ingredient quantities can make all the difference. Whether you're preparing a garlic-infused dish or adjusting a recipe, knowing this measurement ensures consistent results every time.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Garlic Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Garlic is a powerhouse ingredient that can transform any dish, but too much or too little can throw off the balance. In an air fryer, where cooking times are shorter, precise measurements ensure even cooking and perfect flavour distribution. For example, if you're making garlic butter shrimp or roasted garlic potatoes, 0.375 cup of chopped garlic (3 ounces) provides just the right punch without overpowering.</p>  

<p>At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we emphasise the importance of accurate measurements for air fryer success. Whether you're a beginner or a seasoned cook, getting the garlic quantity right can elevate your dish from good to exceptional.

<h2>How to Measure Chopped Garlic Correctly</h2>  
<p>Measuring chopped garlic can be tricky due to its irregular shape. For 0.375 cup (3 ounces), lightly pack the garlic into a measuring cup without pressing too hard. Overpacking can lead to more garlic than needed, altering the dish's flavour. If you don’t have a measuring cup, a kitchen scale is your best friend—simply weigh out 85 grams for accuracy.</p>  

<h3>Using Garlic in Air Fryer Recipes</h3>  
<p>Garlic works wonders in air fryer dishes, from marinades to crispy toppings. For example, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>garlic butter chicken</a> recipe relies on the perfect 0.375 cup (3 ounces) of chopped garlic for that rich, savoury taste. Too little, and the dish lacks depth; too much, and it becomes bitter.</p>  

<h2>Common Mistakes When Measuring Garlic</h2>  
<p>One frequent error is confusing minced garlic with chopped garlic. Minced garlic is finer, so 0.375 cup would weigh slightly less. Always check whether your recipe specifies chopped or minced. Another mistake is using old garlic, which loses potency—fresh garlic ensures the best flavour for your 3-ounce measurement.</p>

<h2>Converting Other Garlic Measurements</h2>  
<p>If your recipe calls for cloves instead of cups, here’s a quick reference: one medium clove yields about 1 teaspoon chopped garlic. For 0.375 cup (3 ounces), you’d need roughly 18 cloves. This conversion is handy when scaling recipes up or down for your air fryer.</p>  

<h3>Storing Leftover Chopped Garlic</h3>  
<p>If you have extra chopped garlic, store it in an airtight container in the fridge for up to a week. For longer storage, freeze it in ice cube trays—each cube holds about 1 tablespoon, making it easy to portion out 0.375 cup (3 ounces) for future recipes.</p>

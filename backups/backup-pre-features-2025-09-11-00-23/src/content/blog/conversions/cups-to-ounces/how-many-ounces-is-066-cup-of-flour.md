<p>0.66 cup of flour equals approximately 2.64 ounces (oz) in the UK. This conversion is essential for air fryer baking, where precision ensures perfect texture and consistency. Whether you’re making cakes, cookies, or bread, knowing how to convert 0.66 cup of flour to ounces helps avoid kitchen mishaps.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Flour Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Getting the right amount of flour is crucial for air fryer recipes. Too much flour can make baked goods dense, while too little may cause them to crumble. For example, if you’re preparing a cake using your air fryer, 0.66 cup of flour (2.64 oz) ensures the batter isn’t too thick or thin. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more handy measurement tips.</p>  

<p>Many UK bakers prefer weighing ingredients like flour for consistency. Unlike volume measurements (cups), weight (ounces) isn’t affected by how tightly packed the flour is. This is especially useful for air fryer recipes, where even small deviations can impact cooking times and results.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure 0.66 Cup of Flour Correctly</h3>  
<p>To measure 0.66 cup of flour accurately, spoon the flour into a measuring cup and level it off with a knife. Avoid scooping directly from the bag, as this compacts the flour and leads to excess. For best results, use a digital scale to confirm 2.64 oz—ideal for air fryer baking.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for 0.66 Cup of Flour</h2>  
<p>This measurement is perfect for small-batch baking in your air fryer. Think single-serving cakes, cookies, or even coating for chicken or fish. If you’re meal prepping, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> for inspiration.</p>

<h3>Converting Other Flour Amounts</h3>  
<p>If you need to adjust your recipe, remember that 1 cup of flour equals roughly 4 oz in the UK. So, 0.33 cup is about 1.32 oz, and 1.5 cups would be 6 oz. Keeping a conversion chart handy simplifies baking in your air fryer.</p>  

<h2>Tips for Air Fryer Baking with Flour</h2>  
<p>Always preheat your air fryer for even cooking. When using 0.66 cup of flour (2.64 oz), lightly grease the baking pan or use parchment paper to prevent sticking. For cleanup, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner guide</a> makes maintenance a breeze.</p>  

<p>Experiment with different flours, like whole wheat or gluten-free, but note their weights may vary slightly. For example, almond flour is lighter, so 0.66 cup might weigh closer to 2.2 oz. Adjust recipes accordingly for the best air fryer results.</p>

faqQ1: "Can I use 2 cups of any type of jam for air fryer recipes?"
faqA1: "Most jams work well, but thicker varieties like marmalade or fruit preserves may need thinning with water or juice. Avoid sugar-free jams unless specified, as they can behave differently under heat. Always check recipe notes for best results."
faqQ2: "How do I convert 2 cups of jam to grams?"
faqA2: "Since 2 cups of jam equal 16 ounces, this converts to approximately 454 grams. For precise baking, use a kitchen scale. Grams are more accurate for international recipes or when scaling ingredients."
faqQ3: "Why does my air fryer jam glaze burn sometimes?"
faqA3: "High sugar content in jam can caramelise quickly in air fryers. To prevent burning, apply glazes in the last 5 minutes of cooking or dilute jam with a splash of water. Lower temperatures (160°C) also help."
faqQ4: "Can I freeze leftover jam measured in cups or ounces?"
faqA4: "Yes, jam freezes well in airtight containers. Label with the measurement (e.g., \"16 oz/2 cups\") for easy use later. Thaw in the fridge overnight before reheating or using in recipes."

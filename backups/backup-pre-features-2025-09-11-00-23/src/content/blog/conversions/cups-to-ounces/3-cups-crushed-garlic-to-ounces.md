faqQ1: "Does the type of garlic affect the 3 cups to ounces conversion?"
faqA1: "Yes, the type of garlic can slightly affect the conversion. Freshly crushed garlic tends to be more voluminous than pre-packaged crushed garlic, which may be more densely packed. For most recipes, the standard 3 cups = 24 ounces conversion works well, but for precision, it's best to weigh your garlic if possible."
faqQ2: "How should I store leftover crushed garlic after measuring out 3 cups?"
faqA2: "Leftover crushed garlic can be stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 2 weeks. For longer storage, mix it with a bit of olive oil and freeze in ice cube trays. When you need garlic for an air fryer recipe, simply pop out a cube and add it directly to your dish."
faqQ3: "Can I use this 3 cups to ounces conversion for minced garlic instead of crushed?"
faqA3: "While minced and crushed garlic are similar, minced garlic is typically finer and may pack more densely. The 3 cups = 24 ounces conversion still works as a general guide, but you might find you need slightly less minced garlic by volume to achieve the same weight. When in doubt, weighing is most accurate."
faqQ4: "Why do air fryer recipes often specify weight measurements for ingredients like garlic?"
faqA4: "Air fryers cook food quickly and evenly, so precise measurements ensure consistent results. Weight measurements (ounces) are more accurate than volume (cups) because how you pack ingredients can vary. This is especially important for potent ingredients like garlic where a small measurement difference can significantly impact flavour."

<p>3 cups of crushed garlic equals approximately 24 ounces (or 680 grams) in the UK. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements can make or break a dish.

<h2>Why accurate garlic measurements matter</h2>
<p>Garlic is a powerhouse ingredient that can elevate any dish, but too much or too little can throw off the balance. In an air fryer, where cooking times are shorter, precise measurements are even more critical. Overloading with garlic might lead to uneven cooking or overpowering flavours, while skimping could leave your dish lacking depth.</p>

It's particularly useful for batch cooking or when scaling up family favourites like garlic bread or roasted vegetables. Remember that fresh garlic will measure differently than pre-crushed varieties, so always check your packaging.</p>

<h2>Converting cups to ounces for air fryer recipes</h2>
<p>The standard conversion for crushed garlic is 1 cup = 8 ounces, making 3 cups equal to 24 ounces.

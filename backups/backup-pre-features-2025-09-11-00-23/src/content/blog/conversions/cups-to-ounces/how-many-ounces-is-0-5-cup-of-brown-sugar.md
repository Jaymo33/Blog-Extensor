faqQ1: "Does packed brown sugar measure differently to loose brown sugar?"
faqA1: "Yes, packed brown sugar will give you a more accurate measurement. When a recipe calls for 0.5 cup (4 ounces) of brown sugar, it typically means packed. Loose sugar might result in using less than the required amount, which could affect your air fryer recipe's outcome."
faqQ2: "Can I use white sugar instead of brown sugar in air fryer recipes?"
faqA2: "While you can substitute white sugar, the results will differ. Brown sugar's moisture and molasses content affect texture and browning in air fryer cooking. For best results when a recipe specifies 0.5 cup (4 ounces) of brown sugar, it's better to use brown sugar."
faqQ3: "How do I measure 0.5 cup of brown sugar without a measuring cup?"
faqA3: "If you don't have a measuring cup, you can use scales to measure out 4 ounces of brown sugar. Alternatively, 0.5 cup is roughly equivalent to 8 tablespoons. Remember to pack the sugar firmly for accurate measurement in your air fryer recipes."
faqQ4: "Why does my air fryer recipe with 0.5 cup brown sugar burn?"
faqA4: "Air fryers cook faster than conventional ovens, and sugar caramelises quickly. If your recipe with 0.5 cup (4 ounces) of brown sugar is burning, try reducing the temperature by 10-15Â°C or checking it earlier. The intense heat can cause sugars to over-brown if left unattended."

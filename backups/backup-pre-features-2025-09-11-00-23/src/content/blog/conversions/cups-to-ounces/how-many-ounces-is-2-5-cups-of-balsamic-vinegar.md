faqQ1: "Is 2.5 cups of balsamic vinegar the same as 20 ounces?"
faqA1: "Yes, 2.5 cups of balsamic vinegar equals approximately 20 fluid ounces (or 19.7 oz for precise measurements). This conversion is based on the standard US cup measurement, where 1 cup of liquid is 8 fluid ounces. For UK cooks, it’s helpful to note that metric conversions may vary slightly, but 20 oz is a practical rule of thumb."
faqQ2: "Can I use a kitchen scale to measure 2.5 cups of balsamic vinegar in ounces?"
faqA2: "Absolutely! A kitchen scale gives the most accurate measurement. Pour 2.5 cups of balsamic vinegar into a bowl on the scale—it should read around 19.7 ounces. This method is especially useful for thick liquids like balsamic vinegar, where volume measurements can sometimes be inconsistent due to viscosity."
faqQ3: "How does balsamic vinegar behave differently in an air fryer compared to other liquids?"
faqA3: "Balsamic vinegar’s high sugar content means it caramelises quickly in an air fryer’s intense heat. When using 2.5 cups (20 oz), watch closely to prevent burning—reduce heat or cooking time if needed. Its sticky consistency also means residues can build up, so clean your air fryer promptly after use."
faqQ4: "What’s the best way to reduce 2.5 cups of balsamic vinegar for a glaze?"
faqA4: "Simmer 2.5 cups (20 oz) of balsamic vinegar in a saucepan until it thickens to half its volume, about 15–20 minutes. For air fryer use, brush the reduced glaze onto foods during the last few minutes of cooking. This prevents burning while adding glossy, tangy sweetness to dishes like roasted veggies or chicken."

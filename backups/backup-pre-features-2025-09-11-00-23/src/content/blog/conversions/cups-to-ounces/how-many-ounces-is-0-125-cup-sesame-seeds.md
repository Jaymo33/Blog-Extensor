faqQ1: "Can I use toasted sesame seeds instead of raw for 0.125 cup measurements?"
faqA1: "Yes, toasted sesame seeds can be used in the same 0.125 cup (0.6 oz) quantity, but they’ll have a stronger flavour. Toasting reduces moisture, so the weight remains roughly the same. Adjust other seasonings if needed to balance the taste."
faqQ2: "How do I convert 0.125 cup of sesame seeds to grams?"
faqA2: "0.125 cup of sesame seeds is about 17 grams. This conversion is handy for recipes requiring metric measurements. Use a kitchen scale for the most accurate results, especially in air fryer cooking where precision matters."
faqQ3: "Why does my air fryer recipe call for exactly 0.125 cup of sesame seeds?"
faqA3: "Recipes specify 0.125 cup (0.6 oz) to ensure even coating and flavour distribution. Too many seeds can burn or create uneven textures, while too few may not deliver the intended taste. Always measure carefully for best results."
faqQ4: "Can I substitute flaxseeds for sesame seeds in a 0.125 cup measurement?"
faqA4: "Yes, but flaxseeds have a different texture and flavour. Use the same 0.125 cup (0.6 oz) amount, but note the taste will differ. Flaxseeds also absorb more moisture, so adjust cooking times slightly if needed."

<p>0.125 cup of sesame seeds equals approximately 0.6 ounces (or roughly 17 grams). This measurement is essential for air fryer recipes where precision ensures perfect results. Whether you're sprinkling sesame seeds over salmon or mixing them into a crispy coating, knowing the exact weight helps avoid over or under-seasoning.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on even heat distribution, so ingredient quantities must be precise. Too many sesame seeds can lead to uneven cooking, while too few might leave your dish lacking flavour. For recipes like sesame-crusted tofu or crispy chicken, 0.125 cup (0.6 oz) is a common measurement. If you're unsure, check our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for quick reference.</p>  

<p>Many air fryer recipes, especially those for <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken</a> or <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetables</a>, call for small amounts of sesame seeds. Measuring 0.125 cup ensures consistency, whether you're baking or toasting them. For best results, use a kitchen scale if possible—especially when working with seeds, which can vary in density.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure 0.125 Cup of Sesame Seeds Without a Scale</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a scale, use a measuring cup and fill it to the 1/8 cup mark. Lightly shake the cup to settle the seeds, but don’t pack them down. This method gives you roughly 0.6 oz, though slight variations may occur. For more precision, consider investing in a digital scale—it’s a game-changer for air fryer cooking.</p>  

<h2>Common Recipes Using 0.125 Cup Sesame Seeds</h2>

<h3>Storing Sesame Seeds for Freshness</h3>

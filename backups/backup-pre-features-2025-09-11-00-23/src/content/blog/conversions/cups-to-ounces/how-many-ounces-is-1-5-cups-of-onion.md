faqQ1: "Does the type of onion affect the weight per cup?"
faqA1: "Yes, but minimally. Red, white, and sweet onions all weigh roughly 4 ounces per cup when chopped. Sweet onions might be slightly denser, but the difference is negligible for most recipes. Always measure after chopping for accuracy."
faqQ2: "Can I use frozen onions instead of fresh for 1.5 cups?"
faqA2: "Absolutely! Frozen chopped onions are pre-measured and often list cup-to-ounce conversions on the package. Thaw and drain excess liquid before air frying to prevent sogginess. One 10-oz bag typically contains about 2.5 cups."
faqQ3: "How should I adjust air fryer time for 1.5 cups of onion?"
faqA3: "At 6 ounces (1.5 cups), cook onions at 180°C for 8–12 minutes, shaking halfway. For caramelisation, extend time to 15 minutes. Always check progress, as air fryer models vary. Overcrowding may require batch cooking."
faqQ4: "Why does my 1.5 cups of onion measurement look different after cooking?"
faqA4: "Onions shrink significantly as moisture evaporates. Raw 1.5 cups (6 oz) may reduce to 1/2 cup when caramelised. For consistent results, weigh after chopping but before cooking. This is especially important for meal prepping."

<p>1.5 cups of chopped onion equals approximately 6 ounces (170 grams). This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements can affect texture and cooking time.

<h2>Why accurate onion measurements matter in air frying</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on even heat distribution, and incorrect onion quantities can lead to uneven cooking. Too many onions might steam instead of crisp, while too few could burn quickly. Measuring 1.5 cups of onion in ounces (6 oz) helps maintain balance, especially in recipes like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable dishes</a>. Precision ensures your onions caramelise or crisp perfectly every time.</p>  

<p>Different onion types (red, white, or sweet) have slight weight variations, but 1.5 cups generally stays close to 6 ounces. For best results, use a kitchen scale if possible. If you’re prepping ahead, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a> includes portioned ideas to simplify meal planning.</p>  

<h3>How to measure 1.5 cups of onion without a scale</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a scale, lightly pack chopped onions into a measuring cup until slightly heaped. Avoid pressing down, as this compacts the onions and skews the weight. One medium onion (about 2.5 inches in diameter) yields roughly 1 cup chopped, so 1.5 cups would be 1.5 medium onions.

<h2>Common recipes using 1.5 cups of onion</h2>  
<p>Many air fryer favourites call for this quantity, such as fajitas, stuffed peppers, or onion-heavy casseroles. Since 1.5 cups of onion equals 6 ounces, you can adjust recipes confidently. For example, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/beef>beef and onion stir-fry</a> relies on this ratio for optimal flavour. Always distribute onions evenly in the air fryer basket to prevent clumping.</p>  

<p>Caramelised onions in the air fryer need precise measurements to avoid burning. At 6 ounces (1.5 cups), they’ll cook evenly with a light oil coating.

<h3>Converting other onion quantities to ounces</h3>  
<p>For smaller batches, 1 cup of onion equals 4 ounces, while 2 cups equal 8 ounces. These conversions help scale recipes up or down. Remember that grated or minced onions may weigh slightly more per cup due to density. Bookmark our site for quick reference when adapting family-sized meals to smaller portions.</p>

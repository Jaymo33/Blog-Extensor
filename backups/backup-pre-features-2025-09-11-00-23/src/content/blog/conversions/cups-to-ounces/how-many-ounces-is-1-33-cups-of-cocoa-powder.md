<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Baking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers cook food quickly and evenly, but inaccurate measurements can lead to dry or dense results. Cocoa powder, in particular, needs careful weighing—too much can make desserts bitter, while too little leaves them bland. Using 1.33 cups of cocoa powder (4.8 oz) ensures consistency.

<p>British bakers often use metric measurements, but many recipes still list cups. Converting 1.33 cups of cocoa powder to ounces bridges this gap. A kitchen scale is the best tool, but if you don’t have one, spooning and levelling the cocoa powder works too.

<h3>How to Measure 1.33 Cups of Cocoa Powder Without a Scale</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a scale, use the spoon-and-level method. Lightly spoon cocoa powder into a measuring cup until it’s heaped, then level it off with a knife. Repeat until you’ve filled 1.33 cups (about 4.8 oz). Avoid packing the powder, as this adds extra weight and skews results.

<h2>Common Mistakes When Measuring Cocoa Powder</h2>  
<p>One mistake is using a liquid measuring cup for dry ingredients like cocoa powder. Dry cups have straight sides for accuracy, while liquid cups have spouts. Another error is scooping directly from the bag—this compacts the powder, leading to more than 4.8 oz for 1.33 cups. Always fluff the cocoa powder first. Need cleaning tips?

<p>Humidity can also affect cocoa powder’s weight. In damp climates, it may clump, making 1.33 cups heavier than 4.8 oz. Sifting before measuring helps. For perfectly measured ingredients, store cocoa powder in an airtight container. Find more storage hacks at <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>.</p>

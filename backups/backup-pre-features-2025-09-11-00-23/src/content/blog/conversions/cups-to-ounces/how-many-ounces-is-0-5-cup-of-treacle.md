faqQ1: "Can I use golden syrup instead of treacle in my air fryer recipe?"
faqA1: "Yes, golden syrup can substitute treacle, but it’s lighter and less robust in flavour. Use the same 0.5 cup (6 ounces) measurement, but expect a milder taste. Adjust other sweeteners if needed to balance the recipe."
faqQ2: "How do I clean treacle residue from my air fryer?"
faqA2: "Mix warm water with a mild detergent and wipe the air fryer basket gently. For stubborn treacle stains, soak the basket briefly before scrubbing. Avoid abrasive tools to prevent damaging non-stick coatings."
faqQ3: "Does treacle measurement change if it’s cold or warm?"
faqA3: "Treacle thickens when cold, making it harder to pour. Warm it slightly for easier measuring, but 0.5 cup will still equal 6 ounces. Just ensure it’s at room temperature for accuracy."
faqQ4: "Can I reduce the amount of treacle in my air fryer recipe?"
faqA4: "Yes, but reducing treacle may affect texture and moisture. If using less than 0.5 cup (6 ounces), consider adding a bit of water or another liquid to compensate. Test small batches first."

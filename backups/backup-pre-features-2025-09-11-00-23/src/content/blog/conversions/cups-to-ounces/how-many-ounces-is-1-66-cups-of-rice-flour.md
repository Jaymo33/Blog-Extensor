faqQ1: "How do I convert 1.66 cups of rice flour to ounces without a scale?"
faqA1: "You can use the standard conversion: 1 cup of rice flour ≈ 4.5 oz, so 1.66 cups ≈ 7.5 oz. Fluff the flour, spoon it into a measuring cup, and level it off for accuracy. For best results in air fryer recipes, a kitchen scale is recommended."
faqQ2: "Can I substitute rice flour with all-purpose flour in air fryer recipes?"
faqA2: "Yes, but adjust measurements slightly. Rice flour is lighter, so 1.66 cups (7.5 oz) of rice flour ≈ 1.5 cups of all-purpose flour. Note that textures will differ—rice flour gives a crispier, gluten-free result."

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>

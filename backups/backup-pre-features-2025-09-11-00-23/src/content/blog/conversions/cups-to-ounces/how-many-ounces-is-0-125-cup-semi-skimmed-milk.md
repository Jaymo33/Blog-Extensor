faqQ1: "Can I use whole milk instead of semi skimmed milk for 0.125 cup measurements?"
faqA1: "Yes, you can substitute whole milk for semi skimmed milk in the same amount (0.125 cup or 1 oz). However, whole milk has a higher fat content, which may slightly alter the texture of your dish. Adjust cooking times if needed."
faqQ2: "How do I measure 0.125 cup of semi skimmed milk without a measuring cup?"
faqA2: "If you don’t have a measuring cup, use 2 tablespoons to measure 0.125 cup (1 oz) of semi skimmed milk. Alternatively, a kitchen scale set to ounces will give you the most accurate measurement."
faqQ3: "Does 0.125 cup of semi skimmed milk weigh the same as water?"
faqA3: "No, semi skimmed milk is slightly denser than water. While 0.125 cup of water weighs about 1 oz, semi skimmed milk may weigh a fraction more due to its fat and protein content. For most recipes, the difference is negligible."
faqQ4: "Can I use almond milk instead of semi skimmed milk in this measurement?"
faqA4: "Yes, you can use almond milk in the same amount (0.125 cup or 1 oz). Keep in mind that almond milk has a thinner consistency and different flavour, which may affect the final result. Adjust other ingredients if needed."

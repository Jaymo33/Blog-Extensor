faqQ1: "Can I use a kitchen scale to measure 0.125 cup of worcestershire sauce?"
faqA1: "Yes, a kitchen scale is a great alternative. Set it to ounces, tare your container, then pour until it reads 1 ounce. This method is often more accurate than volume measurements for liquids like worcestershire sauce."
faqQ2: "Does the brand of worcestershire sauce affect the weight per 0.125 cup?"
faqA2: "Different brands have nearly identical densities, so 0.125 cup will always be close to 1 ounce. However, thicker artisanal sauces might be slightly heavier. When precision matters, weighing is best."
faqQ3: "How many teaspoons are in 0.125 cup of worcestershire sauce?"
faqA3: "0.125 cup equals 6 teaspoons. This smaller measurement is useful when adjusting flavours in air fryer recipes. Remember, 3 teaspoons make 1 tablespoon, and 2 tablespoons equal 0.125 cup."
faqQ4: "Can I substitute soy sauce for worcestershire sauce in the same quantity?"
faqA4: "While both add umami, they're not identical. Soy sauce is saltier, so use about 3/4 of the worcestershire amount (0.75 ounces for 0.125 cup). Always taste and adjust when substituting in air fryer recipes."

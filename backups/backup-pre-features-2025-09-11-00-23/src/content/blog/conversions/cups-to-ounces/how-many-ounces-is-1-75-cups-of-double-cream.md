faqQ1: "Can I use single cream instead of double cream in air fryer recipes?"
faqA1: "Yes, you can substitute single cream for double cream, but the texture and richness will differ. Double cream has a higher fat content (around 48%), while single cream has about 18%. If using single cream, you may need to adjust cooking times or thicken the recipe slightly to achieve similar results."
faqQ2: "How do I convert 1.75 cups of double cream to grams?"
faqA2: "1.75 cups of double cream is roughly 400 grams. Since double cream’s density is about 1.01 g/ml, this conversion is useful for recipes requiring weight measurements. Always use a kitchen scale for the most accurate results, especially in baking."
faqQ3: "Why does my air fryer recipe call for double cream instead of milk?"
faqA3: "Double cream adds richness and stability to air fryer recipes, especially in sauces and desserts. Its higher fat content prevents curdling at high temperatures and creates a creamier texture. Milk can be used as a lighter alternative, but the results won’t be as indulgent."
faqQ4: "How long does double cream last once opened?"
faqA4: "Once opened, double cream stays fresh for about 3–5 days in the fridge. Always check for off smells or discolouration before use. For longer storage, freeze it in an airtight container, though it may need whisking after thawing to restore its texture."

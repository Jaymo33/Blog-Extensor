<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>
<p>Using the right amount of ingredients is crucial in air fryer cooking. Too much or too little yogurt can affect the texture and taste of your dish.

<p>Air fryers cook food quickly and evenly, but they rely on precise ingredient ratios. A slight variation in yogurt quantity can lead to undercooked or overcooked meals. That’s why we recommend using a kitchen scale for accuracy, especially when dealing with small measurements like 0.375 cup of plain yogurt.</p>

<h2>How to measure 0.375 cup of plain yogurt</h2>
<p>Measuring 0.375 cup of plain yogurt can be tricky without the right tools. Here’s how to do it easily: Use a liquid measuring cup and fill it to the 1/4 cup mark, then add half of another 1/4 cup. Alternatively, weigh it on a kitchen scale for exactness—3 ounces is your target. For more tips, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipes section</a>.</p>

<h3>Using a kitchen scale for precision</h3>

<h2>Common recipes using 0.375 cup of plain yogurt</h2>
<p>Many air fryer recipes call for 0.375 cup of plain yogurt.

<h3>Tips for substituting yogurt in recipes</h3>
<p>If you’re out of plain yogurt, you can substitute it with Greek yogurt or sour cream, but adjust the quantity slightly. Greek yogurt is thicker, so you might need less than 0.375 cup (3 ounces) to achieve the same consistency. Always check the recipe for best results.</p>

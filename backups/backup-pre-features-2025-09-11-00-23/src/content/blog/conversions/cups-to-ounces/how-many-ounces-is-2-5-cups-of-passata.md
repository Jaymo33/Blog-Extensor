faqQ1: "Can I use tomato sauce instead of passata in air fryer recipes?"
faqA1: "Yes, you can substitute tomato sauce for passata, but the consistency may differ. Passata is smoother and thicker, while tomato sauce often contains added seasonings. Adjust the quantity slightly to match the desired texture in your air fryer dish."
faqQ2: "How do I measure passata without a measuring cup?"
faqA2: "If you don’t have a measuring cup, use a kitchen scale. 20 fluid ounces of passata weigh approximately 567 grams. Alternatively, a standard mug holds about 8 fluid ounces, so 2.5 mugs would equal 20 fluid ounces."
faqQ3: "Does passata weight change if it’s homemade?"

faqQ4: "Can I freeze leftover passata for later use?"
faqA4: "Absolutely! Freeze passata in airtight containers or ice cube trays for portioned use. Thaw it in the fridge before adding it to air fryer recipes. This is a great way to reduce waste and save time on future meals."

<h2>Understanding Passata Measurements</h2>  
<p>Passata, a smooth tomato purée, is a staple in many air fryer recipes. Measuring it correctly ensures your dishes have the right consistency. While cups are a common measurement in recipes, ounces provide a more precise weight.

<h3>Why Accurate Measurements Matter</h3>  
<p>In air fryer cooking, too much or too little liquid can affect texture and cooking time. Passata adds moisture, so precise measurements prevent soggy or dry results. Whether you’re making <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>air fryer chicken recipes</a> or vegetable dishes, consistency is key. Measuring passata correctly also helps when scaling recipes up or down.</p>  

<h2>Converting Passata for Different Recipes</h2>  
<p>Many air fryer recipes call for passata in varying amounts. If a recipe lists passata in grams or millilitres, our conversion helps you adapt. For example, 2.5 cups (20 fl oz) of passata is about 600ml. This is handy for international recipes or when using a measuring jug with metric units. If you’re prepping <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable-based dishes</a>, this precision ensures balanced flavours.</p>  

<p>Some recipes may require thicker or thinner passata. If yours needs adjusting, remember that 2.5 cups of standard passata equals 20 fluid ounces, but you can tweak it by straining or diluting.

<h3>Common Mistakes to Avoid</h3>  
<p>One mistake is confusing fluid ounces with weight ounces. Fluid ounces measure volume, while weight ounces measure mass. For passata, fluid ounces are typically used. Another error is not levelling off the measuring cup, which can lead to inaccuracies. Always spoon passata into the cup and level it for the best results.</p>

faqQ1: "Is 1.25 cups of tahini the same as 10 ounces in the UK?"
faqA1: "Yes, 1.25 cups of tahini equals approximately 10 ounces in both UK and US measurements. The density of tahini means this conversion is generally consistent, though slight variations can occur based on how it’s packed. For precise results, weighing with a kitchen scale is best."
faqQ2: "Can I use tahini in air fryer recipes without measuring by weight?"
faqA2: "While you can measure tahini by volume, weighing it (10 ounces for 1.25 cups) ensures accuracy, especially for recipes requiring exact ratios. If you don’t have a scale, spoon the tahini lightly into a measuring cup and level it off for the closest approximation."
faqQ3: "What’s the best way to incorporate tahini into air fryer dishes?"
faqA3: "Tahini works great in marinades, dressings, or drizzled over air-fried vegetables or proteins. For 1.25 cups (10 ounces), mix it with lemon juice, garlic, and water for a creamy sauce. It adds depth to dishes like air-fried cauliflower or chicken skewers."
faqQ4: "How long does tahini last once opened?"
faqA4: "Opened tahini lasts up to 6 months in the fridge if stored properly. Stir well before using, as oil separation is normal. For recipes calling for 1.25 cups (10 ounces), ensure it’s well-mixed to maintain consistency in your air fryer creations."

<h2>Why measuring tahini accurately matters</h2>  
<p>Tahini is a staple in Middle Eastern cuisine and a versatile ingredient in air fryer cooking. Its rich, nutty flavour enhances dips, sauces, and even baked goods.

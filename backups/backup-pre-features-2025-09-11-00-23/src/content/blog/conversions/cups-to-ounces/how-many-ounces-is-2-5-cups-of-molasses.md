faqQ1: "Can I use a UK measuring cup for 2.5 cups of molasses to ounces?"
faqA1: "Yes, UK and US cups are the same volume (240ml per cup), so 2.5 cups of molasses will still equal 30 ounces. Just ensure you’re using a standard measuring cup, not a mug or teacup, for accuracy."
faqQ2: "Why is weighing molasses better than measuring by cups?"
faqA2: "Molasses is dense and sticky, so weighing it in ounces ensures precision. Volume measurements (cups) can vary based on how you fill the cup, but 30 ounces will always be the same. A kitchen scale eliminates guesswork."
faqQ3: "How do I clean molasses from my air fryer basket?"
faqA3: "Soak the basket in warm, soapy water to loosen sticky molasses residue. For stubborn spots, use a soft brush or sponge. Avoid abrasive cleaners to protect non-stick coatings. Check our cleaning guide for more tips."
faqQ4: "Can I substitute honey for molasses in air fryer recipes?"
faqA4: "Yes, but adjust the amount since honey is sweeter and thinner. Replace 2.5 cups (30 ounces) of molasses with 2 cups of honey, and reduce other liquids slightly. The flavour profile will differ, so taste as you go."

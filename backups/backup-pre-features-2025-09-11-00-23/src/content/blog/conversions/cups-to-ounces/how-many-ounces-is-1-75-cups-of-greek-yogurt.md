faqQ1: "Can I use regular yogurt instead of greek yogurt in air fryer recipes?"
faqA1: "Yes, you can use regular yogurt, but keep in mind it has a thinner consistency. Greek yogurt is thicker and denser, so you may need to adjust the quantity slightly. For best results, stick to the recipe’s recommendations or use a conversion chart to ensure accuracy."
faqQ2: "How do I measure 1.75 cups of greek yogurt without a measuring cup?"
faqA2: "If you don’t have a measuring cup, a kitchen scale is your best alternative. Since 1.75 cups of greek yogurt equals 14 ounces, you can weigh it directly. Alternatively, use a standard drinking glass (which holds about 8 ounces) and measure roughly 1.75 times that amount."
faqQ3: "Why does greek yogurt weigh more per cup than regular yogurt?"
faqA3: "Greek yogurt is strained to remove excess whey, making it denser and thicker than regular yogurt. This process increases its protein content and reduces its water content, resulting in a heavier weight per cup. This density affects how it behaves in recipes, especially in baking."
faqQ4: "Can I freeze greek yogurt for later use in air fryer recipes?"
faqA4: "Yes, you can freeze greek yogurt, but its texture may change slightly upon thawing. It’s best used in cooked or baked dishes rather than as a fresh topping. For air fryer recipes, thawed greek yogurt works well in dips, marinades, or baked goods."

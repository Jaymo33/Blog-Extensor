faqQ1: "Can I use frozen onions instead of fresh for 0.33 cup measurements?"
faqA1: "Yes, you can use frozen onions as a substitute for fresh ones. However, frozen onions may release more moisture during cooking, which can affect texture. For 0.33 cup of onion (1.76 oz), thaw and drain them lightly before use to avoid sogginess in your air fryer."
faqQ2: "How do I store leftover chopped onion after measuring 0.33 cup?"
faqA2: "Store leftover chopped onion in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 3 days. For longer storage, freeze it in portions. When you need 0.33 cup again, simply thaw and use it directly in your air fryer recipes."
faqQ3: "Does the type of onion affect the weight for 0.33 cup?"
faqA3: "Yes, different onion varieties (e.g., red, white, or sweet onions) have slightly varying densities. However, the difference is minimal for small quantities like 0.33 cup. Stick to the 1.76 oz approximation unless your recipe specifies otherwise."
faqQ4: "Can I use onion powder instead of fresh onion for 0.33 cup?"
faqA4: "Onion powder is a concentrated alternative. For 0.33 cup of fresh onion (1.76 oz), use about 1 tablespoon of onion powder. Adjust to taste, as the flavour intensity can vary. Always rehydrate the powder with a bit of water if needed."

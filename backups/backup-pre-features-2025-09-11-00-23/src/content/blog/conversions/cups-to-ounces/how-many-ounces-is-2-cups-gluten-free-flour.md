faqQ1: "Does the type of gluten-free flour affect the weight per cup?"
faqA1: "Yes, different gluten-free flours have varying densities. For example, almond flour is lighter (about 3.5 oz per cup), while rice flour is closer to 4.8 oz per cup. Always check the packaging or weigh your flour for accuracy, especially in air fryer recipes where precision matters."
faqQ2: "Can I use a UK measuring cup for this conversion?"
faqA2: "UK and US cups are slightly different (1 UK cup = 9.6 oz, 1 US cup = 8 oz). For consistency, we recommend weighing your flour in ounces or grams. If using cups, stick to one measurement system to avoid errors in your air fryer baking."
faqQ3: "Why is weighing gluten-free flour better than using cups?"
faqA3: "Weighing eliminates inconsistencies caused by how the flour is packed or scooped. Since gluten-free flours vary in texture, weight ensures accuracy, leading to better air fryer results—whether you're baking cakes or coating chicken."
faqQ4: "How do I store gluten-free flour to maintain accuracy?"
faqA4: "Keep gluten-free flour in an airtight container in a cool, dry place. Humidity can affect weight and texture. For best results in air fryer recipes, fluff the flour with a fork before measuring or weighing to prevent clumping."

<p>2 cups of gluten-free flour equals approximately 9.6 ounces (272 grams). This conversion is essential for precise baking, especially when using an air fryer, where accurate measurements can make or break your recipe. Whether you're making gluten-free cakes, cookies, or bread, knowing the exact weight ensures consistency and perfect results every time.</p>  

<h2>Why measuring gluten-free flour in ounces matters</h2>  
<p>Gluten-free flour behaves differently than regular wheat flour, so measuring by weight (ounces) rather than volume (cups) is far more reliable. A cup of gluten-free flour can vary in weight depending on how it's packed, the brand, and even humidity levels. For air fryer recipes, precision is key—too much flour can lead to dry, crumbly results, while too little may cause your dish to fall apart.

<p>Many UK bakers prefer weighing ingredients in ounces or grams for accuracy. If you're adapting a recipe from cups to ounces, this conversion ensures you won't end up with a dense or overly dry bake.

<h3>How to measure 2 cups of gluten-free flour correctly</h3>  
<p>To get an accurate 9.6 ounces (or 272 grams) from 2 cups of gluten-free flour, lightly spoon the flour into your measuring cup and level it off with a knife. Avoid scooping directly from the bag, as this compacts the flour and leads to excess. For best results, use a digital kitchen scale—this is especially helpful when preparing air fryer recipes where precision matters.</p>

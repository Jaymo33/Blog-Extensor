faqQ1: "Can I use fresh milk instead of evaporated milk in air fryer recipes?"
faqA1: "Yes, but you’ll need to adjust quantities. Replace 1 cup (8.5 oz) of evaporated milk with 1 cup fresh milk plus 2 tablespoons to mimic the thickness. Note that baking times may vary slightly due to the higher water content."
faqQ2: "Does evaporated milk weigh the same as condensed milk?"
faqA2: "No, condensed milk is sweeter and denser. While 1 cup of evaporated milk weighs 8.5 oz, condensed milk weighs about 10 oz per cup due to added sugar. Always check labels for precise conversions."
faqQ3: "How long does evaporated milk last once opened?"
faqA3: "Opened evaporated milk keeps for up to 5 days refrigerated. Transfer it to an airtight container to maintain freshness. For longer storage, freeze it in measured portions for future air fryer recipes."
faqQ4: "Why does my air fryer recipe with evaporated milk turn out watery?"
faqA4: "This usually happens if the evaporated milk isn’t measured accurately or the air fryer temperature is too low. Ensure you’re using 8.5 oz per cup and preheat the air fryer to the recommended temperature for even cooking."

<p>1 cup of evaporated milk equals approximately 8.5 ounces (240 ml) in UK measurements. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precision ensures perfect texture and consistency. Whether you're making creamy desserts or savoury dishes, knowing the exact weight helps avoid kitchen mishaps.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on even heat distribution, so ingredient ratios must be spot-on. Using the correct amount of evaporated milk—8.5 ounces per cup—ensures your recipes bake or cook evenly. Too much liquid can lead to soggy results, while too little might dry out your dish. For more tips, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>  

<p>Evaporated milk is thicker than regular milk, so volume-to-weight conversions differ slightly. If you’re adapting a recipe from cups to ounces, always double-check. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a> includes measured guidelines for foolproof air fryer meals.</p>  

<h3>How to measure evaporated milk correctly</h3>  
<p>Use a kitchen scale for the most accurate results. Place your measuring cup on the scale, tare it to zero, then pour evaporated milk until it hits 8.5 ounces. No scale? A UK standard measuring cup (240 ml) will suffice, but slight variations can occur.</p>  

<h2>Common recipes using evaporated milk</h2>  
<p>Evaporated milk stars in creamy pasta sauces, custards, and even air-fried cakes. Its rich texture enhances dishes like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>air fryer desserts</a> without overpowering flavours. Need inspiration?

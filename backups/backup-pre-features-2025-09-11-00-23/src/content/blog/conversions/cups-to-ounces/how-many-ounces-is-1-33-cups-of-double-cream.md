faqQ1: "Can I use single cream instead of double cream for 1.33 cups in an air fryer?"
faqA1: "Single cream has a lower fat content (around 18%) compared to double cream (48%), so substitutions may affect texture. For 1.33 cups (10.64 oz), single cream will whip less densely and may separate under high heat. If using it, reduce air fryer temperature by 10°C and monitor closely."
faqQ2: "How do I convert 1.33 cups of double cream to grams?"
faqA2: "1.33 cups (10.64 oz) of double cream equals approximately 300 grams. Use a kitchen scale for accuracy, especially in air fryer recipes where precise weights ensure even cooking. Note that UK and US cup sizes differ slightly, so weight measurements are more reliable."
faqQ3: "Why does my air fryer split double cream sauces?"
faqA3: "Air fryers circulate hot air rapidly, which can overheat cream-based sauces. For 1.33 cups (10.64 oz) of double cream, cook at a lower temperature (150°C max) and stir occasionally. Adding a starch like cornflour can also stabilize the sauce."
faqQ4: "Can I freeze dishes made with 1.33 cups of double cream?"
faqA4: "Yes, but the texture may change upon thawing. Dishes like custards or mousses made with 1.33 cups (10.64 oz) of double cream can become grainy. Reheat gently in the air fryer at 120°C, stirring halfway, to restore smoothness."

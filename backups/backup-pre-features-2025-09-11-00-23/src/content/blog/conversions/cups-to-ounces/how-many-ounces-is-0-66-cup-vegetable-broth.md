faqQ1: "Can I use stock instead of vegetable broth for this measurement?"
faqA1: "Yes, you can substitute vegetable stock for broth in the same quantity (0.66 cup or 5.28 ounces). The flavour profile may vary slightly, but the measurement remains identical. Stock is often richer, so adjust seasonings if needed."
faqQ2: "How do I measure 0.66 cup without a measuring cup?"
faqA2: "If you don’t have a measuring cup, use a kitchen scale to weigh out 5.28 ounces of vegetable broth. Alternatively, fill a standard cup two-thirds full for a close approximation. A tablespoon measure (10.5 tablespoons) also works in a pinch."
faqQ3: "Does the type of vegetable broth affect the weight?"
faqA3: "Most vegetable broths have a similar density, so 0.66 cup will generally weigh 5.28 ounces. However, thicker or reduced-sodium broths might vary slightly. For precision, especially in baking, weighing is best."
faqQ4: "Can I freeze leftover vegetable broth after measuring 0.66 cup?"
faqA4: "Absolutely! Pour leftover broth into ice cube trays (about 1 ounce per cube) for easy future use. Thaw as needed, and you’ll always have the right amount for air fryer recipes. This method reduces waste and saves time."

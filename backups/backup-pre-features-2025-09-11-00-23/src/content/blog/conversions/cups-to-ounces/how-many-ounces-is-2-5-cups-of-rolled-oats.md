faqQ1: "Can I use quick oats instead of rolled oats for 2.5 cups?"
faqA1: "Yes, you can substitute quick oats, but the texture will be different. Quick oats are more finely cut, so they absorb liquid faster and cook quicker. The weight remains roughly the same—2.5 cups will still be about 8.5 ounces."
faqQ2: "How do I convert 2.5 cups of rolled oats to grams?"
faqA2: "2.5 cups of rolled oats is approximately 240 grams. If your recipe uses metric measurements, this conversion ensures accuracy. Always use a kitchen scale for the most precise results, especially in air fryer cooking."
faqQ3: "Why does my air fryer granola burn when using 2.5 cups of rolled oats?"
faqA3: "Air fryers cook quickly, and oats can burn if the temperature is too high or the cooking time is too long. Try reducing the heat by 10-15°C and stirring the oats every few minutes. A light coating of oil also helps distribute heat evenly."
faqQ4: "Can I freeze recipes made with 2.5 cups of rolled oats?"
faqA4: "Absolutely! Baked oatmeal, granola bars, and other oat-based dishes freeze well. Wrap them tightly or store in airtight containers. Thaw at room temperature or reheat in the air fryer for a few minutes to restore crispiness."

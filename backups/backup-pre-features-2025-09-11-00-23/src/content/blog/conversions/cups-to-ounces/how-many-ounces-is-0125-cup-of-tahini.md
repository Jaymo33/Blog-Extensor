faqQ1: "Can I use a tablespoon to measure 0.125 cup of tahini?"
faqA1: "Yes, you can! Two tablespoons of tahini equal approximately 0.125 cup or 1 ounce. This is a handy shortcut if you don’t have a measuring cup or kitchen scale. Just make sure to level off the tablespoons for accuracy."
faqQ2: "Why does tahini need to be measured precisely in air fryer recipes?"
faqA2: "Air fryers cook food quickly and evenly, so precise measurements ensure consistent results. Too much tahini can make sauces overly thick, while too little might leave dishes lacking flavour. Measuring 0.125 cup (1 ounce) correctly guarantees the perfect balance."
faqQ3: "How long does tahini last once opened?"
faqA3: "Opened tahini can last up to 6 months if stored properly. Keep it in an airtight container in a cool, dark place or the fridge. Stir it well before using, as separation is normal."
faqQ4: "Can I substitute tahini with another ingredient in air fryer recipes?"
faqA4: "If you’re out of tahini, almond butter or Greek yogurt can work as substitutes, though the flavour will differ. For 0.125 cup of tahini, use the same amount of your chosen alternative. Adjust seasonings to taste."

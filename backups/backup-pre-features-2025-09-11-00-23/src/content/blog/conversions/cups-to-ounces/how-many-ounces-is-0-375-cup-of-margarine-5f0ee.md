faqQ1: "Can I use butter instead of margarine for 0.375 cup measurements?"
faqA1: "Yes, you can substitute butter for margarine in most recipes. The conversion remains the same: 0.375 cup of butter also equals 3 ounces. However, butter has a slightly different fat content, which may affect the texture of your dish. For air fryer recipes, butter can sometimes brown faster than margarine, so keep an eye on cooking times."
faqQ2: "How do I measure 0.375 cup of margarine without a measuring cup?"
faqA2: "If you don’t have a measuring cup, you can use the markings on a margarine wrapper. Most sticks are divided into tablespoons, so 0.375 cup would be 6 tablespoons. Alternatively, use a kitchen scale to weigh out 3 ounces. This method is just as accurate and often easier for small measurements like this."
faqQ3: "Does the type of margarine affect the weight of 0.375 cup?"
faqA3: "Most standard margarines will weigh the same for 0.375 cup, but low-fat or whipped varieties may differ slightly. These lighter versions can have more air, which reduces the weight per cup. For best results, stick to regular margarine or check the packaging for specific weight guidelines."
faqQ4: "Can I use oil instead of margarine in air fryer recipes?"
faqA4: "Yes, oil can often be substituted for margarine in air fryer recipes, but the conversion isn’t 1:1. Generally, use about 25% less oil than the margarine measurement. For 0.375 cup of margarine, you’d use roughly 0.28 cup of oil. Keep in mind that oil may change the texture and browning of your dish."

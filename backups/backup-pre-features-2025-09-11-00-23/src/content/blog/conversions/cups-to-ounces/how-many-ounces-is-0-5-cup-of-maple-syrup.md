faqQ1: "Can I use golden syrup instead of maple syrup in air fryer recipes?"
faqA1: "Yes, golden syrup can substitute maple syrup, but it's sweeter and less robust. Use 10% less by weight (about 3.8 oz for 0.5 cup equivalents). Adjust other liquids in your recipe to balance consistency."
faqQ2: "How do I clean maple syrup residue from my air fryer basket?"
faqA2: "Mix warm water with a drop of dish soap and soak the basket for 10 minutes. Scrub gently with a soft sponge, then rinse. For stubborn spots, use our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner guide</a> for specialised tips."
faqQ3: "Does maple syrup burn easily in the air fryer?"
faqA3: "Yes, maple syrup caramelises quickly at high heat. To prevent burning, brush it on during the last 3-5 minutes of cooking. For glazes, dilute slightly with water or oil to reduce scorching."
faqQ4: "Is 0.5 cup of maple syrup the same in US and UK measurements?"
faqA4: "Yes, 0.5 cup equals 4.2 oz in both systems, but UK recipes may list weights more often. Always check if your recipe uses imperial or metric measurements for precision."

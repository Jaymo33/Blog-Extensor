faqQ1: "Can I use olive oil instead of vegetable oil for 1.66 cups in an air fryer?"

faqQ2: "How do I measure 1.66 cups of vegetable oil without a measuring cup?"
faqA2: "If you don’t have a measuring cup, use a kitchen scale to weigh out 13.28 ounces of vegetable oil. Alternatively, a standard UK tablespoon holds about 0.5 ounces, so you’d need roughly 26.5 tablespoons."
faqQ3: "Does the type of vegetable oil affect the conversion from cups to ounces?"
faqA3: "No, the density of most vegetable oils is similar, so 1.66 cups will always be approximately 13.28 ounces. However, oils like coconut oil (solid at room temperature) require melting before measuring."
faqQ4: "Can I reuse vegetable oil after air frying with 1.66 cups?"
faqA4: "Yes, you can reuse vegetable oil if it’s strained and stored properly. Avoid reusing oil that’s been overheated or used for strongly flavored foods, as it can affect taste and quality."

faqQ1: "Can I use tablespoons instead of ounces for measuring Nutella?"
faqA1: "Yes, you can! One ounce of Nutella is roughly 2 tablespoons, so 0.375 cup (3 ounces) equals about 6 tablespoons. However, for baking in an air fryer, weighing Nutella ensures better accuracy, especially for recipes like stuffed pastries or cakes."
faqQ2: "Does Nutella’s weight change if it’s melted?"
faqA2: "Melted Nutella takes up slightly less volume but weighs the same. If your recipe calls for melted Nutella, still measure by weight (3 ounces for 0.375 cup) to avoid altering the recipe’s consistency."
faqQ3: "How do I measure Nutella without making a mess?"
faqA3: "Use a spatula to scoop Nutella into a measuring cup or onto a kitchen scale. Lightly greasing the cup or spoon with oil helps it slide out cleanly. For sticky recipes, check our <a href=\"https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner\">cleaning tips</a>."
faqQ4: "Can I substitute another spread for Nutella in air fryer recipes?"
faqA4: "Yes, peanut butter or chocolate hazelnut spreads with similar thickness can work. Adjust measurements by weight (3 ounces per 0.375 cup) for best results. Explore alternatives in our <a href=\"https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert\">dessert recipes</a>."

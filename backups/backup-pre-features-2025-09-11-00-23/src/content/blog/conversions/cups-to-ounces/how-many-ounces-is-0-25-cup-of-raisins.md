faqQ1: "How do I measure 0.25 cup of raisins without a measuring cup?"
faqA1: "If you donâ€™t have a measuring cup, use a kitchen scale to weigh out 1.25 ounces (35 grams) of raisins. Alternatively, a tablespoon holds roughly 0.06 cup, so four level tablespoons will give you approximately 0.25 cup."
faqQ2: "Can I use 0.25 cup of raisins in savoury air fryer dishes?"
faqA2: "Absolutely! Raisins add a touch of sweetness to savoury dishes like stuffed chicken or Moroccan-inspired tagines. Just ensure you stick to the 0.25 cup (1.25 oz) measurement to avoid overpowering other flavours."
faqQ3: "Do raisins weigh the same as other dried fruits in a 0.25 cup measure?"
faqA3: "No, different dried fruits have varying densities. For example, 0.25 cup of chopped dates might weigh slightly more than raisins. Always check specific conversions for the ingredient you're using."
faqQ4: "How many raisins are in 0.25 cup?"
faqA4: "This depends on the size of the raisins, but roughly 0.25 cup holds about 40-50 standard raisins. For precise baking, weighing them (1.25 oz) is more reliable than counting."

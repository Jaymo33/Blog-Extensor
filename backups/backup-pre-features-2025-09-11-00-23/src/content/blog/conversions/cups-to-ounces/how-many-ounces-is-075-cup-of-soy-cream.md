faqQ1: "Can I use a different type of cream instead of soy cream in my air fryer recipe?"
faqA1: "Yes, you can substitute soy cream with coconut cream, almond milk, or cashew cream. Just remember that 0.75 cup of soy cream equals 6 ounces, so adjust your measurements accordingly. Keep in mind that different creams may alter the flavour and texture of your dish slightly."
faqQ2: "How do I measure 0.75 cup of soy cream without a measuring cup?"
faqA2: "If you don’t have a measuring cup, you can use a kitchen scale to weigh out 6 ounces of soy cream, which is equivalent to 0.75 cup. Alternatively, you can estimate using a standard mug, but this method is less accurate and may affect your recipe’s outcome."
faqQ3: "Why is my air fryer recipe turning out soggy when using soy cream?"
faqA3: "Sogginess can occur if you use too much liquid, like soy cream, in your air fryer. Ensure you’re measuring accurately—0.75 cup of soy cream is 6 ounces. Also, avoid overcrowding the air fryer basket to allow proper air circulation, which helps achieve a crispier texture."
faqQ4: "Can I freeze leftover soy cream after measuring out 0.75 cup?"
faqA4: "Freezing soy cream isn’t recommended as it can separate and become grainy when thawed. It’s best to store it in the fridge and use it within a few days. If you need to preserve it longer, consider using it in cooked dishes like soups or sauces before it goes bad."

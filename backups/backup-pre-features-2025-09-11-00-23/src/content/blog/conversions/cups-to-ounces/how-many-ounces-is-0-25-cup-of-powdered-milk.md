faqQ1: "Can I use liquid milk instead of powdered milk in air fryer recipes?"
faqA1: "Yes, but you’ll need to adjust the recipe. Replace 0.25 cup of powdered milk (0.7 oz) with 1 cup of liquid milk and reduce other liquids slightly. Keep in mind that liquid milk adds moisture, which can affect crispiness in air-fried dishes."
faqQ2: "Why does my air fryer recipe taste different when I use powdered milk?"
faqA2: "Powdered milk has a concentrated, slightly caramelised flavour compared to fresh milk. If your dish tastes off, ensure you’ve measured correctly—0.25 cup should be 0.7 oz. Also, check that your powdered milk hasn’t expired, as old stock can develop a stale taste."
faqQ3: "How do I convert 0.25 cup of powdered milk to grams?"
faqA3: "0.25 cup of powdered milk is about 20 grams. For precision, use a kitchen scale. This conversion is handy for UK recipes, which often list weights instead of volume measurements."
faqQ4: "Can I make a larger batch of a recipe using powdered milk?"
faqA4: "Absolutely! Just scale up proportionally—for example, 1 cup of powdered milk equals 2.8 oz (80 grams). Mix well to ensure even distribution, especially in dry mixes like breading or baking flour blends. Always preheat your air fryer for consistent results with larger quantities."

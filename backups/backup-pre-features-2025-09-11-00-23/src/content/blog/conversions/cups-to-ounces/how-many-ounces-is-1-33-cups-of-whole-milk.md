faqQ1: "Can I use skimmed milk instead of whole milk for this measurement?"
faqA1: "Yes, you can substitute skimmed milk for whole milk in the same quantity (1.33 cups or 10.64 ounces). However, skimmed milk has less fat, which may slightly alter the texture of your dish. For air fryer recipes, whole milk often provides better browning and richness."
faqQ2: "How do I measure 1.33 cups of whole milk without a measuring cup?"
faqA2: "If you don't have a measuring cup, use a kitchen scale to weigh out 10.64 ounces of whole milk. Alternatively, you can estimate using common household items: 1.33 cups is roughly equivalent to a large coffee mug filled about two-thirds of the way. For precision in air fryer cooking, investing in basic measuring tools is recommended."
faqQ3: "Does the UK use different cup measurements for milk?"
faqA3: "No, standard cup measurements are the same in the UK and US for liquid ingredients like milk. 1.33 cups of whole milk equals 10.64 ounces in both regions. However, always check your recipe's origin, as some older UK recipes may use imperial pints instead of cups."
faqQ4: "Why does my air fryer recipe call for such a precise milk measurement?"
faqA4: "Air fryer recipes often require precise liquid measurements because the cooking chamber's small size leaves little room for error. 1.33 cups (10.64 ounces) of whole milk is likely calculated to create the perfect balance of moisture and browning. Sticking to the exact measurement ensures consistent results with your air fryer's rapid air circulation."

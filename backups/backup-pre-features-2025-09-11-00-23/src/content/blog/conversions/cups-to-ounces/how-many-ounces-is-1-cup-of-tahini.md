faqQ1: "Does tahini weight change between brands?"
faqA1: "Yes, tahini weight can vary slightly between brands due to differences in sesame seed processing and oil content. However, the variation is minimal - typically within 0.5 ounces per cup. For air fryer recipes, this small difference won't significantly affect your results."
faqQ2: "Can I use volume measurements instead of weight for tahini?"
faqA2: "While you can use volume measurements, weight is more accurate for tahini due to its thick, sticky consistency. If using cups, always spoon the tahini in and level it off without packing. For air fryer recipes where precision matters, we recommend using scales for best results."
faqQ3: "How does tahini measurement affect air fryer cooking?"
faqA3: "Accurate tahini measurements are crucial in air fryer cooking to prevent sauces from being too thick or thin. The right consistency ensures even coating and prevents dripping or burning. Our 1 cup to 8.5 ounces conversion helps achieve perfect results every time."
faqQ4: "Is there a difference between UK and US measurements for tahini?"
faqA4: "The main difference is in cup sizes - US cups are 240ml while UK cups are 250ml. However, for tahini's density, we recommend using weight (ounces) rather than volume for consistency. Our 8.5 ounces per cup conversion works well for both UK and US recipes in air fryers."

<h3>Converting tahini measurements for UK cooks</h3>
<p>While US cups measure 8 fluid ounces, UK measurements can vary slightly. For tahini, which is denser than water, we recommend using weight measurements for accuracy.

<h2>Measuring tahini without scales</h2>
<p>If you don't have kitchen scales, you can still measure tahini accurately using the displacement method. Fill a measuring jug with 1 cup of water, then add tahini until the water level rises to 2 cups. This method accounts for tahini's thick consistency and gives you roughly 8.5 ounces.</p>
<p>For air fryer cooking, we recommend measuring tahini by weight whenever possible. This ensures your <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipes</a> turn out perfectly every time, whether you're making crispy tofu or roasted vegetables with tahini glaze.</p>

<h2>Storing and handling tahini</h2>
<p>Proper storage affects your tahini measurements too. Always stir well before measuring, as the oil separates naturally. Store opened tahini in the fridge and bring to room temperature before use for easiest measuring. Remember to clean your <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer</a> after cooking with tahini-based sauces to prevent residue buildup.</p>
<p>When working with tahini in air fryer recipes, its thickness means it's often best mixed with other liquids. The 1 cup to 8.5 ounces conversion becomes particularly useful when creating balanced marinades or sauces that won't clog your air fryer basket.</p>

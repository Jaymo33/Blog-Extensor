faqQ1: "Can I use plain flour instead of cornflour for 0.25 cup measurements?"
faqA1: "Yes, but the texture will differ. Plain flour is heavier, so 0.25 cup weighs about 1.25 ounces (35 grams). Cornflour gives a crispier finish, ideal for air frying. Adjust cooking times slightly if substituting."
faqQ2: "How do I store cornflour to keep it fresh for air fryer recipes?"
faqA2: "Store cornflour in an airtight container in a cool, dry place. Moisture can cause clumping, affecting measurements like 0.25 cup (1.06 oz). For long-term freshness, consider refrigeration."
faqQ3: "Why does my air fryer coating turn out soggy with cornflour?"
faqA3: "Sogginess often comes from overcrowding the basket or insufficient preheating. Ensure you’re using the right amount (0.25 cup = 1.06 oz) and shake the basket halfway for even crisping."
faqQ4: "Is cornflour the same as cornstarch in the UK?"
faqA4: "Yes, cornflour and cornstarch are the same in the UK. Both refer to the fine, white powder used for thickening and coating. 0.25 cup equals 1.06 ounces regardless of the label."

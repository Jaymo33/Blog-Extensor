faqQ1: "Is 2.5 cups of sesame oil the same as 20 ounces?"
faqA1: "Yes, 2.5 cups of sesame oil is approximately 20 ounces (or 19.7 oz precisely). This conversion is based on sesame oil weighing roughly 7.9 ounces per cup. For air fryer recipes, precise measurements help avoid overly greasy or dry results."
faqQ2: "Can I use a measuring cup instead of a scale for sesame oil?"
faqA2: "Absolutely! A liquid measuring cup works fine—just ensure it’s levelled off for accuracy. However, a kitchen scale provides the most precise measurement, especially for dense oils like sesame. Many air fryer enthusiasts prefer scales for consistent cooking."
faqQ3: "How does sesame oil affect air fryer cooking times?"
faqA3: "Sesame oil’s high smoke point (around 410°F or 210°C) makes it great for air frying. However, using too much can lead to excess smoke. Stick to light coatings—about 1-2 tablespoons per batch—for optimal crispiness without overpowering flavours."
faqQ4: "What’s the best way to store opened sesame oil?"
faqA4: "To maintain freshness, store opened sesame oil in the fridge. Its rich flavour can degrade when exposed to light and heat. Proper storage ensures your 2.5 cups (20 ounces) stay flavourful for future air fryer dishes."

<p>2.5 cups of sesame oil equals approximately 20 ounces (or 19.7 oz to be precise). This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements ensure perfect results every time. Whether you’re whipping up crispy tofu or flavourful stir-fries, knowing how to convert cups to ounces is a game-changer.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of sesame oil can make or break your dish. Too little, and your ingredients might dry out; too much, and they could become greasy. Air fryers rely on hot air circulation, so balancing oil quantities is key. For example, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> often call for light coatings of oil to achieve that ideal crispiness.</p>  

<p>Many home cooks underestimate the importance of converting cups to ounces, especially with dense liquids like sesame oil. A standard UK cup holds 8 fluid ounces, but oils vary in weight. Sesame oil, with its rich consistency, weighs roughly 7.9 ounces per cup. That’s why 2.5 cups translate to just under 20 ounces.</p>  

<h3>How to measure sesame oil for air frying</h3>  
<p>For best results, use a kitchen scale to weigh your sesame oil. If you don’t have one, a liquid measuring cup will do—just ensure it’s levelled off. Many <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion charts</a> include oil measurements to simplify the process. Remember, precision helps avoid soggy or unevenly cooked meals.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for sesame oil in air fryer recipes</h2>  
<p>Sesame oil adds a nutty depth to dishes like air-fried chicken, roasted vegetables, or even crispy tofu. A little goes a long way—just 1-2 tablespoons can elevate flavours. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipes</a> for inspiration on incorporating sesame oil into marinades.</p>

<h3>Storing sesame oil for longevity</h3>

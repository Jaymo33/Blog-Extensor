faqQ2: "How do I store leftover icing sugar after measuring 0.66 cup?"
faqA2: "Keep it in an airtight container in a cool, dry place to prevent clumping. If it hardens, pulse it in a blender or sieve it before reuse."

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer baking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers cook food quickly and evenly, but only if ingredient ratios are spot-on. Too much or too little icing sugar can affect texture, sweetness, and even cooking times. For example, a dense cake batter with incorrect sugar measurements might not rise properly. That’s why converting 0.66 cup of icing sugar to ounces (2.64 oz) is so important. If you're new to air fryer baking, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> for foolproof ideas.</p>  

<h3>How to measure 0.66 cup of icing sugar</h3>  
<p>Use a dry measuring cup for accuracy, scooping the icing sugar lightly without packing it down. Level it off with a straight edge for the correct 0.66 cup measurement. For best results, weigh it on a kitchen scale to confirm it’s 2.64 ounces. This method eliminates guesswork, especially for delicate recipes like macarons or frosting.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for 0.66 cup of icing sugar</h2>  
<p>This measurement is perfect for small-batch baking in your air fryer. You might use it for glazes, dusting desserts, or making a single-layer cake. It’s also ideal for recipes like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cookies>air fryer cookies</a>, where precise sugar amounts ensure the right chewiness. Remember, 0.66 cup (2.64 oz) of icing sugar dissolves faster than granulated sugar, so adjust mixing times accordingly.</p>  

<h3>Converting other icing sugar amounts</h3>  
<p>If your recipe calls for a different amount, here’s a quick reference: 1 cup of icing sugar equals 4 oz, so halve or double as needed. For example, 0.33 cup is 1.32 oz, and 1 cup is 4 oz.

<h2>Tips for working with icing sugar in an air fryer</h2>  
<p>Icing sugar can clump or melt unevenly in an air fryer’s high heat. To avoid this, sift it before use and mix it thoroughly into batters. For dusting, wait until after cooking to prevent burning. If you’re making frosting, combine 0.66 cup (2.64 oz) with liquids gradually to avoid lumps.

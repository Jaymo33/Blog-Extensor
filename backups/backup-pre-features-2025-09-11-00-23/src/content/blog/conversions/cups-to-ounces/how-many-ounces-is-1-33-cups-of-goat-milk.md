faqQ1: "Can I use cow’s milk instead of goat milk in air fryer recipes?"
faqA1: "Yes, you can substitute cow’s milk for goat milk, but the flavour and texture will differ. Goat milk is tangier and creamier, so adjust seasonings accordingly. Use the same measurement—1.33 cups of cow’s milk also equals 10.64 ounces."
faqQ2: "Why is goat milk better for some air fryer recipes?"
faqA2: "Goat milk has a higher fat content and unique flavour profile, making it ideal for creamy sauces, custards, and marinades. Its thickness ensures even cooking in the air fryer, and its tanginess complements both sweet and savoury dishes."
faqQ3: "How do I store leftover goat milk after measuring?"
faqA3: "Store leftover goat milk in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 5 days. Shake well before using, as it may separate. For longer storage, freeze it in measured portions for future air fryer recipes."
faqQ4: "Are there vegan alternatives to goat milk for air fryer cooking?"
faqA4: "Yes, coconut milk or almond milk can replace goat milk in most recipes. Note that 1.33 cups of coconut milk equals 10.64 ounces, but the flavour and consistency will vary. Adjust cooking times slightly for best results."

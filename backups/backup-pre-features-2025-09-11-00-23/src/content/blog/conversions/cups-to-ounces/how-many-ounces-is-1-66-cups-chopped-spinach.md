faqQ1: "Does 1.66 cups of chopped spinach weigh the same as whole leaves?"
faqA1: "No, chopped spinach packs more densely into measuring cups than whole leaves. 1.66 cups of chopped spinach (3.32 oz) would equal roughly 2 cups if measured with whole leaves. Always account for preparation style when converting volumes to weights."
faqQ2: "Can I use frozen spinach instead of fresh for 1.66 cups?"
faqA2: "Yes, but frozen spinach must be thawed and thoroughly drained first. 1.66 cups of frozen chopped spinach yields about 1 cup after draining excess water. Adjust other liquid ingredients in your air fryer recipe accordingly to prevent sogginess."
faqQ3: "How does 1.66 cups of spinach change when cooked in an air fryer?"
faqA3: "Spinach reduces dramatically—1.66 cups raw becomes roughly 1/3 cup cooked. For dishes requiring cooked spinach, like dips or fillings, start with 3-4 times the raw volume. The air fryer’s rapid heat wilts spinach faster than traditional methods."
faqQ4: "Is 1.66 cups of spinach enough for two servings in the air fryer?"
faqA4: "It depends on the recipe. For side dishes, 1.66 cups (3.32 oz) serves two generously. For main dishes like stuffed chicken or spinach pies, you may need to double the quantity.

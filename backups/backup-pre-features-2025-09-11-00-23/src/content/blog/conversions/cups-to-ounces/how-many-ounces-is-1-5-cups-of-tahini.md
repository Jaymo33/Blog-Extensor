faqQ1: "How do I measure 1.5 cups of tahini if I don’t have a scale?"
faqA1: "Use a liquid measuring cup for the most accurate results. Spoon the tahini into the cup and level it off with a spatula. Since tahini is thick, pressing it down slightly can help eliminate air gaps. Remember, 1.5 cups equals 12 ounces."
faqQ2: "Can I use tahini straight from the fridge for air fryer recipes?"
faqA2: "Yes, but it’s easier to measure if you let it sit at room temperature for 10–15 minutes first. Cold tahini can be very thick and harder to scoop accurately. Stirring it well before measuring 1.5 cups (12 ounces) ensures a smooth consistency."
faqQ3: "Does the brand of tahini affect the 1.5 cups to ounces conversion?"
faqA3: "Slightly. Some brands are thicker or more oily, which can change the volume-to-weight ratio. However, 1.5 cups of tahini generally equals 12 ounces (340 grams) across most brands. For precision, weigh it if possible."
faqQ4: "What’s the best way to use 1.5 cups of tahini in air fryer cooking?"
faqA4: "1.5 cups (12 ounces) of tahini works well in marinades, dressings, or as a drizzle. Try it in an air-fryer falafel recipe or as a glaze for roasted vegetables. For more ideas, browse our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable air fryer recipes</a>."

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on even cooking, and incorrect measurements can lead to uneven results.

<p>Many air fryer recipes, especially those involving sauces or dips, require precise tahini measurements. Whether you’re making a tahini-based glaze for roasted vegetables or a creamy dressing for salads, accuracy is key. A kitchen scale can help, but if you’re using cups, knowing that 1.5 cups equals 12 ounces simplifies the process.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure Tahini Correctly</h3>  
<p>Tahini is a thick, sticky paste, so measuring it can be tricky. For the most accurate 1.5 cups (12 ounces), use a liquid measuring cup and level it off with a spatula. Alternatively, weigh it directly on a kitchen scale. If you’re adapting a recipe from grams to cups, remember that 340 grams of tahini equals 1.5 cups or 12 ounces.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for Tahini in Air Fryer Recipes</h2>

From marinades for chicken or tofu to drizzles for roasted vegetables, 1.5 cups (12 ounces) of tahini can go a long way. Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> for inspiration on how to use tahini in your meals.</p>

By measuring 1.5 cups of tahini accurately (12 ounces), you ensure the right balance of flavours and textures in every bite.</p>  

<h3>Converting Tahini Measurements for Different Recipes</h3>  
<p>If a recipe calls for 1.5 cups of tahini (12 ounces) but you only have a jar labelled in grams, this conversion is handy. For UK cooks, 340 grams is the equivalent, making it easy to adjust measurements. Always check your tahini’s consistency, as some brands may be thicker or thinner, slightly affecting the volume-to-weight ratio.</p>  

<h2>Storing Tahini for Air Fryer Recipes</h2>  
<p>Once opened, tahini should be stored in the fridge to maintain freshness. If you’ve measured out 1.5 cups (12 ounces) for a recipe but have leftovers, transfer them to an airtight container.

<p>Tahini can separate over time, so give it a good stir before measuring 1.5 cups (12 ounces). If it’s too thick, a splash of warm water can help loosen it. This ensures accurate measurements and smooth incorporation into your air fryer dishes, whether you’re making sauces, dips, or marinades.</p>  

<h3>Scaling Tahini Quantities for Larger Batches</h3>  
<p>If you’re meal prepping or cooking for a crowd, you might need to scale up your tahini measurements. For example, 3 cups of tahini would be 24 ounces (680 grams). Keeping the 1.5-cups-to-12-ounces ratio in mind makes scaling recipes simple and ensures consistent results every time.</p>

faqQ1: "How do I convert 2.5 cups of agave syrup to grams?"
faqA1: "2.5 cups of agave syrup equals roughly 567 grams. Agave syrup’s density means it weighs slightly more than water, so precise conversions are key for baking. Use a kitchen scale for the most accurate results."
faqQ2: "Can I use honey instead of agave syrup in air fryer recipes?"
faqA2: "Yes, honey can substitute agave syrup, but adjust the quantity slightly. Honey is sweeter and thicker, so use about 1.8 cups (14.4 ounces) to match 2.5 cups of agave syrup. Reduce cooking time slightly to avoid burning."
faqQ3: "Why does my agave syrup measurement seem off?"
faqA3: "Agave syrup’s sticky consistency can lead to air bubbles or residue in measuring cups. Always grease the cup lightly and pour slowly. If your 2.5 cups (20 ounces) seems incorrect, double-check with a scale."
faqQ4: "Is agave syrup healthier than sugar in air fryer recipes?"
faqA4: "Agave syrup has a lower glycemic index than sugar, making it a popular alternative. However, it’s still high in fructose, so moderation is key. In air fryer recipes, it caramelises well without refined sugars."

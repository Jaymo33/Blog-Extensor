faqQ1: "Can I use quick oats instead of rolled oats for 0.66 cup measurements?"
faqA1: "Yes, you can substitute quick oats for rolled oats in the same 0.66 cup (2.64 ounce) measurement, but the texture will be slightly different. Quick oats absorb liquid faster and result in a softer consistency, which might affect air fryer recipes like granola or cookies."
faqQ2: "How does 0.66 cup of rolled oats compare to steel-cut oats in an air fryer?"
faqA2: "Steel-cut oats are denser than rolled oats, so 0.66 cup would weigh more (about 3.5 ounces). They also require longer cooking times in the air fryer and more liquid. For best results, adjust your recipe accordingly or stick to rolled oats for most air fryer applications."
faqQ3: "Why does my air fryer recipe with 0.66 cup oats keep burning?"
faqA3: "Air fryers cook faster than conventional ovens, and oats are particularly susceptible to burning due to their low moisture content. Try reducing the temperature by 10-15°C and checking frequently. Also ensure your 0.66 cup (2.64 oz) measurement is accurate, as too many oats can create dry spots that burn easily."
faqQ4: "Can I freeze portions made with 0.66 cup of rolled oats?"
faqA4: "Absolutely! Recipes using 0.66 cup (2.64 oz) of rolled oats freeze well, especially granola or oat bars. Let them cool completely, then store in airtight containers with parchment between layers. Reheat in the air fryer at 160°C for 3-5 minutes to restore crispiness."

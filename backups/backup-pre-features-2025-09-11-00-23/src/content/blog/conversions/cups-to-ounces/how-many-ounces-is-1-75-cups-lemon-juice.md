faqQ1: "Does bottled lemon juice measure the same as fresh for the 1.75 cups to ounces conversion?"
faqA1: "Yes, bottled and fresh lemon juice have the same liquid volume measurement. 1.75 cups equals 14 fluid ounces whether you're using fresh squeezed or bottled juice. However, fresh lemon juice may have slightly more variability in acidity and flavour."
faqQ2: "Can I use this same conversion for other citrus juices like lime or orange?"
faqA2: "Absolutely. The 1.75 cups to 14 ounces conversion works for any liquid with similar viscosity to water, including all citrus juices. Lime, orange, and grapefruit juice all follow the same measurement standards when converting cups to fluid ounces for air fryer recipes."
faqQ3: "How many lemons do I need to get 1.75 cups (14 ounces) of juice?"
faqA3: "You'll need about 7 medium-sized lemons to yield 1.75 cups (14 ounces) of juice. Each lemon typically gives about 1/4 cup (2 ounces) of juice. For consistent measurements in air fryer cooking, consider using bottled juice or juicing extra lemons to account for variations."
faqQ4: "Why is precise measurement important when using lemon juice in air fryer recipes?"
faqA4: "Precise measurements ensure proper cooking chemistry in your air fryer. Too much lemon juice (more than 14 ounces for 1.75 cups) can make food overly acidic or affect browning. Too little might not provide enough flavour or tenderising action. Accurate conversions help achieve perfect results every time."

<h3>The science behind liquid measurements</h3>
<p>Lemon juice, like all liquids, has a standard conversion rate from cups to fluid ounces. In the UK and US, 1 cup equals 8 fluid ounces, making 1.75 cups equal to 14 fluid ounces. This measurement stays consistent whether you're using fresh squeezed or bottled lemon juice in your air fryer creations.</p>

<h2>How to measure lemon juice accurately</h2>

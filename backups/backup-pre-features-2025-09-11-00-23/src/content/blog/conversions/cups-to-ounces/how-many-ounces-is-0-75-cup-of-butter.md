faqQ1: "Can I use margarine instead of butter for 0.75 cup in air fryer recipes?"
faqA1: "Yes, you can substitute margarine for butter in most air fryer recipes. However, margarine has a higher water content, which might affect the texture of your dish. For best results, use a 1:1 ratio, but expect slight differences in flavour and crispiness."
faqQ2: "How do I measure 0.75 cup of butter without a measuring cup?"
faqA2: "You can use the markings on a standard butter wrapper—most UK blocks are 250g (1 cup). Cut off three-quarters of the block for 0.75 cup (6 ounces). Alternatively, use a kitchen scale to weigh out 6 ounces of butter."
faqQ3: "Does 0.75 cup of melted butter weigh the same as solid butter?"
faqA3: "Yes, 0.75 cup of melted butter still weighs 6 ounces. However, measuring melted butter by volume can be less accurate, so it’s best to measure it in its solid form before melting."
faqQ4: "What’s the best way to clean butter residue from my air fryer?"
faqA4: "For stubborn butter residue, use a mixture of warm water and mild detergent. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner</a> guide for more detailed tips on keeping your appliance spotless."

<h2>How to measure 0.75 cup of butter</h2>  
<p>Measuring 0.75 cup of butter can be tricky if you don’t have a measuring cup handy. One easy way is to use the markings on the butter wrapper. A standard UK block of butter is 250g, which is roughly 1 cup or 8 ounces. So, 0.75 cup would be three-quarters of that block, equalling 6 ounces.</p>

<p>One common mistake is confusing weight and volume. Ounces can refer to both, but in this case, we’re talking about weight (6 ounces).

<h2>Converting 0.75 cup of butter to other units</h2>  
<p>If you need to convert 0.75 cup of butter to grams, it’s approximately 170g. This is useful for UK bakers who often use metric measurements.

<h3>Butter substitutes in air fryer recipes</h3>

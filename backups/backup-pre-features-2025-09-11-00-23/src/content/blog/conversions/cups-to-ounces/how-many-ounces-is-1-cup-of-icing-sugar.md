faqQ1: "Is 1 cup of icing sugar the same as 1 cup of granulated sugar in ounces?"
faqA1: "No, granulated sugar is denser. While 1 cup of icing sugar weighs around 4.41 oz, granulated sugar is closer to 7 oz per cup. Always check the specific type of sugar your recipe uses for accurate measurements."
faqQ2: "Can I use a measuring cup instead of a scale for icing sugar?"
faqA2: "Yes, but for precision, a scale is best. Measuring cups can vary, and how you fill them (scooping vs. spooning) affects the weight. If using a cup, spoon the sugar in lightly and level it off for consistency."
faqQ3: "Why does my air fryer dessert taste too sweet?"
faqA3: "Over-measuring icing sugar is a common cause. Even a small excess can overpower other flavours. Weigh your sugar or use the spoon-and-level method to avoid this issue in air fryer baking."
faqQ4: "How do I convert ounces to grams for icing sugar?"
faqA4: "1 ounce equals roughly 28.35 grams. So, 4.41 oz of icing sugar is about 125 grams. This conversion is handy for UK recipes or when using a scale that measures in grams."

<p>1 cup of icing sugar equals approximately 4.41 ounces (125 grams) in the UK. This measurement is essential for baking, especially when using an air fryer for desserts like cakes or cookies. Getting the right weight ensures your recipes turn out perfectly every time.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Baking is a science, and precise measurements are crucial. Using too much or too little icing sugar can affect texture, sweetness, and even cooking times. For air fryer recipes, consistency is key—whether you’re making <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>air fryer cakes</a> or dusting desserts. A slight variation can lead to dry or overly sweet results.</p>  

<p>Many bakers prefer weighing ingredients for accuracy. Cups can vary in size, but ounces provide a standardised measurement. If you’re using an <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>, knowing the exact weight helps adapt recipes seamlessly.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure Icing Sugar Correctly</h3>  
<p>For the most accurate results, use a kitchen scale. Spoon the icing sugar into your measuring cup lightly—don’t pack it down. Level it off with a knife for an even measure. This method prevents over-pouring, which can throw off your recipe.</p>  

<h2>Converting Cups to Ounces for Air Fryer Recipes</h2>  
<p>Air fryers cook faster than conventional ovens, so ingredient ratios matter. If a recipe calls for 1 cup of icing sugar (4.41 oz), ensure you’re using the correct weight. This is especially important for <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cookies>air fryer cookies</a>, where sugar affects spread and crispness.</p>

<h3>Common Mistakes When Measuring Icing Sugar</h3>  
<p>Avoid scooping directly from the bag—it compacts the sugar, leading to excess. Sifting before measuring ensures a lighter, fluffier consistency. If your air fryer dessert turns out too dense, incorrect sugar measurement might be the culprit.</p>  

<h2>UK vs. US Measurements</h2>  
<p>In the UK, 1 cup of icing sugar is typically 4.41 oz (125g), while US cups may differ slightly. Always check the origin of your recipe. For <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> recipes, we use UK measurements for accuracy.</p>  

<p>When adapting US recipes, a digital scale is your best friend. Converting cups to ounces eliminates guesswork, ensuring your air fryer bakes are consistently delicious.</p>  

<h3>Tips for Storing Icing Sugar</h3>  
<p>Keep icing sugar in an airtight container to prevent clumping. Humidity can affect its texture, making it harder to measure. If lumps form, sift before use—especially important for air fryer recipes where even distribution matters.</p>

faqQ1: "Can I use ground flaxseed instead of whole flaxseed in air fryer recipes?"
faqA1: "Yes, ground flaxseed works well in air fryer recipes, but the texture will be finer. Use the same weight—0.375 cup equals 1.5 ounces—whether using whole or ground. Keep in mind that ground flaxseed absorbs more liquid, so adjust other ingredients if needed."
faqQ2: "How do I toast flaxseed in an air fryer?"
faqA2: "Spread 0.375 cup (1.5 oz) of flaxseed evenly in the air fryer basket. Cook at 160°C for 3–4 minutes, shaking halfway. Toasting enhances the nutty flavour, but watch closely to prevent burning. Let it cool before using in recipes."
faqQ3: "Is 0.375 cup of flaxseed the same as 6 tablespoons?"
faqA3: "Yes, 0.375 cup of flaxseed is equivalent to 6 tablespoons. This measurement converts to roughly 1.5 ounces by weight, which is handy for recipes requiring precision. Always level off tablespoons for accuracy."
faqQ4: "Can I substitute flaxseed for breadcrumbs in air fryer recipes?"
faqA4: "Absolutely! Flaxseed makes a nutritious, gluten-free alternative to breadcrumbs. Use 0.375 cup (1.5 oz) to coat chicken, fish, or veggies. For extra crispiness, mix with a bit of grated Parmesan or almond flour before air frying."

faqQ1: "Can I use skimmed milk instead of whole milk for 0.375 cup in air fryer recipes?"
faqA1: "Yes, you can substitute skimmed milk, but the texture may differ slightly. Whole milk adds richness due to its higher fat content, so your dish might be less creamy. For 0.375 cup (3 ounces), the volume remains the same, but the outcome could vary in recipes like sauces or baked goods."
faqQ2: "How do I measure 0.375 cup of whole milk without a measuring cup?"
faqA2: "If you don’t have a measuring cup, use a kitchen scale to weigh out 3 ounces of whole milk. Alternatively, 0.375 cup is half of a ¾ cup measure. You can also use tablespoons—0.375 cup equals 6 tablespoons, which is easier to measure with standard spoons."
faqQ3: "Why do some air fryer recipes use ounces instead of cups for milk?"
faqA3: "Ounces provide a more accurate measurement, especially for liquids like whole milk. Air fryer cooking often requires precision to ensure even heating and proper texture. Using weight (ounces) eliminates variability caused by how the milk is poured or settled in a measuring cup."
faqQ4: "Does 0.375 cup of whole milk weigh the same as other liquids in the air fryer?"
faqA4: "No, different liquids have different densities. While 0.375 cup of whole milk weighs 3 ounces, water or oil would weigh slightly different amounts. Always check specific conversions for each ingredient to ensure accuracy in your air fryer recipes."

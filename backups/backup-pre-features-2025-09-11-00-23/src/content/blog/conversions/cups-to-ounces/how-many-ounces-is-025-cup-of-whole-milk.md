faqQ1: "Can I use skim milk instead of whole milk for 0.25 cup measurements?"
faqA1: "Yes, you can substitute skim milk for whole milk in a 0.25 cup (2-ounce) measurement. However, skim milk has less fat, which may slightly alter the texture of your dish. For best results, stick to whole milk unless the recipe specifies otherwise."
faqQ2: "How do I measure 0.25 cup of whole milk without a measuring cup?"
faqA2: "If you don’t have a measuring cup, you can use a kitchen scale to weigh out 2 ounces of whole milk. Alternatively, 0.25 cup is equivalent to 4 tablespoons, which you can measure using a tablespoon measure."
faqQ3: "Does 0.25 cup of whole milk weigh the same as 0.25 cup of water?"
faqA3: "No, 0.25 cup of whole milk weighs slightly more than water due to its fat content. While water weighs 2 ounces per 0.25 cup, whole milk weighs approximately 2.1 ounces. For most recipes, the difference is negligible."
faqQ4: "Can I freeze 0.25 cup portions of whole milk for later use?"
faqA4: "Yes, you can freeze whole milk in 0.25 cup (2-ounce) portions for up to 3 months. Thaw it in the fridge before using, and give it a good stir, as the texture may change slightly. This is handy for prepping air fryer recipes in advance."

faqQ1: "Can I use 0.66 cup of evaporated milk instead of regular milk?"
faqA1: "Yes, you can substitute evaporated milk for regular milk, but keep in mind it’s thicker and richer. For 0.66 cup (5.28 ounces) of regular milk, dilute evaporated milk with an equal part water to maintain the right consistency in your air fryer recipe."
faqQ2: "How do I measure 0.66 cup of milk without a measuring cup?"
faqA2: "If you don’t have a measuring cup, use a kitchen scale to weigh out 5.28 ounces of milk. Alternatively, fill a standard cup two-thirds full for a rough estimate. For precision, though, investing in a liquid measuring cup is best."
faqQ3: "Does the type of milk affect the conversion from cups to ounces?"
faqA3: "No, the type of milk (whole, skim, or plant-based) doesn’t change the volume-to-weight conversion. 0.66 cup of any milk will still be approximately 5.28 ounces. However, fat content can slightly alter density, but the difference is negligible for most recipes."
faqQ4: "Why do some air fryer recipes use ounces instead of cups?"
faqA4: "Ounces provide a more accurate measurement, especially for liquids like milk. Since air fryers cook quickly and evenly, precise amounts (like 5.28 ounces for 0.66 cup) help ensure consistent results. Cups can vary based on how you fill them, but weight measurements don’t lie."

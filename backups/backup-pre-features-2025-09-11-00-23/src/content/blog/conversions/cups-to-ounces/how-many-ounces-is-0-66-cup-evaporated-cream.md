faqQ1: "Can I use regular cream instead of evaporated cream in air fryer recipes?"
faqA1: "Yes, you can substitute regular cream for evaporated cream, but keep in mind that regular cream has a higher fat content. If replacing 0.66 cup of evaporated cream (5.28 oz), use the same amount of regular cream but expect a richer result. Adjust cooking times slightly to account for the difference in consistency."
faqQ2: "How do I store leftover evaporated cream after measuring 0.66 cup?"
faqA2: "Leftover evaporated cream should be transferred to an airtight container and refrigerated. It typically lasts 3–5 days. If you’ve measured out 0.66 cup (5.28 oz), ensure the remaining cream is sealed properly to maintain freshness. For longer storage, consider freezing it in portion-sized containers."
faqQ3: "Why is my air fryer recipe with evaporated cream too runny?"
faqA3: "If your dish turns out runny, you may have used too much liquid or not cooked it long enough. Double-check your measurements—0.66 cup of evaporated cream should be 5.28 oz. Also, ensure your air fryer is preheated and that you’re using the right temperature for the recipe."
faqQ4: "Can I use evaporated milk instead of evaporated cream in air fryer recipes?"
faqA4: "Evaporated milk can be used as a substitute, but it’s less rich than evaporated cream. If replacing 0.66 cup (5.28 oz) of evaporated cream, you might need to add a thickener like cornflour to achieve a similar consistency. Adjust other ingredients accordingly to balance the flavour."

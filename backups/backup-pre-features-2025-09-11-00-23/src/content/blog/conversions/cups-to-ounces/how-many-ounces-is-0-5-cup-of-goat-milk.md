faqQ1: "Can I use goat milk instead of cow's milk in air fryer recipes?"
faqA1: "Yes, goat milk can be substituted 1:1 for cow's milk in air fryer recipes. Use 0.5 cup (4 ounces) of goat milk wherever cow's milk is called for. Note that goat milk has a slightly tangier flavour and may brown faster, so adjust cooking times if needed."
faqQ2: "Does 0.5 cup of goat milk weigh the same as 0.5 cup of water?"
faqA2: "No, 0.5 cup of goat milk weighs around 4 ounces, while water weighs approximately 4.17 ounces per 0.5 cup. The slight difference is due to goat milk's density and fat content. Always measure by weight for precision in air fryer recipes."
faqQ3: "How do I store leftover goat milk for air fryer cooking?"
faqA3: "Store opened goat milk in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 5 days. Shake well before using, as separation is natural. For longer storage, freeze in 0.5 cup (4-ounce) portions and thaw before adding to recipes."
faqQ4: "Why does my air fryer recipe taste different with goat milk?"
faqA4: "Goat milk has a distinct, slightly tangy flavour compared to cow's milk. This can alter the taste of dishes like custards or cakes. For neutral results, try mixing goat milk with a splash of vanilla extract or honey to balance the flavour."

<h3>How to measure 0.5 cup of goat milk accurately</h3>  
<p>Use a liquid measuring cup for the most accurate results. Fill it to the 0.5 cup mark, ensuring the milk sits level at eye height. If weighing, 4 ounces is your target. For sticky or thick goat milk, lightly grease the measuring cup first. This ensures the milk slides out easily, leaving no residue behind. Proper measuring tools are a must for air fryer success.</p>

<h3>Adjusting recipes with goat milk</h3>  
<p>If a recipe calls for 0.5 cup of cow's milk, you can substitute the same amount of goat milk (4 ounces) without adjustments. However, goat milk may brown faster due to its sugar content. Reduce air fryer temperature by 5°C if needed. Always preheat your air fryer for even cooking, especially with dairy-based recipes.</p>

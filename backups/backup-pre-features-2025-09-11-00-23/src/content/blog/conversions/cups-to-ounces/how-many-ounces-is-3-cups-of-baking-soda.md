faqQ1: "How do I convert 3 cups of baking soda to grams?"
faqA1: "3 cups of baking soda equals roughly 680 grams. Since 1 ounce is approximately 28.35 grams, multiplying 24 ounces by 28.35 gives you the gram equivalent. For precise air fryer recipes, a digital scale is recommended."
faqQ2: "Does the type of baking soda affect the weight per cup?"
faqA2: "Most standard baking sodas have similar densities, so the weight per cup remains consistent. However, if your baking soda is clumpy or compacted, it’s best to sift it before measuring to ensure accuracy, especially for air fryer batters."
faqQ3: "Can I use baking powder instead of baking soda in air fryer recipes?"
faqA3: "Baking powder isn’t a direct substitute, as it’s less potent. Use 3 times the amount of baking powder if substituting, but note it may alter texture. For best results, stick to the recipe’s specified ingredient."
faqQ4: "How should I store leftover baking soda after measuring 3 cups?"
faqA4: "Keep baking soda in an airtight container in a cool, dry place. Exposure to moisture can cause clumping, making future measurements less accurate. Proper storage ensures it stays fresh for air fryer recipes and cleaning uses."

<p>3 cups of baking soda equals approximately 24 ounces. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes, where precise measurements can make or break your dish. Whether you're prepping a crispy coating or a baking soda-based cleaner for your air fryer, knowing the exact weight ensures consistency.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>

<h3>How to measure 3 cups of baking soda correctly</h3>  
<p>Use a dry measuring cup and level off the top with a straight edge for accuracy. Avoid packing the baking soda down, as this can lead to over-measuring. If you have a kitchen scale, weighing 24 ounces (680 grams) is even more reliable. This method is especially useful for air fryer recipes requiring consistency.</p>

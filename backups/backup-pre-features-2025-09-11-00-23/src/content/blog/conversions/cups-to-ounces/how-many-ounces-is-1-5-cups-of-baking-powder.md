faqQ1: "How do I convert 1.5 cups of baking powder to grams?"
faqA1: "1.5 cups of baking powder is roughly 340 grams. For air fryer recipes, using grams can be more precise than ounces, especially when baking. Always use a digital scale for the best results."
faqQ2: "Does the type of baking powder affect the weight per cup?"
faqA2: "Most baking powders weigh similarly, but double-acting varieties may have slight differences. Always check the packaging for specific weight guidelines, especially for air fryer recipes where precision matters."
faqQ3: "Can I use 1.5 cups of baking soda instead of baking powder?"
faqA3: "No, baking soda is much stronger. You’d only need about 0.5 cups of baking soda to match the leavening power of 1.5 cups of baking powder. Substituting incorrectly can ruin your air fryer bakes."
faqQ4: "Why does my air fryer recipe need exact baking powder measurements?"
faqA4: "Air fryers cook faster and hotter than conventional ovens, so precise measurements prevent over- or under-rising. Too much baking powder can cause bitter tastes, while too little leads to dense textures. Always measure carefully."

<p>1.5 cups of baking powder equals approximately 12 ounces (oz) in UK measurements. This conversion is essential for precise baking, especially when using an air fryer where ingredient ratios can make or break a recipe. Whether you’re whipping up cakes or savoury dishes, knowing the exact weight ensures consistent results. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we focus on helping you master measurements for flawless cooking.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer baking</h2>  
<p>Baking powder is a leavening agent, and using the wrong amount can lead to dense or overly puffed dishes. In an air fryer, where heat circulates rapidly, precise measurements are even more critical. Too much baking powder can cause uneven rising, while too little may leave your bakes flat. For perfect results, always measure by weight when possible. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for other common ingredient conversions.</p>  

<p>Many air fryer recipes, like those in our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>cake category</a>, rely on exact ratios. A slight deviation can alter texture and taste. If you’re converting from volume (cups) to weight (ounces), a kitchen scale is your best friend. This is especially true for UK bakers, where cup sizes can vary slightly from US standards.</p>  

<h3>How to measure 1.5 cups of baking powder correctly</h3>  
<p>To measure 1.5 cups of baking powder accurately, fluff the powder first with a spoon to avoid compacting it. Then, lightly spoon it into a measuring cup and level it off with a straight edge. For the most precise results, weigh it on a digital scale—12 ounces is your target. This method eliminates guesswork and ensures your air fryer recipes turn out perfectly every time.</p>  

<h2>Common baking powder conversions for air fryer recipes</h2>  
<p>Beyond 1.5 cups, here are other handy conversions for baking powder: 1 cup equals 8 ounces, and 0.5 cups equal 4 ounces. These measurements are useful when scaling recipes up or down for your air fryer. If you’re preparing smaller batches, like cookies from our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cookies>cookie category</a>, these conversions will come in handy.</p>  

<p>Remember, baking powder’s effectiveness can diminish over time. Always check the expiry date before use. If your bakes aren’t rising as expected, your baking powder might need replacing.

<h3>Adjusting recipes for different air fryer models</h3>  
<p>Not all air fryers cook the same way. Some models have stronger fans or varying heat distributions, which can affect baking times. If you’re adapting a recipe, start with the correct 1.5 cups (12 ounces) of baking powder, then tweak cooking times as needed.

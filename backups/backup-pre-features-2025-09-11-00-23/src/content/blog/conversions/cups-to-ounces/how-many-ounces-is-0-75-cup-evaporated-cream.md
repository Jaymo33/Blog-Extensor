faqQ1: "Can I use regular milk instead of evaporated cream in my air fryer recipes?"
faqA1: "Yes, but evaporated cream is thicker and richer, so the results will differ. If substituting, use heavy cream or a mix of milk and butter for a closer texture. Keep in mind that 0.75 cup of evaporated cream (6 oz) won't behave the same as regular milk in recipes."
faqQ2: "How do I store leftover evaporated cream after measuring 0.75 cup?"
faqA2: "Transfer any unused evaporated cream to an airtight container and refrigerate for up to 5 days. Make sure it's sealed properly to prevent absorption of other flavours. You can also freeze it for longer storage, though the texture may change slightly when thawed."
faqQ3: "Why is my air fryer recipe too runny when using 0.75 cup of evaporated cream?"
faqA3: "This could happen if the cream wasn't measured accurately or if other wet ingredients were over-poured. Always use a liquid measuring cup for 0.75 cup (6 oz) of evaporated cream and adjust other liquids accordingly. Air fryer recipes often need precise ratios for the best texture."
faqQ4: "Are there low-fat alternatives to evaporated cream for air fryer cooking?"
faqA4: "Yes, you can use evaporated skimmed milk, but it will be less rich. For 0.75 cup (6 oz), the substitution works, but expect a lighter consistency. If you're making desserts or sauces, you might need to adjust other ingredients to compensate for the reduced fat content."

<p>0.75 cup of evaporated cream equals approximately 6 ounces, making it easy to measure for your air fryer recipes.

<h2>Understanding the conversion from cups to ounces</h2>  
<p>Converting cups to ounces can be tricky, especially with ingredients like evaporated cream, which has a thicker consistency than regular milk.

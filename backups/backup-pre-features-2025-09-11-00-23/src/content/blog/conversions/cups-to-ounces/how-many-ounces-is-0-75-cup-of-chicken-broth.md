faqQ1: "Can I use stock instead of broth for 0.75 cup measurements?"
faqA1: "Yes, you can substitute stock for broth in the same quantity (0.75 cup or 6 fl oz). However, stock is typically richer, so you may want to dilute it slightly with water for a milder flavour in air fryer recipes."
faqQ2: "How do I measure 0.75 cup of chicken broth without a measuring cup?"
faqA2: "If you don’t have a measuring cup, use a standard mug and fill it just over halfway (about 60% full) to approximate 0.75 cup. Alternatively, use 12 level tablespoons, as each tablespoon is 0.5 fl oz."
faqQ3: "Does the type of chicken broth affect the ounce measurement?"
faqA3: "No, the ounce measurement remains the same whether you use homemade, canned, or powdered chicken broth reconstituted with water. However, thicker broths may weigh slightly more due to higher density."
faqQ4: "Can I use this conversion for other liquids in air fryer recipes?"
faqA4: "Yes, the 0.75 cup to 6 fl oz conversion works for most thin liquids like water, milk, or oil. Thicker liquids like cream or syrup may vary slightly in weight but will have the same volume measurement."

<p>0.75 cup of chicken broth equals 6 fluid ounces (fl oz) in the UK. This measurement is essential for precise cooking, especially when using an air fryer where accurate liquid quantities can affect texture and flavour. Whether you’re preparing soups, stews, or marinades, knowing this conversion ensures your dish turns out perfectly every time.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Using the correct amount of chicken broth is crucial for air fryer recipes, as liquids help maintain moisture and prevent drying. Too much broth can make food soggy, while too little may lead to uneven cooking. For example, when making a chicken dish in the air fryer, 0.75 cup of chicken broth (6 fl oz) is often ideal for basting or creating a sauce.

<p>Precision is key when adapting traditional recipes for the air fryer. Many recipes call for chicken broth in cups, but ounces are easier to measure with a kitchen scale.

<h3>How to Measure 0.75 Cup of Chicken Broth Without a Scale</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a kitchen scale, you can still measure 0.75 cup of chicken broth accurately. Use a liquid measuring cup and fill it to the three-quarter mark. Alternatively, 6 fluid ounces is equivalent to 12 tablespoons or 177 millilitres. This method works well for recipes like air fryer soups or braised dishes where broth is a key ingredient.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for 0.75 Cup of Chicken Broth in Air Fryer Recipes</h2>

faqQ1: "Can I use frozen diced peppers instead of fresh?"
faqA1: "Yes, frozen diced peppers can be used, but they may release more moisture during cooking. Reduce cooking time slightly and pat them dry before air frying for better results."
faqQ2: "Do different coloured peppers weigh the same?"
faqA2: "Red, yellow, and green peppers have similar weights when diced, but red peppers are slightly sweeter and denser. The difference is minimal, so you can use them interchangeably in recipes."
faqQ3: "How do I convert ounces to grams for diced peppers?"
faqA3: "1 ounce equals roughly 28 grams, so 5.3 ounces is about 150 grams. Most kitchen scales allow you to switch between units for easy measuring."
faqQ4: "Can I substitute bell peppers with hotter varieties?"
faqA4: "Yes, but adjust the quantity based on heat preference. Jalapeños or habaneros are much spicier, so start with half the amount and taste as you cook."

<h3>How to measure diced peppers correctly</h3>

Remember that smaller dice will fit more tightly into a cup, potentially increasing the weight slightly. For best results, stick to the 5.3-ounce benchmark.</p>

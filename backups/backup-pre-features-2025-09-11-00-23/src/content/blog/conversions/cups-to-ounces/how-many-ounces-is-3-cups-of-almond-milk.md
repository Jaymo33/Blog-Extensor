faqQ1: "Is 3 cups of almond milk the same as 3 cups of regular milk in ounces?"
faqA1: "Yes, 3 cups of almond milk and 3 cups of regular milk both equal 24 ounces in volume. However, almond milk is slightly less dense, so its weight may vary slightly. For air fryer recipes, the ounce measurement is more important than weight."
faqQ2: "Can I use a kitchen scale to measure 3 cups of almond milk in ounces?"
faqA2: "While a kitchen scale measures weight, not volume, you can approximate 24 ounces of almond milk by weighing it. One fluid ounce of almond milk weighs roughly 1.04 ounces, so 24 fluid ounces would be close to 25 ounces by weight. For precision, stick to liquid measuring cups."
faqQ3: "How do I convert 3 cups of almond milk to millilitres?"
faqA3: "3 cups of almond milk equals about 710 millilitres. This conversion is handy for recipes using metric measurements. If you're adjusting an air fryer recipe, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a> can help with other units too."
faqQ4: "Does the brand of almond milk affect the 3-cup-to-ounces conversion?"
faqA4: "No, the brand doesn’t change the volume conversion—3 cups will always be 24 ounces. However, thicker or sweetened varieties may pour slightly differently. For consistent results in air fryer cooking, stick to unsweetened almond milk unless the recipe specifies otherwise."

faqQ1: "Can I use whole coriander seeds instead of ground coriander?"
faqA1: "Yes, but you’ll need to adjust the quantity. Whole coriander seeds are less dense, so 1.5 cups would weigh slightly less. For air fryer recipes, grinding the seeds fresh can enhance flavour, but ensure you measure after grinding for accuracy."
faqQ2: "How long does ground coriander last in storage?"
faqA2: "Properly stored in an airtight container, ground coriander retains its potency for about 6 months. For air fryer recipes, fresher spices yield better results, so consider buying in smaller quantities if you don’t use it often."
faqQ3: "Does the brand of ground coriander affect the weight per cup?"
faqA3: "Slight variations can occur due to processing methods, but most commercial ground coriander weighs similarly. For precision in air fryer cooking, weighing is best, especially for recipes like spice rubs or marinades."
faqQ4: "Can I substitute ground coriander with another spice?"
faqA4: "While no spice replicates coriander’s unique flavour, cumin or garam masala can work in a pinch. Adjust quantities to taste, and remember that substitutions may alter the dish’s profile, especially in air fryer recipes."

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>
<p>Air fryers rely on precise ingredient ratios to achieve the best results. Too much or too little agave syrup can affect texture, browning, and overall taste. For example, a sticky glaze might become too runny or overly thick if measurements are off. This is particularly important in recipes like air-fried desserts or glazed meats.

<p>Agave syrup is denser than water, so volume-to-weight conversions aren’t always straightforward. A standard cup holds 8 ounces of water, but agave syrup weighs more due to its viscosity. That’s why 0.66 cup translates to 5.28 ounces rather than 5.28 fluid ounces. Always use a kitchen scale for the most accurate results, especially when adapting recipes for your air fryer.</p>

<h3>How to measure 0.66 cup of agave syrup</h3>
<p>Measuring 0.66 cup of agave syrup can be tricky without the right tools. Use a liquid measuring cup with clear markings for the most accuracy. Alternatively, weigh it out on a digital scale set to ounces. If you don’t have a scale, remember that 1 tablespoon of agave syrup is roughly 0.75 ounces, so 0.66 cup would be about 7 tablespoons.

<h2>Common uses for agave syrup in air fryer recipes</h2>
<p>Agave syrup works wonderfully in air fryer recipes, from glazes to baked goods. It caramelises beautifully, adding a rich flavour to dishes like air-fried chicken wings or roasted vegetables.

<h3>Storing and handling agave syrup</h3>
<p>Agave syrup should be stored in a cool, dry place to maintain its quality. Once opened, it can last up to a year if sealed properly. Its sticky nature means it can be messy to measure, so lightly greasing your measuring cup or spoon can help. After use, clean your air fryer thoroughly to avoid sticky residue—our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning guide</a> has handy tips.</p>

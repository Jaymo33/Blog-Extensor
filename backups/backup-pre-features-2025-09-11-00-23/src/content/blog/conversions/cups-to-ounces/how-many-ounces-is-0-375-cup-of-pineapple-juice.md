faqQ1: "Can I use fresh pineapple juice instead of canned for 0.375 cup measurements?"
faqA1: "Yes, fresh pineapple juice works just as well as canned for measuring 0.375 cup (3 oz). However, fresh juice may have a stronger flavour, so adjust other ingredients if needed. Strain it to remove pulp for a smoother consistency in marinades or glazes."
faqQ2: "How does 0.375 cup of pineapple juice affect cooking time in an air fryer?"
faqA2: "Using 0.375 cup (3 oz) of pineapple juice in marinades or glazes may slightly increase cooking time due to added moisture. To prevent sogginess, pat proteins dry before air frying or reduce the liquid slightly. Always check for doneness with a meat thermometer."
faqQ3: "What’s the best way to store leftover pineapple juice after measuring 0.375 cup?"
faqA3: "Store leftover pineapple juice in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 5 days. Freeze it in ice cube trays for longer storage, then thaw as needed. This makes it easy to measure small amounts like 0.375 cup for future air fryer recipes."
faqQ4: "Can I substitute another fruit juice for 0.375 cup of pineapple juice in air fryer recipes?"
faqA4: "Orange or mango juice can work as substitutes for 0.375 cup (3 oz) of pineapple juice, but they’ll alter the flavour profile. Adjust sweetness or acidity as needed. For best results, stick to pineapple juice in recipes where its unique tang is key."

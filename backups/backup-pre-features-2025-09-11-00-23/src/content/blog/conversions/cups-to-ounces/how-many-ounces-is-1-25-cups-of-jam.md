faqQ1: "Can I use any type of jam for this conversion?"
faqA1: "Yes, the conversion of 1.25 cups of jam to 10 ounces applies to most types of jam, including strawberry, raspberry, and apricot. However, thicker jams or preserves might vary slightly in weight, so a kitchen scale can help ensure accuracy."
faqQ2: "How do I measure 1.25 cups of jam without a measuring cup?"
faqA2: "If you don’t have a measuring cup, use a kitchen scale to weigh out 10 ounces of jam. Alternatively, a standard mug holds roughly 1 cup, so you can estimate 1.25 cups by filling it just over the three-quarter mark."
faqQ3: "Why does my jam measurement seem off when I weigh it?"
faqA3: "Jam density can vary based on sugar content and fruit type, which might cause slight discrepancies. For precision, always level off the measuring cup or use a scale. Stirring the jam first can also help distribute any settled fruit or syrup."
faqQ4: "Can I substitute jelly for jam in this measurement?"
faqA4: "Yes, jelly can generally be substituted for jam in the same quantity (1.25 cups equals 10 ounces). However, jelly is often smoother and less dense, so adjust cooking times slightly if using it in air fryer recipes to prevent burning."

This method is especially useful for sticky ingredients like jam, ensuring you get the exact amount needed for your recipe.</p>

<h2>Tips for Working with Jam in the Air Fryer</h2>

faqQ1: "Does the type of pepper affect the weight per cup?"
faqA1: "Yes, different peppers have varying densities. Bell peppers are heavier due to their thick walls, while chillies and jalapeños weigh less. For 2.5 cups, bell peppers average 10 ounces, but thinner peppers may be slightly lighter."
faqQ2: "Can I use a kitchen scale instead of measuring cups?"
faqA2: "Absolutely! A kitchen scale is more accurate for measuring diced peppers. Simply set it to ounces and weigh out 10 ounces for the equivalent of 2.5 cups. This method eliminates packing inconsistencies."
faqQ3: "How do I store leftover diced peppers for air frying later?"
faqA3: "Store them in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 3 days. For longer storage, freeze them in portions. When ready to use, air fry straight from frozen, adding a minute or two to the cooking time."
faqQ4: "Why does my air fryer recipe specify weight instead of cups?"
faqA4: "Weight measurements are more precise, ensuring consistent results. Cups can vary based on how ingredients are packed. Recipes on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> often include both for flexibility."

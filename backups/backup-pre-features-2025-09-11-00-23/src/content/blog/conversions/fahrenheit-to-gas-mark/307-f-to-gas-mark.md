<h2>Using 307 F in Air Fryers</h2>
<p>Modern air fryers typically display temperatures in Celsius or Fahrenheit, but understanding the Gas Mark equivalent helps when adapting traditional recipes. At 307°F (Gas Mark 2), your air fryer can handle everything from dehydrating fruits to baking delicate financiers. The rapid air circulation means you'll often need to reduce cooking times by 15-20% compared to conventional oven instructions.</p>

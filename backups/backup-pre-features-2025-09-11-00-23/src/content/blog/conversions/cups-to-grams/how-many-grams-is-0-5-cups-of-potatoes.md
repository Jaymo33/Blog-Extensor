<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on hot air circulation, so ingredient quantities directly impact cooking times and textures. Using 0.5 cups of potatoes (75 grams) ensures even cooking without overcrowding the basket. Overloading can lead to unevenly cooked or soggy results, while too little may cause burning. Whether you’re making crispy roast potatoes or a quick side dish, precise measurements help. Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>potato recipes</a> for inspiration on using this measurement.</p>  

<p>Different potato varieties, like russet or sweet potatoes, may have slight weight variations per 0.5 cups. However, 75 grams works well for most common types when diced uniformly. For best results, use a kitchen scale to confirm the weight, especially if your recipe calls for grams. This small step can make a big difference in your air fryer’s performance.

faqQ1: "Is 0.5 cups of rolled oats the same as quick oats in grams?"
faqA1: "No, quick oats are denser due to finer cutting, so 0.5 cups weigh slightly more (about 50g). Rolled oats (45g per 0.5 cups) have a fluffier texture. Always check your recipe for the correct oat type."
faqQ2: "Can I use this conversion for steel-cut oats?"
faqA2: "Steel-cut oats are heavier, with 0.5 cups weighing around 80g. They require longer cooking times and aren't interchangeable with rolled oats in most air fryer recipes without adjustments."
faqQ3: "Why does my air fryer recipe specify grams instead of cups?"
faqA3: "Grams ensure precision, especially in air fryers where even heat distribution affects cooking. Volume measurements (cups) can vary, but weight (grams) guarantees consistency across all recipes."
faqQ4: "How do I store leftover rolled oats after measuring?"
faqA4: "Keep oats in an airtight container in a cool, dry place. For longer freshness, refrigerate or freeze them. Proper storage prevents staleness and maintains quality for future air fryer recipes."

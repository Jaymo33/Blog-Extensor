faqQ1: "Does the type of sugar affect the cup-to-gram conversion?"
faqA1: "Yes, different sugars have varying densities. Granulated sugar weighs about 200 grams per cup, while caster sugar is slightly finer and may weigh less. Brown sugar, being moister, is heavier – packed brown sugar weighs around 220 grams per cup. Always check specific conversion charts for accuracy."
faqQ2: "Can I use volume measurements instead of weighing sugar for air fryer recipes?"
faqA2: "While you can use cup measurements, weighing ingredients (especially sugar) gives more consistent results in air fryer baking. The rapid air circulation means precise quantities matter more than in conventional ovens. For best results, invest in an inexpensive kitchen scale for perfect bakes every time."
faqQ3: "Why does my air fryer recipe taste too sweet even with 2.25 cups of sugar?"
faqA3: "Air fryers intensify flavours due to their concentrated heat. If your 450 grams of sugar seems overpowering, try reducing it by 10-15% next time. Also ensure you're using granulated sugar (not icing sugar) as specified, as substitutions can dramatically affect sweetness and texture."
faqQ4: "How do I convert grams back to cups if my recipe uses metric measurements?"
faqA4: "To convert grams to cups, divide by 200 (the approximate weight of one cup of granulated sugar). So 450 grams would be 450 ÷ 200 = 2.25 cups. Remember this is approximate – for absolute precision, especially in air fryer baking, sticking to grams is recommended."

<p>2.25 cups of granulated sugar equals approximately 450 grams. This conversion is essential for baking, especially when using an air fryer, where precise measurements can impact texture and browning. Whether you're whipping up cakes, cookies, or desserts, knowing the exact gram equivalent ensures consistency in your recipes.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Sugar Measurements Matter</h2>
<p>Baking is a science, and even small deviations in sugar quantities can alter your results. Too much sugar can cause excessive browning in an air fryer, while too little may leave your baked goods dry. For air fryer recipes, where cooking times are shorter, precision is key to achieving the perfect bake. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more handy measurement guides.</p>
<p>Granulated sugar is a staple in many recipes, from classic sponges to crispy cookies. If you're adapting traditional oven recipes for an air fryer, converting cups to grams ensures you maintain the intended sweetness and texture.

<h2>How to Measure 2.25 Cups of Granulated Sugar</h2>
<p>For the most accurate conversion, use a kitchen scale. Scoop the sugar into your measuring cup without packing it down, then level it off with a straight edge. This method prevents over-measuring, which is common when scooping directly from the bag. If you don’t have a scale, remember that 1 cup of granulated sugar is roughly 200 grams, making 2.25 cups about 450 grams.</p>

<h3>UK vs. US Cup Measurements</h3>
<p>While the UK and US use the same cup size (240ml), slight differences in sugar density can affect the weight. For absolute precision, always weigh your ingredients. This is especially important for air fryer baking, where even small discrepancies can lead to uneven cooking.</p>

<h2>Common Recipes Using 2.25 Cups of Sugar</h2>
<p>Many classic desserts call for around 2.25 cups of granulated sugar. Think Victoria sponge, chocolate chip cookies, or even a simple syrup for glazing. When using an air fryer, these recipes may need slight adjustments in time or temperature. Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>cake recipes</a> to put your converted sugar measurements to good use.</p>
<p>If you're making a batch of cookies, 450 grams of sugar will yield a perfectly sweet dough. For air fryer cookies, reduce the baking time by 20-30% compared to conventional ovens. Always preheat your air fryer for even results, and consider using parchment <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>liners for easy cleanup</a>.</p>

<h3>Adjusting Sugar for Air Fryer Baking</h3>
<p>Air fryers circulate hot air rapidly, which can cause sugars to caramelise faster. If your recipe calls for 2.25 cups of granulated sugar, you might find slightly less (about 400 grams) works better to prevent over-browning. Experiment with small batches to find your ideal balance.</p>

<h2>Storing Granulated Sugar for Freshness</h2>
<p>Keep your sugar in an airtight container to prevent clumping, especially in humid kitchens. Proper storage ensures your 2.25 cups (450 grams) measure accurately every time. For more baking tips and air fryer hacks, bookmark <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>.</p>

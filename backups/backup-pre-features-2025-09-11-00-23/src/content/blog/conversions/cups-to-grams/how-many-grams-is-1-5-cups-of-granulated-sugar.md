faqQ1: "Does the type of sugar affect the gram measurement for 1.5 cups?"
faqA1: "Yes, different sugars have varying densities. Granulated sugar weighs 200 grams per cup, while brown sugar is slightly heavier at 220 grams per cup when packed. Powdered sugar is lighter, around 120 grams per cup. Always check specific conversions for the sugar type you're using."
faqQ2: "Can I use a kitchen scale instead of measuring cups for sugar?"
faqA2: "Absolutely! A kitchen scale is more accurate than measuring cups, especially for baking. Simply set your scale to grams and measure out 300 grams for 1.5 cups of granulated sugar. This method eliminates packing inconsistencies and ensures perfect results."
faqQ3: "Why does my air fryer recipe require grams instead of cups?"
faqA3: "Air fryers cook faster and more intensely than conventional ovens, so precise measurements prevent over- or under-cooking. Grams provide accuracy that volume measurements (like cups) can't match, especially for ingredients like sugar that can settle or pack unevenly."
faqQ4: "How do I convert grams back to cups if my recipe uses metric measurements?"
faqA4: "To convert grams to cups, divide the gram amount by 200 (for granulated sugar). For example, 300 grams ÷ 200 = 1.5 cups. Keep in mind this is specific to granulated sugar—other ingredients have different conversion rates. Always double-check with a reliable chart."

<h2>Why Accurate Sugar Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Using the correct amount of granulated sugar is crucial for achieving the right texture and sweetness in your baked goods. Too much sugar can lead to overly caramelised or burnt results, especially in an air fryer where heat distribution is intense. Too little, and your treats may turn out bland or dry. Converting cups to grams removes the guesswork, giving you reliable results every time.

<p>Granulated sugar is a staple in many recipes, from classic sponges to crispy cookies. When adapting traditional oven recipes for an air fryer, precise measurements become even more important due to the faster cooking times.

<h3>US vs UK Cup Measurements</h3>  
<p>It's worth noting that cup measurements can vary slightly between the US and UK. A standard US cup holds 240ml, while a UK cup is 250ml. However, for granulated sugar, the difference in weight is minimal—roughly 200 grams per cup in both systems. So, 1.5 cups will still be close to 300 grams regardless of where your measuring cup originates.

<h2>Converting Other Sugar Amounts</h2>  
<p>If your recipe calls for more or less than 1.5 cups of granulated sugar, here's a quick reference: 1 cup equals 200 grams, 2 cups equal 400 grams, and so on. This scaling makes it easy to adjust recipes without recalculating each time. Whether you're making a small batch of cookies or a large cake, these conversions ensure accuracy.

<p>Granulated sugar isn't the only sweetener used in baking, but it's one of the most common. Brown sugar, powdered sugar, and alternative sweeteners each have different weights per cup, so always check specific conversions. Keeping a conversion chart handy, like the one on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>our site</a>, can save time and prevent mistakes.</p>  

<h3>Tips for Measuring Sugar in an Air Fryer</h3>  
<p>When using an air fryer, evenly distributed sugar is key to avoiding hot spots. Spoon the sugar into your measuring cup rather than scooping it, as this prevents packing and ensures a consistent 200 grams per cup. Level off the top with a straight edge for precision.

faqQ1: "Does the weight of 1.5 cups of broccoli change if it's cooked?"
faqA1: "Yes, cooked broccoli weighs less due to water loss during cooking. Raw broccoli (135 grams per 1.5 cups) may reduce to about 100 grams after steaming or air frying. Always measure raw for recipes specifying uncooked quantities."
faqQ2: "Can I use frozen broccoli instead of fresh for this measurement?"
faqA2: "Frozen broccoli can be used, but thaw and drain it first to remove excess moisture. The weight may differ slightly, so adjust seasoning and cooking time if substituting in air fryer recipes."
faqQ3: "How do I convert grams to ounces for 1.5 cups of broccoli?"
faqA3: "135 grams of broccoli equals roughly 4.76 ounces. Use a kitchen scale for precise conversions, especially when following international recipes or dietary guidelines."
faqQ4: "Why is my air-fried broccoli soggy even with the right measurements?"
faqA4: "Sogginess often comes from overcrowding or insufficient oil. For crisp results, cook 1.5 cups (135g) in a single layer at 190°C, shaking the basket halfway. Patting dry frozen broccoli also helps."

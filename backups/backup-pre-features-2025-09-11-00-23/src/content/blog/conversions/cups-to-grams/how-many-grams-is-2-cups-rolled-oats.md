faqQ1: "Does the type of rolled oats affect the gram measurement for 2.0 cups?"
faqA1: "No, whether you use jumbo or regular rolled oats, 2.0 cups will still weigh around 160 grams. The difference lies in texture, not weight, so your air fryer recipes will turn out fine either way."
faqQ2: "Can I use quick oats instead of rolled oats in the same measurement?"
faqA2: "Quick oats are finer, so 2.0 cups may weigh slightly less (about 150 grams). Adjust recipes accordingly, as they absorb liquids faster and can alter cooking times in the air fryer."
faqQ3: "How do I store leftover rolled oats after measuring 2.0 cups?"
faqA3: "Keep them in an airtight container in a cool, dry place. Proper storage ensures they stay fresh for future air fryer recipes, whether for granola or coatings."
faqQ4: "Why does my air fryer recipe with 2.0 cups of rolled oats turn out dry?"
faqA4: "Dryness often comes from overcooking or insufficient liquid. Check your recipe’s ratios and reduce air fryer time by a minute or two if needed. Adding a touch more fat or syrup can also help."

faqQ1: "Does the type of lentil affect the gram measurement for 0.25 cups?"
faqA1: "No, the type of lentil doesn’t significantly change the weight. Whether red, green, or brown, 0.25 cups of lentils generally equals 50 grams. However, very small varieties like split lentils might pack slightly denser, but the difference is minimal for most recipes."
faqQ2: "Can I use this conversion for both dry and cooked lentils?"
faqA2: "This conversion applies only to dry lentils. Cooked lentils absorb water, increasing their volume and weight. For cooked lentils, you’ll need different measurements, as 0.25 cups of cooked lentils weighs more due to moisture content. Always check recipe specifics for cooked versus dry."
faqQ3: "Why is weighing lentils better than using cup measurements?"
faqA3: "Weighing lentils with a scale ensures accuracy, as cup measurements can vary based on how lentils are packed. A scale eliminates guesswork, especially important for baking or meal prepping. For air fryer recipes, precise grams from cups guarantee consistent results every time."
faqQ4: "How do I store leftover lentils after measuring 0.25 cups?"
faqA4: "Store dry lentils in an airtight container in a cool, dark place to maintain freshness. If you’ve cooked them, refrigerate in a sealed container for up to 5 days. Proper storage keeps lentils ready for your next air fryer adventure."

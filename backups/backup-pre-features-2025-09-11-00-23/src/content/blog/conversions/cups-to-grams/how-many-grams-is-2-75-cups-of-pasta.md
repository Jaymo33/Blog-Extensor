faqQ1: "Does the type of pasta affect how many grams are in 2.75 cups?"
faqA1: "Yes, different pasta shapes have varying densities, so 2.75 cups of penne will weigh slightly more than 2.75 cups of spaghetti. For precise measurements, always weigh your pasta in grams or refer to a conversion chart."
faqQ2: "Can I use this conversion for both dry and cooked pasta?"
faqA2: "No, this conversion applies to dry pasta only. Cooked pasta absorbs water and expands, so 2.75 cups of cooked pasta will weigh significantly more. Always measure dry pasta for accurate recipe results."
faqQ3: "How many servings does 2.75 cups (330 grams) of pasta make?"
faqA3: "2.75 cups of pasta (330 grams) typically serves four people, assuming a standard portion of 75–80 grams per person. Adjust quantities based on appetite or if serving as part of a larger meal."
faqQ4: "What’s the best way to measure pasta without a scale?"
faqA4: "Use a measuring cup, keeping in mind that 1 cup of dry pasta is roughly 120 grams. For 2.75 cups, you’d need about 330 grams. For greater accuracy, especially in baking, a kitchen scale is recommended."

<h2>How to Measure Pasta Without a Scale</h2>  
<p>If you don’t have a kitchen scale, you can still estimate 2.75 cups of pasta in grams using simple tricks.

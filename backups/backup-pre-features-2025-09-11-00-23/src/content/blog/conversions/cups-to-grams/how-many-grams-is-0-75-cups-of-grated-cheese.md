faqQ1: "Does the type of cheese affect the gram measurement for 0.75 cups?"
faqA1: "Yes, slightly. Harder cheeses like parmesan weigh more (about 90g for 0.75 cups), while softer cheeses like mozzarella weigh less (around 80g). For most recipes, 85 grams is a safe average."
faqQ2: "Can I use pre-shredded cheese instead of grating my own?"
faqA2: "Pre-shredded cheese works, but it often contains anti-caking agents that can affect melting. For best results in air fryer recipes, freshly grated cheese is recommended."
faqQ3: "How do I convert 0.75 cups of grated cheese to ounces?"
faqA3: "85 grams of grated cheese equals roughly 3 ounces. This conversion is handy for recipes using imperial measurements."
faqQ4: "Why does my air fryer recipe call for grams instead of cups?"
faqA4: "Grams provide precise measurements, ensuring consistent results in air fryers where cooking times are shorter. Cups can vary based on how tightly the cheese is packed."

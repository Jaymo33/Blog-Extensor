faqQ1: "How does 225 C in a fan oven compare to a conventional oven?"
faqA1: "At 225 C, a fan oven cooks food faster and more evenly than a conventional oven because the fan circulates hot air. No temperature conversion is needed - use 225 C directly in fan ovens, while conventional ovens may require slightly higher temperatures for similar results."
faqQ2: "Can I use 225 C in my air fryer the same way as a fan oven?"
faqA2: "Absolutely! Air fryers operate similarly to fan ovens at 225 C, just in a more compact space. You may need to reduce cooking times by 10-15% as the concentrated heat circulates even more efficiently in an air fryer's smaller chamber."
faqQ3: "What types of food cook best at 225 C in a fan oven?"
faqA3: "225 C is ideal for delicate baking (like meringues and souffl√©s), slow-roasting meats to tenderness, and perfectly roasting vegetables without burning. It's also great for dehydrating fruits or making crispy kale chips in your fan oven or air fryer."
faqQ4: "Why does my fan oven at 225 C cook faster than recipes suggest?"
faqA4: "Fan ovens at 225 C cook faster because the circulating air transfers heat more efficiently to food surfaces. Always check dishes 5-10 minutes before the recipe's suggested time, and use an oven thermometer to verify your oven's temperature accuracy."

<p>225 C in a fan oven is the same as 225 C - no conversion needed. Fan ovens circulate hot air, so they cook at the temperature you set without requiring adjustment. This makes them wonderfully straightforward compared to conventional ovens.</p>

<p>When using a fan oven, you'll notice food cooks faster and more evenly at 225 C than in a traditional oven. The circulating air eliminates hot spots, giving consistent results whether you're baking, roasting, or reheating. Many modern recipes, especially those from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, are written specifically for fan ovens.</p>

<h2>Why 225 C Works Differently in Fan Ovens</h2>
<p>The key difference with a fan oven is the forced air circulation. At 225 C, the moving air transfers heat more efficiently to your food's surface. This means you can often reduce cooking times by 10-20% compared to conventional ovens at the same temperature.</p>

<p>For air fryers, which are essentially small, powerful fan ovens, 225 C is a versatile temperature. It's ideal for delicate baked goods that might burn at higher heats, like the perfect <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/Cakes>air fryer cakes</a> from our collection. The consistent heat helps achieve golden results without drying out your creations.</p>

<h2>Converting 225 C for Different Appliances</h2>
<p>While 225 C needs no conversion for fan ovens, it's helpful to know equivalents for other cooking methods. In a conventional oven without a fan, you'd typically increase 225 C by 20 degrees to compensate for the less efficient heat distribution.</p>

<p>For air fryers, 225 C works beautifully as-is for most recipes. The compact size and rapid air circulation mean you get fan oven performance in a countertop appliance.

<h3>225 C in Baking</h3>
<p>At 225 C, fan ovens excel at gentle baking. This temperature is perfect for meringues, delicate pastries, and slow-roasted vegetables that need even heat without browning too quickly. The circulating air prevents the "hot spots" that can ruin baked goods in conventional ovens.</p>

<h3>225 C for Roasting</h3>
<p>While higher temperatures are common for roasting, 225 C in a fan oven works wonderfully for slow-roasting meats or <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/Vegetables>roasted vegetables</a>. The lower temperature allows connective tissues to break down gradually, resulting in tender, juicy results with perfect caramelisation.</p>

<h2>Air Fryer Tips at 225 C</h2>
<p>Your air fryer's 225 C setting is incredibly versatile. Use it for reheating leftovers without drying them out, toasting nuts evenly, or making perfect <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/Cookies>air fryer cookies</a>. The key is to check food a few minutes early, as air fryers often cook faster than traditional ovens.</p>

<p>Remember to keep your air fryer clean for best performance at 225 C. Built-up grease can affect airflow and temperature accuracy. Our guide to <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaning</a> makes maintenance simple.</p>

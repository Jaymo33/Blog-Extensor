faqQ1: "Can I use a US cup measurement for 385 ml of tomato sauce?"
faqA1: "Yes, but note that a US cup is 240 ml, while a UK metric cup is 250 ml. For 385 ml, the difference is minimal (about 1.6 US cups vs. 1.54 UK cups). For precision, stick to millilitres or use a kitchen scale."
faqQ2: "How does 385 ml of tomato sauce affect air fryer cooking times?"
faqA2: "Saucy dishes may need slightly longer in the air fryer due to moisture content. If using 385 ml of tomato sauce, preheat the air fryer and stir halfway for even cooking. Reduce heat if the sauce starts splattering."
faqQ3: "Can I substitute 385 ml of tomato sauce with passata?"
faqA3: "Yes, passata works as a substitute, but it’s thinner. Reduce other liquids in your recipe slightly to compensate. For thicker results, simmer the passata first or add a tablespoon of tomato paste."
faqQ4: "What’s the best way to store leftover tomato sauce after measuring 385 ml?"
faqA4: "Transfer unused sauce to an airtight container and refrigerate for up to 4 days. For longer storage, freeze in portions. Reheat gently in the air fryer or microwave before using. Always check for spoilage before reuse."

<h3>How to Measure 385 ml of Tomato Sauce Without a Measuring Cup</h3>

<h3>Adjusting Recipes for Different Serving Sizes</h3>  
<p>If your recipe serves more or fewer people, you may need to scale the tomato sauce accordingly. For instance, doubling a recipe would require 770 ml (about 3.25 cups) of sauce. Always adjust seasoning and cooking times to match. Air fryers cook quickly, so keep an eye on saucy dishes to prevent spills or burning.</p>

faqQ1: "Is 960 ml of condensed milk the same as 4 cups?"
faqA1: "Yes, 960 ml of condensed milk equals approximately 4 cups. This conversion is based on the standard metric-to-imperial measurement where 240 ml equals 1 cup. However, due to the thickness of condensed milk, it's best to measure it in a liquid measuring jug for accuracy."
faqQ2: "Can I use a scale to measure 960 ml of condensed milk?"
faqA2: "While scales are great for dry ingredients, condensed milk is best measured by volume due to its density. A liquid measuring jug with millilitre markings is the most accurate tool. If you must use a scale, note that 960 ml of condensed milk weighs roughly 1.2 kg, but this can vary slightly by brand."
faqQ3: "How do I convert 960 ml of condensed milk for smaller recipes?"
faqA3: "To halve 960 ml of condensed milk, use 480 ml (2 cups). For a quarter, use 240 ml (1 cup). This flexibility makes it easy to adjust recipes whether you're baking a large batch or just a few servings. Always measure carefully to maintain the recipe's balance."
faqQ4: "Does the type of condensed milk affect the 960 ml to cups conversion?"
faqA4: "The conversion remains the same regardless of whether you're using regular or reduced-fat condensed milk. However, the thickness may vary slightly between brands, so for precision, stick to measuring by volume rather than weight. This ensures consistent results in your recipes."

<p>960 ml of condensed milk is equivalent to approximately 4 cups. This conversion is essential for baking and air fryer recipes, ensuring accuracy for perfect results every time. Whether you're making fudge, cheesecake, or a creamy dessert in your air fryer, knowing this measurement helps streamline your cooking process.</p>  

<h2>Understanding Condensed Milk Measurements</h2>  
<p>Condensed milk is a staple in many dessert recipes, but measuring it correctly can be tricky. Unlike water, condensed milk is thick and sticky, making volume conversions less straightforward. For precise results, using a measuring jug with millilitre markings is ideal. If you're working with cups, remember that 240 ml equals 1 cup, so 960 ml neatly divides into 4 cups. This conversion is particularly useful for air fryer recipes, where exact measurements can affect texture and consistency.</p>  

<p>When adapting recipes from metric to imperial, or vice versa, having a reliable conversion chart is invaluable. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we provide handy tools to make these adjustments effortless. Whether you're scaling up a recipe or halving it, knowing how many cups 960 ml of condensed milk equals ensures your desserts turn out just right.</p>  

<h3>Why Accuracy Matters in Baking</h3>  
<p>Baking is a science, and condensed milk plays a crucial role in recipes like caramel slices or banoffee pie. Too much or too little can alter the sweetness, texture, and even cooking time. For air fryer users, precise measurements ensure even cooking and prevent overflow or undercooking. If you're experimenting with new recipes, always measure your condensed milk carefully to avoid disappointments.</p>  

<h2>Converting 960 ml of Condensed Milk for Different Recipes</h2>  
<p>Different desserts require varying amounts of condensed milk, and 960 ml is a common quantity in larger batches. For example, a classic fudge recipe might call for this amount to achieve the perfect creamy consistency. If you're making smaller portions, you can easily halve or quarter the measurement. Knowing that 960 ml equals 4 cups simplifies this process, especially when using measuring cups instead of scales.</p>  

<p>Air fryer desserts, like mini cheesecakes or caramel flan, often use condensed milk for richness. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, you'll find plenty of inspiration for sweet treats that utilise this ingredient. Whether you're a beginner or a seasoned baker, understanding conversions like 960 ml to cups ensures your creations are consistently delicious.</p>  

<h3>Tips for Measuring Condensed Milk</h3>  
<p>To measure 960 ml of condensed milk accurately, use a liquid measuring jug with clear millilitre markings. If using cups, lightly grease the cup first to help the sticky milk slide out easily. For sticky ingredients like this, a silicone spatula can help scrape every last bit into your mixing bowl. These small tricks make a big difference in achieving the right consistency for your desserts.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for 960 ml of Condensed Milk</h2>  
<p>960 ml of condensed milk is a versatile quantity, perfect for batch cooking or larger desserts.

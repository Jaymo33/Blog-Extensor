faqQ1: "Can I use a tablespoon to measure 35 ml of condensed milk?"
faqA1: "Yes, you can! Since 1 tablespoon is about 15 ml, 35 ml of condensed milk equals roughly 2 and 1/3 tablespoons. However, for the most accurate results, especially in baking, using a measuring cup or kitchen scale is recommended."
faqQ2: "Does the brand of condensed milk affect the measurement?"
faqA2: "Most condensed milk brands have a similar consistency, so 35 ml should be roughly the same across brands. However, if a brand is unusually thick or thin, weighing it (about 45 grams for 35 ml) might be more precise."
faqQ3: "Can I substitute evaporated milk for condensed milk in this measurement?"
faqA3: "No, evaporated milk is unsweetened and thinner than condensed milk. If a recipe calls for 35 ml of condensed milk, substituting evaporated milk will alter the sweetness and texture. Stick to condensed milk unless the recipe suggests otherwise."
faqQ4: "How do I clean my air fryer after using condensed milk?"
faqA4: "Condensed milk can stick and caramelise in your air fryer. For easy cleaning, wipe the basket with warm, soapy water immediately after use. For stubborn residue, check out <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>our air fryer cleaning guide</a> for tips."

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>When working with condensed milk, even small measurement discrepancies can affect the texture and taste of your dish.

That’s why converting 35 ml of condensed milk to cups correctly is so important.</p>  
<p>If you’re using an air fryer, consistency is key. Many recipes on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> rely on exact measurements to achieve the best outcomes.

<h2>How to Measure 35 ml of Condensed Milk</h2>

<p>If you’re working with an air fryer, consider using a syringe or small measuring jug for accuracy. Many air fryer recipes, like those in the <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert category</a>, call for small amounts of condensed milk, so precision is crucial.</p>

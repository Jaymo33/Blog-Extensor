faqQ1: "Is 435 ml of olive oil the same in US and UK cups?"
faqA1: "No, US and UK cups differ slightly. A US cup is 236.59 ml, while a UK cup is 284 ml. For 435 ml, that’s roughly 1.84 US cups or 1.53 UK cups. Always check which measurement system your recipe uses."
faqQ2: "Can I use a kitchen scale instead of measuring cups for olive oil?"
faqA2: "Absolutely! Olive oil weighs about 0.92 grams per ml, so 435 ml would be roughly 400 grams. A kitchen scale ensures precision, especially for baking or air frying where exact amounts matter."
faqQ3: "How does olive oil affect air fryer cooking compared to other oils?"
faqA3: "Olive oil has a high smoke point (around 190°C), making it great for air frying. It adds rich flavour without burning easily, unlike butter or coconut oil. Just avoid extra-virgin for high-heat cooking."
faqQ4: "What’s the best way to store leftover olive oil after measuring 435 ml?"
faqA4: "Keep it in a cool, dark place in an airtight container. Exposure to light and air can degrade quality. If you use olive oil often, consider smaller bottles to maintain freshness."

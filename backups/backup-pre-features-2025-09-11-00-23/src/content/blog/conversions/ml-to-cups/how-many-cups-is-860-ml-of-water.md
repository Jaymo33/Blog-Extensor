faqQ1: "Is 860 ml of water the same as 3.5 cups?"
faqA1: "No, 860 ml of water is slightly more than 3.5 cups. In the UK, it's approximately 3.63 cups, and in the US, it's about 3.64 cups. For air fryer recipes, this small difference can impact texture, so it's best to measure precisely."
faqQ2: "Can I use a regular mug to measure 860 ml of water?"
faqA2: "While you can use a mug, sizes vary widely. A standard UK mug holds around 300 ml, so 860 ml would be just under 3 mugs. For accuracy, we recommend using a measuring cup or kitchen scale for air fryer recipes."
faqQ3: "Why do UK and US cup measurements differ for 860 ml of water?"
faqA3: "The UK uses a 284 ml cup, while the US uses a 240 ml cup. This means 860 ml converts to slightly different values in each system. Always check which standard your air fryer recipe follows to avoid errors."
faqQ4: "How does 860 ml of water affect air fryer cooking times?"
faqA4: "Too much or too little water can alter cooking times. For example, 860 ml of water in a steam-based dish may require longer cooking than a drier recipe. Always follow your air fryer's guidelines and adjust as needed for best results."

<p>860 ml of water equals approximately 3.63 cups in the UK or 3.64 cups in the US. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise liquid measurements can make or break your dish. Whether you're preparing a cake, sauce, or marinade, knowing how to convert 860 ml of water to cups ensures consistency.

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>
<p>Air fryers rely on precise ingredient ratios to achieve the perfect texture and flavour. Using 860 ml of water instead of the correct cup measurement can lead to soggy or dry results. For example, if you're making a batter for air fryer tempura, too much water can make it runny, while too little can make it thick and clumpy. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> simplifies these calculations for you.</p>
<p>Many air fryer recipes, especially those for cakes or steamed dishes, require exact liquid measurements. A slight deviation can affect cooking times and outcomes. Whether you're using UK or US cup measurements, 860 ml of water translates to roughly 3.6 cups, but it's always best to double-check for precision.</p>

<h2>UK vs. US Cup Measurements for 860 ml of Water</h2>
<p>In the UK, 1 cup equals 284 ml, so 860 ml of water is about 3.63 cups. In the US, 1 cup is 240 ml, making 860 ml roughly 3.64 cups. While the difference seems minor, it can add up in larger batches. For air fryer recipes like soups or stews, this precision ensures your dish isn't too watery or thick.</p>
<p>If you're following a recipe from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>our collection</a>, always check whether it uses UK or US measurements. Most UK-based recipes will specify, but when in doubt, stick to the UK standard for consistency.

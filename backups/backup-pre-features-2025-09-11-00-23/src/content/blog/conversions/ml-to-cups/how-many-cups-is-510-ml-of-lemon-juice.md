faqQ1: "Is 510 ml of lemon juice the same as 2 cups?"
faqA1: "Not quite. 510 ml equals approximately 2.15 US cups or 2.25 UK cups due to slight differences in cup sizes. For precise baking or marinades, it’s best to measure using ml or a kitchen scale."
faqQ2: "Can I use bottled lemon juice instead of fresh for 510 ml?"
faqA2: "Yes, bottled lemon juice works if fresh isn’t available. Just ensure it’s pure juice without additives, and strain it if your recipe requires smooth consistency, like in air fryer glazes or desserts."
faqQ3: "How many lemons do I need for 510 ml of juice?"
faqA3: "It depends on the size and juiciness of the lemons. On average, 1 lemon yields about 50 ml, so you’d need roughly 10–12 lemons. Roll them before juicing to maximise yield."
faqQ4: "Does 510 ml of lemon juice weigh the same as water?"
faqA4: "Lemon juice is slightly denser than water due to its acidity and sugars. However, for most recipes, the difference is negligible. Always measure by volume (ml or cups) for accuracy in air fryer cooking."

<p>510 ml of lemon juice equals approximately 2.15 cups in standard US measurements. For UK cup measurements, it’s roughly 2.25 cups due to slight variations in cup sizes. Whether you're whipping up a zesty marinade or baking a tangy dessert, knowing this conversion ensures your air fryer recipes turn out perfectly every time.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Lemon Juice Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Precision is key when working with lemon juice, especially in air fryer recipes where balance is everything. Too much acidity can overpower a dish, while too little might leave it bland. For example, a <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>lemon drizzle cake</a> requires just the right amount of lemon juice to achieve that perfect tang. Using 510 ml (or 2.15 cups) ensures consistency, whether you're cooking for a crowd or meal prepping.</p>  

<p>Lemon juice also plays a crucial role in marinades, like those for <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>air fryer chicken</a>, where it tenderises the meat. A slight miscalculation could affect texture and flavour. That’s why keeping a <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a> handy is a game-changer for home cooks.</p>  

<h3>US vs. UK Cup Measurements</h3>  
<p>It’s worth noting that US and UK cup sizes differ slightly. In the US, 1 cup equals 240 ml, while in the UK, it’s 250 ml. So, 510 ml converts to 2.15 US cups or 2.25 UK cups. This small discrepancy might not matter for casual cooking, but for baking—like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>air fryer cakes</a>—it’s best to stick to one system.</p>  

<h2>How to Measure 510 ml of Lemon Juice Without a Scale</h2>  
<p>If you don’t have a measuring jug, you can use standard kitchen tools. A US cup holds 240 ml, so 510 ml is just over 2 cups (480 ml) plus 2 tablespoons (30 ml). For UK cooks, 2 cups (500 ml) plus a teaspoon (10 ml) will get you close. Freshly squeezed lemon juice works best, but bottled juice is fine if strained for pulp.</p>  

<p>For recipes like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>air fryer desserts</a>, accuracy ensures the right balance of sweetness and acidity. Always taste as you go—especially with citrus, as fruit acidity can vary. And don’t forget to <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>clean your air fryer</a> after cooking with sticky lemon-based sauces!</p>  

<h3>Common Recipes Using 510 ml of Lemon Juice</h3>  
<p>This quantity is ideal for batch cooking, such as lemon curd or salad dressings. It’s also perfect for marinating proteins like shrimp or tofu in your air fryer. The bright flavour cuts through richness, making it a staple in healthier cooking.</p>

<p>635 ml of beef stock equals approximately 2.68 cups. This conversion is essential for precise cooking, especially when using an air fryer where measurements can make or break a dish. Whether you're making a rich gravy, a hearty stew, or marinating meat, knowing the exact cup equivalent ensures consistency. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we focus on helping you nail every recipe with accurate conversions.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on even heat distribution, so ingredient proportions must be spot-on. Too much or too little liquid, like beef stock, can affect texture and cooking time. For example, a sauce might become too watery or overly thick if the measurement is off. Recipes on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>our recipes page</a> are tested with precise conversions to guarantee success. Whether you're cooking for one or meal prepping, accuracy ensures delicious results every time.</p>  

<p>Beef stock is a staple in many dishes, from braised meats to soups. Converting 635 ml to cups (2.68 cups) helps standardise recipes, especially if you're scaling up or down. If you're using a UK or US measuring cup, note that slight variations exist, but the difference is minimal for most recipes.

<h3>How to Measure 635 ml of Beef Stock Without a Measuring Cup</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a measuring cup, use a kitchen scale. One cup of beef stock weighs roughly 240 grams, so 635 ml would be close to 635 grams (since 1 ml ≈ 1 g for liquids). Alternatively, a standard mug holds about 250 ml, so 635 ml is just over 2.5 mugs. For air fryer recipes, consistency is key, so investing in proper tools like measuring cups or scales is worthwhile.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for 635 ml of Beef Stock in Air Fryer Recipes</h2>  
<p>This quantity is perfect for marinating larger cuts of meat or making sauces. For instance, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/beef>beef recipe category</a> includes dishes like air-fried beef stew or gravy-coated roast, where 635 ml of stock adds depth of flavour. You can also use it to deglaze the air fryer basket after cooking, creating a rich base for sauces.</p>  

<p>Another great use is for cooking grains like rice or quinoa directly in the air fryer. The stock infuses the grains with savoury notes, elevating simple sides. If you're meal prepping, 635 ml of beef stock can be portioned for multiple dishes, ensuring each has the right amount of liquid.

<h3>Tips for Storing Leftover Beef Stock</h3>  
<p>If you don’t use all 635 ml, store leftovers in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 4 days. You can also freeze it in ice cube trays for smaller portions. When reheating, use the air fryer’s warming function or a saucepan to maintain flavour.

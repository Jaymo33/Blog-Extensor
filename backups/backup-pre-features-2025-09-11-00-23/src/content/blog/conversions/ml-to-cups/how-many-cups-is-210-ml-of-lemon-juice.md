faqQ1: "Is 210 ml of lemon juice the same as 1 cup?"
faqA1: "No, 210 ml of lemon juice is slightly less than 1 cup. A standard US cup is 240 ml, so 210 ml equals about 0.89 cups. In the UK, a metric cup is 250 ml, making 210 ml roughly 0.84 cups."
faqQ2: "Can I use bottled lemon juice instead of fresh for 210 ml measurements?"

faqQ3: "How many lemons do I need for 210 ml of juice?"
faqA3: "On average, one medium lemon yields about 50 ml of juice, so you’d need roughly 4-5 lemons to get 210 ml. This can vary depending on the size and juiciness of the lemons."
faqQ4: "Does 210 ml of lemon juice weigh the same as water?"
faqA4: "Lemon juice is slightly denser than water, but the difference is minimal for most recipes. For practical purposes, 210 ml of lemon juice can be treated as equivalent in weight to 210 ml of water when measuring by volume."

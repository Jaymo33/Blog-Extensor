faqQ1: "Is 685 ml of lemon juice the same as 685 grams?"
faqA1: "No, 685 ml of lemon juice is not the same as 685 grams. While 1 ml of water weighs 1 gram, lemon juice is slightly denser due to its acidity and pulp content. For precise baking, use volume measurements (ml or cups) unless the recipe specifies weight."
faqQ2: "Can I use bottled lemon juice instead of fresh for 685 ml measurements?"
faqA2: "Yes, bottled lemon juice can substitute fresh for 685 ml measurements, but flavour may differ slightly. Fresh lemon juice has a brighter taste, while bottled often contains preservatives. For best results in air fryer recipes, fresh is preferred, but bottled works in a pinch."
faqQ3: "How many lemons do I need to make 685 ml of juice?"
faqA3: "You’ll need about 10-12 medium lemons to yield 685 ml of juice, depending on size and juiciness. Roll lemons firmly before juicing to maximise yield. For large-scale recipes, a citrus juicer saves time and effort."
faqQ4: "What’s the best way to convert 685 ml of lemon juice to tablespoons?"
faqA4: "685 ml of lemon juice equals roughly 46 UK tablespoons (15 ml each) or 39 US tablespoons (14.8 ml each). Use a standard measuring spoon for accuracy, especially in dressings or marinades where balance is key. Always level off the spoon for consistent results."

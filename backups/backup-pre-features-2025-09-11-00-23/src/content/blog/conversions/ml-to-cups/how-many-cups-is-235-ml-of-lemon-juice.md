faqQ1: "Is 235 ml of lemon juice the same as 1 cup?"
faqA1: "In US measurements, 235 ml of lemon juice is very close to 1 cup (240 ml), so you can safely use 1 cup. In UK measurements, 1 cup is 250 ml, so 235 ml is just under a full cup (0.98 cups). For most recipes, this small difference won’t affect the outcome."
faqQ2: "Can I use bottled lemon juice instead of fresh for 235 ml measurements?"
faqA2: "Yes, bottled lemon juice works fine for measuring 235 ml. However, fresh lemon juice often has a brighter flavour. If substituting, check for added preservatives in bottled juice, as these can slightly alter taste. For air fryer recipes, both options work well."
faqQ3: "How do I measure 235 ml of lemon juice without a measuring cup?"
faqA3: "If you don’t have a measuring cup, use a kitchen scale. Lemon juice weighs roughly 1 gram per ml, so 235 ml equals 235 grams. Alternatively, a standard mug holds about 250 ml, so fill it just below the rim for 235 ml."
faqQ4: "Why do UK and US cup measurements differ for 235 ml of lemon juice?"
faqA4: "The UK and US use different standards for cup sizes. A US cup is 240 ml, while a UK cup is 250 ml. This means 235 ml of lemon juice is closer to a full US cup but slightly less in a UK cup. Always check which measurement system your recipe uses."

<p>235 ml of lemon juice equals approximately 1 cup in US measurements and just under 1 cup (0.98 cups) in UK measurements. This conversion is essential for recipes requiring precise amounts of lemon juice, especially in baking or air fryer cooking where accuracy matters. Whether you're making a zesty marinade or a tangy dessert, knowing how to convert 235 ml of lemon juice to cups ensures your dish turns out perfectly every time.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Lemon Juice Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of lemon juice can make or break a recipe. Too little, and your dish might lack brightness; too much, and it could become overly acidic. For air fryer recipes, precise measurements ensure even cooking and balanced flavours. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we emphasise the importance of accurate conversions for consistent results. Whether you're following a UK or US recipe, understanding how 235 ml of lemon juice translates to cups helps avoid kitchen mishaps.</p>  

<p>Lemon juice is a common ingredient in marinades, dressings, and desserts. For example, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>lemon garlic chicken</a> recipe relies on the perfect balance of acidity. If you're working with 235 ml of lemon juice, knowing it's roughly 1 cup (US) or 0.98 cups (UK) ensures your marinade isn't too tart. This small difference might seem negligible, but in baking, even slight variations can affect texture and rise.</p>  

<h3>US vs. UK Cup Measurements</h3>  
<p>The difference between US and UK cup measurements stems from historical variations in standardisation. A US cup holds 240 ml, while a UK cup is slightly larger at 250 ml. This means 235 ml of lemon juice is almost a full US cup but just under a UK cup. For air fryer recipes, especially those from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert</a> categories, this distinction ensures your lemon curd or glaze has the right consistency.</p>  

<h2>Converting 235 ml of Lemon Juice for Baking</h2>  
<p>Baking is a science, and lemon juice plays a key role in recipes like lemon drizzle cake or air-fried lemon cookies. If a recipe calls for 235 ml of lemon juice, you'll need to measure it precisely. Using a liquid measuring cup is the easiest way, but if you only have metric tools, remember that 235 ml is just shy of a UK cup. For US recipes, you can safely round it to 1 cup without affecting the outcome.</p>  

<p>At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>airfryerrecipe.co.uk/conversions</a>, we provide handy charts for common ingredient conversions. Lemon juice, being acidic, can also interact with other ingredients like baking soda. If your recipe requires 235 ml of lemon juice, ensure you account for its acidity to avoid over-rising or a bitter taste. This is especially important in air fryer baking, where heat distribution is rapid and even.</p>  

<h3>Tips for Measuring Lemon Juice</h3>  
<p>Freshly squeezed lemon juice is ideal, but bottled works too. To measure 235 ml accurately, use a jug with clear ml markings. If you're converting 235 ml of lemon juice to cups, fill the cup to just below the rim for UK measurements or right to the top for US cups. For sticky lemon juice, lightly grease the measuring cup to ensure all the liquid pours out. This trick is handy for <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>lemon cake recipes</a> where every drop counts.</p>

<p>For savoury dishes, 235 ml of lemon juice can brighten up roasted vegetables or seafood. In desserts, it balances sweetness in tarts or sorbets.

faqQ1: "Can I use 535 ml of chicken broth interchangeably with 2.26 cups in any recipe?"
faqA1: "Yes, 535 ml of chicken broth is equivalent to approximately 2.26 cups, so you can use them interchangeably in most recipes. However, for baking or dishes requiring extreme precision, sticking to one measurement system (metric or imperial) is best to avoid slight discrepancies."
faqQ2: "How do I measure 535 ml of chicken broth if I don’t have a measuring jug?"
faqA2: "You can use a standard mug (about 250 ml) and fill it just over twice to get close to 535 ml. Alternatively, weigh it on kitchen scales—535 grams of chicken broth will be roughly equivalent to 535 ml. For more accuracy, invest in a measuring jug or check online conversion tools."
faqQ3: "Does the type of chicken broth (low-sodium, homemade, etc.) affect the 535 ml to cups conversion?"
faqA3: "No, the type of chicken broth doesn’t change the volume conversion. Whether it’s low-sodium, homemade, or store-bought, 535 ml will always equal approximately 2.26 cups. The difference lies in flavour and salt content, not measurement."
faqQ4: "Can I freeze leftover chicken broth after measuring out 535 ml?"
faqA4: "Absolutely! Pour the leftover broth into an airtight container or ice cube trays and freeze for up to 3 months. This way, you’ll have pre-portioned broth ready for future recipes. Just thaw and reheat when needed."

<p>535 ml of chicken broth equals approximately 2.26 cups. This conversion is essential for precise cooking, especially when using an air fryer for recipes requiring exact liquid measurements. Whether you're making soups, sauces, or marinades, knowing how to convert millilitres to cups ensures consistent results every time.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Using the correct amount of chicken broth can make or break a dish. Too much liquid can lead to soggy results, while too little might dry out your food. For air fryer recipes, where evaporation happens quickly, getting the measurement right is even more critical. A conversion chart like the one on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> can be a lifesaver.</p>  

<p>Many air fryer recipes, especially those for soups or stews, call for chicken broth. If you're working with 535 ml, knowing it's roughly 2.26 cups helps you adjust quantities without guesswork. This precision ensures your meals turn out perfectly every time, whether you're cooking for one or meal prepping for the week.</p>  

<h2>How to Measure 535 ml of Chicken Broth Without a Measuring Cup</h2>  
<p>Don't have a measuring cup handy? No problem. You can use a standard mug or glass to estimate 535 ml of chicken broth. A typical UK mug holds about 250 ml, so just over two mugs will give you close to 535 ml. For more accuracy, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipes section</a> for tips on measuring liquids without proper tools.</p>  

<h3>Using Kitchen Scales for Liquid Measurements</h3>  
<p>If you have kitchen scales, you can weigh 535 ml of chicken broth instead. Since 1 ml of water weighs roughly 1 gram, chicken broth (which has a similar density) will be close enough for most recipes. Place your container on the scale, tare it, and pour until you hit 535 grams. This method is especially handy for air fryer cooking, where precision matters.</p>  

<h2>Common Recipes Using 535 ml of Chicken Broth</h2>  
<p>Many delicious dishes call for around 535 ml of chicken broth. From creamy risottos to hearty stews, this measurement pops up frequently. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipe category</a> for inspiration. Whether you're cooking a classic chicken casserole or experimenting with air-fried dumplings, knowing your conversions ensures success.</p>  

<p>For example, a simple air fryer chicken soup might require 535 ml of broth to balance the other ingredients. By converting 535 ml to cups (2.26), you can easily scale the recipe up or down. This flexibility is why understanding liquid measurements is so valuable in the kitchen.</p>  

<h3>Adjusting Recipes for Different Serving Sizes</h3>  
<p>If a recipe calls for 535 ml of chicken broth but you're cooking for fewer people, you might need to halve the quantity. Knowing that 535 ml equals 2.26 cups makes it easy to calculate 1.13 cups for half the recipe. This level of precision ensures your dishes taste just as good, no matter the portion size.</p>  

<h2>Tips for Storing Leftover Chicken Broth</h2>  
<p>If you've opened a carton of chicken broth but only need 535 ml, you'll want to store the rest properly. Pour the remaining broth into an airtight container and refrigerate for up to 4 days. Alternatively, freeze it in ice cube trays for easy portioning later. For more storage hacks, visit <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>.</p>

<h3>Cleaning Your Air Fryer After Using Chicken Broth</h3>  
<p>Chicken broth can leave residues in your air fryer, so cleaning is essential.

<h2>Understanding the Conversion: 710 ml to Cups</h2>  
<p>When converting 710 ml of orange juice to cups, it's important to know that 1 cup is roughly 237 ml. This means 710 ml divided by 237 ml per cup gives you just under 3 cups (about 2.99 cups). For most recipes, rounding to 3 cups works perfectly. If you're using an air fryer for recipes like glazed chicken or citrus desserts, precise measurements matter—so keep this conversion handy.</p>  

<p>Different countries use varying cup sizes, but the standard metric cup (used in the UK and most baking recipes) is 250 ml. In this case, 710 ml would be closer to 2.84 cups. For simplicity, many home cooks stick with the 3-cup approximation. If you're following a recipe from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, always check whether it uses metric or imperial measurements.</p>

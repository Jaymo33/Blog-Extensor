faqQ1: "Is 85 ml of heavy cream the same as 85 grams?"
faqA1: "No, 85 ml of heavy cream is not the same as 85 grams. The weight of heavy cream varies slightly depending on its fat content, but generally, 85 ml of heavy cream weighs around 82-85 grams. For precise baking, it's best to measure by volume (ml) if the recipe specifies it."
faqQ2: "Can I use milk instead of heavy cream if I don’t have 85 ml?"
faqA2: "Milk can be used as a substitute, but it won’t provide the same richness. To mimic heavy cream, mix 60 ml of milk with 25 ml of melted butter for a similar consistency. However, for air fryer recipes that rely on heavy cream’s thickness, substitutions may alter the texture."
faqQ3: "How do I measure 85 ml of heavy cream without a measuring cup?"
faqA3: "If you don’t have a measuring cup, use a tablespoon—85 ml is roughly 5.5 tablespoons. Alternatively, a kitchen scale can help if you know the weight (approximately 82-85 grams). For best results in air fryer cooking, investing in a measuring jug is ideal."
faqQ4: "Does 85 ml of heavy cream whip to the same volume as double cream?"
faqA4: "Heavy cream and UK double cream have similar fat content, so 85 ml of either will whip to a comparable volume. However, double cream may yield a slightly thicker result. For air fryer desserts, both work well, but heavy cream is more common in US recipes."

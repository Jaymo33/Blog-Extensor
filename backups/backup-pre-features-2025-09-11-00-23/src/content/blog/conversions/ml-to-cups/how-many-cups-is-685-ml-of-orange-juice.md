faqQ1: "Is 685 ml of orange juice the same as 3 cups?"
faqA1: "No, 685 ml of orange juice is approximately 2.9 cups, just slightly under 3 cups. While the difference is small, it’s worth noting for recipes where precision matters, especially in baking or air fryer cooking."
faqQ2: "Can I use a standard drinking glass to measure 685 ml of orange juice?"
faqA2: "It’s not recommended, as drinking glasses vary in size. For accuracy, use a liquid measuring cup marked with millilitres or cups. If you don’t have one, a UK juice carton (often 685 ml) can serve as a rough guide."
faqQ3: "How does 685 ml of orange juice affect air fryer recipes?"
faqA3: "In air fryer cooking, excess liquid can reduce crispiness. If a recipe calls for 685 ml of orange juice, consider reducing it slightly or using it as a marinade rather than a glaze to avoid soggy results."
faqQ4: "What’s the best way to convert 685 ml of orange juice to US cups?"
faqA4: "Since a US cup is 240 ml, 685 ml converts to roughly 2.85 US cups. This minor difference rarely impacts recipes, but for precision, use a measuring cup or scale. Check our conversion chart for more details."

<p>685 ml of orange juice equals approximately 2.9 cups (just under 3 cups). This conversion is essential for baking, cooking, or preparing drinks where precise measurements matter. Whether you're using an air fryer or a conventional oven, knowing how to convert millilitres to cups ensures your recipes turn out perfectly every time.</p>

<h2>Understanding the Conversion: 685 ml to Cups</h2>
<p>Converting 685 ml of orange juice to cups is straightforward once you know the basic conversion rate. One standard metric cup holds 250 ml, so dividing 685 by 250 gives you roughly 2.74 cups. However, in practical terms, this is often rounded to 2.9 cups for easier measurement. This slight adjustment won’t affect most recipes, especially when using an air fryer, where small variations are less critical.</p>
<p>If you're working with US cups, which are slightly smaller at 240 ml, the conversion comes out to about 2.85 cups. For most home cooks, the difference between metric and US cups is negligible, but it’s worth noting if precision is key. You can find more detailed conversions on our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Cooking</h2>
<p>Using the correct amount of orange juice can make or break a recipe. Too much liquid can lead to soggy results, while too little might leave your dish dry. This is especially important in air fryer cooking, where excess moisture can affect crispiness. For example, when making orange-glazed chicken or citrus-infused cakes, precise measurements ensure the perfect balance of flavours and textures.</p>
<p>If you're experimenting with recipes, it’s helpful to note that 685 ml of orange juice is just under 3 cups. This knowledge lets you adjust other ingredients accordingly.

<h3>Tips for Measuring Orange Juice</h3>
<p>When measuring 685 ml of orange juice, use a clear liquid measuring cup for accuracy. Pour the juice to the desired mark at eye level to avoid over- or under-pouring. If you don’t have a measuring cup, remember that 685 ml is roughly equivalent to a standard UK juice carton size, making it easy to eyeball for most recipes.</p>

<h2>Common Uses for 685 ml of Orange Juice</h2>
<p>685 ml of orange juice is a versatile quantity for many recipes. It’s perfect for marinades, glazes, or even baking. For instance, you could use it to make a tangy orange glaze for air-fried salmon or a refreshing citrus drizzle cake. The acidity in orange juice also helps tenderise meats, making it a great addition to <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipes</a>.</p>
<p>If you’re preparing drinks, 685 ml of orange juice makes about 2-3 large glasses of fresh juice or can be mixed into cocktails. For those who love baking, this amount is ideal for cakes, muffins, or even homemade orange jelly. The possibilities are endless, and with an air fryer, you can experiment with quick, easy recipes that highlight citrus flavours.</p>

<h3>Converting Other Liquid Measurements</h3>
<p>If you frequently work with millilitres and cups, it’s helpful to memorise a few key conversions. For example, 500 ml is 2 cups, and 1 litre is 4 cups. This makes it easier to scale recipes up or down as needed.

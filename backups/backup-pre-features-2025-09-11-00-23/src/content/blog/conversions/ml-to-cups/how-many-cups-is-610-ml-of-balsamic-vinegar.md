<h3>How to Measure 610 ml of Balsamic Vinegar Without a Scale</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a measuring jug, use a standard cup. Since 1 cup equals 236.59 ml, 610 ml is just over 2.5 cups. For precision, fill two cups completely, then add another half cup plus a tablespoon. This method works well for marinades or sauces in your air fryer.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for 610 ml of Balsamic Vinegar in Air Fryer Recipes</h2>  
<p>Balsamic vinegar is versatile—great for glazes, dressings, or even deglazing. In an air fryer, it helps create sticky, caramelised coatings on meats and veggies.

<p>You might also use 610 ml (2.58 cups) for batch cooking. For example, a large batch of balsamic mushrooms or a marinade for meal prep. Just remember, air fryers circulate hot air, so thicker sauces reduce faster. Adjust cooking times accordingly.</p>  

<h3>Does Balsamic Vinegar Behave Differently in an Air Fryer?</h3>  
<p>Yes! Because air fryers cook with intense heat, balsamic vinegar reduces quicker than on a stovetop. A 610 ml batch might thicken faster, so keep an eye on it. To avoid burning, dilute with a splash of water or oil if needed.</p>

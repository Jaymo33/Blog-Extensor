Whether you're whipping up a cake or preparing a creamy sauce in your air fryer, knowing this conversion ensures your recipes turn out perfectly. Oat milk has become a staple in many kitchens, especially for those who prefer plant-based alternatives. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we understand the importance of accurate measurements for flawless results.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of oat milk can make or break your dish. Too much liquid can lead to soggy textures, while too little might dry out your food. This is especially crucial when using an air fryer, where precise ratios affect cooking times and crispiness. For example, a batter that’s too thin won’t coat chicken properly, while a thick one might not crisp up as desired.

<p>Many recipes, especially those from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>our collection</a>, rely on exact measurements for consistency. Whether you're making pancakes or a creamy pasta sauce, 385 ml of oat milk should be measured correctly to avoid kitchen mishaps. A slight variation might not seem like much, but it can alter the final outcome significantly.</p>  

<h3>US vs. UK Cup Measurements</h3>

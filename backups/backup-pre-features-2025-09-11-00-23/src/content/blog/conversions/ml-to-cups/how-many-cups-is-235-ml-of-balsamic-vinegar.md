faqA1: "In US measurements, 235 ml of balsamic vinegar is just under 1 cup (240 ml). In UK measurements, it’s approximately 0.98 cups (250 ml per cup). For air fryer recipes, this small difference usually won’t affect the outcome, but for precise reductions or baking, it’s best to measure by weight or millilitres."

faqA3: "235 ml of balsamic vinegar equals about 15.8 tablespoons. This conversion is useful for smaller batches or adjusting flavours in air fryer recipes. Remember, 1 tablespoon is approximately 15 ml, so 235 ml ÷ 15 gives you the tablespoon count."
faqQ4: "Does the type of balsamic vinegar affect the 235 ml to cups conversion?"
faqA4: "No, the conversion remains the same whether you’re using traditional or commercial balsamic vinegar. However, thicker varieties may coat measuring tools differently, so lightly greasing the cup or spoon can help ensure an accurate 235 ml measurement for air fryer recipes."

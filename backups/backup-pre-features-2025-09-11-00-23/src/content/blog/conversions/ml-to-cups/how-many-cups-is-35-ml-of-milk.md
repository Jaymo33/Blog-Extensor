faqQ1: "Is 35 ml of milk the same in UK and US cups?"
faqA1: "While the cup sizes differ between the UK (284 ml) and US (240 ml), 35 ml of milk converts to approximately 0.148 cups in both systems. The slight difference in cup volume doesn't significantly affect this small measurement, making it interchangeable for most recipes."
faqQ2: "Can I use tablespoons to measure 35 ml of milk?"
faqA2: "Yes, you can use tablespoons to measure 35 ml of milk. Since 1 tablespoon equals about 15 ml, 35 ml would be roughly 2 tablespoons plus 1 teaspoon. This method works well for small quantities but may be less precise than using a measuring jug for critical baking recipes."
faqQ3: "How does 35 ml of milk affect air fryer recipes?"
faqA3: "In air fryer cooking, 35 ml of milk is often used in batters, glazes, or sauces to add moisture without making food soggy. This small amount helps create a crisp exterior while keeping the interior tender, especially in recipes like air-fried chicken or tempura vegetables."
faqQ4: "What's the best way to measure 35 ml of milk without a measuring cup?"
faqA4: "If you don't have a measuring cup, you can use a standard shot glass (usually 25-30 ml) and slightly overfill it, or use 2 tablespoons plus 1 teaspoon. Alternatively, many medicine cups have ml markings and can provide a reasonably accurate measurement for small quantities like 35 ml of milk."

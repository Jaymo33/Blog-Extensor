faqQ1: "Is 760 ml of heavy cream the same as 3 cups?"
faqA1: "No, 760 ml of heavy cream is approximately 3.2 cups. While 3 cups would be 750 ml, the extra 10 ml makes a slight difference in recipes requiring precision, especially in baking or air fryer dishes."
faqQ2: "Can I use whipped cream instead of heavy cream in recipes?"
faqA2: "Whipped cream isn’t a direct substitute for heavy cream, as it contains added sugar and air. For cooking or baking, stick to heavy cream or double cream for the best results."
faqQ3: "How do I measure 760 ml of heavy cream without a measuring cup?"
faqA3: "If you don’t have a measuring cup, use a kitchen scale. Heavy cream weighs roughly 1.03 grams per ml, so 760 ml equals about 780 grams. Alternatively, use a tablespoon (15 ml) to measure out 50 tablespoons and 2 teaspoons."
faqQ4: "Does heavy cream measurement differ between the UK and US?"
faqA4: "The volume measurement (ml to cups) is the same, but the fat content varies slightly. UK double cream has around 48% fat, while US heavy cream has 36-40%. This may affect richness but not the conversion."

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of heavy cream can make or break a recipe. Too little, and your dish might lack richness; too much, and it could become overly dense.

<p>Heavy cream, also known as double cream in the UK, has a high fat content, which affects its volume. Unlike milk or water, its density means conversions aren’t always straightforward. That’s why knowing 760 ml equals roughly 3.2 cups is so useful for home cooks and bakers alike.</p>  

<h2>How to Measure 760 ml of Heavy Cream</h2>  
<p>For the most accurate results, use a liquid measuring cup with clear markings. Fill it to the 760 ml line, or measure out 3.2 cups if your recipe calls for it. If you don’t have a measuring cup, a kitchen scale can help—760 ml of heavy cream weighs about 780 grams.</p>

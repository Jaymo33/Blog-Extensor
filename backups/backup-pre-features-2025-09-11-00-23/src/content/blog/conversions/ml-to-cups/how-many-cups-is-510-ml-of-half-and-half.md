<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>When using an air fryer, precise measurements are crucial for achieving the perfect texture and flavour. Too much or too little liquid, like half and half, can affect cooking times and results. For example, adding too much half and half to a batter might make it too runny, leading to uneven cooking. On the other hand, too little could dry out your dish. That's why converting 510 ml of half and half to cups correctly is so important.</p>  

<p>Many air fryer recipes, especially those for desserts or creamy sauces, rely on half and half for richness. If you're making a dish like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>air fryer desserts</a>, knowing the exact cup measurement ensures your recipe turns out just right. A slight miscalculation could mean the difference between a velvety custard and a lumpy mess.</p>  

<h3>US vs. UK Cup Measurements</h3>  
<p>It's worth noting that US and UK cup measurements differ slightly. In the US, 1 cup is 240 ml, while in the UK, it's 250 ml. This means 510 ml of half and half is roughly 2.15 US cups or 2.25 UK cups. If you're following a recipe from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, it likely uses UK measurements, but always double-check to avoid mistakes.</p>  

<h2>How to Measure Half and Half Without a Measuring Cup</h2>  
<p>Don't have a measuring cup handy? No problem. You can use a standard mug or glass to estimate 510 ml of half and half. A typical UK mug holds about 250 ml, so two mugs would give you roughly 500 ml—close enough for most recipes. Alternatively, use a kitchen scale: 510 ml of half and half weighs approximately 520 grams, making it easy to measure by weight.</p>  

<p>For those who love baking in their air fryer, precision is key. If you're making a recipe like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>air fryer cakes</a>, even a small measurement error can affect the rise and texture. That's why we recommend using proper measuring tools or our conversion guide to get it spot on.</p>

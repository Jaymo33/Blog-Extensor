faqQ1: "Is 660 ml of coconut milk the same as 2.79 cups in the UK?"
faqA1: "In the UK, a metric cup is 250 ml, so 660 ml equals roughly 2.64 cups. The slight difference from the US measurement (2.79 cups) is due to varying cup sizes. Always check your recipe’s origin for accuracy."
faqQ2: "Can I use light coconut milk instead of full-fat for 660 ml measurements?"
faqA2: "Yes, but adjust for consistency. Light coconut milk has more water, so you might need less liquid overall. For richer dishes, stick to full-fat and measure precisely for best results."
faqQ3: "How do I store leftover coconut milk after measuring 660 ml?"
faqA3: "Transfer unused coconut milk to an airtight container and refrigerate for up to 4 days. Shake well before reusing, as separation is normal. Freeze for longer storage in ice cube trays."
faqQ4: "Why does my air fryer recipe taste different with 660 ml of coconut milk?"
faqA4: "Brands vary in thickness and sweetness. If your dish is too watery, simmer the coconut milk first or reduce the quantity slightly. For stronger flavour, opt for organic or premium brands."

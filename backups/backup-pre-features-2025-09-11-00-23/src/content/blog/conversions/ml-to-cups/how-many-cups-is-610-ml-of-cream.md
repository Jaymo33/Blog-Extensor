faqQ1: "Is 610 ml of cream the same in UK and US cups?"
faqA1: "No, there’s a slight difference. In the UK, 610 ml equals about 2.57 cups (250 ml per cup), while in the US, it’s roughly 2.58 cups (240 ml per cup). For most recipes, this small variance won’t matter, but it’s good to know for precision baking."
faqQ2: "Can I use whipped cream instead of liquid cream for 610 ml?"
faqA2: "Whipped cream has more volume, so 610 ml of liquid cream will yield more when whipped. If your recipe calls for liquid cream, stick to that for accurate results. For air fryer recipes, lightly whipped cream works best as a topping."
faqQ3: "How do I measure 610 ml of cream without a measuring cup?"
faqA3: "If you don’t have a measuring cup, use a kitchen scale. Cream weighs roughly 1 gram per ml, so 610 ml equals about 610 grams. Alternatively, use a standard mug (about 300 ml) and adjust accordingly—just under 2 full mugs for 610 ml."
faqQ4: "What’s the best way to clean cream residue from my air fryer?"
faqA4: "Cream can leave sticky residues. After cooking, wipe your air fryer basket with warm, soapy water or use a dedicated <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner</a>. Avoid harsh scrubbing to prevent damage to non-stick coatings."

<h3>Tips for Measuring Cream</h3>

<h2>Common Uses for 610 ml of Cream</h2>

<h3>Storing Leftover Cream</h3>  
<p>If you don’t use all 610 ml of cream at once, store it in an airtight container in the fridge. Cream typically lasts 3–5 days, but check for souring before reuse. For air fryer recipes, fresh cream works best, so plan your measurements accordingly.</p>

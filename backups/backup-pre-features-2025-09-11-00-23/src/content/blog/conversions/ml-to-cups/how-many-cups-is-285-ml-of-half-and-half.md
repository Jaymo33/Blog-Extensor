faqQ1: "Is 285 ml of half and half the same as 1.2 cups?"
faqA1: "Yes, 285 ml of half and half is approximately 1.2 cups. This conversion is based on the standard US cup measurement, which is 240 ml per cup. If you're using a UK cup, which is 284 ml, the conversion would be slightly different, but 1.2 cups is a close enough approximation for most recipes."
faqQ2: "Can I use milk instead of half and half in a recipe that calls for 285 ml?"

faqQ3: "How do I measure 285 ml of half and half without a measuring cup?"

faqQ1: "Is 685 ml of honey the same in US and UK cups?"
faqA1: "No, 685 ml of honey converts to about 2.89 US cups (240 ml per cup) and roughly 2.42 UK cups (284 ml per cup). The difference arises from the varying cup sizes between measurement systems. Always check which standard your recipe follows."
faqQ2: "Can I use a kitchen scale instead of measuring cups for honey?"
faqA2: "Yes, weighing honey is often more accurate. Honey weighs approximately 340 grams per US cup (240 ml), so 685 ml would be around 980 grams. A kitchen scale eliminates guesswork and ensures precision, especially for air fryer recipes where balance is key."
faqQ3: "How do I prevent honey from sticking to the measuring cup?"
faqA3: "Lightly coat the measuring cup with oil or non-stick spray before adding honey. This helps it slide out cleanly. A silicone spatula can also help scrape out every bit, ensuring you get the full 685 ml measurement for your recipe."
faqQ4: "What air fryer recipes work well with 685 ml of honey?"
faqA4: "685 ml of honey is ideal for glazes, marinades, or large-batch baking. Try honey-glazed salmon, BBQ chicken wings, or honey cake in your air fryer. For more ideas, browse our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a> tailored for air fryer cooking."

<p>685 ml of honey is approximately 2.89 cups in the US measurement system and roughly 2.42 cups in the UK measurement system. This conversion is essential for baking, cooking, or even making sauces in your air fryer. Whether you're following a recipe from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> or adjusting measurements, knowing how to convert ml to cups ensures accuracy.</p>

<h2>Understanding Honey Measurements</h2>  
<p>Honey is thicker and denser than water, which means its volume-to-weight ratio differs. When converting 685 ml of honey to cups, it's important to account for this density. US cups (240 ml per cup) and UK cups (284 ml per cup) also vary, so always check which system your recipe uses. For air fryer recipes, precise measurements can make or break your dish, especially when dealing with sticky ingredients like honey.</p>  
<p>If you're using an air fryer for baking, such as making honey-glazed desserts, getting the right amount of honey ensures the perfect texture and sweetness. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more helpful measurement guides. This is particularly useful if you're adapting traditional oven recipes for your air fryer.</p>  

<h3>Why Accurate Honey Measurements Matter</h3>  
<p>Too much or too little honey can alter the taste, texture, and cooking time of your dish. In air fryer cooking, where heat distribution is rapid, precise measurements prevent over-sweetening or uneven cooking. For example, a honey-glazed chicken recipe from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>our chicken category</a> relies on the perfect balance of honey for caramelisation.</p>  

<h2>Converting 685 ml of Honey to Cups</h2>  
<p>To convert 685 ml of honey to US cups, divide by 237 (since 1 US cup â‰ˆ 237 ml for honey due to density). This gives roughly 2.89 cups. For UK cups, divide by 284, resulting in about 2.42 cups. Always use a measuring jug for liquids or a kitchen scale for absolute precision, especially when working with air fryer recipes.</p>  
<p>If you're preparing a dessert like honey cake in your air fryer, this conversion ensures the batter isn't too runny or thick.

Accurate measurements guarantee consistent results every time.</p>  

<h3>Tips for Measuring Honey</h3>  
<p>Lightly greasing your measuring cup or spoon with oil helps honey slide out easily, ensuring you get the full amount. For sticky ingredients like honey, a silicone spatula can help scrape every last bit. This is especially handy when preparing marinades or glazes for air fryer dishes.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for 685 ml of Honey</h2>  
<p>685 ml of honey is often used in large-batch recipes, such as BBQ sauces, granola, or baked goods. In air fryer cooking, it's perfect for glazing meats like salmon or turkey. Visit our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipes section</a> for inspiration on how to use this quantity effectively.</p>  
<p>Honey also works well in air fryer desserts, such as drizzling over roasted fruits or mixing into batters. Its natural sweetness enhances flavours without overpowering, making it a versatile ingredient for both savoury and sweet dishes.</p>  

<h3>Storing Leftover Honey</h3>  
<p>If you have leftover honey after measuring 685 ml, store it in an airtight container at room temperature. Honey has a long shelf life, but keeping it sealed prevents crystallisation.

faqQ1: "Is 485 ml of water the same as 2 cups?"
faqA1: "No, 485 ml of water equals roughly 2.05 US cups or 1.7 UK cups. The difference might seem small, but in baking or air fryer cooking, precise measurements matter. Always check whether your recipe uses US or UK cup measurements to avoid errors."
faqQ2: "Can I use a regular drinking cup to measure 485 ml of water?"
faqA2: "Drinking cups vary in size, so they’re not reliable for accurate measurements. A standard US measuring cup holds 240 ml, and a UK one holds 284 ml. For 485 ml of water, use proper measuring tools or a kitchen scale for best results, especially in air fryer recipes."
faqQ3: "Why does my air fryer recipe turn out soggy when using 485 ml of water?"
faqA3: "Air fryers need minimal moisture to crisp food. If your dish is soggy, you might be using too much water. Try reducing the liquid slightly or patting ingredients dry before cooking. Also, ensure you’ve converted 485 ml to cups correctly for your region."
faqQ4: "How do I convert 485 ml of water to cups for a UK recipe?"
faqA4: "For UK recipes, 485 ml of water is about 1.7 cups (since 1 UK cup = 284 ml). If the recipe calls for exact measurements, use a jug marked in millilitres or a digital scale. For air fryer cooking, precision helps avoid under- or overcooking."

<p>485 ml of water is approximately 2.05 US cups or 1.7 UK cups. Getting this conversion right is essential for cooking, baking, and especially when using an air fryer, where precise measurements can make or break a recipe. Whether you're preparing a sauce, batter, or simply hydrating ingredients, knowing how to convert millilitres to cups ensures consistency in your dishes.</p>  

<h2>Understanding Cup Measurements for 485 ml of Water</h2>  
<p>Cup measurements vary between the UK and the US, which can be confusing if you're following international recipes. In the US, a standard cup holds 240 ml, while a UK cup is slightly larger at 284 ml. This means 485 ml of water converts to roughly 2.05 US cups or 1.7 UK cups. For air fryer recipes, accuracy matters—whether you're making crispy chicken or a moist cake, the right liquid ratio ensures perfect results.</p>  

<p>If you're using an air fryer, you might need to adjust measurements slightly due to its rapid cooking style. For example, when making a batter for <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer onion rings</a>, 485 ml of water could affect crispiness if not measured correctly. Always double-check conversions to avoid soggy or dry outcomes. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> can help simplify these calculations.</p>  

<h3>Why Accurate Water Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h3>  
<p>Air fryers circulate hot air to cook food, meaning excess moisture can lead to steaming instead of crisping. If a recipe calls for 485 ml of water, using the correct cup equivalent ensures the right texture. For instance, when preparing <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/potatoes>air fryer roast potatoes</a>, too much water can make them limp, while too little may dry them out. Measuring 485 ml precisely helps achieve that golden crunch.</p>  

<h2>Converting 485 ml of Water for Baking and Sauces</h2>  
<p>Baking is a science, and liquid measurements must be exact. If a cake recipe requires 485 ml of water, using 2.05 US cups (or 1.7 UK cups) ensures the batter isn’t too runny or dense. Similarly, sauces like gravy or marinades rely on the right water-to-ingredient ratio. An air fryer’s efficiency means evaporation happens faster, so precise measurements prevent over-reduction.</p>  

<p>For those who love experimenting, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipe collection</a> includes dishes where 485 ml of water might be used in broths or batters. Whether you're making a savoury stew or a light tempura, converting millilitres to cups correctly guarantees success. Keep a measuring jug or digital scale handy for foolproof results.</p>  

<h3>Tips for Measuring 485 ml of Water Without a Scale</h3>  
<p>No measuring tools? No problem. A standard US cup (240 ml) filled twice plus a tablespoon (15 ml) roughly equals 485 ml. For UK cups, fill one cup (284 ml) and another halfway. While not as precise, this method works in a pinch. For air fryer cooking, though, we recommend using proper tools—especially when making delicate items like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>air fryer desserts</a> where consistency is key.</p>  

<h2>Common Mistakes When Converting 485 ml to Cups</h2>  
<p>One frequent error is mixing up US and UK cup sizes, leading to incorrect measurements. Another is assuming all liquids weigh the same—485 ml of water weighs 485 grams, but oils or syrups differ. Always use water-specific conversions unless stated otherwise. For cleaning your air fryer after cooking, check our guide on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>keeping your appliance spotless</a>.</p>  

<p>Lastly, remember that altitude and humidity can affect air fryer performance. If you're at high elevation, you might need slightly less water (around 460 ml instead of 485 ml) to compensate for faster evaporation. Adjustments ensure your dishes turn out perfectly every time.</p>

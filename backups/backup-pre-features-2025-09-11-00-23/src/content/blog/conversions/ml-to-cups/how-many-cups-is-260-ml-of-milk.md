faqQ1: "Is 260 ml of milk the same as 1 cup?"
faqA1: "No, 260 ml of milk is slightly more than 1 cup. In US measurements, 1 cup is 240 ml, so 260 ml equals about 1.1 cups. In UK measurements, 1 cup is 250 ml, making 260 ml roughly 1.04 cups. Always check which cup measurement your recipe uses."
faqQ2: "Can I use a regular drinking cup to measure 260 ml of milk?"
faqA2: "Drinking cups vary in size, so they aren’t reliable for precise measurements. A standard US cup is 240 ml, and a UK cup is 250 ml, so 260 ml would be just over. For accuracy, use a proper measuring cup or kitchen scale."
faqQ3: "How do I convert 260 ml of milk to ounces?"
faqA3: "260 ml of milk is approximately 8.8 fluid ounces. This conversion is useful for recipes using imperial measurements. Remember that fluid ounces measure volume, not weight, so don’t confuse them with dry ounces."
faqQ4: "Why do US and UK cups differ for 260 ml of milk?"
faqA4: "The US uses a customary cup of 240 ml, while the UK uses a metric cup of 250 ml. This means 260 ml translates to 1.1 US cups or 1.04 UK cups. Always confirm which standard your recipe follows to avoid errors."

<h2>Why Accurate Milk Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Getting the right amount of milk is crucial, especially in baking where ratios affect texture and rise. Too much or too little can lead to dense cakes or runny batters. For air fryer recipes, precise measurements ensure even cooking and perfect results. If you're following a recipe from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, converting 260 ml of milk to cups correctly guarantees consistency.</p>  

<p>Different countries use varying cup sizes, which can cause confusion. The US customary cup is 240 ml, while the UK metric cup is 250 ml. This means 260 ml of milk equals roughly 1.1 US cups or 1.04 UK cups. Always check which measurement system your recipe uses to avoid mistakes.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure 260 ml of Milk Without a Measuring Cup</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a measuring cup, you can still measure 260 ml of milk accurately. A standard tablespoon holds about 15 ml, so 260 ml is roughly 17 tablespoons. Alternatively, use a kitchen scale—260 ml of milk weighs around 260 grams. This method is especially handy for air fryer recipes where precision is key.</p>

<h2>Tips for Measuring Milk in Cups</h2>  
<p>When measuring 260 ml of milk, always use a liquid measuring cup for accuracy. Fill it to just above the 1-cup line for US measurements or slightly less for UK cups. Avoid using dry measuring cups, as they won’t give the same precision. For air fryer cooking, small deviations can affect results, so take care.</p>  

<p>If you're scaling a recipe up or down, remember that 260 ml of milk is roughly 10% more than a US cup. Adjust other ingredients proportionally to maintain balance. Keeping your air fryer clean with <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>proper cleaning tools</a> also ensures consistent cooking performance.</p>  

<h3>Does Milk Type Affect the Measurement?</h3>  
<p>Whole, skim, or plant-based milk all measure the same by volume—260 ml is 260 ml regardless of fat content. However, density can vary slightly, so for ultra-precise baking, weighing may be better. In most air fryer recipes, though, the difference is negligible.</p>

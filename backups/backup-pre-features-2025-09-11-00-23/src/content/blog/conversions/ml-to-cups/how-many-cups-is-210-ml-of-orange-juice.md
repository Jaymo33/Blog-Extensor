For example, 210 ml of orange juice might seem like a small amount, but in baking, it can determine whether your cake is moist or dry. Air fryers cook food quickly, so even slight deviations can lead to uneven results. Always measure liquids like orange juice carefully for the best outcome.</p>

<p>Using a standard measuring cup is the easiest way to ensure accuracy. If you don’t have one, a kitchen scale can help you weigh 210 grams of orange juice, which is roughly equivalent to 210 ml.

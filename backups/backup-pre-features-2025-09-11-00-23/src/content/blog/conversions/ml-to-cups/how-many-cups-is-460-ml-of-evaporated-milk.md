faqQ1: "Is 460 ml of evaporated milk the same as 2 cups?"
faqA1: "In the US measurement system, 460 ml of evaporated milk is approximately 1.94 cups, which is just under 2 cups. In the UK, where 1 cup equals 284 ml, 460 ml is about 1.62 cups. Always check which measurement system your recipe uses to ensure accuracy."
faqQ2: "Can I use regular milk instead of evaporated milk in a recipe calling for 460 ml?"
faqA2: "You can substitute regular milk, but the results will differ. Evaporated milk is thicker and richer, so using regular milk may make your dish less creamy. For best results, stick to evaporated milk or use a mix of regular milk and cream for a similar consistency."
faqQ3: "How do I measure 460 ml of evaporated milk without a measuring jug?"
faqA3: "If you don't have a measuring jug, use standard tablespoons. There are roughly 15 ml in a tablespoon, so 460 ml equals about 30.5 tablespoons. Alternatively, use a kitchen scale—460 ml of evaporated milk weighs approximately 490 grams."
faqQ4: "Does evaporated milk taste the same as regular milk?"
faqA4: "Evaporated milk has a slightly caramelised, richer flavour compared to regular milk due to the heating process. It's also thicker, making it ideal for recipes where creaminess is desired. It’s not the same as sweetened condensed milk, which has added sugar."

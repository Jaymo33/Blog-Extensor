faqQ1: "Is 35 ml of cream the same as 35 grams?"
faqA1: "No, 35 ml of cream is not the same as 35 grams. The weight of cream depends on its fat content. Single cream (around 18% fat) weighs roughly 36 grams per 35 ml, while double cream (48% fat) is closer to 38 grams. Always check your recipe for the correct measurement type."
faqQ2: "Can I use milk instead of 35 ml of cream in air fryer recipes?"
faqA2: "You can substitute milk for cream, but the result will be less rich. For 35 ml of cream, use 35 ml of whole milk mixed with a teaspoon of melted butter for a closer texture. Note that sauces may be thinner, so adjust cooking times slightly in your air fryer."
faqQ3: "How do I measure 35 ml of cream without a measuring jug?"
faqA3: "Use tablespoons—2 tablespoons plus 1 teaspoon equals roughly 35 ml. A standard shot glass (25-30 ml) topped up slightly also works. For accuracy, consider investing in cheap measuring spoons or a small liquid measuring cup."
faqQ4: "Does the type of cream affect the cup measurement for 35 ml?"
faqA4: "No, the cup measurement for 35 ml remains the same regardless of cream type (single, double, or whipping). However, thicker creams may settle differently in the cup, so always level it off for precision."

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of cream can make or break a recipe. Too little, and your dish might lack richness; too much, and it could become overly heavy or soggy. Air fryers, in particular, rely on balanced ingredients for even cooking. If you're preparing a creamy sauce or a dessert like our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>air fryer desserts</a>, 35 ml of cream needs to be measured correctly to avoid disappointment.</p>

<h3>UK vs. US Cup Measurements</h3>

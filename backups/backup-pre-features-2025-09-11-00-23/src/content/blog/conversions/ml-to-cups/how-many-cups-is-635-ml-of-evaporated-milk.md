faqQ1: "Is 635 ml of evaporated milk the same as condensed milk?"
faqA1: "No, evaporated milk and condensed milk are different. Evaporated milk is unsweetened and has about 60% of the water removed, while condensed milk is sweetened. They’re not interchangeable in recipes without adjusting sugar levels."
faqQ2: "Can I use regular milk instead of 635 ml of evaporated milk?"
faqA2: "You can substitute regular milk, but it will be thinner. To mimic evaporated milk, simmer regular milk to reduce it by about 60%. For 635 ml of evaporated milk, you’d need roughly 1.6 litres of regular milk, reduced."
faqQ3: "How do I measure 635 ml of evaporated milk without a jug?"
faqA3: "If you don’t have a measuring jug, use standard cups. Since 1 cup is about 237 ml, 635 ml equals roughly 2 and 2/3 cups. For precision, a kitchen scale set to grams (635 ml ≈ 652g) can also work."
faqQ4: "Why do air fryer recipes sometimes call for evaporated milk?"
faqA4: "Evaporated milk adds richness without excess moisture, which is ideal for air fryer cooking. It helps create creamy textures in dishes like custards or sauces without making them soggy. Check our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipes</a> for inspiration!"

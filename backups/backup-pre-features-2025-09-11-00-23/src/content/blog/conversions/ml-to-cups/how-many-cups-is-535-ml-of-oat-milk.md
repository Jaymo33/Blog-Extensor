faqQ1: "Is 535 ml of oat milk the same as 2 cups?"
faqA1: "No, 535 ml of oat milk is approximately 2.26 cups. While 2 cups equal roughly 473 ml, 535 ml is slightly more. For precise measurements, it's best to use a liquid measuring cup with millilitre markings or refer to a conversion chart."
faqQ2: "Can I use 535 ml of oat milk in any air fryer recipe?"
faqA2: "Yes, 535 ml of oat milk can be used in most air fryer recipes that call for liquid measurements. However, always check the recipe for specific instructions, as some may require adjustments for consistency or cooking time. Oat milk works well in batters, sauces, and even desserts."
faqQ3: "How do I measure 535 ml of oat milk without a measuring cup?"
faqA3: "If you don't have a measuring cup, you can use a standard drinking glass or mug, though this method is less accurate. A typical mug holds about 250-300 ml, so you'd need roughly two mugs to reach 535 ml. For best results, invest in a liquid measuring cup or use a kitchen scale for precision."
faqQ4: "Does the brand of oat milk affect the 535 ml to cups conversion?"
faqA4: "The brand of oat milk shouldn't significantly affect the volume conversion, as 535 ml will always be approximately 2.26 cups. However, thicker or creamier oat milks may pour slightly differently, so it's always best to measure by volume rather than relying solely on weight or estimates."

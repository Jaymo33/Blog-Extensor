faqQ1: "Is 635 ml of vegetable oil the same as 2.68 cups in all countries?"
faqA1: "No, cup measurements vary by country. While 635 ml equals 2.68 US cups, it's only about 2.23 UK cups. Always check which measurement system your air fryer recipe uses, especially when following international guides from sites like airfryerrecipe.co.uk."
faqQ2: "Can I use the same conversion for other types of oil in my air fryer?"
faqA2: "Yes, the 635 ml to cups conversion works for all liquid oils with similar viscosity to vegetable oil. However, thicker oils like coconut oil may pack differently in a measuring cup. For precise air fryer cooking, we recommend sticking to liquid measurements when possible."
faqQ3: "How do I measure 635 ml of vegetable oil without a measuring cup?"
faqA3: "If you don't have measuring cups, use a kitchen scale. Vegetable oil weighs approximately 0.92g per ml, so 635 ml would be about 584g. Alternatively, use tablespoons (16 tbsp = 1 US cup) or refer to our air fryer conversion chart for more measurement hacks."
faqQ4: "Why do some air fryer recipes use ml instead of cups for oil measurements?"
faqA4: "Millilitres provide more precise measurements than cups, which is crucial for air fryer cooking where oil quantities directly affect texture and crispiness. Metric measurements (like 635 ml) are also standard in most countries outside the US, making recipes more universally understandable."

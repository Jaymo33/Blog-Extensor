faqQ1: "How do I convert 364 fan oven to air fryer temperature?"
faqA1: "To convert 364 fan oven to air fryer temperature, reduce it by about 25°F. Set your air fryer to 340-350°F and check food a few minutes early. Air fryers cook faster than fan ovens, so adjustments prevent overcooking."
faqQ2: "Can I use the same cooking time when converting 364 fan oven to conventional oven?"
faqA2: "No, conventional ovens typically need slightly longer cooking times than fan ovens. When converting 364 fan oven to 400°F conventional, add 5-10 minutes to the original time. Always check for doneness with a thermometer or toothpick test."
faqQ3: "Why is the conversion from fan oven to conventional oven necessary?"
faqA3: "Fan ovens circulate hot air for faster, more even cooking, while conventional ovens use radiant heat. The conversion (adding 20-25°F) compensates for these differences, ensuring your food cooks properly without burning or undercooking."
faqQ4: "What types of recipes commonly use 364 fan oven temperature?"
faqA4: "364 fan oven (400°F conventional) is perfect for roasting vegetables, baking cookies, and cooking chicken. It's a versatile temperature that browns well while keeping food moist. Many cake and quick bread recipes also use this temperature range."

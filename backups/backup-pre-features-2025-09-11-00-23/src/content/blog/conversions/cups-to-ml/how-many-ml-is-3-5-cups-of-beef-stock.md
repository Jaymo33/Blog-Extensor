<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Using the correct amount of beef stock can make or break your dish. Too little, and your meal might lack depth; too much, and it could become overly watery. Air fryers cook food quickly and efficiently, so precise liquid measurements help maintain the right texture and flavour. For example, if you’re making a beef casserole in your air fryer, 828 ml of beef stock will ensure the perfect balance of moisture and taste.</p>

<h3>How to Measure 3.5 Cups of Beef Stock Without a Measuring Cup</h3>  
<p>Don’t have a measuring cup? No problem! A standard UK mug holds roughly 284 ml, so 3.5 cups would be just under three mugs. Alternatively, use a kitchen scale—since 1 ml of beef stock weighs approximately 1 gram, 828 ml will weigh around 828 grams. This method is especially useful if you’re scaling recipes up or down for your air fryer.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for 3.5 Cups of Beef Stock in Air Fryer Recipes</h2>  
<p>Beef stock is a versatile ingredient that adds depth to many air fryer dishes. From braised short ribs to mushroom risotto, having the right amount ensures rich, savoury flavours. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes</a>, you’ll find countless ways to use 828 ml of beef stock, whether you’re cooking beef, vegetables, or even tofu.</p>

<h3>Does the Type of Beef Stock Affect the Measurement?</h3>  
<p>Whether you’re using homemade, store-bought, or concentrated beef stock, the volume remains the same—3.5 cups will always equal 828 ml. However, the intensity of flavour may vary, so adjust seasonings accordingly. For best results in your air fryer, opt for low-sodium stock, as it gives you more control over the dish’s saltiness.</p>  

<h2>Tips for Storing Leftover Beef Stock</h2>  
<p>If your recipe doesn’t use all 828 ml of beef stock, you can store the leftovers for future air fryer meals. Pour it into an airtight container and refrigerate for up to 4 days, or freeze it for longer shelf life. Ice cube trays are perfect for portioning smaller amounts, so you can easily defrost what you need later.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Precision is key when using an air fryer, as even small deviations can affect texture and cooking time.

<p>Many air fryer recipes, especially baked goods, rely on exact liquid ratios. If a recipe calls for 0.25 cups of milk, using the correct ml measurement guarantees the right moisture balance. This is particularly important for dishes like air-fryer pancakes or custards, where precision ensures perfect results every time.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure 0.25 Cups of Milk Without a Measuring Cup</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a measuring cup, you can still measure 59 ml (0.25 cups) of milk using a kitchen scale or tablespoon. One tablespoon holds about 15 ml, so four tablespoons will give you roughly 59 ml. Alternatively, weigh the milk—since milk has a similar density to water, 59 ml weighs close to 59 grams.</p>  

<h2>Differences Between UK and US Cup Measurements</h2>  
<p>While 0.25 cups of milk is 59 ml in both the UK and US, cup sizes can vary for dry ingredients. For liquids like milk, the conversion remains consistent, making it easy to follow international recipes.

<h3>Common Recipes Using 0.25 Cups of Milk</h3>  
<p>Many air fryer recipes, like muffins or creamy pasta sauces, call for small amounts of milk.

<h2>Tips for Storing and Using Milk in Air Fryer Recipes</h2>  
<p>For best results, use fresh milk when measuring 0.25 cups (59 ml) for air fryer recipes. If substituting with plant-based milk, note that thicker alternatives like coconut milk may require slight adjustments.

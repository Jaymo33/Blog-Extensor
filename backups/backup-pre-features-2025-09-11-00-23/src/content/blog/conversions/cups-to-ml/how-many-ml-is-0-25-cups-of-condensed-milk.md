faqQ1: "Is 0.25 cups of condensed milk the same in the UK and USA?"
faqA1: "Yes, 0.25 cups of condensed milk equals 59 ml in both the UK and USA. Cup measurements are standardized in ml for liquids, including condensed milk, so the conversion remains consistent regardless of location."
faqQ2: "Can I use evaporated milk instead of condensed milk in air fryer recipes?"

faqQ3: "How do I measure 0.25 cups of condensed milk without a measuring cup?"
faqA3: "Use a kitchen scale: 0.25 cups (59 ml) of condensed milk weighs approximately 83 grams. Alternatively, a tablespoon holds about 15 ml, so 4 tablespoons (60 ml) will give you a close approximation."
faqQ4: "Why does my air fryer recipe with condensed milk turn out too sticky?"
faqA4: "Over-measuring condensed milk can make dishes overly sticky. Ensure you’re using exactly 59 ml (0.25 cups) and avoid overcooking, as sugar in condensed milk caramelises quickly in the air fryer’s intense heat."

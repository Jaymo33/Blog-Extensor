faqQ1: "Is 3.75 cups of condensed milk the same in the UK and US?"
faqA1: "Yes, 3.75 cups of condensed milk is the same volume in both the UK and US. However, always check your measuring cups, as some may vary slightly. For air fryer recipes, using ml (887 ml) is more precise."
faqQ2: "Can I use evaporated milk instead of condensed milk for this measurement?"

faqQ3: "How do I measure 3.75 cups of condensed milk without a measuring cup?"
faqA3: "If you don’t have a measuring cup, use a kitchen scale. Condensed milk weighs about 306 grams per cup, so 3.75 cups would be roughly 1,148 grams. For air fryer cooking, weighing ingredients can be more accurate."
faqQ4: "Why is my air fryer recipe not turning out with 3.75 cups of condensed milk?"

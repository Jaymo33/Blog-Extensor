faqQ1: "Is 1.0 cups of double cream the same in the UK and US?"
faqA1: "No, there’s a slight difference. In the UK, 1.0 cups of double cream equals 240 ml, while in the US, it’s approximately 236 ml. For most air fryer recipes, this small variance won’t matter, but for baking, sticking to 240 ml (UK standard) is best."
faqQ2: "Can I use single cream instead of double cream in air fryer recipes?"
faqA2: "Single cream has a lower fat content, so it won’t provide the same richness or stability as double cream. If substituting, adjust cooking times slightly, as single cream may separate or thin out faster in the air fryer’s high heat."
faqQ3: "How do I measure 1.0 cups of double cream without a measuring cup?"
faqA3: "Use a kitchen scale—1.0 cups of double cream weighs about 240 grams. Alternatively, a standard UK metric tablespoon holds 15 ml, so 16 tablespoons would equal 240 ml."
faqQ4: "Why does my air fryer recipe with double cream turn out watery?"
faqA4: "This could be due to over-measuring the cream or not preheating the air fryer. Ensure you’re using exactly 240 ml (1.0 cups) of double cream and follow recipe timings closely to avoid excess moisture."

faqQ1: "Can I use white vinegar instead of apple cider vinegar in air fryer recipes?"
faqA1: "Yes, but adjust the quantity slightly. White vinegar is more acidic, so use about 55 ml instead of 59 ml for 0.25 cups. Taste as you go to avoid overpowering the dish."
faqQ2: "How do I store leftover apple cider vinegar after measuring 0.25 cups?"
faqA2: "Keep it in a sealed glass bottle in a cool, dark place. Apple cider vinegar lasts indefinitely, but its flavour may mellow over time. Use it in dressings or cleaning solutions."
faqQ3: "Why does my air fryer recipe call for apple cider vinegar instead of lemon juice?"
faqA3: "Apple cider vinegar adds a milder tang and works better with certain flavours, like barbecue or honey glazes. It also helps tenderise meats more effectively than citrus."
faqQ4: "Is 0.25 cups of apple cider vinegar the same in all air fryer models?"
faqA4: "Yes, the measurement (59 ml) is standard, but cooking times may vary by model. Always preheat your air fryer and check food doneness with a thermometer for best results."

<p>Beyond marinades, vinegar is used in glazes, dressings, and even baking. If you’re adapting a traditional recipe for your air fryer, converting cups to ml eliminates guesswork.

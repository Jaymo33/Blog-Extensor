faqQ1: "Is 3.25 cups of lime juice the same in the UK and US?"
faqA1: "No, UK and US cups differ slightly. A US cup is 236.59 ml, while a UK cup is 284 ml. For 3.25 cups of lime juice, this means 768 ml in the US and approximately 923 ml in the UK. Always check your recipe’s origin for accuracy."

faqA4: "Roll limes firmly on a countertop before cutting to maximise yield. A handheld citrus press or electric juicer speeds up the process. For 3.25 cups (768 ml), you’ll need roughly 50–60 medium limes, depending on their juiciness."

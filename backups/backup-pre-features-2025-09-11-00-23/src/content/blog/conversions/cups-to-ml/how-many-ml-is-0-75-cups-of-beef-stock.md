faqQ1: "Is 0.75 cups of beef stock the same in the UK and US?"
faqA1: "Yes, 0.75 cups of beef stock equals 177 ml in both the UK and US, as most modern recipes use the US cup measurement (236.6 ml per cup). Historically, a UK cup was 284 ml, but this is rarely used today."
faqQ2: "Can I use a kitchen scale to measure 0.75 cups of beef stock?"
faqA2: "While scales measure weight, not volume, you can approximate 0.75 cups (177 ml) of beef stock by weight. Beef stock weighs roughly 240 grams per cup, so 0.75 cups would be about 180 grams. For accuracy, stick to liquid measuring tools."
faqQ3: "How do I measure 0.75 cups of beef stock without a measuring cup?"
faqA3: "Use a standard 250 ml mug and fill it just over two-thirds full for 177 ml. Alternatively, 12 tablespoons equal 0.75 cups. For consistent results, invest in a liquid measuring cup with ml and cup markings."
faqQ4: "Why does my air fryer recipe call for 0.75 cups of beef stock instead of a full cup?"
faqA4: "Air fryers have limited space, so recipes often use smaller liquid quantities to prevent spills or uneven cooking. 0.75 cups (177 ml) is a common amount for sauces or marinades that need to coat food without pooling. Always follow recipe measurements for best results."

<p>0.75 cups of beef stock equals approximately 177 ml. This conversion is essential for precise cooking, especially when using an air fryer, where exact liquid measurements can affect texture and flavour. Whether you're making gravy, soups, or marinades, knowing how to convert cups to millilitres ensures consistency in your recipes.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on rapid air circulation to cook food evenly, and liquids like beef stock play a crucial role in keeping dishes moist. Using the correct amount of beef stock—177 ml for 0.75 cups—helps prevent over-drying or sogginess. For example, if you're preparing a beef stew in your air fryer, too little stock could leave the meat tough, while too much might make it watery.</p>

<h2>How to Measure 0.75 Cups of Beef Stock Correctly</h2>  
<p>Measuring liquids like beef stock can be tricky if you don’t have the right tools. A liquid measuring cup with clear ml and cup markings is ideal. Fill it to the 0.75 cup line, or pour until the liquid reaches 177 ml. Avoid using dry measuring cups, as they won’t give you an accurate reading for liquids.</p>  
<p>If you’re scaling a recipe up or down, remember that 1 cup of beef stock equals 236.6 ml, so 0.75 cups is roughly three-quarters of that. For more air fryer-friendly recipes, browse our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipes section</a>.</p>  

<h3>US vs. UK Cup Measurements</h3>

For 0.75 cups of beef stock, this means 177 ml in the US system. Always check which measurement standard your recipe follows to avoid discrepancies.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for 0.75 Cups (177 ml) of Beef Stock</h2>

faqQ1: "Is 2.25 cups of cream the same in the UK and USA?"
faqA1: "Yes, 2.25 cups of cream is the same volume in both the UK and USA. However, always double-check your measuring cups, as some older UK cups may differ slightly. For air fryer recipes, precision is key, so using ml (532.5 ml) is often more reliable."
faqQ2: "Can I use whipped cream instead of liquid cream for this measurement?"
faqA2: "No, whipped cream has a different volume due to the air incorporated during whipping. If your recipe calls for 2.25 cups (532.5 ml) of liquid cream, measure it before whipping. Using whipped cream could alter the texture and cooking time in your air fryer."
faqQ3: "How do I convert 2.25 cups of cream to grams?"
faqA3: "Cream’s weight varies by fat content, but generally, 2.25 cups (532.5 ml) of heavy cream weighs about 540 grams. For lighter creams, the weight may be slightly less. A kitchen scale is the best tool for accurate conversions in air fryer recipes."
faqQ4: "What’s the best way to store leftover cream after measuring?"
faqA4: "Store leftover cream in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 5 days. For longer storage, freeze it in measured portions. Thawed cream may separate, but it’s still fine for cooking in your air fryer. Always give it a good stir before using."

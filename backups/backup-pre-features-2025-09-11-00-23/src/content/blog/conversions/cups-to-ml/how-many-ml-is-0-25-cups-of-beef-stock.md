faqQ1: "Is 0.25 cups of beef stock the same in the UK and US?"
faqA1: "Yes, 0.25 cups of beef stock is the same measurement in both the UK and US, equalling approximately 59 ml. However, UK recipes may list metric measurements (ml) more frequently, while US recipes often use cups."
faqQ2: "Can I use a kitchen scale to measure 0.25 cups of beef stock?"
faqA2: "While a scale measures weight, not volume, beef stock has a similar density to water (1 ml ≈ 1 gram). So, 0.25 cups (59 ml) would weigh roughly 59 grams. For precision, though, a liquid measuring cup is best."
faqQ3: "How do I adjust cooking time if using 0.25 cups of beef stock in an air fryer?"
faqA3: "Air fryers cook quickly, so recipes with 0.25 cups (59 ml) of beef stock may need slightly less time than oven versions. Start checking for doneness a few minutes early to prevent over-reducing the liquid."
faqQ4: "What if my recipe calls for 0.25 cups of beef broth instead of stock?"
faqA4: "Beef broth and stock are interchangeable in most recipes, including air fryer dishes. Both 0.25 cups of broth or stock equal 59 ml, though broth may be slightly saltier, so adjust seasonings accordingly."

<h3>How to Measure 0.25 Cups of Beef Stock Without a Measuring Cup</h3>

<p>Some recipes may call for reduced beef stock, where 0.25 cups (59 ml) simmers down to a more concentrated flavour. In an air fryer, reducing liquids isn’t always practical, so pre-measuring ensures you get the right intensity. Always taste and adjust seasonings after adding beef stock, as brands vary in saltiness.</p>  

<h3>Does the Type of Beef Stock Affect the Measurement?</h3>  
<p>Homemade, store-bought, or powdered beef stock all measure the same—0.25 cups equals 59 ml. However, thicker or gelatinous stocks may require stirring before measuring for accuracy. If using powdered stock, dissolve it fully in water first, then measure out 0.25 cups (59 ml) for consistent results in your air fryer dishes.</p>

faqQ1: "Is 1.5 cups of half and half the same in the UK and USA?"
faqA1: "Yes, 1.5 cups of half and half is the same volume in both the UK and USA, equalling roughly 355 ml. However, cup sizes can vary slightly in other countries, so always use a standard measuring cup for accuracy."
faqQ2: "Can I use milk instead of half and half in air fryer recipes?"
faqA2: "You can substitute milk, but the texture and richness will differ. Half and half contains more fat, which helps create creamier results. For best outcomes, stick to the recipe’s measurements, like 1.5 cups (355 ml) of half and half."
faqQ3: "How do I measure 1.5 cups of half and half without a measuring cup?"
faqA3: "If you don’t have a measuring cup, use a kitchen scale. Half and half weighs roughly 360 grams for 1.5 cups (355 ml). Alternatively, a standard mug holds about 250 ml, so 1.5 cups would be slightly less than 1.5 mugs."
faqQ4: "Why is my air fryer recipe too runny with 1.5 cups of half and half?"
faqA4: "If your dish is too runny, you may need to adjust cooking time or temperature. Air fryers vary, so start with less liquid and add gradually. Ensure you’re using exactly 355 ml (1.5 cups) of half and half for consistency."

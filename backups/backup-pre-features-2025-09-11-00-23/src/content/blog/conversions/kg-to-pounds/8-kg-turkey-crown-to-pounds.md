<h2>Practical tips for cooking an 8 kg turkey crown in your air fryer</h2>
<p>Cooking an 8 kg turkey crown in an air fryer requires careful planning due to its size and weight. First, ensure your air fryer basket is large enough to accommodate the turkey crown comfortably without overcrowding, which could impede air circulation and result in uneven cooking. Preheating your air fryer is recommended to ensure it starts at the right temperature, helping to seal in juices and achieve a crispy exterior. Based on the 8 kg turkey crown to pounds conversion (approximately 17.64 pounds), you can estimate cooking time at around 10-12 minutes per pound at 180°C, but always check your specific air fryer's manual for guidance.</p>
<p>Using a meat thermometer is essential to verify the internal temperature reaches 75°C in the thickest part of the turkey, ensuring it's fully cooked and safe to eat. Let the turkey rest for 10-15 minutes after cooking to allow the juices to redistribute, resulting in a more tender and flavourful meal.

<h3>Common mistakes to avoid with large turkey crowns</h3>

Always measure your air fryer basket and compare it to the dimensions of your 8 kg turkey crown to ensure a proper fit. Another error is skipping the resting period, which can cause the meat to be less juicy and more difficult to carve. Additionally, avoid opening the air fryer frequently during cooking, as this releases heat and can extend the cooking time unnecessarily, affecting the final texture and doneness.</p>

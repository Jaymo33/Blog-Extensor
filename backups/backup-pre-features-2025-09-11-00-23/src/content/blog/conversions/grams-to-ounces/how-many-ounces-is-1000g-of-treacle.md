faqQ1: "Can I use cups instead of ounces to measure 1000g of treacle?"
faqA1: "While you can use cups, it’s not ideal for treacle due to its thickness. Weight (grams or ounces) is more accurate. 1000g of treacle is roughly 3.5 cups, but this can vary based on how you pour it."
faqQ2: "How long does 1000g of treacle last once opened?"
faqA2: "Opened treacle lasts about 12 months if stored in a cool, dry place. Keep the lid tightly sealed to prevent it from drying out or absorbing moisture."
faqQ3: "Can I substitute golden syrup for treacle in air fryer recipes?"
faqA3: "Yes, but the flavour will be lighter. Golden syrup is sweeter and less robust than treacle, so adjust other sugars in the recipe accordingly."
faqQ4: "Is 1000g of treacle the same as 1kg?"
faqA4: "Yes, 1000 grams is exactly 1 kilogram. So whether your recipe calls for 1000g or 1kg of treacle, it’s the same amount."

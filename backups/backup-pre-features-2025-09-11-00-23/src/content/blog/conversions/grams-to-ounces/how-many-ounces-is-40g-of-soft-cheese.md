<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Using the correct amount of ingredients is crucial for air fryer recipes, especially when it comes to soft cheese. Too much or too little can affect texture and flavour. Soft cheeses like cream cheese, ricotta, or goat cheese melt differently, so precise measurements ensure consistency. If you're new to air frying, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a> has plenty of ideas to get you started.</p>  

<p>Converting 40g of soft cheese to ounces is simple, but it’s also useful to know how this measurement fits into larger recipes. For example, 40g is roughly a quarter of a standard UK cream cheese tub. This makes it easier to visualise if you don’t have scales handy. Always measure ingredients like soft cheese carefully for the best air fryer results.</p>  

<h3>How to measure soft cheese without scales</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have digital scales, you can still measure 40g of soft cheese using tablespoons. One tablespoon of soft cheese is about 15g, so 40g would be just under three tablespoons. This method isn’t as precise but works in a pinch.

faqQ1: "Is 50g of caster sugar the same as 50g of granulated sugar in weight?"
faqA1: "Yes, 50g of caster sugar and 50g of granulated sugar weigh the same (1.76 oz). However, caster sugar is finer, so it occupies slightly less volume. For air fryer recipes, caster sugar blends better, ensuring even sweetness."
faqQ2: "How do I store caster sugar to keep it fresh for air fryer recipes?"
faqA2: "Store caster sugar in an airtight container in a cool, dry place. Moisture can cause clumping, which affects measurements. For long-term freshness, avoid storing it near the stove or in humid areas."
faqQ3: "Can I use 50g of caster sugar in savoury air fryer dishes?"
faqA3: "While uncommon, a small amount (like 50g) can balance acidity in glazes or marinades. For example, a honey-soy glaze might include caster sugar for caramelisation. Use sparingly to avoid overpowering flavours."
faqQ4: "Why does my air fryer recipe specify caster sugar instead of granulated?"
faqA4: "Caster sugar dissolves faster, creating smoother batters and even browning. In air fryers, where cooking is rapid, this ensures consistent texture. Granulated sugar can leave a grittier finish in delicate bakes like sponges."

<p>50g of caster sugar equals approximately 1.76 ounces. This conversion is essential for anyone using an air fryer, especially when following British recipes that require precise measurements. Whether you're baking cakes or whipping up desserts, knowing how to convert grams to ounces ensures your dishes turn out perfectly every time.</p>

<h2>Why Convert 50g of Caster Sugar to Ounces?</h2>  
<p>Many air fryer recipes, especially those from the UK, list ingredients in grams. However, some kitchen scales or measuring cups might only display ounces. Converting 50g of caster sugar to ounces (1.76 oz) helps maintain accuracy, which is crucial for baking. A slight mismeasurement can affect texture and taste, so getting it right matters.</p>  
<p>If you're exploring <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer dessert recipes</a>, precise sugar measurements ensure your treats aren’t too sweet or too bland. Caster sugar dissolves faster than granulated sugar, making it ideal for air fryer cakes and cookies.

<h2>How to Measure 50g of Caster Sugar Without Scales</h2>  
<p>Don’t have a kitchen scale? No problem. You can measure 50g of caster sugar (1.76 oz) using tablespoons. One level tablespoon holds roughly 12.5g of caster sugar, so four tablespoons will give you 50g. For best results, spoon the sugar lightly into the measuring spoon and level it off with a knife.</p>  
<p>If you're making <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>air fryer cakes</a>, accuracy is key. Too much sugar can cause over-browning, while too little may leave your bake dry. Always double-check measurements for consistent results.</p>  

<h3>Does Caster Sugar Behave Differently in an Air Fryer?</h3>  
<p>Caster sugar works just like granulated sugar in an air fryer but dissolves faster due to its finer texture. This makes it perfect for sponges, meringues, and quick bakes. Since air fryers cook faster than conventional ovens, using caster sugar ensures even sweetness distribution.</p>  

<h2>Common Recipes Using 50g of Caster Sugar</h2>  
<p>Many air fryer recipes call for 50g of caster sugar, such as small-batch cupcakes, cookies, or mousses. For example, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cookies>air fryer cookie recipes</a> often use this amount for the perfect sweetness. Measuring correctly ensures your bakes rise evenly and taste just right.</p>  
<p>If you're reheating desserts like fruit crumbles, a sprinkle of caster sugar (around 50g) can revive their crispness. Just remember to clean your air fryer afterward with our recommended <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning guide</a> to avoid sticky residue.</p>  

<h3>Can I Substitute Granulated Sugar for Caster Sugar?</h3>  
<p>Yes, but with caution. Granulated sugar is coarser, so 50g (1.76 oz) may not blend as smoothly. For best results in air fryer baking, pulse granulated sugar in a blender to mimic caster sugar’s texture.</p>

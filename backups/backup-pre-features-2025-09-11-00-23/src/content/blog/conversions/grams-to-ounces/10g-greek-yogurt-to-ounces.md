faqQ1: "Why would I need to convert 10g of Greek yogurt to ounces?"
faqA1: "Many UK air fryer recipes provide measurements in grams, but some cooks prefer working with ounces for precision. Converting 10g of Greek yogurt to ounces (0.35 oz) helps when following international recipes or using measuring tools that display ounces rather than grams."
faqQ2: "Can I use regular yogurt instead of Greek yogurt in air fryer recipes?"
faqA2: "While you can substitute regular yogurt, Greek yogurt's thicker consistency often works better in air fryer recipes. If using regular yogurt, you might need to adjust quantities slightly as it's more watery. For 10g conversions, the ounce measurement remains the same regardless of yogurt type."
faqQ3: "How do I measure 10g of Greek yogurt without scales?"
faqA3: "Without scales, you can approximate 10g of Greek yogurt using teaspoons. Two level teaspoons equal roughly 10g (0.35 oz). For more accuracy, consider investing in digital kitchen scales, especially if you frequently cook with your air fryer."
faqQ4: "Does the fat content affect the 10g to ounces conversion?"
faqA4: "No, the fat content doesn't change the weight conversion. Whether you're using full-fat or low-fat Greek yogurt, 10g will always equal approximately 0.35 ounces. The difference lies in nutritional content rather than weight measurements for air fryer recipes."

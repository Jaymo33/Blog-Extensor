faqQ1: "Can I use volume measurements instead of weight for tahini?"
faqA1: "While you can use tablespoons or cups, weight measurements (like grams or ounces) are far more accurate for tahini due to its thick, sticky consistency. 100g of tahini equals roughly 6 tablespoons, but this can vary based on how it’s packed. For air fryer recipes, a kitchen scale is best."
faqQ2: "Does the brand of tahini affect the 100g to ounces conversion?"
faqA2: "No, the conversion from 100g to ounces (3.53 oz) remains the same regardless of the tahini brand. However, thicker or oilier tahini may measure slightly differently by volume, so weight is always the most reliable method."
faqQ3: "How long does 100g of tahini last once opened?"
faqA3: "An opened jar of tahini stays fresh for about 3–6 months in the fridge. Stir well before using, as separation is normal. If your 100g portion smells rancid or has mould, discard it immediately."
faqQ4: "Can I freeze tahini in 100g portions?"
faqA4: "Yes, tahini freezes well for up to 6 months. Portion it into 100g (3.53 oz) amounts in airtight containers or ice cube trays for easy use in future air fryer recipes. Thaw in the fridge overnight before stirring."

<h2>Why accurate tahini measurements matter</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of tahini can elevate your air fryer dishes, from crispy falafel to creamy sauces.

faqQ1: "Can I use bottled lemon juice instead of fresh for 5g measurements?"
faqA1: "Yes, you can use bottled lemon juice, but fresh is preferred for flavour. Bottled juice may contain preservatives or added water, which can slightly alter the weight. For accuracy, stick to freshly squeezed when possible."
faqQ2: "How do I convert larger amounts of lemon juice from grams to ounces?"
faqA2: "To convert larger quantities, multiply the grams by 0.035 to get ounces. For example, 10g of lemon juice would be 0.35 oz. Always use a digital scale for the most precise results, especially in air fryer cooking."
faqQ3: "Why does 5g of lemon juice matter in air fryer recipes?"
faqA3: "Air fryers cook food quickly, so small amounts of lemon juice can have a big impact. Too much can make food overly acidic, while too little might not provide enough flavour. Precise measurements ensure balanced results every time."
faqQ4: "Can I substitute lime juice for lemon juice in a 5g measurement?"
faqA4: "Yes, lime juice can be substituted in the same amount (5g or 0.18 oz), but note that lime has a slightly different flavour profile. It works well in most recipes, though the taste will be more tropical and less citrusy."

<h2>Why Convert 5g of Lemon Juice to Ounces?</h2>  
<p>Many UK recipes, especially those for air fryers, list ingredients in grams, while some cooks prefer using ounces for measurement.

Whether you're preparing a <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken dish</a> or a light dessert, precise measurements matter. Too much lemon juice can overpower a dish, while too little might leave it lacking that fresh zing.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure 5g of Lemon Juice Accurately</h3>  
<p>For the most accurate conversion of 5g lemon juice to ounces, use a digital kitchen scale set to grams. If your scale displays ounces, it should read around 0.18 oz. Alternatively, you can use measuring spoons—5g is roughly one teaspoon of lemon juice, though this can vary slightly depending on the lemon's ripeness and juiciness.</p>

<h3>Does Lemon Juice Weight Change When Cooked?</h3>  
<p>When heated in an air fryer, lemon juice reduces slightly due to evaporation, but the weight difference for 5g is minimal. If using it in a sauce or glaze, account for this by adding a tiny bit extra if needed. Always taste as you go to balance flavours perfectly.</p>  

<h2>Tips for Storing and Using Lemon Juice</h2>  
<p>Freshly squeezed lemon juice is best for accuracy when measuring 5g (0.18 oz). Store leftover juice in an airtight container in the fridge for up to a week. For longer storage, freeze lemon juice in ice cube trays—each cube is roughly 15g, so you can thaw a third for 5g portions.</p>

faqQ1: "Is 20g of olive oil the same as 20ml?"
faqA1: "No, 20g of olive oil isn't the same as 20ml. While they're close, olive oil's density means 20g equals about 21.6ml. For air frying, the weight measurement (20g/0.71 oz) is more accurate than volume."
faqQ2: "How many calories are in 20g of olive oil?"
faqA2: "20g of olive oil contains approximately 177 calories. This 0.71-ounce portion packs energy, so use it wisely in air fryer recipes. Measuring helps control calorie intake while still getting crispy results."
faqQ3: "Can I use other oils instead of olive oil in my air fryer?"
faqA3: "Yes, you can substitute olive oil with avocado, canola, or peanut oil in your air fryer. Just maintain the same 20g (0.71 oz) measurement for consistent results. Each oil brings different flavors and smoke points to your cooking."
faqQ4: "Why does my air fryer recipe specify grams instead of ounces for oil?"
faqA4: "Many air fryer recipes use grams because it's more precise for small oil quantities. 20g (0.71 oz) measurements ensure consistency, especially in compact air fryer baskets where every drop counts. Metric measurements are also standard in most recipe development."

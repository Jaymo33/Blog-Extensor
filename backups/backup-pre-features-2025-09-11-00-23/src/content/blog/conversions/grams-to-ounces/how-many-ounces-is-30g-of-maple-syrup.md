faqQ1: "Is 30g of maple syrup the same as 30ml?"
faqA1: "No, 30g of maple syrup is not the same as 30ml. Maple syrup is denser than water, so 30g equals about 22ml. Always measure by weight for accuracy in recipes, especially when using an air fryer."
faqQ2: "Can I use honey instead of maple syrup in air fryer recipes?"
faqA2: "Yes, you can substitute honey for maple syrup, but the flavour and consistency will differ. Honey is sweeter and thicker, so you may need to adjust the quantity. For 30g of maple syrup (1.06 oz), use about 25g of honey."
faqQ3: "How do I store maple syrup for air fryer recipes?"
faqA3: "Store maple syrup in a cool, dark place or the fridge to prevent mould. If it crystallises, warm it gently before measuring. Proper storage ensures your 30g (1.06 oz) portions remain consistent for recipes."
faqQ4: "Why does my air fryer recipe taste too sweet with maple syrup?"
faqA4: "If your dish is overly sweet, you may have used too much syrup. Remember, 30g of maple syrup is 1.06 ounces—stick to this measurement for balanced flavour. You can also reduce other sweeteners in the recipe."

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of maple syrup can make or break your dish. Too little, and you might miss out on flavour; too much, and your food could become overly sweet or sticky. Air fryers cook quickly, so precise measurements ensure even cooking and perfect texture. If you're new to air frying, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipes section</a> has plenty of ideas to get you started.</p>  

<p>Maple syrup is a popular ingredient in both sweet and savoury air fryer dishes. From glazed salmon to maple-roasted carrots, it adds a rich, caramelised flavour. Measuring 30g of maple syrup to ounces (1.06 oz) helps you follow recipes accurately, especially if they’re written in different measurement systems. For more inspiration, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipes</a> that use maple syrup.</p>  

<h2>How to measure 30g of maple syrup without scales</h2>  
<p>Don’t have a kitchen scale? No problem. One tablespoon of maple syrup weighs roughly 20g, so 1.5 tablespoons will give you close to 30g (about 1.06 ounces). For sticky ingredients like syrup, lightly greasing your measuring spoon can help it slide off easily. If you're working with larger quantities, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a> can help you scale up or down.</p>

<h2>Common mistakes when converting grams to ounces</h2>  
<p>One of the biggest mistakes is assuming all liquids weigh the same. Maple syrup is denser than water, so 30g takes up less volume. Always use weight measurements for accuracy, especially in air fryer recipes where consistency is key. If you're unsure, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> has plenty of resources to help you master conversions.</p>  

<p>Another error is forgetting to account for temperature. Cold maple syrup is thicker and harder to measure, while warm syrup flows more easily. For best results, measure at room temperature. Whether you're making desserts or marinades, knowing that 30g of maple syrup is 1.06 ounces ensures your dishes turn out perfectly every time.</p>

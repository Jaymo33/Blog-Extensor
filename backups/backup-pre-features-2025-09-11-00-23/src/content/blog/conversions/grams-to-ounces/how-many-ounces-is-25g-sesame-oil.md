faqQ1: "Can I use 25g of sesame oil for air frying chicken?"
faqA1: "Yes, 25g of sesame oil (0.88 ounces) works well for marinating or coating chicken before air frying. Its rich flavour enhances the dish, but be mindful not to overdo it, as sesame oil is potent. For best results, mix it with other ingredients like soy sauce or honey."
faqQ2: "How does 25g of sesame oil compare to other oils in an air fryer?"
faqA2: "25g of sesame oil (0.88 ounces) has a stronger flavour than neutral oils like vegetable or sunflower oil. It’s best used sparingly in dressings or marinades rather than for deep frying. Its high smoke point makes it suitable for air frying, but it’s more expensive than everyday oils."
faqQ3: "Is 25g of sesame oil the same as 25ml?"
faqA3: "No, 25g of sesame oil isn’t the same as 25ml. Sesame oil is denser than water, so 25g equals roughly 23ml. Always weigh sesame oil for accuracy, especially in air fryer recipes where precision matters."
faqQ4: "Can I substitute another oil for 25g of sesame oil in recipes?"
faqA4: "You can substitute another oil, but the flavour will differ. For a similar nutty taste, try toasted peanut oil. Use the same weight (25g or 0.88 ounces) to maintain the recipe’s balance. Neutral oils like rapeseed work if you’re avoiding strong flavours."

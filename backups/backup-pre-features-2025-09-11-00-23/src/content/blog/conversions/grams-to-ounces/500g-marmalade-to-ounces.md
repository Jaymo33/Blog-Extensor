faqQ1: "Is 500g of marmalade the same as 500ml?"
faqA1: "No, 500g of marmalade is not the same as 500ml. Grams measure weight, while millilitres measure volume. Marmalade’s thick consistency means 500g may take up less space than 500ml of a thinner liquid. Always weigh sticky ingredients like marmalade for accuracy."
faqQ2: "Can I use a cup to measure 500g of marmalade?"
faqA2: "While possible, using a cup for 500g marmalade isn’t ideal due to its sticky texture. A kitchen scale is more accurate. If needed, 500g is roughly 2 metric cups, but greasing the cup helps release the marmalade cleanly."
faqQ3: "How long does 500g of marmalade last once opened?"
faqA3: "Opened marmalade lasts about 6–12 months in the fridge if sealed properly. Check for mould or off smells before use. For air fryer recipes, fresh marmalade ensures the best flavour and texture."
faqQ4: "Can I freeze 500g of marmalade for later use?"
faqA4: "Yes, freezing 500g marmalade in airtight containers works well. Thaw in the fridge before using in air fryer recipes. Stir well after thawing, as separation may occur. Freezing doesn’t affect flavour but may slightly alter texture."

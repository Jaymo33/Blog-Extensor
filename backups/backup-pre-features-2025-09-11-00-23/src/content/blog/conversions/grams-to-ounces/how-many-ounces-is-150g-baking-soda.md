faqQ1: "Why is it important to measure baking soda accurately in air fryer recipes?"
faqA1: "Accurate measurements ensure your dishes rise properly and taste as intended. Too much baking soda can leave a bitter taste, while too little may result in flat, dense baked goods. Precision is key for perfect air fryer results every time."
faqQ2: "Can I use volume measurements (like cups) instead of weight for baking soda?"
faqA2: "Weight measurements (grams or ounces) are far more accurate than volume for baking soda. A slight variance in how packed the powder is can drastically alter the amount. Always use a scale for the best results, especially in air fryer baking."
faqQ3: "How do I convert other gram measurements to ounces for air fryer cooking?"
faqA3: "Multiply the grams by 0.035 to get ounces. For example, 200g would be 7 ounces. Keep a conversion chart handy, or use a digital scale that switches between units effortlessly."
faqQ4: "Does baking soda expire, and how does that affect measurements?"
faqA4: "Yes, baking soda loses potency over time. Expired baking soda won’t provide the same lift, so always check freshness before use. Storing it properly in an airtight container helps prolong its effectiveness."

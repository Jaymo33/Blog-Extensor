faqQ1: "Why is it better to weigh marmalade rather than measure by volume?"
faqA1: "Weighing marmalade is more accurate because its sticky consistency means volume measurements can vary greatly. A 'cup' of marmalade could be compacted or contain air pockets, while 125g (4.41 ounces) will always be the same amount. Digital scales remove this guesswork for perfect results every time."
faqQ2: "Can I use this 125g to ounces conversion for other jams and preserves?"
faqA2: "Yes, the 125g to 4.41 ounces conversion works for all jams, preserves and marmalades as they have similar densities. However, very chunky preserves with large fruit pieces might vary slightly, but the difference is negligible for most air fryer recipes."
faqQ3: "How can I measure 125g of marmalade without scales?"
faqA3: "Without scales, you can approximate 125g (4.41 ounces) of marmalade as about 8 level tablespoons. However, this method isn't as precise as weighing. For best results in air fryer cooking, we recommend investing in inexpensive digital kitchen scales for accurate measurements."
faqQ4: "Does the type of marmalade affect the 125g to ounces conversion?"
faqA4: "The basic conversion of 125g to 4.41 ounces remains the same regardless of marmalade type (thick-cut, fine-cut, dark or light). However, thicker marmalades may be harder to measure precisely by volume, reinforcing why weight measurements are superior for consistent results in air fryer recipes."

faqQ1: "Can I use golden syrup instead of treacle in my air fryer recipe?"
faqA1: "Yes, you can substitute golden syrup for treacle, but the flavour will be lighter. Golden syrup is sweeter and less robust, so adjust other sweeteners accordingly. For recipes where treacle’s deep flavour is key, like gingerbread, stick to treacle."
faqQ2: "How do I convert other treacle amounts from grams to ounces?"
faqA2: "To convert any amount, multiply the grams by 0.0353 to get ounces. For example, 50g of treacle is 1.76 ounces. Keep a conversion chart handy for quick reference when cooking."
faqQ3: "Why does my treacle measurement seem off when using cups?"
faqA3: "Treacle’s thickness makes it hard to measure accurately by volume. Air pockets or uneven pouring can lead to inconsistencies. For precision, always weigh treacle instead of using cups or spoons."
faqQ4: "Can I freeze leftover treacle for later use?"
faqA4: "Yes, treacle freezes well. Portion it into small containers or ice cube trays for easy use. Thaw at room temperature before measuring. Freezing doesn’t affect the flavour or texture."

<p>20g of treacle equals approximately 0.71 ounces. This conversion is handy when following air fryer recipes that use metric or imperial measurements. Whether you're baking a sticky treacle pudding or glazing meats, knowing the exact weight ensures perfect results. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we help you navigate these conversions effortlessly. Let’s dive deeper into measuring treacle for your air fryer.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Precision is key when using an air fryer, as ingredients cook faster and more evenly. Treacle, being a thick syrup, can affect texture and sweetness if not measured correctly. A slight variation in weight might throw off your recipe, especially in baked goods. For example, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>treacle cake recipe</a> relies on exact measurements for the perfect rise. Always use a digital scale for the most accurate results.</p>  

<p>Converting 20g of treacle to ounces is straightforward, but understanding the context helps. Treacle’s density means it weighs differently than water or flour. This is why volume measurements (like tablespoons) can be less reliable. For consistent results, stick to weight-based conversions. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for other common ingredients.</p>  

<h3>How to measure treacle without a scale</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a scale, you can estimate 20g of treacle using tablespoons. One tablespoon of treacle weighs roughly 20g, but this can vary slightly. To ensure accuracy, lightly grease the spoon to help the treacle slide off easily. For sticky ingredients like treacle, a silicone spatula is your best friend. Remember, these methods are approximations—investing in a scale is ideal for precision.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for treacle in air fryer recipes</h2>  
<p>Treacle adds depth and sweetness to both sweet and savoury dishes. In the air fryer, it’s perfect for glazing ham, making gingerbread, or drizzling over roasted vegetables. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert category</a> features several treacle-based treats. The rich, molasses-like flavour pairs well with spices like cinnamon and cloves. Just 20g of treacle can transform a simple dish into something extraordinary.</p>  

<p>For a quick treacle glaze, mix 20g (0.71 ounces) with mustard and brush it over sausages or chicken. The air fryer’s high heat caramelises the treacle, creating a sticky, glossy finish. Treacle also works wonders in marinades, adding a touch of sweetness to balance acidity. Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipes</a> for inspiration. With the right measurements, your dishes will turn out perfectly every time.</p>  

<h3>Storing and handling treacle</h3>  
<p>Treacle can be messy, so proper storage is essential. Keep it in an airtight container to prevent it from drying out or crystallising. If your treacle hardens, gently warm it in a water bath before measuring. Clean your air fryer basket promptly after using treacle to avoid stubborn residue. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning guide</a> has tips for tackling sticky messes. Proper handling ensures your treacle stays fresh and easy to use.</p>

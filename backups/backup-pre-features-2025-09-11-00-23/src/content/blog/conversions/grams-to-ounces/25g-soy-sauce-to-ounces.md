faqQ1: "Can I use 25g of light and dark soy sauce interchangeably in air fryer recipes?"
faqA1: "Light and dark soy sauce have different intensities – light is saltier while dark is sweeter and thicker. For 25g measurements, you can swap them but may need to adjust other seasonings. In air fryer cooking, dark soy sauce gives richer colour to meats."
faqQ2: "How many calories are in 25g of soy sauce?"
faqA2: "Twenty-five grams of soy sauce contains about 20-25 calories, mostly from sodium. While it’s low-calorie, its high salt content means moderation is key, especially in air fryer recipes where flavours concentrate during cooking."
faqQ3: "Does 25g of soy sauce equal 25ml?"
faqA3: "Not exactly. Soy sauce’s density means 25g is roughly 24ml – close enough for most air fryer recipes. For precision in sauces or marinades, weigh rather than measure by volume, especially with sticky liquids."
faqQ4: "Can I reduce 25g of soy sauce in the air fryer?"
faqA4: "Yes, but carefully. Pour 25g of soy sauce into a heatproof dish and air fry at 160°C for 5-8 minutes, checking frequently. It reduces quickly into a glaze – perfect for brushing on meats or vegetables during the last few minutes of cooking."

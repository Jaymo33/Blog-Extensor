faqQ1: "Why is 10g of flour to ounces conversion important for air fryer cooking?"
faqA1: "Precision matters in air fryer baking because cooking times are shorter and temperatures higher. Even small measurement errors can lead to dry or undercooked results. Converting 10g of flour to ounces (0.35 oz) ensures consistency, especially for coatings or batters."
faqQ2: "Can I use cups instead of grams or ounces for flour measurements?"
faqA2: "Cups are less accurate due to variations in how flour settles. For air fryer recipes, weighing flour in grams or ounces (like 10g to 0.35 oz) is best. If you must use cups, 10g is roughly 0.08 cups—but a scale is far more reliable."
faqQ3: "Does flour type affect the 10g to ounces conversion?"
faqA3: "No, the weight-to-volume ratio stays the same for all flour types. Whether it’s plain, self-raising, or wholemeal, 10g of flour equals 0.35 ounces. However, different flours absorb liquids differently, which may impact your recipe’s texture."
faqQ4: "How do I adjust air fryer recipes that list flour in ounces?"
faqA4: "Simply convert ounces to grams using the reverse calculation (1 oz = 28.35g). For example, if a recipe calls for 1 ounce of flour, use 28g. This ensures your air fryer bakes turn out perfectly every time."

<h2>Why accurate flour measurements matter</h2>

faqQ1: "Can I use volume measurements instead of weight for baking soda?"
faqA1: "While you can use tablespoons to measure baking soda, weight (grams or ounces) is far more accurate. Volume measurements can vary due to settling or packing, which may affect your recipe’s outcome. For best results, use a digital kitchen scale."
faqQ2: "Why does my air fryer recipe call for baking soda?"
faqA2: "Baking soda acts as a leavening agent, helping baked goods rise and crisp up in the air fryer. It also neutralises acidity, balances flavours, and can even aid in cleaning. Always measure carefully to avoid overuse, which can leave a metallic taste."
faqQ3: "How do I store baking soda for long-term use?"
faqA3: "Keep baking soda in an airtight container in a cool, dry place. Exposure to moisture or strong odours can reduce its effectiveness. Check its potency by mixing a small amount with vinegar—if it fizzes, it’s still active."
faqQ4: "Can I substitute baking powder for baking soda in air fryer recipes?"
faqA4: "Baking powder can work as a substitute, but it’s less potent. Use three times the amount of baking powder for the same lift. However, this may alter texture, so stick to baking soda when possible for optimal results."

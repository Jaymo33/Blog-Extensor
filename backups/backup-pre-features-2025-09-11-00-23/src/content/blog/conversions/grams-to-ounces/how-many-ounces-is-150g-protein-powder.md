faqQ1: "Is 150g of protein powder the same as 5.29 ounces in the UK?"
faqA1: "Yes, 150g of protein powder is approximately 5.29 ounces in the UK. This conversion is based on the standard metric-to-imperial measurement, where 1 gram equals roughly 0.035 ounces. For precise baking or cooking in your air fryer, weighing is always best."
faqQ2: "Can I use cups to measure 150g of protein powder instead of ounces?"
faqA2: "While you can use cups, it’s less accurate since protein powder density varies. On average, 150g is about 1.5 cups, but weighing ensures consistency. For air fryer recipes, especially baked goods, sticking to grams or ounces is recommended."
faqQ3: "Does the brand of protein powder affect the 150g to ounce conversion?"
faqA3: "Most protein powders have similar densities, so 150g will still be close to 5.29 ounces. However, flavoured or blended powders might vary slightly. Always check the packaging for specific weight guidelines if precision is crucial."
faqQ4: "How can I convert 150g of protein powder to ounces without a calculator?"
faqA4: "A quick rule of thumb is to multiply grams by 0.035 to get ounces. For 150g, that’s 150 x 0.035 = 5.25 ounces (close enough to 5.29). For air fryer cooking, rounding slightly is usually fine, but scales are ideal for exact measurements."

<h2>Why Converting 150g of Protein Powder to Ounces Matters</h2>  
<p>Accurate measurements are crucial when working with protein powder, as too much or too little can affect texture and taste. For air fryer recipes, such as protein cookies or muffins, 150g of protein powder translates to roughly 5.29 ounces. This ensures your baked goods turn out just right. Many UK recipes use grams, but if your scales measure in ounces, this conversion is a lifesaver.

<p>Protein powder is a versatile ingredient, often used in everything from pancakes to energy balls.

<h2>How to Measure 150g of Protein Powder Without Scales</h2>  
<p>If you don’t have kitchen scales, you can still measure 150g of protein powder using volume.

If you're using a particularly fluffy or dense powder, it’s always best to weigh it for accuracy. This is especially important for air fryer recipes, where consistency affects cooking times.</p>

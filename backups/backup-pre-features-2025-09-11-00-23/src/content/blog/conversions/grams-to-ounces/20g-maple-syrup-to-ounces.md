faqQ1: "Can I use volume measurements instead of weight for maple syrup?"
faqA1: "While possible, weight measurements (grams/ounces) are more accurate for maple syrup due to its varying thickness. Temperature affects viscosity – cold syrup pours more slowly, potentially skewing volume measurements like tablespoons. For air fryer recipes where precision matters, weighing 20g (0.71 oz) yields consistent results."
faqQ2: "Does the type of maple syrup affect the weight-to-volume ratio?"
faqA2: "Yes, darker Grade B syrup is slightly denser than lighter Grade A, but the difference is minimal for small quantities like 20g. In air frying applications, either grade works at 0.71 ounces – just adjust cooking times by 1-2 minutes if using darker syrup, as it caramelises faster under high heat."
faqQ3: "How should I store opened maple syrup for accurate future measurements?"
faqA3: "Refrigerate in an airtight container to maintain consistent viscosity. Before measuring 20g (0.71 oz), let chilled syrup sit at room temperature for 15 minutes. Stir gently if separation occurs. Proper storage prevents crystallisation that could alter weight measurements for air fryer recipes."
faqQ4: "Can I substitute golden syrup or honey for maple syrup in air fryer recipes?"
faqA4: "Yes, but adjust quantities slightly. Honey weighs 21g per tablespoon (vs maple syrup’s 20g), while golden syrup is closer at 19g. For 20g maple syrup to ounces (0.71 oz) conversions, reduce honey by about 5% or add 30 seconds to cooking time to account for extra browning."

<h2>Why accurate maple syrup measurements matter</h2>  
<p>Maple syrup is a sticky, dense liquid where small weight differences can significantly impact your recipe’s sweetness and texture. In air fryer cooking, where heat circulates rapidly, overly sweet glazes can burn while too little syrup might leave dishes tasting bland. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> helps eliminate guesswork for consistent outcomes.</p>  
<p>British recipes often use grams, while some older cookbooks reference ounces. When adapting <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> across measurement systems, this 20g maple syrup to ounces conversion (0.71 oz) becomes invaluable. For context, 1 UK fluid ounce of maple syrup weighs about 28g – but weight ounces (used here) differ slightly from fluid ounces.</p>  

<h3>Tools for measuring maple syrup</h3>  
<p>Digital kitchen scales are ideal for weighing 20g of maple syrup directly. If using measuring spoons, note that 1 tablespoon equals roughly 20g (0.71 oz), but viscosity varies with temperature. For sticky ingredients like maple syrup, lightly greasing your measuring spoon or cup prevents waste and ensures accuracy.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for 20g maple syrup in air fryers</h2>  
<p>This small-but-mighty quantity shines in glazes for <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>air fryer chicken</a> or roasted vegetables. It’s also perfect for sweetening a single serving of air-fried fruit or drizzling over warm desserts. At 0.71 ounces, 20g adds subtle sweetness without overpowering – ideal for balanced flavours.</p>  
<p>When substituting other sweeteners, remember honey is denser (21g per tablespoon) while agave is lighter (18g). Always adjust cooking times slightly when using syrups in air fryers, as sugars caramelise quickly under intense heat. Keep a <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner</a> handy to tackle any sticky spills promptly.</p>  

<h3>Converting larger batches</h3>

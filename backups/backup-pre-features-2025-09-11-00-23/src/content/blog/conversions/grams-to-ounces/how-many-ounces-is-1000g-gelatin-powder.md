faqQ1: "Can I use 1000g of gelatin powder in air fryer recipes?"
faqA1: "Yes, you can use 1000g of gelatin powder in air fryer recipes, but it's a large quantity typically used for batch cooking. For smaller portions, you might only need a fraction of this amount. Always measure carefully to ensure the right consistency in your dishes."
faqQ2: "How do I convert 1000g of gelatin powder to ounces without a scale?"
faqA2: "Without a scale, you can use measuring cups or spoons, but results may vary due to gelatin's density. One tablespoon of gelatin powder is roughly 7g, so 1000g would be about 143 tablespoons. However, for accuracy, we recommend using a kitchen scale."
faqQ3: "Is 1000g of gelatin powder the same as 1000ml?"
faqA3: "No, grams measure weight while millilitres measure volume. The volume of 1000g of gelatin powder depends on its density. Generally, 1000g of gelatin powder occupies less space than 1000ml of liquid, so they're not interchangeable."

faqA4: "If stored properly in an airtight container in a cool, dry place, 1000g of gelatin powder can last up to two years. Always check for clumping or off smells before use, as these can indicate spoilage. For best results, use within a year of opening."

faqQ1: "Can I use a different oil if I don't have sunflower oil?"
faqA1: "Yes, you can substitute sunflower oil with other high-smoke point oils like vegetable, canola, or peanut oil. Just keep in mind that the flavour might slightly differ, and you should use the same weight (200g or 7 ounces) for accurate results in your air fryer recipes."
faqQ2: "How do I measure 200g of sunflower oil without scales?"
faqA2: "If you don't have scales, you can use measuring cups or spoons. 200g of sunflower oil is approximately 14 tablespoons or just under 1 cup (0.85 cups to be precise). However, for the most accurate measurement, especially in air frying, investing in a digital kitchen scale is recommended."
faqQ3: "Does the type of sunflower oil affect the conversion to ounces?"
faqA3: "No, the conversion from grams to ounces remains the same regardless of whether you're using refined or unrefined sunflower oil. 200g will always equal about 7.05 ounces. The difference lies in flavour and smoke point, which might affect your cooking results but not the weight conversion."
faqQ4: "Why is sunflower oil often recommended for air fryers?"
faqA4: "Sunflower oil is ideal for air fryers because it has a high smoke point (around 230Â°C), meaning it won't burn at typical air frying temperatures. It's also neutral in flavour and contains vitamin E. When using 200g (7 ounces) in recipes, it provides just enough coating without making food greasy."

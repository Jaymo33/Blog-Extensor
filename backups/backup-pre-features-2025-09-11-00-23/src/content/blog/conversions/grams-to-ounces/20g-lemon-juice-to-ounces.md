faqQ1: "Is 20g of lemon juice the same as 20ml?"
faqA1: "No, 20g of lemon juice isn’t exactly the same as 20ml. While they’re close (about 20ml equals roughly 20.4g), weight (grams) is more accurate for cooking. The density of lemon juice means weight measurements give more consistent results in recipes."
faqQ2: "Can I use bottled lemon juice instead of fresh for my air fryer recipes?"
faqA2: "Fresh lemon juice is always preferable for the best flavour, but bottled works in a pinch. Just remember that bottled juice often contains preservatives that might slightly alter the taste. If using bottled, stick to the same 20g (0.7 oz) measurement unless the recipe specifies otherwise."
faqQ3: "How does lemon juice affect air fryer cooking times?"
faqA3: "Lemon juice itself doesn’t significantly change cooking times, but it can affect how foods brown. The acidity can lead to faster browning, so you might need to reduce temperature by about 5°C or check food a few minutes earlier when using citrus marinades."
faqQ4: "What’s the best way to store leftover lemon juice for air fryer recipes?"
faqA4: "Store leftover lemon juice in an airtight container in the fridge for up to a week. For longer storage, freeze it in ice cube trays – each cube is about 15g (0.5 oz), so you can easily measure out your 20g (about 1.5 cubes) when needed. Thaw before using in recipes."

faqQ1: "Can I use honey instead of golden syrup in air fryer recipes?"
faqA1: "Yes, honey can substitute golden syrup in a 1:1 ratio, but it has a stronger flavour. For 40g golden syrup (1.41 oz), use the same amount of honey. Adjust cooking times slightly, as honey burns faster in the air fryer."
faqQ2: "How do I clean my air fryer after using sticky golden syrup?"
faqA2: "Wipe the basket with warm, soapy water immediately after use. For stubborn residue, soak the parts in vinegar and baking soda. Avoid abrasive scrubbers to protect non-stick coatings."
faqQ3: "Does golden syrup weigh the same as sugar when converting grams to ounces?"
faqA3: "No, golden syrup is denser. While 40g of granulated sugar equals 1.41 oz, golden syrup’s sticky texture means it packs more weight per volume. Always measure by weight for accuracy."
faqQ4: "Can I freeze dishes made with 40g golden syrup?"
faqA4: "Yes, but the texture may change slightly. Thaw frozen syrupy treats in the fridge and reheat in the air fryer for 2–3 minutes to restore crispiness. Avoid freezing for longer than a month."

<h3>Common Uses for 40g Golden Syrup in Air Fryer Cooking</h3>  
<p>Golden syrup adds a caramel-like sweetness to both sweet and savoury dishes. In the air fryer, 40g (1.41 oz) can glaze roasted carrots, sweeten granola clusters, or bind energy balls. Its high sugar content also helps create crispy textures, perfect for desserts like air-fried doughnuts or sticky gingerbread.</p>  

<h3>Storing Golden Syrup for Longevity</h3>

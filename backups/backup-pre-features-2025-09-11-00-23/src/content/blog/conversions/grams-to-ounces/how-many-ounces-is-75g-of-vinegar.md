faqQ1: "Can I use any type of vinegar for the 75g to ounces conversion?"
faqA1: "Yes, the conversion applies to all vinegar types (white, apple cider, balsamic, etc.) because their densities are similar. Whether you're using malt vinegar for chips or rice vinegar for stir-fries, 75g will always equal approximately 2.65 ounces."
faqQ2: "Why is my air fryer recipe too tangy even with 75g of vinegar?"
faqA2: "This could happen if your vinegar is stronger than the recipe assumes. Some vinegars, like white wine or sherry vinegar, have higher acidity. Start with slightly less (e.g., 60g or 2.1 ounces) and adjust to taste. Always taste-test marinades before adding them to your dish."
faqQ3: "How do I measure 75g of vinegar if I only have a measuring jug?"
faqA3: "Most measuring jugs show millilitres (ml), not grams. Since vinegar’s density is close to water, 75g is roughly 75ml. Look for the ml markings on your jug and fill to the 75ml line for an accurate 75g (2.65 ounces) measure."
faqQ4: "Does heating vinegar in the air fryer change its weight?"
faqA4: "Heating reduces vinegar’s volume through evaporation, but the weight (75g) remains the same until it evaporates. If a recipe reduces vinegar (like a glaze), measure it before heating. For precise results, stick to the 75g (2.65 ounces) measurement initially."

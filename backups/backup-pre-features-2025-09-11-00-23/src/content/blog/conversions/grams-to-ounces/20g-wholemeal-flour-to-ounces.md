faqQ1: "Can I use a measuring cup instead of a scale for 20g of wholemeal flour?"
faqA1: "While a scale is more accurate, you can use a measuring cup in a pinch. Spoon the flour into the cup and level it off—20g is roughly 2 tablespoons of wholemeal flour. However, for best results in air fryer baking, a digital scale is recommended."
faqQ2: "Does wholemeal flour weigh the same as white flour in ounces?"
faqA2: "Wholemeal flour is slightly denser than white flour due to its higher fibre content, but the weight difference is minimal. 20g of wholemeal flour still converts to approximately 0.705 ounces, just like white flour."
faqQ3: "Why does my air fryer recipe call for wholemeal flour by weight?"
faqA3: "Weight measurements ensure consistency, especially in air fryer recipes where even cooking is crucial. Wholemeal flour can vary in density, so weighing it (like 20g to 0.705 ounces) guarantees the right texture and rise."
faqQ4: "Can I substitute wholemeal flour with another type of flour in air fryer recipes?"
faqA4: "Yes, but adjustments may be needed. Wholemeal flour absorbs more liquid, so if substituting with plain flour, reduce the amount slightly. For gluten-free options, a 1:1 blend often works, but check specific recipes on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> for guidance."

faqQ1: "Can I use teaspoons to measure 20g of baking powder?"
faqA1: "Yes, but it’s less precise. One teaspoon holds about 5g of baking powder, so 20g would be 4 teaspoons. For accuracy, especially in air fryer baking, scales are best."
faqQ2: "Why does my air fryer bake taste bitter with baking powder?"
faqA2: "Over-measuring baking powder can cause bitterness. Ensure you’re using exactly 20g (0.71 oz) and not more. Also, check your baking powder’s expiry date, as old product loses potency."
faqQ3: "How do I convert other gram measurements to ounces?"
faqA3: "Use a simple ratio: 1 gram ≈ 0.035 ounces. Multiply your grams by 0.035 for the ounce equivalent. Our conversion chart simplifies this for all air fryer ingredients."
faqQ4: "Does baking powder behave differently in an air fryer?"
faqA4: "The air fryer’s rapid air circulation can cause faster rising. Stick to 20g (0.71 oz) unless adjusting for altitude or recipe specifics. Always preheat for even results."

<p>20g of baking powder equals approximately 0.71 ounces. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes, where precise measurements can make or break your dish. Whether you're whipping up cakes, bread, or even savoury bakes, knowing how to convert grams to ounces ensures consistency. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we understand the importance of accuracy, especially when working with leavening agents like baking powder.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer baking</h2>  
<p>Baking powder is a crucial ingredient that affects the texture and rise of your baked goods. Too little, and your cake might turn out dense; too much, and it could taste bitter or collapse. The air fryer's intense heat amplifies these effects, making precise conversions vital. For example, if a recipe calls for 20g of baking powder, using 0.71 ounces ensures the perfect lift. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more handy measurements.</p>  

<p>Many UK bakers prefer weighing ingredients in grams, but some older recipes or international guides use ounces. Converting 20g of baking powder to ounces (0.71 oz) bridges this gap. This small but critical adjustment guarantees your air fryer bakes turn out light and fluffy every time. Whether you're making muffins or a quick bread, precision is key.</p>  

<h2>How to measure 20g of baking powder without scales</h2>  
<p>Don’t have a kitchen scale? No problem. One level tablespoon of baking powder roughly equals 15g, so 20g is just over 1.3 tablespoons. For ounces, this translates to slightly less than 0.75 oz. While this method works in a pinch, investing in digital scales ensures accuracy. Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> for dishes where exact measurements shine.</p>  

<h3>Common mistakes when converting grams to ounces</h3>  
<p>Avoid confusing fluid ounces (volume) with avoirdupois ounces (weight). Baking powder should always be measured by weight for accuracy. Also, remember that 20g of baking powder to oz is 0.71, not rounded up to 1 oz, as this small difference can impact your bake. Always double-check conversions, especially when adapting recipes for your air fryer.</p>  

<h2>Best practices for storing baking powder</h2>  
<p>To maintain its potency, store baking powder in a cool, dry place. Humidity can cause clumping, leading to inaccurate measurements. If your 20g of baking powder seems compacted, sieve it before measuring. Proper storage ensures your 0.71-ounce measurement remains consistent.

<h3>Adjusting recipes for high-altitude baking</h3>  
<p>At higher altitudes, baking powder’s effectiveness changes. You might need slightly less than 20g (0.71 oz) to prevent over-rising. Experiment with small adjustments and note the results.

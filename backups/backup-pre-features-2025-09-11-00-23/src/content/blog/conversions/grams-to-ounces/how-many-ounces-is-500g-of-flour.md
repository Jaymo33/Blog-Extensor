faqQ1: "Is 500g of flour the same as 16 ounces?"
faqA1: "No, 500g of flour equals about 17.64 ounces, not 16. While 16 ounces is roughly 454g, the extra 46g in 500g makes a noticeable difference in baking—especially in air fryer recipes where precision matters."
faqQ2: "Can I use cups instead of ounces for 500g of flour?"
faqA2: "Yes, but cups measure volume, not weight. 500g of flour is roughly 4 cups, but this can vary based on how packed the flour is. For air fryer recipes, weighing ingredients (in grams or ounces) is more reliable."
faqQ3: "Why do UK recipes use grams instead of ounces?"
faqA3: "The UK primarily uses metric measurements (grams), while ounces are more common in the US. Air fryer recipes from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> often list both, but grams offer greater precision for baking."
faqQ4: "How does flour type affect the 500g-to-ounces conversion?"
faqA4: "Flour density varies—wholemeal flour is heavier than plain flour per cup, but the weight in grams (or ounces) remains the same. For air fryer recipes, stick to weight measurements for consistent results."

faqQ1: "Can I use regular yogurt instead of Greek yogurt for 25g measurements?"
faqA1: "Yes, you can substitute regular yogurt for Greek yogurt when measuring 25g (0.88 ounces), but be aware of texture differences. Greek yogurt is thicker, so you may need to adjust other liquids in your air fryer recipe slightly. The conversion from grams to ounces remains the same regardless of yogurt type."
faqQ2: "How many tablespoons equal 25g of Greek yogurt?"
faqA2: "Approximately two level tablespoons of Greek yogurt equal 25g (0.88 ounces). For thicker Greek yogurt varieties, you might need to slightly heap the tablespoons to reach the full 25g. Using digital scales is more accurate for precise air fryer recipe measurements."
faqQ3: "Does 25g of Greek yogurt weigh the same as 25g of regular yogurt?"
faqA3: "Yes, 25g of any type of yogurt weighs 25g (0.88 ounces) by definition. However, Greek yogurt is denser, so 25g will take up less volume than regular yogurt. This density difference affects how the yogurt performs in air fryer recipes, especially for coatings and batters."
faqQ4: "How can I measure 25g Greek yogurt without scales?"
faqA4: "Without scales, use the tablespoon method: two level tablespoons equal roughly 25g (0.88 ounces) of Greek yogurt. Alternatively, a standard UK tablespoon holds about 12.5g, so two make 25g. For more precise air fryer cooking, consider investing in affordable digital kitchen scales."

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>
<p>Air fryers rely on precise ingredient ratios to achieve crispy, evenly cooked dishes. Using the correct amount of Greek yogurt, like 25g (0.88 ounces), ensures your marinades coat properly and your batters have the right consistency. Too much or too little can affect cooking times and textures.</p>

<h3>How to measure 25g of Greek yogurt accurately</h3>
<p>Use digital kitchen scales for the most precise 25g measurement. If you don’t have scales, two level tablespoons of Greek yogurt roughly equal 25g (0.88 ounces). For thicker Greek yogurt, slightly heap the tablespoons to compensate for density.</p>

<h2>Converting 25g Greek yogurt to ounces for different recipes</h2>
<p>The 25g to 0.88 ounces conversion works across all air fryer recipes. Whether you’re making <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/breakfast>breakfast muffins</a> or <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>desserts</a>, this measurement remains consistent. Remember that Greek yogurt’s thickness means volume measurements can vary slightly by brand.</p>
<p>For best results with your 25g portion, stir the yogurt first to even out consistency. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning guide</a> shows how to maintain your air fryer after yogurt-based recipes.</p>

<h3>Common uses for 25g Greek yogurt in air fryer cooking</h3>
<p>This small but mighty 25g (0.88 ounce) portion works perfectly in single-serve recipes. Use it to make tenderizing marinades for meats, creamy dips for vegetables, or as a binding agent in healthier baked goods. The protein-rich yogurt helps create crispier coatings in the air fryer.</p>

<h2>Adjusting recipes that call for 25g Greek yogurt</h2>
<p>If a recipe specifies 25g Greek yogurt (0.88 ounces) but you only have measuring cups, use the tablespoon method mentioned earlier. For larger batches requiring multiple 25g portions, scale up proportionally - 50g equals 1.76 ounces, 75g equals 2.64 ounces, and so on.</p>
<p>When substituting regular yogurt for Greek yogurt in 25g measurements, reduce other liquids slightly as Greek yogurt is thicker. Visit <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> for more conversion tips and recipe ideas.</p>

<h3>Storing leftover Greek yogurt after measuring 25g portions</h3>
<p>After measuring out your 25g (0.88 ounce) portion, store the remaining yogurt in an airtight container in the fridge. Use within 3-4 days for best quality. Greek yogurt can also be frozen in 25g portions for future air fryer recipes.</p>

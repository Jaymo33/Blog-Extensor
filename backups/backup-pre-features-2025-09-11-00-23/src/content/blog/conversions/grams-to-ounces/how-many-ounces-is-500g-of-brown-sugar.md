faqQ1: "Is 500g of brown sugar the same as 500g of white sugar in ounces?"
faqA1: "Yes, 500g of any sugar type (brown, white, caster) converts to the same weight in ouncesâ€”approximately 17.64 oz. However, brown sugar is denser when packed, so always measure by weight for accuracy in air fryer recipes."
faqQ2: "Can I use cups instead of ounces for 500g of brown sugar?"
faqA2: "While possible, cups are less precise. 500g of packed brown sugar equals about 2.5 cups. For best results in air fryer baking, use a kitchen scale to measure 17.64 ounces (500g) directly."
faqQ3: "Does UK brown sugar weigh the same as US brown sugar in ounces?"
faqA3: "Yes, 500g of UK brown sugar equals the same 17.64 ounces as US brown sugar. The main difference is often molasses content, but weight conversions remain identical for air fryer recipes."
faqQ4: "How should I store 500g of brown sugar after opening for air fryer use?"
faqA4: "Keep opened brown sugar in an airtight container to prevent hardening. For 500g batches, consider dividing into smaller portions. If it hardens, revive it with a slice of bread in the container overnight before using in your air fryer."

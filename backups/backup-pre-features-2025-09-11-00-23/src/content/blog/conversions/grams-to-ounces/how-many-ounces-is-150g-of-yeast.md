faqQ1: "Is 150g of yeast the same as 5.29 ounces?"
faqA1: "Yes, 150g of yeast is approximately 5.29 ounces. This conversion is based on the standard metric-to-imperial ratio, where 1 gram equals 0.035 ounces. For baking accuracy, always use a digital scale when possible."
faqQ2: "Can I use volume measurements instead of weight for 150g of yeast?"
faqA2: "While you can use tablespoons (about 16.5 for 150g), weight measurements are far more precise. Yeast density can vary, so weighing ensures consistency, especially in air fryer recipes where exact proportions matter."

faqA4: "No, the conversion stays the same for active dry, instant, or fresh yeast. However, substitution ratios differ—check your recipe for the correct type before measuring."

faqQ1: "Can I use American mustard instead of English mustard for 10g measurements?"
faqA1: "Yes, you can substitute American mustard for English mustard in a 10g measurement, but be aware the flavour will be milder. American mustard is smoother and less pungent, so adjust other seasonings if needed. The weight conversion (10g to 0.35 oz) remains the same regardless of mustard type."
faqQ2: "How do I measure 10g of mustard if I only have a kitchen scale in pounds?"
faqA2: "If your scale measures in pounds, 10g of mustard is roughly 0.022 lbs. Most digital scales allow you to switch between units, so check your settings. Alternatively, use the spoon method mentioned above for a quick estimate without scales."
faqQ3: "Does Dijon mustard weigh the same as yellow mustard for 10g conversions?"
faqA3: "Yes, Dijon and yellow mustard have similar densities, so 10g of either will equal 0.35 oz. However, Dijon is slightly thicker, so it may compact more in a measuring spoon. For absolute precision, use a scale."
faqQ4: "Can I freeze leftover mustard after measuring out 10g?"
faqA4: "While mustard can be frozen, its texture may change slightly upon thawing. It’s best stored in the fridge for short-term use. If you’ve measured 10g from a larger container, simply reseal it and refrigerate for up to a month."

faqQ1: "Can I use 200g of panko breadcrumbs instead of regular breadcrumbs?"
faqA1: "Yes, you can substitute regular breadcrumbs with panko, but note that panko is lighter and crispier. The same 200g (7.05 oz) measurement applies, but panko may give a flakier texture. Adjust cooking times slightly as panko browns faster in the air fryer."
faqQ2: "How do I convert 200g of breadcrumbs to cups?"
faqA2: "200g of breadcrumbs is roughly 2.5 cups, but this can vary based on how tightly packed they are. For accuracy, we recommend weighing them instead. Check our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a> for more details."
faqQ3: "Can I make my own breadcrumbs from stale bread?"
faqA3: "Absolutely! Simply blitz stale bread in a food processor until fine. 200g of fresh bread will yield slightly less once dried. Spread the crumbs on a tray and bake at 180°C for 5-10 minutes to dry them out before using in your air fryer."
faqQ4: "Why do my breadcrumbs burn in the air fryer?"
faqA4: "Breadcrumbs can burn if the air fryer temperature is too high or if they’re unevenly spread. Try lowering the temperature by 10°C and shaking the basket halfway. For more troubleshooting, see our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning and maintenance guide</a>."

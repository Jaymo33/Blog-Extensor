faqQ1: "Can I use self-raising flour instead of plain flour for 100g measurements?"
faqA1: "Yes, but self-raising flour contains baking powder, which affects the recipe’s rise. If substituting, omit any additional leavening agents. For precise results, stick to plain flour unless the recipe specifies otherwise."
faqQ2: "Why do some recipes use grams and others use ounces?"
faqA2: "Grams are the standard in the UK and Europe, while ounces are more common in the US. Always check the recipe’s origin and convert if needed. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a> makes it easy."
faqQ3: "How do I measure 100g of plain flour without scales?"
faqA3: "Use a measuring cup: 100g is roughly ¾ cup + 1 tablespoon of plain flour. For best accuracy, we recommend investing in digital scales, especially for air fryer baking."
faqQ4: "Does the type of flour affect the ounce conversion?"
faqA4: "No, 100g of any flour (plain, self-raising, or wholemeal) equals 3.53 ounces. However, different flours have varying densities, so always weigh for precision in air fryer recipes."

<p>100g of plain flour equals approximately 3.53 ounces. This conversion is essential for air fryer baking, where precise measurements can make or break your recipe.

<h2>Why accurate flour measurements matter</h2>  
<p>Using the correct amount of flour is crucial in air fryer baking. Too much flour can make your baked goods dense, while too little can leave them crumbly. For example, if a recipe calls for 100g of plain flour and you use the wrong ounce equivalent, your cake might not rise properly. That’s why knowing that 100g of plain flour is 3.53 ounces is so helpful.

<p>Many UK recipes use grams, but if you’re working with an older cookbook or an international recipe, ounces might be the default. Converting 100g of plain flour to ounces ensures you’re following the recipe correctly. This is especially important for air fryer recipes, where precision affects cooking time and texture. Whether you’re making <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>cakes</a> or bread, getting the flour right is key.</p>  

<h3>How to measure 100g of plain flour without scales</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a kitchen scale, you can still measure 100g of plain flour using cups or spoons. One cup of plain flour is roughly 120g, so 100g would be just under a cup. However, this method isn’t as precise as weighing, so for best results, we recommend using scales.

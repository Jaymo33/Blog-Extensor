faqQ1: "How do I convert 500g of chopped garlic to ounces without a scale?"
faqA1: "If you don’t have a scale, remember that 500g of chopped garlic is roughly 17.64 ounces. One medium garlic clove weighs about 3g, so you’d need around 167 cloves to reach 500g. However, this method isn’t as precise as weighing, so a kitchen scale is recommended for accuracy."
faqQ2: "Can I use minced garlic instead of chopped garlic in air fryer recipes?"
faqA2: "Yes, minced garlic can substitute chopped garlic, but the texture and intensity may differ. Minced garlic is finer, so you might need slightly less to match the flavour of 500g (17.64 oz) of chopped garlic. Adjust quantities based on taste preferences."
faqQ3: "How long does 500g of chopped garlic last in the fridge?"
faqA3: "Stored in an airtight container, 500g of chopped garlic stays fresh for up to a week in the fridge. For longer storage, freeze it in portions. Garlic may lose some potency over time, so use it within a month for best results."
faqQ4: "What’s the best way to chop garlic for air fryer recipes?"
faqA4: "For even cooking, finely chop garlic to ensure it distributes evenly in your air fryer dishes. A sharp knife or garlic press works well. Avoid large chunks, as they may burn or cook unevenly in the air fryer’s high heat."

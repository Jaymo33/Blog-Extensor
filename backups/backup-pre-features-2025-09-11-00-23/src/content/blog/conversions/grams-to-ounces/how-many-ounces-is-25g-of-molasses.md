faqQ1: "Can I use volume measurements instead of weight for molasses?"
faqA1: "While possible, weight measurements (like 25g or 0.88 oz) are more accurate for molasses due to its thickness. Volume measures can vary based on how you pour it. For consistent results in air fryer recipes, weighing is best."
faqQ2: "Does the type of molasses affect the 25g to ounces conversion?"
faqA2: "No, the conversion remains the same (25g = 0.88 oz) whether using light, dark, or blackstrap molasses. However, flavour intensity varies, so adjust recipes accordingly. Check our conversion chart for other ingredients."
faqQ3: "How do I measure 25g of molasses without making a mess?"
faqA3: "Lightly coat your measuring spoon or cup with oil first—this helps the molasses slide out easily. Alternatively, use disposable parchment paper on your scales for quick cleanup. Our cleaning guide has more sticky-solution tips."
faqQ4: "Why is 25g of molasses a common measurement in recipes?"
faqA4: "25g (about 0.88 oz) is a convenient small quantity for glazes, marinades, or single batches of cookies. It’s enough to add flavour without overwhelming dishes. For larger batches, scale up proportionally using our conversion tools."

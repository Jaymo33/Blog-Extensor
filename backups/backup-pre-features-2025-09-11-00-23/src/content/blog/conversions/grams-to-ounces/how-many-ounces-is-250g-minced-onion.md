faqQ1: "Can I use dried minced onion instead of fresh for air fryer recipes?"
faqA1: "Yes, dried minced onion works in air fryer recipes, but use about one-third the amount since it’s more concentrated. For 250g (8.82 ounces) of fresh minced onion, substitute with roughly 83g (2.94 ounces) of dried. Rehydrate it briefly in water before adding to your dish for better texture."
faqQ2: "How do I mince onions evenly for air fryer cooking?"
faqA2: "For uniform pieces, slice the onion first, then dice it finely. A sharp knife or food processor on pulse mode works best. Evenly minced onions cook uniformly in the air fryer, preventing some pieces from burning while others remain undercooked."
faqQ3: "Does 250g of minced onion change weight when cooked in the air fryer?"
faqA3: "Yes, minced onion loses moisture and reduces in weight when air-fried. 250g (8.82 ounces) of raw minced onion may shrink to about 150g (5.29 ounces) after cooking, depending on time and temperature. Adjust recipes accordingly if using pre-cooked onions."
faqQ4: "What’s the best air fryer temperature for cooking dishes with minced onion?"
faqA4: "Most recipes with minced onion work well at 180°C (350°F). This temperature caramelises the onions without burning them. For crispy toppings or stuffed dishes, a quick 2–3 minute blast at 200°C (390°F) adds perfect texture. Always check your specific recipe for guidance."

<p>250g of minced onion equals approximately 8.82 ounces. Whether you're prepping for an air fryer recipe or just need precise measurements, this conversion ensures your dish turns out perfectly. Minced onion is a staple in many recipes, from hearty stews to crispy air-fried snacks, so getting the measurement right is key.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on precise ingredient ratios to deliver even cooking and perfect textures. Too much or too little minced onion can alter the flavour and texture of your dish. For example, if you're making air-fried onion rings or a savoury stuffing, 250g of minced onion (or 8.82 ounces) ensures consistency. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more handy measurement tips.</p>  

<p>Many UK cooks prefer weighing ingredients in grams, but some recipes, especially older or American ones, use ounces. Knowing how to convert between the two saves time and avoids kitchen mishaps. Whether you're following a classic recipe or experimenting with new ideas, accurate measurements make all the difference.</p>  

<h3>How to measure minced onion correctly</h3>  
<p>For the best results, use a digital kitchen scale to weigh your minced onion. Scoop the onion into a bowl on the scale until it hits 250g (or 8.82 ounces). If you don’t have a scale, loosely packed minced onion fills about 2.5 US cups, but weighing is far more precise. Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a> for dishes that make the most of this versatile ingredient.</p>

<p>Minced onion adds depth to countless air fryer dishes, from meatloaves to veggie patties. A 250g portion (8.82 ounces) is ideal for larger batches, like family-sized meals or meal prep. Try it in air-fried kebabs, stuffed mushrooms, or even as a topping for loaded fries. The possibilities are endless!</p>  

<p>If you're cooking for one, you might not need the full 250g. Simply halve or quarter the amount, converting to 4.41 or 2.2 ounces accordingly.

faqQ1: "Can I use a tablespoon to measure 5g of condensed milk?"
faqA1: "While 5g is roughly half a tablespoon, condensed milk's thickness makes volume measurements less accurate. For precision, especially in air fryer recipes, a digital scale is best. If you must use a spoon, lightly level it off to avoid excess."
faqQ2: "Why do some recipes use grams and others use ounces for condensed milk?"
faqA2: "Grams are standard in the UK and Europe for their precision, while ounces are more common in older cookbooks or US recipes. Air fryer recipes often use grams because small quantities (like 5g) are easier to measure accurately."
faqQ3: "How does 5g of condensed milk affect an air fryer recipe’s texture?"
faqA3: "Even 5g (0.18 oz) can add moisture and sweetness, ideal for glazes or brushed toppings. Too much may make baked goods overly sticky, so stick to the recipe’s measurements unless adjusting deliberately."
faqQ4: "Where can I find more air fryer recipes using small amounts of condensed milk?"
faqA4: "Explore <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert recipes</a> on our site, where condensed milk often features in modest quantities. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a> also helps scale measurements up or down."

<p>5 grams of condensed milk equals approximately 0.18 ounces. This conversion is handy for air fryer recipes where precise measurements matter, especially when making desserts or sweet glazes. Whether you're scaling a recipe or just need a small amount, knowing how to convert grams to ounces ensures accuracy.</p>  

<h2>Why Convert 5g of Condensed Milk to Ounces?</h2>  
<p>Many UK recipes, especially those for air fryers, list ingredients in grams, but some kitchen scales or older cookbooks might use ounces. Converting 5g of condensed milk to ounces (0.18 oz) helps avoid measurement mishaps. This is particularly useful for air fryer bakes, where even small discrepancies can affect texture and sweetness.</p>  
<p>Condensed milk is a staple in treats like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>air fryer desserts</a>, from fudgy brownies to sticky toffee puddings. If you're working with a recipe from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, you might need this conversion to adjust portion sizes or tweak sweetness levels. Always measure carefully for the best results.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure 5g of Condensed Milk Accurately</h3>  
<p>For small amounts like 5g (0.18 oz), use a digital kitchen scale set to grams for precision. If your scale only shows ounces, multiply grams by 0.035 to get the equivalent. Alternatively, 5g is roughly half a tablespoon, but weighing is more reliable for sticky ingredients like condensed milk.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for 5g of Condensed Milk in Air Fryers</h2>  
<p>Though 5g seems like a tiny amount, it’s perfect for drizzling over <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>air fryer cakes</a> or mixing into glazes. A little goes a long way with condensed milk, adding richness without overpowering other flavours. It’s also great for brushing onto pastries before air frying for a glossy finish.</p>

<h3>Tips for Storing and Handling Condensed Milk</h3>  
<p>After measuring out 5g, store the rest in an airtight container in the fridge. Condensed milk thickens when chilled, so let it sit at room temperature before your next use.

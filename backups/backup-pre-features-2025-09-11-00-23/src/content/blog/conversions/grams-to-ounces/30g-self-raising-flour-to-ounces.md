faqQ1: "Can I use plain flour instead of self-raising flour in a 30g measurement?"
faqA1: "Yes, but you'll need to add raising agents. For every 30g of plain flour, add ¾ teaspoon of baking powder to make it self-raising. The ounce measurement stays the same (1.06 oz), but the leavening action will differ without adjustment."
faqQ2: "How do I measure 30g of self-raising flour without scales?"
faqA2: "Use tablespoons – 30g is approximately 4 slightly rounded tablespoons. Spoon the flour into the tablespoon and level it off for accuracy. Remember this equals about 1.06 ounces if your recipe uses imperial measurements."
faqQ3: "Does 30g of self-raising flour weigh the same as 30g of plain flour?"
faqA3: "Yes, by weight they're identical (both 30g or 1.06 oz), but self-raising flour contains baking powder. The added raising agent affects volume and performance in recipes, not the basic weight conversion."
faqQ4: "Why does my air fryer baking need precise 30g flour measurements?"
faqA4: "Air fryers have compact cooking spaces where small measurement errors are magnified. Precise 30g (1.06 oz) portions ensure even cooking and proper rise. Too much flour can block air circulation, while too little may cause collapsing."

<p>30g of self-raising flour equals approximately 1.06 ounces. Whether you're baking cakes, biscuits, or air fryer-friendly treats, getting your measurements right is key to perfect results. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we know how important accurate conversions are for home bakers. This guide will help you nail the conversion every time.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate flour measurements matter</h2>  
<p>Baking is a science, and even small measurement errors can affect texture and rise. Self-raising flour contains a raising agent, so precision ensures your bakes turn out light and fluffy. If you're using an air fryer for baking, like in our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer cake recipes</a>, correct flour quantities are even more crucial due to the compact cooking space. Too much flour can lead to dense results, while too little may cause collapsing.</p>  

<p>Digital scales are the most accurate way to measure flour, but if you only have measuring cups or need ounces, conversions come in handy. Remember that 30g of self-raising flour to ounces is roughly 1.06 oz. For larger batches, you can scale this up proportionally – 60g would be 2.12 oz, and so on.</p>  

<h2>Converting 30g self-raising flour to ounces</h2>  
<p>The exact conversion of 30 grams of self-raising flour to ounces is 1.058 oz, but for practical purposes, 1.06 oz is close enough. This conversion applies to all types of self-raising flour, whether store-bought or homemade. If you're adapting recipes from our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>, this measurement will help you adjust quantities correctly.</p>  

<h3>Measuring without scales</h3>  
<p>If you don't have digital scales, 30g of self-raising flour is about 4 slightly rounded tablespoons. However, this can vary based on how you scoop the flour. For best results, spoon the flour into the tablespoon and level it off with a knife. This method gives you a more accurate 30g self-raising flour to ounces equivalent than scooping directly from the bag.</p>  

<h2>Using 30g of self-raising flour in air fryer recipes</h2>  
<p>Many small-batch air fryer recipes call for around 30g of self-raising flour. This quantity is perfect for single-serving cakes or a small batch of scones. When using your air fryer, remember that it cooks faster than a conventional oven, so check our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>air fryer cake recipes</a> for timing adjustments. The 30g self-raising flour in ounces measurement works perfectly for these smaller portions.</p>  

<p>For cleaning up after floury baking sessions in your air fryer, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaning guide</a> has handy tips. Keeping your air fryer basket clean ensures even cooking and prevents flavour transfer between different recipes. Whether you're measuring 30g of self-raising flour or larger quantities, starting with clean equipment gives you the best results.</p>  

<h3>Common uses for 30g portions</h3>  
<p>Thirty grams of self-raising flour is ideal for coating small portions of food before air frying. It's enough to lightly coat chicken pieces or vegetables for a crispy texture. When converting 30 grams of self-raising flour to ounces for coating, the 1.06 oz measurement helps maintain the right flour-to-liquid ratio in batters.</p>

faqQ1: "Can I use honey instead of maple syrup in air fryer recipes?"
faqA1: "Yes, honey can substitute maple syrup in most air fryer recipes, but adjust the quantity. Honey is slightly denser, so 100g of honey equals about 3.4 ounces. Reduce cooking time slightly, as honey caramelises faster than maple syrup."
faqQ2: "How do I convert 100g of maple syrup to cups?"
faqA2: "100g of maple syrup is roughly 1/3 cup, but weight measurements are more accurate. Syrup’s thickness means cup measurements can vary. For precision, use a kitchen scale or refer to our conversion chart at <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>."
faqQ3: "Does the type of maple syrup affect the weight conversion?"
faqA3: "All pure maple syrups (Grade A or B) have similar densities, so 100g will always be about 3.53 ounces. Imitation syrups may differ slightly due to added ingredients, but the difference is minimal for most recipes."
faqQ4: "Why does my maple syrup glaze burn in the air fryer?"
faqA4: "Maple syrup burns at high temperatures. If your glaze chars, try reducing the air fryer temperature by 10°C and cooking for slightly longer. Alternatively, brush the syrup on midway through cooking for even caramelisation."

<p>100g of maple syrup equals approximately 3.53 ounces. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements can make or break your dish. Whether you're drizzling it over air-fried pancakes or using it as a glaze for meats, knowing the exact weight ensures consistency. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we provide accurate conversions to help you nail every recipe.

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on precise cooking times and temperatures, and ingredient measurements are just as crucial. Using too much or too little maple syrup can affect texture, caramelisation, and overall flavour. For example, a glaze with 100g of maple syrup (3.53 ounces) will coat evenly, while an incorrect amount might burn or underwhelm. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> simplifies these calculations. Stick to the right measurements, and your dishes will turn out perfectly every time.</p>

<p>Maple syrup is a versatile ingredient in air fryer recipes, from sweet treats like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>desserts</a> to savoury glazes for meats. Its thickness means weight conversions are more reliable than volume measurements. A kitchen scale is your best friend here, ensuring you get exactly 3.53 ounces for 100g. If you’re working without one, our guide below offers practical alternatives. Consistency is key, especially when replicating recipes from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>our collection</a>.</p>

<h3>How to measure 100g of maple syrup without a scale</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a kitchen scale, you can still measure 100g of maple syrup (3.53 ounces) using tablespoons. One tablespoon of maple syrup weighs roughly 20g, so five tablespoons will get you close to 100g. Remember, viscosity varies slightly between brands, so this method isn’t exact but works in a pinch. For sticky ingredients like syrup, lightly greasing your measuring spoon helps it slide off cleanly.

<h2>Common uses for 100g of maple syrup in air fryer recipes</h2>  
<p>100g of maple syrup (3.53 ounces) is a popular quantity for many air fryer recipes. It’s enough to glaze a batch of air-fried chicken wings or sweeten a tray of roasted vegetables.

<h3>Storing maple syrup for air fryer cooking</h3>  
<p>Once opened, maple syrup should be refrigerated to maintain freshness. If your recipe calls for 100g (3.53 ounces), warm the syrup slightly for easier pouring. Microwaving it for 10-15 seconds thins it without altering the weight. Always reseal the bottle tightly to prevent crystallization. Proper storage ensures your syrup stays ready for impromptu air fryer creations, from desserts to savoury dishes.</p>

faqQ1: "Is 100g of cream the same as 100ml?"
faqA1: "No, 100g of cream is not the same as 100ml. Cream is denser than water, so 100g of cream equals roughly 97ml. Always weigh cream for accuracy in recipes, especially in air fryer cooking where precision matters."
faqQ2: "Can I use whipped cream instead of liquid cream in air fryer recipes?"
faqA2: "Whipped cream isn’t ideal for cooking as it contains added air and stabilisers. Stick to liquid cream for sauces and baked goods in the air fryer. For desserts, fold whipped cream in after cooking for best results."
faqQ3: "How do I convert other cream measurements to ounces?"
faqA3: "Use a simple conversion ratio: 1g of cream equals 0.035 ounces. For example, 200g of cream would be 7.05 ounces. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a> makes this easy for all ingredients."
faqQ4: "Does the type of cream affect the weight-to-ounce conversion?"
faqA4: "The conversion (100g = 3.53 oz) applies to all cream types, including single, double, or whipping cream. However, thicker creams may measure slightly differently by volume, so always weigh for accuracy."

faqQ1: "Can I use cups instead of grams or ounces for 30g of plain flour?"
faqA1: "Yes, but measuring cups are less precise. 30g of plain flour is roughly ¼ cup, but this can vary based on how you scoop the flour. For air fryer recipes where precision matters, weighing is best."
faqQ2: "Why do UK recipes often use grams instead of ounces?"
faqA2: "The UK primarily uses the metric system, so grams are standard for baking accuracy. Ounces are more common in the US, but many scales display both. Always check your recipe’s origin for clarity."
faqQ3: "Does sifted flour weigh the same as unsifted flour?"
faqA3: "No, sifted flour is lighter and fluffier, so 30g of sifted plain flour will take up more volume than unsifted. For consistent results, measure after sifting if the recipe specifies."
faqQ4: "How do I convert 30g of plain flour to ounces for gluten-free flour?"
faqA4: "The weight-to-ounce conversion remains the same (30g = 1.06 oz), but gluten-free flours behave differently in recipes. Adjust liquids or binders as needed for air fryer baking."

<p>30g of plain flour equals approximately 1.06 ounces. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements can make or break your dish. Whether you're baking air fryer cookies or coating chicken, knowing how to convert grams to ounces ensures consistency.

<h2>Why accurate flour measurements matter</h2>  
<p>Using the correct amount of plain flour is crucial for air fryer recipes. Too much flour can make baked goods dense, while too little may cause them to crumble. For example, if a recipe calls for 30g of plain flour and you use 1.5 ounces instead of 1.06, the texture could be off. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> helps avoid these mistakes by providing quick reference points for common measurements.</p>  

<p>Many UK bakers prefer weighing ingredients like plain flour in grams for accuracy. However, some older recipes or international sources may list ounces. Converting 30g of plain flour to ounces ensures you follow the recipe correctly, whether you're making air fryer cakes or breaded dishes. A digital kitchen scale is the best tool for this, but our guide offers a handy alternative.</p>  

<h2>How to measure 30g of plain flour without scales</h2>  
<p>If you don’t have scales, you can still measure 30g of plain flour (about 1.06 ounces) using tablespoons. One level UK tablespoon holds roughly 7.5g of plain flour, so four tablespoons equal approximately 30g. However, this method isn’t as precise as weighing, especially for delicate recipes like air fryer soufflés or pastries. For best results, we recommend investing in a digital scale.</p>

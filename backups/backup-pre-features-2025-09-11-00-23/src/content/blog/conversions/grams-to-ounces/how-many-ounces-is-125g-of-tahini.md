faqQ1: "Can I use cups instead of grams or ounces to measure tahini?"
faqA1: "While it’s possible, measuring tahini by volume (cups) is less accurate due to its thick consistency. Grams or ounces are preferred for precision. If you must use cups, 125g of tahini is roughly ½ cup, but stirring it well first is essential."
faqQ2: "Does the brand of tahini affect the weight conversion?"
faqA2: "No, 125g of tahini will always equal 4.41 ounces regardless of the brand. However, some brands may have a thicker or runnier consistency, so stirring before measuring ensures accuracy."
faqQ3: "How long does 125g of tahini last once opened?"
faqA3: "Opened tahini lasts about 3-6 months if stored properly. Keep it tightly sealed in a cool, dark place and stir before each use to prevent separation. Refrigeration can extend its shelf life further."
faqQ4: "Can I substitute another nut butter for tahini in air fryer recipes?"
faqA4: "Yes, almond or peanut butter can work in a pinch, but the flavour will differ. Tahini has a distinct nutty, slightly bitter taste that’s hard to replicate. For authentic results, stick to tahini when possible."

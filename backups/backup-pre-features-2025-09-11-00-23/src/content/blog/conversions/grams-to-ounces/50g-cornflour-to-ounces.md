faqQ1: "Is 50g of cornflour the same as 50g of plain flour in ounces?"
faqA1: "No, 50g of any ingredient equals 1.76 ounces by weight, but their volumes differ. Cornflour is finer and lighter than plain flour, so it takes up more space per gram. Always measure by weight for accuracy in air fryer recipes."
faqQ2: "Can I use tablespoons to measure 50g of cornflour?"
faqA2: "Yes, but it’s less precise. Approximately 6 level tablespoons make 50g of cornflour (1.76 oz). For best results, use a scale—especially in air fryer recipes where coating thickness affects crispiness."
faqQ3: "Why do some UK recipes use grams and others use ounces?"
faqA3: "The UK uses both metric (grams) and imperial (ounces) measurements. Grams are more common in baking for precision, while ounces appear in older recipes. Our conversion tools at airfryerrecipe.co.uk help bridge the gap."
faqQ4: "How does 50g of cornflour affect air fryer cooking times?"
faqA4: "Cornflour coatings cook faster than heavier batters, so reduce cooking time by 1–2 minutes. Always check food early—excess cornflour can burn. For perfect timing, refer to our recipe-specific guides."

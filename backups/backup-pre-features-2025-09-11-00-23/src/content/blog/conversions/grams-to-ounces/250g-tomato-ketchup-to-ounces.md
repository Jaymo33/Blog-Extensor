faqQ1: "Can I use fluid ounces to measure 250g of tomato ketchup?"
faqA1: "Fluid ounces measure volume, not weight, so they aren’t ideal for converting 250g of tomato ketchup. Since ketchup’s density can vary, weighing it in grams or ounces (weight) is more accurate for air fryer recipes."
faqQ2: "How many servings does 250g of tomato ketchup provide?"
faqA2: "250g (8.82 ounces) of tomato ketchup serves about 10-12 portions if used as a dip or glaze. For larger dishes like BBQ sauces, it may cover 4-6 servings depending on the recipe."
faqQ3: "Is 250g of tomato ketchup the same as 250ml?"
faqA3: "No, 250g measures weight, while 250ml measures volume. Tomato ketchup is denser than water, so 250ml would weigh slightly more than 250g. Always check your recipe’s requirements."
faqQ4: "What’s the best way to store leftover tomato ketchup after measuring 250g?"
faqA4: "Store unused ketchup in an airtight container in the fridge for up to a month. If you’ve opened a new bottle, ensure the cap is tightly sealed to maintain freshness for future air fryer recipes."

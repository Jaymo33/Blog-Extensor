faqQ1: "Can I use 30g of plant-based milk instead of dairy milk in air fryer recipes?"
faqA1: "Yes, plant-based milk like almond, oat, or soy can replace dairy milk in a 1:1 ratio for most air fryer recipes. Since 30g of any liquid milk is approximately 1.06 ounces, the conversion remains the same. Just note that flavour and texture may vary slightly."
faqQ2: "Why do some air fryer recipes list milk in grams instead of millilitres?"
faqA2: "Grams are often used for precision, especially in baking, as weight measurements are more accurate than volume. Since 30g of milk is roughly 30ml, you can use either, but scales eliminate measuring errors. Air fryer recipes benefit from exact quantities for consistent results."
faqQ3: "How do I measure 30g of milk if I only have US measuring cups?"
faqA3: "US cups measure volume, not weight. For 30g (1.06 oz) of milk, use 2 tablespoons or just under 1/8 of a US cup. For accuracy, consider investing in a kitchen scale—especially for air fryer recipes where precision matters."
faqQ4: "Does evaporated milk weigh the same as regular milk for 30g conversions?"
faqA4: "No, evaporated milk is denser due to reduced water content. For 30g of evaporated milk, the volume will be less than regular milk. Check the packaging for specific weight-to-volume conversions or use a scale for accuracy in air fryer recipes."

<p>30g of milk equals approximately 1.06 ounces. This conversion is handy when following air fryer recipes that require precise measurements, especially for baking or creamy sauces. Whether you're whipping up a dessert or a savoury dish, knowing how to convert grams to ounces ensures accuracy.</p>  

<h2>Why Convert 30g of Milk to Ounces?</h2>  
<p>Many UK recipes, especially those for air fryers, list ingredients in grams, while some kitchen scales or measuring cups use ounces. Converting 30g of milk to ounces (1.06 oz) helps avoid guesswork and guarantees consistency. If you're making a creamy <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer mac and cheese</a>, precise measurements matter for the perfect texture.</p>  

<p>Air fryer cooking relies on exact quantities to ensure even cooking and avoid soggy or dry results.

<h3>How to Measure 30g of Milk Without Scales</h3>  
<p>If you don't have a scale, you can use a measuring spoon or cup to approximate 30g of milk. One tablespoon holds about 15g, so two tablespoons will get you close to 30g (roughly 1.06 oz). For liquid measurements, a standard UK metric measuring cup has millilitre markings—30g of milk is roughly 30ml, as milk's density is close to water.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for 30g of Milk in Air Fryer Recipes</h2>  
<p>30g of milk (1.06 oz) is often used in small-batch air fryer recipes, such as single-serve pancakes, batters, or creamy sauces. For example, a <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/breakfast>breakfast</a> recipe might call for 30g of milk to create a light batter for French toast or muffins. Precision ensures your dish turns out fluffy and well-balanced.</p>  

<p>Another great use is in marinades or glazes—30g of milk can help tenderise chicken or add richness to a glaze for <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/potatoes>roasted potatoes</a>. Since air fryers cook quickly, exact measurements prevent over-reducing liquids or uneven coating.

<h3>Does Milk Type Affect the Weight-to-Ounce Conversion?</h3>  
<p>While skim, semi-skimmed, and whole milk have slightly different densities, the difference is negligible for small quantities like 30g. Whether you're using plant-based or dairy milk, 30g will still be roughly 1.06 ounces. However, thicker liquids like condensed milk require a different conversion due to higher density.</p>

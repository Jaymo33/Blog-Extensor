faqQ1: "Can I use cups instead of ounces for 200g of plain flour?"
faqA1: "Yes, but cups are less precise. 200g of plain flour is roughly 1.6 cups, but this can vary based on how the flour is packed. For consistent results in air fryer baking, weighing with scales is best."
faqQ2: "Does the type of flour affect the conversion from grams to ounces?"
faqA2: "Slightly. Plain flour, self-raising flour, and wholemeal flour have similar densities, but small variations exist. Always use the specific type of flour your recipe calls for when converting 200g to ounces."
faqQ3: "Why do UK recipes use grams instead of ounces?"
faqA3: "The UK primarily uses metric measurements (grams), while ounces are more common in the US. For air fryer recipes, grams offer greater precision, making them the preferred choice for consistent baking results."
faqQ4: "How do I store plain flour to keep it fresh for air fryer recipes?"
faqA4: "Store plain flour in an airtight container in a cool, dry place. This prevents moisture absorption and keeps it fresh for longer. Proper storage ensures your 200g measurements remain accurate for all your air fryer bakes."

<h2>Why accurate flour measurements matter</h2>  
<p>Baking is a science, and even small deviations in flour weight can affect texture and rise. Using 200g of plain flour (7.05 oz) ensures consistency, especially in air fryer baking where heat distribution is rapid. Too much flour can make baked goods dense, while too little may cause them to crumble. For foolproof results, always weigh your ingredients.

<p>Many UK recipes use grams, but some older cookbooks or international sources list ounces. Knowing that 200g of plain flour is 7.05 oz helps bridge the gap. This is particularly useful for air fryer recipes, where precision ensures even cooking. If you’re new to air fryer baking, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>cake recipes</a> are a great place to start.</p>  

<h3>How to measure 200g of plain flour without scales</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have scales, you can use the spoon-and-level method. Lightly spoon flour into a measuring cup and level it off with a knife. However, this method is less accurate than weighing, as 200g of plain flour can vary in volume depending on how it’s packed. For best results, invest in digital scales—they’re a game-changer for air fryer baking.</p>  

<h2>Converting other flour amounts</h2>  
<p>Need to convert a different amount? Here’s a quick reference: 100g of plain flour is 3.53 oz, and 250g is 8.82 oz. These conversions are handy for scaling recipes up or down.

<p>Remember, plain flour (all-purpose flour) has a different weight-to-volume ratio than self-raising or wholemeal flour. Always check the type of flour specified in your recipe. If you’re adapting recipes for the air fryer, precise measurements like 200g to 7.05 oz ensure success.

<h3>Common mistakes when measuring flour</h3>  
<p>Scooping flour directly from the bag compacts it, leading to more than 200g per cup. Always fluff the flour first, then spoon it into your measuring tool. For air fryer recipes, even small errors can affect cooking times and textures. Stick to weight measurements for reliability, especially when converting 200g of plain flour to ounces.</p>

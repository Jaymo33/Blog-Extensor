<h2>Why accurate garlic measurements matter</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of crushed garlic can elevate your air fryer dishes from good to great. Too little, and the flavour falls flat; too much, and it overpowers the meal. Garlic’s intensity varies based on how finely it’s crushed, so weight is more reliable than volume. If you love garlic-heavy recipes like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>garlic butter chicken</a>, precise measurements are key. Always use a digital scale for the best results.</p>  

<p>Crushed garlic also releases more flavour than whole cloves, meaning 30g packs a punch. This measurement is common in UK recipes, so converting to ounces helps if your scale uses imperial units.

<h3>How to measure 30g of crushed garlic</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a scale, 30g of crushed garlic is roughly two heaped tablespoons. However, this can vary based on how tightly packed the garlic is. For consistent results, invest in a kitchen scale—it’s a game-changer for air fryer cooking. Cleaning garlic residue from your air fryer?

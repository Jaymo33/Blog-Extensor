faqQ1: "Can I use fluid ounces to measure 100g of condensed milk?"
faqA1: "Fluid ounces measure volume, not weight, so they’re not ideal for condensed milk. Since condensed milk is thick and dense, 100g (3.53 oz by weight) won’t match fluid ounce measurements. For accuracy, use a kitchen scale or the tablespoon method mentioned above."
faqQ2: "How does 100g of condensed milk compare to evaporated milk in ounces?"
faqA2: "Evaporated milk is lighter and less viscous. While 100g of condensed milk equals 3.53 oz, the same weight of evaporated milk is closer to 3.8 oz due to lower sugar content. Always check your recipe’s requirements, as they aren’t interchangeable."
faqQ3: "Why do some recipes list condensed milk in grams and others in ounces?"
faqA3: "Recipes vary by region—UK and European recipes typically use grams, while older or American recipes may use ounces. Converting 100g to 3.53 oz ensures consistency. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a> simplifies this for air fryer cooking."
faqQ4: "Can I substitute sweetened condensed milk with regular milk in air fryer recipes?"
faqA4: "No, they’re not interchangeable. Condensed milk is reduced and sweetened, adding texture and flavour. For 100g (3.53 oz), substituting regular milk would require adjusting sugar and cooking time. Stick to the recipe or find alternatives in our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert section</a>."

<h2>Why Convert 100g of Condensed Milk to Ounces?</h2>

<h3>How to Measure 100g of Condensed Milk Without Scales</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have scales, you can use volume measurements. Roughly 100g of condensed milk is about 5 tablespoons or ¼ cup plus 1 tablespoon. However, weighing is more accurate, especially for air fryer recipes where precision matters. For sticky ingredients like condensed milk, lightly greasing your measuring spoon helps it slide off easily.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for 100g of Condensed Milk in Air Fryer Recipes</h2>  
<p>Condensed milk adds richness to air fryer desserts like cheesecakes, cookies, or even dulce de leche. A 100g portion (3.53 oz) is perfect for small-batch recipes. Try it in our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer caramel drizzle</a> or as a sweetener for air-fried bananas. Its thick consistency also works well in no-bake treats.</p>  

<p>For savoury dishes, condensed milk can balance spices in marinades or glazes. If you’re experimenting, start with 100g (3.53 oz) and adjust to taste. Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert category</a> for more inspiration.</p>  

<h3>Tips for Storing Leftover Condensed Milk</h3>  
<p>Once opened, transfer unused condensed milk to an airtight container and refrigerate. It lasts up to two weeks. For longer storage, freeze portions in ice cube trays—each cube is roughly 25g (0.88 oz), so four cubes make 100g. Thaw in the fridge before using.</p>

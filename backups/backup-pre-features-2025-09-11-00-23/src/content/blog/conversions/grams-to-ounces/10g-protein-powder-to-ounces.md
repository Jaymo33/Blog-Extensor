faqQ1: "Can I use a tablespoon to measure 10g of protein powder?"
faqA1: "Yes, one level tablespoon typically holds around 10g (0.35 oz) of protein powder. However, densities vary by brand, so check the packaging for exact measurements. For air fryer recipes, consistency matters—use a scale if possible."
faqQ2: "Why do some recipes use ounces instead of grams for protein powder?"
faqA2: "Ounces are commonly used in older UK recipes and some fitness guides. Converting 10g to ounces (0.35 oz) ensures compatibility with these recipes. Air fryer cooking often follows traditional measurements, so knowing both units helps."
faqQ3: "Does 10g of plant-based protein powder weigh the same as whey?"
faqA3: "Most plant-based and whey powders weigh similarly—10g equals roughly 0.35 oz. However, some plant proteins are fluffier, so spooning lightly helps. For air fryer recipes, stick to one type for consistent results."
faqQ4: "How do I convert 10g of protein powder to cups?"
faqA4: "10g of protein powder is about 0.08 cups (or roughly 1.5 tablespoons). Cups aren’t ideal for powders due to settling, so grams or ounces are more accurate. For air fryer baking, weigh ingredients for best results."

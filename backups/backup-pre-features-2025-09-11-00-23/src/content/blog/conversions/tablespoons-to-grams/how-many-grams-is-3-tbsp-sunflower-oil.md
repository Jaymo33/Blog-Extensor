faqQ1: "Can I use other oils instead of sunflower oil in my air fryer?"
faqA1: "Yes, you can use oils like olive, rapeseed, or avocado oil, but be mindful of their smoke points. Sunflower oil has a high smoke point (around 225°C), making it ideal for air frying. Always adjust quantities based on density differences."
faqQ2: "Why does my air fryer recipe specify grams instead of tablespoons?"
faqA2: "Grams provide more accuracy, especially when scaling recipes. Tablespoons can vary slightly in volume, while weight measurements ensure consistency. This is crucial for air frying, where even cooking relies on precise ingredient ratios."
faqQ3: "How do I convert grams back to tablespoons if needed?"
faqA3: "Divide the gram measurement by 13.6 (the weight of 1 tbsp of sunflower oil). For example, 41 grams ÷ 13.6 = roughly 3 tablespoons. Keep a conversion chart handy for quick reference."
faqQ4: "Does the type of sunflower oil affect the weight per tablespoon?"
faqA4: "Refined and unrefined sunflower oil have nearly identical densities, so the weight difference is negligible. However, cold-pressed oils may have slight variations due to processing methods. Stick to standard conversions for consistency."

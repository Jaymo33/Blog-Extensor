faqQ1: "Can I use regular yogurt instead of greek yogurt in air fryer recipes?"
faqA1: "Yes, but adjust the quantity. Regular yogurt is thinner, so use 1.25 tbsp (about 18.75g) to match the thickness of 1.5 tbsp (22.5g) of greek yogurt. Drain excess liquid if needed for marinades or dips."
faqQ2: "Why does my air fryer recipe taste off when I eyeball 1.5 tbsp of greek yogurt?"
faqA2: "Eyeballing can lead to uneven measurements—too much yogurt adds excess moisture, while too little dulls flavours. For consistent results, weigh 22.5g or use proper measuring spoons."
faqQ3: "How do I convert 1.5 tbsp of greek yogurt to grams for a large batch recipe?"
faqA3: "Multiply 22.5g by your batch size. For 4 servings, you’d need 90g (4 x 1.5 tbsp). A kitchen scale ensures accuracy, especially for meal prep or baked goods."
faqQ4: "Is 1.5 tbsp of greek yogurt the same in US and UK measurements?"
faqA4: "UK and US tablespoons both hold 15ml, so 1.5 tbsp equals 22.5g in both. However, always check recipe origins, as some US recipes use cups instead of grams."

<p>1.5 tablespoons (tbsp) of greek yogurt equals approximately 22.5 grams in UK measurements. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precision ensures the best texture and consistency. Whether you’re making dips, marinades, or baked goods, knowing the exact weight saves time and avoids kitchen mishaps.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on even heat distribution, so ingredient ratios must be spot-on. Too much or too little greek yogurt can affect moisture levels, cooking times, and final results. For example, a marinade with 1.5 tbsp of greek yogurt (22.5g) helps tenderise chicken evenly, while a batter might need adjustments if the yogurt isn’t measured correctly.

<p>Greek yogurt is thicker than regular yogurt, so volume-to-weight conversions differ. A standard UK tablespoon holds 15ml, but density plays a role. For air fryer recipes like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken dishes</a>, 22.5g of greek yogurt provides the right acidity and creaminess without overwhelming other flavours.</p>

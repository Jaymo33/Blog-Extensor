faqQ1: "Can I use 3 tbsp of quinoa instead of weighing it?"
faqA1: "Yes, 3 level tablespoons of quinoa roughly equal 30g, making it a convenient alternative if you don’t have scales. However, for baking or precise recipes, weighing is more accurate. Fluff the quinoa before measuring to avoid compacting it."
faqQ2: "How much cooked quinoa does 3 tbsp (30g) yield?"
faqA2: "Three tablespoons (30g) of uncooked quinoa expands to about 90g when cooked. This is ideal for one serving or as a base for air fryer dishes like stuffed mushrooms or veggie burgers."
faqQ3: "Do UK and US tablespoons measure quinoa the same?"
faqA3: "UK and US tablespoons both hold 15ml, so the measurement is the same. However, always level off the quinoa for accuracy. Compacted or heaped tablespoons can skew the weight."
faqQ4: "What’s the best way to store leftover cooked quinoa?"
faqA4: "Store cooked quinoa in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 3 days. Reheat it in the air fryer at 160°C for 3-4 minutes with a splash of water to restore moisture. It’s great for quick meals."

<p>3 tablespoons (tbsp) of quinoa weigh approximately 30 grams (g). This conversion is essential for precise cooking, especially when using an air fryer, where ingredient ratios can affect texture and cooking times. Whether you're meal prepping or following a recipe from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, knowing this measurement ensures consistency.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate quinoa measurements matter</h2>  
<p>Quinoa is a versatile ingredient, but its light, fluffy texture means volume measurements like tablespoons can vary. Using grams ensures accuracy, particularly for air fryer recipes where even cooking is key. For example, if a recipe on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes</a> calls for 30g of quinoa, you’ll know exactly how much to use. This prevents undercooking or drying out your dish.</p>  

<p>Many UK cooks rely on tablespoons for convenience, but grams are the gold standard for precision. If you’re adapting a recipe from cups or tablespoons to grams, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> can help. This is especially useful for quinoa, which expands during cooking, so starting with the right amount is crucial.</p>  

<h3>How to measure 3 tbsp of quinoa without scales</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have kitchen scales, use a standard UK tablespoon (15ml) and level it off for accuracy. Three level tablespoons of quinoa will roughly equal 30g. For best results, fluff the quinoa lightly before measuring to avoid compacting it. This method works well for recipes like air-fried quinoa patties or stuffed vegetables.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for 3 tbsp (30g) of quinoa</h2>  
<p>Thirty grams of uncooked quinoa yields about 90g cooked, making it perfect for single servings. Try it in air-fryer-friendly dishes like quinoa-stuffed peppers or as a base for grain bowls. Check out the <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetables category</a> for inspiration. Quinoa’s high protein content also makes it great for meal prep.</p>  

<p>For larger batches, multiply the measurement accordingly. Three tablespoons (30g) of quinoa cooks quickly in the air fryer, usually in under 15 minutes with a bit of water or broth. This makes it a handy staple for quick, healthy meals. If you’re new to cooking quinoa, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning guide</a> ensures your air fryer stays in top condition after use.</p>  

<h3>Tips for cooking quinoa in an air fryer</h3>  
<p>Rinse quinoa thoroughly before cooking to remove saponins, which can taste bitter. For 30g (3 tbsp) of quinoa, use 60ml of liquid in an air fryer-safe dish. Cover with foil and cook at 180°C for 12-15 minutes. Let it rest for 5 minutes before fluffing. This method works for most air fryer models and yields perfectly tender quinoa every time.</p>

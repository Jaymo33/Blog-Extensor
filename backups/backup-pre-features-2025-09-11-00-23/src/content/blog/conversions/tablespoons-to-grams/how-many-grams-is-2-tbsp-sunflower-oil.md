faqQ1: "How do I measure 2 tbsp of sunflower oil without scales?"
faqA1: "Use a standard UK tablespoon—one level tablespoon holds about 14g of sunflower oil, so two tablespoons equal 28g. For sticky ingredients, a kitchen scale is more accurate, but tablespoons work well for liquids like oil."
faqQ2: "Can I use other oils instead of sunflower oil in my air fryer?"
faqA2: "Yes, oils like rapeseed or vegetable oil can substitute sunflower oil, but check their smoke points. Sunflower oil’s high smoke point (around 225°C) makes it ideal for air frying at high temperatures."
faqQ3: "Why is 2 tbsp of sunflower oil a common measurement in air fryer recipes?"
faqA3: "2 tbsp (28g) provides enough oil to coat food evenly without excess grease, ensuring crispiness while keeping dishes light. It’s a balanced amount for most air fryer baskets."
faqQ4: "Does the brand of sunflower oil affect the weight per tablespoon?"
faqA4: "Most sunflower oils have similar densities, so the weight per tablespoon (14g) stays consistent across brands. Always use a level tablespoon for accuracy."

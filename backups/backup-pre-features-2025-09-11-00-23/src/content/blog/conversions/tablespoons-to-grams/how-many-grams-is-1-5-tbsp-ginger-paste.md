faqQ1: "Can I use fresh ginger instead of ginger paste in air fryer recipes?"
faqA1: "Yes, you can substitute fresh ginger for paste. Use 2 tablespoons of freshly grated ginger for every 1.5 tbsp of ginger paste (about 22.5g). Fresh ginger has a brighter flavour, while paste offers convenience and longer shelf life."
faqQ2: "How do I measure 1.5 tbsp ginger paste without a tablespoon?"
faqA2: "If you don’t have a tablespoon, use 3 level teaspoons (tsp) of ginger paste, as 1 tbsp equals 3 tsp. For accuracy, spoon the paste into the measuring spoon and level it off with a straight edge."
faqQ3: "Does ginger paste weigh the same as grated ginger?"
faqA3: "No, ginger paste is denser due to its concentrated form. While 1.5 tbsp of grated ginger weighs about 12g, the same volume of paste weighs roughly 22.5g. Always check your recipe’s requirements for best results."
faqQ4: "How long does ginger paste last in the fridge?"
faqA4: "Properly stored in an airtight container, ginger paste lasts 2-3 weeks in the fridge. For longer storage, freeze it in ice cube trays – each cube holds about 1 tbsp (15g), making it easy to measure for air fryer recipes."

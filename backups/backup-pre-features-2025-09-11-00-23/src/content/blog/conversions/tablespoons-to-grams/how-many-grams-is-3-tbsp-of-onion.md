faqQ1: "Does the type of onion affect the weight measurement?"
faqA1: "Yes, onion varieties differ slightly in density. Shallots and red onions are marginally heavier per tablespoon than white onions, but the difference is minimal for most recipes. For air fryer cooking, sticking to the standard 3 tbsp = 30g ratio works well across types."
faqQ2: "Can I use dried onion instead of fresh for air fryer recipes?"
faqA2: "You can substitute dried onion, but the conversion differs. One tablespoon of dried onion equals about 5 grams, so you'd need less. Rehydrate dried onions slightly before air frying to prevent burning. Fresh onions generally yield better texture in air fryer dishes."
faqQ3: "How do I convert grams back to tablespoons if my scale breaks?"
faqA3: "Without a scale, use the rough guide of 10 grams per tablespoon for chopped onion. Scoop lightly and level off for consistency. Keep in mind this method is less precise than weighing, especially for air fryer recipes where exact measurements matter."
faqQ4: "Why does my air-fried onion sometimes burn?"
faqA4: "Onions can burn quickly in air fryers due to their high sugar content. To prevent this, toss them in a bit of oil and cook at 160°C for shorter intervals. Stir halfway through cooking. Thirty grams (3 tbsp) cooks evenly in 5-7 minutes."

<h2>Why accurate onion measurements matter</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of onion can significantly impact flavour and texture in air fryer dishes. Too little, and your meal might lack depth; too much, and it could overpower other ingredients. Onions also vary in density—finely chopped vs. roughly diced—so weighing ensures accuracy.

<p>Air fryers cook food quickly, so balanced proportions are key. A 30-gram portion of onion (3 tbsp) works perfectly for most single-serving dishes. If you're meal prepping, scale up accordingly and store leftovers properly.

<h3>How to measure 3 tbsp of onion correctly</h3>  
<p>For the most accurate 3 tbsp onion to grams conversion, lightly pack the chopped onion into a tablespoon without pressing too hard. Level off the top with a knife for consistency. If your recipe calls for grams, a kitchen scale is your best friend—especially for air fryer cooking, where precision matters.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for 3 tbsp onion in air fryer recipes</h2>  
<p>Thirty grams of onion (3 tbsp) is ideal for adding flavour to smaller dishes. Try it in air-fried frittatas, stuffed mushrooms, or as a base for mini kebabs.

faqQ1: "Can I use fresh ginger instead of 0.75 tbsp ginger paste?"
faqA1: "Yes, you can substitute fresh ginger for ginger paste. Grate about 1.5 teaspoons of fresh ginger to replace 0.75 tbsp (11.25g) of paste. Fresh ginger has a brighter flavour, so adjust to taste. For air fryer recipes, pastes often blend better into marinades."
faqQ2: "Why is weighing ginger paste better than using tablespoons?"
faqA2: "Ginger paste’s thickness varies by brand, making tablespoon measurements inconsistent. Weighing in grams ensures accuracy, especially in air fryer cooking where precise flavours matter. 0.75 tbsp equals 11.25g, but scales eliminate guesswork for perfect results every time."
faqQ3: "How long does 0.75 tbsp ginger paste last in the fridge?"
faqA3: "An opened jar of ginger paste lasts 2–3 weeks refrigerated. For 0.75 tbsp portions, freeze unused paste in 11.25g batches. Thaw as needed for air fryer recipes to maintain freshness and flavour."
faqQ4: "Does 0.75 tbsp ginger paste work for vegan air fryer dishes?"
faqA4: "Absolutely! Ginger paste is plant-based and adds depth to vegan air fryer meals like tofu or roasted veggies. Use 11.25g (0.75 tbsp) in marinades or sauces for a flavour kick without compromising dietary preferences."

faqQ1: "Can I use honey instead of golden syrup in air fryer recipes?"
faqA1: "Yes, honey can substitute golden syrup in most air fryer recipes, but adjust the quantity. Honey is slightly denser—2.5 tbsp equals about 63g. Reduce cooking time by 1-2 minutes as honey caramelises faster."
faqQ2: "Why does my air fryer recipe turn out too sticky with golden syrup?"
faqA2: "Excess golden syrup or overcrowding the basket can cause stickiness. Stick to 2.5 tbsp (53g) and space ingredients evenly. Lining the basket with parchment paper also helps prevent syrup from adhering to surfaces."
faqQ3: "How do I convert grams back to tablespoons if a recipe uses weight?"
faqA3: "Divide the gram measurement by 21.2 (1 tbsp golden syrup ≈ 21.2g). For example, 53g ÷ 21.2 = 2.5 tbsp. Use our <a href=\"https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart\">conversion chart</a> for quick reference."
faqQ4: "Does golden syrup measurement change between UK and US tablespoons?"
faqA4: "UK and US tablespoons differ slightly (15ml vs 14.8ml), but for golden syrup, the variance is negligible. 2.5 UK tbsp ≈ 2.52 US tbsp, both weighing ~53g. Always check your measuring spoon’s origin if precision is critical."

<p>2.5 tablespoons of golden syrup equals approximately 53 grams. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements ensure perfect texture and flavour. Whether you're baking sticky toffee pudding or glazing roasted vegetables, knowing the exact weight of golden syrup makes all the difference.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on even heat distribution, so ingredient ratios must be spot-on. Too much golden syrup can lead to overly sticky or burnt results, while too little might leave your dish lacking sweetness. For consistent outcomes, always measure golden syrup by weight rather than volume. Our <a href="https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart">air fryer conversion chart</a> simplifies these calculations for all your favourite ingredients.</p>  

<p>Golden syrup’s density means a tablespoon doesn’t always equal the same weight as other liquids. At <a href="https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk">airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we recommend using digital scales for reliability. If you’re adapting a traditional recipe for your air fryer, converting 2.5 tbsp golden syrup to grams (53g) ensures flawless execution every time.</p>  

<h3>How to measure golden syrup without scales</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have scales, lightly grease your measuring spoon to help the syrup slide out cleanly. Fill it to the brim without overflowing, then level off with a straight edge. Remember, 2.5 tbsp golden syrup in grams is roughly 53g, but slight variations can occur based on temperature and brand.</p>

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Using the correct amount of powdered milk can make or break your air fryer recipes. Too much can dry out baked goods, while too little might leave sauces watery. Powdered milk is a common ingredient in air fryer recipes like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>cakes</a> and bread coatings, so precision is key. Unlike liquid milk, powdered milk has a concentrated flavour and texture, so even small deviations can affect the outcome. Always measure by weight for the best results.</p>  

<p>Many air fryer enthusiasts rely on volume measurements like tablespoons, but weight is far more reliable. A kitchen scale eliminates guesswork, especially when working with ingredients like powdered milk that can settle or vary in density. If you're serious about air fryer cooking, investing in a good scale is a game-changer. For more tips, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a>.</p>

faqQ1: "Can I use 0.5 tbsp of BBQ sauce for air fryer ribs?"
faqA1: "Absolutely! 0.5 tbsp (7.5g) of BBQ sauce is enough to lightly coat one small rib portion in the air fryer. For stickier ribs, apply a second layer halfway through cooking. Avoid overloading to prevent smoke."
faqQ2: "Why does my air fryer smoke when using BBQ sauce?"
faqA2: "BBQ sauce contains sugar, which burns quickly under high heat. Using more than 0.5 tbsp (7.5g) per serving can cause smoking. To prevent this, dilute sauce with water or apply it in the last 5 minutes of cooking."
faqQ3: "How do I convert 0.5 tbsp of BBQ sauce to grams for a UK recipe?"
faqA3: "In the UK, 0.5 tbsp of BBQ sauce equals roughly 7.5 grams. UK and US tablespoons are the same size, so no adjustment is needed. For precision, weigh it on a metric scale."
faqQ4: "Can I substitute ketchup for BBQ sauce in a 0.5 tbsp measurement?"
faqA4: "Yes, but ketchup is thinner, so 0.5 tbsp weighs slightly less (about 7g). Adjust seasonings, as ketchup lacks BBQ sauce’s smokiness. For best results, tweak the recipe or check our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>sauce substitutions guide</a>."

<h3>How to Measure 0.5 Tbsp of BBQ Sauce Without Scales</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have scales, fill a tablespoon halfway for 0.5 tbsp (about 7.5g). Use a levelled measuring spoon for accuracy. For sticky sauces like BBQ, lightly grease the spoon first to help it slide off cleanly. This trick works for all <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipes</a> requiring precise sauce amounts.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for 0.5 Tbsp of BBQ Sauce</h2>  
<p>Half a tablespoon (7.5g) of BBQ sauce is perfect for glazing small portions like chicken tenders or tofu bites in the air fryer. It’s also ideal for mixing into marinades or brushing onto <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>roasted vegetables</a>. Since air fryers circulate heat intensely, a little sauce goes a long way. Overdoing it can lead to smoking or burning.</p>  

<p>For larger batches, multiply the 0.5 tbsp (7.5g) measurement accordingly. Six servings? That’s 3 tbsp or 45 grams. Always adjust cooking times if using extra sauce, as moisture affects crispiness. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe hub</a> for saucy air fryer ideas.</p>  

<h3>Does BBQ Sauce Brand Affect the Weight?</h3>  
<p>Yes, thicker, sugar-heavy BBQ sauces weigh more per 0.5 tbsp (up to 8g), while lighter ones hover near 7g. Always check the label for viscosity clues. For consistent results, stick to one brand per recipe. Homemade sauces vary widely, so scales are best.</p>

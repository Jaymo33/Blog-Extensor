faqQ1: "Does the type of milk affect the weight of 0.5 tbsp?"
faqA1: "Yes, but slightly. Whole milk is denser than skim or plant-based alternatives, but the difference is minimal. For most recipes, 0.5 tbsp of any milk type will weigh close to 7.5 grams."
faqQ2: "Can I use milliliters instead of grams for 0.5 tbsp of milk?"
faqA2: "Absolutely. 0.5 tbsp of milk is about 7.4 ml, but grams are preferred for baking accuracy. Milliliters measure volume, while grams measure weight, which is more consistent for air fryer recipes."
faqQ3: "Why is measuring 0.5 tbsp of milk important in air frying?"
faqA3: "Air fryers cook food quickly, so precise ingredient ratios ensure even cooking and texture. Too much or too little milk can alter moisture levels, affecting crisping or browning."
faqQ4: "How do I measure 0.5 tbsp without a measuring spoon?"
faqA4: "Use a regular teaspoon: 1.5 teaspoons equal 0.5 tbsp. Alternatively, estimate half of a standard tablespoon (fill it halfway). For best results, a kitchen scale is ideal."

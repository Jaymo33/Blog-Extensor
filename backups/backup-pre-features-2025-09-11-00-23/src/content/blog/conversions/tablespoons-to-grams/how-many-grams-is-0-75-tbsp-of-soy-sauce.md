faqQ1: "Can I use millilitres instead of grams for measuring soy sauce?"
faqA1: "Yes, you can measure soy sauce by volume in millilitres. 0.75 tbsp equals about 11.1ml, which is nearly identical to its weight in grams (11.25g) due to soy sauce's similar density to water. For most air fryer recipes, either measurement works fine."
faqQ2: "Why does my air fryer food taste too salty when I use soy sauce?"
faqA2: "Air fryers intensify flavours as they rapidly circulate hot air, causing liquids like soy sauce to concentrate. Try reducing the amount slightly or diluting it with water or citrus juice. The 0.75 tbsp (11.25g) measurement we recommend helps prevent over-seasoning in this efficient cooking environment."
faqQ3: "How should I store opened soy sauce for air fryer cooking?"
faqA3: "Keep opened soy sauce in a cool, dark place or refrigerate to maintain quality. Proper storage ensures consistent flavour when measuring out small amounts like 0.75 tbsp for air fryer recipes. Always check for freshness if your sauce has been open for more than six months."
faqQ4: "Can I use light and dark soy sauce interchangeably in air fryer recipes?"
faqA4: "While you can substitute them, dark soy sauce is thicker and sweeter than light varieties. When using 0.75 tbsp (11.25g) in recipes, remember that dark soy will add more colour and a different flavour profile. Adjust other seasonings accordingly for balanced results in your air-fried dishes."

faqQ1: "Does the type of cream affect how many grams are in 1 tbsp?"
faqA1: "Yes, the fat content and thickness of the cream can slightly alter the weight. Single cream is typically around 15 grams per tbsp, while double cream may be closer to 18 grams due to its denser texture."
faqQ2: "Can I use a US tablespoon to measure cream for UK recipes?"
faqA2: "No, US tablespoons (14.8ml) are slightly smaller than UK tablespoons (15ml). For accuracy, stick to UK measurements or adjust the quantity if using US tools."
faqQ3: "How do I convert grams of cream to millilitres?"
faqA3: "Cream’s density means 15 grams is roughly equal to 15ml for single cream. However, thicker creams like double may vary, so weighing is best for precision."
faqQ4: "Why is my air fryer recipe too runny when using cream?"
faqA4: "This could be due to over-measuring the cream or using a thinner variety. Always measure carefully and consider reducing other liquids in the recipe if needed."

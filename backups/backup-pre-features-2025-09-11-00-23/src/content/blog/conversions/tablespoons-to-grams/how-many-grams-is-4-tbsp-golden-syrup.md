faqQ1: "Can I use honey instead of golden syrup in air fryer recipes?"
faqA1: "Yes, honey can substitute golden syrup, but it’s slightly thinner and sweeter. Use about 80g of honey for every 85g of golden syrup (4 tbsp). Adjust cooking times slightly, as honey may caramelise faster in the air fryer."
faqQ2: "Why does my golden syrup measurement vary slightly?"
faqA2: "Small variations occur due to temperature, brand, or how the syrup is packed into the spoon. For absolute precision, weigh it in grams. At room temperature, golden syrup flows more easily, giving a more consistent measure."
faqQ3: "How do I clean golden syrup from my air fryer basket?"
faqA3: "Soak the basket in warm, soapy water to loosen sticky residue. For stubborn spots, use a soft sponge or our recommended <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner</a>. Avoid abrasive scrubbers to prevent damage."
faqQ4: "What’s the best way to measure sticky ingredients like golden syrup?"
faqA4: "Lightly grease your measuring spoon with oil first—this helps the syrup slide off cleanly. Alternatively, use a silicone spatula to scrape it out. For accuracy, weighing in grams is always best."

<p>4 tablespoons (tbsp) of golden syrup equals approximately 85 grams (g). This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes, ensuring precise measurements for perfect results every time. Whether you’re baking cakes, glazing meats, or making desserts, knowing the exact weight of golden syrup helps maintain consistency. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we focus on accurate conversions to make your cooking effortless.</p>

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Golden syrup is a sticky, sweet ingredient often used in baking and glazing. Its thick consistency means volume measurements like tablespoons can vary slightly in weight. For air fryer recipes, precision ensures even cooking and perfect texture. Too much syrup can make dishes overly sweet or sticky, while too little might leave them dry. Using grams instead of tablespoons eliminates guesswork, especially when following recipes from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>our collection</a>.</p>  

<p>Air fryers circulate hot air rapidly, so ingredient ratios are crucial. Golden syrup’s density means 4 tbsp will always weigh around 85g, but slight variations can occur based on temperature and brand. For consistent results, we recommend using a kitchen scale.

<h3>How to measure golden syrup without a scale</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a scale, use the spoon-and-level method for 4 tbsp of golden syrup. Fill your tablespoon, then level it off with a knife for accuracy. Remember, 4 tbsp equals 85g, so adjust your recipe accordingly. For sticky ingredients like golden syrup, lightly greasing the spoon helps it slide off easily. This trick is handy when preparing desserts from our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert category</a>.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for golden syrup in air fryer recipes</h2>  
<p>Golden syrup adds a rich, caramelised flavour to both sweet and savoury dishes. In air fryers, it’s perfect for glazing ham, baking flapjacks, or drizzling over roasted vegetables. Its high sugar content helps create a glossy finish and enhances browning. For inspiration, browse our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>cake recipes</a>, where golden syrup often stars as a key ingredient.</p>  

<p>When using golden syrup in air fryers, avoid overheating it to prevent burning. A lower temperature (around 160°C) works best for syrupy glazes. Always preheat your air fryer to ensure even cooking. If you’re unsure about timings, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning guide</a> also includes tips for removing sticky residues post-cooking.</p>  

<h3>Storing and substituting golden syrup</h3>  
<p>Golden syrup lasts for months in a cool, dry place. If it crystallises, gently warm the jar in hot water to restore its smooth texture. For substitutes, honey or maple syrup can work, but adjust quantities as they have different densities. Always check conversions to ensure your air fryer recipes turn out perfectly.</p>

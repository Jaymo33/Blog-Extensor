faqQ1: "Does 2.5 tbsp of granulated sugar weigh the same as brown sugar?"
faqA1: "No, brown sugar is denser due to its moisture content. While 2.5 tbsp of granulated sugar weighs about 31.25g, the same volume of packed brown sugar would be approximately 37.5g. Always weigh brown sugar for accuracy in air fryer recipes."
faqQ2: "Can I use this conversion for icing sugar in my air fryer?"
faqA2: "Icing sugar is much lighter - 2.5 tbsp equals roughly 15g. Its fine texture means it dissolves faster, which affects air fryer cooking times. Reduce quantities by about half when substituting for granulated sugar in recipes."
faqQ3: "Why does my air fryer recipe need exact sugar measurements?"
faqA3: "Air fryers circulate hot air intensely, so small measurement errors can lead to burning or uneven cooking. Precise sugar quantities ensure proper caramelisation and texture. This is especially crucial for baked goods where sugar affects structure."
faqQ4: "How do I convert grams back to tablespoons if my recipe uses weight?"
faqA4: "For granulated sugar, divide grams by 12.5 to get UK tablespoons. So 31.25g ÷ 12.5 = 2.5 tbsp. Keep a conversion chart handy near your air fryer for quick reference during cooking sessions."

<p>2.5 tablespoons of granulated sugar equals approximately 31.25 grams. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements can make or break your dish. Whether you’re baking cookies or preparing a glaze, knowing the exact weight ensures consistent results every time.</p>

<h2>Why accurate sugar measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>
<p>Air fryers cook food faster and more evenly than conventional ovens, which means ingredient ratios need to be spot-on. Too much sugar can cause burning or uneven caramelisation, while too little might leave your dish lacking sweetness. For perfect air fryer desserts like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>cakes or cookies</a>, measuring 2.5 tbsp of granulated sugar correctly is crucial.</p>
<p>Granulated sugar’s density can vary slightly based on how it’s packed, so weighing it removes guesswork. Digital kitchen scales are inexpensive and invaluable for air fryer enthusiasts. If you’re converting from US recipes, note that UK tablespoons differ slightly (15ml vs 14.2ml), but our 31.25g measurement accounts for this.</p>

<h2>How to measure 2.5 tbsp of granulated sugar without scales</h2>
<p>If you don’t have scales, use the spoon-and-level method for accuracy. Gently spoon granulated sugar into your tablespoon measure without packing it down, then level off the top with a straight edge. Repeat this 2.5 times for the correct amount. Remember that 1 UK tablespoon of granulated sugar equals about 12.5 grams.</p>
<p>For context, 2.5 tbsp granulated sugar is roughly equivalent to 1.5 standard UK digestive biscuits in sweetness. When adapting oven recipes for your air fryer, you might need to slightly reduce sugar quantities since the concentrated heat intensifies flavours.

<h3>Sugar alternatives and their gram equivalents</h3>
<p>If substituting sweeteners, note that 2.5 tbsp of granulated sugar (31.25g) equals about 2 tbsp of honey (42g) or 5 tsp of maple syrup (35g). These liquid alternatives may require recipe tweaks since they add moisture. For diabetic-friendly options, 2.5 tbsp of granulated sugar converts to about 1.25 tbsp of erythritol (18g).</p>

faqQ1: "Can I use bottled lemon juice instead of fresh for the 2.5 tbsp measurement?"
faqA1: "Yes, bottled lemon juice can be used, but it may have a slightly different acidity and flavour. Fresh lemon juice is often preferred for its brightness, but bottled works in a pinch. Just ensure you measure the same 37 grams for accuracy."
faqQ2: "Does the type of lemon affect the weight of 2.5 tbsp of juice?"
faqA2: "Most lemons yield similar juice density, so the weight difference is minimal. However, larger or juicier lemons might produce slightly more liquid per tablespoon. For precision, weighing the juice is best."
faqQ3: "How do I convert 2.5 tbsp of lemon juice to ounces?"
faqA3: "2.5 tbsp of lemon juice is roughly 1.3 ounces (37 grams). This conversion is handy for recipes using imperial measurements. A digital scale ensures you get it spot-on."
faqQ4: "Can I substitute lime juice for lemon juice in the same quantity?"
faqA4: "Yes, lime juice can replace lemon juice in equal amounts (37 grams for 2.5 tbsp). The flavour will be different but equally vibrant. Adjust other seasonings to complement the lime’s sharper taste."

<p>2.5 tablespoons (tbsp) of lemon juice equals approximately 37 grams. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precision ensures perfect results. Whether you're marinating chicken or adding zest to a dessert, knowing the exact weight helps avoid over or under-seasoning. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we focus on accurate measurements to elevate your cooking.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Lemon Juice Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of lemon juice can make or break a dish. Too little, and your marinade lacks tang; too much, and it overpowers other flavours. In air fryer cooking, precise measurements ensure even cooking and balanced taste. For example, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>lemon herb chicken</a> relies on exact lemon juice quantities for optimal flavour. Converting 2.5 tbsp of lemon juice to grams eliminates guesswork.</p>  

<p>Lemon juice density can vary slightly, but 1 tbsp typically weighs around 15 grams. This means 2.5 tbsp translates to roughly 37 grams. If you’re scaling a recipe, this conversion ensures consistency.

<h3>How to Measure Lemon Juice Correctly</h3>  
<p>For the most accurate results, use a digital kitchen scale. Pour the lemon juice into a measuring spoon, then transfer it to the scale for the exact weight. If you don’t have a scale, levelling off the tablespoon ensures minimal variance. Recipes like our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>lemon drizzle cake</a> benefit from this precision.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for 2.5 tbsp of Lemon Juice</h2>  
<p>This quantity is perfect for marinades, dressings, or glazes. A 37-gram portion of lemon juice adds brightness to air-fried salmon or roasted vegetables. It’s also ideal for balancing rich dishes, like our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>garlic lemon chicken thighs</a>. The acidity tenderises meat while enhancing flavour.</p>  

<p>Beyond savoury dishes, 2.5 tbsp of lemon juice works wonders in desserts. From light glazes to tangy curds, it’s a versatile ingredient.

<h3>Adjusting Recipes with Lemon Juice</h3>

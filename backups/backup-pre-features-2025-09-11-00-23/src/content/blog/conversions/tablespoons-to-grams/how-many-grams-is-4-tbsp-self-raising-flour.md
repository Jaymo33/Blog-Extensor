faqQ1: "Can I use plain flour instead of self-raising flour for 4 tbsp in a recipe?"
faqA1: "Yes, but you’ll need to add baking powder. For every 150g of plain flour, mix in 2 tsp of baking powder. If your recipe calls for 4 tbsp (30g) of self-raising flour, use 30g plain flour plus ¼ tsp baking powder."
faqQ2: "Why does my air fryer bake turn out dense with 4 tbsp of self-raising flour?"
faqA2: "Dense bakes often result from over-measuring or compacted flour. Ensure you’re spooning and leveling the flour lightly. Also, check your air fryer’s temperature—too low, and the baking powder won’t activate properly."
faqQ3: "How do I convert 4 tbsp of self-raising flour to cups?"
faqA3: "4 tbsp equals ¼ cup. However, for accuracy, grams are preferable. A standard UK cup of self-raising flour is 120g, so 4 tbsp (30g) is a quarter of that."
faqQ4: "Does the brand of self-raising flour affect the 4 tbsp to grams conversion?"
faqA4: "Slight variations exist between brands due to milling density. Always check the packaging for weight guidelines, but most UK brands align with the 30g-per-4-tbsp standard. When in doubt, weigh it."

<p>4 tablespoons (tbsp) of self-raising flour equals approximately 30 grams (g). This conversion is essential for precise baking, especially when using an air fryer, where accurate measurements can make or break your recipe. Whether you're whipping up cakes, muffins, or bread, knowing the exact weight ensures consistent results every time.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate flour measurements matter</h2>  
<p>Baking is a science, and even small measurement discrepancies can affect texture and rise. Self-raising flour contains baking powder, so incorrect amounts may lead to overly dense or flat bakes. For air fryer recipes, where cooking times are shorter, precision is even more critical. A digital kitchen scale is the best tool, but if you're using tablespoons, our conversion ensures reliability.</p>  

<p>At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we emphasise the importance of accurate conversions for flawless air fryer baking.

<h3>How to measure 4 tbsp of self-raising flour correctly</h3>  
<p>For the most accurate 30g equivalent, spoon the flour into the tablespoon and level it off with a knife. Scooping directly from the bag can compact the flour, leading to excess. If your recipe calls for 4 tbsp of self-raising flour in grams, this method ensures consistency. For larger batches, multiply accordingly—e.g., 8 tbsp = 60g.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for 4 tbsp of self-raising flour</h2>  
<p>This quantity is perfect for small-batch baking in your air fryer. Think individual muffins, scones, or even coating for crispy chicken. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipes section</a> features dozens of ideas, from savoury to sweet. Self-raising flour’s leavening properties make it ideal for quick bakes with minimal fuss.</p>  

<p>If you're adapting a traditional oven recipe for the air fryer, gram measurements eliminate guesswork. For example, a classic Victoria sponge scaled down for the air fryer might require precisely 4 tbsp (30g) of self-raising flour per layer.</p>  

<h3>Self-raising flour vs. plain flour conversions</h3>  
<p>While 4 tbsp of plain flour also weighs around 30g, remember that self-raising flour includes baking powder. Substituting one for the other requires adjustments. For every 150g of plain flour, add 2 tsp of baking powder to mimic self-raising flour. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>cake recipes</a> detail these tweaks for air fryer success.</p>  

<h2>Tips for storing self-raising flour</h2>  
<p>Keep your flour in an airtight container to maintain its raising agents’ potency. Humidity can clump the flour, affecting measurements. If your 4 tbsp seems denser than usual, fluff it with a fork before measuring.

<p>Self-raising flour has a shorter shelf life than plain flour due to the baking powder. Label your container with the purchase date, and aim to use it within six months for best results in air fryer baking.</p>

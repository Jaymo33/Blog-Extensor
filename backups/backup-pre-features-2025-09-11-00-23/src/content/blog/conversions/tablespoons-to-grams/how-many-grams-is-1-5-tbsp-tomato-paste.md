faqQ1: "Can I use tomato puree instead of tomato paste in air fryer recipes?"
faqA1: "While you can substitute tomato puree for paste, you'll need to adjust quantities. Tomato puree is less concentrated, so use about three times the amount. For 1.5 tbsp of tomato paste, you'd need roughly 4.5 tbsp of puree. Remember to account for the extra liquid in your air fryer recipe."
faqQ2: "How do I measure sticky ingredients like tomato paste without scales?"
faqA2: "For sticky ingredients, lightly oil your measuring spoon first to help the paste slide off easily. Alternatively, use the displacement method: fill a liquid measuring cup with water, then add spoonfuls of paste until the water level rises by the equivalent volume. This works well for air fryer recipes where precision matters."
faqQ3: "Does the brand of tomato paste affect the weight conversion?"
faqA3: "Different brands can vary slightly in density, but the difference is usually minimal. Most standard tomato pastes will weigh about 15g per tablespoon. For critical air fryer recipes, it's worth checking your specific brand or using scales for complete accuracy, especially in baking applications."
faqQ4: "How long does opened tomato paste last in the fridge?"
faqA4: "Once opened, tomato paste lasts about 5-7 days in the refrigerator if stored properly in an airtight container. For longer storage, freeze it in portions. This way, you'll always have the right amount ready for your next air fryer recipe without waste. Ice cube trays work perfectly for tablespoon-sized portions."

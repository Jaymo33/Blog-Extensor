faqQ1: "Can I use whipped soft cheese instead of regular soft cheese for the 2.5 tbsp measurement?"
faqA1: "Whipped soft cheese is lighter and fluffier, so 2.5 tbsp may weigh slightly less than regular soft cheese. For accuracy, stick to the 37.5-gram measurement if possible. If using whipped, you might need a bit more to match the weight."
faqQ2: "How do I measure 2.5 tbsp of soft cheese if I don’t have a tablespoon?"
faqA2: "If you don’t have a tablespoon, use three level teaspoons (1 tbsp = 3 tsp) to measure 2.5 tbsp (7.5 tsp total). Alternatively, estimate by eye—2.5 tbsp is roughly a quarter of a standard 200-gram tub of soft cheese."
faqQ3: "Does the type of soft cheese affect the 2.5 tbsp to grams conversion?"
faqA3: "Yes, denser cheeses like cream cheese will weigh more per tbsp than lighter options like ricotta. For precise results, always weigh your cheese. If in doubt, 37.5 grams is a safe estimate for most soft cheeses."
faqQ4: "Can I freeze soft cheese if I only need 2.5 tbsp for a recipe?"
faqA4: "Freezing soft cheese can alter its texture, making it grainy when thawed. It’s best to use fresh cheese for recipes. If you have leftovers, try incorporating them into another dish within a few days."

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on even cooking, and incorrect ingredient quantities can lead to uneven results.

Measuring 2.5 tbsp of soft cheese in grams ensures you’re using the right amount for perfect texture and flavour.

<p>Using a kitchen scale is the most accurate way to measure soft cheese, but if you don’t have one, spoon measurements can work. Just remember that 1 tbsp of soft cheese is roughly 15 grams, so 2.5 tbsp equals 37.5 grams. This small detail can elevate your air fryer dishes from good to great.</p>  

<h2>How to measure soft cheese without a scale</h2>  
<p>If you don’t have a scale, you can still measure 2.5 tbsp of soft cheese accurately. Use a standard tablespoon and level it off with a knife for consistency. Soft cheese can vary in density, so avoid packing it tightly into the spoon.

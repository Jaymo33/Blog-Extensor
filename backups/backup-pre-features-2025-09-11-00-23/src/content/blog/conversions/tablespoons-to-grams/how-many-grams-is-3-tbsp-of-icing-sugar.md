faqQ1: "Can I use granulated sugar instead of icing sugar for 3 tbsp in air fryer recipes?"
faqA1: "No, granulated sugar won't work the same way as icing sugar in most air fryer recipes. Icing sugar is finely ground and contains cornflour, which affects texture and consistency. If you substitute, your desserts may turn out grainy or dry."
faqQ2: "How do I measure 3 tbsp of icing sugar without a scale?"
faqA2: "Use a standard UK tablespoon and lightly spoon the icing sugar into it, then level off with a knife. Avoid packing it down, as this can lead to over-measuring. Three level tablespoons should give you roughly 36 grams of icing sugar."
faqQ3: "Why does my air fryer dessert taste too sweet with 3 tbsp of icing sugar?"
faqA3: "This could happen if your tablespoons were heaped rather than level, or if the sugar was packed down. Always measure precisely for balanced sweetness. You might also try reducing the amount slightly if you prefer less sweet desserts."
faqQ4: "Can I reduce the amount of icing sugar in air fryer recipes for health reasons?"
faqA4: "Yes, you can slightly reduce the 3 tbsp (36 grams) of icing sugar, but be aware this may affect texture. For healthier options, try using alternatives like stevia or erythritol, but adjust quantities as they're sweeter than sugar. Always check conversion rates for sugar substitutes."

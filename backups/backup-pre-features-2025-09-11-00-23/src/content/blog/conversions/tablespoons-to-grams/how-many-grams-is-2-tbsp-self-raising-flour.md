faqQ1: "Does 2 tbsp of self-raising flour weigh the same as plain flour?"
faqA1: "No, 2 tbsp of self-raising flour weighs slightly less than plain flour due to the added baking powder. While 2 tbsp of self-raising flour is about 18g, the same volume of plain flour would be approximately 20g. This small difference matters in precise air fryer baking."
faqQ2: "Can I use plain flour instead of self-raising flour in air fryer recipes?"
faqA2: "You can substitute plain flour for self-raising flour by adding baking powder. For every 150g of plain flour (about 10 tbsp), add 1 teaspoon of baking powder. When converting small amounts like 2 tbsp (18g), you'd need about 1/8 teaspoon of baking powder to match self-raising flour's properties."
faqQ3: "Why does my air fryer baking sometimes fail with tablespoon measurements?"
faqA3: "Air fryers require precise measurements because their rapid air circulation amplifies small imbalances. Tablespoon measurements can vary by how you scoop, while grams are exact. For consistent results, we recommend weighing flour when possible, especially for delicate bakes like souffl√©s or sponge cakes."
faqQ4: "How do I adjust air fryer recipes that use cups to tablespoons?"
faqA4: "One UK cup of self-raising flour equals about 150g or roughly 8 level tablespoons. So if a recipe calls for 1/4 cup, that's 2 tablespoons (18g). Always check whether the original recipe uses US or UK cup measurements, as they differ slightly. Our conversion charts account for these differences specifically for air fryer cooking."

<p>2 tablespoons (tbsp) of self-raising flour weigh approximately 18 grams in UK measurements. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements can make or break your baking results. Whether you're whipping up cakes, muffins, or bread in your air fryer, knowing this conversion ensures perfect texture every time.</p>

<h2>Why accurate flour measurements matter in air fryer baking</h2>
<p>Air fryers circulate hot air rapidly, which means baking times and ingredient ratios need extra precision. Using too much or too little self-raising flour can affect rise and texture. For example, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer cake recipes</a> rely on this 2 tbsp to 18g conversion for consistent results. Digital scales are more accurate than volume measurements, but tablespoon conversions remain popular for quick recipes.</p>
<p>Self-raising flour contains baking powder already mixed in, typically at a ratio of 1 teaspoon per 150g of plain flour. When converting 2 tbsp to grams, you're accounting for this leavening agent too. This differs from plain flour conversions, making it crucial to use the right measurement for your <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>

<h3>How to measure 2 tbsp of self-raising flour accurately</h3>
<p>For the most precise 18g measurement, spoon flour lightly into your tablespoon without packing or tapping. Level off the excess with a straight edge. Scooping directly from the bag compacts the flour, potentially adding 2-3 extra grams. If you're adapting a <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>cake recipe</a> for the air fryer, this small difference could affect your bake's rise.</p>

<h2>Converting other flour amounts in air fryer recipes</h2>
<p>Once you know 2 tbsp equals 18g, you can scale up or down for different recipe quantities. Four tablespoons would be 36g, while half a tablespoon would be 9g. Many <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> baking recipes use this base measurement for small-batch air fryer bakes. Remember that humidity and flour brand can cause slight variations, so for critical recipes, weighing is always best.</p>
<p>If your air fryer recipe calls for cups of self-raising flour, note that 1 UK cup equals approximately 150g. This helps when converting American recipes that use volume measurements. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion resources</a> include these common baking measurements specifically for air fryer users.</p>

<h3>Common air fryer recipes using 2 tbsp self-raising flour</h3>
<p>This quantity often appears in small-batch air fryer bakes like scones, muffins, or single-serve cakes. The compact size of air fryer baskets makes these scaled-down recipes ideal.

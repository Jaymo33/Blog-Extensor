faqQ1: "Can I use milk instead of cream for 0.5 tbsp in grams?"
faqA1: "Yes, but milk has a lower fat content, so 0.5 tbsp weighs slightly less—about 7 grams. The texture and richness of your dish may vary, so adjust other ingredients accordingly. For best results in air fryer recipes, stick to cream unless specified."
faqQ2: "Why is weighing cream better than measuring by volume?"
faqA2: "Weight (grams) is more accurate because cream’s thickness can vary. A dollop of whipped cream fills a tablespoon differently than liquid cream. Scales eliminate this inconsistency, crucial for air fryer recipes where precision affects cooking time and texture."
faqQ3: "How do I convert 0.5 tbsp of double cream to grams?"
faqA3: "Double cream is denser, so 0.5 tbsp weighs around 8 grams. Always check your recipe’s requirements, as the extra fat can alter outcomes in air-fried dishes like custards or frostings."
faqQ4: "Does UK tablespoon size affect the gram conversion?"
faqA4: "UK tablespoons hold 15ml, the same as most metric measurements, so 0.5 tbsp is consistently 7.5 grams. In rare cases with imported recipes, verify the tablespoon standard used to avoid errors."

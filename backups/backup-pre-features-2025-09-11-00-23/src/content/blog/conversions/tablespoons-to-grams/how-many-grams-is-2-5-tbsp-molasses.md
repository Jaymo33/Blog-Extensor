<p>2.5 tablespoons (tbsp) of molasses equals approximately 53 grams (g). This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precision matters, ensuring your dishes turn out perfectly every time. Whether you're baking sticky toffee pudding or glazing meats, knowing the exact weight of molasses helps avoid overly sweet or dry results. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we focus on accurate measurements to elevate your cooking game.</p>  

<h2>Why converting tbsp to grams matters</h2>  
<p>Using grams instead of tablespoons ensures consistency, especially in air fryer recipes where ingredient ratios affect texture and cooking times. Molasses, being a thick, sticky liquid, can vary in volume due to temperature or settling. Measuring by weight eliminates these inconsistencies. For example, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> simplifies switching between units, making baking a breeze.</p>  

<p>Molasses adds depth to dishes like gingerbread or barbecue sauces, but too much can overpower flavours. By weighing 2.5 tbsp as 53 grams, you’ll achieve balanced sweetness. This precision is particularly useful for <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert recipes</a>, where even small measurement errors can alter outcomes.</p>  

<h3>How to measure molasses accurately</h3>  
<p>To measure 2.5 tbsp of molasses, use a liquid measuring spoon and level it off with a knife. For grams, a kitchen scale is ideal—simply tare the scale with your container, then pour molasses until it hits 53 grams. Sticky ingredients like molasses are easier to handle if you lightly grease the spoon or cup first.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for molasses in air fryer cooking</h2>

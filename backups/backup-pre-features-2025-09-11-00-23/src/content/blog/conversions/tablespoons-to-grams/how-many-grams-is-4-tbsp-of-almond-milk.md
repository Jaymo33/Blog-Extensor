<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on even heat distribution, so ingredient ratios can make or break a dish. Too much or too little almond milk can affect texture, especially in baked goods like cakes or muffins. For example, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer cake recipes</a> often call for precise liquid measurements to achieve the perfect crumb. Almond milk, being lighter than dairy milk, requires careful measuring to avoid soggy or dry results. A kitchen scale is your best friend here, but spoon measurements work too with the right conversions.</p>  

<p>Many air fryer recipes, like those in our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert category</a>, use almond milk as a dairy-free alternative. Whether you're whipping up pancakes or a creamy sauce, 60 grams per 4 tbsp ensures consistency. This is especially helpful when adapting traditional recipes for the air fryer’s unique cooking environment.

<h2>How to measure 4 tbsp of almond milk without a scale</h2>  
<p>If you don’t have a scale, use standard measuring spoons and fill them to the brim without packing. Almond milk should sit level with the spoon’s edge—no heaping. For liquids, a clear liquid measuring cup can also help; 4 tbsp equals 60 ml, which roughly translates to 60 grams due to almond milk’s density. This method works well for recipes like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/breakfast>air fryer breakfasts</a>, where small adjustments matter.</p>  

<h3>Does almond milk brand affect the weight?</h3>  
<p>Most commercial almond milks have a similar density, but homemade versions may vary slightly. If you’re using a thicker or sweetened variety, check the label for specific weight per tablespoon. For example, barista-style almond milk might be denser, requiring slight adjustments. When in doubt, stick to the standard 60 grams for 4 tbsp in recipes from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>.</p>

faqQ1: "Can I use a regular spoon to measure 1.5 tbsp of Nutella?"
faqA1: "While you can use a regular spoon, it’s not as accurate as a measuring tablespoon. For best results, use proper measuring spoons or a digital scale to ensure you get exactly 28 grams of Nutella. This is especially important in air fryer recipes where precision matters."
faqQ2: "Why does Nutella’s weight vary slightly in different conversions?"
faqA2: "Nutella’s density can vary slightly depending on temperature and how it’s packed into the spoon. At room temperature, it’s easier to measure accurately. The 28-gram measurement for 1.5 tbsp is an average, but a digital scale will always give you the most precise result."
faqQ3: "How can I measure Nutella without making a mess?"
faqA3: "To measure Nutella cleanly, lightly grease your spoon or spatula with oil first. This helps the Nutella slide off easily. You can also warm the spoon slightly under hot water before scooping. Always wipe the rim of the jar to keep it clean for next time."
faqQ4: "Can I substitute other chocolate spreads for Nutella in air fryer recipes?"
faqA4: "Yes, you can substitute other chocolate spreads, but check their weight per tablespoon as it may differ. Some spreads are thicker or thinner than Nutella, which could affect your recipe. Always measure by weight (grams) for the most consistent results in air fryer cooking."

faqQ1: "Can I use a US tablespoon to measure quinoa in the UK?"
faqA1: "No, US tablespoons are slightly larger (14.8ml) compared to UK tablespoons (15ml). For accuracy, use a UK tablespoon or weigh 25 grams for 2 tbsp of quinoa."
faqQ2: "Does cooked quinoa weigh the same as uncooked?"
faqA2: "No, cooked quinoa absorbs water and expands, so 25 grams of uncooked quinoa yields about 75 grams cooked. Adjust measurements based on whether your recipe uses raw or cooked quinoa."
faqQ3: "How do I convert quinoa from cups to grams?"
faqA3: "1 UK cup of uncooked quinoa weighs around 180 grams. For 2 tbsp (25g), you’d need roughly 1/7 of a cup. Use a kitchen scale for the most precise results."
faqQ4: "Can I air fry quinoa without pre-cooking it?"
faqA4: "Yes, but it’s best to rinse and pre-cook quinoa slightly for even results. Spread 25 grams in the air fryer basket and cook at 180°C for 5–7 minutes, shaking halfway."

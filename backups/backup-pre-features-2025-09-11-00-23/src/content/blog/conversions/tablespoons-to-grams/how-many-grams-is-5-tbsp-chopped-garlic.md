faqQ1: "Can I use minced garlic instead of chopped garlic for the same weight?"
faqA1: "Yes, minced garlic can be used in place of chopped garlic, but the texture will be finer. The weight remains roughly the same—5 tbsp of minced garlic is also about 75g. Just note that minced garlic may distribute more evenly in dishes."
faqQ2: "How do I convert 5 tbsp of chopped garlic to cloves?"
faqA2: "One medium garlic clove yields about 1 tsp of chopped garlic. Since there are 3 tsp in 1 tbsp, 5 tbsp would equal roughly 15 cloves. However, clove sizes vary, so weighing is more accurate."
faqQ3: "Does the type of garlic affect the weight measurement?"
faqA3: "Fresh garlic, pre-chopped jarred garlic, and frozen garlic may have slight weight differences due to moisture content or added ingredients. Always weigh for precision, especially in air fryer cooking where consistency matters."
faqQ4: "Can I reduce the garlic in a recipe without affecting the dish?"
faqA4: "Yes, you can reduce the garlic quantity, but adjust other seasonings to balance the flavour. Start with 1-2 tbsp less and taste as you go. Air fryers concentrate flavours, so a little goes a long way."

<p>5 tablespoons (tbsp) of chopped garlic equals approximately 75 grams (g). This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements can make all the difference in flavour and texture.</p>

<h2>Why accurate garlic measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of garlic ensures your dishes are perfectly seasoned without overpowering other ingredients. In an air fryer, ingredients cook quickly, so precise measurements prevent burnt or unevenly cooked garlic. Too much garlic can also leave a bitter taste, while too little might not deliver the desired flavour punch.

<p>Garlic is a staple in many air fryer recipes, from roasted vegetables to marinated meats. Knowing the exact weight helps you follow recipes accurately, especially when scaling up or down. Whether you’re making garlic butter shrimp or crispy garlic potatoes, 5 tbsp of chopped garlic (75g) will give you consistent results every time.</p>  

<h3>How to measure chopped garlic correctly</h3>  
<p>For the most accurate measurement, use a kitchen scale to weigh your chopped garlic. If you don’t have one, lightly pack the garlic into the tablespoon without pressing too hard. Avoid heaping tablespoons, as this can lead to uneven measurements.

<h3>Adjusting garlic quantities for different dishes</h3>

<h2>Tips for storing chopped garlic</h2>

faqQ1: "Is 4 tbsp of garlic paste the same as 4 cloves of garlic?"
faqA1: "No, 4 tbsp of garlic paste (about 60g) is much more concentrated than 4 cloves. Typically, 1 clove yields about ½ tsp paste, so 4 tbsp would equal roughly 24 cloves. For milder flavour, reduce the amount when substituting paste for fresh cloves in air fryer recipes."
faqQ2: "Can I use minced garlic instead of garlic paste in my air fryer?"
faqA2: "Yes, but adjust the quantity. Minced garlic is less concentrated than paste—use about 1.5 times the volume. For 4 tbsp paste (60g), substitute 6 tbsp minced garlic. Spread it evenly over ingredients to prevent burning in the air fryer's intense heat."
faqQ3: "Why does my air fryer recipe taste too garlicky even with 4 tbsp paste?"
faqA3: "Air fryers circulate hot air, which can intensify garlic's pungency. Try reducing to 3 tbsp (45g) next time. Also, mix the paste with oil or other liquids to distribute flavour more evenly. Preheating your air fryer can prevent raw garlic tastes."
faqQ4: "How do I convert US tablespoons to UK grams for garlic paste?"
faqA4: "UK and US tablespoons are nearly identical (15ml vs 14.8ml), so the 4 tbsp = 60g conversion works for both. However, always check your tablespoon's volume if it's not standard. When precision matters, weighing in grams eliminates measurement discrepancies."

<p>4 tablespoons (tbsp) of garlic paste is approximately 60 grams (g). This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements can make or break a dish. Whether you're whipping up a marinade or seasoning your ingredients, knowing the exact weight ensures consistency.

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>
<p>Air fryers rely on even heat distribution, so ingredient ratios must be spot-on. Too much garlic paste can overpower a dish, while too little might leave it bland. Measuring by weight (grams) is more reliable than volume (tablespoons) because it accounts for density variations. This is especially true for pastes, which can settle or vary in texture. For perfectly balanced flavours, always weigh your garlic paste when possible.</p>
<p>If you're new to air fryer cooking, browse our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a> for inspiration. Many dishes, from garlic butter shrimp to roasted vegetables, benefit from precise garlic paste measurements. Consistent results start with accurate conversions like 4 tbsp garlic paste to grams.</p>

<h2>How to measure 4 tbsp of garlic paste correctly</h2>
<p>To measure 4 tablespoons of garlic paste, use a standard UK tablespoon (15ml per tbsp). Level off each spoonful with a straight edge for accuracy. If your recipe calls for grams, a kitchen scale is your best friend. Simply tare your bowl, then add garlic paste until it reads 60g. This method eliminates guesswork and ensures your <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>garlic chicken recipes</a> turn out perfectly every time.</p>

<h3>Common mistakes when converting tbsp to grams</h3>
<p>Many cooks pack garlic paste into the tablespoon, which increases the weight beyond 60g. Others use heaped spoonfuls, leading to inconsistent results. Always measure level tablespoons unless specified otherwise. Also, note that different brands of garlic paste may vary slightly in density. When in doubt, weigh it out for precision.</p>

<h2>Garlic paste conversions for other quantities</h2>
<p>Need more or less than 4 tbsp? Here's a quick reference: 1 tbsp garlic paste = 15g, 2 tbsp = 30g, and 3 tbsp = 45g. These conversions work for most UK garlic paste brands. For larger batches, remember that 8 tbsp (½ cup) equals about 120g.

<p>These measurements are particularly useful when preparing <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>garlic-roasted vegetables</a> in your air fryer. The right amount of garlic paste ensures flavour without overwhelming the natural taste of your veggies.</p>

<h3>Storing leftover garlic paste</h3>
<p>After measuring your 4 tbsp (60g), store any remaining garlic paste in an airtight container in the fridge. It typically keeps for 2-3 weeks. For longer storage, freeze portions in ice cube trays—each cube holds about 1 tbsp (15g). This makes future measurements a breeze and reduces waste. Always label containers with dates and weights for easy reference.</p>

<h2>Adjusting air fryer recipes with garlic paste</h2>
<p>When adapting conventional oven recipes for your air fryer, garlic paste quantities may need tweaking. Air fryers intensify flavours, so you might use slightly less than the original recipe suggests. Start with ¾ of the amount (about 45g for 4 tbsp) and adjust to taste. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> team recommends tasting as you go when working with potent ingredients like garlic paste.</p>

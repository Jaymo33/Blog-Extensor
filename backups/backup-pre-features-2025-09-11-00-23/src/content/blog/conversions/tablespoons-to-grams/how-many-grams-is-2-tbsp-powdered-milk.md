faqQ1: "Can I use liquid milk instead of powdered milk in air fryer recipes?"
faqA1: "Yes, but you’ll need to adjust the recipe. Replace 2 tbsp powdered milk (14g) with about 120ml of liquid milk. Keep in mind this adds extra moisture, so reduce other liquids slightly. For baked goods, stick to powdered milk if the recipe calls for it, as it provides better structure."
faqQ2: "Why do some recipes list powdered milk in tablespoons instead of grams?"
faqA2: "Tablespoons are more accessible for home cooks without scales, but grams are more precise. If a recipe lists 2 tbsp powdered milk, it’s safe to assume 14 grams. For accuracy, especially in baking, always weigh ingredients when possible."
faqQ3: "How should I store powdered milk for air fryer cooking?"
faqA3: "Keep powdered milk in an airtight container in a cool, dark place. Moisture is its enemy, so avoid storing it near the stove or sink. Properly stored, it lasts up to a year. For longer shelf life, refrigerate it."
faqQ4: "Does 2 tbsp powdered milk work the same in all air fryer models?"
faqA4: "Yes, the measurement (14g) is consistent across air fryers. However, cooking times may vary by model. Always check doneness a few minutes early, especially with new recipes. For model-specific tips, visit <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>."

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on even heat distribution, so ingredient ratios must be spot-on. Too much or too little powdered milk can affect browning, moisture, and rise in baked goods. For example, adding extra powdered milk to a cake batter might make it denser. On the flip side, skimping could leave your dish dry. That’s why converting 2 tbsp powdered milk to grams (14g) is a game-changer for consistency.</p>  

<p>Many air fryer recipes, like our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>popular dessert collection</a>, call for powdered milk for richness. Whether you're making custards or breading for fried chicken, precise measurements ensure reliable results every time. A digital kitchen scale is your best friend here—skip the guesswork and measure directly in grams.</p>  

<h3>How to measure powdered milk without a scale</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a scale, use the spoon-and-level method for 2 tbsp powdered milk. Fluff the powder first, then spoon it into a measuring tablespoon without packing it down. Level off the excess with a straight edge for an accurate 14-gram equivalent. This method works well for most <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert recipes</a> where precision matters.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for powdered milk in air fryer recipes</h2>  
<p>Powdered milk is a versatile ingredient in air frying. It’s often used in breading mixes for crispy coatings, like in fried chicken or fish. It also enhances the texture of baked goods, such as scones or muffins, by adding protein and fat. For a creamy twist, try adding 2 tbsp (14g) to mashed potatoes or soups made in your air fryer.</p>  

<p>Another great use is in homemade seasoning blends. Combine powdered milk with herbs and spices for a quick dry rub.

<h3>Does brand affect the weight of powdered milk?</h3>  
<p>Most powdered milk brands have similar densities, so 2 tbsp should still weigh around 14 grams. However, if your brand is particularly fine or clumpy, it’s worth double-checking with a scale. For best results, stick to the same brand once you’ve nailed a recipe. Need to clean your air fryer after testing?

faqQ2: "How do I convert 182 fan oven to air fryer temperature?"
faqA2: "For air fryers, start by converting 182°C fan to 160°C conventional, then reduce by another 10°C. This accounts for the air fryer's even faster cooking speed."
faqQ3: "Why do I need to adjust the temperature from fan to conventional oven?"
faqA3: "Fan ovens circulate hot air, cooking food faster and more evenly. Reducing the temperature prevents overcooking when using a conventional oven or air fryer."
faqQ4: "Can I use the same cooking time when converting 182 fan oven to conventional?"

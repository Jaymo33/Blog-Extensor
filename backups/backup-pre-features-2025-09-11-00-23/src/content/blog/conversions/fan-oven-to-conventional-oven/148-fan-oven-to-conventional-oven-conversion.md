<h2>Why Convert 148 Fan Oven to Conventional Oven?</h2>
<p>Many modern recipes, especially those on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, use fan oven temperatures.

This is particularly important for air fryer users who often need to adjust temperatures.</p>
<p>Fan ovens circulate hot air, cooking food faster and more evenly. Conventional ovens rely on natural heat distribution, which can lead to uneven cooking. Converting 148 fan oven to celsius for a conventional oven helps maintain recipe integrity.

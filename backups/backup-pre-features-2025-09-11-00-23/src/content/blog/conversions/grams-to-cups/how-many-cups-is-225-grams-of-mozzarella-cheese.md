faqQ1: "Does the type of mozzarella affect the cup measurement for 225 grams?"
faqA1: "Yes, fresh mozzarella (like bocconcini) has a higher water content and will measure differently than low-moisture shredded mozzarella. For 225 grams, fresh mozzarella may fill slightly more than 2.25 cups due to its softer texture. Always opt for shredded when precision matters in air fryer recipes."
faqQ2: "Can I use pre-shredded mozzarella for air fryer recipes calling for 225 grams?"
faqA2: "Pre-shredded mozzarella works well, but it often contains anti-caking agents that can affect meltability. For best results in air fryer dishes like pizzas or melts, shredding your own cheese from a block ensures smoother melting. Either way, 225 grams equals about 2.25 cups when lightly packed."
faqQ3: "How should I store leftover mozzarella after measuring 225 grams?"
faqA3: "Wrap unused mozzarella tightly in cling film or store it in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 3 days. For longer storage, freeze shredded mozzarella in portions—just note that frozen cheese may be crumblier when thawed, so it’s best used in cooked dishes like air fryer casseroles."
faqQ4: "Why does my air fryer recipe sometimes turn out too greasy with 225 grams of mozzarella?"
faqA4: "Mozzarella releases oil as it melts, especially in high-heat air fryers. To prevent greasiness, blot excess oil from the cheese before cooking or opt for part-skim mozzarella. Also, ensure your air fryer isn’t overcrowded, as proper air circulation helps crisp the cheese without pooling fat."

faqQ1: "Is 225 grams of brown sugar the same as 1 cup?"
faqA1: "No, 225 grams of brown sugar is roughly 1.1 cups when lightly packed. A standard cup of packed brown sugar weighs about 200 grams, so 225 grams is slightly more. Always check your recipe for specific packing instructions."
faqQ2: "How do I measure 225 grams of brown sugar without scales?"
faqA2: "If you don’t have scales, lightly spoon brown sugar into a measuring cup until it’s slightly heaped (about 1.1 cups). Avoid packing it down unless the recipe specifies. For accuracy, consider investing in a kitchen scale for air fryer baking."
faqQ3: "Does brown sugar type (light vs. dark) affect the cup measurement?"
faqA3: "Light and dark brown sugar have similar densities, so 225 grams of either will equal roughly 1.1 cups. However, dark brown sugar has a stronger molasses flavour, which may impact your recipe’s taste rather than its measurement."
faqQ4: "Can I use granulated sugar instead of brown sugar in air fryer recipes?"
faqA4: "You can substitute granulated sugar, but the texture and flavour will differ. Brown sugar adds moisture and a caramel-like taste. If swapping, use 1 cup of granulated sugar for every 1.1 cups of brown sugar (225 grams) and adjust liquids slightly."

<p>225 grams of brown sugar is roughly equivalent to 1.1 cups when lightly packed. This measurement is essential for baking, especially when using an air fryer for desserts like cookies or cakes. Getting the right amount ensures your recipes turn out perfectly every time. Whether you're following a British or American recipe, this conversion will help you avoid guesswork.

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Using the correct amount of brown sugar can make or break your recipe. Too much can lead to overly sweet or dense results, while too little may leave your baked goods lacking flavour. Air fryer recipes, in particular, rely on precise measurements due to their compact cooking environment. If you're converting grams to cups, always consider whether the sugar is packed or loose. For a handy reference, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> covers all common ingredients.</p>  

<p>Brown sugar has a unique texture that affects its volume. Unlike granulated sugar, it clumps together, meaning a cup of packed brown sugar weighs more than a loosely filled one. This is why weighing ingredients is often more reliable than using cup measurements. However, if you don’t have scales, knowing that 225 grams equals about 1.1 cups is a great starting point.

<h3>How to Measure Brown Sugar Correctly</h3>  
<p>To measure 225 grams of brown sugar in cups, lightly spoon the sugar into a measuring cup without packing it down. Then level it off with a knife for an accurate reading. If your recipe calls for packed brown sugar, press it firmly into the cup to eliminate air gaps. This method ensures consistency, whether you're baking cookies or making a glaze for air-fried desserts. For more precision, invest in a digital kitchen scale—it’s a game-changer for air fryer cooking.</p>  

<h2>Converting Grams to Cups for Different Sugars</h2>  
<p>Not all sugars weigh the same, so conversions vary. For example, 225 grams of granulated sugar equals about 1.1 cups, while powdered sugar is closer to 1.8 cups due to its finer texture. Brown sugar falls somewhere in between because of its moisture content. If you're adapting a recipe for your air fryer, always double-check the type of sugar used. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a> simplifies this process for all your baking needs.</p>  

<p>When working with air fryers, even small measurement errors can affect cooking times and textures. That’s why we recommend weighing ingredients whenever possible. If you’re in a pinch, though, remember that 225 grams of brown sugar is approximately 1.1 cups.

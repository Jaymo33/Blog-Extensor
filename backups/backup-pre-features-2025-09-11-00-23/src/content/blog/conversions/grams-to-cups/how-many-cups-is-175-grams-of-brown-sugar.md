faqQ1: "Does packed or loose brown sugar affect the cup measurement for 175 grams?"
faqA1: "Yes! Packed brown sugar can weigh up to 220 grams per cup, while loosely filled cups may only hold 160 grams. For 175 grams, lightly spoon sugar into the cup and level it off for accuracy."
faqQ2: "Can I use white sugar instead of brown sugar in air fryer recipes?"

faqQ3: "Why does my air fryer recipe taste too sweet with 175 grams of brown sugar?"
faqA3: "Overpacking the cups can add extra sugar. Always measure by weight (grams) for precision, or fluff the sugar before lightly filling the cup."
faqQ4: "How do I store leftover brown sugar after measuring 175 grams?"
faqA4: "Keep it in an airtight container with a slice of bread to prevent hardening. For long-term storage, freeze it—thaw before using in your next air fryer recipe."

<p>175 grams of brown sugar is approximately 0.85 cups when lightly packed. If you're using an air fryer for baking or cooking, getting measurements right is key to perfect results.

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Recipes</h2>  
<p>Air fryers cook food quickly and evenly, but precision in ingredients ensures consistency. Too much or too little brown sugar can affect texture and sweetness in cakes, cookies, or glazes. For example, a <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>cake recipe</a> with 175 grams of brown sugar requires the right cup measurement to avoid dryness or excessive moisture. Always measure brown sugar by lightly spooning it into a cup and levelling it off for accuracy.</p>  

<p>Many air fryer recipes, like sticky toffee puddings or BBQ sauces, rely on brown sugar for depth of flavour. Converting 175 grams of brown sugar to cups correctly ensures your dish isn’t overly sweet or lacking richness.

<h3>How to Measure 175 Grams of Brown Sugar Without Scales</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have scales, use the spoon-and-level method for the most accurate 175g brown sugar to cups conversion. Fill your measuring cup loosely with brown sugar, then level it with a knife. Avoid packing it down, as this can add up to 20% more sugar than intended. For recipes needing precision, like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cookies>cookies</a>, this method prevents dough from spreading too much or becoming overly dense.</p>  

<h2>US vs UK Cup Measurements for Brown Sugar</h2>  
<p>While 175 grams of brown sugar equals roughly 0.85 cups in the UK, US cup sizes differ slightly due to volume variations. If following a US-based air fryer recipe, double-check whether their cups are measured differently. Most modern recipes standardise measurements, but older ones may require adjustments.

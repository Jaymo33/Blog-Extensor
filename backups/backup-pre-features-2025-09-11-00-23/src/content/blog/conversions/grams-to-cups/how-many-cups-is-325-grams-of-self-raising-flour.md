faqQ1: "How do I measure 325 grams of self-raising flour without a scale?"
faqA1: "If you don't have a scale, you can use the spoon-and-level method. Lightly spoon the flour into a measuring cup until it's slightly heaped, then level it off with a knife. For 325 grams, you'll need approximately 2.6 cups of self-raising flour. Keep in mind that this method is less precise than using a scale."
faqQ2: "Does the type of cup affect the conversion of 325 grams of self-raising flour?"
faqA2: "Yes, the type of cup can affect the conversion. A UK cup holds 250ml, while a US cup holds 240ml. This slight difference means 325 grams of self-raising flour is roughly 2.6 UK cups or 2.7 US cups. Always check which cup measurement your recipe uses for the best results."
faqQ3: "Can I use plain flour instead of self-raising flour for 325 grams?"
faqA3: "You can substitute plain flour for self-raising flour, but you'll need to add baking powder. For every 325 grams of plain flour, add 2 teaspoons of baking powder and sift them together. This ensures your baked goods rise properly, just like with self-raising flour."
faqQ4: "How does 325 grams of self-raising flour affect air fryer baking?"
faqA4: "In an air fryer, 325 grams of self-raising flour behaves similarly to oven baking, but cooking times may be shorter. The hot, circulating air helps the flour rise evenly, so precise measurements are crucial. Always preheat your air fryer and check recipes for adjusted timings."

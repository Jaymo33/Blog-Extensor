faqQ1: "Does 150 grams of butter equal 2/3 cup in both UK and US measurements?"
faqA1: "Yes, 150 grams of butter is approximately 2/3 cup in both UK and US cup measurements. The slight variance in cup sizes between regions doesn’t significantly affect butter conversions due to its consistent density."
faqQ2: "Can I use margarine instead of butter for air fryer recipes?"
faqA2: "While margarine can substitute butter, it has a higher water content, which may affect texture in air fryer baking. For best results, stick to butter or reduce margarine by 10% to account for excess moisture."
faqQ3: "How do I measure 150 grams of butter without scales?"
faqA3: "If you don’t have scales, use the markings on a standard butter block (usually 250g). Cut off roughly three-fifths of the block to get close to 150g, then refine with a measuring cup for precision."
faqQ4: "Why does my air fryer smoke when using butter?"
faqA4: "Butter has a low smoke point. To prevent smoking, use clarified butter or reduce the quantity slightly. Always preheat your air fryer and avoid letting butter drip onto the heating element."

<p>150 grams of butter is roughly 2/3 cup (0.66 cups) in both UK and US measurements. Whether you're baking a cake or preparing a savoury dish in your air fryer, getting the butter measurement right ensures perfect results every time. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we know precise conversions make all the difference in cooking.</p>

<h2>Understanding Butter Measurements</h2>  
<p>Butter can be tricky to measure, especially when switching between grams and cups. For 150 grams of butter, the conversion is straightforward: it’s just under 3/4 cup. This applies to both unsalted and salted butter, as density remains consistent. If you’re using an air fryer for recipes like cookies or cakes, accuracy ensures even cooking. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for other common ingredient swaps.</p>  

<p>In the UK, butter is often sold in 250g blocks, making it easy to measure 150g by eye. Simply divide the block into roughly three equal parts, then take two. For air fryer recipes, softened butter blends better with other ingredients, so measure after bringing it to room temperature. Need inspiration?

<h3>Why 150 Grams of Butter Matters in Air Frying</h3>

<h2>Converting 150g Butter to Cups: Step by Step</h2>  
<p>To convert 150 grams of butter to cups, use a kitchen scale for precision. If you don’t have one, spoon softened butter into a measuring cup, ensuring no air pockets. Level it off with a knife for accuracy. For air fryer recipes like shortbread or pastry, this method prevents uneven textures. Prefer visual guides?

<h3>Common Mistakes When Measuring Butter</h3>  
<p>Packing butter into a cup compresses it, leading to over-measurement. Instead, gently fill the cup and level it. For air fryer recipes, melted butter should be measured after melting, not before. This avoids discrepancies in volume. Always use standardised cups, not mugs or teacups, for reliable conversions.</p>

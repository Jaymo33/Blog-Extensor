faqQ1: "Does the type of yogurt affect the cup measurement for 400 grams?"
faqA1: "Yes, thicker yogurts like Greek or Icelandic have a higher density, so 400 grams may take up slightly less volume in cups compared to regular yogurt. Always check the recipe for the recommended yogurt type and adjust measurements if needed. For precise results, weigh the yogurt instead of relying solely on cup conversions."
faqQ2: "Can I use 400 grams of yogurt in savoury air fryer recipes?"
faqA2: "Absolutely! Yogurt works well in marinades for chicken, lamb, or vegetables, tenderising and adding flavour. When converting 400 grams of yogurt to cups for savoury dishes, follow the same measurement guidelines. Yogurt also makes a great base for dips or sauces served with air-fried snacks."
faqQ3: "How do I convert 400 grams of yogurt to cups if my recipe uses millilitres?"
faqA3: "Since yogurt’s density varies, 400 grams is roughly equivalent to 400 ml for regular yogurt. For thicker varieties, it may be closer to 380 ml. Use a liquid measuring cup for millilitre conversions, and remember that US and UK millilitre measurements are the same, simplifying the process."
faqQ4: "Why do my air fryer baked goods turn out dense when using yogurt?"
faqA4: "Over-measuring yogurt can add excess moisture, leading to dense textures. Ensure you’re accurately converting 400 grams of yogurt to cups (about 1.6-1.7 cups) and not packing the yogurt into the cup. Also, check your baking powder or soda isn’t expired, as these help counter yogurt’s acidity for a better rise."

faqQ1: "Is 300 grams of honey the same in UK and US cups?"
faqA1: "No, due to slight differences in cup sizes. In the UK, 300 grams of honey equals roughly 0.88 cups, while in the US, it’s about 0.79 cups. Always check which measurement system your recipe uses for accuracy."
faqQ2: "Can I use a liquid measuring cup for honey?"
faqA2: "Yes, but honey’s thickness makes it tricky. Lightly grease the cup or warm the honey first for easier pouring. For precision, a kitchen scale is best, especially for air fryer recipes where exact measurements matter."
faqQ3: "Why does my air fryer smoke when cooking with honey?"
faqA3: "Excess honey can drip onto the heating element, causing smoke. Stick to the recommended 300-gram conversion and spread glazes evenly. Always monitor cooking and clean your air fryer after sticky recipes."
faqQ4: "How do I store leftover honey after measuring 300 grams?"
faqA4: "Keep honey in an airtight container at room temperature. Avoid refrigeration, as it can crystallise. If needed, gently warm crystallised honey in a water bath before reusing in recipes."

<p>300 grams of honey is roughly equivalent to 0.88 cups in the UK and 0.79 cups in the US. This conversion is essential for precise baking and cooking, especially when using an air fryer. Whether you're whipping up a glaze or sweetening a marinade, knowing how many cups 300 grams of honey equals ensures perfect results every time.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Honey Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Honey is a staple in many recipes, from cakes to glazes, and its thick consistency means small measurement errors can impact texture and taste. For air fryer recipes, precision is key—too much honey can cause sticking or uneven cooking, while too little might leave dishes bland. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we emphasise accurate conversions to help you nail every dish.</p>  

<p>Honey’s density varies slightly depending on temperature and type, but 300 grams generally fills just under a cup. This makes it crucial to measure correctly, especially when adapting recipes for air fryers. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more handy measurement tips.</p>  

<h2>UK vs. US Cup Measurements for Honey</h2>  
<p>In the UK, a standard cup holds 250ml, while in the US, it’s 240ml. This slight difference means 300 grams of honey equals approximately 0.88 UK cups or 0.79 US cups. If you’re following a recipe from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>our collection</a>, always check which measurement system it uses.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure Honey Without Scales</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have scales, use the spoon-and-level method. Fill a measuring cup with honey, then level it off with a knife. Remember, honey’s stickiness can make this tricky, so lightly greasing the cup helps. For air fryer recipes, consistency matters—so weigh whenever possible.</p>  

<h2>Using 300 Grams of Honey in Air Fryer Recipes</h2>  
<p>Honey works wonders in air fryer dishes, from glazed chicken to sticky desserts. For example, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>honey-glazed chicken</a> uses 300 grams of honey for the perfect balance of sweetness and crispiness. Always measure carefully to avoid overpowering flavours or messy clean-ups.</p>

<h3>Common Mistakes When Measuring Honey</h3>

faqQ1: "Does 475 grams of chicken breast equal the same amount in cups when cooked?"
faqA1: "No, cooked chicken breast shrinks slightly due to moisture loss. While 475 grams of raw chicken breast equals about 2.5 cups, the cooked volume will be slightly less. Always measure raw chicken for the most accurate results in recipes."

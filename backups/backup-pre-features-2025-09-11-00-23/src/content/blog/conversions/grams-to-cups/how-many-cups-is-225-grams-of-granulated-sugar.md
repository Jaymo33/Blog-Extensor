faqQ1: "Is 225 grams of granulated sugar the same as caster sugar in cups?"
faqA1: "No, granulated and caster sugar have different densities. While 225 grams of granulated sugar equals about 1.13 UK cups, caster sugar is finer, so it measures slightly more per cup. Always check specific conversions if substituting sugars in recipes."
faqQ2: "Can I use brown sugar instead of granulated sugar in the same measurement?"
faqA2: "Brown sugar is denser due to its moisture content, so 225 grams will fill slightly less cup space. If substituting, pack it lightly into the cup or weigh it for accuracy. The flavour will also differ, adding a caramel note to your dish."
faqQ3: "How do I store leftover granulated sugar after measuring?"
faqA3: "Keep granulated sugar in an airtight container in a cool, dry place. This prevents clumping and moisture absorption, ensuring it stays fresh for future baking. Avoid storing near strong-smelling foods, as sugar can absorb odours."
faqQ4: "Why does my air fryer dessert taste too sweet with 225 grams of sugar?"
faqA4: "Air fryers cook faster than conventional ovens, sometimes intensifying sweetness. Try reducing sugar by 10-15% for air fryer recipes. Also, check if your recipe was designed for traditional baking, as adjustments may be needed for air fryer use."

<p>225 grams of granulated sugar is approximately 1.13 cups in the UK or 1.06 cups in the US. This conversion is essential for baking and cooking, especially when using an air fryer for desserts. Whether you're making cookies, cakes, or sweet treats, getting the measurement right ensures perfect results every time.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Sugar Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Granulated sugar is a staple in baking, and even small measurement errors can affect texture and taste. Too much sugar can make desserts overly sweet or cause uneven browning in your air fryer. Too little can leave them dry or lacking flavour. For consistent results, always measure carefully, especially when adapting recipes for air fryer cooking.</p>  
<p>If you're using an <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipe</a>, precise sugar measurements help avoid burnt edges or undercooked centres. Many air fryer desserts, like muffins or sponge cakes, rely on the right sugar ratio for the perfect rise and crumb.

<h2>UK vs. US Cup Measurements</h2>  
<p>In the UK, a standard cup holds 250ml, while in the US, it's 240ml. This slight difference means 225 grams of granulated sugar equals roughly 1.13 UK cups or 1.06 US cups. If you're following an American recipe, adjust accordingly to avoid discrepancies in sweetness and texture.</p>  
<p>For air fryer baking, consistency is key. Whether you're making <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>air fryer cakes</a> or cookies, knowing the exact conversion ensures your treats turn out just right. Always use a kitchen scale for the most accurate results, especially when working with granulated sugar.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure Granulated Sugar Without Scales</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have scales, spoon granulated sugar into a measuring cup and level it off with a knife. Avoid packing it down, as this can lead to excess sugar. For 225 grams, you’ll need just over one cup (UK) or slightly less (US). Keep in mind that this method is less precise than weighing, so results may vary slightly.</p>  

<h2>Common Recipes Using 225 Grams of Granulated Sugar</h2>  
<p>Many classic desserts call for around 225 grams of granulated sugar. This includes Victoria sponge, shortbread, and air fryer brownies. If you're experimenting with <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cookies>air fryer cookies</a>, this measurement is often perfect for a batch of 12-15.</p>  
<p>For those who love fruity desserts, 225 grams of sugar works well in air fryer apple crumbles or berry cobblers. The sugar balances tartness and enhances caramelisation, giving your treats a golden finish.

<h3>Adjusting Sugar for Healthier Baking</h3>  
<p>If you're cutting back on sugar, you can reduce the amount slightly, but be mindful of texture changes. Sugar adds moisture, so reducing it may require adjusting other ingredients. For air fryer baking, a small decrease (e.g., 200 grams instead of 225) usually works without major issues.</p>

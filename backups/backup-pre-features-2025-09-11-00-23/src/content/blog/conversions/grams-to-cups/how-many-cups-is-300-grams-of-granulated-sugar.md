faqQ1: "Is 300 grams of granulated sugar the same in US and UK cups?"
faqA1: "Yes, 300 grams of granulated sugar equals roughly 1.5 cups in both US and UK measurements. The slight difference in cup sizes between the two systems is negligible for granulated sugar, as its density remains consistent."
faqQ2: "Can I use a regular measuring cup for 300 grams of granulated sugar?"
faqA2: "While a measuring cup works, a kitchen scale is more accurate for 300 grams of granulated sugar. If using a cup, fluff the sugar first and spoon it in lightly without packing. Level it off for the best results."
faqQ3: "How does 300 grams of granulated sugar affect air fryer baking?"
faqA3: "In air fryer baking, 300 grams of granulated sugar must be measured precisely to avoid over-browning or uneven cooking. The air fryer’s intense heat means sugar caramelises faster, so exact quantities are crucial."
faqQ4: "What if I don’t have 300 grams of granulated sugar for a recipe?"
faqA4: "If you’re short, you can reduce the sugar slightly, but expect texture changes. Alternatively, use a substitute like honey or maple syrup, adjusting liquids accordingly. For best results, stick to the original measurement."

<p>300 grams of granulated sugar equals approximately 1.5 cups when measured correctly. This conversion is essential for baking and cooking, especially when using an air fryer for desserts like cakes or cookies. Getting the measurement right ensures your recipes turn out perfectly every time.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Sugar Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Granulated sugar is a staple in baking, and even a slight variation can affect texture and taste. Too much sugar can make desserts overly sweet or cause them to brown too quickly in the air fryer. Too little, and your baked goods might turn out dry or lack flavour. That’s why knowing how many cups 300 grams of granulated sugar equals is so important.</p>  
<p>For air fryer recipes, precision is key because the cooking environment is more compact than a conventional oven. A well-measured 300 grams of granulated sugar ensures even cooking and perfect results. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more handy measurement tips.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure 300 Grams of Granulated Sugar</h3>  
<p>To measure 300 grams of granulated sugar accurately, use a kitchen scale for the most precise results. If you don’t have one, fluff the sugar with a spoon before lightly spooning it into a measuring cup. Avoid packing it down, as this can lead to an incorrect measurement. Level off the top with a straight edge for consistency.</p>  

<h2>Converting Grams to Cups for Different Sugars</h2>  
<p>While 300 grams of granulated sugar equals roughly 1.5 cups, other types of sugar may differ. Brown sugar, for example, is denser and may require slightly less volume for the same weight. Powdered sugar, on the other hand, is lighter and fluffier, meaning 300 grams would take up more space in a cup.</p>  
<p>If you’re adapting a recipe for your air fryer, always double-check the type of sugar specified. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipes section</a> includes plenty of air fryer-friendly desserts that use granulated sugar perfectly.</p>  

<h3>Common Mistakes When Measuring Sugar</h3>  
<p>One of the biggest mistakes is scooping sugar directly from the bag with a measuring cup, which compacts it and leads to excess. Another is using a liquid measuring cup instead of a dry one, which can throw off accuracy. Always use the right tools for the best results.</p>  

<h2>Adjusting Recipes for Air Fryer Baking</h2>  
<p>When converting traditional oven recipes for the air fryer, measurements like 300 grams of granulated sugar must be spot-on. The air fryer’s rapid circulation means ingredients cook faster, so proportions matter even more. Too much sugar can cause excessive caramelisation or burning.</p>  
<p>For perfectly balanced treats, browse our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>cake recipes</a> designed specifically for air fryers. Each one ensures the right sugar ratio for flawless results.</p>  

<h3>Storing Granulated Sugar for Freshness</h3>  
<p>Keep your granulated sugar in an airtight container to prevent clumping or moisture absorption. This ensures your 300 grams measure accurately every time. Proper storage also maintains the sugar’s quality, so your air fryer desserts taste their best.</p>  

<h2>Scaling Recipes Up or Down</h2>  
<p>If a recipe calls for 300 grams of granulated sugar but you need to adjust the quantity, simply scale the cups proportionally. For example, 150 grams would be about 0.75 cups, while 600 grams would be roughly 3 cups. This flexibility is great for batch cooking or smaller servings in the air fryer.</p>

<h3>Using Sugar Substitutes in Air Fryer Recipes</h3>  
<p>If you’re swapping granulated sugar for alternatives like stevia or erythritol, check the conversion rates, as they vary by brand. Some substitutes are sweeter than sugar, so you’ll need less. Always test small batches in your air fryer to avoid unexpected results.</p>

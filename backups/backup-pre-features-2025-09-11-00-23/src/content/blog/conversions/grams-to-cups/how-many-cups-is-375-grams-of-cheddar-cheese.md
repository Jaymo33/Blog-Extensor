faqQ1: "Can I use pre-shredded cheese instead of grating 375 grams myself?"
faqA1: "Yes, but pre-shredded cheese often contains anti-caking agents that affect meltability. For best results in air fryer recipes, freshly grating 375 grams of cheddar cheese ensures smoother texture and better flavour distribution."
faqQ2: "How does the cup measurement change if my cheddar cheese is in blocks?"
faqA2: "Block cheese is less dense when cubed—375 grams equals about 4.2 US cups loosely packed. For accuracy, we recommend grating or weighing it. If cubing, press gently into the measuring cup without compacting."
faqQ3: "Why does my air fryer recipe with 375 grams of cheese turn out greasy?"
faqA3: "Air fryers circulate hot air intensely, causing cheese to release fats quickly. Try reducing to 350 grams or blotting excess oil during cooking. Leaner cheeses like reduced-fat cheddar can also help."
faqQ4: "Can I freeze measured portions of 375 grams cheddar cheese for later use?"
faqA4: "Absolutely! Portion grated 375 grams of cheddar cheese into 3.75-cup amounts, seal in freezer bags, and store for up to 3 months. Thaw in the fridge before using for best texture in cooked dishes."

faqQ1: "Is 125 grams of cheddar cheese the same as 1 cup?"
faqA1: "No, 125 grams of cheddar cheese is roughly 1.25 cups when grated. The exact volume depends on how the cheese is prepared—grated, cubed, or shredded. Always use a kitchen scale for the most accurate measurement."
faqQ2: "Can I use pre-shredded cheese instead of grating my own?"
faqA2: "Yes, but pre-shredded cheese often contains anti-caking agents, which can affect melting. For best results in air fryer recipes, freshly grated cheddar cheese is recommended. If using pre-shredded, adjust measurements slightly as it may be denser."
faqQ3: "How do I convert 125 grams of cheddar cheese to ounces?"
faqA3: "125 grams of cheddar cheese is approximately 4.4 ounces. This conversion is useful for recipes that use imperial measurements. A kitchen scale will give you the most precise result."
faqQ4: "Does the type of cheddar affect the cup measurement?"
faqA4: "Yes, aged cheddar is denser than mild cheddar, so 125 grams may take up slightly less space in a cup. For consistency, weigh your cheese rather than relying solely on cup measurements, especially in baking."

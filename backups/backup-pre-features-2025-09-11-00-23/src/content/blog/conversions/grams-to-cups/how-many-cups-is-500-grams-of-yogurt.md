faqQ1: "Is 500 grams of yogurt the same as 500 ml?"
faqA1: "No, 500 grams of yogurt is not the same as 500 ml. Grams measure weight, while millilitres measure volume. The exact volume depends on the yogurt's density. For example, 500 grams of thick Greek yogurt may take up less space than 500 grams of runny natural yogurt."
faqQ2: "Can I use Greek yogurt instead of natural yogurt in air fryer recipes?"
faqA2: "Yes, you can substitute Greek yogurt for natural yogurt, but adjustments may be needed. Greek yogurt is thicker, so you might need to thin it with a little water or milk to match the consistency of natural yogurt. Always check the recipe for best results."
faqQ3: "How long does 500 grams of yogurt last in the fridge?"
faqA3: "An unopened 500-gram container of yogurt typically lasts 1-2 weeks in the fridge, depending on the expiry date. Once opened, consume it within 3-5 days for the best quality. Always check for off smells or mould before using."
faqQ4: "Can I freeze 500 grams of yogurt for later use?"
faqA4: "Yes, you can freeze yogurt, but its texture may change slightly. Thaw it in the fridge and stir well before using. Frozen yogurt works best in cooked dishes like sauces or baked goods, rather than as a fresh topping."

Whether you're making a creamy dip or a fluffy cake, knowing how to convert grams to cups ensures consistent results every time.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Yogurt Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Using the correct amount of yogurt can make or break a recipe. Too much yogurt can make baked goods dense, while too little might leave them dry. For air fryer recipes, precise measurements ensure even cooking and perfect texture. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we emphasise the importance of accurate conversions for foolproof dishes.</p>  

<p>Yogurt is a versatile ingredient in both sweet and savoury dishes. From marinades to desserts, knowing how many cups 500 grams of yogurt equals helps streamline your cooking process.

<h2>UK vs. US Cup Measurements</h2>  
<p>It's important to note that UK and US cup sizes differ slightly. A UK cup holds 284 ml, while a US cup is 240 ml. This means 500 grams of yogurt equals about 1.75 UK cups or 2.1 US cups. Always check which measurement system your recipe uses to avoid mistakes.</p>  

<p>Many air fryer recipes, especially those on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>our recipe page</a>, provide measurements in both grams and cups for convenience. If you're adapting a traditional oven recipe for the air fryer, converting grams to cups ensures the right consistency.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure Yogurt Correctly</h3>  
<p>For the most accurate measurement, use a kitchen scale to weigh 500 grams of yogurt. If you don't have one, spoon the yogurt into a measuring cup and level it off with a knife. Avoid packing it down, as this can lead to over-measuring. Strained yogurt (like Greek yogurt) may require slight adjustments due to its thicker consistency.</p>

<h3>Storing Leftover Yogurt</h3>  
<p>If you don't use all 500 grams of yogurt at once, store the remainder in an airtight container in the fridge. Yogurt stays fresh for up to two weeks, but always check for signs of spoilage before using. For longer storage, consider freezing it in portioned cups for future recipes.</p>

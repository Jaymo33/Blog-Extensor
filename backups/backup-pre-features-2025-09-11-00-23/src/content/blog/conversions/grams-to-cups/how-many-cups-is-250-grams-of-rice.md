faqQ1: "Does the type of rice affect how many cups 250 grams equals?"
faqA1: "Yes, the type of rice changes the cup measurement slightly. Fluffier rice like basmati will take up more space, so 250 grams might be closer to 1.3 cups. Denser rice like sushi rice will be nearer to 1.2 cups. Always weigh for accuracy."
faqQ2: "Can I use a US cup measure for UK recipes?"
faqA2: "You can, but adjust slightly. Since a US cup is smaller (240ml vs. 250ml), 250 grams of rice will be about 1.3 US cups instead of 1.25 UK cups. For air fryer recipes, this small difference usually won’t ruin the dish."
faqQ3: "How do I convert 250 grams of rice to cups for an air fryer recipe?"
faqA3: "For most air fryer recipes, 250 grams of rice equals roughly 1.25 UK cups or 1.3 US cups. If the recipe specifies a rice type, adjust slightly—basmati may need a bit more volume, while short-grain needs less."
faqQ4: "Why does my air fryer rice turn out dry or uneven?"
faqA4: "Dry rice often means too little water or overcooking. For 250 grams of rice, use 1.5 cups of water and check at 12 minutes. Stirring halfway helps. Also, ensure your air fryer is clean—residue can cause hotspots."

<h2>Why Accurate Rice Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Getting the right rice-to-liquid ratio is crucial, especially when using an air fryer. Too much rice can lead to uneven cooking, while too little might leave your dish dry. For 250 grams of rice, the standard conversion is about 1.25 UK cups or 1.3 US cups, but this can vary slightly depending on the rice type. Basmati, for example, is fluffier, while short-grain rice is denser. If you're unsure, always weigh your rice for the best results.</p>  

<p>Using an air fryer for rice dishes like fried rice or rice cakes? Precise measurements ensure the texture stays perfect. A kitchen scale is your best friend here, but if you don’t have one, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a> includes handy tips for measuring without scales. Remember, 250 grams of rice in cups isn’t a one-size-fits-all answer—adjust based on your recipe’s needs.</p>  

<h2>UK vs. US Cup Measurements for Rice</h2>  
<p>The difference between UK and US cup sizes might seem small, but it can affect your cooking. A UK cup holds 250ml, while a US cup is 240ml. For 250 grams of rice, this means roughly 1.25 UK cups or 1.3 US cups. If you’re following a recipe from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, note whether it uses UK or US measurements to avoid discrepancies.</p>  

<h3>Types of Rice and Their Cup Equivalents</h3>  
<p>Not all rice weighs the same per cup. Long-grain rice like basmati is lighter, so 250 grams might fill slightly more than 1.25 cups. Short-grain or sushi rice is denser, so it’ll be closer to 1.2 cups. For air fryer recipes, stick to the weight measurement if possible—especially for dishes like crispy rice cakes where texture is key.</p>  

<h2>How to Measure 250 Grams of Rice Without Scales</h2>  
<p>No scales? No problem. Use a standard metric cup (250ml for UK, 240ml for US) and fill it loosely without packing the rice down. For 250 grams, you’ll need just over 1 cup. Alternatively, 250 grams of rice is about the size of a large apple in volume.

<h3>Air Fryer Rice Cooking Tips</h3>  
<p>When cooking rice in an air fryer, always rinse it first to remove excess starch. For 250 grams of rice, use 1.5 cups of water and cook at 180°C for 12-15 minutes. Stir halfway for even results.

faqQ1: "Can I use brown sugar instead of granulated sugar for 50 grams?"
faqA1: "Yes, you can substitute brown sugar for granulated sugar, but it will affect the taste and moisture of your recipe. Brown sugar has a richer flavour and more moisture, so your baked goods may be denser. For best results, stick to granulated sugar unless the recipe allows for substitutions."
faqQ2: "How do I measure 50 grams of granulated sugar without a scale?"
faqA2: "If you don’t have a scale, use a measuring cup. 50 grams of granulated sugar is roughly 1/4 cup. Spoon the sugar into the cup and level it off with a knife for accuracy. Avoid packing the sugar down, as this can lead to using more than needed."
faqQ3: "Why does my air fryer recipe call for 50 grams of sugar instead of cups?"
faqA3: "Many recipes use grams for precision, as measuring by weight is more accurate than volume. This is especially important in baking, where small differences can affect the outcome. If your recipe lists grams, it’s best to use a scale for the most consistent results."
faqQ4: "Does the type of granulated sugar affect the measurement?"
faqA4: "Standard granulated sugar is consistent in size, so 50 grams will always be roughly 1/4 cup. However, specialty sugars like coarse or extra-fine may vary slightly. For most recipes, standard granulated sugar works best, and the conversion remains the same."

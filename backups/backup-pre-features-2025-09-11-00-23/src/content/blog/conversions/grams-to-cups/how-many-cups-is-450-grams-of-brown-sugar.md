faqQ1: "Does 450 grams of brown sugar equal the same cups for all brands?"
faqA1: "Most brands of brown sugar have similar densities, so 450 grams will generally equal around 2.25 cups. However, organic or unrefined varieties might be slightly coarser, affecting the volume. For air fryer recipes, weighing with a scale is safest for consistency."
faqQ2: "Can I use white sugar instead of brown sugar for 450 grams in cups?"
faqA2: "White sugar is denser, so 450 grams equals about 2 cups—less than brown sugar. Substituting may alter texture and moisture in air fryer recipes. If swapping, reduce liquid ingredients slightly to compensate for brown sugar’s higher moisture content."
faqQ3: "How do I prevent 450 grams of brown sugar from hardening in storage?"
faqA3: "Store brown sugar in an airtight container with a slice of bread or a terra cotta brown sugar saver to retain moisture. For air fryer users, soft sugar ensures even mixing and better results in recipes like glazes or marinades."
faqQ4: "Why does my air fryer recipe taste too sweet with 450 grams of brown sugar?"
faqA4: "Air fryers intensify flavors due to concentrated heat. If your dish is overly sweet, reduce the brown sugar by 10-15% or balance it with acidic ingredients like lemon juice. Always taste-test batters before cooking."

faqQ1: "Does the type of lentil affect the cup measurement?"
faqA1: "Yes, different lentil varieties can slightly alter the cup measurement due to size and density. Red lentils are smaller and may pack more densely, while green or brown lentils are fluffier. For precise results, weighing is best."
faqQ2: "Can I use the same conversion for cooked lentils?"
faqA2: "No, cooked lentils absorb water and expand, so 350 grams of cooked lentils will measure differently. For cooked lentils, roughly 1 cup equals 200 grams, but weighing is more accurate."
faqQ3: "Why is my air fryer lentil recipe turning out dry?"
faqA3: "Overcrowding or incorrect measurements can lead to dry results. Ensure you’re using the right amount of lentils (1.75 cups for 350g) and shake the basket during cooking for even air circulation."
faqQ4: "How do I store leftover cooked lentils?"
faqA4: "Store cooked lentils in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 5 days. Reheat them in the air fryer at 160°C for 3-4 minutes to restore texture. For more storage tips, visit our meal prep section."

<p>Measuring 350 grams of lentils in cups is especially useful if you don’t have a kitchen scale handy. Different types of lentils (red, green, or brown) may vary slightly in density, but 1.75 cups is a reliable estimate. For best results, fluff the lentils before measuring to avoid compacting them. This ensures consistency across all your lentil-based dishes.</p>  

<h3>Types of Lentils and Their Measurements</h3>  
<p>Different lentil varieties can affect the final cup measurement slightly. Red lentils, for example, are smaller and may pack more densely, while green lentils are larger and fluffier.

faqQ1: "How do I convert 477 F to Celsius for my fan oven?"
faqA1: "477 F converts to 247 C in a fan oven. Simply subtract 32 from Fahrenheit, multiply by 5, then divide by 9. Fan ovens cook faster, so you may need to reduce cooking times slightly compared to conventional ovens."
faqQ2: "Can I use the same cooking time when converting 477 F to fan oven?"
faqA2: "No, you should reduce cooking times by about 20% when using 477 F (247 C) in a fan oven. The circulating air cooks food faster and more evenly, similar to how an air fryer operates. Always check food a few minutes early."
faqQ3: "What types of food cook best at 477 F in a fan oven?"
faqA3: "477 F (247 C fan) works perfectly for roasting vegetables, crisping chicken skin, baking puff pastry, or reheating fried foods. It's ideal for achieving golden-brown results without drying out the interior of your dishes."
faqQ4: "Why does my food cook differently at 477 F in fan oven vs air fryer?"
faqA4: "While both use circulating hot air, air fryers are more compact with intense airflow. At 477 F equivalent, air fryers cook slightly faster than fan ovens. You may need to reduce cooking times by an additional 5-10% when using an air fryer."

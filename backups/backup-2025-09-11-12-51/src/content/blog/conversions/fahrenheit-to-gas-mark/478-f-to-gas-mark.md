faqQ1: "What types of food cook best at 478 F (Gas Mark 9)?"
faqA1: "Foods that benefit most from 478 F include items needing quick browning like puff pastry, pizza, roasted vegetables, and air fried chicken. This high temperature creates perfect crispness while keeping interiors moist. It's also ideal for finishing dishes or reheating to restore crisp textures."
faqQ2: "How do I convert 478 F to Gas Mark for a fan oven?"
faqA2: "For fan ovens, 478 F converts to Gas Mark 9, but you may need to reduce the temperature by 20°C (about 35°F) for equivalent results. The circulating air in fan ovens cooks more efficiently, so many recipes suggest lowering temperatures slightly when using this setting."
faqQ3: "Can all air fryers reach 478 F (Gas Mark 9)?"
faqA3: "Most modern air fryers can reach 478 F, though cooking times may vary between models. Compact or budget models might take slightly longer to achieve and maintain this temperature. Always check your specific model's maximum temperature capacity in the manual."
faqQ4: "Is 478 F too high for cooking meat in an air fryer?"
faqA4: "478 F works well for smaller cuts of meat or finishing stages, but isn't ideal for large joints. For thicker meats, start at a lower temperature to cook through, then use 478 F briefly at the end for perfect browning. Always check internal temperatures for food safety."

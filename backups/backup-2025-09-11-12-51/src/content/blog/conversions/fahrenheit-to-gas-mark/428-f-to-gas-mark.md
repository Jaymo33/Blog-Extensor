faqA1: "Yes, most modern air fryers with Gas Mark settings include Gas Mark 7 (428 F). If yours doesn't, use the highest setting available and reduce cooking time slightly. The powerful air circulation compensates for small temperature differences."
faqQ2: "How does 428 F compare to air fryer presets like 'roast' or 'bake'?"

faqA4: "Absolutely. Reduce oven cooking times by about 20-25% when using 428 F (Gas Mark 7) in an air fryer. Start checking food 5-10 minutes before the oven recipe suggests, as air fryers cook faster due to their efficient heat circulation."

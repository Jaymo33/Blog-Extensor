faqQ1: "Can I use Gas Mark 4 instead of 4.5 for 355 F?"
faqA1: "Yes, Gas Mark 4 (350 F) can be used as it's only 5 degrees lower than 355 F. Your cooking time might need to be slightly longer, about 5-10 minutes more depending on the recipe. The difference is minimal for most dishes."
faqQ2: "How do I set 355 F on an air fryer without Gas Mark settings?"
faqA2: "Most digital air fryers allow you to input temperatures directly in Fahrenheit. Simply set it to 355 F. If your model only has presets, choose the setting closest to 350-375 F and adjust cooking time accordingly."
faqQ3: "Why do some recipes specify 355 F instead of 350 F or 375 F?"
faqA3: "355 F (Gas Mark 4.5) offers a middle ground - slightly hotter than 350 F for better browning but gentler than 375 F to prevent burning. It's ideal for recipes needing thorough cooking without excessive browning, like delicate cakes or juicy meats."
faqQ4: "Can I cook frozen foods at 355 F in my air fryer?"
faqA4: "Yes, 355 F works well for many frozen foods in air fryers. It's hot enough to crisp without burning. Check our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/frozen-foods>frozen foods section</a> for specific timing recommendations, as cooking times vary by item size and thickness."

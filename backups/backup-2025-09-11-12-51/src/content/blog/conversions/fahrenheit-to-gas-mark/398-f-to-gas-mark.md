faqQ1: "Can I use 398 F in my air fryer if it only shows Gas Mark?"
faqA1: "Yes, simply set your air fryer to Gas Mark 6 which is the equivalent of 398°F. Most modern air fryers with digital displays allow you to switch between temperature scales, but if yours doesn't, Gas Mark 6 will give you the same cooking results."
faqQ2: "How does cooking time differ between 398 F in an oven and Gas Mark 6 in an air fryer?"
faqA2: "Air fryers typically cook food 20% faster than conventional ovens at the same temperature. So if a recipe says 30 minutes at 398 F in the oven, start checking your food in the air fryer at around 24 minutes when using Gas Mark 6."
faqQ3: "Is 398 F to Gas Mark 6 suitable for baking cakes in an air fryer?"
faqA3: "While 398 F (Gas Mark 6) can work for some cakes, it's generally better to reduce the temperature slightly for most baked goods in air fryers. Try lowering to 375 F (Gas Mark 5) and extending the cooking time to prevent over-browning while ensuring the centre cooks through."
faqQ4: "Why do some recipes specify 398 F instead of a round number like 400 F?"
faqA4: "398 F is the precise Fahrenheit equivalent of 200°C (actually 203°C), which is a standard baking temperature in metric recipes. Some recipe developers prefer this accuracy, especially for delicate baked goods where small temperature differences matter. In practice, 398 F and 400 F will yield very similar results."

<p>398°F converts to Gas Mark 6 in UK ovens and air fryers. This medium-high temperature is ideal for roasting meats, baking casseroles, or crisping vegetables in your air fryer. Whether you're following an American recipe or adjusting your air fryer settings, knowing this conversion ensures perfect results every time.</p>

<h2>Understanding 398 F to Gas Mark Conversion</h2>
<p>The Gas Mark system is uniquely British, with each number representing a specific temperature range. Gas Mark 6 corresponds to 200-210°C, with 398°F sitting at 203°C - right in the middle of this range. When using your air fryer, this temperature works wonders for achieving crispy skins on chicken or perfect roast potatoes. Many <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> originally designed for conventional ovens will specify 398°F, making this conversion particularly useful.</p>
<p>For those who frequently switch between American and British recipes, keeping a conversion chart handy is wise. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we recommend bookmarking our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for quick reference. The 398 F to Gas Mark conversion becomes especially important when baking - a difference of just 10 degrees can affect cake rise or biscuit texture.</p>

<h2>Practical Applications in Air Fryers</h2>
<p>Modern air fryers with digital displays often show Fahrenheit, Celsius and sometimes Gas Mark equivalents. If yours doesn't, setting it to 200°C will give you the correct 398 F to Gas Mark 6 equivalent. This temperature works particularly well for <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipes</a>, creating that desirable golden-brown finish without drying out the meat.</p>
<p>When converting 398 degrees Fahrenheit to Gas Mark for air frying, remember that cooking times may be shorter than conventional oven recipes. The concentrated heat circulation in air fryers means you'll typically need to reduce cooking time by about 20%. Always check food 5 minutes before the recommended time to prevent overcooking.</p>

<h3>Baking at 398 F (Gas Mark 6)</h3>
<p>For baking enthusiasts, 398 F to Gas Mark 6 is a versatile temperature. It's hot enough to give scones a good rise while preventing excessive browning. When adapting oven recipes for your air fryer, reduce the quantity by about a third to ensure proper air circulation. This temperature also works beautifully for <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cookies>cookies</a>, giving them crisp edges with chewy centres.</p>

<h2>Temperature Accuracy and Calibration</h2>
<p>Not all ovens or air fryers maintain exact temperatures, so it's worth investing in an oven thermometer. If you find your 398 F to Gas Mark 6 conversion isn't yielding perfect results, your appliance might run hot or cold. Regular cleaning with <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner</a> also ensures consistent heating performance by preventing grease buildup that can affect temperature distribution.</p>
<p>For frozen foods cooked at 398 F (Gas Mark 6), always check packaging for specific instructions. Many <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/frozen-foods>frozen food items</a> cook beautifully at this temperature, from chicken nuggets to roasted vegetables. The hot air circulation mimics deep frying while using significantly less oil, making it a healthier alternative.</p>

<h3>Alternative Cooking Methods</h3>
<p>If your recipe calls for 398 F but your air fryer only shows Gas Mark, now you know to set it to Gas Mark 6. This temperature also works well for reheating leftovers, giving them a fresh-from-the-oven quality without drying them out. For best results, spread food evenly in the basket and shake or turn halfway through cooking.</p>

<h2>Understanding 265 F to Gas Mark Conversions</h2>
<p>The Gas Mark system is uniquely British, with Gas Mark 1 representing approximately 275°F (135°C). Since 265°F falls just below this, it's typically rounded to Gas Mark 1 for practical cooking purposes. When using an air fryer, you'll often find recipes from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> that require precise temperature control, making these conversions essential. Many air fryer models display both Fahrenheit and Gas Mark settings, especially those designed for the UK market.</p>
<p>For delicate dishes like meringues or slow-cooked vegetables, the 265 F to Gas Mark 1 conversion works beautifully. This temperature range prevents burning while allowing thorough cooking. If you're adapting an oven recipe for your air fryer, remember that air fryers cook faster, so you may need to reduce the cooking time by 20% even when using the correct 265 F to Gas Mark conversion.</p>

<h2>Practical Applications in Air Fryers</h2>
<p>When converting 265 Fahrenheit to Gas Mark for air fryer use, consider the type of food you're preparing. This temperature works well for dehydrating fruits, making jerky, or gently reheating leftovers without drying them out.

<h3>Baking at 265 F (Gas Mark 1)</h3>
<p>For baked goods that require gentle heat, the 265 degrees F to Gas Mark conversion is perfect. Try it for biscotti that needs drying out or meringues that should cook slowly.

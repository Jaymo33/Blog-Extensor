faqQ1: "Can I use 303 F (Gas Mark 2) for all air fryer recipes?"
faqA1: "303 F (Gas Mark 2) works best for slow cooking, dehydrating, or warming. For crisping or frying, higher temperatures like 180°C (Gas Mark 4) are typically better. Always check recipe recommendations."
faqQ2: "Why does my air fryer cook faster than my oven at 303 F?"
faqA2: "Air fryers circulate heat more aggressively than conventional ovens. At 303 F (Gas Mark 2), reduce cooking times by 15-20% and check food frequently to prevent over-drying."
faqQ3: "How do I convert Gas Mark back to Fahrenheit for my air fryer?"
faqA3: "Use the formula: °F = (Gas Mark × 25) + 250. For Gas Mark 2: (2 × 25) + 250 = 300°F (close to 303°F). Most air fryers allow 5°F increments."
faqQ4: "Is 303 F (Gas Mark 2) safe for reheating food in an air fryer?"
faqA4: "Yes, 303 F (Gas Mark 2) safely reheats most foods without drying them out. For items like pizza or fried chicken, increase to 160°C (Gas Mark 3) for crispier results."

Always preheat your air fryer to 303°F (Gas Mark 2) for even cooking, just as you would with a traditional oven.</p>

<h3>Common Uses for 303 F (Gas Mark 2)</h3>
<p>This temperature excels at dehydrating herbs, proofing dough, or warming plates. It’s also perfect for cooking <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/frozen-foods>frozen foods</a> like spring rolls without burning the exterior.

<h2>How to Convert Other Temperatures to Gas Mark</h2>
<p>Beyond 303 F to Gas Mark, our readers frequently ask about conversions like 350°F (Gas Mark 4) or 180°C (Gas Mark 4). The formula is simple: Gas Mark = (°F - 250) ÷ 25 + 1. For 303°F: (303 - 250) ÷ 25 + 1 = Gas Mark 2.12 (rounded to Gas Mark 2).

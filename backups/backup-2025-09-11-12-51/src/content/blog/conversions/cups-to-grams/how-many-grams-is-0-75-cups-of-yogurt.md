faqQ1: "Does the type of yogurt affect the gram measurement for 0.75 cups?"
faqA1: "Yes, the type of yogurt can slightly affect the weight. Greek yogurt is denser, so 0.75 cups may weigh closer to 190 grams. Regular yogurt averages around 180 grams for the same volume. Always check your recipe for specific recommendations."
faqQ2: "Can I use milliliters instead of grams for measuring yogurt?"
faqA2: "While milliliters measure volume and grams measure weight, they can sometimes be used interchangeably for liquids like yogurt. However, for baking, grams are more precise. One milliliter of yogurt is roughly equal to one gram, but this can vary with thickness."

faqQ4: "Why is 0.75 cups of yogurt a common measurement in recipes?"
faqA4: "0.75 cups (or 180 grams) of yogurt is often used because it provides the right balance of moisture without overwhelming other ingredients. It’s a versatile amount for marinades, baking, and sauces, making it a staple in many air fryer recipes."

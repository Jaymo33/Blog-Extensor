faqQ1: "Does the type of lentil affect the weight of 3.0 cups?"
faqA1: "While most lentils weigh roughly the same, slight variations exist between types like red, green, or brown. However, 3.0 cups of any lentil will generally be around 600 grams. For precise cooking, always weigh them if possible."
faqQ2: "Can I use this conversion for both dry and cooked lentils?"
faqA2: "No, this conversion applies only to dry lentils. Cooked lentils absorb water and expand, so their weight increases significantly. For cooked lentils, refer to specific recipe guidelines or weigh them after cooking."
faqQ3: "Why is measuring lentils in grams better than cups?"
faqA3: "Grams provide a more accurate measurement since cup volumes can vary based on how the lentils are packed. Weight-based measurements ensure consistency, especially important for air fryer recipes where precision affects cooking times."
faqQ4: "How do I adjust cooking times for 3.0 cups of lentils in the air fryer?"
faqA4: "Cooking times depend on the recipe, but 600 grams of lentils may require slight adjustments. Spread them evenly in the basket to ensure even cooking. Check our air fryer timing guide for specific recommendations based on your dish."

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on precise cooking times and ingredient ratios to deliver crispy, evenly cooked results. Using the wrong amount of yogurt, for example, can throw off the moisture balance in batters or marinades. If you're making a <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>cake in your air fryer</a>, 0.25 cups of yogurt in grams ensures the batter isn’t too dry or too wet. Similarly, marinating chicken or vegetables with the right yogurt quantity guarantees optimal tenderness and flavour infusion.</p>  

<p>Yogurt is a versatile ingredient in air fryer recipes, acting as a tenderiser, binder, or even a low-fat substitute for heavier creams.

<h3>UK vs. US Cup Measurements</h3>  
<p>It’s worth noting that UK and US cup measurements differ slightly. A UK cup holds 250ml, while a US cup is 240ml. This means 0.25 cups of yogurt in the UK is roughly 62.5 grams, whereas in the US, it’s closer to 60 grams. For most air fryer recipes, this small discrepancy won’t make a huge difference, but it’s good to be aware of if precision is critical.</p>  

<h2>How to Measure Yogurt Correctly</h2>  
<p>Measuring yogurt by volume can be tricky due to its thickness. To get an accurate 0.25 cups of yogurt in grams, use a kitchen scale for the most reliable results. Scoop the yogurt into a measuring cup without packing it down, then level it off with a knife. Alternatively, spoon it directly onto the scale for an exact gram measurement. This method is especially useful when preparing <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>air fryer desserts</a>, where consistency is key.</p>

<h3>Types of Yogurt and Their Weights</h3>  
<p>Greek yogurt is denser than regular yogurt, so 0.25 cups will weigh slightly more—around 70 grams. On the other hand, low-fat or drinking yogurt may weigh less, closer to 50 grams for the same volume. Always adjust your measurements based on the yogurt type to avoid recipe mishaps. This is particularly important for air fryer recipes, where ingredient ratios affect cooking times and textures.</p>

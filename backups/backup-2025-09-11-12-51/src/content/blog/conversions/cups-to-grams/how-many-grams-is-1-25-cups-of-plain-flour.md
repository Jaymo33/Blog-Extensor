faqQ2: "Can I use self-raising flour instead of plain flour for 1.25 cups?"
faqA2: "You can substitute self-raising flour, but note it includes baking powder, which may affect texture. For precise results, stick to plain flour unless the recipe specifies otherwise."
faqQ3: "How do I measure 1.25 cups of flour without a scale?"

faqQ4: "Why does my air fryer recipe need exact flour measurements?"
faqA4: "Air fryers cook quickly, so precise measurements prevent uneven textures—too much flour can make food dense, while too little may not crisp properly. Follow conversions like 1.25 cups = 156g for best results."

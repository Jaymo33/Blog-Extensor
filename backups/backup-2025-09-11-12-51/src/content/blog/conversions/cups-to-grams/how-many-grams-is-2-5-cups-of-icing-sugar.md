faqQ1: "Is 2.5 cups of icing sugar the same in the UK and US?"
faqA1: "While both countries use cups, UK cups are slightly larger (250ml vs. 240ml). However, 2.5 cups of icing sugar converts to roughly 312.5 grams in both systems. For air fryer baking, weighing ingredients ensures consistency."
faqQ2: "Can I use granulated sugar instead of icing sugar?"
faqA2: "No, icing sugar is much finer and contains cornstarch, which affects texture. Substituting granulated sugar will alter the recipe’s outcome. If you’re out of icing sugar, blend granulated sugar into a powder with a bit of cornflour."
faqQ3: "How do I store leftover icing sugar?"
faqA3: "Keep it in an airtight container in a cool, dry place to prevent clumping. If it hardens, sift it before use. For more storage tips, check our guides at <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>."
faqQ4: "Why does my air fryer recipe need exact sugar measurements?"
faqA4: "Air fryers cook quickly and intensely, so precise measurements prevent burning or uneven results. Too much sugar can cause excessive browning, while too little may dry out your bake. Always weigh ingredients for best results."

faqQ1: "Does the type of milk affect the weight of 1.5 cups?"
faqA1: "Yes, the fat content in milk (whole, semi-skimmed, or skimmed) slightly alters its density, but the difference in weight is minimal. For most recipes, you can use the standard conversion of 1.5 cups of milk to 360 grams (UK) or 354 grams (US) without issue."
faqQ2: "Can I use plant-based milk instead of dairy milk in air fryer recipes?"
faqA2: "Absolutely! Plant-based milks like almond, oat, or soy can be substituted 1:1 for dairy milk in air fryer recipes. Just note that their slightly different consistencies might affect texture, so adjust cooking times if needed."
faqQ3: "How do I measure 1.5 cups of milk if I don’t have a measuring cup?"
faqA3: "A standard mug holds about 250 ml (just over 1 cup), so 1.5 cups would be roughly 1.5 mugs. For precision, use a kitchen scale or invest in a liquid measuring cup—it’s worth it for consistent results."
faqQ4: "Why do UK and US cup measurements differ for milk?"
faqA4: "The difference stems from historical measurement systems. The UK uses the imperial system (240 ml per cup), while the US follows the customary system (236.6 ml per cup). Always check which system your recipe uses to avoid errors."

faqQ1: "Does the type of cheese affect the cup-to-gram conversion?"
faqA1: "Yes, cheese density varies slightly by type. Hard cheeses like parmesan weigh more per cup than softer varieties like mozzarella. However, for most common grated cheeses (cheddar, mozzarella, etc.), 2.75 cups reliably equals about 275 grams."
faqQ2: "Can I use pre-shredded cheese for this measurement?"
faqA2: "Pre-shredded cheese works fine, but it often contains anti-caking agents that slightly affect volume. For utmost precision with 2.75 cups (275g), freshly grated cheese is ideal. Pre-shredded may require gentle fluffing before measuring."
faqQ3: "How should I adjust cheese amounts when converting oven recipes to air fryer?"
faqA3: "Reduce cheese by 10-15% when adapting oven recipes for air fryers. So 2.75 cups (275g) might become 240-250g. This prevents excessive melting that could block air circulation in the compact air fryer basket."
faqQ4: "What's the best way to measure sticky grated cheese?"
faqA4: "Chill the cheese first to reduce stickiness. Lightly grease your measuring cups or use parchment paper when portioning 2.75 cups (275g). For super-sticky cheeses like mozzarella, weighing directly in grams is more reliable than cup measurements."

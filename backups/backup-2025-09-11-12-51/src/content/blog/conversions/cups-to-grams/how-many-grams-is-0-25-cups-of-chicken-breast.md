faqQ1: "Can I use cooked chicken breast for the 0.25 cups to grams conversion?"
faqA1: "No, the 56-gram measurement refers to raw chicken breast. Cooked chicken weighs less due to moisture loss. For cooked chicken, 0.25 cups is roughly 42 grams. Always check whether your recipe specifies raw or cooked measurements."
faqQ2: "Does the type of chicken breast affect the gram measurement?"
faqA2: "Boneless, skinless chicken breast is the standard for this conversion (56g per 0.25 cups). Bone-in or skin-on varieties will differ due to weight variations. For consistent results, stick to boneless, skinless cuts in air fryer recipes."
faqQ3: "How do I convert grams back to cups if I only have a scale?"
faqA3: "Divide the gram measurement by 224 (1 cup = 224g). For example, 56 grams ÷ 224 = 0.25 cups. This reverse conversion helps when adapting recipes from metric to cup measurements."
faqQ4: "Why does my air fryer chicken sometimes turn out dry?"
faqA4: "Overcooking or uneven sizing can dry out chicken. Ensure pieces are uniformly 56 grams (0.25 cups) for even cooking. Also, avoid overcrowding the air fryer basket, as this affects airflow and cooking efficiency."

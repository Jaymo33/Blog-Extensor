faqQ1: "Does the type of rice affect how many grams are in 1.0 cups?"
faqA1: "Yes, different rice types have slight weight variations. Long-grain rice like basmati weighs about 190 grams per 1.0 cups, while short-grain varieties like sushi rice can be closer to 210 grams. For air fryer recipes, sticking to 200 grams as a baseline works well."
faqQ2: "Can I use the same conversion for UK and US cup measurements?"
faqA2: "UK and US cups differ slightly in volume, but the difference is minimal for rice. 1.0 UK cups of rice weigh roughly 200 grams, while US cups may vary by 5-10 grams. For air fryer cooking, using grams ensures consistency regardless of the cup type."
faqQ3: "How do I adjust cooking times for 1.0 cups of rice in the air fryer?"
faqA3: "For 1.0 cups (200 grams) of rice, preheat your air fryer to 180°C and cook for 12-15 minutes, stirring halfway. Add a bit more water for softer rice or reduce time for a crispier texture. Always check doneness before serving."
faqQ4: "What’s the best rice-to-water ratio for air fryer cooking?"
faqA4: "A 1:1.5 ratio of rice to water works best for fluffy results. For 1.0 cups (200 grams) of rice, use 1.5 cups (300ml) of water. Adjust slightly for different rice types or if you prefer a drier or stickier texture."

faqQ1: "Can I use frozen blueberries instead of fresh for 1.75 cups?"

faqA2: "No, you can measure frozen blueberries directly without thawing. Just ensure they’re lightly packed in the measuring cup for accuracy. The gram weight (245g for 1.75 cups) stays consistent whether they’re fresh or frozen."
faqQ3: "How do I convert other berry measurements to grams?"

For precise measurements, refer to a kitchen scale or our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a>. Raspberries and blackberries are slightly lighter, while strawberries vary by size."
faqQ4: "Why does my blueberry dessert turn out too wet?"

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Using the correct weight for ingredients like blueberries ensures your dishes have the right texture and flavour.

<h2>How to Measure Blueberries Correctly</h2>  
<p>For the most accurate measurement, use a kitchen scale. Scoop the blueberries into a measuring cup without packing them down, then weigh them. If you don’t have a scale, fluff the berries lightly in the cup to avoid overpacking. This method helps prevent discrepancies, especially when following precise recipes like those on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>.</p>  

<h3>Fresh vs. Frozen Blueberries</h3>

If your recipe calls for fresh blueberries but you’re using frozen, consider reducing other liquids slightly. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert recipes</a> account for these nuances, so you’ll always get the best results.</p>

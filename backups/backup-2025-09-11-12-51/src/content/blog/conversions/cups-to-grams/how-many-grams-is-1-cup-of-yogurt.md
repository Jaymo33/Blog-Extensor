faqQ1: "Does the type of yogurt affect the gram weight of 1.0 cups?"
faqA1: "Yes, thicker yogurts like Greek or skyr weigh more per cup—up to 280 grams for 1.0 cups. Regular natural yogurt averages 245 grams, while low-fat versions may be slightly lighter. Always adjust for density in recipes."
faqQ2: "Can I use milliliters instead of grams for yogurt measurements?"
faqA2: "While 1.0 cups of yogurt is roughly 245 grams, milliliters measure volume, not weight. For accuracy, stick to grams, especially in baking. Use 245ml only if your recipe specifies volume."
faqQ3: "How do I convert 1.0 cups of yogurt for a half recipe?"
faqA3: "Halving 1.0 cups (245g) gives 122.5 grams. Use a kitchen scale for precision, or measure ½ cup plus 1 tablespoon for a close approximation. This works well for marinades or small-batch baking."
faqQ4: "Why does my air fryer recipe call for grams instead of cups?"
faqA4: "Grams ensure consistency, as cup measurements can vary with ingredient density. Air fryers cook quickly, so exact weights prevent under- or overcooking. For foolproof results, always weigh yogurt when possible."

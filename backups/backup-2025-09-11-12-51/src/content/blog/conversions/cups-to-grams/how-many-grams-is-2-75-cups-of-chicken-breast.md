faqQ1: "Does 2.75 cups of chicken breast weigh the same cooked and raw?"
faqA1: "No, chicken loses about 25% of its weight when cooked due to water loss. If your recipe calls for 2.75 cups of cooked chicken breast, you’ll need roughly 440 grams raw to yield 330 grams after cooking."
faqQ2: "Can I use this conversion for frozen chicken breast?"
faqA2: "Yes, but thaw it first for accurate measuring. Frozen chicken contains ice crystals that add weight, so 2.75 cups of frozen chicken breast won’t equate to 330 grams once thawed and drained."
faqQ3: "How does shredded vs. diced chicken affect the weight per cup?"
faqA3: "Shredded chicken is less dense, so 2.75 cups may weigh slightly less than diced. For precision, weigh after preparing the chicken in your preferred form."
faqQ4: "Why do some recipes use cups instead of grams for chicken?"
faqA4: "Cups are quicker for home cooks without scales, but grams offer precision. If a recipe lists 2.75 cups of chicken breast, converting to grams (330g) ensures consistency, especially in air fryers where exact amounts matter."

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on hot air circulation to cook food evenly, and incorrect measurements can lead to undercooked or dry results. For example, 2.75 cups of chicken breast in grams (330g) ensures you don’t overcrowd the basket, allowing proper airflow. Overloading can cause uneven cooking, while too little may dry out the meat. If you're new to air frying, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a> offers portion-controlled ideas to get started.</p>  

<p>Chicken breast is a lean protein, and its weight can vary slightly based on how it’s chopped or shredded. For best results, use a kitchen scale to confirm 2.75 cups of chicken breast in grams before cooking. This small step guarantees your air fryer delivers juicy, perfectly cooked chicken every time.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure 2.75 Cups of Chicken Breast</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a scale, here’s a simple method: lightly pack diced or shredded chicken into a measuring cup until it reaches 2.75 cups. Avoid pressing down, as this compacts the meat and skews the weight. For shredded chicken, fluff it lightly with a fork before measuring. Need more chicken-based recipes?

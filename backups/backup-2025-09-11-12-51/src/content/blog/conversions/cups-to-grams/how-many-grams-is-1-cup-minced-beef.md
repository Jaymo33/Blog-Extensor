<h2>How to Measure Minced Beef Correctly</h2>
<p>Measuring minced beef by volume can be tricky, as it’s not as uniform as liquids. To get an accurate 1.0 cup (225 grams), lightly pack the minced beef into a measuring cup without pressing too hard. Overpacking can lead to more meat than needed, throwing off your recipe. For best results, use a kitchen scale to weigh the minced beef directly. This method eliminates guesswork and ensures perfect portions every time.</p>

<h3>Using a Kitchen Scale</h3>
<p>A kitchen scale is the most reliable way to measure minced beef, especially for air fryer recipes. Simply place your bowl or container on the scale, tare it to zero, and add the minced beef until you reach 225 grams. This method is faster and more accurate than using cups. If you're serious about air frying, investing in a good scale is a game-changer.

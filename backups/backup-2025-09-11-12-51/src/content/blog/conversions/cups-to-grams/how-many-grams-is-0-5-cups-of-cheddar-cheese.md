faqQ1: "Can I use pre-shredded cheddar cheese for the 0.5 cups measurement?"
faqA1: "Yes, you can use pre-shredded cheddar cheese, but it may weigh slightly less than block cheese due to anti-caking agents. For accuracy, we recommend weighing it to ensure you’re using 56 grams."
faqQ2: "How do I convert 0.5 cups of cheddar cheese to grams if I don’t have a scale?"
faqA2: "If you don’t have a scale, lightly pack grated cheese into a measuring cup without pressing too hard. For block cheese, cut it into small cubes first. This method will get you close to 56 grams, though a scale is more precise."
faqQ3: "Does the type of cheddar cheese affect the weight per 0.5 cups?"
faqA3: "Mild, sharp, or extra-sharp cheddar cheese will weigh roughly the same per 0.5 cups, as the density is similar. However, aged or crumbly varieties may vary slightly, so weighing is best for accuracy."
faqQ4: "Can I use this conversion for other types of cheese in air fryer recipes?"
faqA4: "This conversion works best for cheddar cheese, as other cheeses like mozzarella or feta have different densities. For other cheeses, check our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a> for precise measurements."

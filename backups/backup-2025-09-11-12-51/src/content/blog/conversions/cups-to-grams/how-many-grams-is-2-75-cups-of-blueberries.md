faqQ1: "Does the weight of blueberries change if they’re frozen?"
faqA1: "No, frozen blueberries weigh roughly the same as fresh—about 120 grams per cup. However, thawing them releases juice, which can affect volume measurements. For air frying, use frozen berries directly to avoid sogginess."
faqQ2: "How do I convert 2.75 cups of blueberries to ounces?"
faqA2: "330 grams of blueberries equals approximately 11.6 ounces. Since most recipes use grams or cups, sticking to metric measurements is simpler for baking and air frying."
faqQ3: "Can I use dried blueberries instead of fresh in this conversion?"
faqA3: "Dried blueberries are much lighter—about 60 grams per cup. For 2.75 cups, you’d need around 165 grams. Rehydrate them first for recipes requiring moisture, like muffins or compotes."
faqQ4: "Why do some recipes list blueberries in cups and others in grams?"
faqA4: "Cups are common in the US, while grams are standard in the UK and for precision baking. Always weigh ingredients like blueberries for air frying, as density affects cooking times."

<h3>UK vs US Cup Measurements for Blueberries</h3>

<h3>Tips for Measuring Blueberries Without a Scale</h3>  
<p>No kitchen scale? Use the displacement method: fill a liquid measuring cup with water, add blueberries until the water rises to the 2.75-cup mark, then drain. This approximates 330 grams.

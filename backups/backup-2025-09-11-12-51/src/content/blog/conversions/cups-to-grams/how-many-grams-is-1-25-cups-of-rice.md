faqQ1: "Does the type of rice affect how many grams 1.25 cups is?"
faqA1: "Yes, different rice types have varying densities. For example, 1.25 cups of white rice is about 250 grams, while brown rice may weigh closer to 260 grams. Always check the specific type you're using for the most accurate conversion."
faqQ2: "Can I use a measuring cup instead of a scale for 1.25 cups of rice?"
faqA2: "While you can use a measuring cup, a kitchen scale is more precise. Scooping rice directly can compact it, leading to inconsistent measurements. For best results in air fryer cooking, weighing your rice ensures perfect texture every time."
faqQ3: "How much water should I use for 1.25 cups (250g) of rice in the air fryer?"
faqA3: "A general rule is a 1:1.5 ratio of rice to water for white rice. For 250 grams (1.25 cups), use 375ml of water. Adjust slightly for brown rice, which may need more water and a longer cooking time."
faqQ4: "Why does my air fryer rice sometimes turn out dry or uneven?"
faqA4: "Dry rice often results from inaccurate measurements or insufficient water. Ensure you're using 250 grams (1.25 cups) of rice with the correct water ratio. Also, stir halfway through cooking to promote even heat distribution in the air fryer."

<h2>Why Accurate Rice Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Cooking rice in an air fryer requires precision to avoid undercooking or drying it out. Using 1.25 cups of rice without converting to grams can lead to inconsistent textures. Many air fryer recipes, like those on our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipes page</a>, rely on gram measurements for reliability. Whether you're making a quick side or a full meal, knowing how many grams 1.25 cups of rice is ensures perfection.</p>  
<p>Different rice types, like basmati or jasmine, have slightly different weights per cup. For example, 1.25 cups of long-grain white rice weighs around 250 grams, while brown rice might be closer to 260 grams. Always check your specific rice variety for the most accurate conversion.</p>  

<h2>Converting 1.25 Cups of Rice to Grams</h2>

<h3>Measuring Rice for Air Fryer Recipes</h3>  
<p>Using a kitchen scale is the most accurate way to measure 1.25 cups of rice in grams. Simply place your bowl on the scale, tare it, and add rice until you reach 250 grams. This method eliminates guesswork and ensures your air fryer dishes turn out perfectly every time.</p>  

<h3>Common Mistakes When Measuring Rice</h3>

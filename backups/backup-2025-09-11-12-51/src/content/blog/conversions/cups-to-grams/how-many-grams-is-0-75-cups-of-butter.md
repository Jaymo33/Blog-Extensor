faqQ1: "Is 0.75 cups of butter the same as 170 grams in all recipes?"
faqA1: "Yes, 0.75 cups of butter generally equals 170 grams in most recipes, including those for air fryers. However, slight variations can occur based on butter density or brand. For best results, use a kitchen scale to confirm the weight, especially in baking where precision is key."
faqQ2: "Can I use margarine instead of butter for 0.75 cups in grams?"
faqA2: "Margarine can be substituted for butter, but its water content may differ, affecting texture. If replacing, still measure 170 grams for accuracy. Note that margarine might alter the taste and consistency of air fryer dishes compared to butter."
faqQ3: "How do I measure 0.75 cups of butter without a scale?"
faqA3: "Use measuring cups: 0.75 cups equals 12 tablespoons or 1.5 sticks of butter (US). Pack the butter firmly to avoid gaps. For UK recipes, note that a standard block is 250g, so 170g is roughly two-thirds of it."
faqQ4: "Why does butter measurement matter so much in air fryer recipes?"
faqA4: "Air fryers cook food quickly and evenly, so precise butter measurements prevent greasiness or dryness. Too much butter can cause smoking, while too little may lead to uneven browning. Converting 0.75 cups to grams (170g) ensures perfect results every time."

faqQ1: "Does packed or loose brown sugar affect the gram measurement for 1.5 cups?"
faqA1: "Yes, packing brown sugar tightly into a cup can increase its weight. For 1.5 cups, loosely spooned brown sugar weighs around 300 grams, while firmly packed sugar can weigh up to 330 grams. Always use a kitchen scale for precision in air fryer recipes."
faqQ2: "Can I use granulated sugar instead of brown sugar in air fryer recipes?"
faqA2: "Granulated sugar lacks the moisture and molasses flavour of brown sugar, which can alter texture and taste. If substituting, reduce the quantity slightly and add a teaspoon of water or syrup to mimic brown sugar’s properties. For best results, stick to the recipe’s specified 300 grams (1.5 cups) of brown sugar."
faqQ3: "How do I convert 1.5 cups of brown sugar to grams without a scale?"
faqA3: "Without a scale, spoon brown sugar into a measuring cup and level it off for an approximate 300-gram measurement. However, investing in a cheap kitchen scale ensures accuracy, especially for air fryer baking where precision matters."
faqQ4: "Why does my air fryer recipe taste too sweet with 1.5 cups of brown sugar?"
faqA4: "Over-measuring brown sugar is a common issue. Ensure you’re using exactly 300 grams (1.5 cups) and not packing the sugar too tightly. If the recipe still tastes overly sweet, reduce the sugar by 10% and adjust to your preference."

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Baking</h2>
<p>Air fryers cook food faster and more evenly than traditional ovens, making precise measurements crucial.

Consistency is key, especially when adapting recipes for air fryers.</p>

<p>Brown sugar’s moisture content also affects measurements. Packed brown sugar will weigh more than loosely scooped sugar, so always level off your cups. For best results, use a kitchen scale to measure 300 grams directly. This eliminates guesswork and guarantees your air fryer recipes turn out perfectly every time.

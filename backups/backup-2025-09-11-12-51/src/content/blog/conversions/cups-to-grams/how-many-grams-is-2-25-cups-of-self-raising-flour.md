faqQ1: "Can I use plain flour instead of self-raising flour for 2.25 cups?"
faqA1: "Yes, you can substitute plain flour for self-raising flour by adding baking powder. For 2.25 cups (281 grams) of plain flour, mix in 3.75 teaspoons of baking powder. This ensures your baked goods rise properly in the air fryer. Always sift the mixture to distribute the baking powder evenly."
faqQ2: "Why is weighing flour more accurate than using cups?"
faqA2: "Weighing flour in grams is more accurate because cup measurements can vary based on how the flour is packed or scooped. A tightly packed cup can hold significantly more flour than a lightly scooped one, leading to inconsistent results. Grams provide a precise measurement, which is especially important for air fryer baking."
faqQ3: "How does self-raising flour affect air fryer baking?"
faqA3: "Self-raising flour contains baking powder, which helps baked goods rise in the air fryer’s compact environment. The hot air circulation ensures even cooking and a light, fluffy texture. However, overmixing or incorrect measurements can lead to dense results, so always follow the recipe closely."
faqQ4: "What’s the best way to store self-raising flour for accurate measurements?"
faqA4: "Store self-raising flour in an airtight container in a cool, dry place to prevent moisture absorption, which can affect its leavening power. Before measuring, fluff the flour with a spoon to aerate it, then spoon it into your measuring cup or weigh it for the most accurate results. This ensures consistent baking performance in your air fryer."

<p>2.25 cups of self-raising flour equals approximately 281 grams. This conversion is essential for precise baking, especially when using an air fryer, where accuracy can make or break your recipe. Whether you’re whipping up cakes, muffins, or bread, knowing the exact gram measurement ensures consistent results every time. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we understand the importance of getting measurements spot-on for air fryer success.</p>

<h2>Why Convert Cups to Grams?</h2>
<p>Converting cups to grams is crucial because cup measurements can vary based on how the flour is scooped or packed. Grams provide a more accurate and consistent measurement, which is particularly important in baking. Self-raising flour, which already contains baking powder, needs precise measurements to ensure your baked goods rise perfectly. Using a kitchen scale eliminates guesswork and guarantees your air fryer recipes turn out just right.

<p>To measure 2.25 cups of self-raising flour accurately, use the spoon-and-level method.

<h3>Adjusting Recipes for Different Flour Types</h3>
<p>If a recipe calls for 2.25 cups of self-raising flour but you only have plain flour, you can make your own self-raising flour by adding baking powder. For every 150 grams of plain flour, mix in 2 teaspoons of baking powder. This adjustment ensures your air fryer recipes still rise properly. Always weigh your ingredients for the best results, as cup measurements can be inconsistent.</p>

<h2>Tips for Baking with Self-Raising Flour in an Air Fryer</h2>
<p>When using self-raising flour in an air fryer, preheat the appliance to ensure even cooking. The hot air circulation helps the flour’s leavening agents work effectively, giving your baked goods a light, fluffy texture. Avoid overmixing the batter, as this can deflate the air bubbles and result in a denser product. For more baking tips, visit <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>.</p>

<p>Another tip is to lightly grease your air fryer basket or use parchment paper to prevent sticking. This is especially important for recipes using 2.25 cups of self-raising flour, such as cakes or bread. Monitoring cooking time is also crucial, as air fryers can cook faster than conventional ovens. Start checking for doneness a few minutes before the recipe suggests to avoid overbaking.</p>

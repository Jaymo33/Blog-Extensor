faqQ1: "Does the weight of broccoli change if it's raw or cooked?"
faqA1: "Yes, broccoli loses about 10% of its weight when cooked due to water loss. However, recipes typically specify whether measurements are for raw or cooked broccoli. For air fryer recipes, raw measurements are most common as the cooking happens in the appliance."
faqQ2: "Can I use frozen broccoli instead of fresh for the 1.75 cups measurement?"
faqA2: "You can use frozen broccoli, but it may release more water during cooking. For 1.75 cups (175g), measure while frozen and pat dry if possible. Frozen broccoli might need 1-2 minutes longer in the air fryer compared to fresh."
faqQ3: "How does chopped vs whole broccoli affect the cup to gram conversion?"
faqA3: "Chopped broccoli packs more densely into a cup, so you'll get slightly more grams per cup compared to whole florets. For accuracy, it's best to weigh after chopping if your recipe specifies chopped broccoli."
faqQ4: "Why do some recipes use cups while others use grams for broccoli measurements?"
faqA4: "Cups are more common in American recipes, while grams are standard in the UK and Europe. Grams provide more precision, especially for air fryer cooking where exact amounts affect cooking time and results. We recommend using grams for best outcomes."

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>
<p>Air fryers rely on hot air circulation to cook food evenly, and incorrect measurements can lead to uneven results.

<h2>How to Measure 1.75 Cups of Broccoli Correctly</h2>

It’s low enough to prevent burning but high enough to cook food thoroughly. In an air fryer, 164 C works well for reheating, baking, or slow-cooking delicate items like soufflés.

Check out our <a href="https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart" id="">air fryer conversion chart</a> for more handy temperature guides.</p><p id="">If you’re adapting an oven recipe for an air fryer, 164 C (Gas Mark 3) often requires slight timing adjustments. Air fryers circulate heat more efficiently, so cooking times may be shorter. For example, a Victoria sponge that takes 25 minutes in an oven at 164 C might need just 18–20 minutes in an air fryer. Always keep an eye on your dish the first time you try a new temperature conversion.</p><h2 id="">How to Convert 164 C to Gas Mark</h2><p id="">Converting 164 C to Gas Mark is straightforward: it’s Gas Mark 3.

It’s also great for proofing dough or warming bread.</p><h2 id="">Air Fryer Tips for 164 C</h2><p id="">When using 164 C in an air fryer, preheat for 3–5 minutes to ensure even cooking. Smaller air fryers may need a lower temperature or shorter time, so adjust accordingly. For foods that dry out easily, like fish or tofu, cover loosely with foil.

<h2>Practical Tips for Cooking 7.75 kg Chicken Breast in Your Air Fryer</h2>
<p>Cooking a large batch of chicken breast, like 7.75 kg, in your air fryer requires some planning to ensure even cooking and avoid overcrowding. Since most air fryers have limited basket space, you'll likely need to cook in batches. Preheat your air fryer to around 200°C for a few minutes before adding the chicken. Season the chicken breasts generously and place them in a single layer, making sure they don't overlap. This allows the hot air to circulate freely, giving you a crispy exterior and moist interior. Cooking time will vary depending on the thickness of the breasts, but typically ranges from 15 to 20 minutes per batch.</p>

<p>If you're meal prepping, consider slicing the chicken breasts into strips or cubes before cooking. This reduces cooking time and allows you to fit more in each batch. You can also marinate the chicken beforehand to add flavour and keep it moist during cooking. Remember to shake the basket or turn the chicken halfway through cooking for even browning. Once cooked, let the chicken rest for a few minutes before serving or storing.

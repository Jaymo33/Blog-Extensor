faqQ1: "How do I convert 456 F to Celsius for my fan oven?"
faqA1: "456 F converts to 235 C in a fan oven. This is the standard conversion used in UK kitchens, where you typically reduce the temperature by 20-25 degrees from conventional oven settings due to the fan's efficient heat distribution."
faqQ2: "Can I use the same cooking time when converting 456 F to fan oven?"
faqA2: "No, cooking times will be shorter when using the 456 F to fan oven equivalent (235 C). Fan ovens and air fryers cook food about 20% faster than conventional ovens, so start checking your food 5-10 minutes before the recipe's suggested time."
faqQ3: "Is 456 F too hot for air fryer cooking?"
faqA3: "456 F (235 C) is a perfectly safe temperature for most air fryers. This moderate-high heat works well for achieving crispy textures without burning. However, always check your specific air fryer model's maximum temperature rating in the manual."
faqQ4: "Why does my food cook differently at 456 F in an air fryer versus a fan oven?"
faqA4: "While both use convection principles, air fryers circulate heat more intensely in a smaller space. The 456 F equivalent (235 C) might produce slightly crispier results in an air fryer compared to a full-sized fan oven, especially for smaller food items."

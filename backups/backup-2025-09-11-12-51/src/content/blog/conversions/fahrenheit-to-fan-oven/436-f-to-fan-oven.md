faqQ2: "Can I use 436 F in all air fryer models?"
faqA2: "Most full-size air fryers can reach 436 F, but some compact models might have a maximum temperature of 400 F. Always check your specific model's capabilities before cooking."
faqQ3: "Why do fan ovens need lower temperatures than conventional ovens?"
faqA3: "Fan ovens circulate hot air continuously, cooking food more evenly and efficiently. This means they can achieve the same results at lower temperatures, saving energy and preventing drying out."
faqQ4: "What's the best way to check food is cooked at 436 F in a fan oven?"
faqA4: "Use a meat thermometer for proteins (75Â°C for chicken), and for baked goods, insert a skewer that should come out clean. Visual cues like golden colour also help determine doneness."

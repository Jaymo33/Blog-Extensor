faqQ1: "How do I convert 365°F to Celsius for a fan oven?"
faqA1: "365°F equals 180°C in a fan oven. Reduce conventional oven cooking times by 15–20% for fan settings, as the circulating air cooks food faster and more evenly."
faqQ2: "Can I use the same time for 365°F in an air fryer and fan oven?"
faqA2: "No—air fryers typically cook 5–10 minutes faster than fan ovens at 365°F (180°C fan). Always check food early and adjust based on your appliance’s performance."
faqQ3: "What foods cook best at 365°F in a fan oven?"
faqA3: "Roasted vegetables, chicken thighs, and baked goods like scones thrive at 180°C fan (365°F). For recipes, visit our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetables category</a>."
faqQ4: "Why does my fan oven cook unevenly at 365°F?"
faqA4: "Uneven cooking may stem from overcrowding or incorrect shelf placement. Use the middle rack, space food evenly, and rotate trays halfway through for consistent results."

<p>365°F converts to approximately 180°C in a fan oven, making it a moderate heat ideal for roasting, baking, and air frying. This temperature is commonly used for everything from crispy chicken to golden baked goods, ensuring even cooking without drying out your food. Whether you're using an air fryer or a conventional fan oven, understanding this conversion helps adapt recipes seamlessly.</p>

<h2>Why Convert 365°F to Fan Oven?</h2>
<p>Fan ovens circulate hot air for faster, more even cooking, so temperatures often need adjusting compared to conventional ovens or air fryers. Converting 365°F (185°C in a conventional oven) to 180°C in a fan oven accounts for this efficiency. Many recipes on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes</a> use this temperature for dishes like roasted vegetables or fish fillets. It’s also a safe starting point for reheating frozen foods without overcooking.</p>
<p>Air fryers, which work similarly to fan ovens, often list temperatures in Fahrenheit, especially in US-based recipes. Knowing that 365°F equals 180°C in a fan oven lets you replicate results accurately. For example, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> simplifies these adjustments for popular dishes like crispy potatoes or tofu.</p>

<h2>How to Adjust Cooking Times</h2>
<p>At 365°F (180°C fan), most foods cook 20% faster than in a conventional oven. For air fryers, reduce the time further by 5–10 minutes due to their compact size. For instance, chicken wings might take 25 minutes in a fan oven but just 18 in an air fryer. Always check food early and use a meat thermometer for precision.</p>
<p>Recipes like those in our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken category</a> often specify both time and temperature for fan ovens and air fryers. If a recipe only lists 365°F, assume it’s for a conventional oven and reduce the time by 15–20% for fan settings. Stirring or flipping food halfway through ensures even browning.</p>

<h3>Common Dishes at 365°F Fan</h3>
<p>This temperature works brilliantly for roasted vegetables, such as bell peppers or sweet potatoes, which caramelise beautifully without burning. It’s also ideal for baking cookies or reheating leftovers like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/meal-prep>meal prep dishes</a>. For frozen foods, check packaging for fan oven instructions—most recommend 180°C as a default.</p>

<h2>Air Fryer vs. Fan Oven at 365°F</h2>
<p>Air fryers achieve crispier results at 365°F (180°C fan) due to their rapid air circulation, while fan ovens offer more space for batch cooking. For example, fries crisp evenly in an air fryer but may need tossing in a fan oven. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning guide</a> helps maintain both appliances for consistent performance.</p>
<p>Energy efficiency differs too: air fryers use less power for small portions, whereas fan ovens excel for larger meals. If converting a 365°F air fryer recipe to a fan oven, increase the time slightly and monitor moisture levels—cover dishes with foil if drying out.</p>

<h3>Troubleshooting Temperature Issues</h3>
<p>If food browns too quickly at 365°F fan, lower the temperature by 10°C and extend the time. Conversely, undercooked food may need a higher shelf position or preheating. Calibrate your oven annually with a standalone thermometer for accuracy.</p>

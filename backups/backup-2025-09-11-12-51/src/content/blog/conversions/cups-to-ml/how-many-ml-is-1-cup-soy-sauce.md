<p>1.0 cups of soy sauce equals approximately 240 millilitres (ml). This conversion is essential for recipes where precision matters, especially when using an air fryer, as sauces can affect cooking times and textures. Whether you're marinating chicken or preparing a glaze, knowing the exact measurement ensures consistent results every time.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Soy Sauce Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Using the correct amount of soy sauce can make or break a dish. Too little, and your meal might lack depth; too much, and it could become overly salty. For air fryer recipes, like crispy tofu or glazed salmon, precise measurements ensure even cooking and perfect flavour balance. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for other common ingredient conversions.</p>  

<p>Many recipes, especially those from the US, use cup measurements, while UK cooks often prefer millilitres. If you're following an international recipe, converting 1.0 cups of soy sauce to ml (240ml) eliminates guesswork. This is particularly helpful for dishes like teriyaki chicken or stir-fried vegetables, where the sauce’s consistency is key.</p>  

<h2>How to Measure Soy Sauce Correctly</h2>  
<p>For the most accurate measurement, use a liquid measuring cup with clear ml markings. Pour the soy sauce to the 240ml line for 1.0 cups. If you don’t have a measuring cup, a standard UK metric jug works just as well. Avoid using dry measuring cups, as they won’t give you the precise volume needed for sauces.</p>  

<h3>Tips for Air Fryer Cooking with Soy Sauce</h3>  
<p>When using soy sauce in your air fryer, lightly coat ingredients rather than drenching them to prevent excess moisture. For example, a 240ml (1.0 cups) batch of marinade is perfect for 4-6 chicken thighs. Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>soy sauce-based recipes</a> for inspiration, from sticky ribs to crispy tofu.</p>  

<h2>Common Soy Sauce Conversions</h2>  
<p>Beyond 1.0 cups, here are other handy soy sauce conversions: ½ cup = 120ml, ¼ cup = 60ml, and 1 tablespoon = 15ml. These measurements are useful for smaller batches or adjusting recipes to taste.

<h3>Does Soy Sauce Brand Affect Volume?</h3>  
<p>Most soy sauces have a similar density, so 1.0 cups will consistently equal ~240ml, whether it’s Kikkoman, Lee Kum Kee, or supermarket brands. However, thicker varieties like tamari may slightly vary—always check the label if precision is critical.</p>  

<h2>Cleaning Your Air Fryer After Using Soy Sauce</h2>  
<p>Soy sauce can leave sticky residues in your air fryer basket. After cooking, wipe the basket with warm soapy water or use our recommended <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner</a> to maintain hygiene. For stubborn stains, a baking soda paste works wonders.</p>

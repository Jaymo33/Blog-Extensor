faqQ1: "Is 3.25 cups of double cream the same in the UK and US?"
faqA1: "No, UK and US cup measurements differ. A UK cup is 284 ml, while a US cup is 240 ml. This means 3.25 UK cups of double cream equal 923 ml, whereas 3.25 US cups equal 780 ml. Always check which measurement your recipe uses."
faqQ2: "Can I use a kitchen scale instead of measuring cups for double cream?"
faqA2: "Yes, weighing double cream can be more accurate. Double cream weighs roughly 240 grams per US cup (284 grams per UK cup). For 3.25 cups, you’d need about 780 grams (US) or 923 grams (UK). A scale eliminates conversion errors."
faqQ3: "How does double cream affect air fryer cooking times?"
faqA3: "Double cream’s high fat content can influence browning and texture in air fryer recipes. Dishes with cream may cook slightly faster due to added moisture, so monitor closely. Stick to the 768 ml equivalent for best results."
faqQ4: "What’s the best way to store leftover double cream after measuring?"
faqA4: "Store unused double cream in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 3 days. For longer storage, freeze it in measured portions (like 768 ml for 3.25 cups) and thaw before use. Shake well after thawing to restore consistency."

<p>Double cream is a staple in many British recipes, from scones to custards. Its high fat content means it behaves differently than single cream or milk, making accuracy crucial.

<h3>How to Measure Double Cream Correctly</h3>

This means 3.25 US cups of double cream is 780 ml, whereas 3.25 UK cups is 923 ml—so always check which cup measurement your recipe uses.

Many air fryer recipes, like our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>cake collection</a>, call for precise cream measurements to achieve the ideal consistency.</p>  

<p>Double cream also whips beautifully, making it ideal for toppings or fillings. Knowing that 3.25 cups equals roughly 768 ml helps when scaling recipes up or down.

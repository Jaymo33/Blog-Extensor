faqQ1: "Is 3.5 cups of honey the same in the UK and US?"
faqA1: "No, UK and US cup measurements differ slightly. A US cup is about 236.6 ml, while a UK cup is 284 ml. So, 3.5 US cups equal roughly 828 ml, whereas 3.5 UK cups equal around 994 ml. Always check which standard your recipe uses."
faqQ2: "Can I use a kitchen scale instead of measuring cups for honey?"
faqA2: "Yes! Honey weighs about 1.42 grams per ml. For 828 ml (3.5 US cups), you’d need approximately 1,175 grams. A digital scale ensures accuracy, especially for air fryer recipes where precise measurements prevent burning or uneven cooking."
faqQ3: "What’s the best way to measure sticky ingredients like honey?"
faqA3: "Lightly grease your measuring cup with oil or spray to help honey slide out easily. Use a liquid measuring cup with a spout for better control. For sticky recipes, like those on airfryerrecipe.co.uk, this method ensures clean, accurate measurements."
faqQ4: "How long does 3.5 cups of honey last in recipes?"
faqA4: "It depends on the recipe. For glazes or marinades, 3.5 cups can cover multiple batches—great for meal prep. For baking, it might make several cakes or cookies. Check our dessert section for ideas on using larger honey quantities efficiently."

<p>3.5 cups of honey equals approximately 828 ml, making it easy to measure for your air fryer recipes. Whether you're whipping up a glaze or a sweet marinade, precise measurements ensure the best results.

<h2>Why Accurate Honey Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of honey can make or break a recipe, especially in air fryer cooking where consistency is key. Too much honey can lead to overly sticky or burnt results, while too little might leave your dish lacking flavour. That’s why knowing how many ml are in 3.5 cups of honey is essential for both baking and cooking. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more handy measurement tips.</p>  

<p>Honey’s viscosity means it doesn’t pour like water, so measuring by volume can be tricky. A digital scale can help, but if you’re working with cups, converting to millilitres ensures precision. Whether you're making honey-glazed chicken or a sweet dessert in your air fryer, getting the conversion right guarantees success.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure Honey Correctly</h3>  
<p>To measure 3.5 cups of honey accurately, lightly grease your measuring cup first—this helps the honey slide out easily. Pour slowly and level off the top with a straight edge. For sticky ingredients like honey, a liquid measuring cup with a spout works best.

faqQ1: "Does the type of maple syrup affect the ml measurement for 1.5 cups?"
faqA1: "No, the type of maple syrup (whether light, dark, or amber) doesn’t change the volume. 1.5 cups will always equal 355 ml, regardless of the syrup’s grade or thickness. However, thicker syrups may require a bit more care when measuring to ensure accuracy."
faqQ2: "Can I use this conversion for other liquid sweeteners like honey or agave?"
faqA2: "While 1.5 cups of any liquid sweetener will technically measure 355 ml, their weights and viscosities differ. Honey, for example, is denser than maple syrup, so weight-based measurements (grams) are more reliable for swapping them in recipes. Always adjust cooking times in your air fryer accordingly."
faqQ3: "Why is my air fryer recipe too sweet when I use 1.5 cups (355 ml) of maple syrup?"
faqA3: "Air fryers intensify flavours as they concentrate sauces and glazes during cooking. If a recipe tastes overly sweet, try reducing the maple syrup by 10-20% (to ~300 ml) or balancing it with acidic ingredients like lemon juice or vinegar. Taste as you go for best results."
faqQ4: "How do I measure 1.5 cups (355 ml) of maple syrup without a measuring cup?"
faqA4: "If you don’t have a measuring cup, use a standard 330 ml soda can as a rough guide—fill it to the top plus a little extra to reach 355 ml. For precision, a kitchen scale is best: 1.5 cups of maple syrup weighs approximately 510 grams. Always level off the syrup for accuracy."

faqQ1: "Is 2.0 cups of half and half the same in the UK and US?"
faqA1: "Yes, 2.0 cups of half and half equals 473 ml in both the UK and US. While cup sizes can vary slightly in other ingredients, half and half’s liquid measurement remains consistent. Always use a liquid measuring cup for accuracy."
faqQ2: "Can I use milk instead of half and half in air fryer recipes?"
faqA2: "You can substitute milk, but the texture and richness will differ. Half and half contains more fat, which affects creaminess. For best results, stick to the recipe or adjust other ingredients to compensate."
faqQ3: "How do I store leftover half and half after measuring 2.0 cups?"
faqA3: "Store opened half and half in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 7 days. Shake well before using, as separation can occur. Freezing isn’t recommended, as it alters the texture."
faqQ4: "Why is my air fryer recipe too runny with 2.0 cups of half and half?"
faqA4: "If your dish is too liquid, you may need to adjust cooking time or temperature. Air fryers vary, so monitor closely. Alternatively, reduce the half and half slightly or thicken with cornstarch."

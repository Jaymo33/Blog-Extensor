faqQ1: "Does bottled lemon juice measure the same as fresh for 3.0 cups to ml?"
faqA1: "Yes, bottled lemon juice measures the same as fresh when converting 3.0 cups to ml (710 ml). However, fresh juice often has a brighter flavour. If using bottled, check the label to ensure it’s 100% juice without additives that could alter taste or consistency."
faqQ2: "Can I use this conversion for other citrus juices like lime or orange?"
faqA2: "Absolutely! The conversion applies to any liquid, including lime or orange juice. Just remember that acidity and sweetness vary, so adjust other recipe ingredients accordingly. For air fryer glazes or marinades, test small batches first."
faqQ3: "How do I measure 3.0 cups of lemon juice without a measuring jug?"
faqA3: "If you don’t have a jug, use a standard cup measure (240 ml per US cup) and multiply. Three cups equal 710 ml. For smaller increments, a tablespoon holds 15 ml, so 47 tablespoons would approximate 3.0 cups—though this method is less precise."
faqQ4: "Why does my air fryer recipe taste too lemony after using 3.0 cups of juice?"
faqA4: "Air fryers intensify flavours due to concentrated heat. If a dish tastes overly tart, reduce the lemon juice slightly or balance it with sweetness (honey or sugar) or fat (olive oil). Always taste marinades before cooking and adjust as needed."

faqQ1: "Is 1.25 cups of double cream the same in the UK and US?"
faqA1: "Yes, 1.25 cups of double cream is the same volume in both the UK and US, equalling approximately 296 ml. However, double cream in the UK has a higher fat content (around 48%) compared to heavy cream in the US (36–40%). For air fryer recipes, this slight difference may affect richness but not the volume measurement."
faqQ2: "Can I use single cream instead of double cream in this measurement?"
faqA2: "You can substitute single cream, but the texture and richness will differ. Single cream has a lower fat content, so 1.25 cups (296 ml) will yield a lighter result. For air fryer recipes like custards or sauces, double cream is preferred for its stability and creaminess. Adjust other ingredients if needed to compensate."
faqQ3: "How do I measure 1.25 cups of double cream without a measuring cup?"
faqA3: "If you don’t have a measuring cup, use a metric jug to measure 296 ml directly. Alternatively, a standard tablespoon holds about 15 ml, so 20 tablespoons would roughly equal 1.25 cups. For accuracy, especially in air fryer baking, investing in a measuring cup or jug is recommended."
faqQ4: "Does double cream whip better at certain measurements?"
faqA4: "Double cream whips best when cold and in smaller batches. While 1.25 cups (296 ml) is manageable, larger quantities may not whip evenly. For air fryer desserts like mousses or toppings, whip the cream in stages for the best results. Always chill your bowl and beaters beforehand for optimal volume."

<h2>How to Measure Double Cream Correctly</h2>

For 1.25 cups (296 ml), fill the cup to the 1-cup mark, then add another quarter cup. If you’re using a metric measuring jug, simply pour until you reach 296 ml. This method works perfectly for air fryer dishes like creamy gratins or indulgent desserts.</p>

These conversions are handy for scaling recipes up or down. Whether you’re making a small batch of air fryer cheesecake or a family-sized creamy casserole, precise measurements ensure success.</p>

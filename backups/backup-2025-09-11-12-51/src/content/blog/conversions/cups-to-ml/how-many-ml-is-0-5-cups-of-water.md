faqQ1: "Is 0.5 cups of water the same in the US and UK?"
faqA1: "No, US and UK cup measurements differ slightly. 0.5 US cups equal 118.29 ml, while 0.5 UK cups equal 142 ml. Most modern recipes, including air fryer ones, default to US measurements unless stated otherwise."
faqQ2: "Can I use a kitchen scale instead of measuring cups for water?"
faqA2: "Absolutely! Since 1 ml of water weighs 1 gram, 0.5 cups (118.29 ml) equals approximately 118 grams. A kitchen scale provides even greater accuracy than volume measurements, especially for baking."
faqQ3: "Why do air fryer recipes sometimes use ml instead of cups?"
faqA3: "Ml measurements are more precise, reducing errors in small-batch recipes. For example, 118.29 ml (0.5 cups) of water ensures consistent texture in batters or steam-based cooking. Many <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> recipes prefer ml for reliability."
faqQ4: "How do I measure 0.5 cups of water without tools?"
faqA4: "Use household items: 8 UK tablespoons (15 ml each) approximate 0.5 cups (120 ml). A standard teacup holds about 150 ml, so fill it just under halfway. For exact amounts, invest in measuring jugs marked with ml and cups."

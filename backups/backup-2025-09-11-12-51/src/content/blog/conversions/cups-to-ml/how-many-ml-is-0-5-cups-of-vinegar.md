faqQ1: "Is 0.5 cups of vinegar the same in the UK and US?"
faqA1: "No, there's a slight difference. In the UK, 0.5 cups of vinegar is 125 ml, while in the US, it's 120 ml. Most recipes, including those on airfryerrecipe.co.uk, use 118 ml for simplicity."

faqA3: "Vinegar adds tang and helps tenderise meats. In an air fryer, 0.5 cups (118 ml) is perfect for marinades or glazes, but avoid excess liquid to prevent steaming instead of crisping."
faqQ4: "What if my recipe uses tablespoons instead of cups?"
faqA4: "0.5 cups of vinegar equals 8 tablespoons or 24 teaspoons. For smaller amounts, use this conversion: 1 tablespoon = 15 ml, so 8 tablespoons = 120 ml (close to 118 ml)."

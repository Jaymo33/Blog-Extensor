faqQ1: "Is 0.5 cups of double cream the same in the UK and USA?"
faqA1: "Yes, 0.5 cups of double cream is approximately 118 ml in both the UK and USA. However, double cream in the UK has a slightly higher fat content (around 48%) compared to heavy cream in the USA (36–40%). For air fryer recipes, this difference may affect richness but not the ml measurement."
faqQ2: "Can I use single cream instead of double cream in air fryer recipes?"
faqA2: "Single cream can be substituted, but it has a lower fat content (around 18%), which may affect texture. For sauces or baked goods, you might need to adjust cooking times slightly. If using 0.5 cups (118 ml) of single cream, consider adding a thickening agent like cornflour for better results."
faqQ3: "How do I convert 0.5 cups of double cream to grams?"
faqA3: "0.5 cups (118 ml) of double cream weighs roughly 120 grams. This conversion is useful for recipes requiring weight measurements. Use a kitchen scale for accuracy, especially when baking in the air fryer."
faqQ4: "Why does my double cream split in the air fryer?"
faqA4: "Double cream can split if heated too quickly or at high temperatures. To avoid this, heat it gradually or mix it with other ingredients first. Stirring occasionally and using the air fryer’s lower temperature settings also helps maintain a smooth consistency."

Let’s dive deeper into why this measurement matters and how to use it.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on precise ingredient ratios to deliver even cooking and perfect textures. Using 118 ml of double cream instead of guessing ensures your dish isn’t too dry or overly rich. Many air fryer recipes, like those in our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipes</a> section, depend on exact liquid measurements for consistency. Double cream, with its high fat content, can behave differently if measured incorrectly. A slight variation might affect the outcome of baked goods or sauces.</p>  

<p>For example, a creamy pasta sauce made in the air fryer needs the right balance of double cream to avoid splitting. Similarly, desserts like custards or mousses require precise ml measurements for the perfect set. Always use a liquid measuring jug for accuracy, especially when converting cups to ml. This small step can make a big difference in your air fryer creations.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure 0.5 Cups of Double Cream Correctly</h3>  
<p>To measure 0.5 cups (118 ml) of double cream, use a clear liquid measuring jug with ml markings. Pour the cream slowly to the 118 ml line for accuracy. Avoid using dry measuring cups, as they can lead to uneven amounts. For sticky ingredients like double cream, lightly grease the measuring jug for easy pouring. This method ensures you get the exact ml needed for your air fryer recipe.</p>

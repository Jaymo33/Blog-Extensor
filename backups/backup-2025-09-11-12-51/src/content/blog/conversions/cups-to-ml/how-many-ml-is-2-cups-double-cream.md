faqQ1: "Is 2.0 cups of double cream the same in the UK and USA?"
faqA1: "Yes, 2.0 cups of double cream measure the same in both the UK and USA, equalling 473 ml. However, double cream in the UK has a higher fat content (around 48%) compared to heavy cream in the USA (36-40%), which may affect texture in recipes."
faqQ2: "Can I use single cream instead of double cream if I adjust the quantity?"
faqA2: "Single cream has a lower fat content, so substituting it 1:1 wonâ€™t give the same richness. If replacing, use slightly less liquid (about 10% less) or thicken with a cornflour slurry for similar consistency in air fryer recipes."
faqQ3: "How do I store leftover double cream after measuring 2.0 cups?"
faqA3: "Transfer unused double cream to an airtight container and refrigerate for up to 3 days. For longer storage, freeze it in measured portions (like 473 ml for 2.0 cups) and thaw in the fridge before use."
faqQ4: "Why does my air fryer recipe need exact measurements for double cream?"
faqA4: "Air fryers cook quickly and evenly, so precise measurements prevent dishes from becoming too watery or overly dense. For best results, always convert measurements like 2.0 cups of double cream to millilitres (473 ml) for accuracy."

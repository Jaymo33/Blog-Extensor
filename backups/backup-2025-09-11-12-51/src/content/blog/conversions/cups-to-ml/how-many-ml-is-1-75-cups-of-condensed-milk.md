faqQ1: "Is 1.75 cups of condensed milk the same as one can?"
faqA1: "No, 1.75 cups of condensed milk (414 ml) is slightly more than a standard 14-ounce can, which holds about 1.25 cups (296 ml). You’d need approximately 1.4 cans to match 1.75 cups. For air fryer recipes, it’s best to measure precisely using ml or a kitchen scale."
faqQ2: "Can I use evaporated milk instead of condensed milk in a 1.75-cup measurement?"
faqA2: "Evaporated milk isn’t a direct substitute for condensed milk, as it lacks the added sugar. If your air fryer recipe calls for 1.75 cups of condensed milk (414 ml), using evaporated milk will alter the sweetness and texture. Consider adding sugar or looking for a modified recipe."
faqQ3: "How do I measure 1.75 cups of condensed milk without a measuring cup?"
faqA3: "If you don’t have a measuring cup, use a kitchen scale: 1.75 cups of condensed milk weighs roughly 530 grams. Alternatively, a standard UK tablespoon holds 15 ml, so 414 ml equals about 28 tablespoons. This method works in a pinch for air fryer recipes."
faqQ4: "Why do some air fryer recipes use ml instead of cups for condensed milk?"
faqA4: "Ml measurements are more precise, especially for thick liquids like condensed milk. Air fryers cook quickly, so accuracy ensures consistent results. Many international recipes (and UK-based sites like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>) use ml for reliability."

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on even heat distribution, so using the right amount of condensed milk ensures your recipes cook perfectly. Too much or too little can affect texture and taste, especially in baked goods. For example, a cheesecake or fudge made in the air fryer needs precise measurements to set correctly. Explore more <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> that use condensed milk for inspiration.</p>  

<p>Condensed milk is thicker than regular milk, so measuring by volume (cups) can sometimes be tricky. Converting to millilitres (ml) gives you a more accurate measurement, especially for international recipes. If you’re using a UK or US measuring cup, note that 1 cup equals 236.6 ml, making 1.75 cups roughly 414 ml. Always double-check your conversions to avoid mishaps.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure Condensed Milk Correctly</h3>  
<p>To measure 1.75 cups of condensed milk accurately, use a liquid measuring cup with ml markings. Spoon the condensed milk into the cup without packing it down, then level it off with a knife. For sticky ingredients like condensed milk, lightly greasing the measuring cup can help it slide out easily. This method ensures you get the exact 414 ml needed for your recipe.</p>  

<h2>Common Recipes Using 1.75 Cups of Condensed Milk</h2>  
<p>Many air fryer desserts, like tres leches cake or caramel flan, call for 1.75 cups of condensed milk.

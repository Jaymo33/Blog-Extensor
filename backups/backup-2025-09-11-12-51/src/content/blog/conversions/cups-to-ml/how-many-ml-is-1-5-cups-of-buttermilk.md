<p>1.5 cups of buttermilk equals 355 ml, making it easy to measure for your air fryer recipes. Whether you're whipping up pancakes, fried chicken, or a cake, knowing this conversion ensures your dishes turn out perfectly every time. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we love helping you nail those measurements for flawless cooking.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Buttermilk Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of buttermilk is crucial for texture and flavour in recipes. Too little can leave baked goods dry, while too much may make them soggy. Air fryer recipes, like crispy fried chicken or fluffy pancakes, rely on precise liquid ratios. That’s why converting 1.5 cups of buttermilk to ml (355 ml) is so handy—it eliminates guesswork. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more helpful measurement swaps.</p>  

<p>Buttermilk’s acidity also plays a role in tenderising meats and activating baking soda. If you’re making air fryer fried chicken, the 1.5 cups (355 ml) measurement ensures the marinade works its magic. For baking, accuracy means your cakes rise evenly. No more kitchen disasters—just perfect results every time.</p>  

<h3>US vs UK Cup Measurements</h3>  
<p>While 1.5 cups of buttermilk equals 355 ml in the US, UK cups differ slightly. A UK cup holds 284 ml, meaning 1.5 UK cups would be 426 ml. Always check your recipe’s origin to avoid mishaps. Most modern UK recipes use metric measurements, so 355 ml (US standard) is widely accepted.

<h2>How to Measure Buttermilk Without a Cup</h2>  
<p>No measuring cups? No problem. Use a kitchen scale: 1.5 cups (355 ml) of buttermilk weighs roughly 363 grams. Alternatively, a standard UK tablespoon holds 15 ml, so 24 tablespoons equal 355 ml. For smaller quantities, a teaspoon (5 ml) can help fine-tune measurements. Precision matters, especially for air fryer recipes where liquid ratios affect crispiness.</p>  

<p>Another trick is repurposing a water or soda bottle with millilitre markings. Just pour buttermilk up to the 355 ml line. If you’re adapting a family recipe, note these conversions for consistency.

<h3>Buttermilk Substitutes in a Pinch</h3>  
<p>Out of buttermilk? Mix 1.5 cups (355 ml) of milk with 2 tablespoons of lemon juice or vinegar. Let it sit for 5 minutes to thicken. Yogurt thinned with milk (1:1 ratio) also works. These swaps mimic buttermilk’s acidity, crucial for air fryer recipes like tender fried chicken or fluffy scones. For dairy-free options, try almond milk with lemon juice—though the flavour may vary slightly.</p>  

<h2>Best Air Fryer Recipes Using 1.5 Cups Buttermilk</h2>

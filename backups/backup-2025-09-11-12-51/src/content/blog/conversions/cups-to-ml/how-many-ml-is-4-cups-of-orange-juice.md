faqQ1: "Is 4.0 cups of orange juice the same in UK and US measurements?"
faqA1: "Yes, 4.0 cups of orange juice equals 946 ml in both UK and US measurements. While UK cups are slightly larger (284 ml vs 236.6 ml), the difference is negligible for most recipes. For air fryer cooking, the 4.0 cups to ml conversion remains consistent."
faqQ2: "Can I use bottled orange juice instead of fresh for air fryer recipes?"
faqA2: "Absolutely! Bottled orange juice works fine when converting 4.0 cups to ml for air fryer recipes. Just check for added sugars, which may affect browning. Fresh juice offers brighter flavour, but bottled provides convenience without sacrificing the 946 ml measurement accuracy."
faqQ3: "How long does orange juice marinade need in the air fryer?"
faqA3: "When using 4.0 cups (946 ml) of orange juice in a marinade, most proteins need 15-30 minutes in the air fryer. The high heat cooks quickly, so watch for caramelisation. Always pat meats dry before air frying to ensure crispiness despite the liquid measurement."
faqQ4: "What's the best way to reduce 4.0 cups of orange juice for a glaze?"
faqA4: "To reduce 4.0 cups (946 ml) of orange juice, simmer until halved (about 473 ml). This concentrates flavour without altering the original measurement's proportions. Use reduced glaze sparingly in the air fryer to prevent smoking from sugar caramelisation."

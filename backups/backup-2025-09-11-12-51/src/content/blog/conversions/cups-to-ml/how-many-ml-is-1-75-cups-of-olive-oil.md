faqQ1: "Is 1.75 cups of olive oil the same in UK and US measurements?"
faqA1: "While UK and US cup sizes differ slightly (UK cups are 284 ml, US cups are 236.59 ml), most modern recipes use the US standard. For 1.75 cups, this means 414 ml in US measurements. Always check your recipe’s origin to confirm."
faqQ2: "Can I use a kitchen scale instead of measuring cups for olive oil?"
faqA2: "Yes! Olive oil weighs approximately 0.92 grams per ml, so 414 ml (1.75 cups) would be about 381 grams. A digital kitchen scale provides precise measurements, especially useful for baking or large batches."
faqQ3: "What’s the best way to measure 1.75 cups of olive oil without a jug?"
faqA3: "Use tablespoons (15 ml each) – you’ll need about 28 tablespoons for 414 ml. Alternatively, a standard 250 ml measuring cup plus another 164 ml (roughly two-thirds of a cup) will get you close."
faqQ4: "Does olive oil type affect the ml measurement for 1.75 cups?"
faqA4: "No, the volume remains the same (414 ml) regardless of whether it’s extra virgin or light olive oil. However, flavour and smoke points vary, so choose based on your cooking method. For air frying, lighter oils handle heat better."

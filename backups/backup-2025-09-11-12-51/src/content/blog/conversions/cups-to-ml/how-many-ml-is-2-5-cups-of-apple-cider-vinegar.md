faqQ1: "Is 2.5 cups of apple cider vinegar the same in the UK and US?"
faqA1: "No, UK and US cup measurements differ slightly. A US cup is 236.588 ml, while a UK cup is 284.131 ml. However, most modern recipes use the US standard, so 2.5 cups of apple cider vinegar would be 591.47 ml unless specified otherwise."
faqQ2: "Can I use a kitchen scale to measure 2.5 cups of apple cider vinegar in ml?"
faqA2: "While a kitchen scale can measure liquids by weight, it's less accurate for volume conversions like 2.5 cups (591.47 ml) of apple cider vinegar. A liquid measuring cup with millilitre markings is the best tool for precise results in air fryer recipes."
faqQ3: "What if my recipe calls for 2.5 cups of apple cider vinegar but I only have a 500 ml bottle?"
faqA3: "2.5 cups equal 591.47 ml, so a 500 ml bottle won't be quite enough. You'd need an additional 91.47 ml (about 6 tablespoons) to match the recipe. Consider scaling the recipe down or using a combination of vinegar and water if needed."
faqQ4: "How long does 2.5 cups of apple cider vinegar last once opened?"
faqA4: "An opened bottle of apple cider vinegar lasts about 2 years if stored properly. Keep it in a cool, dark place with the lid tightly sealed. For best quality in recipes like air fryer marinades, use it within a year for optimal flavour."

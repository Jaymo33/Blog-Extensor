faqQ1: "Is 3.5 cups of almond milk the same in UK and US measurements?"
faqA1: "No, UK and US cup sizes differ slightly. In the UK, 1 cup equals 284 ml, while in the US, it’s 240 ml. Our conversion of 3.5 cups to 828 ml uses the US standard. Always check your recipe’s origin to avoid measurement discrepancies."
faqQ2: "Can I use 3.5 cups of almond milk in any air fryer recipe calling for dairy milk?"
faqA2: "Yes, almond milk works as a 1:1 substitute for dairy milk in most recipes. However, its slightly thinner consistency may affect texture in custards or béchamel. For best results, stick to the 828 ml measurement and adjust cooking times if needed."
faqQ3: "How do I measure 3.5 cups of almond milk without a jug?"
faqA3: "If you lack a measuring jug, use a standard 240 ml (US) cup and fill it 3.5 times for 828 ml total. For smaller quantities, tablespoons (15 ml) or a kitchen scale (1 ml = 1 gram for almond milk) can help. Accuracy matters, especially in baking."
faqQ4: "Does almond milk’s brand affect the 3.5 cups to ml conversion?"
faqA4: "No, the 828 ml measurement remains consistent across brands, as almond milk’s density is similar to water. However, thicker “barista” versions may vary slightly. For precision, stick to plain unsweetened almond milk and measure by volume, not weight."

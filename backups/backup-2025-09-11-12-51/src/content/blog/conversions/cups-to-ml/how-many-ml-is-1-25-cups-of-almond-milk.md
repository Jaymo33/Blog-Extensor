faqQ1: "Is 1.25 cups of almond milk the same in the UK and US?"
faqA1: "Yes, 1.25 cups of almond milk is approximately 295.74 ml in both the UK and US. While cup sizes can vary slightly by country, the difference is negligible for most recipes, especially in air fryer cooking where precision is key."
faqQ2: "Can I use a different plant-based milk instead of almond milk in this measurement?"
faqA2: "Absolutely! Soy, oat, or coconut milk can substitute almond milk at a 1:1 ratio. Just note that thicker milks like coconut might slightly alter texture, so adjust other liquids if needed. The 295.74 ml measurement remains the same."
faqQ3: "How do I measure 1.25 cups of almond milk if I only have a 1-cup measure?"
faqA3: "Fill the 1-cup measure to the top, then add another 1/4 cup. Alternatively, use a tablespoon—1.25 cups equals 20 tablespoons (since 1 cup is 16 tbsp). This method ensures you hit the 295.74 ml mark accurately."
faqQ4: "Why does my air fryer recipe taste different when I use almond milk?"
faqA4: "Almond milk has a subtly nutty flavour and lower fat content than dairy milk, which can affect taste and browning. For crispier results, try spraying your food with oil before air frying. The 295.74 ml measurement stays consistent, but flavour adjustments might be needed."

faqQ1: "Is 2.5 cups of cream the same in the UK and US?"
faqA1: "No, UK and US cup measurements differ slightly. A UK cup is 284 ml, while a US cup is 240 ml. For 2.5 cups of cream, this means 591.47 ml in the US and 710 ml in the UK. Most modern recipes use the US standard, so always check the recipe origin."
faqQ2: "Can I use a kitchen scale to measure 2.5 cups of cream in ml?"
faqA2: "Yes, many digital kitchen scales have a millilitre setting for liquids like cream. Simply set your scale to ml, place a container on it, and pour until you reach 591.47 ml (for 2.5 US cups). This method is often more accurate than using measuring cups."
faqQ3: "What’s the best way to measure whipped cream for recipes?"
faqA3: "Always measure cream before whipping, as its volume increases significantly once aerated. If your recipe calls for 2.5 cups of whipped cream, start with roughly 1.25 cups (295.74 ml) of liquid cream, then whip it to double the volume."
faqQ4: "How long does 2.5 cups of cream last in the fridge?"
faqA4: "Once opened, cream lasts about 5 days in the fridge if stored in an airtight container. For longer storage, freeze it in portions—though thawed cream is best used in cooking rather than whipping. Always check for off smells or curdling before use."

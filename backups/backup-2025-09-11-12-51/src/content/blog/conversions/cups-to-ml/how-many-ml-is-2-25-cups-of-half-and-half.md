faqQ1: "Can I use 2.25 cups of half and half in a vegan air fryer recipe?"
faqA1: "Half and half is a dairy product, so it’s not suitable for vegan recipes. However, you can substitute it with a plant-based alternative like coconut cream or almond milk mixed with a bit of oil. For 2.25 cups (532.32 ml), use 532 ml of your preferred vegan creamer to maintain the recipe’s consistency."
faqQ2: "Why does my air fryer recipe call for half and half instead of milk?"
faqA2: "Half and half adds a richer, creamier texture compared to milk, which is ideal for sauces, custards, and baked goods. The higher fat content (10–12%) helps create a smoother finish in air fryer dishes. If you substitute milk, the result may be less indulgent, so stick to 2.25 cups (532.32 ml) of half and half for the best outcome."
faqQ3: "How do I measure 2.25 cups of half and half without a measuring cup?"
faqA3: "If you don’t have a measuring cup, use a kitchen scale. Half and half weighs roughly 236 grams per cup, so 2.25 cups would be about 532 grams. Alternatively, a standard mug holds roughly 250 ml, so just over two mugs would give you close to 532.32 ml. For precision, though, investing in a measuring cup is best."
faqQ4: "Does half and half behave differently in an air fryer compared to an oven?"
faqA4: "In an air fryer, half and half may reduce or thicken faster due to the intense, circulating heat. Keep an eye on sauces or custards to prevent overcooking. For recipes calling for 2.25 cups (532.32 ml), you might need to adjust cooking times slightly compared to oven baking. Stirring occasionally can help distribute heat evenly."

<p>2.25 cups of half and half is equivalent to approximately 532.32 millilitres (ml). This conversion is essential for precise cooking and baking, especially when using an air fryer where accurate measurements can make or break a recipe. Whether you’re whipping up a creamy sauce or baking a decadent dessert, knowing how to convert cups to millilitres ensures consistency and perfect results every time.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>When using an air fryer, precise measurements are crucial because the cooking process is faster and more intense than traditional methods. Too much or too little liquid, like half and half, can affect texture and flavour. For example, adding too much half and half to a batter might make it too runny, while too little could result in a dry, crumbly finish. That’s why converting 2.25 cups of half and half to ml (532.32 ml) is so important for air fryer recipes.</p>  
<p>If you’re exploring new recipes, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipe collection</a> for inspiration. Many of these dishes rely on precise measurements to achieve the perfect balance of flavours and textures. Whether you’re making a creamy pasta sauce or a rich dessert, knowing how to convert cups to millilitres will help you nail the recipe every time.</p>  

<h2>How to Measure Half and Half Correctly</h2>  
<p>Measuring half and half accurately starts with using the right tools. A liquid measuring cup is ideal for this task, as it allows you to see the exact volume at eye level. Pour the half and half slowly into the cup until it reaches the 2.25-cup mark. For even greater precision, a kitchen scale can be used to weigh the half and half, as 532.32 ml of half and half weighs roughly 532 grams.</p>  
<p>If you’re working with a recipe that calls for millilitres, a measuring jug with ml markings is your best bet. Simply fill it to the 532 ml line for 2.25 cups of half and half. This method eliminates guesswork and ensures your air fryer dishes turn out perfectly every time.

<h3>US vs UK Measurements</h3>  
<p>It’s worth noting that cup measurements can vary slightly between the US and UK. In the US, 1 cup is 240 ml, while in the UK, it’s 250 ml. For this conversion, we’ve used the US standard (2.25 cups x 236.59 ml per cup = 532.32 ml). If you’re following a UK recipe, double-check the cup size to avoid discrepancies. Most modern recipes specify which measurement system they use, but when in doubt, stick to millilitres for accuracy.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for Half and Half in Air Fryer Recipes</h2>  
<p>Half and half is a versatile ingredient that adds richness to both savoury and sweet dishes. In air fryer cooking, it’s often used in creamy sauces, custards, and even some baked goods. For example, a classic mac and cheese made in the air fryer might call for 2.25 cups of half and half to create a smooth, velvety cheese sauce. Similarly, a bread pudding or French toast casserole could use this measurement for a luscious, creamy texture.</p>

<h3>Substitutes for Half and Half</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have half and half on hand, you can make a substitute by mixing equal parts whole milk and heavy cream. For 2.25 cups (532.32 ml), combine 1.125 cups of milk with 1.125 cups of cream. This blend will mimic the richness and texture of half and half, ensuring your air fryer recipes turn out just as delicious. Alternatively, evaporated milk or a plant-based creamer can work in a pinch, though the flavour and consistency may vary slightly.</p>  

<h2>Tips for Storing Half and Half</h2>  
<p>To keep half and half fresh, always store it in the refrigerator at or below 4°C. Once opened, it should be used within 7–10 days for the best quality. If you’ve measured out 2.25 cups (532.32 ml) but don’t need it all, transfer the remaining half and half to an airtight container to prevent spoilage. For longer storage, half and half can be frozen, though it may separate slightly when thawed. Stir well before using it in your air fryer recipes.</p>

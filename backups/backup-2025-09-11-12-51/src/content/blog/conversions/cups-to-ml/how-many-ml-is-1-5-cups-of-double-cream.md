faqQ1: "Is 1.5 cups of double cream the same in the UK and the US?"
faqA1: "Yes, 1.5 cups of double cream is the same volume in both the UK and the US, equalling approximately 355 ml. However, double cream in the UK has a higher fat content (around 48%) compared to heavy cream in the US (36–40%), which may affect texture in recipes."
faqQ2: "Can I use single cream instead of double cream in air fryer recipes?"
faqA2: "You can substitute single cream, but the result will be less rich and may not thicken as well. For best results, stick to double cream or mix single cream with a bit of butter to mimic the fat content."
faqQ3: "How do I measure 1.5 cups of double cream without a measuring cup?"
faqA3: "Use a kitchen scale—1.5 cups of double cream weighs about 360 grams. Alternatively, a standard mug holds roughly 250 ml, so 1.5 cups would be slightly less than 1.5 mugs."
faqQ4: "Why does my air fryer recipe call for millilitres instead of cups?"
faqA4: "Millilitres provide a more precise measurement, which is crucial for air fryer cooking where small discrepancies can affect texture and cooking time. Many modern recipes, especially outside the US, use metric measurements for accuracy."

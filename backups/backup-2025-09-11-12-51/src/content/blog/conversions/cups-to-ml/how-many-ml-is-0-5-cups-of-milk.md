faqQ1: "Is 0.5 cups of milk the same as 120 ml?"
faqA1: "No, 0.5 cups of milk is approximately 118 ml, not 120 ml. While the difference is small, it can matter in precise recipes like baking or air fryer custards. Always use exact measurements for best results."
faqQ2: "Can I use a kitchen scale to measure 0.5 cups of milk in ml?"
faqA2: "Yes, but you'll need to know the density of milk. Since milk weighs roughly 1.03 grams per ml, 118 ml of milk would be about 122 grams. A liquid measuring cup is simpler for direct ml measurements."
faqQ3: "Does the type of milk affect the ml measurement for 0.5 cups?"
faqA3: "No, the volume remains the same (118 ml for 0.5 cups) whether you use whole, skim, or plant-based milk. However, fat content and viscosity may slightly affect weight if using a scale instead of volume measurements."
faqQ4: "How do I measure 0.5 cups of milk without a measuring cup?"
faqA4: "You can use a standard drinking glass, but sizes vary. A better method is using tablespoons: 0.5 cups equals 8 tablespoons (1 tbsp = 15 ml, so 8 x 15 = 120 ml, close enough for most recipes). For air fryer cooking, investing in proper measuring tools is best."

faqQ1: "Is 3.25 cups of coconut oil the same in the UK and USA?"
faqA1: "Yes, 3.25 cups of coconut oil equals 768 ml in both the UK and USA. Cup measurements are standardized for volume, so the conversion remains consistent. However, always double-check if using a recipe with regional variations."
faqQ2: "Can I use 768 ml of coconut oil for deep frying in an air fryer?"
faqA2: "Air fryers require far less oil than traditional deep frying. For most recipes, a light coating (1-2 tbsp) is sufficient. Using 768 ml would be excessive and could cause smoking or uneven cooking. Stick to smaller amounts for best results."
faqQ3: "How should I store leftover coconut oil after measuring 3.25 cups?"
faqA3: "Store unused coconut oil in a cool, dark place or the refrigerator. It solidifies below 24°C but remelts easily. Ensure the container is airtight to prevent absorption of other flavours. Proper storage keeps it fresh for months."
faqQ4: "What’s the best way to measure 3.25 cups of coconut oil if I don’t have a measuring jug?"
faqA4: "Use a kitchen scale: 3.25 cups of coconut oil weighs roughly 720 grams. Alternatively, fill a standard 250 ml mug three full times, then add half of another mug. For precision, invest in a measuring jug for future recipes."

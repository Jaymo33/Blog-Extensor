faqQ1: "Is 0.25 cups of tomato sauce the same in the UK and USA?"
faqA1: "Yes, 0.25 cups equals 59 ml in both UK and US measurements. Cup sizes are standardized in cooking, though some regional recipes may use different tomato sauce thicknesses. Always check if your recipe specifies \"UK cups\" (rare) or standard cups."
faqQ2: "Can I use this conversion for other sauces like ketchup or BBQ?"
faqA2: "While 0.25 cups (59 ml) works for most thick sauces, ketchup and BBQ sauce are denser. For these, reduce to 50–55 ml per 0.25 cups to account for higher sugar content. Always adjust air fryer times slightly for stickier sauces."
faqQ3: "How do I measure 0.25 cups of tomato sauce without making a mess?"
faqA3: "Use a liquid measuring cup with a spout, or pour the sauce into a small jar first. For sticky sauces, lightly grease the measuring cup with oil—this helps the sauce slide out cleanly. A silicone spatula ensures you get every bit of the 59 ml."
faqQ4: "Why does my air fryer recipe turn soggy with 0.25 cups of tomato sauce?"
faqA4: "Air fryers vary in power. If 59 ml (0.25 cups) makes your dish soggy, reduce to 50 ml and layer sauce between drier ingredients (like breadcrumbs). Preheat the air fryer to 180°C for crispier results. Check food at the halfway point to adjust."

faqQ1: "Is 0.75 cups of evaporated milk the same in the UK and US?"
faqA1: "Yes, 0.75 cups of evaporated milk equals approximately 177 ml in both the UK and US. While cup sizes can vary slightly by country, this measurement remains consistent for evaporated milk due to its standard density."
faqQ2: "Can I use regular milk instead of evaporated milk in my air fryer recipe?"
faqA2: "You can substitute regular milk, but the texture and richness will differ. Evaporated milk is thicker and creamier, so if replacing, reduce the quantity slightly or add a thickening agent like cornflour for similar results."
faqQ3: "How do I measure 0.75 cups of evaporated milk without a measuring cup?"
faqA3: "Use a kitchen scale: 177 ml of evaporated milk weighs roughly 177 grams. Alternatively, a standard tablespoon holds about 15 ml, so 12 tablespoons will give you close to 0.75 cups (177 ml)."
faqQ4: "Why does my air fryer recipe call for evaporated milk instead of regular milk?"
faqA4: "Evaporated milk has less water content, which prevents sogginess and adds creaminess to air fryer dishes. It’s ideal for recipes needing a rich texture without excess moisture, like custards or casseroles."

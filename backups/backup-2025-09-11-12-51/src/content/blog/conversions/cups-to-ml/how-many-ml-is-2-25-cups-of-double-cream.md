faqQ1: "Is 2.25 cups of double cream the same in the UK and US?"
faqA1: "Yes, 2.25 cups of double cream equals 532.5 ml in both the UK and US. However, double cream in the UK has a higher fat content (around 48%) compared to heavy cream in the US (36-40%). For identical results, adjust the fat content or stick to UK double cream when possible."
faqQ2: "Can I use single cream instead of double cream for 2.25 cups?"
faqA2: "You can substitute single cream, but the texture and richness will differ. Single cream has a lower fat content, so your dish may be less creamy. If using 2.25 cups (532.5 ml) of single cream, consider thickening it with a bit of cornflour for a similar consistency."
faqQ3: "How do I measure 2.25 cups of double cream without a measuring jug?"
faqA3: "If you don’t have a measuring jug, use a standard metric scale. Double cream weighs roughly 240 grams per cup, so 2.25 cups would be about 540 grams. This method is less precise than ml measurements but works in a pinch."
faqQ4: "What’s the best way to clean my air fryer after using double cream?"
faqA4: "Double cream can leave residue, so wipe your air fryer basket with warm, soapy water immediately after use. For stubborn spots, use a non-abrasive sponge.

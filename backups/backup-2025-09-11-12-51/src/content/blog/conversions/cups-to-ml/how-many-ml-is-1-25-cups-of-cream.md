<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of cream can make or break a recipe, particularly in air fryer cooking where consistency is key.

Whether you're following a <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe</a> or experimenting, converting cups to ml helps avoid guesswork. This is especially useful for UK cooks using US-based recipes, where cup measurements differ slightly.</p>  

<h3>UK vs. US Cup Measurements for Cream</h3>  
<p>In the UK, 1 cup of cream is typically 237 ml, making 1.25 cups roughly 296 ml. In the US, 1 cup equals 236.6 ml, so 1.25 cups is about 295.7 ml.

<h2>How to Measure 1.25 Cups of Cream Without a Measuring Cup</h2>

faqA1: "Yes, 0.5 cups of buttermilk equals 118 ml in both UK and US measurements. While cup sizes can vary slightly by country, the metric conversion remains consistent for liquids like buttermilk."
faqQ2: "Can I substitute regular milk for buttermilk in air fryer recipes?"

faqA3: "If you don’t have a measuring jug, use a standard metric cup (250 ml) and fill it halfway for 0.5 cups (118 ml). Alternatively, use tablespoons—0.5 cups equals about 8 tablespoons."
faqQ4: "Why does my air fryer recipe require buttermilk?"
faqA4: "Buttermilk adds moisture, tenderness, and a slight tang to dishes. In air frying, it helps create crispy coatings (like fried chicken) or keeps baked goods soft. Its acidity also activates baking soda for better rise."

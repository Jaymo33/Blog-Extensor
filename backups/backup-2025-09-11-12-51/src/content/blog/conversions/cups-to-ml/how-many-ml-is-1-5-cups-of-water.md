faqQ1: "Is 1.5 cups of water the same in the US and UK?"
faqA1: "No, US and UK cup measurements differ slightly. A US cup is 240 ml, making 1.5 cups equal to 360 ml, while a UK cup is 250 ml, totalling 375 ml for 1.5 cups. Most modern recipes use the US standard, so 355 ml (1.5 US cups) is the widely accepted conversion."
faqQ2: "Can I use a mug to measure 1.5 cups of water?"
faqA2: "Yes, but accuracy may vary. A standard UK mug holds about 300 ml, so 1.5 cups (355 ml) would be slightly more than one full mug. For precise baking or air fryer recipes, a measuring cup or kitchen scale is recommended."
faqQ3: "Why does my air fryer recipe require exact water measurements?"
faqA3: "Air fryers cook food quickly with circulating hot air, so too much water can create excess steam, leading to soggy results. Too little water may dry out your dish. Precise measurements, like 355 ml for 1.5 cups, ensure perfect texture and consistency."
faqQ4: "How do I convert other cup measurements to ml for my air fryer?"
faqA4: "Use the standard conversion of 1 US cup = 240 ml. Multiply the number of cups by 240 to get the ml equivalent. For example, 2 cups = 480 ml. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> simplifies these calculations for all your cooking needs."

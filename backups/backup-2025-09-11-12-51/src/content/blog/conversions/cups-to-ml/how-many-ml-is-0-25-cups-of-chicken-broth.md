faqQ1: "Is 0.25 cups of chicken broth the same as 60 ml?"
faqA1: "No, 0.25 cups of chicken broth equals 59 ml, not 60 ml. While the difference is minor, precise measurements matter in air fryer cooking to avoid excess moisture. For best results, use a measuring jug with ml markings."
faqQ2: "Can I use stock instead of broth for the 0.25 cups (59 ml) measurement?"
faqA2: "Yes, chicken stock and broth are interchangeable in this conversion. Both have similar densities, so 0.25 cups of stock also equals 59 ml. Adjust seasoning accordingly, as stocks are often saltier."
faqQ3: "How do I measure 0.25 cups of chicken broth without a measuring cup?"
faqA3: "Use four level tablespoons (15 ml each) to reach 59 ml. Alternatively, a small kitchen scale set to grams can help—59 ml of broth weighs roughly 59 grams due to its water-like density."
faqQ4: "Why do some recipes list chicken broth in cups instead of ml?"
faqA4: "Cups are more common in US recipes, while ml are standard in the UK and Europe. Converting 0.25 cups to 59 ml ensures accuracy regardless of the recipe’s origin. Always double-check with a conversion tool if unsure."

<p>0.25 cups of chicken broth equals approximately 59 ml. This conversion is essential for precise cooking, especially when using an air fryer where measurements can impact texture and flavour. Whether you're making soups, sauces, or marinades, knowing the exact millilitre equivalent ensures your dish turns out perfectly every time.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on precise ingredient ratios to achieve crispy, evenly cooked results. Using too much or too little liquid, like chicken broth, can affect browning and moisture levels. For example, a recipe calling for 0.25 cups of chicken broth (59 ml) ensures the right balance for deglazing or adding flavour without making food soggy. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more handy measurement swaps.</p>  

<p>Many air fryer recipes, especially those for stews or braised dishes, require small amounts of broth. Measuring 0.25 cups (59 ml) accurately prevents over-pouring, which could lead to steaming instead of crisping. If you're prepping <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipes</a>, this precision ensures juicy meat with a golden finish.</p>  

<h2>Converting 0.25 Cups of Chicken Broth to ml</h2>  
<p>The standard conversion for 0.25 cups of chicken broth is 59 ml in both UK and US measurements. This consistency simplifies following international recipes. For context, 1 cup equals 237 ml, so dividing by four gives you the 59 ml equivalent for 0.25 cups. Always use a liquid measuring cup for accuracy, as dry cups can vary slightly.</p>  

<h3>Does Chicken Broth Density Affect the Conversion?</h3>  
<p>No—chicken broth’s density is close enough to water that the 59 ml measurement holds true. Unlike thicker liquids like cream or oil, broth’s consistency means volume conversions remain straightforward. This makes it easy to scale recipes up or down, whether you're cooking for one or meal prepping.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for 0.25 Cups (59 ml) of Chicken Broth</h2>  
<p>This small quantity is perfect for deglazing an air fryer basket after cooking meats, adding moisture to grains like quinoa, or thinning sauces. For example, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer mushroom risotto</a> uses precisely 59 ml of broth to maintain creaminess without excess liquid. It’s also ideal for marinating tofu or vegetables, infusing flavour without drowning them.</p>  

<h3>Tips for Measuring Without a Cup</h3>  
<p>No measuring cup? Use a tablespoon—59 ml is roughly 4 tablespoons. Alternatively, repurpose a standard medicine syringe (often marked in ml) for pinpoint accuracy. Just ensure your tools are clean, especially when prepping <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable dishes</a> where broth enhances natural flavours.</p>  

<h2>UK vs. US Cup Measurements for Chicken Broth</h2>  
<p>While 0.25 cups of chicken broth equals 59 ml in both regions, note that UK cups are slightly larger (284 ml vs. 237 ml per full cup). However, the difference is negligible for small amounts like 0.25 cups. For peace of mind, stick to ml measurements when using recipes from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> or other international sources.</p>

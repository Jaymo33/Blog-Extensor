faqQ1: "Is 0.5 cups of cream the same in the UK and US?"
faqA1: "Yes, 0.5 cups of cream is roughly the same in both the UK and US, equating to about 118 ml. However, the type of cream (single, double, or heavy) may vary slightly in fat content, but the volume measurement remains consistent."
faqQ2: "Can I use a kitchen scale to measure 0.5 cups of cream?"
faqA2: "Absolutely! A kitchen scale can measure 0.5 cups of cream by weight. Since cream has a density close to water, 118 ml (0.5 cups) weighs approximately 118 grams. This method is especially handy if you don't have measuring cups."
faqQ3: "How do I convert 0.5 cups of cream to ml for a larger recipe?"
faqA3: "To scale up, simply multiply the conversion. For example, 1 cup of cream equals 237 ml, so doubling 0.5 cups (118 ml) gives you 1 cup. This makes it easy to adjust recipes while keeping measurements precise."
faqQ4: "What’s the best way to measure cream for air fryer recipes?"
faqA4: "For air fryer recipes, use a liquid measuring cup for accuracy. Pour cream up to the 0.5 cup (118 ml) mark, or weigh it for precision. Room-temperature cream blends better into sauces and batters, ensuring even cooking in the air fryer."

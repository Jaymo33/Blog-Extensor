faqQ1: "Can I use light coconut milk instead of full-fat for 2.5 cups (591.47 ml)?"
faqA1: "Yes, but expect a slightly thinner consistency. Full-fat coconut milk adds creaminess to air fryer dishes like curries, while light versions work well in soups or marinades. Adjust cooking times if needed, as reduced fat may affect browning."
faqQ2: "How do I store leftover coconut milk after measuring 2.5 cups?"
faqA2: "Transfer unused coconut milk to an airtight container and refrigerate for up to 4 days. For longer storage, freeze it in portions—thaw overnight before using in your next air fryer recipe. Stir well after thawing, as separation is normal."
faqQ3: "Why does my air fryer recipe taste different with canned vs. carton coconut milk?"
faqA3: "Canned coconut milk is thicker and richer, ideal for creamy dishes. Carton versions are diluted for drinking, so they’ll yield a lighter texture. For 2.5 cups (591.47 ml), stick to canned unless the recipe specifies otherwise."
faqQ4: "Can I substitute coconut milk with another dairy-free alternative in air fryer recipes?"
faqA4: "Almond or oat milk can work, but they’re thinner and less creamy. For 2.5 cups (591.47 ml), you might need to reduce other liquids or add a thickener like cornflour. Coconut milk’s unique fat content is hard to replicate for crispy results."

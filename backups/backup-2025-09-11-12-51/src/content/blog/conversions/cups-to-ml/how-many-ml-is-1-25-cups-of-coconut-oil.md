faqQ1: "Does the type of coconut oil affect the ml measurement for 1.25 cups?"
faqA1: "No, the type of coconut oil (refined, unrefined, or virgin) doesn’t change the ml measurement for 1.25 cups. All varieties measure approximately 295.74 ml when melted. However, refined coconut oil has a neutral flavour, while unrefined adds a coconut taste to dishes."
faqQ2: "Can I use 1.25 cups of coconut oil in ml for all air fryer recipes?"
faqA2: "Yes, 1.25 cups (295.74 ml) of coconut oil works for most air fryer recipes, but always check the recipe’s requirements. Some dishes, like air-fried vegetables, may need less oil, while others, like coconut-battered fish, might require more for even coating."
faqQ3: "How do I convert 1.25 cups of coconut oil to grams?"
faqA3: "1.25 cups of coconut oil equals roughly 283 grams. Since coconut oil’s density is about 0.92 g/ml, the conversion varies slightly based on temperature. For precise baking, use a kitchen scale to weigh the oil after measuring it in ml."
faqQ4: "Is coconut oil better than other oils for air frying?"
faqA4: "Coconut oil is excellent for air frying due to its high smoke point (around 175°C for unrefined, 232°C for refined). It adds a subtle sweetness and crispiness to foods. However, for neutral flavours, you might prefer avocado or sunflower oil, depending on the recipe."

<h2>How to Measure Coconut Oil for Air Fryer Recipes</h2>
<p>Coconut oil can be tricky to measure because it changes consistency with temperature. At room temperature, it’s solid, but it melts into a liquid when heated. To measure 1.25 cups (295.74 ml) accurately, use a liquid measuring jug for melted oil or pack solid oil tightly into a dry measuring cup.</p>
<p>For recipes like air-fried coconut tofu from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/tofu>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, melting the oil first ensures even coating. If you’re using solid coconut oil, gently warm it until it’s soft enough to measure precisely. This method guarantees your dishes have the perfect balance of moisture and crispiness.</p>

<h3>UK vs. US Cup Measurements</h3>
<p>It’s worth noting that UK and US cup measurements differ slightly. A UK cup is 284 ml, while a US cup is 240 ml. However, most modern recipes, including those on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, use the US standard. Always check which measurement system your recipe follows to avoid discrepancies.</p>

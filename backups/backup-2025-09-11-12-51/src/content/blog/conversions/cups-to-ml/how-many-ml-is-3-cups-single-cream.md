faqQ3: "How do I measure 3.0 cups of single cream without a measuring jug?"

<h3>Storing Leftover Single Cream</h3>  
<p>If your recipe doesn’t use all 710 ml of single cream, store it properly to avoid waste. Keep it refrigerated and use within 2-3 days. For longer storage, consider freezing it in an airtight container. Thawed cream works well in cooked dishes, though it may separate slightly.</p>

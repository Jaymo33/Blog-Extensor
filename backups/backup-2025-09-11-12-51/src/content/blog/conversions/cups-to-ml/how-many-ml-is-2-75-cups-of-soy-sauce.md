faqA1: "Yes, 2.75 cups of soy sauce equals 650.62 ml in both the UK and US. While cup sizes can vary slightly by country, the metric conversion remains consistent. Always use a liquid measuring jug for accuracy in air fryer recipes."
faqQ2: "Can I use a kitchen scale to measure 2.75 cups of soy sauce?"
faqA2: "While a kitchen scale measures weight, not volume, you can approximate 2.75 cups (650.62 ml) of soy sauce by weight if you know its density. Soy sauce weighs roughly 1.04 grams per ml, so 650.62 ml would be about 676 grams. However, a liquid measuring jug is more reliable for precise results."
faqQ3: "How do I adjust a recipe if I only have a 250 ml measuring cup?"
faqA3: "To measure 2.75 cups (650.62 ml) of soy sauce with a 250 ml cup, fill it two full times (500 ml) and then add 150.62 ml using a smaller measuring spoon or jug. Alternatively, use three 250 ml cups for 750 ml and remove 99.38 ml to reach 650.62 ml."
faqQ4: "Does the type of soy sauce affect the ml measurement?"
faqA4: "The type of soy sauce (light or dark) doesn’t change the ml measurement for 2.75 cups (650.62 ml). However, thicker sauces like dark soy may cling to measuring tools, so scrape the jug thoroughly. For air fryer recipes, consistency matters more for coating than volume."

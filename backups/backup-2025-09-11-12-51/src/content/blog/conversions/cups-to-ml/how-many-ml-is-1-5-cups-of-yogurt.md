faqQ1: "Does the type of yogurt affect the ml measurement for 1.5 cups?"
faqA1: "No, the type of yogurt (Greek, natural, or flavoured) doesn’t change the volume. 1.5 cups will always equal 355 ml, regardless of thickness or fat content. However, thicker yogurts may require gentle stirring to measure accurately."
faqQ2: "Can I use a kitchen scale instead of measuring cups for yogurt?"
faqA2: "Yes, but you’ll need to convert grams to ml. Yogurt’s density varies, but roughly 1.5 cups (355 ml) weighs about 360–380 grams. For precision, stick to ml measurements unless your recipe specifies weight."
faqQ3: "Why do some recipes list yogurt in cups and others in ml?"
faqA3: "Recipes may use cups or ml depending on their origin. US recipes often favour cups, while UK and European ones use ml. Always convert to ensure accuracy—1.5 cups of yogurt is universally 355 ml."
faqQ4: "How do I adjust a recipe if I only have a 200g yogurt pot?"
faqA4: "A 200g pot is roughly 190–200 ml, so you’d need about 1.8 pots to make 1.5 cups (355 ml). For small adjustments, use tablespoons (15 ml each) to reach the desired amount without compromising the recipe."

faqQ1: "Is 0.25 cups of evaporated milk the same in the UK and US?"
faqA1: "Yes, 0.25 cups of evaporated milk equals 59 ml in both the UK and US. Cup measurements are standardized for volume, so the conversion remains consistent regardless of location. However, always double-check your measuring tools for accuracy."
faqQ2: "Can I use regular milk instead of evaporated milk in a recipe?"
faqA2: "You can substitute regular milk, but the texture and richness will differ. Evaporated milk is concentrated, so using 0.25 cups (59 ml) of regular milk may make your dish thinner. For best results, stick to evaporated milk or adjust other ingredients accordingly."
faqQ3: "How do I store leftover evaporated milk after measuring 0.25 cups?"
faqA3: "Transfer unused evaporated milk to an airtight container and refrigerate for up to five days. Ensure it’s sealed properly to maintain freshness. For longer storage, freeze it in measured portions like 0.25 cups (59 ml) for future use."
faqQ4: "Why is my air fryer recipe too dry when using 0.25 cups of evaporated milk?"
faqA4: "If your dish turns out dry, check if you measured the 0.25 cups (59 ml) accurately. Evaporated milk’s thickness means even slight over-measuring can affect moisture. Also, ensure your air fryer isn’t running too hot, which can evaporate liquids faster."

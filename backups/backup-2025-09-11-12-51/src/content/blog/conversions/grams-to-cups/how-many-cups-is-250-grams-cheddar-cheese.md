faqQ1: "Does 250 grams of cheddar cheese equal the same in cups for all cheese types?"
faqA1: "No, different cheeses have varying densities. Hard cheeses like cheddar measure differently than softer varieties like mozzarella. For cheddar, 250 grams is roughly 2.5 cups when grated, but always check specific conversions for other cheeses."
faqQ2: "Can I use pre-shredded cheese instead of grating my own for 250 grams?"
faqA2: "Yes, but pre-shredded cheese often contains anti-caking agents, which can affect melting. For best results in air fryer recipes, freshly grated cheddar is recommended. If using pre-shredded, lightly pack it to measure 250 grams accurately."

faqA3: "250 grams of cheddar cheese is approximately 8.8 ounces. This conversion is useful for recipes using imperial measurements. Always double-check if precision is critical for baking or specific dishes."
faqQ4: "Why does my air fryer recipe with 250 grams of cheddar cheese turn out greasy?"

faqQ1: "Is 100 grams of icing sugar the same as 1 cup?"
faqA1: "No, 100 grams of icing sugar is not equal to 1 cup. In the UK, it’s roughly 0.8 cups, and in the US, it’s about 0.75 cups. Icing sugar is lighter and fluffier than granulated sugar, so it takes up more volume for the same weight."
faqQ2: "Can I use a regular cup to measure 100 grams of icing sugar?"
faqA2: "While you can use a measuring cup, a kitchen scale is far more accurate. If using a cup, spoon the sugar in lightly and level it off—never pack it down. For air fryer baking, precision ensures even cooking and perfect texture."
faqQ3: "Does the type of icing sugar affect the conversion?"
faqA3: "Yes, finely ground icing sugar packs differently than coarser varieties. Always check if your recipe specifies a particular type. For air fryer recipes, consistency matters, so stick to the recommended sugar texture."
faqQ4: "How do I convert other sugar amounts from grams to cups?"
faqA4: "Use a conversion chart or kitchen scale for accuracy. Granulated sugar, brown sugar, and icing sugar all have different weights per cup. For air fryer baking, refer to guides like our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a> for reliable measurements."

<p>100 grams of icing sugar is roughly equivalent to 0.8 cups in the UK or 0.75 cups in the US. This conversion is essential for baking, especially when using an air fryer for desserts like cakes or cookies. Whether you're following a recipe from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> or adjusting measurements, knowing how to convert grams to cups ensures perfect results every time.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurement Matters</h2>  
<p>Baking is a science, and precise measurements are crucial for the right texture and taste. Too much or too little icing sugar can affect the consistency of frostings, glazes, or baked goods. For air fryer recipes, where space and heat distribution matter, accurate measurements prevent undercooked or overly dense results. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more handy baking tips.</p>  

<p>Icing sugar, also known as powdered sugar, is finer than granulated sugar, which means it packs differently in a cup. This is why weight measurements (grams) are often more reliable than volume (cups). If you're using an air fryer for desserts like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>cakes</a>, precision ensures even cooking and perfect sweetness.</p>  

<h3>UK vs. US Cup Measurements</h3>  
<p>In the UK, 100 grams of icing sugar equals about 0.8 cups, while in the US, it’s closer to 0.75 cups. This difference arises because UK cups are slightly larger (284ml) compared to US cups (240ml). Always check where your recipe originates to avoid measurement mishaps. For air fryer baking, consistency is key—whether you're making cookies or dusting <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>desserts</a>.</p>  

<h2>How to Measure Icing Sugar Correctly</h2>  
<p>The best way to measure 100 grams of icing sugar is by using a kitchen scale. If you don’t have one, lightly spoon the sugar into a measuring cup and level it off with a knife—never pack it down. This method prevents over-measuring, which can make frostings too thick or cakes overly sweet. For air fryer recipes, precise measurements ensure even browning and perfect texture.</p>

<h3>Common Mistakes to Avoid</h3>  
<p>One of the biggest mistakes is scooping icing sugar directly from the bag with a cup, which compacts it and leads to excess. Another is confusing granulated sugar conversions with icing sugar—they weigh differently per cup. Always double-check your recipe’s measurement system (metric or imperial) to avoid errors, especially when baking in an air fryer.</p>

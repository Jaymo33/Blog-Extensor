faqQ1: "Is 125 grams of yogurt the same as ½ cup?"
faqA1: "Yes, 125 grams of yogurt equals approximately ½ cup in both US and UK measurements. This applies to most yogurt types, though thicker varieties like Greek yogurt may need light stirring before measuring for accuracy."
faqQ2: "Can I use 125 grams of yogurt in air fryer baking?"
faqA2: "Absolutely! 125 grams (½ cup) of yogurt works well in air fryer cakes, muffins, and breads. It adds moisture and helps activate leavening agents. For best results, follow recipes that specify yogurt measurements, like those on <a href=\"https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk\">airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>."
faqQ3: "How do I measure 125 grams of yogurt without a scale?"
faqA3: "Use a liquid measuring cup: 125 grams is roughly ½ cup. Spoon the yogurt in without packing it down, then level the top with a knife. For smaller amounts, 8 tablespoons equal 125 grams. Stirring the yogurt first ensures an even measurement."
faqQ4: "Does yogurt type affect the 125-gram-to-cups conversion?"
faqA4: "Slightly. Thicker yogurts (like Greek) are denser, so 125 grams may look less than ½ cup. Stirring loosens it for accurate measuring. For standard or flavored yogurt, 125 grams reliably equals ½ cup. Always check recipe notes for specific types."

<p>125 grams of yogurt is approximately 0.5 cups (½ cup) in standard US and UK measurements. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise ingredient quantities ensure perfect results. Whether you’re whipping up a cake, marinade, or dip, knowing how to convert grams to cups makes cooking effortless.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Yogurt Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of yogurt in air fryer recipes ensures texture and moisture balance. Too much yogurt can make batters runny, while too little may dry out dishes like cakes or marinades. For example, our <a href="https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes">air fryer yogurt cake</a> relies on precise measurements for a fluffy, moist result. Always measure yogurt correctly to avoid kitchen mishaps.</p>  

<p>Different yogurt types (Greek, natural, or flavored) have slight density variations, but 125 grams generally equals ½ cup. If you’re using thicker Greek yogurt, fluff it lightly with a spoon before measuring.

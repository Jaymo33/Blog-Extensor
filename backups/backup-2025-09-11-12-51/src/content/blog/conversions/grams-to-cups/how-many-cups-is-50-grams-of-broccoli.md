faqQ1: "Is 50 grams of broccoli the same as 50ml?"
faqA1: "No, grams measure weight, while millilitres (ml) measure volume. For broccoli, 50 grams equals roughly 0.5 cups (120ml), but this can vary based on how it’s chopped. Always use a scale for accuracy in air fryer recipes."
faqQ2: "How many florets are in 50 grams of broccoli?"
faqA2: "Approximately 5–6 medium florets make up 50 grams of broccoli. For precise measurements, especially in recipes like air-fried broccoli bites, weighing is best. Floret size can vary, so cup measurements are more consistent."
faqQ3: "Can I use frozen broccoli instead of fresh for 50 grams?"
faqA3: "Yes, but frozen broccoli may need patting dry to prevent sogginess. The cup measurement stays roughly the same, but cooking times might adjust slightly. For crisper results, fresh broccoli is ideal."
faqQ4: "How do I convert 50 grams of broccoli to ounces?"
faqA4: "50 grams of broccoli equals about 1.76 ounces. This conversion is useful for recipes using imperial measurements. For air fryer cooking, stick to grams or cups for consistent results."

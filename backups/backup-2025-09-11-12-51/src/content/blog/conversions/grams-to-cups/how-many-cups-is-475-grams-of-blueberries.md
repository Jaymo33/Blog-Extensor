faqQ1: "Does 475 grams of blueberries equal the same in cups for both fresh and frozen?"
faqA1: "Fresh and frozen blueberries can differ slightly in cup measurements due to ice crystal formation in frozen berries. Generally, 475 grams of fresh blueberries equals about 3.5 cups, while frozen may measure closer to 3.25 cups if compacted. For air frying, slight variations won’t drastically affect most recipes."
faqQ2: "Can I use 475 grams of blueberries in savoury air fryer dishes?"
faqA2: "Absolutely! Blueberries add a sweet-tart balance to savoury dishes. Try them in glazes for chicken or mixed into grain bowls. Since air fryers intensify flavours, 475 grams can go a long way—just adjust cooking times to prevent overcaramelisation."
faqQ3: "How should I store leftover blueberries after measuring 475 grams?"
faqA3: "Store unused blueberries in an airtight container in the fridge for up to a week, or freeze them for longer shelf life. If freezing, spread them on a tray first to prevent clumping, then transfer to bags. They’ll be ready for future air fryer recipes."
faqQ4: "Why does my air fryer recipe with 475 grams of blueberries turn out soggy?"
faqA4: "Excess moisture from blueberries can lead to sogginess. To prevent this, toss the berries in a bit of flour or cornstarch before adding them to batters. Also, avoid overcrowding the air fryer basket to ensure proper airflow and even crisping."

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Frying</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on even heat distribution, so ingredient quantities can affect cooking times and textures. Too many blueberries in a recipe might lead to excess moisture, while too few could leave dishes dry. Measuring 475 grams of blueberries correctly ensures your air-fried desserts or snacks turn out perfectly.

<p>Blueberries are a versatile ingredient, whether fresh or frozen. When converting 475 grams of blueberries to cups, note that frozen berries may settle differently. For best results, lightly spoon them into a measuring cup without packing tightly. This method keeps measurements consistent across recipes, from crisps to compotes.</p>  

<h3>How Berry Size Affects Cup Measurements</h3>  
<p>Larger blueberries take up more space, meaning 475 grams might fill fewer cups than smaller berries. If precision is key, consider weighing your berries instead of relying solely on cup measurements. For air fryer recipes like blueberry crumbles, this extra attention ensures even cooking and perfect texture every time.</p>  

<h2>Converting 475 Grams of Blueberries for Baking</h2>  
<p>Baking with blueberries in an air fryer? Whether you're making muffins or cakes, 475 grams translates to about 3.5 cups.

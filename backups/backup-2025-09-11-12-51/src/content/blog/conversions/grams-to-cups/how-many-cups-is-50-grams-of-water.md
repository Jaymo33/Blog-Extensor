faqQ1: "Is 50 grams of water the same as 50 ml?"
faqA1: "Yes, 50 grams of water equals exactly 50 millilitres. This is because water has a density of 1 g/ml, making the conversion straightforward. Use a liquid measuring cup for accuracy in air fryer recipes."
faqQ2: "How do I measure 50 grams of water without a scale?"
faqA2: "If you don’t have a scale, use a measuring cup marked in millilitres. Since 50 grams of water is 50 ml, fill the cup to that line. Alternatively, 0.21 cups (just under 1/4 cup) works for imperial measurements."
faqQ3: "Does the type of cup affect the 50g-to-cups conversion?"
faqA3: "Yes, US and UK cups differ slightly. A US cup is 240 ml, while a UK cup is 284 ml. For 50 grams of water, the difference is negligible (0.21 cups in both), but it’s important for larger quantities."
faqQ4: "Can I use 50 grams of water for air fryer cleaning?"
faqA4: "Absolutely! Mix 50 grams of water with vinegar or baking soda for a natural air fryer cleaner. This small amount is perfect for loosening grease without over-saturating the appliance. Check our cleaning guide for details."

Whether you're baking, steaming, or adjusting moisture levels, knowing how to convert grams to cups ensures consistency.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Water Measurements Matter in Air Fryers</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on precise ingredient ratios to achieve crispy, evenly cooked results. Too much water can lead to soggy food, while too little may cause dryness.

<p>Many UK and US recipes use cups, but scales measure grams. Converting 50 grams of water to cups (0.21 cups) bridges this gap. This is especially useful for recipes like air fryer soups or sauces, where liquid balance is critical.

<h2>How to Measure 50 Grams of Water Without Scales</h2>

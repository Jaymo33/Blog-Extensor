faqA1: "Yes, you can cook 325 grams of frozen chicken breast in the air fryer, but it will take longer—about 20-25 minutes at 180°C. Ensure it reaches an internal temperature of 75°C for safety. For best results, thaw it first for even cooking."

This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes, where precise measurements ensure even cooking and perfect results. Whether you're meal prepping or following a specific dish, knowing how to convert grams to cups makes cooking simpler.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter for Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of chicken breast ensures your air fryer cooks evenly. Too much can lead to overcrowding, while too little might dry out the meat. For 325 grams of chicken breast, 2.5 cups is a reliable measurement for diced or shredded pieces. This accuracy is especially important for recipes like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer chicken tenders</a> or stir-fries.</p>

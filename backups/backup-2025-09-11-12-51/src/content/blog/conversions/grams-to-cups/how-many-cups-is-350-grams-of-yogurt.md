faqQ1: "Is 350 grams of yogurt the same as 350ml?"
faqA1: "No, grams measure weight, while millilitres measure volume. The density of yogurt means 350 grams isn’t exactly 350ml—thicker yogurts like Greek will have less volume for the same weight."
faqQ2: "Can I use US cups for UK air fryer recipes?"
faqA2: "Yes, but adjust slightly. Since US cups are smaller, 350 grams of yogurt equals 1.5 US cups instead of 1.4 UK cups. Check your recipe’s origin to avoid errors."
faqQ3: "How do I convert 350g yogurt to cups for baking?"
faqA3: "Use 1.4 UK cups or 1.5 US cups for 350 grams of yogurt. For baking, weigh it if possible, as cup measurements can vary with yogurt thickness."
faqQ4: "Does yogurt type affect the cup conversion?"
faqA4: "Slightly. Thicker yogurts (like Greek) may need loosening to measure accurately. However, 350 grams generally equals 1.4-1.5 cups regardless of type."

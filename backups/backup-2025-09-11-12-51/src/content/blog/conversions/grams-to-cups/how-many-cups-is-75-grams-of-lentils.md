faqQ1: "Can I use 75 grams of lentils for air fryer falafel?"
faqA1: "Absolutely! 75 grams of lentils works well for small-batch falafel. Soak them first, blend with herbs and spices, then air fry until crispy. This quantity makes about 6-8 falafel balls, perfect for a snack or light meal."
faqQ2: "Does the type of lentil affect the cup measurement for 75 grams?"

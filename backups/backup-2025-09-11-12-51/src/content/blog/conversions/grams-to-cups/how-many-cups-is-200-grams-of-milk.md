faqQ1: "Is 200 grams of milk the same as 200ml?"
faqA1: "No, 200 grams of milk is not the same as 200ml. Milk’s density means 200 grams equals roughly 194ml in the UK and 193ml in the US. Weight and volume measurements differ, so always check your recipe requirements."
faqQ2: "Can I use plant-based milk instead of dairy milk for 200 grams?"
faqA2: "Yes, most plant-based milks (like almond or oat) can substitute dairy milk in a 1:1 ratio by weight. However, slight texture differences may occur, so adjust other liquids if needed for baking."
faqQ3: "How do I measure 200 grams of milk without a scale?"
faqA3: "Use a measuring cup: 200 grams is just under 1 cup (0.85 UK cups or 0.83 US cups). Alternatively, use 13-14 tablespoons for smaller adjustments in recipes."
faqQ4: "Does the fat content of milk affect the 200-gram measurement?"
faqA4: "Whole, semi-skimmed, and skimmed milk have nearly identical densities, so 200 grams converts similarly. However, cream or condensed milk would require different measurements due to higher fat or sugar content."

<p>200 grams of milk is roughly 0.85 cups in the UK and 0.83 cups in the US. This conversion is essential for baking and cooking, especially when using an air fryer for recipes that require precise measurements. Whether you're whipping up a cake or a creamy sauce, knowing how to convert grams to cups ensures your dish turns out perfectly every time.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Getting the right amount of milk is crucial for recipes, particularly in baking where precision affects texture and rise. Too much or too little milk can throw off the balance of your batter or dough. For air fryer recipes, like those on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, accurate measurements ensure even cooking and perfect results. Whether you're making pancakes or a custard, 200 grams of milk should be measured carefully.</p>  

<p>Different types of milk (whole, skim, or plant-based) have slight variations in density, but the standard conversion remains reliable for most cooking needs. If you're using a recipe from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert recipes</a>, sticking to the correct measurement guarantees the right consistency.</p>  

<h3>UK vs. US Cup Measurements</h3>  
<p>In the UK, a standard cup holds 240ml, while in the US, it's slightly less at 237ml. This small difference means 200 grams of milk converts to about 0.85 cups in the UK and 0.83 cups in the US. For most home cooking, this variance won’t make a huge difference, but for precision baking, it’s worth noting.</p>  

<h2>How to Measure 200 Grams of Milk Without Scales</h2>  
<p>If you don’t have a kitchen scale, you can still measure 200 grams of milk using a measuring cup. Fill the cup just below the 1-cup line for US measurements or slightly above the ¾-cup mark for UK measurements.

<p>Another method is to use tablespoons—200 grams of milk is approximately 13-14 tablespoons. This is handy for smaller quantities or if you're adjusting a recipe on the fly. For air fryer-friendly recipes, like those in our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/breakfast>breakfast category</a>, these small adjustments can make a big difference.</p>  

<h3>Common Recipes Using 200 Grams of Milk</h3>

<h2>Tips for Measuring Milk in an Air Fryer Recipe</h2>  
<p>Always use room-temperature milk for accurate measuring, as cold milk can slightly alter volume. When preparing air fryer dishes, like those in our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>cake recipes</a>, consistency is key. Stir the milk before measuring to ensure an even distribution of fat, especially if using whole milk.</p>  

<p>If you’re scaling a recipe up or down, remember that 200 grams of milk is just under a cup. For cleaning tips after cooking, check out our guide on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner</a> to keep your appliance in top shape.</p>  

<h3>Converting Other Dairy Products</h3>  
<p>While this guide focuses on milk, other dairy like cream or buttermilk may have different weights per cup. Always check specific conversions if substituting ingredients in an air fryer recipe.</p>

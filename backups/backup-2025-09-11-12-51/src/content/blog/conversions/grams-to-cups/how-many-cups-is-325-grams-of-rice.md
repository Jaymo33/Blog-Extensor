faqQ1: "Does the type of rice affect how many cups 325 grams equals?"
faqA1: "Yes, the type of rice makes a difference. Long-grain rice like basmati is less dense, so 325 grams will take up slightly more volume than short-grain rice. Always consider the variety when converting grams to cups for air fryer recipes."
faqQ2: "Can I use the same conversion for cooked rice?"
faqA2: "No, cooked rice has a different density due to absorbed water. 325 grams of cooked rice will take up more cups than uncooked. For accurate measurements, always weigh rice before cooking when following air fryer recipes."
faqQ3: "How do I measure 325 grams of rice without a scale?"
faqA3: "If you don't have a scale, use the spoon-and-level method. Gently spoon rice into a measuring cup without packing it down, then level off the top. For 325 grams, you'll need about 1.5 US cups or 1.6 UK cups of uncooked rice."
faqQ4: "Why is measuring rice important for air fryer cooking?"
faqA4: "Air fryers rely on precise measurements for even cooking. Too much rice can block airflow, leading to uneven results, while too little may dry out. Converting 325 grams to cups correctly ensures perfect texture every time."

<p>325 grams of rice equals approximately 1.6 cups in the UK or 1.5 cups in the US. This conversion is essential for air fryer cooking, where precise measurements can make or break a recipe. Whether you're making fried rice, rice pudding, or a grain bowl, knowing how to convert grams to cups ensures perfect results every time.</p>

<h2>Understanding Rice Measurements</h2>
<p>Rice measurements can vary depending on the type of rice and where you live. In the UK, 1 cup of rice typically holds 200 grams, while in the US, it's around 220 grams. This means 325 grams of rice translates to roughly 1.6 cups in the UK and 1.5 cups in the US. For air fryer recipes, accuracy is key, so using a kitchen scale is always recommended.</p>
<p>If you don't have a scale, fluffing the rice before measuring can help. Packed rice will yield more grams per cup, leading to inaccurate results. For more conversion tips, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>

<h2>Types of Rice and Their Densities</h2>
<p>Not all rice is created equal. Long-grain rice like basmati or jasmine is less dense than short-grain varieties like sushi rice. This means 325 grams of basmati rice will take up slightly more volume than 325 grams of sticky rice. When converting grams to cups, always consider the type of rice you're using.</p>
<p>For air fryer recipes, basmati and jasmine rice work exceptionally well due to their fluffy texture. If you're cooking a <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken and rice dish</a>, basmati is a great choice. For desserts or sushi, short-grain might be better.</p>

<h3>Why Measurement Matters in Air Fryer Cooking</h3>
<p>Air fryers cook food quickly and evenly, but only if the ingredients are measured correctly. Too much rice can lead to uneven cooking, while too little might dry out. That's why converting 325 grams of rice to cups accurately is so important. It ensures your rice cooks perfectly every time.</p>

<h2>Converting Grams to Cups for Other Ingredients</h2>
<p>While we've focused on rice, many air fryer recipes require other ingredients measured in grams or cups. Flour, sugar, and even <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetables</a> often need converting. A general rule is that 1 cup of all-purpose flour weighs around 120 grams, while 1 cup of granulated sugar is about 200 grams.</p>

<h3>Tips for Perfect Air Fryer Rice</h3>
<p>To get the best results when cooking rice in your air fryer, always rinse it first to remove excess starch. Use the correct water-to-rice ratio, usually 1:1.5 for white rice. Preheat your air fryer for a few minutes before adding the rice to ensure even cooking. And don't forget to stir halfway through!</p>

faqQ1: "Is 400 grams of olive oil the same in UK and US cups?"
faqA1: "Yes, 400 grams of olive oil equals roughly 1.8 cups in both UK and US measurements. While UK and US cups are slightly different (UK cups are 284ml vs. US 240ml), the difference is negligible for olive oil due to its density."
faqQ2: "Can I use 400 grams of olive oil for air fryer frying?"
faqA2: "Yes, 400 grams (1.8 cups) of olive oil works well for light frying in an air fryer. However, most air fryers require only a light coating of oil—about 1-2 tablespoons—for crisping. Using too much can cause smoke or uneven cooking."
faqQ3: "How do I store leftover olive oil after measuring 400 grams?"
faqA3: "Store leftover olive oil in a cool, dark place in an airtight container. Exposure to light and air can degrade its quality. If you’ve used it for cooking, avoid reusing it more than once to maintain flavour and health benefits."
faqQ4: "What’s the best substitute for olive oil in air fryer recipes?"
faqA4: "Avocado oil or coconut oil are great substitutes for olive oil in air fryer recipes. Both have high smoke points and neutral flavours. Use the same 400-gram (1.8-cup) measurement for seamless swaps in baking or frying."

<p>400 grams of olive oil is roughly equivalent to 1.8 cups (or 1 and 4/5 cups). This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes, where precise measurements can make or break a dish. Whether you’re baking, frying, or drizzling, knowing how many cups 400 grams of olive oil equals ensures consistency in your cooking. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we help simplify these conversions so you can focus on creating delicious meals.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Olive Oil Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of olive oil in your air fryer ensures even cooking and prevents dryness or sogginess. Too little oil, and your food may stick or lack crispiness; too much, and it can become greasy. For recipes like roasted vegetables or crispy chicken, 400 grams of olive oil (about 1.8 cups) is often ideal. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for other common ingredient swaps.</p>  

<p>Olive oil is a staple in Mediterranean and healthy cooking, and its density affects volume-to-weight conversions. Unlike water, olive oil has a different density, meaning 400 grams won’t equal the same volume in cups. This is why weighing ingredients, especially oils, is more precise than relying solely on cup measurements.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure 400 Grams of Olive Oil Without a Scale</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a kitchen scale, you can still measure 400 grams of olive oil using standard cups. One cup of olive oil weighs approximately 224 grams, so 400 grams is just under 2 cups. For greater accuracy, use a liquid measuring cup with clear markings. This method works well for air fryer recipes like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>roasted vegetables</a> or homemade fries.</p>  

<h2>Converting 400 Grams of Olive Oil for Different Recipes</h2>  
<p>Whether you’re baking or frying, 400 grams of olive oil (1.8 cups) can be used in various ways. For air fryer cakes or muffins, this amount ensures moistness without overpowering the flavour. In savoury dishes, like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>air-fried chicken</a>, it helps achieve a golden, crispy exterior. Always adjust based on your recipe’s requirements.</p>  

<p>Different brands of olive oil may have slight variations in density, so it’s best to stick to one type for consistency. Extra virgin olive oil, for example, is thicker than light olive oil, which can slightly alter the volume. If you’re unsure, refer to our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a> for tested measurements.</p>  

<h3>Common Mistakes When Measuring Olive Oil</h3>  
<p>One mistake people make is using dry measuring cups for liquids, which can lead to inaccuracies. Always use a liquid measuring cup for oils like olive oil. Another error is eyeballing the amount—400 grams of olive oil should be measured precisely to avoid recipe mishaps.

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on even cooking, and incorrect measurements can lead to uneven textures or undercooked food. Mozzarella cheese, in particular, melts quickly, so using the right amount ensures your dishes are neither too dry nor overly greasy. A slight variation in cheese quantity can affect the crispiness of your air-fried mozzarella sticks or the stretchiness of your homemade pizza.

<p>British and American cup measurements can differ slightly, so it’s best to use a kitchen scale for precision. If you don’t have one, the 1.5-cup approximation for 275 grams of mozzarella cheese works well for most recipes.

<h3>How to Measure Mozzarella Cheese Without a Scale</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a scale, lightly pack shredded mozzarella into a measuring cup without pressing down too hard. Overpacking can lead to more cheese than needed, altering the recipe’s balance. For block mozzarella, shred it first for consistent cup measurements. This method ensures your air fryer dishes turn out just right.</p>

<h3>Storing Leftover Mozzarella Cheese</h3>

faqQ1: "Is 300 grams of icing sugar the same in UK and US cups?"
faqA1: "No, there's a slight difference. In the UK, 300 grams of icing sugar equals about 2.4 cups, while in the US, it's approximately 2.5 cups. This is because UK and US cup sizes vary slightly (250ml vs. 240ml). Always check which measurement system your recipe uses."

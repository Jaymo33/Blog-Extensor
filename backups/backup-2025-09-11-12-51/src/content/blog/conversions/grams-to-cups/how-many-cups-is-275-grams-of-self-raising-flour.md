faqQ1: "Is 275 grams of self-raising flour the same as plain flour in cups?"
faqA1: "No, 275 grams of self-raising flour and plain flour will measure slightly differently in cups due to the added baking powder in self-raising flour. Self-raising flour is lighter, so 275 grams will yield slightly more cups compared to plain flour. Always check your recipe for the correct type of flour."
faqQ2: "Can I use a regular measuring cup for 275 grams of self-raising flour?"
faqA2: "Yes, but for accuracy, it’s best to use a kitchen scale. If you don’t have one, spoon the flour into the cup and level it off. Avoid scooping directly from the bag, as this can compact the flour and lead to incorrect measurements. For air fryer baking, precision is key."
faqQ3: "How does 275 grams of self-raising flour convert to ounces?"
faqA3: "275 grams of self-raising flour is approximately 9.7 ounces. This conversion is useful if your recipe uses imperial measurements. Remember, air fryer recipes often require precise measurements, so a scale is your best bet for consistent results."
faqQ4: "Why does my air fryer cake with 275 grams of self-raising flour turn out dense?"
faqA4: "Dense cakes can result from overmixing the batter or using old self-raising flour where the baking powder has lost its potency. Ensure your flour is fresh and mix just until combined. Also, check your air fryer’s temperature—too high or too low can affect the rise."

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter</h2>
<p>Baking is a science, and even small deviations in measurements can affect the outcome. Self-raising flour, which contains baking powder, requires precise measurements to ensure your baked goods rise properly. Too much or too little flour can lead to dense or crumbly results. This is especially important in air fryer baking, where the cooking environment differs from a conventional oven. For foolproof recipes, always measure your ingredients carefully.</p>

Remember, 275 grams of self-raising flour is roughly 2.2 cups in the UK, but always double-check if your recipe specifies a different standard.</p>

<h3>UK vs. US Cup Measurements</h3>
<p>The difference between UK and US cup measurements can be confusing. In the UK, a standard cup holds 250ml, while in the US, it’s 240ml.

<p>275 grams of butter is roughly equivalent to 1.2 cups in the UK or 1.16 cups in the US. Whether you're baking a cake or preparing a savoury dish in your air fryer, accurate measurements are key to perfect results. This guide will help you convert 275 grams of butter to cups effortlessly, ensuring your recipes turn out just right every time.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Butter Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Getting the right amount of butter is crucial, especially in air fryer recipes where precision affects texture and flavour. Too much butter can make dishes greasy, while too little may leave them dry. For example, if you're making air fryer cookies from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>our recipe collection</a>, 275 grams of butter ensures the perfect balance of crispiness and chewiness.</p>  

<p>Butter measurements can vary slightly between the UK and US due to differences in cup sizes. In the UK, a standard cup holds 250ml, while in the US, it's 240ml. This means 275 grams of butter equals 1.2 UK cups or 1.16 US cups. Always check your recipe's origin to avoid confusion.</p>  

<h2>How to Measure 275 Grams of Butter Without Scales</h2>  
<p>If you don’t have a kitchen scale, you can still measure 275 grams of butter using the markings on the wrapper. Most butter blocks come with measurements printed on the packaging, making it easy to cut the right amount. For 275 grams, you’d need roughly one and a quarter standard UK blocks (each block is usually 250g).</p>  

<p>Another method is using tablespoons. One tablespoon of butter weighs about 14 grams, so 275 grams would be approximately 19.6 tablespoons. While this isn’t as precise as weighing, it’s a handy workaround for quick conversions.

<h3>UK vs US Butter Measurements</h3>  
<p>In the UK, butter is often sold in 250g blocks, while in the US, it’s typically packaged in 1-pound (454g) sticks. This means 275 grams of butter is slightly more than one UK block but just over half a US stick. Knowing these differences helps when following international recipes, especially for air fryer baking.</p>  

<h2>Common Recipes Using 275 Grams of Butter</h2>  
<p>275 grams of butter is a common measurement in many air fryer recipes, from cakes to savoury dishes. For instance, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>air fryer cake recipes</a> often call for this amount to achieve a rich, moist texture. It’s also ideal for buttery pastry crusts or flaky biscuits.</p>  

<p>If you’re reheating or cooking frozen foods in the air fryer, a small amount of melted butter (measured from 275g) can enhance flavour. For example, tossing frozen shrimp in garlic butter made from 275 grams of butter elevates the dish. Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/frozen-foods>frozen foods section</a> for inspiration.</p>  

<h3>Storing Leftover Butter</h3>  
<p>If you’ve measured 275 grams of butter but only used part of it, proper storage is key. Wrap the remaining butter tightly in foil or cling film and refrigerate. For longer storage, freeze it in an airtight container. Properly stored butter retains its quality for weeks, ready for your next air fryer creation.</p>

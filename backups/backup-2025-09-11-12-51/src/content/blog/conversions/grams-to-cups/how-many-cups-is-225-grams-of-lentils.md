faqQ1: "Does the type of lentil affect the cup measurement for 225 grams?"
faqA1: "Yes, slightly. Red lentils are smaller and less dense than green or brown lentils, so 225 grams may fill slightly more than 1.1 cups. For precise results, weigh them or fluff the lentils before measuring."
faqQ2: "Can I use 225 grams of lentils straight from dry in the air fryer?"
faqA2: "No, dry lentils need soaking or pre-cooking before air frying. Soak for 2 hours or boil for 15 minutes, then drain and pat dry. Toss with oil and seasonings before air frying for best results."
faqQ3: "How many servings does 225 grams of lentils make?"
faqA3: "Once cooked, 225 grams of lentils yields about 2.5 cups, serving 2–3 people as a main or 4–5 as a side. It’s ideal for meal prep—store cooked lentils for up to 4 days."
faqQ4: "Why is my air-fried lentil dish turning out dry?"
faqA4: "Overcooking or insufficient oil can dry out lentils. For 225 grams, use 1–2 tbsp oil and check at the 8-minute mark. Adding a splash of water or sauce halfway through helps retain moisture."

<h3>UK vs. US Cup Measurements</h3>  
<p>While the difference between UK and US cups is minimal, it’s worth noting that 225 grams of lentils equals 1.1 cups in both systems.

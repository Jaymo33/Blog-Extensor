faqQ2: "How do I measure 50 grams of plain flour without scales?"
faqA2: "Fluff the flour with a fork, then spoon it lightly into a measuring cup. Level off the excess with a knife for the closest approximation. For consistent results in air frying, investing in a kitchen scale is best."
faqQ3: "Why does my air fryer recipe fail with cup measurements?"
faqA3: "Air fryers require precise ratios due to their rapid cooking. Cup measurements can vary, leading to dry or dense results. Converting 50 grams of plain flour to weight ensures reliability. Check our conversion chart for help."
faqQ4: "Can I use self-raising flour instead of plain flour for 50g conversions?"

<h2>Why Accurate Flour Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Baking is a science, and even small measurement errors can lead to dense cakes or crumbly cookies. When using an air fryer, heat distribution is intense, so precise ratios of dry ingredients like plain flour are crucial.

faqA1: "Yes, 75 grams of rolled oats is approximately ¾ cup when measured correctly. This conversion works for most standard rolled oats, though slight variations may occur depending on the brand or packing method."
faqQ2: "Can I use quick oats instead of rolled oats for this measurement?"

<h3>Adjusting Recipes When You Only Have Cups or Grams</h3>  
<p>If a recipe lists cups but you prefer weighing ingredients, remember that 75 grams of rolled oats is roughly ¾ cup. For larger batches, scale up proportionally—150 grams would be 1.5 cups, and so on. Consistency is key, especially in baking, so always measure carefully. Whether you’re in the UK or USA, this conversion remains reliable for most standard rolled oats.</p>

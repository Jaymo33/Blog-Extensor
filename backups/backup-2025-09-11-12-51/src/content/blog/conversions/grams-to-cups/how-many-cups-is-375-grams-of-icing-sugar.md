faqQ1: "Is 375 grams of icing sugar the same in UK and US cups?"
faqA1: "No, there's a slight difference. In the UK, 375 grams of icing sugar equals about 3 cups (using a 250ml cup). In the US, it's roughly 3.5 cups (using a 240ml cup). Always check which measurement system your recipe uses."
faqQ2: "Can I use granulated sugar instead of icing sugar for recipes calling for 375 grams?"
faqA2: "Not directly. Icing sugar is much finer, so substituting granulated sugar will alter texture. If needed, blend granulated sugar into a powder first. For best results, stick to the recipe's specified 375 grams of icing sugar."
faqQ3: "Why does my frosting turn out too thick when using 375 grams of icing sugar?"
faqA3: "You might be over-measuring. Ensure you're not packing the sugar into cups—spoon it lightly and level off. Also, check if your recipe accounts for UK or US cup sizes, as this affects the 375 grams of icing sugar conversion."
faqQ4: "How do I store leftover icing sugar after measuring out 375 grams?"
faqA4: "Keep it in an airtight container in a cool, dry place. Exposure to humidity can cause clumping. If lumps form, sift before next use. Proper storage ensures your next 375 grams of icing sugar measurement stays accurate."

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Baking is a science, and even small deviations in measurements can affect texture and taste. Too much icing sugar can make frostings overly sweet or dense, while too little may leave them runny. Using the correct cup measurement for 375 grams of icing sugar ensures consistency, especially when adapting recipes for air fryers. If you're new to baking, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipes section</a> offers plenty of inspiration.</p>  

<p>Different countries use varying cup sizes, which can lead to confusion. The UK typically uses a 250ml cup, while the US uses 240ml. This slight difference means 375 grams of icing sugar converts to 3 UK cups or 3.5 US cups. Always check your recipe's origin to avoid mishaps.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure Icing Sugar Correctly</h3>  
<p>For the most accurate results, use a kitchen scale to weigh 375 grams of icing sugar directly. If you don't have one, spoon the sugar into a measuring cup and level it off with a knife—never pack it down. This method prevents over-measuring, which is common with powdery ingredients like icing sugar.</p>  

<h2>Converting 375g Icing Sugar for Air Fryer Recipes</h2>  
<p>Many modern bakers use air fryers for small-batch baking, where precision is key. Converting 375 grams of icing sugar to cups ensures your air fryer cakes or cookies turn out perfectly. For example, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>cake recipes</a> often call for precise sugar measurements to achieve the right crumb and sweetness.</p>  

<p>Air fryers cook faster than conventional ovens, so balanced ingredients are crucial. Too much sugar can cause over-browning, while too little may result in dry baked goods. Always double-check your 375 grams of icing sugar conversion to avoid these issues.</p>  

<h3>Common Mistakes When Measuring Icing Sugar</h3>  
<p>One frequent error is scooping icing sugar directly from the bag with a measuring cup, which compacts it and leads to excess. Another is confusing UK and US cup sizes, resulting in inaccurate measurements. Always fluff the sugar first and use the correct cup size for 375 grams of icing sugar.</p>  

<h2>Handy Tips for Baking with Icing Sugar</h2>  
<p>If your recipe calls for 375 grams of icing sugar but you're short, you can make your own by blending granulated sugar until powdery. Just ensure it's finely ground to avoid graininess. For more baking tips, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> guides.</p>  

<p>Storing icing sugar properly keeps it fresh and lump-free. Transfer it to an airtight container after opening, and sift before use if it's been sitting awhile. This step is especially important for air fryer recipes, where clumps can affect texture.</p>  

<h3>Cleaning Up After Using Icing Sugar</h3>

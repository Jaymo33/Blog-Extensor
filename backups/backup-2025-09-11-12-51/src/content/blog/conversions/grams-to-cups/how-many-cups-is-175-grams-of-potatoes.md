faqQ1: "Does the type of potato affect how many cups are in 175 grams?"
faqA1: "Yes, potato variety can slightly affect the cup measurement. Starchy potatoes like russets are less dense than waxy varieties, so 175 grams might fill slightly more volume. However, the difference is minimal - generally around 1.25 cups for diced potatoes regardless of type."
faqQ2: "Can I use frozen potatoes to measure 175 grams in cups?"
faqA2: "Frozen potatoes often have added moisture, so 175 grams may take up slightly more space than fresh. For frozen diced potatoes, still use about 1.25 cups as a starting point. Just pat them dry before air frying to ensure crispiness."
faqQ3: "How many medium potatoes equal 175 grams?"
faqA3: "One medium potato (about 5-7cm diameter) typically weighs 150-200 grams, so one medium potato is roughly equivalent to 175 grams. If your potatoes are very large or small, it's best to weigh them or use the cup measurement for accuracy."
faqQ4: "Why does my 175 grams of potatoes look different when chopped vs whole?"
faqA4: "Chopping creates air gaps between pieces, making 175 grams appear to fill more volume. Whole potatoes pack more densely. That's why 175 grams of whole potatoes looks smaller than 175 grams of diced - but the weight remains the same. Always measure by weight for baking recipes."

<h2>Best Potato Types for Air Frying</h2>  
<p>Not all potatoes are created equal when it comes to air frying. Russet and Maris Piper potatoes are ideal for crispy results due to their high starch content. For 175 grams of these varieties, you'll get perfectly golden wedges or chips in about 15-20 minutes. Sweet potatoes also work well but may require a light oil coating.</p>  

<p>Waxy potatoes like Charlotte or Jersey Royals hold their shape better but won't crisp up as much. If you're using these, 175 grams (1.25 cups) is still a good portion for roasting or air-frying.

faqQ1: "Is 400 grams of milk the same as 400 ml?"
faqA1: "No, 400 grams of milk is not the same as 400 ml. Milk’s density means 400 grams equals roughly 388 ml (US) or 400 grams equals about 400 ml (UK). Always check your recipe’s measurement unit for accuracy."
faqQ2: "Can I use plant-based milk instead of dairy milk for 400 grams?"
faqA2: "Yes, plant-based milk like almond or oat milk can substitute dairy milk in most recipes. However, their density may vary slightly, so weighing 400 grams ensures consistency. Adjust other ingredients if needed for texture."
faqQ3: "How do I measure 400 grams of milk without a scale?"
faqA3: "Use a liquid measuring cup: 400 grams is approximately 1.69 US cups or 1.42 UK cups. For accuracy, opt for a scale, especially in baking. A slight overpour can alter your recipe’s outcome."
faqQ4: "Why does my air fryer recipe require grams instead of cups?"
faqA4: "Grams provide precision, crucial for air fryer cooking where even small imbalances affect results. Cups can vary based on how you fill them, but grams ensure consistency every time. Always follow the recipe’s preferred unit."

<p>400 grams of milk is roughly equivalent to 1.69 cups (US) or 1.42 cups (UK). This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements matter. Whether you're whipping up a cake or a creamy sauce, knowing how to convert grams to cups ensures your dish turns out perfectly. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we help you nail every recipe with accurate conversions.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Milk Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Getting the right amount of milk is crucial for air fryer recipes, especially when baking. Too much or too little can affect texture and taste. For example, a <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>fluffy cake</a> requires precise liquid ratios to rise properly. Similarly, creamy dishes like sauces or custards rely on exact milk measurements for the perfect consistency. Using 400 grams of milk ensures your recipe stays on track.</p>  

<p>Different types of milk (whole, skim, or plant-based) have slight density variations, but 400 grams generally converts to the same cup measurement. Always use a kitchen scale for accuracy, especially when following recipes from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>our conversion chart</a>. This avoids guesswork and guarantees delicious results every time.</p>  

<h2>US vs. UK Cup Measurements</h2>  
<p>In the US, a standard cup holds 240 ml, while a UK cup is 284 ml. This means 400 grams of milk equals about 1.69 US cups or 1.42 UK cups. If you're using an air fryer recipe from a US source, stick to the US measurement for best results. For UK recipes, follow the UK cup equivalent to avoid discrepancies.</p>  

<h3>Converting Milk for Air Fryer Recipes</h3>  
<p>Many air fryer recipes, like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>cakes or pancakes</a>, list ingredients in grams or cups. If your recipe calls for 400 grams of milk and you prefer using cups, this conversion ensures accuracy. Remember, slight variations can occur based on milk fat content, so weighing is always the most reliable method.</p>  

<h2>Tips for Measuring Milk in an Air Fryer</h2>  
<p>Use a liquid measuring cup for milk, not a dry one, to ensure precision. Pour the milk to the desired line without tilting the cup. For sticky recipes like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>desserts</a>, a scale is your best friend. Clean your air fryer after cooking with milk-based dishes using <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>our recommended cleaner</a> to prevent residue buildup.</p>  

<p>If you’re scaling a recipe up or down, keep the milk ratio consistent. For example, halving a recipe that uses 400 grams of milk means you’ll need 200 grams (or 0.85 US cups). This ensures balanced flavours and textures, whether you’re cooking for one or a crowd.</p>

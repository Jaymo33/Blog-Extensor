faqQ1: "Is 200 grams of plain flour the same as 200ml?"
faqA1: "No, grams measure weight, while millilitres measure volume. Since flour’s density varies, 200 grams won’t always equal 200ml. For plain flour, 200 grams is roughly 1.6 UK cups or 1.5 US cups, not 200ml."
faqQ2: "Why does my flour measurement differ between UK and US cups?"
faqA2: "The UK uses a 250ml cup, while the US uses a 240ml cup. This small difference means 200 grams of plain flour fills slightly more in a UK cup (1.6 cups) compared to a US cup (1.5 cups). Always check which standard your recipe follows."
faqQ3: "Can I use self-raising flour instead of plain flour for 200 grams?"
faqA3: "You can substitute self-raising flour, but it contains baking powder, which affects texture. For every 200 grams of plain flour, you’d need to reduce baking powder elsewhere in the recipe. Stick to plain flour unless the recipe specifies otherwise."
faqQ4: "How do I store flour to keep measurements accurate?"
faqA4: "Store flour in an airtight container in a cool, dry place to prevent moisture absorption. Humidity can compact flour, making it denser. Fluff it with a fork before measuring to ensure consistent results in your baking or air frying."

<p>200 grams of plain flour equals approximately 1.6 cups in the UK or 1.5 cups in the US. Getting this conversion right is essential for baking and air frying, where precise measurements can make or break your dish. Whether you're whipping up cakes, bread, or crispy air-fried treats, knowing how to convert grams to cups ensures consistency. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we understand the importance of accurate measurements, especially when adapting recipes for your air fryer.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Flour Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Using the correct amount of plain flour is crucial for achieving the right texture in your baked goods or air-fried recipes. Too much flour can make your dish dense and dry, while too little can result in a soggy mess. For air fryer recipes, consistency is key—whether you're coating chicken or making dough for homemade bread. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more handy measurement tips.</p>  

<p>Different countries use different cup sizes, which can lead to confusion. In the UK, a standard cup holds 250ml, while in the US, it's 240ml. This slight variation means 200 grams of plain flour will measure slightly differently depending on where you are. Always double-check which cup measurement your recipe uses to avoid mishaps.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure 200 Grams of Plain Flour Without Scales</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a kitchen scale, you can still measure 200 grams of plain flour using cups. Spoon the flour into the cup lightly without packing it down, then level it off with a knife. Avoid scooping directly from the bag, as this compacts the flour and leads to inaccurate measurements.

<h2>Converting 200 Grams of Plain Flour for Different Recipes</h2>  
<p>Whether you're making cookies, cakes, or air-fried bread, 200 grams of plain flour is a common measurement. For cookies, this amount usually yields about 12-15 portions, depending on size. If you're coating chicken or fish for air frying, 200 grams of flour is enough for 4-6 servings. Need inspiration?

<p>Remember that humidity and how you store your flour can affect its density. If your flour has been sitting in a humid environment, it may compact more, meaning you’ll need slightly less by volume. Always fluff your flour with a fork before measuring to ensure accuracy.</p>  

<h3>Common Mistakes When Measuring Flour</h3>  
<p>One of the biggest mistakes is tapping or shaking the cup after filling it, which settles the flour and adds extra grams. Another error is using a liquid measuring cup instead of a dry one, as the spout can make levelling difficult. For best results, use proper dry measuring cups and follow the spoon-and-level method.

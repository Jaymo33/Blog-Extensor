faqQ1: "Can I use frozen blueberries instead of fresh for 75 grams?"
faqA1: "Yes, frozen blueberries can substitute fresh in equal amounts (75 grams or 0.5 cups). However, they may release more liquid during cooking, so adjust other wet ingredients slightly. Thaw and drain them first for best results."
faqQ2: "How do I measure 75 grams of blueberries without a scale?"
faqA2: "Use a measuring cup: 75 grams is roughly half a standard cup. Lightly fill the cup without packing the berries down. For accuracy, avoid compressing them, as this can lead to over-measuring."
faqQ3: "Does 75 grams of blueberries change if they’re mashed?"
faqA3: "Mashed blueberries will take up less space, so 75 grams may fill slightly less than half a cup. For recipes requiring whole berries, measure before mashing to ensure the right quantity."
faqQ4: "Are blueberry measurements the same in the UK and US?"
faqA4: "Yes, 75 grams converts to roughly 0.5 cups in both UK and US measurements. However, cup sizes can vary slightly by brand, so using a kitchen scale is the most precise method."

<p>75 grams of blueberries is roughly equivalent to 0.5 cups (or half a cup) when measured loosely. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precision ensures even cooking and perfect texture. Whether you're making blueberry muffins, pancakes, or a fruity topping, knowing this measurement helps avoid over or under-measuring.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Blueberry Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of blueberries in your air fryer recipes ensures balanced flavours and textures. Too many berries can make dishes soggy, while too few might leave them dry. For example, if you're making <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>blueberry pancakes</a>, 75 grams (half a cup) provides just the right burst of fruit without overwhelming the batter.</p>  

<p>Different recipes may require slight adjustments based on how the blueberries are packed. If you’re following a <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert recipe</a>, lightly spooning the berries into the cup is best. For firmer dishes, like a crumble, gently pressing them down may work better.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure 75 Grams of Blueberries Without Scales</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a kitchen scale, use a standard measuring cup. Fill it halfway for 75 grams, ensuring the berries aren’t packed too tightly. This method works well for most <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversions</a>, especially when baking.</p>  

<h2>Converting Blueberries for Different Recipes</h2>  
<p>When adapting recipes for your air fryer, knowing that 75 grams equals half a cup simplifies adjustments. For instance, if a cake recipe calls for 150 grams of blueberries, you’d use one full cup instead. This consistency helps maintain the dish’s integrity.</p>  

<p>Frozen blueberries can also be measured this way, though they may release more moisture. If using frozen, consider reducing other liquids slightly. Check out our guide on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/frozen-foods>frozen food conversions</a> for more tips.</p>  

<h3>Common Mistakes When Measuring Blueberries</h3>  
<p>Overpacking the cup is a frequent error, leading to more blueberries than needed. Instead, lightly fill the cup and level it off. Also, washing berries before measuring can add extra water weight—pat them dry first for accuracy.</p>  

<h2>Using 75 Grams of Blueberries in Air Fryer Recipes</h2>  
<p>From <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/breakfast>breakfast dishes</a> to desserts, 75 grams of blueberries is a versatile amount. Try them in air-fried oatmeal cups or as a topping for yoghurt bark. Their natural sweetness enhances flavour without added sugar.</p>  

<p>For savoury dishes, like a glaze for chicken, half a cup of blueberries blends beautifully with balsamic vinegar. Experiment with our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a> to find new ways to use this measurement.</p>

faqQ1: "Is 275 grams of brown sugar the same as 275 grams of white sugar in cups?"
faqA1: "No, brown and white sugar measure differently due to density and moisture. Brown sugar is denser and slightly heavier per cup when packed. While 275 grams of white sugar equals about 1.4 cups, the same weight of brown sugar is roughly 1.3 cups. Always check your recipe's specific requirements."
faqQ2: "Can I use 275 grams of brown sugar in savoury air fryer dishes?"
faqA2: "Absolutely! Brown sugar adds depth to glazes for meats like ham or salmon. Its molasses content balances spicy or smoky flavours beautifully. Just remember to adjust other seasonings accordingly, as 275 grams will add significant sweetness."
faqQ3: "Why does my air fryer bake differently when I substitute brown sugar?"
faqA3: "Brown sugar’s acidity and moisture affect browning and rise. In air fryers, which cook faster than conventional ovens, these traits can lead to over-browning if not monitored. Reduce temperature by 5°C or check doneness a few minutes early when using brown sugar."
faqQ4: "How should I store leftover brown sugar after measuring 275 grams?"
faqA4: "Keep it in an airtight container with a terra cotta disc or marshmallow to prevent hardening. If it clumps, microwave briefly with a damp paper towel or revive it in your air fryer at 100°C for 2-3 minutes. Never refrigerate, as moisture causes clumping."

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Baking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers cook food quickly and evenly, but only if your ingredient ratios are correct. Too much or too little brown sugar can affect texture, browning, and even cooking times. For example, excess sugar may cause your cookies to spread too thin, while too little can leave them dry. That's why converting 275 grams of brown sugar to cups accurately is crucial. Visit <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>our recipe hub</a> for foolproof air fryer desserts.</p>  

<p>Brown sugar is denser than granulated sugar, so it packs differently in a measuring cup. Lightly packing it ensures you don’t end up with more sugar than needed. If you're adapting a recipe from grams to cups, always use the spoon-and-level method for consistency. This is especially important for air fryer recipes, where even heat distribution relies on balanced ingredients.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure 275 Grams of Brown Sugar Without Scales</h3>  
<p>No kitchen scales? No problem! You can still measure 275 grams of brown sugar using standard cups. One lightly packed cup of brown sugar weighs roughly 220 grams, so 275 grams is just over 1 1/4 cups. For precision, fill your cup loosely and level it off with a knife. If your recipe calls for tightly packed sugar, you might need slightly less—around 1.2 cups.

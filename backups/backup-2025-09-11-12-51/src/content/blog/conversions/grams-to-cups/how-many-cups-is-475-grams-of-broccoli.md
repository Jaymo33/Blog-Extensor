faqQ1: "Does the cup measurement change if the broccoli is raw or cooked?"
faqA1: "Yes, cooked broccoli takes up less space than raw broccoli. When cooked, 475 grams of broccoli will reduce to about 3–3.5 cups due to water loss. Always measure raw broccoli for recipes unless specified otherwise."
faqQ2: "Can I use frozen broccoli instead of fresh for this conversion?"
faqA2: "Frozen broccoli can be used, but it may release more water during cooking. For 475 grams of frozen broccoli, thaw and drain it first to avoid excess moisture. The cup measurement will be similar to fresh broccoli once prepared."
faqQ3: "How do I store leftover broccoli after measuring 475 grams?"
faqA3: "Store unused broccoli in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 3 days. For longer storage, blanch and freeze it. This ensures it stays fresh for future air fryer recipes."
faqQ4: "Why does my air-fried broccoli sometimes turn out soggy?"
faqA4: "Soggy broccoli is often due to overcrowding or excess moisture. Spread 475 grams of broccoli evenly in the air fryer basket and cook in batches if needed. Patting it dry before cooking also helps achieve crispiness."

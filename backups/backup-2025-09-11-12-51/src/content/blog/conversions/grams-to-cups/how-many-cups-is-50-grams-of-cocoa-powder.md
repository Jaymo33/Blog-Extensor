faqQ1: "Is 50 grams of cocoa powder the same as 50 grams of flour in cups?"
faqA1: "No, 50 grams of cocoa powder and flour measure differently in cups. Cocoa powder is denser, so 50 grams equals about 0.42 UK cups, while flour would be closer to 0.4 UK cups. Always check specific conversions for each ingredient."
faqQ2: "Can I use tablespoons to measure 50 grams of cocoa powder?"
faqA2: "Yes, you can use tablespoons as an alternative. Approximately 10 level tablespoons make up 50 grams of cocoa powder. However, for baking precision, especially in air fryer recipes, weighing is more reliable."
faqQ3: "Does the type of cocoa powder affect the cup measurement?"
faqA3: "Yes, Dutch-processed cocoa powder is slightly denser than natural cocoa powder. This means 50 grams might take up marginally less space. For most recipes, the difference is minimal, but for exact measurements, weigh your cocoa powder."
faqQ4: "How do I convert 50 grams of cocoa powder to ounces?"
faqA4: "50 grams of cocoa powder equals approximately 1.76 ounces. This conversion is useful if your recipe uses imperial measurements. Remember that air fryer recipes often work best with metric measurements for precision."

<h3>UK vs. US Cup Measurements</h3>  
<p>In the UK, 50 grams of cocoa powder equals roughly 0.42 cups, while in the US, it’s closer to 0.5 cups. This difference arises because UK and US cups aren’t the same size. Always check which measurement system your recipe uses to avoid mistakes.</p>

faqQ1: "Does 400 grams of brown sugar equal 2 cups in the UK and US?"
faqA1: "Yes, 400 grams of brown sugar is roughly 2 cups in both the UK and US, though slight variations can occur due to packing density. For precision, especially in air fryer recipes, weighing ingredients is best."
faqQ2: "Can I use granulated sugar instead of brown sugar for 400 grams?"
faqA2: "You can substitute granulated sugar, but the texture and flavor will differ. Brown sugar adds moisture and a caramel note, so adjust liquids slightly if swapping. For air fryer baking, sticking to the recipe ensures better results."
faqQ3: "How do I prevent brown sugar from hardening after measuring 400 grams?"
faqA3: "Store brown sugar in an airtight container with a moisture-retaining item like bread or a clay saver. If it hardens, microwave it briefly with a damp paper towel to soften before measuring."
faqQ4: "Why does my air fryer recipe need exact sugar measurements like 400 grams?"
faqA4: "Air fryers cook faster than ovens, so precise measurements prevent over-browning or uneven cooking. Too much sugar can cause burning, while too little may affect texture. Always measure carefully for best results."

<p>400 grams of brown sugar is roughly equivalent to 2 cups when lightly packed, but this can vary slightly depending on how tightly it's measured. For precise baking, especially in air fryers where ingredient ratios matter, knowing exact conversions ensures perfect results every time. Whether you're whipping up air fryer cookies or cakes, getting the sugar measurement right is crucial for texture and sweetness.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Brown Sugar Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Brown sugar is denser than granulated sugar, meaning volume measurements like cups can vary based on packing. Too much sugar can make baked goods overly sweet or affect texture, while too little can leave them bland. For air fryer recipes, where cooking times are shorter, precise measurements ensure even cooking and perfect browning. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for other common ingredient conversions.</p>  

<p>Different brands of brown sugar may also have slight variations in moisture content, which affects volume. Lightly packed brown sugar fills a cup differently than firmly packed, so always use a spoon to fill the measuring cup evenly. If you're adapting a traditional recipe for your air fryer, accurate conversions like 400 grams to cups are essential for success.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure 400 Grams of Brown Sugar Correctly</h3>  
<p>The best way to measure 400 grams of brown sugar is by using a kitchen scale for precision. If you don't have one, lightly spoon the sugar into a measuring cup and level it off without packing it down. For most recipes, 400 grams will equal about 2 cups, but check our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a> for air fryer-specific measurements.</p>  

<h2>Converting Grams to Cups for Different Sugar Types</h2>  
<p>Not all sugars weigh the same per cupâ€”brown sugar is heavier than granulated sugar due to its molasses content. For example, 400 grams of granulated sugar equals about 2 cups, but brown sugar may require slightly less volume. This is especially important for air fryer baking, where ingredient ratios impact cooking time and texture.</p>  

<p>If you're working with dark brown sugar, note that it has even more moisture, which can slightly alter the conversion. For consistent results, weigh your ingredients whenever possible.

<h3>Common Baking Recipes Using 400 Grams of Brown Sugar</h3>  
<p>Many classic desserts, like chocolate chip cookies or sticky toffee pudding, call for around 400 grams of brown sugar. In an air fryer, these recipes cook faster, so proper sugar measurement ensures even caramelization without burning.

<h2>Tips for Storing and Using Brown Sugar</h2>  
<p>To keep brown sugar soft and easy to measure, store it in an airtight container with a slice of bread or a terra cotta brown sugar saver. Hardened sugar can throw off your measurements, so always check its texture before using. For cleaning sticky residue from your air fryer, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning guide</a> has handy tips.</p>  

<p>If your recipe calls for 400 grams of brown sugar but you're short, you can mix white sugar with a tablespoon of molasses as a substitute. Just remember to adjust measurements slightly, as homemade brown sugar may be less dense.

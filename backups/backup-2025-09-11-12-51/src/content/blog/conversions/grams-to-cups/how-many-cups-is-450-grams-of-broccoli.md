faqQ1: "Does 450 grams of broccoli include the stems?"
faqA1: "Yes, 450 grams of broccoli typically includes both florets and stems unless specified otherwise. The stems are denser, so if you’re using only florets, you might need slightly less by weight to reach the same cup measurement."
faqQ2: "Can I use frozen broccoli instead of fresh for 450 grams?"
faqA2: "Absolutely! Frozen broccoli works well, but note that it may release more moisture during cooking. For 450 grams, thaw and pat it dry before air frying to ensure crispiness. The cup measurement may vary slightly due to ice content."
faqQ3: "How many servings does 450 grams of broccoli make?"
faqA3: "450 grams of broccoli serves about 4–6 as a side dish or 2–3 as a main component. It’s ideal for family meals or meal prepping, especially when paired with proteins or grains."
faqQ4: "Why does my air-fried broccoli turn out soggy?"
faqA4: "Sogginess usually happens from overcrowding the basket or not drying the broccoli thoroughly. For 450 grams, cook in batches if needed, and toss halfway for even crisping. Preheating the air fryer also helps."

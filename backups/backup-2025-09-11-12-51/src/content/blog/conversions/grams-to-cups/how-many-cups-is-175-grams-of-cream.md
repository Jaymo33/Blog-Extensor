faqQ1: "Is 175 grams of cream the same as 175 ml?"
faqA1: "No, 175 grams of cream is not the same as 175 ml. Cream is denser than water, so 175 grams will be slightly less in volume. For most types of cream, 175 grams is roughly 170-175 ml, but it's best to weigh it for accuracy."
faqQ2: "Can I use 175 grams of double cream instead of single cream in a recipe?"
faqA2: "Yes, but keep in mind that double cream has a higher fat content, which can affect the texture of your dish. If substituting, you might need to adjust other liquids slightly. For air fryer recipes, this is especially important to prevent overly rich or greasy results."
faqQ3: "How do I measure 175 grams of cream without scales?"
faqA3: "Without scales, use a liquid measuring cup and fill it to just under 3/4 cup for 175 grams of cream. For better accuracy, spoon the cream into the cup gently without packing it down. This method works well for most cooking and baking needs."
faqQ4: "Does the type of cream affect the conversion from grams to cups?"
faqA4: "Yes, slightly. Thicker creams like double or clotted cream will be denser, so 175 grams might take up slightly less volume than single or whipping cream. For most recipes, the difference is minimal, but for precision baking, weighing is best."

<p>175 grams of cream is roughly 0.74 cups (or just under 3/4 cup). This conversion is handy for baking, cooking, or whipping up air fryer recipes where precision matters.

<h2>Why Accurate Cream Measurements Matter</h2>
<p>Getting the right amount of cream can make or break a recipe. Too much, and your dish might become overly rich or soggy. Too little, and it could lack creaminess or moisture.

For example, a creamy sauce or a baked dessert needs the perfect balance to achieve the desired consistency.</p>

<h2>How to Measure 175 Grams of Cream</h2>

faqQ1: "Is 75 grams of yogurt the same as 75 millilitres?"
faqA1: "No, grams and millilitres measure different properties. While 75 grams of yogurt is roughly 0.31 cups, millilitres measure volume and can vary based on yogurt density. For accuracy, always weigh yogurt when possible."
faqQ2: "Can I use 75 grams of yogurt in savoury air fryer recipes?"
faqA2: "Absolutely! 75 grams of yogurt (0.31 cups) works wonderfully in marinades, dips, and even as a coating for crispy air-fried meats. Its acidity helps tenderise proteins while adding creaminess."
faqQ3: "How do I measure 75 grams of yogurt if I don’t have a scale?"
faqA3: "Use a measuring cup and fill it to just under 1/3 cup for an approximate 75-gram portion. For thicker yogurts like Greek, spoon it lightly to avoid compacting."
faqQ4: "Does the type of yogurt affect the 75-gram to cup conversion?"
faqA4: "Yes, thicker yogurts like Greek may slightly alter the volume. While 75 grams is still about 0.31 cups, denser varieties might require gentle levelling for accuracy. Always check consistency for best results."

<h3>Common Mistakes When Measuring Yogurt</h3>  
<p>One frequent error is scooping yogurt directly from the tub, which can lead to uneven measurements. Instead, spoon it gently into the cup to avoid air pockets. Another mistake is confusing grams with millilitres—remember, 75 grams of yogurt is about 0.31 cups, not fluid ounces.</p>  

<h2>Best Yogurt Types for Air Fryer Recipes</h2>  
<p>Greek yogurt is ideal for air fryer cooking due to its thick consistency. When converting 75 grams of Greek yogurt to cups, it’s still roughly 0.31 cups, but its density may vary slightly. For lighter recipes, natural yogurt works well, especially in <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>desserts</a> or breakfast bakes.</p>  

<p>If you’re using flavoured yogurt, adjust sugar levels in your recipe accordingly. Since 75 grams of flavoured yogurt may contain added sweeteners, reduce other sugars to balance the taste. Always check labels for accurate conversions.</p>

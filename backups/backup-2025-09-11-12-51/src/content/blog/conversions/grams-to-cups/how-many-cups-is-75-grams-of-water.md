faqQ1: "Is 75 grams of water the same as 75ml?"
faqA1: "Yes, for water, 75 grams equals 75 millilitres (ml) because water’s density is 1g/ml. This makes measuring easier—use a liquid measuring cup for ml or a scale for grams. Note that oils or syrups differ due to density."
faqQ2: "How do I measure 75 grams of water without a scale?"
faqA2: "Use a liquid measuring cup: 75 grams is roughly 1/3 cup (minus 1 teaspoon). For better accuracy, UK cooks can use 5 UK tablespoons (15ml each). A <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a> helps with smaller increments."
faqQ3: "Does the cup type (US/UK) affect 75 grams of water?"
faqA3: "Slightly. A US cup is 240ml (so 75g = ~0.31 cups), while a UK cup is 250ml (~0.3 cups). For 75 grams, the difference is negligible, but for larger quantities, stick to one measurement system."
faqQ4: "Can I use 75 grams of water for air fryer steaming?"
faqA4: "Absolutely! Add 75 grams of water to an oven-safe dish beneath foods like dumplings or fish to create steam. Just ensure it doesn’t touch the heating element. Check our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>steaming recipes</a> for timing tips."

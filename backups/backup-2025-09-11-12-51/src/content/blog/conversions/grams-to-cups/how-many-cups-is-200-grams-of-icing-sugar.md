faqQ1: "Is 200 grams of icing sugar the same as 200 grams of granulated sugar in cups?"
faqA1: "No, granulated and icing sugar have different densities. While 200 grams of granulated sugar equals about 1 cup (UK/US), icing sugar is lighter, so 200 grams fills approximately 1.6 UK cups or 1.5 US cups. Always check which type your recipe specifies."
faqQ2: "How do I measure 200 grams of icing sugar without scales?"
faqA2: "Without scales, use the spoon-and-level method: lightly spoon icing sugar into a measuring cup until slightly heaped, then level off with a knife. For 200 grams, you'll need about 1.5 US cups or 1.6 UK cups. For accuracy, especially in air fryer baking, investing in a digital scale is recommended."
faqQ3: "Does sifted vs. unsifted icing sugar affect the cup measurement?"
faqA3: "Yes, sifted icing sugar is fluffier and takes up more volume. If your recipe calls for sifted sugar, sift it before measuring. For 200 grams, you might need slightly more unsifted sugar to reach the same weight after sifting. This is crucial for air fryer recipes where texture impacts cooking."
faqQ4: "Can I use this conversion for other powdered ingredients like flour or cocoa?"
faqA4: "No, each powdered ingredient has a unique density. For example, 200 grams of flour equals about 1.6 cups, while cocoa powder is closer to 2 cups. Always refer to specific conversion charts, like those on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, for accurate measurements across ingredients."

<p>200 grams of icing sugar equals approximately 1.6 cups in the UK or 1.5 cups in the US. This conversion is essential for bakers who rely on precise measurements for perfect results, especially when using an air fryer for cakes or desserts. Whether you're following a recipe from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> or adapting a traditional bake, knowing how to convert grams to cups ensures consistency.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Measurement Matters</h2>  
<p>Baking is a science, and even small deviations in ingredient quantities can affect texture and taste. Icing sugar, also known as powdered sugar, is particularly finicky because its density varies based on how it's packed. Too much can make frostings overly sweet or stiff, while too little can leave them runny. If you're using an air fryer for baking, precise measurements become even more critical due to the appliance's rapid cooking method.</p>

From cookies to sponges, accurate conversions ensure your treats turn out perfectly every time. Whether you're in the UK or the US, understanding the difference between metric and imperial measurements is key to baking success.</p>  

<h3>UK vs. US Cup Measurements</h3>  
<p>In the UK, 1 cup of icing sugar typically weighs 125 grams, meaning 200 grams is roughly 1.6 cups. In the US, where 1 cup equals 132 grams, 200 grams translates to about 1.5 cups. This slight difference matters when scaling recipes, so always check which system your recipe uses.

<h2>How to Measure Icing Sugar Correctly</h2>  
<p>The way you measure icing sugar can impact the final quantity. Spooning it lightly into a cup and leveling it off yields a more accurate result than scooping directly from the bag, which can compact the sugar. If your recipe calls for sifted icing sugar, measure after sifting to avoid discrepancies. This is especially important for air fryer baking, where even heat distribution relies on consistent batter or frosting texture.</p>  

<p>For those new to air fryer baking, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>cake recipes</a> offer step-by-step guidance. Remember, 200 grams of icing sugar is a common measurement for frostings and glazes, so mastering this conversion opens up a world of dessert possibilities. Always use a digital scale for the most precise results, especially when working with delicate ingredients.</p>  

<h3>Converting Other Sugar Quantities</h3>  
<p>If your recipe requires more or less than 200 grams, here's a quick reference: 100 grams equals 0.8 UK cups (0.75 US cups), while 300 grams equals 2.4 UK cups (2.25 US cups).

These ratios apply to pure icing sugar; if your blend includes cornflour (common in commercial varieties), the weight-to-volume ratio may vary slightly.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for 200 Grams of Icing Sugar</h2>  
<p>This quantity is perfect for buttercream frosting covering a single-layer cake or a batch of 12-18 cupcakes. It's also ideal for dusting desserts or making glazes for air fryer-baked goods like doughnuts or cinnamon rolls. When preparing these treats, ensure your air fryer is cleanâ€”our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning guide</a> helps maintain performance.</p>  

<p>For lighter options, 200 grams can sweeten a fruit salad topping or whipped cream. In savory applications, a sprinkle balances spicy dishes. The versatility of icing sugar makes it a staple in both traditional and air fryer baking, so keeping conversion knowledge handy streamlines your cooking process.</p>

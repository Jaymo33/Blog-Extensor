<p>475 grams of honey is approximately 1.4 cups in the UK and 1.2 cups in the US. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes, where precise measurements can make or break your dish.

<h2>Why Accurate Honey Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Honey is denser than many other liquids, so volume measurements like cups can vary based on how it's poured. Too much honey can make dishes overly sweet or sticky, while too little might leave them bland. This is especially important in air fryer cooking, where even heat distribution relies on balanced ingredients. For example, a honey-glazed salmon or a batch of air-fried cookies needs the right ratio for perfect results. Visit <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>our recipe collection</a> for inspiration on using honey in your air fryer.</p>  

<h3>UK vs. US Cup Measurements</h3>  
<p>In the UK, a standard cup holds 250ml, while in the US, it's 240ml. This slight difference means 475 grams of honey equals roughly 1.4 UK cups or 1.2 US cups. Always check your recipe's origin to avoid measurement mishaps. For baking or glazing in your air fryer, sticking to the correct cup size ensures your dish turns out as intended.</p>  

<h2>How to Measure Honey Without Sticky Mess</h2>  
<p>Measuring honey can be tricky due to its sticky texture. Lightly coating your measuring cup with oil or non-stick spray helps it slide out easily. Alternatively, use a kitchen scale for grams-to-cups precisionâ€”especially useful for air fryer recipes where accuracy is key.

<h3>Converting Other Honey Amounts</h3>

faqQ1: "Is 325 grams of plain flour the same as 3 cups?"
faqA1: "No, 325 grams of plain flour is roughly 2.6 UK cups or 2.7 US cups. Cup sizes vary between countries, so always check which measurement standard your recipe uses. For precise baking, especially in an air fryer, weighing flour is best."
faqQ2: "How do I measure 325 grams of plain flour without scales?"
faqA2: "Use the spoon-and-level method: spoon flour into a measuring cup and level it off with a knife. For 325 grams, you'll need just under 3 cups. Avoid scooping directly from the bag, as this compacts the flour and leads to over-measuring."
faqQ3: "Does the type of flour affect the cup measurement?"
faqA3: "Yes, different flours have varying densities. Plain flour is lighter than wholemeal, so 325 grams will take up slightly more volume. Always refer to a conversion chart for the specific type of flour you're using."
faqQ4: "Can I use 325 grams of plain flour in any air fryer recipe?"
faqA4: "Yes, but adjust cooking times as needed. Air fryers cook faster than ovens, so batters or doughs made with 325 grams of plain flour may need shorter baking times. Check recipes on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> for guidance."

<p>325 grams of plain flour is roughly equivalent to 2.6 cups in the UK or 2.7 cups in the US. This conversion is essential for bakers who rely on precise measurements for perfect results, especially when using an air fryer. Whether you're whipping up cakes, cookies, or bread, knowing how to convert grams to cups ensures consistency in your recipes.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Flour Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Baking is a science, and even small measurement discrepancies can affect texture and rise. Too much flour can make baked goods dense, while too little can leave them crumbly. For air fryer recipes, where cooking times are shorter, precision is even more critical. That's why converting 325 grams of plain flour to cups correctly ensures your <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> turn out perfectly every time.</p>  

<p>Different countries use different cup sizes, which adds another layer of complexity. The UK uses a 250ml cup, while the US uses a 240ml cup. This slight difference means 325 grams of plain flour converts to 2.6 UK cups or 2.7 US cups. Always check which standard your recipe follows to avoid mistakes.</p>  

<h2>How to Measure 325 Grams of Plain Flour</h2>  
<p>The most accurate way to measure flour is by weight, but if you don't have scales, the spoon-and-level method works. Simply spoon flour into a measuring cup and level it off with a knife. Avoid scooping directly from the bag, as this compacts the flour and leads to over-measuring. For 325 grams of plain flour, you'll need just under 3 cups using this method.</p>  

<h3>UK vs. US Cup Measurements</h3>  
<p>In the UK, 1 cup of plain flour weighs approximately 125 grams, meaning 325 grams equals 2.6 cups. In the US, 1 cup weighs around 120 grams, so 325 grams is closer to 2.7 cups. This small difference matters in recipes where precision is key, such as <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>air fryer cakes</a> or pastries.</p>

Alongside flour, you might need to convert sugar, butter, or other ingredients from grams to cups. Keeping a chart handy ensures you never have to guess measurements mid-recipe.</p>  

<p>For example, 325 grams of plain flour is a common measurement for larger batches of cookies or bread. Knowing the exact cup equivalent helps streamline your baking process, especially when adapting traditional oven recipes for the air fryer. Always double-check conversions to avoid mishaps.</p>  

<h3>Tips for Perfect Air Fryer Baking</h3>

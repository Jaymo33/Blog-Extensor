faqQ1: "How do I measure 125 grams of honey without a scale?"
faqA1: "Use a measuring cup and remember that 125 grams of honey is roughly 0.42 cups (or 1/3 cup plus 1 tablespoon). Lightly grease the cup for easier pouring, and level off the top for accuracy. Warming the honey slightly can also help it pour more smoothly."
faqQ2: "Does the type of honey affect the cup measurement for 125 grams?"
faqA2: "While all honey is dense, thicker varieties (like manuka) may pack slightly more into a cup. For most recipes, the difference is minimal, so 125 grams of honey in cups will still be close to 0.42 cups. Stirring the honey before measuring ensures consistency."
faqQ3: "Can I use 125 grams of honey in savoury air fryer recipes?"
faqA3: "Absolutely! Honey works well in glazes for meats like chicken or salmon, or in marinades for vegetables. Its sweetness balances spicy or tangy flavours. Try mixing 125 grams of honey with soy sauce, garlic, or chilli for a delicious glaze."
faqQ4: "Why is measuring honey by weight better than by cups?"
faqA4: "Honey’s sticky texture can make cup measurements inconsistent, as air pockets or uneven pouring affect volume. Weighing 125 grams of honey ensures precision, especially in baking or air frying, where exact ratios matter for texture and flavour. A kitchen scale is the most reliable tool."

<h2>Why Accurate Honey Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of honey ensures your dishes aren’t overly sweet or lacking flavour. In air frying, sticky glazes or marinades rely on precise ratios to coat evenly. Too much honey can cause burning, while too little may leave your dish bland. For recipes like honey-glazed chicken or baked goods, 125 grams of honey in cups is a common measurement. Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> for inspiration on using honey perfectly.</p>  

<p>Honey’s viscosity means it doesn’t pour like water, so measuring by weight (grams) is often more reliable. A kitchen scale is the best tool, but if you’re using cups, spoon the honey in gently to avoid air gaps. Levelling off the top ensures accuracy. Whether you’re in the UK or USA, 125g honey to cups remains consistent, though cup sizes can vary slightly. Always check your recipe’s origin for the most accurate results.</p>

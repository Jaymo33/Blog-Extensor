faqQ1: "Is 835 ml of buttermilk the same as 3.5 cups in all countries?"
faqA1: "No, cup measurements vary by country. In the UK, 835 ml of buttermilk equals 3.5 cups (using the UK standard of 284 ml per cup). In the US, it’s slightly more at 3.52 cups (240 ml per cup). For air fryer recipes, this small difference usually doesn’t affect the outcome, but it’s good to know for precision baking."
faqQ2: "Can I use regular milk instead of buttermilk in air fryer recipes?"
faqA2: "You can substitute regular milk for buttermilk by adding 1 tablespoon of lemon juice or vinegar per 250 ml of milk. Let it sit for 5-10 minutes to thicken. However, buttermilk’s acidity and texture often work better in air fryer recipes, especially for marinating or baking, so substitutions may alter the results slightly."
faqQ3: "How do I measure 835 ml of buttermilk without a measuring jug?"
faqA3: "If you don’t have a measuring jug, use a kitchen scale: 835 ml of buttermilk weighs about 860 grams. Alternatively, a standard UK mug holds roughly 300 ml, so just under three mugs will give you approximately 835 ml. For accuracy, we recommend using proper measuring tools for best results in air fryer cooking."
faqQ4: "What air fryer recipes commonly use 835 ml of buttermilk?"
faqA4: "835 ml of buttermilk is often used for marinating whole chickens or large batches of chicken wings in the air fryer. It’s also common in baking recipes like air fryer pancakes or cakes, where the acidity helps with rising.

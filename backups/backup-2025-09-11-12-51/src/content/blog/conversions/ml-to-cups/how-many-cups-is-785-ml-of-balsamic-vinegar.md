faqQ1: "Is 785 ml of balsamic vinegar the same in US and UK cups?"
faqA1: "No, 785 ml of balsamic vinegar equals about 3.3 US cups or 3.1 UK cups. The difference comes from the varying cup sizes—240 ml in the US and 250 ml in the UK. Always check which measurement your recipe uses."
faqQ2: "Can I use a kitchen scale instead of measuring cups for balsamic vinegar?"
faqA2: "Yes, but since balsamic vinegar's density differs from water, ml or cup measurements are more reliable. If using a scale, 785 ml weighs roughly 800 grams, but a measuring cup is simpler for most recipes."
faqQ3: "How long does 785 ml of balsamic vinegar last once opened?"
faqA3: "Stored properly, an opened 785 ml bottle lasts 3–5 years. Keep it sealed in a cool, dark place to maintain quality. For air fryer recipes, fresh vinegar ensures the best flavour."
faqQ4: "What’s the best way to measure sticky balsamic vinegar without making a mess?"
faqA4: "Use a liquid measuring cup with a spout and pour slowly. Lightly coating the cup with oil helps the vinegar slide out easily. For air fryer glazes, precision prevents sticky cleanup later."

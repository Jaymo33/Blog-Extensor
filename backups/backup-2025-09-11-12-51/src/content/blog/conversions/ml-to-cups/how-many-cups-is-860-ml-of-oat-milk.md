faqQ1: "Is 860 ml of oat milk the same as 860 ml of regular milk in cups?"
faqA1: "Yes, 860 ml of oat milk converts to the same cup measurement as regular milk (about 3.63 cups) because volume measurements are based on liquid quantity, not density. However, oat milk may be slightly thicker, so adjust recipes if texture is crucial."
faqQ2: "Can I use a US cup to measure 860 ml of oat milk in the UK?"
faqA2: "Yes, but note that US cups (240 ml) differ slightly from UK metric cups (250 ml). For 860 ml, you’d need about 3.63 US cups versus 3.44 UK cups. For precision, stick to one measurement system or use millilitres."
faqQ3: "How does 860 ml of oat milk affect air fryer cooking times?"
faqA3: "Oat milk’s water content can influence cooking times slightly, especially in batters or sauces. Since air fryers cook faster than ovens, monitor dishes closely and adjust time by 1-2 minutes if the mixture seems too wet or dry."
faqQ4: "What’s the best way to store leftover 860 ml oat milk after opening?"
faqA4: "Transfer unused oat milk to an airtight container and refrigerate for up to 5 days. Shake well before reuse, as separation is normal. For longer storage, freeze in ice cube trays and thaw as needed for cooking."

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>

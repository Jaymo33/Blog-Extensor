<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on precise ingredient ratios to achieve the perfect crispiness and even cooking. Using 285 ml of water instead of the correct cup measurement can lead to soggy or unevenly cooked food. Whether you're making batters, marinades, or steaming vegetables, accuracy is key. For example, a recipe calling for 285 ml of water in a cake batter could turn out too dense if measured incorrectly. Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> for dishes that rely on perfect measurements.</p>  

<p>Different countries use varying cup sizes, which adds another layer of complexity. The US standard cup is 240 ml, while the UK metric cup is 250 ml. This means 285 ml of water converts to slightly different amounts depending on where you are. Always double-check which measurement system your recipe uses to avoid mishaps.

<h3>How to Measure 285 ml of Water Without a Measuring Cup</h3>  
<p>If you don't have a measuring cup, you can use a kitchen scale to weigh 285 grams of water, as 1 ml of water equals 1 gram. Alternatively, a standard UK tablespoon holds 15 ml, so 19 tablespoons would give you roughly 285 ml. For US tablespoons (14.79 ml), you'd need about 19.3 tablespoons. While these methods aren't as precise, they work in a pinch for recipes like soups or stews in your air fryer.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for 285 ml of Water in Air Fryer Recipes</h2>  
<p>Many air fryer recipes, such as steamed vegetables or poached fish, call for small amounts of water like 285 ml. This measurement is also common in baking, where hydration levels affect texture. For instance, a 285 ml water-to-flour ratio can make or break dough consistency for air-fried bread or dumplings. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable recipes</a> for dishes that often use this measurement.</p>  

<p>When making sauces or gravies in your air fryer, 285 ml of water might be the base for thinning ingredients. Accuracy ensures the right thickness and flavour balance.

faqQ1: "Is 560 ml of oat milk the same as 560 ml of regular milk in cups?"
faqA1: "Yes, 560 ml of oat milk converts to the same number of cups as regular milk because volume measurements are consistent regardless of the liquid type. However, oat milk’s thickness may vary slightly by brand, so it’s best to measure by volume for accuracy."
faqQ2: "Can I use 560 ml of oat milk in any air fryer recipe calling for milk?"
faqA2: "Absolutely! Oat milk is a great dairy-free substitute in air fryer recipes. Just ensure you’re using the correct conversion (560 ml ≈ 2.37 cups) to maintain the recipe’s balance. It works well in batters, sauces, and even desserts."
faqQ3: "How do I measure 560 ml of oat milk without a measuring cup?"
faqA3: "If you don’t have a measuring cup, use a kitchen scale. Oat milk weighs about 1.04 grams per ml, so 560 ml would be roughly 582 grams. Alternatively, a standard mug holds about 250 ml, so 2 mugs plus a little extra will get you close."
faqQ4: "Does oat milk behave differently in air fryer recipes compared to dairy milk?"
faqA4: "Oat milk performs similarly to dairy milk in most air fryer recipes, though it may brown slightly faster due to its sugar content. Keep an eye on cooking times and adjust as needed. For best results, stick to the 560 ml to cups conversion for consistency."

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of oat milk can make or break your recipe. Too little, and your dish might turn out dry; too much, and it could become soggy. For air fryer recipes, precision is key because the cooking process is faster and more intense. A slight miscalculation can affect texture and taste.</p>

<h2>How to Measure 560 ml of Oat Milk</h2>  
<p>Measuring liquids like oat milk is straightforward with the right tools. A liquid measuring cup is your best bet, as it’s designed to account for the meniscus (the curve at the top of the liquid). Pour the oat milk slowly until it reaches the 560 ml mark.</p>  
<p>If you don’t have a measuring cup, you can use a kitchen scale. Oat milk weighs roughly 1.04 grams per ml, so 560 ml would be about 582 grams. This method is handy if you’re scaling recipes up or down. For more conversion tips, visit our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>

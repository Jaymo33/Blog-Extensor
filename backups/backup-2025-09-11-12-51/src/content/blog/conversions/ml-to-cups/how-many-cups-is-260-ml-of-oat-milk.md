faqQ1: "Is 260 ml of oat milk the same as 260 ml of water in cups?"
faqA1: "Yes, 260 ml of oat milk is roughly the same volume as 260 ml of water when measuring in cups. Both equal about 1.1 cups, as the slight density difference in oat milk doesn’t significantly impact liquid measurements."
faqQ2: "Can I use a regular drinking cup to measure 260 ml of oat milk?"
faqA2: "While a standard UK mug holds about 284 ml, it’s not precise for measuring 260 ml. For accuracy, use a liquid measuring cup with metric markings. Eyeballing it may lead to inconsistencies in your recipes."
faqQ3: "How does 260 ml of oat milk convert to grams?"
faqA3: "Oat milk weighs roughly 1.03 grams per ml, so 260 ml equals about 268 grams. However, weight isn’t typically needed for liquid measurements unless specified in baking recipes."
faqQ4: "Why do some recipes use ml instead of cups for oat milk?"
faqA4: "Millilitres are more precise, especially in baking where ratios matter. Cups can vary by country (US vs. UK), while ml is a universal metric measurement, reducing errors in recipes."

<p>260 ml of oat milk is approximately 1.1 cups. This conversion is essential for anyone using oat milk in recipes, especially when cooking or baking with an air fryer. Whether you're whipping up a cake or preparing a creamy sauce, knowing the exact measurement ensures perfect results every time.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of oat milk can make or break your recipe. Too little, and your dish might turn out dry; too much, and it could become soggy. For air fryer recipes, precision is key, as the cooking process is faster and more intense than traditional methods. A slight miscalculation can affect texture and taste.</p>  
<p>If you're following a recipe from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, you'll often find measurements in millilitres or cups. Knowing how to convert between the two ensures you never go wrong. This is especially helpful for popular dishes like air-fried pancakes or oat milk-based batters.</p>  

<h2>How to Measure 260 ml of Oat Milk</h2>  
<p>The easiest way to measure 260 ml of oat milk is by using a liquid measuring cup with metric markings. If your cup only shows imperial measurements, remember that 1 cup equals roughly 240 ml. This means 260 ml is just over 1 cup—about 1 cup and 1 tablespoon.</p>  
<p>For those without measuring tools, a standard UK mug holds around 284 ml, so filling it just below the rim will give you close to 260 ml. However, for baking or precise cooking, investing in a good measuring jug is worth it.

<h3>Does Oat Milk Density Affect Measurements?</h3>  
<p>Unlike water, oat milk has a slightly thicker consistency, but the difference in density is minimal for measuring purposes. Whether you're using homemade or store-bought oat milk, 260 ml will still equate to roughly 1.1 cups. This consistency makes it easy to substitute oat milk in recipes calling for dairy milk.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for 260 ml of Oat Milk</h2>  
<p>This measurement is perfect for many air fryer recipes. For example, 260 ml of oat milk works well in batters for crispy tofu or as a base for creamy sauces. It's also ideal for baking—think fluffy cakes or moist muffins, all made easier with your air fryer.</p>  
<p>If you're meal prepping, 260 ml is a great portion for overnight oats or smoothies. For more inspiration, browse our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/breakfast>breakfast recipes</a> featuring oat milk. The versatility of this measurement makes it a kitchen staple.</p>  

<h3>Converting Other Oat Milk Amounts</h3>  
<p>If your recipe calls for a different amount, here’s a quick reference: 125 ml is about ½ cup, and 500 ml is roughly 2.1 cups. Keeping these conversions in mind saves time and ensures consistency across all your cooking and baking endeavours.</p>  

<h2>Tips for Storing Oat Milk</h2>  
<p>Once opened, oat milk should be refrigerated and used within 5-7 days. If you’ve measured out 260 ml but don’t need it all, store the remainder in an airtight container. Shake well before using, as separation is natural. For longer storage, consider freezing oat milk in ice cube trays for future recipes.</p>

faqQ1: "Is 210 ml of heavy cream the same as 210 grams?"
faqA1: "Yes, heavy cream has a density close to 1 gram per millilitre, so 210 ml of heavy cream weighs approximately 210 grams. This makes it easy to measure by weight if you don’t have a liquid measuring cup."
faqQ2: "Can I use half-and-half instead of heavy cream in a recipe calling for 210 ml?"
faqA2: "You can substitute half-and-half, but the result will be less rich and creamy. Heavy cream has a higher fat content (around 36%), while half-and-half is about 10-12% fat. For baking or sauces, stick to heavy cream for the best texture."
faqQ3: "How do I measure 210 ml of heavy cream without a measuring cup?"
faqA3: "If you don’t have a measuring cup, use a kitchen scale to weigh out 210 grams. Alternatively, a standard tablespoon holds about 15 ml, so 14 tablespoons would equal roughly 210 ml."
faqQ4: "Does 210 ml of heavy cream whip to the same volume as 210 ml of liquid cream?"
faqA4: "No, whipped cream expands in volume. 210 ml of liquid heavy cream will yield about 420-500 ml of whipped cream, depending on how stiff you whip it. Always measure the liquid form for recipes."

faqQ1: "Can I use fresh milk instead of evaporated milk in a 135 ml measurement?"
faqA1: "Yes, but you’ll need to adjust the quantity. Fresh milk is thinner, so use 1.5 times the amount (about 202.5 ml) to match the richness of 135 ml of evaporated milk. Keep in mind this may slightly alter cooking times in your air fryer."
faqQ2: "How do I measure 135 ml of evaporated milk without a measuring cup?"
faqA2: "You can use a standard tablespoon—135 ml is roughly 9 tablespoons. Alternatively, use a kitchen scale to measure 140 grams. For best results in air fryer recipes, stick to precise measurements for consistent outcomes."
faqQ3: "Why does my air fryer recipe turn out soggy with evaporated milk?"
faqA3: "This usually happens if you’ve added too much evaporated milk. Stick to 0.57 cups (135 ml) and ensure your air fryer is preheated. Also, avoid overcrowding the basket to allow proper air circulation."
faqQ4: "Is 135 ml of evaporated milk the same in the UK and US?"
faqA4: "Yes, 135 ml is a metric measurement used in both the UK and US. However, cup sizes can vary slightly, so always use a standard measuring cup or convert to millilitres for accuracy, especially in air fryer cooking."

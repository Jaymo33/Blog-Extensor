faqQ1: "Can I use regular milk instead of evaporated milk in a recipe?"
faqA1: "Yes, but you'll need to adjust the quantity. Evaporated milk is concentrated, so regular milk will be thinner. For every 785 ml (3.3 cups) of evaporated milk, use about 4 cups of regular milk and reduce other liquids slightly."
faqQ2: "Does 785 ml of evaporated milk weigh the same as water?"
faqA2: "No, evaporated milk is denser due to its reduced water content. While 785 ml of water weighs 785 grams, evaporated milk weighs closer to 800 grams. Always use a scale for precision in baking."
faqQ3: "How long does opened evaporated milk last in the fridge?"
faqA3: "Once opened, evaporated milk stays fresh for about 3–5 days if stored in an airtight container. For best results, label it with the date and use it in recipes like custards or soups."
faqQ4: "Can I freeze evaporated milk?"
faqA4: "Yes, but the texture may change slightly after thawing. Freeze 785 ml portions in ice cube trays for easy use in cooking. Thaw in the fridge overnight and stir well before using."

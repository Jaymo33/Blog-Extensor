<h2>Why Accurate Lime Juice Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of lime juice can make or break a dish. Too little, and your recipe lacks tang; too much, and it becomes overpowering. For air fryer recipes like citrus-glazed salmon or lime-infused shrimp, precision is key. A slight miscalculation can affect texture, flavour, and cooking time. That’s why converting 585 ml of lime juice to cups (2.47 cups) is so important.</p>  
<p>Many air fryer recipes, such as those found on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>our recipe page</a>, rely on balanced acidity for perfect results.

This is especially useful for batch cooking or meal prep, where scaling up or down is common.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure 585 ml of Lime Juice Without a Scale</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a measuring jug, you can use standard cups to measure 585 ml of lime juice. Since 1 cup equals 237 ml, 585 ml is roughly 2.47 cups. For smaller quantities, a tablespoon (15 ml) or teaspoon (5 ml) can help fine-tune the measurement. This method works well for recipes like lime drizzle cake or tangy chicken wings in the air fryer.</p>  

<h2>Converting 585 ml of Lime Juice for Different Recipes</h2>  
<p>Depending on the recipe, 585 ml of lime juice (2.47 cups) can be used in various ways.

faqQ1: "Is 210 ml of tomato sauce the same as 210 grams?"
faqA1: "Yes, 210 ml of tomato sauce is roughly equivalent to 210 grams, as tomato sauce has a similar density to water. This makes it easy to measure by weight if you don’t have a measuring jug. For precise air fryer recipes, weighing can be more accurate."
faqQ2: "Can I use a US cup to measure 210 ml of tomato sauce in the UK?"
faqA2: "Yes, but note that a US cup (240 ml) and a UK metric cup (250 ml) differ slightly. For 210 ml, a US cup will leave you just under full, while a UK cup will be about 0.84 cups. Always check your recipe’s origin for the most accurate conversion."
faqQ3: "How does 210 ml of tomato sauce affect air fryer cooking times?"
faqA3: "Using 210 ml of tomato sauce in air fryer recipes can add moisture, potentially extending cooking times slightly. To avoid sogginess, layer sauces thinly or pat ingredients dry before adding sauce. For perfect results, follow trusted recipes from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>."
faqQ4: "What’s the best way to measure 210 ml of tomato sauce without a jug?"
faqA4: "If you don’t have a measuring jug, use tablespoons (15 ml each). 210 ml equals 14 tablespoons. Alternatively, use a kitchen scale for grams or a standard cup, remembering the slight variance between US and UK measurements."

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter</h2>

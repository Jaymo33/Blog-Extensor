faqQ1: "Is 485 ml of lime juice the same as 2 cups?"
faqA1: "Not exactly. 485 ml equals roughly 2.05 US cups (240 ml per cup) or 1.94 UK cups (250 ml per cup). For most recipes, you can round to 2 cups, but for precision, measure with a jug or scale."
faqQ2: "Can I use bottled lime juice instead of fresh for air fryer recipes?"
faqA2: "Yes, but bottled lime juice often has a sharper, less fresh taste. If substituting, reduce the quantity slightly and adjust to taste. Fresh lime juice works best for marinades and dressings."
faqQ3: "How long does 485 ml of lime juice last in the fridge?"
faqA3: "Fresh lime juice lasts 3–4 days refrigerated. To extend its life, freeze it in portions. Bottled lime juice can last months unopened but check the expiry date once opened."
faqQ4: "What’s the best way to juice limes for 485 ml?"
faqA4: "Roll limes firmly on a countertop before cutting to maximise juice yield. Use a citrus juicer or reamer, and strain to remove pulp. For 485 ml, you’ll need about 12–15 medium limes."

<p>485 ml of lime juice equals approximately 2.05 cups. If you're working with an air fryer recipe that calls for lime juice, knowing this conversion ensures your dish turns out perfectly balanced. Whether you're marinating chicken, whipping up a zesty dessert, or preparing a tangy glaze, accurate measurements matter.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Lime Juice Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of lime juice can make or break a recipe. Too little, and your dish might lack brightness; too much, and it could become overpoweringly sour. For air fryer recipes, precision is key—especially when working with marinades or dressings. A dish like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer lime-glazed shrimp</a> relies on the perfect balance of acidity and sweetness.</p>  

<p>Lime juice also plays a role in tenderising meats and enhancing flavours. If you're preparing <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>air fryer lime chicken</a>, measuring 485 ml (or roughly 2 cups) correctly ensures the marinade penetrates evenly. Plus, knowing conversions helps when scaling recipes up or down.</p>  

<h2>How to Measure 485 ml of Lime Juice</h2>  
<p>If you don’t have a measuring jug with millilitre markings, use a standard US cup (240 ml) or UK cup (250 ml) for approximation. For 485 ml, you’d need just over 2 US cups or just under 2 UK cups. A kitchen scale can also help—485 ml of lime juice weighs about 485 grams, as its density is close to water.</p>  

<h3>Using an Air Fryer with Lime Juice</h3>  
<p>When adding lime juice to air fryer recipes, avoid over-saturating ingredients. A light spritz or brush works better than drenching, as excess liquid can lead to steaming instead of crisping. For recipes like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/fish>air fryer fish tacos</a>, drizzle lime juice after cooking for a fresh finish.</p>  

<h2>Common Recipes Using 485 ml of Lime Juice</h2>  
<p>This quantity is ideal for batch cooking or marinades. For example, a large batch of <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>key lime pie filling</a> might require 485 ml. It’s also handy for ceviche-style dishes or citrusy glazes. Check our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a> for other common measurements.</p>  

<p>If you’re prepping ahead, lime juice can be frozen in ice cube trays for later use. Each cube holds about 30 ml, so 485 ml would fill roughly 16 cubes. Thaw as needed for marinades or sauces.</p>  

<h3>Adjusting for Taste and Recipe Needs</h3>  
<p>Some limes are juicier or more acidic than others. Taste as you go, especially if substituting bottled lime juice for fresh. For air fryer recipes, a little goes a long way—start with half the amount and adjust. Need cleaning tips after cooking?

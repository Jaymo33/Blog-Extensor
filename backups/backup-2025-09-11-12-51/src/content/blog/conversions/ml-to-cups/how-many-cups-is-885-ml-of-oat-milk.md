faqQ1: "Is 885 ml of oat milk the same as 4 cups?"
faqA1: "No, 885 ml of oat milk is approximately 3.74 cups in the UK and 3.75 cups in the US. While it's close to 4 cups, the slight difference can matter in baking or precise recipes, especially in an air fryer where exact measurements affect cooking times."
faqQ2: "Can I use a regular cup to measure 885 ml of oat milk?"
faqA2: "It's best to use a liquid measuring cup marked with ml or cup measurements for accuracy. A standard drinking cup isn't uniform and could lead to incorrect amounts. For air fryer recipes, precision ensures even cooking and perfect results."
faqQ3: "Does oat milk measure the same as dairy milk in cups?"
faqA3: "Yes, oat milk and dairy milk have similar densities, so their volume measurements are comparable. However, always check your recipe, as some brands of oat milk may vary slightly in thickness. For air fryer baking, sticking to the recipe's specified measurement is safest."
faqQ4: "How can I measure 885 ml of oat milk without a measuring cup?"
faqA4: "If you don't have a measuring cup, you can use a scale (1 ml of oat milk weighs roughly 1 gram) or convert to tablespoons (885 ml is about 59 tablespoons). However, for air fryer recipes, investing in a proper measuring cup is recommended for consistency."

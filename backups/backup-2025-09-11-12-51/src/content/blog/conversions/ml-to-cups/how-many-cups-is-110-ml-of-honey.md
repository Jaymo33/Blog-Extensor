faqQ1: "Is 110 ml of honey the same as 110 grams?"
faqA1: "No, honey is denser than water, so 110 ml of honey weighs around 154 grams. The exact weight can vary slightly depending on the honey’s type and temperature. Always use a kitchen scale for precise measurements in baking."
faqQ2: "Can I use a regular cup to measure 110 ml of honey?"
faqA2: "A standard drinking cup isn’t accurate for measurements. Use a proper measuring cup with ml or cup markings for best results. For sticky ingredients like honey, a liquid measuring cup with a spout works best."
faqQ3: "How do I convert 110 ml of honey to tablespoons?"
faqA3: "110 ml of honey equals about 7 tablespoons plus 1 teaspoon. This conversion is useful for smaller quantities or when a measuring cup isn’t available. Lightly grease the spoon to help the honey slide off easily."
faqQ4: "Does the type of honey affect the 110 ml to cups conversion?"
faqA4: "Slightly. Raw honey is thicker, while processed honey flows more easily. However, the difference in volume is minimal, so 110 ml of any honey type will still be close to 0.46 US cups. Adjust based on your recipe’s needs."

<h2>Why Accurate Honey Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Honey is a sticky ingredient, and even small measurement errors can affect your recipe’s texture and sweetness.

<h3>US vs. UK Cup Measurements</h3>  
<p>In the US, a standard cup holds 240 ml, while a UK cup is 250 ml. This means 110 ml of honey is roughly 0.46 cups in the US and 0.44 cups in the UK. Always check your recipe’s origin to avoid discrepancies. For international recipes, our conversion guide simplifies the process.</p>  

<h2>How to Measure 110 ml of Honey Without a Scale</h2>  
<p>If you don’t have a measuring jug, use tablespoons for accuracy. One tablespoon holds about 15 ml, so 110 ml of honey equals roughly 7 tablespoons plus 1 teaspoon. This method is handy for smaller quantities in air fryer cooking. For sticky ingredients like honey, lightly greasing your spoon helps with clean pouring.</p>  

<p>Another trick is to use a liquid measuring cup with clear markings. Pour the honey slowly to avoid air bubbles, which can distort the measurement. Need more tips?

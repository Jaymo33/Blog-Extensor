<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of yogurt can affect the texture and taste of your dish. Too much yogurt might make your batter too wet, while too little could dry it out. Air fryers cook food quickly, so precise measurements help avoid under or overcooking. If you're new to air frying, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a> for foolproof ideas. Yogurt is a versatile ingredient, perfect for marinades, dips, and even desserts.</p>  

<p>Many UK and US recipes use cups, but if you're used to millilitres, conversions can be tricky. A standard cup holds 240 ml, but this varies slightly by country. For 660 ml of yogurt, you’ll need just under 3 cups. This measurement is handy for batch cooking or scaling recipes.

<h3>How to Measure Yogurt Correctly</h3>  
<p>For the most accurate results, use a liquid measuring cup for yogurt. Spoon the yogurt into the cup and level it off with a knife. Avoid packing it down, as this can lead to over-measuring. If you're using Greek yogurt, note that it’s denser than regular yogurt. Adjust slightly if your recipe calls for a specific consistency.</p>

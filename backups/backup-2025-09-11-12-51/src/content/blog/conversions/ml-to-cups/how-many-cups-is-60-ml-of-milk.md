faqQ1: "Is 60 ml of milk the same as 60 grams?"
faqA1: "No, 60 ml of milk is not the same as 60 grams. Milk’s density means 60 ml weighs about 61–62 grams, depending on fat content. For air fryer recipes, always measure by volume (ml or cups) unless the recipe specifies weight."
faqQ2: "Can I use plant-based milk instead of dairy milk for 60 ml measurements?"
faqA2: "Yes, plant-based milk like almond or oat milk can substitute dairy milk in the same 60 ml quantity. However, textures may vary slightly, so adjust cooking times in your air fryer if the batter seems thinner or thicker."
faqQ3: "How do I measure 60 ml of milk without a measuring jug?"
faqA3: "Use a tablespoon: 4 tablespoons equal 60 ml. Alternatively, a standard shot glass holds about 50 ml, so fill it slightly more for 60 ml. For precision, invest in a small measuring cup for air fryer recipes."
faqQ4: "Why do some recipes use ml instead of cups for milk measurements?"
faqA4: "Metric measurements (ml) are more precise, especially in baking. Cups can vary by country, but 60 ml is universally 0.25 cups. For air fryer cooking, ml ensures consistency across recipes from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> or international sources."

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on even cooking, and incorrect measurements can throw off textures and flavours.

At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we emphasise precision to help you achieve restaurant-quality results at home.</p>  
<p>Many air fryer recipes, like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>cakes</a> or <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/breakfast>breakfast dishes</a>, call for small amounts of milk. Measuring 60 ml of milk correctly ensures your dishes turn out just right.

<h3>How to Measure 60 ml of Milk Without a Measuring Cup</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a measuring cup, you can use a tablespoon. Since 1 tablespoon holds about 15 ml, 60 ml of milk equals 4 tablespoons. This method works well for small quantities, especially when preparing sauces or marinades in your air fryer.</p>  

<h2>Converting 60 ml of Milk for Different Recipes</h2>

For <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a>, consistency is key, so always measure carefully.</p>  
<p>For baking, like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>desserts</a>, even a small discrepancy can affect rising or texture.

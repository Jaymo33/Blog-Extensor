faqQ1: "Is 985 ml of almond milk the same as 4 cups?"
faqA1: "985 ml of almond milk is roughly 4.16 cups, so it’s slightly more than 4 cups. For precise baking or cooking, use a measuring jug with millilitre markings to ensure accuracy."
faqQ2: "Can I use 985 ml of almond milk in place of dairy milk in air fryer recipes?"

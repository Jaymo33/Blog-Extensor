faqQ1: "Is 610 ml of orange juice the same as 2.5 cups?"
faqA1: "Not quite. 610 ml equals approximately 2.58 cups in the UK (250 ml per cup) or 2.54 cups in the US (240 ml per cup). For air fryer recipes, this small difference can matter, especially in baking or reductions."
faqQ2: "Can I use bottled orange juice instead of fresh for air fryer recipes?"
faqA2: "Yes, but check for added sugars or preservatives, which may alter the recipe’s flavour and texture. Fresh-squeezed juice offers brighter acidity, ideal for marinades or glazes in air fryer cooking."
faqQ3: "How do I reduce 610 ml of orange juice for a glaze?"
faqA3: "Simmer it in a saucepan until it thickens to about 1/3 of its volume (roughly 200 ml). For air fryer glazes, apply it during the last few minutes of cooking to avoid burning."
faqQ4: "What’s the best way to measure 610 ml of orange juice without a jug?"
faqA4: "Use a standard metric cup (250 ml) for 2 full cups plus 2 tablespoons. For US cups, measure 2.5 cups (240 ml each) and add an extra teaspoon to match 610 ml precisely."

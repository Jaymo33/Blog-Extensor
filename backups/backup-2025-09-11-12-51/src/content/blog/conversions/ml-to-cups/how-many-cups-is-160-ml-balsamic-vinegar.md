faqQ1: "Is 160 ml of balsamic vinegar the same as 160 grams?"
faqA1: "No, 160 ml of balsamic vinegar is not the same as 160 grams. The weight depends on the vinegar’s density, which can vary. Generally, 160 ml of balsamic vinegar weighs around 168 grams, but it’s best to measure by volume for accuracy in recipes."
faqQ2: "Can I use a regular cup to measure 160 ml of balsamic vinegar?"

faqA3: "Simmer 160 ml of balsamic vinegar in a saucepan over low heat until it thickens, about 10-15 minutes. Stir occasionally to prevent burning. The reduced vinegar will be sweeter and more concentrated, perfect for drizzling over air-fried dishes."
faqQ4: "What recipes can I make with 160 ml of balsamic vinegar?"
faqA4: "You can use 160 ml of balsamic vinegar in marinades, glazes, dressings, or even reductions. Try it with air-fried chicken, roasted vegetables, or as a drizzle over strawberries. Check our recipe section for more creative ideas."

<h3>How to Measure 360 ml of Buttermilk Without a Measuring Cup</h3>  
<p>Don’t have a measuring cup? No problem! You can use a standard metric measuring jug to measure 360 ml of buttermilk. Alternatively, 360 ml is roughly equivalent to 12 fluid ounces, which can be measured using a liquid ounce marker. For baking, accuracy is crucial, so if you’re in doubt, invest in a good set of measuring tools.</p>  

<h2>Converting 360 ml of Buttermilk for Different Recipes</h2>

For fried chicken, this amount is perfect for marinating, while in baking, it ensures a light and fluffy texture. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipes section</a> for more inspiration on using buttermilk in your air fryer.</p>  

<p>If you’re scaling a recipe up or down, remember that 360 ml of buttermilk equals 1.5 cups. This makes it easy to adjust quantities without compromising on taste or texture. For example, halving a recipe would require 180 ml (0.75 cups) of buttermilk, while doubling would need 720 ml (3 cups).</p>  

<h3>Common Mistakes When Measuring Buttermilk</h3>  
<p>One of the biggest mistakes is using a dry measuring cup for liquids like buttermilk. Always use a liquid measuring cup for accuracy. Another error is not levelling off the measurement, which can lead to using more or less than 360 ml. For best results, pour buttermilk into the cup at eye level to ensure it’s exactly 1.5 cups.</p>  

<h2>Buttermilk Substitutes for Air Fryer Recipes</h2>  
<p>If you’re out of buttermilk, you can make a substitute by adding 1 tablespoon of lemon juice or vinegar to 360 ml (1.5 cups) of regular milk. Let it sit for 5 minutes to thicken. This works well in most air fryer recipes, from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>cakes</a> to marinades. However, for the best flavour, real buttermilk is always preferable.</p>  

<p>Another substitute is plain yoghurt thinned with a bit of water to match the consistency of buttermilk. Use 360 ml (1.5 cups) of this mixture as a 1:1 replacement. While these substitutes work in a pinch, they may slightly alter the taste and texture of your dish.</p>  

<h3>Cleaning Your Air Fryer After Using Buttermilk</h3>

After cooking, wipe down your air fryer basket with warm, soapy water or use a specialised <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner</a> to prevent lingering odours.

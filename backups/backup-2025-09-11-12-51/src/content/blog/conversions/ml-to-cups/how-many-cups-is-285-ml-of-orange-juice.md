faqQ1: "Is 285 ml of orange juice the same as 1 cup?"
faqA1: "No, 285 ml of orange juice is slightly more than 1 cup. In the US, 1 cup equals 240 ml, so 285 ml is approximately 1.2 cups. This small difference can affect recipes, so it's best to measure accurately."
faqQ2: "Can I use bottled orange juice instead of fresh for air fryer recipes?"

faqQ3: "How do I measure 285 ml of orange juice without a measuring jug?"
faqA3: "If you don't have a measuring jug, use a kitchen scale. Orange juice weighs roughly 1 gram per ml, so 285 ml equals about 285 grams. Alternatively, use a standard metric tablespoon (15 ml) and measure out 19 tablespoons for 285 ml."
faqQ4: "What air fryer recipes work well with 285 ml of orange juice?"
faqA4: "285 ml of orange juice is perfect for glazes, marinades, or citrus-based desserts. Try it in an orange-glazed chicken or a moist citrus cake. The acidity also helps tenderise meats, making it great for air-fried pork or salmon."

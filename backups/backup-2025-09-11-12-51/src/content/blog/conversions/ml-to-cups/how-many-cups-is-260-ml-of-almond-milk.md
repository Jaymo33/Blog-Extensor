faqQ1: "Is 260 ml of almond milk the same as 260 ml of regular milk in cups?"
faqA1: "Yes, 260 ml of almond milk and regular milk both equal roughly 1.1 cups in volume. However, almond milk is slightly less dense, so weights may differ slightly. For air fryer recipes, the cup measurement is what matters most."
faqQ2: "Can I use a glass to measure 260 ml of almond milk?"
faqA2: "While a standard UK drinking glass holds about 200-250 ml, it’s not precise enough for baking. For 260 ml of almond milk, use a measuring jug or kitchen scale. Inaccurate measurements can affect air fryer cooking times and textures."
faqQ3: "Why do some recipes list almond milk in ml instead of cups?"
faqA3: "Metric measurements (ml) are more precise, especially in professional recipes or outside the US. For air fryer cooking, millilitres ensure consistency, as cup sizes vary by country. Always follow the recipe’s specified unit for best results."
faqQ4: "How does 260 ml of almond milk affect air fryer cooking times?"
faqA4: "Liquid amounts like 260 ml of almond milk can influence steam and browning in an air fryer. Dishes with more liquid may need slightly longer cooking or lower temperatures. Always check recipes for adjustments when substituting dairy."

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of almond milk can affect texture, moisture, and even cooking time in your air fryer. Too much liquid might make dishes soggy, while too little can dry them out. For example, when making air-fryer pancakes, 260 ml of almond milk (or 1.1 cups) ensures a perfect batter consistency. Explore more <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> to test your measuring skills.</p>  

<p>Almond milk is a popular dairy-free alternative, but its slightly thinner consistency means measurements matter even more. If a recipe calls for 260 ml of almond milk, using a proper measuring cup avoids guesswork. This precision is especially crucial for baked goods like muffins or cakes, where balance is key.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure 260 ml of Almond Milk Without a Measuring Cup</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a measuring jug, you can use a standard metric tablespoon. One tablespoon holds about 15 ml, so 260 ml would be roughly 17 tablespoons. However, for baking, we recommend using a proper measuring cup for accuracy. A kitchen scale can also help—260 ml of almond milk weighs about 260 grams.</p>  

<h2>US vs. UK Cup Measurements for Almond Milk</h2>  
<p>In the UK, 1 cup equals 250 ml, meaning 260 ml of almond milk is just over 1 cup (1.04 cups). In the US, 1 cup is 240 ml, making 260 ml closer to 1.08 cups. This small difference might not matter for some recipes, but for precision baking, it’s worth noting. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert recipes</a> to see how measurements impact results.</p>  

<p>When adapting recipes from US to UK measurements (or vice versa), always double-check the cup size. For air fryer cooking, slight variations can affect how evenly food cooks. If a recipe specifies 260 ml of almond milk, stick to millilitres for the best outcome.</p>  

<h3>Common Recipes Using 260 ml of Almond Milk</h3>  
<p>Many air fryer recipes, like vegan mac and cheese or dairy-free custard, use around 260 ml of almond milk. This amount is ideal for creating creamy textures without overpowering flavours.

<h2>Tips for Storing and Using Almond Milk in Air Fryer Dishes</h2>  
<p>Always shake almond milk before measuring, as it can separate. After opening, store it in the fridge and use within 7 days for best quality. If your recipe calls for 260 ml of almond milk but you only have a larger carton, consider freezing leftovers in ice cube trays for future use.</p>

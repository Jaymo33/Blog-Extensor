faqQ1: "How many US cups is 385 ml of single cream?"
faqA1: "385 ml of single cream is approximately 1.63 US cups. US cups are slightly smaller than UK cups, so the conversion is a bit higher. Always use a liquid measuring cup for accuracy."
faqQ2: "Can I use double cream instead of single cream in a recipe calling for 385 ml?"
faqA2: "Yes, but double cream has a higher fat content, which can affect the texture of your dish. If substituting, you might need to adjust other liquids to balance the richness. For air fryer recipes, stick to single cream unless specified."
faqQ3: "How do I measure 385 ml of single cream without a measuring cup?"
faqA3: "If you don’t have a measuring cup, use a kitchen scale. Single cream weighs roughly 1 gram per ml, so 385 ml equals 385 grams. Alternatively, use a tablespoon (15 ml) to measure out 25 tablespoons and 2 teaspoons."
faqQ4: "What’s the best way to clean my air fryer after using single cream?"
faqA4: "After cooking with single cream, wipe your air fryer basket with a damp cloth and mild detergent. For stubborn residue, use our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner guide</a>. Avoid harsh scrubbing to protect non-stick coatings."

<h2>How to Measure 385 ml of Single Cream</h2>
<p>Measuring liquids like single cream can be tricky, but with the right tools, it’s straightforward. A liquid measuring cup with clear ml and cup markings is ideal. Pour the cream slowly to the 385 ml line, then check the corresponding cup measurement.</p>
<p>If you don’t have a measuring cup, a standard UK metric cup holds 250 ml, so 385 ml would be roughly 1.5 cups plus a tablespoon. For US cups, which are slightly smaller at 240 ml, it’s closer to 1.6 cups. Always double-check for accuracy.</p>

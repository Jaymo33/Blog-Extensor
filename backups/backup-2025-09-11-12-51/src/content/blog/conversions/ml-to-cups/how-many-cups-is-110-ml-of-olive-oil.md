faqQ1: "Is 110 ml of olive oil the same as 110 grams?"
faqA1: "No, 110 ml of olive oil is not the same as 110 grams. Olive oil has a different density than water, so 110 ml weighs approximately 99 grams. Always check your recipe for the correct measurement type."
faqQ2: "Can I use vegetable oil instead of olive oil in my air fryer?"
faqA2: "Yes, you can substitute vegetable oil for olive oil in an air fryer. However, olive oil has a richer flavour and higher smoke point, making it ideal for most air-fried dishes. Use the same volume (110 ml or 0.46 cups) for best results."
faqQ3: "How do I measure 110 ml of olive oil without a measuring jug?"
faqA3: "You can use tablespoons—about 7.3 tablespoons equal 110 ml. Alternatively, a kitchen scale set to grams (99g for olive oil) works well. For accuracy, invest in a measuring jug or cup."
faqQ4: "Why does my air-fried food turn out greasy with 110 ml of olive oil?"
faqA4: "Greasy results usually mean too much oil was used. Even with 110 ml (0.46 cups), lightly coating food is better than drenching it. Try using an oil sprayer for even distribution and crispier outcomes."

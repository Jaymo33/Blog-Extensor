faqQ1: "Can I use 635 ml of apple cider vinegar interchangeably with 2.68 cups in recipes?"
faqA1: "Yes, 635 ml and 2.68 cups are equivalent, so you can use them interchangeably in most recipes. However, for baking or pickling, where precision is key, sticking to one measurement system (metric or imperial) is best to avoid slight discrepancies."
faqQ2: "How do I measure 635 ml of apple cider vinegar if I only have a 1-cup measure?"
faqA2: "Use your 1-cup measure twice (totalling 2 cups), then fill it just over halfway (about 0.68 cups) to reach 635 ml. For better accuracy, consider investing in a measuring jug with millilitre markings or check our conversion chart for quick reference."
faqQ3: "Does apple cider vinegar measurement differ between UK and US recipes?"
faqA3: "Slightly, due to differing cup sizes. A UK cup is 250 ml, while a US cup is 240 ml. For 635 ml, this means 2.68 UK cups vs. 2.65 US cups—a negligible difference in most air fryer recipes but worth noting for exact measurements."
faqQ4: "What’s the best way to store leftover apple cider vinegar after measuring 635 ml?"
faqA4: "Keep it in a cool, dark place in its original bottle or a glass container with a tight seal. Apple cider vinegar stays stable for years, but for best flavour, use it within 6 months. Check our storage tips for more kitchen hacks."

faqQ1: "Is 810 ml of oat milk the same as 810 ml of regular milk in cups?"
faqA1: "Yes, 810 ml of oat milk converts to the same number of cups as regular milk (about 3.42 cups) because their densities are similar. Both are liquid measurements, so the conversion remains consistent for recipes."
faqQ2: "Can I use a kitchen scale to measure 810 ml of oat milk instead of cups?"
faqA2: "While a scale measures weight, not volume, oat milk weighs roughly 1.03 grams per ml. So 810 ml would be about 834 grams. For precision, stick to liquid measuring cups unless your recipe specifies weight."
faqQ3: "Does oat milk behave differently than dairy milk in air fryer recipes?"
faqA3: "Oat milk works similarly in most recipes but may brown faster due to its sugar content. Reduce air fryer temperature by 5-10°C when substituting. It’s perfect for vegan baking—just ensure other ingredients align."
faqQ4: "How should I store leftover oat milk after opening?"
faqA4: "Keep opened oat milk refrigerated and use within 7-10 days. Shake well before each use, as separation is normal. For longer storage, freeze in airtight containers, leaving room for expansion."

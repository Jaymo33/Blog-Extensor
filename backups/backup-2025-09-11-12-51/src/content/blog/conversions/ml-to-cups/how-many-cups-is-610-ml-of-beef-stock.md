faqQ1: "Is 610 ml of beef stock the same in the UK and USA?"
faqA1: "Yes, 610 ml of beef stock is the same volume in both the UK and USA. However, cup sizes can vary slightly between countries. In the UK, a cup is 250 ml, while in the USA, it's 236.59 ml. For precise conversions, always check which standard the recipe uses."
faqQ2: "Can I use beef broth instead of beef stock in my air fryer recipes?"
faqA2: "Yes, you can substitute beef broth for beef stock in most air fryer recipes. The main difference is that broth is typically lighter and saltier, while stock is richer and more flavourful. Adjust seasoning accordingly to avoid over-salting your dish."
faqQ3: "How do I store leftover beef stock after measuring 610 ml?"
faqA3: "Leftover beef stock can be stored in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 4 days. For longer storage, freeze it in ice cube trays or small portions. This makes it easy to thaw just the amount you need for future air fryer recipes."
faqQ4: "Why is my air fryer recipe too watery when using 610 ml of beef stock?"
faqA4: "If your dish is too watery, you may need to reduce the liquid or increase cooking time. Air fryers circulate hot air, which can evaporate liquids faster than conventional ovens. Start with slightly less stock and adjust as needed to achieve the desired consistency."

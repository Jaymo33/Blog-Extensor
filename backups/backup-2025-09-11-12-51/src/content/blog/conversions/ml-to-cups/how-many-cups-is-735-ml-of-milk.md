faqA1: "735 ml of milk is slightly more than 3 cups—approximately 3.1 cups in both UK and US measurements. The small difference usually doesn’t affect most recipes, but for baking, it’s best to measure precisely."
faqQ2: "Can I use 735 ml of milk in an air fryer recipe?"

<p>735 ml of milk is approximately 3.1 cups in the UK or 3.1 cups in the US, as both countries use a similar standard cup measurement for liquids. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes, where precise measurements can make or break your dish. Whether you're whipping up a cake or a creamy sauce, knowing how to convert millilitres to cups ensures consistency.

<h2>Why Accurate Milk Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Getting the right amount of milk is crucial for recipes, especially in air fryer cooking where ingredients cook faster. Too much milk can make batters runny, while too little can dry out your dish. For example, a classic <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>air fryer cake</a> relies on precise liquid ratios for the perfect rise. Measuring 735 ml of milk correctly ensures your recipes turn out just as intended. Always use a liquid measuring jug for accuracy, as dry cups can lead to inconsistencies.</p>  

<p>If you're working with frozen ingredients, like those in our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/frozen-foods>frozen foods section</a>, milk measurements become even more important. Thawing can affect volume, so sticking to 735 ml (or 3.1 cups) guarantees your recipe stays balanced. This is especially handy for creamy dishes like mac and cheese or custards.</p>  

<h2>UK vs. US Cup Measurements</h2>  
<p>While 735 ml of milk equals roughly 3.1 cups in both the UK and US, it's worth noting slight differences in cup sizes. The UK uses a metric cup (250 ml), while the US uses a customary cup (240 ml). For most recipes, this small discrepancy won’t make a noticeable difference. However, for precision baking—like our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cookies>air fryer cookies</a>—it’s best to stick to one system.</p>  

<h3>Converting 735 ml of Milk for Baking</h3>  
<p>When converting 735 ml of milk for baking, always level off your measuring cup to avoid excess. Air fryer recipes, such as pancakes or muffins, often need exact liquid ratios for the best texture. If you’re scaling a recipe up or down, remember that 735 ml is just over 3 cups, making it easy to adjust.

<h2>Common Uses for 735 ml of Milk</h2>

<h3>Tips for Measuring Milk Without a Jug</h3>  
<p>No measuring jug? No problem. A standard mug holds about 250 ml, so 735 ml of milk is roughly 3 mugs minus a tablespoon. Alternatively, use a kitchen scale—1 ml of milk weighs roughly 1 gram, so 735 ml equals 735 grams. This method is especially handy for air fryer recipes where precision matters.

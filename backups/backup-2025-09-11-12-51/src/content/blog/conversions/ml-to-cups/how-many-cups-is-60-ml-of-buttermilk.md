faqQ1: "Can I use 60 ml of buttermilk in place of regular milk in recipes?"
faqA1: "Yes, you can substitute 60 ml of buttermilk for regular milk, but keep in mind it will add a tangy flavour and acidity. This works well in baked goods like cakes and pancakes, where buttermilk enhances texture. For savoury dishes, adjust seasoning to balance the flavour."
faqQ2: "How do I measure 60 ml of buttermilk without a measuring cup?"
faqA2: "If you don't have a measuring cup, use a tablespoon—60 ml equals 4 tablespoons. Alternatively, a standard shot glass holds about 45 ml, so fill it slightly more than halfway. For precision, a kitchen scale set to 61 grams will also give you the right amount."
faqQ3: "Does 60 ml of buttermilk work for air fryer fried chicken?"
faqA3: "Absolutely! 60 ml of buttermilk is perfect for marinating one or two chicken pieces in the air fryer. It tenderises the meat and helps the coating stick. For larger batches, scale up the buttermilk proportionally to ensure even coverage."
faqQ4: "Can I freeze 60 ml portions of buttermilk for later use?"
faqA4: "Yes, freezing buttermilk in 60 ml portions is a great way to reduce waste. Pour it into ice cube trays or small containers, then thaw in the fridge when needed. Stir well before using, as separation may occur. Frozen buttermilk works best in cooked or baked dishes."

<h2>Why Accurate Buttermilk Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of buttermilk can make or break a recipe. Too little, and your baked goods might turn out dry; too much, and they could become soggy. For air fryer recipes, precision is key because the cooking environment is more concentrated than a conventional oven. A slight variation in liquid measurements can affect texture and cooking time.</p>  
<p>Buttermilk adds tanginess and moisture to dishes, making it a staple in many recipes. If you're following a recipe from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, you'll often find buttermilk used in everything from fried chicken to fluffy cakes. Measuring 60 ml of buttermilk correctly ensures consistency, whether you're cooking for one or meal prepping for the week.</p>

<h3>Measuring Buttermilk for Air Fryer Recipes</h3>  
<p>When using buttermilk in air fryer recipes, accuracy is crucial. For example, if you're making buttermilk fried chicken, the marinade needs the right consistency to coat the chicken evenly.

<h2>Common Uses for 60 ml of Buttermilk</h2>

<h3>Tips for Storing Buttermilk</h3>  
<p>If you don't use all your buttermilk at once, store it in an airtight container in the fridge for up to two weeks. You can also freeze buttermilk in ice cube trays for smaller portions—each cube is roughly 30 ml, so two cubes equal 60 ml. This makes it easy to measure out the exact amount you need for future recipes.</p>  

<h2>Substitutes for Buttermilk</h2>  
<p>If you're out of buttermilk, you can make a quick substitute by adding 1 tablespoon of lemon juice or vinegar to 60 ml of milk. Let it sit for 5 minutes to thicken before using. This works well in most recipes, though the flavour might be slightly different. For best results, stick to real buttermilk when possible.</p>  
<p>Another option is using plain yoghurt thinned with a little water to match the consistency of buttermilk. This substitute works particularly well in baked goods and marinades.

faqQ1: "Is 535 ml of lime juice the same as 2 cups?"
faqA1: "Not quite. 535 ml equals approximately 2.26 cups, so it's slightly more than 2 cups. This small difference can matter in recipes where acidity balance is crucial, like ceviche or citrus marinades for air fryer cooking."
faqQ2: "How many limes do I need for 535 ml of juice?"
faqA2: "You'll need about 12-18 limes, depending on their size and juiciness. Large, ripe limes yield more juice - up to 45 ml each. For consistent results in air fryer recipes, it's best to measure the juice rather than count limes."
faqQ3: "Can I use bottled lime juice instead of fresh for air fryer recipes?"
faqA3: "While fresh lime juice is preferred for its bright flavour, bottled lime juice works in a pinch for air fryer recipes. Just remember that bottled juice often has preservatives that can slightly alter the taste. Use the same 535 ml (2.26 cups) measurement unless the recipe specifies otherwise."
faqQ4: "How long will 535 ml of freshly squeezed lime juice last in the fridge?"
faqA4: "Freshly squeezed lime juice lasts about 5-7 days in an airtight container in the fridge. For longer storage, freeze it in portions. This makes it easy to grab just what you need for future air fryer recipes without waste."

<p>535 ml of lime juice equals approximately 2.26 cups. Whether you're whipping up a zesty marinade for chicken or a tangy glaze for salmon in your air fryer, knowing this conversion ensures your recipe turns out perfectly every time. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we love making cooking conversions simple, so you can focus on creating delicious meals without the guesswork.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Lime Juice Measurements Matter</h2>
<p>Using the right amount of lime juice can make or break a dish. Too little, and your marinade lacks punch; too much, and it overpowers other flavours. For air fryer recipes like citrus-glazed shrimp or lime-infused vegetables, precision is key. A handy <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a> can save time and ensure consistency across all your cooking.</p>
<p>Lime juice is a staple in many cuisines, from Thai curries to Mexican tacos. When adapting these dishes for your air fryer, getting the 535 ml to cups conversion right ensures authentic flavours. Whether you're meal prepping or cooking for a crowd, accurate measurements lead to reliable results every time.</p>

<h2>How to Measure 535 ml of Lime Juice Without a Measuring Cup</h2>
<p>No measuring cup? No problem. If you need to convert 535 ml of lime juice to cups but lack the right tools, there are easy workarounds. A standard UK mug holds about 284 ml, so roughly two mugs minus a tablespoon will give you close to 535 ml. For more precise air fryer recipes, investing in a digital scale or jug is worthwhile.</p>
<p>Another trick is using lime count as a guide. On average, one lime yields 30-45 ml of juice. So 535 ml would require 12-18 limes, depending on size and juiciness. For consistent results in dishes like our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>lime chicken recipes</a>, measuring properly is always best.</p>

<h3>US vs UK Cup Measurements</h3>
<p>It's important to note that US and UK cup measurements differ slightly. A US cup is 240 ml, while a UK cup is 250 ml. For 535 ml of lime juice, that's 2.23 US cups or 2.14 UK cups. When following air fryer recipes from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>our collection</a>, always check which measurement system the recipe uses to avoid discrepancies.</p>

<h2>Common Uses for 535 ml of Lime Juice in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>
<p>This quantity of lime juice is perfect for batch cooking or family meals. You might use it in a large batch of citrus-marinated tofu, enough for several meals. Or perhaps a zesty glaze for a whole salmon fillet cooked in your air fryer. The possibilities are endless when you have the right measurements at your fingertips.</p>
<p>For those who love meal prep, 535 ml of lime juice could be divided into portions for weekly marinades. Try our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipe collection</a> for inspiration on using this quantity effectively.

<h3>Storing Leftover Lime Juice</h3>
<p>If your recipe doesn't use all 535 ml (2.26 cups) of lime juice, proper storage is key. Pour leftovers into an airtight container and refrigerate for up to a week. For longer storage, freeze in ice cube trays - each cube is about 30 ml, making future measurements a breeze for quick air fryer meals.</p>

For perfect results every time, measure carefully and adjust other ingredients proportionally when changing recipe sizes for your air fryer.</p>

faqQ1: "Is 360 ml of lime juice the same as 1.5 cups?"
faqA1: "No, 360 ml of lime juice is approximately 1.52 cups. While 1.5 cups is close, the exact conversion is 1.52 cups for precision in recipes. This small difference can matter in baking or marinades where acidity and moisture balance are key."
faqQ2: "Can I use bottled lime juice instead of fresh for 360 ml?"
faqA2: "Yes, bottled lime juice can substitute fresh, but check the label for added preservatives or water, which may dilute flavour. For best results, fresh lime juice is recommended, especially in dishes where zest and acidity are prominent, like ceviche or desserts."
faqQ3: "How do I measure 360 ml of lime juice without a measuring cup?"
faqA3: "If you don’t have a measuring cup, use a kitchen scale. Lime juice weighs roughly 1 gram per millilitre, so 360 ml equals 360 grams. Alternatively, a standard UK tablespoon holds 15 ml, meaning 24 tablespoons equal 360 ml."
faqQ4: "Does 360 ml of lime juice conversion differ between US and UK cups?"
faqA4: "No, 1 US cup and 1 UK cup both equal 236.59 ml, so 360 ml converts to 1.52 cups in both systems. However, always double-check recipe origins, as some older UK recipes may use imperial cups (284 ml), which would slightly alter the conversion."

<p>360 ml of lime juice is approximately 1.52 cups. This conversion is essential for recipes requiring precise measurements, especially when using an air fryer. Whether you're making marinades, dressings, or desserts, knowing how to convert millilitres to cups ensures consistent results.

<h2>Why Accurate Lime Juice Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of lime juice can make or break a dish. Too little, and your recipe lacks zest; too much, and it becomes overpowering. For air fryer recipes, precise measurements ensure even cooking and balanced flavours. Whether you're making <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>lime-marinated chicken</a> or a tangy dessert, 360 ml of lime juice translates to roughly 1.52 cups.</p>  

<p>Different countries use varying measurement systems, which can be confusing. In the UK, millilitres are standard, while the US often relies on cups. If you're following a recipe from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, knowing these conversions helps avoid mistakes. A slight miscalculation could alter the acidity or moisture content of your dish.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure 360 ml of Lime Juice</h3>  
<p>To measure 360 ml of lime juice accurately, use a liquid measuring cup with millilitre markings. If your cup only has imperial units, remember that 1 cup equals 236.59 ml. For 360 ml, you’ll need just over 1.5 cups. Freshly squeezed lime juice is best, but bottled works too—just check for additives that might affect flavour.</p>  

<h2>Converting 360 ml of Lime Juice for Baking</h2>  
<p>Baking requires precision, and lime juice is no exception. Whether you're making a <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>key lime pie</a> or citrus-infused cookies, 360 ml of lime juice equals 1.52 cups. This measurement ensures your batter or filling has the right consistency and taste. Always level off your measuring cup for accuracy.</p>

<h3>Using 360 ml of Lime Juice in Marinades</h3>  
<p>Marinades often call for lime juice to tenderise and flavour meats. For 360 ml of lime juice, use 1.52 cups to ensure even coating. This works perfectly for <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/shrimp>shrimp skewers</a> or chicken wings in the air fryer. The acidity helps break down proteins while adding a refreshing tang.</p>  

<h2>Common Mistakes When Measuring Lime Juice</h2>  
<p>One frequent error is confusing fluid ounces with millilitres, leading to incorrect measurements. Another is using dry measuring cups for liquids, which can cause spills or inaccuracies. Always use a jug with clear millilitre markings for 360 ml of lime juice. For sticky liquids like lime juice, lightly grease the cup for easier pouring.</p>  

<p>Bottled lime juice may differ in concentration from fresh, so adjust accordingly. If a recipe specifies fresh lime juice, stick to it for the best results. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we recommend fresh ingredients whenever possible for optimal flavour and texture in air fryer meals.</p>

faqQ1: "Is 210 ml of single cream the same as 1 cup?"
faqA1: "No, 210 ml of single cream is approximately 0.89 cups. A standard US cup is 240 ml, so 210 ml is slightly less. Always measure carefully for accurate results in recipes."
faqQ2: "Can I use double cream instead of single cream in a 210 ml measurement?"
faqA2: "Yes, but double cream has a higher fat content, which may affect texture. Use the same 210 ml (0.89 cups) measurement, but expect a richer, thicker result. Adjust cooking times if using an air fryer."
faqQ3: "How do I measure 210 ml of single cream without a measuring cup?"
faqA3: "A kitchen scale is the best alternative—210 ml of single cream weighs about 210 grams. Alternatively, use a tablespoon (15 ml) to measure out 14 tablespoons for a close approximation."
faqQ4: "Why does my air fryer recipe call for 210 ml of single cream?"
faqA4: "Single cream adds moisture and richness to air fryer dishes, helping to prevent dryness. The 210 ml measurement ensures balanced flavour and texture, especially in baked goods or creamy sauces."

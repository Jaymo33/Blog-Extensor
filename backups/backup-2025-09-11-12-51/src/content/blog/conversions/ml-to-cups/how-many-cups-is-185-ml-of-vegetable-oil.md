faqQ1: "Is 185 ml of vegetable oil the same as 185 grams?"
faqA1: "No, 185 ml of vegetable oil is not the same as 185 grams. Oil is less dense than water, so 185 ml of vegetable oil weighs approximately 170 grams. Always check your recipe for the correct measurement type."
faqQ2: "Can I use olive oil instead of vegetable oil in air fryer recipes?"
faqA2: "Yes, you can substitute olive oil for vegetable oil in air fryer recipes. However, olive oil has a lower smoke point, so reduce the temperature slightly to avoid burning. The conversion remains the same: 185 ml equals 0.78 cups."
faqQ3: "How do I measure 185 ml of vegetable oil without a measuring cup?"
faqA3: "Use a tablespoon to measure 185 ml of vegetable oil. There are roughly 15 ml in one tablespoon, so you’d need about 12.3 tablespoons. Alternatively, a standard mug holds around 250 ml, so fill it three-quarters full."
faqQ4: "Why do some recipes use ml and others use cups for oil measurements?"
faqA4: "Recipes may use ml or cups depending on regional preferences. Metric measurements (ml) are common in the UK, while cups are more popular in the US. Always convert carefully to ensure accuracy, especially in air fryer cooking."

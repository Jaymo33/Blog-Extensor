faqQ1: "Is 860 ml of lime juice the same as 860 grams?"
faqA1: "No, 860 ml of lime juice is not exactly the same as 860 grams. Lime juice has a density of about 1.04 grams per ml, so 860 ml would weigh approximately 894 grams. This slight difference matters in baking where precision is key."
faqQ2: "Can I use bottled lime juice instead of fresh for measurements?"
faqA2: "Yes, bottled lime juice can be used, but it may have a slightly different acidity and flavour profile compared to fresh. For consistent results in recipes, stick to one type. Bottled juice often has a longer shelf life, making it convenient for frequent use."
faqQ3: "How do I measure 860 ml of lime juice without a measuring cup?"
faqA3: "If you don’t have a measuring cup, use a kitchen scale. Since lime juice weighs about 1.04 grams per ml, 860 ml would be roughly 894 grams. Alternatively, use a standard drinking glass (usually 250 ml) and measure 3.44 glasses for UK cups or 3.63 for US cups."
faqQ4: "What recipes can I make with 860 ml of lime juice?"
faqA4: "860 ml of lime juice is perfect for large batches of marinades, dressings, or desserts. Try it in air fryer recipes like citrus-glazed chicken, lime-infused shrimp, or even homemade lime sorbet.

<h2>Why Accurate Lime Juice Measurements Matter</h2>
<p>Precision is key when working with lime juice, as too much or too little can drastically alter the flavour of your dish.

<h2>Understanding the Conversion</h2>  
<p>Converting millilitres to cups can be tricky, especially when precision matters. For 310 ml of orange juice, the exact measurement is about 1.31 cups.

<p>Different countries use varying cup sizes, which can affect your recipe. In the UK, a standard metric cup holds 250 ml, while in the US, it's 240 ml. For 310 ml of orange juice, this means roughly 1.24 UK cups or 1.31 US cups. Always check your recipe's origin to avoid confusion.

<p>Air fryers rely on even heat distribution, so precise measurements prevent soggy or unevenly cooked food. Too much liquid, like orange juice, can steam rather than crisp your dish. Measuring 310 ml correctly ensures your marinades or glazes don’t overpower the texture.

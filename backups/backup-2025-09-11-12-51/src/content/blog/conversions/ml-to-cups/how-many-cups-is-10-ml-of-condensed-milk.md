faqQ1: "Can I use evaporated milk instead of condensed milk for 10 ml measurements?"
faqA1: "No, evaporated milk and condensed milk aren’t interchangeable. Condensed milk is sweetened and thicker, so substituting it with evaporated milk (unsweetened) will alter the taste and texture of your dish. Stick to condensed milk for recipes calling for 10 ml unless specified otherwise."
faqQ2: "How do I measure 10 ml of condensed milk if I don’t have measuring spoons?"
faqA2: "You can use a standard teaspoon (5 ml) and measure two level teaspoons for 10 ml. Alternatively, a medicine syringe or small shot glass with ml markings works well. For sticky ingredients like condensed milk, lightly grease the spoon for easier pouring."
faqQ3: "Does 10 ml of condensed milk weigh the same as 10 ml of water?"
faqA3: "No, condensed milk is denser due to its sugar content. While 10 ml of water weighs 10 grams, 10 ml of condensed milk weighs about 12–13 grams. Always measure by volume (ml or cups) for accuracy in recipes."
faqQ4: "Can I freeze leftover condensed milk after measuring out 10 ml?"
faqA4: "Yes, but store it in an airtight container for up to 3 months. Thaw in the fridge before use, and stir well to restore consistency. For small amounts like 10 ml, consider portioning it into ice cube trays for easy future use."

<p>10 ml of condensed milk is roughly equal to 0.042 cups. This small but precise measurement is crucial for air fryer recipes where accuracy can make or break your dish. Whether you're whipping up a dessert or adding a touch of sweetness to a savoury meal, knowing how to convert 10 ml of condensed milk to cups ensures perfect results every time.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on precise cooking times and ingredient ratios to deliver crispy, evenly cooked dishes. Using too much or too little condensed milk can affect texture and flavour, especially in baked goods like cakes or cookies. For example, adding even slightly more than 10 ml of condensed milk could make your dessert overly sweet or alter its consistency. That’s why conversions like 10 ml to cups are essential for air fryer enthusiasts.</p>

<h3>How to Measure 10 ml of Condensed Milk Without a Scale</h3>  
<p>Not everyone has a kitchen scale or measuring jug handy, but you can still measure 10 ml of condensed milk accurately. A standard teaspoon holds about 5 ml, so two level teaspoons will give you roughly 10 ml. Alternatively, use a tablespoon (15 ml) and fill it two-thirds of the way. For more precise baking, consider investing in a set of measuring spoons or a small liquid measuring cup.</p>  

<h2>Common Recipes Using 10 ml of Condensed Milk</h2>

<h3>UK vs. US Cup Measurements</h3>  
<p>It’s worth noting that UK and US cup measurements differ slightly. In the UK, 1 cup is 284 ml, while in the US, it’s 240 ml. However, for small quantities like 10 ml of condensed milk, the difference is negligible (0.042 UK cups vs. 0.042 US cups). For larger amounts, always double-check which standard your recipe follows.</p>  

<h2>Tips for Working with Condensed Milk in an Air Fryer</h2>  
<p>Condensed milk can thicken or caramelise quickly in an air fryer’s high heat. To prevent burning, mix it with other liquids (like milk or water) if using it as a glaze. For sticky residues, clean your air fryer basket promptly with our recommended <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner</a> to maintain its non-stick surface.</p>  
<p>If you're experimenting with condensed milk in air fryer desserts, start with small amounts like 10 ml and adjust to taste. Its intense sweetness means a little goes a long way, especially in recipes where balance is key.</p>

faqQ1: "Is 860 ml of half and half the same in US and UK cups?"
faqA1: "No, 860 ml of half and half is approximately 3.63 cups in US measurements and 3.02 cups in UK measurements. The difference arises because US cups are 240 ml, while UK cups are 284 ml. Always check which measurement system your recipe uses."
faqQ2: "Can I use milk instead of half and half in air fryer recipes?"
faqA2: "You can substitute milk for half and half, but the texture and richness of your dish may change. Half and half adds creaminess, so using milk might result in a lighter consistency. For best results, stick to the recipe or adjust other ingredients accordingly."
faqQ3: "How do I measure 860 ml of half and half without a measuring cup?"
faqA3: "If you don’t have a measuring cup, use a kitchen scale. 860 ml of half and half weighs about 880 grams. Alternatively, you can use a standard drinking glass, but this method is less accurate. For precise measurements, invest in a liquid measuring cup."
faqQ4: "Why is my air fryer dish too watery when using half and half?"
faqA4: "If your dish is too watery, you may have added too much half and half or not cooked it long enough. Air fryers require precise liquid measurements to avoid steaming. Always measure 860 ml of half and half accurately and adjust cooking times as needed."

<h2>Understanding Half And Half Measurements</h2>  
<p>Half and half is a dairy product made by combining equal parts whole milk and cream. It’s commonly used in recipes to add richness without being as heavy as pure cream. When converting 860 ml of half and half to cups, it’s important to note whether you’re using US or UK measurements. In the US, 1 cup equals 240 ml, while in the UK, 1 cup is 284 ml. This difference can affect your recipe, so always double-check which measurement system you’re using.</p>

faqQ1: "Is 710 ml of milk exactly 3 cups?"
faqA1: "710 ml of milk is approximately 3 cups, but not exactly. In the US, it's about 2.96 cups, and in the UK, it's roughly 2.84 cups. For most recipes, rounding to 3 cups works fine, but for precision baking, slight adjustments may be needed."
faqQ2: "Can I use 710 ml of milk in an air fryer recipe?"
faqA2: "Absolutely! 710 ml of milk (or 3 cups) works well in air fryer recipes like cakes, custards, or sauces. Just ensure your ingredients are well-mixed and the air fryer isn’t overcrowded. Proper measurements help maintain texture and cooking time."
faqQ3: "How do I convert 710 ml of milk to cups without a measuring cup?"
faqA3: "If you don’t have a measuring cup, use a kitchen scale. Milk weighs roughly 1 gram per ml, so 710 ml equals 710 grams. Alternatively, a standard mug holds about 250 ml, so 710 ml would be just under 3 mugfuls."
faqQ4: "Does the type of milk affect the 710 ml to cups conversion?"
faqA4: "No, the type of milk (whole, skim, or plant-based) doesn’t change the volume conversion. 710 ml of any milk will still be roughly 3 cups. However, density differences in plant-based milks might slightly alter recipes, so adjust other ingredients if needed."

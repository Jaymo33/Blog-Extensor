faqQ1: "Is 360 ml of coconut oil the same as 1.5 cups?"
faqA1: "Yes, 360 ml of coconut oil is approximately 1.5 cups in the US measurement system (where 1 cup = 240 ml). In the UK, 1 cup equals 250 ml, so 360 ml is roughly 1.44 cups. For air fryer recipes, this small difference usually doesn’t affect the outcome."
faqQ2: "Can I use solidified coconut oil to measure 360 ml?"
faqA2: "It’s best to melt coconut oil slightly before measuring 360 ml for accuracy. Solidified oil can leave gaps in measuring cups, leading to inconsistent amounts. Gently warm the oil until it’s pourable, then measure for perfect results in air fryer recipes."

faqA3: "360 ml (1.52 cups) of coconut oil provides enough fat to prevent sticking and enhance crispiness without greasiness. It’s ideal for coating vegetables, marinating proteins, or baking. Too much oil can cause smoke, so measure carefully for balanced air fryer dishes."
faqQ4: "What’s the best way to convert 360 ml of coconut oil for baking?"
faqA4: "For baking, use 360 ml (1.52 cups) of melted coconut oil to ensure even distribution in batters. This amount works well for air fryer cakes or cookies. If your recipe calls for solid oil, measure first, then melt it to avoid inaccuracies."

faqQ1: "Is 260 ml of water the same as 1 cup?"
faqA1: "No, 260 ml of water is slightly more than 1 cup. A standard US cup is 240 ml, while a UK cup is 250 ml. So, 260 ml equals roughly 1.08 US cups or 1.04 UK cups."
faqQ2: "Can I use a mug to measure 260 ml of water?"
faqA2: "Mugs vary in size, so they’re not reliable for precise measurements. For accuracy, use a measuring jug or kitchen scale. If you must use a mug, check its capacity first—many hold around 300 ml, which is more than 260 ml."
faqQ3: "Does 260 ml of water weigh the same in grams?"
faqA3: "Yes, water has a 1:1 ratio of ml to grams. So, 260 ml of water weighs exactly 260 grams. This makes it easy to measure using a kitchen scale if you don’t have a measuring cup."
faqQ4: "Why do some recipes use ml instead of cups?"
faqA4: "Millilitres provide more precision, especially in baking. Cups can vary between countries, but ml is a universal metric measurement. Recipes from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> often use ml for consistency."

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Using the correct amount of water in air fryer recipes ensures even cooking and perfect texture. Too much liquid can make food soggy, while too little may dry it out. Many air fryer recipes, like those for <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>cakes</a> or <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetables</a>, rely on precise water measurements. Measuring 260 ml of water correctly helps maintain consistency, especially when scaling recipes up or down. Always use a measuring jug or cups for accuracy.</p>  

<p>Air fryers circulate hot air, so moisture levels are crucial. A slight variation in water quantity can alter cooking times significantly. For example, 260 ml of water in a batter versus 250 ml can change how a cake rises. If you're unsure, refer to trusted sources like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> for reliable conversions and tips.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure 260 ml of Water Without a Measuring Cup</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a measuring cup, you can use tablespoons or a kitchen scale. One cup is roughly 240 ml, so 260 ml is just over a cup. Alternatively, 17.6 tablespoons equal 260 ml. A kitchen scale set to grams can also help—water weighs 1 gram per ml, so 260 grams equals 260 ml.

<h2>Difference Between UK and US Cup Measurements</h2>  
<p>In the UK, a standard cup measures 250 ml, while in the US, it’s 240 ml. This means 260 ml of water is 1.04 UK cups or 1.08 US cups. The slight difference may not matter for some recipes, but for baking, precision is key. Always check whether your recipe uses UK or US measurements to avoid errors.</p>  

<p>For air fryer recipes, especially those involving batters or sauces, sticking to one measurement system helps. If a recipe calls for 260 ml of water, confirm if it’s based on UK or US cups. Many recipes on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> specify the measurement system, ensuring foolproof results every time.</p>  

<h3>Common Recipes Using 260 ml of Water</h3>  
<p>Many air fryer recipes, like pancake batter or steamed puddings, use around 260 ml of water. This quantity is also common in soups and broths. For example, a light vegetable broth might require 260 ml of water to balance flavours. If you're making a marinade, precise water measurements ensure the right consistency.</p>  

<h2>Tips for Measuring Water in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Always use clear measuring cups with ml and cup markings for accuracy. Pour water at eye level to avoid over or under-measuring. For sticky batters, lightly grease the cup to help the mixture slide out easily. If scaling a recipe, adjust all ingredients proportionally—260 ml of water might need tweaking based on serving size.</p>

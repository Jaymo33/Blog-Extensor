faqQ1: "Can I use double cream instead of single cream in recipes?"
faqA1: "Yes, but double cream has a higher fat content, which can make dishes richer and thicker. If substituting, you may need to adjust the quantity slightly or dilute it with a bit of milk to match the consistency of single cream."
faqQ2: "How do I measure 310 ml of single cream without a measuring jug?"
faqA2: "If you don’t have a measuring jug, use a standard metric cup (250 ml) and add an extra tablespoon to reach 310 ml. For US cups, measure 1 and 1/3 cups, as they hold 240 ml each."
faqQ3: "Does single cream whip well for desserts?"
faqA3: "Single cream doesn’t whip as well as double cream, but it can be lightly aerated for toppings. For stiffer peaks, consider using double cream or a stabiliser like gelatine."
faqQ4: "Can I freeze single cream for later use?"
faqA4: "Freezing single cream isn’t recommended, as it can separate and become grainy when thawed. It’s best used fresh within a few days of opening for optimal texture and flavour."

faqA1: "No, there's a slight difference. In the UK, 335 ml of beef stock equals about 1.42 cups, while in the US, it's approximately 1.41 cups. Always check which measurement system your recipe uses for the best results."
faqQ2: "Can I use a regular cup to measure 335 ml of beef stock?"

Whether you're preparing a rich gravy or a hearty stew, knowing how much beef stock to use ensures consistent results every time.</p>  

<h2>Understanding the Conversion</h2>  
<p>Converting millilitres to cups can be tricky, as cup sizes vary between the UK and the US. In the UK, 1 cup equals 284 ml, while in the US, it's 237 ml. For 335 ml of beef stock, this means roughly 1.42 UK cups or 1.41 US cups. This small difference might not seem significant, but for recipes requiring precision, it matters.</p>

<h2>Practical Tips for Measuring Beef Stock</h2>  
<p>Measuring liquids like beef stock can be messy if you're not careful. Use a clear measuring jug with millilitre and cup markings for accuracy. If you don't have one, a standard UK or US measuring cup will do, but remember the slight variation in sizes.</p>

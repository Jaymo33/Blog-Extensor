faqQ1: "Is 285 ml of soy sauce the same in US and UK cups?"
faqA1: "No, US and UK cups differ slightly. A US cup is 240 ml, while a UK cup is 250 ml. This means 285 ml of soy sauce equals about 1.2 US cups or 1.14 UK cups. Always check your recipe’s origin for the most accurate conversion."
faqQ2: "Can I use light and dark soy sauce interchangeably in a 285 ml measurement?"
faqA2: "Light and dark soy sauce have different intensities, so swapping them 1:1 isn’t ideal. Dark soy sauce is thicker and saltier, so if your recipe calls for 285 ml of light soy sauce, reduce the amount slightly if using dark. Adjust to taste for the best results."
faqQ3: "How long does 285 ml of soy sauce last once opened?"
faqA3: "An opened bottle of soy sauce stays fresh for about 1–2 years if stored in a cool, dark place. However, for optimal flavour in air fryer recipes, use it within 6 months. Always check for changes in colour or smell before use."
faqQ4: "What’s the best way to measure 285 ml of soy sauce for air fryer marinades?"
faqA4: "For precise measurements, use a liquid measuring cup with clear ml markings. If you’re scaling a recipe, a kitchen scale set to grams (285 ml ≈ 300g) can also work. For sticky sauces like soy, lightly grease the measuring cup for easier pouring."

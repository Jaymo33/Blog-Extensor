faqQ1: "Is 310 ml of vegetable oil the same as 310 grams?"
faqA1: "No, 310 ml of vegetable oil is not the same as 310 grams. Millilitres measure volume, while grams measure weight. The weight of 310 ml of vegetable oil depends on its density but is roughly 285 grams. Always use a kitchen scale for weight measurements."
faqQ2: "Can I use less than 310 ml of vegetable oil in my air fryer?"
faqA2: "Yes, air fryers require less oil than traditional frying. You can often reduce 310 ml of vegetable oil by half or use a spray bottle for even coating. Experiment with smaller amounts to achieve crispiness without excess grease."
faqQ3: "How do I convert 310 ml of vegetable oil to tablespoons?"
faqA3: "310 ml of vegetable oil equals about 15.5 tablespoons (since 1 tablespoon is roughly 20 ml). This conversion is handy for recipes requiring smaller oil quantities, such as marinades or dressings."
faqQ4: "Does the type of vegetable oil affect the 310 ml to cups conversion?"
faqA4: "No, the conversion remains the same (1.31 cups) regardless of the vegetable oil type. However, oils with different viscosities (like olive oil vs. sunflower oil) may pour differently, so always measure at eye level for accuracy."

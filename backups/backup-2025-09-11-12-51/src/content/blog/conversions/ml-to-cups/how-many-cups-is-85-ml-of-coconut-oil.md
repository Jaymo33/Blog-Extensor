faqQ1: "Is 85 ml of coconut oil the same as 85 grams?"
faqA1: "No, 85 ml of coconut oil is not the same as 85 grams. The density of coconut oil means 85 ml weighs approximately 78 grams. Always check your recipe for the correct measurement type (ml or grams) to ensure accuracy."
faqQ2: "Can I use a US cup to measure 85 ml of coconut oil?"
faqA2: "Yes, but note that US cups (240 ml) differ slightly from UK cups (250 ml). For 85 ml of coconut oil, the conversion is roughly 0.36 US cups. If precision matters, use a kitchen scale or ml markings on a measuring jug."
faqQ3: "How do I measure 85 ml of coconut oil if I don’t have a measuring cup?"
faqA3: "Use tablespoons—one tablespoon holds about 15 ml, so 85 ml equals roughly 5.5 tablespoons. For solid coconut oil, level off each spoonful for accuracy."
faqQ4: "Does the type of coconut oil (refined vs. unrefined) affect the 85 ml to cups conversion?"
faqA4: "No, the conversion remains the same (0.36 cups per 85 ml) regardless of refinement. However, refined coconut oil has a higher smoke point, making it better for high-heat air frying."

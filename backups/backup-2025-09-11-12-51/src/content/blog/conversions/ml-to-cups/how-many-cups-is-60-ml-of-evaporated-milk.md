faqQ1: "Can I use regular milk instead of evaporated milk in recipes?"
faqA1: "Yes, but you’ll need to adjust the quantity. Regular milk is thinner, so use 1.25 times the amount of evaporated milk called for. For example, if a recipe needs 60 ml of evaporated milk, use 75 ml of regular milk."
faqQ2: "Does 60 ml of evaporated milk weigh the same as water?"
faqA2: "No, evaporated milk is denser than water. While 60 ml of water weighs 60 grams, evaporated milk weighs around 75 grams due to its reduced water content. Always measure by volume for accuracy."
faqQ3: "How long does opened evaporated milk last in the fridge?"
faqA3: "Once opened, evaporated milk stays fresh for about 3–5 days if stored in an airtight container. For best results, label it with the date you opened it and use it quickly in recipes."
faqQ4: "Can I freeze evaporated milk?"
faqA4: "Yes, but the texture may change slightly. Thaw it in the fridge and stir well before using. It’s best for cooked dishes rather than drinks or uncooked recipes. Freeze in small portions for convenience."

faqQ1: "Is 260 ml of lime juice the same as 260 grams?"
faqA1: "No, 260 ml of lime juice is not the same as 260 grams. While ml measures volume, grams measure weight. The weight of lime juice can vary slightly depending on its density, but generally, 260 ml of lime juice weighs around 260-270 grams due to its water content."
faqQ2: "Can I use bottled lime juice instead of fresh for 260 ml?"
faqA2: "Yes, you can use bottled lime juice as a substitute for fresh lime juice when measuring 260 ml. Just ensure it’s 100% lime juice without added sweeteners or preservatives, as these can alter the flavour of your dish. Fresh lime juice has a brighter taste, but bottled works well in a pinch."
faqQ3: "How many limes do I need to make 260 ml of juice?"
faqA3: "You’ll need about 6-8 medium limes to yield 260 ml of juice, as one lime typically provides 30-45 ml. Roll the limes on a countertop before juicing to maximise yield. If you’re juicing in bulk, a citrus press can make the process quicker and more efficient."
faqQ4: "Does 260 ml of lime juice conversion change for UK and US recipes?"
faqA4: "Yes, the conversion can vary slightly. In the UK, where a cup is 250 ml, 260 ml is about 1.04 cups. In the US, where a cup is 240 ml, it’s roughly 1.08 cups. For most recipes, rounding to 1.1 cups works, but for precision, check whether your recipe uses UK or US measurements."

<p>260 ml of lime juice equals approximately 1.1 cups. Whether you're whipping up a zesty marinade or a tangy dessert in your air fryer, knowing this conversion ensures your recipes turn out perfectly every time. Lime juice is a staple in many dishes, from Mexican-inspired meals to refreshing desserts, and getting the measurement right is key. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we’re all about making cooking simpler, so let’s break down this conversion in detail.</p>

<h2>Understanding the Conversion: 260 ml of Lime Juice to Cups</h2>
<p>Converting millilitres to cups can be tricky, especially when precision matters in recipes. For lime juice, 260 ml translates to roughly 1.1 cups, or just over a cup. This measurement is particularly useful for air fryer recipes, where balancing acidity and flavour is crucial. If you’re working with a recipe that calls for cups but you only have a measuring jug in millilitres, this conversion will save the day. For more handy conversions, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>

<p>Lime juice is often used in marinades, dressings, and even baked goods, so knowing how to measure it accurately is a game-changer. Whether you’re making crispy air-fried chicken with a lime glaze or a citrusy dessert, this conversion ensures consistency. Remember, 260 ml of lime juice is just slightly more than a standard US cup (240 ml), so adjust accordingly if your recipe is sensitive to liquid ratios.</p>

<h3>Why Accurate Lime Juice Measurements Matter</h3>
<p>Using the right amount of lime juice can make or break a dish. Too little, and your recipe might lack brightness; too much, and it could become overpoweringly sour. For air fryer cooking, where flavours are concentrated due to the high heat, precision is even more important. A dish like air-fried shrimp with lime needs just the right balance to shine. Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipes</a> for inspiration on how to use lime juice effectively.</p>

<h2>Converting 260 ml of Lime Juice in Different Cup Standards</h2>
<p>It’s worth noting that cup measurements can vary depending on where you are. In the UK, a standard cup is 250 ml, meaning 260 ml of lime juice is roughly 1.04 cups. In the US, where a cup is 240 ml, it’s about 1.08 cups. For most practical purposes, rounding to 1.1 cups works perfectly fine, but if you’re following a precise recipe, these small differences can matter. Always check whether your recipe uses US or UK measurements to avoid confusion.</p>

<p>If you’re scaling a recipe up or down, knowing these conversions helps maintain the right flavour balance. For example, doubling a recipe that calls for 260 ml of lime juice means you’ll need 2.2 cups. This is especially handy when meal prepping or cooking for a crowd.

<h3>Tips for Measuring Lime Juice Accurately</h3>
<p>When measuring lime juice, it’s best to use a liquid measuring cup for accuracy. Pour the juice slowly to the 260 ml mark, checking at eye level to avoid over- or under-pouring. If you’re using fresh limes, note that one medium lime yields about 30-45 ml of juice, so you’ll need roughly 6-8 limes for 260 ml. For convenience, bottled lime juice works too—just ensure it’s pure lime juice without added sugars or preservatives.</p>

<h2>Common Uses for 260 ml of Lime Juice in Air Fryer Recipes</h2>
<p>260 ml of lime juice is a versatile quantity that pops up in many air fryer recipes. From marinades for chicken or shrimp to dressings for salads or grain bowls, this amount adds a vibrant kick. Try it in an air-fried fish taco recipe, where the lime juice balances the richness of the fish. Or, use it in a citrusy glaze for air-fried vegetables—just toss them in the lime juice before cooking for a bright, fresh flavour.</p>

<p>Desserts can also benefit from 260 ml of lime juice. A key lime pie-inspired air fryer dessert, for instance, might call for this amount to achieve the perfect tang. For more dessert ideas, browse our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert category</a>. The acidity of lime juice can even help tenderise meats, making it a great addition to air-fried steak or pork recipes.</p>

<h3>Storing Leftover Lime Juice</h3>
<p>If you don’t use all 260 ml of lime juice at once, store the remainder in an airtight container in the fridge for up to a week. Alternatively, freeze it in ice cube trays for easy portioning later. This way, you’ll always have lime juice on hand for impromptu air fryer meals.

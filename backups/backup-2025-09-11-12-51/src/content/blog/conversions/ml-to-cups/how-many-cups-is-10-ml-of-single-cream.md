faqQ1: "Can I use double cream instead of single cream for 10 ml measurements?"
faqA1: "Yes, but double cream has a higher fat content, which may affect texture. For air frying, single cream is often preferred for lighter results. Adjust other liquids slightly if substituting."
faqQ2: "How do I measure 10 ml of single cream without a measuring spoon?"
faqA2: "A standard teaspoon holds about 5 ml, so two level teaspoons equal 10 ml. Alternatively, use a medicine syringe for precision, especially for small quantities in air fryer recipes."
faqQ3: "Does 10 ml of single cream make a difference in air fryer recipes?"
faqA3: "Absolutely! Even small amounts can impact moisture and browning. For example, 10 ml brushed over pastries helps achieve a crisp, golden finish in the air fryer."
faqQ4: "Can I freeze leftover single cream after measuring 10 ml?"
faqA4: "Freezing isn’t recommended, as it can separate when thawed. Instead, store it in the fridge and use within three days for best results in cooking or baking."

<p>10 ml of single cream is approximately 0.042 cups (or roughly 1/24 of a cup). This small measurement is crucial for precision in recipes, especially when using an air fryer where exact quantities can affect texture and flavour.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>When using an air fryer, precise measurements ensure even cooking and perfect results. Too much or too little single cream can alter the consistency of sauces, batters, or toppings.

<h3>How to Measure 10 ml of Single Cream Without a Scale</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a measuring jug or scale, use a teaspoon—10 ml is roughly two level teaspoons. For cups, fill a standard 240 ml cup to just under 1/24th of its capacity.

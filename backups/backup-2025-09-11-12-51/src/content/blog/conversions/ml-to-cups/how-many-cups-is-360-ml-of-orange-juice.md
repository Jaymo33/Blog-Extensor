faqQ1: "Is 360 ml of orange juice the same as 1.5 cups?"
faqA1: "Yes, 360 ml of orange juice is approximately 1.5 US cups (1.52 cups to be precise). However, in the UK, where a metric cup is 250 ml, it's closer to 1.44 cups. Always check which measurement system your recipe uses."
faqQ2: "Can I use bottled orange juice instead of fresh for measuring 360 ml?"
faqA2: "Absolutely! Bottled orange juice works fine for measuring 360 ml, though fresh-squeezed may offer a brighter flavour. Just ensure the juice is strained if pulpy, as pulp can affect the volume slightly."
faqQ3: "How does 360 ml of orange juice convert to fluid ounces?"
faqA3: "360 ml of orange juice equals about 12.17 fluid ounces. This conversion is handy if your recipe uses imperial measurements or if you're using a scale that displays ounces instead of millilitres."
faqQ4: "Why do air fryer recipes sometimes specify ml instead of cups?"
faqA4: "Many air fryer recipes originate from countries that use the metric system, hence measurements in ml. Converting 360 ml to cups (1.52) ensures accuracy, especially for liquids like orange juice that impact texture and flavour. Always double-check conversions for best results."

<h3>Tips for Measuring Orange Juice Accurately</h3>  
<p>Use a liquid measuring cup for the most precise results. Pour the orange juice to the 360 ml mark, or measure 1.52 cups if using US standards. Avoid estimating, as small deviations can affect your recipe. For sticky ingredients like honey or syrup combined with orange juice, lightly grease the measuring cup first to ensure all the liquid pours out cleanly.</p>

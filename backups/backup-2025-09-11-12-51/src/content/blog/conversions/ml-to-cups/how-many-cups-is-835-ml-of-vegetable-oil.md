<p>835 ml of vegetable oil is approximately 3.5 cups in the UK and roughly 3.52 cups in the US. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes, where precise measurements ensure even cooking and perfect texture. Whether you're making crispy chips or moist cakes, knowing how to convert millilitres to cups can make all the difference.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of vegetable oil ensures your food cooks evenly and doesn’t end up too greasy or dry. Air fryers rely on hot air circulation, so excess oil can lead to splattering, while too little may leave food undercooked. For recipes like air-fried chicken or roasted vegetables, 835 ml of vegetable oil converted correctly ensures consistent results every time.</p>

<h3>UK vs. US Cup Measurements</h3>  
<p>In the UK, a standard cup holds 250 ml, while in the US, it’s slightly less at 240 ml. This means 835 ml of vegetable oil equals 3.5 cups in the UK and about 3.52 cups in the US. The difference might seem small, but for baking or frying, it can affect the outcome.</p>  

<h2>How to Measure 835 ml of Vegetable Oil Without a Scale</h2>  
<p>If you don’t have a measuring jug, you can use a standard cup to measure 835 ml of vegetable oil. Fill the cup three times (750 ml) and add another half-cup (125 ml) to reach 875 ml, then remove a tablespoon (15 ml) to get close to 835 ml. This method isn’t exact but works in a pinch.</p>  

<p>For more precision, consider investing in a kitchen scale or a graduated measuring jug. These tools are invaluable for air fryer cooking, where consistency is key.

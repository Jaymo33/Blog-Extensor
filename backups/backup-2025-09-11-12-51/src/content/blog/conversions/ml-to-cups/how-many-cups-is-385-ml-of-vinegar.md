faqQ1: "Is 385 ml of vinegar the same in US and UK cups?"
faqA1: "No, 385 ml of vinegar equals 1.63 US cups but only 1.35 UK cups. The difference comes from the varying sizes of US and UK standard cup measurements. Always check which system your recipe uses."
faqQ2: "Can I use a regular drinking cup to measure 385 ml of vinegar?"
faqA2: "Drinking cups vary in size, so they’re not reliable for precise measurements. Instead, use a liquid measuring jug or standardised measuring cups for accuracy, especially in air fryer recipes where proportions matter."
faqQ3: "What’s the best way to measure 385 ml of vinegar without a jug?"
faqA3: "If you don’t have a jug, use a tablespoon (15 ml) to measure out 385 ml. It’ll take about 25.5 tablespoons, but this method is time-consuming. For frequent cooking, investing in a measuring jug is worthwhile."
faqQ4: "Can I substitute apple cider vinegar for white vinegar in a 385 ml measurement?"
faqA4: "Yes, you can swap apple cider vinegar for white vinegar in equal amounts (385 ml), but note that the flavour will be slightly fruitier. Adjust other seasonings if needed to balance the taste."

Whether you're marinating chicken or whipping up a tangy glaze, knowing how to convert millilitres to cups makes cooking effortless.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Vinegar Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of vinegar in air fryer recipes ensures your dishes aren’t too acidic or bland. A slight miscalculation can throw off the taste, especially in marinades or dressings. For example, a recipe calling for 385 ml of vinegar needs exactly 1.63 US cups to maintain the intended flavour profile. If you're following a UK recipe, 1.35 UK cups will give you the correct measurement.</p>

<h3>US vs UK Cup Measurements</h3>  
<p>It’s important to note that US and UK cup measurements differ slightly. A US cup holds 240 ml, while a UK cup is 284 ml. This means 385 ml of vinegar translates to 1.63 US cups but only 1.35 UK cups. Always check which measurement system your recipe uses to avoid errors.</p>  

<h2>How to Measure 385 ml of Vinegar Without a Scale</h2>  
<p>If you don’t have a measuring jug, you can still measure 385 ml of vinegar using standard cups. For US cups, fill one cup (240 ml) and then add roughly two-thirds of another cup. For UK cups, one full cup (284 ml) plus a little over a quarter cup will get you close to 385 ml.</p>  

<p>For more precise measurements, consider using a liquid measuring jug with millilitre markings. This is especially useful for air fryer recipes where exact proportions matter.

faqQ1: "Is 485 ml of yogurt the same as 2 cups?"
faqA1: "Not exactly. In the UK, 485 ml of yogurt equals about 2.05 cups, while in the US, it’s roughly 2.06 cups. The difference is minor but can matter in precise baking. Always check whether your recipe uses UK or US measurements."
faqQ2: "Can I use Greek yogurt instead of regular yogurt for 485 ml?"
faqA2: "Yes, but Greek yogurt is thicker, so you may need to adjust liquids elsewhere in the recipe. If substituting, consider adding a splash of milk or water to match the consistency of regular yogurt. This ensures your air fryer dish stays balanced."
faqQ3: "How do I measure 485 ml of yogurt without a measuring jug?"
faqA3: "Use a kitchen scale—485 ml of yogurt weighs around 500 grams. Alternatively, a UK mug holds roughly 300 ml, so 1.6 mugs will get you close. In the US, a standard coffee cup (240 ml) makes 485 ml just over 2 cups."
faqQ4: "Why do my air fryer recipes sometimes fail with yogurt measurements?"
faqA4: "Air fryers cook quickly, so small measurement errors can amplify. Too much yogurt can make dishes soggy, while too little may dry them out. Always level off your cups and consider weighing for accuracy. Check our conversion chart for foolproof results."

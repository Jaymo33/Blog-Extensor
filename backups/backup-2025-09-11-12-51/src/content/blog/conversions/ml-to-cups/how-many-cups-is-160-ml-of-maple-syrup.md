faqQ1: "Is 160 ml of maple syrup the same as 160 grams?"
faqA1: "No, 160 ml of maple syrup weighs approximately 212 grams due to its density. Maple syrup is thicker than water, so volume (ml) and weight (grams) aren't interchangeable. For precise baking or air frying, use a kitchen scale."
faqQ2: "Can I use honey instead of maple syrup in a 160 ml measurement?"
faqA2: "Yes, you can substitute honey for maple syrup in a 1:1 ratio by volume (160 ml honey for 160 ml syrup). However, honey is sweeter, so you may want to reduce other sugars in the recipe. Adjust air fryer temperatures slightly, as honey caramelises faster."
faqQ3: "How do I measure 160 ml of maple syrup without a measuring cup?"
faqA3: "If you don't have a measuring cup, use a tablespoon (15 ml). 160 ml equals roughly 10.5 tablespoons. For sticky syrup, lightly coat the spoon with oil first for easier pouring and cleaning."
faqQ4: "Does the type of maple syrup affect the 160 ml to cups conversion?"
faqA4: "No, whether you use Grade A or Grade B maple syrup, 160 ml will always equal about 0.68 cups. However, darker syrups have a stronger flavour, so consider taste preferences when substituting in recipes."

<p>160 ml of maple syrup is approximately 0.68 cups. This conversion is essential for baking, cooking, or air frying recipes that require precise measurements. Whether you're following a recipe from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> or adjusting a family favourite, knowing how to convert millilitres to cups ensures consistent results.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Maple syrup is a sticky, viscous liquid, and even small measurement errors can throw off a recipe. Too much syrup can make baked goods overly sweet or soggy, while too little might leave them dry. For air fryer recipes, precise measurements help achieve the perfect texture and caramelisation. If you're using an air fryer for desserts like maple-glazed treats, accuracy is key.</p>  

<p>Many recipes on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes</a> rely on exact measurements, especially for sticky ingredients like maple syrup. A slight variation can affect cooking times and results, so knowing how many cups 160 ml of maple syrup equals ensures your dish turns out just right. This is particularly important for air frying, where even heat distribution relies on balanced ingredients.</p>  

<h3>UK vs. US Cup Measurements</h3>  
<p>It's worth noting that UK and US cup measurements differ slightly. A UK cup is 284 ml, while a US cup is 240 ml. For 160 ml of maple syrup, the conversion is roughly 0.68 US cups or 0.56 UK cups. Most modern recipes, including those on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart</a>, use US measurements unless specified.</p>  

<h2>Tips for Measuring Maple Syrup</h2>  
<p>Measuring sticky liquids like maple syrup can be tricky. To get an accurate 160 ml, lightly grease your measuring cup or spoon with oil to help the syrup slide out easily. Alternatively, use a silicone spatula to scrape every last drop. This ensures you're not shortchanging your recipe and keeps cleanup simple.</p>  

<p>If you're working with an air fryer, consider using a kitchen scale for even greater precision. Weighing 160 ml of maple syrup (about 212 grams) can eliminate measurement errors.

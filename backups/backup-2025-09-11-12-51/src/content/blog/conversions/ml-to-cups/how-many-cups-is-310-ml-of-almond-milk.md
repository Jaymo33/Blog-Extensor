faqQ1: "Is 310 ml of almond milk the same as 310 ml of dairy milk in recipes?"
faqA1: "While the volume is the same (310 ml equals 1.31 cups), almond milk has a thinner consistency and slightly sweeter taste than dairy milk. In most air fryer recipes, you can substitute them 1:1, but you may need to adjust cooking times or thickeners for sauces."
faqQ2: "Can I use 310 ml of almond milk in savoury air fryer dishes?"
faqA2: "Absolutely! Almond milk works well in savoury recipes like creamy pasta sauces or mashed potatoes. Just ensure you measure accurately—310 ml converts to 1.31 cups—and balance flavours, as almond milk has a subtle nutty taste."
faqQ3: "How do I measure 310 ml of almond milk if I don’t have metric cups?"
faqA3: "Use a kitchen scale—310 ml weighs about 310 grams. Alternatively, a standard UK mug holds roughly 250 ml, so 310 ml is just over one full mug. For precision, consider investing in a measuring jug with both metric and imperial markings."
faqQ4: "Does 310 ml of almond milk froth well for air fryer beverages?"
faqA4: "Almond milk can froth, but not as thickly as dairy milk. For best results, use chilled almond milk and a frother. A 310 ml portion (1.31 cups) is ideal for 1-2 lattes or hot chocolates made in your air fryer."

<h3>How to Measure 310 ml of Almond Milk Without a Measuring Cup</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a measuring cup, you can use a standard mug or glass. A typical UK mug holds about 250 ml, so 310 ml would be just over one full mug. For more precision, use a kitchen scale—310 ml of almond milk weighs roughly 310 grams. This method is especially useful for recipes where exact proportions matter, like cakes or custards.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for 310 ml of Almond Milk in Air Fryer Recipes</h2>  
<p>Almond milk is a versatile ingredient in air fryer cooking. From batters to sauces, it adds creaminess without dairy. A 310 ml portion (1.31 cups) is perfect for recipes like air-fried pancakes, vegan mac and cheese, or even a light batter for crispy tofu.

<h3>Does Almond Milk Behave Differently Than Dairy Milk in Air Fryer Recipes?</h3>  
<p>Almond milk has a thinner consistency than dairy milk, so it may affect cooking times slightly. However, 310 ml of almond milk (1.31 cups) works well in most recipes. If you're making a sauce, you might need to thicken it with cornflour or reduce it longer. For baking, almond milk performs similarly, though it may brown faster due to its sugar content.</p>  

<h2>Tips for Storing Leftover Almond Milk</h2>  
<p>If your recipe only uses part of a 310 ml portion, store the rest in an airtight container in the fridge. Almond milk lasts about 4-5 days once opened. Shake well before using, as separation is normal. For longer storage, freeze almond milk in ice cube trays—perfect for smoothies or future air fryer recipes.</p>

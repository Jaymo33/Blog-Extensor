faqQ1: "Can I use milk instead of half and half for 60 ml in a recipe?"
faqA1: "Yes, you can use milk as a substitute, but the result will be less creamy. For a closer match, mix equal parts milk and heavy cream to replicate the richness of half and half. This works well in most recipes, including air fryer dishes."
faqQ2: "How do I measure 60 ml of half and half without a measuring cup?"
faqA2: "If you don’t have a measuring cup, use a tablespoon. Since 1 tablespoon is about 15 ml, 60 ml of half and half equals 4 tablespoons. Alternatively, a standard shot glass is often 30 ml, so two shot glasses would give you 60 ml."
faqQ3: "Does 60 ml of half and half weigh the same as water?"
faqA3: "No, half and half is slightly denser than water. While 60 ml of water weighs 60 grams, 60 ml of half and half weighs approximately 61 grams due to its fat content. This small difference usually doesn’t affect recipes, but it’s good to know for precision baking."
faqQ4: "Can I freeze half and half if I only need 60 ml for a recipe?"
faqA4: "Freezing half and half isn’t recommended, as it can separate and become grainy when thawed. Instead, plan to use the rest within a week or share it with a friend. For longer storage, consider buying smaller cartons or using powdered half and half as a backup."

<h3>Tips for Measuring Half and Half</h3>
<p>To measure 60 ml of half and half accurately, use a liquid measuring cup with clear markings. Pour the half and half to the 60 ml line, or fill it to the 0.25 cup mark. If you’re using a scale, 60 ml of half and half weighs approximately 61 grams. This precision is especially important for air fryer recipes, where even small deviations can affect cooking times and results.</p>

<h2>Half and Half Substitutes</h2>
<p>If you’re out of half and half, you can still make your recipe work. For 60 ml (0.25 cups) of half and half, mix 30 ml of milk with 30 ml of heavy cream. This creates a similar richness and texture. Alternatively, you could use evaporated milk or a plant-based creamer, though the flavour may vary slightly.

<p>When using substitutes in air fryer recipes, keep an eye on cooking times, as different liquids may affect how your dish cooks. For example, a sauce made with a half and half substitute might thicken faster or slower than the original recipe intended. Adjust accordingly to avoid overcooking or undercooking.</p>

<h3>Storing Half and Half</h3>
<p>Once opened, half and half should be stored in the fridge and used within 7-10 days. If your recipe only calls for 60 ml (0.25 cups), you’ll want to make sure the rest doesn’t go to waste. Consider planning another recipe that uses half and half, like a creamy soup or a batch of pancakes.

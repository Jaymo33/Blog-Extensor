faqQ1: "Is 360 ml of vegetable oil the same as 1.5 cups?"
faqA1: "Not exactly. 360 ml of vegetable oil equals roughly 1.52 cups, which is slightly more than 1.5 cups. For precise air fryer recipes, it’s best to measure using ml or a conversion chart to avoid errors."
faqQ2: "Can I use 360 ml of vegetable oil for air fryer frying?"
faqA2: "Yes, but air fryers require much less oil than traditional frying. For most recipes, 1–2 tablespoons of oil suffice. Use 360 ml (1.52 cups) for coating large batches or making marinades, not for deep frying."
faqQ3: "How do I convert 360 ml of vegetable oil to grams?"
faqA3: "Vegetable oil’s density is about 0.92 g/ml, so 360 ml weighs roughly 331 grams. However, cups measure volume, not weight. For baking in air fryers, stick to volume measurements unless the recipe specifies grams."
faqQ4: "Does the type of vegetable oil affect the 360 ml to cups conversion?"
faqA4: "No, the conversion remains the same for all vegetable oils (sunflower, canola, etc.). However, oils with different viscosities may slightly affect measuring accuracy. Always use a liquid measuring cup for best results."

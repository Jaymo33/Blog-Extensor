faqQ1: "Is 835 ml of soy sauce the same in the UK and USA?"
faqA1: "Yes, 835 ml of soy sauce is the same volume in both the UK and USA. However, cup sizes differ slightly—a UK cup is 250 ml, while a US cup is 240 ml. For 835 ml, this means roughly 3.5 UK cups or 3.48 US cups, a negligible difference in most recipes."
faqQ2: "Can I use a kitchen scale to measure 835 ml of soy sauce?"
faqA2: "Yes, but you’ll need to know the density of soy sauce, which is roughly 1.2 grams per ml. This means 835 ml weighs about 1002 grams. While possible, using a liquid measuring cup is quicker and more accurate for most home cooks."
faqQ3: "How do I adjust 835 ml of soy sauce for a smaller batch?"
faqA3: "Simply divide the measurement—for half, use 417.5 ml (1.75 cups), or for a quarter, use 208.75 ml (0.875 cups). This flexibility makes it easy to scale recipes up or down depending on your needs."
faqQ4: "What’s the best way to store leftover soy sauce after measuring 835 ml?"
faqA4: "Transfer unused soy sauce back to its original bottle or an airtight container. Store it in a cool, dark place to maintain flavour. Avoid contamination by using clean utensils when measuring."

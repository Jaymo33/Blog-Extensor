faqQ1: "Is 610 ml of soy sauce the same as 2.5 cups?"
faqA1: "Not exactly. In the UK, 610 ml equals about 2.58 cups (since 1 UK cup = 284 ml). In the US, it's closer to 2.57 cups (1 US cup = 237 ml). The difference is small but matters for precise recipes, especially in air fryer cooking where sauces reduce quickly."
faqQ2: "Can I use a scale to measure 610 ml of soy sauce?"
faqA2: "Yes! Soy sauce weighs roughly 1.025 grams per ml, so 610 ml ≈ 625g. This method is handy if you don’t have measuring cups. Just ensure your scale is set to grams and tare the container first for accuracy."
faqQ3: "How long does 610 ml of soy sauce last in the fridge?"
faqA3: "An unopened bottle lasts 2-3 years, while opened soy sauce stays fresh for about 1 year refrigerated. If you’ve used 610 ml for meal prep, store leftovers in an airtight container and use within 3 months for best flavour."
faqQ4: "What’s the best way to reduce 610 ml of soy sauce for a glaze?"
faqA4: "Simmer it in a pan over low heat or in your air fryer’s oven mode at 160°C, stirring occasionally. Reducing 610 ml (2.58 cups) by half takes ~20-30 minutes. Add honey or ginger for extra depth."

<h2>Why Accurate Soy Sauce Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of soy sauce is crucial in air fryer cooking. Too little, and your dish may lack depth; too much, and it can become overly salty. Converting 610 ml of soy sauce to cups (about 2.58 UK cups) ensures balanced flavours. Many air fryer recipes, like our popular <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>teriyaki chicken</a>, rely on precise soy sauce measurements for the best results. A slight variation can alter the taste significantly, so measuring correctly is key.</p>

<h2>How to Measure 610 ml of Soy Sauce Without a Measuring Cup</h2>  
<p>No measuring cup? No problem. A standard UK mug holds about 300 ml, so 610 ml of soy sauce is roughly two mugs minus a tablespoon.

<p>Another trick is to use tablespoons: 1 UK cup = 16 tbsp, so 610 ml (2.58 cups) equals about 41 tbsp. This method works well for smaller adjustments. If you're preparing a <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable stir-fry</a>, you can gradually add soy sauce until the flavour is just right. Remember, soy sauce reduces during cooking, so start with slightly less if unsure.</p>

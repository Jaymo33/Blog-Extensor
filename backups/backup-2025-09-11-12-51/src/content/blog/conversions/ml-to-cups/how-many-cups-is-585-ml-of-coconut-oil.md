faqQ1: "Is 585 ml of coconut oil the same as 585 grams?"
faqA1: "No, 585 ml of coconut oil isn't the same as 585 grams. The weight of coconut oil varies depending on its temperature. In its solid state, 585 ml weighs about 540 grams, while in liquid form it's slightly less. Always measure by volume for recipes specifying millilitres or cups."
faqQ2: "Can I use the same conversion for other types of oil?"
faqA2: "While the volume conversion (585 ml to cups) works for any liquid, different oils have different weights. Coconut oil is slightly less dense than some other oils, but the cup measurement remains the same. For air frying, coconut oil is often preferred for its high smoke point and flavour."
faqQ3: "How long will 585 ml of coconut oil last in my air fryer?"
faqA3: "585 ml (about 2.47 cups) of coconut oil will last for several air fryer sessions. Most recipes only need 1-2 tablespoons of oil. Stored properly in an airtight container, coconut oil can last up to 2 years, making this quantity practical for regular air fryer use."
faqQ4: "What's the best way to melt coconut oil for accurate measuring?"
faqA4: "To melt coconut oil for measuring 585 ml, place the container in warm water or microwave it in short bursts. Avoid high heat as it can degrade the oil's quality. Once liquid, pour it into a measuring cup to get your 2.47 cups (585 ml) for air fryer recipes."

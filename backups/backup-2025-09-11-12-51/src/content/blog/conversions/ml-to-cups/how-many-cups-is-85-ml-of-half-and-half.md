faqQ1: "Is 85 ml of half and half the same as 85 grams?"
faqA1: "Yes, 85 ml of half and half is approximately 85 grams, as its density is very close to water. This makes it easy to measure by weight if you don't have a liquid measuring tool. For air fryer recipes, using a kitchen scale can ensure perfect measurements every time."
faqQ2: "Can I use milk instead of half and half in a recipe calling for 85 ml?"

faqQ4: "Does the cup measurement change between UK and US recipes for 85 ml of half and half?"
faqA4: "No, the conversion remains the same. 85 ml equals about 0.36 cups in both UK and US measurements. However, always check if a recipe uses metric or imperial cups, as this can affect larger quantities in air fryer cooking."

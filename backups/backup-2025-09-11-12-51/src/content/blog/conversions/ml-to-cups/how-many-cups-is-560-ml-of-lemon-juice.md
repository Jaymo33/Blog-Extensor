Air fryer recipes, like those found on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>our recipes page</a>, often rely on precise liquid measurements for marinades, glazes, and sauces.

<h3>US vs. UK Cup Measurements</h3>

This means 560 ml of lemon juice converts to roughly 2.37 US cups or 1.97 UK cups.

<h2>How to Measure 560 ml of Lemon Juice Without a Scale</h2>  
<p>If you don't have a measuring jug, you can still measure 560 ml of lemon juice using standard cups. For US cups, fill 2 cups completely and add another 1/3 cup. For UK cups, fill 1 cup, then add another cup filled to just under the brim. Freshly squeezed lemon juice works best for recipes, but bottled juice is a convenient alternative. Just make sure it's pure lemon juice without added sugars or preservatives.</p>

faqQ1: "Is 860 ml of orange juice the same in UK and US cups?"
faqA1: "No, there's a difference. 860 ml equals about 3.63 US cups (240 ml per cup) or roughly 3.03 UK cups (284 ml per cup). For air fryer recipes, we recommend using metric measurements for consistency, especially when precision matters in cooking times and textures."
faqQ2: "Can I use bottled orange juice when a recipe calls for 860 ml?"
faqA2: "Yes, bottled orange juice works fine for most recipes requiring 860 ml. However, fresh-squeezed juice often provides better flavour for dishes like glazes or marinades. Just ensure you measure carefully, as the acidity level might vary slightly between fresh and bottled varieties."
faqQ3: "How many servings does 860 ml of orange juice make in air fryer recipes?"
faqA3: "It depends on the recipe. For marinades, 860 ml of orange juice can typically cover 4-6 portions of protein like chicken or fish. In baking applications, this amount might make 8-12 servings of an orange-infused cake or dessert in the air fryer."
faqQ4: "What's the best way to measure 860 ml of orange juice without scales?"
faqA4: "Use a liquid measuring jug with millilitre markings for accuracy. If you only have cups, remember that 860 ml is about 3â…” US cups. For air fryer recipes where precision matters, investing in a good measuring jug will help ensure consistent results every time you cook."

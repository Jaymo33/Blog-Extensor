Whether you're whipping up a cake or preparing a creamy sauce, knowing the exact measurement ensures your dish turns out perfectly every time.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of oat milk can make or break your recipe. Too little, and your dish might turn out dry; too much, and it could become soggy. For air fryer recipes, precision is key, as the cooking process relies on balanced moisture levels. A slight variation in measurement can affect texture and taste, so it's best to stick to the recommended amounts.</p>

<h2>Converting 210 ml of Oat Milk to Cups</h2>

For most recipes, you can safely round this up to 0.9 cups without affecting the outcome. However, for baking, where precision is crucial, sticking to the exact measurement is advisable.</p>  
<p>If you're using a standard measuring cup, fill it just below the 1-cup mark to get the right amount.

<h3>Measuring Oat Milk for Air Fryer Recipes</h3>  
<p>When using oat milk in air fryer recipes, it's best to measure it in a liquid measuring cup for accuracy. Pour slowly to avoid spills and check the measurement at eye level. Oat milk's slightly thicker consistency means it can cling to the sides of the cup, so give it a moment to settle before finalising the amount.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for 210 ml of Oat Milk</h2>  
<p>210 ml of oat milk is a versatile amount, perfect for many recipes. It's enough to make a creamy pasta sauce, a small batch of pancakes, or a moist cake. In the air fryer, it works well for coating vegetables or creating a light batter for crispy treats. Oat milk's mild, slightly sweet flavour makes it a great addition to both sweet and savoury dishes.</p>

<h3>Adjusting Recipes for Oat Milk</h3>  
<p>If a recipe calls for dairy milk, you can usually substitute it with oat milk in a 1:1 ratio.

For 210 ml of oat milk, this minor difference won't drastically alter most recipes, but it's something to keep in mind for delicate bakes.</p>  

<h2>Tips for Storing Oat Milk</h2>  
<p>Once opened, oat milk should be refrigerated and used within 5-7 days. Always shake the carton before use, as separation is natural. If you're using 210 ml for a recipe but have leftovers, consider freezing it in ice cube trays for future use in smoothies or sauces.

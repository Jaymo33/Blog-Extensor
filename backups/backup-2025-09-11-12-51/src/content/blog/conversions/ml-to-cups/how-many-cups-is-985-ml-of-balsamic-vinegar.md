faqQ1: "How do I measure 985 ml of balsamic vinegar without a measuring jug?"
faqA1: "If you don’t have a measuring jug, use a standard cup (240 ml) and measure just over 4 cups. For 985 ml of balsamic vinegar, that’s roughly 4 cups plus 2 tablespoons. A kitchen scale set to grams (985 ml ≈ 985g) can also work."
faqQ2: "Does the type of balsamic vinegar affect the cup conversion?"
faqA2: "Traditional balsamic vinegar is thicker, so 985 ml might slightly differ in volume compared to thinner varieties. However, for most recipes, the standard conversion (4.16 cups) works. Always check consistency—thicker vinegar may need adjusting in glazes."
faqQ3: "Can I use this conversion for other liquids in air fryer recipes?"
faqA3: "Yes! The 985 ml to cups conversion applies to most liquids, like broth or oil. However, syrupy liquids (e.g., honey) may vary slightly. For air fryer recipes, precise measurements ensure even cooking and flavour balance."
faqQ4: "How long does 985 ml of balsamic vinegar last once opened?"
faqA4: "Opened balsamic vinegar lasts 3–5 years if stored in a cool, dark place. Its acidity acts as a preservative. For best quality in air fryer recipes, use within 2 years and check for flavour changes."

faqQ1: "Is 585 ml of corn syrup the same as 2.5 cups?"
faqA1: "No, 585 ml of corn syrup is approximately 2.47 cups. While 2.5 cups is close, the slight difference can affect recipes requiring precision, especially in baking or glazes. Always measure carefully for best results."
faqQ2: "Can I use a kitchen scale to measure 585 ml of corn syrup?"
faqA2: "Yes, but since corn syrup’s density varies slightly with temperature, volume (ml or cups) is more reliable for accuracy. If using a scale, 585 ml weighs about 800 grams, but stick to liquid measurements for consistency."
faqQ3: "How do I measure 585 ml of corn syrup without a measuring jug?"
faqA3: "Use a standard 240 ml cup: fill it twice (480 ml) and add 7 tablespoons (105 ml) to reach 585 ml. For sticky ingredients like corn syrup, lightly grease the cup for easier pouring and cleanup."
faqQ4: "Does the type of corn syrup affect the 585 ml to cups conversion?"
faqA4: "No, light or dark corn syrup has the same density, so 585 ml equals 2.47 cups regardless of type. However, flavour profiles differ, so choose based on your recipe’s requirements."

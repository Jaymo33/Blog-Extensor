faqQ1: "Is 885 ml of coconut milk the same as 885 ml of water in cups?"
faqA1: "No, because coconut milk has a thicker consistency than water. While both measure the same in milliliters, coconut milk's density means it may slightly vary in cup measurements depending on how well it's mixed. Always stir coconut milk before measuring for accuracy."
faqQ2: "Can I use light coconut milk instead of full-fat for 885 ml measurements?"
faqA2: "Yes, but the results may differ. Full-fat coconut milk (885 ml or 3.74 cups) will give a richer texture, while light coconut milk will be more watery. Adjust cooking times slightly if substituting, as light coconut milk may evaporate faster in the air fryer."
faqQ3: "How many 400 ml cans of coconut milk make 885 ml?"
faqA3: "You’ll need two 400 ml cans to reach 885 ml, using about 85 ml from the second can. Since cans are typically 400 ml, it’s easiest to open two and measure out 885 ml (or 3.74 cups) total. Store leftovers in the fridge for up to 3 days."
faqQ4: "Why do some recipes list coconut milk in ml and others in cups?"
faqA4: "Recipes may use ml (metric) or cups (imperial) depending on their origin. UK and European recipes often use ml, while US recipes prefer cups. At 885 ml (3.74 cups), the difference is minor, but always check which system your recipe uses for best results in the air fryer."

<h2>Why Accurate Coconut Milk Measurements Matter</h2>
<p>Using the right amount of coconut milk can make or break your air fryer dish. Too little, and your curry might lack creaminess; too much, and your cake could turn soggy.

<h2>How to Measure 885 ml of Coconut Milk Without a Scale</h2>

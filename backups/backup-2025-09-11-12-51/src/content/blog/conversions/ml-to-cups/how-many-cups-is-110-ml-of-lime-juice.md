faqQ1: "Is 110 ml of lime juice the same as 110 grams?"
faqA1: "Yes, 110 ml of lime juice is roughly equivalent to 110 grams, as lime juice has a similar density to water. This makes it easy to measure by weight if you don’t have a measuring cup handy."
faqQ2: "Can I use bottled lime juice instead of fresh for 110 ml measurements?"
faqA2: "While bottled lime juice can be used, fresh lime juice offers a brighter, more vibrant flavour. If substituting, ensure the bottled juice is pure lime juice without added sugars or preservatives for the best results."
faqQ3: "How many limes do I need for 110 ml of juice?"
faqA3: "On average, one medium lime yields about 30 ml of juice, so you’ll need roughly 3-4 limes to get 110 ml. This can vary slightly depending on the size and juiciness of the limes."
faqQ4: "What’s the best way to store leftover lime juice?"
faqA4: "Store leftover lime juice in an airtight container in the fridge for up to a week. For longer storage, freeze it in ice cube trays—each cube is roughly 30 ml, making future measurements easy."

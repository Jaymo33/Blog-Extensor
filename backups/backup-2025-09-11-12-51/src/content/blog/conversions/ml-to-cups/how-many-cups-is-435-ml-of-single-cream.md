faqQ1: "Does 435 ml of single cream equal the same in UK and US cups?"
faqA1: "No, there's a slight difference. In UK measurements, 435 ml equals about 1.84 cups (1 cup = 250 ml). In US measurements, it's approximately 1.8 cups (1 cup = 240 ml). Always check which measurement system your recipe uses for accuracy."

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of single cream can make or break a recipe. Too much, and your dish might become overly rich or soggy; too little, and it could lack creaminess. Air fryer recipes, like those on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, often rely on precise measurements for even cooking. A slight variation in liquid ingredients can affect texture and cooking time, so knowing how to convert 435 ml of single cream to cups is crucial.</p>  
<p>For example, if you're making a creamy pasta bake in your air fryer, the right amount of single cream ensures the sauce coats the pasta perfectly.

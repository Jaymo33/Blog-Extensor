faqQ1: "Is 635 ml of tomato sauce the same as 2.5 cups?"
faqA1: "No, 635 ml equals approximately 2.68 US cups or 2.23 UK cups. The exact conversion depends on whether you’re using US or UK measurements. Always check your recipe’s measurement standard for accuracy."
faqQ2: "Can I use a kitchen scale instead of measuring cups for 635 ml of tomato sauce?"
faqA2: "Yes, a kitchen scale is more precise. Since 1 ml of water weighs 1 gram, 635 ml of tomato sauce is roughly 635 grams, though density may vary slightly. For thicker sauces, weighing ensures consistency in air fryer recipes."
faqQ3: "How do I adjust cooking time if I use slightly more or less than 635 ml of tomato sauce?"
faqA3: "In an air fryer, extra sauce may require longer cooking to reduce liquid, while less sauce might dry out the dish. Start with the recommended time and check halfway. Stirring or covering with foil can help manage moisture levels."
faqQ4: "What’s the best way to store leftover tomato sauce after measuring 635 ml?"
faqA4: "Store unused tomato sauce in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 5 days. For longer storage, freeze it in portion-sized containers. Reheat gently in a saucepan or microwave before adding to air fryer recipes."

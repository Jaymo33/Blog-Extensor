faqQ1: "Is 235 ml of vegetable oil exactly 1 cup?"
faqA1: "235 ml of vegetable oil is very close to 1 cup, but not exact. A standard metric cup holds 240 ml, so 235 ml is just under a full cup. For most recipes, this small difference won’t matter, but for precision, measure slightly below the cup’s rim."
faqQ2: "Can I use a US cup to measure 235 ml of vegetable oil?"
faqA2: "Yes, but note that a US cup is 236.59 ml, so 235 ml is nearly identical. The difference is negligible for air frying or baking. If your recipe requires exact measurements, use a metric measuring jug for accuracy."
faqQ3: "How do I measure 235 ml of vegetable oil without a measuring cup?"
faqA3: "If you don’t have a measuring cup, use a tablespoon. There are roughly 16 tablespoons in 235 ml (1 tbsp = 15 ml). Alternatively, fill a standard drinking glass to just below the 250 ml mark, leaving a small gap."
faqQ4: "Why do air fryer recipes sometimes call for 235 ml of vegetable oil?"
faqA4: "Recipes may use 235 ml (about 1 cup) for coating or marinating ingredients like chicken or vegetables. This amount ensures even crispiness without excess oil. For healthier options, you can reduce the oil slightly and still achieve great results in your air fryer."

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Frying</h2>

<p>Not everyone has a kitchen scale, but most cooks have measuring cups handy. To measure 235 ml of vegetable oil without one, use a standard metric cup.

<h3>Does the Type of Oil Affect the Measurement?</h3>

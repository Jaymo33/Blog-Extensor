faqQ1: "Is 85 ml of buttermilk the same as 85 grams?"
faqA1: "No, 85 ml of buttermilk is not the same as 85 grams. Buttermilk has a density slightly higher than water, so 85 ml weighs around 87-90 grams. For precise baking, it's best to measure by volume (ml) or use a kitchen scale for weight."
faqQ2: "Can I substitute regular milk for buttermilk in an air fryer recipe?"
faqA2: "Yes, but you’ll need to add acidity. For every 85 ml of buttermilk, mix 80 ml of milk with 5 ml of lemon juice or vinegar. Let it sit for 5 minutes before using. This works well for air fryer batters and marinades."
faqQ3: "How do I measure 85 ml of buttermilk without a measuring cup?"
faqA3: "Use a tablespoon—17 tablespoons equal roughly 85 ml. Alternatively, a standard shot glass holds about 44 ml, so two shots minus a teaspoon will get you close. For air fryer recipes, small inaccuracies are usually fine."
faqQ4: "Why do some recipes use ml and others use cups for buttermilk?"
faqA4: "Recipes from the UK and Europe often use ml, while US recipes prefer cups. If you’re using an air fryer, stick to the original recipe’s units for best results. Our conversion tools can help bridge the gap between measurements."

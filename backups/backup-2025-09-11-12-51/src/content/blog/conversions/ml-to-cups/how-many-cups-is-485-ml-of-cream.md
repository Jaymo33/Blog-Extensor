faqQ1: "Does the type of cream affect the 485 ml to cups conversion?"
faqA1: "No, the type of cream (single, double, or whipping) doesn't affect the volume conversion from 485 ml to cups. While they have different fat contents and thicknesses, 485 ml of any cream still equals approximately 2.05 US cups. The difference comes in when measuring by weight rather than volume."
faqQ2: "How can I measure 485 ml of cream without a measuring jug?"
faqA2: "If you don't have a measuring jug, you can use standard cups to measure 485 ml of cream. Remember that 1 US cup equals about 237 ml, so 485 ml is roughly 2 cups plus 1 tablespoon. For thicker creams, spoon the cream into the cup and level it off for the most accurate measurement."
faqQ3: "Why do UK and US cup measurements differ for 485 ml of cream?"
faqA3: "The difference comes from historical measurement systems. A US cup is 240 ml (officially 236.588 ml), while a UK cup is 284 ml. This means 485 ml of cream equals about 2.05 US cups but only 1.71 UK cups. Always check which measurement system your recipe uses to ensure accuracy in your air fryer cooking."
faqQ4: "Can I use the 485 ml to cups conversion for other liquids besides cream?"
faqA4: "Yes, the 485 ml to cups conversion works for any liquid with similar viscosity to water or cream. However, for very thick substances like honey or syrup, you might get slightly different results due to how they settle in the measuring cup. For most cooking purposes in your air fryer though, the standard conversion works perfectly."

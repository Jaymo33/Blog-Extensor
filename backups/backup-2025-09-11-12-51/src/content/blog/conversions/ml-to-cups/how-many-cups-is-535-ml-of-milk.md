faqA1: "No, 535 ml of milk is slightly more than 2 cups in the US (2.26 cups) and slightly less in the UK (2.11 cups). Always check whether your recipe uses US or UK measurements for accuracy."
faqQ2: "Can I use plant-based milk instead of regular milk in air fryer recipes?"

<p>535 ml of milk is approximately 2.26 cups in the US measurement system and roughly 2.11 cups in the UK system. This conversion is essential for anyone using recipes that list milk in millilitres but require cup measurements. Whether you're preparing a creamy sauce or baking a cake in your air fryer, getting the measurement right ensures perfect results every time.</p>

<h2>Understanding the Conversion from Millilitres to Cups</h2>  
<p>Converting millilitres to cups can be tricky because the size of a cup varies between countries. In the US, 1 cup equals 240 ml, while in the UK, it's 284 ml. For 535 ml of milk, this means you'll get slightly different measurements depending on where your recipe originates. Always check whether your recipe uses US or UK measurements to avoid mistakes.</p>  
<p>For air fryer recipes, precision is key. Too much or too little milk can affect texture and cooking times. If you're using a recipe from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, it likely follows UK measurements. However, many online recipes default to US cups, so double-check before you start cooking.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers cook food quickly and evenly, but only if the ingredients are measured correctly. Too much liquid, like milk, can make batters too runny or sauces too thin. On the other hand, too little milk might leave your dish dry or undercooked. Measuring 535 ml of milk accurately ensures your dishes turn out just right.</p>

<h3>US vs. UK Cup Measurements for Milk</h3>  
<p>As mentioned earlier, US and UK cups differ in size. For 535 ml of milk, the US measurement is about 2.26 cups, while the UK measurement is closer to 2.11 cups. This small difference might not seem like much, but in baking or making custards, it can impact the final result.</p>

<h3>How to Measure 535 ml of Milk Without a Measuring Cup</h3>  
<p>If you don't have a measuring cup, you can use a kitchen scale. Milk weighs roughly 1 gram per millilitre, so 535 ml of milk is about 535 grams. Alternatively, use a standard mug—most hold around 250–300 ml, so 535 ml would be just under two mugfuls.</p>

faqQ1: "Can I use 860 ml of coconut oil for deep frying in an air fryer?"
faqA1: "While air fryers don’t deep fry in the traditional sense, you can use 860 ml of coconut oil for recipes that require a light coating. The oil helps achieve crispiness, but you won’t need to submerge food completely. For best results, brush or spray the oil onto ingredients before air frying."
faqQ2: "Does the type of coconut oil affect the 860 ml to cups conversion?"
faqA2: "No, the conversion remains the same whether you’re using refined or unrefined coconut oil. Both types have similar densities, so 860 ml equals roughly 3.63 cups. However, refined coconut oil has a higher smoke point, making it better for high-heat air frying."
faqQ3: "How many servings can I make with 860 ml of coconut oil in an air fryer?"
faqA3: "It depends on the recipe. For dishes like coconut shrimp or crispy tofu, 860 ml (3.63 cups) can cover 4–6 batches. For baking, it’s enough for 2–3 large cakes or several dozen cookies. Always measure per recipe to avoid waste."
faqQ4: "Can I substitute other oils for 860 ml of coconut oil in air fryer recipes?"
faqA4: "Yes, but adjust for flavour and smoke point. For 860 ml (3.63 cups), try avocado or sunflower oil for neutral taste. Reduce quantity slightly, as coconut oil is denser. Check recipe guidelines at <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> for best results."

<h2>How to Measure 860 ml of Coconut Oil in Cups</h2>

<h3>Tips for Measuring Coconut Oil in Air Fryer Recipes</h3>

For recipes like coconut cookies or crispy tofu, melted oil ensures even coating and cooking.

faqQ1: "Is 860 ml of single cream the same as 860 grams?"
faqA1: "No, 860 ml of single cream is not the same as 860 grams. The weight depends on the cream's density, which is roughly 1.01 grams per ml. This means 860 ml of single cream weighs about 868.6 grams. Always check your recipe for weight or volume requirements."
faqQ2: "Can I use 860 ml of single cream in an air fryer?"
faqA2: "Yes, you can use 860 ml of single cream in an air fryer for recipes like custards or creamy sauces. Just ensure the dish is in a suitable container to prevent spills. Avoid overfilling, as the air fryer's fan can cause liquids to splatter."
faqQ3: "How do I convert 860 ml of single cream to tablespoons?"

faqQ4: "Does single cream thicken when heated in an air fryer?"
faqA4: "Single cream will thicken slightly when heated, but it won't reduce as much as double cream. For thicker sauces, consider adding a cornflour slurry or reducing the cream on the stove before transferring it to the air fryer."

<p>860 ml of single cream is approximately 3.63 cups in the UK and 3.64 cups in the US. This conversion is essential for recipes requiring precise measurements, especially when using an air fryer for baking or cooking creamy dishes. Whether you're making a rich sauce or a decadent dessert, knowing the exact cup equivalent ensures perfect results every time.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Using the correct amount of single cream can make or break a recipe. Too little, and your dish might lack richness; too much, and it could become overly heavy. For air fryer recipes, precise measurements are even more critical due to the appliance's rapid cooking process. A slight variation can affect texture and consistency, so it's best to measure carefully.</p>  
<p>If you're unsure about conversions, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for quick reference. It covers common ingredients, including liquids like single cream, to help you avoid guesswork. Whether you're following a recipe from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>our collection</a> or adapting a family favourite, accurate measurements ensure success.</p>  

<h3>UK vs. US Cup Measurements</h3>  
<p>It's worth noting that UK and US cup measurements differ slightly. A UK cup holds 250 ml, while a US cup is 240 ml. For 860 ml of single cream, this means 3.63 UK cups or 3.64 US cups. The difference is minimal but can add up in larger batches, so always check which standard your recipe follows.</p>  

<h2>How to Measure Single Cream Without a Scale</h2>  
<p>If you don't have a kitchen scale, measuring cups are a handy alternative. Pour the single cream into a liquid measuring cup, ensuring it sits level for accuracy. For 860 ml, you'll need just under 3 and 2/3 cups in either measurement system. Avoid using dry measuring cups, as they can lead to inconsistencies with liquids.</p>  
<p>For air fryer recipes, precision is key to avoid spills or uneven cooking. If you're working with smaller quantities, consider using tablespoons (15 ml per tablespoon) for finer adjustments. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert recipes</a> often call for single cream, so mastering these conversions will elevate your baking game.</p>  

<h3>Common Uses for 860 ml of Single Cream</h3>  
<p>Single cream is versatile, perfect for sauces, soups, and desserts. In an air fryer, it can be used to create creamy pasta bakes, custards, or even whipped toppings. Knowing how many cups 860 ml equals helps streamline your prep, especially when scaling recipes up or down.</p>  

<h2>Tips for Storing Single Cream</h2>  
<p>Once opened, single cream should be used within a few days. Store it in the coldest part of your fridge, ideally in an airtight container. If you've measured out 860 ml but don't need it all, freeze the excess in ice cube trays for later use. Just thaw and stir well before adding to recipes.</p>

<h3>Converting Other Dairy Products</h3>

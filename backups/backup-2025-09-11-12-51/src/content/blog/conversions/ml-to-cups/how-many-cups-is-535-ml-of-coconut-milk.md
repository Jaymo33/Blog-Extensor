<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of coconut milk can make or break a dish. Too little, and your recipe might lack creaminess; too much, and it could become overly rich or soggy. Air fryers, in particular, rely on balanced ingredients for even cooking. For example, if you're making a coconut-based curry in your air fryer, 535 ml of coconut milk (or 2.26 cups) ensures the perfect consistency.</p>

Plus, knowing how to measure 535 ml of coconut milk in cups saves time and reduces kitchen stress.</p>

For precision, use a kitchen scale or a liquid measuring cup with millilitre markings. This method is especially useful for air fryer baking, where exact ratios matter.</p>

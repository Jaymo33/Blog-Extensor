faqQ1: "Is 160 ml of almond milk the same as 160 ml of regular milk?"

<h2>Understanding Almond Milk Measurements</h2>
<p>Almond milk is a popular dairy-free alternative used in many recipes, from smoothies to baked goods.

<p>In the UK, metric measurements like millilitres are standard, but many recipes still use cups. If you're working with a recipe from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, you'll often find both measurements provided. However, when they aren't, this conversion ensures you're never left scratching your head.</p>

<h2>Why Accuracy Matters in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>
<p>Air fryers rely on precise measurements to deliver consistent results. Too much or too little liquid can throw off cooking times and textures. For example, adding 160 ml of almond milk instead of 0.68 cups might seem minor, but it can make a difference in batters or sauces. This is especially true for recipes like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>air fryer cakes</a>, where balance is key.</p>

<h3>Using 160 ml of Almond Milk in Smoothies</h3>

<h2>Tips for Measuring Almond Milk</h2>
<p>To measure 160 ml of almond milk accurately, use a liquid measuring jug with clear metric and imperial markings. Pour slowly to the 160 ml line, checking at eye level. If your recipe uses cups, remember that 160 ml is just under 3/4 cup (0.68 cups, to be exact).</p>

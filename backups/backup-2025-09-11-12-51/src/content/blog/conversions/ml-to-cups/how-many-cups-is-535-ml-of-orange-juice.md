faqQ1: "Is 535 ml of orange juice the same as 2 cups?"
faqA1: "No, 535 ml of orange juice is approximately 2.26 cups (using the metric cup measurement of 250 ml). If you're using US cups (240 ml), it's closer to 2.23 cups. Always check your recipe's measurement system for accuracy."
faqQ2: "Can I use bottled orange juice instead of fresh for 535 ml measurements?"
faqA2: "Yes, bottled orange juice works fine for most recipes requiring 535 ml. However, fresh-squeezed juice may offer a brighter flavour. Just ensure you measure accurately, whether using fresh or bottled, to maintain the recipe's balance."
faqQ3: "How do I measure 535 ml of orange juice without a measuring cup?"
faqA3: "If you don't have a measuring cup, use a kitchen scale. Orange juice weighs roughly 1.04 grams per ml, so 535 ml would be about 556 grams. Alternatively, use a standard drinking glass (usually 250 ml) and measure just over two glasses."
faqQ4: "Why do some recipes use ml and others use cups for orange juice?"
faqA4: "Recipes may use ml or cups depending on their origin. Metric-based recipes (UK, Europe) often use millilitres, while US recipes typically use cups. Always convert carefully, especially for baking, where precision matters. A conversion chart can help."

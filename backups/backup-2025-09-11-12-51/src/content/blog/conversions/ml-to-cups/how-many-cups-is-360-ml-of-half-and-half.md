faqQ1: "Is 360 ml of half and half the same as 1.5 cups?"
faqA1: "Yes, 360 ml of half and half equals approximately 1.5 US cups. In the UK, it's slightly less at 1.44 cups due to the larger metric cup size. For most recipes, this small difference won't affect the outcome."
faqQ2: "Can I use evaporated milk instead of half and half for 360 ml?"
faqA2: "Evaporated milk can be a substitute, but it's thicker and sweeter. Dilute it with equal parts water to mimic half and half's consistency. For 360 ml, use 180 ml evaporated milk and 180 ml water."
faqQ3: "How do I measure 360 ml of half and half without a measuring jug?"
faqA3: "If you don't have a measuring jug, use a standard US cup (240 ml) and fill it one and a half times. Alternatively, use a kitchen scale—360 ml of half and half weighs roughly 360 grams."
faqQ4: "Does the fat content in half and half affect air fryer cooking?"
faqA4: "Yes, the fat content can influence browning and crispiness. Half and half's moderate fat level helps achieve a creamy texture without excessive greasiness. Adjust cooking times slightly if substituting with lower or higher-fat alternatives."

<p>360 ml of half and half equals approximately 1.5 cups. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes, baking, or any cooking where precise measurements matter. Whether you're in the UK or the US, knowing how to convert millilitres to cups ensures your dishes turn out perfectly every time.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter</h2>
<p>Using the right amount of half and half can make or break a recipe. Too much or too little can affect texture, flavour, and cooking time. For air fryer recipes, precise measurements are especially important because the cooking process is faster and more intense. A slight deviation can lead to undercooked or overcooked results.</p>
<p>At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we emphasise the importance of accurate conversions.

<h2>How to Measure 360 ml of Half And Half</h2>
<p>Measuring liquids like half and half can be tricky if you don't have a metric measuring jug. A standard US cup holds 240 ml, so 360 ml is 1.5 cups. In the UK, a metric cup is 250 ml, making 360 ml roughly 1.44 cups. For most recipes, this small difference won’t matter, but for precision, use a kitchen scale or measuring jug.</p>
<p>If you're working with an air fryer, consider using a liquid measuring cup with clear markings. This helps avoid spills and ensures you get the exact amount needed. For more air fryer tips, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipes section</a>.</p>

<h3>US vs. UK Cup Measurements</h3>
<p>The difference between US and UK cup measurements can cause confusion. In the US, 1 cup is 240 ml, while in the UK, it's 250 ml. For 360 ml of half and half, this means 1.5 US cups or 1.44 UK cups. Most recipes account for this variance, but it's good to know which standard your recipe follows.</p>

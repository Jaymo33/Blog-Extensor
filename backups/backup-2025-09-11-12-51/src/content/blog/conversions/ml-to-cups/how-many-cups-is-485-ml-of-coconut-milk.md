faqQ1: "Is 485 ml of coconut milk the same as 2 cups?"
faqA1: "No, 485 ml of coconut milk is approximately 2.05 cups, which is slightly more than 2 cups. For precise recipes, especially in baking, this small difference can matter. Always measure carefully for the best results."
faqQ2: "Can I use canned coconut milk for air fryer recipes?"

faqQ4: "Does the type of coconut milk affect the conversion to cups?"
faqA4: "The conversion remains the same (485 ml ≈ 2.05 cups), but consistency may vary. Full-fat coconut milk is thicker, while light versions are more watery. Adjust recipes slightly if needed, especially for air fryer cooking where moisture levels matter."

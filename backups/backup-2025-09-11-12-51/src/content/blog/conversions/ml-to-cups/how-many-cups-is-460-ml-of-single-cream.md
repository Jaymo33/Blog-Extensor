faqQ1: "Is 460 ml of single cream the same as 2 cups?"
faqA1: "No, 460 ml of single cream is approximately 1.94 UK cups or 1.95 US cups. While it's close to 2 cups, the slight difference can matter in precise recipes, especially baking or air fryer dishes. Always measure carefully for best results."
faqQ2: "Can I use a standard mug to measure 460 ml of single cream?"
faqA2: "Mugs vary in size, so they're not reliable for accurate measurements. For 460 ml of single cream, use a measuring jug or standard cups. This ensures consistency, particularly in air fryer recipes where precision affects cooking times and textures."
faqQ3: "Does the fat content of single cream affect the conversion to cups?"
faqA3: "No, the fat content doesn't change the volume. Whether it's single or double cream, 460 ml will always convert to roughly 1.94 UK cups or 1.95 US cups. The difference lies in texture and richness, not measurement."
faqQ4: "How do I measure 460 ml of single cream without a jug?"
faqA4: "If you don't have a jug, use standard measuring cups. For 460 ml, you'll need just under 2 cups (1.94 UK or 1.95 US). Alternatively, use tablespoons—30 ml each—but this is less precise. For air fryer recipes, accuracy is key, so invest in a jug if possible."

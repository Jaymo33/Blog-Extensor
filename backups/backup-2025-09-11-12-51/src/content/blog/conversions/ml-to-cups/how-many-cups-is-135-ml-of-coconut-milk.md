faqQ1: "Can I use 135 ml of coconut milk in place of regular milk in air fryer recipes?"
faqA1: "Yes, you can substitute 135 ml of coconut milk for regular milk in most air fryer recipes. Coconut milk adds a rich, creamy texture and a subtle tropical flavour. Just note that it may alter the taste slightly, so it’s best suited for dishes like curries, soups, or desserts where the coconut flavour complements the other ingredients."
faqQ2: "How do I measure 135 ml of coconut milk if I don’t have a measuring jug?"
faqA2: "If you don’t have a measuring jug, use tablespoons—9 tablespoons equal roughly 135 ml. Alternatively, a kitchen scale can help, as 135 ml of coconut milk weighs about 135 grams. For thicker coconut milk, spoon it into a dry measuring cup and level it off for accuracy."
faqQ3: "Does the type of coconut milk (light vs. full-fat) affect the 135 ml to cups conversion?"
faqA3: "No, the conversion remains the same—135 ml is approximately 0.57 cups regardless of whether you use light or full-fat coconut milk. However, full-fat coconut milk is thicker and richer, so it may impact the texture of your dish more than light coconut milk would."
faqQ4: "Can I freeze leftover coconut milk after measuring out 135 ml?"
faqA4: "Absolutely! Freeze leftover coconut milk in an airtight container or ice cube trays for easy portioning. Thaw it in the fridge before using it in your next air fryer recipe. Just give it a good stir or shake after thawing to restore its consistency."

<p>135 ml of coconut milk is approximately 0.57 cups. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements can make or break your dish. Whether you're whipping up a curry or baking a cake, knowing how to convert 135 ml of coconut milk to cups ensures consistency. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we help simplify these conversions so you can focus on cooking.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>
<p>Using the right amount of coconut milk can affect the texture and flavour of your dish. Too much liquid might make your food soggy, while too little could dry it out. The air fryer’s intense heat means ingredients like coconut milk need to be measured precisely. For example, 135 ml of coconut milk in cups is roughly 0.57, which is just over half a cup. This small difference can be crucial in recipes like Thai curries or coconut-based desserts.</p>

<p>If you’re unsure about conversions, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> can help. It covers everything from ml to cups, grams to ounces, and more. Whether you’re cooking a <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken dish</a> or a <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert</a>, accurate measurements ensure perfect results every time.</p>

<h2>How to Measure 135 ml of Coconut Milk Without a Measuring Cup</h2>
<p>Don’t have a measuring cup? No problem. You can use a standard tablespoon to measure 135 ml of coconut milk. One tablespoon holds about 15 ml, so you’d need roughly 9 tablespoons to reach 135 ml. Alternatively, a kitchen scale can help—135 ml of coconut milk weighs around 135 grams, as its density is close to water. This method is handy for recipes where precision is key, like baking.</p>

<h3>Converting 135 ml of Coconut Milk for Different Recipes</h3>
<p>Whether you’re making a creamy soup or a fluffy cake, 135 ml of coconut milk in cups (0.57) is a common measurement. For savoury dishes, like a <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable curry</a>, this amount adds richness without overpowering other flavours. In desserts, it provides moisture and a subtle coconut taste. Always check your recipe’s requirements, as some might call for slight adjustments.</p>

<h2>Common Mistakes When Measuring Coconut Milk</h2>
<p>One mistake is not shaking the coconut milk can before measuring. Coconut milk separates, so shaking ensures a consistent texture. Another error is using a liquid measuring cup for thick coconut milk—opt for a dry measuring cup instead. Finally, eyeballing 135 ml of coconut milk can lead to inaccuracies. Always use proper tools or our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion guide</a> for best results.</p>

<h3>Storing Leftover Coconut Milk</h3>
<p>If your recipe only uses part of a can, store the rest in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 4 days. You can also freeze it in ice cube trays for easy portioning. Just thaw and measure out 135 ml (0.57 cups) when needed. This trick saves waste and keeps your coconut milk ready for future air fryer adventures.</p>

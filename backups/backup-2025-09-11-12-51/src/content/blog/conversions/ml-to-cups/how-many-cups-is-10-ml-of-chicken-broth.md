faqQ1: "Can I use water instead of 10 ml of chicken broth in an air fryer recipe?"
faqA1: "Yes, you can substitute water, but keep in mind that chicken broth adds flavour. If using water, consider adding a pinch of salt or herbs to compensate. For best results, stick to broth when the recipe specifically calls for it."
faqQ2: "How do I measure 10 ml of chicken broth without a measuring spoon?"
faqA2: "A standard teaspoon holds about 5 ml, so two level teaspoons equal 10 ml. Alternatively, use a tablespoon and fill it two-thirds full. Eyeballing it as roughly the volume of two dice also works in a pinch."
faqQ3: "Does 10 ml of chicken broth make a difference in air fryer cooking?"
faqA3: "Absolutely! Even small amounts of broth can enhance moisture and flavour, especially in marinades or glazes. It’s particularly useful for preventing dryness in lean meats or vegetables."
faqQ4: "Can I freeze leftover chicken broth after measuring out 10 ml?"
faqA4: "Yes, freezing leftover broth is a great way to avoid waste. Pour it into ice cube trays (each cube is about 15 ml) and thaw as needed. This makes it easy to grab small portions for future recipes."

faqQ1: "Does the thickness of tomato sauce affect the cup measurement?"
faqA1: "No, the thickness doesn't change the volume measurement. 910 ml of thick or thin tomato sauce will still equal approximately 3.85 US cups. However, thicker sauces may be harder to pour accurately, so it's best to use a liquid measuring cup for precision in air fryer recipes."
faqQ2: "Can I use this conversion for other sauces like pasta sauce or ketchup?"
faqA2: "Yes, this conversion works for any liquid or semi-liquid sauce with a similar consistency to tomato sauce. Whether it's pasta sauce, ketchup, or pizza sauce, 910 ml will equal roughly 3.85 US cups. Just remember that thicker sauces might require scraping to get an accurate measurement."
faqQ3: "How do I measure 910 ml of tomato sauce if I only have a 1-cup measure?"
faqA3: "Simply measure out 3 full cups (720 ml) first, then add another 3/4 cup plus 1 tablespoon (190 ml) to reach 910 ml total. For UK measurements, use 3 full cups (750 ml) plus another 160 ml (about 2/3 cup). This method works well for air fryer recipes requiring precise amounts."
faqQ4: "Why do some recipes use ml while others use cups for tomato sauce?"
faqA4: "Recipes often use ml for precision, especially in professional or European cooking, while cups are more common in home cooking, particularly in the US. When using air fryer recipes from different sources, it's helpful to know both measurements. Many modern recipes include both for convenience."

<p>910 ml of tomato sauce equals approximately 3.85 cups in the US measurement system or 3.6 cups in the UK. This conversion is essential for recipes where precision matters, especially when using an air fryer for dishes like pasta bakes or homemade pizzas.

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter</h2>
<p>When cooking with an air fryer, precise measurements can make or break a dish. Too much tomato sauce can make your meal soggy, while too little can leave it dry. For example, if you're making a <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipe</a>, the right amount of sauce ensures even cooking and flavour distribution. Many air fryer recipes rely on specific liquid ratios to achieve the perfect texture, so getting your 910 ml of tomato sauce conversion right is key.</p>

<p>Tomato sauce is a staple in many dishes, from pasta to casseroles, and even <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a>. Whether you're cooking for one or meal prepping, knowing how many cups 910 ml of tomato sauce equals helps streamline your process. This is especially useful when scaling recipes up or down, ensuring consistency every time you cook.</p>

<h2>US vs UK Cup Measurements</h2>
<p>It's important to note that US and UK cup measurements differ slightly. In the US, 1 cup equals 240 ml, while in the UK, it's 250 ml.

<p>For air fryer cooking, this small difference can impact the outcome, especially in recipes where liquid ratios are critical. If you're adapting a US recipe to UK measurements, you might need to adjust slightly. Keeping a conversion chart handy, like the one on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, can save time and ensure accuracy.</p>

<h3>How to Measure Tomato Sauce Without a Measuring Cup</h3>

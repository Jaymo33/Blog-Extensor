Whether you're making a dessert or a savoury dish, knowing how to convert 360 ml of condensed milk to cups ensures your recipe turns out perfectly every time.</p>

<h2>Understanding the Conversion</h2>
<p>Converting millilitres to cups can be tricky, especially with ingredients like condensed milk, which has a thick consistency. For 360 ml of condensed milk, the standard conversion is 1.5 cups. This measurement is based on the UK metric cup, which holds 240 ml.

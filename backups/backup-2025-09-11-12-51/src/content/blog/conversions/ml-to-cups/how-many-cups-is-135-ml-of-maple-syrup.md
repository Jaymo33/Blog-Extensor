faqQ1: "Can I use 135 ml of maple syrup interchangeably with honey in air fryer recipes?"
faqA1: "Yes, you can substitute 135 ml of maple syrup with honey in most air fryer recipes. Both are liquid sweeteners with similar consistencies, though honey is slightly sweeter. Adjust cooking times slightly, as honey may caramelise faster under the air fryer's high heat."
faqQ2: "How do I store leftover maple syrup after measuring 135 ml?"
faqA2: "Store opened maple syrup in the fridge to prevent mould growth. Pour any leftover syrup from your 135 ml measurement into an airtight container. It keeps for up to a year refrigerated. Warm slightly before reusing if it thickens."
faqQ3: "Why does my air fryer recipe taste too sweet with 135 ml of maple syrup?"
faqA3: "Air fryers intensify flavours due to concentrated heat circulation. If 135 ml (0.57 cups) of maple syrup makes your dish too sweet, reduce it by a tablespoon or balance it with acidic ingredients like lemon juice or vinegar."
faqQ4: "Can I measure 135 ml of maple syrup by weight instead of volume?"
faqA4: "Yes, 135 ml of maple syrup weighs about 170 grams. Using a kitchen scale ensures accuracy, especially for baking. This method avoids sticky measuring cups and is handy for large batches."

<h2>Understanding Coconut Oil Measurements</h2>  
<p>Coconut oil is a staple in many kitchens, especially for those who love air frying or baking. Measuring it accurately ensures your dishes have the right texture and flavour. While millilitres (ml) are commonly used in the UK, cups are a popular measurement in the US and other regions. If you're using an air fryer, precise measurements matter even more, as the cooking process is faster and more intense.

This small difference can affect your results, especially in delicate recipes like cakes or pastries. Always double-check which cup measurement your recipe uses to avoid confusion.</p>  

<h3>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Frying</h3>

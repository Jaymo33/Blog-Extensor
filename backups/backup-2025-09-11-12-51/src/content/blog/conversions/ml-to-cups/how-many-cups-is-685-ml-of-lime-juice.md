faqQ1: "Can I use bottled lime juice instead of fresh for 685 ml measurements?"
faqA1: "Yes, bottled lime juice works if fresh isn’t available. However, check the label for concentration—some brands require dilution. For best results in air fryer recipes, adjust sweetness or salt to balance bottled juice’s sharper taste."
faqQ2: "How many limes do I need to make 685 ml of juice?"
faqA2: "About 18-20 medium limes yield 685 ml (2.9 cups) of juice. Roll limes firmly before juicing to maximise extraction. For efficiency, consider a citrus press or electric juicer when preparing large quantities."
faqQ3: "Does 685 ml of lime juice change weight when converted to cups?"
faqA3: "No, the weight remains consistent—685 ml of lime juice weighs approximately 700 grams. Cups measure volume, so the conversion (2.9 cups) reflects space occupied, not mass. This is useful for recipes specifying weight."
faqQ4: "Can I freeze leftover 685 ml portions of lime juice?"
faqA4: "Absolutely! Freeze 685 ml portions in ice cube trays or airtight containers for up to 6 months. Thaw in the fridge before use. Frozen juice works well in cooked dishes but may lose some freshness in uncooked sauces."

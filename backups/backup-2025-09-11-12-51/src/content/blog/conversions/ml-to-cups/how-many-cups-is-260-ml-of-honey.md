faqQ1: "Is 260 ml of honey the same as 260 grams?"
faqA1: "No, honey’s density means 260 ml weighs roughly 360 grams. Millilitres measure volume, while grams measure weight. For precise baking, use a scale or stick to volume conversions like 260 ml to cups."
faqQ2: "Can I use a dry measuring cup for 260 ml of honey?"
faqA2: "It’s best to use a liquid measuring cup for honey, as its thickness can lead to uneven filling in dry cups. For 260 ml (1.1 cups), a clear liquid cup with a spout ensures accuracy and easy pouring."
faqQ3: "Why does my 260 ml of honey look less than 1.1 cups?"
faqA3: "Honey’s sticky texture can trap air bubbles, making it appear underfilled. Gently tap the cup or stir to settle it. Temperature also affects volume—warmer honey flows more smoothly into the cup."
faqQ4: "How do I adjust recipes if I only have 200 ml of honey?"
faqA4: "For 200 ml (0.85 cups), reduce other liquids slightly to balance moisture. Alternatively, mix with golden syrup or maple syrup to reach 260 ml. Check our conversion chart for more substitutes."

<p>260 ml of honey is approximately 1.1 cups. This conversion is essential for baking and cooking, especially when using precise measurements in recipes for air fryers or traditional ovens. Whether you're whipping up a cake or glazing chicken, knowing how 260 ml translates to cups ensures consistent results every time.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Honey Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Honey is a staple in many recipes, from sweet desserts to savoury glazes. Its thick, sticky consistency means even small measurement errors can affect texture and taste. For air fryer recipes, where precision is key, converting 260 ml of honey to cups correctly ensures your dishes turn out perfectly. Visit <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes</a> for honey-infused dishes that rely on accurate measurements.</p>  

<p>Using too much or too little honey can alter moisture levels, browning, and caramelisation. For example, a marinade with 260 ml of honey (1.1 cups) will coat evenly, while an incorrect measurement might leave your dish overly sweet or dry. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for other common ingredient swaps.</p>  

<h2>How to Measure 260 ml of Honey Without a Scale</h2>  
<p>If you don’t have a kitchen scale, use a liquid measuring cup for 260 ml of honey. Coat the cup with a light oil spray to help the honey slide out easily. For sticky ingredients like honey, a silicone spatula ensures you scrape every last bit, making your 260 ml to cups conversion as accurate as possible.</p>  

<h3>US vs. UK Cup Measurements</h3>  
<p>In the UK, 1 cup equals 284 ml, while in the US, it’s 240 ml. For 260 ml of honey, this means roughly 0.92 UK cups or 1.1 US cups. Always check your recipe’s origin to avoid discrepancies.

<h2>Common Recipes Using 260 ml of Honey</h2>  
<p>Many dishes call for around 260 ml of honey, such as honey-glazed salmon or spiced cakes. In an air fryer, this quantity ensures even caramelisation without burning. For example, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>honey-mustard chicken</a> uses 260 ml (1.1 cups) for the perfect balance of sweetness and tang.</p>  

<p>Honey’s viscosity means 260 ml won’t always fill a cup uniformly. Stirring or warming it slightly can help it settle evenly. Need a cleaning tip after sticky honey spills?

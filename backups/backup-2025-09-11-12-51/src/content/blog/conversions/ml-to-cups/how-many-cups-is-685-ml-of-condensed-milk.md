faqQ1: "Is 685 ml of condensed milk the same as one standard tin?"
faqA1: "Yes, in many countries, 685 ml is the standard size for a tin of condensed milk. It's commonly used in recipes, so you'll often see measurements calling for \"one tin\" or \"one can\" of condensed milk, which typically refers to 685 ml."
faqQ2: "Can I use evaporated milk instead of condensed milk in a 685 ml measurement?"
faqA2: "No, evaporated milk and condensed milk are not interchangeable. Condensed milk is sweetened and much thicker, while evaporated milk is unsweetened and has a lighter consistency. Substituting one for the other will significantly alter the taste and texture of your dish."
faqQ3: "How do I measure 685 ml of condensed milk without a measuring jug?"
faqA3: "If you don't have a measuring jug, use standard tablespoons. 685 ml is roughly 46 tablespoons. Alternatively, use a kitchen scale—685 ml of condensed milk weighs about 800 grams."
faqQ4: "Why do UK and US cup measurements differ for 685 ml of condensed milk?"
faqA4: "The difference stems from historical measurement standards. A UK cup is 284 ml, while a US cup is 240 ml. This means 685 ml converts to slightly different cup measurements depending on which system you're using. Always check your recipe's origin to ensure accuracy."

<p>685 ml of condensed milk is roughly equivalent to 2.9 cups in the UK and 2.8 cups in the US. This conversion is essential for baking and cooking, especially when using an air fryer, where precise measurements can make or break a recipe. Whether you're whipping up a cake or a creamy dessert, knowing how to convert 685 ml of condensed milk to cups ensures consistency and delicious results every time.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>When baking or cooking, especially with an air fryer, precision is key. Too much or too little condensed milk can alter the texture and taste of your dish. For example, if you're making a <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>creamy caramel flan</a>, the right amount of condensed milk ensures the perfect consistency. Similarly, for <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>desserts like fudge or cheesecake</a>, accurate measurements guarantee the ideal sweetness and structure.</p>  

<p>Condensed milk is thicker and denser than regular milk, so volume conversions aren't always straightforward. Using a measuring jug or kitchen scale can help, but knowing the cup equivalent saves time and reduces errors. If you're unsure, refer to our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for other common measurements.</p>  

<h2>UK vs. US Cup Measurements</h2>  
<p>In the UK, 1 cup equals 284 ml, while in the US, it's 240 ml. This means 685 ml of condensed milk converts to approximately 2.9 cups in the UK and 2.8 cups in the US. The slight difference might not seem significant, but for recipes requiring exact proportions, it's worth noting. Always check whether your recipe uses UK or US measurements to avoid discrepancies.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure Without a Scale</h3>  
<p>If you don't have a kitchen scale, use a liquid measuring cup for accuracy. Pour the condensed milk slowly, ensuring it settles evenly. For sticky ingredients like condensed milk, lightly greasing the cup can help it slide out easily. Alternatively, use tablespoons—685 ml is about 46 tablespoons, which can be handy for smaller adjustments.</p>  

<h2>Common Recipes Using 685 ml of Condensed Milk</h2>  
<p>Condensed milk is a staple in many desserts and baked goods. A 685 ml tin is often used in recipes like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>banoffee pie</a>, where the creamy texture is crucial. It's also perfect for making ice cream, truffles, or even <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning your air fryer</a> after a sticky baking session.</p>  

<p>For air fryer enthusiasts, condensed milk can be used to glaze pastries or create caramelised toppings. Just remember to adjust cooking times slightly, as sugary mixtures can brown faster. Always keep an eye on your dish to prevent burning.</p>  

<h3>Storing Leftover Condensed Milk</h3>  
<p>If you don't use the entire 685 ml, transfer the leftovers to an airtight container and refrigerate. It stays fresh for up to a week and can be reused in coffee, oatmeal, or as a sweetener for other recipes. Avoid freezing condensed milk, as it can separate and lose its smooth texture.</p>

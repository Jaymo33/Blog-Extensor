faqQ1: "Is 285 ml of milk the same as 1 cup?"
faqA1: "No, 285 ml of milk is slightly more than 1 cup. In the UK, 1 cup is 250 ml, so 285 ml equals about 1.1 cups. In the US, 1 cup is 240 ml, making 285 ml roughly 1.2 cups. Always check your recipe's measurement system for accuracy."

faqQ3: "Does the type of milk affect the 285 ml to cups conversion?"
faqA3: "No, the conversion stays the same whether you use cow’s milk, almond milk, or oat milk. However, thicker milks (like coconut) may require slight recipe adjustments for texture."

<h2>Why Accurate Milk Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Precision is key when using an air fryer, as even small measurement errors can affect texture and cooking times. For example, adding too much milk to a batter can make it too runny, while too little can dry it out. Recipes on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> often rely on exact measurements for consistent results. Converting 285 ml of milk to cups ensures your dishes turn out just right.</p>  

<p>Many air fryer recipes, like those in our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>cake category</a>, call for milk as a key ingredient.

<h2>How to Measure 285 ml of Milk Without a Measuring Cup</h2>  
<p>If you don’t have a measuring cup, you can use a kitchen scale. Since milk’s density is close to water, 285 ml weighs roughly 285 grams.

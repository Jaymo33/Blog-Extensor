faqQ1: "Is 960 ml of evaporated milk the same as regular milk in cups?"
faqA1: "No, evaporated milk is more concentrated than regular milk due to the removal of water. However, the volume measurement (960 ml) converts to the same number of cups as regular milk. In the US, 960 ml equals about 4.06 cups, while in the UK, it's 3.38 cups."
faqQ2: "Can I use a measuring jug instead of cups for 960 ml of evaporated milk?"
faqA2: "Yes, a measuring jug with millilitre markings is the most accurate way to measure 960 ml of evaporated milk. If your recipe calls for cups, simply convert using the correct ratio (1 US cup = 240 ml, 1 UK cup = 284 ml)."
faqQ3: "Does the type of cup (US or UK) affect air fryer recipes?"
faqA3: "Yes, using the wrong cup measurement can alter liquid ratios in your recipe, affecting cooking times and textures in the air fryer. Always check whether your recipe uses US or UK measurements and convert 960 ml of evaporated milk accordingly."
faqQ4: "What if I only have a 250 ml measuring cup for 960 ml of evaporated milk?"
faqA4: "If using a 250 ml cup, measure out 3 full cups (750 ml) and then add 210 ml (just under a cup) to reach 960 ml. For greater accuracy, use a jug with millilitre markings or a kitchen scale for precise measurements."

<h3>Why Accuracy Matters in Air Fryer Cooking</h3>  
<p>Air fryers rely on circulating hot air to cook food evenly, and liquid measurements play a big role in this. Using the correct amount of evaporated milk ensures your dishes have the right consistency. For example, adding too much milk to a batter can make it too runny, while too little can leave it dry.

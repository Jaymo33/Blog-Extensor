faqQ1: "How do I measure 10 ml of lemon juice without a measuring cup?"
faqA1: "You can use a standard teaspoon, as 10 ml is roughly 2 teaspoons. Alternatively, a medicine syringe or small kitchen scale set to grams (10 ml â‰ˆ 10 g for lemon juice) works well. For air fryer recipes, precision ensures even cooking."
faqQ2: "Does bottled lemon juice measure the same as fresh?"
faqA2: "Yes, 10 ml of bottled lemon juice equals 10 ml of fresh, but flavour intensity may vary. Fresh juice often tastes brighter, while bottled may contain preservatives. For air frying, fresh is preferred for marinades or glazes."
faqQ3: "Can I substitute lime juice for lemon juice in the same amount?"
faqA3: "Yes, 10 ml of lime juice can replace lemon juice, but expect a slightly different flavour profile. Lime is more floral, while lemon is sharper. Adjust to taste, especially in air fryer dishes where acidity affects browning."
faqQ4: "Why do some recipes use ml and others use cups for lemon juice?"
faqA4: "Recipes from the UK and Europe typically use millilitres, while US recipes favour cups. For small amounts like 10 ml, metric measurements are more precise. Always convert carefully for air fryer recipes to avoid imbalances."

<p>10 ml of lemon juice equals approximately 0.042 cups. This small measurement is crucial for recipes where precision matters, especially in baking or air frying. Whether you're making a zesty marinade or a tangy dessert, knowing this conversion ensures your dish turns out just right. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we understand how vital accurate measurements are for perfect results every time.</p>  

<h2>Understanding Lemon Juice Measurements</h2>  
<p>Lemon juice is often measured in millilitres (ml) or cups, depending on the recipe. For small quantities like 10 ml, using a measuring spoon or jug with clear markings is best. If you're working with an air fryer, precise liquid measurements prevent soggy or unevenly cooked food. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for other common measurement swaps. This ensures your dishes, from glazes to dressings, are consistently delicious.</p>  

<p>Recipes from the UK or US may use different measurement systems, so conversions are essential. For example, 10 ml of lemon juice is roughly 2 teaspoons, which is easier to visualise. If you're adapting a recipe for your air fryer, always double-check the quantities. A slight imbalance in acidity can affect the texture and taste of baked goods or meats. Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a> for dishes that use lemon juice perfectly.</p>  

<h3>Why Accuracy Matters in Air Frying</h3>  
<p>Air fryers circulate hot air rapidly, so liquids evaporate faster than in conventional ovens. Using too much lemon juice can lead to overly dry or tart results. Conversely, too little might leave your dish lacking flavour. Measuring 10 ml of lemon juice correctly ensures balanced acidity and moisture.

This small difference matters in international recipes. If you're preparing a marinade for air-fried salmon, precision ensures the fish isn't overpowered by citrus.

If your air fryer dessert calls for lemon juice, stick to the exact amount to avoid altering the chemical reactions in baking. A <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>properly cleaned air fryer</a> also ensures no residual flavours interfere with delicate citrus notes.</p>  

<h3>Common Uses for 10 ml of Lemon Juice</h3>

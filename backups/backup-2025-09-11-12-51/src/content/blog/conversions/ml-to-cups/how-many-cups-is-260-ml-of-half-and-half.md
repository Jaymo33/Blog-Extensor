faqQ1: "Is 260 ml of half and half the same as 1 cup?"
faqA1: "No, 260 ml of half and half is approximately 1.1 cups. A standard US cup is 240 ml, so 260 ml is slightly more. For precise baking or air fryer recipes, it’s best to measure accurately."
faqQ2: "Can I use milk instead of half and half in recipes?"
faqA2: "You can substitute milk, but the texture and richness will differ. Half and half contains more fat, which affects creaminess. For best results, stick to the recipe or adjust other ingredients accordingly."
faqQ3: "How do I measure 260 ml of half and half without a measuring cup?"
faqA3: "If you don’t have a measuring cup, use a kitchen scale. Half and half weighs roughly 1 gram per ml, so 260 ml equals 260 grams. Alternatively, use a tablespoon (15 ml) and measure out 17.3 tablespoons."
faqQ4: "Why do air fryer recipes often use half and half?"
faqA4: "Half and half adds richness and moisture to air fryer dishes without making them soggy. It’s perfect for creamy sauces, custards, and baked goods, enhancing flavour while maintaining texture."

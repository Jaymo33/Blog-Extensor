faqQ1: "Is 285 ml of honey the same as 1.2 cups in all countries?"
faqA1: "No, cup sizes vary by region. In the UK, 285 ml of honey is about 1.14 cups (250 ml per cup), while in the US, it’s roughly 1.19 cups (240 ml per cup). For air fryer recipes, always check which measurement system your recipe uses to ensure accuracy."
faqQ2: "Can I use a regular cup to measure 285 ml of honey?"

<h2>Why Accurate Honey Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of honey in your air fryer recipes ensures balanced flavours and textures. Too much honey can make dishes overly sweet or sticky, while too little might leave them bland.

Converting 285 ml of honey to cups (1.2 cups) helps maintain this balance, whether you’re baking or cooking.</p>  

<p>Honey’s viscosity means it doesn’t pour like water, making measuring tricky. A kitchen scale can help, but if you’re using cups, levelling off the honey ensures accuracy.

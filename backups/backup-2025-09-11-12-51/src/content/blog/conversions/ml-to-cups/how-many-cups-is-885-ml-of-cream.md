<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter</h2>
<p>When it comes to cooking or baking, especially with an air fryer, precision is key. Using the correct amount of cream can make or break a recipe. Too much or too little can affect texture, flavour, and even cooking time. For example, a creamy sauce or a fluffy cake relies heavily on the right proportions. That's why converting 885 ml of cream to cups accurately is so important.</p>
<p>At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we understand the importance of precise measurements.

<h2>UK vs. US Cup Measurements</h2>
<p>It's worth noting that cup measurements differ between the UK and the US. In the UK, 1 cup is 250 ml, while in the US, it's 240 ml. This means 885 ml of cream converts to 3.74 cups in the UK and 3.5 cups in the US. Always check which measurement system your recipe uses to avoid mistakes.</p>
<p>For those using an air fryer, this distinction is particularly important. Many recipes, especially those from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>our collection</a>, may specify measurements in cups or millilitres. Knowing the difference ensures your air fryer dishes are consistent and delicious.</p>

<h3>How to Measure Cream Without a Scale</h3>
<p>If you don't have a scale, you can still measure 885 ml of cream using a measuring jug or cups. Simply fill the jug to the 885 ml mark or use the cup equivalents mentioned earlier. For best results, use a clear measuring jug with millilitre markings for accuracy.</p>

<h2>Common Uses for 885 ml of Cream</h2>
<p>885 ml of cream is a versatile ingredient in both sweet and savoury dishes. From creamy pasta sauces to decadent desserts, this quantity is often used in recipes serving 4-6 people. In the air fryer, it's perfect for making creamy dips, custards, or even whipped cream toppings.</p>

<h3>Tips for Storing Leftover Cream</h3>
<p>If you don't use all 885 ml of cream at once, store the remainder in an airtight container in the fridge. It should stay fresh for up to 3 days. For longer storage, consider freezing it in portion-sized containers. Just give it a good stir after thawing to restore its texture.</p>

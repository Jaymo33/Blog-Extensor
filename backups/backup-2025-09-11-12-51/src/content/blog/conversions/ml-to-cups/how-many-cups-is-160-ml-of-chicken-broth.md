faqQ1: "Is 160 ml of chicken broth the same as 160 grams?"
faqA1: "No, millilitres (ml) measure volume, while grams measure weight. Chicken broth’s weight can vary slightly based on salt content, but 160 ml typically weighs around 164 grams due to its density. For air fryer recipes, stick to volume measurements unless specified otherwise."
faqQ2: "Can I use water instead of 160 ml chicken broth in air fryer recipes?"
faqA2: "Yes, but the flavour will be less rich. Chicken broth adds depth to dishes like marinades or roasted vegetables. If substituting, consider adding herbs or a splash of soy sauce to compensate. For broth-free ideas, try our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable recipes</a>."
faqQ3: "How do I measure 160 ml of chicken broth without a measuring cup?"
faqA3: "Use a tablespoon (15 ml): 10 tablespoons plus 2 teaspoons equal 160 ml. Alternatively, a standard US coffee mug holds ~240 ml, so fill it two-thirds full. For accuracy, invest in a cheap metric measuring jug—it’s a game-changer for air fryer cooking."
faqQ4: "Does 160 ml of chicken broth differ between UK and US cups?"
faqA4: "No, 160 ml equals ~0.68 cups in both systems. The UK uses metric cups (250 ml), while the US uses customary cups (240 ml), but the difference is negligible for small amounts like 160 ml. Always use the same measuring system for consistency in recipes."

<p>160 ml of chicken broth equals approximately 0.68 cups (just over 2/3 cup). This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes, where precise liquid measurements can make or break a dish. Whether you're making a marinade, soup, or sauce, knowing how to convert millilitres to cups ensures consistent results every time.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on even heat distribution, and incorrect liquid measurements can throw off cooking times or textures. For example, adding too much chicken broth to a marinade might make food soggy, while too little could dry it out. Recipes on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> often specify ml or cups, so understanding conversions like 160 ml of chicken broth to cups is crucial.</p>  

<p>Many UK cooks use millilitres, while American recipes often list cups. If you're following an international recipe, this conversion ensures you won’t need to guess.

<h3>How to Measure 160 ml of Chicken Broth Without a Scale</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a measuring jug, use a standard metric cup (250 ml) and fill it just over halfway for 160 ml. Alternatively, 6 tablespoons plus 2 teaspoons of chicken broth will also give you roughly 160 ml. For recipes requiring precision, like those in our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipe category</a>, measuring tools are best.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for 160 ml of Chicken Broth in Air Fryer Recipes</h2>  
<p>This amount is perfect for deglazing pans, creating sauces, or marinating proteins. For instance, 160 ml of chicken broth can be mixed with herbs for a flavourful baste for air-fried chicken thighs. It’s also ideal for cooking grains like quinoa directly in the air fryer, ensuring they stay moist.</p>  

<p>Many <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> users love using chicken broth to add depth to roasted vegetables. Tossing potatoes or mushrooms in 160 ml of broth before air frying enhances their flavour without excess oil.

<h3>Does Chicken Broth Brand Affect the Measurement?</h3>  
<p>No—160 ml of any chicken broth (homemade, canned, or powdered) will always equal ~0.68 cups. However, thicker broths may cling to measuring tools, so lightly grease the cup for accuracy. For cleaning sticky residues, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner guide</a> has handy tips.</p>  

<h2>Converting Other Chicken Broth Amounts</h2>

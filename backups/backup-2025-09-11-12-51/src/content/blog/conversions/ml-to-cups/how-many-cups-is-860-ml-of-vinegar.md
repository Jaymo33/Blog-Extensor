<h2>Why Accurate Vinegar Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of vinegar can make or break a dish. Too little, and your marinade lacks punch; too much, and it overpowers other flavours. For air fryer recipes, precise measurements ensure even cooking and balanced taste. If you're following a recipe from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>our collection</a>, getting the vinegar quantity spot-on is key. This is especially true for dishes like crispy chicken wings or tangy glazed vegetables.</p>  

<p>Vinegar also plays a role in cleaning your air fryer. A 50-50 mix of vinegar and water is often recommended for descaling. Knowing how to convert 860 ml of vinegar to cups helps you prepare the right amount without waste.

<h3>US vs. UK Cup Measurements</h3>  
<p>It's worth noting that US and UK cup measurements differ slightly. A US cup holds 240 ml, while a UK cup is 284 ml. For 860 ml of vinegar, the conversion is roughly 3.63 US cups or 3.03 UK cups. Most modern recipes, including those on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>our site</a>, use US measurements unless specified otherwise.</p>  

<h2>How to Measure 860 ml of Vinegar Without a Scale</h2>  
<p>If you don’t have a measuring jug, you can use standard cups to measure 860 ml of vinegar. Fill a cup to the 240 ml mark three times, then add about half a cup more. For greater precision, use a liquid measuring cup with millilitre markings. This method is handy when preparing dressings for air-fryer salads or marinades for proteins like chicken or tofu.</p>  

<p>Another trick is to repurpose a clean, empty vinegar bottle with known measurements. If your bottle has millilitre markings, you can pour directly from it.

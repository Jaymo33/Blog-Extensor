faqQ1: "Is 85 ml of corn syrup the same in the UK and US?"
faqA1: "Yes, 85 ml of corn syrup is the same volume in both the UK and US. However, cup sizes differ slightly—a US cup is 240 ml, while a UK cup is 250 ml. For 85 ml, the difference is negligible, so you can use the same conversion (approximately 0.36 cups) in both countries."
faqQ2: "Can I substitute golden syrup for corn syrup in an air fryer recipe?"
faqA2: "Yes, golden syrup can be used as a substitute for corn syrup in most recipes. Both are liquid sweeteners, though golden syrup has a richer, buttery flavour. Use the same measurement (85 ml or 0.36 cups) for a similar consistency. Adjust other sweeteners if needed to balance the taste."
faqQ3: "How do I clean my air fryer after using corn syrup?"
faqA3: "Corn syrup can leave sticky residue in your air fryer. To clean it, wipe the basket and tray with warm, soapy water immediately after use. For stubborn spots, soak the parts in warm water with a bit of baking soda. Avoid abrasive scrubbers to prevent damage to non-stick coatings."
faqQ4: "Why does my recipe call for corn syrup instead of sugar?"
faqA4: "Corn syrup prevents crystallisation, which is crucial in candies, frostings, and glazes. It also adds moisture and a smooth texture, making it ideal for air-fried desserts. Sugar can sometimes dry out or crystallise, altering the dish's texture. Always follow the recipe for best results."

<p>85 ml of corn syrup is approximately 0.36 cups. This conversion is essential for anyone using an air fryer or baking, where precise measurements can make or break a recipe. Whether you're whipping up a dessert or a savoury glaze, knowing how to convert millilitres to cups ensures consistency. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we understand the importance of accurate measurements, especially when working with sticky ingredients like corn syrup.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Corn syrup is a common ingredient in many air fryer recipes, from glazes to desserts. Using the correct amount ensures the right texture and sweetness. Too much or too little can throw off the balance of your dish. For example, if you're making air-fried doughnuts and the glaze is too thin, it won't stick properly. Conversely, if it's too thick, it might overpower the flavour. That's why converting 85 ml of corn syrup to cups correctly is crucial.</p>  

<p>Many UK recipes use millilitres, while others rely on cup measurements. This can be confusing, especially if you're following an international recipe. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> makes it easy to switch between units, so you never have to guess. Whether you're making sticky buns or a savoury glaze for meats, precision is key.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure 85 ml of Corn Syrup</h3>  
<p>Measuring corn syrup can be tricky due to its sticky consistency. For the most accurate results, use a liquid measuring cup with clear markings. Lightly grease the cup with oil to help the syrup slide out easily. Alternatively, weigh it on a kitchen scale—85 ml of corn syrup weighs roughly 115 grams. If you're using a standard US cup, remember that 1 cup equals 240 ml, so 85 ml is just over a third of a cup.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for 85 ml of Corn Syrup</h2>  
<p>Corn syrup is a versatile ingredient in both baking and air frying. It adds sweetness, moisture, and a glossy finish to dishes. For example, 85 ml of corn syrup is perfect for glazing air-fried ham or making a caramel sauce for desserts. It's also a key component in many <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert recipes</a>, like pecan pie or marshmallow treats.</p>  

<p>If you're making a marinade or sauce, 85 ml of corn syrup can help balance acidity and add depth. It's also great for preventing crystallisation in homemade candies or frostings.

faqQ3: "How many tablespoons are in 210 ml of beef stock?"
faqA3: "There are 14 tablespoons in 210 ml of beef stock (1 UK tablespoon = 15 ml). This is useful if you don’t have a measuring cup but need to portion stock for marinades or sauces in your air fryer."
faqQ4: "Do UK and US cup measurements differ for 210 ml of beef stock?"
faqA4: "Yes. While 210 ml is 0.89 US cups, it’s about 0.74 UK cups (1 UK cup = 284 ml). Most air fryer recipes use US measurements, so stick to those unless specified. Always check the recipe’s origin to avoid errors."

<h3>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h3>  
<p>Air fryers cook food quickly and evenly, but incorrect liquid measurements can lead to soggy or dry results.

This is especially important for recipes like air-fried beef casseroles or braised dishes, where liquid ratios affect cooking times.</p>  

<h2>How to Measure 210 ml of Beef Stock Without a Cup</h2>

<p>735 ml of coconut oil equals approximately 3.1 cups. This conversion is essential for accurate baking and air frying, ensuring your recipes turn out perfectly every time. Whether you're whipping up a batch of cookies or crisping vegetables in your air fryer, knowing how to measure coconut oil correctly is key.

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of coconut oil can make or break your recipe. Too little, and your dish might turn out dry; too much, and it could become greasy. This is especially important in air frying, where precise measurements ensure even cooking. For example, if you're making crispy potatoes, 735 ml of coconut oil (or 3.1 cups) should be enough to coat them evenly.

<p>Coconut oil is a versatile ingredient, but its density can vary slightly depending on temperature.

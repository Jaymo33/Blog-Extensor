faqQ1: "Can I use bottled lime juice instead of fresh for 60 ml measurements?"
faqA1: "Yes, bottled lime juice can substitute fresh lime juice in a 60 ml measurement, but the flavour may be less vibrant. Fresh lime juice offers a brighter, more natural taste, especially in air fryer marinades. If using bottled, check for additives like preservatives that might alter the dish’s flavour."
faqQ2: "How does 60 ml of lime juice affect cooking times in an air fryer?"
faqA2: "Lime juice in marinades or glazes doesn’t significantly alter air fryer cooking times, but it can enhance browning and flavour. Since air fryers cook quickly, the acidity helps tenderise meats without extending the timer. Just ensure excess liquid is patted dry to avoid steaming."
faqQ3: "What’s the best way to zest a lime if I need both juice and zest for a recipe?"
faqA3: "Zest the lime before juicing it to make the process easier. Use a fine grater or microplane to remove the green part of the peel, avoiding the bitter white pith. After zesting, cut and juice the lime to measure your 60 ml accurately."
faqQ4: "Can I freeze leftover lime juice for future air fryer recipes?"
faqA4: "Absolutely! Freeze 60 ml portions of lime juice in ice cube trays for easy use later. Thawed lime juice works well in marinades or sauces, though fresh is ideal for dressings. Label the cubes to avoid confusion in your freezer."

<h2>Why Accurate Lime Juice Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of lime juice is crucial for balancing flavours in dishes like ceviche, dressings, or air-fried chicken wings. Too little, and your dish may lack zest; too much, and it can become overpoweringly sour. Air fryer recipes, in particular, rely on precise liquid measurements to avoid soggy or unevenly cooked results. If you're experimenting with citrus-based marinades, accuracy ensures your food crisps up beautifully.

<p>Lime juice also plays a key role in tenderising meats and enhancing freshness in seafood dishes. When converting 60 ml of lime juice to cups, remember that slight variations can affect texture and taste. A 1/4 cup measurement is standard, but using a kitchen scale for ml-to-cup conversions adds extra precision. This is especially helpful for air fryer cooking, where consistency is key.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure 60 ml of Lime Juice Without a Measuring Cup</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a measuring cup handy, you can use tablespoons to approximate 60 ml of lime juice. Since 1 tablespoon equals 15 ml, four tablespoons will give you the equivalent of 60 ml (or 1/4 cup). For smaller quantities, a teaspoon holds 5 ml, so 12 teaspoons also equal 60 ml. This method works well for quick adjustments in air fryer recipes, such as adding a citrus kick to <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>air-fried chicken</a>.</p>

<h3>Converting 60 ml of Lime Juice in UK vs. US Measurements</h3>  
<p>While 60 ml of lime juice equals 0.25 cups in both UK and US measurements, cup sizes can vary slightly in other contexts.

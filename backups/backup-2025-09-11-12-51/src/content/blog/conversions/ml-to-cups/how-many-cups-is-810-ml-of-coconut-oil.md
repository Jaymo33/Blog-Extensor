faqQ1: "Can I use 810 ml of coconut oil interchangeably with other oils in my air fryer?"
faqA1: "Yes, you can substitute 810 ml of coconut oil (3.42 cups) with other oils like vegetable or olive oil. However, coconut oil has a distinct flavour and higher smoke point, making it ideal for air frying. Adjust quantities based on the oil’s density for best results."
faqQ2: "How do I measure 810 ml of coconut oil if I don’t have a measuring cup?"
faqA2: "If you don’t have a measuring cup, use a kitchen scale. Coconut oil weighs roughly 0.92 grams per ml, so 810 ml equals about 745 grams. Alternatively, use tablespoons (1 cup = 16 tbsp), but this is less precise for large quantities like 810 ml."
faqQ3: "Does the type of coconut oil (refined vs. unrefined) affect the 810 ml to cups conversion?"
faqA3: "No, the conversion remains the same—810 ml of coconut oil equals 3.42 cups regardless of refinement. However, refined coconut oil has a neutral flavour, while unrefined adds a coconut taste. Choose based on your recipe’s requirements."
faqQ4: "Why is my air fryer recipe turning out greasy with 810 ml of coconut oil?"
faqA4: "If your dish is greasy, you might be using too much oil. While 810 ml of coconut oil equals 3.42 cups, some recipes require less. Always follow measurements closely and adjust based on your air fryer’s size and the food’s absorbency."

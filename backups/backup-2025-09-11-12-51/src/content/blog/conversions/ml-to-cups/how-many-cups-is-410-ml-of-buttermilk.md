faqQ1: "Is 410 ml of buttermilk the same in the UK and US?"
faqA1: "Yes, 410 ml of buttermilk is the same volume in both the UK and US. However, cup sizes differ slightly—the UK uses 284 ml per cup, while the US uses 240 ml. For accuracy, always specify which cup measurement you're using."
faqQ2: "Can I substitute regular milk for buttermilk in a 410 ml measurement?"
faqA2: "Yes, but you’ll need to add 1 tablespoon of lemon juice or vinegar per 240 ml of milk to mimic buttermilk’s acidity. For 410 ml, use about 1.5 tablespoons of acid. Let it sit for 5 minutes before using."
faqQ3: "How do I store leftover buttermilk after measuring 410 ml?"
faqA3: "Store leftover buttermilk in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 2 weeks. You can also freeze it in ice cube trays for longer storage, then thaw as needed for future recipes."
faqQ4: "Why does my air fryer recipe call for 410 ml of buttermilk specifically?"
faqA4: "410 ml (about 1.73 cups) is often used because it’s enough to coat proteins evenly or hydrate dry ingredients without making the mixture too wet. This balance is crucial for air fryer cooking, where excess moisture can lead to steaming instead of crisping."

For example, if you're making buttermilk fried chicken in your air fryer, the right amount ensures a crispy exterior and juicy interior.</p>

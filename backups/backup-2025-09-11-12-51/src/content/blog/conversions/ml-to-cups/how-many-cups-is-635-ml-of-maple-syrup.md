faqQ1: "Is 635 ml of maple syrup the same in US and UK cups?"
faqA1: "No, there’s a slight difference. In the US, 1 cup equals 237 ml, so 635 ml is about 2.68 cups. In the UK, 1 cup is 250 ml, making 635 ml closer to 2.54 cups. Always check which measurement system your recipe uses."
faqQ2: "Can I use a dry measuring cup for maple syrup?"
faqA2: "You can, but it’s not ideal. Maple syrup is sticky and thick, so a liquid measuring cup with a spout works better. If using dry cups, spoon the syrup in gently to avoid air gaps and ensure accuracy."
faqQ3: "How do I prevent maple syrup from burning in the air fryer?"
faqA3: "To avoid burning, reduce the amount of syrup slightly or lower the cooking temperature. Brush the syrup on towards the end of cooking, and keep an eye on it—sugary glazes caramelise quickly."
faqQ4: "What’s the best way to clean maple syrup residue from my air fryer?"
faqA4: "Wipe the basket with warm, soapy water immediately after use. For stubborn residue, soak the basket or use a non-abrasive sponge. Check our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning guide</a> for more tips."

<p>635 ml of maple syrup is roughly equivalent to 2.68 cups. This conversion is essential for anyone baking or cooking with maple syrup, especially when using an air fryer where precise measurements can make all the difference. Whether you're whipping up a glaze for air-fried salmon or sweetening a dessert, knowing this conversion ensures perfect results every time.</p>  

<h2>Understanding Maple Syrup Measurements</h2>  
<p>Maple syrup is a thick, sticky liquid, which means measuring it accurately can be tricky. Unlike water, it doesn’t pour as easily, so using the right tools is key. A liquid measuring cup with a spout is ideal, but if you only have dry measuring cups, gently spoon the syrup in to avoid air gaps. For air fryer recipes, precision matters—too much syrup can lead to overly sticky or burnt results.</p>  

<p>When converting 635 ml of maple syrup to cups, it’s important to note that 1 cup equals 237 ml in the US and 250 ml in the UK. This slight difference can affect recipes, so always check which measurement system your recipe uses. If you're following a recipe from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, it likely follows UK measurements, meaning 635 ml is closer to 2.54 cups.</p>  

<h3>Why Accurate Measurement Matters in Air Fryer Cooking</h3>  
<p>Air fryers circulate hot air rapidly, which means ingredients cook faster and more evenly. Too much maple syrup can cause excessive caramelisation or even burning, while too little might leave your dish lacking flavour. For best results, measure carefully and adjust based on your air fryer’s performance.

<h2>Converting 635 ml of Maple Syrup for Baking</h2>  
<p>Baking with maple syrup requires precision, as it affects both sweetness and moisture. If a recipe calls for 635 ml of maple syrup and you’re using cups, aim for 2.68 cups (US) or 2.54 cups (UK). For sticky ingredients like syrup, lightly greasing your measuring cup can help it slide out easily, ensuring you get the full amount without waste.</p>  

<p>If you’re adapting a traditional oven recipe for your air fryer, remember that air fryers cook faster. You might need to reduce the syrup slightly to prevent over-browning. Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> for inspiration on how to use maple syrup in dishes like glazed carrots or air-fried pancakes.</p>  

<h3>Tips for Measuring Sticky Ingredients</h3>  
<p>To measure maple syrup cleanly, warm the syrup slightly—this makes it less viscous and easier to pour. Alternatively, use a silicone spatula to scrape every last bit from the cup. Sticky residues can be tough to clean, so check our guide on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner</a> for hassle-free maintenance.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for 635 ml of Maple Syrup</h2>  
<p>Maple syrup isn’t just for pancakes—it’s a versatile sweetener for marinades, glazes, and even cocktails. In the air fryer, it works beautifully with proteins like chicken or tofu. For a quick weeknight meal, try brushing 635 ml (about 2.68 cups) of maple syrup over air-fried chicken wings for a sticky, sweet finish.</p>  

<p>If you’re meal prepping, maple syrup can also be used in dressings or as a natural sweetener for roasted vegetables. Browse our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipes</a> for ideas on incorporating maple syrup into your air fryer dishes. The key is balancing sweetness with other flavours to avoid overpowering your meal.</p>  

<h3>Adjusting Recipes for Different Air Fryer Models</h3>  
<p>Not all air fryers are created equal—some run hotter or cook faster than others. If you’re using 635 ml of maple syrup in a recipe, start with a slightly smaller amount and adjust as needed. Keep an eye on cooking times, as sugary glazes can burn quickly under high heat.</p>

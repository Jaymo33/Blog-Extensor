faqQ1: "Is 235 ml of water exactly 1 cup?"
faqA1: "In the US, 1 cup is 240 ml, so 235 ml is just under 1 cup (about 0.98 cups). In the UK, 1 cup is 284 ml, making 235 ml roughly 0.99 cups. For most air fryer recipes, this small difference won’t affect the outcome."
faqQ2: "Can I use a mug to measure 235 ml of water?"
faqA2: "Yes, a standard UK mug holds around 250 ml, so filling it just shy of the top will give you close to 235 ml. For baking, though, a measuring jug or scale is more accurate."
faqQ3: "Why do air fryer recipes sometimes need less water than oven recipes?"
faqA3: "Air fryers circulate hot air rapidly, causing liquids to evaporate faster. If a traditional recipe calls for 235 ml of water, you might reduce it slightly in an air fryer to prevent excess moisture."
faqQ4: "How do I convert 235 ml of water to grams?"
faqA4: "Water’s density is 1 g/ml, so 235 ml of water weighs exactly 235 grams. This makes scaling recipes easy if you’re using a kitchen scale for precision."

<p>235 ml of water equals approximately 1 cup (US) or 0.99 cups (UK). Getting this conversion right is essential for air fryer recipes, where precise measurements can make or break your dish. Whether you're baking cakes or preparing sauces, knowing how to convert millilitres to cups ensures consistency and perfect results every time.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Using the correct amount of water in air fryer recipes is crucial for texture and taste. Too much liquid can lead to soggy results, while too little may cause dryness. For example, when making air fryer cakes or steamed dishes, 235 ml of water (or just under 1 cup) is often the sweet spot. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for other common measurements.</p>  

<p>Many air fryer recipes, like those for <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>cakes</a> or batters, rely on precise liquid ratios. A slight miscalculation can affect rise and browning. Measuring 235 ml of water correctly ensures your dishes turn out light, fluffy, and evenly cooked.</p>  

<h3>US vs. UK Cup Measurements</h3>  
<p>It’s important to note that US and UK cup sizes differ slightly. A US cup holds 240 ml, while a UK cup is 284 ml. This means 235 ml of water is nearly 1 US cup but roughly 0.99 UK cups. For most air fryer recipes, this small difference won’t matter, but for baking, it’s worth using a measuring jug for accuracy.</p>  

<h2>How to Measure 235 ml of Water Without a Measuring Cup</h2>  
<p>If you don’t have a measuring cup, you can use a standard mug or scale. A typical UK mug holds about 250 ml, so filling it just below the brim will give you close to 235 ml. Alternatively, weigh the water—235 ml weighs 235 grams, as water’s density is 1 g/ml.</p>  

<p>For air fryer recipes like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>steamed vegetables</a>, eyeballing the water can work, but for baking, precision is key. Consider investing in a digital scale or a graduated measuring jug for foolproof results.</p>  

<h3>Common Recipes Using 235 ml of Water</h3>  
<p>Many air fryer recipes call for around 235 ml of water, such as batter for onion rings or steam-cooked dishes. When preparing <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a>, always check if the measurement is in millilitres or cups to avoid confusion.</p>  

<h2>Tips for Converting ml to Cups in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>When converting 235 ml of water to cups, remember that air fryers cook faster than conventional ovens, so liquids evaporate quicker. If a recipe calls for 1 cup (235 ml) of water, you might need slightly less in an air fryer to prevent sogginess. Always adjust based on your model’s power.</p>

Always measure 235 ml of water carefully for cakes, custards, or steamed puddings to ensure perfect results.</p>

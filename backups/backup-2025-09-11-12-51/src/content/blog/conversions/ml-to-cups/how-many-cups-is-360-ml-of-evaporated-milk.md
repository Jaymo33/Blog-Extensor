faqQ1: "Is 360 ml of evaporated milk the same as 1.5 cups?"
faqA1: "Yes, 360 ml of evaporated milk equals approximately 1.5 cups in both UK and US measurements. The slight difference between UK (250 ml per cup) and US (240 ml per cup) measurements is negligible for most recipes."
faqQ2: "Can I use a kitchen scale to measure 360 ml of evaporated milk?"
faqA2: "Absolutely! Since evaporated milk has a similar density to water, 360 ml weighs roughly 360 grams. Using a kitchen scale ensures precision, especially for baking recipes where accuracy is crucial."
faqQ3: "Does evaporated milk measure the same as regular milk?"
faqA3: "Yes, evaporated milk measures the same as regular milk by volume. However, it’s thicker and creamier due to the removal of about 60% of the water content. Always measure it in liquid form for accuracy."

<p>360 ml of evaporated milk equals approximately 1.5 cups in both UK and US measurements. This conversion is essential for baking and cooking, ensuring your recipes turn out perfectly every time.

At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we help simplify kitchen conversions so you can focus on creating delicious meals.</p>  

<h2>Understanding Evaporated Milk Measurements</h2>  
<p>Evaporated milk is a staple in many recipes, from custards to casseroles. Measuring it correctly ensures your dish has the right consistency and flavour. A standard metric cup holds 250 ml, so 360 ml of evaporated milk is just over 1.5 cups. If you're using an air fryer for baking, precise measurements are even more critical to avoid dry or overly wet results. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more handy tips.</p>  

<p>In the UK, cup measurements align closely with the metric system, making conversions straightforward. However, if you're following a US recipe, note that their cups are slightly smaller (240 ml). Still, the difference is minimal, so 360 ml of evaporated milk will still be roughly 1.5 cups.

<h3>Why Accurate Measurement Matters</h3>  
<p>Using the right amount of evaporated milk can make or break your dish. Too little, and your recipe might lack creaminess; too much, and it could become soggy. This is especially important in air fryer cooking, where precise ingredient ratios affect texture and cooking time. If you're making a dessert like flan or a savoury sauce, always measure carefully.</p>

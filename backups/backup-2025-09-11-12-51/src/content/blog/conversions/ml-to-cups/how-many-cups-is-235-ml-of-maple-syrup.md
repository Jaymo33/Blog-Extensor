<h3>Common Mistakes When Measuring Maple Syrup</h3>  
<p>One mistake is not accounting for the syrup’s stickiness, which can leave residue in your measuring cup and throw off the amount. To avoid this, lightly grease the cup with oil before pouring. Another error is using a liquid measuring cup for thick syrups—opt for a dry measuring cup instead for better precision.</p>

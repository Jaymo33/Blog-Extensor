faqQ1: "Can I use water instead of beef stock in my air fryer recipe?"
faqA1: "While water can be used as a substitute, beef stock adds depth and richness to your dish. If you’re in a pinch, you can dilute the stock or use a stock cube dissolved in water. However, for the best flavour, stick to beef stock where possible."
faqQ2: "How do I store leftover beef stock after measuring 60 ml?"
faqA2: "Leftover beef stock can be stored in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 3 days. For longer storage, freeze it in ice cube trays. Each cube is roughly 30 ml, so you’ll need two cubes to make 60 ml next time."
faqQ3: "Is 60 ml of beef stock the same in the UK and US?"
faqA3: "Yes, 60 ml is a metric measurement and remains the same in both the UK and US. However, cup sizes differ slightly—a US cup is 240 ml, while a UK cup is 250 ml. For 60 ml, the difference is negligible."
faqQ4: "Can I use beef broth instead of beef stock for my air fryer recipe?"
faqA4: "Yes, beef broth can be used as a substitute for beef stock. Broth is typically lighter in flavour, so you may want to reduce it slightly to concentrate the taste. Both work well in air fryer recipes, so choose based on your preference."

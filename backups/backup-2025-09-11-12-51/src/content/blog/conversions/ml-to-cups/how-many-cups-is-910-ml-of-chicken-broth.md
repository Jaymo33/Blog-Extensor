faqQ1: "Is 910 ml of chicken broth the same as 4 cups?"
faqA1: "No, 910 ml of chicken broth is approximately 3.85 cups when using the US standard measurement (236.59 ml per cup). While you could round up to 4 cups for simplicity in some recipes, for precise cooking, especially in baking or sauce-making, it's better to use the exact 3.85 cups measurement."
faqQ2: "Can I use vegetable broth instead of chicken broth in the same quantity?"
faqA2: "Yes, you can substitute vegetable broth for chicken broth in the same 910 ml (3.85 cups) quantity. The flavour profile will be slightly different, but the liquid volume remains the same. This swap works well in most air fryer recipes, from soups to grain dishes."
faqQ3: "How do I measure 910 ml of chicken broth without a measuring jug?"
faqA3: "If you don't have a measuring jug, you can use standard cups. Measure out 3 full cups (about 710 ml), then add another 3/4 cup (about 177 ml) to reach approximately 887 ml - close enough to 910 ml for most recipes. Alternatively, use a kitchen scale, as 910 ml of chicken broth weighs about 910 grams."
faqQ4: "Does the type of chicken broth affect the cup measurement?"
faqA4: "No, whether you're using homemade, canned, or powdered chicken broth reconstituted with water, 910 ml will always equal about 3.85 cups. However, thicker, cream-style broths might measure slightly differently due to their density, so for these, it's best to measure by weight (910 grams) for accuracy."

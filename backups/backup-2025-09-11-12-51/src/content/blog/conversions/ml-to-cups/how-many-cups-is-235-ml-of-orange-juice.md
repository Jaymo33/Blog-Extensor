faqQ1: "Is 235 ml of orange juice the same as 1 cup?"
faqA1: "In US measurements, 235 ml is just under 1 cup (about 0.98 cups), while in the UK, it’s roughly 0.94 cups. For most recipes, especially air fryer cooking, rounding to 1 cup is fine. Precision matters more in baking, so use a jug or scale if needed."
faqQ2: "Can I use bottled orange juice instead of fresh for recipes?"
faqA2: "Yes, but bottled juice may have added sugars or preservatives, which can alter flavour. If substituting, taste and adjust sweetness in your recipe. Fresh juice offers brighter acidity, ideal for marinades or glazes in air fryer dishes."
faqQ3: "How do I measure 235 ml of orange juice without a jug?"
faqA3: "Use a US cup (240 ml) and fill it just below the rim, or a UK cup (250 ml) filled to 94%. Alternatively, weigh it—235 ml weighs about 245 grams. Scales are handy for air fryer recipes requiring exact moisture levels."
faqQ4: "Why does my air fryer recipe taste different with slightly more or less orange juice?"
faqA4: "Liquid ratios affect texture and cooking time. Extra juice can make batters soggy or glaze overly sticky, while too little may dry out dishes. Stick to 235 ml (or 1 cup) for consistent results, especially in cakes or marinades."

<p>235 ml of orange juice is roughly 1 cup in US measurements and just under 1 cup (0.99 cups) in UK metric measurements. Whether you're whipping up a citrus glaze for an air fryer cake or adding zest to a marinade, getting the measurement right ensures perfect results every time. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we know precision matters, especially when adapting recipes for your air fryer.</p>  

<h2>Understanding the Conversion: 235 ml to Cups</h2>  
<p>Converting millilitres to cups can be tricky because US and UK measurements differ slightly. In the US, 1 cup equals 240 ml, so 235 ml of orange juice is just shy of a full cup (about 0.98 cups). In the UK, where 1 metric cup is 250 ml, 235 ml translates to 0.94 cups. For most recipes, especially those in your air fryer, rounding to 1 cup works perfectly. If precision is key, like in baking, using a measuring jug ensures accuracy.</p>  

<p>Why does this matter for air fryer cooking? Many recipes, like our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>orange-glazed salmon</a>, rely on balanced liquid ratios for marinades or glazes. Too much juice can make dishes soggy, while too little might lack flavour. A quick check on our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a> helps avoid mishaps.</p>  

<h3>Why Measuring Orange Juice Correctly Matters</h3>  
<p>Orange juice adds acidity, sweetness, and moisture to dishes. In air fryer recipes, like citrus-marinated chicken or orange-infused cakes, even small measurement errors can affect texture and cook time. For example, excess liquid in batter can lead to uneven cooking, while too little might dry out your dish. Measuring 235 ml accurately ensures consistency.</p>  

<h2>Practical Tips for Measuring 235 ml of Orange Juice</h2>  
<p>Don’t have a measuring jug? Use a standard US cup (240 ml) and fill it just below the rim for 235 ml. In the UK, a metric cup (250 ml) filled to about 94% of its capacity will do. For fuss-free prep, consider using a kitchen scale—235 ml of orange juice weighs roughly 245 grams. This method is handy for recipes like our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>air fryer orange drizzle cake</a>, where precision elevates results.</p>  

<p>Another pro tip: freshly squeezed orange juice varies in sweetness and acidity. If substituting bottled juice, adjust sugar in recipes slightly.

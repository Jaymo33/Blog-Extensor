faqQ1: "Is 485 ml of almond milk the same as 2 cups?"
faqA1: "Not exactly. 485 ml of almond milk equals roughly 2.05 US cups or 1.94 UK cups. The slight difference matters in baking, where precision ensures the right texture. For most cooking, however, rounding to 2 cups works fine."
faqQ2: "Can I use a regular drinking cup to measure 485 ml of almond milk?"
faqA2: "Drinking cups vary in size, so they’re not reliable for exact measurements. A standard US measuring cup holds 237 ml, while a UK metric cup is 250 ml. For accuracy, use a proper measuring jug or scale."
faqQ3: "How does almond milk affect air fryer cooking compared to dairy milk?"
faqA3: "Almond milk has a thinner consistency and slightly nutty flavour, but it works well in most air fryer recipes. It may brown faster due to its sugar content, so adjust cooking times slightly. It’s also a great vegan alternative."
faqQ4: "What’s the best way to measure 485 ml of almond milk for baking?"
faqA4: "Use a liquid measuring jug with millilitre markings for precision. If using cups, fill just over 2 US cups or just under 2 UK cups. Level off the top with a straight edge for the most accurate result."

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of almond milk can affect texture, moisture, and flavour in air fryer recipes. Too little, and your dish may turn out dry; too much, and it could become soggy. For example, if a recipe calls for 485 ml of almond milk, knowing it's roughly 2.05 cups ensures you don’t over or under-pour. This precision is especially crucial for baking, where ratios are key.

<p>Many air fryer enthusiasts rely on millilitre measurements, but cups are often more convenient for quick pours. Converting 485 ml of almond milk to cups is straightforward once you know the ratio. This knowledge also helps when scaling recipes up or down. Whether you're making pancakes or a vegan quiche, accurate measurements guarantee delicious results every time.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure 485 ml of Almond Milk Without a Scale</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a measuring jug with millilitre markings, use standard cups. A US cup holds about 237 ml, so 485 ml is just over 2 cups. For UK cooks, a metric cup is 250 ml, making 485 ml equivalent to 1.94 cups. Slight variations won’t ruin most recipes, but for baking, stick as close as possible.

<h2>Common Uses for 485 ml of Almond Milk in Air Fryer Recipes</h2>

<h3>Adjusting Recipes When You Only Have Cups or Millilitres</h3>  
<p>If a recipe lists cups but you prefer millilitres, remember that 1 cup equals roughly 237 ml (US) or 250 ml (UK). For 485 ml of almond milk, you’d use slightly more than 2 US cups or just under 2 UK cups. This flexibility is handy when adapting recipes from different regions. Keeping a conversion chart, like the one on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, saves time and reduces guesswork.</p>  

<h2>Tips for Storing Leftover Almond Milk</h2>  
<p>If your recipe doesn’t use the full 485 ml, store the remainder properly to avoid waste. Transfer it to an airtight container and refrigerate for up to 5 days. Shake well before reusing, as separation is natural. Leftover almond milk can be added to smoothies, coffee, or even used to clean your air fryer—check our guide on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaning</a> for eco-friendly tips.</p>  

<p>For longer storage, freeze almond milk in ice cube trays. These cubes are perfect for adding small amounts to future recipes without thawing a large quantity. Just pop a few into your next curry or soup for a creamy touch. Proper storage ensures you get the most out of every 485 ml batch.</p>

faqQ1: "Can I use regular milk instead of evaporated milk in a recipe?"
faqA1: "Yes, but you’ll need to adjust the quantity. Evaporated milk is concentrated, so regular milk will be thinner. For 560 ml of evaporated milk, use about 1.12 litres of regular milk to match the richness. However, this may alter the texture of your dish."
faqQ2: "How do I measure 560 ml of evaporated milk without a measuring jug?"
faqA2: "If you don’t have a measuring jug, you can use a standard metric scale. Evaporated milk weighs roughly 1.04 grams per ml, so 560 ml would be about 582 grams. Alternatively, use a tablespoon (15 ml) and measure out 37 tablespoons for 560 ml."
faqQ3: "Does evaporated milk taste the same as regular milk?"
faqA3: "No, evaporated milk has a richer, slightly caramelised flavour due to the removal of water. It’s thicker and creamier, making it ideal for recipes where you want a more decadent texture. Regular milk won’t provide the same depth of flavour."
faqQ4: "Can I freeze evaporated milk for later use?"
faqA4: "Yes, but it may separate when thawed. Freeze it in an airtight container and stir well after thawing to recombine. Use it within 1-2 months for best results. Note that the texture might be slightly grainy, so it’s best used in cooked dishes rather than drinks."

<p>Using the correct amount of evaporated milk can make or break a recipe. Too little, and your dish might lack creaminess; too much, and it could become overly rich or soggy. For air fryer recipes, precise measurements are even more critical because the cooking process is faster and more intense. A slight deviation can affect texture and taste.</p>

<h2>How to Measure 560 ml of Evaporated Milk</h2>
<p>Measuring evaporated milk correctly is simple if you have the right tools. A liquid measuring cup is ideal, as it allows you to pour the milk to the exact mark.

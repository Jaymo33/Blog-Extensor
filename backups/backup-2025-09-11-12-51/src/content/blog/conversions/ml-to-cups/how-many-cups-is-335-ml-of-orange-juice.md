faqQ1: "Is 335 ml of orange juice the same as 1.5 cups?"
faqA1: "No, 335 ml of orange juice equals approximately 1.42 cups, not 1.5. The slight difference matters in recipes, especially for air fryer cooking where precise measurements ensure even results. Always double-check conversions for accuracy."
faqQ2: "Can I use bottled orange juice instead of fresh for 335 ml measurements?"
faqA2: "Yes, bottled orange juice works fine for measuring 335 ml (1.42 cups). However, fresh juice may offer a brighter flavour. For air fryer recipes, either option works, but adjust sugar levels if using sweetened bottled juice."
faqQ3: "How do I measure 335 ml of orange juice without a scale?"
faqA3: "Use a standard measuring cup: 335 ml is roughly 1 cup plus 3 tablespoons (US) or 1 cup and 2 teaspoons (UK). For air fryer recipes, this approximation is usually close enough, but a jug ensures precision."
faqQ4: "Why do some recipes list orange juice in ml instead of cups?"
faqA4: "Many international recipes use millilitres for accuracy, as cup sizes vary by country. Converting 335 ml to cups (1.42 US cups) standardises measurements, making it easier to follow air fryer recipes from different sources."

faqQ1: "Is 760 ml of honey the same as 3 cups?"
faqA1: "No, 760 ml of honey equals roughly 3.2 US cups or 3.3 UK cups. Honey's density means it doesn't align perfectly with standard cup measurements, so slight adjustments are needed for accuracy in recipes."
faqQ2: "How do I convert 760 ml of honey for baking in an air fryer?"
faqA2: "Use 3.2 US cups or 3.3 UK cups for precise results. For air frying, lightly coat the measuring cup with oil to prevent sticking, or weigh the honey (1.04 kg) for foolproof accuracy."
faqQ3: "Does the type of honey affect the conversion from ml to cups?"
faqA3: "Yes, thicker varieties like manuka honey may settle differently in a cup compared to runny honey. For consistency, warm the honey slightly or use weight measurements (grams or ounces) instead."
faqQ4: "Can I use 760 ml of honey in savoury air fryer recipes?"
faqA4: "Absolutely! This quantity works well for glazes, marinades, or sauces. Try it with air-fried salmon, tofu, or roasted vegetables for a balanced sweet-savoury flavour. Check our recipe archives for ideas."

<p>760 ml of honey is approximately 3.2 cups in standard US measurements or 3.3 cups in UK measurements. This conversion is essential for baking, cooking, or air frying recipes where precision matters. Whether you're whipping up a glaze for air-fried chicken or a sweet drizzle for desserts, knowing the exact measurement ensures perfect results every time. Visit <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> for more handy conversion tips and delicious recipes.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Honey Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Honey is thicker and denser than water, meaning volume conversions aren't always straightforward. Using too much or too little can throw off the balance of your recipe, especially in air frying, where precise ingredient ratios affect texture and caramelisation. For example, a honey-glazed salmon cooked in the air fryer needs just the right amount to avoid burning or uneven coating. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for other common ingredient swaps.</p>  

<p>In baking, honey adds moisture and sweetness, but an incorrect measurement can make cakes overly dense or sticky. If you're adapting a recipe from metric to cups, always double-check your conversions. For inspiration, browse our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert recipes</a> tailored for air fryers, where honey plays a starring role.</p>  

<h3>US vs. UK Cup Measurements for Honey</h3>  
<p>The slight difference between US and UK cups matters when converting 760 ml of honey. A US cup is 240 ml, while a UK cup is 250 ml. This means 760 ml translates to roughly 3.2 US cups or 3.3 UK cups. If you're following a British recipe on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, stick to UK measurements for accuracy.</p>  

<h2>Tips for Measuring Honey Without Sticky Mess</h2>  
<p>Measuring honey can be messy, but a few tricks make it easier. Lightly coat your measuring cup with oil or cooking sprayâ€”this helps the honey slide out cleanly. Alternatively, use a kitchen scale for precision; 760 ml of honey weighs about 1.04 kg. For sticky-free cleanup, try our recommended <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner</a> to tackle residue.</p>  

<p>Another tip: Warm the honey slightly (not too hot) to make it less viscous and easier to pour. This is especially useful when preparing marinades for air-fried dishes like honey-glazed tofu or vegetables.

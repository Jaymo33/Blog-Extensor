<p>360 ml of water equals approximately 1.52 cups in the UK or 1.5 cups in the US. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes, where precise measurements can make or break your dish. Whether you’re baking a cake or preparing a savoury meal, knowing how to convert millilitres to cups ensures consistency. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we help simplify these conversions so you can focus on cooking delicious meals.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on precise ingredient ratios to achieve the perfect texture and flavour. Too much or too little water can affect the outcome of your dish, especially in baking. For example, adding 360 ml of water instead of 1.5 cups could throw off the balance in a cake batter. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> is a handy tool to keep nearby for quick reference.</p>  

<p>Many air fryer recipes, like those in our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>cake category</a>, require exact measurements for best results. Even a slight deviation can lead to dry or soggy outcomes. That’s why understanding conversions like 360 ml of water to cups is crucial for air fryer enthusiasts.</p>  

<h2>How to Measure 360 ml of Water Without a Measuring Cup</h2>  
<p>If you don’t have a measuring cup, you can still measure 360 ml of water accurately. A standard UK mug holds about 284 ml, so 360 ml is roughly 1.27 mugs. In the US, a standard cup is 240 ml, making 360 ml equal to 1.5 cups. For precision, use a kitchen scale—360 ml of water weighs 360 grams.</p>  

<h3>Using Household Items for Measurement</h3>  
<p>Common household items can help estimate 360 ml of water. A standard can of soda is 330 ml, which is close to 360 ml. Alternatively, a small juice glass often holds around 200 ml, so filling it twice gets you near the mark. While these methods aren’t exact, they work in a pinch for recipes like those in our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable category</a>.</p>  

<h2>Converting 360 ml of Water for Different Recipes</h2>  
<p>Whether you’re making a sauce, batter, or marinade, converting 360 ml of water to cups ensures consistency. For example, a marinade for chicken might call for 360 ml of water, which is 1.5 US cups. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipes section</a> includes many dishes where precise measurements like this are key.</p>  

<p>Baking is particularly sensitive to measurements. A cake requiring 360 ml of water needs exactly 1.5 cups to rise properly. Too much water can make it dense, while too little can dry it out. Always double-check conversions to avoid mishaps, especially when trying new recipes from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>.</p>  

<h3>Common Mistakes When Measuring Water</h3>  
<p>One common mistake is confusing UK and US cup measurements. In the UK, a cup is 284 ml, while in the US, it’s 240 ml. This means 360 ml of water is 1.27 UK cups but 1.5 US cups. Always check which measurement system your recipe uses to avoid errors.</p>  

<h2>Tips for Perfect Air Fryer Measurements Every Time</h2>  
<p>Invest in a good set of measuring cups and spoons for accuracy. Liquid measuring cups with clear markings are ideal for measuring 360 ml of water. For dry ingredients, use the scoop-and-level method to ensure consistency. Keeping your tools clean, as recommended in our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning guide</a>, also helps maintain accuracy.</p>  

<p>When scaling recipes, recalculate all measurements proportionally. If a recipe serves four and calls for 360 ml of water, halving it would require 180 ml (0.75 US cups). This attention to detail ensures your air fryer dishes turn out perfectly every time.</p>

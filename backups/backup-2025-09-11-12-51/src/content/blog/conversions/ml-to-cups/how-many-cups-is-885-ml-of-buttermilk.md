faqQ1: "Is 885 ml of buttermilk the same in UK and US cups?"
faqA1: "No, there’s a slight difference. In the UK, 885 ml of buttermilk equals about 3.7 cups (1 UK cup = 250 ml). In the US, it’s roughly 3.5 cups (1 US cup = 240 ml). Always check which measurement system your recipe uses for accuracy."
faqQ2: "Can I use dry measuring cups for 885 ml of buttermilk?"
faqA2: "It’s best to use a liquid measuring jug for buttermilk. Dry measuring cups don’t account for the liquid’s meniscus, which can lead to inaccurate measurements. For precise results, especially in baking, always use a jug with clear millilitre markings."
faqQ3: "How should I store leftover buttermilk after measuring 885 ml?"
faqA3: "Transfer any unused buttermilk to an airtight container and refrigerate for up to two weeks. For longer storage, freeze it in ice cube trays. Thawed buttermilk may separate slightly, but a quick stir will restore its consistency."
faqQ4: "Why does my air fryer recipe with buttermilk cook faster?"
faqA4: "Buttermilk’s acidity can react with baking soda, creating extra lift and browning. In an air fryer, this effect is amplified due to the rapid air circulation. Reduce cooking time by 10-15% when using buttermilk-based batters to prevent over-browning."

<p>885 ml of buttermilk is approximately 3.7 cups in the UK or 3.5 cups in the US. This conversion is essential for baking and cooking, especially when using an air fryer for recipes that require precise measurements. Whether you're whipping up a cake or marinating chicken, knowing how to convert millilitres to cups ensures your dish turns out perfectly every time.</p>  

<h2>Understanding Buttermilk Measurements</h2>  
<p>Buttermilk is a staple in many recipes, from fluffy pancakes to tender fried chicken. When a recipe calls for 885 ml of buttermilk, it's crucial to know the equivalent in cups. In the UK, 1 cup equals 250 ml, so 885 ml works out to roughly 3.7 cups. In the US, where 1 cup is 240 ml, 885 ml converts to about 3.5 cups. This slight difference can impact your recipe, so always check which measurement system your recipe uses.</p>  

<p>If you're using an air fryer for baking, precise measurements are even more important. Air fryers cook food faster and more evenly, so getting the liquid ratios right ensures your baked goods don’t dry out or become too dense.

<h3>Why Accuracy Matters in Baking</h3>  
<p>Baking is a science, and even small measurement errors can lead to disappointing results. Too much buttermilk can make cakes soggy, while too little can leave them dry. If you're converting 885 ml of buttermilk to cups, use a measuring jug for liquids rather than dry measuring cups for the most accurate results. This is especially important for air fryer recipes, where consistency is key.</p>  

<h2>Converting 885 ml of Buttermilk for Different Recipes</h2>  
<p>Whether you're making a buttermilk marinade for chicken or a batter for air-fried cod, knowing how many cups 885 ml equals is handy. For example, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipes</a> often use buttermilk for tenderising. If a recipe calls for 885 ml, you’ll now know it’s roughly 3.5 to 3.7 cups, depending on your location.</p>  

<p>If you’re scaling a recipe up or down, remember that 885 ml of buttermilk is just over 3 and a half cups in the US. For UK bakers, it’s closer to 3.7 cups. Always double-check your conversions to avoid mishaps, especially when experimenting with new dishes in your air fryer.</p>  

<h3>Handy Conversion Tools</h3>  
<p>If you frequently convert measurements, consider keeping a conversion chart handy. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> includes common liquid and dry measurements, making it easier to adapt recipes for your air fryer. Whether you're working with buttermilk, oil, or flour, having quick reference tools saves time and reduces errors.</p>  

<h2>Common Mistakes When Measuring Buttermilk</h2>  
<p>One of the biggest mistakes is using dry measuring cups for liquids like buttermilk. Dry cups can’t account for the meniscus (the curve at the top of the liquid), leading to inaccurate measurements. Instead, use a liquid measuring jug with clear markings for the most precise results. This is especially important when converting 885 ml of buttermilk to cups, as even a small error can affect your recipe.</p>  

<p>Another common error is not accounting for the difference between UK and US cup sizes. If you’re following a recipe from an American website, remember that their 1 cup is 240 ml, whereas the UK uses 250 ml. This small difference can add up, especially when dealing with larger quantities like 885 ml of buttermilk.</p>  

<h3>Storing Leftover Buttermilk</h3>  
<p>If your recipe doesn’t use all 885 ml of buttermilk, store the leftovers properly to avoid waste. Transfer it to an airtight container and refrigerate for up to two weeks. You can also freeze buttermilk in ice cube trays for smaller portions.

<h2>Using Buttermilk in Air Fryer Recipes</h2>  
<p>Buttermilk is a versatile ingredient that works wonderfully in air fryer recipes. Its acidity helps tenderise meats, and its thickness adds moisture to baked goods. Whether you’re making air-fried chicken or buttermilk biscuits, knowing how to measure 885 ml in cups ensures consistent results every time.</p>  

<p>For example, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert recipes</a> often include buttermilk for richness. If a recipe calls for 885 ml, you now know it’s roughly 3.5 to 3.7 cups. Remember to adjust cooking times slightly in the air fryer, as buttermilk-based batters may cook faster than traditional oven recipes.</p>  

<h3>Cleaning Your Air Fryer After Using Buttermilk</h3>  
<p>Buttermilk can leave residues that are tricky to clean. To keep your air fryer in top condition, wipe it down immediately after use with a damp cloth.

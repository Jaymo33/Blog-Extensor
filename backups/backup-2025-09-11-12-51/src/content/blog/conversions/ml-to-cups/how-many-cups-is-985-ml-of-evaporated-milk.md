faqQ1: "Can I use fresh milk instead of 985 ml of evaporated milk?"
faqA1: "Yes, but you'll need to adjust the quantity. Fresh milk isn't as concentrated, so use 1.5 times the amount. For 985 ml (4.15 cups) of evaporated milk, substitute with about 6.2 cups of fresh milk."
faqQ2: "How does 985 ml of evaporated milk compare to regular milk in recipes?"
faqA2: "Evaporated milk is thicker and creamier than regular milk, so it adds richness. When converting 985 ml of evaporated milk to cups, remember it’s more concentrated. Regular milk won’t provide the same texture or flavour."
faqQ3: "Is 985 ml of evaporated milk the same in the UK and US?"
faqA3: "Yes, the measurement is the same, but cup sizes differ slightly. In the UK, 985 ml equals about 4.15 UK cups, while in the US, it’s roughly 4.17 US cups. The difference is minimal for most recipes."
faqQ4: "Can I freeze leftover 985 ml of evaporated milk?"
faqA4: "Yes, but it may separate when thawed. Freeze in small portions and stir well after thawing. Use it in cooked dishes rather than drinks or desserts for best results."

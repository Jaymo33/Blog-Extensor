faqQ1: "Is 485 ml of half and half the same in the UK and US?"
faqA1: "Yes, 485 ml of half and half is the same volume in both the UK and US. However, cup sizes differ slightly—the UK uses 250 ml per cup, while the US uses 240 ml. For precise conversions, always check a reliable chart."
faqQ2: "Can I use milk instead of half and half for 485 ml in recipes?"

faqQ3: "How do I measure 485 ml of half and half without a measuring cup?"
faqA3: "Use a kitchen scale: 485 ml of half and half weighs roughly 496 grams. Alternatively, a standard UK mug holds about 284 ml, so 1.7 mugs will give you close to 485 ml."
faqQ4: "Why do air fryer recipes sometimes specify ml instead of cups?"
faqA4: "Many air fryer recipes originate from countries using metric measurements. Ml offers precision, which is crucial for air fryer cooking where small adjustments affect results. Always convert carefully for best outcomes."

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of half and half can make or break a recipe. Too much can make sauces overly rich, while too little might leave them lacking creaminess. In baking, precise measurements ensure the right texture and rise. Air fryer recipes, like those on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes</a>, often rely on exact ratios for perfect results. Whether you're cooking or baking, accuracy is key.</p>  

<p>Converting 485 ml of half and half to cups is straightforward, but it helps to understand the difference between metric and imperial measurements.

<h3>How to Measure Half and Half Correctly</h3>  
<p>For the most accurate measurement, use a liquid measuring cup. Pour the half and half to the 2-cup mark, then add an extra teaspoon to account for the 0.05 remainder. If you don't have a measuring cup, a kitchen scale set to millilitres works too. This method is especially useful for air fryer recipes, where precision matters.

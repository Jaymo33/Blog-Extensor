faqQ1: "Is 135 ml of olive oil the same as 135 grams?"
faqA1: "No, olive oil has a density of about 0.92 grams per millilitre, so 135 ml weighs roughly 124 grams. Always use volume measurements (ml or cups) for liquids unless a recipe specifies weight."
faqQ2: "Can I use vegetable oil instead of olive oil in my air fryer?"
faqA2: "Yes, but adjust the quantity slightly. Vegetable oil is less dense, so you might need about 0.6 cups (142 ml) to match 135 ml of olive oil. Check your recipe for best results."
faqQ3: "How do I measure 135 ml of olive oil without a measuring jug?"
faqA3: "Use tablespoons: 1 tablespoon = 15 ml, so 135 ml equals 9 tablespoons. For larger amounts, a kitchen scale set to grams (124 g for 135 ml) is more accurate."
faqQ4: "Why does my air-fried food turn out greasy with 135 ml of oil?"
faqA4: "You might be using too much oil or not distributing it evenly. Try spraying or brushing oil onto food instead of pouring. For lighter results, reduce the oil by 10-15% and shake the basket mid-cook."

<p>135 ml of olive oil equals approximately 0.57 cups (or just over half a cup). This conversion is essential for precise cooking, especially when using an air fryer, where measurements can impact texture and flavour. Whether you're preparing a crispy roast or a moist cake, knowing how to convert millilitres to cups ensures consistency in your recipes.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on precise ingredient ratios to achieve the perfect crispiness or tenderness. Too much or too little oil can drastically alter the outcome of your dish. For example, using the correct amount of olive oil ensures your roasted vegetables are golden and crispy, not soggy or burnt. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we emphasise the importance of accurate conversions for foolproof results.</p>  

<p>Many air fryer recipes, like those in our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipes section</a>, call for olive oil in millilitres or cups. Understanding how to switch between these units means you can confidently adapt any recipe to your preferred measuring tools. This flexibility is especially handy if you're working with international recipes or scaling portions up or down.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure 135 ml of Olive Oil Without a Measuring Cup</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a measuring cup, you can use a kitchen scale for precision. Olive oil weighs roughly 0.92 grams per millilitre, so 135 ml would be about 124 grams. Alternatively, a standard tablespoon holds 15 ml, meaning 135 ml is equivalent to 9 tablespoons. This method works well for smaller quantities but may be less precise for larger amounts.</p>  

<h2>Converting 135 ml of Olive Oil for Baking vs. Frying</h2>  
<p>Baking often requires stricter adherence to measurements than frying. For example, a cake recipe calling for 135 ml of olive oil (0.57 cups) needs that exact amount to maintain moisture and structure. In contrast, air-frying allows slight adjustments—adding a bit more oil might crisp your potatoes better, while less oil keeps things lighter.</p>  

<p>Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for quick reference when adapting recipes. Whether you're making <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>air-fried chicken</a> or a <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>decadent dessert</a>, accurate conversions ensure consistent results every time.</p>  

<h3>Does Olive Oil Type Affect the Measurement?</h3>  
<p>Extra-virgin, light, or blended olive oils all have similar densities, so 135 ml will always equate to roughly 0.57 cups. However, thicker oils may coat ingredients differently in the air fryer, affecting crispiness. For best results, stick to the type specified in your recipe.</p>  

<h2>Common Mistakes When Measuring Olive Oil</h2>  
<p>One frequent error is misreading measuring cups—pouring oil to the brim instead of the marked line. Always check at eye level for accuracy. Another pitfall is substituting oils with different densities (like coconut oil) without adjusting the volume, which can throw off your recipe.</p>

<h3>UK vs. US Cup Measurements</h3>  
<p>While 135 ml of olive oil is 0.57 US cups, UK cups are slightly larger (284 ml vs. 237 ml). For UK recipes, 135 ml equals about 0.48 cups. Always confirm which cup measurement your recipe uses to avoid discrepancies.</p>

faqQ1: "Is 885 ml of chicken broth the same as 4 cups?"
faqA1: "No, 885 ml of chicken broth equals approximately 3.74 cups (US). While 4 cups would be 960 ml, the difference could affect recipes requiring precise liquid measurements, especially in air fryer cooking where evaporation rates vary."
faqQ2: "Can I use stock instead of broth when measuring 885 ml?"
faqA2: "Yes, you can substitute stock for broth in equal amounts (885 ml or 3.74 cups). However, stocks are often richer, so adjust seasonings accordingly. Both work well in air fryer recipes like braises or poached dishes."
faqQ3: "How do I measure 885 ml of chicken broth without a measuring jug?"
faqA3: "Use a standard cup: 3.75 US cups (240 ml each) will get you close to 885 ml. For better accuracy, fill a cup to the 3/4 mark four times. Alternatively, check our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a> for more tips."
faqQ4: "Why do some recipes use ml and others cups for chicken broth?"
faqA4: "Recipes may use millilitres (metric) or cups (imperial) based on regional preferences. For air fryer cooking, stick to one system or convert carefully—like 885 ml to 3.74 cups—to avoid altering the dish's texture or cooking time."

<p>885 ml of chicken broth equals approximately 3.74 cups. This conversion is essential for recipes requiring precise liquid measurements, especially when using an air fryer. Whether you're making soups, stews, or sauces, knowing how to convert millilitres to cups ensures your dish turns out perfectly every time.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Precision is key when cooking with an air fryer, as too much or too little liquid can affect texture and cooking times. For example, adding 885 ml of chicken broth to a recipe without converting it correctly could throw off the balance. Air fryers circulate hot air rapidly, so proper measurements ensure even cooking and prevent soggy or dry results.</p>  
<p>If you're following a recipe from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, you'll often find measurements in millilitres or cups. Converting 885 ml of chicken broth to cups (3.74 cups) helps maintain consistency. This is especially useful for dishes like air-fried casseroles or braised meats where broth is a key ingredient.</p>  

<h2>How to Measure 885 ml of Chicken Broth Without a Scale</h2>  
<p>Not everyone has a kitchen scale, but you can still measure 885 ml of chicken broth accurately using standard cups. A US cup holds 240 ml, while a UK cup is slightly larger at 250 ml. For 885 ml, you'd need roughly 3.7 US cups or 3.54 UK cups. If precision isn’t critical, rounding to 3.75 cups works fine.</p>

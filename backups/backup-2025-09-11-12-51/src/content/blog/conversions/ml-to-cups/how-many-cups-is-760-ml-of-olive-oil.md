faqQ1: "Is 760 ml of olive oil the same as 3.2 cups in all countries?"
faqA1: "While 760 ml of olive oil is roughly 3.2 cups, cup sizes can vary slightly by country. In the UK and US, a standard cup is 240 ml, so the conversion holds. Always double-check if using a recipe from a country with different measurements."
faqQ2: "Can I use a different oil if I don’t have 760 ml of olive oil?"
faqA2: "Yes, you can substitute other oils like vegetable or sunflower oil in the same quantity (760 ml or 3.2 cups). However, olive oil has a distinct flavour, so the taste of your dish may change slightly. For air fryer recipes, lighter oils often work well too."
faqQ3: "How do I measure 760 ml of olive oil without a measuring jug?"
faqA3: "If you don’t have a measuring jug, use a kitchen scale: 760 ml of olive oil weighs about 700 grams. Alternatively, a standard UK mug holds 284 ml, so 2.7 mugs will give you approximately 760 ml. This method works well for air fryer recipes."
faqQ4: "Why do some air fryer recipes use less than 760 ml of olive oil?"
faqA4: "Air fryers require less oil than traditional frying because they circulate hot air for crispiness. Recipes might use a fraction of 760 ml (e.g., 1-2 tablespoons) to coat food lightly. For baking, however, full measurements like 760 ml (3.2 cups) are more common."

<h2>Converting 760 ml of Olive Oil for Different Recipes</h2>
<p>Whether you’re making savoury or sweet dishes, 760 ml of olive oil converts to 3.2 cups, but how you use it varies.

If you’re unsure, start with less oil and adjust as needed—your air fryer’s non-stick surface often requires less oil than traditional frying.</p>

<h3>Tips for Storing and Using Olive Oil in Air Fryer Cooking</h3>
<p>To keep your olive oil fresh, store it in a cool, dark place away from heat sources. This ensures the oil retains its flavour and health benefits, whether you’re using 760 ml or just a splash.

faqQ1: "Does 560 ml of apple cider vinegar equal exactly 2.37 cups?"
faqA1: "Yes, 560 ml converts to approximately 2.37 US cups (240 ml per cup). For UK cups (284 ml), it's roughly 1.97 cups. Always use a measuring jug for precision, especially in air fryer recipes where liquid reduction happens quickly."
faqQ2: "Can I substitute white vinegar for apple cider vinegar in a 560 ml recipe?"
faqA2: "You can substitute white vinegar, but adjust the quantity slightly as it’s more pungent. Use about 2 cups (480 ml) instead of 560 ml, then taste and adjust. For air fryer marinades, apple cider vinegar’s fruity notes often work better."
faqQ3: "How do I measure 560 ml of apple cider vinegar without a measuring jug?"
faqA3: "Use a standard teacup (about 180-200 ml) as a rough guide—560 ml is nearly 3 teacups. Alternatively, a large tablespoon holds 15 ml, so 37 tablespoons would equal 560 ml. For air fryer recipes, we recommend investing in a jug for accuracy."
faqQ4: "Why do some air fryer recipes specify 560 ml of apple cider vinegar?"
faqA4: "560 ml (2.37 cups) is a common quantity for marinades or glazes that coat 1-1.5 kg of meat evenly. In air fryers, this volume ensures enough liquid for basting without pooling. It’s also ideal for pickling vegetables in smaller batches."

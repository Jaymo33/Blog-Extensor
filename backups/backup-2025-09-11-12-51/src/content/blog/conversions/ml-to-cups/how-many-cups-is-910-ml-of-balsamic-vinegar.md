faqQ1: "Does the type of balsamic vinegar affect the cup measurement?"
faqA1: "No, traditional or commercial balsamic vinegar measures the same by volume. However, aged varieties are thicker, so they may pour more slowly. Always use liquid measuring cups for accuracy in air fryer recipes."
faqQ2: "Can I use this conversion for other vinegars in air fryer cooking?"
faqA2: "Absolutely! The 910 ml to cups conversion works for any vinegar type. Just remember that stronger vinegars like white wine vinegar may require less quantity for the same flavour impact in your air fryer dishes."
faqQ3: "Why does my air fryer recipe specify ml instead of cups?"
faqA3: "Many UK and European recipes use metric measurements for precision. Air fryer cooking benefits from accurate liquid quantities since the cooking chamber is compact. Our conversion helps bridge the measurement gap effortlessly."
faqQ4: "How should I store leftover balsamic vinegar after measuring?"
faqA4: "Keep opened balsamic vinegar in a cool, dark place with the lid tightly sealed. Proper storage maintains flavour for future air fryer recipes. Glass bottles are ideal as they don’t absorb odours like plastic can."

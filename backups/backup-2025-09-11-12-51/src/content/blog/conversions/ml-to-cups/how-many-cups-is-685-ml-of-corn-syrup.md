faqQ1: "Can I use 685 ml of corn syrup interchangeably with 2.9 cups in all recipes?"
faqA1: "Yes, in most recipes, 685 ml of corn syrup can be swapped for 2.9 cups without issues. However, for precision-focused recipes like candies or glazes, sticking to the exact measurement (2.9 cups) is best. Always check if your recipe specifies ml or cups to avoid discrepancies."
faqQ2: "Does the type of corn syrup affect the 685 ml to cups conversion?"
faqA2: "Light and dark corn syrup have slightly different densities, but the difference is minimal for most home cooking. 685 ml of either type will still be roughly 2.9 cups. However, dark corn syrup is thicker, so you might need to adjust cooking times slightly in air fryer recipes."
faqQ3: "How do I measure 685 ml of corn syrup without a measuring cup?"
faqA3: "If you don’t have a measuring cup, use a kitchen scale: 685 ml of corn syrup weighs about 925 grams. Alternatively, use a tablespoon (15 ml)—685 ml equals about 45.6 tablespoons. For sticky ingredients like corn syrup, lightly grease the spoon for easier pouring."
faqQ4: "Can I reduce the amount of corn syrup (e.g., 685 ml to 2 cups) in air fryer recipes?"
faqA4: "Reducing corn syrup can alter texture and browning. For example, using 2 cups instead of 685 ml (2.9 cups) might make glazes less sticky or candies less chewy. If you’re cutting sugar, consider substitutes like honey or maple syrup, but adjust quantities as they behave differently in air fryer cooking."

<h2>Common Uses for 685 ml of Corn Syrup in Air Fryer Recipes</h2>
<p>Corn syrup is a staple in many air fryer recipes, from glazes to caramelised coatings. For instance, 685 ml (or 2.9 cups) of corn syrup can be used to make a glossy glaze for ham or a sweet drizzle for <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>air fryer desserts</a>. Its high sugar content helps achieve that coveted golden finish.</p>
<p>Another popular use is in homemade candies or brittles, where precise measurements are crucial. Too little syrup (say, 2 cups instead of 2.9) can result in a brittle that’s too hard, while too much can make it overly sticky. Always measure carefully!</p>

<p>If you’re substituting light corn syrup with dark or golden syrup, note that their densities vary slightly. While 685 ml of light corn syrup equals 2.9 cups, dark corn syrup might measure closer to 3 cups due to its thicker consistency. Always adjust based on your recipe’s requirements and taste preferences.</p>

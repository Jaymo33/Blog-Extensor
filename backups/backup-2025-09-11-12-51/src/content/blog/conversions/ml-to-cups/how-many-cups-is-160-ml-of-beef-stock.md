This conversion is essential for anyone using an air fryer to prepare soups, stews, or sauces, ensuring your dish turns out perfectly every time. Whether you're following a recipe from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> or improvising, knowing how to measure liquids accurately is key.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Precision is crucial when cooking with an air fryer, especially for liquid ingredients like beef stock. Too much or too little can affect texture, flavour, and cooking time. For example, adding 160 ml of beef stock instead of the correct cup measurement could make a sauce too thin or a stew too dry. Always double-check conversions to avoid mishaps.</p>  

<p>If you're using an air fryer for meal prep, accurate measurements ensure consistency across batches.

Whether you're making a beef casserole or a rich gravy, getting the liquid ratios right makes all the difference.</p>  

<h3>US vs. UK Cup Measurements</h3>  
<p>The US and UK use different cup measurements, which can be confusing. In the US, 1 cup equals 240 ml, while in the UK, it's 284 ml. This means 160 ml of beef stock is roughly 0.68 US cups or 0.56 UK cups. Always check which system your recipe follows to avoid errors.</p>  

<h2>How to Measure 160 ml of Beef Stock Without a Measuring Cup</h2>  
<p>If you don't have a measuring cup, you can use a kitchen scale. Since beef stock has a similar density to water, 160 ml weighs about 160 grams. Alternatively, use tablespoonsâ€”1 US tablespoon is 15 ml, so 160 ml is roughly 10.5 tablespoons. For UK tablespoons (17.7 ml), it's about 9 tablespoons.</p>  

<p>Another handy trick is using common household items. A standard teacup holds around 150 ml, so 160 ml is just slightly more. For more tips on measuring ingredients, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a> tailored for air fryers.</p>

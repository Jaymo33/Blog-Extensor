faqQ1: "Is 585 ml of double cream the same in US and UK cups?"
faqA1: "Yes, 585 ml of double cream equals roughly 2.47 cups in both US and UK measurements. However, US cups are slightly smaller (237 ml) compared to UK cups (284 ml), but the difference is minimal for this quantity."
faqQ2: "Can I use single cream instead of double cream for 585 ml?"
faqA2: "You can substitute single cream, but the result will be less rich. Double cream has a higher fat content, so sauces and desserts may be thinner with single cream. Adjust cooking times slightly if using it in air fryer recipes."
faqQ3: "How do I measure 585 ml of double cream without a jug?"
faqA3: "If you don't have a measuring jug, use a kitchen scale. Double cream weighs roughly 1 gram per ml, so 585 ml equals 585 grams. Alternatively, use a standard cup (237 ml) and measure just under 2.5 cups."
faqQ4: "What's the best way to whip 585 ml of double cream?"
faqA4: "Chill the cream and bowl first, then whip on medium speed until soft peaks form. Avoid overwhipping, as double cream can quickly turn to butter. For air fryer desserts, whipped cream adds a lovely finishing touch."

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter</h2>

<h3>Adjusting Recipes for Different Cream Types</h3>  
<p>If your recipe calls for double cream but you only have single or whipping cream, adjustments are needed.

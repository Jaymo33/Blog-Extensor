faqQ1: "Is 860 ml of almond milk the same as 860 ml of regular milk in cups?"
faqA1: "Yes, 860 ml of almond milk converts to the same number of cups as regular milk—about 3.63 cups. However, almond milk is thinner, so recipes may need slight adjustments in cooking time or thickeners for the best texture."
faqQ2: "Can I use a regular drinking cup to measure 860 ml of almond milk?"
faqA2: "It’s not recommended, as drinking cups vary in size. For accuracy, use a metric measuring cup marked in millilitres. If you must improvise, note that a standard UK mug holds roughly 300 ml, so you’d need just under 3 full mugs."
faqQ3: "Why do some recipes list almond milk in ml and others in cups?"
faqA3: "Recipes may use ml (metric) or cups (imperial/US) depending on their origin. UK and Australian recipes often prefer ml, while US ones use cups. Always check which system your recipe follows—our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a> can help."
faqQ4: "How should I store leftover almond milk after measuring 860 ml?"
faqA4: "Transfer unused almond milk to an airtight container and refrigerate for up to 5 days. Shake well before reusing, as separation is normal. For longer storage, freeze in ice cube trays and thaw as needed."

<p>860 ml of almond milk is roughly 3.63 cups. Whether you're whipping up a dairy-free cake or a creamy sauce in your air fryer, knowing this conversion ensures your recipe turns out perfectly. Almond milk is a popular alternative in many dishes, and getting the measurements right is key to nailing the texture and flavour. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we love helping you master these small but crucial details for flawless cooking.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Precision is everything when it comes to air fryer recipes. Unlike traditional ovens, air fryers circulate hot air rapidly, meaning even slight imbalances in liquid measurements can affect cooking times and results. Too much almond milk might make your batter too runny, while too little could leave your dish dry. For foolproof recipes like dairy-free pancakes or vegan mac and cheese, always measure liquids carefully. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for quick reference.</p>  

<p>Almond milk is often used in both sweet and savoury air fryer dishes, from muffins to creamy pasta sauces. Since it has a thinner consistency than dairy milk, measuring it correctly ensures your recipes hold their structure.

<h3>How to Measure 860 ml of Almond Milk Without a Scale</h3>  
<p>Not everyone has a kitchen scale, but you can still measure 860 ml of almond milk accurately using cups. A standard metric cup holds 250 ml, so 860 ml works out to just under 3 and 2/3 cups. For best results, use a clear liquid measuring cup and fill it to the 860 ml mark. If you're using US cups (240 ml each), the conversion is slightly different—about 3.58 cups. Always double-check your recipe’s measurement system to avoid mishaps.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for 860 ml of Almond Milk in Air Fryer Recipes</h2>  
<p>This quantity of almond milk is perfect for larger batches of batter or sauces. Try it in dairy-free waffles, vegan custards, or even a creamy mushroom pasta bake. Many <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> call for almond milk as a lighter alternative to cream, and 860 ml is often the ideal amount for family-sized portions. Whether you're meal prepping or hosting, this measurement pops up frequently in plant-based cooking.</p>  

<p>For savoury dishes, 860 ml of almond milk can be the base for a rich, dairy-free béchamel sauce. Pair it with our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/potatoes>potato recipes</a> for a decadent gratin. Sweet tooth? It’s also great for chia puddings or dairy-free bread pudding—just adjust cooking times slightly to account for the air fryer’s efficiency.</p>  

<h3>Adjusting Recipes When Using Almond Milk vs. Dairy Milk</h3>  
<p>Almond milk behaves differently than dairy milk in recipes due to its lower fat content. If a recipe originally calls for dairy milk, you might need to tweak other ingredients like binding agents or cooking times. For air fryer baking, consider adding a teaspoon of cornflour per cup of almond milk to thicken batters. And don’t forget—always preheat your air fryer for even results, especially when working with liquid-heavy mixtures.</p>

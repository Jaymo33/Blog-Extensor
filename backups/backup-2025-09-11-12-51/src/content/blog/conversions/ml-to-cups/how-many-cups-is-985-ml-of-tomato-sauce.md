faqQ1: "Is 985 ml of tomato sauce the same in the UK and USA?"
faqA1: "No, cup measurements differ slightly between the UK and USA. A UK metric cup is 240 ml, while a US customary cup is 236.6 ml. For 985 ml of tomato sauce, this works out to roughly 4.16 UK cups or 4.17 US cups—a negligible difference for most recipes."

faqA2: "Yes, passata can be substituted for tomato sauce in equal amounts (985 ml of passata equals 985 ml of tomato sauce). However, passata is usually smoother and less seasoned, so you may need to adjust herbs and spices to match the flavour profile of your dish."
faqQ3: "How do I store leftover tomato sauce after measuring 985 ml?"
faqA3: "Leftover tomato sauce can be refrigerated in an airtight container for up to 5 days or frozen for 3 months. For easy reuse, portion it into smaller containers or ice cube trays for quick additions to future <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a>."
faqQ4: "Why does my air fryer recipe call for 985 ml of tomato sauce specifically?"
faqA4: "Many recipes use 985 ml (about 4 cups) because it's a standard quantity for family-sized dishes, ensuring even coverage without overcrowding the air fryer basket. This amount balances moisture and flavour, preventing sogginess or dryness in dishes like lasagna or casseroles."

<p>985 ml of tomato sauce equals approximately 4.16 cups (using the standard UK metric cup measurement of 240 ml per cup). This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes, where precise measurements can make or break a dish. Whether you're making a rich pasta sauce or a hearty casserole, knowing how to convert millilitres to cups ensures your cooking is consistent and delicious.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on precise ingredient ratios to achieve the perfect texture and flavour. Too much or too little tomato sauce can affect moisture levels, cooking times, and overall taste. For example, if you're preparing a <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>classic air fryer lasagna</a>, 985 ml of tomato sauce (or roughly 4.16 cups) ensures even layering without making the dish soggy. Accurate measurements also help when scaling recipes up or down for different serving sizes.</p>  

<p>Many air fryer recipes, like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken parmigiana</a>, call for tomato sauce as a base.

<h2>How to Measure 985 ml of Tomato Sauce Without a Measuring Cup</h2>  
<p>If you don't have a measuring cup handy, you can still measure 985 ml of tomato sauce using household items. A standard UK mug holds about 300 ml, so three mugs plus a little extra will get you close to 985 ml. Alternatively, a large tablespoon holds roughly 15 ml, so 65 tablespoons would equal 985 ml—though this method is less practical for large quantities.</p>  

<h3>Using a Kitchen Scale for Precision</h3>  
<p>For absolute accuracy, a kitchen scale is your best friend. Tomato sauce weighs approximately 240 grams per cup (240 ml), so 985 ml would weigh around 985 grams. This method eliminates guesswork and is especially useful for baking or <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>air fryer desserts</a> where precision is key.</p>  

<h2>Common Recipes Using 985 ml of Tomato Sauce</h2>  
<p>Many air fryer dishes call for around 985 ml of tomato sauce, making this conversion a handy one to memorise. For instance, a family-sized <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/potatoes>potato gratin</a> might require this amount for layering. Similarly, homemade air fryer pizzas often use 4 cups (985 ml) of sauce as a base for a crispy yet saucy result.</p>  

<p>If you're meal prepping, 985 ml of tomato sauce can be divided into portions for multiple dishes. Try using it in <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>stuffed peppers</a> or as a dipping sauce for air-fried meatballs. Keeping your measurements accurate ensures each portion tastes just as good as the last.</p>  

<h3>Adjusting for Different Tomato Sauce Consistencies</h3>  
<p>Not all tomato sauces are created equal—some are thicker, while others are more watery. If your sauce is particularly dense, you might need slightly less than 985 ml to reach 4 cups. Conversely, a runny sauce may require a bit more. Always taste and adjust seasonings accordingly, as concentration can vary between brands.</p>

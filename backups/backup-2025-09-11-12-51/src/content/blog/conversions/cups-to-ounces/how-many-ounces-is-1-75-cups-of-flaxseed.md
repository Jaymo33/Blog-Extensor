faqQ1: "Can I use ground flaxseed instead of whole for this conversion?"
faqA1: "Yes, ground flaxseed has a similar weight to whole flaxseed, so 1.75 cups still equals roughly 7.4 ounces. However, ground flaxseed absorbs more liquid, so adjust wet ingredients in your air fryer recipes accordingly."
faqQ2: "How does flaxseed affect cooking times in an air fryer?"
faqA2: "Flaxseed can slightly increase cooking times due to its moisture-absorbing properties. If using 1.75 cups (7.4 oz) in a recipe, monitor your dish closely and extend the time in 2-minute increments if needed."
faqQ3: "Is there a difference between UK and US ounces for flaxseed?"
faqA3: "No, fluid ounces are the same in both regions for dry ingredients like flaxseed. So, 1.75 cups of flaxseed equals 7.4 ounces whether you're in the UK or US."
faqQ4: "Can I substitute flaxseed with another ingredient in air fryer recipes?"
faqA4: "Chia seeds are the closest substitute, using a 1:1 ratio by weight. For 1.75 cups (7.4 oz) of flaxseed, replace it with 7.4 oz of chia seeds, but note they may alter texture slightly."

<h2>Why accurate flaxseed measurements matter</h2>  
<p>Flaxseed is a versatile ingredient, often used in air fryer recipes for its nutty flavour and health benefits. Too much or too little can alter texture and cooking times.

<h3>How to measure flaxseed correctly</h3>  
<p>For best results, use a digital scale to weigh flaxseed in ounces. Scooping directly from the bag can lead to inconsistent amounts due to settling. If you don’t have scales, fluff the flaxseed with a spoon before lightly filling your measuring cup. Level it off with a knife for accuracy.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for flaxseed in air fryers</h2>  
<p>Flaxseed is a staple in many air fryer recipes, from breading fish to making energy bars. Its high fibre content makes it great for binding ingredients without eggs.

faqQ1: "Does bottled lemon juice weigh the same as fresh lemon juice in ounces?"
faqA1: "Bottled and fresh lemon juice weigh roughly the same—about 8 oz per cup. However, bottled juice may contain preservatives or added water, slightly altering density. For best results in air fryer recipes, fresh lemon juice is preferred for its brighter flavour."
faqQ2: "Can I use lemon concentrate instead of juice for 2 cups (16 oz)?"
faqA2: "Yes, but dilute concentrate according to package instructions. Typically, 1 part concentrate to 3 parts water makes 16 oz of lemon juice. Adjust other recipe liquids to avoid overpowering acidity."
faqQ3: "How many lemons make 2 cups (16 oz) of juice?"
faqA3: "About 8-10 medium lemons yield 16 oz of juice, depending on size and juiciness. Roll lemons before squeezing to maximize extraction. For large batches, a juicer saves time."
faqQ4: "Why does my air fryer recipe taste too lemony with 16 oz of juice?"
faqA4: "Air fryers intensify flavours due to rapid air circulation. Try reducing lemon juice to 12 oz (1.5 cups) or balancing with honey or olive oil. Always tweak recipes to suit your taste."

<p>2 cups of lemon juice equals approximately 16 fluid ounces (or 16 oz). This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes, ensuring your dishes have the perfect balance of tangy flavour.

At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we know precision is key to delicious results. Keep reading for more tips on measuring lemon juice and other ingredients.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of lemon juice can elevate your air fryer dishes from good to great. Too much can overpower, while too little might leave your meal lacking zest. For example, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>lemon herb chicken</a> relies on precisely 16 oz (2 cups) of lemon juice for the marinade.

<h3>Lemon Juice vs. Other Liquids: Weight vs. Volume</h3>  
<p>Unlike water, lemon juice has a slightly different density, but for most recipes, the 1 cup = 8 oz rule applies. If you're using bottled lemon juice, check the label for exact ounces per cup. Freshly squeezed lemon juice may vary slightly, but 2 cups will still hover around 16 oz.

<h2>How to Measure Lemon Juice Without a Measuring Cup</h2>

Alternatively, 2 cups of lemon juice fill a pint glass to the brim. For sticky situations, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning guide</a> helps tackle spills quickly.

<h3>Converting Lemon Juice for Different Recipes</h3>  
<p>If a recipe calls for 2 cups of lemon juice in ounces (16 oz), but you only have a 12 oz bottle, you’ll need 1.5 cups. Adjust other ingredients accordingly to maintain flavour balance. For <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken dishes</a>, a 16 oz marinade typically covers 4-6 portions. Always taste-test before cooking—especially with citrus-heavy recipes.</p>

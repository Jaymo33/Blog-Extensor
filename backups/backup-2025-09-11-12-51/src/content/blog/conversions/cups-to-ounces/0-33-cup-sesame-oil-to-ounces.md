faqQ1: "Can I use 0.33 cup of sesame oil for air-frying vegetables?"
faqA1: "Absolutely! 0.33 cup (2.64 oz) of sesame oil is perfect for coating 4-6 servings of vegetables like broccoli or Brussels sprouts. Toss them evenly before air frying at 180°C for 10-12 minutes. The oil helps crisp the edges while adding a rich, nutty flavour."
faqQ2: "How does 0.33 cup of sesame oil compare to olive oil in weight?"
faqA2: "Sesame oil and olive oil have similar densities, so 0.33 cup of either is roughly 2.64 oz. However, sesame oil has a lower smoke point, so it’s better for low-to-medium heat air frying. For high-heat recipes, consider blending it with a neutral oil."
faqQ3: "Why does my air fryer recipe call for 0.33 cup of sesame oil specifically?"
faqA3: "Recipes often use 0.33 cup (2.64 oz) of sesame oil because it’s enough to coat ingredients without drowning them. This amount balances flavour and texture, especially in marinades or glazes. Always measure carefully—too much oil can cause smoking in the air fryer."
faqQ4: "Can I substitute another oil if I don’t have 0.33 cup of sesame oil?"
faqA4: "Yes, but the flavour will differ. For 0.33 cup (2.64 oz), try peanut or avocado oil for high-heat cooking. For Asian dishes, blend 1 tbsp sesame oil with 2.64 oz neutral oil to mimic the taste. Check our conversion chart for precise swaps."

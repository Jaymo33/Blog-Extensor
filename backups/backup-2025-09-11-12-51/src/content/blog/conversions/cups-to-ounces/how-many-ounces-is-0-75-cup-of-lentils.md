faqQ1: "Can I use 0.75 cup of lentils directly in the air fryer without soaking?"
faqA1: "Yes, you can air fry 0.75 cup (5.29 oz) of unsoaked lentils, but they’ll take longer to cook—about 18-20 minutes at 180°C. Soaking for 30 minutes reduces cooking time to 12-15 minutes and improves texture."
faqQ2: "How do I adjust cooking time for 0.75 cup of lentils in different air fryer models?"
faqA2: "Smaller air fryers may require shaking the 0.75 cup (5.29 oz) of lentils more frequently for even cooking. Larger models can handle the batch in one go. Always check at the halfway mark and adjust time as needed."
faqQ3: "Are the ounces the same for all lentil types when converting 0.75 cup?"
faqA3: "Most lentils weigh similarly, but red lentils may be slightly denser—around 5.5 oz per 0.75 cup. Green and brown lentils average 5.29 oz. Always measure by weight for precision in air fryer recipes."
faqQ4: "Can I freeze cooked lentils measured as 0.75 cup portions?"
faqA4: "Absolutely! Cooked 0.75 cup (5.29 oz) lentil portions freeze well for up to 3 months. Reheat in the air fryer at 160°C for 5-7 minutes—perfect for quick meals."

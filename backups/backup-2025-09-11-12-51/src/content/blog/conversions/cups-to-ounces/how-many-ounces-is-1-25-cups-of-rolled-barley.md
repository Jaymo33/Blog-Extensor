faqQ1: "Can I use a measuring cup instead of a scale for rolled barley?"
faqA1: "Yes, but for the most accurate results, fluff the barley first and spoon it into the cup. Avoid packing it down, as this can lead to more than 5 oz in 1.25 cups. A kitchen scale is still the best tool for precision."
faqQ2: "Does rolled barley weigh the same as pearled barley?"
faqA2: "No, pearled barley is slightly denser due to the removal of its outer husk. 1.25 cups of pearled barley may weigh closer to 6 oz, so adjust measurements accordingly for air fryer recipes."
faqQ3: "How long does rolled barley take to cook in an air fryer?"
faqA3: "Rolled barley typically takes 15–20 minutes at 180°C in an air fryer, depending on the recipe. Pre-soaking can reduce cooking time, but always check for tenderness."
faqQ4: "Can I substitute rolled barley for oats in air fryer recipes?"
faqA4: "Yes, but adjust measurements since oats are lighter. 1.25 cups of oats weigh about 4 oz, so you may need slightly more barley by volume for the same texture."

<p>Rolled barley is a versatile ingredient, perfect for air fryer granolas, stews, and even crispy snacks. Since air fryers circulate hot air, the weight of ingredients like barley affects how they crisp up. A slight mismeasurement could leave your dish undercooked or overly dry.

<h3>How to measure rolled barley for air frying</h3>  
<p>The best way to measure 1.25 cups of rolled barley is by using a kitchen scale for accuracy. Scooping directly from the bag can lead to inconsistencies, as barley settles differently. If you don’t have a scale, fluff the barley first, then spoon it into a measuring cup and level it off. This method helps approximate 5 oz (1.25 cups) closely. Keeping your air fryer clean also ensures even cooking—learn how with our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning guide</a>.</p>

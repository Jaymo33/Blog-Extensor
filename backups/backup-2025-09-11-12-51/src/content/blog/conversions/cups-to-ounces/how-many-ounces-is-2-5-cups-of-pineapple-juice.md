<h3>How to Measure Pineapple Juice Correctly</h3>  
<p>Use a liquid measuring cup for accuracy, filling it to the 2.5-cup mark at eye level. For sticky juices like pineapple, lightly grease the cup first to ensure all liquid pours out. If your recipe calls for weight, note that 20 fluid ounces of pineapple juice weighs roughly 567 grams.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for 2.5 Cups of Pineapple Juice</h2>

faqQ1: "Can I use a kitchen scale to measure 3 cups of buttermilk in ounces?"
faqA1: "Yes, you can use a kitchen scale to measure buttermilk. Since 3 cups of buttermilk equal 24 fluid ounces, this translates to roughly 680 grams on a scale. This method is especially handy if you don’t have measuring cups or prefer precise weights for baking."
faqQ2: "Is there a difference between US and UK ounces for buttermilk measurements?"
faqA2: "Technically, UK fluid ounces are about 4% larger than US ounces, but most recipes (including air fryer ones) use the standard 8-ounce cup for simplicity. So, 3 cups of buttermilk will still be 24 fluid ounces in both systems unless specified otherwise."
faqQ3: "What can I substitute for buttermilk in an air fryer recipe?"
faqA3: "If you’re out of buttermilk, mix 1 tablespoon of lemon juice or vinegar with 3 cups of milk (24 oz) and let it sit for 10 minutes. This creates a similar tangy flavour and acidity, perfect for marinating chicken or baking in your air fryer."
faqQ4: "How long does buttermilk last in the fridge?"
faqA4: "Buttermilk typically stays fresh for about 1-2 weeks in the fridge if stored properly. Always check for off smells or curdling before using it in your air fryer recipes. If in doubt, make a fresh batch using the substitution method above."

<h3>How to Measure Buttermilk Correctly</h3>

<h2>Converting 3 Cups of Buttermilk to Ounces in Different Systems</h2>

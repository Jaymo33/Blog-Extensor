faqQ1: "Does 1 cup of pesto always equal 8 ounces?"
faqA1: "While 1 cup of pesto generally equals 8 ounces, slight variations exist. Store-bought pesto is denser, so it's closer to 8 ounces, whereas homemade pesto may weigh around 7.5 ounces per cup due to chunkier textures. For air fryer recipes, using a scale ensures accuracy."
faqQ2: "Can I use fluid ounces to measure pesto?"
faqA2: "Fluid ounces measure volume, not weight, so they're less reliable for thick ingredients like pesto. Always use weight ounces (oz) for precise air fryer cooking. A kitchen scale is the best tool for consistent results."
faqQ3: "How do I convert larger amounts of pesto from cups to ounces?"
faqA3: "Simply multiply the number of cups by 8 to get the weight in ounces. For example, 2 cups of pesto equal 16 ounces, and 0.5 cups equal 4 ounces. This scaling works perfectly for batch cooking in your air fryer."
faqQ4: "Why does pesto weight vary between brands?"
faqA4: "Different brands use varying ratios of oil, nuts, and cheese, affecting density. Oil-heavy pesto weighs more per cup, while nut-heavy versions are lighter. Always check labels or weigh it yourself for air fryer recipes requiring precision."

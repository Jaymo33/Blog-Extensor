faqQ1: "Can I use a kitchen scale instead of measuring cups for pumpkin seeds?"
faqA1: "Absolutely! A kitchen scale is the most accurate way to measure pumpkin seeds. Simply set it to ounces and weigh out 2.5 oz for the equivalent of 0.5 cup. This method eliminates any guesswork and ensures perfect results in your air fryer."
faqQ2: "Do pumpkin seeds weigh the same when roasted?"
faqA2: "Roasting pumpkin seeds removes some moisture, so they may weigh slightly less after cooking. However, the difference is minimal—about 0.5 cup (2.5 oz) of raw seeds will yield roughly the same volume once roasted. For best results, measure them before seasoning and cooking."
faqQ3: "How do I adjust cooking time for different amounts of pumpkin seeds?"
faqA3: "If you’re cooking more or less than 0.5 cup (2.5 oz), adjust the time accordingly. Larger batches may need an extra minute or two, while smaller amounts cook faster. Always shake the basket halfway through to ensure even roasting."
faqQ4: "Are pumpkin seeds healthy when cooked in an air fryer?"
faqA4: "Yes! Air-fried pumpkin seeds retain their nutrients, including magnesium, zinc, and healthy fats. Since air fryers use little to no oil, they’re a healthier alternative to deep-frying. Just season lightly for a guilt-free snack."

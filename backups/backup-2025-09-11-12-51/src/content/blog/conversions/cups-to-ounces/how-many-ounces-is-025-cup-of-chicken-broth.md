faqQ1: "Is 0.25 cup of chicken broth the same as 2 fluid ounces?"
faqA1: "Yes, 0.25 cup of chicken broth equals 2 fluid ounces in volume. This measurement is consistent for most liquids, including broth, when using standard US cups. For UK measurements, it's approximately the same, with minimal variation that won't affect most recipes."
faqQ2: "Can I use stock instead of broth when measuring 0.25 cup?"
faqA2: "Absolutely! Chicken stock can be substituted for broth in equal measurements. Both 0.25 cup of broth and stock will weigh about 2 ounces. The main difference is flavour intensity, with stock typically being richer. Adjust seasonings accordingly in your air fryer recipes."
faqQ3: "How do I measure 0.25 cup of chicken broth without measuring cups?"
faqA3: "You can use tablespoons - 4 tablespoons equal 0.25 cup (2 ounces) of chicken broth. Alternatively, a standard shot glass is usually 1.5 ounces, so fill it slightly more than halfway. For precise air fryer cooking, we recommend investing in basic measuring tools."
faqQ4: "Does the type of chicken broth affect the ounce measurement?"
faqA4: "No, whether you use homemade, canned, or powdered chicken broth reconstituted with water, 0.25 cup will always equal approximately 2 ounces by volume. However, thicker or reduced broths may vary slightly in weight, but not enough to impact most air fryer recipes."

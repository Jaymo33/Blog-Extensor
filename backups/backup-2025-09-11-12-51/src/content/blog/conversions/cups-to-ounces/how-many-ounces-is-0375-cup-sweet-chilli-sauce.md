faqQ1: "Can I use a tablespoon to measure 0.375 cup of sweet chilli sauce?"
faqA1: "Yes, but it’s less precise. 0.375 cup equals 6 tablespoons, so you’d need to measure carefully. For accuracy, a liquid measuring cup or kitchen scale is better, especially for air fryer recipes where consistency matters."
faqQ2: "Does the brand of sweet chilli sauce affect the ounce measurement?"
faqA2: "No, 0.375 cup of any sweet chilli sauce will always be 3 ounces by volume. However, thickness may vary slightly between brands, so weighing ensures the most accurate result for air fryer cooking."
faqQ3: "How can I adjust recipes if I only have a 0.375 cup measurement?"
faqA3: "If a recipe calls for ounces, remember 0.375 cup equals 3 ounces. For larger batches, scale up proportionally—e.g., 0.75 cup would be 6 ounces. Always check our conversion chart for quick reference."
faqQ4: "Is sweet chilli sauce sticky in the air fryer?"
faqA4: "Yes, it can be. To prevent mess, lightly brush 0.375 cup (3 ounces) onto food rather than pouring. Line the basket with foil or use our recommended <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning tips</a> for easy maintenance."

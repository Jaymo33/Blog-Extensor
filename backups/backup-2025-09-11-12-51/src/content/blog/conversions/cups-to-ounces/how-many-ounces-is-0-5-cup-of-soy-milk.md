faqQ1: "Can I use almond milk instead of soy milk in air fryer recipes?"
faqA1: "Yes, almond milk can be substituted for soy milk in most air fryer recipes. However, since almond milk is slightly thinner, you may need to adjust the quantity. For 0.5 cup of soy milk (4.23 oz), use the same volume of almond milk but expect a subtly different texture."
faqQ2: "How do I measure 0.5 cup of soy milk without a measuring cup?"
faqA2: "If you don’t have a measuring cup, use a kitchen scale to weigh out 4.23 ounces of soy milk. Alternatively, a standard UK tablespoon holds 0.5 oz, so roughly 8.5 tablespoons would equal 0.5 cup. For accuracy, we recommend investing in a liquid measuring cup."
faqQ3: "Does the brand of soy milk affect the weight per 0.5 cup?"
faqA3: "Most brands of soy milk have a similar density, so 0.5 cup should weigh around 4.23 ounces. However, thicker or sweetened varieties might vary slightly. Always check the label for specific nutritional information if precision is crucial for your recipe."
faqQ4: "Can I freeze soy milk for later use in air fryer recipes?"
faqA4: "Yes, you can freeze soy milk, but it may separate when thawed. Stir it well before using it in recipes. For best results, measure 0.5 cup (4.23 oz) after thawing and shaking. Frozen soy milk works well in cooked dishes but may not be ideal for beverages."

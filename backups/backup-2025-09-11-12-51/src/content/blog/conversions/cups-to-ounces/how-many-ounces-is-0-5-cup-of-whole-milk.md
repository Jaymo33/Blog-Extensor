faqQ1: "Can I use skim milk instead of whole milk for 0.5 cup measurements?"
faqA1: "Yes, you can substitute skim milk for whole milk in most recipes. However, skim milk has a slightly different density, so 0.5 cup will still be close to 4.23 ounces, but the texture and richness of your dish may vary. For best results in air fryer recipes, stick to whole milk unless the recipe specifies otherwise."
faqQ2: "How do I measure 0.5 cup of whole milk without a measuring cup?"
faqA2: "If you don’t have a measuring cup, use a kitchen scale to weigh out 4.23 ounces of whole milk. Alternatively, you can estimate using a standard drinking glass—0.5 cup is roughly half of a small glass. For precise air fryer recipes, though, investing in a measuring cup is recommended."
faqQ3: "Does the temperature of whole milk affect the 0.5 cup to ounces conversion?"
faqA3: "No, the temperature of the milk doesn’t change the volume-to-weight conversion. Whether cold or room temperature, 0.5 cup of whole milk will always be approximately 4.23 ounces. However, warmer milk may pour more easily, making it simpler to measure accurately."
faqQ4: "Why do some recipes list milk in ounces instead of cups?"
faqA4: "Recipes often use ounces for precision, especially in baking or air fryer cooking, where exact measurements matter. While 0.5 cup of whole milk equals 4.23 ounces, weighing ingredients can eliminate inconsistencies caused by how the milk is poured or settled in the cup. This ensures reliable results every time."

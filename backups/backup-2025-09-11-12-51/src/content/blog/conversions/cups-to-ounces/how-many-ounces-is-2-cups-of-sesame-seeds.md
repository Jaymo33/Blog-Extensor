faqQ1: "Does the type of sesame seed affect the weight conversion?"
faqA1: "No, both white and black sesame seeds weigh roughly the same per cup. The 2 cups to 10 ounces conversion applies to all common sesame varieties. The main difference is in flavour intensity rather than density."
faqQ2: "Can I use this conversion for other small seeds in air fryer recipes?"
faqA2: "While the 2 cups to 10 ounces ratio works for sesame seeds, other seeds like flax or chia have different densities. Always check specific weight conversions for different seed types when air frying for accurate results."
faqQ3: "Why is weight measurement better than cups for air fryer cooking?"
faqA3: "Weight measurements (ounces) are more precise because cup measurements can vary based on how ingredients are packed. Air fryers cook quickly, so exact measurements prevent burning or uneven cooking, especially with small ingredients like seeds."
faqQ4: "How should I store leftover sesame seeds after measuring?"
faqA4: "Store unused sesame seeds in an airtight container in a cool, dark place. Properly stored, they'll maintain freshness for air fryer recipes. For longer storage, keep them in the refrigerator to prevent rancidity."

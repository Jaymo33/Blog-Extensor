faqQ1: "Can I use self-raising flour instead of plain flour for 0.375 cup measurements?"
faqA1: "Yes, but note that self-raising flour contains baking powder, which affects texture. For 0.375 cup (1.59 oz), you can substitute, but adjust leavening agents in your recipe. Plain flour is neutral, making it versatile for air fryer baking."
faqQ2: "Why does my air fryer recipe turn out dry when using 0.375 cup of plain flour?"
faqA2: "Dry results may stem from overmeasuring flour. Ensure you’re using the correct 1.59 oz weight for 0.375 cup. Also, air fryers cook faster, so check doneness early to prevent overbaking."
faqQ3: "How do I store leftover plain flour after measuring 0.375 cup?"
faqA3: "Keep flour in an airtight container in a cool, dry place. For long-term storage, refrigerate or freeze it. Always fluff flour before re-measuring to maintain accuracy."
faqQ4: "Can I double a recipe that uses 0.375 cup of plain flour in the air fryer?"
faqA4: "Yes, but ensure your air fryer basket has enough space for even cooking. Doubling 0.375 cup (1.59 oz) means using 0.75 cup (3.18 oz). Adjust cooking time slightly if needed."

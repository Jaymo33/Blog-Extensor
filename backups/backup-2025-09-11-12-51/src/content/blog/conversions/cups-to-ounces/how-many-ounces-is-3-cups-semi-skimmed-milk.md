faqQ1: "Can I use whole milk instead of semi skimmed milk for the same measurement?"
faqA1: "Yes, you can substitute whole milk for semi skimmed milk in the same quantity (3 cups = 24 fl oz). The fat content differs, but the volume remains the same. Just note that whole milk may make dishes slightly richer."
faqQ2: "How do I measure 3 cups of semi skimmed milk without a measuring jug?"
faqA2: "If you don't have a measuring jug, use a standard UK mug (approx 8.8 fl oz) and fill it just under three times to get close to 24 fl oz. For absolute precision, a kitchen scale set to 680 grams works too."
faqQ3: "Does the temperature of the milk affect the ounce measurement?"
faqA3: "No, the temperature doesn't change the volume. Whether cold or warm, 3 cups of semi skimmed milk will always be 24 fl oz. However, warmer milk may foam slightly, so measure it at rest for accuracy."
faqQ4: "Why is my air fryer recipe turning out dry even with 3 cups of milk?"
faqA4: "Dry results could be due to overcooking or incorrect air fryer settings, not the milk measurement. Ensure you're using the right temperature and time for your recipe. Check our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> for troubleshooting tips."

<h2>Understanding the conversion</h2>  
<p>Converting cups to ounces can be tricky, especially with liquids like semi skimmed milk. In the UK, 1 cup of semi skimmed milk is roughly 8 fluid ounces, so 3 cups would be 24 fl oz. This measurement is crucial for recipes where precision matters, such as air fryer desserts or creamy dishes. Always use a measuring jug for accuracy, as eyeballing can lead to inconsistencies. If you're unsure, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipes section</a> has plenty of tested ideas.</p>  

<p>Semi skimmed milk has a slightly lower fat content than whole milk, but its density remains similar for measuring purposes. This means the conversion from cups to ounces stays consistent. Whether you're making a custard or a batter, getting the milk measurement right ensures perfect results every time.

For example, adding 24 fl oz of semi skimmed milk instead of guessing ensures your recipe turns out as intended. This is especially important for baked goods or sauces where consistency is key.

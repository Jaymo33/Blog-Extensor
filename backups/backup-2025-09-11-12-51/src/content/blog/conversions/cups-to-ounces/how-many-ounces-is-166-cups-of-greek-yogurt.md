faqQ1: "Can I use regular yogurt instead of greek yogurt in air fryer recipes?"
faqA1: "Yes, but greek yogurt is thicker, so you may need to adjust the quantity. Regular yogurt has more water content, which can affect texture. For best results, strain regular yogurt or reduce other liquids in the recipe."
faqQ2: "How do I store leftover greek yogurt after measuring 1.66 cups?"
faqA2: "Store it in an airtight container in the fridge for up to two weeks. Always use a clean spoon to avoid contamination. If the yogurt separates, simply stir it before using."
faqQ3: "Is 1.66 cups of greek yogurt the same as 1.66 cups of liquid?"
faqA3: "No, greek yogurt is denser than liquids like water or milk. While both measure the same in cups, their weights differ. Always weigh yogurt for precision in baking or marinades."
faqQ4: "Can I freeze greek yogurt if I have leftovers after measuring 1.66 cups?"
faqA4: "Yes, but the texture may change upon thawing. Frozen greek yogurt works best in cooked dishes like sauces or baked goods. Avoid freezing if you plan to use it fresh, like in dips."

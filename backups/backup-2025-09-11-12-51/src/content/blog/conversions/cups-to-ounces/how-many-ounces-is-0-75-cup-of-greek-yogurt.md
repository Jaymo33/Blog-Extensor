faqQ1: "Can I use regular yogurt instead of greek yogurt for 0.75 cup measurements?"

faqQ2: "How do I measure 0.75 cup of greek yogurt without a measuring cup?"
faqA2: "Use a kitchen scale—6 ounces is the equivalent. Alternatively, fill a standard UK yogurt pot three-quarters full for a rough estimate."
faqQ3: "Does the brand of greek yogurt affect the ounce measurement?"
faqA3: "Slightly. Thicker brands may weigh more per cup, but 0.75 cup generally stays around 6 ounces. Check the label for precise weight if needed."
faqQ4: "Can I freeze 0.75 cup portions of greek yogurt for later use?"
faqA4: "Yes, but the texture may change slightly. Thaw it in the fridge before using it in air fryer recipes for best results."

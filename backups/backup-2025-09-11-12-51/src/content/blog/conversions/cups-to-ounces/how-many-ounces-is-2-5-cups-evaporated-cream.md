faqQ1: "Can I use regular cream instead of evaporated cream in air fryer recipes?"
faqA1: "Yes, but evaporated cream has a thicker consistency and richer flavour, which can affect the outcome. If substituting, adjust the quantity slightly—regular cream is lighter, so you might need less. Always check the recipe for best results."
faqQ2: "How do I store leftover evaporated cream after measuring 2.5 cups?"
faqA2: "Transfer any unused evaporated cream to an airtight container and refrigerate. It typically lasts 3–5 days. For longer storage, freeze it in measured portions (like 20 oz for 2.5 cups) and thaw as needed."
faqQ3: "Why is my air fryer recipe too runny when using evaporated cream?"
faqA3: "This could happen if the measurement is off or the cream isn’t fully incorporated. Double-check that you’ve used 20 oz (2.5 cups) and mix thoroughly. Also, ensure your air fryer isn’t overcrowded, as this can affect cooking."
faqQ4: "Are there low-fat alternatives to evaporated cream for air fryer recipes?"
faqA4: "Yes, evaporated skimmed milk or coconut cream can work, but they’ll alter the texture and taste. Adjust cooking times slightly, as these substitutes may behave differently in the air fryer. Always test a small batch first."

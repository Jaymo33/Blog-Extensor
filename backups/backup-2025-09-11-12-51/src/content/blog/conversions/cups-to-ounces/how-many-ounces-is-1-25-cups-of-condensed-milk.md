faqQ1: "Is 1.25 cups of condensed milk the same as 10 fluid ounces?"
faqA1: "No, 1.25 cups of condensed milk equals about 10.6 weight ounces, not fluid ounces. Condensed milk is much denser than water, so fluid ounce measurements don't apply. Always use weight measurements (ounces by weight) for accuracy in baking and air fryer recipes."
faqQ2: "Can I use evaporated milk instead of condensed milk in air fryer recipes?"
faqA2: "Evaporated milk won't work as a direct substitute because it lacks the sugar content of condensed milk. If you must substitute, mix evaporated milk with sugar (about 1 cup milk + 1¼ cups sugar), but the texture and flavour won't be identical. For best results in air fryer desserts, stick to condensed milk."
faqQ3: "How should I store leftover condensed milk after measuring out 1.25 cups?"
faqA3: "Transfer any unused condensed milk to an airtight container and refrigerate for up to 2 weeks. You can also freeze it for up to 3 months. When ready to use, thaw in the refrigerator overnight and stir well before incorporating into your next air fryer recipe."
faqQ4: "Why do UK recipes sometimes use different measurements for condensed milk?"
faqA4: "UK recipes often list condensed milk by weight (grams or ounces) rather than volume (cups) for greater precision. Since condensed milk's thickness can vary by brand, weighing eliminates inconsistencies. When using US recipes, always convert cup measurements to ounces for reliable results in your UK kitchen."

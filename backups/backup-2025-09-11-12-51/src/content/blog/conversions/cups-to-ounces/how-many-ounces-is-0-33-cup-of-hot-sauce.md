faqQ1: "Can I use the same conversion for all types of hot sauce?"
faqA1: "Most standard hot sauces will follow the 0.33 cup to 2.64-ounce conversion closely. However, very thick or chunky sauces might weigh slightly more. For absolute precision with specialty hot sauces, weighing is best. The difference is usually minimal for most cooking purposes."

faqQ1: "Can I use a kitchen scale to measure 0.375 cup of molasses?"
faqA1: "Yes, a kitchen scale is the most accurate way to measure molasses. Simply set your scale to ounces and pour until it reads 3 ounces, which equals 0.375 cup. This method avoids sticky measuring cups and ensures precision for air fryer recipes."
faqQ2: "How does molasses affect air fryer cooking times?"
faqA2: "Molasses can caramelise quickly in the air fryer due to its sugar content, so watch for over-browning. Recipes with molasses may cook slightly faster, so check a few minutes early. Adjust temperatures slightly lower if needed to prevent burning."
faqQ3: "Is 0.375 cup of molasses the same as 3 fluid ounces?"
faqA3: "Yes, in weight, 0.375 cup of molasses equals 3 ounces. However, fluid ounces measure volume, not weight, so for thick liquids like molasses, weighing is more reliable. Always use ounces (weight) for baking accuracy."
faqQ4: "Can I substitute honey for molasses in a 0.375 cup measurement?"
faqA4: "You can substitute honey, but use 20% less (about 2.4 ounces) since it’s sweeter and thinner. Adjust other liquids in the recipe slightly to compensate. Note that flavour and browning will differ, so expect slight texture changes."

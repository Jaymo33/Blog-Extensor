faqQ1: "Can I use 0.5 cup of raisins interchangeably with 2.5 oz in recipes?"
faqA1: "Yes, 0.5 cup of raisins is roughly equivalent to 2.5 ounces, making them interchangeable in most recipes. However, for baking or air fryer dishes where precision matters, weighing them ensures accuracy."
faqQ2: "Do different types of raisins (e.g., golden vs. regular) weigh the same per 0.5 cup?"
faqA2: "Not exactly. Smaller raisins like golden ones may pack more tightly, increasing the weight slightly. Larger raisins might weigh less per 0.5 cup. For best results, weigh them if your recipe is sensitive to measurements."
faqQ3: "How do I measure 0.5 cup of raisins if I don’t have a measuring cup?"
faqA3: "Use a standard mug and fill it halfway, but note that this is less precise. For accuracy, consider buying a set of measuring cups or a kitchen scale, especially for air fryer recipes where consistency is key."
faqQ4: "Why does my air fryer recipe call for ounces instead of cups for raisins?"
faqA4: "Weight measurements (ounces) are more accurate than volume (cups) because raisins can settle or vary in size. Air fryer recipes often specify weight to ensure even cooking and perfect texture every time."

<p>0.5 cup of raisins equals approximately 2.5 ounces (70 grams). This measurement is essential for air fryer recipes where precision ensures perfect texture and flavour. Whether you're making raisin-studded oatmeal cookies or adding a sweet touch to a savoury dish, knowing the exact weight helps.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on even heat distribution, so ingredient quantities must be precise. Too many raisins in a batter, for example, can lead to uneven cooking. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we emphasise the importance of measurements for consistent results. A slight variation in weight can affect cooking times and textures.</p>  

<p>Raisins add natural sweetness and chewiness to dishes, but their density means volume measurements can be misleading. Using a kitchen scale for 0.5 cup of raisins ensures accuracy. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for other common ingredient conversions.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure 0.5 Cup of Raisins Without a Scale</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a scale, lightly pack the raisins into a measuring cup without crushing them. Fluff them first to avoid compacting, which could skew the weight. For recipes like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>desserts</a>, this method works in a pinch, but a scale is ideal.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for 0.5 Cup of Raisins in Air Fryer Recipes</h2>  
<p>Half a cup of raisins (2.5 oz) is perfect for adding to muffins, granola, or even savoury dishes like Moroccan-inspired tagines. Their natural sugars caramelise beautifully in the air fryer. Try them in our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>raisin and cinnamon oatmeal bars</a> for a quick snack.</p>  

<p>Raisins also work well in stuffed meats or as a topping for roasted vegetables. Their versatility makes them a staple in many <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/breakfast>breakfast</a> and dessert recipes. Just remember: 0.5 cup of raisins equals 2.5 ounces for consistent results.</p>  

<h3>Adjusting Recipes for Different Raisin Sizes</h3>  
<p>Smaller raisins (like golden ones) may pack more densely, so 0.5 cup could weigh slightly more. Larger varieties, such as jumbo raisins, might weigh less per cup. Always check your recipe’s requirements and adjust accordingly.</p>  

<h2>Storing Raisins for Air Fryer Recipes</h2>  
<p>Keep raisins in an airtight container to maintain freshness. If they dry out, soak them in warm water for 10 minutes before use. For more tips on keeping your air fryer ingredients fresh, visit our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning and storage guide</a>.</p>  

<p>Proper storage ensures your 0.5 cup of raisins stays at the ideal weight and texture. Stale raisins can throw off measurements and affect your dish’s outcome. Always measure before adding to your air fryer recipes.</p>

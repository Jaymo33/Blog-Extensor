faqQ1: "Can I use fresh corn instead of frozen for this measurement?"
faqA1: "Yes, but fresh corn kernels weigh slightly less than frozen due to water content. For 0.75 cup, you’d need about 3.2 oz of fresh corn. Adjust cooking time in the air fryer, as fresh corn cooks faster than frozen."
faqQ2: "How do I convert 0.75 cup of frozen corn to grams?"
faqA2: "0.75 cup of frozen corn is roughly 99 grams. This conversion is useful for recipes using metric measurements. A kitchen scale ensures accuracy, especially for air fryer cooking where precision affects results."
faqQ3: "Why does my air fryer frozen corn turn out soggy?"
faqA3: "Sogginess usually means overcrowding or insufficient preheating. For 0.75 cup (3.5 oz), spread corn evenly in the basket. Preheat the air fryer to 200°C and shake halfway through cooking for crispiness."
faqQ4: "Can I season frozen corn before air frying?"
faqA4: "Absolutely! Toss 0.75 cup (3.5 oz) of frozen corn with oil, salt, and spices before cooking. Paprika or garlic powder adds great flavour. Just avoid wet seasonings, as they can make the corn steam instead of crisp."

faqQ1: "Can I use instant oats instead of rolled oats for this measurement?"
faqA1: "Yes, but the weight may differ slightly. Instant oats are more finely cut, so 0.75 cup could weigh around 2 ounces (57 grams). Adjust your recipe accordingly for the best texture in air fryer cooking."
faqQ2: "Why does my air fryer recipe with oats turn out soggy?"
faqA2: "Sogginess often comes from overcrowding or uneven distribution. Ensure your 0.75 cup (2.25 oz) of oats is spread evenly in the basket. Also, check that your air fryer isn’t overloaded, as this traps moisture."
faqQ3: "How do I store leftover rolled oats after measuring?"
faqA3: "Keep unused rolled oats in an airtight container in a cool, dry place. They’ll stay fresh for up to 6 months. For longer storage, freeze them in portions—just thaw before using in recipes."
faqQ4: "Can I substitute steel-cut oats for rolled oats in air fryer recipes?"
faqA4: "Steel-cut oats are denser and take longer to cook. For 0.75 cup, you’d need about 2.5 ounces (71 grams), but they may require pre-soaking or adjusting cooking times in the air fryer. Rolled oats work best for most recipes."

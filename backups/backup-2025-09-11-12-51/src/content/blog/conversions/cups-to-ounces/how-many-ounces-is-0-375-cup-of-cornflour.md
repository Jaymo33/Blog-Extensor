faqQ1: "Can I use plain flour instead of cornflour for this measurement?"
faqA1: "While you can substitute plain flour, the results will differ. Cornflour creates a crispier texture in air fryer cooking. If substituting, use the same 0.375 cup (1.5 oz) measurement, but expect a slightly different outcome. For best results, stick to cornflour when the recipe specifically calls for it."
faqQ2: "How do I measure 0.375 cup without a measuring cup?"
faqA2: "If you don’t have a measuring cup, use tablespoons – 0.375 cup equals 6 tablespoons. Alternatively, weigh 1.5 ounces on a kitchen scale. For small amounts like this, a digital scale provides the most accurate measurement for air fryer recipes."
faqQ3: "Does the brand of cornflour affect the weight measurement?"
faqA3: "Different brands can have slight density variations, but the difference is minimal. The 0.375 cup to 1.5 ounce conversion works for most UK cornflour brands. For absolute precision in air fryer cooking, weighing your ingredients is always best."
faqQ4: "Why do some recipes use cups while others use ounces for cornflour?"
faqA4: "Cups are convenient for quick measuring, while ounces offer more precision. Many UK recipes provide both measurements. The 0.375 cup (1.5 oz) measurement is particularly useful for small batches in air fryer cooking where accuracy matters."

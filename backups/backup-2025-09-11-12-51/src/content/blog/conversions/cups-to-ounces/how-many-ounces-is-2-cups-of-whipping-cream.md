faqQ1: "Does 2 cups of whipping cream weigh the same as 2 cups of water?"
faqA1: "No, 2 cups of whipping cream weighs slightly more than water due to its higher fat content. While water is 16 ounces per 2 cups, whipping cream is around 16.5 ounces because of its density. Always use a scale for precision in air fryer recipes."
faqQ2: "Can I use ml instead of ounces for measuring whipping cream?"
faqA2: "Yes, 2 cups of whipping cream equals roughly 473 ml. However, ounces are more precise for air fryer cooking since weight measurements account for density variations. For best results, stick to ounces or grams."
faqQ3: "How does whipped cream volume compare to liquid whipping cream?"
faqA3: "Whipping doubles the volume but not the weight. So 2 cups (16 oz) of liquid whipping cream becomes about 4 cups whipped, still weighing 16 ounces. This matters for air fryer recipes where aeration affects cooking."
faqQ4: "Why do some recipes list whipping cream in grams instead of ounces?"
faqA4: "Many UK and European recipes use grams for greater precision. 2 cups (16 oz) of whipping cream equals about 454 grams. For air fryer baking, grams eliminate measurement inconsistencies between liquid and dry cups."

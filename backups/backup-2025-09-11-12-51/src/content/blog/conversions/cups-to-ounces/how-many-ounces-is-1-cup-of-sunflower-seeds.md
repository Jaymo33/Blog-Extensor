faqQ1: "Does 1 cup of sunflower seeds equal 8 ounces?"
faqA1: "No, 1 cup of sunflower seeds weighs about 4.5 ounces, not 8. The 8-ounce misconception likely comes from liquid measurements, where 1 cup of water equals 8 fluid ounces. For dry ingredients like seeds, weight varies by density."
faqQ2: "How do I measure 1 cup of sunflower seeds without a scale?"
faqA2: "Use a dry measuring cup and fill it loosely without packing the seeds down. Level the top with a straight edge for accuracy. For smaller amounts, a tablespoon holds roughly 0.25 oz of sunflower seeds."
faqQ3: "Can I use sunflower seed weight for other nuts in air fryer recipes?"
faqA3: "Similar-sized nuts like pumpkin seeds have comparable weights, but larger nuts (e.g., almonds) differ. Always check a conversion chart. For mixed nuts, weigh each type separately to ensure even roasting in the air fryer."
faqQ4: "Why do my sunflower seeds burn in the air fryer?"
faqA4: "Overcrowding or excessive heat causes burning. Use no more than 1 cup (4.5 oz) per batch and cook at 160°C (320°F). Shake the basket halfway. If seeds have added oil, reduce cooking time by 1–2 minutes."

<p>1 cup of sunflower seeds weighs approximately 4.5 ounces (128 grams). This measurement is key for air fryer recipes, ensuring perfect texture and even cooking. Whether you're roasting them for a snack or using them in a dish, knowing the weight helps avoid over or under-seasoning.

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air frying</h2>  
<p>Precision is crucial when using an air fryer, as uneven quantities can lead to inconsistent results. Sunflower seeds, for example, roast best when spread in a single layer. Too many seeds can cause steaming instead of crisping. Too few might burn quickly. Measuring by weight (ounces) rather than volume (cups) ensures reliability, especially for recipes like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer granola</a> or seed mixes.</p>  
<p>Air fryers circulate hot air rapidly, so dense ingredients like sunflower seeds need space to crisp evenly. A kitchen scale is handy, but if you only have measuring cups, remember: 1 cup of sunflower seeds = 4.5 oz. For larger batches, multiply accordingly—2 cups would be 9 oz. Always shake the basket mid-cook for even browning.</p>  

<h2>Converting cups to ounces for sunflower seeds</h2>  
<p>While 1 cup of sunflower seeds equals 4.5 oz, slight variations exist based on packing density. Lightly packed seeds may weigh closer to 4 oz, while firmly packed can reach 5 oz. For UK cooks, note that 1 UK cup (284 ml) holds slightly more than a US cup (240 ml), but the ounce conversion remains similar.

<h3>How to measure sunflower seeds for air frying</h3>  
<p>For best results, spoon seeds into a measuring cup without pressing down, then level the top. If using a scale, tare the bowl first. Roast at 160°C (320°F) for 5–8 minutes, shaking halfway. Try adding them to <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>air-fried vegetables</a> for extra crunch.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for sunflower seeds in air fryers</h2>  
<p>Beyond snacking, sunflower seeds add texture to coatings for chicken or fish. Mix 1 cup (4.5 oz) with breadcrumbs for a nutty crust. They also work well in <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/breakfast>breakfast recipes</a> like granola bars. Store leftovers in an airtight container—they stay fresh for weeks.</p>

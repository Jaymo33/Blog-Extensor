faqQ1: "Does 2 cups of cornflour weigh the same as 2 cups of flour?"
faqA1: "No, cornflour and plain flour have different densities. Two cups of cornflour weigh approximately 9.6 oz, while 2 cups of plain flour weigh around 9 oz. Always check recipe requirements, as substituting without adjusting quantities can affect texture."
faqQ2: "Can I use a UK measuring cup for US recipes calling for 2 cups of cornflour?"
faqA2: "Yes, but note the slight difference in volume. A UK cup (250ml) holds more than a US cup (240ml). For precision, adjust the weight—2 UK cups of cornflour equal about 10 oz, whereas 2 US cups are roughly 9.6 oz."
faqQ3: "How do I convert 2 cups of cornflour to grams?"
faqA3: "Two cups of cornflour convert to roughly 272 grams. This is useful for recipes using metric measurements. If scaling up or down, remember that 1 cup equals 136 grams for consistent results in baking or frying."
faqQ4: "Why does my air fryer recipe turn out soggy with 2 cups of cornflour?"
faqA4: "Sogginess often stems from overcrowding or insufficient preheating. Even with accurate measurements (2 cups = 9.6 oz), ensure the air fryer basket isn’t packed tightly. Preheat the appliance and shake the basket mid-cook for even crispiness."

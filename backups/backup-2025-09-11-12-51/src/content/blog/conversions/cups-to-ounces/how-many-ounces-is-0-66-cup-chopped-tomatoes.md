faqQ1: "Can I use canned tomatoes instead of fresh for 0.66 cup measurements?"

faqA2: "Air fryers cook quickly, so dishes with 0.66 cup of chopped tomatoes usually take 8–12 minutes at 180°C. Stir halfway for even cooking. For saucy recipes, extend time by 2–3 minutes if needed."

faqQ4: "Can I freeze 0.66 cup portions of chopped tomatoes for later use?"

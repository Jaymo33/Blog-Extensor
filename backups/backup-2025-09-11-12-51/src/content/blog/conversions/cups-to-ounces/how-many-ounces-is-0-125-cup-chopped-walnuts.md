faqQ1: "Can I use whole walnuts instead of chopped for 0.125 cup measurements?"
faqA1: "Yes, but whole walnuts take up more space, so the weight will differ. For 0.125 cup, you’d need slightly fewer whole walnuts to match the 0.5 oz weight of chopped ones. Chop them evenly for consistent results in air fryer recipes."
faqQ2: "How do I toast 0.125 cup of chopped walnuts in an air fryer?"
faqA2: "Spread the walnuts in a single layer in the air fryer basket. Cook at 160°C for 3–4 minutes, shaking halfway. Toasting enhances their flavour, perfect for salads or <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>desserts</a>."
faqQ3: "Does the type of walnut affect the 0.125 cup to ounce conversion?"
faqA3: "All walnut varieties (English, black, etc.) have similar densities when chopped. The 0.125 cup = 0.5 oz rule applies broadly, but for absolute precision, use a scale—especially for baking."
faqQ4: "Can I substitute other nuts for chopped walnuts in air fryer recipes?"
faqA4: "Yes, almonds or pecans work, but adjust quantities slightly. For example, 0.125 cup of chopped almonds weighs about 0.6 oz. Always check our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a> for specifics."

faqQ1: "Can I use fresh milk instead of evaporated milk in air fryer recipes?"
faqA1: "Yes, but you’ll need to adjust the quantity. Since evaporated milk is concentrated, replace 0.75 cup (6 oz) with 1.5 cups of fresh milk and reduce other liquids slightly. Keep in mind the texture may be lighter."
faqQ2: "Why is my air fryer recipe too runny when using evaporated milk?"
faqA2: "This usually happens if the measurement is off. Double-check you’ve used 6 ounces (0.75 cup) of evaporated milk. Also, ensure your air fryer isn’t overcrowded, as poor circulation can prevent proper thickening."
faqQ3: "How do I store leftover evaporated milk after measuring 0.75 cup?"
faqA3: "Transfer leftovers to an airtight container and refrigerate for up to 5 days. Stir well before reusing, as separation can occur. For longer storage, freeze in ice cube trays (1 oz portions work well)."
faqQ4: "Does UK evaporated milk weigh the same as US evaporated milk per cup?"
faqA4: "Yes, the weight difference is negligible. Both UK and US evaporated milk will weigh roughly 6 ounces per 0.75 cup. Always check the label for specific brand variations, though."

Measuring 0.75 cup of evaporated milk as 6 ounces ensures your dish turns out just right.</p>  

<p>Evaporated milk is thicker than regular milk, so volume-to-weight conversions are especially useful. If you’re adapting a recipe from cups to ounces, this conversion saves time and reduces guesswork.

faqQ1: "Can I use solid coconut oil instead of melted for air frying?"
faqA1: "Yes, you can use solid coconut oil, but it’s best to melt it slightly for even distribution. Grating solid coconut oil over food works well too, especially for coatings or batters."
faqQ2: "Does the type of coconut oil affect the conversion from cups to ounces?"
faqA2: "No, whether refined or unrefined, 1.25 cups of coconut oil will always equal approximately 10 ounces. The density remains consistent regardless of the type."
faqQ3: "How do I measure 1.25 cups of coconut oil if I don’t have a measuring cup?"
faqA3: "If you don’t have a measuring cup, use a kitchen scale to weigh out 10 ounces. Alternatively, 1.25 cups is equivalent to 20 tablespoons, which can be measured with a tablespoon."
faqQ4: "Can I substitute coconut oil with other oils in air fryer recipes?"
faqA4: "Yes, but adjust quantities as needed. For example, olive oil has a similar density, so 1.25 cups would also be around 10 ounces. Always check smoke points for safe air frying."

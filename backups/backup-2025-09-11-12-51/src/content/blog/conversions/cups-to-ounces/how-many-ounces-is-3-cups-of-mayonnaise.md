<p>3 cups of mayonnaise equals approximately 24 ounces. This conversion is essential for precise cooking, especially when using an air fryer where measurements can make or break a recipe. Whether you're whipping up a batch of crispy chicken or a creamy dip, knowing how to convert 3 cups of mayonnaise to ounces ensures consistency and perfect results every time.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on precise ingredient ratios to achieve the perfect texture and flavour. Too much or too little mayonnaise can affect the crispiness or moisture of your dish. For example, if you're making <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer chicken tenders</a>, the right amount of mayonnaise in your coating ensures a golden, crunchy exterior. Accurate measurements also help when scaling recipes up or down, so you never waste ingredients.</p>  

<p>Mayonnaise is a common ingredient in many air fryer recipes, from dips to marinades. If you're unsure about conversions, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> can be a handy reference. It covers everything from cups to ounces, grams, and millilitres, making it easier to follow any recipe without guesswork.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure Mayonnaise Correctly</h3>  
<p>Measuring mayonnaise can be tricky due to its thick consistency. For the most accurate results, use a liquid measuring cup for fluids or a kitchen scale for weight.

If you're converting to ounces, remember that 1 cup of mayonnaise is roughly 8 ounces, so 3 cups would be 24 ounces.</p>

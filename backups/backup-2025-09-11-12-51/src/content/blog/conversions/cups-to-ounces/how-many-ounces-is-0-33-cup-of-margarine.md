faqQ1: "Can I use butter instead of margarine in air fryer recipes?"
faqA1: "Yes, you can substitute butter for margarine in most air fryer recipes. Use the same amount by weight (2.64 ounces for 0.33 cup), but be aware that butter contains more water, which might slightly affect texture. For best results, consider reducing other liquids in the recipe slightly when using butter."
faqQ2: "How do I measure 0.33 cup of margarine without a measuring cup?"
faqA2: "If you don't have a measuring cup, you can use tablespoons - 0.33 cup equals 5 tablespoons plus 1 teaspoon of margarine. Alternatively, use a kitchen scale to measure out 2.64 ounces. Many margarine packages also have markings on the wrapper to help you measure portions accurately."
faqQ3: "Does the type of margarine affect the weight measurement?"
faqA3: "Different margarine brands can vary slightly in density, but the difference is usually minimal for home cooking purposes. Stick margarine tends to be more consistent in weight than tub varieties. For precise baking, it's always best to weigh your ingredients rather than relying solely on volume measurements."
faqQ4: "Why is weight measurement better than volume for margarine?"
faqA4: "Weight measurements are more accurate because margarine can be packed differently in a measuring cup, affecting the actual amount. Measuring by ounces ensures consistency, especially important in baking where precise ratios affect the final product. This is particularly crucial for air fryer recipes where even cooking is essential."

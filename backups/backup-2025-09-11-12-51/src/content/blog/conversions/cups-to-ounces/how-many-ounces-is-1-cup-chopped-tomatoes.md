faqQ1: "Does the type of tomato affect how many ounces are in 1 cup?"
faqA1: "Yes, tomato variety can slightly impact the weight. Juicier tomatoes like beefsteak may weigh more due to higher water content, while denser Roma tomatoes often give more consistent measurements. However, the difference is usually minimal - about 0.5 oz either way."
faqQ2: "How should I measure 1 cup of chopped tomatoes for the most accurate ounce conversion?"
faqA2: "For precision, use a kitchen scale. If measuring by volume, chop tomatoes uniformly and lightly fill the cup without packing too tightly. Drain excess juice if your recipe specifies \"drained chopped tomatoes\" as liquid can add extra weight."
faqQ3: "Can I use this same conversion for cherry or grape tomatoes?"
faqA3: "Smaller tomatoes have a different cup-to-ounce ratio due to their shape and air gaps when chopped. One cup of halved cherry tomatoes weighs about 5-6 ounces. Always check specific conversions for different tomato types when precision matters."
faqQ4: "Why does my 1 cup measurement of chopped tomatoes sometimes vary in weight?"
faqA4: "Natural variations in tomato size, juiciness, and how finely you chop them can cause slight weight differences. The 8-ounce measurement is an average - actual weight may range between 7.5-8.5 oz per cup depending on these factors."

<p>If your recipe uses canned chopped tomatoes, check the weight on the label as it may differ slightly from fresh. For fresh tomatoes, Roma or plum varieties often yield the most consistent cup-to-ounce ratio.

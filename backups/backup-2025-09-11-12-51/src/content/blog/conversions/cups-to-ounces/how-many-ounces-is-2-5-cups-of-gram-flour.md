faqQ1: "Can I use a regular cup to measure gram flour for air fryer recipes?"
faqA1: "While you can use a standard measuring cup, for the most accurate results, a kitchen scale is best. Gram flour can settle or become compacted, affecting the weight. If using cups, fluff the flour first and level it off for consistency."
faqQ2: "Does the type of gram flour affect the 2.5 cups to ounces conversion?"
faqA2: "Slight variations may occur based on brand or how finely the gram flour is milled. However, 2.5 cups generally converts to around 10.6 oz. For precision, always check the packaging or weigh it yourself."
faqQ3: "How do I adjust air fryer cooking times when using gram flour?"
faqA3: "Gram flour cooks faster than wheat flour due to its finer texture. Start with shorter cooking times and check frequently. Recipes using 2.5 cups (10.6 oz) may need slight adjustments based on your air fryer model."
faqQ4: "Can I substitute gram flour with another type in air fryer recipes?"
faqA4: "Gram flour has unique binding properties, so substitutes like almond flour or rice flour may alter texture. If replacing, adjust quantities slightly and expect differences in crispiness. Always test small batches first."

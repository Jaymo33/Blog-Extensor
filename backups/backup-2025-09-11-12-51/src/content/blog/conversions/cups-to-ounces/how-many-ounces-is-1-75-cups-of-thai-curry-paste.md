faqQ1: "Can I use grams instead of ounces for thai curry paste measurements?"
faqA1: "Yes, you can use grams instead of ounces. 1.75 cups of thai curry paste is approximately 396 grams. Many kitchen scales allow you to switch between units, making it easy to measure in either system. This is particularly useful if you're following European or UK recipes that typically use metric measurements."
faqQ2: "Does the type of thai curry paste affect the weight per cup?"
faqA2: "Different types of thai curry paste (red, green, or yellow) have slightly varying densities due to their ingredients. However, the difference in weight per cup is minimal for most cooking purposes. Whether you're using 1.75 cups of red or green paste, it will still be roughly 14 ounces. For precise measurements, always check the specific brand's packaging if available."
faqQ3: "How can I measure thai curry paste without a measuring cup?"
faqA3: "If you don't have measuring cups, you can use tablespoons as an alternative. There are 16 tablespoons in 1 cup, so 1.75 cups would be 28 tablespoons. Alternatively, use a kitchen scale to measure out 14 ounces directly. This method is often more accurate for thick ingredients like curry paste that can be difficult to level in cups."
faqQ4: "Can I freeze thai curry paste in measured portions?"
faqA4: "Absolutely! Freezing thai curry paste in pre-measured portions is a great time-saver. You can freeze 1.75 cup (14 ounce) batches or smaller amounts in ice cube trays (about 1 ounce per cube). When frozen solid, transfer the cubes to a freezer bag. This way, you'll always have the right amount ready for your next air fryer recipe without needing to measure each time."

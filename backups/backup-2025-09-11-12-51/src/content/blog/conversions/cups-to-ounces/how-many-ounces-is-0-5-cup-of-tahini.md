faqQ1: "How do I measure 0.5 cup of tahini without a scale?"
faqA1: "Use a dry measuring cup and lightly grease it with oil to help the tahini slide out. Fill the cup evenly without packing it down, then level off the top with a straight edge. For sticky ingredients like tahini, this method gives a close approximation to 4.23 oz."
faqQ2: "Can I substitute another nut butter for tahini in recipes?"
faqA2: "While almond or peanut butter can work in some recipes, they’ll alter the flavour. Tahini has a distinct nutty, slightly bitter taste that’s hard to replicate. For authentic results, stick to tahini when the recipe calls for it, especially in air fryer dishes where flavours concentrate."
faqQ3: "Why does my tahini measurement seem inconsistent?"
faqA3: "Tahini separates, with oil rising to the top. Always stir it thoroughly before measuring to ensure uniformity. If you measure without mixing, you might get more oil or paste, skewing your 0.5 cup (4.23 oz) measurement. A well-mixed tahini gives reliable results."
faqQ4: "How should I store tahini after opening?"
faqA4: "Keep tahini in an airtight container in the fridge, where it’ll last for months. Stir it well before each use, as separation is natural. If your tahini hardens, let it sit at room temperature briefly or warm it slightly for easier measuring."

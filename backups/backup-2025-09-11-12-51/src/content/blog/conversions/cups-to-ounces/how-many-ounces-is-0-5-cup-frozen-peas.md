faqQ1: "Can I use fresh peas instead of frozen in air fryer recipes?"
faqA1: "Yes, you can substitute fresh peas, but adjust cooking times slightly. Fresh peas may cook faster than frozen, so reduce the time by 1-2 minutes. Use the same weight (2.5 ounces for 0.5 cup) for accurate results."
faqQ2: "Do I need to thaw frozen peas before air frying?"
faqA2: "No, you can air fry frozen peas directly from the freezer. Thawing isn’t necessary and can make them mushy. Cooking them frozen ensures they retain texture and cook evenly in the air fryer."
faqQ3: "How do I convert 0.5 cup of frozen peas to grams?"
faqA3: "0.5 cup of frozen peas is approximately 71 grams. This conversion is useful for recipes requiring metric measurements. A kitchen scale ensures the most accurate results for air fryer cooking."
faqQ4: "Can I cook 0.5 cup of frozen peas with other vegetables?"
faqA4: "Absolutely! Frozen peas pair well with carrots, corn, or green beans in the air fryer. Adjust cooking times based on the densest vegetable in the mix. Keep portions even for uniform results."

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air frying</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on precise ingredient quantities to achieve even cooking and perfect texture. Using too many or too few frozen peas can affect cooking times and results. For example, overcrowding the basket with excess peas may lead to unevenly cooked or soggy results. On the other hand, too few peas might dry out or burn quickly. Measuring 0.5 cup of frozen peas (2.5 ounces) ensures your dish turns out just right.</p>  

<p>Many air fryer recipes, like those on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>our recipe hub</a>, specify measurements in cups or ounces for convenience. Frozen peas are a versatile ingredient, perfect for sides, stir-fries, or even as part of a larger meal. Whether you’re making a quick vegetable side or adding them to a protein dish, knowing the weight helps maintain consistency.</p>  

<h3>How to measure frozen peas correctly</h3>  
<p>To measure 0.5 cup of frozen peas, use a dry measuring cup and fill it loosely without packing them down. Frozen peas should be measured while still frozen for accuracy, as thawing can alter their volume. If you don’t have a measuring cup, a kitchen scale is the best alternative—simply weigh out 2.5 ounces. This method is especially useful for recipes requiring exact proportions, such as air fryer casseroles or mixed vegetable dishes.</p>  

<h2>Best air fryer recipes using 0.5 cup frozen peas</h2>  
<p>Frozen peas are a staple in many air fryer dishes, from quick sides to hearty mains. One popular option is air-fried pea fritters, where 0.5 cup of peas (2.5 ounces) blends perfectly with batter for crispy bites. Another great choice is a vegetable medley—combine peas with carrots and corn for a colourful, nutritious side.

<p>For a protein-packed meal, try adding 0.5 cup of frozen peas to air-fried chicken or fish dishes. The peas cook quickly alongside the protein, making for a balanced meal in minutes. If you’re meal prepping, pre-measured portions of frozen peas save time and ensure consistency. Whether you’re cooking for one or a family, accurate measurements make all the difference.</p>  

<h3>Tips for cooking frozen peas in the air fryer</h3>  
<p>To get the best results, preheat your air fryer before adding frozen peas. Spread them evenly in the basket to ensure even cooking—no need for oil, as peas naturally retain moisture. Cook at 180°C (356°F) for 5-7 minutes, shaking the basket halfway. For added flavour, season with a pinch of salt, pepper, or herbs after cooking. Cleaning your air fryer afterwards?

<h2>Common mistakes when measuring frozen peas</h2>  
<p>One of the biggest mistakes is using a liquid measuring cup instead of a dry one, which can lead to inaccurate amounts. Another error is thawing peas before measuring, as this increases their volume and skews results. Always measure 0.5 cup of frozen peas while they’re still frozen for consistency. Overpacking the measuring cup is another pitfall—lightly fill it to the brim for the correct 2.5-ounce portion.</p>  

<p>If you’re scaling up a recipe, remember that 1 cup of frozen peas equals roughly 5 ounces. Doubling or halving measurements requires precision to maintain the dish’s balance.

faqQ1: "Can I use a liquid measuring cup for tahini?"
faqA1: "Yes, but for accuracy, a dry measuring cup or kitchen scale is better. Tahini’s thick texture can cling to liquid cups, leading to uneven measurements. If using a liquid cup, spoon the tahini in gently and level it off."
faqQ2: "Why does my tahini measurement seem off?"
faqA2: "Tahini settles and separates over time, so always stir it thoroughly before measuring. If the oil isn’t fully incorporated, your 1.66 cups (13.28 oz) could be inconsistent. A good stir ensures a uniform texture and precise amounts."
faqQ3: "How do I clean tahini residue from my air fryer basket?"
faqA3: "Use warm, soapy water and a soft sponge, or try our recommended <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner</a>. Avoid abrasive scrubbers that could damage the non-stick coating. For sticky tahini drips, a brief soak loosens the residue."
faqQ4: "Can I substitute tahini with another ingredient in air fryer recipes?"
faqA4: "For similar richness, almond or cashew butter works, but the flavour will differ. Tahini’s nutty, slightly bitter taste is unique. If substituting, adjust other seasonings to balance the dish. Check our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipes</a> for tahini-free alternatives."

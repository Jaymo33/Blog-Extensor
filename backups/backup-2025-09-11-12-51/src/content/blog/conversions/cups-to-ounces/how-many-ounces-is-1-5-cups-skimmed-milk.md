faqQ1: "Can I use whole milk instead of skimmed milk for 1.5 cups in air fryer recipes?"
faqA1: "Yes, you can substitute whole milk for skimmed milk, but keep in mind it’s slightly denser. While 1.5 cups of skimmed milk equals 12 ounces, whole milk may weigh a tad more. Adjustments might be needed for recipes requiring precise moisture levels."
faqQ2: "How do I measure 1.5 cups of skimmed milk without a measuring cup?"
faqA2: "If you don’t have a measuring cup, use a kitchen scale to weigh 12 ounces of skimmed milk. Alternatively, a standard UK mug holds roughly 1 cup (8 ounces), so 1.5 cups would be 1 mug plus half another."
faqQ3: "Does skimmed milk behave differently in air fryer recipes compared to other liquids?"
faqA3: "Skimmed milk works similarly to other liquids in air fryers but has less fat, which can affect browning and richness. For best results, stick to the recipe’s specified milk type or adjust cooking times slightly if substituting."
faqQ4: "Why is 1.5 cups of skimmed milk 12 ounces when water is different?"
faqA4: "Milk is slightly denser than water, but skimmed milk’s weight per cup is close enough to water’s for most recipes. For precise baking, always weigh ingredients, especially in air fryer cooking where consistency matters."

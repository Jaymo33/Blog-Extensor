faqQ1: "Is 1.75 cups of tahini the same as 14 ounces in the UK?"
faqA1: "Yes, 1.75 cups of tahini equals 14 ounces in both UK and US measurements. While the UK typically uses metric, this cup-to-ounce conversion remains consistent. For air fryer recipes, weighing tahini (14 oz) often gives more accurate results than measuring by volume."
faqQ2: "Can I use a kitchen scale instead of measuring cups for tahini?"
faqA2: "Absolutely! Using a kitchen scale to measure 14 ounces (1.75 cups) of tahini is actually more precise. Tahini's thick consistency can make cup measurements inconsistent. Place your bowl on the scale, tare it to zero, then add tahini until you reach 14 oz for perfect results every time."
faqQ3: "How long will 1.75 cups (14 oz) of tahini last in recipes?"
faqA3: "1.75 cups (14 oz) of tahini will make about 4-6 portions of hummus or 8-10 servings of sauce, depending on the recipe. For air fryer cooking, this amount typically covers 2-3 batches of marinades for proteins like chicken or vegetables. Store any unused tahini properly to maintain freshness."
faqQ4: "Why do some air fryer recipes use ounces instead of cups for tahini?"
faqA4: "Ounces provide more consistent measurements for thick ingredients like tahini. In air fryer cooking, precise quantities affect cooking times and texture. Measuring 14 ounces (1.75 cups) by weight eliminates packing differences and ensures your sauces and marinades have the right consistency for perfect air frying results."

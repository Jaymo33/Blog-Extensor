faqQ1: "Can I use cow’s milk instead of goat milk in air fryer recipes?"
faqA1: "Yes, you can substitute cow’s milk for goat milk in most recipes. However, goat milk has a tangier flavour and slightly different fat content, so the taste and texture may vary slightly. Adjustments might be needed for baking recipes."
faqQ2: "How do I measure 1.25 cups of goat milk without a measuring cup?"
faqA2: "If you don’t have a measuring cup, use a kitchen scale. 1.25 cups of goat milk is roughly 10 fluid ounces or 295 grams. Alternatively, a standard mug holds about 1 cup, so fill it to the brim and add a quarter more."
faqQ3: "Does goat milk affect cooking times in an air fryer?"
faqA3: "Goat milk itself doesn’t significantly alter cooking times, but the moisture content might. If your batter or sauce is runnier due to extra goat milk, you may need to adjust cooking times slightly. Always check for doneness a few minutes early."

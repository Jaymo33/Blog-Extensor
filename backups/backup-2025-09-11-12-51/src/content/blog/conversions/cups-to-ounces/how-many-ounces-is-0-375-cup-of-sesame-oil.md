faqQ1: "How do I measure 0.375 cup of sesame oil without a measuring cup?"
faqA1: "If you don’t have a measuring cup, use a kitchen scale to weigh out 3 ounces (85 grams) of sesame oil. Alternatively, 0.375 cup is equivalent to 6 tablespoons, which can be measured with a standard spoon set."
faqQ2: "Can I substitute another oil for sesame oil in air fryer recipes?"
faqA2: "Yes, but sesame oil has a distinct flavour, so substitutes like peanut or vegetable oil will alter the taste. For neutral flavours, use light olive oil, but reduce the quantity slightly as sesame oil is more potent."
faqQ3: "Why is my air fryer food greasy when using sesame oil?"
faqA3: "Using too much sesame oil can lead to greasy results. Stick to 0.375 cup (3 oz) or less, and toss food evenly to distribute the oil. Overcrowding the basket can also trap excess oil."
faqQ4: "How long does sesame oil last in the pantry?"
faqA4: "Unopened sesame oil lasts up to a year, while opened bottles should be used within 6 months for best flavour. Store it in a cool, dark place to prevent rancidity."

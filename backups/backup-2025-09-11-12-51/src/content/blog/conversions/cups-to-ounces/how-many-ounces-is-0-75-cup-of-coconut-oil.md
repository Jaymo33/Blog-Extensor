faqQ1: "Can I use 0.75 cup of coconut oil for all air fryer recipes?"

faqQ2: "How do I convert 0.75 cup of coconut oil to grams?"
faqA2: "0.75 cup of coconut oil weighs approximately 170 grams. This conversion is useful if your kitchen scale uses metric measurements. For precise air fryer cooking, grams can be more accurate than ounces or cups."

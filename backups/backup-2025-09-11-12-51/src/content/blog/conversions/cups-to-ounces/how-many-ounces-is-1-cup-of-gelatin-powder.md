faqQ1: "Does the type of gelatin powder affect the weight per cup?"
faqA1: "Yes, different brands or formulations (like flavoured vs. unflavoured) can slightly alter the weight. However, 1 cup of standard unflavoured gelatin powder typically weighs around 8 ounces. Always check the packaging for precise measurements."
faqQ2: "Can I use volume measurements instead of weighing gelatin powder?"
faqA2: "While measuring by volume (cups) works, weighing gelatin powder in ounces ensures greater accuracy, especially for delicate recipes. A kitchen scale eliminates guesswork and guarantees consistent results in air fryer dishes."
faqQ3: "How do I convert grams to ounces for gelatin powder?"
faqA3: "To convert grams to ounces, divide the gram measurement by 28.35. For example, 100 grams of gelatin powder equals roughly 3.5 ounces. Our conversion chart simplifies these calculations for air fryer recipes."
faqQ4: "Why does my gelatin-based dessert turn out too firm in the air fryer?"
faqA4: "Over-measuring gelatin powder can cause excessive firmness. Stick to the 1 cup to 8 ounces ratio, and avoid high heat settings in the air fryer, which may accelerate setting. Pre-chilling mixtures before air frying helps control texture."

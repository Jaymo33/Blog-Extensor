faqQ1: "Can I use minced garlic instead of chopped for the 1.66 cups measurement?"
faqA1: "Yes, minced garlic can be used interchangeably with chopped garlic in most recipes. However, minced garlic is slightly denser, so you might need a tiny bit less by volume. For accuracy, weigh it—1.66 cups of minced garlic is still roughly 13.28 ounces."
faqQ2: "How long does 1.66 cups of chopped garlic last in the fridge?"
faqA2: "Fresh chopped garlic stored in an airtight container will last about 1 week in the fridge. For longer storage, freeze it in portions. Just note that frozen garlic may lose some pungency, so adjust quantities in your air fryer recipes accordingly."
faqQ3: "Does the type of garlic affect the weight conversion?"
faqA3: "Most common garlic varieties, like softneck or hardneck, have similar densities when chopped. However, elephant garlic (milder and larger) will yield slightly different weights. Stick to standard garlic for the 1.66 cups = 13.28 ounces conversion."
faqQ4: "Can I substitute garlic powder for 1.66 cups of chopped garlic?"
faqA4: "Garlic powder is more concentrated. For 1.66 cups (13.28 ounces) of chopped garlic, use about 5 tablespoons of powder. Rehydrate it with a bit of water to mimic fresh garlic’s texture in air fryer dishes."

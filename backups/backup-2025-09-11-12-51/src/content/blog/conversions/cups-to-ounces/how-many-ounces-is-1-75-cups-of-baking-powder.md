faqQ1: "Can I use grams instead of ounces for 1.75 cups of baking powder?"
faqA1: "Absolutely! 1.75 cups of baking powder converts to approximately 411 grams. Many UK cooks prefer using metric measurements for even greater precision in their air fryer recipes. Digital kitchen scales that switch between units make this conversion easy."
faqQ2: "How does altitude affect 1.75 cups of baking powder in recipes?"
faqA2: "At higher altitudes, you might need to slightly reduce the amount of baking powder. For 1.75 cups (14.5 ounces), try decreasing by about 1/4 to 1/2 teaspoon per cup. The lower air pressure causes baked goods to rise more quickly, so less leavening is needed."
faqQ3: "What's the difference between baking powder and baking soda in these measurements?"
faqA3: "Baking powder and baking soda have different weights and strengths. While 1.75 cups of baking powder equals 14.5 ounces, the same volume of baking soda would weigh slightly less (about 12.25 ounces). They're not interchangeable in recipes without adjusting other ingredients too."
faqQ4: "How long will 1.75 cups of baking powder last once opened?"
faqA4: "An opened container of baking powder typically stays effective for 6-12 months when stored properly. Since 1.75 cups is about half a standard UK baking powder package, you'll want to use it within a few months for best results in your air fryer recipes. Always check for freshness before use."

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>
<p>Air fryers rely on precise ingredient ratios to achieve the perfect texture and rise. Too much or too little baking powder can lead to dense or overly puffed results.

<p>Many UK cooks prefer weighing ingredients rather than using cup measurements for better consistency. This is especially true for leavening agents like baking powder where small variations can have big effects. When converting 1.75 cups of baking powder to oz UK measurements, you'll want to use proper kitchen scales for the most accurate results.</p>

<h3>How to measure 1.75 cups of baking powder correctly</h3>

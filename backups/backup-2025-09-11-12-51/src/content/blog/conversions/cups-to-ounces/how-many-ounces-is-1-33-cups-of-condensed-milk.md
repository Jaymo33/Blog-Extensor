faqQ1: "Can I use evaporated milk instead of condensed milk in air fryer recipes?"
faqA1: "No, evaporated milk and condensed milk aren’t interchangeable. Condensed milk is sweetened and thicker, while evaporated milk is unsweetened. Substituting one for the other will drastically alter the taste and texture of your air fryer dish."
faqQ2: "How do I store leftover condensed milk after measuring 1.33 cups?"
faqA2: "Transfer any unused condensed milk to an airtight container and refrigerate for up to 2 weeks. For longer storage, freeze it in measured portions (like 10.64 ounces) for future air fryer recipes. Thaw in the fridge before using."
faqQ3: "Why does my air fryer recipe with condensed milk turn out too sticky?"
faqA3: "Over-measuring condensed milk can cause stickiness. Ensure you’ve accurately converted 1.33 cups to 10.64 ounces. Also, avoid overcrowding the air fryer basket, as poor airflow can lead to uneven caramelisation and excess moisture."
faqQ4: "Can I make my own condensed milk for air fryer recipes?"
faqA4: "Yes! Simmer 2 cups of milk with 1 cup of sugar until reduced by half (about 1.33 cups). This homemade version works well in air fryer recipes, though store-bought condensed milk has a thicker consistency."

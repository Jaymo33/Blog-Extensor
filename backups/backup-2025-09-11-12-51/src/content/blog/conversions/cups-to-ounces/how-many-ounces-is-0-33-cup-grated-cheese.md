faqQ1: "Can I use shredded cheese instead of grated cheese for this measurement?"
faqA1: "Yes, shredded cheese can be used, but the weight may vary slightly due to differences in density. For 0.33 cup, shredded cheese typically weighs around 1.2 to 1.4 ounces, so it’s close enough for most recipes. If precision is key, weigh it for the best results."
faqQ2: "How do I convert 0.33 cup of grated cheese to grams?"
faqA2: "0.33 cup of grated cheese (1.3 ounces) is roughly 37 grams. This conversion is useful if your recipe uses metric measurements. A kitchen scale will give you the most accurate result, especially for baking or precise air fryer dishes."
faqQ3: "Does the type of cheese affect the weight per cup?"
faqA3: "Absolutely! Hard cheeses like parmesan weigh more per cup than softer cheeses like mozzarella. For 0.33 cup, parmesan might be closer to 1.5 ounces, while mozzarella could be around 1.1 ounces. Always check your recipe for specific cheese types."

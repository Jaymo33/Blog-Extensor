faqQ1: "Can I use a kitchen scale to measure 0.25 cup of sunflower oil?"
faqA1: "Yes, a kitchen scale is the most accurate way. Set it to ounces, and measure out 2 oz, which equals 0.25 cup of sunflower oil. This method eliminates guesswork and ensures consistency in your air fryer recipes."
faqQ2: "Is 0.25 cup of sunflower oil the same in UK and US measurements?"

faqQ4: "Can I substitute other oils for sunflower oil in air frying?"
faqA4: "Yes, but choose oils with high smoke points, like avocado or peanut oil. Use the same 0.25 cup (2 oz) measurement. Avoid butter or olive oil for high-heat cooking, as they can burn easily."

<p>0.25 cup of sunflower oil equals approximately 2 ounces (or 59 ml). This measurement is essential for air fryer recipes, where precise oil quantities ensure crispy, evenly cooked results without excess grease. Whether you’re making roasted veggies or crispy chicken, knowing this conversion helps you nail the recipe every time.</p>

<h2>Why accurate oil measurements matter in air frying</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of oil in your air fryer is crucial for achieving the perfect texture. Too little oil can leave food dry, while too much can make it greasy. Sunflower oil, with its high smoke point, is a popular choice for air frying. A 0.25 cup (2 oz) portion is often ideal for coating ingredients lightly without overpowering them.</p>

<h2>How to measure 0.25 cup of sunflower oil</h2>  
<p>Measuring 0.25 cup of sunflower oil is simple with the right tools. Use a liquid measuring cup with clear markings, or a kitchen scale for weight (2 oz). If you don’t have a scale, remember that 1 tablespoon equals 0.5 oz, so 0.25 cup (4 tablespoons) is 2 oz.</p>  
<p>For UK cooks, note that metric measurements may differ slightly. A 0.25 cup of sunflower oil is roughly 59 ml, but weighing it in ounces ensures consistency.

<h3>Sunflower oil vs. other oils in air frying</h3>

<h2>Common recipes using 0.25 cup of sunflower oil</h2>  
<p>Many air fryer recipes call for 0.25 cup of sunflower oil. For example, crispy chicken wings often need this amount for a light coating. Similarly, roasted vegetables like potatoes or mushrooms benefit from 2 oz of oil for even browning.</p>

faqQ1: "Can I use harissa paste straight from the jar in my air fryer?"
faqA1: "Yes, you can use harissa paste directly, but thinning it with a bit of oil or water helps it coat ingredients evenly. For 1.5 cups (12 oz), mix in 1-2 tablespoons of liquid for a smoother consistency. This works well for marinades or glazes on air-fried proteins."
faqQ2: "How long does harissa paste last once opened?"
faqA2: "Opened harissa paste lasts 3-6 months refrigerated, depending on the brand. Store it in an airtight container to preserve freshness. If your recipe calls for 1.5 cups (12 oz) but you won’t use it all, freeze portions in ice cube trays for future air fryer meals."
faqQ3: "Is harissa paste gluten-free and vegan?"
faqA3: "Most harissa pastes are naturally gluten-free and vegan, but always check labels for additives. When converting 1.5 cups to ounces (12 oz), you’re safe to use it in plant-based air fryer dishes like roasted chickpeas or tofu."
faqQ4: "Can I substitute harissa powder for paste in air fryer recipes?"
faqA4: "Yes, but adjust quantities: 1 tablespoon of harissa powder replaces 2 tablespoons (1 oz) of paste. For 1.5 cups (12 oz) of paste, you’d need about 24 tablespoons of powder mixed with oil or water. Start with less and adjust for heat preference."

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on even heat distribution, so using the right amount of ingredients is crucial. Too much harissa paste can overpower a dish, while too little might leave it bland. Converting 1.5 cups of harissa paste to ounces (12 oz) ensures your recipes turn out perfectly every time. This is especially important for dishes like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>spicy air fryer chicken</a>, where harissa adds depth and heat.</p>  

<p>Harissa paste is dense, so volume-to-weight conversions differ from liquids like water. A standard UK cup holds 8 fluid ounces, but harissa’s thicker consistency means 1.5 cups weigh slightly more. For precise results, use a kitchen scale—especially when adapting recipes from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>our collection</a>.</p>

<p>If you don’t have a scale, spoon harissa paste into a measuring cup and level it off. Avoid packing it down, as this can skew the measurement. For 1.5 cups, you’ll need about 24 tablespoons (2 tbsp per ounce). This method works well for recipes like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>roasted vegetables</a>, where harissa adds a smoky kick.</p>

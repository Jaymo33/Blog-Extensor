faqQ1: "Can I use stock instead of broth when measuring 0.75 cup?"
faqA1: "Yes, you can substitute vegetable stock for broth in equal quantities. Both 0.75 cup of vegetable broth and 0.75 cup of stock will measure approximately 6 fl oz. The main difference lies in flavour intensity, with stock typically being richer."
faqQ2: "How does 0.75 cup of vegetable broth affect air fryer cooking times?"
faqA2: "When using 0.75 cup (6 fl oz) of vegetable broth in air fryer recipes, it may slightly increase cooking time due to added moisture. For best results, reduce temperature by 5-10°C and extend cooking by 2-3 minutes if the recipe includes this amount of liquid."

faqA3: "No, US and UK cups differ slightly. While 0.75 UK cup equals 6 fl oz, 0.75 US cup is about 6.08 fl oz. For air fryer recipes, this small difference won't significantly impact results, but it's good to know for precision baking."
faqQ4: "What if I only have a 1-cup measure for 0.75 cup of vegetable broth?"

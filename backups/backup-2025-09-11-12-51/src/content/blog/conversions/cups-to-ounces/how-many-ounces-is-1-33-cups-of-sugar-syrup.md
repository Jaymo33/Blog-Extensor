faqQ1: "Is 1.33 cups of sugar syrup the same as 1.33 cups of water in ounces?"
faqA1: "No, sugar syrup is denser than water due to its sugar content. While 1.33 cups of water weighs about 11.2 ounces, 1.33 cups of sugar syrup is approximately 10.64 ounces. Always check specific ingredient densities for accurate conversions."
faqQ2: "Can I use a UK measuring cup for 1.33 cups of sugar syrup?"
faqA2: "Yes, but note that UK cups are slightly larger (284 ml) than US cups (240 ml). For precise results, stick to one measurement system. In UK cups, 1.33 cups of sugar syrup still converts to roughly 10.64 ounces."
faqQ3: "How do I adjust cooking time for syrupy air fryer recipes?"
faqA3: "Sugar syrup caramelises quickly in air fryers. Reduce cooking time by 1–2 minutes and check frequently. Use lower temperatures (160–180°C) to prevent burning. For glazes, apply syrup in the last few minutes of cooking."
faqQ4: "What’s the best way to clean sugar syrup spills in an air fryer?"
faqA4: "Act fast—wipe spills with a warm, damp cloth while the air fryer is cool. For stubborn residue, use a mild cleaner like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>our recommended solution</a>. Avoid abrasive scrubbers to protect non-stick coatings."

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>

<p>Many air fryer recipes, like glazed chicken or caramelised desserts, call for sugar syrup. Measuring by weight (ounces) is often more reliable than volume (cups) due to syrup’s viscosity. A kitchen scale eliminates guesswork, especially when scaling recipes up or down.

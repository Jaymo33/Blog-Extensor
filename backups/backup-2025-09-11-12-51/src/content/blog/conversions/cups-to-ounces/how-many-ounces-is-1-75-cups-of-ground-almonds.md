<p>1.75 cups of ground almonds equals approximately 7.4 ounces (or 210 grams). This conversion is essential for precise baking, especially when using an air fryer where measurements matter for perfect results. Whether you're making almond flour cakes or gluten-free treats, knowing the exact weight ensures consistency.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter</h2>  
<p>Baking is a science, and even small discrepancies in measurements can affect the outcome. Ground almonds, often used in gluten-free recipes, need precise weighing for the best texture. If you're using an air fryer, uneven measurements can lead to undercooked or overly dense results.

<p>Converting cups to ounces is particularly important in the UK, where metric measurements are standard. Many British recipes list ingredients by weight rather than volume, so knowing that 1.75 cups of ground almonds is roughly 7.4 ounces saves time and hassle. This is especially useful for air fryer recipes, where precision ensures even cooking.</p>  

<h3>How to measure ground almonds correctly</h3>  
<p>To get the most accurate conversion, always spoon ground almonds into the measuring cup and level it off with a knife. Packing them down can lead to an incorrect weight. If you're using an air fryer for baking, consider investing in a digital kitchen scale for foolproof measurements.

<p>If you're making almond flour brownies or macarons in your air fryer, the 1.75 cups to ounces conversion ensures the right consistency. Too much or too little can alter the texture, so accuracy is key. Ground almonds also add moisture, which is perfect for air fryer baking where dryness can be an issue.</p>  

<h3>Tips for storing ground almonds</h3>  
<p>Ground almonds have a high oil content, so store them in an airtight container in a cool, dark place to prevent rancidity. If you buy in bulk, consider freezing portions to maintain freshness. This is especially useful if you frequently use them in air fryer recipes, as fresh almonds yield the best results.</p>

faqQ1: "Can I use crunchy peanut butter instead of smooth for air fryer recipes?"
faqA1: "Yes, crunchy peanut butter works just as well as smooth in most air fryer recipes. The texture will be slightly different, but the flavour remains the same. Just ensure you measure 0.75 cup (6 ounces) accurately for consistent results."
faqQ2: "How do I convert 0.75 cup of peanut butter to grams?"
faqA2: "0.75 cup of peanut butter is roughly 170 grams. If you prefer using metric measurements, a kitchen scale is the easiest way to get precise amounts. This conversion is handy for international recipes or if your scale doesn’t measure ounces."
faqQ3: "Why does my peanut butter measurement seem off when using a liquid measuring cup?"
faqA3: "Liquid measuring cups aren’t ideal for thick ingredients like peanut butter. They can leave air gaps, leading to inaccurate measurements. Always use dry measuring cups or a scale for sticky substances to ensure you get exactly 0.75 cup (6 ounces)."
faqQ4: "Can I substitute almond butter for peanut butter in air fryer recipes?"
faqA4: "Absolutely! Almond butter can replace peanut butter in a 1:1 ratio, so 0.75 cup (6 ounces) of almond butter will work fine. The flavour will be slightly different, but the texture and cooking process remain similar. Adjust seasonings if needed."

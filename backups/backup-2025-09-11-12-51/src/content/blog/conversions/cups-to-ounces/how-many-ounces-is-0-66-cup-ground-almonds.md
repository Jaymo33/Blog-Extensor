faqQ1: "Can I use whole almonds instead of ground almonds for this measurement?"
faqA1: "No, whole almonds won’t provide the same volume or weight as ground almonds. If you grind whole almonds yourself, measure them after grinding to ensure accuracy. The texture and density differ, which can affect your recipe’s outcome."
faqQ2: "Why does 0.66 cup of ground almonds weigh 2.64 ounces?"
faqA2: "This conversion is based on the standard weight of ground almonds, where 1 cup equals approximately 4 ounces. Since 0.66 cup is two-thirds of a cup, the weight is two-thirds of 4 ounces, resulting in 2.64 ounces. Always use a scale for precision."
faqQ3: "How do I measure 0.66 cup without a measuring cup?"
faqA3: "If you don’t have a 2/3 cup measure, use a 1/3 cup measure twice. Alternatively, weigh 2.64 ounces on a digital kitchen scale for the most accurate result. This method is especially useful for air fryer recipes requiring exact measurements."
faqQ4: "Are ground almonds the same as almond flour?"
faqA4: "Ground almonds and almond flour are similar but not identical. Almond flour is typically finer and blanched, while ground almonds include the skins and have a coarser texture. For most air fryer recipes, they can be used interchangeably, but check your recipe for specifics."

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>
<p>Air fryers rely on even cooking, and incorrect measurements can lead to uneven results. Ground almonds, often used for coatings or flour substitutes, need precise weights for the best texture. Too much can make dishes dry, while too little might not provide enough crunch. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> simplifies these calculations, so you never have to second-guess.</p>
<p>Recipes like almond-crusted fish or keto-friendly desserts often call for ground almonds in specific amounts. Converting 0.66 cup to ounces (2.64 oz) ensures you’re following the recipe correctly. This is especially helpful for UK cooks, where metric and imperial measurements can sometimes cause confusion.</p>

<h2>How to Measure 0.66 Cup of Ground Almonds</h2>
<p>Measuring 0.66 cup of ground almonds can be tricky if you don’t have a 2/3 cup measure. The easiest way is to use a digital scale for accuracy. Scoop the almonds lightly into a measuring cup without packing them down, then level off the top. For reference, 1 cup of ground almonds weighs about 4 ounces, so 0.66 cup is roughly two-thirds of that.</p>
<p>If you’re working with a recipe from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>our collection</a>, you’ll often find both volume and weight measurements.

faqQ1: "Does the brand of tomato ketchup affect the ounce measurement?"
faqA1: "Most major brands of tomato ketchup have similar densities, so 1.5 cups will generally equal about 12 ounces regardless of brand. However, some premium or homemade ketchups with thicker consistency might weigh slightly more. For absolute precision in air fryer recipes, weighing your ketchup is recommended."
faqQ2: "Can I use this conversion for other sauces like BBQ or brown sauce?"
faqA2: "No, this conversion specifically applies to standard tomato ketchup. BBQ sauce, brown sauce and other condiments have different densities and ingredients, so their cup-to-ounce conversions will vary. Always check specific conversion charts for other sauces when preparing air fryer recipes."
faqQ3: "How should I store leftover ketchup after measuring?"
faqA3: "After measuring out 1.5 cups (12 ounces) of tomato ketchup, store any leftovers in the original bottle or an airtight container in the fridge. Proper storage maintains freshness for future air fryer recipes. Avoid contaminating the remaining ketchup by using clean utensils when scooping."
faqQ4: "Is there a difference between UK and US ounces for ketchup measurements?"
faqA4: "Yes, there's a slight difference. UK fluid ounces are about 4% larger than US fluid ounces. For 1.5 cups of tomato ketchup, this means approximately 12 UK fluid ounces equals about 11.5 US fluid ounces. Most home cooks won't notice this small difference in air fryer recipes."

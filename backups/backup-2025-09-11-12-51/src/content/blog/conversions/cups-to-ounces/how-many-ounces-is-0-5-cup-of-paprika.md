faqQ1: "Can I use smoked paprika instead of regular paprika for the same weight?"
faqA1: "Yes, you can substitute smoked paprika for regular paprika at the same weight (0.5 cup = 2.5 oz), but adjust quantities slightly as smoked paprika has a stronger, woodier flavour. Start with ¾ of the amount and taste as you go, especially in air fryer recipes where flavours concentrate."
faqQ2: "Why does my 0.5 cup of paprika weigh differently than another brand?"
faqA2: "Paprika’s weight can vary based on grind size and moisture content. Finely ground paprika packs more densely, so 0.5 cup may weigh slightly more than coarsely ground varieties. Always check your recipe’s specific requirements or use a scale for precision."
faqQ3: "How long will 0.5 cup (2.5 oz) of paprika last in recipes?"
faqA3: "A 0.5-cup portion of paprika (2.5 oz) can season roughly 4–5 large air fryer meals, depending on the recipe. For example, a paprika-heavy dish like roasted potatoes might use 1–2 tablespoons (0.3–0.6 oz) per batch. Store leftovers properly to maintain freshness."
faqQ4: "Is there a difference between UK and US ounces for measuring paprika?"
faqA4: "No, the ounce measurement for dry ingredients like paprika is the same in the UK and US. 0.5 cup of paprika equals 2.5 oz in both systems. However, always double-check if your recipe uses metric grams, as conversions may differ slightly."

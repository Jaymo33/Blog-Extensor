faqQ3: "Does apple cider vinegar affect the non-stick coating of my air fryer basket?"
faqA3: "Apple cider vinegar is generally safe for air fryer baskets, but its acidity means you should clean the basket promptly after use. Avoid letting vinegar-based sauces or marinades sit for long periods. Check our cleaning guide for tips on maintaining your appliance."
faqQ4: "What’s the best way to measure 1.33 cups of apple cider vinegar without a measuring cup?"

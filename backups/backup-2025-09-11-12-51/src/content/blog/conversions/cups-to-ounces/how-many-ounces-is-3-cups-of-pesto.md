faqQ1: "Is 3 cups of pesto the same as 24 ounces in the UK?"
faqA1: "Yes, 3 cups of pesto equals approximately 24 ounces in the UK. While UK fluid ounces can differ slightly for liquids, pesto’s density makes the conversion consistent. Always weigh for precision in air fryer recipes."
faqQ2: "Can I use a measuring cup instead of a scale for pesto?"
faqA2: "You can, but a kitchen scale is more accurate. If using a cup, spoon pesto in lightly without packing it down. For sticky pesto, grease the cup with oil first to ensure easy release and correct volume."
faqQ3: "How many air fryer meals can I make with 3 cups of pesto?"
faqA3: "Twenty-four ounces of pesto (3 cups) can cover 4–6 air fryer meals, like pesto chicken, roasted veggies, or garlic bread. Divide it into portions for balanced flavours and easy weeknight cooking."
faqQ4: "Does store-bought pesto weigh the same as homemade?"
faqA4: "Store-bought pesto is usually denser, so 3 cups might weigh slightly more. Check the label for exact ounces, or weigh it once to confirm. Homemade pesto’s weight varies with ingredient ratios like oil and nuts."

<p>3 cups of pesto equals approximately 24 ounces. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements can make or break your dish. Whether you're making pesto chicken or a veggie bake, knowing the weight ensures consistency.

<h2>Why Convert Cups to Ounces for Pesto?</h2>  
<p>Converting 3 cups of pesto to ounces (24 oz) ensures you use the right amount for air fryer recipes. Cups measure volume, while ounces measure weight, and pesto’s density can vary. This precision prevents over-seasoning or underwhelming flavours. For example, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>pesto pasta air fryer recipe</a> relies on this conversion for perfect results. Always measure pesto by weight when accuracy is key.</p>

Remember, UK ounces (fluid ounces) may differ slightly, but for pesto, the difference is negligible.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure Pesto Accurately</h3>  
<p>Use a kitchen scale for the most precise 3 cups pesto to ounces conversion. Scoop pesto into a measuring cup, then weigh it to confirm 24 ounces. If you don’t have a scale, spoon pesto lightly without packing it down. For sticky pesto, grease the measuring cup with oil first.

<h2>Common Uses for 3 Cups of Pesto in Air Fryers</h2>

<h3>Adjusting Recipes for UK Measurements</h3>

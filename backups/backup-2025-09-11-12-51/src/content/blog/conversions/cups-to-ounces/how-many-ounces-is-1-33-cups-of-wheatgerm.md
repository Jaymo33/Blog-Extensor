faqQ1: "Can I use a regular measuring cup for 1.33 cups of wheatgerm?"
faqA1: "Yes, you can use a regular measuring cup, but for the most accurate results, a kitchen scale is recommended. Lightly scoop the wheatgerm into the cup and level it off to avoid packing too tightly. This method ensures you get close to the 5.3-ounce mark for 1.33 cups."
faqQ2: "Why does wheatgerm weight vary slightly in different recipes?"
faqA2: "Wheatgerm’s weight can vary due to factors like how finely it’s ground or how tightly it’s packed. This is why weighing it (5.3 ounces for 1.33 cups) is more reliable than volume measurements. Air fryer recipes often need precision, so a scale helps avoid inconsistencies."
faqQ3: "Is 1.33 cups of wheatgerm the same in UK and US measurements?"
faqA3: "Yes, 1.33 cups of wheatgerm is roughly 5.3 ounces in both UK and US measurements. However, always double-check if a recipe specifies a particular type of cup (metric or imperial) to ensure accuracy, especially for air fryer baking."
faqQ4: "Can I substitute wheatgerm with another ingredient in air fryer recipes?"
faqA4: "You can substitute wheatgerm with oat bran or ground flaxseed, but the texture and flavor may differ. Adjust measurements by weight (5.3 ounces for 1.33 cups) rather than volume for best results. Always test substitutions in small batches first."

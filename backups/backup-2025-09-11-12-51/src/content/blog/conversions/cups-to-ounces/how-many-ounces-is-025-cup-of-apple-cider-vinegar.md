faqQ1: "Is 0.25 cup of apple cider vinegar the same as 2 ounces?"
faqA1: "Yes, 0.25 cup of apple cider vinegar equals 2 fluid ounces. This measurement is consistent for most liquids, including vinegar, water, and oils. Always use a liquid measuring cup for accuracy in air fryer recipes."

faqQ4: "How can I substitute apple cider vinegar in air fryer recipes?"
faqA4: "For every 0.25 cup (2 fl oz) of apple cider vinegar, use lemon juice or white vinegar in equal amounts. Adjust sweetness if needed, as apple cider vinegar has a milder flavour. Always taste-test marinades before using."

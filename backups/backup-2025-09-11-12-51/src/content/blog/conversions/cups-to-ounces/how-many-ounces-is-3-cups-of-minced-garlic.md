faqQ1: "Is 3 cups of minced garlic the same as 3 cups of whole garlic cloves?"

faqQ2: "How long does 3 cups (24 oz) of minced garlic last in the fridge?"
faqA2: "Properly stored in an airtight container, 3 cups of minced garlic (24 ounces) will last about 2 weeks in the refrigerator. For longer storage, consider freezing portions in oil or vacuum-sealing. Always check for discolouration or off smells before using stored minced garlic in your air fryer recipes."
faqQ3: "Can I use the 3 cups minced garlic to oz conversion for all garlic types?"
faqA3: "The 3 cups to 24 oz conversion works best for standard minced garlic. If using elephant garlic or young green garlic, the weight may vary slightly due to different moisture content. For precise measurements, especially in baking, it's always best to weigh your ingredients rather than relying solely on cup measurements."
faqQ4: "What's the best way to mince garlic for accurate cup measurements?"
faqA4: "For the most accurate 3 cups minced garlic to ounces conversion, use a sharp knife or garlic press to create evenly sized pieces. Avoid using a food processor if possible, as it can create uneven chunks and release more liquid, affecting both volume and weight measurements. Let the minced garlic sit for 10 minutes before measuring to allow moisture to distribute evenly."

faqQ1: "Can I use harissa paste straight from the jar for air fryer recipes?"
faqA1: "Yes, harissa paste can be used directly from the jar. For best results, mix 0.375 cup (3 ounces) with oil or yogurt to create a marinade or coating. This helps it adhere to food and distribute evenly in the air fryer."
faqQ2: "How long does harissa paste last once opened?"
faqA2: "Opened harissa paste lasts about 3–4 months in the fridge if stored properly. Always check for mould or off smells before using. For longer storage, freeze portions in ice cube trays, then transfer to bags."
faqQ3: "Can I substitute harissa paste with another spice blend?"
faqA3: "If you don’t have harissa paste, mix chili powder, cumin, garlic, and coriander for a similar flavour. Note that 0.375 cup of this substitute may weigh slightly less than 3 ounces, so adjust accordingly."
faqQ4: "Is harissa paste gluten-free and vegan?"
faqA4: "Most harissa pastes are gluten-free and vegan, but always check the label. A 0.375 cup (3-ounce) portion works well in plant-based air fryer dishes like spicy roasted chickpeas or tofu."

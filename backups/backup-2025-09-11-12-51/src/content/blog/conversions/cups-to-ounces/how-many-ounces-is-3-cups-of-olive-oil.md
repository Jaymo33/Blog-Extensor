<h2>Why Accurate Olive Oil Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of olive oil in your air fryer recipes ensures even cooking and prevents excess grease. Too little oil can leave food dry, while too much may cause splattering or uneven crisping. For dishes like roasted potatoes or crispy tofu, 3 cups of olive oil (24 oz) is often used for batch cooking or marinating.</p>

<h2>Converting Cups to Ounces for Olive Oil</h2>  
<p>In the UK, 1 cup of olive oil typically equals 8 fluid ounces. Therefore, 3 cups of olive oil to ounces is simply 3 x 8, which gives you 24 oz. This conversion is consistent for most liquid ingredients, making it easy to remember.</p>  
<p>If you're working with a recipe from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>our collection</a>, always double-check whether it uses US or UK measurements. Some international recipes may vary slightly, but 24 oz for 3 cups of olive oil is a reliable standard.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure Olive Oil Without a Cup</h3>  
<p>No measuring cups? No problem. Use a kitchen scale to weigh 24 oz of olive oil directly. Alternatively, 3 cups of olive oil in ounces can be measured using a standard 250ml metric cup (about 8.45 oz per cup), totaling roughly 25.35 oz. For most air fryer recipes, this small difference won’t affect the outcome.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for 3 Cups of Olive Oil in Air Fryers</h2>  
<p>From marinades to frying, 3 cups of olive oil (24 oz) is a versatile quantity. It’s ideal for coating large batches of vegetables, like those in our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable recipes</a>, or for preparing crispy chicken wings. The oil helps achieve that golden, restaurant-quality finish.</p>  
<p>After cooking, don’t forget to clean your air fryer with our recommended <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner</a> to maintain its performance. Excess oil buildup can affect future cooking results, so regular maintenance is key.</p>  

<h3>Storing Leftover Olive Oil</h3>  
<p>If you have leftover olive oil from your 3-cup measurement, store it in an airtight container away from light. Proper storage preserves its flavour and quality for future air fryer recipes. Avoid reusing oil multiple times, as it can break down and affect taste.</p>

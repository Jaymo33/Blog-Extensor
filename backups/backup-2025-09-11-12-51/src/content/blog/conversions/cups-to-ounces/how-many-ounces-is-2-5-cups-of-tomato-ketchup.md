<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on even heat distribution, and incorrect ingredient quantities can lead to uneven cooking.

<p>Tomato ketchup is a staple in many air fryer dishes, from glazes to dipping sauces. Its thickness means volume-to-weight conversions aren’t always straightforward. A standard US cup holds 8 ounces, but ketchup’s density means 2.5 cups equate to 20 ounces. For UK cooks, this conversion remains the same, as fluid ounces and weight ounces align closely in this case.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure Tomato Ketchup for Air Fryer Recipes</h3>  
<p>For the most accurate results, use a kitchen scale to weigh your ketchup. If you don’t have one, spoon the ketchup into a measuring cup without packing it down. Level it off with a knife for precision. This method ensures your 2.5 cups of tomato ketchup truly equals 20 ounces, keeping your air fryer dishes perfectly balanced.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for 2.5 Cups of Tomato Ketchup in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>

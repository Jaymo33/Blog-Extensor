faqQ1: "Does the type of peanut butter affect the weight per cup?"
faqA1: "Yes, natural peanut butter (without stabilisers) may weigh slightly less due to oil separation. Stir it thoroughly before measuring. Commercial brands with added sugars or oils often have a denser consistency, but 8.5 ounces per cup remains a safe benchmark."
faqQ2: "How do I measure peanut butter without a scale?"
faqA2: "Use a dry measuring cup and level it off with a straight edge. For sticky peanut butter, lightly grease the cup first. Alternatively, use displacement: fill a liquid measuring cup with water, add peanut butter until the water rises by 1 cup, then drain the water."
faqQ3: "Can I use grams instead of ounces for peanut butter?"
faqA3: "Absolutely! 1 cup of peanut butter equals 240 grams. Many UK recipes use metric measurements, and a kitchen scale simplifies the process. This is especially useful for air fryer baking, where precision matters."
faqQ4: "Why does my air fryer recipe call for weighed peanut butter?"
faqA4: "Weight measurements (ounces or grams) ensure consistency, as peanut butter’s volume can vary with packing density. Air fryer recipes often rely on exact ratios for even cooking, so weighing eliminates guesswork. Check our conversion chart for quick reference."

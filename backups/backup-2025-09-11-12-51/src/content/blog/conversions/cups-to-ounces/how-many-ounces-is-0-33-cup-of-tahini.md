faqQ1: "Can I use grams instead of ounces for tahini measurements?"
faqA1: "Yes, you can convert 0.33 cup of tahini to grams for more precision. Since 1 ounce equals approximately 28.35 grams, 2.64 ounces of tahini is about 75 grams. Many digital scales allow you to toggle between units, making it easy to measure tahini in either system."
faqQ2: "Why does tahini weight vary slightly between brands?"
faqA2: "Tahini’s density can differ based on how finely the sesame seeds are ground and whether oil separation has occurred. Stirring the tahini well before measuring ensures consistency. For air fryer recipes, always use the same brand if precise measurements are critical."
faqQ3: "How do I store tahini after opening?"
faqA3: "Store tahini in an airtight container in the fridge to prevent oil separation and rancidity. It can last up to 6 months if properly sealed. Stir well before using in air fryer recipes to ensure even consistency."
faqQ4: "Can I substitute peanut butter for tahini in air fryer recipes?"
faqA4: "While peanut butter has a similar texture, its flavour is sweeter and nuttier than tahini’s earthy taste. For dressings or marinades, the swap may work, but for authentic Middle Eastern dishes, stick to tahini. Adjust measurements as peanut butter is often denser."

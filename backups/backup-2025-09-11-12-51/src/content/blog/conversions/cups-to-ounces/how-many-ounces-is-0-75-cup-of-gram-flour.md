faqQ1: "Can I use a kitchen scale instead of measuring cups for gram flour?"
faqA1: "Yes, a kitchen scale is actually more accurate for measuring gram flour. Simply set it to ounces and weigh out 3.17 oz for 0.75 cup. This method eliminates packing inconsistencies and ensures precision in your air fryer recipes."
faqQ2: "Does the type of gram flour affect the weight per cup?"
faqA2: "Slight variations can occur based on how finely the gram flour is milled or if it’s packed tightly. For best results, fluff the flour before measuring 0.75 cup (3.17 oz) or use a scale. Coarser blends may weigh slightly less per cup."
faqQ3: "How do I convert 0.75 cup of gram flour to grams?"
faqA3: "0.75 cup of gram flour is roughly 90 grams. This conversion is useful if your recipe uses metric measurements. Always double-check with a scale if precision is critical, especially in baking."
faqQ4: "Can I substitute gram flour with all-purpose flour in air fryer recipes?"
faqA4: "While possible, the results will differ. Gram flour adds a nutty flavour and crispiness that all-purpose flour lacks. If substituting, start with 0.75 cup (3.17 oz) but expect texture variations. For gluten-free options, stick with gram flour."

faqQ1: "Can I use ground flaxseed instead of whole flaxseed in air fryer recipes?"
faqA1: "Yes, ground flaxseed works well in air fryer recipes, but it absorbs more liquid than whole seeds. Adjust measurements slightly—1.25 cups of ground flaxseed weighs about the same (4.5 oz), but it may affect texture. For binding purposes, like in veggie burgers, ground flaxseed is ideal."
faqQ2: "How do I store flaxseed to keep it fresh for air fryer cooking?"
faqA2: "Store flaxseed in an airtight container in a cool, dark place or the fridge. Whole flaxseed lasts up to a year, while ground flaxseed stays fresh for about 3 months. For best results, grind flaxseed just before using it in recipes."
faqQ3: "Is flaxseed measurement the same in the UK and US?"
faqA3: "Yes, 1.25 cups of flaxseed equals roughly 4.5 ounces in both UK and US measurements. However, always check if a recipe specifies metric or imperial units for precision. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a> covers both systems."
faqQ4: "Can I substitute flaxseed for breadcrumbs in air fryer coatings?"
faqA4: "Absolutely! Flaxseed adds a nutty crunch and extra nutrition to coatings. Use it alone or mixed with breadcrumbs for chicken, fish, or tofu. For crispy results, spritz with oil before air frying. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipes</a> for inspiration."

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Getting the right amount of flaxseed ensures your dishes turn out perfectly every time. Too much or too little can affect texture, taste, and even cooking time in your air fryer.

faqQ1: "Does the type of bean affect the weight when converting 3 cups to ounces?"
faqA1: "While most canned beans weigh roughly the same (about 8 ounces per cup), there can be slight variations. Smaller beans like black beans might pack slightly more into a cup compared to larger varieties like butter beans. Always check your specific can's label if precision is crucial for your air fryer recipe."
faqQ2: "Should I measure canned beans with or without the liquid?"
faqA2: "Always drain and rinse canned beans before measuring. The liquid adds extra weight and can throw off your measurements. For accurate results when converting 3 cups of canned beans to ounces (24 oz), use well-drained beans levelled in a measuring cup."
faqQ3: "How many cans do I need for 3 cups (24 ounces) of canned beans?"
faqA3: "Typically, one large 400g can (about 14 oz drained) plus half another can will give you approximately 3 cups (24 oz). Alternatively, two standard 15-ounce cans, when drained, usually yield close to 3 cups of beans for your air fryer recipes."
faqQ4: "Can I use dried beans instead of canned for air fryer recipes?"
faqA4: "Yes, but you'll need to adjust quantities. About 1 cup of dried beans yields roughly 3 cups cooked (equivalent to one 15-ounce can). So for 3 cups canned (24 oz), you'd need about 1 cup dried beans, soaked and cooked first before air frying."

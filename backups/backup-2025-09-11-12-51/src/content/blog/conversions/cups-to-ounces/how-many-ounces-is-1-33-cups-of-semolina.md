faqQ1: "Can I use grams instead of ounces for semolina in air fryer recipes?"
faqA1: "Absolutely! 1.33 cups of semolina is roughly 302 grams. Many UK recipes use grams for precision, and a kitchen scale makes conversions effortless. Whether you prefer ounces or grams, consistency is key for air fryer success."
faqQ2: "Does semolina weight change if it’s packed vs. loose?"
faqA2: "Yes, packed semolina can weigh more due to compaction. Always spoon it lightly into the measuring cup and level it off for accuracy. For 1.33 cups (10.64 ounces), avoid tapping the cup to prevent excess semolina from settling."
faqQ3: "What’s the best way to store semolina for air fryer recipes?"
faqA3: "Keep semolina in an airtight container in a cool, dry place. This prevents moisture absorption, which can alter its weight and texture. Proper storage ensures your 1.33 cups measure correctly every time."
faqQ4: "Can I substitute semolina with regular flour in air fryer recipes?"
faqA4: "While possible, semolina’s coarse texture gives a crispier finish. If substituting, use 10.64 ounces of all-purpose flour, but expect a lighter coating. For best results, stick to semolina in recipes designed for it."

<p>1.33 cups of semolina equals approximately 10.64 ounces. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precision ensures perfect texture and consistency. Whether you’re making crispy semolina-coated chicken or a fluffy semolina cake in your air fryer, knowing the exact weight saves time and avoids mishaps.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on even heat distribution, and incorrect measurements can lead to uneven cooking or overly dense results. Semolina, a coarse flour, behaves differently than regular flour, so weighing it ensures your recipes turn out as intended. For example, if you’re making semolina-crusted fish or <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer falafel</a>, 10.64 ounces of semolina will give you the right crunch without excess coating.</p>  

<p>Many UK cooks prefer weighing ingredients for consistency, especially when adapting recipes from cups to ounces. A kitchen scale is a handy tool, but if you don’t have one, our conversion helps bridge the gap. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for other common ingredient swaps.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure Semolina Without a Scale</h3>  
<p>If you don’t own a scale, use the spoon-and-level method for dry ingredients. Gently spoon semolina into a measuring cup until it’s slightly heaped, then level it off with a knife. This avoids compacting the semolina, which could throw off your measurement. For 1.33 cups, you’ll need just over one full cup plus a third—easy to eyeball with practice.</p>  

<h2>Common Air Fryer Recipes Using Semolina</h2>  
<p>Semolina adds a delightful crunch to air-fried dishes. Try it in <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>air fryer chicken tenders</a> or as a coating for crispy vegetables. Since 1.33 cups (10.64 ounces) is a moderate amount, it’s ideal for family-sized portions. Pair it with spices or herbs for extra flavour, and always preheat your air fryer for the best results.</p>  

<p>For desserts, semolina works wonders in air-fried cakes or puddings. Its granular texture absorbs moisture evenly, preventing sogginess. If you’re experimenting, start with our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a> for tried-and-tested ideas. Cleaning your air fryer afterward? A quick wipe with <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner</a> keeps it in top shape.</p>  

<h3>Adjusting Recipes for Different Air Fryer Models</h3>  
<p>Not all air fryers cook the same way, so slight adjustments might be needed. If your model runs hot, reduce cooking time by a minute or two when using 10.64 ounces of semolina. Conversely, compact air fryers may require shaking the basket midway for even browning. Always check doneness with a skewer or thermometer.</p>

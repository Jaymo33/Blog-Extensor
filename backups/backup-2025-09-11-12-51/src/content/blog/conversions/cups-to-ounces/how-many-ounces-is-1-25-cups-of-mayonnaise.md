faqQ1: "Can I use light mayonnaise instead of regular for 1.25 cups?"
faqA1: "Yes, you can use light mayonnaise as a substitute for regular mayonnaise in the same quantity (1.25 cups or 10 ounces). However, light mayo has a higher water content, which might slightly affect the texture of your dish. For air fryer recipes, this could mean a less crispy finish, so adjust cooking times if needed."
faqQ2: "How do I measure 1.25 cups of mayonnaise without a measuring cup?"
faqA2: "If you don’t have a measuring cup, you can use a kitchen scale to weigh out 10 ounces of mayonnaise. Alternatively, a standard UK tablespoon holds 0.5 ounces, so 20 tablespoons would equal 1.25 cups. Just be sure to level off each tablespoon for accuracy."
faqQ3: "Does 1.25 cups of mayonnaise weigh the same as other ingredients?"
faqA3: "No, 1.25 cups of mayonnaise (10 ounces) will weigh differently than other ingredients like flour or sugar due to density. Mayonnaise is heavier, so always measure by weight for precision, especially in air fryer recipes where consistency is key."
faqQ4: "Can I freeze mayonnaise if I have leftovers from 1.25 cups?"
faqA4: "Freezing mayonnaise isn’t recommended, as it can separate and become grainy when thawed. Instead, store leftovers in an airtight container in the fridge and use within two months. For more storage tips, check out <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>."

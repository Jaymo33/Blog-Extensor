Let’s dive deeper into how to measure Thai curry paste accurately for your air fryer dishes.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of Thai curry paste can make or break your dish. Too little, and the flavours fall flat; too much, and it overpowers other ingredients. Air fryers cook quickly, so balanced measurements are crucial. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> simplifies these calculations for you. Stick to 10.64 ounces for 1.33 cups of Thai curry paste, and you’ll nail the recipe every time.</p>  

<p>Thai curry paste is dense, so volume-to-weight conversions differ from liquids. A standard UK cup holds 8 fluid ounces, but curry paste weighs more due to its thick consistency.

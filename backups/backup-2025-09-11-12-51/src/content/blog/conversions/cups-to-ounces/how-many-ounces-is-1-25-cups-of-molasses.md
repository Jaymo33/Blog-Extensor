faqQ1: "Can I use black treacle instead of molasses in air fryer recipes?"
faqA1: "Yes, black treacle is a UK substitute for molasses and can be used in a 1:1 ratio. Both have a similar thick consistency and bittersweet flavour, though treacle is slightly lighter. Adjust baking times slightly, as treacle may caramelise faster in the air fryer."
faqQ2: "Why does my air fryer bake turn out too sticky with molasses?"
faqA2: "Stickiness often means too much molasses or insufficient cooking time. Ensure you’ve measured 1.25 cups (10.6 oz) accurately and extend cooking by 2–3 minutes. Lining the basket with parchment paper also helps prevent sticking."
faqQ3: "How do I convert grams to ounces for molasses?"
faqA3: "1.25 cups of molasses (300 grams) equals 10.6 ounces. For smaller amounts, remember that 1 gram ≈ 0.035 ounces. Use a digital scale for precision, especially in air fryer recipes where balance is key."
faqQ4: "Does molasses weight change if it’s chilled or warmed?"
faqA4: "Yes, cold molasses is denser and may measure slightly heavier per cup. For accuracy, let it reach room temperature before measuring 1.25 cups (10.6 oz). Warm molasses pours more easily but doesn’t affect the weight significantly."

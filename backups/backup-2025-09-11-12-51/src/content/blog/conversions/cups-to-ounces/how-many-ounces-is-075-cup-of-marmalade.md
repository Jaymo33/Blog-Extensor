faqQ2: "How do I measure 0.75 cup of marmalade without a measuring cup?"

faqQ3: "Does the type of marmalade affect the weight in ounces?"
faqA3: "Thicker marmalades may weigh slightly more due to density, but 0.75 cup generally equals 6 ounces. For precise results, especially in baking, weighing is best."
faqQ4: "Can I substitute marmalade with another jam in air fryer recipes?"

<h2>Tips for Working with Marmalade in the Air Fryer</h2>  
<p>Marmalade can burn quickly in the air fryer due to its sugar content. To prevent this, apply glazes in thin layers and monitor cooking times closely. If using 0.75 cup (6 ounces) in a recipe, consider reducing the temperature slightly to avoid over-browning. Stirring or flipping food halfway through also helps distribute the glaze evenly.</p>

faqQ1: "Can I use toasted sesame seeds instead of raw in air fryer recipes?"

faqQ2: "How do I store leftover sesame seeds after measuring 3 cups?"
faqA2: "Store in an airtight container in a cool, dark place. Toasted seeds last up to 3 months, while raw seeds keep for 6 months. Freezing extends freshness further."
faqQ3: "Why does 3 cups of sesame seeds weigh 24 ounces?"
faqA3: "Sesame seeds have a density of about 8 ounces per cup. This varies slightly by brand, so weighing ensures accuracy, especially for baking."
faqQ4: "Can I substitute sesame seeds with other seeds in air fryer recipes?"
faqA4: "Pumpkin or sunflower seeds work but alter flavour and texture. Adjust quantities slightly, as weights may differ. Always test for doneness earlier."

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Using the correct amount of sesame seeds can make or break a dish. Too few, and you lose flavour; too many, and the texture becomes overwhelming. Air fryers cook food quickly, so balanced ingredients are key. For example, sesame seeds add crunch to air-fried salmon or tofu. Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/salmon>salmon recipes</a> for inspiration.</p>  

<p>Measuring by weight (ounces) is often more reliable than volume (cups) because seeds can settle or vary in density. A kitchen scale ensures consistency, especially for recipes like sesame-crusted chicken or baked goods. If you’re new to air frying, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a> has plenty of ideas to get started.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure Sesame Seeds Without a Scale</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a scale, use the spoon-and-level method for cups. Gently spoon sesame seeds into a measuring cup and level off the top. Avoid packing them down, as this leads to inaccurate measurements.

<h2>Common Uses for Sesame Seeds in Air Fryer Recipes</h2>  
<p>Sesame seeds add nutty flavour and crunch to air-fried dishes. Try them in coatings for chicken, fish, or tofu, or sprinkle over roasted vegetables. They’re also great in homemade granola or energy bars cooked in the air fryer.

<p>Toasting sesame seeds in the air fryer enhances their flavour. Spread them in a single layer and cook at 160°C for 3–4 minutes, shaking halfway. Store leftovers in an airtight container to maintain freshness. Need more tips? Visit <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> for expert advice.</p>

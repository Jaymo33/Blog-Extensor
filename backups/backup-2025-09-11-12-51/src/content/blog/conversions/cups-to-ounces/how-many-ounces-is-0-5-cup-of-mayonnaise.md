faqQ1: "Can I use light mayonnaise instead of regular for the same measurement?"
faqA1: "Yes, you can use light mayonnaise as a substitute for regular mayonnaise in the same measurement. Light mayonnaise has a similar consistency, so 0.5 cup will still equal approximately 4 ounces. However, keep in mind that the fat content and flavor might differ slightly, which could affect the final taste and texture of your dish."
faqQ2: "How do I measure 0.5 cup of mayonnaise without a measuring cup?"
faqA2: "If you don’t have a measuring cup, you can use a kitchen scale to weigh out 4 ounces of mayonnaise. Alternatively, you can eyeball it using common household items—0.5 cup is roughly the size of a small avocado or a tennis ball. Just remember that these methods are less precise than using proper measuring tools."
faqQ3: "Does the brand of mayonnaise affect the weight per 0.5 cup?"
faqA3: "Most brands of mayonnaise have a similar density, so 0.5 cup will generally weigh around 4 ounces regardless of the brand. However, some premium or low-fat varieties might have slight variations. For the most accurate results, especially in baking, it’s best to weigh your mayonnaise if possible."
faqQ4: "Can I freeze mayonnaise if I have leftovers after measuring 0.5 cup?"
faqA4: "Freezing mayonnaise isn’t recommended, as it can separate and become grainy when thawed. Instead, store any leftover mayonnaise in the fridge and use it within a few weeks. If you frequently find yourself with leftovers, consider buying smaller jars or using our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe ideas</a> to incorporate mayonnaise into more meals."

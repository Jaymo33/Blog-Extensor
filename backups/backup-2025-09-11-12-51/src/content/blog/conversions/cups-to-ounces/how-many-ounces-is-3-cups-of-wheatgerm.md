faqQ1: "Can I use the same conversion for other types of wheat products?"
faqA1: "No, different wheat products have varying densities. While 3 cups of wheatgerm equals about 12 ounces, whole wheat flour would weigh differently. Always check specific conversions for each ingredient when preparing air fryer recipes to ensure accuracy."
faqQ2: "How does the UK ounce measurement compare to US ounces for wheatgerm?"
faqA2: "For dry ingredients like wheatgerm, UK and US ounces are identical in weight. So whether you're using UK or US measurements, 3 cups of wheatgerm will still equal approximately 12 ounces. This makes converting 3 cups of wheatgerm to oz UK measurements straightforward."
faqQ3: "Why is my measured weight slightly different from the 12 ounce conversion?"
faqA3: "Small variations can occur due to how the wheatgerm is packed or the humidity level. For most air fryer recipes, a slight difference won't affect the outcome significantly. However, for baking recipes where precision matters, it's best to use scales for the most accurate 3 cups wheatgerm to ounces conversion."
faqQ4: "Can I substitute wheatgerm with other ingredients in air fryer recipes?"
faqA4: "While you can substitute wheatgerm with ingredients like ground flaxseed or oat bran, the conversion from 3 cups to ounces will differ. Each substitute has its own density, so you'll need to check specific conversions. For best results in air fryer cooking, stick to the original recipe measurements when possible."

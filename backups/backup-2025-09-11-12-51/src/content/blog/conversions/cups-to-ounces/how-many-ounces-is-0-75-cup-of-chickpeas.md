faqQ1: "Can I use canned chickpeas instead of dried for 0.75 cup measurements?"
faqA1: "Yes, canned chickpeas work fine—just drain and rinse them first. One 400g can yields roughly 1.5 cups (12 ounces), so 0.75 cup is half of that. Adjust seasoning since canned chickpeas are pre-cooked."
faqQ2: "How do I convert 0.75 cup of chickpeas to grams?"
faqA2: "0.75 cup of chickpeas equals about 170 grams. This is handy for recipes using metric measurements. A kitchen scale ensures precision, especially for baking or meal prep."
faqQ3: "Why does my air fryer chickpea recipe turn out uneven?"
faqA3: "Overcrowding the basket or uneven seasoning can cause this. Stick to 0.75 cup (6 ounces) per batch, and shake the basket halfway through cooking for even crispiness."
faqQ4: "Are chickpeas in ounces the same for UK and US measurements?"
faqA4: "Yes, 0.75 cup of chickpeas is 6 ounces in both systems. However, cup sizes can vary slightly—using weight (ounces or grams) eliminates this confusion for air fryer recipes."

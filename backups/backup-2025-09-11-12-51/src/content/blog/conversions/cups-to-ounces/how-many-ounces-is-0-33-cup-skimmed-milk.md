<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on even cooking, and incorrect measurements can throw off textures and flavours.

<p>Many air fryer enthusiasts overlook the importance of converting cups to ounces. However, weight-based measurements eliminate guesswork, especially with liquids like skimmed milk. If you’re baking, this precision ensures your cakes rise evenly and your custards set perfectly. Always use a kitchen scale for the best results.</p>  

<h3>How to measure 0.33 cup of skimmed milk without a scale</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a scale, use a liquid measuring cup marked in ounces. Fill it to the 2.64-ounce line for accuracy. Alternatively, 0.33 cup is roughly one-third of a standard cup, but weighing is more reliable.

<h3>Converting other milk types to ounces</h3>  
<p>Whole milk and skimmed milk have similar densities, so 0.33 cup of whole milk also weighs around 2.64 ounces. However, condensed or evaporated milk will differ due to their thicker consistency. Always check specific conversions for these variants.</p>  

<h2>Tips for storing skimmed milk for air fryer recipes</h2>

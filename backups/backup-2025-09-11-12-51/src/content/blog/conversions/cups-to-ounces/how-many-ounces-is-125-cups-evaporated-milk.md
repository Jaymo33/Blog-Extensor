faqQ1: "Can I use regular milk instead of evaporated milk in air fryer recipes?"
faqA1: "Yes, but you’ll need to adjust the quantity. Regular milk is thinner, so use 1.5 cups of whole milk to replace 1.25 cups (10 oz) of evaporated milk. For best results, reduce other liquids in the recipe slightly."
faqQ2: "How do I store leftover evaporated milk after measuring 1.25 cups?"
faqA2: "Transfer leftovers to an airtight container and refrigerate for up to 5 days. Alternatively, freeze it in ice cube trays for portioned use later. Always label with the date to track freshness."
faqQ3: "Why does evaporated milk weigh more than fluid ounces suggest?"
faqA3: "Evaporated milk is denser due to reduced water content. While 1.25 cups equals 10 fluid ounces, its weight can be closer to 11 oz. For baking, fluid ounces are typically used unless specified otherwise."
faqQ4: "Can I make my own evaporated milk for air fryer recipes?"
faqA4: "Absolutely! Simmer 2.5 cups of regular milk until it reduces to 1.25 cups (10 oz). Stir frequently to prevent scorching. Homemade evaporated milk works well in most air fryer dishes."

<p>1.25 cups of evaporated milk equals 10 fluid ounces (or approximately 10 oz by weight for most brands). This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes, where precise measurements can make or break your dish. Whether you’re making a creamy sauce, a dessert, or a savoury bake, knowing this conversion ensures consistency.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>

Evaporated milk, being thicker than regular milk, requires careful measurement. Too much can make dishes overly rich, while too little might leave them dry.

<p>Many UK recipes use metric measurements, but some older or American recipes list evaporated milk in cups. If you’re adapting a recipe for your air fryer, converting 1.25 cups to ounces (10 oz) ensures you stay on track. This is especially handy for desserts like custards or cakes, where precision is key.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure Evaporated Milk Correctly</h3>  
<p>Use a liquid measuring cup for fluid ounces or a kitchen scale for weight. Evaporated milk is denser than regular milk, so 1.25 cups will weigh slightly more than 10 oz if measured by weight. For best results, stick to fluid ounces unless your recipe specifies otherwise. Need recipe ideas?

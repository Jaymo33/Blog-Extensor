faqQ1: "Is 2.5 cups of evaporated milk the same as 2.5 cups of regular milk in ounces?"
faqA1: "No, evaporated milk is more concentrated. While both measure 20 fluid ounces per 2.5 cups, evaporated milk weighs slightly more (about 19.5oz by weight vs 15oz for regular milk) due to its reduced water content. This density difference matters in air fryer baking."
faqQ2: "Can I use a UK measuring jug for 2.5 cups of evaporated milk?"
faqA2: "Yes, but check the markings carefully. 2.5 US cups equal 600ml in a UK jug. Some UK jugs show both metric and imperial measurements – look for the 600ml line rather than trying to convert fluid ounces, as US and UK fluid ounces differ slightly."
faqQ3: "How does evaporated milk affect air fryer cooking times?"
faqA3: "Recipes with evaporated milk may cook slightly faster due to its sugar content caramelising under heat. When substituting 2.5 cups (20oz) evaporated milk for regular milk, reduce temperature by 5°C and check doneness 2-3 minutes early to prevent over-browning."
faqQ4: "What’s the best way to measure sticky evaporated milk?"
faqA4: "Lightly grease your measuring cup with oil first – the thin coating helps the milk slide out cleanly. For 2.5 cups, use a large liquid measuring cup with a pour spout. Alternatively, weigh it: 2.5 cups should be 555g on a kitchen scale."

<p>2.5 cups of evaporated milk equals 20 fluid ounces (or approximately 19.5 ounces by weight in the UK). This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements can make or break your dish. Whether you're making a creamy custard or a rich sauce, knowing how to convert cups to ounces ensures perfect results every time.</p>

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on even heat distribution, and incorrect ingredient quantities can throw off cooking times and textures. Evaporated milk, with its concentrated richness, needs careful measuring to avoid overly dense or runny outcomes. For example, a <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>pumpkin pie air fryer recipe</a> might call for 2.5 cups of evaporated milk – now you know that’s 20 fluid ounces.</p>  
<p>Many UK cooks find cup measurements confusing, especially when recipes originate from the US. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> simplifies this, covering everything from ounces to grams. Remember, fluid ounces measure volume, while weight ounces measure mass – evaporated milk’s density means these values differ slightly.</p>

<h3>How to measure evaporated milk without cups</h3>  
<p>No measuring cups? Use a kitchen scale: 2.5 cups of evaporated milk weighs roughly 19.5 ounces (555g) in the UK. Pour it into a jug marked with millilitres – 600ml equals 2.5 cups. For sticky situations, a tablespoon holds 0.5 fluid ounces, so 40 tablespoons make 2.5 cups.

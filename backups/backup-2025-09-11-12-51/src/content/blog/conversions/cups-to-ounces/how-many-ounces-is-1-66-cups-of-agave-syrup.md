<h2>How to Measure Agave Syrup Accurately</h2>
<p>To measure 1.66 cups of agave syrup, use a liquid measuring cup with clear markings. Coat the cup lightly with oil or cooking spray to help the syrup slide out easily.

This method is ideal for air fryer recipes where consistency matters.</p>

Place your measuring cup on the scale, tare it to zero, then pour the syrup until it reaches 13.28 ounces. This eliminates guesswork and ensures your air fryer dishes turn out perfectly every time. Scales are especially handy for sticky ingredients like agave syrup that can cling to measuring cups.</p>

<h2>Common Uses for Agave Syrup in Air Fryer Recipes</h2>
<p>Agave syrup is a popular sweetener in air fryer recipes, from glazes to desserts.

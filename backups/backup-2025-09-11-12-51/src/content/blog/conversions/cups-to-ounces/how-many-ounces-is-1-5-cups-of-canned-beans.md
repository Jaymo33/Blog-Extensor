faqQ1: "Does the type of canned bean affect the weight per 1.5 cups?"
faqA1: "While most canned beans weigh about 12 ounces per 1.5 cups, there can be slight variations. Smaller beans like black beans might pack more densely than larger varieties like kidney beans. However, the difference is minimal for most cooking purposes, especially in air fryer recipes where precise measurements matter less than in baking."
faqQ2: "How do I measure 1.5 cups of canned beans without a measuring cup?"
faqA2: "If you don't have measuring cups, you can estimate using standard cans. One 15-ounce can of drained beans equals roughly 1.5 cups. Alternatively, use a mug - a standard UK mug holds about 1.5 cups when filled to just below the rim. For air fryer cooking, slight variations won't significantly affect most recipes."
faqQ3: "Can I use dried beans instead of canned for this measurement?"
faqA3: "Dried beans require different measurements as they expand when cooked. Typically, 1/2 cup dried beans yields about 1.5 cups cooked, equivalent to one 15-ounce can. If substituting in air fryer recipes, you'll need to pre-cook the dried beans first. The texture may differ slightly from canned beans in finished dishes."
faqQ4: "Why do some recipes specify ounces while others use cups for canned beans?"
faqA4: "Recipes may use different measurements depending on their origin and focus. Weight measurements (ounces) are more precise, while volume (cups) is quicker for most home cooks. For air fryer recipes, either works fine, but our 1.5 cups to 12 ounces conversion helps bridge both systems. Always check which measurement your specific recipe uses for best results."

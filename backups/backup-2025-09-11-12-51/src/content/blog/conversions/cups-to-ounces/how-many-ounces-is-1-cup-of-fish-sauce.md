faqQ1: "Is 1 cup of fish sauce the same in US and UK measurements?"
faqA1: "Yes, 1 cup of fish sauce is approximately 8.45 ounces in both US and UK measurements. The slight variance in cup sizes between the two systems doesn’t significantly affect liquid ingredients like fish sauce. Always use a liquid measuring cup for accuracy."
faqQ2: "Can I use a kitchen scale to measure fish sauce in ounces?"
faqA2: "Absolutely! A digital kitchen scale is one of the best tools for measuring fish sauce by weight. Simply set your scale to ounces, tare the container, and pour until you reach 8.45 oz for 1 cup. This method reduces mess and improves precision."
faqQ3: "How much fish sauce should I use for an air fryer marinade?"

faqQ4: "Does fish sauce expire, and how should I store it?"
faqA4: "Fish sauce has a long shelf life (up to 3 years unopened, 1 year opened) if stored in a cool, dark place. Refrigeration isn’t necessary but can help maintain flavour. Always check for off smells or discolouration before use."

<h2>Why measuring fish sauce accurately matters</h2>  
<p>Fish sauce is a potent ingredient, and even a small miscalculation can overpower your dish. In air fryer cooking, balance is key—too much fish sauce can make food overly salty, while too little might leave it bland. Recipes like air-fried salmon or crispy tofu often rely on fish sauce for depth of flavour. Measuring by weight (ounces) rather than volume (cups) ensures precision.

<p>Many UK cooks wonder about the difference between US and UK cup measurements. Luckily, for fish sauce, the variance is minimal—roughly 8.45 oz per cup in both systems. If you're scaling up a recipe, this consistency is a relief. Always use a liquid measuring cup for accuracy, as fish sauce’s viscosity can skew dry measurements. Need a cleaner for sticky residue?

<p>0.25 cup of self-raising flour equals approximately 1.06 ounces (30 grams). This conversion is essential for precise baking, especially when using an air fryer where measurements can make or break a recipe. Whether you're whipping up cakes, muffins, or savoury dishes, knowing the exact weight ensures consistent results every time.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Flour Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Baking is a science, and even small deviations in flour quantities can affect texture and rise. Self-raising flour contains baking powder, so incorrect measurements may lead to dense or overly airy results. For air fryer recipes, precision is even more critical due to the appliance's rapid cooking method. A slight imbalance can alter cooking times and outcomes.</p>  
<p>At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we emphasise the importance of accurate conversions. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> helps bakers switch between cups, grams, and ounces effortlessly. Whether you're making fluffy scones or crispy coatings, getting the flour weight right ensures perfection.</p>  

<h2>How to Measure 0.25 Cup of Self-Raising Flour</h2>  
<p>For the most accurate results, use a digital kitchen scale to weigh your flour. Scooping directly from the bag can compact the flour, leading to excess. Instead, spoon the flour lightly into a measuring cup and level it off with a knife. This method prevents over-packing and keeps your 0.25 cup measurement true to 1.06 ounces.</p>  
<p>If you're adapting a recipe from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>our collection</a>, always double-check conversions. Many UK bakers prefer weighing ingredients for reliability, especially when using an air fryer. A small discrepancy in flour can affect how evenly your dish cooks.</p>  

<h3>Common Mistakes When Measuring Flour</h3>  
<p>One frequent error is tapping the measuring cup after filling it, which settles the flour and adds extra weight. Another is using a liquid measuring cup instead of a dry one, leading to inaccuracies. Always use proper tools and techniques for consistent results, particularly in air fryer baking where precision is key.</p>

<h3>Using Self-Raising Flour in Air Fryer Recipes</h3>  
<p>Self-raising flour is a staple in many air fryer recipes, from batters to doughs. Its built-in leavening agent helps create lift without additional baking powder. Just remember: 0.25 cup equals 1.06 ounces, so adjust your recipes accordingly for flawless results every time.</p>

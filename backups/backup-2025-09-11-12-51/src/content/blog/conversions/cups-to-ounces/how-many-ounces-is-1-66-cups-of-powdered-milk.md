faqQ1: "Can I use liquid milk instead of powdered milk in my air fryer recipes?"
faqA1: "Yes, you can substitute liquid milk for powdered milk, but you'll need to adjust the recipe. Generally, 1 cup of liquid milk replaces 1/4 cup of powdered milk mixed with 1 cup of water. Keep in mind that liquid milk may affect cooking times slightly in your air fryer."
faqQ2: "How do I measure 1.66 cups of powdered milk without a measuring cup?"
faqA2: "If you don't have a measuring cup, use a kitchen scale to weigh out 13.28 ounces (the equivalent of 1.66 cups). Alternatively, you can use a standard mug—just note that mug sizes vary, so this method is less precise. For accuracy, investing in a set of measuring cups is best."
faqQ3: "Does the brand of powdered milk affect the weight per cup?"
faqA3: "Different brands may have slight variations in density, but the difference is usually minimal. Most powdered milk brands weigh about 8 ounces per cup. For precise results, especially in baking, stick to one brand once you've tested it in your recipes."
faqQ4: "Can I use 1.66 cups of powdered milk in savoury air fryer dishes?"
faqA4: "Absolutely! Powdered milk works well in savoury dishes like breaded chicken or fish coatings. Just ensure you're using the correct amount (13.28 ounces for 1.66 cups) to maintain the right consistency. It adds a subtle creaminess without overpowering other flavours."

faqQ1: "How do I convert 2.5 cups of caster sugar to grams?"
faqA1: "2.5 cups of caster sugar is roughly 500 grams. This conversion is useful for UK bakers who prefer metric measurements. For air fryer recipes, weighing ingredients ensures accuracy and better results."
faqQ2: "Can I use granulated sugar instead of caster sugar in air fryer recipes?"
faqA2: "Yes, but granulated sugar has larger crystals, which may affect texture. For best results, pulse granulated sugar in a blender to mimic caster sugar’s fineness. Adjust measurements slightly if needed."
faqQ3: "Why does caster sugar weigh less than brown sugar per cup?"
faqA3: "Caster sugar has finer grains and less moisture, making it lighter. Brown sugar’s molasses content adds density, so 2.5 cups weigh more. Always check your recipe’s sugar type for accurate conversions."
faqQ4: "How do I store leftover caster sugar for future air fryer baking?"
faqA4: "Keep caster sugar in an airtight container in a cool, dry place. This prevents clumping and maintains freshness. For long-term storage, consider a sealed jar to avoid moisture absorption."

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on precise ingredient ratios to deliver crispy, evenly cooked results. Too much or too little liquid, like soy milk, can affect texture and cooking times. For example, adding excess soy milk to a batter might make it too runny, leading to soggy outcomes. On the other hand, too little could dry out your dish.

Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> for perfectly measured ideas.</p>  

<h3>How to measure soy milk correctly</h3>  
<p>Use a liquid measuring cup for soy milk, filling it to the 1.33-cup mark at eye level. For ounces, a kitchen scale provides the most accurate reading. If you don’t have one, remember that 1 cup of soy milk weighs roughly 8 ounces, so 1.33 cups is about 10.64 ounces. This method works for both UK and US measurements, making it versatile for all recipes on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for soy milk in air fryer recipes</h2>  
<p>Soy milk is a popular dairy substitute in air fryer baking, from pancakes to muffins. Its mild flavor and creamy texture make it ideal for vegan or lactose-free dishes. For instance, a <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>vegan cake</a> might call for 1.33 cups (10.64 oz) of soy milk to achieve the right moisture. It’s also great for savory coatings, like breadcrumbs for tofu or chicken. Always measure carefully to avoid altering the recipe’s balance.</p>  

<h3>Tips for substituting soy milk in recipes</h3>  
<p>If a recipe specifies dairy milk, soy milk can usually replace it 1:1, including the 1.33 cups (10.64 oz) measurement. However, unsweetened soy milk works best for savory dishes, while vanilla-flavored varieties add sweetness to desserts. For crispy results, pat ingredients dry before air frying, especially when using wet batters with soy milk. Need cleaning tips?

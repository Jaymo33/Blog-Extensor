faqQ1: "Does 1 cup of flour always weigh 4.4 ounces?"
faqA1: "While 4.4 ounces is the standard weight for 1 cup of all-purpose flour, factors like humidity, compaction, and flour type can cause slight variations. For example, whole wheat flour is denser, weighing closer to 4.8 ounces per cup. Always spoon flour into your measuring cup for the most accurate results."
faqQ2: "Can I use a kitchen scale instead of measuring cups for flour?"
faqA2: "Absolutely! A kitchen scale is the most precise way to measure flour, especially for air fryer baking where consistency is key. Simply set your scale to ounces, tare the container, and add flour until you reach 4.4 ounces (or your recipe’s required amount). This eliminates guesswork and improves texture."
faqQ3: "Why does my air fryer baking turn out dry or dense?"
faqA3: "Overmeasuring flour is a common culprit. If you scoop flour directly from the bag, you might pack in extra ounces unintentionally, leading to dry results. Always use the spoon-and-level method or a scale. Also, check your air fryer’s temperature—some models run hotter, requiring slight recipe adjustments."
faqQ4: "How do I convert grams to ounces for flour in UK recipes?"
faqA4: "Since UK recipes often list flour in grams, remember that 1 ounce equals roughly 28.35 grams. So, 125 grams of flour (a common metric measure) is about 4.4 ounces.

<h2>Why accurate flour measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers circulate hot air rapidly, so ingredient ratios must be spot-on to prevent uneven baking. Too much flour can dry out your dish, while too little may leave it undercooked. For example, air fryer cakes or muffins rely on the right balance of flour to rise properly. If you're converting recipes from volume (cups) to weight (ounces), a kitchen scale is your best friend. Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for other handy measurements.</p>  

<p>British bakers often use metric weights, but many recipes still list flour in cups. A standard UK measuring cup holds 250ml, but flour’s weight varies slightly due to settling or scooping methods. For consistent results, spoon flour into the cup and level it off—don’t pack it down. Need inspiration? Try our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>air fryer cake recipes</a>, where precise flour measurements make all the difference.</p>  

<h3>How to measure 1 cup of flour correctly</h3>  
<p>To get exactly 4.4 ounces of flour per cup, fluff the flour in its bag first to aerate it. Then, lightly spoon it into your measuring cup without tapping or shaking. Use a straight edge (like a knife) to level the top. This method prevents compacting, which could add up to 20% more flour by weight. For air fryer baking, even small discrepancies can affect texture—especially in delicate treats like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cookies>cookies</a>.</p>  

<h2>Common flour types and their ounce equivalents</h2>  
<p>Not all flours weigh the same per cup. All-purpose flour averages 4.4 ounces, but whole wheat flour is denser at around 4.8 ounces per cup. Cake flour, being lighter, clocks in at roughly 4 ounces. If you’re adapting recipes for your air fryer, always check the type of flour specified. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion guide</a> includes these variations to simplify your prep.</p>  

<p>For gluten-free baking in the air fryer, almond flour weighs about 3.2 ounces per cup, while coconut flour is closer to 4.5 ounces. These differences highlight why weighing flour (rather than relying solely on cups) guarantees better results.

<h3>Tips for scaling recipes in your air fryer</h3>  
<p>When adjusting serving sizes, convert all dry ingredients—including flour—to ounces for accuracy. Air fryer baskets have limited space, so halving or doubling recipes requires careful math. Remember: 1 cup of flour = 4.4 ounces, whether you’re making one serving or six. For more pro tips, visit <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>.</p>

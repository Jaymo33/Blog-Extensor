faqQ1: "How do I measure 0.375 cup of crushed garlic without a measuring cup?"
faqA1: "If you don’t have a measuring cup, use a kitchen scale to weigh out 3 ounces (85 grams) of crushed garlic. Alternatively, 0.375 cup is equivalent to 6 tablespoons, which can be measured with a standard spoon set."
faqQ2: "Does the type of garlic affect the weight per cup?"
faqA2: "Yes, freshly crushed garlic is lighter than pre-minced jarred garlic due to moisture content. For 0.375 cup, freshly crushed garlic weighs closer to 3 ounces, while jarred garlic may be slightly heavier. Always adjust for consistency in your air fryer recipes."
faqQ3: "Can I substitute garlic powder for crushed garlic in this measurement?"
faqA3: "Garlic powder is more concentrated, so 0.375 cup of crushed garlic translates to about 1.5 tablespoons of garlic powder. Adjust to taste, as powders can intensify during air frying."
faqQ4: "Why does my garlic burn in the air fryer?"
faqA4: "Garlic burns easily due to its high sugar content. To prevent this, mix 0.375 cup (3 ounces) of crushed garlic with oil or other ingredients before air frying. Lower temperatures and shorter cook times also help."

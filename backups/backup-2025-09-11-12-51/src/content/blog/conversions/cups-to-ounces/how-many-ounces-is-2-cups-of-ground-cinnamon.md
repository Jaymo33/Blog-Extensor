faqQ1: "How do I convert 2 cups of ground cinnamon to grams?"
faqA1: "2 cups of ground cinnamon equal roughly 250 grams. This conversion is useful for UK recipes, as many scales default to grams. For air fryer cooking, weighing ingredients ensures accuracy, especially in baked goods."
faqQ2: "Can I use tablespoons instead of cups for measuring cinnamon?"
faqA2: "Yes, but you’ll need 32 tablespoons to match 2 cups (1 cup = 16 tablespoons). For small quantities, tablespoons work, but for larger amounts like 2 cups, a scale or measuring cup is more efficient."
faqQ3: "Does the brand of cinnamon affect the weight per cup?"
faqA3: "Slightly. Finely ground cinnamon packs more densely, so a cup may weigh a bit more than coarser varieties. Always check your recipe’s requirements and adjust if needed."
faqQ4: "How should I store leftover ground cinnamon?"
faqA4: "Keep it in an airtight container in a cool, dark place to preserve flavour. Proper storage ensures your cinnamon stays fresh for up to six months, ready for your next air fryer creation."

<p>2 cups of ground cinnamon equals approximately 8.8 ounces (or 250 grams) in UK measurements. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise ingredient quantities can make or break your dish. Whether you're whipping up cinnamon rolls or adding a warm spice to roasted vegetables, knowing the exact weight ensures consistency.

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on even heat distribution, so ingredient quantities must be precise for optimal results. Too much cinnamon can overpower a dish, while too little might leave it bland. Measuring by weight (ounces) rather than volume (cups) eliminates guesswork, especially for ground spices like cinnamon.

<p>Ground cinnamon is a staple in many air fryer recipes, from sweet treats like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>cakes</a> to savoury dishes. Its density can vary slightly depending on how finely it’s ground, but 2 cups typically weigh around 8.8 ounces. If you're scaling a recipe, always double-check conversions to avoid mishaps.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure 2 Cups of Ground Cinnamon Correctly</h3>  
<p>For the most accurate measurement, use a kitchen scale set to ounces. If you don’t have one, lightly spoon the cinnamon into a measuring cup without packing it down. Avoid tapping the cup, as this compacts the spice and skews the weight. Need more air fryer baking guidance?

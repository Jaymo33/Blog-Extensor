faqQ1: "Can I use fresh milk instead of 1.5 cups of powdered milk in air fryer recipes?"
faqA1: "Yes, but you’ll need to adjust the recipe. Replace 1.5 cups of powdered milk (12 ounces) with 6 cups of fresh milk, as powdered milk is concentrated. Reduce other liquids in the recipe to maintain the right consistency for air frying."
faqQ2: "Why does my air fryer recipe turn out dry when using powdered milk?"
faqA2: "Overmeasuring powdered milk can absorb too much moisture. Ensure you’re using exactly 1.5 cups (12 ounces) and not packing it into the measuring cup. Sifting the powdered milk beforehand helps distribute it evenly in batters."
faqQ3: "How do I store leftover powdered milk after measuring 1.5 cups?"
faqA3: "Keep it in an airtight container in a cool, dry place. Powdered milk lasts up to 18 months unopened, but once opened, use it within 3–6 months for best results in air fryer recipes."
faqQ4: "Is 1.5 cups of powdered milk the same in UK and US measurements?"
faqA4: "Yes, 1.5 cups of powdered milk equals 12 ounces in both UK and US measurements. However, always use a kitchen scale for precision, as cup sizes can vary slightly between brands."

faqQ1: "Is 1.5 cups of molasses the same as 18 ounces in the UK?"
faqA1: "Yes, in the UK 1.5 cups of molasses is equivalent to approximately 18 ounces. While UK and US cup measurements can vary slightly for some ingredients, for thick liquids like molasses the difference is negligible. It's always best to weigh ingredients for complete accuracy in your air fryer recipes."
faqQ2: "How can I measure 1.5 cups of molasses without making a mess?"
faqA2: "To measure 1.5 cups of molasses (18 ounces) cleanly, lightly grease your measuring cup with oil first. The molasses will slide out more easily. Alternatively, use a kitchen scale to weigh out 18 ounces directly into your mixing bowl. This method is more accurate and creates less mess for your air fryer recipes."
faqQ3: "Can I use golden syrup instead of molasses in my air fryer recipe?"
faqA3: "While golden syrup can substitute for molasses in some recipes, the flavour will be different. Molasses has a stronger, more bitter taste. If substituting, use the same weight (18 ounces for 1.5 cups), but expect a lighter flavour in your air fryer dish. The texture and cooking time shouldn't be affected."
faqQ4: "Why does my air fryer smoke when cooking with molasses?"
faqA4: "Molasses can smoke in the air fryer because its sugars caramelise and burn at high temperatures. To prevent this, place a liner or some water in the bottom of your air fryer basket to catch drips. Also consider reducing the temperature slightly and cooking for longer when using 1.5 cups (18 ounces) of molasses in your recipe."

faqQ1: "Can I use Greek yogurt instead of plain yogurt for the 2.5 cups measurement?"
faqA1: "Yes, but Greek yogurt is thicker, so 2.5 cups will weigh slightly more (around 22 ounces). Adjust liquids in your recipe if needed. For air fryer recipes, the texture may change, so keep an eye on cooking times."
faqQ2: "How do I measure 2.5 cups of plain yogurt without a measuring cup?"
faqA2: "Use a kitchen scale to weigh out 20 ounces (567 grams) for accuracy. Alternatively, a standard UK mug holds about 1 cup, so 2.5 mugs will give you roughly the right amount. Fluff the yogurt first to avoid overpacking."
faqQ3: "Does the fat content of plain yogurt affect the weight in ounces?"
faqA3: "No, 2.5 cups of plain yogurt (whether full-fat or low-fat) will still be approximately 20 ounces. However, fat content can change how it behaves in recipes, especially in air fryer cooking."
faqQ4: "Can I freeze 2.5 cups of plain yogurt for later use in air fryer recipes?"
faqA4: "Yes, but thawed yogurt may separate. Stir well before using it in marinades or batters. For best results, freeze in 20-ounce portions for easy measuring later. Avoid freezing yogurt-based dips, as the texture may change."

Turmeric, a staple in many kitchens, is often used in both cooking and baking, so knowing its weight is crucial.

<p>Turmeric’s vibrant yellow hue can stain surfaces, so measuring correctly reduces waste and mess. Whether you're making a marinade or a dry rub, knowing the weight of 3 cups of turmeric simplifies the process. Many recipes, especially those on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>our recipes page</a>, rely on precise measurements for consistency.

<h3>How to measure turmeric correctly</h3>  
<p>For the most accurate results, use a kitchen scale to weigh your turmeric. Scooping it directly from the bag or jar can lead to inconsistencies due to settling or clumping. If you don’t have a scale, fluff the turmeric with a spoon before lightly spooning it into a measuring cup. Avoid packing it down, as this can lead to using more than needed.

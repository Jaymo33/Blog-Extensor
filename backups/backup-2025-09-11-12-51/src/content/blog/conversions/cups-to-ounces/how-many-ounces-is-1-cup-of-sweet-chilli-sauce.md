faqQ1: "Is 1 cup of sweet chilli sauce the same as 8 fluid ounces?"
faqA1: "No, 1 cup of sweet chilli sauce is approximately 8.5 weight ounces, not fluid ounces. Fluid ounces measure volume, while weight ounces account for density. Sweet chilli sauce is thicker than water, so its weight differs. Always use a kitchen scale for accuracy in air fryer recipes."
faqQ2: "Can I use a tablespoon to measure 1 cup of sweet chilli sauce?"
faqA2: "Yes, but it’s time-consuming. There are 16 tablespoons in 1 cup, so you’d need to measure 16 times. For thick sauces like sweet chilli, a liquid measuring cup or scale is faster and more precise. This ensures your air fryer dishes turn out perfectly every time."
faqQ3: "Does the brand of sweet chilli sauce affect the weight per cup?"
faqA3: "Slight variations can occur between brands due to ingredient density. Some sauces are thicker or sweeter, altering the weight. Always check the label for specific conversions. For consistent results in air fryer cooking, stick to one brand when possible."
faqQ4: "How long does 1 cup of sweet chilli sauce last in the fridge?"
faqA4: "An opened bottle of sweet chilli sauce lasts about 3-4 months refrigerated. If you’ve measured out 1 cup (8.5 oz), store leftovers in an airtight container. Use it within 2 weeks for best quality in your air fryer recipes. Always check for signs of spoilage before use."

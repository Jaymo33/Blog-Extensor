<p>1.25 cups of pumpkin seeds equals approximately 5.5 ounces (or 156 grams). This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes, ensuring accurate measurements for perfect results every time. Whether you’re roasting pumpkin seeds for a snack or using them in a dish, knowing the weight helps maintain consistency. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we focus on precise measurements to elevate your cooking.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on even heat distribution, so using the right amount of ingredients ensures everything cooks uniformly. Too many pumpkin seeds can overcrowd the basket, leading to uneven roasting. Conversely, too few might burn quickly. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> simplifies these calculations, taking the guesswork out of cooking.</p>  

<p>Pumpkin seeds are a versatile ingredient, perfect for snacks, salads, or even as a crunchy topping. Whether you’re following a recipe from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>our collection</a> or experimenting, knowing the exact weight ensures success. For example, 1.25 cups of pumpkin seeds (5.5 oz) roasted at 180°C for 10 minutes yields perfectly crispy results.</p>  

<h3>How to measure pumpkin seeds correctly</h3>  
<p>For the most accurate measurement, use a kitchen scale. However, if you only have measuring cups, lightly spoon the seeds into the cup without packing them down. This prevents over-measuring, which can affect cooking times.

faqQ1: "Is 0.125 cup of golden syrup the same as 2 tablespoons?"
faqA1: "Yes, 0.125 cup equals exactly 2 tablespoons. This measurement is particularly useful for small-batch air fryer recipes where precision matters. When converting to ounces, these 2 tablespoons of golden syrup weigh approximately 1.5 ounces."
faqQ2: "Does golden syrup weigh the same as honey when measuring?"
faqA2: "Golden syrup and honey have similar densities, but not identical weights. While 0.125 cup of golden syrup equals 1.5 ounces, the same volume of honey weighs slightly more at about 1.6 ounces. For air fryer recipes, this small difference usually doesn't affect results, but for precision baking, it's best to measure by weight."
faqQ3: "Can I use this conversion for other syrups in air fryer recipes?"
faqA3: "The 0.125 cup to 1.5 ounce conversion works well for golden syrup, but other syrups may vary. Maple syrup, for example, is slightly less dense at about 1.3 ounces for 0.125 cup. Always check specific conversions when substituting ingredients in air fryer recipes to ensure perfect results."
faqQ4: "How should I store golden syrup for air fryer cooking?"
faqA4: "Store golden syrup in an airtight container at room temperature. Before measuring, give it a good stir as separation can occur. For easy measuring in small quantities like 0.125 cup (1.5 oz), warm the syrup slightly to make it less viscous. Always wipe any drips from your air fryer basket immediately to prevent sticky buildup."

faqQ1: "Is 3 cups of plain yogurt the same as 24 ounces in the UK?"
faqA1: "Yes, 3 cups of plain yogurt is approximately 24 ounces in the UK. While cup measurements can vary slightly by region, the standard conversion is 1 cup = 8 ounces. For precise air fryer recipes, using a kitchen scale to measure 24 ounces ensures accuracy."
faqQ2: "Can I use Greek yogurt instead of plain yogurt for the same measurement?"
faqA2: "Greek yogurt is thicker than plain yogurt, so 3 cups will weigh slightly more—around 27 ounces. If substituting, adjust other liquids in your recipe to maintain the right consistency. For air fryer baking, this can affect texture, so stick to plain yogurt unless the recipe specifies otherwise."
faqQ3: "How do I convert 3 cups of plain yogurt to grams?"
faqA3: "3 cups of plain yogurt (24 ounces) is roughly 680 grams. This conversion is handy for UK recipes that use metric measurements. Always weigh ingredients for air fryer cooking to ensure perfect results, especially in baked goods or marinades."
faqQ4: "What’s the best way to measure 3 cups of plain yogurt without a scale?"
faqA4: "Use a liquid measuring cup for the most accurate results. Spoon the yogurt into the cup without packing it down, then level it off with a straight edge. For sticky yogurt, lightly grease the measuring cup first to help it slide out cleanly. This method works well for air fryer recipes requiring precise amounts."

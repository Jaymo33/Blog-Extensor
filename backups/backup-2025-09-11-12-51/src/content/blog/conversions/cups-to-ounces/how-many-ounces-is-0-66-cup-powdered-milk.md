faqQ1: "Can I use liquid milk instead of powdered milk in air fryer recipes?"
faqA1: "Yes, you can substitute liquid milk for powdered milk, but you'll need to adjust the recipe. Generally, 1 cup of liquid milk replaces 1/4 cup of powdered milk mixed with 1 cup of water. Keep in mind that this may slightly alter the texture of your dish."

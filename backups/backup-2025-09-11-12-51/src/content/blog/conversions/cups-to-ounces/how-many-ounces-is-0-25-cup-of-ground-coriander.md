faqQ1: "Can I use whole coriander seeds instead of ground coriander?"

faqQ2: "Does ground coriander lose its potency over time?"
faqA2: "Ground coriander does lose flavour after 6–12 months. Store it in an airtight container away from heat and light. For best results in air fryer recipes, use fresh ground coriander."
faqQ3: "How does 0.25 cup ground coriander compare to fresh coriander?"

faqQ4: "Can I freeze ground coriander to keep it fresh longer?"
faqA4: "Freezing isn’t recommended for ground coriander, as moisture can clump it. Instead, buy small quantities and store in a cool, dark place. For air fryer recipes, fresh spices yield the best results."

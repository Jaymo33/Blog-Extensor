faqQ1: "Can I use granulated sugar instead of brown sugar for 0.33 cup in an air fryer recipe?"
faqA1: "Yes, but the results will differ. Brown sugar adds moisture and a caramel-like flavour due to its molasses content. If substituting, use the same weight (2.64 oz) of granulated sugar, but expect a drier, crisper texture in air fryer recipes."
faqQ2: "How do I store leftover brown sugar after measuring 0.33 cup?"
faqA2: "Keep brown sugar in an airtight container to prevent hardening. If it clumps, place a slice of bread or a damp paper towel in the container overnight to restore moisture. Proper storage ensures accurate measurements for future air fryer recipes."
faqQ3: "Why does my air fryer recipe taste too sweet with 0.33 cup of brown sugar?"
faqA3: "Air fryers intensify flavours due to concentrated heat. If your dish is overly sweet, try reducing the brown sugar by 10-15% or balancing it with acidic ingredients like lemon juice. Always measure carefully for the best results."
faqQ4: "Is 0.33 cup of brown sugar the same as 1/3 cup?"
faqA4: "No, 0.33 cup is slightly less than 1/3 cup (which is 0.333... cup). For precision in air fryer baking, stick to the exact measurement of 0.33 cup (2.64 oz) to avoid minor discrepancies that could affect your recipe."

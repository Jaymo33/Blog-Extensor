faqQ1: "Can I use granulated sugar instead of brown sugar for 0.125 cup measurements?"
faqA1: "Yes, but the texture and flavour will differ. Granulated sugar weighs slightly less (0.125 cup ≈ 0.88 oz), and lacks brown sugar’s moisture. For air fryer recipes, brown sugar’s caramel notes work best in glazes and baked goods."
faqQ2: "How do I store brown sugar to keep it fresh for accurate 0.125 cup measurements?"
faqA2: "Store brown sugar in an airtight container with a terra cotta disc or marshmallow to prevent hardening. If it clumps, microwave briefly with a damp paper towel to restore texture for precise 0.125 cup-to-ounce conversions."
faqQ3: "Why does my air fryer recipe taste too sweet with 0.125 cup of brown sugar?"
faqA3: "Overpacking the cup can add extra ounces. Always spoon lightly and level off. For less sweetness, reduce to 1 tablespoon (0.5 oz) or mix with spices like cinnamon."
faqQ4: "Can I double 0.125 cup of brown sugar for larger batches in the air fryer?"
faqA4: "Absolutely! Doubling 0.125 cup (1 oz) to 0.25 cup (2 oz) works fine. Ensure your air fryer isn’t overcrowded to maintain even caramelisation. Check our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe hub</a> for scaling tips."

faqQ1: "Does the type of cheese affect the weight per cup?"
faqA1: "Yes, different cheeses have varying densities. Hard cheeses like parmesan weigh more per cup than softer cheeses like mozzarella. However, for most common grated cheeses like cheddar, the 4 ounces per cup (or 2.64 ounces for 0.66 cup) conversion works well."
faqQ2: "Can I use pre-shredded cheese for air fryer recipes?"
faqA2: "Pre-shredded cheese works fine, but it often contains anti-caking agents that can affect melting. For best results in your air fryer, freshly grated cheese is ideal. If using pre-shredded, you might need slightly less than 0.66 cup (about 2.5 ounces) as it's typically more densely packed."
faqQ3: "How do I convert 0.66 cup of grated cheese to grams?"
faqA3: "0.66 cup of grated cheese (approximately 2.64 ounces) equals about 75 grams. This conversion is useful for UK recipes that use metric measurements. Remember that cheese types vary, so this is an approximate guide for most common cheeses."
faqQ4: "Why does my air fryer cheese sometimes burn?"
faqA4: "Air fryers cook with intense, direct heat that can quickly burn cheese. To prevent this, add cheese in the last 1-2 minutes of cooking or use lower temperatures (around 160Â°C). Also, spreading the cheese evenly rather than piling it helps it melt without burning."

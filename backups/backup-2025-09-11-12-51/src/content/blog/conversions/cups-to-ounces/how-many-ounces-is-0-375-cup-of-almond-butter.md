faqQ1: "Can I use peanut butter instead of almond butter in the same quantity?"
faqA1: "While you can substitute peanut butter for almond butter, the weights differ slightly. 0.375 cup of peanut butter equals about 3.2 ounces, compared to almond butter's 3 ounces. For best results in air fryer recipes, adjust the quantity or expect a slightly different texture."
faqQ2: "How do I clean almond butter from my air fryer basket?"
faqA2: "For sticky almond butter residue, use warm soapy water and our recommended <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner</a>. Avoid abrasive scrubbers that could damage the non-stick coating. For stubborn spots, a paste of baking soda and water works wonders."
faqQ3: "Why does my almond butter measurement seem inconsistent?"
faqA3: "Almond butter's density changes with temperature and separation. Always stir well before measuring, and consider weighing for accuracy. The oil content means 0.375 cup measurements can vary by up to 10% if not properly prepared."
faqQ4: "Can I freeze measured portions of almond butter for later use?"
faqA4: "Absolutely! Portion 0.375 cup (3 ounce) amounts into silicone molds or small containers before freezing. Thaw in the refrigerator overnight when needed. Frozen almond butter works perfectly in most air fryer recipes after thawing."

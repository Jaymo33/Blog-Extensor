faqQ1: "How do I convert 2 cups of minced garlic to grams?"
faqA1: "To convert 2 cups of minced garlic to grams, multiply the ounces by 28.35. Since 2 cups equal 16 ounces, that’s approximately 453.6 grams. This conversion is handy for recipes using metric measurements or precise baking."
faqQ2: "Can I use jarred minced garlic instead of fresh for this measurement?"
faqA2: "Yes, jarred minced garlic works for this conversion, but the flavour may differ slightly. One cup of jarred minced garlic also weighs around 8 ounces, so 2 cups would still be 16 ounces. Adjust seasoning to taste, as preserved garlic can be milder."
faqQ3: "Does the size of the garlic cloves affect the weight in ounces?"
faqA3: "Larger cloves may yield slightly more minced garlic by volume, but the weight in ounces remains consistent. Whether you’re using small or large cloves, 2 cups of minced garlic will still weigh approximately 16 ounces when properly measured."
faqQ4: "How long does 2 cups of minced garlic last in the fridge?"
faqA4: "Fresh minced garlic lasts about 1–2 weeks in the fridge if stored in an airtight container. For longer storage, freeze it in portions. In the freezer, minced garlic can stay fresh for up to 3 months without losing much flavour."

<h2>Why accurate minced garlic measurements matter</h2>  
<p>Garlic is a powerhouse of flavour, and too much or too little can drastically alter your dish. In air fryer cooking, where heat distribution is rapid, balanced ingredients are key. For example, 16 ounces of minced garlic in a marinade will evenly coat your protein or veggies. If you're exploring new recipes, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipes section</a> offers plenty of inspiration.</p>  

<p>Minced garlic also varies in density depending on how finely it's chopped. Packed cups will weigh more than loosely filled ones, so weighing in ounces removes guesswork. This precision is especially useful for batch cooking or meal prep, where consistency is crucial.

<h3>How to measure minced garlic correctly</h3>  
<p>For the most accurate results, use a kitchen scale to weigh your minced garlic in ounces. If you don’t have one, spoon the garlic lightly into a measuring cup without packing it down. This method ensures you’re close to the 16-ounce mark for 2 cups. Avoid using liquid measuring cups, as they can lead to uneven amounts.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for 2 cups of minced garlic</h2>  
<p>Two cups (or 16 ounces) of minced garlic is ideal for large-batch cooking. Think garlic butter for bread, marinades for grilled meats, or base flavours for soups and stews. In the air fryer, this quantity works perfectly for garlic-roasted potatoes or shrimp.

<p>You can also freeze minced garlic in portions for later use. Simply divide the 16 ounces into ice cube trays or small containers. When you’re ready to cook, pop a portion straight into your air fryer dish. This trick saves time and keeps your garlic fresh for weeks.

<h3>Adjusting recipes for personal taste</h3>  
<p>While 16 ounces is the standard conversion, feel free to tweak the amount based on your preference. If you love bold garlic flavours, add an extra ounce or two. For milder dishes, reduce the quantity slightly. The air fryer’s intense heat mellows garlic’s sharpness, so don’t be afraid to experiment.</p>

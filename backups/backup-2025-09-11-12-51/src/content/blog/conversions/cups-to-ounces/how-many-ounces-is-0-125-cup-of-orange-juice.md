faqQ1: "Can I use bottled orange juice instead of fresh for 0.125 cup measurements?"
faqA1: "Yes, bottled orange juice works fine for measuring 0.125 cup (1 oz). However, fresh juice often has a brighter flavour, which can enhance air fryer recipes like marinades or glazes. Just ensure the bottled juice is 100% pure with no added sugars for the best results."
faqQ2: "How does 0.125 cup of orange juice affect cooking times in an air fryer?"
faqA2: "Using 0.125 cup of orange juice (1 oz) in marinades or glazes typically doesn’t significantly alter cooking times. However, excess liquid can create steam, so patting meat dry before air frying ensures crispiness. Always follow recipe guidelines for optimal results."
faqQ3: "What’s the best way to measure 0.125 cup of orange juice without a measuring cup?"
faqA3: "If you don’t have a measuring cup, use a kitchen scale to weigh 1 oz of orange juice. Alternatively, 0.125 cup is equivalent to 2 tablespoons, which can be measured with a standard spoon. Accuracy is key for air fryer recipes."
faqQ4: "Can I substitute lemon juice for orange juice in a 0.125 cup measurement?"
faqA4: "Yes, you can substitute lemon juice, but it will add a tangier flavour. Use the same 0.125 cup (1 oz) measurement, and adjust other seasonings to balance the taste. This works well in air fryer recipes for poultry or seafood."

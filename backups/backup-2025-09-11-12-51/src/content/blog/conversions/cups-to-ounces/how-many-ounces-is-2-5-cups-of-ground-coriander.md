faqQ1: "Can I use whole coriander seeds instead of ground coriander in my air fryer recipes?"
faqA1: "Yes, but you’ll need to adjust the quantity. Whole coriander seeds have a more concentrated flavour, so use about half the amount. For 2.5 cups of ground coriander (10 oz), substitute with 1.25 cups of whole seeds. Crush them lightly before adding to your dish for better distribution."
faqQ2: "How does ground coriander affect cooking times in an air fryer?"
faqA2: "Ground coriander itself doesn’t change cooking times, but the amount used can influence moisture levels. Too much spice may dry out lighter ingredients like fish or tofu. Stick to the 2.5 cups to ounces conversion (10 oz) for balanced results, and always follow your recipe’s recommended air fryer settings."
faqQ3: "Is there a difference between UK and US ounces for measuring ground coriander?"
faqA3: "No, both systems use the same ounce measurement for weight. Whether you’re converting 2.5 cups of ground coriander to oz UK or US, the result is the same: approximately 10 ounces. The key difference lies in cup sizes (UK cups are slightly larger), so always specify which cup measurement you’re using."
faqQ4: "Can I freeze ground coriander to extend its shelf life?"
faqA4: "Freezing isn’t recommended, as it can cause ground coriander to lose its aromatic oils. Instead, store it in an airtight container in a cool, dark cupboard. If you’ve converted 2.5 cups to ounces and have excess, share it with friends or use it within six months for optimal flavour."

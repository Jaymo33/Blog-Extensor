faqQ1: "Can I use regular milk instead of evaporated cream in air fryer recipes?"
faqA1: "Yes, but evaporated cream is thicker and richer, so you may need to adjust quantities. For every 0.125 cup of evaporated cream, use 0.125 cup of regular milk plus 1 teaspoon of butter for a similar consistency."
faqQ2: "How do I store leftover evaporated cream?"
faqA2: "Transfer unused evaporated cream to an airtight container and refrigerate for up to 5 days. Stir well before using, as separation can occur. For longer storage, freeze in small portions."
faqQ3: "Is evaporated cream the same as condensed milk?"
faqA3: "No, evaporated cream is unsweetened, while condensed milk has added sugar. They’re not interchangeable in recipes unless adjustments are made to sweetness and texture."
faqQ4: "Can I make evaporated cream at home?"
faqA4: "Yes, simmer regular cream until it reduces by half. This homemade version works well in air fryer recipes, but measure carefully—0.125 cup still equals 1 oz."

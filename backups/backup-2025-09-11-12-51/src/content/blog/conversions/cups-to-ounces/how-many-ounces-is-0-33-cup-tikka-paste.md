faqQ1: "Can I use 0.33 cup of tikka paste for vegetarian air fryer recipes?"
faqA1: "Absolutely! 0.33 cup (2.64 ounces) of tikka paste works wonderfully with vegetables, paneer, or tofu in the air fryer. The quantity provides robust flavour without overpowering more delicate ingredients. Just adjust cooking times as plant-based foods often cook faster than meat."
faqQ2: "How does the ounce measurement change if my tikka paste is particularly thick?"
faqA2: "Thicker pastes may weigh slightly more per cup - potentially up to 3 ounces for 0.33 cup. If your paste is very dense, it's best to weigh it for accuracy. Pressing the paste firmly into the measuring cup can help standardise the amount when scales aren't available."
faqQ3: "Is 0.33 cup of tikka paste too spicy for children's portions?"
faqA3: "For milder palates, you might reduce the 2.64 ounces by half and mix with yogurt. Most commercial tikka pastes are moderately spiced, but brands vary. Always check heat levels on the jar and consider doing a small test batch in your air fryer first."
faqQ4: "Can I freeze leftover tikka paste after measuring out 0.33 cup?"
faqA4: "Yes, tikka paste freezes well for up to 3 months. Portion it in ice cube trays (about 0.5 ounces per cube) for easy future use. Thaw overnight in the fridge before your next air fryer cooking session. This prevents waste and saves prep time."

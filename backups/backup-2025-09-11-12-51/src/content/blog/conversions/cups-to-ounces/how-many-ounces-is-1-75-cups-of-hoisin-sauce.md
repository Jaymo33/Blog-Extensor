faqQ1: "Can I use a kitchen scale to measure 1.75 cups of hoisin sauce?"
faqA1: "Yes, a kitchen scale is a great tool for measuring hoisin sauce. Simply set it to ounces and measure out 14 ounces, which is equivalent to 1.75 cups. This method is especially useful for sticky sauces like hoisin, as it avoids the mess of measuring cups."
faqQ2: "How does hoisin sauce affect cooking times in an air fryer?"
faqA2: "Hoisin sauce can slightly increase cooking times due to its sugar content, which caramelises under heat. When using 1.75 cups (14 oz) in a marinade or glaze, expect a longer cooking time to achieve that perfect sticky finish. Always check your food periodically to avoid burning."
faqQ3: "Is hoisin sauce gluten-free?"
faqA3: "Not all hoisin sauces are gluten-free, as many contain wheat-based ingredients. If you’re cooking for a gluten-free diet, check the label or opt for a certified gluten-free brand. This is especially important when measuring 1.75 cups for air fryer recipes."
faqQ4: "Can I substitute hoisin sauce with another ingredient?"
faqA4: "If you’re out of hoisin sauce, a mix of soy sauce, peanut butter, and honey can mimic its flavour. However, the consistency and sweetness will differ, so adjust your measurements accordingly. For 1.75 cups of hoisin sauce (14 oz), you’ll need to experiment with ratios."

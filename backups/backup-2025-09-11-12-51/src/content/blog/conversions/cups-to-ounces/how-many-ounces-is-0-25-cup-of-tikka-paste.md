faqQ1: "Can I use grams instead of ounces for tikka paste measurements?"
faqA1: "Absolutely! 0.25 cup (2 oz) of tikka paste is about 57 grams. Many UK scales default to grams, making this a convenient alternative. For air fryer recipes, either unit works—just stay consistent."
faqQ2: "Does the brand of tikka paste affect the weight per 0.25 cup?"
faqA2: "Slight variations exist between brands due to ingredient density. However, most tikka pastes weigh close to 2 oz per 0.25 cup. For precision, check the label or weigh your preferred brand once to confirm."
faqQ3: "How long should I marinate chicken with 0.25 cup of tikka paste in the air fryer?"
faqA3: "For best results, marinate chicken for at least 30 minutes (or overnight) before air frying. The 0.25 cup (2 oz) quantity coats 500g of chicken evenly. Cook at 180°C for 15–18 minutes, flipping halfway."
faqQ4: "Can I freeze leftover tikka paste measured in 0.25 cup portions?"
faqA4: "Yes! Freeze 0.25 cup (2 oz) portions in ice cube trays or small containers. Thaw in the fridge before use. This prevents waste and lets you grab pre-measured amounts for quick air fryer meals."

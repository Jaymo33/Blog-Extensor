faqQ1: "Can I use fresh corn instead of frozen in an air fryer?"
faqA1: "Yes, fresh corn works well in an air fryer, but cooking times may vary slightly. Fresh corn tends to have more moisture, so you might need to adjust the temperature or time. If substituting, use the same weight (10 oz for 1.25 cups) for consistency."
faqQ2: "Why does my frozen corn come out soggy in the air fryer?"
faqA2: "Soggy corn usually means overcrowding or insufficient heat. Spread the corn in a single layer and cook at a higher temperature (around 200°C) for better crispiness. Patting the corn dry before cooking can also help."
faqQ3: "How do I convert other cup measurements of frozen corn to ounces?"
faqA3: "A general rule is that 1 cup of frozen corn equals about 8 ounces. So, for 2 cups, you'd use 16 oz, and for 0.5 cups, it's roughly 4 oz. A kitchen scale ensures the most accurate measurement."
faqQ4: "Can I season frozen corn before air frying?"
faqA4: "Absolutely! Toss the corn with oil, salt, pepper, or spices like paprika or garlic powder before cooking. This enhances flavour and helps achieve a crispier texture. Just ensure even coating for best results."

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers cook food quickly and evenly, but portion sizes can affect the outcome. Too much or too little of an ingredient, like frozen corn, might lead to uneven cooking or texture issues. For example, overcrowding the basket with excess corn can result in steaming rather than crisping. On the other hand, too little might burn before achieving the desired doneness. That's why converting 1.25 cups of frozen corn to ounces (10 oz) helps maintain consistency.</p>

<h3>How to measure frozen corn correctly</h3>  
<p>When measuring frozen corn, it's best to use a dry measuring cup for accuracy. Lightly fill the cup without packing the kernels down, then level it off with a straight edge. If your recipe calls for ounces, a kitchen scale is the most precise tool. For 1.25 cups of frozen corn, you'll need about 10 ounces, but slight variations can occur depending on the corn's density.</p>  

<h2>Best ways to use frozen corn in an air fryer</h2>  
<p>Frozen corn is a fantastic ingredient for air fryer cooking because it retains moisture while crisping up nicely.

faqQ1: "Is 2 cups of pineapple juice the same as 16 oz by weight?"
faqA1: "Yes, for most practical purposes, 2 cups of pineapple juice equals 16 fluid ounces, which is roughly 16 oz by weight. The density of pineapple juice is close enough to water that the volume-to-weight conversion is nearly identical in recipes."
faqQ2: "Can I use canned pineapple juice instead of fresh for air fryer recipes?"
faqA2: "Absolutely! Canned pineapple juice works just as well as fresh in air fryer marinades or glazes. Just ensure it's 100% juice with no added sugars if you're aiming for a healthier dish. The flavour and acidity levels are nearly identical."
faqQ3: "How do I convert 2 cups of pineapple juice to millilitres?"
faqA3: "2 cups of pineapple juice is approximately 473 millilitres (ml). This conversion is handy if you're using a metric measuring jug or following a European recipe. Most air fryer recipes tolerate small rounding differences, so 475 ml is often acceptable."
faqQ4: "Does pineapple juice affect cooking times in the air fryer?"
faqA4: "Pineapple juice can slightly reduce cooking times when used as a marinade, as its acidity helps tenderise meats faster. However, avoid over-marinating (more than 2 hours for delicate proteins like shrimp) to prevent mushiness. Always pat meats dry before air frying for crispier results."

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Precision is key when preparing meals in an air fryer, especially for marinades, glazes, or sauces. Using the right amount of pineapple juice can make or break a dish.

<h3>How to measure pineapple juice correctly</h3>

<h3>Converting pineapple juice for UK measurements</h3>

<h2>Tips for storing pineapple juice</h2>  
<p>Once opened, pineapple juice should be refrigerated and used within 5–7 days for the best flavour. If you're prepping for meal prep, consider freezing portions in ice cube trays for easy use later. Thawed pineapple juice works just as well in marinades or sauces.</p>

faqQ1: "Is 3 cups of hoisin sauce the same as 24 ounces in the UK?"
faqA1: "Yes, 3 cups of hoisin sauce equals 24 ounces in the UK. The conversion is consistent because both cups and ounces are standardised measurements. However, always check your recipe’s origin, as some international recipes might use different cup sizes."
faqQ2: "Can I use a kitchen scale to measure 3 cups of hoisin sauce in ounces?"
faqA2: "Absolutely! A kitchen scale is the most accurate way to measure 24 ounces (3 cups) of hoisin sauce. Simply set your scale to ounces, tare the container, and spoon in the sauce until you reach the desired weight. This method eliminates measuring cup inaccuracies."
faqQ3: "How do I adjust a recipe if I only have 12 ounces of hoisin sauce?"
faqA3: "If your recipe calls for 3 cups (24 oz) but you only have 12 ounces, halve all other ingredients to maintain the correct ratios. Alternatively, use the 12 ounces and reduce cooking time slightly, as less sauce may cook faster in the air fryer."
faqQ4: "Does hoisin sauce weight change if it’s refrigerated?"
faqA4: "No, refrigeration doesn’t affect the weight of hoisin sauce. However, cold sauce may thicken, making it harder to measure. Let it sit at room temperature for 10 minutes before measuring for accuracy. Always stir well if separation occurs."

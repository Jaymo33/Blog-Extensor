faqQ1: "Can I use single cream instead of double cream for 0.66 cup measurements?"
faqA1: "Yes, but single cream has a lower fat content (around 18%), so the texture will be thinner. If substituting, note that 0.66 cup of single cream still equals ~5.28 oz, but the recipe may need adjustments. For air fryer dishes requiring richness, double cream is preferable."
faqQ2: "How do I convert 0.66 cup of double cream to grams?"
faqA2: "0.66 cup of double cream is roughly 150 grams. Since 1 ounce equals 28.35 grams, 5.28 oz converts to 150 grams. For air fryer baking, grams offer even more precision than ounces, especially for international recipes."
faqQ3: "Why does my air fryer recipe call for 0.66 cup instead of a full cup?"
faqA3: "Air fryers are ideal for smaller portions, and 0.66 cup (5.28 oz) avoids overfilling the basket. Recipes like individual custards or mini gratins benefit from precise measurements. Always follow the recipe’s cup or ounce amounts for best results."
faqQ4: "Can I freeze leftover double cream after measuring 0.66 cup?"
faqA4: "Freezing double cream is possible, but it may separate when thawed. For best results, whip it before freezing or use it in cooked dishes like soups. For air fryer recipes, fresh cream ensures the creamiest texture."

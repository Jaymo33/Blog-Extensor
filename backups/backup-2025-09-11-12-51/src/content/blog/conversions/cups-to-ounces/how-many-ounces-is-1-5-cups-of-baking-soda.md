faqQ1: "Can I use baking powder instead of baking soda in my air fryer?"
faqA1: "Baking powder and baking soda aren’t interchangeable. Baking soda requires an acid (like yogurt or vinegar) to activate, while baking powder contains its own acid. Substituting one for the other can affect texture and taste. Stick to the recipe for best results."
faqQ2: "How do I store baking soda to keep it fresh for air fryer recipes?"
faqA2: "Store baking soda in an airtight container in a cool, dry place. Moisture can cause clumping and reduce its effectiveness. For long-term storage, keep it away from strong odors, as it absorbs smells easily."
faqQ3: "Why does my air fryer recipe taste bitter when using baking soda?"
faqA3: "Bitterness usually means you’ve used too much baking soda. Always measure carefully—1.5 cups equals 12 oz. If the recipe calls for less, adjust accordingly. Also, ensure it’s evenly distributed in the batter or dough."
faqQ4: "Can baking soda help clean my air fryer?"
faqA4: "Yes! A paste of baking soda and water can remove stubborn grease and odors. Just apply, let it sit, then wipe clean. For a deep clean, check our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner guide</a>."

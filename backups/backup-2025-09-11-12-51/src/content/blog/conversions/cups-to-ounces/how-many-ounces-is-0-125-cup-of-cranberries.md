faqQ1: "Can I use frozen cranberries instead of fresh for 0.125 cup measurements?"
faqA1: "Yes, but thaw and drain them first to remove excess moisture. Frozen cranberries may weigh slightly more due to ice, so pat them dry before measuring for accuracy in your air fryer recipes."
faqQ2: "How many grams is 0.125 cup of cranberries?"
faqA2: "0.125 cup of cranberries is roughly 28 grams. This conversion is useful for UK bakers using digital scales. Remember, air fryer recipes often benefit from precise measurements for even cooking."
faqQ3: "Do dried cranberries weigh the same as fresh for 0.125 cup?"
faqA3: "No, dried cranberries are lighter. Use about 0.125 cup plus 1 teaspoon to match the weight of fresh. Adjust air fryer times slightly, as dried fruit cooks faster than fresh."
faqQ4: "Can I substitute other berries for cranberries in air fryer recipes?"
faqA4: "Yes, but adjust sweetness and cooking times. Blueberries or chopped strawberries work well, but their juiciness may require recipe tweaks. Always check our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> for tailored advice."

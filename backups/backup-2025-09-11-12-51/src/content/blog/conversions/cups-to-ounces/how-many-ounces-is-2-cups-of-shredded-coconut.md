faqQ1: "Can I use desiccated coconut instead of shredded coconut in air fryer recipes?"
faqA1: "Yes, but desiccated coconut is finer and drier, so you may need slightly less. For 2 cups of shredded coconut (5.3 oz), use about 1.75 cups of desiccated coconut for a similar texture. Adjust based on your recipe’s needs."
faqQ2: "How do I measure shredded coconut accurately for air frying?"
faqA2: "Lightly spoon shredded coconut into a measuring cup without packing it down. For the most precision, weigh it—2 cups should be around 150 grams or 5.3 ounces. A kitchen scale ensures consistent results in air fryer cooking."
faqQ3: "Does toasted shredded coconut weigh the same as untoasted?"
faqA3: "Toasted coconut is slightly lighter due to moisture loss, but the difference is minimal for most recipes. If toasting before measuring, 2 cups will still be roughly 5.3 ounces, but it may appear fluffier."
faqQ4: "Can I freeze shredded coconut for later use in air fryer recipes?"
faqA4: "Absolutely! Freezing shredded coconut preserves its freshness. Portion it into 2-cup (5.3 oz) amounts in airtight bags for easy use. Thaw at room temperature before adding to your air fryer dishes."

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on even cooking, and incorrect ingredient quantities can lead to uneven results.

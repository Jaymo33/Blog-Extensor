faqQ1: "Does the type of onion affect the weight when measuring 1.75 cups?"
faqA1: "Yes, the type of onion can slightly affect the weight. Sweet onions are typically less dense than yellow or white onions, so 1.75 cups might weigh a bit less. However, the difference is usually minimal â€“ around 0.5 ounces at most for this quantity."
faqQ2: "Can I use frozen minced onion instead of fresh for this measurement?"
faqA2: "You can use frozen minced onion, but it may contain more moisture. When thawed, frozen minced onion could weigh slightly more than fresh. For accuracy, measure it while still frozen if your recipe allows, or pat it dry before measuring for fresh equivalency."
faqQ3: "How does minced onion compare to onion powder in measurements?"
faqA3: "Onion powder is much more concentrated in flavour. Generally, 1 tablespoon of onion powder equals about 1/4 cup of minced fresh onion. So for 1.75 cups of minced onion, you'd need approximately 7 tablespoons of onion powder, but adjust to taste."
faqQ4: "What's the best way to mince onions for accurate cup measurements?"
faqA4: "For consistent results, use a sharp knife to create uniformly small pieces. Avoid using a food processor as it can make the onion too watery. After mincing, let the onion sit for a minute before measuring to allow any excess moisture to evaporate."

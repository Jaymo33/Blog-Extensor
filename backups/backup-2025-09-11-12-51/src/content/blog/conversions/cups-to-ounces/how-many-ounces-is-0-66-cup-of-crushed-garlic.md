faqQ1: "Can I use minced garlic instead of crushed garlic for 0.66 cup measurements?"
faqA1: "Yes, but minced garlic is less dense, so you may need slightly more to match the weight. For 0.66 cup of crushed garlic (3.17 oz), use about 0.75 cup of minced garlic to achieve a similar flavour intensity."
faqQ2: "How long does crushed garlic last in the fridge?"
faqA2: "Crushed garlic stays fresh for about a week when stored in an airtight container in the fridge. For longer storage, freeze it in small portions. Always check for discolouration or off smells before using."
faqQ3: "Does 0.66 cup of crushed garlic equal the same in cloves?"
faqA3: "Not exactly. One medium garlic clove yields about 0.5 teaspoon crushed garlic. For 0.66 cup (32 teaspoons), you’d need roughly 64 cloves, but this can vary based on clove size."
faqQ4: "Can I substitute garlic powder for 0.66 cup crushed garlic?"
faqA4: "Yes, but the conversion differs. Use 1.5 tablespoons of garlic powder for every 0.66 cup of crushed garlic. Adjust to taste, as powdered garlic has a more concentrated flavour."

<h3>How to Measure Cocoa Powder Correctly</h3>  
<p>For the most accurate results, use a kitchen scale to weigh your cocoa powder. If you don’t have one, spoon the cocoa powder into a measuring cup and level it off with a knife. Avoid packing it down, as this can lead to excess cocoa in your recipe.</p>  

<h2>Converting Cups to Ounces for UK Bakers</h2>

<h3>Air Fryer Baking Tips with Cocoa Powder</h3>  
<p>Air fryers bake faster than conventional ovens, so adjust cooking times accordingly. When using cocoa powder in air fryer recipes, ensure even distribution for consistent flavour. Preheating your air fryer can also help achieve better results.</p>  

<h2>Common Mistakes When Measuring Cocoa Powder</h2>  
<p>One frequent error is using a liquid measuring cup for dry ingredients like cocoa powder. Dry measuring cups are designed to provide accurate volumes, while liquid cups can lead to inconsistencies. Always use the right tools for precision.</p>  

<p>Another mistake is forgetting to sift cocoa powder before measuring. Sifting removes lumps and aerates the powder, ensuring a lighter texture in your bakes.

<h3>Storing Cocoa Powder for Freshness</h3>  
<p>To maintain its quality, store cocoa powder in an airtight container in a cool, dark place. Exposure to moisture or heat can cause clumping and affect flavour. Proper storage ensures your cocoa stays fresh for all your baking needs.</p>

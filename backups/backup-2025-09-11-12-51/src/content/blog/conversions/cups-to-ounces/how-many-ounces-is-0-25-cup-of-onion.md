faqQ1: "Can I use frozen onions instead of fresh for 0.25 cup measurements?"
faqA1: "Yes, frozen onions can be used as a substitute. 0.25 cup of frozen onion also weighs approximately 1 ounce. However, frozen onions may release more moisture during cooking, so adjust cooking times slightly in your air fryer to account for this."
faqQ2: "How many onions do I need to make 0.25 cup?"
faqA2: "One small onion (about the size of a lime) typically yields around 1 cup when chopped. So, you’d need roughly a quarter of a small onion to get 0.25 cup. For precise air fryer recipes, weighing the onion ensures accuracy."
faqQ3: "Does the type of onion affect the weight per cup?"
faqA3: "Different onion varieties (red, white, or sweet) have similar densities, so 0.25 cup of any type will still be close to 1 ounce. However, sweeter onions like Vidalia may feel slightly lighter due to higher water content."
faqQ4: "How should I store leftover chopped onion?"
faqA4: "Store unused chopped onion in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 3 days. For longer storage, freeze it in 0.25 cup (1-ounce) portions—perfect for future air fryer recipes. Always label with the date to track freshness."

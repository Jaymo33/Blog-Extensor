faqQ1: "Can I use pearl barley instead of rolled barley in air fryer recipes?"
faqA1: "Yes, but pearl barley takes longer to cook than rolled barley in an air fryer. You may need to adjust cooking times and liquid amounts. Rolled barley cooks faster due to its flattened shape, making it ideal for quick air fryer meals."
faqQ2: "How does 0.125 cup of rolled barley compare to other grains in ounces?"
faqA2: "Different grains have varying weights per cup. While 0.125 cup of rolled barley equals 0.5 oz, the same volume of oats weighs slightly less (about 0.4 oz). Always check specific conversions for the grain you’re using in your air fryer recipes."
faqQ3: "Why is my air fryer barley coming out too dry?"
faqA3: "This usually happens when there’s not enough moisture in the recipe or the cooking time is too long. For 0.125 cup (0.5 oz) of rolled barley, try reducing the temperature by 10°C and checking for doneness a few minutes early. A light spritz of oil can also help."
faqQ4: "Can I cook 0.125 cup of rolled barley directly in the air fryer?"
faqA4: "Yes, but it’s best to mix it with other ingredients or use a small oven-safe dish inside the air fryer basket. Cooking such a small amount alone may cause it to blow around. Combine it with vegetables or protein for best results."

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Getting the right amount of rolled barley is crucial for air fryer recipes. Too much or too little can affect texture and cooking time. Rolled barley, like other grains, absorbs moisture differently based on quantity. This makes precise measurements essential for consistent results.

<p>Air fryers cook food faster than conventional ovens, so ingredient ratios matter even more. A slight variation in rolled barley quantity could lead to uneven cooking or dryness. That’s why we recommend using a kitchen scale for accuracy.

faqQ1: "Can I use double cream instead of single cream for 0.33 cup measurements?"
faqA1: "Yes, but double cream has a higher fat content, which can make your dish richer. If substituting, you may need to adjust other liquids in the recipe to balance the texture. For air fryer cooking, single cream is often preferred for its lighter consistency."

faqA2: "0.33 cup of single cream is approximately 75 grams. This conversion is useful if your recipe uses metric measurements. Always check your air fryer recipe’s requirements, as some may specify weight for accuracy."
faqQ3: "Why does my air fryer recipe call for 0.33 cup of single cream?"
faqA3: "This measurement is common in smaller batches or when a recipe needs just enough cream for moisture without being overly heavy. Air fryers work best with precise amounts, so 0.33 cup (2.64 oz) ensures even cooking."
faqQ4: "Can I use plant-based cream as a substitute for 0.33 cup of single cream?"
faqA4: "Yes, but the texture and taste may vary. Plant-based creams often have different thicknesses, so you might need to adjust the quantity slightly. Test a small batch first to ensure it works with your air fryer recipe."

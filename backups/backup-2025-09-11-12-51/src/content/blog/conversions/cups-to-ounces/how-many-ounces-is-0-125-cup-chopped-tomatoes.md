<h3>How to Measure 0.125 Cup of Chopped Tomatoes</h3>  
<p>Use a standard measuring cup for liquids or a kitchen scale for accuracy. Lightly pack the tomatoes without crushing them to get the right volume. If you don’t have a 0.125 cup measure, 2 tablespoons (which is 1 oz) will do the trick. This method works perfectly for <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable-based air fryer dishes</a>.</p>  

<h2>Common Recipes Using 0.125 Cup Chopped Tomatoes</h2>  
<p>This small but mighty measurement pops up in many air fryer recipes. Think bruschetta toppings, mini frittatas, or even <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken dishes</a> where tomatoes add moisture and flavour. Since air fryers cook quickly, the 1 oz (0.125 cup) portion ensures the tomatoes cook through without making the dish soggy.</p>  
<p>For frozen preparations, like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/frozen-foods>frozen foods</a>, thawing and draining excess liquid is crucial before measuring. This keeps your 0.125 cup of chopped tomatoes at the right consistency for air frying. Always pat them dry to avoid steam buildup, which can affect crispiness.</p>  

<h3>Scaling Up or Down for Larger Batches</h3>  
<p>Need more than 0.125 cup? Simply multiply the ounces accordingly—2 cups of chopped tomatoes would be 16 oz. This scaling works brilliantly for meal preppers or family-sized portions. Just adjust air fryer timings slightly to account for the increased quantity.</p>

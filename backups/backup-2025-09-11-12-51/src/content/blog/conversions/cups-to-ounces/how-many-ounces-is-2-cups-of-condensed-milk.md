faqQ1: "Can I use evaporated milk instead of condensed milk in air fryer recipes?"
faqA1: "No, evaporated milk and condensed milk aren’t interchangeable. Condensed milk is sweetened and thicker, while evaporated milk is unsweetened with a lighter consistency. Substituting one for the other will significantly alter your recipe’s taste and texture."
faqQ2: "How do I measure 2 cups of condensed milk without a measuring cup?"
faqA2: "If you don’t have a measuring cup, use a kitchen scale to weigh out 20 ounces (567 grams) of condensed milk. Alternatively, a standard UK mug holds roughly 1 cup, so two mugfuls would approximate the amount needed. Just ensure it’s leveled off for accuracy."
faqQ3: "Why does my air fryer recipe with condensed milk turn out too sweet?"
faqA3: "Condensed milk is inherently very sweet, so recipes using 2 cups (20 ounces) may need balancing ingredients like citrus juice or salt to cut the sweetness. Always taste your mixture before cooking and adjust other flavors accordingly."
faqQ4: "Can I freeze leftover condensed milk after measuring 2 cups?"
faqA4: "Yes, you can freeze condensed milk for up to 3 months. Thaw it in the fridge overnight and stir well before using, as separation may occur. Note that texture changes slightly, so it’s best used in cooked or baked dishes rather than no-bake recipes."

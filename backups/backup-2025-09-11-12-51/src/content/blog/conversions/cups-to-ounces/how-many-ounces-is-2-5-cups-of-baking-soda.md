<h2>Why accurate measurements matter</h2>

<h3>How to measure baking soda correctly</h3>  
<p>When measuring baking soda, always use a dry measuring cup and level it off with a straight edge. Scooping directly from the container can lead to packed cups, resulting in inaccurate measurements. For 2.5 cups of baking soda, this method ensures you get the correct 20-ounce weight.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for baking soda in air fryers</h2>

faqQ1: "Can I use gelatin sheets instead of powder for 2 cups?"
faqA1: "Yes, you can substitute gelatin sheets for powder, but the conversion differs. One tablespoon of gelatin powder is roughly equivalent to 3-4 sheets. For 2 cups (16 ounces) of powder, you’d need about 48-64 sheets, depending on their strength. Always check the packaging for specific instructions."
faqQ2: "Does the type of gelatin powder affect the weight per cup?"
faqA2: "Most gelatin powders have a similar weight, but flavoured or sweetened varieties might vary slightly. Always check the label for exact measurements. For precision, weighing your gelatin powder is best, especially in air fryer recipes where consistency matters."
faqQ3: "How do I store leftover gelatin powder after measuring 2 cups?"
faqA3: "Store unused gelatin powder in an airtight container in a cool, dry place. Avoid humidity, as it can cause clumping. Proper storage ensures the powder remains fresh and ready for your next air fryer recipe."
faqQ4: "Can I halve a recipe that calls for 2 cups of gelatin powder?"
faqA4: "Absolutely! If a recipe requires 2 cups (16 ounces) of gelatin powder, halving it would mean using 1 cup (8 ounces). Adjust other ingredients proportionally, and keep an eye on cooking times in your air fryer, as smaller quantities may cook faster."

faqQ1: "Can I use desiccated coconut instead of shredded coconut in air fryer recipes?"
faqA1: "Yes, but adjust measurements slightly. Desiccated coconut is finer and denser, so 1.33 cups would weigh closer to 4 oz. Reduce by about 0.5 oz for similar texture in air fryer coatings or toppings."
faqQ2: "Why does my shredded coconut burn in the air fryer?"
faqA2: "Shredded coconut browns quickly due to its sugar content. At 3.5 oz (1.33 cups), spread it evenly and check at 3-minute intervals. Lower the temperature by 10°C if needed, especially for recipes over 160°C."
faqQ3: "How should I store leftover shredded coconut after measuring 1.33 cups?"
faqA3: "Keep unused shredded coconut in an airtight container for up to 6 months. For freshness, refrigerate after opening. This ensures your next 3.5 oz portion stays flavourful for air fryer recipes."
faqQ4: "Is 1.33 cups of shredded coconut the same weight as fresh coconut?"
faqA4: "No, fresh coconut is heavier due to moisture. 1.33 cups fresh grated coconut weighs ~5 oz. Always use dried shredded coconut (3.5 oz per 1.33 cups) for air fryer recipes to prevent excess steam and uneven cooking."

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on even cooking, and incorrect ingredient quantities can throw off your dish. Too much shredded coconut, for example, might burn before the food is fully cooked.

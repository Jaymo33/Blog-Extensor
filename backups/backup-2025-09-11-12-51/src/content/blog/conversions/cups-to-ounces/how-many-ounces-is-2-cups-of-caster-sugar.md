faqQ1: "Is 2 cups of caster sugar the same as 2 cups of granulated sugar in ounces?"
faqA1: "No, they weigh slightly differently. While 2 cups of caster sugar equals about 14.1 ounces, granulated sugar is slightly heavier at about 16 ounces for 2 cups. The difference comes from how the sugars pack into the cup due to their crystal size."
faqQ2: "Can I use the same ounce measurement for brown sugar as caster sugar?"
faqA2: "Brown sugar is denser than caster sugar, so 2 cups would weigh more - about 16 ounces for packed brown sugar. If substituting, it's best to weigh your ingredients rather than relying on cup measurements for accurate results."
faqQ3: "How do I convert 2 cups of caster sugar to ounces if my recipe is in grams?"
faqA3: "2 cups of caster sugar equals 14.1 ounces, which converts to 400 grams. Most digital scales allow you to switch between ounces and grams, making it easy to measure precisely for your air fryer recipes."
faqQ4: "Why do UK and US cup measurements differ for caster sugar?"
faqA4: "The UK uses metric cups (250ml) while the US uses customary cups (240ml). However, the weight difference is minimal - about 0.2 ounces per cup. For air fryer baking where precision matters, it's better to work in weights rather than volumes."

<p>2 cups of caster sugar equals approximately 14.1 ounces (400 grams) in UK measurements. Whether you're baking a cake or whipping up a batch of cookies, getting the sugar measurement right is crucial for perfect results. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we know precision matters, especially when adapting recipes for your air fryer.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate sugar measurements matter</h2>  
<p>Using the correct amount of caster sugar ensures your baked goods have the right texture and sweetness. Too much sugar can make desserts overly sweet or cause uneven baking in your air fryer. Too little, and your treats might turn out dry or lack flavour. Many of our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer dessert recipes</a> rely on precise sugar measurements for consistent results.</p>  

<p>Caster sugar is finer than granulated sugar, which means it dissolves more easily and distributes evenly in batters. This makes it ideal for air fryer baking, where even heat distribution is key. If you're converting from cups to ounces, always use a kitchen scale for the most accurate measurement.</p>  

<h2>Converting cups to ounces for caster sugar</h2>  
<p>In the UK, 1 cup of caster sugar typically weighs around 7.05 ounces (200 grams). Therefore, 2 cups of caster sugar equals about 14.1 ounces (400 grams). This conversion is essential when following recipes from different sources, especially American ones that use volume measurements.</p>  

<p>For air fryer recipes, where quantities are often smaller, even slight measurement errors can affect outcomes. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> includes common ingredient weights to help you adapt recipes perfectly. Remember that humidity and how you pack the cup can slightly affect the weight, so weighing is always best.</p>  

<h3>How to measure caster sugar without scales</h3>  
<p>If you don't have kitchen scales, use the spoon-and-level method for measuring caster sugar. Gently spoon the sugar into your measuring cup until it's heaping, then level off the top with a straight edge. Never pack the sugar down, as this will give you more than the recipe intends.</p>  

<h2>Using caster sugar in air fryer recipes</h2>  
<p>Caster sugar works beautifully in air fryer desserts because it incorporates so well into batters and doughs. From <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>air fryer cakes</a> to cookies, the fine texture ensures even sweetness throughout. When a recipe calls for 2 cups of caster sugar (14.1 ounces), you can be confident your treats will bake evenly in the air fryer's circulating heat.</p>  

<p>Remember that air fryers cook faster than conventional ovens, so sugar-heavy recipes might brown more quickly. Keep an eye on your baking and consider reducing the temperature slightly if needed. After baking, always <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>clean your air fryer</a> properly to prevent sugar residues from burning during future use.</p>  

<h3>Adjusting recipes for different sugar types</h3>  
<p>If you only have granulated sugar, you can pulse it briefly in a food processor to make a caster sugar substitute. Use the same weight (14.1 ounces for 2 cups), but be aware the texture might be slightly different. For <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cookies>air fryer cookies</a>, this substitution usually works well, but for delicate sponges, proper caster sugar is best.</p>

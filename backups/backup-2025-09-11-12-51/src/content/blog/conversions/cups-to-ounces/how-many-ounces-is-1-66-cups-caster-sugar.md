faqQ1: "Can I use granulated sugar instead of caster sugar in air fryer recipes?"
faqA1: "Yes, but the texture may differ. Caster sugar dissolves faster, making it better for light bakes like sponges. For most air fryer recipes, granulated sugar works in a pinch, but grind it briefly in a blender for a finer consistency."
faqQ2: "How do I measure 1.66 cups of caster sugar without a measuring cup?"
faqA2: "Use a kitchen scale to weigh out 13.28 ounces (376 grams) of caster sugar. If you don't have a scale, fill a standard mug (about 240ml) just over halfway, as 1.66 cups is roughly 390ml. Level off the top for accuracy."
faqQ3: "Why does my air fryer bake differently with caster sugar?"
faqA3: "Caster sugar's fine texture affects how quickly it caramelizes and dissolves, which can alter browning and moisture in air fryer bakes. Reduce cooking time by 1-2 minutes and check for doneness early to avoid over-browning."
faqQ4: "Is 1.66 cups of caster sugar the same in US and UK measurements?"
faqA4: "Yes, 1.66 cups of caster sugar equals 13.28 ounces in both US and UK measurements. However, UK cups are slightly larger (284ml vs. 240ml), but the weight per cup remains consistent for caster sugar. Always weigh for precision."

If you're adapting traditional recipes for your air fryer, precise measurements like these are key.

<h3>Why accurate sugar measurements matter</h3>  
<p>Using the correct amount of caster sugar ensures your baked goods have the right texture and sweetness. Too much sugar can make desserts overly sweet or cause them to brown too quickly in the air fryer. Too little can result in dry or bland treats. Measuring by weight (ounces) is more reliable than volume (cups), as it accounts for how tightly packed the sugar is. This is especially important for air fryer recipes, where cooking times are shorter and precision is crucial.</p>  

<h2>Converting 1.66 cups of caster sugar to ounces</h2>  
<p>To convert 1.66 cups of caster sugar to ounces, multiply the number of cups by the weight per cup. As mentioned, 1 cup of caster sugar weighs about 8 ounces, so 1.66 x 8 = 13.28 ounces. This calculation works for UK measurements and ensures your recipes turn out perfectly.

<p>If you don't have a kitchen scale, you can use measuring cups, but be sure to spoon the sugar into the cup and level it off for accuracy. Scooping directly from the bag can compact the sugar, leading to an incorrect measurement. For best results, invest in a digital scale to weigh your ingredients, especially when working with air fryer recipes where precision is key.

If you're converting a recipe from grams to cups, remember that 1 ounce equals roughly 28 grams, so 13.28 ounces is about 376 grams. This level of detail ensures your air fryer bakes are consistently delicious.

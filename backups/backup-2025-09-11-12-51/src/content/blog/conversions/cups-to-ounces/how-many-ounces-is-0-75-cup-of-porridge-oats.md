faqQ1: "Can I use instant oats instead of porridge oats for this measurement?"

faqA2: "0.75 cup of porridge oats is roughly 64 grams. This conversion is useful for recipes using metric measurements. Always use a scale for precision, especially in baking."
faqQ3: "Why does my air fryer recipe with 0.75 cup oats turn out dry?"
faqA3: "Over-measuring or insufficient liquid can cause dryness. Ensure you’re using the correct 2.25 oz (0.75 cup) and follow recipe liquid ratios. Lightly spraying with oil also helps."
faqQ4: "Can I substitute steel-cut oats for porridge oats in this measurement?"
faqA4: "No, steel-cut oats are denser. 0.75 cup would weigh about 3 oz, altering the recipe’s texture. Stick to porridge oats unless the recipe specifies otherwise."

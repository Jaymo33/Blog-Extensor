faqQ1: "Can I use a different oil if I don’t have sesame oil?"
faqA1: "Yes, you can substitute sesame oil with other oils like olive or vegetable oil, but the flavour will differ. Sesame oil has a distinct nutty taste, so adjust seasonings accordingly. For air frying, lighter oils work well, but reduce the quantity slightly as they may be less dense."
faqQ2: "How do I store sesame oil to keep it fresh?"
faqA2: "Store sesame oil in a cool, dark place or the fridge to extend its shelf life. It can solidify when chilled but will return to liquid at room temperature. Always check for rancidity before use—fresh sesame oil should smell nutty, not bitter."
faqQ3: "Why is my air fryer recipe too oily even with 0.25 cup of sesame oil?"
faqA3: "If your dish is greasy, you might be using too much oil or not preheating the air fryer. Try reducing the oil slightly or patting excess off ingredients before cooking. Also, ensure you’re using the correct conversion—0.25 cup equals 2 ounces."
faqQ4: "Can I use toasted sesame oil in air fryer recipes?"
faqA4: "Yes, toasted sesame oil adds a deeper flavour but is more potent. Use half the amount (1 oz for 0.25 cup) to avoid overpowering your dish. It’s great for finishing touches rather than high-heat cooking."

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer baking</h2>

Using 0.66 cup of baking powder (5.28 oz) ensures consistency, especially in recipes like air-fried doughnuts or quick breads.

<p>For UK bakers, converting cups to ounces can be tricky due to differing standards. However, 0.66 cup of baking powder translates reliably to 5.28 ounces, making it easier to follow international recipes. Whether you're making <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>air fryer cakes</a> or savoury dishes, this conversion ensures accuracy.</p>  

<h3>How to measure 0.66 cup of baking powder</h3>  
<p>Use a dry measuring cup for the most accurate results. Spoon the baking powder into the cup lightly without packing it down, then level it off with a straight edge. For smaller quantities, a kitchen scale set to ounces (5.28 oz for 0.66 cup) is even more precise. This method is especially useful for air fryer recipes where consistency matters.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for 0.66 cup of baking powder</h2>

<p>Remember, baking powder loses potency over time, so always check the expiry date before measuring 0.66 cup (5.28 oz). Storing it in an airtight container helps maintain freshness, ensuring your air fryer creations turn out light and fluffy every time.</p>  

<h3>Adjusting recipes for different air fryer models</h3>  
<p>Some air fryers cook faster than others, which may require slight adjustments to baking powder quantities. If you're using a compact model, reducing the 0.66 cup (5.28 oz) slightly may prevent over-rising. For larger models, sticking to the exact measurement ensures even cooking.

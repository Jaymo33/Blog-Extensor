faqQ1: "Can I use stock instead of broth for 1.25 cups in an air fryer recipe?"
faqA1: "Yes, you can substitute stock for broth in a 1:1 ratio. Both provide similar liquid volumes (1.25 cups = 10 oz), though stock tends to be richer. Adjust seasonings accordingly, as stocks often contain more salt and herbs."
faqQ2: "How do I measure 1.25 cups of chicken broth without a measuring cup?"
faqA2: "If you don’t have a measuring cup, use a kitchen scale: 1.25 cups of chicken broth weighs about 10 oz. Alternatively, a standard UK mug holds roughly 10 oz, so filling it to just below the rim will give you the right amount."
faqQ3: "Does the type of chicken broth affect the ounce measurement?"
faqA3: "Most liquid broths measure similarly (1.25 cups = 10 oz), but condensed or powdered broths require reconstitution. Always check the label—for example, some powders need 1 teaspoon per 8 oz water, so you’d adjust to reach 10 oz total."
faqQ4: "Can I use 1.25 cups of chicken broth in frozen air fryer meals?"
faqA4: "Absolutely! Freeze broth in 10-oz portions for future use. When ready to cook, add it frozen to dishes like casseroles—the air fryer’s heat will thaw and incorporate it evenly. Just extend cooking time by 2–3 minutes if needed."

<p>1.25 cups of chicken broth equals 10 fluid ounces (or approximately 10 oz by weight for most standard broths). This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes, where precise measurements can make or break a dish. Whether you’re whipping up a creamy soup or a flavourful sauce, getting the liquid quantities right ensures consistency and taste.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on rapid air circulation to cook food evenly, and liquids like chicken broth play a crucial role in keeping dishes moist. Using too much or too little broth can affect texture and flavour. For example, a recipe calling for 1.25 cups of chicken broth (10 oz) might turn out dry if under-measured or soggy if over-measured. That’s why conversions like this are so handy.</p>  

<p>If you’re new to air fryer cooking, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for quick reference. It covers everything from cups to ounces, grams, and millilitres, making recipe adjustments a breeze. You’ll find it especially useful for dishes like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipes</a>, where broth is often a key ingredient.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure 1.25 Cups of Chicken Broth Correctly</h3>  
<p>For the most accurate results, use a liquid measuring cup designed for fluids like broth. Fill it to the 1.25-cup mark, ensuring the meniscus (the curve at the liquid’s surface) aligns with the measurement line. If you’re using a kitchen scale, 1.25 cups of chicken broth typically weighs around 10 ounces, though this can vary slightly depending on the broth’s density.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for 1.25 Cups of Chicken Broth in Air Fryer Recipes</h2>  
<p>This quantity is perfect for small-batch cooking. For instance, you might use 1.25 cups (10 oz) of chicken broth to deglaze the air fryer basket after roasting vegetables or to create a base for a savoury sauce. It’s also ideal for <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>one-pot air fryer meals</a>, where liquids help distribute heat evenly.</p>  

<p>Another great application is marinating proteins like chicken or tofu. A mixture of 1.25 cups of broth with herbs and spices can infuse deep flavour without overwhelming the dish. Just remember to pat ingredients dry before air frying to avoid excess moisture.</p>  

<h3>Converting Other Chicken Broth Quantities</h3>  
<p>If your recipe calls for more or less broth, here’s a quick reference: 1 cup = 8 oz, 0.5 cups = 4 oz, and 2 cups = 16 oz.

<h2>Tips for Storing Leftover Chicken Broth</h2>  
<p>If you’ve opened a carton to measure out 1.25 cups (10 oz), store the remainder in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 4 days. For longer storage, freeze it in ice cube trays—each cube is roughly 1 oz, making future measurements effortless. This trick is a game-changer for <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/meal-prep>meal prep enthusiasts</a>.</p>  

<p>When reheating frozen broth for air fryer use, thaw it overnight in the fridge or melt it gently in a saucepan. Avoid microwaving directly if you’re adding it to air fryer dishes, as uneven heating can affect cooking times.</p>

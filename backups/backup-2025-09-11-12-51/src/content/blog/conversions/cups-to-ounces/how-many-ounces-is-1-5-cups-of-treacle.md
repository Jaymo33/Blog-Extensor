faqQ1: "Can I use golden syrup instead of treacle in air fryer recipes?"
faqA1: "Yes, golden syrup can substitute treacle at a 1:1 ratio in most air fryer recipes. However, golden syrup is lighter and sweeter than treacle, so your baked goods may have a slightly different flavour profile and less intense colour. For the closest match, use dark treacle substitutes like molasses when converting 1.5 cups to ounces (12 oz)."
faqQ2: "Why does my air fryer treacle cake stick to the basket?"
faqA2: "Treacle's sticky nature means proper lining is essential. Always use parchment paper or a silicone liner when baking with 1.5 cups of treacle (12 oz) in the air fryer. Lightly greasing the liner helps release, and allowing cakes to cool slightly before removing prevents tearing. Our air fryer cleaner guide has tips for tackling any stubborn residue."
faqQ3: "How do I measure 1.5 cups of treacle without making a mess?"
faqA3: "Grease your measuring cup with oil first—the treacle will slide out cleanly. For 12 oz (1.5 cups), you can also weigh it directly in a bowl on kitchen scales. Warming the treacle slightly (not hot) makes pouring easier. Always measure over your mixing bowl to catch any drips when converting 1.5 cups treacle to ounces."
faqQ4: "Can I reduce the treacle in air fryer recipes for less sweetness?"
faqA4: "You can slightly reduce the 1.5 cups (12 oz) of treacle, but balance it with other moist ingredients like applesauce or yogurt. Treacle contributes to texture and browning in air fryer baking, so cutting more than 25% may affect results. Our recipe section offers lighter alternatives that still deliver great air fryer outcomes."

<p>1.5 cups of treacle equals approximately 12 ounces (oz). This conversion is essential for accurate baking and cooking, especially when using an air fryer for sticky, sweet treats. Whether you're making gingerbread, flapjacks, or treacle tart, knowing the exact weight ensures consistency in your recipes. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we love helping you nail those measurements for flawless results every time.</p>

<h2>Why accurate treacle measurements matter</h2>  
<p>Treacle is a thick, sticky syrup that can vary in density depending on temperature and brand. Measuring by weight (ounces) rather than volume (cups) eliminates guesswork. This is particularly important in air fryer recipes, where precise ingredient ratios affect texture and cooking time. Too much treacle can make baked goods overly dense, while too little might leave them dry.</p>  

<p>For UK bakers, treacle is a pantry staple in classics like parkin or sticky toffee pudding. If you're adapting traditional recipes for the air fryer, converting 1.5 cups of treacle to ounces (12 oz) ensures authenticity.

<h3>How to measure treacle correctly</h3>  
<p>Use a kitchen scale for the most accurate 1.5 cups treacle to ounces conversion. Lightly grease your measuring cup first—the oil helps the treacle slide out cleanly. For air fryer recipes, slightly warming the treacle makes it easier to mix with other ingredients. Remember, 1.5 cups of treacle in ounces is roughly 12 oz, but always verify with your specific brand.</p>  

<h2>Treacle in air fryer baking</h2>

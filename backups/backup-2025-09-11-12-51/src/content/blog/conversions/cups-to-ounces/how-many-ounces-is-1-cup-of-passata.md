faqQ1: "Can I use tomato puree instead of passata?"
faqA1: "Yes, but you’ll need to adjust quantities. Tomato puree is more concentrated, so use half the amount and dilute with water. For 1 cup passata (8.45 oz), mix ½ cup puree with ½ cup water."
faqQ2: "Does passata weight change if it’s chilled?"
faqA2: "Temperature affects passata’s density slightly, but not enough to alter measurements significantly. 1 cup will still weigh roughly 8.45 ounces whether cold or room temperature. For precision, always measure at the temperature your recipe specifies."
faqQ3: "How long does opened passata last in the fridge?"
faqA3: "Opened passata keeps for 3-5 days refrigerated in an airtight container. For longer storage, freeze it in 1-cup (8.45 oz) portions. Always check for off smells or mould before using."
faqQ4: "Can I measure passata by weight instead of volume?"
faqA4: "Absolutely! Weighing passata is often more accurate. Simply measure 240 grams (8.45 oz) for each cup needed. This method eliminates packing inconsistencies that can occur with cup measurements."

faqQ1: "Can I use bottled lime juice instead of fresh for 0.33 cup measurements?"
faqA1: "Yes, you can use bottled lime juice as a substitute for fresh when measuring 0.33 cup (2.64 ounces). However, fresh lime juice generally provides better flavour. Bottled juice often contains preservatives that can slightly alter the taste of your air fryer dishes. If using bottled, shake well before measuring."
faqQ2: "How many limes do I need for 0.33 cup of juice?"
faqA2: "You'll typically need 2-3 medium limes to get 0.33 cup (2.64 ounces) of juice. Lime size and juiciness vary, so it's best to have extra on hand. Rolling the limes before juicing and using a citrus press will help maximise your yield for air fryer recipes."
faqQ3: "Does the conversion change if my lime juice has pulp?"
faqA3: "The 0.33 cup to 2.64 ounces conversion remains the same whether your lime juice has pulp or not. However, pulp adds minimal extra volume. For most air fryer recipes, strained or unstrained juice works fine unless the recipe specifically calls for one or the other."
faqQ4: "Can I substitute lemon juice for lime juice in the same 0.33 cup quantity?"
faqA4: "Yes, you can substitute lemon juice for lime juice using the same 0.33 cup (2.64 ounces) measurement in air fryer recipes. The flavour profile will be slightly different - lemon is brighter while lime is more floral - but the acidity level is similar enough for most cooking purposes."

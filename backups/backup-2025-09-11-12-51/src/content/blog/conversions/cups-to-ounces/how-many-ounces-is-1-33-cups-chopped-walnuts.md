faqQ1: "Can I use whole walnuts instead of chopped for 1.33 cups?"
faqA1: "Yes, but the weight will differ slightly. Whole walnuts take up more space, so 1.33 cups equals about 4.8 oz (136g). For air fryer recipes, we recommend chopping them first for even cooking and better texture distribution."
faqQ2: "How should I store leftover chopped walnuts after measuring 1.33 cups?"
faqA2: "Transfer unused walnuts to an airtight container and keep them in a cool, dark place. They’ll stay fresh for 2-3 weeks. For longer storage, freeze them in portions—they’ll keep for up to 6 months without losing flavour."
faqQ3: "Do UK and US cup measurements differ for chopped walnuts?"
faqA3: "No, 1.33 cups is the same volume in both systems. However, always use standard measuring cups (not mugs) for accuracy. In weight, 5.3 oz is consistent whether you’re following a UK or US air fryer recipe."
faqQ4: "Why does my air fryer recipe specify ounces instead of cups for walnuts?"
faqA4: "Weight measurements (ounces/grams) are more precise than volume (cups) because chopped walnut density can vary. Air fryers cook best with exact quantities, so if your recipe lists 5.3 oz, it’s worth using scales for perfect results every time."

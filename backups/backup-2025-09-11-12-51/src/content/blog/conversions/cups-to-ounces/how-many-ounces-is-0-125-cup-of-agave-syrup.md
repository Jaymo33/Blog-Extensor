faqQ1: "Can I use honey instead of 0.125 cup of agave syrup in air fryer recipes?"
faqA1: "Yes, you can substitute honey for agave syrup, but adjust the quantity slightly. Since honey is thicker, use about 0.9 ounces (just under 0.125 cup) to match the sweetness of 1 ounce of agave. Reduce cooking temperature by 10°C to prevent over-browning."
faqQ2: "How do I measure 0.125 cup of agave syrup without a measuring cup?"
faqA2: "Use two level tablespoons to measure 0.125 cup of agave syrup, as this equals 1 ounce. For sticky syrups, lightly coat the spoon with oil first for easier pouring. Alternatively, use a shot glass marked in ounces – fill to the 1 oz line."
faqQ3: "Does the type of agave syrup affect the 0.125 cup to ounce conversion?"
faqA3: "Light and dark agave syrups have nearly identical densities, so 0.125 cup equals 1 ounce for both. However, flavoured or infused varieties might differ slightly. When using specialty agave syrups, weighing is more accurate than volume measurements."
faqQ4: "Why is my air fryer recipe too sweet with 0.125 cup of agave syrup?"
faqA4: "Agave syrup is about 1.5 times sweeter than sugar, so recipes may need adjustment. Try reducing to 0.75 ounces (about 1.5 tablespoons) if your dish is overly sweet. The concentrated heat of air frying can also intensify sweetness, so consider lowering the temperature slightly."

faqQ1: "Can I use bottled lime juice instead of fresh for 0.75 cup measurements?"
faqA1: "Yes, bottled lime juice works fine for measuring 0.75 cup (6 fl oz). While fresh lime juice has a brighter flavour, bottled juice offers convenience and consistency. Just ensure it’s 100% lime juice without added sweeteners or preservatives for the best results in air fryer recipes."
faqQ2: "How does lime juice affect cooking times in an air fryer?"
faqA2: "Lime juice itself doesn’t significantly alter air fryer cooking times, but marinades containing it may require slight adjustments. Acidic ingredients like lime juice can slightly speed up the tenderising process, so keep an eye on proteins like chicken or shrimp to avoid overcooking."
faqQ3: "Is 0.75 cup of lime juice the same as 6 ounces by weight?"
faqA3: "No, fluid ounces (volume) and ounces by weight differ. Lime juice weighs roughly 1.04 oz per fluid ounce due to its density, so 6 fl oz is about 6.24 oz by weight. For most recipes, the volume measurement (0.75 cup or 6 fl oz) is sufficient unless specified otherwise."
faqQ4: "What’s the best way to store leftover lime juice after measuring 0.75 cup?"
faqA4: "Store leftover lime juice in an airtight container in the fridge for up to a week. For longer storage, freeze it in ice cube trays—each cube holds about 1 fl oz, making it easy to measure 0.75 cup (6 cubes) next time. Always label with the date to track freshness."

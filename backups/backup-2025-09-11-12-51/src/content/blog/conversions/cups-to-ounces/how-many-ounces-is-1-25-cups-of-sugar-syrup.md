faqQ1: "Can I use a kitchen scale to measure 1.25 cups of sugar syrup in ounces?"
faqA1: "Yes, a kitchen scale is the most accurate way to measure 1.25 cups of sugar syrup in ounces. Simply set your scale to ounces, place a container on it, tare the weight, and pour the syrup until it reaches 10 ounces. This method eliminates measuring cup inconsistencies."
faqQ2: "Does the type of sugar syrup affect the 1.25 cups to ounces conversion?"
faqA2: "Slightly. Standard simple syrup or light corn syrup will weigh about 10 ounces per 1.25 cups. Thicker syrups like molasses or honey may weigh closer to 11 ounces due to higher density. Always check your specific syrup type for precise conversions in air fryer recipes."
faqQ3: "How do I convert 1.25 cups of sugar syrup to grams?"
faqA3: "Since 1 ounce equals approximately 28.35 grams, 10 ounces of sugar syrup (from 1.25 cups) converts to roughly 283.5 grams. For air fryer recipes requiring metric measurements, this gram equivalent ensures accuracy, especially for international recipes."
faqQ4: "Why is my air fryer recipe too sweet with 1.25 cups of sugar syrup?"
faqA4: "If your dish tastes overly sweet, you may have mis-measured the syrup. Ensure you’re using exact 1.25 cups (10 ounces) and not accidentally packing the syrup. Also, consider reducing the quantity slightly or balancing with acidic ingredients like lemon juice in marinades."

<h3>Why measure sugar syrup in ounces?</h3>
<p>Measuring sugar syrup by weight (ounces) is more accurate than using cups, especially for air fryer cooking. Air fryers require precise ingredient ratios to ensure even cooking and perfect texture. A slight imbalance in sugar syrup can affect caramelisation or browning. Ounces provide a consistent measurement, unlike cups, which can vary based on how you pour.

<h2>Converting 1.25 cups of sugar syrup to ounces</h2>
<p>The conversion from cups to ounces depends on the density of the syrup. For most standard sugar syrups, 1 cup equals 8 ounces, so 1.25 cups is 10 ounces. This applies to simple syrups, corn syrup, or golden syrup commonly used in UK recipes. Always check your syrup type, as thicker syrups like molasses may weigh slightly more.

<h3>Tips for measuring sugar syrup in air fryer recipes</h3>

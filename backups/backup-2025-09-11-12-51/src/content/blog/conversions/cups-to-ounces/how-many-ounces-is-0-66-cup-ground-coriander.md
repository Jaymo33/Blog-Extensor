faqQ1: "Can I use whole coriander seeds instead of ground coriander?"
faqA1: "Yes, but you’ll need to adjust the amount. Whole coriander seeds have a more concentrated flavour, so use about half the quantity. For 0.66 cup of ground coriander (2.64 oz), substitute with roughly 1.3 oz of whole seeds, lightly crushed."
faqQ2: "How long does ground coriander last in the pantry?"
faqA2: "Ground coriander stays fresh for about 6–12 months if stored in an airtight container away from light and heat. For the best flavour in your air fryer recipes, replace it annually or whenever the aroma fades."
faqQ3: "Does 0.66 cup of ground coriander weigh the same as other spices?"
faqA3: "No, spice weights vary. For example, 0.66 cup of ground cinnamon weighs closer to 3 oz due to its density. Always check a reliable conversion chart or use a scale for accuracy in air fryer cooking."
faqQ4: "Can I freeze ground coriander to extend its shelf life?"
faqA4: "Freezing isn’t recommended, as moisture can clump the powder. Instead, store it in a cool, dark cupboard. If you buy in bulk, divide into smaller airtight containers to preserve freshness for air fryer recipes."

faqQ1: "Can I use golden syrup instead of treacle in my air fryer recipes?"
faqA1: "Yes, you can substitute golden syrup for treacle, but note that golden syrup is lighter and sweeter. Use the same 0.25 cup (2.5 oz) measurement, but expect a milder flavour. Adjust other sweeteners in your air fryer recipe accordingly."
faqQ2: "How do I clean my air fryer after using treacle?"
faqA2: "Treacle can be sticky, so wipe your air fryer basket with warm, soapy water immediately after use. For stubborn residue, soak the basket in hot water with baking soda. Regular cleaning prevents buildup and maintains your air fryer’s performance."
faqQ3: "Why does my air fryer treacle cake turn out too dark?"
faqA3: "Treacle’s natural dark colour and sugar content can cause over-browning in air fryers. Reduce temperature by 10°C and check doneness early. Lining your basket with parchment paper also helps prevent excessive browning on the bottom."
faqQ4: "Can I freeze leftover treacle for later use in air fryer recipes?"
faqA4: "Absolutely! Portion treacle into 0.25 cup (2.5 oz) amounts in freezer bags for easy use. Thaw at room temperature before incorporating into air fryer recipes. Frozen treacle keeps well for up to 3 months without losing quality."

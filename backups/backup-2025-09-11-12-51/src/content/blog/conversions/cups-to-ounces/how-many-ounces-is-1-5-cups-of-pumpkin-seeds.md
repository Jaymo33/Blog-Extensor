<p>1.5 cups of pumpkin seeds equals approximately 6 ounces (170 grams) when measured for UK recipes. This conversion is essential for air fryer cooking, where precise measurements can make or break a dish. Whether you're roasting them as a snack or using them in a recipe, knowing the exact weight ensures consistent results every time.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter for Pumpkin Seeds</h2>  
<p>When working with pumpkin seeds in an air fryer, accuracy is key. Too many seeds can overcrowd the basket, leading to uneven cooking, while too few might burn quickly. A standard UK cup holds about 4 ounces of pumpkin seeds, so 1.5 cups translates to roughly 6 ounces. This measurement is particularly useful for recipes like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>spiced pumpkin seed snacks</a> or as a topping for salads and soups.</p>  

<p>Using a kitchen scale is the most reliable method, but if you don’t have one, measuring cups will do. Just remember that pumpkin seeds can settle, so fluff them up before scooping.

<h3>Converting Cups to Ounces for Different Ingredients</h3>  
<p>Not all ingredients weigh the same per cup. While 1.5 cups of pumpkin seeds equal 6 ounces, other nuts or seeds might differ. For example, almonds are denser, so 1.5 cups would weigh closer to 7 ounces. Always double-check conversions for the best air fryer results.</p>  

<h2>How to Use Pumpkin Seeds in Your Air Fryer</h2>  
<p>Pumpkin seeds are a versatile ingredient that works brilliantly in an air fryer. Toss 1.5 cups (6 ounces) with a bit of oil, salt, and your favourite spices, then air fry at 160°C for 8–10 minutes. They’ll come out perfectly crispy every time. Try adding them to <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/salads>salads</a> or as a crunchy garnish for soups.</p>  

<p>If you’re meal prepping, roasted pumpkin seeds make a great high-protein snack. Store them in an airtight container, and they’ll stay fresh for weeks.

<h3>Common Mistakes When Measuring Pumpkin Seeds</h3>  
<p>One of the biggest mistakes is packing the seeds into the cup, which leads to an inaccurate weight. Instead, lightly spoon them in and level off the top. Also, avoid using liquid measuring cups, as they’re not designed for dry ingredients like pumpkin seeds.</p>  

<h2>Scaling Recipes with Pumpkin Seeds</h2>  
<p>If a recipe calls for 1.5 cups of pumpkin seeds (6 ounces) but you need to adjust the quantity, simply scale the weight proportionally. For example, 3 cups would be 12 ounces, while 0.75 cups would be 3 ounces. This flexibility is handy for batch cooking or smaller servings.</p>

<h3>Buying Pumpkin Seeds in Bulk</h3>  
<p>Purchasing pumpkin seeds in bulk is cost-effective, but storing them properly is crucial. Keep them in a cool, dark place to maintain freshness. If you’re unsure about quantities, remember that 1.5 cups equals 6 ounces, making it easy to portion out for recipes.</p>

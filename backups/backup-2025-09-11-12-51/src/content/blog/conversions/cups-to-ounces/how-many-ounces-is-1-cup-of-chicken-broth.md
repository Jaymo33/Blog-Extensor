faqQ1: "Does the type of chicken broth affect the ounce measurement?"
faqA1: "No, the type of chicken broth doesn't change the measurement. Whether you use homemade, canned, or powdered broth reconstituted with water, 1 cup will always equal approximately 8 ounces. The flavour intensity may vary, but the liquid volume remains consistent for air fryer recipes."
faqQ2: "Can I use chicken stock instead of broth in the same measurement?"
faqA2: "Yes, you can substitute chicken stock for broth using the same 1 cup to 8 ounces ratio. While stocks are typically richer due to longer cooking times with bones, the liquid measurement remains identical. This makes swapping them in air fryer recipes simple without adjusting quantities."
faqQ3: "How do I measure 1 cup of chicken broth without a measuring cup?"
faqA3: "If you don't have a measuring cup, you can use standard kitchen items for approximation. A UK mug typically holds about 300ml (just over 1 cup), while a teacup holds about 150ml (just under 2/3 cup). For precise air fryer cooking, we recommend investing in proper measuring tools for best results."
faqQ4: "Why does my air fryer recipe specify weight instead of volume for chicken broth?"
faqA4: "Some air fryer recipes specify weight (ounces) rather than volume (cups) for greater accuracy, especially in baked goods or precise sauces. While 1 cup equals about 8 ounces, weighing eliminates variables like bubbles or meniscus errors. Follow the recipe's preferred method for optimal outcomes."

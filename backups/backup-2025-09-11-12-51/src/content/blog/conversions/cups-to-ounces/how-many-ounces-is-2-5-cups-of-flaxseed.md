faqQ1: "Can I use ground flaxseed instead of whole for the 2.5 cups to ounces conversion?"
faqA1: "Yes, you can use ground flaxseed, but the weight may vary slightly. While 2.5 cups of whole flaxseed equals about 10.5 ounces, ground flaxseed might be slightly denser. It's best to weigh it for accuracy, especially in air fryer recipes where texture matters."
faqQ2: "How does the UK ounce measurement compare for 2.5 cups of flaxseed?"
faqA2: "The UK uses the same ounce measurement for dry ingredients like flaxseed. So 2.5 cups of flaxseed is still approximately 10.5 ounces in UK measurements. This makes converting 2.5 cups of flaxseed to oz UK straightforward for air fryer cooking."
faqQ3: "Why is my flaxseed measurement different when packed vs loose?"
faqA3: "Flaxseed is lightweight and can compress, so packed 2.5 cups will weigh more than loosely measured cups. For consistent results in air fryer recipes, always measure flaxseed the same way - either lightly spooned or gently packed."
faqQ4: "Can I substitute flaxseed with another ingredient in air fryer recipes?"
faqA4: "While flaxseed has unique properties, you can substitute it with almond flour or breadcrumbs in some recipes. However, the 2.5 cups to ounces conversion won't apply to these substitutes as they have different densities. Always check specific conversions for alternative ingredients."

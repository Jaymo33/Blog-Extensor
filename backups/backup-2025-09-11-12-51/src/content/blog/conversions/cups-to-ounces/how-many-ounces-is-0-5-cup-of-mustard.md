<h2>Why accurate mustard measurements matter</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of mustard can elevate your air fryer dishes, from crispy chicken wings to flavourful roasted vegetables. Too little, and your dish might lack depth; too much, and it could overpower other ingredients. Mustard’s tangy profile works wonders in marinades, dressings, and glazes, so getting the measurement spot-on is key.

<p>Mustard’s density can vary slightly depending on the type—yellow, Dijon, or whole grain—but 0.5 cup generally weighs around 4.5 ounces. For best results, use a kitchen scale if precision is crucial. This is especially helpful for recipes like honey-mustard salmon or mustard-crusted pork chops, where balance is everything.</p>  

<h3>Types of mustard and their weights</h3>  
<p>Yellow mustard, the most common variety, is slightly denser than Dijon or whole grain mustard. This means 0.5 cup of yellow mustard might weigh closer to 4.6 ounces, while Dijon could be around 4.4 ounces. These small differences won’t ruin a dish, but they’re worth noting for perfectionists.

<h2>How to measure mustard without a scale</h2>  
<p>If you don’t have a kitchen scale, use measuring cups for liquid or semi-liquid ingredients like mustard. Fill the cup to the brim and level it off with a straight edge for accuracy. Remember, 0.5 cup of mustard is equivalent to 8 tablespoons or 24 teaspoons. This method works well for most air fryer recipes, such as mustard-glazed sausages or crispy tofu.</p>  

<p>For sticky ingredients like mustard, lightly greasing the measuring cup can help it slide out easily. Alternatively, use a silicone spatula to scrape every last bit into your mixing bowl. Waste not, want not—especially when crafting the perfect sauce for your air fryer creations. Need cleaning tips?

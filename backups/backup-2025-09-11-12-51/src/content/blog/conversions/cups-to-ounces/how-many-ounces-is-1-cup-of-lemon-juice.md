faqQ1: "Is 1 cup of lemon juice the same as 8 ounces?"
faqA1: "No, 1 cup of lemon juice is approximately 8.45 ounces by weight. While a US cup measures 8 fluid ounces, lemon juice's density makes it slightly heavier. For air fryer recipes, this small difference can impact texture and flavour, so precise measurements matter."
faqQ2: "Can I use bottled lemon juice instead of fresh in air fryer recipes?"
faqA2: "Yes, but unsweetened bottled lemon juice works best to match fresh juice's acidity. Sweetened varieties can alter your recipe's balance. For marinades or dressings, fresh lemon juice often delivers brighter flavour, but bottled is convenient for quick meals."
faqQ3: "How do I convert 1 cup of lemon juice to grams?"
faqA3: "1 cup of lemon juice (8.45 oz) equals about 240 grams. This conversion is handy for UK cooks using metric scales. Since air fryer recipes often need precision, weighing ingredients ensures consistent results, especially for baked goods or glazes."
faqQ4: "Why does lemon juice measurement matter in air fryer cooking?"
faqA4: "Lemon juice affects moisture and acidity, which influence browning and texture in air fryers. Too much can make food soggy, while too little might not tenderise or flavour adequately. Precise measurements, like 8.45 oz per cup, help achieve perfect results every time."

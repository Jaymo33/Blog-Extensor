faqQ1: "Can I use bottled lemon juice instead of fresh for 1.5 cups?"
faqA1: "Yes, you can use bottled lemon juice as a substitute for fresh lemon juice. However, fresh lemon juice often has a brighter, more vibrant flavour. If using bottled, check for additives like preservatives, which might alter the taste of your dish."
faqQ2: "How many lemons do I need for 1.5 cups of juice?"
faqA2: "On average, one medium lemon yields about 2-3 tablespoons of juice. For 1.5 cups (24 tablespoons), you'll need roughly 8-12 lemons, depending on their size and juiciness. Rolling lemons before juicing can help extract more liquid."
faqQ3: "Does the conversion change if the lemon juice is concentrated?"
faqA3: "Yes, concentrated lemon juice is more potent, so you'll need less. Typically, you'd dilute it with water according to the bottle's instructions. For 1.5 cups of diluted juice, check the concentration ratio to adjust the amount accordingly."
faqQ4: "Can I substitute lime juice for lemon juice in the same amount?"
faqA4: "Lime juice can be substituted for lemon juice, but keep in mind it has a slightly different flavour profile. Use the same 1.5 cups (12 ounces) measurement, but taste as you go, as lime can be more tart or aromatic depending on the variety."

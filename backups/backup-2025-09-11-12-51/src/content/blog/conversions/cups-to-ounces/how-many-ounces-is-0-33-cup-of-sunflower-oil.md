faqQ1: "Can I use other oils instead of sunflower oil in my air fryer?"
faqA1: "Yes, you can use other high smoke point oils like canola, avocado, or peanut oil in your air fryer. Just remember that 0.33 cup of these oils will also equal approximately 2.64 ounces. The conversion remains the same regardless of oil type."
faqQ2: "Why is measuring oil by weight more accurate than volume?"
faqA2: "Measuring by weight (ounces) is more precise because oil density can vary slightly with temperature. A 0.33 cup measure might hold slightly different amounts depending on how you pour, but 2.64 ounces will always be exact. This accuracy is especially important in air frying where oil quantity affects cooking results."
faqQ3: "How do I measure 0.33 cup without special measuring tools?"
faqA3: "If you don't have a 1/3 cup measure, you can use tablespoons - 0.33 cup equals about 5 tablespoons plus 1 teaspoon. Alternatively, use a digital kitchen scale to measure out 2.64 ounces directly. This method often proves more accurate for air fryer recipes."
faqQ4: "Does the type of sunflower oil affect the conversion?"
faqA4: "The conversion from 0.33 cup to 2.64 ounces applies to all standard sunflower oils. Whether refined or cold-pressed, the density difference is negligible for cooking purposes. However, flavoured or infused sunflower oils might vary slightly due to added ingredients."

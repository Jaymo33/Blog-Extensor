faqQ1: "Is 0.375 cup of almond milk the same as 3/8 cup?"
faqA1: "Yes, 0.375 cup is exactly the same as 3/8 cup. This measurement equals 3 fluid ounces of almond milk. It's a common quantity in many air fryer recipes, especially for batters and sauces where precision matters."
faqQ2: "Can I use a regular cup to measure 0.375 cup of almond milk?"
faqA2: "While you can use a standard drinking cup in a pinch, it's best to use proper measuring cups for accuracy. Look for a liquid measuring cup with clear 0.375 cup markings, or measure halfway between 1/4 and 1/2 cup. For perfect air fryer results, weighing 3 ounces is most precise."

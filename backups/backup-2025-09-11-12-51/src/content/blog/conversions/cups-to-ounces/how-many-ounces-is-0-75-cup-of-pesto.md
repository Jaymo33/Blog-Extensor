faqQ1: "Can I use 0.75 cup of pesto straight from the jar for air frying?"
faqA1: "Yes, you can use 0.75 cup (6 ounces) of jarred pesto directly, but stir it first to redistribute the oil. For air frying, lightly brush or toss ingredients with pesto to prevent excess drips. Homemade pesto may need a bit more oil if it’s too thick."
faqQ2: "How does 0.75 cup of pesto compare to grams for UK cooks?"
faqA2: "0.75 cup of pesto equals 6 ounces or approximately 170 grams. UK cooks can use a kitchen scale for precision, especially when adapting recipes from American measurements. Grams are often more reliable for dense ingredients like pesto."
faqQ3: "What’s the best way to store leftover pesto after measuring 0.75 cup?"
faqA3: "Transfer unused pesto to an airtight container, covering the surface with a thin layer of olive oil to prevent browning. Store in the fridge for up to a week, or freeze in ice cube trays for longer shelf life."
faqQ4: "Does the type of pesto affect the 0.75 cup to ounces conversion?"
faqA4: "Traditional basil pesto and thicker varieties (like sun-dried tomato) will weigh roughly the same—6 ounces per 0.75 cup. Lighter versions (such as kale pesto) might be slightly less dense, but the difference is minimal for most recipes."

faqQ1: "Can I use black treacle instead of molasses in air fryer recipes?"
faqA1: "Yes, black treacle is a close substitute for molasses and can be used in a 1:1 ratio. Both have a rich, bittersweet flavour, though treacle is slightly lighter. Adjust other sweeteners if needed, as treacle can be less intense."
faqQ2: "Why does my air fryer recipe taste too bitter with molasses?"
faqA2: "Bitterness usually means too much molasses was used. Remember, 2 cups equal 24 ounces—exceeding this can overpower other flavours. Balance it with spices or a touch of honey to mellow the taste."
faqQ3: "How do I measure molasses without a scale?"
faqA3: "Use a liquid measuring cup and lightly grease it first for easy pouring. For 2 cups (24 ounces), fill to the 16-ounce mark twice, scraping the cup clean each time to ensure accuracy."
faqQ4: "Can I reduce the molasses in a recipe for less sweetness?"
faqA4: "Yes, but reduce other liquids slightly to maintain texture. For example, if using 1 cup (12 ounces) instead of 2, add a tablespoon less water or oil. The air fryer’s heat will still caramelise it nicely."

Whether you’re baking gingerbread or glazing meats, knowing how many ounces are in 2 cups of molasses ensures consistency and delicious results.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Using the correct amount of molasses is crucial for air fryer recipes, as too much can make dishes overly sticky or sweet, while too little can leave them bland. Molasses adds depth to marinades, glazes, and baked goods, so getting the conversion right matters. For example, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer ginger cookies</a> rely on the perfect balance of molasses for that rich, spiced flavour.</p>  

<p>Air fryers cook food quickly and evenly, but they also amplify flavours, meaning precise measurements are key. If you’re adapting a traditional recipe for your air fryer, converting cups to ounces ensures you don’t end up with a soggy or burnt result.

<h3>How to Measure Molasses Correctly</h3>  
<p>Measuring molasses can be tricky due to its thick, sticky consistency. To get an accurate 2-cup measurement, lightly grease your measuring cup with oil first—this helps the molasses slide out easily. Alternatively, use a kitchen scale for the most precise 24-ounce measurement. This method is especially useful for <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>air fryer desserts</a> where texture is everything.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for Molasses in Air Fryer Recipes</h2>  
<p>Molasses is a versatile ingredient that works wonders in both sweet and savoury air fryer dishes. From sticky ribs to spiced cakes, its rich flavour enhances many recipes. For instance, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>molasses-glazed chicken</a> relies on the 2-cups-to-ounces conversion for the perfect caramelised finish.</p>  

<p>You can also use molasses in marinades for meats or as a sweetener in air-fried baked goods. Since air fryers circulate hot air rapidly, molasses-based glazes caramelise beautifully without burning. Just remember: 2 cups of molasses equals 24 ounces, so adjust other ingredients accordingly for balanced flavours.</p>  

<h3>Converting Other Molasses Measurements</h3>  
<p>If your recipe calls for a different amount of molasses, here’s a quick reference: 1 cup = 12 ounces, ½ cup = 6 ounces, and ¼ cup = 3 ounces.

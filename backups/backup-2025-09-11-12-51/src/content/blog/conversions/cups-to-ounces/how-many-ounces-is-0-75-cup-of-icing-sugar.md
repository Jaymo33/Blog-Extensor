faqQ1: "Can I use granulated sugar instead of icing sugar for 0.75 cup in air fryer recipes?"
faqA1: "No, granulated sugar won’t work the same way as icing sugar in most air fryer recipes. Icing sugar is finely ground, which affects texture and dissolve rate. If you must substitute, blend granulated sugar into a powder first, but weighing 3 ounces (0.75 cup equivalent) is still best."
faqQ2: "How do I measure 0.75 cup of icing sugar without a measuring cup?"
faqA2: "If you don’t have a measuring cup, use a kitchen scale to weigh out 3 ounces of icing sugar. Alternatively, a standard UK tablespoon holds about 0.5 oz, so you’d need 6 level tablespoons to approximate 0.75 cup. For precision, we recommend investing in measuring tools."
faqQ3: "Does 0.75 cup of icing sugar weigh the same as 0.75 cup of flour in an air fryer recipe?"
faqA3: "No, flour and icing sugar have different densities. While 0.75 cup of icing sugar is 3 ounces, the same volume of flour weighs closer to 3.5 ounces. Always check weight conversions for each ingredient to ensure accuracy in air fryer baking."
faqQ4: "Why does my air fryer recipe call for 0.75 cup of icing sugar instead of a full cup?"
faqA4: "Recipes often use 0.75 cup (3 oz) of icing sugar to balance sweetness without overpowering other flavours. In air fryers, precise sugar amounts also affect browning and texture. Adjusting slightly, as in 0.75 cup, can lead to better results than rounding to a full cup."

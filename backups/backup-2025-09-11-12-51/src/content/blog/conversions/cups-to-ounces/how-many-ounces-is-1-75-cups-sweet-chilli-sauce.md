<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>
<p>Air fryers rely on even heat distribution, and incorrect ingredient quantities can throw off cooking times and textures. Sweet chilli sauce, with its sticky consistency, needs precise measurement to avoid overly soggy or dry results. For example, marinating chicken with too much sauce can lead to excess dripping, while too little might leave the dish bland. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> simplifies these calculations, so you never have to guess.</p>
<p>Many UK recipes use metric measurements, but some still reference cups, especially for sauces. Converting 1.75 cups of sweet chilli sauce to ounces (14 oz) ensures you stay on track.

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of almond milk can affect texture, moisture, and overall taste. Air fryers cook food quickly, so even small measurement errors can lead to dry or overly soggy results. For example, if a recipe calls for 1.75 cups of almond milk (14 oz), adding too much could make your dish watery. Too little might leave it dry. Always measure liquids carefully for the best outcome.</p>  

<p>Many air fryer recipes, like cakes or batters, rely on precise liquid ratios. Almond milk is a popular dairy-free alternative, but its consistency differs slightly from cow's milk. That's why converting 1.75 cups of almond milk to ounces (14 oz) ensures you stay on track.

Remember, UK and US cup sizes differ slightly, so stick to one system for consistency.</p>

faqQ1: "Is 3 cups of margarine the same as 24 ounces in the UK?"
faqA1: "Yes, 3 cups of margarine equals 24 ounces in both UK and US measurements. The conversion remains consistent, making it easy to follow recipes from either region. Always double-check if your margarine packaging lists weight in grams for additional precision."
faqQ2: "Can I use butter instead of margarine in air fryer recipes?"
faqA2: "Yes, butter can substitute margarine in most air fryer recipes, but keep in mind it has a higher fat content. Use the same 3 cups to ounces conversion (24 ounces), but expect a richer flavour. Adjust cooking times slightly, as butter may brown faster in the air fryer."
faqQ3: "How do I measure 3 cups of melted margarine in ounces?"
faqA3: "Melted margarine should still be measured by volume (3 cups) or weight (24 ounces) for accuracy. Pour it into a liquid measuring cup for volume or weigh it on a kitchen scale. Avoid guessing, as melted margarine can settle unevenly."
faqQ4: "Why does my air fryer recipe need exact margarine measurements?"
faqA4: "Air fryers rely on precise heat distribution, so too much or too little margarine can affect texture and cooking time. Exact measurements like 3 cups (24 ounces) ensure even browning and prevent greasiness. Consistency is key for perfect results every time."

<h3>How to measure margarine for air fryer recipes</h3>  
<p>Measuring margarine accurately is simple if you use the right tools. If your recipe calls for 3 cups of margarine (24 ounces), a kitchen scale is the most reliable method. However, if you don’t have one, use the markings on the margarine packaging—most blocks are pre-measured in ounces or grams. For softer spreads, spoon the margarine into a measuring cup and level it off with a knife. This ensures you get the exact 3 cups of margarine to ounces conversion needed for your dish.</p>

<h3>Tips for storing margarine for air fryer recipes</h3>

faqQ1: "Can I use margarine instead of butter for 0.33 cup measurements in air fryer recipes?"
faqA1: "Yes, you can substitute margarine for butter in most air fryer recipes. However, keep in mind that margarine has a higher water content, which might affect texture. For baking, butter is usually preferred for its richer flavour."
faqQ2: "How do I measure 0.33 cup of butter if I don’t have a scale?"
faqA2: "If you don’t have a scale, you can use the markings on a standard butter wrapper. One stick of butter is 1/2 cup (4 ounces), so 0.33 cup is roughly two-thirds of a stick. Alternatively, use a measuring cup and pack the butter firmly."
faqQ3: "Does the type of butter (salted vs. unsalted) affect the ounce measurement for 0.33 cup?"
faqA3: "No, the ounce measurement remains the same whether you use salted or unsalted butter. However, salted butter may alter the taste of your dish, so adjust seasoning accordingly."
faqQ4: "Why do some air fryer recipes specify butter in ounces rather than cups?"
faqA4: "Ounces provide a more precise measurement, especially for baking. Cups can vary based on how the butter is packed, whereas weight (ounces) is consistent. This precision helps ensure your air fryer recipes turn out perfectly every time."

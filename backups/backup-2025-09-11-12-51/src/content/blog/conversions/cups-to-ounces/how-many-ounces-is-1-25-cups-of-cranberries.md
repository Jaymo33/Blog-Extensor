<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Precision is key when using an air fryer, as cooking times and temperatures rely on ingredient quantities. Too many cranberries can overcrowd the basket, leading to uneven cooking. Too few might dry out or burn before achieving the desired texture. Measuring by weight (ounces) is often more accurate than volume (cups) for ingredients like cranberries. This ensures your dishes turn out perfectly every time. Visit <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> for more tips on perfecting air fryer meals.</p>

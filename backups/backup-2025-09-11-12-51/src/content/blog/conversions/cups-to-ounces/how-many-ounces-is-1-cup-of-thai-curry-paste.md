faqQ1: "Can I use Thai curry paste straight from the jar in my air fryer?"
faqA1: "Yes, you can use Thai curry paste directly from the jar, but it’s often better to mix it with oil or liquid for even distribution. This prevents clumping and ensures your food cooks evenly. For marinades, dilute the paste slightly for better absorption."
faqQ2: "How do I adjust the spiciness when using Thai curry paste?"
faqA2: "To reduce spiciness, mix the paste with coconut milk, yogurt, or broth before applying it to your food. Start with half the amount (4 ounces per cup) and adjust to taste. Remember, you can always add more but can’t take it away."
faqQ3: "Does the brand of Thai curry paste affect the weight per cup?"
faqA3: "Different brands may vary slightly in density, but 1 cup generally weighs around 8 ounces. Always check the label for specific recommendations. For precision, use a kitchen scale to measure the exact amount needed."
faqQ4: "Can I freeze Thai curry paste for later use?"
faqA4: "Absolutely! Freezing Thai curry paste in small portions (like ice cubes) preserves its flavour. Each cube holds about 1 ounce, making it easy to thaw only what you need. This method keeps the paste fresh for up to 3 months."

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter</h2>  
<p>Using the correct amount of Thai curry paste ensures your dish isn’t too spicy or bland. A cup of Thai curry paste weighs around 8 ounces, but density can vary slightly. For air fryer recipes, precise measurements help avoid overpowering flavours. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for other common ingredient conversions. Accurate measurements also make it easier to scale recipes up or down.</p>  

<p>Thai curry paste is a concentrated ingredient, so even small variations can affect taste. If you’re new to air frying, start with slightly less paste and adjust to taste. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipes section</a> includes tested measurements for perfect results every time. Remember, 1 cup equals 8 ounces, but always taste as you go. This approach ensures your dishes are flavourful without being overwhelming.</p>  

<h3>How to measure Thai curry paste correctly</h3>  
<p>Use a liquid measuring cup for sticky ingredients like Thai curry paste. Lightly grease the cup to help the paste slide out easily. For smaller amounts, a kitchen scale is ideal—just set it to ounces for precision. If you don’t have a scale, spoon the paste into the cup and level it off. This method ensures you get the full 8 ounces per cup.</p>  

<h2>Using Thai curry paste in air fryer recipes</h2>  
<p>Thai curry paste adds depth to air-fried meats, vegetables, and even tofu. Marinate chicken or shrimp with 1 cup (8 ounces) of paste for bold flavours. For lighter dishes, dilute the paste with coconut milk or broth. Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipes</a> for inspiration. The air fryer’s high heat helps caramelise the paste, enhancing its aroma.</p>  

<p>Curry paste also works well as a glaze for roasted vegetables. Toss veggies with 1-2 tablespoons (0.5-1 ounce) of paste before air frying. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable recipes</a> for more ideas. Always clean your air fryer basket after using sticky ingredients—our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning guide</a> makes it easy. With 1 cup (8 ounces) of paste, you can create multiple flavourful meals.</p>  

<h3>Storing leftover Thai curry paste</h3>  
<p>Transfer unused paste to an airtight container and refrigerate. It stays fresh for up to a month, so you can use it in future recipes. Freeze small portions in ice cube trays for easy measuring. Each cube holds about 1 ounce, making it simple to defrost the exact amount needed. This method saves time and reduces waste.</p>

faqQ1: "Can I use olive oil instead of vegetable oil for 1.25 cups in an air fryer?"
faqA1: "Yes, you can substitute olive oil, but note that it has a lower smoke point. For 1.25 cups (10 ounces), use light olive oil for high-heat air frying. Extra virgin olive oil is better for low-temperature recipes."
faqQ2: "How do I measure 1.25 cups of vegetable oil without a measuring cup?"
faqA2: "If you don’t have a measuring cup, use a kitchen scale. 1.25 cups of vegetable oil weighs 10 ounces. Alternatively, a standard UK mug holds roughly 1 cup, so fill it slightly more than halfway for 1.25 cups."
faqQ3: "Does the type of vegetable oil affect the ounce measurement?"
faqA3: "No, all vegetable oils (sunflower, canola, etc.) have similar densities. 1.25 cups will always be approximately 10 ounces, regardless of the oil type. However, flavoured oils may vary slightly."
faqQ4: "Can I reduce the oil amount in air fryer recipes for healthier cooking?"
faqA4: "Absolutely! Air fryers require less oil than traditional frying. For 1.25 cups (10 ounces), try reducing to 0.75 cups (6 ounces) and use a spray bottle for even coating. This cuts calories without sacrificing crispiness."

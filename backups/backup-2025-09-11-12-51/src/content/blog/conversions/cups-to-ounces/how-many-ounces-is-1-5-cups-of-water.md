<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>
<p>Air fryers rely on precise cooking times and temperatures, and liquid measurements are no exception. Using the correct amount of water—like knowing that 1.5 cups equals 12 ounces—can affect texture, cooking time, and even safety. Too much water can lead to soggy results, while too little might cause food to dry out. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> is a handy tool for these situations, helping you avoid guesswork.</p>
<p>Many air fryer recipes, especially those for steamed dishes or sauces, require specific water measurements.

<h2>Converting 1.5 cups of water to ounces</h2>
<p>The conversion from cups to ounces is simple: 1 cup of water equals 8 ounces, so 1.5 cups of water is 12 ounces. This applies to both US and UK measurements, though it’s worth noting that UK cups are slightly larger (284ml vs. 240ml). However, for water, the weight in ounces remains consistent because water’s density is uniform. This makes it easy to measure liquids for air fryer cooking without needing complex calculations.</p>
<p>If you’re working with other liquids like oil or milk, their densities vary, so the weight in ounces might differ slightly. But for water, 1.5 cups will always be 12 ounces. This reliability is why many air fryer recipes, especially those for steaming or boiling, use water as a base.

Accuracy is crucial, especially when preparing air fryer recipes where liquid quantities affect cooking time and texture.</p>

<h3>Common uses for 1.5 cups of water in air fryer cooking</h3>

faqQ1: "Can I use double cream instead of single cream in my air fryer recipe?"
faqA1: "Yes, but double cream has a higher fat content, which can affect the texture of your dish. If substituting, use slightly less double cream to avoid overpowering richness. Adjust cooking times if needed, as double cream may brown faster in the air fryer."
faqQ2: "How do I measure 0.5 cup of single cream without a scale?"
faqA2: "Use a liquid measuring cup for accuracy. Fill it to the 0.5 cup mark, ensuring the cream is level with the measurement line. For smaller amounts, tablespoons can helpâ€”0.5 cup equals 8 tablespoons."
faqQ3: "Does single cream thicken when heated in the air fryer?"
faqA3: "Single cream will thicken slightly when heated, but not as much as double cream. For thicker sauces, consider reducing the cream on the stove first or adding a small amount of cornflour."
faqQ4: "Can I freeze single cream for later use in air fryer recipes?"
faqA4: "Yes, but freezing may alter its texture. Thawed single cream is best used in cooked dishes rather than fresh applications. Stir well before using to recombine any separated liquids."

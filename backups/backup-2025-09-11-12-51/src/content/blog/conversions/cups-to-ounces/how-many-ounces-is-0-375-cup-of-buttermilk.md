faqQ1: "Can I use milk instead of buttermilk for 0.375 cup measurements?"
faqA1: "Yes, but add 1 teaspoon of lemon juice or vinegar per 0.375 cup (3 ounces) of milk to mimic buttermilk’s acidity. Let it sit for 5 minutes before using. This works well in air fryer recipes where buttermilk’s tang is key."
faqQ2: "How does 0.375 cup of buttermilk affect air fryer cooking times?"
faqA2: "Buttermilk can slightly increase cooking times due to its moisture content. For 0.375 cup (3 ounces) in coatings or marinades, add 1-2 extra minutes. Always check food with a thermometer for doneness."
faqQ3: "Is 0.375 cup of buttermilk the same as 3 fluid ounces?"
faqA3: "Yes, 0.375 cup equals 3 fluid ounces by volume. However, for weight measurements, buttermilk’s density means 3 fluid ounces weighs roughly 3.1 ounces. In most recipes, this small difference won’t matter."
faqQ4: "Can I freeze leftover buttermilk after measuring 0.375 cup?"
faqA4: "Absolutely! Freeze buttermilk in 0.375 cup (3-ounce) portions for future air fryer recipes. Thaw in the fridge overnight and shake well before using. It may separate slightly but still works perfectly."

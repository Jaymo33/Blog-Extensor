faqQ1: "Is rapeseed oil the same as canola oil?"
faqA1: "Yes, rapeseed oil and canola oil are essentially the same product. Canola oil is a specific type of rapeseed oil that's been bred to have lower levels of erucic acid, making it more suitable for cooking. Both have similar properties and can be used interchangeably in recipes, including air fryer cooking."
faqQ2: "Can I use olive oil instead of rapeseed oil in my air fryer?"
faqA2: "While you can use olive oil, rapeseed oil is generally better for air frying due to its higher smoke point. Olive oil (especially extra virgin) has a lower smoke point and may start to burn at typical air fryer temperatures. For best results, stick with rapeseed oil when possible, or use light olive oil if that's all you have available."
faqQ3: "How should I store rapeseed oil for air frying?"
faqA3: "Rapeseed oil should be stored in a cool, dark place away from direct sunlight. While it doesn't need refrigeration, keeping it in a cupboard or pantry will help maintain its quality. Always check for any off smells before use, as rancid oil can affect both flavor and health benefits."
faqQ4: "Why is my air fryer smoking when using rapeseed oil?"
faqA4: "If your air fryer is smoking with rapeseed oil, it's likely because the temperature is too high or you've used too much oil. Rapeseed oil has a high smoke point (around 230°C), but exceeding this or having oil drip onto heating elements can cause smoke. Try reducing the temperature slightly and ensure you're using just enough oil to lightly coat your food."

faqQ1: "Why is weight measurement better than cups for flour?"
faqA1: "Weight measurements (like ounces) are more precise because flour can settle or become packed in cups, varying the actual amount. 1.66 cups of plain flour to ounces gives you an exact 7.3 oz measurement, eliminating guesswork for perfect air fryer baking results every time."
faqQ2: "Can I use this conversion for self-raising flour?"
faqA2: "No, self-raising flour has added raising agents that affect its density. While 1.66 cups of plain flour equals 7.3 ounces, self-raising flour would weigh slightly less due to aeration. Always check specific conversions for different flour types."
faqQ3: "How does humidity affect flour measurements?"
faqA3: "Humidity can cause flour to compact or absorb moisture, changing its weight. In damp conditions, 1.66 cups of plain flour might weigh more than 7.3 ounces. For absolute precision in air fryer recipes, weigh your flour rather than relying solely on cup measurements."
faqQ4: "What's the best way to measure flour without scales?"
faqA4: "If you don't have scales, fluff the flour with a fork before gently spooning it into a measuring cup. Level it off with a knife - don't tap or pack it down. Remember 1.66 cups equals about 7.3 ounces, but this method may have slight variations compared to weighing."

<h2>How to Measure Lemon Juice for Air Fryer Recipes</h2>  
<p>Measuring lemon juice correctly starts with using the right tools. A liquid measuring cup is ideal for accuracy, as it accounts for the liquid’s meniscus. If your recipe calls for 1.66 cups of lemon juice, fill the measuring cup to the 1 and 2/3 mark. For smaller quantities, a kitchen scale can help—13.28 ounces is roughly 376 grams.

<p>If you don’t have a measuring cup, you can use tablespoons as a substitute. There are 16 tablespoons in a cup, so 1.66 cups of lemon juice would be about 26.56 tablespoons. While this method works in a pinch, it’s less precise than using a liquid measure. For consistent results in your air fryer, stick to standardised tools. And don’t forget to clean your air fryer basket after cooking acidic dishes—our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning guide</a> makes it easy.</p>

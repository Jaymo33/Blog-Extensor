faqQ1: "Can I use butter instead of margarine for 0.25 cup measurements?"
faqA1: "Yes, butter can be used as a direct substitute for margarine in the same 0.25 cup (2 ounces) measurement. The texture and flavour will be slightly richer, but it works well in most air fryer recipes."
faqQ2: "How do I measure 0.25 cup of margarine without a measuring cup?"
faqA2: "If you don’t have a measuring cup, use a kitchen scale to weigh out 2 ounces of margarine. Alternatively, half a standard stick of margarine (4 tablespoons) equals 0.25 cup."
faqQ3: "Does margarine behave differently in an air fryer compared to butter?"
faqA3: "Margarine and butter perform similarly in air fryer recipes, though butter has a lower water content, which can affect crispiness. Margarine may brown slightly faster due to its oil composition."
faqQ4: "Can I reduce the amount of margarine in air fryer recipes for healthier cooking?"
faqA4: "Yes, you can often reduce margarine by up to half in many recipes, though texture may change. For healthier alternatives, try using spray oils or applesauce in baking recipes."

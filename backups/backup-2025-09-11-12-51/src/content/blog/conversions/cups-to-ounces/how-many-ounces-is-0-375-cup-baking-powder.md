faqQ1: "Can I use a tablespoon to measure 0.375 cup of baking powder?"
faqA1: "Yes, but it’s less precise. 0.375 cup equals 6 tablespoons, so you could measure it out that way. For best results, especially in air fryer baking, a kitchen scale or dedicated measuring cups are recommended."
faqQ2: "Does the type of baking powder affect the weight of 0.375 cup?"
faqA2: "Most standard baking powders weigh similarly, but double-acting varieties might have slight differences. Always check the packaging for specific weight guidelines if precision is crucial for your recipe."
faqQ3: "How do I store baking powder to keep it fresh for accurate measurements?"
faqA3: "Store baking powder in a cool, dry place, tightly sealed. Moisture can cause clumping and affect both weight and performance. Replace it every 6-12 months for best results in your air fryer recipes."
faqQ4: "Can I substitute baking soda for 0.375 cup of baking powder?"
faqA4: "No, they’re not interchangeable in equal amounts. Baking soda is much stronger, so you’d only need about 1/4 teaspoon per 0.375 cup of baking powder. Always adjust recipes carefully to avoid texture issues."

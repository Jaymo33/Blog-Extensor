faqQ1: "Can I use 1.25 cups of oats instead of weighing them?"
faqA1: "Yes, you can use 1.25 cups of oats instead of weighing them, as it equals approximately 3.5 ounces. However, for baking or precise recipes, weighing ensures accuracy. A kitchen scale is especially helpful for air fryer recipes where consistency matters."

faqA2: "The type of oat (rolled, quick, or steel-cut) doesn’t significantly change the weight of 1.25 cups, which remains around 3.5 ounces. However, steel-cut oats are denser, so they may pack slightly more into a cup. For air fryer recipes, rolled oats are most commonly used."

faqA4: "While oats have a unique texture, you can substitute 1.25 cups (3.5 oz) with panko breadcrumbs or ground nuts for a different crunch. However, this may alter the recipe’s outcome. For best results, stick to oats in air fryer recipes unless specified otherwise."

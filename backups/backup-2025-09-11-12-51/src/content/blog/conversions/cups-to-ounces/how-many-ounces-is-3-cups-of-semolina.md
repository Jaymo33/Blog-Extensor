<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>When cooking with an air fryer, precision is key to achieving the best results. Unlike traditional ovens, air fryers circulate hot air rapidly, meaning even slight imbalances in ingredient ratios can affect texture and taste. Semolina, with its unique granular texture, requires careful measurement to avoid overly dense or crumbly outcomes. Whether you're making air-fried semolina cake or crispy coatings for chicken, knowing how many ounces are in 3 cups of semolina ensures consistency.

<p>Measuring by weight (ounces) is often more reliable than volume (cups) because it accounts for variations in how ingredients settle. For example, a loosely packed cup of semolina may weigh less than a firmly packed one. By converting 3 cups of semolina to ounces, you eliminate guesswork and achieve uniform results. This is particularly helpful for baking in an air fryer, where even distribution of heat demands precise ingredient ratios.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure Semolina Correctly</h3>  
<p>To measure 3 cups of semolina accurately, use a dry measuring cup and level it off with a straight edge. Avoid tapping or packing the semolina down, as this can lead to an incorrect weight. If you have a kitchen scale, weigh out 15 ounces for the most precise measurement. This method is especially useful for recipes like air-fried semolina gnocchi or crispy coatings, where texture is crucial.

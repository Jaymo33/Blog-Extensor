faqQ1: "Does the type of oat affect the weight per cup?"
faqA1: "Yes, the type of oat can slightly affect the weight per cup. Rolled oats and quick oats weigh about the same (around 8 ounces per cup), but steel-cut oats are denser and may weigh slightly more. Always check your recipe for the specific type of oats recommended."
faqQ2: "Can I use a kitchen scale instead of measuring cups for oats?"
faqA2: "Absolutely! Using a kitchen scale to weigh out 12 ounces (for 1.5 cups) is more accurate than using measuring cups. Scales eliminate inconsistencies caused by how the oats are packed into the cup, making them ideal for air fryer recipes where precision matters."
faqQ3: "How do I convert 1.5 cups of oats to grams?"
faqA3: "1.5 cups of oats (12 ounces) is approximately 340 grams. This conversion is useful if you’re using a metric scale or following a recipe with gram measurements. Grams are another precise way to measure dry ingredients like oats."
faqQ4: "Why is measuring oats by weight better for air fryer recipes?"
faqA4: "Measuring oats by weight (ounces or grams) ensures consistency, which is crucial for air fryer recipes. The air fryer’s cooking process relies on even heat distribution, and accurate measurements help prevent undercooking or uneven textures. Weight measurements also make scaling recipes up or down easier."

<h3>Types of oats and their weights</h3>  
<p>Not all oats weigh the same per cup. Rolled oats, quick oats, and steel-cut oats have different densities, which can slightly affect the conversion.

<p>To measure 1.5 cups of oats correctly, use the spoon-and-level method. Gently spoon the oats into a measuring cup without packing them down, then level off the top with a straight edge. Avoid tapping or shaking the cup, as this compacts the oats and leads to inaccurate measurements. For best results, consider using a kitchen scale to weigh out 12 ounces directly.</p>

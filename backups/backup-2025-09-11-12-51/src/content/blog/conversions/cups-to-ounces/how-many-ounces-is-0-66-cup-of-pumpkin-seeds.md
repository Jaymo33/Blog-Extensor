faqQ1: "Can I use a kitchen scale instead of measuring cups for pumpkin seeds?"
faqA1: "Absolutely! A kitchen scale is often more accurate than measuring cups, especially for ingredients like pumpkin seeds that can vary in density. Simply weigh out 3.17 ounces for the equivalent of 0.66 cup. This method eliminates any guesswork and ensures consistency in your air fryer recipes."
faqQ2: "How do I adjust the cooking time for 0.66 cup of pumpkin seeds in the air fryer?"
faqA2: "For 0.66 cup (3.17 ounces) of pumpkin seeds, start with 5-7 minutes at 350°F (175°C), shaking the basket halfway. Cooking time may vary slightly depending on your air fryer model and how crispy you like them. Always keep an eye on them to prevent burning."
faqQ3: "Are roasted pumpkin seeds healthy when cooked in an air fryer?"
faqA3: "Yes! Air-fried pumpkin seeds retain most of their nutrients, including magnesium, zinc, and healthy fats. Using minimal oil in the air fryer keeps them lower in calories compared to traditional frying. They’re a nutritious snack when enjoyed in moderation."
faqQ4: "Can I substitute sunflower seeds for pumpkin seeds in air fryer recipes?"
faqA4: "You can, but note that sunflower seeds are slightly smaller and may require less cooking time. Use the same weight (3.17 ounces for 0.66 cup) rather than volume, as their density differs. Adjust seasoning to taste, as the flavours aren’t identical."

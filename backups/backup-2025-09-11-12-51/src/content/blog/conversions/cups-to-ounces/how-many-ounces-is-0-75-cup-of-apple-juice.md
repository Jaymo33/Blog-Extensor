faqQ1: "Can I use apple juice concentrate instead of liquid apple juice?"
faqA1: "Yes, but you’ll need to dilute it according to the package instructions. Typically, 1 part concentrate mixed with 3 parts water equals regular apple juice. Adjust your 0.75 cup measurement accordingly for air fryer recipes."
faqQ2: "Does the type of apple juice affect the ounce measurement?"
faqA2: "No, whether it’s fresh, bottled, or concentrate (when properly diluted), 0.75 cup of apple juice will always be 6 fluid ounces. However, thicker juices like pulpy varieties may settle, so stir well before measuring."
faqQ3: "How many ounces are in 0.75 cup of apple juice in UK measurements?"
faqA3: "The conversion is the same: 0.75 UK cup of apple juice equals 6 UK fluid ounces. The UK and US fluid ounce measurements are nearly identical, with only a minor difference (1 US fl oz ≈ 0.96 UK fl oz), which won’t impact most recipes."
faqQ4: "Can I substitute apple sauce for apple juice in air fryer recipes?"
faqA4: "Yes, but you’ll need to adjust the quantity. Use 0.5 cup of apple sauce plus 0.25 cup of water to replace 0.75 cup of apple juice. This maintains the right consistency for glazes or marinades in your air fryer."

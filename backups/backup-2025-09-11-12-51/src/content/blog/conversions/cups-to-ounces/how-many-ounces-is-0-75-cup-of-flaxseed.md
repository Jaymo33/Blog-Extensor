faqQ1: "Can I use ground flaxseed instead of whole flaxseed for the same measurement?"
faqA1: "Yes, you can use ground flaxseed instead of whole flaxseed, but the measurement may vary slightly. Ground flaxseed is more compact, so 0.75 cup will weigh a bit more than whole flaxseed. For precise results, weigh it or use a conversion chart."
faqQ2: "How do I store flaxseed to keep it fresh?"
faqA2: "Flaxseed should be stored in an airtight container in a cool, dark place, like a pantry or fridge. Whole flaxseed lasts longer than ground flaxseed, which can go rancid quickly. Always check for a fresh, nutty smell before using."
faqQ3: "Can I substitute flaxseed for eggs in air fryer recipes?"
faqA3: "Yes, flaxseed can be used as an egg substitute in many recipes. Mix 1 tablespoon of ground flaxseed with 3 tablespoons of water to replace one egg. This works well in baked goods but may not be suitable for all dishes."
faqQ4: "Is flaxseed gluten-free?"
faqA4: "Yes, flaxseed is naturally gluten-free, making it a great option for those with gluten sensitivities. Always check labels if you're buying pre-packaged flaxseed to ensure it hasn't been processed in a facility with gluten-containing products."

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter</h2>
<p>Accurate measurements are crucial when cooking with an air fryer, especially for ingredients like flaxseed.

<p>Flaxseed is a versatile ingredient that can be used in everything from bread to smoothies. Knowing how to convert 0.75 cup of flaxseed to ounces helps you follow recipes accurately, whether you're using a UK or US measuring system. This is particularly useful if you're adapting recipes from different sources.</p>

<h2>How to measure flaxseed correctly</h2>
<p>Measuring flaxseed can be tricky because it's a small, dense seed. To get an accurate measurement, use a dry measuring cup and level it off with a straight edge. Avoid packing the flaxseed into the cup, as this can lead to an incorrect measurement. For best results, weigh your flaxseed using a kitchen scale for precision.</p>

<p>If you don't have a scale, the general rule is that 0.75 cup of flaxseed weighs around 3.5 ounces. This conversion is based on the average density of flaxseed, but it can vary slightly depending on how the flaxseed is packed.

<h2>Common mistakes when measuring flaxseed</h2>

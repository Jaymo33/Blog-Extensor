<p>0.66 cup of granulated sugar equals approximately 5.28 ounces (oz). This conversion is essential for precise baking, especially when using an air fryer where measurements can impact cooking times and textures. Whether you're making cakes, cookies, or desserts, knowing the exact weight ensures consistent results.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Sugar Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Granulated sugar is a staple in many recipes, from air fryer cakes to cookies. Measuring it correctly ensures your baked goods have the right sweetness and texture. Too much sugar can make desserts overly sweet or cause them to brown too quickly in the air fryer. Too little, and your treats may turn out dry or bland. That’s why converting 0.66 cup of granulated sugar to ounces (5.28 oz) is so helpful.</p>  

<p>If you're using an air fryer, precise measurements are even more critical. Air fryers cook food faster than conventional ovens, so imbalances in sugar can lead to uneven browning or burning.

<h2>How to Measure 0.66 Cup of Granulated Sugar</h2>  
<p>Measuring 0.66 cup of granulated sugar can be tricky if you don’t have a measuring cup with precise markings. One easy method is to use a digital kitchen scale. Simply set your scale to ounces, tare it to zero, and pour the sugar until it reads 5.28 oz. This method eliminates guesswork and ensures accuracy.</p>  

<p>If you don’t have a scale, you can use the spoon-and-level technique. Fill your measuring cup with granulated sugar using a spoon, then level it off with a straight edge. For 0.66 cup, measure two-thirds of a standard cup—just be mindful that slight variations can occur due to packing.

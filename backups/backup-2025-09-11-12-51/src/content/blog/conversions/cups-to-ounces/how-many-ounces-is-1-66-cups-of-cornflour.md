faqQ1: "Can I use plain flour instead of cornflour for 1.66 cups in an air fryer?"
faqA1: "While you can substitute plain flour, the texture will differ. Cornflour creates a crispier coating, whereas plain flour may result in a denser finish. If replacing, use the same weight (7.5 ounces) but expect slight variations in crunch."
faqQ2: "How do I measure 1.66 cups of cornflour without a measuring cup?"
faqA2: "If you don’t have a measuring cup, use a kitchen scale to weigh out 7.5 ounces. Alternatively, a standard mug holds roughly 1 cup, so 1.66 cups would be about 1 mug plus two-thirds of another. Level it off for accuracy."
faqQ3: "Why does my air fryer recipe turn out soggy with 1.66 cups of cornflour?"
faqA3: "Sogginess can occur if the cornflour isn’t evenly distributed or if the air fryer is overcrowded. Ensure you shake off excess batter and cook in batches. Also, check that your cornflour is fresh and not clumped."
faqQ4: "Is 1.66 cups of cornflour the same in the UK and US?"
faqA4: "Yes, 1.66 cups of cornflour equals 7.5 ounces in both the UK and US. However, always use a scale for absolute precision, as cup sizes can vary slightly between brands. Stick to weight measurements for best results."

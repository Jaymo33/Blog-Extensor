faqQ1: "Can I use grams instead of ounces for measuring raisins?"
faqA1: "Absolutely! Two cups of raisins equal about 283 grams. Many UK recipes use grams for precision, and a kitchen scale makes measuring easy. Grams are often preferred in baking for their accuracy."
faqQ2: "Do golden raisins weigh the same as regular raisins per cup?"
faqA2: "Yes, golden and regular raisins have similar weights. Both types hover around 5 ounces per cup, though slight variations can occur due to moisture content. Always check if your recipe specifies a type."
faqQ3: "How should I store leftover raisins after measuring 2 cups?"
faqA3: "Keep raisins in an airtight container in a cool, dark place. They’ll stay fresh for months. For longer storage, refrigerate or freeze them. Just bring to room temperature before using in air fryer recipes."
faqQ4: "Why does my air fryer recipe call for weighed raisins instead of cup measurements?"
faqA4: "Weight ensures consistency, as cup measurements can vary based on how raisins are packed. Air fryers need precise ingredient ratios for even cooking, so weighing eliminates guesswork. A scale is a baker’s best friend!"

<h3>Tips for measuring raisins without a scale</h3>  
<p>If you lack a scale, fluff the raisins before lightly filling the cup. Avoid tapping the cup, as this compacts them and skews the weight.

faqQ1: "Can I use Greek yogurt instead of plain yogurt in air fryer recipes?"
faqA1: "Yes, Greek yogurt can be substituted, but it’s thicker and denser. For 0.5 cup (4.25 oz) of plain yogurt, you may need to thin Greek yogurt with a splash of milk or water to match the consistency."
faqQ2: "Does the fat content of yogurt affect the measurement in ounces?"
faqA2: "No, the fat content doesn’t change the weight significantly. Whether it’s full-fat or low-fat, 0.5 cup of plain yogurt will still weigh around 4.25 ounces. However, thicker yogurts may require slight adjustments in recipes."
faqQ3: "How do I measure yogurt without a scale?"
faqA3: "Use a liquid measuring cup for the most accuracy. Spoon the yogurt in gently and level it off with a knife. Avoid packing it down, as this can lead to over-measuring."
faqQ4: "Can I freeze plain yogurt for later use in air fryer recipes?"
faqA4: "Yes, but the texture may change slightly. Thawed yogurt works best in cooked dishes like marinades or baked goods rather than fresh dips. Stir well before measuring 0.5 cup (4.25 oz) for consistency."

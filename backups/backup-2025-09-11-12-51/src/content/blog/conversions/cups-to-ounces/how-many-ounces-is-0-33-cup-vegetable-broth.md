faqQ1: "Can I use stock instead of vegetable broth for this measurement?"
faqA1: "Yes, you can substitute vegetable stock for broth in the same amount (0.33 cup or 2.64 fl oz). The flavour may be slightly richer, but the liquid volume remains the same. This swap works well in most air fryer recipes."
faqQ2: "How do I measure 0.33 cup without a measuring cup?"
faqA2: "Use 5 tablespoons plus 1 teaspoon for a close approximation to 0.33 cup. Alternatively, weigh 2.64 fl oz on a kitchen scale. For small quantities, a medicine syringe or shot glass marked in ounces can also work."
faqQ3: "Does the brand of vegetable broth affect the ounce measurement?"
faqA3: "Most commercial vegetable broths have similar densities, so 0.33 cup will still be roughly 2.64 fl oz. However, homemade broth may vary slightly depending on ingredient concentration. When in doubt, weigh it for accuracy."
faqQ4: "Why is 0.33 cup a common measurement in air fryer recipes?"
faqA4: "This amount (2.64 fl oz) is often used because it's enough to add moisture without making food soggy in the air fryer's compact cooking space. It's ideal for glazes, marinades, or deglazing while avoiding excess liquid."

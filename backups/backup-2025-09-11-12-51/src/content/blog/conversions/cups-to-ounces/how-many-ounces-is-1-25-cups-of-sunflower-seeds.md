faqQ1: "Can I use a kitchen scale instead of measuring cups for sunflower seeds?"
faqA1: "Absolutely! A kitchen scale is often more accurate than measuring cups, especially for ingredients like sunflower seeds. Simply weigh out 6 ounces to match 1.25 cups. This method eliminates any guesswork and ensures perfect results every time."
faqQ2: "Do roasted sunflower seeds weigh the same as raw ones?"
faqA2: "Roasted sunflower seeds might weigh slightly less due to moisture loss during roasting, but the difference is minimal. For most recipes, you can use the same 1.25 cups to 6 ounces conversion. If precision is critical, weigh them after roasting."
faqQ3: "How long should I air fry sunflower seeds for a crispy snack?"
faqA3: "For crispy roasted sunflower seeds, air fry them at 160°C for 5-7 minutes, shaking the basket halfway. Keep an eye on them to prevent burning. They’re ready when golden and fragrant."
faqQ4: "Can I substitute sunflower seeds with another type of seed in recipes?"
faqA4: "Yes, pumpkin seeds or chopped nuts can work as substitutes, but adjust quantities based on weight.

faqQ1: "Can I use 2.5 cups of raisins directly in my air fryer?"
faqA1: "While you can use 2.5 cups of raisins directly, it's best to mix them with other ingredients or spread them evenly. In an air fryer, loose small items like raisins can blow around or fall through the basket. Consider using them in baked goods or mixing with larger ingredients."
faqQ2: "Do different types of raisins weigh the same per cup?"
faqA2: "Different varieties like golden, sultana, or currants have slightly different weights due to size and moisture content. However, the difference is minimal for most recipes. For precise baking, always weigh your raisins rather than relying solely on cup measurements."
faqQ3: "How do I prevent raisins from burning in the air fryer?"
faqA3: "To prevent burning, soak raisins briefly before use or mix them with moist ingredients. Lower the temperature slightly and check frequently. For recipes where raisins are exposed, consider adding them partway through cooking or covering with foil."
faqQ4: "Can I substitute other dried fruits using the same conversion?"
faqA4: "While the cup-to-ounce conversion works similarly for most dried fruits, denser options like dates or figs weigh more. Always check specific weight conversions when substituting. For air fryer recipes, consider how the substitute might affect cooking time and texture."

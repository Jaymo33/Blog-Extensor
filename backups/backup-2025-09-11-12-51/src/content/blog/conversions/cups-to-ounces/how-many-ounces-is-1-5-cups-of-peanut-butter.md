<h3>How to measure peanut butter correctly</h3>  
<p>Measuring sticky ingredients like peanut butter can be tricky. For accuracy, use a kitchen scale to weigh out 12 ounces directly. If you don’t have one, lightly grease your measuring cup to help the peanut butter slide out easily. This method ensures you get the full 1.5 cups without leaving half stuck to the utensil.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for 1.5 cups of peanut butter in air fryer recipes</h2>  
<p>This quantity is perfect for batch cooking. You might use it for a large batch of peanut butter cookies, a creamy satay sauce for chicken skewers, or even energy bites. The air fryer’s rapid circulation ensures even cooking, so your peanut butter-based dishes come out perfectly every time.

<h3>Adjusting recipes for different peanut butter types</h3>  
<p>Natural peanut butter tends to be runnier, while commercial varieties are thicker. If using natural, you may need slightly less than 1.5 cups to hit 12 ounces. Always check the label for weight per cup to ensure accuracy. This small adjustment can prevent your air fryer dishes from becoming too oily or dry.</p>

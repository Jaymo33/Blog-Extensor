faqQ1: "Can I use baking powder instead of baking soda in my air fryer recipes?"
faqA1: "Baking powder and baking soda aren’t interchangeable. Baking soda requires an acidic ingredient (like yogurt or vinegar) to activate, while baking powder contains its own acid. Using the wrong one can affect texture and taste. Stick to the recipe’s instructions for best results."
faqQ2: "How do I store baking soda to keep it fresh for air fryer cooking?"
faqA2: "Keep baking soda in an airtight container in a cool, dry place. Moisture can cause clumping and reduce its effectiveness. For long-term storage, replace it every 6 months to ensure optimal performance in your air fryer recipes."
faqQ3: "Why does my air fryer recipe taste bitter when I use baking soda?"
faqA3: "Bitterness usually means you’ve used too much baking soda. Always measure carefully—0.5 cup equals 4 ounces. If the recipe doesn’t include enough acidic ingredients to neutralise the soda, the bitter taste can linger."
faqQ4: "Can I use baking soda to clean my air fryer basket?"
faqA4: "Yes! A paste of 0.5 cup (4 ounces) baking soda and water works wonders for removing grease. Apply, let it sit for 10 minutes, then scrub gently. Rinse thoroughly before using the air fryer again to avoid residue."

<p>0.5 cup of baking soda equals approximately 4 ounces (113 grams). This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes, where precise measurements can affect texture and rise. Whether you're whipping up a batch of air-fried cookies or using baking soda to clean your appliance, knowing the exact weight ensures consistency.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on even heat distribution, and incorrect ingredient quantities can lead to uneven cooking. Baking soda, often used in batters or as a leavening agent, needs precise measurement to avoid overly dense or flat results. For example, too much baking soda in an air fryer cake can cause a bitter taste, while too little may prevent proper rising.</p>  
<p>At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we emphasise the importance of accurate conversions for perfect results. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> simplifies these calculations, so you never have to guess.</p>  

<h3>How to measure 0.5 cup of baking soda correctly</h3>  
<p>Use a dry measuring cup for baking soda, levelling it off with a straight edge for accuracy. Scooping directly from the container can compact the powder, leading to excess. For even greater precision, a kitchen scale set to ounces ensures you get exactly 4 ounces (0.5 cup) every time.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for baking soda in air fryers</h2>  
<p>Beyond baking, baking soda is a versatile ingredient for air fryer maintenance. A paste made from baking soda and water can help remove stubborn grease from the basket. Simply mix 0.5 cup (4 ounces) of baking soda with a few tablespoons of water, apply, and scrub gently.</p>

<h3>Converting other baking soda quantities</h3>  
<p>If your recipe calls for a different amount, here’s a quick reference: 1 cup of baking soda equals 8 ounces (227 grams), while ¼ cup is 2 ounces (57 grams). These conversions are handy for scaling recipes up or down, especially when adapting traditional oven recipes for your air fryer.</p>

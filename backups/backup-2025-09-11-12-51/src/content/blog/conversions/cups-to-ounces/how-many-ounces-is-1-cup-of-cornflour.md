faqQ1: "Can I use plain flour instead of cornflour in air fryer recipes?"
faqA1: "While you can substitute plain flour, the results will differ. Cornflour creates a crispier, lighter texture due to its fine consistency. For every 1 cup (4.4 ounces) of cornflour, use 1.5 cups of plain flour and adjust liquids accordingly."
faqQ2: "Why does my air fryer coating turn out soggy?"
faqA2: "Sogginess often stems from excess moisture or uneven cornflour distribution. Pat ingredients dry before coating, and shake off excess. Preheat the air fryer and avoid overcrowding the basket for optimal crispiness."
faqQ3: "How do I measure cornflour without a scale?"
faqA3: "Fluff the cornflour with a spoon, then lightly spoon it into a measuring cup. Level off the top with a knife for an approximate 4.4-ounce cup. For baking, a scale is highly recommended."
faqQ4: "Is cornflour the same as cornstarch in the UK?"
faqA4: "Yes, in the UK, cornflour and cornstarch are the same product. Both refer to the fine, white powder made from maize, ideal for thickening and frying in air fryers."

<p>1 cup of cornflour equals approximately 4.4 ounces (125 grams). This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precision matters. Whether you're coating chicken or baking gluten-free treats, knowing the exact weight ensures consistency. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we emphasise accurate measurements for flawless cooking. Let’s dive deeper into why this matters and how to apply it.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate cornflour measurements matter</h2>  
<p>Cornflour is a staple in air fryer cooking, often used for crispy coatings or thickening sauces. Too much can make dishes gummy, while too little may leave them soggy. For example, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer chicken tenders</a> rely on a 4.4-ounce cornflour mix for the perfect crunch. Even slight deviations can alter texture, so weighing ingredients is best. A kitchen scale eliminates guesswork and guarantees repeatable results.</p>  

<p>British recipes sometimes use volume measurements, but weight is more reliable. Cornflour can settle or vary in density, making cups inconsistent. If you’re adapting a recipe from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken dishes</a> to desserts, always check the ounces. This avoids mishaps like overly dense cakes or runny batters. For gluten-free baking, precision is even more critical.</p>  

<h3>Converting cups to ounces for different brands</h3>  
<p>Not all cornflour brands pack the same way, so weights may differ slightly. To confirm, fluff the cornflour with a spoon before measuring. Scooping directly compacts it, leading to more than 4.4 ounces per cup. If your air fryer recipe calls for "1 cup sifted," weigh after sifting for accuracy. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a> covers other common ingredients too.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for cornflour in air fryers</h2>  
<p>Cornflour shines in air fryers for creating ultra-crispy textures. It’s a key ingredient in tempura batters, fried chicken coatings, and even onion rings. A 1-cup (4.4-ounce) portion is often enough for family-sized meals. For lighter options, try blending it with spices for a low-oil crunch. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable recipes</a> for inspired ideas.</p>  

<p>Beyond frying, cornflour thickens sauces and gravies in air fryer dishes. Use 1 tablespoon (0.3 ounces) per cup of liquid for a smooth consistency. Unlike flour, it’s gluten-free and doesn’t clump as easily. Always mix with cold water first to prevent lumps. This trick works wonders for stir-fries and casseroles cooked in air fryer baskets.</p>  

<h3>Storing cornflour for long-term use</h3>  
<p>Keep cornflour in an airtight container to maintain freshness. Humidity can cause clumping, affecting your 1-cup-to-ounces ratio. If it hardens, sieve before measuring. Proper storage ensures your <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer stays mess-free</a> during cooking. For bulk buyers, divide into smaller portions to preserve quality.</p>

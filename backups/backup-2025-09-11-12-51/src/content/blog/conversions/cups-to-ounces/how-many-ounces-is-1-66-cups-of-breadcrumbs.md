faqQ1: "Can I use grams instead of ounces for 1.66 cups of breadcrumbs?"
faqA1: "Yes, you can! 1.66 cups of breadcrumbs (6.64 oz) is roughly 188 grams. If your kitchen scale uses grams, this conversion will help you measure accurately for air fryer recipes."
faqQ2: "Does the type of breadcrumb affect the weight of 1.66 cups?"

<h2>How to Measure 1.66 Cups of Breadcrumbs Correctly</h2>  
<p>For the most accurate results, use a kitchen scale to weigh your breadcrumbs. If you don’t have one, lightly spoon the breadcrumbs into a measuring cup without packing them down.

<p>Different types of breadcrumbs (panko, fresh, or dried) can vary slightly in weight. Panko, for example, is lighter, so you might need a bit more by volume.

faqQ1: "Can I use honey instead of golden syrup in air fryer recipes?"
faqA1: "Yes, honey can substitute golden syrup in most recipes, but it has a stronger flavour. Use a 1:1 ratio, but note that honey may brown faster in the air fryer due to its higher fructose content. Adjust cooking times slightly to prevent burning."
faqQ2: "How do I clean golden syrup from my air fryer basket?"
faqA2: "Golden syrup can be sticky, but a mix of warm water and mild detergent works well. For tough residue, try our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner guide</a>. Always unplug the appliance and let it cool before cleaning."
faqQ3: "Is golden syrup the same as corn syrup?"
faqA3: "No, golden syrup has a distinct caramel flavour, while corn syrup is milder. In the UK, golden syrup is preferred for its rich taste. If substituting, adjust other sweeteners in the recipe to balance flavours."
faqQ4: "Why does my air fryer recipe with golden syrup turn out too sticky?"
faqA4: "This usually happens if too much syrup is used or the temperature is too low. Reduce the syrup slightly or increase the air fryer temperature by 10°C to help caramelise the sugars evenly. Check our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe tips</a> for more advice."

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Golden syrup is a staple in many recipes, from sticky puddings to glazes for air-fried meats. Using the correct amount ensures the right texture and flavour. Too much syrup can make dishes overly sweet or sticky, while too little might leave them lacking depth. For air fryer recipes, where cooking times are shorter, precision is even more critical.</p>

<h2>How to Measure Golden Syrup Correctly</h2>  
<p>Measuring golden syrup can be tricky due to its thick, sticky consistency. For the most accurate results, lightly grease your measuring cup with oil or butter before pouring in the syrup. This helps it slide out easily, ensuring you get the full 1.5 cups (18 oz) without waste.</p>

faqQ1: "Can I use granulated sugar instead of 0.66 cup brown sugar in air fryer recipes?"
faqA1: "Yes, but texture and taste will differ. Brown sugar’s molasses adds moisture and depth. Replace 0.66 cup (5.28 oz) brown sugar with 0.66 cup white sugar plus 1 tbsp maple syrup for similar results in air fryer baking."
faqQ2: "Why does my air fryer recipe taste too sweet with 0.66 cup brown sugar?"
faqA2: "Overpacking the cup can exceed 5.28 oz. Fluff the sugar before measuring, or use scales. Also, check if your recipe lists weight—some UK recipes assume lightly packed cups."
faqQ3: "How do I store leftover brown sugar after measuring 0.66 cup?"
faqA3: "Keep it in an airtight container with a terra cotta disc to prevent hardening. If it clumps, revive it in the air fryer at 120°C for 2 minutes."
faqQ4: "Is 0.66 cup brown sugar the same in US and UK measurements?"
faqA4: "Yes, but UK recipes often weigh ingredients. 0.66 cup equals 5.28 oz in both, but UK bakers may prefer grams (150g). Always check the recipe’s origin for clarity."

For consistent results, use a kitchen scale—especially with recipes from <a href="https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes">airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> that rely on precise ratios.</p>

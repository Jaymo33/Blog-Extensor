faqQ1: "Can I use fresh peas instead of frozen for this measurement?"
faqA1: "Fresh peas weigh slightly less than frozen peas due to water content. 0.33 cup of fresh peas is about 2.3 ounces. Adjust cooking times as fresh peas cook faster in the air fryer."
faqQ2: "Do I need to thaw frozen peas before air frying?"
faqA2: "No, you can air fry frozen peas directly from the freezer. Thawing isn’t necessary and may make them mushy. Just spread them evenly in the basket for best results."
faqQ3: "How long should I cook 0.33 cup of frozen peas in the air fryer?"
faqA3: "Cook at 180°C for 5-7 minutes, shaking halfway. They should be tender but still bright green. Overcooking can make them shrivel and lose sweetness."
faqQ4: "Can I substitute other frozen veggies using the same conversion?"
faqA4: "Not all veggies weigh the same per cup. For example, 0.33 cup of frozen corn is closer to 3 ounces. Always check specific conversions for accuracy."

faqQ1: "Can I use butter instead of margarine in air fryer recipes?"
faqA1: "Yes, you can substitute butter for margarine in most air fryer recipes. Use the same 1.5 cups (12 ounces) measurement, but be aware that butter has a slightly lower water content, which might affect texture. For best results, reduce cooking time by a minute or two when using butter."
faqQ2: "How do I measure 1.5 cups of margarine without a measuring cup?"
faqA2: "If you don’t have measuring cups, use the markings on the margarine wrapper. Most UK blocks are 250g (8.8 oz), so you’d need about 1.4 blocks for 12 ounces. Alternatively, use a kitchen scale for precise measurement – 1.5 cups equals 340 grams."
faqQ3: "Does margarine behave differently in an air fryer compared to butter?"
faqA3: "Margarine and butter perform similarly in air fryers, but there are slight differences. Margarine typically has a higher water content, which can create more steam. This might affect crispiness in some recipes. For optimal results, consider reducing quantities slightly when converting from oven recipes."
faqQ4: "How should I store margarine for air fryer cooking?"
faqA4: "Keep margarine in its original wrapper in the fridge until needed. For air fryer use, let it soften slightly at room temperature for about 15 minutes before measuring. This makes it easier to work with and ensures accurate measurements when converting 1.5 cups to ounces."

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>
<p>Using the correct amount of margarine can make or break your air fryer recipes. Too little, and your dish might turn out dry; too much, and it could become greasy.

<h3>How to measure margarine correctly</h3>
<p>When measuring margarine, it’s best to use a kitchen scale for accuracy. If you don’t have one, the markings on the margarine wrapper can help.

This method ensures you’re not over or under-measuring, which is crucial for air fryer success.</p>

<p>0.375 cup of baking soda equals 3 ounces (oz) in UK measurements. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes, where precise measurements can make or break your dish. Whether you're whipping up crispy treats or fluffy cakes, knowing the exact weight ensures consistent results every time. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we help simplify these conversions so you can focus on cooking.</p>

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer recipes</h2>  
<p>Baking soda is a leavening agent, and even small variations can affect texture and rise. Too much can leave a bitter taste, while too little may result in dense baked goods. Air fryers circulate hot air rapidly, so precise ingredient ratios are crucial. If you're experimenting with recipes from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>our collection</a>, always measure carefully. A digital kitchen scale is ideal, but cup-to-ounce conversions work in a pinch.</p>  

<p>For reference, 1 cup of baking soda weighs 8 ounces, so 0.375 cup is exactly 3 ounces. This measurement is particularly useful for UK cooks adapting American recipes, which often use volume-based measurements. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more handy tips.</p>  

<h3>How to measure 0.375 cup of baking soda without scales</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a scale, use the spoon-and-level method for accuracy. Lightly spoon baking soda into a measuring cup until it mounds slightly above the rim, then level it off with a straight edge. For 0.375 cup, measure 6 tablespoons (since 1 cup = 16 tablespoons). This method minimises compaction, which can lead to over-measuring. Always store baking soda in an airtight container to maintain consistency.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for 0.375 cup (3 oz) of baking soda in air frying</h2>  
<p>This quantity is perfect for batters, coatings, or homemade cleaning solutions for your air fryer basket. Try it in crispy <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>air-fryer chicken</a> recipes, where a pinch enhances browning. It’s also great for fluffy doughnuts or quick breads. Remember, baking soda activates with acid (like yogurt or vinegar), so timing matters. Preheat your air fryer to ensure even cooking.</p>  

<p>For non-cooking uses, 3 oz of baking soda mixed with water makes an excellent <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner</a>. Its mild abrasiveness helps remove grease without scratching surfaces. Just apply, let sit for 10 minutes, then wipe clean. This avoids harsh chemicals near your food.</p>  

<h3>Adjusting recipes for UK vs. US measurements</h3>  
<p>UK and US cup sizes are identical (240ml), but ingredient densities vary. Always check whether a recipe uses metric or imperial weights. For baking soda, 0.375 cup consistently equals 3 oz in both systems. When adapting <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert recipes</a>, note that UK tablespoons differ slightly (15ml vs. 14.2ml in the US), but this won’t impact dry measurements like baking soda.</p>

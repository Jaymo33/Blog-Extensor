<p>2.5 cups of marmalade equals approximately 20 ounces. This conversion is essential for precise measurements in recipes, especially when using an air fryer. Whether you’re making glazes, desserts, or sauces, knowing the exact weight ensures consistent results. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we focus on making conversions simple for home cooks. Let’s dive deeper into how this measurement works and why it matters.</p>

<h2>Understanding the conversion from cups to ounces</h2>
<p>Converting cups to ounces can be tricky because it depends on the ingredient’s density. Marmalade, being a thick, sticky spread, weighs more than liquids like water. One cup of marmalade typically weighs around 8 ounces, so 2.5 cups would be 20 ounces. This measurement is crucial for air fryer recipes where precision affects texture and cooking time.

<p>When measuring marmalade, always use a standard measuring cup for accuracy. Scooping it directly from the jar can lead to inconsistencies. If you’re working with a recipe that calls for ounces, a kitchen scale is your best friend. This is especially true for air fryer cooking, where even small variations can impact the outcome. Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a> for ideas on how to use marmalade in your air fryer.</p>

<h3>Why accuracy matters in air fryer cooking</h3>
<p>Air fryers cook food quickly and evenly, but they rely on precise measurements for best results. Too much marmalade can make dishes overly sweet or sticky, while too little might leave them lacking flavour. Knowing that 2.5 cups of marmalade equals 20 ounces helps you follow recipes correctly. This is particularly important for glazes and marinades, where balance is key.

faqQ1: "Can I use a kitchen scale to measure hoisin sauce instead of cups?"
faqA1: "Yes, a kitchen scale is ideal for measuring hoisin sauce, especially since it’s thick and sticky. Weighing 10 ounces (equivalent to 1.25 cups) ensures accuracy and avoids messy measuring cups. Scales are also quicker and easier to clean after use."
faqQ2: "Does hoisin sauce weight change if it’s refrigerated?"
faqA2: "Hoisin sauce thickens when chilled, but its weight remains the same. If measuring cold hoisin sauce, let it sit at room temperature for 10 minutes to soften slightly. This makes it easier to pour or scoop without affecting the ounce measurement."
faqQ3: "How do I adjust hoisin sauce measurements for a smaller air fryer batch?"
faqA3: "For smaller batches, simply scale down the measurement proportionally. For example, half of 1.25 cups (10 ounces) would be 0.625 cups or 5 ounces. Use a kitchen scale for precise smaller quantities, especially with sticky sauces like hoisin."
faqQ4: "Is there a difference between UK and US ounces for hoisin sauce?"
faqA4: "No, fluid ounces (used for liquids like hoisin sauce) are the same in the UK and US. However, dry ounces differ slightly, but since hoisin is a liquid, 1.25 cups will always equal 10 ounces regardless of location. Always use fluid ounces for sauces."

<h2>Why accurate hoisin sauce measurements matter</h2>
<p>Using the right amount of hoisin sauce ensures your dishes aren’t too salty or overly sweet. In an air fryer, precise measurements help achieve even cooking and perfect texture. Too much sauce can make food soggy, while too little might leave it bland. Hoisin sauce is thick and sticky, so measuring by weight (ounces) is often more reliable than volume (cups). If you’re experimenting with new recipes, start with 10 ounces for 1.25 cups and adjust to taste.

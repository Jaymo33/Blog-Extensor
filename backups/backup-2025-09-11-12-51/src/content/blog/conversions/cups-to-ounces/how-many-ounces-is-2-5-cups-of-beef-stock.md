faqQ1: "Is 2.5 cups of beef stock the same as 20 ounces in the UK?"
faqA1: "Yes, in the UK, 2.5 cups of beef stock equals 20 fluid ounces. This is because 1 UK cup is 8 fluid ounces, so 2.5 x 8 = 20 fl oz. Always use a liquid measuring jug for accuracy."
faqQ2: "Can I use US measurements for beef stock in UK recipes?"
faqA2: "No, US cups are slightly smaller than UK cups. A US cup is about 8.12 fluid ounces, so 2.5 US cups would be roughly 20.3 fl oz. Stick to UK measurements for consistency in UK recipes."
faqQ3: "How do I measure 2.5 cups of beef stock without a measuring jug?"
faqA3: "If you don’t have a jug, use a standard UK mug (about 8 fl oz) and fill it 2.5 times. Alternatively, weigh it: 20 fl oz of beef stock weighs approximately 568 grams."
faqQ4: "Why does my air fryer recipe call for beef stock in ounces instead of cups?"
faqA4: "Some recipes use ounces for precision, especially in air fryers where space is limited. Converting 2.5 cups of beef stock to ounces (20 fl oz) ensures you don’t overfill the basket or dilute flavours."

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Precision is key when cooking, especially with liquids like beef stock. Too much or too little can alter the flavour and texture of your dish. For air fryer recipes, where space is limited, exact measurements ensure even cooking.

<p>Beef stock is a staple in many dishes, from hearty stews to rich gravies.

Remember, 2.5 cups of beef stock to ounces is 20 fl oz in the UK.</p>  

<h3>Converting Cups to Ounces</h3>  
<p>The UK uses fluid ounces, which differ slightly from US measurements. For liquids like beef stock, 1 UK cup equals 8 fluid ounces. So, 2.5 cups of beef stock to oz UK is simply 2.5 multiplied by 8, giving you 20 fl oz.</p>

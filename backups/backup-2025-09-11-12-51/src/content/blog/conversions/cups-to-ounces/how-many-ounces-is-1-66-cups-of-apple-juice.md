<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on precise ingredient ratios to achieve the perfect texture and flavour. Too much or too little liquid, like apple juice, can affect cooking times and results.

Consistency is key, whether you're cooking chicken, vegetables, or desserts.</p>  

<p>Using a kitchen scale to measure 13.28 ounces of apple juice ensures accuracy. Cups can vary slightly depending on how you fill them, but weight is always precise. This is particularly important for <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert recipes</a>, where liquid ratios impact texture.

For smaller increments, a tablespoon measure can help—1.66 cups equals about 26.5 tablespoons. This method works well for recipes like glazes or sauces where precision isn’t as critical. However, for baking or marinades, weighing 13.28 ounces is the gold standard.</p>

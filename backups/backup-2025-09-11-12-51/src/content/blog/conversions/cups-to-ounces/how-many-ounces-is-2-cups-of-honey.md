faqQ1: "Can I use a liquid measuring cup for honey?"
faqA1: "Yes, but it’s best to lightly grease the cup first to help the honey slide out easily. For the most accuracy, use a kitchen scale to measure 24 ounces directly, especially for air fryer recipes where precision matters."
faqQ2: "Does the type of honey affect the weight of 2 cups?"
faqA2: "Slightly. Thicker varieties like manuka honey may weigh a bit more per cup due to higher density, but the difference is minimal. For most recipes, 2 cups of any honey will be close to 24 ounces."
faqQ3: "How do I convert 2 cups of honey to grams for UK recipes?"
faqA3: "2 cups (24 ounces) of honey is approximately 680 grams. This conversion is handy for UK cooks using metric measurements or digital scales. Always double-check if the recipe specifies a particular type of honey, as weights can vary marginally."
faqQ4: "Can I substitute honey with other sweeteners in air fryer recipes?"
faqA4: "Yes, but adjustments may be needed. Maple syrup or agave nectar can replace honey in a 1:1 ratio, but they have different moisture levels. For sugar substitutes, reduce liquid elsewhere in the recipe to maintain the right consistency for air frying."

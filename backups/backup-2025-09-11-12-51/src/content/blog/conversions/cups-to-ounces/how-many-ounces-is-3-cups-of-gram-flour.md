faqQ1: "Can I use gram flour instead of all-purpose flour in air fryer recipes?"
faqA1: "Yes, gram flour works well as a gluten-free alternative in air fryer recipes. It adds a nutty flavour and crispier texture, making it ideal for coatings and batters. Just note that it absorbs more liquid than all-purpose flour, so you may need to adjust wet ingredients slightly."
faqQ2: "How do I prevent gram flour from clumping in my air fryer recipes?"
faqA2: "To avoid clumps, sift the gram flour before mixing it with other ingredients. Adding liquids gradually while whisking also helps create a smooth batter. For extra crispiness, lightly spray your air fryer basket with oil before cooking."
faqQ3: "Is gram flour healthier than regular flour for air frying?"
faqA3: "Gram flour is higher in protein and fibre compared to all-purpose flour, making it a nutritious choice. It’s also naturally gluten-free and lower on the glycemic index. However, like all flours, moderation is key for balanced eating."
faqQ4: "Can I make air fryer desserts with gram flour?"
faqA4: "Absolutely! Gram flour adds a rich, earthy flavour to desserts like besan ladoo or gluten-free cookies. For best results, combine it with a bit of rice flour or almond flour to balance the texture.

faqQ1: "Can I use a different oil if I don’t have sunflower oil?"
faqA1: "Yes, you can substitute other oils like vegetable or rapeseed oil, but adjust measurements slightly. Sunflower oil has a specific density, so 0.125 cup of another oil might not equal exactly 1 oz. Check conversion charts for precise weights."
faqQ2: "Why is sunflower oil recommended for air fryers?"

faqQ3: "How do I clean my air fryer after using sunflower oil?"
faqA3: "After cooking with sunflower oil, let the air fryer cool, then wipe with a damp cloth. For stubborn residue, use warm soapy water or our recommended <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning solutions</a>. Regular maintenance prevents oil buildup."
faqQ4: "Can I reduce the amount of sunflower oil in air fryer recipes?"
faqA4: "Yes, many air fryer recipes work with less oil than traditional methods. However, reducing the 0.125 cup measurement too much may affect crispiness. Experiment gradually to find your preferred balance between health and texture."

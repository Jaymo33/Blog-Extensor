faqQ1: "Can I use granulated sugar instead of caster sugar in air fryer recipes?"
faqA1: "Yes, but granulated sugar has larger crystals, which may not dissolve as easily. For best results, pulse it in a blender briefly to mimic caster sugar’s texture. The weight conversion (0.5 cup = 3.5 ounces) remains the same."
faqQ2: "Why does my air fryer bake sometimes burn when using caster sugar?"
faqA2: "Air fryers cook faster than ovens, so sugar can caramelize quickly. Reduce the temperature by 10-20°C and check doneness early. Using an <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner</a> to remove residue also helps prevent uneven heating."
faqQ3: "How do I store caster sugar to keep it fresh for air fryer baking?"
faqA3: "Store caster sugar in an airtight container in a cool, dry place. Moisture can cause clumping, affecting measurement accuracy. If it hardens, break it up with a fork before measuring."
faqQ4: "Is 0.5 cup of caster sugar the same in US and UK measurements?"
faqA4: "Yes, 0.5 cup of caster sugar is approximately 3.5 ounces (100 grams) in both US and UK measurements. However, always weigh it for precision, as cup sizes can vary slightly between brands."

<p>0.5 cup of caster sugar equals approximately 3.5 ounces (100 grams). This conversion is essential for air fryer baking, where precise measurements can make or break your recipe. Whether you’re whipping up cakes, cookies, or desserts, knowing the exact weight ensures perfect results every time. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we’re all about helping you master air fryer cooking with accurate conversions and tips.</p>

<h2>Why accurate sugar measurements matter in air fryer baking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers cook food faster and more evenly than conventional ovens, so precise ingredient measurements are crucial. Too much sugar can cause over-browning or uneven cooking, while too little may affect texture and taste. Caster sugar, with its fine granules, dissolves quickly, making it ideal for air fryer recipes like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>cakes</a> and <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cookies>cookies</a>. Measuring by weight (ounces) rather than volume (cups) ensures consistency, especially when scaling recipes up or down.</p>  

<p>For those who love baking, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> is a handy tool to keep nearby. It covers common ingredient conversions, including flour, butter, and, of course, caster sugar. No more guessing—just perfect bakes every time!</p>  

<h3>How to measure 0.5 cup of caster sugar correctly</h3>  
<p>To measure 0.5 cup of caster sugar accurately, use a dry measuring cup and level it off with a straight edge. Scooping directly from the bag can compact the sugar, leading to more than needed. For best results, weigh it on a kitchen scale—3.5 ounces (100 grams) is the golden number. This method is especially useful for air fryer recipes, where precision ensures even cooking and perfect texture.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for 0.5 cup of caster sugar in air fryer recipes</h2>  
<p>Half a cup of caster sugar is a versatile measurement in air fryer baking. It’s perfect for small batches of <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>desserts</a>, like mug cakes or shortbread cookies. Since air fryers heat up quickly, recipes with caster sugar benefit from its fine texture, which blends seamlessly into batters and doughs. Whether you’re making a quick sponge or a batch of scones, 0.5 cup (3.5 ounces) is a common starting point.</p>  

<p>If you’re experimenting with new recipes, always check the sugar measurement first. Too much can cause caramelization too fast, while too little may leave your bake tasting bland.

These conversions ensure your air fryer bakes turn out just right. Remember, keeping a kitchen scale handy eliminates guesswork and guarantees consistency—especially when adapting traditional oven recipes for the air fryer.</p>

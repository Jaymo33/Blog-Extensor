faqQ1: "Can I use self-raising flour instead of plain flour for 0.125 cup measurements?"
faqA1: "Yes, but note that self-raising flour includes baking powder, which affects texture. For coatings or thickening, plain flour is better. If substituting, still measure 0.125 cup as ~0.56 oz, but expect a slightly lighter result."
faqQ2: "Why does my air fryer recipe turn out dry when using 0.125 cup of flour?"
faqA2: "Dryness often comes from overcooking or too much flour. Ensure you’re measuring 0.125 cup (0.56 oz) accurately and check cooking times. Air fryers vary, so reduce heat or time if needed."
faqQ3: "How do I convert 0.125 cup of plain flour to grams?"
faqA3: "0.125 cup of plain flour is ~16 grams. For air fryer recipes, grams offer precision. Use a scale for best results, especially in baking."
faqQ4: "Can I skip flour altogether in air fryer recipes?"
faqA4: "Yes! Many recipes use alternatives like breadcrumbs or cornstarch. However, flour helps bind coatings. For gluten-free options, almond or coconut flour work but require adjustments."

<h2>Why Accurate Flour Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>

<p>Small amounts of flour, like 0.125 cup (0.56 oz), are often used for dusting, light coatings, or thickening sauces in air fryer cooking.

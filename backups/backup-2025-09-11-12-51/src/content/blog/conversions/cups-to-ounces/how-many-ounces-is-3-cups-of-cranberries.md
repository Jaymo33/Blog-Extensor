faqQ1: "Can I use dried cranberries instead of fresh in air fryer recipes?"
faqA1: "Yes, but the conversion differs: 3 cups of fresh cranberries equal about 1 cup of dried cranberries (6 ounces). Dried cranberries cook faster, so reduce air fryer time by 20% and add a splash of water to prevent over-drying."
faqQ2: "Do UK and US ounces differ for measuring cranberries?"
faqA2: "No, both use the same avoirdupois ounce (28.35g) for weight measurements. Whether you’re in the UK or US, 3 cups of cranberries will always be roughly 12 ounces."
faqQ3: "How do I prevent cranberries from bursting in the air fryer?"
faqA3: "Toss them lightly in oil and cook at a lower temperature (160°C) for shorter intervals. Shake the basket every 3–4 minutes to distribute heat evenly and minimise bursting."
faqQ4: "What’s the best air fryer setting for cooking cranberries?"
faqA4: "Use the \"roast\" or \"bake\" setting at 175°C for sauces or compotes. For crispy cranberries (like garnishes), opt for 190°C and check every 5 minutes to avoid burning."

faqQ1: "Can I use whole milk instead of semi skimmed milk in air fryer recipes?"
faqA1: "Yes, you can substitute whole milk for semi skimmed milk in air fryer recipes, but keep in mind it has a higher fat content. This may slightly alter the texture of your dish. Use the same 1.25 cups (10.14 oz) measurement for consistency."
faqQ2: "How do I measure 1.25 cups of semi skimmed milk without a measuring cup?"
faqA2: "If you don’t have a measuring cup, use a kitchen scale to weigh out 10.14 oz of semi skimmed milk. Alternatively, use 20 UK tablespoons as a rough equivalent to 1.25 cups. For best results in air fryer cooking, investing in proper measuring tools is recommended."
faqQ3: "Does the temperature of semi skimmed milk affect air fryer cooking?"
faqA3: "Yes, using cold semi skimmed milk straight from the fridge can slightly increase cooking times in the air fryer. For recipes like batters, letting the milk come to room temperature (while still measuring 1.25 cups/10.14 oz) can help ingredients combine more evenly."
faqQ4: "Can I use plant-based milk instead of semi skimmed milk in air fryer recipes?"
faqA4: "You can substitute plant-based milk, but the results may vary. Almond, soy or oat milk can replace semi skimmed milk in a 1:1 ratio (1.25 cups/10.14 oz), but the texture and browning might differ slightly. Always check your air fryer recipe for specific recommendations."

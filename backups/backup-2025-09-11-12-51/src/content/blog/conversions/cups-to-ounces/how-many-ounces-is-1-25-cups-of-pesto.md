faqQ1: "Can I use grams instead of ounces for measuring pesto?"
faqA1: "Yes! Ten ounces of pesto is roughly 283 grams. If your kitchen scale uses grams, this conversion ensures accuracy. Most air fryer recipes provide both measurements, but grams are often preferred for precision."
faqQ2: "Does homemade pesto weigh the same as store-bought?"
faqA2: "Homemade pesto can vary slightly due to ingredient ratios (like oil or cheese). While 1.25 cups usually equals 10 ounces, weigh it for certainty. Store-bought pesto is more consistent but check labels for exact weights."
faqQ3: "How long does 1.25 cups of pesto last in the fridge?"
faqA3: "Pesto lasts up to a week refrigerated if stored in an airtight container. For longer storage, freeze it in portions. Thaw before using in air fryer recipes to maintain texture."
faqQ4: "Can I substitute basil pesto with other types?"
faqA4: "Absolutely! Sun-dried tomato or spinach pesto can replace basil varieties. Just ensure you measure 1.25 cups (10 ounces) for consistency. Adjust seasoning if the substitute is less flavourful."

<p>1.25 cups of pesto equals approximately 10 ounces, making it easy to measure for your air fryer recipes. Whether you’re whipping up a quick pasta dish or adding flavour to chicken, knowing this conversion ensures accuracy. Pesto’s thick consistency means volume-to-weight conversions are essential for precision, especially in air frying where even distribution matters.

<h2>Why accurate pesto measurements matter</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of pesto ensures your air fryer dishes aren’t overly greasy or dry. Since pesto is dense, 1.25 cups translates to roughly 10 ounces, but slight variations can occur based on brand or homemade recipes. Too much pesto can overwhelm lighter ingredients like vegetables or fish, while too little might leave your dish lacking flavour. For perfectly balanced meals, always measure carefully—especially when air frying, where heat circulates intensely.

<h3>How to measure pesto correctly</h3>  
<p>For the most accurate 1.25 cups to ounces conversion, use a kitchen scale. Scoop pesto into a measuring cup, then level it off with a spatula. If you don’t have a scale, remember that 1 cup of pesto is about 8 ounces, so 1.25 cups equals 10 ounces. This method works for both store-bought and homemade pesto, though homemade versions may vary slightly in density.

<h2>Common uses for 1.25 cups of pesto</h2>  
<p>Ten ounces of pesto is perfect for coating a family-sized portion of pasta or marinating chicken before air frying. It’s also ideal for spreading over salmon fillets or mixing into roasted potatoes for a flavour boost. If you’re meal prepping, divide 1.25 cups of pesto into smaller portions to use throughout the week.

<h3>Adjusting recipes for different pesto amounts</h3>  
<p>If a recipe calls for 1.25 cups of pesto but you only have a 6-ounce jar, you’ll need about 1.7 jars to match the required 10 ounces. Conversely, if you have excess pesto, freeze it in ice cube trays for future use. This way, you’ll always have the right amount on hand for air fryer meals.

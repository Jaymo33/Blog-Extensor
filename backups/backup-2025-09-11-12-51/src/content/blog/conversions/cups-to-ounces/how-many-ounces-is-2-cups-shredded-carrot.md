faqQ1: "Does the size of the shred affect the weight of 2 cups of shredded carrot?"
faqA1: "Yes, the shred size can slightly affect the weight. Finely shredded carrot packs more tightly into a cup, potentially increasing the weight by about 0.5-1 ounce compared to coarsely shredded. However, for most recipes, the standard 8 ounces for 2 cups works well regardless of shred size."
faqQ2: "Can I use pre-packaged shredded carrot instead of fresh in air fryer recipes?"
faqA2: "Absolutely! Pre-packaged shredded carrot works fine, though it might be slightly drier than fresh. When using 2 cups (8 ounces) of pre-shredded carrot in air fryer recipes, you might need to reduce cooking time by 1-2 minutes as it contains less moisture."
faqQ3: "How should I store leftover shredded carrot for future air fryer use?"
faqA3: "Store leftover shredded carrot in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 5 days. For longer storage, freeze measured 2-cup (8-ounce) portions in freezer bags. When ready to use, thaw and pat dry before air frying to remove excess moisture."
faqQ4: "Why does my shredded carrot sometimes stick together in the air fryer?"
faqA4: "This usually happens when there's too much moisture or the carrot isn't tossed properly before cooking. For 2 cups (8 ounces) of shredded carrot, toss with 1 teaspoon of oil and spread evenly in the basket. Shake halfway through cooking to prevent sticking."

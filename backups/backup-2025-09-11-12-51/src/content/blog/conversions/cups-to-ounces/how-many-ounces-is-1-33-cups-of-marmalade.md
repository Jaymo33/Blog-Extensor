faqQ1: "Does marmalade weight change between UK and US measurements?"
faqA1: "The weight of marmalade is generally consistent between UK and US measurements, as both countries use the same avoirdupois ounce for weight. However, cup sizes can vary slightly - the UK uses 250ml cups while the US uses 240ml. For 1.33 cups, this minor difference typically results in less than a 0.5 ounce variation in weight."
faqQ2: "Can I use marmalade straight from the jar in air fryer recipes?"
faqA2: "Yes, you can use marmalade directly from the jar, but warming it slightly makes it easier to measure and mix with other ingredients.

Just remember that 1.33 cups of marmalade equals about 10.64 ounces when measuring for your recipe."
faqQ3: "How should I store leftover marmalade after opening?"
faqA3: "Store opened marmalade in the refrigerator with the lid tightly sealed. Properly stored, it will last for several months. Before using again in your air fryer, let it come to room temperature or warm slightly for easier measuring. Always use clean utensils to prevent contamination that could shorten its shelf life."
faqQ4: "Are there low-sugar alternatives that measure the same as regular marmalade?"
faqA4: "Low-sugar marmalades may have slightly different weights due to alternative thickeners. When converting 1.33 cups to ounces for these products, check the packaging for specific weight information. As a general rule, they'll be close to the standard 10.64 ounces but may require slight recipe adjustments for texture and sweetness."

faqQ1: "Can I use frozen cranberries instead of fresh for 2 cups?"
faqA1: "Yes, you can use frozen cranberries, but they may weigh slightly more due to ice content. Thaw and drain them before measuring to ensure accuracy. If using frozen directly, account for a small increase in weight (about 10%)."
faqQ2: "How many ounces are in 1 cup of cranberries?"
faqA2: "One cup of fresh cranberries weighs roughly 4 ounces (113 grams). This measurement is handy for halving or doubling recipes. Dried cranberries weigh less, so adjust accordingly."
faqQ3: "Do UK and US cup measurements differ for cranberries?"
faqA3: "No, a standard cup measurement is the same in both the UK and US for cranberries. However, UK recipes often list weights in grams or ounces, so conversions like 2 cups = 8 ounces are useful."
faqQ4: "How can I use 2 cups of cranberries in my air fryer?"
faqA4: "Two cups of cranberries work well for sauces, baked goods, or as a glaze for meats. Try air-frying them with a sprinkle of sugar for a quick compote, or mix into stuffing for added tartness. Visit our recipe section for ideas!"

<p>2 cups of cranberries weigh approximately 8 ounces (or 226 grams). This measurement is essential for air fryer recipes, ensuring your dishes turn out perfectly every time. Whether you're making cranberry sauce, muffins, or a festive roast, accurate measurements matter.</p>  

<h2>Why measuring cranberries correctly matters</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of cranberries ensures balanced flavours and textures in your air fryer dishes. Too many cranberries can make a dish overly tart, while too few might leave it lacking. For recipes like cranberry-studded stuffing or air-fried desserts, precision is key. Visit <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes</a> for inspiration on using cranberries in your air fryer.</p>  

<p>Fresh cranberries are lighter than dried ones, so always measure by volume or weight for consistency. If you're adapting a recipe from cups to ounces, this conversion will save time and hassle.

<h3>How to measure cranberries accurately</h3>

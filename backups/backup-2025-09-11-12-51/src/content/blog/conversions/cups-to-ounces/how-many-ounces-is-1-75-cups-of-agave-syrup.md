faqQ1: "Can I use honey instead of agave syrup in air fryer recipes?"
faqA1: "Yes, honey can substitute agave syrup in most recipes, but it’s sweeter and thicker. Use about ¾ the amount of honey (e.g., 10.5 oz instead of 14 oz for 1.75 cups of agave syrup). Adjust cooking times slightly, as honey caramelises faster."
faqQ2: "Why does agave syrup weight differ from water?"
faqA2: "Agave syrup is denser due to its high sugar content. While 1 cup of water weighs 8 ounces, 1 cup of agave syrup weighs about 11 ounces. Always check conversions for accuracy in recipes."
faqQ3: "How do I store leftover agave syrup?"
faqA3: "Keep agave syrup in an airtight container at room temperature for up to a year. Avoid refrigeration, as it can crystallise. Stir well before reusing if separated."
faqQ4: "Can I reduce agave syrup in air fryer recipes for fewer calories?"
faqA4: "Yes, but reduce other liquids slightly to maintain texture. For 1.75 cups (14 oz), try using 10 oz and add a touch of water if needed. Monitor cooking times, as less sugar may alter browning."

faqQ1: "Can I use plant-based milk instead of regular milk in air fryer recipes?"
faqA1: "Yes, plant-based milk like almond or oat milk can replace regular milk in air fryer recipes. Just ensure you measure 6 oz (0.75 cup) for consistency. Note that some plant milks may alter flavour or texture slightly."
faqQ2: "How do I measure 0.75 cup of milk without a measuring cup?"
faqA2: "If you don’t have a measuring cup, use a kitchen scale to weigh out 6 oz of milk. Alternatively, a standard mug holds roughly 1 cup, so fill it three-quarters full for an approximate measure."
faqQ3: "Why does my air fryer recipe turn out soggy when using milk?"
faqA3: "Sogginess often occurs from excess liquid. Double-check your measurements—0.75 cup should be exactly 6 oz. Also, ensure your air fryer is preheated and avoid overcrowding the basket for even cooking."
faqQ4: "Is 0.75 cup of milk the same in weight and fluid ounces?"
faqA4: "For milk, fluid ounces and weight ounces are nearly identical (1 fl oz ≈ 1.04 oz by weight). In most recipes, the difference is negligible, so 0.75 cup (6 fl oz) can be treated as 6 oz by weight."

<p>0.75 cup of milk equals 6 fluid ounces (oz). This conversion is essential for precise cooking, especially when using an air fryer where measurements can impact texture and cooking times. Whether you're preparing a creamy sauce or a fluffy cake, knowing the exact weight ensures consistency.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on even heat distribution, and incorrect measurements can lead to uneven cooking. For example, using too much milk in a batter might make it too runny, while too little could dry it out. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we emphasise precision to help you achieve perfect results every time.</p>  

<p>Recipes like air fryer pancakes or custards require exact liquid ratios. A slight deviation can alter the dish's outcome. That’s why converting 0.75 cup of milk to ounces (6 oz) is so useful—it eliminates guesswork and ensures reliability.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure 0.75 Cup of Milk Correctly</h3>  
<p>Use a liquid measuring cup for accuracy. Fill it to the 0.75 mark, ensuring the milk sits level at eye height. For weight-based recipes, a kitchen scale set to ounces will confirm you have exactly 6 oz. This method is foolproof and recommended for all air fryer baking.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for 0.75 Cup of Milk in Air Fryer Recipes</h2>  
<p>This measurement often appears in recipes like air fryer French toast, where the milk binds the ingredients.

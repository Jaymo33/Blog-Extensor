faqQ1: "Can I use canned chickpeas instead of dried for 1.66 cups?"
faqA1: "Yes, you can use canned chickpeas as a substitute. One standard 15-ounce can is roughly equivalent to 1.66 cups (14.5 oz) of cooked chickpeas. Just drain and rinse them well before air frying to remove excess sodium and improve crispiness."
faqQ2: "How do I adjust cooking time for 1.66 cups of chickpeas in an air fryer?"
faqA2: "For 1.66 cups (14.5 oz) of chickpeas, cook at 190°C for 12-15 minutes, shaking halfway. Adjust time based on your air fryer model and desired crispiness. Smaller batches may cook faster, so keep an eye on them to prevent burning."
faqQ3: "Why are my air-fried chickpeas not crispy?"
faqA3: "Sogginess often results from overcrowding or excess moisture. Ensure chickpeas are dry before cooking and spread them evenly in the basket. Pat them dry with a towel if using canned chickpeas, and avoid adding too much oil at once."
faqQ4: "Can I freeze air-fried chickpeas made from 1.66 cups?"
faqA4: "Absolutely! Freeze cooked chickpeas in a single layer before transferring to a container. Reheat them directly from frozen in the air fryer at 180°C for 5-7 minutes to restore crispiness. They’ll keep for up to 2 months."

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Precision is key when using an air fryer, as unevenly sized ingredients can cook at different rates. Chickpeas, for example, need even distribution to crisp up properly. Measuring by weight (ounces) rather than volume (cups) ensures uniformity. This is especially useful for recipes like spiced air-fried chickpeas, where consistency affects texture.

<p>Using 1.66 cups of chickpeas in ounces (14.5 oz) helps avoid over or undercooking. Air fryers rely on hot air circulation, so overcrowding or uneven portions can lead to soggy results. For perfect crispy chickpeas, stick to the recommended weight.

<h3>How to measure chickpeas for air frying</h3>  
<p>For the most accurate results, use a kitchen scale to weigh your chickpeas. If you don’t have one, fluff the chickpeas in the cup before measuring to avoid compaction. Level off the top with a straight edge for consistency. Remember, 1.66 cups of chickpeas equals roughly 14.5 ounces, but slight variations can occur based on how they’re packed.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for chickpeas in air fryers</h2>  
<p>Chickpeas are incredibly versatile in air fryer cooking. From crunchy snacks to protein-packed additions, they’re a staple in many recipes. Roasting 1.66 cups (14.5 oz) of chickpeas with spices creates a delicious, healthy snack. They can also be used in salads, wraps, or even blended into hummus after air frying.</p>

<h3>Tips for storing cooked chickpeas</h3>  
<p>Once air-fried, chickpeas can be stored in an airtight container for up to 3 days. To maintain crispiness, reheat them in the air fryer for a few minutes before serving. Avoid refrigeration if possible, as moisture can make them soggy. For longer storage, freeze them and reheat straight from frozen.</p>

<p>If you need to adjust your recipe, here are some common conversions: 1 cup of chickpeas equals about 8.7 ounces, while 2 cups equal roughly 17.4 ounces.

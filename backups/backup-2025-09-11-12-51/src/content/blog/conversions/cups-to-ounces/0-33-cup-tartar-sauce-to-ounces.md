faqQ1: "Can I use grams instead of ounces for measuring tartar sauce?"
faqA1: "Yes, you can! 0.33 cup of tartar sauce is roughly 75 grams. Many kitchen scales toggle between ounces and grams, making it easy to switch. Grams are often preferred for baking, but ounces work just as well for air fryer recipes."
faqQ2: "Does the brand of tartar sauce affect the weight per cup?"
faqA2: "Slightly. Thicker brands may weigh more per cup than runnier ones, but the difference is minimal. For 0.33 cup, expect around 2.6-2.8 ounces regardless of brand. When precision matters, weigh your sauce instead of relying on cup measurements."
faqQ3: "How do I adjust air fryer cooking times when using tartar sauce?"
faqA3: "Tartar sauce adds moisture, so foods may take slightly longer to crisp. Increase cooking time by 1-2 minutes if needed, checking frequently. For best results, pat excess sauce off proteins before air frying to maintain texture."
faqQ4: "Can I substitute mayonnaise for tartar sauce in air fryer recipes?"
faqA4: "Yes, but the flavour will differ. Mayonnaise lacks the tanginess of tartar sauce. For closer results, mix mayo with a bit of lemon juice and chopped pickles. Use the same 0.33 cup (2.64 oz) measurement for consistency."

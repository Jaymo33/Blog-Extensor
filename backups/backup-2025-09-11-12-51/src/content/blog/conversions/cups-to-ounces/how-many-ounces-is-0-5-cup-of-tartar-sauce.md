faqQ1: "Can I use a tablespoon to measure 0.5 cup of tartar sauce?"
faqA1: "Yes, but it’s less precise. Since 0.5 cup equals 8 tablespoons, you’d need to measure out 8 level tablespoons of tartar sauce to reach 4 ounces. A kitchen scale is more accurate for thick sauces like tartar, as spoon measurements can vary slightly."
faqQ2: "Does the brand of tartar sauce affect the weight per 0.5 cup?"
faqA2: "Slightly. Thicker brands may weigh a bit more, while runnier ones could be lighter. However, most tartar sauces will be close to 4 ounces per 0.5 cup. For air fryer recipes, sticking to the 4-ounce measurement ensures consistency regardless of brand."
faqQ3: "How long does 0.5 cup of tartar sauce last in the fridge?"
faqA3: "An opened jar of tartar sauce typically lasts 1-2 months in the fridge. If you’ve measured out 0.5 cup (4 ounces), store it in an airtight container. Always check for off smells or mould before using it in your air fryer recipes."
faqQ4: "Can I freeze 0.5 cup of tartar sauce for later use?"
faqA4: "It’s not recommended. Freezing can change the texture of tartar sauce, making it grainy or separated when thawed. For best results in air fryer cooking, use fresh sauce. If you have leftover 0.5 cup, it’s better to refrigerate and use within a few days."

<p>Many home cooks underestimate the importance of converting cups to ounces, but it’s a game-changer for air fryer success.

<h3>How to measure tartar sauce without a scale</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a kitchen scale, you can still measure 0.5 cup of tartar sauce accurately. Use a liquid measuring cup and fill it to the 0.5 cup mark, ensuring the sauce is level with the rim. Avoid packing it down, as this can lead to over-measuring. For thicker sauces like tartar, a spoon can help level off the top. This method will get you close to the 4-ounce mark, though a scale is always more precise.</p>

faqQ1: "Can I use minced garlic instead of garlic paste in air fryer recipes?"
faqA1: "Yes, but adjust the quantity. Minced garlic is less dense, so you’ll need about 1.5 times the volume to match the flavour of garlic paste. For 1 cup of garlic paste (8.5 ounces), use roughly 1.5 cups of minced garlic."
faqQ2: "How long does homemade garlic paste last in the fridge?"
faqA2: "Homemade garlic paste lasts up to 2 weeks refrigerated in an airtight container. For longer storage, freeze it in portions. Thaw as needed for air fryer recipes to maintain freshness."
faqQ3: "Why does my air fryer recipe taste too garlicky?"
faqA3: "Over-measuring garlic paste is a common culprit. Stick to the 8.5-ounce-per-cup ratio. If the dish is still overpowering, balance it with acidity (lemon juice) or sweetness (honey) next time."
faqQ4: "Can I freeze garlic paste in pre-measured amounts?"
faqA4: "Absolutely! Freeze garlic paste in 1-ounce portions (about 2 tablespoons) using ice cube trays. Once frozen, transfer to a bag. This makes it easy to grab the right amount for air fryer recipes."

<p>1 cup of garlic paste equals approximately 8.5 ounces. This measurement is essential for precise cooking, especially when using an air fryer where ingredient ratios can affect texture and flavour. Whether you're whipping up a marinade or preparing a sauce, knowing the exact weight ensures consistency in your dishes.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on even heat distribution, so ingredient quantities must be precise. Too much garlic paste can overpower a dish or cause uneven cooking. For example, a recipe calling for 1 cup of garlic paste to ounces ensures your marinade coats evenly without excess moisture.

<p>Garlic paste is denser than minced garlic, so volume-to-weight conversions differ. While 1 cup of minced garlic weighs around 5 ounces, the paste version is thicker, hence the 8.5-ounce measurement. This distinction is crucial for air fryer recipes where moisture content affects crispiness.</p>  

<h2>How to Measure Garlic Paste Correctly</h2>  
<p>Use a liquid measuring cup for accuracy when converting 1 cup of garlic paste to oz. Scoop the paste and level it off with a straight edge. Avoid packing it down, as this can lead to over-measuring. For smaller quantities, a kitchen scale is ideal—simply tare your bowl and add until you hit 8.5 ounces.</p>  

<p>If you're scaling a recipe, remember that 1 cup garlic paste how many ounces remains consistent. Doubling the recipe? You’ll need 17 ounces. Halving it? 4.25 ounces will do. This precision is especially helpful for meal prep or batch cooking in your air fryer.</p>  

<h3>Common Uses for Garlic Paste in Air Fryer Recipes</h3>  
<p>Garlic paste works wonders in marinades for chicken, shrimp, or tofu—key ingredients in many <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a>. Its concentrated flavour means a little goes a long way. Mix it with oil, herbs, and spices for a quick glaze or rub.</p>  

<h3>Substitutes for Garlic Paste</h3>  
<p>If you're out of garlic paste, 1 tablespoon of minced garlic plus 1/2 teaspoon of water approximates 1 ounce of paste. However, for recipes specifying 1 cup garlic paste to ounces, substitutes may alter texture. Fresh garlic works too, but adjust quantities since its flavour is less concentrated.</p>

faqQ1: "Can I use chicken stock instead of beef stock in my air fryer recipe?"
faqA1: "Yes, you can substitute chicken stock, but the flavour profile will change. Beef stock has a richer, deeper taste, while chicken stock is lighter. Adjust seasonings accordingly for the best results."
faqQ2: "How do I store leftover beef stock after measuring 1.66 cups?"
faqA2: "Store leftover beef stock in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 4 days. For longer storage, freeze it in portions. Just thaw and reheat when needed for your next air fryer dish."
faqQ3: "Why does my air fryer recipe call for ounces instead of cups?"
faqA3: "Ounces provide a more precise measurement, especially for liquids like beef stock. Air fryers cook quickly, so accurate amounts ensure even cooking and perfect texture every time."
faqQ4: "Can I reduce beef stock in the air fryer for a thicker sauce?"
faqA4: "Yes, but it’s tricky. Air fryers aren’t designed for reducing liquids. Instead, reduce the stock on the stove first, then add it to your air fryer dish for the best consistency."

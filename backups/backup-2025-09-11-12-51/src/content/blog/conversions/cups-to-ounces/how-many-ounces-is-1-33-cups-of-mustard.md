faqQ1: "Does the type of mustard affect the weight per cup?"
faqA1: "Yes, the type of mustard can slightly impact the weight. Dijon and wholegrain mustards are denser than yellow mustard, so 1.33 cups may weigh a bit more. Always use a scale for precision if your recipe is sensitive to measurements."
faqQ2: "Can I use a measuring cup instead of a scale for mustard?"
faqA2: "While a measuring cup works, a kitchen scale is more accurate for converting 1.33 cups of mustard to ounces (10.64 oz). Mustard’s thickness can cause variations in volume measurements, so weighing ensures consistency, especially in air fryer recipes."
faqQ3: "How do I measure sticky mustard without making a mess?"
faqA3: "Lightly spray your measuring cup with oil or use a silicone spatula to scrape out every bit. For even easier cleanup, weigh it directly in your mixing bowl using a kitchen scale set to ounces."
faqQ4: "Why is weight (ounces) better than volume (cups) for mustard?"
faqA4: "Weight accounts for density differences between mustard types, giving you precise amounts every time. Volume measurements can vary based on how the mustard settles or is packed into the cup. For air fryer recipes, accuracy ensures perfect flavour balance."

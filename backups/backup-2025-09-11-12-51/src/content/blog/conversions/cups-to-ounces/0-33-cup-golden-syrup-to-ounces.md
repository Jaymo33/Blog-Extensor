faqQ1: "Can I use honey instead of golden syrup in my air fryer recipe?"
faqA1: "Yes, you can substitute honey for golden syrup, but the flavour and texture will differ slightly. Honey is sweeter and thinner, so you may need to adjust the quantity. Start with a 1:1 ratio and taste as you go."
faqQ2: "How do I clean golden syrup from my air fryer basket?"
faqA2: "Golden syrup can be sticky, but warm soapy water and a soft sponge usually do the trick. For stubborn residue, soak the basket in warm water for 10 minutes before scrubbing. Avoid abrasive cleaners to protect the non-stick coating."
faqQ3: "Why is weighing golden syrup better than measuring by volume?"
faqA3: "Weighing golden syrup in ounces is more accurate because its thick consistency can lead to uneven cup measurements. A kitchen scale ensures precision, especially for air fryer recipes where small quantities matter."
faqQ4: "What’s the best way to store golden syrup for air fryer recipes?"
faqA4: "Store golden syrup in a cool, dry place, tightly sealed to prevent crystallization. If it hardens, gently warm the jar in hot water to restore its pourable consistency. Proper storage keeps it ready for your next air fryer creation."

Volume measurements like cups can vary due to the syrup's viscosity, but weight remains consistent.

<p>Golden syrup is denser than water, so 0.33 cup translates to roughly 3.5 ounces. This density means it pours slowly, making it tricky to measure precisely without a scale. If you're adapting a traditional recipe for the air fryer, converting cups to ounces ensures you don’t over or under-sweeten your dish. Many air fryer recipes, like cakes or glazes, rely on exact measurements for the best results. Always level off your measuring cup to avoid excess syrup.</p>  

<h3>Tools for measuring golden syrup</h3>  
<p>A kitchen scale is the most accurate way to measure 0.33 cup of golden syrup in ounces. If you don’t have one, use a liquid measuring cup and a spatula to scrape out every last drop.

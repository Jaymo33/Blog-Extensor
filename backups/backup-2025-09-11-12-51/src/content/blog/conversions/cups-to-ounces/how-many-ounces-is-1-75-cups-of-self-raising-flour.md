faqQ1: "Can I use plain flour instead of self-raising flour for 1.75 cups in an air fryer?"
faqA1: "Yes, but you'll need to add baking powder. For 1.75 cups (7.7 ounces) of plain flour, mix in 3.5 teaspoons of baking powder. Sift them together to ensure even distribution, especially important for air fryer baking where heat circulates rapidly."
faqQ2: "How do I measure 1.75 cups of self-raising flour without a scale?"
faqA2: "Use the spoon-and-level method: gently spoon flour into a measuring cup until heaping, then level off with a knife. For 1.75 cups, fill one cup completely, then another three-quarters full. This minimizes compaction for more accurate volume measurements."
faqQ3: "Why does my air fryer cake with 1.75 cups of flour turn out dry?"
faqA3: "Air fryers dehydrate foods faster than ovens. Try reducing the temperature by 10°C and checking for doneness 5 minutes early. Also, ensure you're using exactly 7.7 ounces of flour—over-measuring absorbs too much moisture."
faqQ4: "Is 1.75 cups of self-raising flour the same in US and UK measurements?"
faqA4: "No, US cups are 240ml while UK cups are 250ml, but the difference is negligible for small quantities like 1.75 cups. For precision, always weigh flour in ounces or grams, especially in air fryer recipes where exact ratios matter."

<p>1.75 cups of self-raising flour equals approximately 7.7 ounces (220 grams). This conversion is essential for UK bakers who rely on precise measurements for consistent results, especially when using an air fryer for baking. Whether you're making cakes, cookies, or savoury dishes, knowing the exact weight ensures your recipes turn out perfectly every time.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate flour measurements matter</h2>  
<p>Baking is a science, and even small discrepancies in flour measurements can affect texture and rise. Self-raising flour, which contains baking powder, requires extra precision to avoid dense or overly airy results. For air fryer recipes, where cooking times are shorter, accuracy is even more critical. Too much flour can lead to dry, crumbly bakes, while too little may cause collapsing.</p>  

<p>Many UK recipes use weight measurements (ounces or grams) rather than volume (cups) for better consistency. If you're adapting a recipe from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, converting cups to ounces ensures your bakes turn out as intended. This is particularly useful for air fryer cakes or bread, where even distribution of ingredients is key.</p>  

<h3>How to measure 1.75 cups of self-raising flour</h3>  
<p>To measure 1.75 cups of self-raising flour accurately, spoon the flour into the measuring cup and level it off with a knife. Avoid scooping directly from the bag, as this compacts the flour and leads to over-measuring. For best results, use a digital kitchen scale to weigh out 7.7 ounces (220 grams) instead.</p>  

<h2>Converting cups to ounces for UK bakers</h2>  
<p>The UK typically uses metric measurements, but many online recipes—especially from the US—rely on cups. Knowing that 1 cup of self-raising flour weighs roughly 4.4 ounces (125 grams) simplifies conversions. For 1.75 cups, multiply 4.4 by 1.75 to get 7.7 ounces. This method works for all types of flour, but always check your specific brand for slight variations.</p>  

<p>If you're using an air fryer, precise measurements prevent undercooked or burnt edges. For example, a <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>victoria sponge</a> requires exact flour amounts to rise properly in the compact air fryer basket. Refer to our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a> for other common baking ingredients.</p>  

<h3>Common mistakes when measuring flour</h3>  
<p>One frequent error is using the wrong cup size—US cups differ slightly from UK cups. Always use a standard 240ml measuring cup for consistency. Another pitfall is forgetting to aerate the flour before measuring, which can add up to 20% extra weight. For air fryer recipes, where heat circulates intensely, these small errors can magnify.</p>  

<h2>Adjusting air fryer recipes with self-raising flour</h2>  
<p>Air fryers cook faster than conventional ovens, so recipes often need tweaking. If a recipe calls for 1.75 cups of self-raising flour (7.7 ounces), reduce the cooking time by 15-20% to prevent over-browning. For example, <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cookies>air fryer cookies</a> bake in just 6-8 minutes compared to 10-12 in an oven.</p>  

<p>Self-raising flour is ideal for air fryer baking because the built-in leavening ensures even rise in the compact space. Just ensure your flour is fresh—old self-raising flour loses its potency, leading to flat bakes. Store it in an airtight container and test its effectiveness by mixing a spoonful with water; if it bubbles, it's still active.</p>  

<h3>Tools for accurate conversions</h3>  
<p>Invest in a good digital scale for reliable ounce measurements. Many scales toggle between grams and ounces, making it easy to follow UK or US recipes.

faqQ1: "Can I use bottled apple juice instead of fresh for air fryer recipes?"
faqA1: "Yes, bottled apple juice works perfectly in air fryer recipes, as long as it’s 100% juice without added sweeteners. The consistency and flavour are nearly identical to fresh, making it a convenient option. Just measure out 0.5 cup (4 oz) as directed."
faqQ2: "Does the type of apple juice affect the ounce measurement?"
faqA2: "No, whether it’s clear, cloudy, or organic, 0.5 cup of apple juice will always be approximately 4 fluid ounces. However, thicker juices (like unfiltered varieties) may weigh slightly more due to pulp content—use a scale for absolute precision."
faqQ3: "How do I convert 0.5 cup of apple juice to grams?"
faqA3: "0.5 cup (4 oz) of apple juice weighs about 120 grams. This is useful for recipes requiring metric measurements. If you’re using a scale, set it to grams and pour until you reach 120g for accuracy."
faqQ4: "Can I substitute apple cider for apple juice in air fryer recipes?"
faqA4: "Yes, apple cider can replace apple juice in a 1:1 ratio (so 0.5 cup cider = 4 oz). Note that cider has a stronger, spicier flavour, which may alter the dish’s taste slightly. Adjust seasonings accordingly."

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on precise ingredient ratios to achieve crispy, evenly cooked dishes. Using the correct amount of liquid, like 0.5 cup of apple juice, prevents soggy results or overly dry food. For example, a marinade with too much juice can make coatings fall off, while too little might leave meat bland. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> simplifies these calculations, so you never have to guess.</p>  

<p>Many air fryer recipes, especially those for glazes or sauces, call for small quantities like 0.5 cup of apple juice. Converting this to ounces (4 oz) helps if your measuring tools are ounce-based. This is particularly useful for UK cooks using metric scales or fluid ounce measurements. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a> for inspiration on using apple juice in dishes like sticky chicken wings or glazed carrots.</p>

<h3>Adjusting recipes when you only have larger quantities of apple juice</h3>  
<p>If your recipe calls for 0.5 cup of apple juice but you’ve opened a larger bottle, don’t worry. Simply measure out 4 ounces and store the rest in the fridge for up to a week. You can also freeze apple juice in ice cube trays for future use—each cube is roughly 1 ounce, making it easy to portion out 0.5 cup equivalents later.</p>

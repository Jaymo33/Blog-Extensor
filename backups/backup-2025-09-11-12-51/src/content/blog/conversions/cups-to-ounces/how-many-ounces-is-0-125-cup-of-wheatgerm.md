faqQ1: "Why is it important to measure wheatgerm accurately for air fryer recipes?"
faqA1: "Accurate measurements ensure even cooking and proper texture in air fryer dishes. Too much wheatgerm can make coatings dry, while too little might not provide enough crunch. Precise amounts like 0.125 cup (0.5 ounces) help recipes turn out perfectly every time."

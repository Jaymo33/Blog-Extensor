faqQ1: "Can I use a kitchen scale to measure 1.5 cups of quinoa?"
faqA1: "Yes, a kitchen scale is the most accurate way to measure 1.5 cups of quinoa, which equals 9 ounces (255 grams). Simply place your bowl on the scale, tare it to zero, and add quinoa until you reach the desired weight. This method eliminates guesswork and ensures perfect results every time."
faqQ2: "Does rinsing quinoa affect the weight measurement?"
faqA2: "Rinsing quinoa adds minimal water weight, so it’s best to measure 1.5 cups (9 ounces) before rinsing. The rinsing process removes saponins, which can cause bitterness, but won’t significantly alter the dry weight. After rinsing, drain thoroughly to avoid excess moisture in your air fryer recipes."
faqQ3: "How many servings does 1.5 cups (9 ounces) of quinoa make?"
faqA3: "1.5 cups (9 ounces) of uncooked quinoa yields about 4.5 cups cooked, serving 4–6 people depending on the recipe. It’s ideal for meal prep or family dinners. For smaller portions, halve the measurement to 0.75 cups (4.5 ounces)."
faqQ4: "Can I substitute quinoa with other grains in air fryer recipes?"
faqA4: "Yes, grains like couscous or bulgur can substitute quinoa, but adjust measurements as their weights vary. For example, 1.5 cups of couscous weighs about 7.5 ounces. Always check cooking times, as different grains may require adjustments in the air fryer."

faqQ1: "Can I use frozen cranberries instead of fresh for 1.75 cups in an air fryer?"
faqA1: "Yes, you can use frozen cranberries, but they may release more moisture during cooking. If your recipe calls for 1.75 cups (7 ounces) of fresh cranberries, you can substitute frozen ones without thawing. Just extend the cooking time slightly and shake the basket occasionally for even results."
faqQ2: "How do I adjust cooking time for 1.75 cups of cranberries in the air fryer?"
faqA2: "For 1.75 cups (7 ounces) of cranberries, start with 5-7 minutes at 180°C. Shake the basket halfway through to ensure even cooking. If making a sauce or compote, reduce the time slightly as they’ll soften quickly."
faqQ3: "Do I need to oil cranberries before air frying 1.75 cups?"
faqA3: "A light coating of oil helps prevent sticking and enhances texture, especially for 1.75 cups (7 ounces) of cranberries. Use a neutral oil like vegetable or coconut oil, and toss them gently before air frying for best results."
faqQ4: "Can I air fry dried cranberries instead of fresh for recipes?"
faqA4: "Dried cranberries work differently than fresh—1.75 cups of dried cranberries won’t weigh the same as fresh. If using dried, reduce the quantity and watch closely, as they can burn quickly in the air fryer due to their low moisture content."

faqQ1: "Can I use milk instead of buttermilk for 0.125 cup measurements?"
faqA1: "Yes, but you’ll need to adjust it. Mix 0.125 cup milk with ½ teaspoon lemon juice or vinegar to mimic buttermilk’s acidity. Let it sit for 5 minutes before using. This works well in air fryer recipes like coatings or batters."
faqQ2: "How do I measure 0.125 cup of buttermilk without a measuring cup?"
faqA2: "Use a tablespoon: 0.125 cup equals 2 tablespoons. Alternatively, a shot glass often holds 1 oz (the same as 0.125 cup). For accuracy in air fryer recipes, a kitchen scale set to 28 grams is best."
faqQ3: "Does buttermilk weigh the same as water in ounces?"
faqA3: "Almost. Buttermilk is slightly denser due to its fat content, but the difference is negligible for small amounts like 0.125 cup. In air fryer cooking, you can treat 1 fluid ounce of buttermilk as 1 oz by weight."
faqQ4: "Why is buttermilk used in air fryer recipes?"
faqA4: "Buttermilk tenderizes meats and adds moisture to coatings, helping them crisp up beautifully in the air fryer. A 0.125 cup portion is perfect for marinating small batches of chicken or fish. Its acidity also enhances browning."

<h2>Why Accurate Buttermilk Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Buttermilk adds moisture and acidity to recipes, making it a staple in baked goods and marinades. Using the correct amount ensures your dishes turn out perfectly every time. Too little buttermilk can result in dry, crumbly textures, while too much may make batters overly wet. If you're prepping a <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipe</a> for the air fryer, precise buttermilk measurements help achieve that crispy, golden finish.</p>  

<p>For those using air fryers, buttermilk is often used in coatings or brines. A 0.125 cup (1 oz) portion is ideal for small batches, like a single serving of fried chicken tenders. If scaling up, simply multiply the measurement accordingly. Need a handy reference?

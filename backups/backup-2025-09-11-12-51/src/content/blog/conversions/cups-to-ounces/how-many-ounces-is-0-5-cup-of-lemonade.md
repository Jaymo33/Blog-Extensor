faqQ1: "Can I use bottled lemonade for air fryer recipes?"
faqA1: "Yes, bottled lemonade works well in air fryer recipes, but check for added preservatives or sweeteners that might alter the flavour. Freshly squeezed lemonade offers a brighter taste, but bottled versions are convenient for quick meals."
faqQ2: "How does lemonade affect cooking times in an air fryer?"
faqA2: "Lemonade can slightly reduce cooking times due to its sugar content, which caramelises faster. When using 0.5 cup (4 ounces), monitor your dish closely to prevent over-browning. Adjust temperatures by 5-10°C if needed."
faqQ3: "Is 0.5 cup of lemonade the same as 0.5 cup of lemon juice?"

faqQ1: "Can I use panko breadcrumbs instead of regular breadcrumbs for 2.5 cups?"
faqA1: "Yes, you can substitute panko breadcrumbs for regular breadcrumbs in a 1:1 ratio. However, panko is lighter, so 2.5 cups may weigh slightly less than 10 ounces. For best results, weigh your panko to ensure accuracy."
faqQ2: "How do I make homemade breadcrumbs for air fryer recipes?"
faqA2: "Simply toast stale bread, then pulse it in a food processor until fine. Two slices of bread yield about 1 cup (4 ounces), so you’d need around 5 slices for 2.5 cups (10 ounces). Homemade breadcrumbs add wonderful flavour to air fryer dishes."
faqQ3: "Why does my breadcrumb coating fall off in the air fryer?"
faqA3: "This usually happens if the food isn’t properly dried or if you skip the egg wash. Pat your ingredients dry, dip in beaten egg, then coat with your 2.5 cups (10 ounces) of breadcrumbs for a coating that sticks."
faqQ4: "Can I freeze breadcrumbs after measuring out 2.5 cups?"
faqA4: "Absolutely! Freeze leftover breadcrumbs in an airtight container for up to 3 months. They’ll stay fresh and ready for your next air fryer recipe. Just give them a quick shake when you’re ready to use them."

faqQ1: "Can I use frozen onions instead of fresh for 0.375 cup measurements?"
faqA1: "Yes, you can use frozen onions as a substitute. However, frozen onions may release more moisture during cooking, so adjust cooking times slightly. For 0.375 cup (3 ounces), measure them while still frozen for accuracy."
faqQ2: "How do I convert 0.375 cup of onion to grams?"
faqA2: "0.375 cup of onion is roughly 85 grams. Since 1 ounce equals about 28.35 grams, 3 ounces of onion converts to approximately 85 grams. Use a kitchen scale for the most precise measurement."
faqQ3: "Why does my air fryer recipe call for onions by weight instead of volume?"
faqA3: "Weight measurements (like ounces) are more accurate than volume (like cups) because onion pieces can vary in size. This ensures consistent flavour and texture in your air-fried dishes."
faqQ4: "Can I substitute onion powder for fresh onion in an air fryer recipe?"
faqA4: "Yes, but use sparingly. 1 tablespoon of onion powder replaces about 1 medium fresh onion (roughly 0.5 cup chopped). For 0.375 cup, use 2.25 teaspoons of powder, but adjust to taste."

<p>0.375 cup of onion equals approximately 3 ounces. This conversion is handy when preparing air fryer recipes that require precise measurements for the best results. Whether you're making crispy onion rings or adding onions to a stir-fry, knowing the exact weight ensures consistency.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Onion Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Getting the right amount of onion can make or break your dish. Too little, and you might miss out on flavour; too much, and it can overpower other ingredients. For air fryer recipes, precise measurements help with even cooking and texture. Onions release moisture as they cook, so the correct weight ensures your food doesn’t become soggy.</p>  

<p>If you’re following a recipe from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, you’ll often see measurements in cups or ounces. Converting between the two is simple once you know the basics. A standard cup of chopped onion weighs about 8 ounces, so 0.375 cup is roughly 3 ounces.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure 0.375 Cup of Onion</h3>  
<p>Using a measuring cup is the easiest way to portion onions. Fill the cup loosely with chopped onion, then level it off with a knife for accuracy. If you don’t have a measuring cup, a kitchen scale is even better. Simply weigh out 3 ounces of onion for the equivalent of 0.375 cup.</p>  

<h2>Converting Other Onion Measurements</h2>  
<p>Need to adjust your recipe? Here’s a quick reference for common onion conversions: 1 cup of chopped onion equals 8 ounces, 0.5 cup equals 4 ounces, and 0.25 cup equals 2 ounces. This makes scaling recipes up or down a breeze.</p>

<h3>Using Onions in Air Fryer Recipes</h3>  
<p>Onions add depth and sweetness to air-fried dishes. Try them in <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable-based recipes</a> like fajitas, stir-fries, or as a topping for burgers. Since air fryers cook quickly, finely chopped or thinly sliced onions work best for even browning.</p>  

<p>If you’re prepping ahead, store chopped onions in an airtight container in the fridge. They’ll stay fresh for up to three days, ready for your next air fryer creation.

<h2>Common Mistakes When Measuring Onions</h2>  
<p>One mistake is packing onions too tightly into a measuring cup, which can lead to more than the recipe calls for. Always spoon them in loosely for accuracy. Another error is using unevenly chopped pieces, which affects both volume and cooking time.</p>  

<p>For perfectly cooked onions in your air fryer, uniformity is key. Aim for evenly sized pieces to ensure they brown evenly. If you’re unsure, a kitchen scale removes the guesswork—just weigh out 3 ounces for 0.375 cup.</p>  

<h3>Scaling Recipes with Onions</h3>  
<p>Doubling or halving a recipe? Adjust onion measurements proportionally. For example, if a dish calls for 0.375 cup (3 ounces) of onion and you’re making half, use 1.5 ounces. Need more? Double it to 6 ounces for 0.75 cup.</p>

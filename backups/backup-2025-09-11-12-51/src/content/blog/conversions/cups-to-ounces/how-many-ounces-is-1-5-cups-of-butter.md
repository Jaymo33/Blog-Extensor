faqQ1: "Can I use margarine instead of butter for 1.5 cups in recipes?"
faqA1: "Yes, you can substitute margarine for butter in most recipes, but the texture and flavour may differ slightly. Margarine has a higher water content, which can affect baking results. For air fryer cooking, butter generally provides better browning and crispiness."
faqQ2: "How do I measure 1.5 cups of butter without a scale?"
faqA2: "Use standard measuring cups and the spoon-and-level method for accuracy. One cup equals 8 ounces, so 1.5 cups is 12 ounces. Most butter packaging has markings to help you cut the right amount. If using sticks, 1.5 cups equals 3 sticks in the US."
faqQ3: "Does 1.5 cups of melted butter weigh the same as solid butter?"
faqA3: "Yes, melted and solid butter weigh the sameâ€”12 ounces for 1.5 cups. However, measuring melted butter by volume can be tricky, so weighing is more reliable. Always measure butter in its original state unless the recipe specifies otherwise."
faqQ4: "Why does my air fryer recipe call for precise butter measurements?"
faqA4: "Air fryers circulate hot air, so too much butter can cause smoking or uneven cooking. Precise measurements ensure proper browning and prevent excess grease. For best results, follow the recipe closely and check our conversion guides if needed."

<p>1.5 cups of butter equals 12 ounces, making it easy to measure for your favourite recipes. Whether you're baking or using your air fryer, precise measurements ensure perfect results every time. At <a href="https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk">airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we know how important accurate conversions are for delicious meals.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Butter Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Getting the right amount of butter ensures your recipes turn out just as intended. Too much or too little can affect texture, moisture, and flavour. For air fryer cooking, precise measurements help avoid greasy or dry results. Check out our <a href="https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart">air fryer conversion chart</a> for more handy tips. Whether you're making cookies or roasting vegetables, accuracy is key.</p>  

<p>Butter measurements can vary slightly between brands, so always double-check if possible. In the UK, butter is often sold in 250g blocks, which is roughly 8.8 ounces. If you're using a kitchen scale, 1.5 cups of butter should weigh around 340 grams.

<h2>Converting 1.5 Cups of Butter to Ounces</h2>  
<p>One cup of butter typically equals 8 ounces, so 1.5 cups would be 12 ounces. This conversion works for both US and UK measurements. If you're working with a block of butter, 12 ounces is roughly 1.5 sticks in the US or 340 grams in the UK.

<h3>Using a Kitchen Scale for Precision</h3>  
<p>If you have a kitchen scale, weighing butter is the most accurate method. Place your bowl on the scale, tare it to zero, then add butter until it reaches 12 ounces (340g). This eliminates guesswork and ensures consistency in your air fryer dishes.</p>  

<h2>Common Butter Measurement Mistakes</h2>  
<p>Many home cooks mistakenly pack butter into measuring cups, leading to excess. Instead, use the spoon-and-level method for accuracy. Softened butter should be lightly pressed into the cup without compacting. For air fryer recipes, precise butter quantities prevent uneven cooking. Need cleaning tips? Try our <a href="https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner">air fryer cleaner guide</a>.</p>  

<p>Another mistake is confusing fluid ounces with weight ounces. Butter is measured by weight, not volume. Always check whether your recipe calls for ounces by weight or fluid ounces.

<h3>Butter Substitutes in Air Fryer Cooking</h3>  
<p>If you're out of butter, margarine or oil can work in some recipes. However, these substitutes may alter texture and flavour. For best results, stick to butter unless the recipe specifies otherwise.</p>

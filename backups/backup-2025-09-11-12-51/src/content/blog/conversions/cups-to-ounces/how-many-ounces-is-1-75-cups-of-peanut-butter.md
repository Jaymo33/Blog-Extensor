faqQ1: "Is 1.75 cups of peanut butter the same as 14 ounces in the UK?"
faqA1: "Yes, 1.75 cups of peanut butter equals 14 ounces in the UK as well. The conversion remains consistent because ounces are a weight measurement, not volume. However, always check if your recipe specifies packed or loose measurements for accuracy."
faqQ2: "Can I use crunchy peanut butter instead of smooth for air fryer recipes?"
faqA2: "Absolutely! Crunchy peanut butter works just as well as smooth in air fryer recipes, though it may add extra texture. Just ensure you measure 1.75 cups (14 ounces) accurately, as the nut pieces can slightly affect the volume-to-weight ratio."
faqQ3: "How do I convert 1.75 cups of peanut butter to grams?"
faqA3: "1.75 cups (14 ounces) of peanut butter is approximately 397 grams. This conversion is useful for UK recipes that prefer metric measurements. A kitchen scale will give you the most precise results for air fryer cooking."
faqQ4: "Why does my air fryer recipe turn out dry when using peanut butter?"
faqA4: "If your recipe is dry, you might be using too much peanut butter or not enough liquid. Double-check your measurements—1.75 cups should be 14 ounces. Also, consider reducing cooking time slightly, as air fryers can dehydrate ingredients faster than conventional ovens."

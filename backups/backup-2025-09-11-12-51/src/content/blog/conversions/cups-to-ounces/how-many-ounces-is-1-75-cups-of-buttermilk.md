faqQ1: "Can I use powdered buttermilk instead of liquid for 1.75 cups?"
faqA1: "Yes, you can use powdered buttermilk. For 1.75 cups (14 ounces) of liquid buttermilk, mix 7 tablespoons of powdered buttermilk with 1.75 cups of water. This substitution works well in air fryer recipes where buttermilk's acidity is needed."
faqQ2: "Does buttermilk measurement change if it's thick or thin?"
faqA2: "The thickness doesn't affect the volume measurement. Whether your buttermilk is thick cultured or thin traditional, 1.75 cups still equals 14 fluid ounces. However, thicker buttermilk might require extra stirring before measuring for accuracy in air fryer recipes."
faqQ3: "How does 1.75 cups of buttermilk compare to regular milk in recipes?"
faqA3: "While the volume (14 ounces) is the same, buttermilk's acidity reacts differently with baking soda. This creates lift in baked goods. In air fryer recipes, buttermilk also tenderises meats better than regular milk due to its lactic acid content."
faqQ4: "Can I reduce 1.75 cups of buttermilk for a smaller air fryer batch?"
faqA4: "Absolutely! Simply halve the measurement to 0.875 cups (7 ounces) for smaller portions. Most air fryer recipes scale down well. Just ensure you maintain the correct ratios of other ingredients when adjusting buttermilk quantities."

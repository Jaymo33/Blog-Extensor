<h2>Why Accurate Flour Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of flour is crucial in air fryer baking. Too much flour can make your baked goods dense, while too little can cause them to fall apart. Measuring by weight (ounces) is more reliable than volume (cups) because flour can settle or be packed differently. If you’re new to air frying, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> for foolproof ideas.</p>  

<p>For best results, fluff the flour with a fork before scooping it into a measuring cup. Level it off with a knife for an accurate 1.25 cups. If you have a kitchen scale, weighing 5.3 ounces ensures consistency every time. This method is especially useful for delicate recipes like air fryer cakes or pastries.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure 1.25 Cups of Flour Without a Scale</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a scale, use the spoon-and-level method. Gently spoon flour into a measuring cup until it’s slightly heaped, then level it off. Repeat until you’ve measured 1.25 cups. This technique prevents compacting, which can lead to using more flour than needed.

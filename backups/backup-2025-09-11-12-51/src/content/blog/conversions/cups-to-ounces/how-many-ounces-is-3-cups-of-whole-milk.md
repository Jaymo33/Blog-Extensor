faqQ1: "Is 3 cups of whole milk the same as 24 ounces in the UK?"
faqA1: "Yes, 3 cups of whole milk equals 24 fluid ounces in the UK, just like in the US. Fluid ounces for liquids like milk are consistent across both measurement systems. Always use a liquid measuring cup for accuracy in recipes."
faqQ2: "Can I use skimmed milk instead of whole milk in air fryer recipes?"
faqA2: "You can substitute skimmed milk, but it may affect texture and richness. Whole milk’s higher fat content adds creaminess to sauces and crispiness to batters. For best results, stick to whole milk unless the recipe specifies otherwise."
faqQ3: "How do I measure 3 cups of whole milk without a measuring cup?"
faqA3: "If you don’t have a measuring cup, use a standard mug (about 8 oz) and fill it three times to get 24 oz. Alternatively, use a kitchen scale to weigh 732 grams, which is equivalent to 3 cups of whole milk."
faqQ4: "Why does my air fryer recipe require exact milk measurements?"
faqA4: "Air fryers cook food quickly, so precise measurements ensure even cooking and the right texture. Too much milk can make dishes soggy, while too little may dry them out. Follow conversions like 3 cups to 24 oz for consistent results."

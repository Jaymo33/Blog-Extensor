faqQ1: "Can I use single cream instead of double cream in air fryer recipes?"
faqA1: "Yes, you can substitute single cream, but it has a lower fat content (around 18-20% compared to double cream's 48%). This may affect the richness and texture of your dish. For best results, adjust cooking times slightly, as single cream heats faster."
faqQ2: "How do I measure 0.375 cup without a measuring cup?"
faqA2: "If you don’t have a 0.375 cup measure, use a 1/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons. Alternatively, weigh it at 3 ounces (85 grams) using a kitchen scale. This method is often more accurate for air fryer recipes where precision matters."
faqQ3: "Does double cream weigh the same as milk in ounces?"
faqA3: "No, double cream is denser due to its higher fat content. While 0.375 cup of milk weighs around 3 ounces, double cream may vary slightly in weight but generally stays close to 3 oz per 0.375 cup. Always check your recipe for specifics."
faqQ4: "Can I freeze double cream for later use in air fryer recipes?"
faqA4: "Freezing double cream is possible, but it may separate when thawed, making it better suited for cooked dishes rather than whipping. Stir well after thawing, and use it in sauces or baked goods for best results in your air fryer."

faqQ1: "Does 1 cup of caster sugar weigh the same as granulated sugar?"
faqA1: "No, 1 cup of caster sugar weighs slightly less than granulated sugar due to its finer texture. Caster sugar is approximately 7.05 ounces per cup, while granulated sugar is closer to 7.76 ounces per cup. Always check your recipe for the correct type and measurement."
faqQ2: "Can I substitute granulated sugar for caster sugar in air fryer recipes?"
faqA2: "Yes, but with caution. Granulated sugar has larger crystals, which may affect texture and dissolve more slowly. For best results, pulse granulated sugar in a blender to mimic caster sugar’s fineness, and measure by weight (7.05 ounces per cup) rather than volume."
faqQ3: "How do I convert 1 cup of caster sugar to grams?"
faqA3: "1 cup of caster sugar equals roughly 200 grams. This conversion is useful for recipes that use metric measurements. For air fryer baking, a digital scale ensures accuracy, especially when adapting recipes from different regions."
faqQ4: "Why does my air fryer bake sometimes turn out too sweet?"
faqA4: "Over-measuring sugar is a common culprit. Ensure you’re using exactly 7.05 ounces (1 cup) of caster sugar, leveled off—not packed. Air fryers intensify flavors, so slight adjustments to sugar may be needed compared to traditional oven recipes."

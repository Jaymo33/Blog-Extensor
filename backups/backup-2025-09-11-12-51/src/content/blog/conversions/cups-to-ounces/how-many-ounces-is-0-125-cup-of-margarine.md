faqQ1: "Can I use butter instead of margarine for 0.125 cup in air fryer recipes?"
faqA1: "Yes, you can substitute butter for margarine in the same quantity (0.125 cup or 1 ounce). However, butter has a higher water content, so your cooking times might need slight adjustment. The flavour will also be richer, which can be a bonus for many dishes."
faqQ2: "How do I measure 0.125 cup of margarine without a measuring cup?"
faqA2: "If you don't have a measuring cup, you can use a kitchen scale to weigh out 1 ounce of margarine. Alternatively, 0.125 cup equals 2 tablespoons, so you can use a tablespoon measure. For block margarine, check the packaging for tablespoon markings to make it easier."
faqQ3: "Why is 0.125 cup of margarine commonly used in air fryer recipes?"
faqA3: "0.125 cup (1 ounce) of margarine is often used because it provides enough fat to prevent sticking and add flavour without making the dish greasy. Air fryers circulate hot air, so too much margarine can lead to uneven cooking or soggy results. This small amount strikes the perfect balance."
faqQ4: "Does the type of margarine affect the conversion from cups to ounces?"
faqA4: "Most standard margarines have a similar density, so 0.125 cup will generally equal 1 ounce. However, low-fat or whipped margarines might be less dense, so it's best to weigh them for accuracy. Stick margarine is the most reliable for measuring by volume."

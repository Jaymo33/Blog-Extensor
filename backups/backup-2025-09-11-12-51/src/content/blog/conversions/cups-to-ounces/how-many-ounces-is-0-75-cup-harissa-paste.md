faqQ1: "Can I use harissa paste straight from the jar in my air fryer?"
faqA1: "Yes, you can use harissa paste directly, but for best results, mix it with oil or yoghurt to prevent drying. Measuring 0.75 cup (6 ounces) ensures consistent flavour distribution. Always preheat your air fryer for even cooking."
faqQ2: "How do I adjust harissa paste measurements for a milder flavour?"
faqA2: "For less heat, reduce the 0.75 cup (6 ounces) by half and substitute with tomato paste or olive oil. Taste as you go, especially when adapting air fryer recipes. Remember, harissa’s spice level varies by brand."
faqQ3: "Is 0.75 cup of harissa paste the same weight as other pastes?"
faqA3: "No, harissa paste is denser than some sauces. While 0.75 cup equals 6 ounces for harissa, tomato paste might weigh slightly less. Always check specific conversions for accuracy in air fryer cooking."
faqQ4: "Can I freeze 0.75 cup portions of harissa paste for later use?"
faqA4: "Absolutely! Freezing 0.75 cup (6-ounce) portions in small containers works well. Thaw overnight in the fridge before using in air fryer recipes. This method preserves freshness for up to 3 months."

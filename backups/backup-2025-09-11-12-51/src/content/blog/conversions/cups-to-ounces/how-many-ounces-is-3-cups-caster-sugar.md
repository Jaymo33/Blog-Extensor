faqQ1: "Why is weighing caster sugar better than using cups?"
faqA1: "Weighing caster sugar ensures accuracy because cup measurements can vary due to settling or fluffing. Scales eliminate guesswork, especially in air fryer baking where precision affects texture and browning."
faqQ2: "Does 3 cups of caster sugar weigh the same as granulated sugar?"
faqA2: "No, granulated sugar is slightly heavier per cup due to its larger crystals. Caster sugar’s finer texture means 3 cups weigh around 24 ounces, while granulated sugar may weigh closer to 25 ounces."
faqQ3: "Can I use this conversion for air fryer recipes?"
faqA3: "Absolutely! Converting 3 cups of caster sugar to ounces (24 oz) ensures consistent results in air fryer desserts. Accurate measurements prevent over-browning or uneven cooking."
faqQ4: "How do I store caster sugar to keep it fresh?"
faqA4: "Store caster sugar in an airtight container in a cool, dry place. This prevents clumping and moisture absorption, which can affect measurements in recipes like air fryer cakes or meringues."

<p>3 cups of caster sugar equals approximately 24 ounces (or 680 grams). This conversion is essential for precise baking, especially when using an air fryer for desserts. Whether you're whipping up cakes, cookies, or meringues, knowing the exact weight ensures consistent results every time.</p>  

<h2>Why Convert Cups to Ounces for Caster Sugar?</h2>  
<p>Measuring ingredients by weight rather than volume is a game-changer in baking. Caster sugar, with its fine texture, can settle or fluff up, leading to inconsistent cup measurements. By converting 3 cups of caster sugar to ounces, you eliminate guesswork and achieve perfect sweetness in recipes like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer cakes</a> or <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cookies>cookies</a>.</p>  

<p>For UK bakers, this conversion is particularly useful, as many recipes use metric measurements. If you're adapting a US recipe or using an air fryer, knowing that 3 cups of caster sugar equals 24 ounces (or 680 grams) simplifies the process.

<h3>How to Measure Caster Sugar Accurately</h3>  
<p>To measure 3 cups of caster sugar correctly, fluff the sugar with a spoon before lightly spooning it into a measuring cup. Avoid packing it down, as this can lead to over-measuring. For precision, use a kitchen scale to confirm the weight—24 ounces is your target for 3 cups.</p>  

<h2>Using Caster Sugar in Air Fryer Recipes</h2>  
<p>Caster sugar is a staple in many air fryer desserts, from sponges to crumbles. Its fine texture dissolves quickly, making it ideal for batters and meringues. When converting 3 cups of caster sugar to ounces for an air fryer recipe, remember that even distribution is key to avoiding overly sweet or dense results.</p>  

<p>For example, if you're making <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>air fryer desserts</a>, ensure your sugar measurement is spot-on. Too much sugar can cause burning, while too little may leave your bake bland. Always level off your cups or, better yet, weigh the sugar for foolproof baking.</p>  

<h3>Common Mistakes When Measuring Sugar</h3>  
<p>One of the biggest mistakes is scooping sugar directly from the bag with a measuring cup. This compacts the sugar, leading to more than the intended 24 ounces in 3 cups. Instead, use the spoon-and-level method or a scale for accuracy, especially when baking in an air fryer.</p>  

<h2>Converting Other Sugar Measurements</h2>  
<p>While 3 cups of caster sugar equals 24 ounces, other sugars may differ. Granulated sugar, for instance, weighs slightly more per cup due to its coarser texture. Always refer to a reliable <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a> or your air fryer's manual for specific guidance.</p>  

<p>If you're scaling a recipe up or down, remember that 1 cup of caster sugar equals 8 ounces. This makes it easy to adjust quantities without recalculating. For more air fryer tips, explore <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>.</p>

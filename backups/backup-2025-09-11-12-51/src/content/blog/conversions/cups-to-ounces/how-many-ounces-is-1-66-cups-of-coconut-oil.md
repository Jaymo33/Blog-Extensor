faqQ1: "How do I measure 1.66 cups of coconut oil without a scale?"
faqA1: "You can use measuring cups for 1.66 cups of coconut oil—fill one cup completely, then measure two-thirds of another cup. For melted coconut oil, pour it to the 1 and 2/3 cup mark on a liquid measuring cup. If using solid coconut oil, pack it firmly into the cups to avoid air gaps."
faqQ2: "Can I use coconut oil in my air fryer for all recipes?"
faqA2: "Coconut oil works well for most air fryer recipes due to its high smoke point and mild flavor. However, it may not be ideal for very high-temperature cooking (above 350°F/175°C) as it can start to smoke. For best results, stick to recipes that specifically call for coconut oil or similar fats."
faqQ3: "Does the type of coconut oil affect the ounce measurement?"
faqA3: "No, the type of coconut oil (refined, unrefined, virgin) doesn’t change the weight per cup. All varieties will weigh approximately 8 ounces per cup, so 1.66 cups will always equal 13.28 ounces. The difference lies in flavor and smoke point, not density."
faqQ4: "How can I clean my air fryer after using coconut oil?"
faqA4: "After cooking with coconut oil, let your air fryer cool slightly, then wipe it with a damp cloth or sponge. For stubborn residue, use a mild dish soap or our recommended <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner</a>. Avoid abrasive scrubbers to protect the non-stick coating. Regular cleaning prevents buildup and maintains performance."

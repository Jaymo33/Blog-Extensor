faqQ1: "Can I use beef broth instead of beef stock in my air fryer recipes?"
faqA1: "Yes, you can substitute beef broth for beef stock in most air fryer recipes. However, broth tends to be saltier, so adjust seasoning accordingly. Both provide rich flavour, but stock is typically more concentrated."
faqQ2: "How do I store leftover beef stock for future air fryer use?"
faqA2: "Leftover beef stock can be refrigerated for up to 4 days or frozen for 3 months. Pour it into an airtight container or ice cube trays for portion control. Thaw before using in your air fryer recipes."
faqQ3: "Why is my air fryer recipe too watery when using beef stock?"
faqA3: "If your dish is too watery, you may have used too much stock. Remember, 0.66 cup equals 5.28 ounces. Alternatively, try reducing the stock on the stove before adding it to your air fryer for a thicker consistency."
faqQ4: "Can I make my own beef stock for air fryer recipes?"
faqA4: "Absolutely! Homemade beef stock adds incredible depth to air fryer dishes. Simmer beef bones, vegetables, and herbs for several hours, then strain. Use 0.66 cup (5.28 oz) as you would shop-bought stock."

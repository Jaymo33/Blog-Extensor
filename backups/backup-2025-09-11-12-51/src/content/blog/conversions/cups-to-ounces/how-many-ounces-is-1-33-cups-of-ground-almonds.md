faqQ1: "Can I use whole almonds instead of ground almonds in air fryer recipes?"
faqA1: "Yes, but you'll need to grind them first. Whole almonds won't provide the same texture or consistency in baking. For 1.33 cups of ground almonds (4.8 ounces), you'll need about 1.5 cups of whole almonds before grinding. Always weigh after grinding for accuracy."
faqQ2: "How do I store ground almonds for air fryer baking?"
faqA2: "Store ground almonds in an airtight container in a cool, dark place or the fridge to prevent rancidity. They can last up to 3 months refrigerated or 6 months frozen. Measure out 1.33 cups (4.8 ounces) as needed for recipes."
faqQ3: "Why does my air fryer almond cake turn out dry?"
faqA3: "Dryness often comes from over-measuring ground almonds. Ensure you're using exactly 1.33 cups (4.8 ounces) and not packing them down. Also, check your air fryer temperatureâ€”overcooking can dry out almond-based baked goods."
faqQ4: "Is there a difference between almond meal and ground almonds in air fryer recipes?"
faqA4: "Almond meal is coarser and may affect texture, while ground almonds are finer. For 1.33 cups (4.8 ounces), stick to ground almonds unless the recipe specifies otherwise. Both work, but ground almonds give a smoother finish."

<h3>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer baking</h3>  
<p>Air fryers cook food faster and more evenly than conventional ovens, so precise measurements ensure your recipes don't dry out or undercook. Ground almonds absorb moisture differently than wheat flour, affecting texture. Using the correct weight (4.8 ounces for 1.33 cups) guarantees perfect results.

<h2>How to measure ground almonds for air fryer recipes</h2>  
<p>For the most accurate results, use a kitchen scale to weigh your ground almonds. Scooping directly from the bag can lead to uneven measurements due to settling. Fluff the almonds with a spoon before measuring to ensure consistency. If you don't have a scale, spoon the almonds into a measuring cup and level it off.

<h3>Common mistakes when converting cups to ounces</h3>  
<p>One common error is assuming all cup measurements are equal. Ground almonds can vary in fineness, affecting density. Always use the spoon-and-level method for cups or, better yet, weigh them. Another mistake is confusing fluid ounces (volume) with weight ounces. For air fryer recipes, weight ounces (like 4.8 ounces for 1.33 cups) are crucial for accuracy.</p>

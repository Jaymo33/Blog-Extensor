faqQ1: "Can I use fresh ginger instead of 0.25 cup ginger paste?"
faqA1: "Yes, you can substitute fresh ginger for ginger paste. Grate about 2 tablespoons of fresh ginger to replace 0.25 cup (2 ounces) of paste. Fresh ginger has a sharper flavour, so adjust to taste. For air fryer recipes, finely mince it to ensure even distribution."
faqQ2: "How long does 0.25 cup ginger paste last in the fridge?"
faqA2: "Ginger paste stored in an airtight container lasts 2-3 weeks in the fridge. If you’ve measured out 0.25 cup (2 ounces), ensure the container is sealed properly. For longer storage, freeze it in portions—0.25 cup per ice cube works well for future air fryer recipes."
faqQ3: "Why does my air fryer recipe taste too gingery with 0.25 cup paste?"
faqA3: "Ginger paste potency varies by brand. If 0.25 cup (2 ounces) overpowers your dish, reduce it to 1.5 ounces next time. Always taste marinades before cooking. For balanced flavours, pair ginger with acidic ingredients like lemon juice in air fryer recipes."
faqQ4: "Can I use 0.25 cup ginger paste in baking air fryer desserts?"
faqA4: "Absolutely! 0.25 cup (2 ounces) ginger paste adds warmth to air fryer cakes or cookies. Reduce other liquids slightly to account for the paste’s moisture. It pairs wonderfully with spices like cinnamon in <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>air fryer desserts</a>."

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on even cooking, and incorrect ingredient quantities can throw off the balance. Too much ginger paste might overpower your dish, while too little could leave it bland. Measuring 0.25 cup of ginger paste correctly (2 ounces) ensures your flavours are spot-on. This is especially crucial for recipes like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer chicken tikka</a>, where ginger paste plays a starring role.</p>  

<p>Using a kitchen scale for ounces is the most accurate method, but if you don’t have one, measuring cups will do. Just remember that ginger paste’s density can vary slightly, so 0.25 cup might not always be exactly 2 ounces. For best results, stick to trusted brands or homemade pastes with consistent textures.</p>  

<h3>How to measure ginger paste without a scale</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a scale, use a liquid measuring cup for ginger paste. Fill it to the 0.25 cup mark, ensuring the paste is level for accuracy. Alternatively, 2 tablespoons equal 0.25 cup, which is roughly 2 ounces. This trick works well for small quantities in recipes like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>air fryer roasted vegetables</a>.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for 0.25 cup ginger paste in air fryer recipes</h2>  
<p>Ginger paste adds depth to marinades, sauces, and even baked goods. In an air fryer, 0.25 cup (2 ounces) is perfect for coating proteins like chicken or tofu. Try it in <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>air fryer chicken wings</a> or as a base for stir-fry sauces. The bold flavour cuts through richer dishes, balancing spices beautifully.</p>

<h3>Storing ginger paste for future use</h3>

faqQ1: "Can I use gram flour instead of regular flour in air fryer recipes?"
faqA1: "Yes, gram flour can often substitute regular flour in air fryer recipes, especially for coatings and batters. However, as it's gluten-free and more absorbent, you may need to adjust liquid quantities slightly. It works particularly well for creating crispy textures in the air fryer."
faqQ2: "Does the type of measuring cup affect the ounce conversion for gram flour?"
faqA2: "Absolutely. UK cups (250ml) differ slightly from US cups (240ml), which can affect the weight in ounces. For precise measurements, always use the same type of cup specified in the recipe or better yet, weigh your gram flour for accuracy in air fryer cooking."
faqQ3: "How should I store gram flour to maintain its weight consistency?"
faqA3: "Store gram flour in an airtight container in a cool, dry place to prevent moisture absorption, which can affect its weight. Proper storage ensures your cup-to-ounce conversions remain accurate for consistent air fryer results."
faqQ4: "Can I use gram flour for sweet air fryer recipes?"
faqA4: "Certainly! Gram flour works well in sweet air fryer recipes like gluten-free cookies or cakes. Its nutty flavour complements sweet spices and fruits beautifully. Just remember to adjust your measurements accurately using the cup-to-ounce conversion for best results."

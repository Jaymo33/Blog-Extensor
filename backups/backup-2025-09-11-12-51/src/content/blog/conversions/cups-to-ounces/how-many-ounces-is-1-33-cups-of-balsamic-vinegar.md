faqQ1: "Does the type of balsamic vinegar affect the conversion from cups to ounces?"
faqA1: "While different types of balsamic vinegar (traditional, commercial, white) have varying thicknesses, the weight conversion remains the same. 1.33 cups of any balsamic vinegar will always equal approximately 10.64 ounces. The density of vinegar is consistent enough that type doesn't significantly impact the cup to ounce conversion."
faqQ2: "Can I use this same conversion for other types of vinegar in my air fryer?"
faqA2: "Yes, the 1.33 cups to 10.64 ounces conversion works for most vinegars including apple cider, red wine, and white vinegar. However, very thick balsamic glazes or reductions might differ slightly. For most air fryer recipes using vinegar, this conversion will serve you well across different vinegar types."

faqA3: "For sticky balsamic vinegar, lightly coat your measuring cup with cooking spray or oil before adding the vinegar. This helps all 1.33 cups (10.64 ounces) pour out completely. Alternatively, use a kitchen scale to measure by weight for perfect accuracy in your air fryer dishes every time."
faqQ4: "Why is weight measurement better than volume for balsamic vinegar in air fryer cooking?"
faqA4: "Weight measurements (ounces) are more precise than volume (cups) because they aren't affected by how the vinegar settles or sticks to the measuring cup. In air fryer cooking where precision matters, knowing that 1.33 cups equals 10.64 ounces ensures consistent results, especially for marinades and glazes that affect cooking performance."

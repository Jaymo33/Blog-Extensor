faqQ1: "Can I use single cream instead of double cream in air fryer recipes?"
faqA1: "Yes, but the texture will differ. Double cream has a higher fat content (around 48%), making it thicker and richer. Single cream (18% fat) is lighter, so you may need to adjust quantities or add a thickener for similar results."
faqQ2: "How do I store leftover double cream after measuring 0.5 cup?"
faqA2: "Store it in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 3 days. Shake well before reusing, as it may separate. For longer storage, freeze it in portions, though thawed cream is best used in cooked dishes rather than whipped applications."
faqQ3: "Why does my air fryer recipe turn out watery with double cream?"
faqA3: "This usually happens if the cream isn’t reduced properly or if too much is added. For sauces, simmer the cream first to thicken it. Always measure precisely—0.5 cup (4.23 oz) is ideal for most small air fryer dishes."
faqQ4: "Is 0.5 cup of double cream the same in weight as whipped cream?"
faqA4: "No, whipped double cream expands in volume due to air incorporation. 0.5 cup of liquid double cream weighs 4.23 oz, but once whipped, it may fill more space while weighing the same. Measure before whipping for accuracy."

<p>Many air fryer recipes, especially desserts like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>chocolate mousse</a>, depend on exact measurements.

<h3>How to Measure 0.5 Cup of Double Cream Correctly</h3>  
<p>Use a liquid measuring cup for accuracy. Pour the double cream slowly, checking at eye level to ensure it reaches the 0.5 cup mark. If you don’t have measuring cups, a kitchen scale set to ounces (4.23 oz) works perfectly. For UK cooks, this conversion is especially handy as many recipes use metric measurements.</p>

faqQ1: "Does the type of cup affect how many ounces are in 1 cup of golden syrup?"
faqA1: "Yes, the type of cup matters significantly. In the UK, we use metric cups (250ml) which differ from US cups (240ml). For golden syrup, 1 UK metric cup equals about 11.5 ounces, while a US cup would be slightly less at around 11 ounces. Always check which measurement system your recipe uses."
faqQ2: "Can I use a kitchen scale instead of measuring cups for golden syrup?"
faqA2: "Absolutely! Using a digital kitchen scale is often more accurate for sticky ingredients like golden syrup. Simply set your scale to ounces and pour directly into your mixing bowl. This method eliminates the need for greasing measuring cups and gives you precise measurements every time."
faqQ3: "Why does my golden syrup measurement seem different each time I measure?"
faqA3: "Variations can occur due to temperature changes (cold syrup is denser) or how you pour it (creating air bubbles). The syrup's age can also affect viscosity. For consistency, always measure at room temperature and pour slowly down the side of the measuring cup to minimise air pockets."
faqQ4: "How does golden syrup compare to other sweeteners in weight?"
faqA4: "Golden syrup is heavier than many other liquid sweeteners. While 1 cup of golden syrup weighs about 11.5 ounces, honey weighs roughly 12 ounces per cup, and maple syrup about 11 ounces. This difference matters in recipes, especially when substituting one sweetener for another in air fryer cooking."

</ul>

<h3>The science behind golden syrup measurements</h3>
<p>Golden syrup's density affects its weight-to-volume ratio. At room temperature, 1 cup equals about 11.5 ounces because of its specific gravity. This differs from other syrups, so always check your recipe's requirements carefully.</p>

<h2>Common uses for golden syrup in air fryers</h2>
<p>Golden syrup works wonderfully in many <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a>. From sticky puddings to glazed meats, it adds a distinctive caramel flavour. Popular dishes include:</p>
<ul>

<li>Syrup-drizzled doughnuts</li>
</ul>

<h3>Storing golden syrup for best results</h3>
<p>Keep your golden syrup in an airtight container at room temperature. Proper storage ensures consistent measurements when you're ready to use it in your next air fryer creation.</p>

<h2>Converting other golden syrup measurements</h2>
<p>While we've focused on 1 cup to ounces, you might need other conversions too. Here are some common ones:</p>
<ul>
<li>1 tablespoon = 0.72 ounces</li>
<li>1 teaspoon = 0.24 ounces</li>
<li>250ml = about 8.8 ounces</li>
</ul>

faqQ1: "Can I use a kitchen scale to measure 0.5 cup of apple cider vinegar?"
faqA1: "Yes, you can use a kitchen scale to measure 0.5 cup (4 oz) of apple cider vinegar. Set the scale to fluid ounces, then pour the vinegar until it reaches 4 oz. This method is just as accurate as using a measuring cup."
faqQ2: "Does the type of vinegar affect the ounce measurement?"
faqA2: "No, the type of vinegar doesn’t change the fluid ounce measurement. Whether it’s apple cider vinegar, white vinegar, or balsamic, 0.5 cup will always equal 4 oz. The difference lies in flavour and acidity, not volume."
faqQ3: "How do I adjust a recipe if I only have a 1-cup measuring tool?"
faqA3: "If you only have a 1-cup measure, fill it halfway to get 0.5 cup (4 oz) of apple cider vinegar. Alternatively, use two 0.25-cup measurements, which equal 2 oz each, to reach the desired amount."
faqQ4: "Why is apple cider vinegar popular in air fryer recipes?"
faqA4: "Apple cider vinegar adds tanginess and helps tenderise meats, making it ideal for air fryer marinades and glazes.

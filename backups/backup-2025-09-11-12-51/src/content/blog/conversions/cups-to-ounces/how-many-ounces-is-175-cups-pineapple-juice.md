faqQ1: "Can I use canned pineapple juice instead of fresh for 1.75 cups?"
faqA1: "Yes, canned pineapple juice works perfectly for measuring 1.75 cups (14 fl oz). Just ensure it’s unsweetened if your recipe requires natural acidity. The conversion remains the same—1.75 cups equals 14 fluid ounces whether fresh or canned."
faqQ2: "How does 1.75 cups of pineapple juice affect cooking times in an air fryer?"
faqA2: "Liquid quantities like 1.75 cups (14 oz) may slightly increase cooking times if used in marinades, as foods release more moisture. For glazes, apply during the last 5 minutes to avoid burning. Always pat meats dry before air frying for crispier results."
faqQ3: "Is 1.75 cups of pineapple juice the same in UK and US measurements?"
faqA3: "Yes, 1.75 cups equals 14 fluid ounces in both UK and US measurements. However, UK recipes may list metric equivalents (414 ml). Weight measurements differ slightly—1.75 cups is ~14.8 oz in UK weight versus 14 oz US fluid ounces."
faqQ4: "What’s the best way to reduce 1.75 cups of pineapple juice for a glaze?"
faqA4: "Simmer 1.75 cups (14 fl oz) in a saucepan over medium heat until reduced by half (~7 oz), stirring occasionally. This concentrates the sweetness for air fryer glazes. Add a teaspoon of cornflour slurry if you prefer a thicker consistency."

faqQ1: "Can I use a measuring cup instead of a scale for sunflower seeds?"
faqA1: "Yes, but for the most accurate results, a kitchen scale is best. If using a cup, fluff the seeds first and level them off to avoid overpacking. This ensures you get the correct 12-ounce weight for 3 cups."
faqQ2: "Do roasted sunflower seeds weigh the same as raw ones?"
faqA2: "Roasted sunflower seeds may weigh slightly less due to moisture loss during cooking. However, the difference is minimal, so 3 cups of roasted seeds will still be close to 12 ounces."
faqQ3: "How should I store sunflower seeds for air fryer recipes?"
faqA3: "Keep sunflower seeds in an airtight container in a cool, dark place to maintain freshness. For longer storage, refrigerate or freeze them to prevent rancidity."
faqQ4: "Can I substitute sunflower seeds with other nuts in air fryer recipes?"
faqA4: "Yes, but adjust measurements since nuts vary in density. For example, 3 cups of almonds weigh more than sunflower seeds. Always check weight conversions for best results."

<p>3 cups of sunflower seeds weigh approximately 12 ounces (340 grams). This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes, ensuring precise measurements for perfectly roasted seeds every time. Whether you're snacking or adding them to a dish, knowing the weight helps avoid over or under-seasoning.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Using the correct amount of sunflower seeds ensures even cooking and optimal flavour. Air fryers rely on hot air circulation, so overcrowding or underfilling can affect results. For example, too many seeds may not crisp up properly, while too few could burn.

<p>Sunflower seeds are a versatile ingredient, great for salads, granola, or as a standalone snack. Measuring by weight (ounces) rather than volume (cups) guarantees consistency, especially when scaling recipes. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a> for creative ways to use them.</p>  

<h2>How to Measure Sunflower Seeds Correctly</h2>  
<p>For the most accurate results, use a kitchen scale to weigh your sunflower seeds. If you don’t have one, fluff the seeds in the bag before scooping them into a measuring cup. Level off the top with a straight edge for an exact 3-cup measure.</p>  

<h3>Common Mistakes When Measuring Sunflower Seeds</h3>  
<p>Packing the seeds too tightly into the cup can lead to an incorrect weight. Similarly, using a heaped cup adds extra ounces, throwing off your recipe. Always measure lightly for the best air fryer results.</p>  

<h2>Converting Cups to Ounces for Other Ingredients</h2>  
<p>Different ingredients have varying densities, so 3 cups of one item won’t always equal 12 ounces. For example, 3 cups of flour weigh around 12.75 ounces, while 3 cups of chopped nuts may differ.

faqQ1: "Can I use pumpkin seeds straight from the pumpkin in my air fryer?"
faqA1: "Yes, but you’ll need to rinse and dry them thoroughly first. Fresh pumpkin seeds have more moisture, so pat them dry and let them air-dry for a few hours before roasting. This ensures they crisp up nicely in the air fryer."
faqQ2: "How long should I roast 0.25 cup of pumpkin seeds in the air fryer?"
faqA2: "Roast 0.25 cup (1 ounce) of pumpkin seeds at 160°C for 8–10 minutes, shaking the basket halfway. Keep an eye on them, as they can burn quickly due to their high oil content."
faqQ3: "Are pumpkin seeds healthy when cooked in an air fryer?"
faqA3: "Absolutely! Air frying preserves their nutrients, including magnesium, zinc, and healthy fats. Just avoid excessive oil or salt to keep them a wholesome snack."
faqQ4: "Can I season pumpkin seeds before air frying them?"
faqA4: "Definitely! Toss 0.25 cup of seeds with spices like paprika, cinnamon, or garlic powder before air frying. Experiment with flavours to match your taste—sweet or savoury both work well."

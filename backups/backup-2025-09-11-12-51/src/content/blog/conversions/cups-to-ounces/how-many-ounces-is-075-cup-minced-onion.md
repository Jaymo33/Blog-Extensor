faqQ1: "Can I use dried minced onion instead of fresh for 0.75 cup?"
faqA1: "Yes, you can substitute dried minced onion, but the conversion differs. Use about 2 tablespoons of dried minced onion for every 0.75 cup (3 ounces) of fresh. Rehydrate it with a bit of water before adding to your air fryer dish for best results."
faqQ2: "Does the type of onion affect the weight in ounces?"
faqA2: "The type of onion can slightly alter the weight due to density. Yellow, white, and red onions are fairly consistent, but sweet onions may weigh less because they contain more water. For 0.75 cup, stick to 3 ounces as a general rule."
faqQ3: "How do I store leftover minced onion for air fryer use?"
faqA3: "Store leftover minced onion in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 5 days. For longer storage, freeze it in portions. When ready to use, thaw and pat dry to avoid excess moisture in your air fryer recipes."
faqQ4: "Can I use this conversion for other vegetables in the air fryer?"
faqA4: "This conversion applies specifically to minced onion due to its texture. Other vegetables, like minced garlic or carrots, have different densities. Always check a reliable conversion chart or weigh them for accuracy in air fryer cooking."

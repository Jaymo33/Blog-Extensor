faqQ1: "Can I use a kitchen scale to measure 0.75 cup of cocoa powder?"
faqA1: "Yes, a kitchen scale is the most accurate way to measure cocoa powder. Simply set it to ounces and measure out 2.25 oz, which is equivalent to 0.75 cup. This method eliminates guesswork and ensures perfect results every time."
faqQ2: "Does the type of cocoa powder affect the weight per cup?"
faqA2: "Slightly. Dutch-processed cocoa powder is denser than natural cocoa, so 0.75 cup may weigh a tad more. However, the difference is minimal—around 2.25 to 2.4 ounces. For most recipes, 2.25 oz will work perfectly."
faqQ3: "How do I convert 0.75 cup of cocoa powder to grams?"
faqA3: "Since 1 ounce equals roughly 28 grams, 2.25 ounces of cocoa powder is about 63 grams. This conversion is handy for bakers using metric measurements or following European recipes."
faqQ4: "Can I substitute cocoa powder for melted chocolate in air fryer recipes?"
faqA4: "Yes, but adjust the ratios. Replace 1 oz of melted chocolate with 3 tablespoons (0.75 oz) of cocoa powder plus 1 tablespoon of fat (like butter or oil). This ensures the right texture and richness in your air fryer bakes."

faqQ1: "Can I use canned chickpeas instead of dried for this measurement?"
faqA1: "Yes, you can use canned chickpeas, but make sure to drain and rinse them first. Canned chickpeas are already cooked, so they’ll weigh slightly more due to moisture. For 1.25 cups (10 ounces) of dried chickpeas, you’d need about 1.5 cups of canned chickpeas after draining."
faqQ2: "How do I store leftover chickpeas after measuring?"
faqA2: "Store cooked or canned chickpeas in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 4 days. For longer storage, freeze them in portion-sized bags. Thaw before using in your air fryer recipes for best results."
faqQ3: "Do chickpeas expand when cooked, and does this affect the ounce measurement?"
faqA3: "Yes, dried chickpeas roughly double in size when cooked. However, the weight in ounces remains similar—1.25 cups of dried chickpeas will yield about 2.5 cups cooked but still weigh around 10 ounces (minus any water weight)."
faqQ4: "What’s the best way to season chickpeas for air frying?"
faqA4: "Toss chickpeas with olive oil, salt, and spices like paprika, cumin, or garlic powder before air frying. For a sweet twist, try cinnamon and a touch of honey. Experiment with flavours to find your favourite combination!"

faqQ1: "Can I use frozen diced peppers instead of fresh?"
faqA1: "Yes, frozen diced peppers work well in air fryer recipes. There's no need to thaw them—just add a couple of extra minutes to the cooking time to account for the moisture. Frozen peppers are a convenient alternative and retain most of their nutritional value."
faqQ2: "How many bell peppers do I need to make 1.25 cups diced?"
faqA2: "On average, one medium bell pepper yields about 1 cup when diced. So, you'll need roughly 1.25 medium peppers to get 1.25 cups. Sizes vary, so it's always best to measure after dicing for accuracy."
faqQ3: "Do different coloured peppers weigh the same?"
faqA3: "Yes, red, green, and yellow peppers have similar weights when diced. The main difference is their sweetness and ripeness, not their density. You can use any colour interchangeably in recipes without adjusting the measurement."
faqQ4: "Can I substitute jarred roasted peppers for fresh diced peppers?"
faqA4: "Jarred roasted peppers can be used, but they have a softer texture and stronger flavour. Drain them well and pat dry before using. Since they're pre-cooked, reduce the air fryer time by a few minutes to avoid overcooking."

<p>1.25 cups of diced peppers equals approximately 10 ounces. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements can make all the difference. Whether you're preparing a stir-fry, stuffed peppers, or a vibrant veggie mix, knowing the weight ensures consistent results every time.</p>

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>
<p>Air fryers rely on even cooking, and the right amount of ingredients ensures everything cooks uniformly. Too many diced peppers can overcrowd the basket, leading to unevenly cooked food. On the other hand, too few might leave your dish lacking in flavour or texture. That's why converting cups to ounces is so helpful, especially for recipes like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer fajitas</a> or stuffed peppers.</p>
<p>For those who love meal prepping, knowing the weight of 1.25 cups of diced peppers (10 ounces) helps with portion control. It also makes it easier to scale recipes up or down depending on how many you're cooking for.

<h2>How to measure diced peppers accurately</h2>
<p>Measuring diced peppers can be tricky because their size and density vary. A tightly packed cup will weigh more than a loosely filled one. For the most accurate results, use a kitchen scale to measure out 10 ounces, which is equivalent to 1.25 cups. This method eliminates guesswork and ensures your air fryer recipes turn out perfectly every time.</p>
<p>If you don't have a scale, fluff the diced peppers with a fork before lightly spooning them into a measuring cup. Avoid pressing down, as this can compress the peppers and lead to an inaccurate measurement.

When ready to use, simply toss the frozen peppers directly into the air fryer—no need to thaw. Just adjust the cooking time by a few minutes to account for the extra moisture.</p>

Whole peppers, on the other hand, vary in weight depending on their size. Always refer to a reliable conversion chart or scale for the best results.</p>

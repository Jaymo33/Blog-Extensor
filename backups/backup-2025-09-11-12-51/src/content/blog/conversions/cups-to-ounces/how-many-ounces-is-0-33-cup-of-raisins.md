faqQ1: "Can I use grams instead of ounces for 0.33 cup of raisins?"
faqA1: "Absolutely! 0.33 cup of raisins equals about 50 grams. Many kitchen scales toggle between ounces and grams, making it easy to measure for air fryer recipes. This is especially useful if you're following European recipes or prefer metric measurements."
faqQ2: "How do I measure 0.33 cup of raisins if I don't have a 1/3 cup measure?"
faqA2: "You can use a 1/4 cup measure and fill it slightly more than halfway. Alternatively, use tablespoons - 0.33 cup equals about 5 tablespoons plus 1 teaspoon of raisins. For most air fryer recipes, this approximation works perfectly fine."
faqQ3: "Do golden raisins weigh the same as regular raisins per 0.33 cup?"
faqA3: "Yes, both types weigh approximately 1.76 ounces (50 grams) per 0.33 cup. The main difference is flavour and colour, not density. You can use them interchangeably in air fryer recipes without adjusting the measurement."
faqQ4: "Why do some recipes list raisins by weight instead of volume?"
faqA4: "Weight measurements (ounces or grams) are more precise because raisin sizes vary. A 0.33 cup measure could be slightly more or less than 1.76 ounces depending on how tightly packed they are. Weight ensures consistency, especially important in air fryer baking where even cooking is key."

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>
<p>Air fryers rely on even cooking, and precise ingredient measurements help achieve that. Using 0.33 cup of raisins (1.76 ounces) ensures your dish isn’t too dry or overly sweet.

<p>Raisins can vary in density, so weighing them removes guesswork. If your air fryer recipe calls for 0.33 cup of raisins, a kitchen scale will give you the most accurate 1.76 ounces. This is especially useful for baking, where consistency is crucial.</p>

<h2>How to Measure 0.33 Cup of Raisins Without a Scale</h2>
<p>Don’t have a scale? No problem. A standard US cup holds 8 fluid ounces, so 0.33 cup is roughly one-third of that. For raisins, this translates to a lightly packed 1.76 ounces. Use a measuring cup and level off the top for accuracy.</p>
<p>If you’re in the UK, note that metric cups differ slightly. A UK cup is 284ml versus the US 240ml, but for raisins, the difference in weight is minimal. Check <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>our conversion chart</a> for more details.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Buttermilk Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of buttermilk in your air fryer recipes ensures the perfect texture and flavour. Too much can make batters soggy, while too little can dry out your dishes.

<h2>How to Measure Buttermilk Correctly</h2>  
<p>Measuring buttermilk isn’t as simple as pouring it into a cup. For the most accurate results, use a liquid measuring cup with clear markings.

If you don’t have a scale, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a> is a handy reference. Avoid using dry measuring cups, as they can lead to inaccuracies. Consistency is key, especially when working with air fryer batters and marinades.</p>  

<h3>Common Mistakes When Measuring Buttermilk</h3>  
<p>One of the biggest mistakes is eyeballing the measurement instead of using proper tools. Another is confusing fluid ounces with weight ounces—1.25 cups of buttermilk is 10 fluid ounces, not weight ounces. Always check your recipe’s requirements to avoid mishaps.

faqQ1: "Can I use grams instead of ounces for baking powder measurements?"
faqA1: "Yes, grams are another precise way to measure baking powder. 1.25 cups of baking powder is roughly 283 grams. Using a digital kitchen scale ensures accuracy, especially for air fryer recipes where exact measurements matter."
faqQ2: "Does the type of baking powder affect the weight per cup?"
faqA2: "Most baking powders have similar densities, but double-acting varieties might weigh slightly more due to added ingredients. For 1.25 cups, the difference is minimal—stick to 10 ounces (or 283 grams) unless the recipe specifies otherwise."
faqQ3: "How do I adjust baking powder for high-altitude air fryer baking?"
faqA3: "At higher altitudes, you may need slightly less baking powder to prevent over-rising. Reduce the amount by 1/8 to 1/4 teaspoon per cup. For 1.25 cups, that’s about 9.5 ounces instead of 10."
faqQ4: "Can I substitute baking soda for baking powder in this measurement?"
faqA4: "No, baking soda is more potent, so you’d need much less. For 1.25 cups of baking powder, you’d only use about 1/4 cup of baking soda—plus an acid like lemon juice or vinegar to activate it. Always check the recipe for guidance."

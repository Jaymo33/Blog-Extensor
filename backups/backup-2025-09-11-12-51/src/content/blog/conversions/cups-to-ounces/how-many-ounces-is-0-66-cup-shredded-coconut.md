faqQ1: "Can I use desiccated coconut instead of shredded coconut in air fryer recipes?"
faqA1: "Yes, but note that desiccated coconut is finer and drier, which may affect texture and weight. For 0.66 cup, you’ll still need roughly 2.64 oz, but the result might be less crunchy. Adjust cooking times slightly to avoid over-browning."
faqQ2: "How do I convert 0.66 cup shredded coconut to grams?"
faqA2: "Since 1 oz is approximately 28.35 grams, 0.66 cup (2.64 oz) of shredded coconut equals about 75 grams. This conversion is useful for recipes requiring metric measurements, especially in baking."
faqQ3: "Why does my shredded coconut burn in the air fryer?"
faqA3: "Shredded coconut can burn quickly due to its high sugar content and low moisture. To prevent this, spread it evenly and check frequently. Using the correct 0.66 cup (2.64 oz) measurement helps avoid overcrowding, which can also cause uneven cooking."
faqQ4: "Can I freeze shredded coconut for later use?"
faqA4: "Absolutely! Freezing shredded coconut in 0.66 cup (2.64 oz) portions keeps it fresh for months. Thaw at room temperature before using it in air fryer recipes. This method is perfect for meal prepping or bulk buying."

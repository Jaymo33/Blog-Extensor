faqQ1: "Can I use 0.25 cup of almond milk instead of regular milk in air fryer recipes?"
faqA1: "Absolutely! Almond milk works as a 1:1 substitute for regular milk in most air fryer recipes. Just note that it has a slightly nuttier flavour and thinner consistency, which may affect browning. For best results, stick to unsweetened varieties unless the recipe calls for sweetness."
faqQ2: "How do I convert 0.25 cup of almond milk to grams?"
faqA2: "0.25 cup of almond milk is roughly 60 grams. If you’re using a kitchen scale, this conversion ensures accuracy, especially in baking. Remember that different brands may vary slightly, so check the label for precise weight per cup."
faqQ3: "Why does my air fryer recipe turn out soggy when using almond milk?"
faqA3: "Sogginess can happen if the almond milk makes your batter too wet or if you’re not preheating the air fryer. Try reducing the liquid slightly or adding a tablespoon of flour to thicken the mixture. Also, ensure you’re cooking at the right temperature—check our conversion chart for adjustments."
faqQ4: "Is 0.25 cup of almond milk the same as 2 fluid ounces?"
faqA4: "Yes, 0.25 cup of almond milk equals 2 fluid ounces. This standard conversion applies to most liquids, including almond milk. For thicker liquids like cream, the weight may differ, but almond milk’s consistency stays close to water."

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on precise ingredient ratios to achieve crispy, evenly cooked results. Using too much or too little liquid, like almond milk, can affect texture and cooking times. For example, adding extra almond milk to a batter might make it too runny, leading to soggy outcomes. On the other hand, too little could dry out your dish. That’s why knowing conversions like 0.25 cup to ounces is so useful. Explore more <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> to see how measurements impact results.</p>  

<p>Almond milk is a popular dairy-free alternative in many air fryer recipes, from pancakes to coatings for crispy chicken. Its slightly nutty flavour and light texture make it versatile, but accuracy is key. If you’re converting a traditional recipe to an air fryer version, double-check your measurements. A kitchen scale can help, but memorising common conversions like 0.25 cup to ounces saves time.

<h3>Does almond milk brand affect the weight per cup?</h3>

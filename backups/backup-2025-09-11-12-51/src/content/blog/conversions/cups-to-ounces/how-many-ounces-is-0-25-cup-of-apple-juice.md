faqQ1: "Can I use apple juice concentrate instead of fresh apple juice in air fryer recipes?"
faqA1: "Yes, you can use apple juice concentrate, but you’ll need to adjust the quantity. Concentrate is more potent, so dilute it with water according to the package instructions before measuring 0.25 cup (2 oz). This ensures the right sweetness and consistency for your recipe."
faqQ2: "Does the type of apple juice affect the ounce measurement?"
faqA2: "No, the type of apple juice (fresh, bottled, or organic) doesn’t change the volume conversion. 0.25 cup will always be 2 oz, regardless of the juice variety. However, flavour intensity may vary, so adjust other seasonings accordingly."
faqQ3: "How can I measure 0.25 cup of apple juice without a measuring cup?"
faqA3: "If you don’t have a measuring cup, use tablespoons. Four UK tablespoons equal 2 oz (0.25 cup) of apple juice. Alternatively, a standard shot glass holds about 1 oz, so two shot glasses would give you the right amount."
faqQ4: "Can I substitute apple sauce for apple juice in air fryer recipes?"
faqA4: "Yes, but the texture will differ. Replace 0.25 cup (2 oz) of apple juice with 0.125 cup (1 oz) of apple sauce mixed with 1 oz of water. This maintains moisture while adapting to the thicker consistency of apple sauce."

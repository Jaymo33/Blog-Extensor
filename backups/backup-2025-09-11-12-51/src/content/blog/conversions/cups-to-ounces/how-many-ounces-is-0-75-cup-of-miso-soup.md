faqQ1: "Can I use 0.75 cup of miso paste instead of miso soup in air fryer recipes?"
faqA1: "No, miso paste is much more concentrated than miso soup. If a recipe calls for 0.75 cup (6 ounces) of miso soup, using the same amount of paste will make the dish overly salty and thick. Instead, dilute miso paste with water or broth to match the consistency of miso soup."
faqQ2: "How does 0.75 cup of miso soup affect cooking time in an air fryer?"
faqA2: "Using 0.75 cup (6 ounces) of miso soup in marinades or glazes may slightly increase cooking time due to the added moisture. However, it also helps prevent food from drying out. For best results, pat excess liquid off ingredients before air frying to ensure crispiness."
faqQ3: "Is 0.75 cup of miso soup the same weight in UK and US measurements?"
faqA3: "Yes, 0.75 cup of miso soup weighs approximately 6 ounces in both UK and US measurements. Fluid ounces are consistent across both systems, so no conversion is needed. Just ensure you’re using a standard measuring cup for accuracy."
faqQ4: "Can I freeze 0.75 cup portions of miso soup for later use in air fryer recipes?"
faqA4: "Absolutely! Freezing 0.75 cup (6-ounce) portions of miso soup in airtight containers or bags makes meal prep easy. Thaw it in the fridge before using it in marinades or glazes. This is a great way to always have the right amount on hand for air fryer cooking."

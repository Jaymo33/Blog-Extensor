faqQ1: "How do I convert 0.66 cup of chopped garlic to grams?"
faqA1: "0.66 cup of chopped garlic is roughly 90 grams. This conversion is useful for recipes requiring metric measurements. Since garlic’s density can vary, weighing it ensures accuracy, especially in air fryer cooking where precision matters."
faqQ2: "Can I use jarred chopped garlic instead of fresh for this measurement?"
faqA2: "Yes, but jarred garlic often contains added liquids, which may slightly affect the weight. For 0.66 cup (3.17 oz), you might need to drain excess moisture first. Fresh garlic is preferred for optimal flavour in air fryer recipes."
faqQ3: "Why does my air fryer recipe call for 0.66 cup of chopped garlic specifically?"
faqA3: "This measurement balances flavour without overpowering the dish. Air fryers intensify flavours, so 0.66 cup (3.17 oz) provides a robust garlic taste while allowing other ingredients to shine. Adjust slightly based on personal preference."
faqQ4: "How should I store leftover chopped garlic after measuring 0.66 cup?"
faqA4: "Store unused chopped garlic in an airtight container in the fridge for up to a week. For longer storage, freeze it in portions. Avoid leaving garlic at room temperature to prevent spoilage, especially if prepping for future air fryer meals."

<h3>How to Measure Chopped Garlic Correctly</h3>  
<p>To get an accurate 0.66 cup of chopped garlic, lightly pack the garlic into a measuring cup without crushing it. Avoid heaping the cup, as this can lead to excess weight. If you’re using pre-chopped garlic from a jar, note that it may have added moisture, slightly altering the weight. For best results, fresh garlic is ideal—especially in air fryer recipes where texture matters.</p>  

<h2>Common Recipes Using 0.66 Cup Chopped Garlic</h2>

<h3>Converting Other Garlic Measurements</h3>

faqQ1: "Can I use dried minced onion instead of fresh for 0.125 cup measurements?"
faqA1: "Yes, you can substitute dried minced onion, but the conversion differs. Use 2 tablespoons of dried minced onion to match the flavour of 0.125 cup fresh. Rehydrate it with a bit of water before adding to your air fryer recipe for best results."
faqQ2: "Why does 0.125 cup of minced onion weigh about 1 ounce?"
faqA2: "Minced onion is lightweight but densely packed, so 0.125 cup fills roughly 1 ounce by weight. The exact weight can vary slightly based on how finely the onion is minced and its moisture content. A kitchen scale ensures precision."
faqQ3: "How do I convert 0.125 cup minced onion to grams?"
faqA3: "Since 0.125 cup equals about 1 ounce, that’s approximately 28 grams. This conversion is handy for international recipes or if your scale measures in grams instead of ounces."
faqQ4: "Can I eyeball 0.125 cup of minced onion for air fryer recipes?"
faqA4: "While possible, eyeballing isn’t recommended for consistent results. Air fryer cooking relies on precise ingredient ratios. Use a measuring cup or scale for 0.125 cup (1 ounce) to avoid under- or over-seasoning your dish."

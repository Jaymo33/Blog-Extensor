<h2>Why accurate breadcrumb measurements matter</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of breadcrumbs is crucial for air fryer cooking. Too little, and your food won’t crisp up properly; too much, and you’ll end up with a dry, crumbly coating. Three cups of breadcrumbs (12 ounces) is a common measurement for recipes like air-fried chicken tenders or crispy tofu.

<p>Different types of breadcrumbs can vary slightly in weight. For example, panko breadcrumbs are lighter and flakier, while traditional breadcrumbs are denser. Always fluff the breadcrumbs before measuring to avoid compacting them. This ensures consistency across all your air fryer dishes.</p>  

<h3>How to measure breadcrumbs correctly</h3>  
<p>To measure 3 cups of breadcrumbs accurately, use the spoon-and-level method. Gently spoon the breadcrumbs into a measuring cup without packing them down, then level off the top with a knife. This prevents over-measuring, which can throw off your recipe. For best results, weigh your breadcrumbs using a kitchen scale—12 ounces is the gold standard for 3 cups.</p>  

<h2>Converting breadcrumbs for UK recipes</h2>

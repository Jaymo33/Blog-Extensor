faqQ1: "Does the thickness of greek yogurt affect the ounce measurement for 0.125 cup?"
faqA1: "Yes, thicker greek yogurts may weigh slightly more than thinner varieties for the same 0.125 cup measurement. While the standard conversion is 1 ounce, very thick yogurts could be closer to 1.1 ounces. For baking recipes where precision matters, it's best to weigh your 0.125 cup portion."
faqQ2: "Can I use regular yogurt instead of greek yogurt in the same 0.125 cup measurement?"
faqA2: "You can substitute regular yogurt, but be aware it has more liquid content. The 0.125 cup to ounce conversion remains the same (about 1 ounce), but you may need to adjust other liquid ingredients in your air fryer recipe slightly to compensate for the difference in consistency."
faqQ3: "How many grams is 0.125 cup of greek yogurt?"
faqA3: "0.125 cup of greek yogurt equals approximately 28 grams. This conversion is useful for recipes using metric measurements. Remember that air fryer cooking often benefits from precise measurements, so using grams can sometimes be more accurate than ounces or cups."
faqQ4: "Why do some air fryer recipes specify weight instead of volume for ingredients like greek yogurt?"
faqA4: "Weight measurements are more precise because volume can vary based on how ingredients are packed or scooped. In air fryer cooking, where even heating and consistent results are important, weighing your 0.125 cup of greek yogurt (1 ounce) ensures you get the exact amount needed for perfect results every time."

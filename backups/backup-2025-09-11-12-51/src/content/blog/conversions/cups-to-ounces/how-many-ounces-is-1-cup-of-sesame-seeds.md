faqQ1: "Can I use volume measurements instead of weight for sesame seeds in air fryer recipes?"
faqA1: "While volume measurements (like cups) work, weighing sesame seeds ensures accuracy, especially in air fryer cooking where even distribution matters. A kitchen scale gives the most reliable results, but if you don’t have one, lightly spooning seeds into a cup and levelling it off is the next best method."
faqQ2: "Do toasted sesame seeds weigh the same as raw ones?"
faqA2: "Toasted sesame seeds may weigh slightly less due to moisture loss, but the difference is minimal. For most recipes, you can use the same weight (4.5 ounces per cup) whether they’re raw or toasted. Just adjust cooking times to avoid over-browning."
faqQ3: "How should I store sesame seeds after measuring them?"
faqA3: "Store sesame seeds in an airtight container in a cool, dark place to maintain freshness. If you’ve toasted them, let them cool completely before storing. Proper storage prevents them from going rancid and keeps them ready for your next air fryer recipe."
faqQ4: "Can I substitute black sesame seeds for white ones using the same weight?"
faqA4: "Yes, black and white sesame seeds have nearly identical weights, so you can substitute them 1:1 by weight. However, black sesame seeds have a slightly stronger flavour, so adjust quantities if you prefer a milder taste in your air fryer dishes."

<p>1 cup of sesame seeds equals approximately 4.5 ounces (or 128 grams). This measurement is crucial for air fryer recipes where precision ensures even cooking and perfect texture. Whether you're toasting sesame seeds for a garnish or incorporating them into a dish, knowing the exact weight helps avoid mishaps.</p>

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on hot air circulation to cook food evenly, and incorrect measurements can lead to overcrowding or uneven results. Using the right amount of sesame seeds ensures they toast properly without burning. For example, if you're making sesame-crusted chicken in your air fryer, too many seeds can create a clumpy coating, while too few won’t give enough crunch.</p>  
<p>Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for other common ingredient measurements. It’s a handy tool for quick reference when adapting recipes to your air fryer. You’ll also find useful tips on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> that feature sesame seeds as a key ingredient.</p>

<h3>How to measure sesame seeds correctly</h3>  
<p>For the most accurate measurement, use a kitchen scale to weigh sesame seeds. If you don’t have one, lightly spoon the seeds into a measuring cup and level it off with a knife. Avoid packing them down, as this can lead to an incorrect weight. This method ensures you get the perfect 4.5 ounces per cup.</p>

<h2>Common uses for sesame seeds in air fryer recipes</h2>  
<p>Sesame seeds add a nutty flavour and crisp texture to many dishes. They’re great for coating proteins like chicken or fish before air frying, or sprinkling over roasted vegetables. You can also toast them lightly in the air fryer for garnishing salads or stir-fries.</p>

<h3>Converting other sesame seed measurements</h3>  
<p>If a recipe calls for tablespoons or grams instead of cups, here’s a quick reference: 1 tablespoon of sesame seeds weighs about 0.28 ounces (8 grams). This makes scaling recipes up or down much easier, especially when using an air fryer where precise quantities matter.</p>

<h2>Tips for toasting sesame seeds in an air fryer</h2>  
<p>Toasting sesame seeds enhances their flavour, and the air fryer does this job brilliantly. Spread them in a single layer and toast at 160°C for 3-4 minutes, shaking the basket halfway. Keep a close eye to prevent burning, as they can go from golden to bitter quickly.</p>

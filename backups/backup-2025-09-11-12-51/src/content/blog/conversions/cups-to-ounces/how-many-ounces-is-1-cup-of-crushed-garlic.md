faqQ1: "Can I use jarred minced garlic instead of fresh crushed garlic?"
faqA1: "Yes, you can substitute jarred minced garlic for fresh crushed garlic. However, jarred garlic often contains preservatives or added moisture, which may slightly alter the weight. Generally, 1 cup of jarred minced garlic weighs close to 4.8 ounces, but check the brand’s guidelines for accuracy."
faqQ2: "How should I store leftover crushed garlic?"
faqA2: "Leftover crushed garlic can be stored in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 2 weeks. For longer storage, mix it with a bit of olive oil and freeze it in ice cube trays. This way, you’ll have pre-measured portions ready for your next air fryer recipe."
faqQ3: "Does the type of garlic affect the weight per cup?"
faqA3: "Different garlic varieties (like elephant garlic or hardneck garlic) can vary slightly in density, but the difference is minimal. For most cooking purposes, 1 cup of crushed garlic will still weigh around 4.8 ounces regardless of the type."
faqQ4: "How do I convert ounces to grams for crushed garlic?"
faqA4: "To convert ounces to grams, multiply by 28.35. So, 4.8 ounces of crushed garlic equals approximately 136 grams. This conversion is useful if you’re using a metric scale or following a European recipe in your air fryer."

<h2>Why accurate garlic measurements matter</h2>  
<p>Garlic is a powerhouse ingredient that can elevate any dish, but too much or too little can throw off the balance. In an air fryer, where cooking times are shorter and temperatures higher, precise measurements ensure even cooking and perfect flavour distribution. A cup of crushed garlic might seem straightforward, but its weight can vary slightly based on how finely it’s minced. That’s why weighing it in ounces (or grams) is the most reliable method.</p>  

<p>If you’re preparing a recipe from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>our collection</a>, you’ll notice many specify weights for accuracy. This is especially important for garlic-heavy dishes like garlic bread or roasted garlic potatoes. Overdoing it can lead to overpowering bitterness, while too little might leave your dish lacking depth.</p>  

<h3>How to measure crushed garlic correctly</h3>  
<p>To get the most accurate measurement, lightly pack the crushed garlic into a measuring cup without pressing too hard. This ensures you’re not adding excess air or compacting it unnaturally. If possible, use a kitchen scale for precision—4.8 ounces is your target for 1 cup. For smaller quantities, remember that 1 tablespoon of crushed garlic is roughly 0.3 ounces.</p>  

<h2>Common recipes using 1 cup of crushed garlic</h2>  
<p>Many air fryer recipes call for generous amounts of garlic, especially in marinades and rubs. Dishes like garlic butter shrimp, roasted garlic chicken, or even garlic-infused oils benefit from this measurement. If you’re exploring <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>garlic chicken recipes</a>, you’ll often see 1 cup as a base for sauces or glazes.</p>  

<p>Another popular use is in homemade garlic paste, which can be stored and used later. Simply blend 1 cup of crushed garlic with a bit of oil, and you’ve got a versatile condiment ready for your next air fryer adventure.

<h3>Adjusting garlic quantities for taste</h3>  
<p>While 1 cup of crushed garlic equals 4.8 ounces, personal preference plays a role. If you love bold flavours, you might add an extra tablespoon. For milder tastes, reduce slightly. The air fryer’s high heat mellows garlic’s sharpness, so don’t shy away from experimenting. Just ensure you’re starting with the correct base measurement for consistency.</p>  

<h2>Converting other garlic measurements</h2>  
<p>If a recipe calls for whole cloves instead of crushed garlic, here’s a handy rule: 1 medium clove yields about 1 teaspoon of crushed garlic (0.1 ounces). That means you’d need roughly 48 cloves to make 1 cup (4.8 ounces). For minced garlic, the weight is similar, but the volume may differ slightly due to texture.</p>  

<p>Pre-minced jarred garlic is another option, but check the label for weight equivalents. Some brands pack more moisture, affecting the ounce-to-cup ratio. When in doubt, weigh it out!

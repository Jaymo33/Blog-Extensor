faqQ1: "Can I use canned tomatoes instead of fresh for 0.75 cup measurements?"
faqA1: "Yes, you can substitute canned chopped tomatoes for fresh in most recipes. Drain excess liquid first, as canned tomatoes often have more moisture. The weight conversion remains the same: 0.75 cup equals approximately 6 ounces."
faqQ2: "How do I adjust cooking time when using 0.75 cup of chopped tomatoes in an air fryer?"
faqA2: "Tomatoes release moisture, so dishes may need slightly longer cooking times. Start with the recipe’s recommended time and check for doneness. For saucy dishes, stirring halfway ensures even cooking."
faqQ3: "Is 0.75 cup of chopped tomatoes the same as diced tomatoes?"
faqA3: "Chopped and diced tomatoes have similar weights, but diced pieces are more uniform. For 0.75 cup, both will be around 6 ounces, though diced tomatoes may pack slightly denser."
faqQ4: "Where can I find more air fryer recipes using chopped tomatoes?"

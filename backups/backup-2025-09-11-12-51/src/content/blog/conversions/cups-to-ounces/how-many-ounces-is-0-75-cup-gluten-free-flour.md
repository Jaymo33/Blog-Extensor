<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer baking</h2>  
<p>Gluten-free flour behaves differently than regular flour, making accurate conversions crucial. Too much or too little can affect texture, rise, and even cooking time in your air fryer. Unlike traditional ovens, air fryers circulate hot air rapidly, so ingredient ratios must be spot-on. This is especially true for delicate bakes like muffins or bread. Visit <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>our recipe hub</a> for foolproof gluten-free air fryer ideas.</p>  

<p>Measuring by weight (ounces or grams) is far more reliable than volume (cups) for gluten-free flours. Brands vary in density, so 0.75 cup of one brand might weigh differently than another. A kitchen scale removes this guesswork, ensuring your air fryer creations turn out perfectly every time. Need cleaning tips for your air fryer after baking?

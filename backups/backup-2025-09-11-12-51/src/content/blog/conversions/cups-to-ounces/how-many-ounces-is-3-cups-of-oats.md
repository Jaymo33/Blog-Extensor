faqQ1: "Does the type of oat affect how many ounces are in 3 cups?"
faqA1: "Yes, different oat varieties have slightly different weights. Rolled oats typically measure about 3 ounces per cup (so 9 ounces for 3 cups), while steel-cut oats are denser at about 3.3 ounces per cup. Quick oats might be slightly lighter due to their thinner flakes.

For most air fryer recipes using rolled oats, you can safely use the 3 cups to 9 ounces conversion. If using steel-cut oats, you may want to add an extra 0.5-1 ounce to account for the density difference."
faqQ2: "Can I use a kitchen scale instead of measuring cups for oats?"
faqA2: "Absolutely! Using a digital kitchen scale is actually more accurate for measuring oats. Simply set your scale to ounces, tare it with your container, then add oats until you reach 9 ounces for the equivalent of 3 cups.

This method eliminates any packing differences that can occur with cup measurements. Many air fryer enthusiasts prefer weighing ingredients for consistent results, especially in baking recipes where precision matters most."
faqQ3: "How does this conversion work for UK recipes?"
faqA3: "The 3 cups to 9 ounces conversion works the same in UK measurements, as both countries use the same avoirdupois ounce for dry ingredients. However, UK cup sizes are slightly larger (284ml vs 240ml US), but for oats this difference is negligible in most recipes.

If following a UK-specific air fryer recipe, it may provide weights in grams (255g for 3 cups). But the ounce conversion remains reliable for most home cooking purposes across measurement systems."
faqQ4: "Why do my air fryer oat recipes sometimes turn out differently?"
faqA4: "Variations can occur due to several factors: oat density, how packed the cups were, or even humidity affecting the oats' moisture content. That's why weighing your oats (9 ounces for 3 cups) often gives more consistent results than volume measurements.

Air fryer models also vary in heating efficiency. If recipes aren't turning out as expected, try adjusting temperature by 5-10°C or checking your oat measurements. Proper measuring leads to more reliable outcomes in air fryer cooking."

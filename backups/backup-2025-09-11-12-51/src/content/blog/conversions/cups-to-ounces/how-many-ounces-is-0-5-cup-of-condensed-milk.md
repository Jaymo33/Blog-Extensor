faqQ1: "Can I use evaporated milk instead of condensed milk in air fryer recipes?"
faqA1: "No, evaporated milk and condensed milk are not interchangeable. Condensed milk is sweetened, while evaporated milk is unsweetened. Using evaporated milk will alter the sweetness and texture of your recipe. Stick to condensed milk for desserts that require its unique properties."
faqQ2: "How do I convert 0.5 cup of condensed milk to grams?"
faqA2: "0.5 cup of condensed milk is approximately 120 grams. If your recipe uses metric measurements, this conversion ensures accuracy. A kitchen scale is the best tool for this, as it provides precise measurements for consistent results in your air fryer dishes."
faqQ3: "Why is my air fryer dessert too sweet when using condensed milk?"
faqA3: "Condensed milk is naturally very sweet, so using too much can overpower your dessert. Always measure carefully—0.5 cup (4 ounces) is often enough for most recipes. If your dish is still too sweet, try reducing the sugar elsewhere in the recipe or balancing it with tart fruits like berries."
faqQ4: "Can I freeze leftover condensed milk?"
faqA4: "Yes, you can freeze condensed milk for up to 3 months. Thaw it in the fridge overnight and stir well before using. However, freezing may slightly change its texture, so it's best used in cooked or baked dishes rather than raw applications like no-bake cheesecakes."

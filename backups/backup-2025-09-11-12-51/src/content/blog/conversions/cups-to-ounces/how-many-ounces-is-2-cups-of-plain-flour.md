faqQ1: "Does 2 cups of plain flour always equal 8.8 ounces?"
faqA1: "While 2 cups of plain flour generally equals 8.8 ounces (250g), slight variations can occur based on how you measure. Spooning and levelling gives the most consistent results. Humidity and flour brand can also cause minor weight differences."
faqQ2: "Can I use this conversion for self-raising flour in my air fryer?"
faqA2: "Self-raising flour weighs slightly less due to added raising agents. For 2 cups of self-raising flour, expect about 8.5 ounces (240g). Always adjust measurements when substituting flour types in air fryer recipes for best results."
faqQ3: "Why does my air fryer baking sometimes turn out dry?"
faqA3: "Dry results often come from too much flour. If you’ve used volume measurements (cups) instead of weight (ounces), you might have accidentally added extra flour. Weighing ingredients prevents this common air fryer baking issue."
faqQ4: "How do I convert ounces to grams for flour measurements?"
faqA4: "1 ounce equals approximately 28.35 grams. So 8.8 ounces of plain flour is about 250g. Most UK recipes use grams, so keeping a conversion chart handy helps when adapting recipes for your air fryer."

<p>2 cups of plain flour equals approximately 8.8 ounces (250 grams) in the UK.

<h2>Why accurate flour measurements matter</h2>  
<p>Using the correct weight for flour is crucial because volume measurements can vary. A loosely packed cup of plain flour weighs less than a tightly packed one, leading to inconsistent results. In air fryer cooking, precise measurements help avoid overly dense or dry outcomes. For example, air fryer cookies or cakes rely on the right flour-to-liquid ratio. If you’re exploring new <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a>, always measure by weight for reliability.</p>  

<p>Many UK bakers prefer weighing ingredients for accuracy, especially in air fryer baking where even small deviations can affect texture. Digital kitchen scales are a worthwhile investment for anyone serious about air frying.

<h2>How to measure 2 cups of plain flour correctly</h2>  
<p>To ensure you’re getting the right 8.8 ounces (250g) from 2 cups of plain flour, spoon the flour into the measuring cup and level it off with a knife. Avoid scooping directly from the bag, as this compacts the flour and leads to excess. This method is particularly important for air fryer batters and doughs, where precision ensures even cooking.</p>  

<h3>Using a kitchen scale for better accuracy</h3>  
<p>For the most reliable results, skip the cups and weigh your flour directly. Place your mixing bowl on a digital scale, tare it to zero, then add flour until you reach 8.8 ounces (250g). This eliminates guesswork and guarantees consistency, whether you’re making air fryer bread or coating chicken for crispy tenders.</p>

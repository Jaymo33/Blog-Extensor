<p>To measure 0.25 cup of lemonade accurately, use a liquid measuring cup with clear markings. Fill it to the ¼ cup line, which is equivalent to 2 oz. If you don’t have a measuring cup, a standard UK tablespoon holds 0.5 oz, so four tablespoons will give you the correct amount. This method works for both homemade and store-bought lemonade.</p>

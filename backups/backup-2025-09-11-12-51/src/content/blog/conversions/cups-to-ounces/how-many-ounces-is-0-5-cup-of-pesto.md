faqQ1: "Can I use jarred pesto for the 0.5 cup to ounces conversion?"
faqA1: "Yes, jarred pesto works perfectly for this conversion. Whether homemade or store-bought, 0.5 cup of any pesto equals about 4 ounces. Just ensure you stir it well before measuring, as oils can separate."
faqQ2: "Why does my air fryer pesto recipe taste different with 0.5 cup measurements?"
faqA2: "Air fryers intensify flavours, so 4 ounces of pesto might taste stronger than in oven-baked dishes. Try reducing to 3 ounces (slightly under 0.5 cup) if the flavour is too intense. The high heat concentrates the basil and garlic notes."
faqQ3: "How many calories are in 0.5 cup (4 ounces) of pesto?"
faqA3: "Approximately 500-600 calories, depending on the pesto brand or recipe. The olive oil and nuts in pesto make it calorie-dense, so measure carefully if watching portions. Air frying helps use less pesto while still getting great flavour."
faqQ4: "Can I freeze 0.5 cup portions of pesto for later use?"
faqA4: "Absolutely! Freezing 4-ounce portions in ice cube trays or small containers works perfectly. Thaw overnight in the fridge before using in air fryer recipes. This preserves freshness for up to 3 months."

faqQ1: "Can I use toasted sesame seeds instead of raw for 0.375 cup measurements?"
faqA1: "Yes, toasted sesame seeds can be substituted measure-for-measure (0.375 cup = 1.5 oz). However, they’re slightly denser due to reduced moisture, so pack them lightly when measuring by volume. Toasting enhances their nutty flavour, ideal for air-fried dishes."
faqQ2: "How do I convert 0.375 cup of sesame seeds to grams?"
faqA2: "0.375 cup of sesame seeds weighs approximately 42.5 grams. If your recipe uses metric measurements, a kitchen scale ensures precision. This conversion is handy for European air fryer recipes or when following dietary guidelines."
faqQ3: "Do black sesame seeds weigh the same as white ones for 0.375 cup?"
faqA3: "Black and white sesame seeds have nearly identical weights—0.375 cup of either equals ~1.5 oz. Black seeds have a stronger flavour, so consider taste preferences when substituting. Both work well in air fryer coatings or garnishes."
faqQ4: "What’s the best way to store leftover sesame seeds after measuring 0.375 cup?"
faqA4: "Store unused sesame seeds in an airtight container in a cool, dark place for up to 6 months. For longer freshness, refrigerate or freeze them. Proper storage prevents rancidity, ensuring your next 0.375 cup measurement tastes fresh."

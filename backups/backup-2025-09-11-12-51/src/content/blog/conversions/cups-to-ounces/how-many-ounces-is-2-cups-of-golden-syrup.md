faqQ1: "Can I use a liquid measuring cup for golden syrup?"
faqA1: "Yes, but golden syrup’s thickness makes it tricky. Lightly grease the cup with oil first to help it pour out cleanly. For the most accurate 2-cup (24-ounce) measurement, a kitchen scale is best."
faqQ2: "Does golden syrup weigh the same as other syrups?"
faqA2: "No, golden syrup is denser than many liquid sweeteners. While 2 cups of water weigh about 16 ounces, golden syrup weighs 24 ounces due to its high sugar content. Always check specific conversions for accuracy."
faqQ3: "How do I convert 2 cups of golden syrup to grams?"
faqA3: "2 cups of golden syrup equals 680 grams. This conversion is handy for UK recipes, especially when using an air fryer, where precise measurements ensure even cooking and perfect texture."
faqQ4: "Can I reduce golden syrup in air fryer recipes to cut sugar?"
faqA4: "Yes, but it may affect texture and browning. For every 2 cups (24 ounces), try reducing by 2-3 ounces and monitor cooking time closely. The dish may need slightly less time in the air fryer."

<p>2 cups of golden syrup equals approximately 24 ounces (680 grams). This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes, where precise measurements can make all the difference. Whether you’re whipping up a sticky pudding or glazing meats, knowing how many ounces are in 2 cups of golden syrup ensures perfect results every time.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Golden syrup is a staple in many British desserts and savoury dishes, and its thick consistency means small measurement errors can throw off a recipe. In an air fryer, where cooking times are shorter and temperatures higher, getting the right balance of ingredients is crucial. Too much syrup can lead to overly sticky or burnt results, while too little might leave your dish lacking sweetness.</p>

<h2>How to measure golden syrup for air fryer recipes</h2>  
<p>Measuring golden syrup can be tricky due to its sticky texture. To get an accurate 2-cup measurement (24 ounces), lightly grease your measuring cup with oil or butter to help the syrup slide out easily. Alternatively, use a kitchen scale for precision—680 grams is the equivalent weight for 2 cups.</p>  

<h3>Using a kitchen scale for better accuracy</h3>  
<p>If you’re serious about air fryer cooking, investing in a digital kitchen scale is a game-changer. Simply place your bowl on the scale, tare it to zero, then pour in golden syrup until you hit 680 grams (24 ounces). This method eliminates guesswork and ensures consistent results.</p>

<p>One popular dish is air fryer flapjacks, where golden syrup binds oats into a chewy, sweet treat. Another favourite is glazed chicken wings—brushed with a mix of golden syrup, soy sauce, and garlic for a sticky, finger-licking finish.</p>  

<h3>Adjusting recipes for different air fryer models</h3>  
<p>Not all air fryers cook the same way, so you may need to tweak quantities slightly. If your air fryer runs hot, reduce the golden syrup by an ounce to prevent burning. For larger models, you might need to increase the amount to ensure even coverage.</p>  

<h2>Storing golden syrup for air fryer use</h2>  
<p>To keep golden syrup fresh between uses, store it in an airtight container at room temperature. If it crystallises, gently warm the jar in hot water to restore its smooth texture. Proper storage ensures your syrup is always ready for your next air fryer creation.</p>

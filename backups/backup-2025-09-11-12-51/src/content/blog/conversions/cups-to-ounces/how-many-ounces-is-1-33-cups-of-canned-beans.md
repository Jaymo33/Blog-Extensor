faqQ1: "Does the type of canned bean affect the weight per cup?"
faqA1: "Yes, different beans have slight density variations. For instance, black beans are slightly heavier than chickpeas per cup. However, 1.33 cups of most canned beans will still average around 10.64 ounces when drained. Always check your recipe for specifics."
faqQ2: "Can I use dried beans instead of canned for this measurement?"
faqA2: "Dried beans require soaking and cooking before measuring. Once prepared, 1.33 cups of cooked dried beans will weigh roughly the same as canned (about 10.64 oz). Adjust cooking times in the air fryer, as dried beans may need extra moisture."
faqQ3: "How do I convert 1.33 cups of canned beans to grams?"
faqA3: "10.64 ounces is approximately 302 grams. This conversion is useful for international recipes or if your kitchen scale uses metric measurements. Most air fryer recipes on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>our site</a> include both units."
faqQ4: "Why does my air fryer recipe call for 1.33 cups instead of a whole can?"
faqA4: "Recipes often specify 1.33 cups to avoid waste or balance flavours. A standard 400g can yields about 1.5 cups drained, so 1.33 cups (10.64 oz) leaves a small portion for another use. It also prevents overcrowding in the air fryer basket."

<p>1.33 cups of canned beans equals approximately 10.64 ounces. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements ensure perfect results. Whether you’re making chilli, bean burgers, or a quick side dish, knowing the exact weight helps with consistency. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we focus on accurate conversions to make cooking easier.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on even heat distribution, so ingredient quantities must be precise. Too many beans can overcrowd the basket, leading to uneven cooking. Too few might dry out or burn. For dishes like air-fried bean patties or loaded nachos, 1.33 cups (10.64 oz) of canned beans is a common measurement. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more handy tips.</p>  

<p>Using canned beans is convenient, but draining and rinsing them affects weight. A 400g can typically yields about 1.5 cups (240g) after draining. If your recipe calls for 1.33 cups, you’ll need roughly ¾ of a standard can.

<h3>How to Measure Canned Beans for Air Fryer Recipes</h3>  
<p>For accuracy, use a kitchen scale to weigh 10.64 ounces of drained beans. If you don’t have one, lightly pack the beans into a measuring cup. Avoid pressing down, as this can compress them and skew the measurement. Recipes like air-fryer black bean tacos or spicy chickpeas rely on this precision.</p>  

<h2>Common Recipes Using 1.33 Cups of Canned Beans</h2>  
<p>This measurement works well for many air fryer dishes. Try crispy roasted chickpeas, bean-stuffed peppers, or cheesy bean dip. Each benefits from the 10.64-ounce quantity for balanced texture and flavour. Visit <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>our recipe hub</a> for inspiration.</p>

<h3>Adjusting Recipes for Different Bean Types</h3>

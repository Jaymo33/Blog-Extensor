faqQ1: "Does the type of almond affect the weight per cup?"

faqQ2: "Can I use ground almonds instead of whole ones in recipes?"
faqA2: "Absolutely! Ground almonds (almond flour) can be substituted, but measure by weight (6.5 oz) rather than volume for accuracy. This ensures your air fryer recipes turn out perfectly every time."
faqQ3: "How do I convert ounces to grams for almonds?"
faqA3: "To convert 6.5 ounces of almonds to grams, multiply by 28.35. This gives you approximately 184 grams. This conversion is handy for recipes using metric measurements."
faqQ4: "Why is weighing almonds better than measuring by volume?"
faqA4: "Weighing almonds gives you precise amounts, as how they settle in a cup can vary. For consistent results in air fryer recipes, especially with coatings or crusts, weighing (6.5 oz for 1.33 cups) is best."

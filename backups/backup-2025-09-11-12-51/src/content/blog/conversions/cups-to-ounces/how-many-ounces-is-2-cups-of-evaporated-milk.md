faqQ1: "Is evaporated milk the same as condensed milk?"
faqA1: "No, evaporated milk and condensed milk are different. Evaporated milk is unsweetened and has about 60% of the water removed, while condensed milk is sweetened and much thicker. Always check your recipe to avoid mix-ups."
faqQ2: "Can I use regular milk instead of evaporated milk in air fryer recipes?"
faqA2: "You can substitute regular milk, but the results may differ. Evaporated milk is richer and creamier, so your dish might be less dense. For best results, stick to evaporated milk if the recipe calls for it."
faqQ3: "How do I store leftover evaporated milk?"
faqA3: "Transfer any unused evaporated milk to an airtight container and refrigerate. It will keep for about 3-5 days. You can also freeze it for up to 3 months, but the texture may change slightly when thawed."
faqQ4: "Why is measuring by weight better than volume for evaporated milk?"
faqA4: "Measuring by weight (ounces or grams) is more accurate because evaporated milk's thickness can vary. Volume measurements (cups) can be inconsistent, especially if the milk isn’t evenly poured. A kitchen scale ensures precision."

faqQ1: "Can I use honey instead of maple syrup in air fryer recipes?"
faqA1: "Yes, honey can substitute maple syrup in most recipes, but the flavour will differ. Use the same weight (3 oz for 0.375 cup) for consistency. Honey is slightly thicker, so you may need to thin it with water or oil for glazes."
faqQ2: "How do I prevent maple syrup from burning in the air fryer?"
faqA2: "Lower the temperature by 10-15°C and reduce cooking time slightly. Brush syrup onto food in thin layers rather than pouring it in. Always check progress halfway through to avoid overcooking."
faqQ3: "Is 0.375 cup of maple syrup the same as 3 fluid ounces?"
faqA3: "Yes, in terms of volume, 0.375 cup equals 3 fluid ounces. However, for weight, maple syrup is denser than water, so 3 fluid ounces weighs about 3.2 oz. For precision in baking, weigh it."
faqQ4: "Can I freeze leftover maple syrup for later use?"
faqA4: "Absolutely! Maple syrup freezes well for up to a year. Portion it into airtight containers in 0.375 cup (3 oz) amounts for easy thawing. Reheat gently before using in air fryer recipes."

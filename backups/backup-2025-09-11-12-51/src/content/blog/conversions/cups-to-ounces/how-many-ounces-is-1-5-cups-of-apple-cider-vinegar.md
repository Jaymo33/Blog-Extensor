faqQ1: "Does the type of vinegar affect the cup-to-ounce conversion?"
faqA1: "No, the conversion remains the same regardless of vinegar type. 1 cup of any vinegar (apple cider, white, balsamic) equals 8 fluid ounces. However, stronger vinegars may need recipe adjustments for flavour balance."
faqQ2: "Can I use a kitchen scale instead of measuring cups for apple cider vinegar?"
faqA2: "Yes! 1.5 cups of apple cider vinegar weighs approximately 340 grams. Using a digital scale can be more accurate than volume measurements, especially for air fryer recipes where precision matters."
faqQ3: "Why do some UK recipes use millilitres instead of cups for vinegar?"
faqA3: "Millilitres are the standard metric measurement in the UK. 1.5 cups equals 355ml, but most UK recipes round this to 350ml for simplicity. Always check if your recipe uses US or UK measurements."
faqQ4: "How should I store leftover apple cider vinegar after measuring 1.5 cups?"
faqA4: "Keep it in its original bottle or a glass container with a tight lid. Store in a cool, dark place away from heat sources. Properly stored vinegar lasts nearly indefinitely, though its quality is best within 2 years."

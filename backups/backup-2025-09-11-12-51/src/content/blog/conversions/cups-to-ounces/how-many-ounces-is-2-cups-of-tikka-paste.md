faqQ1: "Can I use grams instead of ounces for tikka paste measurements?"
faqA1: "Yes, 16 ounces of tikka paste equals roughly 454 grams. Many UK scales toggle between units, so choose whichever you prefer. Grams offer even finer precision for recipes requiring exact ratios."
faqQ2: "Does the brand of tikka paste affect the weight per cup?"
faqA2: "Slightly—thicker brands may weigh more per cup, but the difference is minimal. For reliability, stick to the 16-ounce (2-cup) standard unless the recipe specifies otherwise. Always check the label for density notes."
faqQ3: "How long can I marinate meat with 2 cups of tikka paste?"
faqA3: "Marinate for at least 2 hours, or overnight for deeper flavour. The air fryer’s high heat locks in the spices quickly, so even shorter marination works. Avoid exceeding 24 hours, as the acidity can toughen the meat."
faqQ4: "Can I freeze dishes made with 2 cups of tikka paste?"
faqA4: "Absolutely! Cooked tikka dishes freeze well for up to 3 months. Portion them by weight (e.g., 8-ounce servings) before freezing. Reheat in the air fryer at 180°C for 10–12 minutes for best texture."

<h2>Why Convert Cups to Ounces for Tikka Paste?</h2>

<h2>How to Measure 2 Cups of Tikka Paste Accurately</h2>  
<p>To measure 2 cups of tikka paste correctly, use a liquid measuring cup for sticky consistencies. Scoop the paste gently, levelling it off with a spatula for precision. If you don’t have measuring cups, a kitchen scale set to ounces (16 oz for 2 cups) works perfectly.</p>  
<p>For thicker pastes, lightly grease the measuring cup to ensure easy release. This trick is especially useful when prepping <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/lamb>air fryer lamb tikka</a>.

<h3>Common Mistakes When Measuring Tikka Paste</h3>  
<p>Avoid packing the paste tightly into the cup, as this leads to excess and skewed measurements. Similarly, eyeballing instead of weighing can throw off your recipe’s balance. For consistent results, stick to the 16-ounce benchmark for 2 cups.</p>  

<h2>Using 2 Cups of Tikka Paste in Air Fryer Recipes</h2>  
<p>With 16 ounces of tikka paste, you can marinate up to 1.5 kg of protein, ideal for batch cooking. The air fryer’s even heat distribution ensures the paste caramelises beautifully without burning.

<h3>Storing Leftover Tikka Paste</h3>  
<p>Transfer unused paste to an airtight container, labelling it with the weight (e.g., “8 oz left”). Refrigerated, it lasts up to a week, or freeze it in ounce-portioned cubes for future use. This minimises waste and streamlines cooking.</p>

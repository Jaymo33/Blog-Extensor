faqQ1: "Can I use a kitchen scale to measure 0.375 cup of granulated sugar?"
faqA1: "Absolutely! A kitchen scale is the most accurate way to measure 0.375 cup of granulated sugar, which equals roughly 2.65 oz. Simply set your scale to ounces, tare it with your bowl, and add sugar until you hit the correct weight. This method eliminates guesswork and ensures perfect results for air fryer recipes."
faqQ2: "Does 0.375 cup of granulated sugar weigh the same as brown sugar?"
faqA2: "No, brown sugar is denser due to its molasses content. While 0.375 cup of granulated sugar weighs about 2.65 oz, the same volume of packed brown sugar is closer to 3 oz. Always check your recipe’s requirements and adjust measurements accordingly for best results in your air fryer."
faqQ3: "How do I convert 0.375 cup of granulated sugar to grams?"
faqA3: "0.375 cup of granulated sugar converts to approximately 75 grams. This is handy if your air fryer recipe uses metric measurements. For precise conversions, refer to our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>, which covers various ingredients and units."
faqQ4: "Why does my air fryer recipe specify weight instead of volume for sugar?"
faqA4: "Weight measurements are more consistent than volume, as sugar can settle or vary in density. Air fryer recipes often specify weight to ensure even cooking and perfect texture. If your recipe lists ounces or grams, use a scale for accuracy—especially with small quantities like 0.375 cup."

<p>0.375 cup of granulated sugar equals approximately 2.65 ounces (oz) in UK measurements. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes, where precise ingredient quantities can make or bake your dish. Whether you’re whipping up a batch of cookies or a light sponge cake, knowing the exact weight ensures consistent results. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we focus on delivering accurate conversions to help you master air fryer baking. Keep reading for detailed tips and common pitfalls when measuring sugar for your air fryer.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate sugar measurements matter in air fryer baking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers cook food faster and more evenly than traditional ovens, making precise measurements crucial. Too much sugar can cause over-browning or even burning, while too little may leave your baked goods bland. Granulated sugar, in particular, affects texture and moisture retention in recipes. For example, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer cookie recipes</a> rely on the right sugar ratio for that perfect chew. Always use a kitchen scale for the most accurate results, especially when dealing with small quantities like 0.375 cup.</p>  

<p>If you’re working with other ingredients, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for quick reference. This tool simplifies switching between cups, grams, and ounces, so you’ll never second-guess measurements again. Whether you’re baking or reheating, precision ensures your air fryer delivers restaurant-quality results every time.</p>  

<h3>How to measure 0.375 cup of granulated sugar without a scale</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a kitchen scale, use the spoon-and-level method for dry ingredients. Lightly spoon granulated sugar into a measuring cup until it’s slightly heaped, then level it off with a straight edge. Avoid packing the sugar down, as this can lead to over-measuring. For 0.375 cup, you’ll need 6 tablespoons (since 1 cup = 16 tablespoons). This method works well for most <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>air fryer cake recipes</a>, ensuring your batter isn’t too dense or too sweet.</p>  

<h2>Common mistakes when converting cups to ounces</h2>  
<p>One frequent error is confusing fluid ounces (volume) with weight ounces (mass). Granulated sugar’s weight differs from liquids like milk or oil, so always check the type of ounce required. Another pitfall is using US cup measurements instead of UK standards, which can skew results. For example, 0.375 US cup of granulated sugar is roughly 2.65 oz, but slight variations may occur based on sugar density. Always double-check your recipe’s origin to avoid discrepancies.</p>

<h3>Adjusting recipes for different sugar types</h3>  
<p>Granulated sugar isn’t your only option—brown sugar, caster sugar, and powdered sugar all weigh differently. For instance, 0.375 cup of packed brown sugar weighs about 3 oz due to its moisture content. If substituting, adjust quantities accordingly to maintain your recipe’s balance. This is especially important in air fryer baking, where even small deviations can affect cooking times and textures.</p>

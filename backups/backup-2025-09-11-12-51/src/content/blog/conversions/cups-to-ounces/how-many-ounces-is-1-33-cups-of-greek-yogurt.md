faqQ1: "Can I use regular yogurt instead of greek yogurt in air fryer recipes?"
faqA1: "Yes, but regular yogurt is thinner, so you’ll need slightly less. For 1.33 cups of greek yogurt (10.64 oz), use about 1.5 cups of regular yogurt to match the consistency. Adjust cooking times slightly, as the extra moisture may affect crispiness."
faqQ2: "How do I store leftover greek yogurt for air fryer recipes?"
faqA2: "Keep it in an airtight container in the fridge for up to two weeks. Stir well before reusing, as separation is normal. For longer storage, freeze portions in ice cube trays and thaw as needed."
faqQ3: "Why does my air fryer recipe with greek yogurt turn out soggy?"
faqA3: "Sogginess usually means too much yogurt was added. Stick to 10.64 oz (1.33 cups) and pat proteins dry before cooking. Also, avoid overcrowding the basket—airflow is key for crispiness."
faqQ4: "Is greek yogurt healthier in air fryer recipes?"
faqA4: "Greek yogurt has more protein and less sugar than regular yogurt, making it a nutritious choice. It also creates lighter, crispier coatings for air-fried foods compared to heavy creams or mayo-based mixes."

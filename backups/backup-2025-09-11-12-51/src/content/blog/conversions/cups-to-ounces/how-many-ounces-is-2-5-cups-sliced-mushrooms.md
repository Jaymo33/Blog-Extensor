faqQ1: "How do I convert 2.5 cups of sliced mushrooms to grams?"
faqA1: "2.5 cups of sliced mushrooms equal approximately 283 grams. This conversion is useful for precise air fryer recipes, especially when following European measurements. A kitchen scale ensures accuracy for perfect results."
faqQ2: "Can I use whole mushrooms instead of sliced for this measurement?"
faqA2: "Yes, but you’ll need about 20 medium whole mushrooms to match 2.5 cups sliced. Slicing increases volume, so adjust quantities if your recipe specifies chopped or diced. Always check your air fryer’s capacity to avoid overcrowding."
faqQ3: "Why do my mushrooms shrink in the air fryer?"
faqA3: "Mushrooms contain high water content, which evaporates during cooking, causing shrinkage. Pre-measuring 2.5 cups (10 oz) ensures you have enough post-cooking. For best results, avoid overcrowding and cook at 180°C for even texture."
faqQ4: "How should I store leftover sliced mushrooms?"
faqA4: "Store unused sliced mushrooms in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 3 days. For longer storage, freeze them in portions. When ready to use, reheat in the air fryer for 2-3 minutes to restore texture."

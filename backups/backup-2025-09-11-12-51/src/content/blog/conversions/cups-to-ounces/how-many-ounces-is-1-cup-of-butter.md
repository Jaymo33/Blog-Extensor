faqQ1: "Does 1 cup of melted butter weigh the same as solid butter?"
faqA1: "Yes, 1 cup of melted butter still equals 8 ounces by weight. However, melted butter measures differently in volume, so always weigh it for accuracy in baking or air fryer recipes."
faqQ2: "How many ounces are in a UK stick of butter?"
faqA2: "A standard UK block of butter is 250g (about 8.8 ounces), slightly more than 1 cup. For precise measurements, check packaging or use a kitchen scale."
faqQ3: "Can I use oil instead of butter in air fryer recipes?"
faqA3: "Yes, but adjust quantities since oil is 100% fat, while butter contains water. Use about 3/4 cup oil for every 1 cup of butter, and check recipe notes for best results."
faqQ4: "Why do some recipes list butter in grams instead of cups?"
faqA4: "Grams are more precise, especially in baking. Cups can vary based on how butter is packed. For consistent air fryer results, weighing ingredients is often recommended."

<h3>Measuring butter without scales</h3>

<h2>Common butter conversions for air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Here’s a quick reference for butter measurements in ounces and cups:</p>  
<ul>  
<li>1/4 cup butter = 2 ounces</li>  
<li>1/2 cup butter = 4 ounces</li>  
<li>1 cup butter = 8 ounces</li>  
<li>2 cups butter = 16 ounces (1 pound)</li>  
</ul>  

<p>These conversions are handy when scaling recipes up or down. For savoury dishes like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>air fryer chicken</a>, butter measurements ensure crispy, golden results. Sweet treats like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cookies>air fryer cookies</a> also rely on precise butter quantities.</p>  

<h3>Does butter type affect weight?</h3>  
<p>Salted, unsalted, or whipped butter all weigh roughly the same per cup. However, whipped butter has more air, so it’s less dense. For accurate results, stick to standard block butter in recipes. If using spreads, check labels for oil content, as this can alter measurements.</p>

faqQ1: "Can I use cow’s milk instead of goat milk in air fryer recipes?"
faqA1: "Yes, you can substitute cow’s milk for goat milk in most recipes. However, goat milk has a tangier flavour and slightly different fat content, which may alter the taste and texture. Use the same measurement (0.33 cup or 2.64 oz) for consistency."
faqQ2: "How do I measure 0.33 cup of goat milk without a measuring cup?"
faqA2: "If you don’t have a measuring cup, use a kitchen scale to weigh 2.64 ounces of goat milk. Alternatively, 0.33 cup is roughly one-third of a standard cup, so you can eyeball it by dividing the cup into three equal parts."
faqQ3: "Does goat milk affect cooking times in an air fryer?"
faqA3: "Goat milk itself doesn’t significantly change cooking times, but the moisture content might. If your recipe includes a lot of liquid, like a batter or sauce, adjust cooking times slightly to account for evaporation in the air fryer."

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of ingredients is crucial when cooking with an air fryer. Unlike traditional ovens, air fryers circulate hot air rapidly, which can affect cooking times and textures. A slight variation in liquid measurements, like goat milk, can alter the outcome of your recipe. For example, too much liquid might make your batter too runny, while too little could dry out your dish. That’s why converting 0.33 cup of goat milk to ounces (2.64 oz) helps maintain precision.</p>  

<p>If you’re working with air fryer recipes, especially baked goods or sauces, consistency is key. Goat milk adds richness and moisture, but the wrong amount can throw off the balance.

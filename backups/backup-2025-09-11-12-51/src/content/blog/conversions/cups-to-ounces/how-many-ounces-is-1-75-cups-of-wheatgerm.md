faqQ1: "Can I use wheatgerm as a substitute for breadcrumbs in my air fryer?"
faqA1: "Absolutely! Wheatgerm makes an excellent substitute for breadcrumbs in air fryer recipes. It provides a similar crunch and can be used to coat chicken, fish, or vegetables. Just remember that wheatgerm has a nuttier flavour, so it may alter the taste slightly compared to traditional breadcrumbs."
faqQ2: "How should I store wheatgerm to keep it fresh for air fryer recipes?"
faqA2: "Wheatgerm contains natural oils that can go rancid if not stored properly. Keep it in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 6 months, or freeze it for longer storage. This ensures it stays fresh for all your air fryer creations."
faqQ3: "Does wheatgerm cook differently in an air fryer compared to other coatings?"
faqA3: "Wheatgerm cooks similarly to other coatings in an air fryer but may brown faster due to its natural oils. Keep an eye on your food during cooking and consider reducing the temperature by about 10°C if needed. It also helps to lightly spray with oil for even crisping."
faqQ4: "Can I use wheatgerm in sweet air fryer recipes?"
faqA4: "Yes, wheatgerm works wonderfully in sweet air fryer recipes. Try mixing it into muffin or cake batters for added nutrition, or use it as a crunchy topping for fruit crisps. Its nutty flavour pairs well with cinnamon, honey, and other sweet spices."

faqQ1: "Can I use vegetable broth instead of chicken broth in this measurement?"
faqA1: "Yes, you can substitute vegetable broth for chicken broth in the same measurement (0.125 cup equals 1 oz). The conversion remains the same, but keep in mind the flavour profile will differ slightly. This works well for vegetarian air fryer recipes."
faqQ2: "How do I measure 0.125 cup of chicken broth without a measuring cup?"
faqA2: "If you don't have a measuring cup, you can use tablespoons. 0.125 cup equals 2 tablespoons of chicken broth. Alternatively, a kitchen scale can measure 1 oz (28 grams) of broth. These methods ensure accuracy for your air fryer recipes."
faqQ3: "Does the type of chicken broth affect the ounce measurement?"
faqA3: "No, the type of chicken broth (regular, low-sodium, or homemade) doesn't change the volume-to-weight conversion. 0.125 cup will always equal 1 oz. However, thicker or reduced broths may weigh slightly more, so for precision, stick to standard liquid broth."
faqQ4: "Can I use this measurement for other liquids in air fryer recipes?"
faqA4: "Yes, this conversion applies to most liquids with a similar density to water, like stock, milk, or juice. However, thicker liquids like syrup or oil may differ slightly. Always check specific conversions for these ingredients when preparing air fryer dishes."

Just be sure to level off the broth for accuracy.</p>

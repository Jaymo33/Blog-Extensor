faqQ1: "Can I use evaporated milk instead of condensed milk in air fryer recipes?"
faqA1: "Evaporated milk isn't a direct substitute for condensed milk as it lacks the sugar content. Condensed milk is sweetened and thicker, which affects texture and flavour in recipes. If substituting, you'd need to add sugar and reduce other liquids, but results may vary."
faqQ2: "How should I store leftover condensed milk after opening?"
faqA2: "Transfer any unused condensed milk to an airtight container and refrigerate. It typically lasts 2-3 weeks when properly stored. Always check for changes in smell or texture before using in your air fryer recipes."
faqQ3: "Why do UK recipes often use ounces for condensed milk measurements?"
faqA3: "The UK traditionally uses metric measurements, but many baking recipes still reference ounces for precision. Weight measurements (like ounces) are more accurate than volume (like cups) for ingredients like condensed milk."
faqQ4: "Can I freeze condensed milk for later use in air fryer recipes?"
faqA4: "Yes, condensed milk freezes well for up to 3 months. Thaw in the refrigerator before using, and stir well to restore consistency. Freezing in portion-sized amounts (like 20 ounce batches) makes future recipe prep easier."

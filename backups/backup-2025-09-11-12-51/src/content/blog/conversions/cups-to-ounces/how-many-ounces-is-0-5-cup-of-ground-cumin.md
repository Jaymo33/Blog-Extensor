faqQ1: "Can I use whole cumin seeds instead of ground cumin in my air fryer recipes?"
faqA1: "Yes, you can use whole cumin seeds, but they’ll need to be toasted and ground for the best flavour. Whole seeds have a longer shelf life but may not distribute as evenly in dishes. Adjust measurements slightly, as whole seeds are less concentrated than ground cumin."
faqQ2: "How do I convert 0.5 cup of ground cumin to grams?"
faqA2: "0.5 cup of ground cumin weighs roughly 42 grams. If your recipe uses metric measurements, a kitchen scale will help you get the exact amount. This conversion is handy for international recipes or if you prefer using grams over ounces."
faqQ3: "Does the brand of ground cumin affect the weight per cup?"
faqA3: "Different brands may have slight variations in density, but the difference is usually minimal. For accuracy, always measure by weight (ounces or grams) if precision is crucial. Sticking to one trusted brand can also help maintain consistency in your cooking."
faqQ4: "Can I substitute ground coriander for ground cumin in air fryer recipes?"
faqA4: "While both spices have earthy notes, they’re not identical. Ground coriander is milder and citrusy, so it won’t replicate cumin’s warmth. If substituting, start with a smaller amount and adjust to taste. For best results, stick to cumin when the recipe calls for it."

<h2>Understanding the conversion</h2>
<p>Porridge oats are a staple in many kitchens, especially for those who love quick and healthy breakfasts. When converting cups to ounces, it’s important to note that 1 cup of porridge oats typically weighs around 3.2 ounces. Therefore, 1.75 cups would be roughly 5.6 ounces. This measurement is particularly useful when following recipes on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, where precision matters.</p>

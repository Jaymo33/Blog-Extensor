faqQ1: "Does the type of orange juice affect the ounce measurement?"
faqA1: "No, the type of orange juice doesn't affect the fluid ounce measurement. Whether fresh-squeezed, concentrate, or store-bought, 1.5 cups will always equal 12 fluid ounces. However, viscosity may vary slightly between types, but the volume measurement remains consistent for air fryer recipes."
faqQ2: "Can I use weight ounces instead of fluid ounces for orange juice?"
faqA2: "Fluid ounces measure volume, while weight ounces measure mass. For orange juice, 1.5 cups (12 fluid ounces) weighs approximately 12.5 weight ounces due to density differences. In air fryer cooking, always use fluid ounces for liquid measurements unless the recipe specifies otherwise."
faqQ3: "How does 1.5 cups of orange juice convert to millilitres?"
faqA3: "1.5 cups of orange juice equals approximately 355 millilitres. This conversion is useful for UK cooks using metric measurements. Many air fryer recipes provide both imperial and metric measurements for convenience, especially on international cooking sites like airfryerrecipe.co.uk."
faqQ4: "Why do some air fryer recipes specify orange juice in ounces rather than cups?"
faqA4: "Recipes may specify ounces for precision, as measuring cups can vary slightly. Ounces provide a more exact measurement, crucial for air fryer cooking where small quantity differences can affect results. Using a kitchen scale for fluid ounces ensures accuracy in your orange juice measurements."

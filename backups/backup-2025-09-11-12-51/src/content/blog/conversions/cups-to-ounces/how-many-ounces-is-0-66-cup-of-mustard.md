faqQ1: "Can I use dry mustard instead of prepared mustard for 0.66 cup measurements?"
faqA1: "Dry mustard and prepared mustard have different densities, so 0.66 cup of dry mustard won't weigh the same as prepared mustard. For dry mustard, 0.66 cup is roughly 3 ounces, not 5.28 ounces. Adjust your recipe accordingly or check a conversion chart for accuracy."
faqQ2: "How does the type of mustard affect the weight of 0.66 cup?"
faqA2: "Dijon, yellow, and whole-grain mustards have slightly different densities, but the difference in weight for 0.66 cup is minimal. All types will weigh close to 5.28 ounces. For precise results, especially in air fryer recipes, weighing with a scale is best."
faqQ3: "What if I don’t have a measuring cup for 0.66 cup of mustard?"
faqA3: "If you don’t have a measuring cup, use tablespoons: 0.66 cup equals 10.56 tablespoons. Alternatively, weigh 5.28 ounces on a kitchen scale. These methods ensure you get the right amount for your air fryer recipes."
faqQ4: "Why is 0.66 cup of mustard a common measurement in recipes?"
faqA4: "0.66 cup (5.28 oz) of mustard is often used because it balances flavour without overwhelming dishes. It’s enough to coat proteins like chicken or salmon evenly, making it a versatile quantity for air fryer marinades and glazes."

faqQ1: "Can I use fresh peas instead of frozen peas in my air fryer?"
faqA1: "Yes, you can use fresh peas, but they may cook faster than frozen ones. Fresh peas are softer and contain more moisture, so reduce cooking time by 1-2 minutes. If substituting, use the same weight (3.17 ounces for 0.66 cup) for consistency."
faqQ2: "How do I prevent frozen peas from sticking together in the air fryer?"
faqA2: "Lightly toss the peas in a teaspoon of oil before air frying to prevent clumping. Shake the basket halfway through cooking to ensure even heat distribution. Avoid overcrowding, as this can cause peas to stick and cook unevenly."
faqQ3: "What’s the best temperature to air fry frozen peas?"
faqA3: "375°F (190°C) is ideal for air frying frozen peas. Cook for 5-7 minutes, shaking the basket once. This temperature ensures they’re heated through without becoming mushy. Adjust slightly based on your air fryer model."
faqQ4: "Can I season frozen peas before air frying them?"
faqA4: "Absolutely! Toss the peas with salt, pepper, garlic powder, or herbs before cooking for extra flavour. A light coating of oil helps the seasoning adhere. Experiment with spices to match your dish—paprika or lemon zest work well too."

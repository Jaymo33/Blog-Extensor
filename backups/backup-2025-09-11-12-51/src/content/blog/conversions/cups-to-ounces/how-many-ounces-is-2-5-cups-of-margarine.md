faqQ1: "Can I use butter instead of margarine in air fryer recipes?"
faqA1: "Yes, you can substitute butter for margarine in most air fryer recipes. However, butter has a slightly higher fat content, so you may need to adjust cooking times. Use the same weight (20 ounces for 2.5 cups) for best results."
faqQ2: "Why does my air fryer recipe turn out greasy with margarine?"
faqA2: "Greasy results often mean too much margarine was used. Ensure you’re accurately measuring 2.5 cups (20 ounces) and not packing it down. Also, patting excess margarine off ingredients before air frying can help reduce grease."
faqQ3: "How do I store leftover margarine for future air fryer use?"
faqA3: "Store opened margarine in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 3 months. For longer storage, freeze it in measured portions (like 20-ounce blocks for 2.5 cups) to simplify future recipe prep."
faqQ4: "Is margarine healthier than butter for air frying?"
faqA4: "Margarine often contains less saturated fat than butter, making it a popular choice for healthier cooking. However, always check labels, as some margarines contain trans fats. For balanced air fryer meals, moderation is key with any fat."

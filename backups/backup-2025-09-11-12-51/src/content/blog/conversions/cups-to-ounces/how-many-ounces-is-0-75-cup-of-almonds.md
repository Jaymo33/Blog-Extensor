faqQ1: "Can I use whole almonds instead of sliced for 0.75 cup measurements?"
faqA1: "Yes, you can use whole almonds, but the weight will be the same (3.5 ounces). However, sliced almonds may distribute more evenly in recipes like coatings or granola. If using whole almonds, consider chopping them slightly for better texture in air fryer dishes."
faqQ2: "How do I adjust cooking time when using 0.75 cup of almonds in an air fryer?"
faqA2: "Almonds cook quickly in an air fryer, usually taking 5-8 minutes at 160°C. If they’re part of a larger recipe, like a crust, follow the main ingredient’s cooking time. Always check for golden colour and aroma to avoid burning."
faqQ3: "Is 0.75 cup of almonds the same as 0.75 cup of almond flour?"
faqA3: "No, almond flour is much finer and denser, so 0.75 cup of almond flour weighs around 2.5 ounces (70 grams). Always check whether your recipe calls for whole almonds, chopped, or flour, as the weight differs significantly."
faqQ4: "Can I substitute other nuts for almonds in a 0.75 cup measurement?"
faqA4: "Yes, but weights vary. For example, 0.75 cup of walnuts is about 3 ounces, while pecans are closer to 3.25 ounces. Adjust slightly if substituting, and consider flavour differences in your air fryer recipe. Always weigh for accuracy if possible."

<h2>Why accurate almond measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>

<h2>How to measure 0.75 cup of almonds accurately</h2>  
<p>Measuring almonds by volume can be tricky because their size and shape vary. For the most accurate results, use a kitchen scale to weigh out 3.5 ounces (100 grams). If you don’t have a scale, lightly pack the almonds into a measuring cup without crushing them. Avoid heaping the cup, as this can lead to an excess of almonds and throw off your recipe.</p>

Remember, air fryers work best with precise measurements, so always double-check your conversions.</p>

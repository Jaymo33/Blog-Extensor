faqQ1: "Can I use goat milk instead of cow’s milk in air fryer recipes?"
faqA1: "Yes, goat milk works well as a substitute for cow’s milk in most air fryer recipes. It has a slightly tangier flavour and creamier texture, which can enhance dishes like custards or sauces. Just remember to use the same measurement—2 cups of goat milk equals 16 ounces."
faqQ2: "Does goat milk weigh the same as cow’s milk per cup?"
faqA2: "Yes, both goat milk and cow’s milk weigh roughly the same per cup—about 8 ounces per cup or 16 ounces for 2 cups. The density is similar, so you can swap them without adjusting measurements. However, goat milk may froth or brown differently due to its fat content."
faqQ3: "How do I store leftover goat milk for air fryer recipes?"
faqA3: "Leftover goat milk can be refrigerated for up to a week in a sealed container. For longer storage, freeze it in portions labelled with the date. Thaw in the fridge overnight and give it a good stir before using, as separation is normal."
faqQ4: "Can I use powdered goat milk in air fryer recipes?"
faqA4: "Yes, powdered goat milk can be reconstituted and used in air fryer recipes. Follow the package instructions to mix it with water, aiming for the equivalent of 2 cups (16 oz) of liquid milk. Keep in mind that the texture might be slightly less creamy than fresh goat milk."

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on precise ingredient ratios to deliver crispy, evenly cooked results. Using the correct amount of goat milk ensures your recipes aren’t too dry or overly liquid.

Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> simplifies these calculations, so you never second-guess your measurements. Consistency is key, especially when experimenting with new dishes.</p>

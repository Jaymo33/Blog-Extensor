faqQ1: "Can I use a regular measuring cup for semolina?"
faqA1: "Yes, but for accuracy, fluff the semolina first and spoon it lightly into the cup without packing it down. For best results, use a kitchen scale to confirm the weight (5.3 ounces per cup). This ensures consistency, especially in air fryer recipes."
faqQ2: "Does semolina weigh the same as all-purpose flour?"
faqA2: "No, semolina is denser and coarser than all-purpose flour. One cup of all-purpose flour weighs about 4.25 ounces, while semolina weighs approximately 5.3 ounces per cup. Always check recipe requirements to avoid texture issues."
faqQ3: "Why does my air-fried semolina coating turn out soggy?"
faqA3: "Sogginess often results from overcrowding the air fryer basket or insufficient preheating. Ensure semolina-coated items are spaced evenly and cooked at the right temperature. Patting ingredients dry before coating also helps."
faqQ4: "Can I substitute semolina with cornmeal in air fryer recipes?"
faqA4: "Yes, but the texture will differ. Cornmeal is lighter and less binding than semolina, so adjust quantities slightly. For crispiness, combine it with breadcrumbs. Test small batches to perfect the ratio."

<p>One cup of semolina weighs approximately 5.3 ounces (150 grams). Whether you're preparing air fryer recipes or traditional dishes, knowing this conversion ensures perfect results every time. Semolina, a coarse flour made from durum wheat, is a staple in many cuisines, from pasta to desserts. Accurate measurements are key, especially when using an air fryer, where ingredient ratios can affect texture and cooking times.

<h2>Why Accurate Semolina Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of semolina is crucial for achieving the desired consistency in dishes like couscous, gnocchi, or even air-fried breaded coatings. Too much or too little can alter texture and cooking performance. In air fryers, precise measurements help avoid uneven cooking or overly dense results. Semolina’s granular texture means it packs differently than finer flours, so weighing it ensures consistency.

<p>Semolina is also hygroscopic, meaning it absorbs moisture from the environment. This can slightly affect weight, so measuring by ounces or grams is more reliable than volume. If you’re adapting a recipe from cups to weight, always use a kitchen scale for accuracy. Air fryer recipes, in particular, benefit from precise measurements to ensure even crisping and browning.

<h3>How to Measure Semolina Correctly</h3>  
<p>To measure 1 cup of semolina accurately, fluff it with a spoon before lightly spooning it into a measuring cup. Avoid packing or tapping the cup, as this compacts the semolina and leads to excess. Level off the top with a straight edge for consistency. For best results, use a digital scale to confirm the weight—5.3 ounces per cup. This method is especially useful for air fryer recipes, where precision impacts cooking time and texture.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for Semolina in Air Fryers</h2>  
<p>Semolina adds a delightful crunch to air-fried foods, from crispy chicken coatings to golden falafel. Its high gluten content helps bind ingredients while creating a satisfying texture. Try dusting air fryer baskets with semolina to prevent sticking, or mix it with breadcrumbs for extra crunch. For a creative take, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>air-fried chicken recipes</a> using semolina coatings.</p>  

<p>Beyond savoury dishes, semolina works wonders in air-fried desserts like halva or semolina cakes. Its granular texture absorbs flavours beautifully, making it versatile for sweet and savoury applications. Always measure carefully to avoid overly dense or dry results.

<h3>Converting Semolina Measurements for Recipes</h3>  
<p>If a recipe calls for ounces but you only have cups, remember that 1 cup equals 5.3 ounces. For larger batches, multiply accordingly—e.g., 2 cups = 10.6 ounces. This conversion is handy when scaling air fryer recipes or adjusting portion sizes.

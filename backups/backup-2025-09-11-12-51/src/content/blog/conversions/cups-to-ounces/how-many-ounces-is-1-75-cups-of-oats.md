faqQ1: "Can I use rolled oats and quick oats interchangeably when measuring 1.75 cups?"
faqA1: "Yes, but the texture will differ. Rolled oats are thicker and provide more crunch, while quick oats absorb moisture faster. For 1.75 cups (5.6 oz), both work, but adjust cooking times slightly in the air fryer."
faqQ2: "How do I store leftover oats after measuring 1.75 cups?"
faqA2: "Store unused oats in an airtight container in a cool, dry place. They’ll stay fresh for months, ready for your next air fryer recipe. For longer storage, freeze them in a sealed bag."
faqQ3: "Why does my air fryer recipe with 1.75 cups of oats turn out too dry?"
faqA3: "This usually happens if the oats aren’t coated evenly with wet ingredients. Try mixing in a bit more liquid (like oil or honey) before air frying. Also, check your air fryer’s temperature settings."
faqQ4: "Can I substitute steel-cut oats for 1.75 cups of rolled oats in air fryer recipes?"
faqA4: "Steel-cut oats are denser and take longer to cook, so they’re not ideal for direct substitution. If using them, pre-cook slightly and reduce the quantity to avoid a tough texture in the air fryer."

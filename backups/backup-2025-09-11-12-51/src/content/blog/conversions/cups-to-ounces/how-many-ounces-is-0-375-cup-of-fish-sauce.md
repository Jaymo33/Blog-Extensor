faqQ1: "Can I use a regular cup to measure 0.375 cup of fish sauce?"
faqA1: "Yes, but for accuracy, use a liquid measuring cup with clear markings. Dry measuring cups can lead to slight variations due to fish sauce’s thickness. If possible, weigh it for the most precise result."
faqQ2: "Does the brand of fish sauce affect the weight per cup?"
faqA2: "Slight differences exist between brands due to salt content and additives. However, 0.375 cup will generally weigh around 3 ounces. For best results, stick to one brand per recipe."
faqQ3: "How do I adjust a recipe if I only have a 1-cup measure?"
faqA3: "Fill the cup halfway (0.5 cup), then remove half of that to get 0.375 cup. Alternatively, use tablespoons—0.375 cup equals 6 tablespoons. A scale simplifies this process."
faqQ4: "Can I substitute fish sauce with something else in air fryer recipes?"
faqA4: "Soy sauce or Worcestershire sauce can work, but adjust quantities as they’re less intense. For a vegetarian option, try mushroom sauce. Always taste and tweak as needed."

<p>0.375 cup of fish sauce equals approximately 3 ounces. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements can make or break a dish. Whether you’re marinating chicken or adding depth to a stir-fry, knowing the exact weight ensures consistency. Fish sauce, a staple in many Asian-inspired dishes, can be tricky to measure by volume due to its viscosity. That’s why converting cups to ounces is so helpful for accuracy.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on even cooking, and incorrect measurements can throw off the balance of flavours and textures. Too much fish sauce can overpower a dish, while too little might leave it bland. For recipes like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer salmon</a> or <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken wings</a>, precise amounts ensure perfect results every time. Using a kitchen scale for liquids like fish sauce eliminates guesswork. If you don’t have one, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a> can help.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure Fish Sauce Without a Scale</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a scale, use a liquid measuring cup for fish sauce. Fill it to the 0.375 cup mark, then pour into a spoon or small bowl to estimate ounces. Remember, 1 fluid ounce is roughly 2 tablespoons, so 3 ounces would be about 6 tablespoons. For sticky liquids like fish sauce, lightly greasing the measuring cup helps it slide out easily. Always level off the top for the most accurate measurement.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for Fish Sauce in Air Fryer Recipes</h2>  
<p>Fish sauce adds umami depth to marinades, glazes, and dipping sauces.

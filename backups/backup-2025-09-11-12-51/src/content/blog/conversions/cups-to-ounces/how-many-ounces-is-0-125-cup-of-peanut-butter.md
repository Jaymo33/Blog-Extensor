faqQ1: "Is 0.125 cup of peanut butter the same as 1 ounce?"
faqA1: "Yes, 0.125 cup of peanut butter is approximately 1 ounce. However, slight variations can occur depending on the peanut butter’s brand and consistency. For absolute precision, especially in baking, using a kitchen scale is recommended."
faqQ2: "Can I use crunchy peanut butter instead of smooth for this measurement?"
faqA2: "Yes, crunchy and smooth peanut butter have similar densities, so 0.125 cup will still be roughly 1 ounce. Just ensure you measure it packed to account for any air gaps in crunchy varieties. Stir well if using natural peanut butter to incorporate the oils evenly."
faqQ3: "How do I measure 0.125 cup without a measuring cup?"
faqA3: "Use tablespoons: 0.125 cup equals 2 tablespoons. For sticky peanut butter, lightly coat the spoon with oil to help it slide off cleanly. Level the top with a knife for an accurate measurement."
faqQ4: "Why does my air fryer recipe call for such a small amount of peanut butter?"
faqA4: "Air fryers excel with precise, small-batch cooking. 0.125 cup (1 oz) of peanut butter is often enough for glazes, coatings, or single servings. Using too much can lead to uneven cooking or excess oiliness. Always follow recipe measurements for best results."

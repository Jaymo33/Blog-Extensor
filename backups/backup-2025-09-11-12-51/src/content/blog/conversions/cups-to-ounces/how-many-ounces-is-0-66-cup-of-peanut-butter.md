faqQ1: "How do I measure 0.66 cup of peanut butter without a measuring cup?"
faqA1: "You can use a kitchen scale to weigh out 5.28 ounces of peanut butter, which equals 0.66 cup. Alternatively, fill a standard cup two-thirds full. For sticky ingredients like peanut butter, spraying the measuring cup with oil first helps it slide out easily."
faqQ2: "Does the type of peanut butter affect the weight of 0.66 cup?"
faqA2: "Yes, slightly. Creamy peanut butter is denser than crunchy, so 0.66 cup may weigh a bit more. Natural peanut butter with oil separation can also vary. For air fryer recipes, we recommend using standard creamy peanut butter for consistent results."
faqQ3: "Can I use this conversion for other nut butters?"
faqA3: "Absolutely! Almond butter, cashew butter, and other nut butters have similar densities to peanut butter. 0.66 cup of most nut butters will be close to 5.28 ounces, though it’s always best to check with a scale for precision in air fryer cooking."
faqQ4: "Why would I need exactly 0.66 cup of peanut butter for air fryer recipes?"
faqA4: "0.66 cup (5.28 oz) is a common measurement for scaling down standard recipes that call for 1 cup. It’s perfect for smaller air fryer batches or when you want to reduce quantities. Many air fryer dessert recipes use this amount for perfect portioning."

faqQ1: "Does the type of harissa paste affect the ounce measurement per cup?"
faqA1: "Yes, the thickness and brand of harissa paste can slightly affect the weight per cup. Commercial brands tend to be more consistent, with 1 cup weighing about 8.5 ounces. Homemade versions might vary depending on ingredient ratios and preparation method."
faqQ2: "Can I use the same conversion for other spicy pastes in my air fryer?"
faqA2: "While the 1 cup to 8.5 ounces conversion works well for harissa paste, other spicy pastes like sambal or gochujang might have different weights due to varying ingredients and textures. It's always best to check specific conversions for each paste type when using them in air fryer recipes."

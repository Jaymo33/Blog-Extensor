<p>Honey is denser than many other liquids, so volume measurements like cups don't always translate neatly to weight. That's why knowing how many ounces are in 0.25 cup of honey is so helpful. It ensures you're using the right amount, whether you're following a recipe or experimenting with your own creations.</p>

<h2>How to Measure Honey Accurately</h2>
<p>Measuring honey can be tricky due to its sticky consistency. To get an accurate 0.25 cup of honey, lightly grease your measuring cup with oil or spray to help the honey slide out easily. This method ensures you're not leaving behind sticky residue that could throw off your measurements.</p>

<p>If you're converting 0.25 cup of honey to ounces, a kitchen scale is your best friend. Simply tare your scale with the container on it, then pour the honey until you reach 3 ounces. This method is especially useful for air fryer recipes, where precision can affect cooking times and results.</p>

<p>Measuring flour by volume (cups) can be tricky because it compacts easily. The best way to measure 1.33 cups of flour is to fluff it first, then spoon it into the measuring cup. Level it off with a straight edge for accuracy. This method helps avoid packing too much flour into the cup, which could throw off your recipe.</p>

<h3>Using a kitchen scale for precision</h3>

This eliminates guesswork and ensures your air fryer recipes turn out perfectly every time.

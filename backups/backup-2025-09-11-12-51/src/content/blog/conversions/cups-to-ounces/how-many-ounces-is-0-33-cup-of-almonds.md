faqQ1: "Can I use whole almonds instead of sliced for 0.33 cup measurements?"
faqA1: "Yes, you can use whole almonds, but the weight may vary slightly. Sliced almonds pack differently, so 0.33 cup of whole almonds might weigh a tad more. For air fryer recipes, either works—just adjust cooking time if needed."
faqQ2: "How do I convert 0.33 cup of almonds to grams?"
faqA2: "0.33 cup of almonds (1.5 oz) is roughly 42.5 grams. If your recipe uses grams, a kitchen scale is the most accurate tool. This conversion is handy for European or UK-based air fryer recipes."
faqQ3: "Do roasted almonds weigh the same as raw for 0.33 cup?"
faqA3: "Roasted almonds are slightly lighter due to moisture loss, but the difference is minimal. For most air fryer recipes, you can use the same 1.5-ounce measurement without issues."
faqQ4: "Can I substitute other nuts for almonds in this measurement?"
faqA4: "Yes, but weights vary by nut type. For example, 0.33 cup of walnuts is about 1.3 ounces. Always check a conversion chart or weigh substitutes for best results in air fryer cooking."

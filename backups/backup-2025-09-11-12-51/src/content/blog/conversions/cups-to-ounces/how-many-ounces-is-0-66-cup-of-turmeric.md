faqQ1: "Can I use ground turmeric instead of fresh for 0.66 cup measurements?"
faqA1: "Yes, ground turmeric is typically used for dry measurements like 0.66 cup (2.64 oz). Fresh turmeric has a different density, so adjust accordingly—about 1 tbsp grated fresh turmeric equals 1 tsp ground."
faqQ2: "Does 0.66 cup of turmeric weigh the same as other spices?"
faqA2: "No, spice weights vary. For example, 0.66 cup of cinnamon is lighter (about 1.8 oz), while 0.66 cup of cumin is closer to 2.4 oz. Always check a conversion chart for accuracy."
faqQ3: "How should I store leftover turmeric after measuring 0.66 cup?"
faqA3: "Keep it in an airtight container away from light and heat. Proper storage maintains flavour and potency, especially if you’ve pre-measured 0.66 cup (2.64 oz) portions for future use."
faqQ4: "Can I substitute turmeric with another spice in air fryer recipes?"
faqA4: "While turmeric has a unique earthy flavour, mild curry powder or saffron (in small amounts) can work. Adjust quantities since 0.66 cup (2.64 oz) of substitutes may taste different."

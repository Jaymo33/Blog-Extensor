faqQ1: "Can I use milliliters instead of ounces for 1.5 cups of double cream?"
faqA1: "Yes! 1.5 cups of double cream equals about 355 milliliters (ml). While ounces are weight-based, milliliters measure volume, so ensure your recipe specifies which unit to use. For air fryer recipes, weight (ounces) is often more precise."
faqQ2: "Does the brand of double cream affect the ounce conversion?"
faqA2: "Most UK double creams have a similar density, so 1.5 cups will still be roughly 12 ounces. However, premium brands with higher fat content may be slightly denser. When in doubt, weigh it for accuracy, especially for air fryer baking."
faqQ3: "How do I convert 1.5 cups of double cream to grams?"
faqA3: "1.5 cups of double cream is approximately 340 grams. Grams are a metric weight measurement, making them ideal for air fryer recipes where precision matters. Use a kitchen scale for the best results."
faqQ4: "Can I freeze 1.5 cups of double cream for later use in air fryer recipes?"
faqA4: "Freezing double cream isn’t recommended, as it can separate and become grainy when thawed. For air fryer recipes, it’s best to use fresh double cream measured to 12 ounces (1.5 cups) for optimal texture."

faqQ1: "Can I use grams instead of ounces for measuring mayonnaise?"
faqA1: "Yes, you can use grams for more precision. 0.33 cup of mayonnaise is approximately 75 grams. Many kitchen scales allow you to switch between ounces and grams, making it easy to follow recipes from different regions."
faqQ2: "How does the thickness of mayonnaise affect the measurement?"
faqA2: "Thicker mayonnaise may settle differently in a measuring cup, so it’s best to stir it first for an accurate read. If you’re using a scale, thickness won’t affect the weight, as 2.64 ounces will always be 2.64 ounces regardless of consistency."
faqQ3: "What if my recipe calls for 0.33 cup of mayonnaise but I only have a jar?"
faqA3: "No problem! Simply use a spoon to scoop out the mayonnaise into a measuring cup until you reach the 0.33 cup mark. For thicker jars, a rubber spatula can help scrape out every bit."
faqQ4: "Are there low-fat alternatives that measure the same as regular mayonnaise?"
faqA4: "Low-fat or light mayonnaise can be substituted in the same amount (0.33 cup or 2.64 ounces), but the texture and flavour might differ slightly. For best results in air fryer recipes, stick to full-fat versions unless the recipe specifies otherwise."

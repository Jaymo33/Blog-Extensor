faqQ1: "Is 2.5 cups of sugar syrup the same as 20 ounces in the UK?"
faqA1: "Yes, 2.5 cups of sugar syrup is approximately 20 ounces in both US and UK measurements. While UK cups are slightly larger (284 ml vs. 240 ml), the difference is negligible for syrup due to its density. Always use a scale for precision."
faqQ2: "Can I use a kitchen scale to measure 2.5 cups of sugar syrup?"
faqA2: "Absolutely! A kitchen scale is the most accurate way to measure sugar syrup. Simply set your scale to ounces and pour until it reads 20 oz. This eliminates errors from air bubbles or uneven pouring in measuring cups."
faqQ3: "How does sugar syrup affect air fryer cooking times?"
faqA3: "Sugar syrup can caramelise quickly in an air fryer, so reduce temperatures by 5–10°C to prevent burning. For glazes, apply them in the last few minutes of cooking. Always monitor dishes with syrup closely."
faqQ4: "What’s the best way to clean sugar syrup from an air fryer basket?"
faqA4: "Soak the basket in warm, soapy water to loosen sticky residue. For tough spots, use a soft brush or <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner</a>. Avoid abrasive scrubbers to protect non-stick coatings."

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on even cooking, and incorrect measurements can throw off textures and flavours. Sugar syrup, for instance, affects caramelisation and moisture levels. Too much or too little can ruin a dish, especially in baked goods or glazes. That’s why converting 2.5 cups of sugar syrup to ounces (20 oz) is so important.

<p>Many air fryer recipes, like cakes or sticky wings, call for sugar syrup. Measuring by weight (ounces) is often more reliable than volume (cups). This avoids inconsistencies due to syrup density or settling. If you’re experimenting with recipes, always double-check conversions.

<h3>How to Measure Sugar Syrup Correctly</h3>  
<p>Use a liquid measuring cup for sugar syrup, filling it to the 2.5-cup mark at eye level. For ounces, a kitchen scale is ideal—simply pour until it hits 20 oz. If your recipe uses UK measurements, note that 1 UK cup is slightly larger, but 2.5 cups still roughly equate to 20 oz.

<h3>Tips for Storing Leftover Sugar Syrup</h3>  
<p>After measuring 2.5 cups (20 oz), store extra syrup in an airtight container. Refrigeration prevents crystallisation, and it’ll last for weeks. Reheat gently before reusing in air fryer recipes to restore viscosity. Label containers with dates to track freshness.</p>

faqQ1: "Can I use whole almonds instead of ground almonds in my air fryer recipe?"
faqA1: "Yes, but you’ll need to grind them first for even cooking. Whole almonds won’t adhere as well to coatings or blend smoothly into batters. Use a food processor to grind them to a fine consistency, then measure out 0.375 cup (1.5 oz) as needed."
faqQ2: "How does the weight of ground almonds compare to almond flour?"
faqA2: "Ground almonds and almond flour are often interchangeable, but almond flour is typically finer. Weight-wise, 0.375 cup of almond flour also equals roughly 1.5 ounces. However, almond flour may yield a slightly smoother texture in baked goods."
faqQ3: "Why does my almond coating burn in the air fryer?"
faqA3: "Ground almonds can burn if cooked at too high a temperature or for too long. Try reducing the heat by 10-15°C and checking for doneness earlier. A light spritz of oil can also help even browning without scorching."
faqQ4: "Can I substitute ground almonds for breadcrumbs in air fryer recipes?"
faqA4: "Absolutely! Ground almonds make a great gluten-free alternative to breadcrumbs. Use the same weight—0.375 cup (1.5 oz)—for a crispy coating. They add a nutty flavour and work well with chicken, fish, or veggie dishes."

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter</h2>  
<p>When it comes to cooking, especially with an air fryer, exact measurements can make or break a dish. Ground almonds are often used in gluten-free baking or as a coating for proteins like chicken or fish. Too little, and your dish might lack texture; too much, and it could become dry. That’s why converting 0.375 cup of ground almonds to ounces (1.5 oz) is so important. If you're prepping a batch of almond-crusted salmon, this measurement ensures consistency. Explore more <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> that use ground almonds for inspiration.</p>  

<h3>How to measure ground almonds correctly</h3>  
<p>For the most accurate results, use a kitchen scale to weigh your ground almonds. Scooping directly from the bag can lead to uneven measurements due to settling or compacting. If you don’t have a scale, fluff the almonds lightly with a fork before spooning them into a measuring cup. Level off the excess with a straight edge for precision. This method ensures your 0.375 cup truly equals 1.5 ounces.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for ground almonds in air fryers</h2>  
<p>Ground almonds are a versatile ingredient in air fryer cooking. They work wonderfully as a coating for chicken tenders, fish fillets, or even tofu, providing a crispy, nutty crust without deep-frying. They’re also a key component in gluten-free baking, such as almond flour cookies or cakes. If you're making almond-crusted cod, knowing that 0.375 cup equals 1.5 ounces helps you portion correctly.

<h3>Converting other almond measurements</h3>  
<p>If your recipe calls for a different amount of ground almonds, here’s a quick reference: 1 cup equals 4 ounces, 0.5 cup equals 2 ounces, and 0.25 cup equals 1 ounce. These conversions are handy when scaling recipes up or down. Remember, air fryer cooking often requires adjustments, so precise measurements like 0.375 cup to 1.5 ounces ensure success.</p>  

<h2>Storing ground almonds for freshness</h2>  
<p>To keep your ground almonds fresh, store them in an airtight container in a cool, dark place. They can also be refrigerated or frozen for longer shelf life. Proper storage prevents rancidity, which can affect the taste of your air fryer dishes. If you’re using them frequently, consider buying in bulk and portioning out 0.375 cup (1.5 oz) amounts for convenience.</p>  

<h3>Cleaning your air fryer after using ground almonds</h3>  
<p>Ground almonds can leave a fine residue in your air fryer basket. To clean it effectively, wipe down the basket with a damp cloth or use our recommended <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner</a>.

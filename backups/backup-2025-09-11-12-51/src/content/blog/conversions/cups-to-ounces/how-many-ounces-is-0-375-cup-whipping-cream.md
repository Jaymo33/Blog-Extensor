faqQ1: "Can I use double cream instead of whipping cream in this measurement?"
faqA1: "Yes, you can substitute double cream for whipping cream in the same measurement (0.375 cup or 3 oz). However, double cream has a higher fat content, which may make your dish richer and thicker. Adjust other liquids slightly if needed."
faqQ2: "How do I measure 0.375 cup without a measuring cup?"
faqA2: "If you don’t have a measuring cup, use 6 tablespoons to equal 0.375 cup. Alternatively, a kitchen scale set to ounces will give you the exact 3 oz required. Tablespoons are a handy alternative for small measurements like this."
faqQ3: "Does whipped cream weigh the same as liquid whipping cream?"
faqA3: "No, whipped cream incorporates air, so its volume increases while its weight stays the same. If your recipe calls for 0.375 cup (3 oz) of liquid whipping cream, measure it before whipping for accuracy."
faqQ4: "Can I use this conversion for other liquids like milk?"
faqA4: "While 0.375 cup of milk is also roughly 3 oz, densities vary slightly. For best results, weigh liquids like milk or broth separately. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a> covers common liquids for air fryer cooking."

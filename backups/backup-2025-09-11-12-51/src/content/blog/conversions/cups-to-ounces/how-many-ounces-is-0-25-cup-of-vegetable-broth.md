faqQ1: "Can I use water instead of vegetable broth in my air fryer recipes?"

faqQ2: "How do I store leftover vegetable broth after measuring 0.25 cup?"
faqA2: "Store unused vegetable broth in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 4 days. For longer storage, freeze it in ice cube trays—each cube is about 1 ounce, making future measurements easy."
faqQ3: "Is 0.25 cup of vegetable broth the same as 2 fluid ounces?"
faqA3: "Yes, 0.25 cup of vegetable broth equals 2 fluid ounces. This measurement is consistent for most liquids, making it easy to swap ingredients in recipes without altering quantities."
faqQ4: "Why does my air fryer recipe call for such a small amount of vegetable broth?"
faqA4: "Air fryers circulate hot air, so too much liquid can create steam and affect crispiness. A small amount, like 0.25 cup (2 ounces), adds moisture without compromising texture. Always follow recipe guidelines for best results."

faqQ1: "Can I use dried minced onion instead of fresh for 2.5 cups?"
faqA1: "Yes, but dried minced onion is more concentrated. Use 5 tablespoons of dried minced onion to replace 2.5 cups of fresh, as it rehydrates during cooking. Adjust liquids in your recipe slightly to account for the difference."
faqQ2: "Does the type of onion affect the weight for 2.5 cups?"
faqA2: "Slightly. Sweet onions are denser than white or red onions, so 2.5 cups may weigh closer to 11 ounces. For most recipes, the 10-ounce standard works, but adjust to taste if using a sweeter variety."
faqQ3: "How do I convert 2.5 cups of minced onion to grams?"
faqA3: "10 ounces of minced onion equals roughly 283 grams. If your kitchen scale uses grams, this conversion ensures precision, especially for baking or international recipes."
faqQ4: "Can I substitute shallots for minced onion in this measurement?"
faqA4: "Yes, but shallots have a milder flavour. Use the same 2.5 cups (10 ounces), but note the taste will be subtler. Ideal for dishes where a delicate onion flavour is preferred."

faqQ1: "How do I measure 3 cups of vegetable broth without a measuring cup?"
faqA1: "If you don’t have a measuring cup, use a kitchen scale to weigh 24 oz of vegetable broth. Alternatively, a standard mug holds about 8 oz, so three mugs would equal 3 cups (24 oz)."
faqQ2: "Does the type of vegetable broth affect the weight in ounces?"
faqA2: "Most store-bought vegetable broths have a similar density, so 3 cups will still be roughly 24 oz. However, homemade broths may vary slightly depending on ingredients."
faqQ3: "Can I use chicken broth instead of vegetable broth in the same amount?"
faqA3: "Yes, you can substitute chicken broth for vegetable broth in a 1:1 ratio. Both are typically 8 oz per cup, so 3 cups would still be 24 oz."
faqQ4: "Why is my air fryer recipe too watery with 3 cups of broth?"
faqA4: "Air fryers circulate hot air, so liquids reduce slower than on a stove. Try using slightly less broth (e.g., 20 oz) or extending the cooking time to evaporate excess moisture."

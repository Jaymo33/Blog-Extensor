faqQ1: "How do I measure 0.125 cup of sesame oil without a measuring cup?"
faqA1: "You can use a tablespoon measure, as 0.125 cup equals 2 tablespoons. Alternatively, a kitchen scale set to ounces will give you 1 oz, which is the equivalent of 0.125 cup. For sticky oils like sesame, lightly coat the spoon with cooking spray for easier pouring."
faqQ2: "Is 0.125 cup of sesame oil the same in UK and US measurements?"
faqA2: "Yes, 0.125 cup of sesame oil equals 1 fluid ounce in both UK and US measurements. Fluid ounces are consistent across both systems, so no conversion is needed. This makes it easy to follow recipes from either region without adjustment."
faqQ3: "Can I substitute another oil for sesame oil in air fryer recipes?"
faqA3: "While you can substitute oils like olive or vegetable oil, sesame oil has a distinct nutty flavour that’s hard to replicate. If replacing, use slightly less than 0.125 cup (1 oz) of a milder oil, as sesame oil is more potent. Adjust to taste for best results."
faqQ4: "How should I store sesame oil to maintain its freshness?"
faqA4: "Store sesame oil in a cool, dark place or the refrigerator to prevent rancidity. Keep it tightly sealed, and use within 6 months for optimal flavour. If the oil smells off, discard it—fresh sesame oil is key for the best air fryer dishes."

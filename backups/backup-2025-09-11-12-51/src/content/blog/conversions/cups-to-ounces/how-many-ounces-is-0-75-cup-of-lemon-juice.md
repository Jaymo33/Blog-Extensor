faqQ1: "Can I use bottled lemon juice instead of fresh for 0.75 cup measurements?"
faqA1: "Yes, bottled lemon juice works fine for most recipes. However, fresh lemon juice often has a brighter flavour. If substituting, ensure the bottled juice is pure lemon juice without added preservatives or sweeteners."
faqQ2: "How does 0.75 cup of lemon juice affect cooking times in an air fryer?"
faqA2: "Lemon juice itself doesn’t significantly alter cooking times, but it can impact marinade absorption. For example, chicken marinated in 0.75 cup (6 fl oz) of lemon juice may cook slightly faster due to the acidity tenderising the meat."
faqQ3: "What’s the best way to squeeze 0.75 cup of lemon juice?"
faqA3: "Roll lemons on a countertop before cutting to maximise juice yield. You’ll need about 4–5 medium lemons for 0.75 cup (6 fl oz). A citrus juicer can make the process quicker and more efficient."
faqQ4: "Is 0.75 cup of lemon juice the same in weight ounces?"
faqA4: "No, fluid ounces measure volume, while weight ounces measure mass. 0.75 cup (6 fl oz) of lemon juice weighs approximately 177 grams, or about 6.2 weight ounces. Always use fluid ounces for liquid measurements in recipes."

faqQ1: "Can I use grated carrot instead of shredded carrot in air fryer recipes?"
faqA1: "Yes, but grated carrot is denser, so 0.66 cup may weigh closer to 3 ounces instead of 2.64 ounces. Adjust cooking times slightly, as grated carrot releases more moisture and may take longer to crisp."
faqQ2: "How do I prevent shredded carrot from sticking to the air fryer basket?"
faqA2: "Lightly coat the shredded carrot with a small amount of oil or use parchment liners designed for air fryers. Avoid overcrowding the basket to ensure even airflow and prevent clumping."
faqQ3: "Is 0.66 cup of shredded carrot the same as 2/3 cup?"
faqA3: "Yes, 0.66 cup is roughly equivalent to 2/3 cup. Both measurements yield about 2.64 ounces of shredded carrot, making them interchangeable in most recipes."
faqQ4: "Can I air fry shredded carrot alone for a crispy snack?"
faqA4: "Absolutely! Toss 0.66 cup (2.64 oz) of shredded carrot with a bit of oil and seasoning, then air fry at 180°C for 8–10 minutes, shaking halfway. It makes a light, crispy topping for salads or soups."

<h2>Tips for Storing Shredded Carrot</h2>

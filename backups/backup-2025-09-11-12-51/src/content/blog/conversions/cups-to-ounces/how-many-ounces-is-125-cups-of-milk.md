faqQ1: "Can I use almond milk instead of regular milk for 1.25 cups in air fryer recipes?"
faqA1: "Yes, almond milk can replace regular milk in a 1:1 ratio for 1.25 cups (10 oz). However, almond milk is thinner, so recipes may turn out slightly less creamy. For baking, consider adding a tablespoon of cornflour to thicken the mixture."
faqQ2: "How do I measure 1.25 cups of milk if I only have a 1-cup measure?"
faqA2: "Fill the 1-cup measure to the top, then add another 1/4 cup (4 tablespoons) to reach 1.25 cups (10 oz). Alternatively, use a kitchen scale to weigh out 10 oz for accuracy."
faqQ3: "Does 1.25 cups of milk weigh the same as 1.25 cups of water?"
faqA3: "No, milk is slightly denser than water. While 1.25 cups of water weighs 10 oz, milk weighs about 10.5 oz due to its fat content. For most recipes, the difference is negligible."
faqQ4: "Can I use evaporated milk instead of regular milk for 1.25 cups?"
faqA4: "Yes, but dilute evaporated milk with an equal part water first. For 1.25 cups (10 oz), mix 5 oz evaporated milk with 5 oz water. This substitution works well in creamy dishes like custards or sauces."

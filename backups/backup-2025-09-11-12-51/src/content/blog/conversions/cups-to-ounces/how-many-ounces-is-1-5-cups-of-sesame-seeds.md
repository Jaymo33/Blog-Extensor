faqQ1: "Can I use toasted sesame seeds instead of raw for air fryer recipes?"
faqA1: "Yes, toasted sesame seeds work well but reduce cooking time slightly to avoid burning. Their richer flavour enhances dishes like air-fried salmon or stir-fry veggies. Always check them mid-cook as they darken faster than raw seeds."
faqQ2: "How do I store leftover sesame seeds after measuring?"
faqA2: "Keep sesame seeds in an airtight container in a cool, dark place to maintain freshness. For longer storage, refrigerate them to prevent the natural oils from turning rancid. Proper storage ensures they’re ready for your next air fryer recipe."
faqQ3: "Why does 1.5 cups of sesame seeds weigh less than other nuts?"
faqA3: "Sesame seeds are smaller and less dense than nuts like almonds or walnuts, so they take up more volume per ounce. This lightness makes them ideal for even coating in air fryer recipes without overwhelming the dish."
faqQ4: "Can I substitute chia seeds for sesame seeds in air fryer recipes?"
faqA4: "Chia seeds can work but have a milder taste and gel-like texture when wet. For crispy results, stick to sesame seeds or mix both sparingly. Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable recipes</a> for more seed-topping ideas."

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Using the correct amount of sesame seeds ensures even cooking and prevents burning in your air fryer. Too many seeds can create excess oil, while too few may leave your dish lacking flavour. Air fryers circulate hot air rapidly, so balanced ingredient ratios are crucial. If you're experimenting with new recipes, visit <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>our recipe collection</a> for inspiration. Precise measurements also help when scaling recipes up or down for different serving sizes.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure Sesame Seeds Correctly</h3>  
<p>For the most accurate conversion, use a kitchen scale to weigh sesame seeds directly in ounces. If you don’t have one, lightly spoon the seeds into a measuring cup without packing them down. Avoid tapping the cup, as this compacts the seeds and skews the measurement. For air fryer-friendly dishes like sesame-crusted tofu or salmon, consistency is key—so measure carefully!</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for Sesame Seeds in Air Fryer Recipes</h2>

Try sprinkling them over <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>air-fryer chicken</a> or mixing them into homemade granola bars.

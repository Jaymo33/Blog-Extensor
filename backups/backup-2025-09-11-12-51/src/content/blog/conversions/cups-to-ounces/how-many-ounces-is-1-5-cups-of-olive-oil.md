<p>1.5 cups of olive oil equals 12 ounces, making it easy to measure for air fryer recipes. Whether you’re preparing crispy vegetables or marinating chicken, accurate measurements ensure perfect results every time. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we focus on precise conversions to help you cook with confidence.</p>  

<h2>Understanding olive oil measurements</h2>  
<p>Olive oil is a staple in many air fryer recipes, from roasting potatoes to baking salmon. Knowing how many ounces are in 1.5 cups helps you follow recipes accurately. Unlike water, olive oil has a different density, so volume-to-weight conversions matter. For UK cooks, 1.5 cups of olive oil translates to 12 ounces, ensuring your dishes turn out just right.</p>  

<p>If you’re using a kitchen scale, 12 ounces is the exact weight you need. This measurement is especially useful for recipes like our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer roasted vegetables</a>, where olive oil ensures crispiness. Always measure carefully to avoid over-pouring, which can affect texture and cooking times.</p>  

<h3>Why accurate measurements matter</h3>  
<p>Too much or too little olive oil can alter the outcome of your air fryer dishes. Excess oil may lead to soggy results, while too little can cause dryness. By converting 1.5 cups of olive oil to ounces, you maintain consistency across recipes. Check our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for other common measurements.</p>  

<h2>Converting cups to ounces for air frying</h2>  
<p>Many air fryer recipes list ingredients in cups, but weighing them in ounces can be more precise. For olive oil, 1 cup equals 8 ounces, so 1.5 cups is 12 ounces. This conversion is essential for dishes like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>air fryer chicken</a>, where even coating matters.</p>  

<p>If you don’t have a measuring cup, use a kitchen scale for accuracy. Simply set it to ounces and pour until you reach 12. This method eliminates guesswork and ensures your air fryer meals are perfectly cooked every time.</p>  

<h3>Common mistakes to avoid</h3>  
<p>One mistake is assuming all liquids weigh the same. Olive oil is denser than water, so 1.5 cups won’t weigh the same as 1.5 cups of broth. Always double-check conversions, especially when trying new recipes from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>.</p>  

<h2>Tips for measuring olive oil in air fryer recipes</h2>  
<p>For best results, use a clear measuring cup with ounce markings. Pour slowly to avoid spills and ensure accuracy. If your recipe calls for 1.5 cups of olive oil (12 ounces), lightly coat ingredients rather than drenching them. This technique works well for <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/potatoes>air fryer potatoes</a>.</p>  

<p>Another tip is to store olive oil in a squeeze bottle for controlled pouring. This helps distribute the oil evenly, especially when preparing smaller batches. Keeping your air fryer clean is also crucial—check our guide on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaning</a> for maintenance tips.</p>  

<h3>Scaling recipes up or down</h3>  
<p>If you need to adjust a recipe, remember that 1.5 cups of olive oil equals 12 ounces. For half the amount, use 6 ounces (0.75 cups). Scaling accurately ensures your air fryer dishes retain their intended flavour and texture.</p>

faqQ1: "Can I use thawed corn instead of frozen in air fryer recipes?"
faqA1: "Yes, but thawed corn will weigh slightly less due to water loss. If your recipe calls for 1 cup of frozen corn (5.5 ounces), you may need to adjust the quantity if using thawed. For best results, stick to frozen unless the recipe specifies otherwise."
faqQ2: "Does the brand of frozen corn affect the weight per cup?"
faqA2: "Most brands are similar, but there can be slight variations in kernel size or ice content. Always check the packaging for weight details if precision is crucial. Generally, 1 cup of frozen corn averages 5.5 ounces across major brands."
faqQ3: "How do I convert ounces to grams for frozen corn?"
faqA3: "1 ounce equals approximately 28.35 grams. So, 5.5 ounces of frozen corn is about 156 grams. Use a kitchen scale for the most accurate measurement, especially for baking or detailed recipes."
faqQ4: "Can I substitute canned corn for frozen in air fryer recipes?"
faqA4: "You can, but canned corn has a higher moisture content, which may affect crispiness. Drain it well and pat dry before using. Note that 1 cup of drained canned corn weighs roughly 6 ounces, slightly more than frozen. Adjust cooking times accordingly."

<h3>How to measure frozen corn correctly</h3>  
<p>To measure 1 cup of frozen corn accurately, use a dry measuring cup and level it off with a straight edge. Avoid packing the corn down, as this can lead to an incorrect weight. If you don’t have a scale, remember that 1 cup equals roughly 5.5 ounces. For larger batches, multiply accordingly—for example, 2 cups would be around 11 ounces.</p>  

<h2>Converting cups to ounces for other frozen foods</h2>  
<p>While 1 cup of frozen corn is 5.5 ounces, other frozen vegetables may differ slightly. For instance, 1 cup of frozen peas weighs about 5 ounces, and frozen broccoli florets come in at roughly 4.5 ounces per cup.

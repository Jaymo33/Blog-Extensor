faqQ1: "Why is weighing flour better than measuring by cups?"
faqA1: "Weighing flour in ounces provides greater accuracy because cup measurements can vary based on how the flour is packed. A densely packed cup holds more flour than a lightly scooped one, leading to inconsistent results. For air fryer baking, precision is key to achieving the right texture."
faqQ2: "Can I use this conversion for self-raising flour?"
faqA2: "No, self-raising flour has added raising agents, which affect its weight. For self-raising flour, 1.75 cups would weigh slightly less due to the aeration from baking powder. Always check specific conversion charts for different flour types."
faqQ3: "How do I adjust air fryer recipes if I only have cups?"
faqA3: "If a recipe lists flour in ounces but you only have cups, use the conversion 1.75 cups = 7.7 oz. For best results, invest in a kitchen scale to ensure accuracy, especially for air fryer recipes where even cooking is crucial."
faqQ4: "Does humidity affect flour measurements?"
faqA4: "Yes, humidity can cause flour to clump and absorb moisture, making it denser. In humid conditions, fluff the flour before measuring or use a scale for accuracy. This is particularly important for air fryer baking, where moisture levels impact cooking times."

<h2>Why Accurate Flour Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Baking is a science, and even small measurement discrepancies can affect your results. Using 1.75 cups of plain flour without converting to ounces might lead to dense or dry baked goods. Air fryers, in particular, require precise ingredient ratios due to their rapid cooking method. A slight imbalance in flour can alter the texture of your <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer cakes</a> or bread. That’s why weighing flour in ounces is the gold standard for professional and home bakers alike.</p>  

<p>Measuring by weight eliminates inconsistencies caused by how flour is scooped or packed. One cup of sifted flour weighs less than a cup of densely packed flour, which is why volume measurements can be unreliable.

Remember, 1.75 cups of plain flour converts to 7.7 oz, a handy figure to keep in mind for quick reference.</p>

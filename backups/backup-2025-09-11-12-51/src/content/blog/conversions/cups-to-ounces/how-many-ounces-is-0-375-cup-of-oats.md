faqQ1: "Does the type of oat affect the 0.375 cup to ounce conversion?"
faqA1: "Yes, but only slightly. Rolled oats and quick oats both convert to about 1.5 ounces per 0.375 cup, while steel-cut oats are slightly denser at around 1.6 ounces for the same volume. For most air fryer recipes, the standard conversion works perfectly."
faqQ2: "Can I use this 0.375 cup measurement for gluten-free oats?"
faqA2: "Absolutely. Gluten-free oats have nearly identical volume-to-weight ratios as regular oats. The 0.375 cup to 1.5 ounce conversion remains accurate. Just ensure your other ingredients are also gluten-free if needed."
faqQ3: "How does this measurement work for making air fryer granola?"
faqA3: "0.375 cup (1.5 oz) of oats makes perfect single-serving granola in the air fryer. Combine with 1 tablespoon honey or maple syrup and bake at 160°C for 8-10 minutes, shaking halfway. This small batch prevents clumping and ensures even crisping."
faqQ4: "Why is measuring oats by weight better than volume for air frying?"
faqA4: "Weight measurements are more precise because oat volume can vary with settling and packing. For air fryer recipes where even cooking is crucial, weighing ensures consistent results. 0.375 cup equals 1.5 ounces by weight, eliminating measurement inconsistencies."

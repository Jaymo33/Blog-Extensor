faqQ1: "Does 1 cup of soy milk weigh the same as dairy milk?"
faqA1: "No, soy milk is slightly denser than dairy milk. While 1 cup of dairy milk weighs about 8.1 ounces, soy milk clocks in at approximately 8.45 ounces. This small difference can affect air fryer recipes, especially baked goods where precision matters."
faqQ2: "Can I use the same cup-to-ounce conversion for flavoured soy milk?"
faqA2: "Flavoured varieties like vanilla or chocolate soy milk may have added sugars, changing their weight slightly. For accuracy, check the carton’s ml-to-ounce listing or use a scale. In most cases, the difference is negligible for air frying."
faqQ3: "How do I convert 1 cup of soy milk to grams for UK recipes?"
faqA3: "1 cup (8.45 ounces) of soy milk equals roughly 240 grams. Many UK air fryer recipes use grams for precision. If your recipe specifies grams, this conversion ensures your dish turns out perfectly every time."
faqQ4: "Why does my air fryer recipe with soy milk turn out soggy?"
faqA4: "Excess liquid is a common culprit. Since air fryers circulate hot air, too much soy milk can steam food instead of crisping it. Try reducing the amount slightly or patting ingredients dry before cooking for better texture."

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on precise ingredient ratios to deliver crispy, evenly cooked dishes. Too much or too little liquid, like soy milk, can affect browning and texture. For example, adding extra soy milk to batter might make it too thin, leading to soggy results. Stick to the 8.45-ounce measure for 1 cup to keep recipes on track. Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a> for perfectly measured ideas.</p>  

<p>British measuring cups differ slightly from US standards, so using weight (ounces) eliminates confusion. A kitchen scale ensures accuracy, especially for baked goods like dairy-free muffins. If you’re adapting a traditional recipe for your air fryer, converting cups to ounces is a smart first step. Need inspiration?

<h3>How to measure soy milk without a scale</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a scale, use a liquid measuring cup designed for UK fluid ounces. Fill it to the 240ml mark for 1 cup of soy milk. Avoid dry measuring cups, as they can’t account for liquid density. For sticky ingredients like soy milk, lightly grease the cup for easier pouring.

<h2>Common recipes using 1 cup of soy milk</h2>  
<p>From vegan mac ‘n’ cheese to fluffy pancakes, soy milk is a versatile air fryer staple. A 1-cup (8.45-ounce) portion works perfectly in batters, sauces, and marinades.

<p>Adjusting oven recipes for air fryers? Reduce soy milk by 1-2 tablespoons to account for faster evaporation. The concentrated heat intensifies flavours, so precise measurements prevent overpowering tastes. Always preheat your air fryer for consistent results with liquid-heavy ingredients like soy milk.</p>  

<h3>Soy milk vs. dairy milk in air fryer recipes</h3>  
<p>Soy milk’s slightly thicker texture means it behaves differently than dairy milk at high heat. Its 8.45-ounce-per-cup density helps create crispier coatings, ideal for tofu or chicken. For best results, shake the carton well before measuring to evenly distribute proteins. Craving crunch?

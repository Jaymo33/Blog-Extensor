faqQ1: "Can I use grams instead of ounces for tahini measurements?"
faqA1: "Yes, grams are often more precise for baking and cooking. 2.5 cups of tahini equals roughly 567 grams. A kitchen scale will give you the most accurate results, especially for air fryer recipes where consistency is key."
faqQ2: "Why does my tahini measurement seem off when using cups?"
faqA2: "Tahini’s thickness means it can settle or trap air, leading to inconsistent cup measurements. For best results, stir it well before measuring or use a scale. Packing it tightly vs. loosely can also affect the weight."
faqQ3: "How long does tahini last once opened?"
faqA3: "Opened tahini lasts about 3–6 months in the fridge. Stir well before use, as oil separation is normal. If it smells rancid or develops mould, discard it."
faqQ4: "Can I substitute tahini in air fryer recipes?"
faqA4: "For a similar creamy texture, try cashew or almond butter, though the flavour will differ. If avoiding nuts, sunflower seed butter works too. Adjust liquids as needed for consistency."

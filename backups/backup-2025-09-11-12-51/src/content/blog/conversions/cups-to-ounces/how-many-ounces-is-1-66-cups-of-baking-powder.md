<p>1.66 cups of baking powder equals approximately 13.28 ounces. This conversion is essential for precise baking, especially when using an air fryer, where accurate measurements can make or break a recipe. Whether you’re whipping up cakes, bread, or even air fryer-friendly treats, knowing how to convert cups to ounces ensures consistency. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we understand the importance of getting measurements right for perfect results every time.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer recipes</h2>  
<p>Baking powder is a leavening agent, and using the correct amount is crucial for achieving the desired texture in your baked goods. Too little, and your cake won’t rise; too much, and it might taste bitter. When cooking in an air fryer, precise measurements become even more critical due to the appliance’s rapid cooking process. For example, if you’re making air fryer muffins or scones, 1.66 cups of baking powder (13.28 ounces) ensures the perfect lift without overdoing it.</p>  

<p>Many air fryer recipes, like those found on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>our recipes page</a>, rely on exact measurements to deliver consistent results. Whether you’re converting 1.66 cups of baking powder to ounces or adjusting other ingredients, accuracy is key. This is especially true for recipes like air fryer doughnuts or quick breads, where the right amount of baking powder ensures a light, fluffy texture.</p>  

<h3>How to measure baking powder correctly</h3>  
<p>To measure 1.66 cups of baking powder accurately, use a dry measuring cup and level it off with a straight edge. Scooping directly from the container can lead to compacted powder, resulting in more than needed. For best results, fluff the baking powder with a spoon before measuring. If you’re using a kitchen scale, 13.28 ounces is the target weight for 1.66 cups.</p>  

<h2>Common conversions for baking powder in air fryer recipes</h2>  
<p>Beyond 1.66 cups, it’s helpful to know other common conversions. For instance, 1 cup of baking powder equals 8 ounces, so 1.66 cups is just over 13 ounces.

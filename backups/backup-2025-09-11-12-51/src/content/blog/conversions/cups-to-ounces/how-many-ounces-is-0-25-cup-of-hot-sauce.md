faqQ1: "Can I use 0.25 cup of hot sauce for marinating chicken in the air fryer?"
faqA1: "Yes, 0.25 cup (2 oz) of hot sauce is perfect for marinating chicken wings or thighs in the air fryer. Mix it with a bit of oil and spices for even coating. Let it sit for at least 30 minutes before cooking for the best flavour."
faqQ2: "Does the type of hot sauce affect the 0.25 cup to ounces conversion?"
faqA2: "Most standard hot sauces (like Tabasco or Frank’s) will measure 0.25 cup as 2 oz. Thicker sauces (e.g., sriracha) may be slightly heavier, but the difference is minimal for most recipes. If precision is crucial, weigh it on a scale."
faqQ3: "How can I reduce the spiciness if 0.25 cup of hot sauce is too much?"
faqA3: "Dilute the hot sauce with a neutral liquid like vinegar, water, or citrus juice. Alternatively, mix it with honey or butter to balance the heat. Start with half the amount (1 oz) and adjust to taste."
faqQ4: "What’s the best way to measure 0.25 cup of hot sauce without a measuring cup?"
faqA4: "Use a tablespoon measure—0.25 cup equals 4 tablespoons (roughly 2 oz). For thicker sauces, level off each spoonful for accuracy. A standard UK shot glass (25ml) is also close to 0.25 cup if you’re in a pinch."

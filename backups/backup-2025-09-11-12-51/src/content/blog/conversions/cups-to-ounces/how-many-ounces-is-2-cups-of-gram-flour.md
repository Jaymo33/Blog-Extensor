<p>2 cups of gram flour equals approximately 7.05 ounces (200 grams). This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes, where precise measurements can make or break your dish. Whether you’re making crispy pakoras or gluten-free bread, knowing the exact weight ensures consistent results every time. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we focus on accuracy to help you master air frying with confidence.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air frying</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on even heat distribution, and incorrect ingredient quantities can lead to uneven cooking. Too much gram flour might make your batter dense, while too little can cause it to fall apart. For perfect results, always measure ingredients like gram flour by weight rather than volume. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> simplifies these calculations, so you never have to guess.</p>  

<p>Gram flour, also known as besan, is a staple in many air fryer recipes, from savoury snacks to gluten-free baking. Its nutty flavour and binding properties make it a versatile ingredient. If you’re exploring new dishes, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a> for inspiration. Whether you’re cooking vegetables or proteins, gram flour adds a delicious crunch.</p>  

<h3>How to measure gram flour correctly</h3>  
<p>For the most accurate results, use a digital kitchen scale to weigh your gram flour. If you don’t have one, fluff the flour with a spoon before lightly spooning it into a measuring cup. Avoid packing it down, as this can lead to over-measuring. A standard UK cup holds 100 grams of gram flour, so 2 cups equal 200 grams or 7.05 ounces.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for gram flour in air fryers</h2>  
<p>Gram flour is a key ingredient in many air-fried dishes, such as onion bhajis, crispy tofu, and gluten-free coatings. Its high protein content helps create a golden, crunchy texture without deep frying. For a quick snack, try our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable fritters</a>, which use gram flour for a light, crispy finish.</p>  

<p>Another popular use is in batters for air-fried chicken or fish. The flour’s natural binding properties help the coating stick, ensuring a crisp exterior.

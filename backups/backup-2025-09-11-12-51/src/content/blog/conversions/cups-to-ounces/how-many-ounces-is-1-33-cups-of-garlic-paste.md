faqQ1: "Can I use minced garlic instead of garlic paste in air fryer recipes?"
faqA1: "Yes, you can substitute minced garlic for garlic paste in air fryer recipes. Use about 1 teaspoon of minced garlic for every tablespoon of garlic paste called for in the recipe. Keep in mind the texture and intensity of flavour may vary slightly."
faqQ2: "How long does homemade garlic paste last in the fridge?"
faqA2: "Homemade garlic paste typically lasts 2-3 weeks when stored properly in an airtight container in the refrigerator. For best results, cover the surface with a thin layer of oil to help preserve it. Always check for signs of spoilage before use."
faqQ3: "Does garlic paste cook differently in an air fryer compared to fresh garlic?"
faqA3: "Garlic paste cooks faster in an air fryer than fresh garlic because it's already broken down. When using the equivalent of 1.33 cups (10.64 ounces), you may need to reduce cooking time slightly to prevent burning. Watch your dish carefully during the last few minutes of cooking."
faqQ4: "Can I freeze garlic paste for later use in air fryer recipes?"
faqA4: "Absolutely! Garlic paste freezes well for up to 3 months. Portion it into ice cube trays (about 1 tablespoon per cube) before freezing. When you need some for a recipe, just pop out a cube - no need to thaw if you're adding it to longer-cooking dishes."

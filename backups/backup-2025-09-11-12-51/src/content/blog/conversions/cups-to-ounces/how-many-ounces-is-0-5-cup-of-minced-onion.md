faqQ1: "Can I use dried minced onion instead of fresh for 0.5 cup measurements?"
faqA1: "Yes, you can substitute dried minced onion, but the conversion differs. For 0.5 cup (2 ounces) of fresh minced onion, use about 2 tablespoons of dried minced onion. Rehydrate it with water before adding to your air fryer recipe for the best texture."
faqQ2: "How do I store leftover minced onion after measuring 0.5 cup?"
faqA2: "Store leftover minced onion in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 5 days. For longer storage, freeze it in 0.5 cup (2-ounce) portions. This makes it easy to grab the right amount for future air fryer meals."
faqQ3: "Does the type of onion affect the weight of 0.5 cup minced onion?"
faqA3: "Slightly—red, white, and yellow onions have similar densities, so 0.5 cup will still weigh around 2 ounces. Sweet onions may be less dense, so pack them gently to ensure accuracy. Always mince uniformly for consistent results."
faqQ4: "Can I use a kitchen scale to measure 0.5 cup of minced onion?"
faqA4: "Absolutely! A kitchen scale is the most precise way to measure 0.5 cup of minced onion, as it directly shows 2 ounces. This eliminates packing inconsistencies and ensures perfect results every time in your air fryer."

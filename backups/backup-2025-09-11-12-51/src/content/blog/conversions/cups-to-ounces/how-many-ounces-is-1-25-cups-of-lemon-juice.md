faqQ1: "Does the type of lemon juice affect the ounce measurement?"
faqA1: "No, the type of lemon juice doesn't affect the fluid ounce measurement. Whether you're using fresh-squeezed or bottled lemon juice, 1.25 cups will always equal 10 fluid ounces. However, fresh juice may have a stronger flavour, so you might want to adjust quantities based on taste preferences."
faqQ2: "Can I use this conversion for other citrus juices?"
faqA2: "Yes, this conversion works for most citrus juices like lime, orange, or grapefruit. All these juices have similar densities, so 1.25 cups will equal approximately 10 fluid ounces. Just remember that different citrus juices have varying acidity levels, which may affect your recipe's flavour profile."
faqQ3: "How do I measure 1.25 cups of lemon juice without a measuring cup?"
faqA3: "If you don't have a measuring cup, you can use standard drinking glasses as a rough guide. One cup is about half a standard UK tumbler (250ml), so 1.25 cups would be just over half full. For more accuracy, use a kitchen scale – 10 fluid ounces of lemon juice weighs about 284 grams."
faqQ4: "Why do some recipes use weight instead of volume for lemon juice?"
faqA4: "Some recipes use weight (grams) instead of volume (ounces) for more precise measurements, especially in baking. Weight measurements account for variations in how ingredients settle in a cup. For lemon juice, 10 fluid ounces equals about 284 grams. Using weight can help ensure consistent results in delicate air fryer recipes."

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>
<p>Air fryers rely on precise cooking times and ingredient ratios to deliver perfect results. Too much or too little lemon juice can alter the texture and taste of your dish. For example, a marinade with 1.25 cups of lemon juice (10 ounces) will have a sharper tang compared to one with less. This is especially important for recipes like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer lemon chicken</a> or citrus-glazed salmon.</p>
<p>Using the correct amount of lemon juice also affects cooking times. Excess liquid can lead to steaming instead of crisping, while too little might dry out your food. Always measure carefully to avoid these pitfalls and achieve restaurant-quality results at home.</p>

faqQ1: "Can I use fresh corn instead of frozen corn in my air fryer?"
faqA1: "Yes, you can substitute fresh corn for frozen corn in air fryer recipes. Fresh corn may cook slightly faster, so reduce the time by 1–2 minutes. Just ensure it’s cut evenly for consistent results."
faqQ2: "How do I prevent frozen corn from becoming soggy in the air fryer?"
faqA2: "Pat the corn dry before cooking and avoid overcrowding the basket. A light coating of oil and a higher temperature (around 200°C) will help crisp it up. Shake the basket halfway through cooking for even browning."
faqQ3: "Is 1.5 cups of frozen corn enough for two servings?"
faqA3: "Yes, 1.5 cups (7.5 oz) of frozen corn is typically enough for two side portions. For heartier meals, pair it with proteins or grains. Adjust quantities based on your recipe and appetite."
faqQ4: "Do I need to thaw frozen corn before air frying?"
faqA4: "No, you can cook frozen corn directly in the air fryer. Thawing isn’t necessary, but shaking the basket ensures even cooking. Add a minute or two to the cooking time if needed."

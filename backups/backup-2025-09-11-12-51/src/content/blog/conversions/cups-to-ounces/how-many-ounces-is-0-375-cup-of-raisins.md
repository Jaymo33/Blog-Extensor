faqQ1: "Can I use grams instead of ounces for measuring raisins?"
faqA1: "Absolutely! If you prefer metric measurements, 0.375 cup of raisins is roughly 42.5 grams. Many kitchen scales allow you to toggle between ounces and grams, making it easy to measure ingredients for your air fryer recipes."
faqQ2: "Do raisins weigh the same when soaked?"
faqA2: "No, soaked raisins absorb water and become heavier. If your recipe calls for soaked raisins, measure them after draining to ensure accuracy. For 0.375 cup of soaked raisins, you might need to adjust other liquid ingredients slightly."
faqQ3: "How many raisins are in 0.375 cup?"
faqA3: "This varies by raisin size, but on average, 0.375 cup holds about 75-90 standard raisins. For precise baking, weighing (1.5 oz) is more reliable than counting, especially in air fryer recipes where consistency matters."
faqQ4: "Can I substitute other dried fruits for raisins in air fryer recipes?"
faqA4: "Yes, dried cranberries or chopped apricots can work, but adjust quantities as their density differs. For 0.375 cup of alternative dried fruits, check weight equivalents to maintain your recipe's balance. Always consider flavour compatibility too."

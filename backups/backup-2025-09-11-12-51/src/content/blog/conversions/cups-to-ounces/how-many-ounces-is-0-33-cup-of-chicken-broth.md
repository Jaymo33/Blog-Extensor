faqQ1: "Can I use stock instead of broth for the 0.33 cup measurement?"

faqQ2: "How do I measure 0.33 cup of chicken broth without a measuring cup?"
faqA2: "Without a measuring cup, use a kitchen scale to weigh out 2.64 ounces of chicken broth. Alternatively, estimate by filling a standard cup about one-third full. For precision, we recommend proper measuring tools."
faqQ3: "Does the type of chicken broth affect the ounce measurement?"
faqA3: "No, whether it’s homemade, canned, or bouillon-based, 0.33 cup of any chicken broth equals 2.64 ounces. However, sodium content and flavour intensity may vary between types."
faqQ4: "Can I freeze leftover chicken broth after measuring 0.33 cup?"
faqA4: "Absolutely! Freeze unused chicken broth in ice cube trays for future use. Each cube is about 1 ounce, making it easy to measure small amounts like 0.33 cup (2-3 cubes) later."

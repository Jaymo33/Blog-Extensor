faqQ1: "How do I convert 3 cups of ground cinnamon to ounces without a scale?"
faqA1: "You can use a standard conversion ratio: 1 cup of ground cinnamon is roughly 4.5 ounces, so 3 cups equal about 13.5 ounces. For accuracy, fluff the cinnamon lightly before measuring and level off the cup with a knife."
faqQ2: "Can I use this conversion for other ground spices in my air fryer recipes?"
faqA2: "Yes, but the weight may vary depending on the spice. For example, ground nutmeg is denser than cinnamon, so 3 cups would weigh more. Always check a conversion chart or use a scale for precise measurements."
faqQ3: "Why does my air fryer recipe call for ounces instead of cups?"
faqA3: "Weight measurements (ounces) are more accurate than volume (cups) because ingredients can settle or fluff differently. This precision is especially important in air fryer cooking, where even heat distribution relies on consistent ingredient amounts."
faqQ4: "How long will 3 cups of ground cinnamon stay fresh?"
faqA4: "Properly stored in an airtight container, ground cinnamon can stay fresh for up to a year. After that, it may lose potency, affecting the flavour of your air fryer dishes. Always check for a strong aroma before use."

faqQ1: "Is 0.75 cup of semi skimmed milk the same as 6 fluid ounces?"
faqA1: "Yes, 0.75 cup of semi skimmed milk equals exactly 6 fluid ounces. This measurement remains consistent because milk has a standard density. Whether you're using UK or US measuring cups, the volume-to-weight conversion stays the same for liquid milk measurements."
faqQ2: "Can I use this conversion for other types of milk?"
faqA2: "Absolutely. While we're specifically discussing semi skimmed milk here, this 0.75 cup to 6 ounces conversion works for all milk types including whole, skimmed, and plant-based alternatives. The slight density variations between milk types are negligible for most cooking purposes, especially in air fryer recipes."
faqQ3: "How do I measure 0.75 cup without a measuring cup?"
faqA3: "If you don't have measuring cups, you can use common household items. A standard teacup in the UK typically holds about 6 ounces (0.75 cup), making it perfect for measuring semi skimmed milk. Alternatively, use a kitchen scale - pour milk until it reaches 6 ounces (170 grams) for perfect accuracy in your air fryer recipes."
faqQ4: "Why do some air fryer recipes use ounces instead of cups?"
faqA4: "Many professional recipes use weight measurements (ounces) because they're more precise than volume measurements (cups). When baking in air fryers, where cooking conditions are intense and fast, exact measurements like 6 ounces instead of 0.75 cup can make the difference between success and failure, especially for delicate items like cakes or souffl√©s."

<h2>Using semi skimmed milk in air fryer recipes</h2>
<p>Semi skimmed milk's balanced fat content (around 1.7%) makes it ideal for air fryer cooking. It provides enough richness for creamy textures without excessive browning. When using 0.75 cup (6 ounces) in recipes like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>air fryer desserts</a>, it helps create tender crumb structures while allowing proper crisping on the outside.</p>

Knowing this equals 6 ounces helps when scaling recipes or substituting ingredients.</p>

<h3>Tips for measuring sticky ingredients</h3>
<p>While semi skimmed milk pours easily, some air fryer recipe ingredients can be trickier to measure. For sticky items like honey or syrup, lightly coat your measuring cup with oil first. This ensures the full 0.75 cup (6 ounces for milk) slides out cleanly.

faqQ1: "Can I use bottled apple juice instead of fresh for air fryer recipes?"
faqA1: "Yes, bottled apple juice works fine in air fryer recipes, but opt for unsweetened varieties to control sugar levels. Fresh juice may offer a brighter flavour, but bottled is convenient and still delivers great results when measuring 1.33 cups (10.64 oz)."
faqQ2: "Does apple juice affect cooking times in the air fryer?"
faqA2: "Apple juice can slightly extend cooking times if used in large quantities (like 1.33 cups/10.64 oz) due to its moisture content. For glazes or marinades, pat meats dry before air frying to ensure crispiness. Monitor dishes closely and adjust times as needed."
faqQ3: "How do I convert 1.33 cups of apple juice to millilitres?"
faqA3: "1.33 cups of apple juice equals roughly 315 millilitres (ml). This conversion is handy for UK cooks using metric measurements. Remember, precision matters in air fryer recipes, so use a measuring jug for accuracy."
faqQ4: "Can I substitute apple sauce for apple juice in air fryer recipes?"
faqA4: "Yes, but adjust quantities—apple sauce is thicker. For 1.33 cups (10.64 oz) of juice, use about 3/4 cup sauce thinned with water. This swap works well in marinades or baked goods, but texture may vary slightly."

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on even heat distribution, so ingredient ratios must be spot-on. Too much liquid, like apple juice, can lead to soggy results, while too little might dry out your dish. Recipes on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> often call for precise amounts to ensure crispy, flavourful outcomes. Measuring 1.33 cups of apple juice correctly (10.64 oz) helps maintain balance, especially in marinades or glazes for meats like chicken or turkey.</p>  

<p>If you're working with frozen foods or meal prep, converting cups to ounces avoids guesswork. For example, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> section includes dishes where apple juice adds sweetness without excess moisture. Always use a kitchen scale for the most accurate results, especially when scaling recipes up or down.</p>  

<h3>How to measure 1.33 cups of apple juice without a scale</h3>

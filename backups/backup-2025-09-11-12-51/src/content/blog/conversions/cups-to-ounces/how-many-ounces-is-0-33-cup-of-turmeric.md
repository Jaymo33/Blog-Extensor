faqQ1: "Can I use fresh turmeric instead of ground for 0.33 cup measurements?"
faqA1: "Fresh turmeric and ground turmeric have different densities, so 0.33 cup of fresh turmeric won’t equal 1.6 ounces. For fresh turmeric, you’d need about 2-3 medium-sized roots, grated, to match the flavour intensity. Adjust to taste, as fresh turmeric is milder but more vibrant."
faqQ2: "How does turmeric affect cooking times in an air fryer?"
faqA2: "Turmeric doesn’t significantly change cooking times, but it can enhance browning due to its natural sugars. When using 0.33 cup (1.6 oz) in a marinade, ensure meats or vegetables are evenly coated for consistent results. Always follow your air fryer’s recommended cooking times for the main ingredient."
faqQ3: "Is 0.33 cup of turmeric too much for one recipe?"
faqA3: "0.33 cup (1.6 oz) of turmeric is quite a large amount for most home recipes. It’s typically used in smaller quantities—1-2 teaspoons per dish. If your recipe calls for this much, double-check the measurements or consider dividing the batch."
faqQ4: "Can I substitute curry powder for turmeric in air fryer recipes?"
faqA4: "Curry powder contains turmeric but also other spices, so the flavour profile will differ. If substituting, start with half the amount (0.165 cup or 0.8 oz) and adjust to taste. For authentic turmeric flavour, stick to the pure spice."

faqQ1: "Can I use single cream instead of double cream in air fryer recipes?"
faqA1: "Yes, but single cream has a lower fat content (around 18%) compared to double cream (48%). This may affect the richness and texture of your dish. For sauces or baked goods, you might need to adjust other ingredients to compensate."
faqQ2: "How do I store leftover double cream after measuring?"
faqA2: "Store leftover double cream in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 3 days. Shake or stir it before using, as it may separate. For longer storage, you can freeze it, though the texture may change slightly when thawed."
faqQ3: "Why does my double cream measurement vary slightly each time?"
faqA3: "Small variations can occur due to factors like temperature or how the cream is poured. For absolute precision, always use a kitchen scale. Air fryer recipes often rely on consistency, so weighing is the best method."
faqQ4: "Can I substitute whipped cream for double cream in air fryer recipes?"
faqA4: "Whipped cream is lighter and contains added air, so it’s not a direct substitute. For cooking or baking, stick to double cream unless the recipe specifies otherwise. Whipped cream is better suited for toppings or cold desserts."

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter</h2>  
<p>Accurate measurements are crucial for achieving the perfect texture and flavour in your dishes. Double cream, with its high fat content, can significantly alter the outcome if not measured correctly. Too much can make a dish overly rich, while too little might leave it lacking. This is especially important in air fryer recipes, where precise ratios ensure even cooking.

<p>Measuring by weight (ounces) is often more reliable than volume (cups) because it accounts for variations in density. Double cream can vary slightly in thickness, so weighing it removes any guesswork. This is why many professional bakers prefer using scales. If you're serious about air fryer cooking, investing in a good kitchen scale is a game-changer.</p>  

<h3>How to measure double cream correctly</h3>  
<p>To measure 1 cup of double cream accurately, use a liquid measuring cup for volume or a kitchen scale for weight. If using a scale, set it to ounces and pour the cream until it reaches 8.45 oz. For sticky or thick creams, gently spoon it into the measuring cup to avoid air pockets. Level it off with a straight edge for precision.

<h2>Common uses for double cream in air fryer recipes</h2>  
<p>Double cream is a versatile ingredient that adds richness to both sweet and savoury dishes. In air fryer cooking, it’s often used in sauces, custards, or as a topping for desserts.

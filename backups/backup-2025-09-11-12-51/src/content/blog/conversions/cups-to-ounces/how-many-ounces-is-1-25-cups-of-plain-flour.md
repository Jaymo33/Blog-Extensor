faqQ1: "Can I use self-raising flour instead of plain flour for 1.25 cups?"
faqA1: "Yes, but note that self-raising flour weighs slightly less due to added raising agents. For 1.25 cups, you’d need about 5 ounces (140 grams) instead of 5.3 ounces. Adjustments may be needed for recipes requiring precise leavening."
faqQ2: "How do I measure 1.25 cups of flour without a measuring cup?"
faqA2: "Use a standard mug (about 240ml) and fill it just over halfway for 1.25 cups. Alternatively, a kitchen scale is more accurate—aim for 5.3 ounces. Fluff the flour first to avoid packing it down."
faqQ3: "Why does my air fryer baking turn out dry or dense?"
faqA3: "Over-measuring flour is a common culprit. Ensure you’re using 5.3 ounces (1.25 cups) of plain flour, not more. Also, check your air fryer’s temperature and timing, as overcooking can dry out baked goods."
faqQ4: "Is 1.25 cups of plain flour the same in grams and ounces?"
faqA4: "No, 1.25 cups of plain flour is approximately 5.3 ounces or 150 grams. Weight varies by ingredient, so always use a scale for baking. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a> can help."

<h2>Why Accurate Flour Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Using the correct amount of flour is crucial for air fryer recipes. Too much flour can make baked goods dense, while too little may cause them to crumble. Since air fryers cook faster than conventional ovens, precision is key. For example, if you’re making air fryer cookies, 1.25 cups of plain flour (5.3 ounces) ensures the perfect texture. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more handy tips.</p>  

<p>Measuring by weight (ounces or grams) is more reliable than volume (cups) because flour can settle or become compacted. A kitchen scale is your best friend here. If you don’t have one, fluff the flour with a spoon before lightly spooning it into the measuring cup. Avoid tapping or packing it down, as this can lead to over-measuring.</p>  

<h2>How to Convert 1.25 Cups of Plain Flour to Ounces</h2>  
<p>Converting cups to ounces for plain flour is straightforward once you know the standard weight. One cup of plain flour typically weighs around 4.25 ounces (120 grams). Therefore, 1.25 cups of plain flour equals roughly 5.3 ounces (150 grams). This conversion works for most UK recipes, including those on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>our recipe hub</a>.</p>  

<h3>Using a Kitchen Scale for Precision</h3>  
<p>For the most accurate results, use a digital kitchen scale. Place your mixing bowl on the scale, tare it to zero, then add flour until you reach 5.3 ounces. This method eliminates guesswork and ensures your air fryer creations turn out perfectly every time. If you’re baking cakes or bread, precision is especially important for the right rise and texture.</p>  

<h2>Common Air Fryer Recipes Using 1.25 Cups of Flour</h2>

<h3>Adjusting Recipes for Different Flours</h3>

Always check the packaging or use a scale to confirm.

faqQ1: "Can I use margarine instead of butter for 0.5 cup measurements?"
faqA1: "Yes, you can substitute margarine for butter in a 1:1 ratio. However, margarine may have a higher water content, which can slightly affect the texture of baked goods. For air fryer recipes, this substitution usually works well, but keep an eye on cooking times."
faqQ2: "How many grams is 0.5 cup of butter?"
faqA2: "0.5 cup of butter is equivalent to 113 grams. This conversion is useful if you're using a kitchen scale or following a recipe with metric measurements. For air fryer cooking, grams provide even greater precision than ounces."
faqQ3: "Does the type of butter affect the conversion?"
faqA3: "The type of butter (salted, unsalted, or cultured) doesn’t change the weight conversion. 0.5 cup of any butter will still be 4 ounces (113 grams). However, the flavour and salt content may vary, so adjust seasonings accordingly in your air fryer recipes."
faqQ4: "Why is measuring butter by weight better than volume?"
faqA4: "Measuring butter by weight (ounces or grams) is more accurate than volume (cups) because butter can be packed differently. Weight ensures consistency, especially in air fryer recipes where precise measurements lead to better texture and cooking results. A kitchen scale is the best tool for this."

<h2>Tips for measuring butter without a scale</h2>  
<p>If you don’t have a kitchen scale, you can still measure 0.5 cup of butter using the markings on the butter wrapper.

<p>Another handy trick is to use water displacement for measuring butter. Fill a measuring cup with 0.5 cup of water, then add butter until the water level rises to 1 cup. The butter you’ve added will equal 0.5 cup (4 ounces). This method is great for air fryer recipes where precision matters, like our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cookies>air fryer cookie recipes</a>.</p>

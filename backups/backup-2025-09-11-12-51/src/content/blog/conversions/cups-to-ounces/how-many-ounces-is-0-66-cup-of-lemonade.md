faqQ1: "Can I use bottled lemonade instead of fresh for 0.66 cup measurements?"
faqA1: "Yes, bottled lemonade works fine, but check for added sugars or preservatives that might alter the flavour. For air fryer recipes, 0.66 cup (5.28 oz) of bottled lemonade will measure the same, though fresh-squeezed offers a brighter taste."
faqQ2: "How does 0.66 cup of lemonade affect cooking times in an air fryer?"
faqA2: "Since 0.66 cup (5.28 oz) is a moderate amount, it won’t drastically change cooking times. However, recipes with more liquid may need an extra minute or two to evaporate excess moisture. Always check for doneness visually."
faqQ3: "Is 0.66 cup of lemonade the same as 0.66 cup of water in weight?"
faqA3: "No, lemonade is slightly denser due to sugar content, but the difference is minimal. For practical purposes, 0.66 cup (5.28 oz) of lemonade can be treated similarly to water in most air fryer recipes."
faqQ4: "What’s the best way to store leftover lemonade after measuring 0.66 cup?"
faqA4: "Refrigerate leftover lemonade in a sealed container for up to a week. If you’ve used it in a marinade, discard any leftovers that have touched raw meat to avoid contamination."

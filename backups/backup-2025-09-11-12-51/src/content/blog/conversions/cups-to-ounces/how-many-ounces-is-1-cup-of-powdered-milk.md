faqQ1: "Is 1 cup of powdered milk the same weight as liquid milk?"
faqA1: "No, 1 cup of powdered milk weighs about 4.4 ounces, while 1 cup of liquid milk weighs approximately 8.6 ounces. Powdered milk is much lighter because the water has been removed. When reconstituting powdered milk, you'll need to add water to match the consistency of fresh milk."
faqQ2: "Can I use a regular cup to measure powdered milk for air fryer recipes?"
faqA2: "While you can use a standard measuring cup, for the most accurate results with air fryer recipes, it's best to use a kitchen scale. Powdered milk can settle or become compacted, affecting the weight. If using cups, fluff the powder first and level it off carefully."
faqQ3: "How should I store powdered milk for air fryer cooking?"
faqA3: "Keep powdered milk in an airtight container in a cool, dry place away from sunlight. Proper storage maintains its quality for air fryer recipes. Once opened, use within 6 months for best results, checking for any changes in smell or texture before use."
faqQ4: "Can I substitute powdered milk for fresh milk in all air fryer recipes?"
faqA4: "Powdered milk works well in most air fryer recipes, especially for breadings, coatings, and baked goods. However, for recipes where fresh milk's texture is crucial (like some sauces), reconstituted powdered milk might not provide identical results. Always follow the recipe's specific recommendations."

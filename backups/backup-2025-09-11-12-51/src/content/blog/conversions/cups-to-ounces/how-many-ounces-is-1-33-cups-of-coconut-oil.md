faqQ1: "Can I use liquid coconut oil instead of solid for measuring 1.33 cups?"
faqA1: "Yes, liquid coconut oil works, but measure it in a liquid measuring cup for accuracy. The weight (10.64 oz) remains the same, but the volume may appear different due to density changes when melted."
faqQ2: "Why is weighing coconut oil better than using cup measurements?"
faqA2: "Weighing eliminates inconsistencies caused by how tightly packed the oil is in the cup. Solid coconut oil can vary in density, so ounces (or grams) provide a more precise measurement for air fryer recipes."
faqQ3: "How do I store leftover coconut oil after measuring 1.33 cups?"
faqA3: "Keep it in an airtight container at room temperature (if solid) or refrigerate if you prefer a firmer texture. Avoid moisture or contaminants to maintain freshness."
faqQ4: "Can I substitute butter for coconut oil in a 1.33-cup measurement?"
faqA4: "Yes, but butter contains water, which may affect texture. Use a 1:1 ratio by weight (10.64 oz) for best results, and adjust cooking times slightly as needed."

faqQ1: "Can I use double cream instead of whipping cream for 0.125 cup measurements?"
faqA1: "Yes, you can substitute double cream, but it’s thicker and richer. Use the same 0.125 cup (1 oz) measurement, but expect a heavier texture in your dish. Adjust other liquids if needed for balance."
faqQ2: "How do I measure 0.125 cup of whipping cream without a measuring cup?"
faqA2: "Two tablespoons equal 0.125 cup (1 oz). Alternatively, use a kitchen scale set to ounces for precision. A standard shot glass also holds roughly 1 oz, making it a handy makeshift measure."
faqQ3: "Does 0.125 cup of whipping cream weigh the same when whipped?"
faqA3: "No, whipped cream expands in volume but not weight. 0.125 cup (1 oz) of liquid whipping cream will yield about 0.25 cup whipped, but the weight remains 1 oz."
faqQ4: "Can I freeze leftover whipping cream after measuring 0.125 cup?"
faqA4: "Yes, freeze it in an airtight container for up to 2 months. Thaw in the fridge and shake well before use. Note: it may separate slightly, but it’s still fine for cooking."

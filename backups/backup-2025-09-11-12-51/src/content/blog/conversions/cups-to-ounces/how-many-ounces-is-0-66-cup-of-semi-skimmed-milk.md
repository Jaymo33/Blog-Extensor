faqQ1: "Can I use a different type of milk if I don’t have semi skimmed?"
faqA1: "Yes, you can substitute whole milk, skim milk, or plant-based alternatives like almond or oat milk. Just note that the density may vary slightly, so adjust measurements if precision is crucial for your recipe. For example, whole milk is slightly heavier per cup than semi skimmed."
faqQ2: "Why is measuring by weight more accurate than volume for milk?"
faqA2: "Weight measurements account for variations in density and air bubbles, which volume measurements can’t. A cup of semi skimmed milk will always weigh 8 ounces, but its volume can appear different depending on how it’s poured. This is especially important in baking, where consistency is key."
faqQ3: "How do I measure 0.66 cup without a measuring cup?"
faqA3: "If you don’t have a measuring cup, use a kitchen scale to weigh out 5.28 ounces of semi skimmed milk. Alternatively, 0.66 cup equals about 10.5 tablespoons, which you can measure with a standard tablespoon. For smaller quantities, a teaspoon measure can help you get closer to the exact amount."
faqQ4: "Does the temperature of the milk affect the measurement?"
faqA4: "Yes, colder milk is slightly denser than room-temperature milk, but the difference is minimal for most recipes. If you’re measuring by volume, stick to one temperature for consistency. For precise baking, always use weight measurements to avoid any discrepancies."

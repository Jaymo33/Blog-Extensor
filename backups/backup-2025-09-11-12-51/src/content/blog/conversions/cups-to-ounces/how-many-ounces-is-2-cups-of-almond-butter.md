faqQ1: "Does almond butter weigh the same as peanut butter per cup?"
faqA1: "Almond butter and peanut butter have similar densities, but almond butter is slightly heavier. While 2 cups of peanut butter equals about 16 ounces, almond butter may weigh 16-17 ounces for the same volume due to its finer texture. Always check your specific brand's nutrition label for precise measurements."
faqQ2: "Can I use almond butter instead of oil in air fryer recipes?"
faqA2: "Yes, almond butter can replace oil in many air fryer recipes. Use 3/4 the amount of almond butter (by weight) for the oil called for in the recipe. For example, if a recipe needs 4 ounces of oil, use 3 ounces of almond butter instead. This substitution adds protein and flavour while reducing saturated fats."
faqQ3: "Why does my almond butter measurement seem inconsistent?"
faqA3: "Almond butter measurements can vary due to temperature, brand, and whether it's stirred. Cold almond butter is denser, while room temperature spreads more easily. Natural almond butter with oil separation will measure differently than homogenised versions. For accuracy, weigh your 2 cups of almond butter rather than relying solely on volume measurements."
faqQ4: "How long does 2 cups of almond butter last once opened?"
faqA4: "An opened container of almond butter stays fresh for 2-3 months at room temperature or up to 6 months refrigerated. Store your 16-ounce portion in an airtight container, stirring occasionally to redistribute oils. If you notice any off smells or flavours, it's best to discard it and use fresh almond butter for your air fryer recipes."

If you've measured out 2 cups for future air fryer use, consider portioning it into smaller containers. Always stir well before measuring, as natural almond butter tends to separate over time.</p>  

<p>For longer storage, you can refrigerate almond butter, though this makes it harder to measure.

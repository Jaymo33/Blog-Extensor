faqQ1: "Can I use single cream instead of double cream in air fryer recipes?"
faqA1: "Yes, but single cream has a lower fat content (around 18%), so it may not thicken the same way. If substituting, adjust cooking times slightly, as single cream heats faster. For best results, stick to double cream in recipes where richness matters."
faqQ2: "How do I store leftover double cream after measuring 0.125 cup?"
faqA2: "Store leftover double cream in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 3 days. Shake or stir before using, as it can separate. For longer storage, freeze it in small portions, though texture may change slightly when thawed."
faqQ3: "Why is measuring by weight better than volume for double cream?"
faqA3: "Weight (ounces) is more accurate because double cream’s thickness means volume measurements can vary. A kitchen scale eliminates guesswork, ensuring consistent results in air fryer recipes where precision is key."
faqQ4: "Can I whip 0.125 cup (1 ounce) of double cream?"
faqA4: "Yes, but it’s a small amount, so use a small bowl and whisk vigorously. For best results, chill the cream and utensils first. It will whip faster than larger quantities, so watch closely to avoid over-whipping."

If you're unsure, a kitchen scale is the best tool for precise measurements.</p>

faqQ1: "Can I use white sugar instead of brown sugar for 0.25 cup measurements?"
faqA1: "Yes, but the results will differ. White sugar is denser, so 0.25 cup equals about 1.75 ounces. Brown sugar adds moisture and a caramel flavour, which is ideal for chewy textures in air fryer baking."
faqQ2: "Why does my air fryer recipe taste too sweet with 0.25 cup of brown sugar?"
faqA2: "Air fryers intensify flavours due to concentrated heat. If your dish is overly sweet, reduce the sugar by half an ounce (about 1 tablespoon) or balance it with a pinch of salt or citrus zest."
faqQ3: "How do I store leftover brown sugar after measuring 0.25 cup?"
faqA3: "Keep it in an airtight container with a terra cotta disc or marshmallow to prevent hardening. Stored properly, brown sugar lasts up to 6 months, ready for your next air fryer recipe."
faqQ4: "Is 0.25 cup of brown sugar the same for light and dark varieties?"
faqA4: "Yes, both types weigh roughly 2 ounces per 0.25 cup. Dark brown sugar has more molasses, adding deeper flavour, while light brown sugar offers a milder taste—ideal for delicate air fryer desserts."

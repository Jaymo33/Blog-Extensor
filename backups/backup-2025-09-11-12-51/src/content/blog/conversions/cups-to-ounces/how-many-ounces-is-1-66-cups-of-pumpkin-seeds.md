faqQ1: "How do I convert 1.66 cups of pumpkin seeds to ounces without a scale?"
faqA1: "If you don’t have a kitchen scale, lightly pack the pumpkin seeds into a measuring cup to reach 1.66 cups, which equals roughly 8.5 ounces. Avoid pressing down, as this can compress the seeds and skew the measurement."
faqQ2: "Can I use this conversion for other types of seeds in the air fryer?"
faqA2: "Yes, but different seeds have varying densities. Sunflower seeds, for example, weigh slightly less per cup. Always check a conversion chart or weigh them for accuracy when trying new recipes."
faqQ3: "Why is weighing pumpkin seeds better than measuring by volume?"
faqA3: "Weight (ounces) is more precise because cup measurements can vary based on how tightly seeds are packed. For consistent air fryer results, especially with roasting, weight ensures even cooking and flavour distribution."
faqQ4: "How long should I air fry 1.66 cups (8.5 oz) of pumpkin seeds?"
faqA4: "Roast them at 160°C for 10–12 minutes, shaking the basket halfway. Larger batches may need extra time, but avoid overcrowding to ensure crispiness. Check them frequently to prevent burning."

Too few might burn quickly. Measuring by weight (ounces) is more reliable than volume (cups) for dense ingredients like seeds.

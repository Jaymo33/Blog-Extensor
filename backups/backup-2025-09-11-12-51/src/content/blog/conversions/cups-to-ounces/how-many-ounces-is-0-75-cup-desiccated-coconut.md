faqQ1: "Can I use shredded coconut instead of desiccated coconut for 0.75 cup?"
faqA1: "Yes, but shredded coconut is less dense, so you’ll need slightly more by volume. For 0.75 cup desiccated coconut (2.25 oz), use about 1 cup shredded coconut to match the weight. Adjust based on your recipe’s texture needs."
faqQ2: "How do I store desiccated coconut after measuring 0.75 cup?"
faqA2: "Store unused desiccated coconut in an airtight container in a cool, dry place. It lasts up to 6 months this way. For longer storage, freeze it in a sealed bag, where it can keep for up to a year."
faqQ3: "Why does 0.75 cup of desiccated coconut weigh 2.25 ounces?"
faqA3: "Desiccated coconut is finely grated and dried, making it lighter than other forms. The 0.75 cup to 2.25 oz conversion accounts for its airy texture. Always weigh it for baking accuracy."
faqQ4: "Can I substitute coconut flour for 0.75 cup desiccated coconut?"
faqA4: "No, coconut flour is much denser and absorbs more liquid. If a recipe calls for 0.75 cup desiccated coconut (2.25 oz), substituting flour will alter the texture and require recipe adjustments."

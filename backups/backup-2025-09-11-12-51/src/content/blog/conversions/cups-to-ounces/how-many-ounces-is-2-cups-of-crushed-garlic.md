faqQ1: "Can I use minced garlic instead of crushed garlic for the same weight?"
faqA1: "Yes, minced garlic can be used as a substitute for crushed garlic, but keep in mind that minced garlic is often denser. If your recipe calls for 2 cups of crushed garlic (16 ounces), you may need slightly less minced garlic by volume. Always check the consistency and adjust as needed."
faqQ2: "Does the type of garlic affect the weight measurement?"
faqA2: "Freshly crushed garlic and pre-packaged crushed garlic may have slight weight differences due to moisture content. However, the variance is minimal, and 2 cups will still roughly equal 16 ounces. For the most accurate results, use freshly crushed garlic when possible."
faqQ3: "How do I convert 2 cups of crushed garlic to grams?"
faqA3: "Since 16 ounces is equivalent to approximately 454 grams, 2 cups of crushed garlic would weigh around 454 grams. This conversion is handy for recipes using metric measurements, especially in baking or precise marinades."
faqQ4: "Can I reduce the amount of garlic in my air fryer recipe without affecting the dish?"
faqA4: "Yes, you can adjust the garlic to suit your taste, but keep in mind that garlic contributes both flavour and moisture. Reducing it significantly may alter the dish’s texture and taste. Start with small adjustments and taste as you go for the best results."

<h3>How to measure crushed garlic correctly</h3>  
<p>For the most accurate measurement, lightly pack the crushed garlic into your measuring cup without pressing too hard. Over-packing can lead to more garlic than needed, altering the taste of your dish. If you’re using pre-minced garlic from a jar, note that it may have a slightly different weight due to added moisture.</p>

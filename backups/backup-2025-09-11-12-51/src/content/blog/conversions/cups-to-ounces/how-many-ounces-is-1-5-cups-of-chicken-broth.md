faqQ1: "Can I use stock instead of broth for the same measurement?"
faqA1: "Yes, chicken stock and broth are interchangeable in most recipes, including air fryer dishes. Both measure the same by volume (1.5 cups = 12 oz), though stock may have a richer flavour due to longer simmering times."
faqQ2: "How do I measure 1.5 cups of chicken broth without a measuring cup?"
faqA2: "If you don’t have a measuring cup, use a standard UK mug (approx 10 oz) and fill it 1.2 times for 12 oz. Alternatively, weigh 340 grams on a kitchen scale. For smaller amounts, tablespoons (16 tbsp = 1 cup) can help."
faqQ3: "Does the type of chicken broth affect the ounce measurement?"
faqA3: "No, whether it’s homemade, canned, or powdered broth reconstituted with water, 1.5 cups will always equal 12 fluid ounces. However, low-sodium or concentrated broths may alter flavour, so adjust seasonings accordingly."
faqQ4: "Why is my air fryer recipe too watery with 1.5 cups of broth?"
faqA4: "Air fryers need less liquid than traditional methods. Try reducing the broth by 25% (9 oz instead of 12 oz) or patting proteins dry before cooking. For saucy dishes, add broth gradually to avoid excess moisture."

<p>1.5 cups of chicken broth equals 12 fluid ounces (or approximately 340 grams by weight). This conversion is essential for precise cooking, especially when using an air fryer where measurements can impact texture and flavour.

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of liquid, like chicken broth, is crucial in air fryer recipes. Too much can make food soggy, while too little may dry it out.

Always measure liquids carefully to avoid inconsistencies.</p>  

<p>Air fryers circulate hot air rapidly, so liquids evaporate faster than in conventional ovens.

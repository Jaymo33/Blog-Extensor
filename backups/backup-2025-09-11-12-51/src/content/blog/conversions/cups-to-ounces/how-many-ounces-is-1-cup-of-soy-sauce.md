faqQ1: "Is 1 cup of soy sauce the same as 8 fluid ounces?"
faqA1: "No, 1 cup of soy sauce equals approximately 8.45 ounces by weight, not fluid ounces. Fluid ounces measure volume, while weight ounces account for density. For precise air fryer cooking, always weigh soy sauce if the recipe specifies ounces."
faqQ2: "Can I use a kitchen scale to measure soy sauce instead of cups?"
faqA2: "Absolutely! A kitchen scale is the most accurate way to measure soy sauce, especially for air fryer recipes. Simply set your scale to ounces and pour until you reach 8.45 ounces for 1 cup. This method eliminates guesswork and ensures perfect results."
faqQ3: "Does the type of soy sauce affect the weight per cup?"
faqA3: "While most soy sauces weigh around 8.45 ounces per cup, thicker varieties like tamari may be slightly denser. Low-sodium soy sauce typically has a similar weight. For best results, check the label or use a scale if precision is crucial."
faqQ4: "How do I adjust soy sauce measurements for a smaller air fryer batch?"
faqA4: "To scale down a recipe, divide the soy sauce proportionally. For example, if a recipe calls for 1 cup (8.45 ounces) but you’re making half, use 4.225 ounces. A kitchen scale makes this easy and ensures your dish isn’t overly salty or bland."

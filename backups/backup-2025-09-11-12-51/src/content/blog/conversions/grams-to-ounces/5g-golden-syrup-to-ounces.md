faqQ1: "Can I use honey instead of golden syrup in my air fryer recipes?"
faqA1: "Yes, honey can be substituted for golden syrup in most recipes, but the flavour will be slightly different. Honey is sweeter and has a distinct taste, while golden syrup has a milder, caramel-like flavour. Use the same weight (5g of honey equals 0.18 ounces) for a direct swap."
faqQ2: "How do I convert larger amounts of golden syrup from grams to ounces?"
faqA2: "To convert larger amounts, multiply the grams by 0.035 to get ounces. For example, 100g of golden syrup equals 3.5 ounces. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a> has a full list of common measurements to make scaling recipes easy."
faqQ3: "Why is my golden syrup measurement not accurate?"
faqA3: "Golden syrup’s sticky texture can make it hard to measure precisely. Ensure your spoon or scale is lightly greased to help the syrup slide off. Also, check that your scales are calibrated correctly for the most accurate results."
faqQ4: "Can I freeze golden syrup for later use?"
faqA4: "Freezing golden syrup isn’t recommended, as it can crystallise and lose its smooth texture. Instead, store it in a cool, dry place with the lid tightly sealed. It has a long shelf life, so freezing isn’t necessary."

<p>5 grams of golden syrup equals approximately 0.18 ounces. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements can make all the difference. Whether you’re whipping up a dessert or glazing a dish, knowing how to convert grams to ounces ensures perfect results every time.

<h2>Why accurate conversions matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Golden syrup is a staple in many British recipes, from sticky puddings to glazes for meats. When using an air fryer, precise measurements ensure even cooking and perfect texture. Too much syrup can make dishes overly sweet or sticky, while too little might leave them lacking flavour. Converting 5g of golden syrup to ounces (0.18 oz) helps you follow recipes accurately, whether you’re baking or cooking savoury dishes.</p>

<h2>How to measure 5g of golden syrup without scales</h2>  
<p>Not everyone has a kitchen scale, but you can still measure 5g of golden syrup accurately. A teaspoon holds roughly 7g of golden syrup, so slightly less than a level teaspoon will give you about 5g. Alternatively, a metric measuring spoon set often includes a 5g spoon, which is perfect for this measurement. Remember, golden syrup is sticky, so lightly greasing your spoon can help it slide off easily.</p>  

<h3>Using volume measurements for golden syrup</h3>  
<p>If you prefer volume measurements, 5g of golden syrup is roughly 1.2 teaspoons. This is useful if your recipe calls for volume rather than weight. However, weight measurements are more accurate, especially for sticky ingredients like golden syrup.

<h2>Common uses for 5g of golden syrup in air fryer recipes</h2>  
<p>Golden syrup adds a rich, caramel-like sweetness to both sweet and savoury dishes. In your air fryer, 5g of golden syrup can be used to glaze roasted vegetables, add shine to pastries, or sweeten marinades. It’s also a key ingredient in many British desserts, like treacle tart or flapjacks. Measuring 5g accurately ensures your dishes have the perfect balance of sweetness.</p>  

<p>For a quick and easy air fryer dessert, try brushing 5g of golden syrup over sliced apples before air frying. The syrup caramelises beautifully, creating a delicious treat.

<h2>Tips for storing and handling golden syrup</h2>  
<p>Golden syrup is thick and sticky, making it tricky to measure and store. To keep it fresh, store it in a cool, dry place and ensure the lid is tightly sealed. If your syrup crystallises, gently warm the jar in hot water to return it to its smooth consistency. When measuring 5g, a silicone spatula can help scrape every last bit from your spoon or measuring cup.</p>

faqQ1: "Is 75g of greek yogurt the same as 75ml?"
faqA1: "No, 75g of greek yogurt isn't the same as 75ml. Weight (grams) and volume (millilitres) measure different properties. Greek yogurt is dense, so 75g takes up less space than 75ml of liquid. For accuracy in air fryer recipes, always weigh ingredients when possible."
faqQ2: "Can I use regular yogurt instead of greek yogurt in air fryer recipes?"
faqA2: "You can substitute regular yogurt, but adjustments may be needed. Greek yogurt is thicker, so if a recipe calls for 75g (2.65 oz) of greek yogurt, you might need to strain regular yogurt or reduce other liquids. The texture of your final dish may be slightly different."
faqQ3: "How should I store leftover greek yogurt after measuring out 75g?"
faqA3: "After measuring 75g of greek yogurt, store the remainder in its original container with the lid tightly sealed. Keep it refrigerated and use within the yogurt's expiration date. For longer storage, you can freeze greek yogurt in portions, though the texture may change slightly when thawed."
faqQ4: "Why do some air fryer recipes specify grams instead of ounces for yogurt?"
faqA4: "Many recipes use grams because it's more precise for baking and marinades. Digital scales measure grams accurately, while fluid ounces can vary with ingredient density. European recipes (including many on airfryerrecipe.co.uk) typically use metric measurements, hence the 75g specification rather than ounces."

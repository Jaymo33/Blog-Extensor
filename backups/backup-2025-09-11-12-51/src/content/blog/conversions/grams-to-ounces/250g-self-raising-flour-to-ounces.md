faqQ1: "Can I use plain flour instead of self-raising flour for 250g measurements?"
faqA1: "Yes, but you'll need to add baking powder. For every 250g of plain flour, mix in 2 teaspoons of baking powder to mimic self-raising flour. This ensures your baked goods rise properly in the air fryer."
faqQ2: "How do I measure 250g of self-raising flour without scales?"
faqA2: "Without scales, use the spoon-and-level method: lightly spoon flour into a measuring cup and level it off. Note that 250g of self-raising flour is roughly 2 cups, but weighing is more accurate for air fryer recipes."
faqQ3: "Does 250g of self-raising flour weigh the same as 250g of plain flour?"
faqA3: "Yes, by weight, they’re identical. However, self-raising flour includes raising agents, so swapping them requires adjustments. For air fryer baking, stick to the recipe’s specified flour type."
faqQ4: "Why is my air fryer bake dense when using 250g of self-raising flour?"
faqA4: "Overmixing or outdated flour can cause denseness. Ensure your self-raising flour is fresh, and mix batter gently. Also, verify your air fryer’s temperature for even baking."

faqQ1: "Can I use fresh garlic instead of 25g of garlic paste in air fryer recipes?"
faqA1: "Yes, you can substitute fresh garlic for garlic paste. One clove of fresh garlic is roughly equivalent to 5g of paste, so you’d need about 5 cloves to match 25g (0.88 oz). Fresh garlic offers a sharper flavour, so adjust to taste."
faqQ2: "How do I convert 25g of garlic paste to cups for air fryer recipes?"
faqA2: "Garlic paste is dense, so 25g (0.88 oz) equals roughly 1.5 tablespoons or just under 1/8 cup. For accuracy, we recommend using a scale, especially for air fryer recipes where precision affects cooking times and flavours."
faqQ3: "Does 25g of garlic paste taste stronger in an air fryer compared to oven cooking?"
faqA3: "The air fryer’s concentrated heat can intensify garlic’s flavour, so 25g (0.88 oz) might taste more potent than in an oven. If you’re sensitive to strong garlic, reduce the amount slightly or mix it with oil to mellow the taste."
faqQ4: "How long does 25g of garlic paste last once opened?"
faqA4: "An opened jar of garlic paste stays fresh for about 2 weeks in the fridge. Always seal it tightly and avoid cross-contamination. For longer storage, freeze portions in ice cube trays—each cube holds roughly 25g (0.88 oz)."

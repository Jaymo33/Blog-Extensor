faqQ1: "Can I use a measuring cup instead of a scale for 50g of sesame oil?"
faqA1: "While possible, a measuring cup is less precise. 50g of sesame oil equals roughly 3.5 tablespoons, but viscosity can vary with temperature. For accuracy, especially in air fryer recipes, a digital scale is best."
faqQ2: "Does sesame oil weigh the same as other oils when converting grams to ounces?"
faqA2: "Most oils have similar densities, so 50g of sesame oil (1.76 oz) is nearly equivalent to 50g of olive or vegetable oil. However, toasted sesame oil is slightly denser, but the difference is minimal for home cooking."
faqQ3: "Why does my air fryer smoke when using sesame oil?"
faqA3: "Sesame oil has a low smoke point. If you’re converting 50g sesame oil to ounces (1.76 oz) for air frying, use it sparingly or mix with a high-smoke-point oil. Overheating can cause smoking and bitter flavours."
faqQ4: "Where can I find more air fryer recipes using sesame oil?"
faqA4: "Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipes</a> or <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable dishes</a> for sesame oil ideas. From glazes to stir-fries, precise measurements like 50g (1.76 oz) ensure perfect results every time."

<h2>Why Convert Grams to Ounces for Sesame Oil?</h2>  
<p>Many UK recipes use grams, while others reference ounces, making conversions necessary. Sesame oil is often used in small quantities, so even a slight mismeasurement can affect taste and texture.

If you're preparing a dish like sesame-glazed salmon or crispy tofu, precision ensures the oil coats evenly without overpowering.</p>

<h3>How to Measure 50g of Sesame Oil Accurately</h3>

If you don’t have a scale, 50g of sesame oil is roughly 3.5 tablespoons, but weighing is always more precise. For air fryer recipes like sesame chicken or roasted vegetables, exact measurements ensure even crisping and flavour distribution.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for 50g of Sesame Oil in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Using the correct amount of ingredients ensures your air fryer meals turn out perfectly every time.

<h3>How to Measure 25g of Cottage Cheese Without a Scale</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a kitchen scale, you can estimate 25g of cottage cheese using tablespoons. One tablespoon of cottage cheese weighs roughly 15g, so 1.5 tablespoons will get you close to 25g. However, for baking or precise recipes, investing in a digital scale is worthwhile. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we recommend scales for consistent results.</p>

<h3>Common Mistakes When Measuring Cottage Cheese</h3>  
<p>One mistake is draining the liquid before measuring, which can lead to inaccuracies. For 25g of cottage cheese, measure it as-is, including the whey. Another error is packing it into measuring spoons, which adds excess weight. For best results, spoon it lightly and level it off.</p>

faqQ1: "Can I use honey instead of maple syrup for 125g in air fryer recipes?"
faqA1: "Yes, honey can substitute maple syrup in a 1:1 ratio by weight (125g honey = 125g maple syrup). However, honey is sweeter and thicker, so you may need to adjust cooking times slightly. For best results, thin it with a teaspoon of water for glazes."
faqQ2: "How do I clean my air fryer after using sticky maple syrup?"
faqA2: "Sticky residues can be tricky. Once the air fryer cools, wipe the basket with warm, soapy water or use a dedicated <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner</a>. For stubborn spots, a baking soda paste works wonders. Avoid abrasive scrubbers to prevent damage."
faqQ3: "Does maple syrup burn easily in the air fryer?"
faqA3: "Maple syrup can burn if exposed to high heat for too long. To prevent this, brush it onto food during the last 5–10 minutes of cooking. For even coverage, mix it with a little oil or butter before applying."
faqQ4: "Is 125g of maple syrup the same as 125ml?"
faqA4: "No, 125g of maple syrup is roughly 90ml due to its density. Weight (grams) is more accurate for recipes, as volume (millilitres) can vary based on temperature and syrup thickness. Always measure by weight for consistency."

<p>125g of maple syrup is approximately 4.41 ounces. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precision matters, especially when glazing meats or baking desserts. Whether you’re using a digital scale or measuring cups, knowing the exact weight ensures your dish turns out perfectly every time.</p>

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on precise cooking times and ingredient ratios to deliver crispy, evenly cooked results. Using the correct amount of maple syrup—whether 125g or its ounce equivalent—ensures your marinades, glazes, or baked goods have the right consistency. Too much syrup can make dishes overly sweet or sticky, while too little might leave them lacking flavour.</p>  
<p>For example, if you’re making <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer glazed salmon</a>, 125g of maple syrup (4.41 oz) balances sweetness without overpowering the fish. Similarly, in desserts like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>air fryer cakes</a>, precise measurements prevent soggy or dry outcomes. Always double-check conversions to avoid kitchen mishaps.</p>  

<h3>How to measure 125g of maple syrup without a scale</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a kitchen scale, you can use volume measurements. Since maple syrup is dense, 125g equals roughly 6 tablespoons or 90 millilitres. However, weight measurements are more accurate, so investing in a scale is worthwhile for frequent bakers.

<h2>Common uses for 125g of maple syrup in air fryer recipes</h2>  
<p>Maple syrup isn’t just for pancakes—it’s a versatile ingredient in air fryer cooking. From glazes to marinades, 125g (4.41 oz) can transform simple dishes into gourmet meals. Try it in sticky <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>air fryer chicken wings</a> or as a sweetener for roasted vegetables like carrots or sweet potatoes.</p>  
<p>Another great use is in <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>air fryer desserts</a>, such as syrup-drizzled apple chips or pecan pies. The key is distributing the syrup evenly, so it caramelises without burning. Always preheat your air fryer and lightly coat the basket with oil to prevent sticking.</p>  

<h3>Tips for storing maple syrup</h3>  
<p>To keep maple syrup fresh, store it in an airtight container in the fridge after opening. Proper storage ensures it retains its flavour and consistency for future recipes. If you notice crystallisation, gently warm the syrup in a water bath before using it in your air fryer dishes.</p>

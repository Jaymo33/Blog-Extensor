faqQ1: "Is 100g of honey the same as 100ml?"
faqA1: "No, 100g of honey is not the same as 100ml. Honey is denser than water, so 100g equals roughly 69ml. Always weigh honey for accuracy in air fryer recipes, especially for baking or glazing."
faqQ2: "Can I use a tablespoon to measure 100g of honey?"
faqA2: "While possible, it’s not the most accurate method. One tablespoon of honey weighs about 21g, so 100g would be roughly 4.7 tablespoons. For precision, a digital scale is recommended, especially in air fryer cooking where exact measurements matter."
faqQ3: "Does the type of honey affect the 100g to ounces conversion?"
faqA3: "The conversion (100g = 3.53 oz) applies to most honey types, though thicker varieties like manuka may vary slightly in volume. Weight remains consistent, making grams to ounces reliable for all honey types in air fryer recipes."
faqQ4: "How do I adjust air fryer cooking times for honey-glazed dishes?"
faqA4: "Honey caramelises faster than sugar, so reduce the temperature by 10-15°C and check frequently. For example, honey-glazed chicken may cook in 12-15 minutes instead of 15-20. Always monitor to prevent burning."

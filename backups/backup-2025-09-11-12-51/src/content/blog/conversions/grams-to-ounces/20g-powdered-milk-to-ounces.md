faqQ1: "Is 20g of powdered milk the same as 20ml?"
faqA1: "No, 20g of powdered milk is not the same as 20ml. Grams measure weight while millilitres measure volume. Since powdered milk is a dry ingredient, its volume can vary based on how compacted it is. For accuracy in air fryer recipes, always weigh powdered milk rather than using volume measurements."
faqQ2: "Can I use liquid milk instead of 20g powdered milk in air fryer recipes?"
faqA2: "You can substitute liquid milk for powdered milk, but you'll need to adjust other recipe ingredients. Generally, 20g powdered milk equals about 200ml of liquid milk, but this will add extra moisture to your recipe. For air fryer baking, it's often better to stick with powdered milk as specified to maintain the right texture."
faqQ3: "How many calories are in 20g of powdered milk?"
faqA3: "There are approximately 100 calories in 20g of full-fat powdered milk, or about 80 calories in skimmed powdered milk. The calorie content doesn't change when converting 20g powdered milk to ounces, as it's still the same amount of product just measured differently. This makes powdered milk a calorie-dense ingredient in air fryer recipes."
faqQ4: "Why do air fryer recipes often use powdered milk instead of fresh?"
faqA4: "Air fryer recipes frequently use powdered milk because it doesn't add excess moisture that could prevent proper crisping. The concentrated dairy flavour also comes through better in the quick cooking environment. Plus, powdered milk has a longer shelf life than fresh milk, making it convenient for keeping on hand when inspiration strikes."

This conversion is essential when following air fryer recipes that require precise measurements, especially for baked goods where ingredient ratios matter. Whether you're making air fryer cakes or creamy sauces, knowing how to convert 20g powdered milk to ounces ensures consistent results every time.</p>

<h2>Why accurate powdered milk measurements matter</h2>
<p>Powdered milk behaves differently than liquid milk in recipes, so getting the 20g to ounces conversion right affects texture and flavour. Too much can make baked goods dry, while too little might leave sauces watery. Many air fryer recipes at <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes</a> use powdered milk for its shelf stability and concentrated flavour.</p>
<p>When converting 20g powdered milk to oz UK measurements, remember that 1 ounce equals about 28.35 grams. This means 20 grams is just under three-quarters of an ounce. For most home cooking purposes, rounding to 0.7 ounces works perfectly fine without sacrificing recipe quality.</p>

<h2>How to measure 20g powdered milk without scales</h2>
<p>If you don't have digital scales, you can still measure 20g of powdered milk (approximately 0.71 ounces) using volume measurements. One level tablespoon of powdered milk typically weighs about 6-7 grams, so 20g would be roughly 3 slightly heaped tablespoons. However, for best results in air fryer baking, we recommend using proper scales.</p>
<p>Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> includes common ingredient weights to help with these kitchen calculations. When working with powdered milk specifically, always fluff it up in the container before scooping to prevent compacted measurements that could throw off your 20g to ounces conversion.</p>

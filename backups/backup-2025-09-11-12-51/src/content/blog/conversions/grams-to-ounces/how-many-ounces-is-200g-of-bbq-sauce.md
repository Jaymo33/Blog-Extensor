faqQ1: "Is 200g of BBQ sauce the same as 200ml?"
faqA1: "No, 200g and 200ml are not the same. Grams measure weight, while millilitres measure volume. The conversion depends on the sauce's density. For BBQ sauce, 200g is roughly 190-200ml, but it’s best to weigh it for accuracy, especially in air fryer cooking."
faqQ2: "Can I use a measuring cup for 200g of BBQ sauce?"
faqA2: "Yes, but it’s less precise. A standard measuring cup holds about 240ml, so 200g of BBQ sauce would be slightly less than a full cup. For best results, especially in air fryer recipes, use a kitchen scale to measure 200g (or 7.05 oz) directly."
faqQ3: "How many servings does 200g of BBQ sauce make?"
faqA3: "It depends on the dish. For marinating, 200g covers 4-6 portions of chicken or pork. As a glaze or dipping sauce, it can serve 6-8 people. Check our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipes page</a> for portion-specific ideas."
faqQ4: "Does the brand of BBQ sauce affect the 200g to ounces conversion?"
faqA4: "No, the brand doesn’t change the weight conversion. However, thicker sauces might measure slightly differently by volume. Always weigh 200g for consistency, particularly when using your air fryer for even cooking."

<p>200g of BBQ sauce equals approximately 7.05 ounces. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements can make or break your dish. Whether you’re marinating chicken or glazing ribs, knowing how to convert grams to ounces ensures consistency. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we understand the importance of accurate measurements for perfect results every time.</p>

<h2>Why Convert 200g of BBQ Sauce to Ounces?</h2>
<p>Many air fryer recipes, especially those from the UK, use metric measurements like grams. However, some kitchen scales or recipes might require ounces. Converting 200g of BBQ sauce to ounces helps you follow recipes accurately, whether you’re using a digital scale or measuring cups. This is particularly useful for sauces, where consistency affects cooking times and results.</p>
<p>For example, if you’re making sticky BBQ chicken in your air fryer, the right amount of sauce ensures even coating and caramelisation. Too little, and your dish might lack flavour; too much, and it could become soggy.

<h2>How to Measure 200g of BBQ Sauce</h2>
<p>If you don’t have a scale, you can still measure 200g of BBQ sauce using volume. Roughly, 200g is about 12 tablespoons or ¾ cup. However, this can vary slightly depending on the sauce’s thickness. For the most accurate results, we recommend using a kitchen scale set to grams or ounces.</p>

The versatility of BBQ sauce makes it a staple in many kitchens, and knowing the ounce equivalent helps streamline your cooking process.</p>

<h2>Tips for Working with BBQ Sauce in the Air Fryer</h2>

For dishes like wings or drumsticks, toss them in 200g of BBQ sauce after they’re nearly done, then return them to the air fryer for a final crisp.</p>

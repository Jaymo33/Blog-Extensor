faqQ1: "Can I use a kitchen scale to measure 30g of honey?"
faqA1: "Yes, a kitchen scale is the most accurate way to measure 30g of honey. Place your container on the scale, tare it to zero, then add honey until you reach 30g. This method eliminates guesswork and ensures precise measurements for air fryer recipes."
faqQ2: "How many teaspoons is 30g of honey?"
faqA2: "30g of honey is roughly 4.5 teaspoons. Since honey is denser than water, it’s best to use a measuring spoon designed for sticky ingredients. For air fryer recipes, slightly rounding up to 5 teaspoons won’t drastically affect the outcome."
faqQ3: "Does the type of honey affect the weight-to-ounce conversion?"
faqA3: "All types of honey (e.g., manuka, clover) have similar densities, so 30g will always equal about 1.06 ounces. However, thicker honeys may take longer to pour, so warm the jar slightly for easier measuring in air fryer recipes."
faqQ4: "Can I substitute syrup for honey in air fryer recipes?"
faqA4: "Yes, maple or agave syrup can replace honey in a 1:1 ratio by weight (30g = 1.06 oz). Note that syrups have different sweetness levels, so adjust other ingredients accordingly. Check our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipes</a> for syrup-based alternatives."

<h2>Why accurate honey measurements matter</h2>  
<p>Honey is a sticky ingredient, and even small measurement errors can throw off the balance of your recipe. Too much honey can make dishes overly sweet or cause uneven cooking in the air fryer. Too little might leave your meal lacking flavour. By converting 30g of honey to ounces (1.06 oz), you can measure with confidence. This is especially useful for recipes like honey-glazed salmon or sticky chicken wings, where precision is key.</p>  
<p>For those who love baking in the air fryer, honey adds moisture and sweetness to cakes and cookies. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a> includes plenty of sweet treats that rely on accurate honey measurements. Whether you’re making a batch of honey cookies or a drizzle for desserts, knowing 30g equals 1.06 ounces ensures perfect results.</p>  

<h2>How to measure honey without scales</h2>  
<p>Not everyone has kitchen scales handy, but there are easy ways to measure 30g of honey (1.06 oz) without them. A standard tablespoon holds about 21g of honey, so 1.5 tablespoons will get you close to 30g. For a more precise method, use a measuring jug with fluid ounces—30g of honey is roughly 1.5 fluid ounces. Just remember, honey’s thickness means it won’t pour as easily as water.</p>  

<h3>Using honey in air fryer recipes</h3>

<h2>Common honey conversions for air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Beyond 30g, here are other handy honey conversions: 15g is about 0.53 ounces, and 50g equals roughly 1.76 ounces. These measurements are useful for scaling recipes up or down.

<p>Storing honey correctly also matters. Keep it in a cool, dry place to prevent crystallisation. If your honey hardens, gently warm the jar in warm water to restore its pourable consistency. This makes measuring 30g (1.06 oz) much easier when you’re ready to cook.</p>

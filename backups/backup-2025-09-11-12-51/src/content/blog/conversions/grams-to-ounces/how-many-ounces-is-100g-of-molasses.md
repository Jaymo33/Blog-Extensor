faqQ1: "Can I use a cup to measure 100g of molasses instead of a scale?"
faqA1: "While possible, it’s less accurate. A standard UK metric cup holds about 280g of molasses (nearly 10 oz), so you’d need roughly 1/3 cup for 100g (3.53 oz). For precision, especially in baking, a digital scale is best."
faqQ2: "Does the type of molasses affect the weight-to-ounce conversion?"
faqA2: "No—whether it’s light, dark, or blackstrap molasses, 100g always equals 3.53 oz. The viscosity may vary slightly, but the weight conversion remains consistent for air fryer recipes."
faqQ3: "How do I convert ounces back to grams if my recipe uses imperial measurements?"
faqA3: "Multiply ounces by 28.35 to get grams. For example, 3.53 oz x 28.35 = 100g. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a> simplifies this for all common ingredients."
faqQ4: "Why does my air fryer recipe call for molasses by weight instead of volume?"
faqA4: "Weight (grams or ounces) is more accurate than volume (cups or spoons) for thick liquids like molasses. This ensures consistency, especially in baked goods where exact ratios affect texture and rise."

faqQ1: "Can I use cups instead of grams or ounces for breadcrumbs?"
faqA1: "While you can use cups, weights (grams or ounces) are more accurate for air fryer recipes. Breadcrumb density varies by brand, so 100g might be 1¼ cups for one type but 1½ cups for another. A kitchen scale ensures consistency."
faqQ2: "Do panko breadcrumbs weigh the same as regular breadcrumbs?"
faqA2: "Panko breadcrumbs are lighter and flakier, so 100g of panko will take up more volume than regular breadcrumbs. However, the weight in ounces (3.53 oz) remains the same. Adjust recipes if swapping types for texture preferences."
faqQ3: "How long do 100g of breadcrumbs last in storage?"
faqA3: "Stored in an airtight container, 100g of dry breadcrumbs can last up to 6 months in a cool, dark place. For freshness, label with the date and check for moisture or off smells before use."
faqQ4: "Can I substitute crushed crackers for breadcrumbs in air fryer recipes?"
faqA4: "Yes, crushed crackers work as a substitute, but weigh them for accuracy. 100g of crackers equals roughly 3.53 ounces, similar to breadcrumbs. Note that crackers may add extra saltiness, so adjust seasonings accordingly."

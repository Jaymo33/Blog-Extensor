faqQ1: "Can I use butter instead of margarine in air fryer recipes?"
faqA1: "Yes, you can substitute butter for margarine, but keep in mind that butter has a higher water content. This may affect browning and crispiness. Use the same weight (30g or 1.06 oz) for best results."
faqQ2: "How do I store margarine for air fryer cooking?"
faqA2: "Margarine should be kept in the fridge to maintain freshness. If you need softened margarine for a recipe, let it sit at room temperature for 10–15 minutes before measuring 30g (1.06 oz)."
faqQ3: "Is 30g of margarine the same as 30ml?"
faqA3: "No, grams measure weight, while millilitres measure volume. Margarine’s density means 30g is roughly 30ml, but for accuracy, always weigh it."
faqQ4: "Can I reduce the amount of margarine in air fryer recipes?"
faqA4: "Yes, but reducing margarine may affect texture. For healthier options, try using 15g (0.53 oz) and a spritz of oil. Check our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipes</a> for low-fat ideas."

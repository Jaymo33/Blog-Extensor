faqQ1: "Can I use golden syrup instead of treacle in air fryer recipes?"
faqA1: "Yes, you can substitute golden syrup for treacle, but the flavour will be lighter and less molasses-like. Use the same weight (25g or 0.88 ounces) for a similar consistency, but expect a milder taste."
faqQ2: "How do I clean treacle residue from my air fryer basket?"
faqA2: "Treacle can leave sticky residue, but a warm soapy soak and gentle scrub will remove it. For stubborn spots, use a baking soda paste. Always ensure your air fryer is unplugged and cooled before cleaning."
faqQ3: "Does treacle affect cooking times in an air fryer?"
faqA3: "Treacle can caramelise quickly, so dishes with treacle may cook faster. Keep an eye on your food and reduce the temperature slightly if needed. A 25g portion shouldn’t drastically alter timing, but monitor closely."
faqQ4: "Where can I find more air fryer recipes using treacle?"
faqA4: "Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert category</a> for treacle-based recipes like sticky puddings and cakes. We also feature savoury glazes in our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipes</a>."

<p>25g of treacle equals approximately 0.88 ounces. This conversion is essential for anyone using an air fryer, especially when following recipes that require precise measurements. Whether you're making sticky toffee pudding or a glaze for meats, knowing how to convert grams to ounces ensures your dish turns out perfectly.</p>

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on precise cooking times and temperatures to deliver crispy, evenly cooked food. Using the correct amount of ingredients, like treacle, ensures your recipes turn out as intended. Too much or too little can affect texture and flavour, so getting the conversion right is key.</p>  
<p>For example, if you're making a treacle-based marinade for chicken, 25g of treacle (0.88 ounces) will give you the perfect balance of sweetness. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> for more inspiration on how to use treacle in your cooking.</p>  

<h2>How to measure 25g of treacle without scales</h2>  
<p>If you don’t have a kitchen scale, you can still measure 25g of treacle using tablespoons. One tablespoon of treacle weighs roughly 20g, so 25g is just over one tablespoon. This method isn’t as precise as using scales, but it works in a pinch.</p>

<h3>Common uses for treacle in air fryer recipes</h3>  
<p>Treacle adds a rich, molasses-like flavour to both sweet and savoury dishes. It’s often used in cakes, marinades, and glazes. For instance, a 25g portion of treacle can be brushed onto salmon before air frying for a caramelised finish.</p>  

<h3>Storing treacle for future use</h3>  
<p>Treacle has a long shelf life, but it’s best stored in an airtight container to prevent it from drying out. If you’ve measured out 25g for a recipe, ensure the rest is sealed properly.

<h2>Converting other common ingredients</h2>  
<p>Just like 25g of treacle equals 0.88 ounces, other ingredients have their own conversions. For example, 25g of flour is roughly 0.88 ounces as well, but the volume will differ due to density. Always check specific conversions for accuracy.</p>

<h3>Tips for measuring sticky ingredients like treacle</h3>  
<p>Treacle can be tricky to measure due to its sticky consistency. Lightly greasing your measuring spoon or scale bowl with oil helps it slide off easily. This small trick saves time and ensures you get the exact 25g (0.88 ounces) needed for your recipe.</p>

<h2>Why Convert 30g of Ginger Paste to Ounces?</h2>  
<p>Many UK recipes use metric measurements, but some kitchen scales or international recipes might list ingredients in ounces. Converting 30g of ginger paste to ounces (1.06 oz) helps avoid guesswork and ensures your dish turns out perfectly. Ginger paste is a concentrated ingredient, so even small discrepancies can alter the taste. For air fryer cooking, where flavours intensify, precision is key.

Whether you’re following a recipe from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>our collection</a> or improvising, knowing the exact ounce equivalent of 30g ensures balanced flavours.

<h3>How to Measure 30g of Ginger Paste Without Scales</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have scales, you can estimate 30g of ginger paste using tablespoons. One tablespoon of ginger paste weighs roughly 15g, so 30g would be two level tablespoons. However, for accuracy, we recommend using digital scales. Air fryer recipes often rely on precise ratios, especially for marinades or sauces where ginger paste plays a starring role.

<h3>Storing Leftover Ginger Paste</h3>

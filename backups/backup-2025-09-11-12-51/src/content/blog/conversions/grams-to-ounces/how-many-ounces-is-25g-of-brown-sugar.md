faqQ1: "How do I measure 25g of brown sugar without a scale?"
faqA1: "You can measure 25g of brown sugar using tablespoons. Two level UK tablespoons (about 12.5g each) will give you roughly 25g. For packed brown sugar, lightly press it into the spoon for accuracy. This method works well for air fryer recipes where precision matters."
faqQ2: "Why is 25g of brown sugar a common measurement in air fryer recipes?"
faqA2: "25g of brown sugar (0.88 ounces) is often used because it provides the right balance of sweetness and moisture without overpowering dishes. In air fryer cooking, this amount is perfect for glazes, desserts, and even some savoury dishes, ensuring even caramelisation and flavour."
faqQ3: "Can I use white sugar instead of brown sugar in air fryer recipes?"
faqA3: "Yes, but the results will differ. Brown sugar adds moisture and a deeper flavour due to its molasses content. If substituting, use the same weight (25g or 0.88 ounces), but expect a slightly different texture and taste. For best results, stick to the recipe’s recommended sugar type."
faqQ4: "How do I convert larger amounts of brown sugar from grams to ounces?"
faqA4: "To convert larger amounts, remember that 100g of brown sugar equals 3.53 ounces. For 50g, it’s 1.76 ounces. Use these benchmarks to scale recipes up or down.

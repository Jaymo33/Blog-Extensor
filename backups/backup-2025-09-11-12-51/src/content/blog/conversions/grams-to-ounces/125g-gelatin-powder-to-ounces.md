faqQ1: "Can I use volume measurements instead of weight for gelatin powder?"
faqA1: "While possible, weight measurements (grams or ounces) are far more accurate for gelatin powder. Volume measures like cups can vary due to settling or packing, leading to inconsistent results. Always use a scale for best outcomes."
faqQ2: "Does gelatin powder behave differently in an air fryer?"
faqA2: "Gelatin sets based on temperature, not cooking method. However, air fryers heat quickly, so monitor closely to prevent overheating, which can weaken gelatin’s setting power. Follow recipes precisely for perfect texture."
faqQ3: "How do I convert other amounts of gelatin powder to ounces?"
faqA3: "Use the same ratio: 1 gram = 0.035 ounces. Multiply any gram amount by 0.035 for the ounce equivalent. For example, 250g gelatin powder would be 8.82 ounces. Keep our conversion chart handy for quick checks."
faqQ4: "Why does my gelatin powder clump when measuring?"
faqA4: "Moisture exposure causes clumping. Store gelatin in a sealed container and sift before measuring. For 125g gelatin powder to ounces, use a scale directly rather than scooping to ensure accuracy. Clumps can lead to uneven setting."

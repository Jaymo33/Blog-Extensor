faqQ1: "Can I use golden syrup instead of treacle in air fryer recipes?"
faqA1: "While you can substitute golden syrup for treacle, the flavour will be different. Treacle has a deeper, more robust taste. If substituting, use slightly less golden syrup as it's sweeter. The conversion for 500g (17.64 oz) would remain the same by weight, but the flavour impact will vary."
faqQ2: "How do I measure 500g of treacle without making a sticky mess?"
faqA2: "Lightly grease your measuring spoon or cup with oil first - this helps the treacle slide off easily. For 500g (about 17.64 oz), using digital scales is most accurate. If using tablespoons, remember it's about 25 lightly packed tablespoons of treacle. Always measure over a bowl to catch any drips."
faqQ3: "Does treacle behave differently in an air fryer compared to a regular oven?"
faqA3: "Yes, the concentrated heat of an air fryer can cause treacle to caramelise faster. When using 500g (17.64 oz) in recipes, watch carefully to prevent burning. You might need to reduce cooking time slightly compared to conventional oven recipes. Covering with foil can help prevent over-browning."
faqQ4: "How long does an opened tin of treacle last?"
faqA4: "An opened tin of treacle lasts about 12 months if stored properly. Keep it in an airtight container in a cool, dark place. There's no need to refrigerate. Always check for any mould or off smells before using, especially if you've had it open for a while. The 500g (17.64 oz) measurement remains accurate regardless of storage time."

Whether you're making sticky toffee pudding or glazing meats in your air fryer, knowing how to convert grams to ounces is a game-changer.</p>

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>
<p>Using the right amount of treacle can make or break your dish. Too little, and your glaze won't have that rich, sticky sweetness. Too much, and it could overpower other flavours or even cause burning in the air fryer. That's why conversions like 500g of treacle to ounces are so important for consistent results.</p>
<p>At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we understand that precision matters. Many of our popular recipes, from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>desserts</a> to glazed meats, call for exact treacle measurements. Getting your conversions right means your dishes will turn out perfectly every time.</p>

<h2>How to measure 500g of treacle without scales</h2>
<p>Don't have digital scales? No problem. You can still measure 500g of treacle (about 17.64 ounces) using standard kitchen measurements. One tablespoon of treacle weighs roughly 20g, so 500g would be about 25 tablespoons. Remember, treacle is sticky, so lightly grease your measuring spoon first for accurate results.</p>
<p>For air fryer recipes where precision is key, we recommend investing in a good set of digital scales. This is especially important when working with sticky ingredients like treacle, where volume measurements can be less reliable than weight.

faqQ1: "Can I use a cup to measure 75g of jam instead of scales?"
faqA1: "While possible, it’s less accurate. Jam’s thickness varies, so 75g might not fill a standard cup uniformly. For best results, use digital scales. If you must use a cup, check a conversion chart for jam’s specific density."
faqQ2: "Does the type of jam affect the 75g to ounces conversion?"
faqA2: "No, the conversion remains the same (75g = 2.65 oz) regardless of jam type. However, thicker jams like marmalade may pack differently in a measuring spoon, so scales are more reliable."
faqQ3: "How do I clean my air fryer after using jam?"
faqA3: "Wipe the basket with warm, soapy water immediately to prevent stickiness. For stubborn residue, use our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning guide</a>. Avoid abrasive scrubbers to protect non-stick coatings."
faqQ4: "Can I substitute 75g of jam with another sweetener in air fryer recipes?"
faqA4: "Yes, honey or maple syrup can work, but adjust quantities as they’re thinner. For 75g of jam, use about 60g of liquid sweetener and reduce other liquids in the recipe slightly."

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>

<h2>Common Uses for 75g of Jam in Air Fryer Recipes</h2>

You can also swirl it into <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/breakfast>breakfast pastries</a> or mix it with oats for crumble toppings. Since air fryers cook quickly, the jam’s sugars won’t burn if measured correctly.</p>

faqQ1: "How accurate is the 5g to 0.18 oz conversion for soy sauce?"
faqA1: "The conversion is highly accurate, as 5 grams universally equals approximately 0.18 ounces. However, slight variations can occur due to soy sauce density or brand differences. For air fryer recipes, this small margin won’t significantly impact results."
faqQ2: "Can I use tablespoons instead of grams or ounces for soy sauce?"
faqA2: "Yes, but precision matters. One teaspoon holds roughly 5g (0.18 oz) of soy sauce, while a tablespoon is about 15g. For air fryer cooking, sticking to weight measurements ensures consistency, especially in marinades or glazes."
faqQ3: "Why does my air fryer recipe taste too salty with 5g of soy sauce?"
faqA3: "Soy sauce brands vary in sodium content. If your dish is too salty, try reducing to 4g or using a low-sodium version. The air fryer’s intense heat can also concentrate flavours, so adjust accordingly."
faqQ4: "Is 5g of soy sauce enough for a marinade in the air fryer?"
faqA4: "For a single portion, 5g (0.18 oz) works well when combined with other ingredients like oil or honey. For larger batches, scale up proportionally. Check our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipes</a> for marinade ideas tailored to air fryers."

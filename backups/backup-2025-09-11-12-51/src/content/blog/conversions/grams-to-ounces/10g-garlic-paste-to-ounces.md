faqQ1: "How do I convert 10g of garlic paste to ounces without a scale?"
faqA1: "If you don't have a scale, you can use a teaspoon for rough measurements. Two level teaspoons of garlic paste equal approximately 10g (0.35 oz). For sticky ingredients, lightly oil the spoon to help the paste slide off easily."
faqQ2: "Can I use fresh garlic instead of garlic paste in air fryer recipes?"
faqA2: "Yes, you can substitute fresh garlic for garlic paste. One clove of fresh garlic is roughly equivalent to 5g (0.18 oz) of paste. Adjust the quantity based on your taste preference, keeping in mind that fresh garlic has a sharper flavour."
faqQ3: "Does garlic paste weigh the same as minced garlic?"
faqA3: "Garlic paste and minced garlic have similar weights, but paste is more concentrated due to its smoother texture. 10g of garlic paste is roughly equal to 10g of minced garlic, but the paste may pack more flavour per gram."
faqQ4: "How should I store leftover garlic paste?"
faqA4: "Store leftover garlic paste in an airtight container in the fridge for up to two weeks. For longer storage, freeze it in small portions. Always check for freshness before using, as garlic paste can lose its potency over time."

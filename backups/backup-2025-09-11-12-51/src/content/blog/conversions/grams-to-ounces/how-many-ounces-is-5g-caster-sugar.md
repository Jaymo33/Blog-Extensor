faqQ1: "Is 5g of caster sugar the same as 5g of granulated sugar in ounces?"
faqA1: "Yes, 5g of caster sugar and 5g of granulated sugar both equal approximately 0.18 ounces by weight. However, caster sugar dissolves faster due to its finer texture, which can affect certain recipes."
faqQ2: "Can I use a tablespoon to measure 5g of caster sugar?"
faqA2: "A tablespoon holds about 12-15g of caster sugar, so it’s not precise for measuring 5g (0.18 oz). For accuracy, use a teaspoon (roughly 5g) or a digital scale."
faqQ3: "Why do air fryer recipes sometimes use small amounts like 5g of caster sugar?"
faqA3: "Air fryers require less sugar than traditional baking because they intensify flavours. Small quantities like 5g (0.18 oz) prevent over-sweetening and ensure even cooking in the compact space."
faqQ4: "How do I convert ounces back to grams if my scale defaults to ounces?"
faqA4: "Multiply ounces by 28.35 to get grams. For example, 0.18 oz x 28.35 = 5g. Keep a conversion chart handy for quick reference during cooking."

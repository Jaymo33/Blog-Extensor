faqQ1: "Can I use jarred minced garlic instead of fresh chopped garlic for 40g?"
faqA1: "While jarred minced garlic is convenient, it often contains preservatives or liquids that alter the weight and flavour. For accurate measurements and the best taste, fresh chopped garlic is recommended when a recipe specifies 40g."
faqQ2: "How many cloves of garlic make up 40g when chopped?"
faqA2: "Approximately 8-10 medium-sized garlic cloves, when finely chopped, equal around 40g. However, clove sizes vary, so using a kitchen scale is the most precise method to measure 40g of chopped garlic."
faqQ3: "Does 40g of chopped garlic change weight when cooked in an air fryer?"
faqA3: "Yes, cooking reduces the weight slightly due to moisture loss. However, the difference is minimal for small quantities like 40g. For recipes requiring precise measurements, it’s best to weigh the garlic before cooking."
faqQ4: "What’s the best way to store leftover chopped garlic?"
faqA4: "Store leftover chopped garlic in an airtight container in the fridge for up to a week. For longer storage, freeze it in ice cube trays with a bit of oil. Always label with the weight (e.g., 40g portions) for easy use later."

<h2>Why converting 40g of chopped garlic to ounces matters</h2>  
<p>Accurate measurements are crucial in cooking, especially when using an air fryer. Too much or too little garlic can drastically alter the flavour of your dish.

<p>Garlic is a staple in many air fryer dishes, from roasted vegetables to marinades. Using the correct amount ensures balanced flavours without overpowering other ingredients. If you’re preparing a garlic-heavy dish like garlic bread or shrimp scampi, precise measurements are even more important. Overloading your air fryer basket with too much garlic can also affect cooking times. Stick to 40g (1.41 oz) for best results, and adjust based on your taste preferences.</p>  

<h2>How to measure 40g of chopped garlic accurately</h2>  
<p>Measuring chopped garlic by weight is more reliable than using volume measurements like tablespoons. A kitchen scale is the best tool for this, ensuring you get exactly 40g (1.41 oz) every time. If you don’t have a scale, roughly 8-10 medium-sized garlic cloves, finely chopped, will weigh around 40g. However, this can vary based on clove size, so a scale is always preferable.

<h3>Using 40g of chopped garlic in air fryer recipes</h3>

<h2>Common mistakes when measuring chopped garlic</h2>  
<p>One mistake is using pre-minced garlic from a jar instead of fresh chopped garlic. Jarred garlic often has added liquids, altering the weight and flavour. Always opt for fresh garlic when a recipe calls for 40g of chopped garlic. Another error is packing the garlic too tightly when measuring, which can lead to using more than needed. For best results, loosely fill your measuring tool or use a scale.

<h3>Adjusting recipes for personal taste</h3>  
<p>While 40g of chopped garlic equals 1.41 ounces, you can tweak this based on your preferences. If you love bold garlic flavours, feel free to add a bit more. For milder dishes, reduce the amount slightly. The air fryer’s concentrated heat means garlic flavours intensify, so adjust accordingly.

faqQ1: "Can I use quick oats instead of rolled oats for 20g measurements?"
faqA1: "Yes, you can substitute quick oats for rolled oats in a 1:1 ratio by weight (20g = 0.71 oz). However, quick oats absorb liquid faster, so you may need to adjust other ingredients slightly. In air fryer recipes, rolled oats often provide better texture for coatings or crumbles."
faqQ2: "How many calories are in 20g of rolled oats?"
faqA2: "20g of rolled oats contains approximately 75 calories. This makes it a great portion for light breakfasts or snacks in the air fryer. The exact calories can vary slightly by brand, so check your packaging if you’re tracking closely."
faqQ3: "Do 20g of rolled oats expand when cooked in the air fryer?"
faqA3: "Rolled oats will soften but don’t expand dramatically in the air fryer like they might when boiled. For recipes like granola or coatings, 20g will maintain roughly the same volume. Always spread oats evenly in the air fryer basket for best results."
faqQ4: "Is 20g of rolled oats enough for one serving of overnight oats?"
faqA4: "20g (0.71 oz) makes a small but satisfying single serving of overnight oats when combined with liquid. For heartier portions, you might want to increase to 40-50g. In the air fryer, 20g works well for crispy toppings or mix-ins."

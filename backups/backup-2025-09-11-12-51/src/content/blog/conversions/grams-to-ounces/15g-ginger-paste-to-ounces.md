faqQ1: "Can I use fresh ginger instead of 15g ginger paste?"
faqA1: "Yes, you can substitute fresh ginger for ginger paste. About 1 tablespoon of freshly grated ginger equals 15g of paste. However, fresh ginger has a sharper flavour, so adjust to taste. For air fryer recipes, paste blends more evenly, but fresh works in a pinch."
faqQ2: "How do I convert 15g ginger paste to cups?"
faqA2: "15g of ginger paste is roughly 1 tablespoon, which equals about 0.06 cups. Since ginger paste is dense, it’s best measured by weight for accuracy. If you don’t have a scale, use the spoon method mentioned earlier."
faqQ3: "Does 15g ginger paste work well in desserts?"
faqA3: "Absolutely! Ginger paste adds warmth to desserts like cakes or biscuits. Use 15g (0.53 ounces) in spice mixes or drizzle it over baked fruits in the air fryer. Pair it with cinnamon or honey for a delicious twist."
faqQ4: "How long does 15g ginger paste last in the fridge?"
faqA4: "Stored properly in an airtight container, 15g of ginger paste lasts up to two weeks in the fridge. For longer storage, freeze it in portions. Always check for mould or off smells before using."

Let’s dive deeper into why this measurement matters and how to use it effectively.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate ginger paste measurements matter</h2>  
<p>Ginger paste adds a bold, spicy kick to dishes, but too much or too little can alter the taste significantly. In air fryer cooking, where flavours are concentrated, precision is key. For example, 15g of ginger paste (0.53 ounces) is often the perfect amount for marinades or sauces. If you’re preparing a <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken dish</a>, this measurement ensures balanced flavour without overpowering the meat. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a> simplifies these calculations, so you can focus on cooking.</p>  

<p>Using the right amount of ginger paste also affects texture and moisture. Too much can make your dish soggy, while too little might leave it bland. For air fryer recipes, where crispiness is often the goal, 15g (0.53 ounces) strikes the right balance. Whether you’re making <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>Asian-inspired dishes</a> or spicing up vegetables, this measurement ensures consistency. Keep a kitchen scale handy for accuracy, or use our quick conversion to avoid mistakes.</p>  

<h3>How to measure 15g of ginger paste without a scale</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a scale, you can still measure 15g of ginger paste (0.53 ounces) using common kitchen tools. A standard teaspoon holds about 5g, so three level teaspoons will give you roughly 15g. Alternatively, a tablespoon can hold around 15g when slightly heaped. For sticky ingredients like ginger paste, lightly oil the spoon first to help it slide off easily. This method isn’t as precise as a scale, but it works in a pinch for most <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable-based recipes</a>.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for 15g of ginger paste in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Ginger paste is a versatile ingredient that shines in air fryer recipes. With 15g (0.53 ounces), you can create flavourful marinades for meats or tofu. Try mixing it with soy sauce, garlic, and a touch of honey for a quick glaze. It’s also perfect for adding depth to stir-fries or <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/shrimp>shrimp dishes</a>, where the air fryer locks in the flavours. For a healthier twist, toss vegetables in ginger paste and a splash of oil before air frying—it’s a game-changer.</p>  

<p>Another great use for 15g of ginger paste is in dipping sauces. Combine it with lime juice, fish sauce, and a pinch of sugar for a tangy accompaniment to spring rolls or dumplings.

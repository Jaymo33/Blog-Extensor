faqQ1: "Is 15g of soy milk the same as 15ml?"
faqA1: "No, 15g and 15ml are not the same for soy milk. Weight (grams) measures mass, while millilitres measure volume. For soy milk, 15g is roughly 14.5ml, but this can vary slightly by brand. Always use a scale for accuracy in air fryer recipes."
faqQ2: "Can I use almond milk instead of soy milk in air fryer recipes?"
faqA2: "Yes, almond milk can substitute soy milk in most air fryer recipes. Use the same weight (15g or 0.53 oz) for best results. Note that almond milk is slightly thinner, so batters may need adjusting. Check our vegan recipes for more alternatives."
faqQ3: "How do I measure 15g of soy milk without scales?"
faqA3: "One level tablespoon is approximately 15g of soy milk, but this isn’t exact. For baking or precise air fryer recipes, we recommend investing in a cheap digital scale. They’re widely available and ensure consistent results every time."
faqQ4: "Why do some recipes use grams and others use ounces for liquids?"
faqA4: "Measurement preferences vary by country – the UK typically uses grams, while the US favours ounces. For air fryer cooking, sticking to one system (and converting when needed) prevents errors. Our conversion chart makes switching between them simple."

<h2>How to Measure 15g of Soy Milk Accurately</h2>  
<p>Using a digital kitchen scale is the easiest way to measure 15g of soy milk. Simply place your container on the scale, tare it to zero, and pour until you hit 15g.

<h3>Using Measuring Spoons for Soy Milk</h3>  
<p>While not as precise as a scale, measuring spoons can work in a pinch. One level tablespoon is close to 15g, but for best results, stick to a scale. For more air fryer-friendly recipes, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipes section</a>.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for 15g of Soy Milk in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Soy milk is a versatile ingredient in air fryer recipes. From light batters for crispy vegetables to creamy dips, 15g (0.53 oz) can be just the right amount.

faqQ1: "Can I use Greek yogurt instead of plain yogurt in air fryer recipes?"
faqA1: "Yes, you can substitute Greek yogurt for plain yogurt, but keep in mind it’s thicker. You may need to thin it with a splash of water or milk to match the consistency of plain yogurt. The conversion remains the same: 100g equals 3.53 oz."
faqQ2: "How do I measure 100g of yogurt if I don’t have a scale?"
faqA2: "You can use measuring cups or spoons as a rough guide. Two heaped tablespoons of yogurt will give you close to 100g (3.53 oz). For more accuracy, consider purchasing a cheap digital scale—it’s a worthwhile investment for precise cooking."
faqQ3: "Does the fat content of yogurt affect the weight-to-ounce conversion?"
faqA3: "No, the fat content doesn’t change the weight-to-ounce conversion. Whether it’s full-fat, low-fat, or fat-free, 100g of plain yogurt will always be approximately 3.53 oz. The difference lies in texture and calorie content, not weight."
faqQ4: "Why is 100g of yogurt a common measurement in air fryer recipes?"
faqA4: "100g is a convenient amount for marinades, dips, or batters—enough to coat ingredients without overwhelming them. It’s also easy to scale up or down. For example, doubling it to 200g (7.05 oz) works well for larger batches."

<p>100g of plain yogurt is approximately 3.53 ounces. This conversion is essential for precise measurements, especially when preparing air fryer recipes that require exact quantities. Whether you're whipping up a creamy dip or a marinade, knowing how to convert grams to ounces ensures your dish turns out perfectly every time.</p>

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on precise cooking times and ingredient ratios to deliver crispy, evenly cooked results. Using the correct amount of yogurt, such as 100g (3.53 oz), can affect the texture and consistency of your dish. For example, a marinade with too much yogurt might become overly thick, while too little could fail to coat your ingredients properly.</p>

faqQ1: "Can I use a tablespoon to measure 5g of plain flour?"
faqA1: "Yes, but it’s less precise. One level tablespoon of plain flour weighs about 7.5g, so 5g would be roughly two-thirds of a tablespoon. For accuracy, especially in air fryer baking, a digital scale is best."
faqQ2: "Why does 5g of plain flour matter in air fryer recipes?"
faqA2: "Small quantities like 5g can affect texture and consistency. Too much flour can make baked goods dry, while too little may cause sogginess. Precise measurements ensure your air fryer dishes turn out perfectly every time."
faqQ3: "How do I convert 5g of plain flour to cups?"
faqA3: "5g of plain flour is roughly 0.04 cups (or 1/25th of a cup). However, cup measurements vary based on how the flour is packed, so weighing is more reliable for air fryer recipes."
faqQ4: "Can I substitute self-raising flour for plain flour in a 5g measurement?"
faqA4: "Yes, but self-raising flour contains baking powder, which may alter the recipe’s rise. For best results in air fryer baking, stick to plain flour unless the recipe specifies otherwise."

<h3>How to Measure 200g of Water Accurately</h3>
<p>To measure 200g of water, use a digital kitchen scale for the most accurate results. Place a measuring jug on the scale, tare it to zero, then pour water until it reaches 200g. If your scale displays ounces, it should read around 7.05 oz. For those without a scale, 200ml of water is roughly equivalent to 200g, as water's density is 1g per ml. This trick works well for most air fryer recipes.</p>

<h2>Common Uses for 200g of Water in Air Frying</h2>
<p>200g of water is often used in air fryer recipes to create steam or thin out mixtures. For example, it can be added to the bottom of the air fryer basket when reheating bread to prevent drying. It's also used in batters for crispy coatings or to loosen thick sauces.

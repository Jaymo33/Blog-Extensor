faqQ1: "Can I use 500g of greek yogurt in place of regular yogurt in air fryer recipes?"
faqA1: "Yes, you can substitute greek yogurt for regular yogurt in most air fryer recipes. Greek yogurt is thicker and higher in protein, so it may alter the texture slightly. For best results, use the same weight (500g or 17.64 ounces) and adjust liquids if needed."
faqQ2: "How do I convert 500g of greek yogurt to cups instead of ounces?"
faqA2: "500g of greek yogurt is roughly 2.1 cups, as one cup equals about 240g. However, measuring by weight (grams or ounces) is more accurate for air fryer recipes. If using cups, spoon the yogurt in gently to avoid compacting it."
faqQ3: "Does 500g of greek yogurt weigh the same as 500g of regular yogurt?"
faqA3: "Yes, 500g is 500g regardless of the yogurt type—the weight doesn’t change. However, greek yogurt is denser, so it will take up less volume than regular yogurt. Always measure by weight for precision in air fryer cooking."
faqQ4: "Can I freeze 500g of greek yogurt for later use in air fryer recipes?"
faqA4: "Yes, you can freeze 500g of greek yogurt, though the texture may become grainy after thawing. It’s best used in cooked dishes like sauces or baked goods rather than fresh applications. Thaw in the fridge overnight before using."

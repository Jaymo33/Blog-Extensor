faqQ1: "Can I use 150g of jam interchangeably with 5.29 oz in recipes?"
faqA1: "Yes, 150g of jam equals 5.29 oz, so they’re interchangeable in recipes. However, for baking or air fryer dishes, weighing with a scale ensures precision, especially with thicker jams. Volume measures (like cups) can vary slightly due to jam density."
faqQ2: "How many calories are in 150g of jam?"
faqA2: "Calories depend on the jam type, but 150g of strawberry jam averages 390 calories. Sugar-free versions may have fewer. For air fryer recipes, consider lighter jams or reducing the quantity if calorie-conscious. Check labels for exact values."
faqQ3: "Does 150g of jam equal 150ml?"
faqA3: "Not exactly. Jam’s density means 150g is roughly 142ml (since 1g of jam ≈ 0.95ml). For air fryer glazes, weight (grams/ounces) is more reliable than volume to avoid over-pouring."
faqQ4: "Can I freeze 150g portions of jam for later use?"
faqA4: "Absolutely! Freeze 150g of jam in airtight containers for up to 3 months. Thaw in the fridge before using in air fryer recipes. Stir well post-thawing, as separation can occur. Avoid freezing in glass jars to prevent cracking."

<h2>Why Convert 150g of Jam to Ounces?</h2>

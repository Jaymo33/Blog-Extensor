faqQ1: "Can I use tablespoons to measure 20g of agave syrup?"
faqA1: "Yes, but it’s less precise. One tablespoon of agave syrup weighs about 20g (0.705 oz), but thickness varies by brand. For baking or air fryer recipes, a scale ensures accuracy."
faqQ2: "Is 20g of agave syrup the same as 20g of honey?"
faqA2: "In weight, yes—both are 0.705 oz. However, honey is denser, so 20g fills slightly less volume. For air fryer glazes, agave’s neutral taste may be preferable."
faqQ3: "How does 20g of agave syrup affect blood sugar compared to sugar?"
faqA3: "Agave syrup has a lower glycemic index than sugar, but 20g (0.705 oz) still contains about 16g of carbs. Use sparingly in <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>air fryer desserts</a> for a healthier option."
faqQ4: "Can I substitute 20g of agave syrup with maple syrup?"
faqA4: "Yes, but adjust for sweetness. Maple syrup is less sweet, so you might need slightly more. In air fryer recipes, both work well for glazes or marinades."

faqQ1: "Is 25g of water the same as 25ml?"
faqA1: "Yes, for water, 25 grams is equivalent to 25 millilitres because water has a density of 1g/ml. This makes measuring easier, especially for air fryer recipes where precision matters."
faqQ2: "Can I use a tablespoon to measure 25g of water?"
faqA2: "One tablespoon holds about 15ml (or 15g) of water, so 25g would be roughly 1.5 tablespoons. However, for accuracy in air fryer cooking, a scale is recommended."
faqQ3: "Why do some recipes use grams and others use ounces?"
faqA3: "Grams are standard in the UK and Europe, while ounces are more common in the US. Air fryer recipes may vary depending on their origin, so knowing conversions like 25g to 0.88 oz is helpful."
faqQ4: "Does the ounce measurement change for other liquids?"
faqA4: "Yes, oils or syrups have different densities, so 25g won’t always equal 0.88 oz. For water, the conversion is straightforward, but check specific densities for other liquids in air fryer recipes."

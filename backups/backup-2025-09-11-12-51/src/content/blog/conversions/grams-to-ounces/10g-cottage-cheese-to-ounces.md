faqQ1: "Can I use 10g of cottage cheese in air-fryer baking?"
faqA1: "Absolutely! 10g (0.35 oz) of cottage cheese adds moisture to air-fryer cakes or muffins. Just blend it smoothly into the batter. It works especially well in protein-packed banana bread or lemon drizzle cakes."
faqQ2: "How does 10g of cottage cheese compare to ricotta in ounces?"
faqA2: "10g of ricotta also equals 0.35 oz, but it’s smoother and less tangy than cottage cheese. In air-fryer recipes, ricotta spreads more evenly, while cottage cheese adds texture. Swap them 1:1 by weight if you prefer."
faqQ3: "Why does my air-fryer recipe specify cottage cheese in grams?"
faqA3: "Grams are more precise for baking, as cottage cheese density varies by brand. 10g (0.35 oz) ensures consistency. UK recipes often use metric measurements, but our conversion makes it easy for any kitchen scale."
faqQ4: "Can I freeze 10g portions of cottage cheese?"
faqA4: "Yes! Freeze 10g (0.35 oz) dollops on a tray before bagging. Thawed cottage cheese is best for cooked dishes like air-fryer pasta bakes. The texture becomes grainier, but the flavour remains intact."

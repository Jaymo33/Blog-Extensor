faqQ1: "Is 40g of milk the same as 40ml?"
faqA1: "Not quite! While 40g of milk is approximately 39ml, the exact volume depends on the milk’s fat content. Whole milk is slightly denser than skimmed milk, but for most recipes, the difference is negligible."
faqQ2: "Can I use plant-based milk instead of cow’s milk for 40g measurements?"
faqA2: "Yes, almond, soy, or oat milk can substitute cow’s milk in the same weight (40g ≈ 1.41 oz). However, plant-based milks may alter texture slightly, so adjust cooking times if needed."
faqQ3: "How do I measure 40g of milk if my scale only shows ounces?"
faqA3: "Set your scale to ounces and measure 1.41 oz for 40g. If your scale lacks decimals, round to 1.4 oz—it won’t significantly impact most recipes."
faqQ4: "Why do some UK recipes use grams instead of ounces for milk?"
faqA4: "Grams are the standard metric unit in the UK, offering greater precision for baking and cooking. Ounces are more common in the US, but conversions ensure compatibility with all recipes."

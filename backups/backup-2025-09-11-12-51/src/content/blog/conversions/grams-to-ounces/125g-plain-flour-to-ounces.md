faqQ1: "Can I use self-raising flour instead of plain flour for 125g to ounces conversion?"
faqA1: "Yes, the weight conversion is the same—125g of self-raising flour also equals 4.41 ounces. However, self-raising flour contains baking powder, so adjust your recipe accordingly to avoid over-rising in the air fryer."
faqQ2: "Why do UK recipes use grams instead of ounces for flour?"
faqA2: "Grams are more precise for baking, as small measurement errors can affect texture. UK recipes often use metric measurements, while ounces are more common in the US. Digital scales make grams easier to work with for air fryer recipes."
faqQ3: "How do I convert 125g of plain flour to cups?"
faqA3: "125g of plain flour is roughly 1 UK cup plus 1 teaspoon. For US cups, it's about 1 cup (120ml). Note that cup measurements can vary, so weighing is more reliable for air fryer baking."
faqQ4: "Does the type of flour affect the 125g to ounces conversion?"
faqA4: "No, the conversion is weight-based, so 125g of any flour (wholemeal, spelt, etc.) equals 4.41 ounces. However, different flours have varying densities, so always spoon them into measuring cups lightly for accuracy."

<h2>Why accurate flour measurements matter</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of flour is crucial for air fryer baking. Too much flour can make your cakes dense, while too little can leave them crumbly. The difference between 125g and 4.41 ounces might seem small, but it can impact texture and rise. Many UK recipes, especially those on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, use grams, so knowing the ounce equivalent helps if your scales only measure in imperial units. This conversion is also handy for following international recipes without hassle.</p>  

<p>Air fryers cook faster than conventional ovens, so precise measurements ensure even baking. If you're making cookies or muffins, 125g of plain flour (4.41 ounces) is a common base for small batches.

<h2>How to measure 125g of plain flour without scales</h2>  
<p>If you don't have digital scales, you can still measure 125g of plain flour using a measuring cup. One UK cup of plain flour weighs about 120g, so 125g is roughly 1 cup plus 1 teaspoon. However, this method isn't as precise as weighing, as flour can settle or be packed differently. For best results, fluff the flour with a fork before scooping and level it off with a knife.</p>  

<h3>Using tablespoons for small adjustments</h3>  
<p>One tablespoon of plain flour weighs around 8g, so 125g would be roughly 15.5 tablespoons. This method works for small adjustments but isn't ideal for large quantities. If you're scaling up a recipe, investing in a digital scale is worth it for accuracy.</p>  

<h2>Common recipes using 125g of plain flour</h2>  
<p>Many air fryer recipes call for 125g of plain flour, including scones, pancakes, and small cakes. This amount is perfect for serving 2–4 people, making it ideal for quick bakes. For example, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>air fryer cake recipes</a> often use this measurement for perfectly portioned treats.</p>

faqQ1: "Can I use 25g of baking powder for air fryer cakes?"
faqA1: "Yes, 25g of baking powder (0.88 oz) works well for most air fryer cake recipes. It provides enough lift for batters without overpowering the flavour. Just ensure even distribution to avoid uneven rising."
faqQ2: "How do I store baking powder to keep it fresh?"
faqA2: "Store baking powder in an airtight container in a cool, dry place. Moisture and heat can reduce its effectiveness, so avoid storing it near the stove or sink. Check the expiry date periodically for best results."
faqQ3: "Is 25g of baking powder the same as 25g of baking soda?"
faqA3: "No, baking powder and baking soda aren’t interchangeable. Baking powder contains acid and soda, while baking soda needs an acidic ingredient to activate. Using the wrong one can ruin your recipe’s texture and taste."
faqQ4: "Why does my air fryer recipe need precise measurements?"
faqA4: "Air fryers cook faster and more intensely than ovens, so exact measurements prevent over- or under-cooking. Too much baking powder can cause batter to overflow, while too little may leave it dense. Precision ensures perfect results every time."

<p>25g of baking powder equals approximately 0.88 ounces. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes, where precise measurements can make or break your dish. Whether you’re whipping up cakes, bread, or even savoury batters, knowing how to convert grams to ounces ensures consistency. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we focus on making cooking simpler with accurate conversions and foolproof recipes.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer baking</h2>  
<p>Baking powder is a leavening agent, and even small discrepancies can affect how your dish rises. Too little, and your cake might turn out dense; too much, and it could collapse. The air fryer’s rapid circulation means ingredients react faster, so precision is key. For example, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer cake recipes</a> rely on exact measurements for perfect results every time.</p>  

<p>Converting 25g of baking powder to ounces (0.88 oz) ensures you’re using the right amount. A digital kitchen scale is the most reliable tool, but if you’re using measuring spoons, check their volume equivalents. Most UK bakers prefer grams, but some older recipes or international guides might use ounces, making this conversion handy.</p>  

<h3>How to measure 25g of baking powder without a scale</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a scale, 25g of baking powder is roughly 5 teaspoons. However, spoon sizes vary, so fluff the powder first and level it off for accuracy. For air fryer recipes, consistency matters—especially in batters or doughs. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a> simplifies these adjustments, so you’ll never second-guess measurements again.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for 25g of baking powder in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>From fluffy scones to crispy tempura, 25g of baking powder (0.88 oz) is a versatile quantity. It’s enough for a medium-sized batch of pancakes or a light batter for <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>air-fried vegetables</a>. Since air fryers cook faster than conventional ovens, the right leavening ensures even texture without over-expansion.</p>  

<p>For savoury dishes, like air-fried onion rings or fish coatings, 25g of baking powder adds lift without altering flavour. Check our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/white-fish>white fish recipes</a> for inspiration.

<h3>Converting other baking ingredients from grams to ounces</h3>  
<p>While 25g of baking powder is 0.88 oz, other ingredients differ. Flour, for instance, is lighter: 25g equals about 0.88 oz by weight, but volume varies. For air fryer baking, always weigh dry ingredients for accuracy.

faqQ1: "Can I use a measuring cup instead of a scale for 125g of treacle?"
faqA1: "Yes, but it’s less precise. A standard UK measuring cup holds about 340g of treacle, so for 125g (4.41 oz), fill just over one-third of the cup. For accuracy, lightly grease the cup first so the treacle slides out cleanly."
faqQ2: "Does treacle weigh the same as golden syrup in ounces?"
faqA2: "Not exactly. While both are thick sweeteners, treacle is slightly denser. 125g of golden syrup equals about 4.23 oz, compared to treacle’s 4.41 oz. Always check your recipe’s requirements for best results."
faqQ3: "How do I clean treacle from my air fryer basket?"
faqA3: "Soak the basket in warm, soapy water to loosen the treacle, then scrub gently with a soft sponge. For stubborn spots, use a baking soda paste. Avoid harsh abrasives that could damage non-stick coatings."
faqQ4: "Can I reduce the treacle in a recipe for less sweetness?"
faqA4: "Yes, but adjust other liquids to maintain texture. For every 25g (0.88 oz) of treacle removed, add 15ml of water or milk. This works well in air fryer cakes or glazes where moisture balance is crucial."

<h2>Why Convert 125g of Treacle to Ounces?</h2>  
<p>Many UK recipes, especially those on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, use grams, but some kitchen scales or older cookbooks might still list ounces. Converting 125g of treacle to ounces (4.41 oz) helps avoid measurement mishaps. Treacle’s thick consistency makes it tricky to measure, so accuracy is key for consistent results in your air fryer dishes.</p>  
<p>If you’re using an air fryer for baking, like making treacle tart or gingerbread, precise measurements matter. A slight imbalance in wet ingredients can affect texture.

<h2>Common Mistakes When Measuring Treacle</h2>  
<p>One mistake is scooping treacle straight from the jar, which often leads to uneven amounts. Instead, pour it slowly into your measuring tool. Another error is forgetting to account for treacle’s weight when substituting it for other sweeteners like golden syrup or honey, which have different densities.</p>

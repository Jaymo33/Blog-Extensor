faqQ1: "How do I convert 25g of chopped onion to ounces without a scale?"
faqA1: "Without a scale, you can estimate that 25g of chopped onion equals roughly ¼ cup. However, for precise measurements in air fryer cooking, investing in a small digital scale is recommended as onion density varies with chop size."
faqQ2: "Does the type of onion affect the weight conversion to ounces?"
faqA2: "While all onion types convert similarly (25g = 0.88 oz), red onions are slightly denser than white or yellow varieties. For air fryer recipes, the difference is minimal, but for absolute precision, weigh your specific chopped onion."
faqQ3: "Can I use this conversion for other chopped vegetables in my air fryer?"
faqA3: "This conversion specifically applies to onions. Other vegetables have different densities, so 25g of carrots or peppers won't equal the same volume in ounces. Always check specific conversion charts for different ingredients."
faqQ4: "Why is precise measurement important for air fryer recipes?"
faqA4: "Air fryers cook quickly with circulating hot air, so ingredient proportions significantly affect results. Too much onion (beyond 25g/0.88 oz) can release excess moisture, preventing proper crisping in your air-fried dishes."

faqQ1: "Is 50g of almond milk the same as 50ml?"
faqA1: "While close, 50g of almond milk is roughly 50ml due to its similar density to water. However, for precise baking or air frying, weight (grams) is more accurate than volume (ml). Always use a scale if the recipe specifies grams."
faqQ2: "Can I use dairy milk instead of almond milk in air fryer recipes?"
faqA2: "Yes, but adjust for slight differences in fat and sugar content. Dairy milk is slightly denser, so 50g equals about 1.7 ounces. The swap works well in most recipes, though flavors may vary slightly."
faqQ3: "How do I measure 50g of almond milk without a scale?"
faqA3: "Use tablespoons: 50g is roughly 3.5 tablespoons. For small amounts, a medicine syringe or graduated measuring cup can help. Note that this method is less precise than weighing."
faqQ4: "Does almond milk weigh less than regular milk?"
faqA4: "Unsweetened almond milk is slightly lighter than whole dairy milk, but the difference is minimal for small amounts like 50g. Both convert to about 1.76 ounces, making them interchangeable in most air fryer recipes."

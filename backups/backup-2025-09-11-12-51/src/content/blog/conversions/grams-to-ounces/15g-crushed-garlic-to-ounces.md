faqQ1: "Can I use minced garlic instead of crushed garlic for 15g?"
faqA1: "Yes, but note that minced garlic is less potent than crushed. Use the same weight (15g or 0.53 oz), but expect a slightly milder flavour. Adjust to taste if your air fryer recipe needs a stronger garlic punch."
faqQ2: "How do I convert 15g of crushed garlic to cups?"
faqA2: "15g of crushed garlic is roughly 1/8 cup. However, cups aren’t ideal for garlic due to density variations. For accuracy, stick to weight measurements (grams or ounces) in air fryer recipes."
faqQ3: "Does 15g of crushed garlic change weight when cooked in an air fryer?"
faqA3: "Yes, cooking reduces moisture, so 15g of crushed garlic will weigh slightly less after air frying. The flavour intensifies, so use sparingly if you’re adapting stovetop recipes to air fryer settings."
faqQ4: "What’s the best way to crush garlic for accurate 15g measurements?"
faqA4: "Use a garlic press or the flat side of a knife to crush cloves. This method ensures uniform texture and accurate weight. For precise 15g portions, a kitchen scale is your best friend."

<p>15g of crushed garlic equals approximately 0.53 ounces. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements can make or break a dish. Whether you're whipping up garlic-infused chicken or roasted vegetables, knowing the exact weight ensures consistent flavour. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we emphasise accuracy to help you achieve restaurant-quality results at home. Let’s dive deeper into why this conversion matters and how to use it effectively.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate garlic measurements matter in air frying</h2>  
<p>Crushed garlic adds a punch of flavour, but too much or too little can throw off your dish. In an air fryer, ingredients cook quickly, so balanced seasoning is key. For example, 15g of crushed garlic (0.53 oz) is ideal for marinades or rubs on proteins like chicken or lamb. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>garlic-infused recipes</a> for inspiration. Precision ensures your meals are flavourful without overpowering other ingredients.</p>  

<p>Garlic’s potency varies based on how it’s prepared—minced, crushed, or powdered. Crushed garlic releases more oils, so 15g packs a stronger punch than minced. If you’re adapting a recipe from grams to ounces, this conversion keeps flavours consistent. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a> simplifies this process for all your cooking needs.</p>  

<h2>How to measure 15g of crushed garlic without scales</h2>  
<p>No kitchen scales? No problem. One medium-sized garlic clove, when crushed, weighs roughly 5g. So, three cloves equal about 15g (0.53 oz). This handy trick works for most recipes, though scales are best for precision. If you’re prepping a larger batch, like garlic butter for potatoes, this method saves time. Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/potatoes>potato recipes</a> for delicious ways to use crushed garlic.</p>  

<h3>Converting other garlic measurements</h3>  
<p>If your recipe calls for tablespoons, 15g of crushed garlic is roughly 3 teaspoons. Remember, air fryers intensify flavours, so adjust to taste.

<h2>Common mistakes when measuring garlic</h2>  
<p>Over-measuring garlic can dominate a dish, especially in air fryers where heat concentrates flavours. Stick to 15g (0.53 oz) unless the recipe specifies otherwise. Another mistake? Using jarred crushed garlic instead of fresh—it often contains preservatives that alter taste. For the best results, crush fresh cloves and measure accurately.</p>  

<p>Storing leftover crushed garlic? Mix it with olive oil and freeze in ice cube trays. Each cube (about 15g) is ready for your next air fryer adventure. Discover more storage hacks in our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/meal-prep>meal prep section</a>.</p>

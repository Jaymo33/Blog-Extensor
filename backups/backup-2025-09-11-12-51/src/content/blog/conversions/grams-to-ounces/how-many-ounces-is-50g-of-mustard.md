faqQ1: "Can I use American mustard for the 50g to ounces conversion?"
faqA1: "Yes, American mustard (yellow mustard) works for this conversion, as 50g equals roughly 1.76 ounces regardless of type. However, Dijon or wholegrain mustard may vary slightly in density, so weighing is best for accuracy."
faqQ2: "How many teaspoons are in 50g of mustard?"
faqA2: "50g of mustard is approximately 10-11 teaspoons, but this can vary based on thickness. For precise air fryer recipes, using a scale is recommended to avoid inconsistencies."
faqQ3: "Does 50g of mustard change weight when cooked in an air fryer?"
faqA3: "Mustard loses minimal weight when cooked, as most of its mass is liquid. However, reducing it into a glaze may thicken it, concentrating the flavor without significantly altering the ounce measurement."
faqQ4: "Can I substitute mustard powder for 50g of prepared mustard?"
faqA4: "Yes, but you'll need to mix mustard powder with water or vinegar to match the consistency. Use about 15g of mustard powder plus liquid to equal 50g (1.76 oz) of prepared mustard. Adjust to taste for your air fryer recipe."

<h2>Why Convert 50g of Mustard to Ounces?</h2>  
<p>Many UK recipes use grams, while others rely on ounces, especially older cookbooks or international guides. Converting 50g of mustard to ounces (1.76 oz) helps maintain accuracy in your cooking.

<h3>How to Measure 50g of Mustard Accurately</h3>  
<p>Using a digital kitchen scale is the easiest way to measure 50g of mustard. If you don't have one, tablespoons can work in a pinchâ€”roughly 3.5 tablespoons of mustard equal 50g. However, weights can vary slightly depending on the mustard's thickness. For air fryer recipes, consistency is key, so a scale is best.

faqQ1: "Can I use cups instead of ounces to measure 125g of Nutella?"
faqA1: "While possible, cups aren’t ideal for measuring 125g of Nutella (about 4.41 oz) due to its thick texture. A standard US cup holds roughly 280g of Nutella, but this varies based on how tightly it’s packed. For air fryer recipes, weighing Nutella ensures accuracy."
faqQ2: "Why does my air fryer Nutella dessert turn out too runny?"
faqA2: "If your dessert is runny, you might have used too much Nutella. 125g (4.41 oz) is perfect for most recipes, but exceeding this can affect texture. Also, ensure your air fryer is preheated and avoid overcrowding the basket for even cooking."
faqQ3: "How do I store leftover Nutella after measuring 125g?"
faqA3: "After measuring 125g (4.41 oz), seal the Nutella jar tightly and store it in a cool, dry place. Avoid refrigeration, as it hardens the spread. Stir well before next use if oil separation occurs."
faqQ4: "Can I substitute other chocolate spreads for 125g of Nutella in air fryer recipes?"
faqA4: "Yes, you can swap Nutella for other chocolate spreads in a 1:1 ratio by weight (125g = 4.41 oz). However, check the sugar content, as some brands are sweeter. Adjust baking times slightly if the substitute is thinner or thicker than Nutella."

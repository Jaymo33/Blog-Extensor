faqQ1: "Why is 100g of almond butter not exactly 3.5 ounces?"
faqA1: "The conversion isn’t perfectly rounded because 1 ounce equals 28.35 grams. So, 100g ÷ 28.35 ≈ 3.53 oz. Small variations can occur due to almond butter’s density or brand differences."
faqQ2: "Can I use peanut butter instead of almond butter in recipes?"
faqA2: "Yes, but peanut butter has a stronger flavour and slightly different texture. Use the same weight (100g or 3.53 oz) and adjust sweetness or saltiness to taste."
faqQ3: "How many calories are in 100g of almond butter?"
faqA3: "100g of almond butter contains roughly 614 calories, mostly from healthy fats and protein. It’s nutrient-dense, so portion control is key for balanced meals."
faqQ4: "Is almond butter better for air frying than regular butter?"
faqA4: "Almond butter adds a nutty flavour and works well in coatings or glazes, but it burns faster than dairy butter. Use lower temperatures (around 160°C) and check frequently."

<h2>Why Convert 100g of Almond Butter to Ounces?</h2>

Converting 100g of almond butter to ounces (3.53 oz) ensures accuracy, particularly in air fryer cooking where ingredient ratios affect texture and taste. Almond butter’s density means slight measurement errors can alter a dish’s consistency. For example, too much almond butter in energy balls might make them overly sticky.

<h3>Storing Almond Butter for Freshness</h3>  
<p>After measuring 100g of almond butter, store the rest in a cool, dark place to prevent oil separation. Natural almond butter may require stirring before each use. For longer shelf life, refrigerate it—just note that chilled almond butter thickens, so adjust measurements if using it straight from the fridge.</p>

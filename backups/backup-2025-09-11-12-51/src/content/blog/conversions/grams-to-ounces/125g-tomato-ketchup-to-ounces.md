<h2>Why convert 125g of tomato ketchup to ounces?</h2>  
<p>Many UK recipes use grams, while others rely on ounces, especially for sauces like tomato ketchup. Converting 125g to ounces (4.41 oz) ensures consistency, whether you’re marinating chicken or glazing sausages in your air fryer. Precision matters—too much ketchup can overpower a dish, while too little might leave it bland.

<p>Tomato ketchup is a staple in many air fryer recipes, from sticky ribs to homemade burgers. Knowing that 125g equals 4.41 ounces helps when scaling recipes up or down.

<h3>Does the brand of tomato ketchup affect the weight?</h3>  
<p>Most tomato ketchups have a similar density, so 125g will roughly equal 4.41 ounces across brands. However, thicker or premium ketchups might vary slightly. If precision is crucial, like in baking or marinades, stick to weighing rather than volume measurements. For everyday air fryer cooking, a small variance won’t make a noticeable difference.</p>

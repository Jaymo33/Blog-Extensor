faqQ1: "Can I use minced garlic instead of garlic paste in air fryer recipes?"
faqA1: "Yes, you can substitute minced garlic for garlic paste, but the texture and intensity will differ. Minced garlic is less concentrated, so you may need to adjust the quantity. For 100g of garlic paste, use about 120g of minced garlic for a similar flavour profile."
faqQ2: "How long does 100g of garlic paste last in the fridge?"
faqA2: "When stored properly in an airtight container, 100g of garlic paste lasts up to two weeks in the fridge. For longer storage, freeze it in portions. Always check for off smells or discolouration before use to ensure freshness."
faqQ3: "Is 100g of garlic paste the same as 100g of fresh garlic?"
faqA3: "No, 100g of garlic paste is more concentrated than fresh garlic due to its blended texture. Fresh garlic would yield less paste when processed. For recipes, stick to the specified form (paste or fresh) for accurate flavour results."
faqQ4: "Can I make garlic paste at home for air fryer recipes?"
faqA4: "Absolutely! Blend peeled garlic cloves with a bit of oil or water until smooth. Homemade garlic paste lets you control the texture and freshness. Store it in the fridge or freezer, and use it in place of shop-bought paste for your air fryer dishes."

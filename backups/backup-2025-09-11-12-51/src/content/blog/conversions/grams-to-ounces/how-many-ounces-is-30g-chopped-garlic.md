faqQ1: "How do I convert 30g of chopped garlic to ounces without a scale?"
faqA1: "If you don't have a scale, 30g of chopped garlic is roughly 6 teaspoons or 2 tablespoons. Keep in mind that finely minced garlic will pack more densely, so spoon it lightly into your measuring spoon for accuracy."
faqQ2: "Does 30g of chopped garlic taste stronger in an air fryer?"
faqA2: "Yes, air fryers intensify flavours due to rapid hot air circulation. 30g (1.06 oz) of chopped garlic will taste more pronounced in an air fryer compared to oven cooking. Adjust the amount slightly if you prefer a milder garlic flavour."
faqQ3: "Can I use jarred minced garlic instead of fresh for 30g?"
faqA3: "Yes, but jarred minced garlic is less potent than fresh. Use the same weight (30g or 1.06 oz), but expect a slightly milder taste. Fresh garlic also offers better texture and aroma for air fryer dishes."
faqQ4: "How long does 30g of chopped garlic last in the fridge?"
faqA4: "Freshly chopped garlic stored in an airtight container will last up to a week in the fridge. For longer storage, freeze it in ice cube trays with a bit of oil. Thaw as needed for air fryer recipes."

<h2>Why accurate garlic measurements matter</h2>  
<p>Garlic is a powerhouse ingredient that can elevate any dish, but too much or too little can throw off the balance. In an air fryer, where flavours intensify due to rapid cooking, precise amounts are crucial. For example, 30g of chopped garlic (1.06 oz) is perfect for a batch of garlic bread or roasted vegetables. If you're unsure, always measure rather than eyeball itâ€”especially when trying new recipes from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>our collection</a>.</p>  

<p>Chopped garlic also varies in density depending on how finely it's minced. A coarse chop may take up more space but weigh the same as finely minced garlic. This is why weight (grams or ounces) is more reliable than volume (teaspoons or tablespoons). For air fryer cooking, consistency ensures even flavour distribution and prevents overpowering your dish.</p>  

<h3>Converting grams to ounces for air fryer recipes</h3>  
<p>Converting 30g of chopped garlic to ounces is straightforward: 1 gram equals roughly 0.035 ounces, so 30g x 0.035 = 1.06 oz. This conversion applies to most ingredients, making it a handy rule for air fryer cooking. If you're scaling up a recipe, simply multiply the grams by 0.035 to get the equivalent in ounces. For example, 60g of chopped garlic would be 2.12 oz.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for 30g of chopped garlic</h2>  
<p>30g (1.06 oz) of chopped garlic is a versatile amount for many air fryer dishes. It's enough to season a whole chicken, infuse oil for roasted potatoes, or add depth to a vegetable stir-fry. If you're meal prepping, this quantity works well for marinades or sauces stored in the fridge.

<p>Garlic also pairs beautifully with other ingredients in the air fryer. Try combining 30g of chopped garlic with olive oil and herbs for a simple yet flavourful coating. Whether you're cooking proteins or vegetables, this amount ensures a balanced taste without overwhelming the dish.

<h3>Tips for measuring chopped garlic</h3>  
<p>To measure 30g of chopped garlic accurately, use a digital kitchen scale for precision. If you don't have one, roughly 6 teaspoons of finely chopped garlic equate to 30g (1.06 oz). Remember that fresh garlic packs more punch than pre-minced jarred versions, so adjust accordingly. Store unused chopped garlic in an airtight container in the fridge for up to a week.</p>

faqQ1: "Can I use cups instead of grams or ounces for measuring oats?"
faqA1: "Yes, but it’s less precise. Roughly, 50g of oats equals about half a cup. However, weighing your oats ensures accuracy, especially for baking. A digital kitchen scale is the best tool for consistent results."
faqQ2: "Do different oat types (rolled, steel-cut) weigh the same for 50g?"
faqA2: "Yes, 50g is always 50g, regardless of oat type. However, steel-cut oats are denser, so they take up less volume than rolled oats. For the most accurate measurement, always weigh your oats."
faqQ3: "Why do air fryer recipes sometimes use grams and other times ounces?"
faqA3: "Recipes vary by region—UK recipes often use grams, while US recipes may use ounces. Converting 50g of oats to ounces (1.76 oz) helps you follow any recipe seamlessly. A conversion chart can be handy for quick reference."
faqQ4: "How do I measure 50g of oats without a scale?"
faqA4: "You can estimate using measuring cups—50g is roughly half a cup of oats. For better accuracy, fluff the oats before spooning them into the cup and leveling off. However, a scale is the most reliable method."

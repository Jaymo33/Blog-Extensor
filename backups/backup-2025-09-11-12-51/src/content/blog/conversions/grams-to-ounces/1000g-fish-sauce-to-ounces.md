faqQ1: "Can I use a measuring cup instead of a scale for 1000g of fish sauce?"
faqA1: "While a scale is more accurate, you can use a measuring cup in a pinch. Since fish sauce has a similar density to water, 1000g roughly equals 1 litre or 4.23 cups. However, for precise air fryer recipes, weighing is best."
faqQ2: "Does fish sauce weight change if it’s refrigerated?"
faqA2: "No, the weight remains the same, but viscosity may thicken slightly when cold. Let it reach room temperature before measuring for consistent results in your air fryer dishes."
faqQ3: "How long does 1000g of fish sauce last once opened?"
faqA3: "An opened bottle lasts 6–12 months if refrigerated. Check for off smells or discoloration before use. For recipes like air-fried spring rolls, fresh fish sauce ensures the best flavour."
faqQ4: "Are there low-sodium alternatives that weigh the same?"
faqA4: "Yes, reduced-sodium fish sauce has a similar weight (1000g = 35.27 oz) but may require adjusting seasonings. Taste as you go when adapting air fryer recipes."

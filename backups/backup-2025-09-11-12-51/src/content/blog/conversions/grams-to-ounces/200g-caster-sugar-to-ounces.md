faqQ1: "Can I use granulated sugar instead of caster sugar for 200g in air fryer recipes?"
faqA1: "Yes, you can substitute granulated sugar for caster sugar, but the texture may differ slightly. Caster sugar dissolves faster, making it ideal for light bakes like sponges. Granulated sugar works well in cookies or crumbles where a bit of crunch is desired."
faqQ2: "How do I measure 200g of caster sugar if I don’t have a scale?"
faqA2: "One cup of caster sugar is roughly 200g, but for accuracy, fluff the sugar before spooning it into the cup. Avoid packing it down. For best results, especially in air fryer baking, a digital scale is recommended."
faqQ3: "Does 200g of caster sugar equal 200ml?"
faqA3: "No, grams measure weight, while millilitres measure volume. Caster sugar’s density means 200g takes up less space than 200ml. Always weigh sugar for air fryer recipes to ensure precision."
faqQ4: "Why is my air fryer bake too sweet with 200g of caster sugar?"
faqA4: "If your bake is overly sweet, you may need to reduce the sugar slightly or balance it with more acidic ingredients like lemon juice. Air fryers cook quickly, so flavours can intensify—adjust to taste."

<h2>Why accurate sugar measurements matter</h2>  
<p>Using the correct amount of caster sugar is crucial for achieving the right texture and sweetness in your air fryer bakes. Too much sugar can make desserts overly sweet or cause them to brown too quickly, while too little can result in a bland taste.

Converting 200g of caster sugar to ounces (7.05 oz) helps you stay on track.</p>  

<p>Many UK bakers prefer using grams, but some older recipes or international guides might list ingredients in ounces. Knowing how to switch between the two ensures you never miss a beat.

<h3>How to measure 200g of caster sugar without scales</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a kitchen scale, you can still measure 200g of caster sugar using measuring cups. One cup of caster sugar typically weighs around 200g, but this can vary slightly depending on how tightly packed it is. For the most accurate results, we recommend investing in a digital scale—especially if you bake often in your air fryer. A small discrepancy in sugar weight can affect the outcome of delicate desserts like meringues or soufflés.</p>

<h3>Storing caster sugar for air fryer baking</h3>  
<p>To keep your caster sugar fresh and ready for air fryer recipes, store it in an airtight container in a cool, dry place. Humidity can cause sugar to clump, making it harder to measure accurately.

Proper storage ensures your 200g (7.05 oz) measurements remain consistent every time you bake.</p>

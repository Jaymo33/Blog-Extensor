faqQ1: "How can I measure 10g of balsamic vinegar without scales?"
faqA1: "You can approximate 10g of balsamic vinegar using measuring spoons - it's roughly 2 teaspoons. However, for the most accurate measurement, especially in air fryer cooking where precision matters, investing in digital kitchen scales is recommended. The viscosity of balsamic vinegar means volume measurements aren't as precise as weight."
faqQ2: "Does the type of balsamic vinegar affect the 10g to ounces conversion?"
faqA2: "No, the conversion from 10g to ounces (0.35 oz) remains the same regardless of balsamic vinegar type. However, thicker, aged balsamic vinegars may measure slightly differently by volume due to their viscosity. For consistent results in air fryer recipes, always measure by weight when possible."
faqQ3: "Can I use this 10g to ounces conversion for other vinegars in air fryer recipes?"
faqA3: "Yes, the 10g to 0.35 ounces conversion works for all vinegars as they have similar densities. However, other vinegars may have different flavour intensities, so you might need to adjust quantities in recipes. Always taste and adjust when substituting vinegars in air fryer cooking."
faqQ4: "Why is measuring 10g of balsamic vinegar important for air fryer cooking?"
faqA4: "Precise measurements like 10g (0.35 oz) of balsamic vinegar are crucial in air fryer cooking because the rapid cooking process intensifies flavours. Too much vinegar can overpower a dish, while too little might not provide enough flavour. Accurate measurements ensure consistent, delicious results every time you use your air fryer."

<h2>Converting other common air fryer ingredients</h2>

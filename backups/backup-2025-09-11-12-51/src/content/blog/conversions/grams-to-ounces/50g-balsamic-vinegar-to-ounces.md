faqQ1: "Can I use a different vinegar if I don’t have balsamic vinegar?"
faqA1: "While you can substitute other vinegars, balsamic vinegar has a unique sweet-tart flavour. For 50g (1.76 oz), you could try red wine vinegar mixed with a bit of sugar, but the taste won’t be identical. It’s best for recipes where balsamic is the star."
faqQ2: "How do I measure 50g of balsamic vinegar without scales?"
faqA2: "Use tablespoons or teaspoons: 3.5 tablespoons or 10 teaspoons roughly equals 50g (1.76 oz). A measuring cup can also work—just under 1/4 cup will give you the right amount for most air fryer recipes."
faqQ3: "Does the type of balsamic vinegar affect the weight?"
faqA3: "All balsamic vinegars have similar densities, so 50g (1.76 oz) will be the same volume regardless of quality. However, thicker, aged balsamic may coat ingredients differently in air fryer recipes."
faqQ4: "Can I reduce 50g of balsamic vinegar for a thicker glaze?"
faqA4: "Absolutely! Simmering 50g (1.76 oz) of balsamic vinegar reduces it to a syrupy glaze perfect for air fryer dishes. Just keep an eye on it—it thickens quickly and can burn if left too long."

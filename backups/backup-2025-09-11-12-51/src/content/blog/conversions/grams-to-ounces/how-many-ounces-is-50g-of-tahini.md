faqQ1: "Can I use volume measurements (cups) instead of weight for tahini?"
faqA1: "While you can use volume measurements like cups or tablespoons for tahini, weight (grams or ounces) is more accurate. Tahini’s thickness varies, so a cup measurement might not be consistent. For best results, especially in air fryer recipes, a kitchen scale is ideal."
faqQ2: "Does tahini’s brand affect the weight-to-volume conversion?"
faqA2: "Yes, different brands of tahini can have slightly different consistencies due to oil separation or added ingredients. Always stir tahini well before measuring to ensure uniformity. For precise results, stick to weight measurements whenever possible."
faqQ3: "How should I store tahini after opening?"
faqA3: "Store tahini in an airtight container in the fridge to prevent oil separation and extend its shelf life. Stir well before each use, as natural separation is normal. Proper storage keeps it fresh for up to six months."
faqQ4: "Can I substitute tahini with another ingredient in air fryer recipes?"
faqA4: "If you’re out of tahini, you can use smooth peanut butter or almond butter as a substitute, though the flavour will differ slightly. For a nut-free option, sunflower seed butter works well. Adjust seasonings to balance the taste."

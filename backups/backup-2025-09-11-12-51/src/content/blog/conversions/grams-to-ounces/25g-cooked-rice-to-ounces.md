faqQ1: "Can I use 25g of uncooked rice instead of cooked rice in air fryer recipes?"
faqA1: "No, 25g of uncooked rice yields about 75g of cooked rice after absorption. The measurements aren't interchangeable. Always use cooked rice weights (25g = 0.88 oz) in air fryer recipes unless specified otherwise."
faqQ2: "How many calories are in 25g of cooked rice?"
faqA2: "There are approximately 32-35 calories in 25g (0.88 oz) of cooked white rice. Brown rice has slightly more nutrients but similar calorie content. This makes it a great portion-controlled addition to air fryer meals."
faqQ3: "Why does my air fryer dry out small rice portions?"
faqA3: "The air fryer's circulating air can quickly dehydrate small rice amounts. To prevent this, add a teaspoon of water when reheating 25g portions and cover with foil. Heating for shorter intervals also helps retain moisture."
faqQ4: "Can I freeze 25g portions of cooked rice for air fryer use later?"
faqA4: "Absolutely! Freeze 25g (0.88 oz) portions in airtight bags for up to 3 months. When ready to use, thaw overnight in the fridge before reheating in your air fryer. This works perfectly for quick meal prep solutions."

<p>25g of cooked rice equals approximately 0.88 ounces. This conversion is handy when preparing air fryer meals, especially for portion control or following UK recipes. Whether you're meal prepping or cooking a quick side dish, knowing how to convert grams to ounces ensures accuracy in your air fryer recipes.</p>  

<h2>Why convert 25g of cooked rice to ounces?</h2>  
<p>Many UK air fryer recipes use grams, but some kitchen scales or older cookbooks may still reference ounces. Converting 25g of cooked rice to ounces (0.88 oz) helps maintain consistency, especially when preparing dishes like fried rice or grain bowls in your air fryer. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we recommend using digital scales for the most precise measurements when working with smaller quantities like 25g.</p>  

<p>Cooked rice expands significantly compared to its dry weight, so 25g represents a modest portion. This amount works well for single servings in air fryer recipes, such as stuffed peppers or rice cakes. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for other common measurement conversions you might need while cooking.</p>  

<h3>How to measure 25g of cooked rice without scales</h3>  
<p>If you don't have kitchen scales, 25g of cooked rice is roughly two heaped tablespoons. The exact volume can vary slightly depending on the rice variety - long grain tends to be less dense than short grain. For air fryer recipes requiring precise amounts, we always recommend weighing for best results.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for 25g of cooked rice in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>This small portion of rice (0.88 ounces) is perfect for several air fryer applications. It's ideal for stuffing vegetables like peppers or tomatoes, making individual rice cakes, or adding to <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable-based air fryer recipes</a>. The compact size ensures even cooking in the air fryer basket without overcrowding.</p>  

<p>When working with 25g portions of cooked rice in your air fryer, spread it thinly for crisping or mix it thoroughly with other ingredients for even heating. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipe collection</a> includes several dishes that use small rice quantities creatively, from crispy rice balls to grain-stuffed mushrooms.</p>  

<h3>Does rice type affect the ounce conversion?</h3>  
<p>While 25g always equals 0.88 ounces regardless of rice variety, different types of cooked rice have slightly different densities. Brown rice tends to be heavier per cup than white rice, but the gram-to-ounce conversion remains constant. For air fryer cooking, this consistency makes portioning straightforward.</p>  

<h2>Storing and reheating 25g portions of cooked rice</h2>  
<p>When meal prepping with 25g (0.88 oz) portions of cooked rice for air fryer use, proper storage is key. Portion the rice into small containers or bags, label with weights, and refrigerate for up to 3 days. Our guide on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>keeping your air fryer clean</a> includes tips for handling rice without creating mess.</p>  

<p>To reheat 25g of cooked rice in your air fryer, sprinkle with a few drops of water and heat at 160Â°C for 2-3 minutes. This small quantity warms through quickly without drying out. For best results, fluff the rice halfway through heating to ensure even temperature distribution.</p>  

<h3>Adjusting air fryer recipes for 25g rice portions</h3>  
<p>When a recipe calls for a different amount of cooked rice, you can easily scale up or down from our 25g (0.88 oz) baseline. For example, doubling the portion to 50g would be 1.76 ounces. This flexibility makes it simple to adapt recipes from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/meal-prep>meal prep dishes</a> to single servings in your air fryer.</p>

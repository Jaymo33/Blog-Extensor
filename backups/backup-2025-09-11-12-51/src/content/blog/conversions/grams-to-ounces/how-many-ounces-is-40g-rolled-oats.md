faqQ1: "Can I use quick oats instead of rolled oats for 40g measurements?"
faqA1: "Yes, you can substitute quick oats for rolled oats in most recipes. However, quick oats absorb liquid faster, so textures may vary slightly. For air fryer recipes, rolled oats provide better crunch, but quick oats work in a pinch."
faqQ2: "How do I store rolled oats to keep them fresh for air fryer recipes?"
faqA2: "Store rolled oats in an airtight container in a cool, dark place. This prevents them from going stale or absorbing moisture. Properly stored oats stay fresh for months, ensuring your 40g measurements are always spot-on for air fryer cooking."
faqQ3: "Why do some air fryer recipes specify weight (grams) over volume (cups)?"
faqA3: "Weight measurements are more accurate than volume, especially for ingredients like rolled oats. A packed cup can weigh more than a loosely filled one, affecting recipe outcomes. Using grams (like 40g) ensures consistency in air fryer cooking."
faqQ4: "Can I use 40g of rolled oats for gluten-free air fryer recipes?"
faqA4: "Yes, but ensure your oats are certified gluten-free to avoid cross-contamination. Many brands offer gluten-free rolled oats, perfect for air fryer recipes. Always check labels if dietary restrictions apply."

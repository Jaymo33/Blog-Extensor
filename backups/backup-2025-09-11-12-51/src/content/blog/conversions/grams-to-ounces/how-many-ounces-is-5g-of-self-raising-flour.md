faqQ1: "Can I use plain flour instead of self-raising flour for 5g measurements?"
faqA1: "Yes, but you’ll need to add baking powder. For every 5g of plain flour, mix in ¼ teaspoon of baking powder to mimic self-raising flour. This ensures your air fryer bakes rise properly."
faqQ2: "Why does my air fryer bake turn out dense when using self-raising flour?"
faqA2: "Dense results often come from over-measuring flour or not preheating the air fryer. Ensure you’ve converted 5g to 0.18 oz accurately and fluff the flour before measuring. Check your air fryer’s temperature settings too."
faqQ3: "How do I store self-raising flour to keep it fresh?"
faqA3: "Store self-raising flour in an airtight container in a cool, dry place. The baking powder in it can lose potency over time, so use it within 6 months for best results in air fryer recipes."
faqQ4: "Can I double a recipe that uses 5g of self-raising flour?"
faqA4: "Absolutely! Double 5g to 10g (0.35 oz) and adjust other ingredients proportionally. Just ensure your air fryer basket isn’t overcrowded to allow even cooking. For scaled recipes, visit our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipes page</a>."

<h2>Why Accurate Flour Measurements Matter</h2>
<p>Baking is a science, and even small discrepancies in flour measurements can affect texture and rise. Self-raising flour contains baking powder, so precision is key. If you're using an air fryer, uneven measurements can lead to dry or dense results. That’s why converting 5g of self-raising flour to ounces (0.18 oz) ensures consistency.

<p>Many UK recipes use grams, but if your scales only measure ounces, knowing this conversion is a lifesaver. Whether you're making scones or muffins, 5g of self-raising flour is a common small measurement.

<h2>How to Measure 5g of Self-Raising Flour Without Scales</h2>
<p>Don’t have digital scales? No problem! A teaspoon of self-raising flour weighs roughly 3g, so 5g is just under two level teaspoons. For accuracy, fluff the flour first and spoon it lightly into the measuring spoon. Avoid packing it down, as this can lead to over-measuring. If you’re baking in an air fryer, slight variations can impact cooking time, so precision matters.</p>

<h3>Converting Larger Quantities of Self-Raising Flour</h3>
<p>Need to scale up? Here’s a quick reference: 10g of self-raising flour equals 0.35 oz, and 100g equals 3.53 oz.

<h2>Common Mistakes When Measuring Flour</h2>
<p>Scooping flour directly from the bag compacts it, leading to excess. Instead, use the spoon-and-level method for accuracy. Another mistake is ignoring the difference between self-raising and plain flour—they’re not interchangeable without adjustments.

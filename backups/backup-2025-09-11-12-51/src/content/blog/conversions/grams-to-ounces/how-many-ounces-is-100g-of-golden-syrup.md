faqQ1: "Can I use honey instead of golden syrup in air fryer recipes?"
faqA1: "Yes, honey can substitute golden syrup in most recipes, but it has a stronger flavour and slightly different viscosity. Use a 1:1 ratio, but expect a subtle taste variation. For best results, check our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe guides</a> for adjustments."
faqQ2: "Why is my golden syrup measurement inconsistent?"
faqA2: "Golden syrup's thickness can lead to uneven measuring. Always level off your spoon or cup, or use a scale for accuracy. Sticky residues on utensils may also skew results, so clean them thoroughly between uses."
faqQ3: "How do I convert ounces back to grams for golden syrup?"
faqA3: "Multiply the ounces by 28.35 to get grams. For example, 3.53 ounces x 28.35 = 100g. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a> simplifies this for all common ingredients."
faqQ4: "Does golden syrup behave differently in an air fryer versus an oven?"
faqA4: "Yes, air fryers cook faster and circulate heat more intensely, which can cause syrupy glazes to caramelise quicker. Reduce cooking time slightly and monitor closely to prevent burning.

<p>100g of golden syrup equals approximately 3.53 ounces. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes, where precise measurements can make or break your dish. Whether you're making sticky toffee pudding or glazing roasted vegetables, knowing the exact weight ensures consistency.

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer recipes</h2>  
<p>Golden syrup is a staple in many British desserts and sauces, and its thick consistency means even small weight variations can affect texture. In an air fryer, where heat distribution is rapid, precise measurements prevent overcooking or uneven results. For example, adding too much syrup to a cake batter can make it overly dense. Conversely, too little might leave your glaze lacking sweetness. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more handy measurement tips.</p>  

<p>Many air fryer recipes, especially those for cakes or glazes, rely on golden syrup for moisture and flavour.

Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipes section</a> includes plenty of ideas where golden syrup plays a starring role, from flapjacks to marinades.</p>

<h3>Common uses for golden syrup in air fryer cooking</h3>

<h3>Tips for storing golden syrup</h3>

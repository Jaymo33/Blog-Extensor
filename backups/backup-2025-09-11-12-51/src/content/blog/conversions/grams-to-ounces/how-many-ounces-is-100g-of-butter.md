faqQ1: "Can I use margarine instead of butter for 100g in air fryer recipes?"
faqA1: "Yes, you can substitute margarine for butter in most air fryer recipes. However, margarine has a higher water content, which may affect texture. For baking, butter is preferable as it provides better flavour and structure."
faqQ2: "How do I measure 100g of butter if I don't have scales?"
faqA2: "You can use tablespoons â€“ roughly 7 tablespoons equal 100g of butter. Alternatively, most UK butter blocks have markings on the wrapper indicating 25g segments, so 100g would be 4 segments."
faqQ3: "Why does butter sometimes smoke in my air fryer?"
faqA3: "Butter can smoke if it drips onto the heating element or if the temperature is too high. To prevent this, use liners or cook at a slightly lower temperature. Clarified butter is also a good option as it has a higher smoke point."
faqQ4: "Is 100g of butter the same as 100ml?"
faqA4: "No, grams measure weight while millilitres measure volume. 100g of butter is approximately 109ml, as butter is less dense than water. Always weigh butter for accuracy in air fryer recipes."

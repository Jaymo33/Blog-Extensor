faqQ1: "Can I use 75g of vegetable oil for all air fryer recipes?"
faqA1: "75g of vegetable oil (2.65 oz) works well for most air fryer recipes, but some dishes require less or none. For example, lean proteins like chicken breasts may need just a light spray, while starchy foods like potatoes benefit from a full 75g coating. Always check your recipe for specific guidelines."
faqQ2: "How do I convert 75g of vegetable oil to cups?"
faqA2: "75g of vegetable oil is roughly 1/3 cup. However, measuring by weight (grams or ounces) is more accurate than volume (cups) for air fryer cooking. If your recipe calls for cups, use a liquid measuring cup and fill it to the 1/3 mark for best results."
faqQ3: "Is 75g of vegetable oil too much for an air fryer?"
faqA3: "Not necessarily. While air fryers use less oil than deep fryers, 75g (2.65 oz) is suitable for coating larger batches or starch-heavy foods. For smaller portions or leaner ingredients, you can reduce the amount. The key is even distribution to prevent excess oil buildup."
faqQ4: "Can I substitute other oils for 75g of vegetable oil in air fryer recipes?"
faqA4: "Yes! Olive oil, coconut oil, or avocado oil can replace vegetable oil in equal amounts (75g or 2.65 oz). Just note that each oil has a different smoke point, which may affect cooking temperature. For high-heat air frying, vegetable or avocado oil is often the best choice."

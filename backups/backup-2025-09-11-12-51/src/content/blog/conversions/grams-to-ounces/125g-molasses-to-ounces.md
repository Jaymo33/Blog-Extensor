faqQ1: "Can I use a tablespoon to measure 125g of molasses?"
faqA1: "While possible, tablespoons measure volume, not weight, leading to inaccuracies. One UK tablespoon holds about 20g of molasses, so 125g would be roughly 6 tablespoons. However, weighing with scales is far more reliable for air fryer recipes."
faqQ2: "Does molasses weight change if it’s cold or warm?"
faqA2: "Temperature affects molasses’ viscosity but not its weight. 125g of cold molasses will be thicker and harder to pour, but it still equals 4.41 ounces. Warming it slightly can make measuring easier without altering the conversion."
faqQ3: "Why do some recipes list molasses in grams and others in ounces?"
faqA3: "Recipes may use grams (metric) or ounces (imperial) depending on origin. UK recipes often favour grams, while older cookbooks might use ounces. Always check which system your recipe uses—our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a> simplifies swaps."
faqQ4: "How long does 125g of molasses last in an opened jar?"
faqA4: "Opened molasses keeps for up to a year if stored airtight in a cool, dark place. Its high sugar content acts as a preservative. For best results in air fryer recipes, ensure it hasn’t crystallised or developed off-flavours before use."

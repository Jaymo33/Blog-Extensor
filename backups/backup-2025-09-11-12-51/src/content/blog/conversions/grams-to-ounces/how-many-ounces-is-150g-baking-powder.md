faqQ1: "Can I use 150g of baking powder for air fryer fried chicken?"
faqA1: "Yes, but 150g is typically too much for a single batch. Most fried chicken coatings use 1-2 tablespoons (about 10-20g) of baking powder for crispiness. Adjust proportions based on your recipe, and check our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipes</a> for guidance."
faqQ2: "How do I store 150g of baking powder to keep it fresh?"
faqA2: "Store baking powder in a cool, dry place, sealed tightly. Moisture and heat degrade its potency. If your 150g batch clumps or fails the bubble test (mix with hot water), it’s time to replace it."
faqQ3: "Is 150g of baking powder the same as 150g of baking soda?"
faqA3: "No! Baking powder and soda are different. Baking powder contains acid and works alone, while soda needs an acidic ingredient (like yogurt) to activate. Using 150g of soda instead of powder would ruin your recipe."
faqQ4: "Why do UK recipes use grams instead of ounces for baking powder?"
faqA4: "The UK uses metric measurements (grams) for precision, especially in baking. Ounces are more common in the US. For seamless conversions, bookmark our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>."

<p>150g of baking powder equals approximately 5.29 ounces. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes, where precise measurements can make or break your dish. Whether you're whipping up cakes, bread, or crispy treats, knowing how to convert grams to ounces ensures consistency. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we help you nail every recipe with accurate conversions and expert tips.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Baking</h2>  
<p>Baking powder is a leavening agent, and even small measurement errors can affect texture and rise. Too much can make your baked goods bitter, while too little may leave them dense. For air fryer recipes, where cooking times are shorter, precision is even more critical. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> simplifies these calculations, so you never have to guess.</p>  

<p>Many UK recipes use grams, but if your kitchen scale measures ounces, this conversion is a lifesaver. Whether you're making fluffy scones or crispy onion bhajis, 150g of baking powder (5.29 oz) ensures perfect results. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> for inspiration on using baking powder effectively.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure 150g of Baking Powder Without a Scale</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a scale, use measuring spoons. One teaspoon of baking powder weighs roughly 4g, so 150g would be about 37.5 teaspoons. However, for accuracy, we recommend investing in a digital scale. Air fryer cooking thrives on precision, and eyeballing measurements can lead to uneven results.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for 150g of Baking Powder in Air Fryer Recipes</h2>  
<p>From cakes to fried chicken coatings, baking powder is versatile. A batch of air-fryer doughnuts might call for 150g, while savoury dishes like tempura use it for lightness. Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>cake recipes</a> to see how baking powder elevates air-fried desserts.</p>  

<p>Remember, storage matters too. Keep baking powder in an airtight container to maintain potency. If your 150g measurement seems off, test its freshness by mixing a teaspoon with hot water—it should bubble vigorously.

<h3>Converting Other Baking Ingredients from Grams to Ounces</h3>  
<p>Flour, sugar, and spices often need converting too. For example, 150g of flour is about 5.29 ounces, just like baking powder. However, ingredient density varies, so always check a reliable chart. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion guide</a> covers all the basics for stress-free air fryer cooking.</p>

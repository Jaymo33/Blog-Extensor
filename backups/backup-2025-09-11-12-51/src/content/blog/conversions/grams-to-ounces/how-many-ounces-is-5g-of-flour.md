faqQ1: "Can I use a tablespoon to measure 5g of flour?"
faqA1: "A tablespoon isn’t ideal for measuring 5g of flour, as it typically holds about 7-8g (0.25-0.28 oz) when leveled. For accuracy, use a teaspoon (roughly 5g) or a kitchen scale. Air fryer recipes, like coatings or batters, often need precise measurements for best results."
faqQ2: "Why does my air fryer recipe call for such a small amount of flour?"
faqA2: "Small amounts like 5g (0.18 oz) of flour are often used for dusting or light coatings in air fryers. Too much flour can create a gummy texture, while the right amount ensures crispiness. Check our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a> for perfectly balanced dishes."
faqQ3: "Is 5g of flour the same in ounces for all types of flour?"
faqA3: "Yes, 5g of any flour (plain, self-raising, or wholemeal) equals 0.18 oz. However, density varies slightly—so for ultra-precise baking, weigh it. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion guide</a> covers all types."
faqQ4: "How do I clean flour residue from my air fryer?"
faqA4: "After using flour, wipe your air fryer basket with a damp cloth or use our recommended <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning tips</a>. Avoid harsh scrubbing to protect non-stick coatings. Regular maintenance keeps your air fryer performing perfectly."

<h2>Why Accurate Flour Measurements Matter in Air Fryers</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on even cooking, and incorrect flour measurements can lead to dry or dense results. For example, 5g of flour to ounces (0.18 oz) might seem small, but it’s crucial for recipes like air fryer cookies or breaded dishes. Too much flour can make coatings clumpy, while too little won’t crisp properly. Always use a digital scale for accuracy, especially with small quantities like 5 grams of flour to oz UK conversions.</p>

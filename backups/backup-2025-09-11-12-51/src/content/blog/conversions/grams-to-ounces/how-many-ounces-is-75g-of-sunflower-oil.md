Whether you’re frying, baking, or roasting, knowing how to convert grams to ounces ensures your dishes turn out perfectly every time.</p>

<h2>Why Convert Grams to Ounces for Sunflower Oil?</h2>  
<p>Many UK recipes, especially those for air fryers, list ingredients in grams, while some kitchen scales or measuring tools use ounces. Converting 75g of sunflower oil to ounces helps you follow recipes accurately. Sunflower oil is a popular choice for air frying due to its high smoke point and neutral flavour. You’ll find it used in everything from crispy chips to succulent chicken dishes on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>.</p>  

<p>Precision matters when cooking with an air fryer because the cooking chamber is smaller than a traditional oven. Too much or too little oil can affect texture and crispiness. For example, 75g of sunflower oil is often used for coating potatoes or marinating meats before air frying.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure 75g of Sunflower Oil in Ounces</h3>

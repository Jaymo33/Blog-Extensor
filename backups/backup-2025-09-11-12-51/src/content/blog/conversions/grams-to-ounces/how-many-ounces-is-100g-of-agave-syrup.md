faqQ1: "Can I use honey instead of agave syrup in my air fryer recipes?"
faqA1: "Yes, you can substitute honey for agave syrup, but keep in mind that honey is slightly thicker and sweeter. Use about 25% less honey than the recipe calls for in agave syrup to avoid overpowering the dish. Adjust cooking times slightly as honey may caramelise faster in the air fryer."
faqQ2: "How do I measure 100g of agave syrup if I don’t have a scale?"
faqA2: "Without a scale, you can use volume measurements. 100g of agave syrup is roughly 70ml or about 4.7 tablespoons. Use a liquid measuring cup or spoons for accuracy. Remember that agave syrup’s viscosity can vary with temperature, so room-temperature syrup will give the most consistent results."
faqQ3: "Is agave syrup healthier than sugar for air fryer recipes?"
faqA3: "Agave syrup has a lower glycemic index than sugar, making it a popular choice for healthier recipes. However, it’s still high in fructose, so moderation is key. In air fryer cooking, agave syrup can provide a smoother sweetness without the granular texture of sugar, but it’s not necessarily \"healthier\" in large quantities."
faqQ4: "Why does my air fryer recipe call for 100g of agave syrup instead of ounces?"
faqA4: "Many recipes, especially those from the UK or Europe, use metric measurements like grams for precision. 100g of agave syrup equals 3.53 ounces, and some cooks prefer grams for baking accuracy. If your air fryer recipe uses grams, sticking to metric measurements ensures consistency in your results."

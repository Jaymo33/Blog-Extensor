faqQ1: "Is 250g of maple syrup the same as 250ml?"
faqA1: "No, 250g of maple syrup isn’t the same as 250ml. Grams measure weight, while millilitres measure volume. Due to its density, 250g of maple syrup equals roughly 192ml, not 250ml. Always weigh for accuracy in air fryer recipes."
faqQ2: "Can I use honey instead of 250g maple syrup in air fryer recipes?"
faqA2: "Yes, you can substitute honey for maple syrup, but adjust the quantity. Honey is denser, so 250g (8.82 oz) of maple syrup would be replaced by about 220g of honey. Expect a slightly different flavour and browning."
faqQ3: "How long does 250g of opened maple syrup last?"
faqA3: "Opened maple syrup lasts up to a year in the fridge. Store 250g (8.82 oz) in an airtight container to prevent crystallisation. If mould appears, discard it—better safe than sorry for your air fryer creations!"
faqQ4: "Why does my air fryer recipe call for 250g instead of cups?"
faqA4: "Weight measurements like 250g (8.82 oz) are more precise than cups, especially for thick ingredients like maple syrup. Air fryer recipes rely on accuracy for even cooking, so grams eliminate guesswork. Always use a scale if possible."

<h2>Why Convert 250g of Maple Syrup to Ounces?</h2>  
<p>Many UK recipes, especially those for air fryers, use metric measurements, while some kitchen scales or older cookbooks prefer ounces. Converting 250g of maple syrup to ounces (8.82 oz) helps avoid errors in sticky situations—literally! Air fryer recipes, like glazed salmon or maple-roasted veggies, often need precise syrup quantities for balanced flavours. A slight miscalculation could make a dish too sweet or underwhelming.

<p>Maple syrup’s density means 250g fills roughly 8.82 fluid ounces, but weight ounces (oz) are what most scales display. This distinction matters because fluid ounces measure volume, while weight ounces measure mass. For accuracy, always use a kitchen scale set to grams or ounces.

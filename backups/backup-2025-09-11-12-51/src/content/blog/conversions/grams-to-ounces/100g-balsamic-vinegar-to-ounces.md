faqQ1: "Can I use 100g of balsamic vinegar for air fryer marinades?"
faqA1: "Absolutely! 100g (3.53 oz) of balsamic vinegar works perfectly for marinating proteins or vegetables in an air fryer. Its acidity tenderises while adding depth. Combine with olive oil and herbs for balanced flavour."
faqQ2: "How does 100g of balsamic vinegar compare to other vinegars in weight?"
faqA2: "Balsamic vinegar is slightly denser than white vinegar, but 100g still equals 3.53 ounces across types. Always measure by weight for accuracy, especially in air fryer recipes where liquid ratios affect crispiness."
faqQ3: "What if my recipe calls for 100ml instead of 100g of balsamic vinegar?"
faqA3: "100ml measures volume, while 100g measures weight. For balsamic vinegar, 100ml weighs about 107g (3.77 oz). In air fryer cooking, stick to weight measurements for consistent results."
faqQ4: "Does reducing 100g of balsamic vinegar change its ounce equivalent?"
faqA4: "Reducing balsamic vinegar concentrates its flavour but not its weight. 100g reduced to a syrup still equals 3.53 oz, though volume decreases. Use sparingly in air fryers to avoid overpowering dishes."

faqQ1: "Can I use white sugar instead of brown sugar for 250g in air fryer recipes?"
faqA1: "Yes, but the texture and flavour will differ. Brown sugar adds moisture and a caramel note, while white sugar is drier. For best results, stick to the recipe’s recommended sugar type."
faqQ2: "How do I convert 250g of brown sugar to cups instead of ounces?"
faqA2: "250g of brown sugar is roughly 1.25 cups when lightly packed. However, weight measurements (grams or ounces) are more accurate for air fryer baking."
faqQ3: "Why does my air fryer recipe call for 250g of brown sugar specifically?"
faqA3: "Recipes specify 250g for balanced sweetness and moisture. Too much sugar can cause over-browning, while too little may dry out baked goods. Precision ensures perfect results."
faqQ4: "Is 250g of brown sugar the same as 250g of granulated sugar in weight?"
faqA4: "Yes, both weigh 250g (8.82 oz), but brown sugar is denser due to moisture. Always measure by weight for accuracy in air fryer recipes."

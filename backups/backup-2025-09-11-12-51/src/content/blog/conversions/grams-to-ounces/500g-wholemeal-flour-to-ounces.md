faqQ1: "Why is it important to convert 500g wholemeal flour to ounces accurately?"
faqA1: "Accurate conversion ensures your air fryer baked goods turn out perfectly. Wholemeal flour's density means even small measurement errors can affect texture and rise. Precise ounces measurement guarantees consistent results every time you bake."
faqQ2: "Does 500g of wholemeal flour measure the same as white flour in ounces?"
faqA2: "Yes, 500g equals about 17.64 ounces for both flours by weight. However, wholemeal flour is denser, so it occupies less volume than white flour. Always measure by weight (grams or ounces) rather than volume for accuracy in air fryer recipes."
faqQ3: "Can I use cups instead of ounces for 500g wholemeal flour?"
faqA3: "While possible, cups measure volume not weight, making them less accurate. 500g wholemeal flour is roughly 4 cups, but this can vary based on how you scoop. For air fryer baking where precision matters, stick to weight measurements in grams or ounces."
faqQ4: "How should I store 500g of wholemeal flour after opening?"
faqA4: "Transfer opened wholemeal flour to an airtight container in a cool, dark place. It lasts 3-6 months this way, or longer in the fridge. Wholemeal flour goes rancid faster than white flour due to its oil-rich germ content, so proper storage is essential."

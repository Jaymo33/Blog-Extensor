faqQ1: "Can I use volume measures (like teaspoons) instead of weighing 10g of baking soda?"
faqA1: "While possible, weighing 10g (0.35 oz) of baking soda is more accurate. A teaspoon can vary based on how the powder is packed. For consistent air fryer results, especially in baking, a digital scale is best."
faqQ2: "Does 10g of baking soda behave differently in an air fryer versus a conventional oven?"
faqA2: "The same 10g (0.35 oz) measurement applies, but air fryers cook faster, so baking soda’s leavening action happens quicker. Reduce cook times by 20% and monitor bakes closely to prevent over-browning."
faqQ3: "How should I store leftover baking soda after measuring 10g?"
faqA3: "Keep baking soda in an airtight container away from moisture and strong odours. Proper storage ensures it remains effective for future air fryer recipes."
faqQ4: "Can I substitute baking powder for 10g of baking soda in air fryer recipes?"
faqA4: "Baking powder isn’t a direct substitute—it’s less potent. For 10g (0.35 oz) of baking soda, you’d need about 30g of baking powder, but this may alter taste. Stick to the original ingredient where possible."

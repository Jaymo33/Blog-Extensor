faqQ1: "How do I convert 15g of peanut butter to ounces without a scale?"
faqA1: "You can use tablespoons as a rough guide—one level tablespoon of peanut butter is approximately 15g or 0.53 ounces. However, this method isn’t as precise as weighing, especially since peanut butter’s density can vary. For accuracy, a digital scale is recommended."
faqQ2: "Why is 15g of peanut butter a common measurement in recipes?"
faqA2: "15g (or 0.53 ounces) is a practical amount for adding flavour without overwhelming a dish. It’s often used in sauces, glazes, or baked goods where balance is key. In air fryer recipes, precise measurements like this ensure even cooking and perfect texture."
faqQ3: "Can I use crunchy peanut butter instead of smooth for 15g measurements?"
faqA3: "Yes, but note that crunchy peanut butter may weigh slightly more due to added nuts. For precise conversions, stick to smooth unless the recipe specifies otherwise. The difference is minimal but worth considering for baking."
faqQ4: "How does 15g of peanut butter compare to other nut butters in ounces?"
faqA4: "Most nut butters have similar densities, so 15g of almond or cashew butter also equals roughly 0.53 ounces. However, always check specific recipes, as some nut butters may vary slightly in oil content or thickness."

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>

This is why converting 15g of peanut butter to ounces (0.53 oz) is so useful. It’s a common measurement in many recipes, especially those for air fryer cookies or sauces. If you’re working with larger quantities, simply multiply the conversion accordingly.</p>

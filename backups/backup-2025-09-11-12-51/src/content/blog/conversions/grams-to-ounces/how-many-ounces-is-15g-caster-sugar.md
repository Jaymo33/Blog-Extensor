faqQ1: "Can I use granulated sugar instead of caster sugar in air fryer recipes?"
faqA1: "Yes, you can substitute granulated sugar for caster sugar, but be aware it may affect texture. Granulated sugar is coarser, so it might not dissolve as quickly in air fryer recipes. For every 15g (0.53oz) of caster sugar, you can use the same weight of granulated sugar."
faqQ2: "How do I measure 15g of caster sugar without scales?"
faqA2: "One level tablespoon of caster sugar equals approximately 15g (0.53oz). However, for complete accuracy in air fryer recipes, we recommend using digital kitchen scales. The compact size of air fryer baskets means precise measurements are particularly important."
faqQ3: "Why is caster sugar better for air fryer baking?"
faqA3: "Caster sugar's finer grains dissolve more quickly in air fryer baking, creating a smoother texture in cakes and desserts. The rapid air circulation in air fryers means ingredients need to combine well, and caster sugar helps achieve this better than granulated sugar."
faqQ4: "Does sugar behave differently in an air fryer compared to a conventional oven?"
faqA4: "Yes, sugar can caramelise and burn more quickly in an air fryer due to the concentrated heat and air circulation. When using 15g (0.53oz) portions or larger, monitor your food closely and consider reducing cooking times slightly compared to oven recipes."

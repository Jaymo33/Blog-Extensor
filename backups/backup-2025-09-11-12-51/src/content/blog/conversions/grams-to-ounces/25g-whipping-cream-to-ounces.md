faqQ1: "Can I use a tablespoon to measure 25g of whipping cream instead of scales?"
faqA1: "While you can use tablespoons (25g is roughly 2 tbsp), weighing is more accurate. Whipping cream's density can vary slightly, so scales ensure precision, especially for air fryer recipes where consistency matters."
faqQ2: "Does 25g of whipping cream equal the same in fluid ounces?"
faqA2: "No, fluid ounces measure volume, while weight ounces measure mass. For whipping cream, 25g (0.88 oz) by weight doesn't directly convert to fluid ounces without knowing the density. Always check whether your recipe uses weight or volume measurements."
faqQ3: "How long does 25g of whipping cream last in the fridge?"
faqA3: "Once opened, whipping cream lasts 3-4 days refrigerated. Store it in an airtight container at the back of the fridge (not the door) to maintain freshness for your next air fryer recipe. Check for sour smells or separation before use."
faqQ4: "Can I freeze leftover 25g portions of whipping cream?"
faqA4: "Yes, but texture changes may occur. Freeze in ice cube trays for easy portions. Thawed cream works best in cooked dishes like sauces rather than whipped toppings. Stir well before using in air fryer recipes to recombine any separation."

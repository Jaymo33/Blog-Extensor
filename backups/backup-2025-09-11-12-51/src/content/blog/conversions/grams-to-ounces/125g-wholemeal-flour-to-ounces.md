faqQ1: "Can I use cups instead of ounces for 125g of wholemeal flour?"
faqA1: "While you can use cups, weighing ingredients is more accurate for baking. 125g of wholemeal flour is about 1 cup, but this can vary depending on how you scoop the flour. For consistent results in air fryer recipes, we recommend using a scale to measure 125g (4.41 oz) precisely."
faqQ2: "Does wholemeal flour affect cooking times in the air fryer?"
faqA2: "Wholemeal flour can slightly increase cooking times in the air fryer because it creates denser baked goods. When using 125g (4.41 oz), you might need to add 1-2 minutes to the cooking time. Always check for doneness with a skewer – it should come out clean when inserted into the centre."
faqQ3: "How does 125g of wholemeal flour compare to self-raising flour in ounces?"
faqA3: "125g of wholemeal flour and 125g of self-raising flour both equal 4.41 ounces by weight. However, self-raising flour contains baking powder, which affects how recipes rise. If substituting, you'll need to add 1.5 teaspoons of baking powder per 125g (4.41 oz) of wholemeal flour for similar results."
faqQ4: "Can I use 125g of wholemeal flour for air fryer frying instead of baking?"
faqA4: "Absolutely! 125g (4.41 oz) of wholemeal flour makes an excellent coating for air-fried chicken, fish or vegetables. It creates a crispier, nuttier crust than plain flour. For best results, mix with seasonings and lightly spray with oil before air frying at 180°C for golden, crunchy perfection."

<h3>How to measure 125g of wholemeal flour accurately</h3>  
<p>Using a digital kitchen scale is the most precise way to measure 125g of wholemeal flour. If you don’t have one, spoon the flour into a measuring cup and level it off with a knife. Avoid packing the flour down, as this can lead to over-measuring.</p>

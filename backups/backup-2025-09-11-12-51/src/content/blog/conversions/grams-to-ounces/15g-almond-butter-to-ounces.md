faqQ1: "Can I use peanut butter instead of almond butter in a 15g measurement?"
faqA1: "Yes, you can substitute peanut butter for almond butter in a 1:1 ratio by weight (15g = 0.53 oz). However, peanut butter has a stronger flavour and slightly different texture, which may alter the dish’s taste. For air fryer recipes, both work well as binders or coatings."

faqA4: "Absolutely! Freeze 15g (0.53 oz) portions in silicone molds or small containers. Thaw before using in air fryer recipes. This method is perfect for meal prep or preserving homemade almond butter. Avoid freezing jars repeatedly, as it can affect texture."

Let’s dive deeper into why this measurement matters for air fryer cooking.</p>  

<h2>Why Convert 20g of Rice to Ounces?</h2>  
<p>Many UK recipes use grams, but some kitchen scales or international recipes might list rice in ounces. Converting 20g of rice to ounces (0.71 oz) helps maintain accuracy, especially in air fryer cooking where portion sizes affect texture and cook time. Rice expands when cooked, so precise measurements prevent overcrowding in the air fryer basket.

Whether you're making fried rice or a grain bowl, this conversion ensures perfectly cooked results every time.</p>  

<p>Air fryers excel at reheating or crisping rice-based dishes, but portion control is key. Too much rice can lead to uneven cooking, while too little might dry out. By converting 20g of rice to ounces, you can follow recipes from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>our collection</a> with confidence. This small but crucial step guarantees your air-fried rice dishes turn out fluffy and delicious. Remember, 20g of rice is roughly two tablespoons uncooked, expanding to about half a cup cooked.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure 20g of Rice Without Scales</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have digital scales, use a tablespoon to measure 20g of rice (approximately 2 level tablespoons). This method works for most types of uncooked rice, including basmati or jasmine. For sticky rice, compact it slightly for accuracy. Visit <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/meal-prep>meal prep recipes</a> for ideas on pre-portioned air fryer meals. While scales are ideal, these visual estimates help when you're in a pinch.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for 20g of Rice in Air Fryers</h2>  
<p>20g of rice (0.71 oz) is perfect for single-serving air fryer dishes like crispy rice cakes or stuffed peppers. It’s also ideal for adding texture to <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable-based recipes</a>. When air-frying, spread the rice thinly for even crisping—great for golden rice crusts or crunchy toppings. This small quantity prevents sogginess while maximising surface area for that signature air fryer crunch.</p>  

<p>For fried rice enthusiasts, 20g of uncooked rice yields just enough for a personal portion when combined with veggies or protein in the air fryer. It’s also the right amount for binding ingredients in veggie burgers or arancini. After cooking, clean your air fryer easily with tips from our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning guide</a>. Precise measurements like 20g to ounces ensure your air fryer creations are consistently delicious.</p>  

<h3>Does Rice Type Affect the Ounce Conversion?</h3>  
<p>While 20g always equals 0.71 ounces, different rice varieties have slightly different volumes. Long-grain rice like basmati is less dense than short-grain sushi rice. However, the weight-to-ounce conversion remains the same—only the volume per gram changes. For air frying, this means adjusting cook times rather than measurements when switching rice types.</p>

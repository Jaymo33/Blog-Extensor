faqQ1: "Is 500g of almond milk the same as 500ml?"
faqA1: "Yes, because almond milk has a density similar to water, 500g is roughly equivalent to 500ml. This makes conversions between grams and millilitres straightforward for most recipes. However, always check labels for thickened or flavoured varieties, as they may differ slightly."
faqQ2: "Can I use 500g of almond milk in any air fryer recipe?"
faqA2: "Absolutely! Almond milk works well in most air fryer recipes, from batters to sauces. Just ensure you convert 500g to ounces (17.64 oz) if the recipe uses imperial measurements. Its neutral flavour makes it a versatile dairy substitute."
faqQ3: "How do I store leftover almond milk after measuring 500g?"
faqA3: "Store opened almond milk in the fridge and use it within 7–10 days. Shake well before each use, as separation is normal. For longer storage, consider freezing portions in ice cube trays for future air fryer recipes."
faqQ4: "Why does my air fryer recipe with almond milk turn out watery?"
faqA4: "This could be due to excess liquid or insufficient thickening agents. Almond milk has a high water content, so reduce other liquids or add a binder like cornflour. Always follow recipe measurements closely for best results."

faqQ1: "Can I use a measuring cup instead of a scale for 40g of wholemeal flour?"
faqA1: "While a measuring cup can work in a pinch, it’s less accurate than a scale. 40g of wholemeal flour is roughly 5 tablespoons, but this can vary based on how tightly packed the flour is. For best results, especially in air fryer baking, a digital scale is recommended."
faqQ2: "Does wholemeal flour weigh the same as plain flour in ounces?"
faqA2: "Wholemeal flour is slightly denser than plain flour due to its higher fibre content, but the difference is minimal for small amounts like 40g. Both will convert to approximately 1.41 ounces, but always weigh for precision in recipes."
faqQ3: "How do I convert 40g of wholemeal flour to cups?"
faqA3: "40g of wholemeal flour is roughly 1/3 cup, but this can vary based on how you scoop the flour. For air fryer recipes, where consistency is key, weighing the flour (40g = 1.41 oz) is far more reliable than volume measurements."
faqQ4: "Can I substitute wholemeal flour with another type in air fryer recipes?"
faqA4: "Yes, but adjustments may be needed. Wholemeal flour absorbs more liquid than plain flour, so if substituting, start with slightly less liquid in your recipe. For 40g (1.41 oz), the swap should work, but monitor the batter or dough consistency."

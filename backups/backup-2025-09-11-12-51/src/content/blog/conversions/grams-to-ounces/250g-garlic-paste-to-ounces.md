faqQ1: "Can I use minced garlic instead of garlic paste for 250g?"
faqA1: "Yes, minced garlic can substitute for garlic paste, but the texture and intensity may differ. Use the same weight (250g) for consistency, but note that minced garlic might be slightly stronger in flavour. Adjust to taste if needed."
faqQ2: "How many cups is 250g of garlic paste?"
faqA2: "250g of garlic paste is roughly 1 cup, but this can vary based on the paste’s thickness. For precise measurements, especially in air fryer recipes, a kitchen scale is recommended to ensure accuracy."
faqQ3: "Does 250g of garlic paste change weight when cooked in an air fryer?"
faqA3: "Cooking reduces the water content in garlic paste, so 250g will weigh slightly less after air frying. However, the difference is minimal for most recipes. Focus on pre-cooked measurements unless the recipe specifies otherwise."
faqQ4: "Can I freeze 250g portions of garlic paste for later use?"
faqA4: "Absolutely! Freezing 250g portions of garlic paste in airtight containers or bags preserves freshness. Thaw in the fridge before use, and stir well to restore consistency. Ideal for meal prep or quick air fryer dishes."

<h3>How to measure 250g of garlic paste accurately</h3>

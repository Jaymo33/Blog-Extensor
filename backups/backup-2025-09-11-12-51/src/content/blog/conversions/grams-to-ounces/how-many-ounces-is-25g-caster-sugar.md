faqQ1: "Can I use granulated sugar instead of caster sugar in air fryer recipes?"
faqA1: "Yes, but with caution. Granulated sugar has larger crystals, so it may not dissolve as evenly in air fryer recipes. If substituting, pulse the granulated sugar in a blender briefly to make it finer. The weight conversion remains the same—25g equals 0.88 oz for both types."
faqQ2: "How do I measure 25g of caster sugar if I only have cups?"
faqA2: "25g of caster sugar is roughly 2 tablespoons or 1/8 cup. However, cup measurements can vary, so weighing is more accurate. For air fryer baking, where precision matters, we recommend using digital scales for the best results."
faqQ3: "Why does my air fryer bake unevenly when using caster sugar?"
faqA3: "This could be due to overcrowding or incorrect temperature settings. Air fryers need space for proper air circulation. When baking with 25g of caster sugar (0.88 oz), use parchment paper with holes and shake the basket halfway for even cooking."
faqQ4: "Does 25g of caster sugar have the same calories in ounces?"
faqA4: "Yes, the calorie content remains the same regardless of the measurement unit. 25g (0.88 oz) of caster sugar contains about 100 calories. The weight-to-volume conversion doesn't affect nutritional values, only how you measure it."

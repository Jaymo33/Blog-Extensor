faqQ1: "Can I use fresh ginger instead of 250g of ginger paste?"
faqA1: "Yes, you can substitute fresh ginger for ginger paste. Use about 2 tablespoons of freshly grated ginger for every 15g (0.53 oz) of ginger paste. Adjust to taste, as fresh ginger can be more potent."
faqQ2: "How long does 250g of ginger paste last in the fridge?"
faqA2: "Stored in an airtight container, ginger paste lasts up to two weeks in the fridge. For longer storage, freeze it in portions. Each 15g (0.53 oz) portion is perfect for single-use recipes."
faqQ3: "Is 250g of ginger paste the same as 250ml?"
faqA3: "No, weight (grams) and volume (millilitres) measure different properties. Ginger paste’s density means 250g is roughly 250ml, but for accuracy, always weigh it—especially in air fryer cooking."
faqQ4: "Can I make ginger paste at home to match 250g?"
faqA4: "Absolutely! Blend 250g of peeled fresh ginger with a bit of water or oil until smooth. Homemade paste may taste fresher but lacks preservatives, so use it within a week or freeze it."

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on even cooking, and incorrect measurements can throw off the balance of your dish. Too much ginger paste might overpower the flavours, while too little could leave your meal tasting bland. That’s why converting 250g of ginger paste to ounces (8.82 oz) is so useful. It’s a common measurement in many recipes, especially those found on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>.

<p>Many UK cooks prefer using grams, but some recipes, particularly older or American ones, list ingredients in ounces. Converting 250g of ginger paste to ounces bridges this gap. It’s also handy when scaling recipes up or down. If you're meal prepping or cooking for a crowd, knowing that 250g equals 8.82 ounces helps maintain consistency across batches.</p>  

<h3>How to measure ginger paste accurately</h3>  
<p>For the best results, use a digital kitchen scale to weigh your ginger paste. If you don’t have one, a standard measuring spoon can work in a pinch—though it’s less precise.

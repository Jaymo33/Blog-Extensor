faqQ1: "Can I use tablespoons to measure 10g of golden syrup instead of scales?"
faqA1: "While you can use tablespoons, it’s less accurate. 10g of golden syrup is roughly two level teaspoons, but scales are best for precision. Golden syrup’s thickness means volume measurements can vary, especially if the syrup is warm or cold."
faqQ2: "Why does 10g of golden syrup matter in air fryer recipes?"
faqA2: "Air fryers cook quickly, so ingredient ratios are critical. Too much golden syrup (over 0.35 oz) can cause burning or overly sweet results, while too little may lack flavour. Precise measurements ensure balanced dishes every time."
faqQ3: "How do I convert larger amounts of golden syrup from grams to ounces?"
faqA3: "Multiply the grams by 0.035 to get ounces. For example, 100g of golden syrup equals 3.5 ounces. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a> simplifies this for all common ingredients."
faqQ4: "Does golden syrup behave differently in an air fryer compared to other sweeteners?"
faqA4: "Yes, golden syrup’s high sugar content caramelises quickly in air fryers. At 10g (0.35 oz), it’s ideal for glazes or drizzles, but monitor closely to prevent burning. Reduce cooking time slightly for syrupy dishes."

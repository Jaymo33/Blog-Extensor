faqQ1: "Can I use instant yeast instead of active dry yeast for 200g?"
faqA1: "Yes, you can substitute instant yeast for active dry yeast, but the conversion isn’t 1:1. Use about 25% less instant yeast since it’s more potent. For 200g of active dry yeast, you’d need roughly 150g of instant yeast."
faqQ2: "How do I store 200g of yeast to keep it fresh?"
faqA2: "Store yeast in an airtight container in the fridge or freezer to extend its shelf life. If using frequently, keep it in a cool, dark place. Always check for freshness by dissolving a small amount in warm water—if it bubbles, it’s still active."
faqQ3: "Why does my dough not rise properly in the air fryer?"
faqA3: "Air fryers circulate hot air, which can dry out dough faster than conventional ovens. Ensure your yeast is fresh and properly measured, and consider covering the dough with foil during the initial rise to retain moisture."
faqQ4: "Is 200g of yeast too much for a standard bread recipe?"
faqA4: "200g of yeast is excessive for most home baking recipes, which typically call for 7g (1 packet) per 500g of flour. Using too much yeast can cause overproofing and a bitter taste. Always follow recipe guidelines for best results."

<p>200g of yeast equals approximately 7.05 ounces. This conversion is essential for bakers who need precise measurements, especially when using an air fryer for recipes like bread or dough-based dishes. Whether you're following a UK recipe or adjusting measurements, knowing how to convert grams to ounces ensures consistency in your baking.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Yeast Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Yeast is a crucial ingredient in baking, and even small measurement errors can affect the rise and texture of your dough. Too much yeast can cause over-fermentation, while too little may result in dense, underproofed bread. For air fryer recipes, where cooking times are shorter, precision is even more important to achieve the perfect bake.</p>

This handy tool ensures you never get stuck mid-recipe, whether you're making bread, cakes, or even savoury dishes like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>air fryer chicken</a>.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure 200g of Yeast Without Scales</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a kitchen scale, you can still measure 200g of yeast using volume conversions. Active dry yeast typically weighs about 2.8g per teaspoon, so 200g would be roughly 71 teaspoons. However, this method is less precise, so investing in a digital scale is recommended for consistent results.</p>  

<h2>Converting 200g of Yeast to Ounces for UK Bakers</h2>  
<p>In the UK, recipes often use grams, but some bakers prefer ounces for smaller quantities. Since 1 ounce equals 28.35 grams, dividing 200g by 28.35 gives you 7.05 ounces. This conversion is particularly useful for recipes like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>air fryer cakes</a>, where precision matters.</p>

<h3>Common Mistakes When Measuring Yeast</h3>  
<p>One of the biggest mistakes is confusing active dry yeast with instant yeast, as they have different weights per teaspoon. Always check the type specified in your recipe. Also, avoid packing yeast into measuring spoons, as this can lead to inaccurate measurements.</p>

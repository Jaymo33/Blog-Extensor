faqQ1: "Can I use crunchy peanut butter instead of smooth for 10g measurements?"
faqA1: "Yes, crunchy and smooth peanut butter have the same density, so 10g equals 0.35 ounces for both. However, crunchy peanut butter may settle differently in a measuring spoon, so a scale is more accurate."
faqQ2: "How does 10g of peanut butter compare to tablespoons?"
faqA2: "10g of peanut butter is roughly 2 level teaspoons or just under 1 tablespoon. For precise air fryer recipes, weighing it is best, as tablespoon measurements can vary based on how packed the spoon is."
faqQ3: "Why does my air fryer recipe call for 10g of peanut butter specifically?"
faqA3: "10g (0.35 oz) is often used for portion control or to balance flavours without overpowering a dish. In air fryers, small amounts like this ensure even cooking and prevent excess oiliness."
faqQ4: "Can I substitute almond butter for peanut butter in a 10g measurement?"
faqA4: "Yes, almond butter has a similar density, so 10g equals 0.35 ounces. However, flavour and oil content differ, which may slightly affect your air fryer recipe’s outcome. Adjust other ingredients if needed."

faqQ1: "Is 100g of double cream the same as 100ml?"
faqA1: "No, 100g of double cream is roughly equal to 100ml, but this isn’t exact due to density differences. Grams measure weight, while millilitres measure volume. For precise air fryer recipes, weighing ingredients is always best."
faqQ2: "Can I use single cream instead of double cream in air fryer recipes?"
faqA2: "You can substitute single cream, but it has a lower fat content (around 18% vs. 48% in double cream). This may affect texture and richness in dishes like sauces or desserts. Adjust cooking times slightly as single cream heats faster."
faqQ3: "How do I store leftover double cream after measuring 100g?"
faqA3: "Store leftover double cream in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 3 days. Shake well before using, as it may separate. For longer storage, freeze it in ice cube trays for future air fryer recipes."
faqQ4: "Why does my air fryer recipe call for ounces instead of grams?"
faqA4: "Some older or US-based recipes use imperial measurements like ounces. Converting 100g of double cream to ounces (3.53 oz) ensures accuracy. Always check where the recipe originates to determine the best measurement system to use."

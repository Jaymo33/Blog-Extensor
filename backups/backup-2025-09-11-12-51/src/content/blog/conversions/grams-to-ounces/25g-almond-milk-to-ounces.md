faqQ1: "Can I use a measuring cup instead of scales for 25g almond milk?"
faqA1: "While scales are best, you can approximate 25g (0.88 oz) of almond milk with measuring spoons. Two level tablespoons equal roughly 30g, so use just under that. For accuracy, invest in cheap digital scales—they’re a game-changer for air fryer cooking."
faqQ2: "Why do some recipes list almond milk in grams vs ounces?"
faqA2: "Grams are standard in metric-system countries like the UK, while ounces are more common in the US. Recipes on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> often use grams for precision, but we provide conversions for flexibility."
faqQ3: "Does 25g of almond milk change weight when heated in the air fryer?"
faqA3: "Yes, some water content evaporates during cooking, reducing weight slightly. For recipes where moisture matters (like cakes), stick to the original 25g (0.88 oz) measurement before heating."
faqQ4: "How does almond milk compare to dairy milk in weight for air fryer recipes?"
faqA4: "Almond milk is slightly lighter—25g of whole dairy milk equals about 0.89 oz due to higher fat content. The difference is minimal for most air fryer recipes, but vegans should stick to almond milk measurements."

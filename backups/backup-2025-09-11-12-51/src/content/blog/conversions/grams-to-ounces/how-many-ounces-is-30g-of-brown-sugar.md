faqQ1: "Can I use white sugar instead of brown sugar in air fryer recipes?"
faqA1: "Yes, but the results will differ. Brown sugar adds moisture and a caramel-like flavour due to its molasses content. White sugar is drier and may alter the texture of your dish. If substituting, reduce the amount slightly and monitor cooking times closely."
faqQ2: "How do I measure 30g of brown sugar if I don’t have a scale?"
faqA2: "Two packed tablespoons of brown sugar equal roughly 30g. Pack the sugar firmly into the spoon to ensure accuracy. For larger quantities, use a measuring cup and level it off, remembering that 1 cup of packed brown sugar is about 200g."
faqQ3: "Why does my air fryer recipe call for brown sugar instead of white?"
faqA3: "Brown sugar’s moisture and molasses content help create a softer texture and richer flavour in dishes like glazes, marinades, and baked goods. It also caramelises better, adding depth to savoury and sweet recipes alike."
faqQ4: "How should I store brown sugar to keep it fresh for air fryer recipes?"
faqA4: "Store brown sugar in an airtight container in a cool, dry place. If it hardens, place a slice of bread or a damp paper towel in the container overnight to restore moisture. Avoid refrigeration, as it can cause clumping."

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer recipes</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on precise cooking times and ingredient quantities to deliver consistent results. Using the correct amount of brown sugar, whether in grams or ounces, ensures your dishes caramelise properly without burning. Too much sugar can lead to overly sticky or burnt edges, while too little might leave your dish lacking flavour.

<p>Brown sugar is a common ingredient in many air fryer recipes, from glazes to baked goods. Its moisture content means it behaves differently than white sugar, so measuring accurately is key. If you’re working with 30g of brown sugar, knowing it’s roughly 1.06 ounces helps you follow recipes precisely, whether they’re written in metric or imperial measurements.</p>  

<h3>How to measure 30g of brown sugar without scales</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a kitchen scale, you can still measure 30g of brown sugar using tablespoons. One packed tablespoon of brown sugar is about 12-15g, so two tablespoons will get you close to 30g. For a more precise measurement, lightly spoon the sugar into a measuring cup and level it off. Remember, brown sugar should be packed firmly when measuring by volume to ensure accuracy.</p>

<h3>Converting other sugar measurements for air fryer cooking</h3>

<h2>Tips for working with brown sugar in air fryers</h2>  
<p>Brown sugar can clump over time, so storing it in an airtight container helps maintain its texture. If your sugar has hardened, a quick zap in the microwave or a slice of bread in the container can soften it again. When measuring, always pack it firmly to avoid air gaps, which can throw off your recipe’s balance.</p>  

<p>For sticky recipes like glazes or marinades, mixing brown sugar with a bit of oil or butter helps it distribute evenly in the air fryer. This prevents clumping and ensures even cooking.

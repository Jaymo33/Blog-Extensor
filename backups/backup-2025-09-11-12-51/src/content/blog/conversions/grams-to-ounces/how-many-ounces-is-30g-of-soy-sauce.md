faqQ1: "Can I use tablespoons to measure 30g of soy sauce?"
faqA1: "Yes, you can use tablespoons to measure 30g of soy sauce. One tablespoon of soy sauce weighs about 15g, so two tablespoons will give you roughly 30g (or 1.06 ounces). For the most accurate results, though, a digital kitchen scale is recommended."
faqQ2: "How does 30g of soy sauce affect air fryer cooking times?"
faqA2: "30g of soy sauce in a marinade or glaze won’t significantly alter cooking times, but it can cause quicker browning due to its sugar content. Keep an eye on your dish during the last few minutes to prevent overcaramelisation. Adjust temperatures slightly if needed."
faqQ3: "Is 30g of soy sauce the same as 30ml?"
faqA3: "No, 30g of soy sauce is not the same as 30ml. While they’re close in volume, soy sauce’s density means 30ml weighs slightly less (about 28g). For precise measurements, always weigh liquids like soy sauce for air fryer recipes."
faqQ4: "Can I substitute low-sodium soy sauce for regular in a 30g measurement?"
faqA4: "Yes, you can substitute low-sodium soy sauce, but you may need to adjust other seasonings. Low-sodium soy sauce has a milder flavour, so consider adding a pinch of salt or a splash of fish sauce if the recipe tastes too bland. The 30g-to-ounces conversion remains the same."

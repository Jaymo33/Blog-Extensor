faqQ1: "Can I use 150g of quinoa for air fryer baking?"
faqA1: "Absolutely! 150g (5.29 oz) of quinoa works well in air fryer baking, like crusts or binders for veggie burgers. Just ensure it’s cooked and cooled before mixing with other ingredients. The air fryer’s even heat helps create a crispy exterior while keeping the inside moist."
faqQ2: "How does 150g of quinoa compare to rice in an air fryer?"
faqA2: "150g of quinoa (5.29 oz) cooks faster than rice in an air fryer due to its smaller size. Quinoa also becomes crispier, making it great for texture-focused dishes. Unlike rice, it doesn’t require pre-soaking, saving time for quick meals."
faqQ3: "Is 150g of quinoa enough for two people in the air fryer?"
faqA3: "Yes, 150g (5.29 oz) of dry quinoa yields about 450g cooked, serving two generously. It’s perfect for air fryer stir-fries or stuffed vegetables. Adjust seasonings to taste, as quinoa absorbs flavours beautifully during air frying."
faqQ4: "Why does my 150g quinoa clump in the air fryer?"
faqA4: "Clumping usually happens if the quinoa is too wet or overcrowded. After cooking 150g (5.29 oz), spread it thinly in the air fryer basket for even crisping. A light oil spray can also help separate grains for better texture."

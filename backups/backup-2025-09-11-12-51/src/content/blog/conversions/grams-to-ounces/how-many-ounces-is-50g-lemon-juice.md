faqQ1: "Can I use bottled lemon juice instead of fresh for air fryer recipes?"
faqA1: "While fresh lemon juice is preferred for its bright flavour, bottled lemon juice can work in a pinch for air fryer recipes. Just remember that bottled juice often contains preservatives that might slightly alter the taste. If substituting, use the same 50g (1.76 oz) measurement unless the recipe specifies otherwise."
faqQ2: "How does lemon juice affect cooking times in an air fryer?"
faqA2: "Lemon juice itself doesn’t significantly change air fryer cooking times, but acidic marinades can help tenderise meat faster. When using 50g (1.76 oz) of lemon juice in marinades, you might reduce cooking time slightly for proteins like chicken or fish. Always check internal temperatures for doneness."
faqQ3: "Is 50g of lemon juice the same as 50ml?"
faqA3: "No, 50g of lemon juice isn’t exactly the same as 50ml. While they’re close (lemon juice has a density of about 1.03 g/ml), for precise measurements in air fryer recipes, it’s best to stick to weight measurements. 50g equals roughly 48.5ml of lemon juice."
faqQ4: "Can I freeze leftover lemon juice for future air fryer recipes?"
faqA4: "Absolutely! Freezing lemon juice in ice cube trays is a great way to preserve it. Each cube holds about 15g, so three cubes plus half another will give you approximately 50g (1.76 oz) when thawed. This method works perfectly for future air fryer marinades or dressings."

faqQ1: "Can I use tablespoons to measure 125g of fish sauce?"
faqA1: "While possible, tablespoons aren’t ideal for precise measurements. One tablespoon of fish sauce weighs about 15g, so 125g would be roughly 8.3 tablespoons. For accuracy, especially in air fryer recipes, a kitchen scale is recommended."
faqQ2: "Does fish sauce weight change between brands?"
faqA2: "The density of fish sauce is fairly consistent across brands, so 125g will always equal ~4.41 ounces. However, thicker artisanal varieties may vary slightly. When in doubt, check the label or use a scale."
faqQ3: "How long does 125g of fish sauce last once opened?"
faqA3: "An opened bottle of fish sauce stays fresh for about 12 months if refrigerated. Store it away from strong odours, and always check for off smells before using it in your air fryer recipes."
faqQ4: "Can I substitute soy sauce for 125g fish sauce?"
faqA4: "Soy sauce can work in a pinch, but use 20% less (about 100g) as it’s saltier. For authentic flavour in air fryer dishes, stick to fish sauce whenever possible."

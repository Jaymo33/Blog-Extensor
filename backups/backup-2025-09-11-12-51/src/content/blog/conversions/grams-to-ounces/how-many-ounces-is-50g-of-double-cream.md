faqQ1: "Can I use single cream instead of double cream if I only have 50g?"
faqA1: "Yes, but the texture and richness will differ. Double cream has about 48% fat, while single cream has around 18%. For air fryer recipes, single cream may separate or thin out more during cooking. If substituting, consider reducing cooking time slightly."
faqQ2: "How do I convert 50g of double cream to cups?"
faqA2: "50g of double cream is roughly 3.5 tablespoons or just under ¼ cup. However, measuring by weight (grams or ounces) is more accurate for air fryer recipes, as cup sizes can vary. Use a scale for best results."
faqQ3: "Why does my air fryer recipe with double cream turn out greasy?"
faqA3: "Double cream’s high fat content can sometimes render excess oil in the air fryer’s high heat. To avoid greasiness, measure precisely (50g = 1.76 oz) and pair it with absorbent ingredients like breadcrumbs or potatoes."
faqQ4: "Can I freeze leftover double cream after measuring 50g?"
faqA4: "Freezing double cream isn’t recommended, as it separates and becomes grainy when thawed. Instead, use leftovers within a few days in sauces, soups, or coffee. For longer storage, consider making butter or whipped cream first."

<p>50g of double cream equals approximately 1.76 ounces. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements can make or break your dish. Whether you're whipping up a creamy dessert or a rich sauce, knowing the exact weight ensures perfect results every time.

<h2>Why Convert Grams to Ounces for Double Cream?</h2>  
<p>Many UK recipes use grams, but some kitchen scales or international recipes might list ounces. Converting 50g of double cream to ounces (1.76 oz) ensures you’re using the right amount for your air fryer creations. Double cream is thicker and richer than single cream, so even small measurement errors can affect texture and taste.

<p>If you’re making a dessert like a creamy custard or a savoury sauce, precision matters. Air fryers cook quickly, so balancing ingredients correctly is key. A slight overpour of double cream could make your dish too heavy, while too little might leave it lacking richness. Stick to 1.76 ounces for 50g to nail the consistency every time.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure 50g of Double Cream Accurately</h3>  
<p>Using a digital kitchen scale is the easiest way to measure 50g of double cream. If your scale displays ounces, it should read 1.76 oz. No scale? A UK tablespoon holds about 15g of double cream, so roughly 3.5 tablespoons will get you close to 50g.

<p>Another great use is in air-fried mashed potatoes. Adding 50g of double cream makes them extra velvety. Since air fryers circulate hot air, creamy ingredients can reduce or thicken faster than in conventional ovens. Measuring precisely avoids dryness or sogginess.

<h3>Storing Leftover Double Cream</h3>  
<p>If your recipe calls for 50g but you’ve opened a larger container, store the rest airtight in the fridge. Double cream lasts about 5 days once opened. To avoid waste, plan recipes like soups or sauces that use small amounts.

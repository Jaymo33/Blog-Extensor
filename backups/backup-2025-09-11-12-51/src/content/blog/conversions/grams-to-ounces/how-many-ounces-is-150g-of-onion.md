faqQ1: "Can I use frozen onions instead of fresh for 150g measurements?"
faqA1: "Yes, you can substitute frozen onions for fresh in air fryer recipes. 150g of frozen onion is equivalent in weight to fresh, but pat them dry before cooking to avoid excess moisture. Frozen onions work well in dishes like air-fried pies or casseroles."
faqQ2: "How do I store leftover onion after measuring 150g?"
faqA2: "Store chopped onion in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 3 days. For longer storage, freeze it in portions—150g batches are handy for future recipes. Just note that thawed onions are best used in cooked dishes rather than raw."
faqQ3: "Does the type of onion affect the 150g to ounces conversion?"
faqA3: "No, the conversion from 150g to ounces (5.29 oz) applies to all onion varieties, from red to white to shallots. However, different onions vary in flavour intensity, so adjust recipes accordingly. Sweet onions, for example, may require slightly less quantity for the same taste."
faqQ4: "Why do some recipes use grams and others use ounces for onions?"
faqA4: "Recipes may use grams or ounces depending on regional preferences—grams are standard in the UK and Europe, while ounces are more common in the US. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we provide both where possible to make cooking hassle-free. Always check which unit your recipe uses before starting."

<p>150g of onion equals approximately 5.29 ounces. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes, where precise measurements can make all the difference. Whether you’re preparing a hearty stew or crispy onion rings, knowing how to convert grams to ounces ensures your dish turns out perfectly every time. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we understand the importance of accurate measurements, especially when working with ingredients like onions that can vary in density.</p>

<h2>Why accurate onion measurements matter in air frying</h2>  
<p>Onions are a staple in many air fryer recipes, from caramelised toppings to crunchy garnishes. Using the right amount ensures balanced flavours and even cooking. If you’re following a recipe that calls for 150g of onion, converting it to ounces (5.29 oz) helps if your kitchen scales only measure in imperial units.

<p>Air fryers cook food quickly, so unevenly sized onion pieces can lead to inconsistent results. Measuring 150g of onion (or 5.29 ounces) ensures uniformity, whether you’re dicing, slicing, or grating. This precision is especially handy for recipes like air-fried onion bhajis or stuffed peppers, where the onion’s weight affects texture and cooking time.</p>  

<h2>How to measure 150g of onion without scales</h2>  
<p>Don’t have kitchen scales? No problem. One medium-sized onion typically weighs around 150g (5.29 ounces), making it a handy rule of thumb. For smaller or larger onions, adjust accordingly—half a large onion or two small ones should get you close to the 150g mark. If you’re prepping ahead, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipes section</a> has plenty of ideas for using up leftover onions.</p>  

<h3>Using cups for approximate measurements</h3>  
<p>If you’re in a pinch, 150g of chopped onion roughly fills one metric cup. However, this can vary depending on how finely you dice the onion. For air fryer recipes, we recommend sticking to weight measurements for the best results, as volume measurements can be less precise.</p>  

<h2>Common air fryer recipes using 150g of onion</h2>

Prefer a milder taste? Reduce the quantity slightly. The air fryer’s versatility makes it easy to experiment.</p>

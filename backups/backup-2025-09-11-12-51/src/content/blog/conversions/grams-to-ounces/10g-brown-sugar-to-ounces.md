faqQ1: "Is 10g of brown sugar the same as 10g of white sugar in ounces?"
faqA1: "Yes, 10g of any sugar (brown, white, or caster) converts to roughly 0.35 ounces. However, brown sugar is denser when packed, so always measure by weight for precision in air fryer recipes."
faqQ2: "Can I use volume measurements instead of weight for 10g of brown sugar?"
faqA2: "While possible (about 2 tsp for 10g), weight is far more accurate. Air fryer recipes often rely on precise sugar amounts for texture and caramelisation, so scales are best."
faqQ3: "Why do UK air fryer recipes use grams instead of ounces?"
faqA3: "Grams are the standard metric measurement in the UK, offering greater precision for small quantities like 10g of brown sugar. Ounces are more common in older or US-based recipes."
faqQ4: "How do I store brown sugar to keep it fresh for air fryer recipes?"
faqA4: "Keep brown sugar in an airtight container with a terra cotta disc or marshmallow to prevent hardening. Proper storage ensures accurate 10g measurements every time."

<h2>Why converting 10g brown sugar to ounces matters</h2>  
<p>Many UK recipes, especially those for air fryers, use grams, while some older cookbooks or international recipes might list ingredients in ounces.

<p>Brown sugar is slightly denser than white sugar, so weight matters more than volume. Whether you’re making a sticky marinade or a cake batter, 10g of brown sugar (0.35 oz) should be measured precisely. This is especially important for air fryer recipes, where even small imbalances can affect crispiness or caramelisation.</p>  

<h2>How to measure 10g of brown sugar without scales</h2>  
<p>If you don’t have digital scales, you can still measure 10g of brown sugar (0.35 oz) using spoons. One packed tablespoon of brown sugar is roughly 12-15g, so a slightly heaped teaspoon (about 4g) plus a level teaspoon (about 4g) will get you close. For exact measurements, we recommend investing in a small kitchen scale—especially if you love <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer desserts</a>.</p>

<h3>Does brown sugar type affect the weight?</h3>  
<p>Light and dark brown sugar have almost identical weights, so 10g of either will still be 0.35 ounces. However, moist, fresh brown sugar packs more tightly than older, dried-out sugar. If your sugar has hardened, break it up before measuring for accuracy in air fryer recipes.</p>

faqQ1: "Can I use minced garlic instead of garlic paste in my air fryer recipes?"
faqA1: "Yes, you can substitute minced garlic for garlic paste, but the texture and intensity will differ. Garlic paste is smoother and more concentrated, so you may need to adjust the quantity. For 1000g of garlic paste (35.27 oz), use about 800g of minced garlic for a similar flavour profile."
faqQ2: "How long does 1000g of garlic paste last in the fridge?"
faqA2: "When stored properly in an airtight container, 1000g of garlic paste can last up to two weeks in the fridge. For longer storage, freezing is recommended. Portion it into smaller amounts (like 100g or 3.5 oz) for easy use in future air fryer recipes."
faqQ3: "Is 1000g of garlic paste the same as 1000ml?"
faqA3: "No, grams and millilitres measure different things. While 1000g of garlic paste is roughly 1000ml in volume due to its density, weight (grams) is more accurate for cooking. Always weigh ingredients like garlic paste for precise air fryer results."
faqQ4: "What’s the best way to measure 1000g of garlic paste without a scale?"
faqA4: "Without a scale, you can estimate 1000g of garlic paste using measuring cups. It’s roughly 2.5 UK cups (400ml each), but this method isn’t as precise. Investing in a digital scale ensures accuracy, especially for air fryer recipes where measurements matter."

<h2>Why Convert 1000g of Garlic Paste to Ounces?</h2>  
<p>Many UK recipes, especially those for air fryers, use grams as the standard measurement. However, some older recipes or international guides might list ingredients in ounces. Converting 1000g of garlic paste to ounces (35.27 oz) ensures you’re using the right amount for your dish. This is particularly useful when preparing large batches or meal prepping for the week.</p>  
<p>If you’re using an air fryer, precise measurements can affect cooking times and textures. Too much garlic paste might make your dish overly pungent, while too little could leave it bland.

<h2>How to Measure 1000g of Garlic Paste Accurately</h2>  
<p>Using a digital kitchen scale is the easiest way to measure 1000g of garlic paste. Simply place your container on the scale, tare it to zero, and spoon in the paste until you reach 1000g. If you don’t have a scale, you can estimate using volume, but this method is less precise.</p>  
<p>Garlic paste is dense, so 1000g will fill roughly 2.5 standard UK measuring cups (about 400ml each). However, for air fryer recipes, we always recommend weighing ingredients for consistency.

<h2>Storing Leftover Garlic Paste</h2>

faqQ1: "Can I use a measuring cup instead of a scale for 30g of almond milk?"
faqA1: "Yes, but it’s less precise. 30g of almond milk is roughly two tablespoons or 30ml. For baking or sauces where accuracy matters, a digital scale is best. Measuring cups can vary slightly, especially with thicker almond milk varieties."
faqQ2: "Why do some recipes use grams and others use ounces for almond milk?"
faqA2: "Grams are standard in the UK and Europe, while ounces are more common in the US. Recipes on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> typically use grams, but we include conversions for flexibility. Always check which unit your recipe uses to avoid mistakes."
faqQ3: "Does 30g of almond milk have the same volume as dairy milk?"
faqA3: "Almond milk is slightly lighter than dairy milk, but 30g of both will have similar volumes (about 1.06 oz). However, almond milk may froth or separate differently when heated, so adjust cooking times in your air fryer accordingly."
faqQ4: "How do I convert larger amounts of almond milk from grams to ounces?"
faqA4: "Multiply the grams by 0.035 to get ounces. For example, 100g of almond milk equals 3.5 oz. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a> covers common measurements for quick reference."

<h2>Why Convert 30g of Almond Milk to Ounces?</h2>

faqQ1: "How many tablespoons is 30g of minced garlic?"
faqA1: "30g of minced garlic is roughly two tablespoons, but this can vary based on how finely it’s chopped. For air fryer recipes, weighing ensures accuracy, especially since garlic’s intensity affects flavour balance."
faqQ2: "Does jarred minced garlic weigh the same as fresh?"
faqA2: "Jarred minced garlic often contains added water or oil, so 30g may have slightly less garlic than fresh. For precise air fryer cooking, adjust quantities or opt for fresh minced garlic when possible."
faqQ3: "Can I use garlic powder instead of 30g minced garlic?"
faqA3: "Yes, but the conversion differs. One teaspoon of garlic powder replaces one clove (about 5g minced garlic). For 30g, you’d need six teaspoons, though powder lacks the texture of fresh minced garlic."
faqQ4: "Why does my air fryer garlic burn so quickly?"
faqA4: "Minced garlic burns easily due to its small size and high sugar content. To prevent this, mix it with oil or add it later in the cooking process. Check our air fryer timing guide for optimal results."

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter</h2>

<p>Many UK cooks prefer weighing ingredients for precision, especially with potent flavours like garlic. A digital kitchen scale is a must for air fryer enthusiasts. If you’re adapting a recipe from grams to ounces, this conversion ensures you stay on track.

<h3>How to Measure Minced Garlic Without a Scale</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a scale, 30g of minced garlic is roughly two tablespoons. However, this can vary based on how finely the garlic is chopped. For air fryer dishes, we recommend weighing for consistency. Pre-minced garlic from jars often has added moisture, so adjust accordingly.

<h2>Common Uses for 30g of Minced Garlic</h2>

faqQ1: "Can I use jarred minced garlic instead of fresh for 15g measurements?"
faqA1: "Yes, jarred minced garlic works fine for 15g measurements, though fresh garlic has a stronger flavour. Just ensure you drain excess liquid if using jarred garlic, as it can affect the weight."
faqQ2: "How many cloves of garlic make 15g of minced garlic?"
faqA2: "Around 3 medium-sized garlic cloves yield roughly 15g of minced garlic. This can vary slightly depending on the size of the cloves, so a scale is best for accuracy."

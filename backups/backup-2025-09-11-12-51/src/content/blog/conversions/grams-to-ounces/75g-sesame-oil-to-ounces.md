faqQ1: "Can I use volume measurements instead of weight for 75g sesame oil?"
faqA1: "While you can use tablespoons (roughly 5.3 tbsp for 75g), weight measurements are more accurate for sesame oil. Its density varies slightly between brands, so scales give consistent results, especially important for air fryer recipes where oil quantity affects crispiness."
faqQ2: "Does 75g of toasted sesame oil equal the same in ounces as regular sesame oil?"
faqA2: "Yes, 75g of any type of sesame oil (toasted or untoasted) converts to approximately 2.65 ounces. However, toasted sesame oil has a stronger flavour, so you might use slightly less in recipes compared to the milder untoasted variety."
faqQ3: "How long will 75g of sesame oil last in air fryer cooking?"
faqA3: "75g (2.65 oz) of sesame oil typically coats 2-3 portions of protein or vegetables in the air fryer. Since it’s flavourful, you often need less than with neutral oils. Stored properly, an opened bottle lasts about 6 months before quality declines."
faqQ4: "Why does my air fryer recipe specify grams instead of ounces for sesame oil?"
faqA4: "Many professional recipes use grams for precision, as weight measurements are more consistent than volume. This is especially useful in air frying, where exact oil quantities affect cooking performance. Converting 75g to ounces (2.65 oz) ensures accuracy when following international recipes."

<p>75g of sesame oil equals approximately 2.65 ounces. This conversion is essential for air fryer cooking, where precise measurements can make or break a recipe. Whether you’re whipping up crispy tofu or marinating chicken, knowing how to convert grams to ounces ensures perfect results every time.

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of sesame oil can affect texture, flavour, and cooking time in your air fryer. Too little oil, and your food might turn out dry; too much, and it could become greasy. For example, recipes like sesame-crusted salmon or crispy vegetables rely on precise oil quantities for that perfect crunch. If you’re experimenting with new dishes, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> offer tested measurements for foolproof results.</p>  

<p>Sesame oil is denser than some other oils, so 75g takes up slightly less volume than you might expect. This is why weight measurements (grams) are often more reliable than volume (cups or tablespoons) for consistent cooking. If you’re meal prepping or scaling recipes, converting 75g sesame oil to ounces ensures accuracy across batches.</p>  

<h3>How to measure 75g of sesame oil without scales</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a kitchen scale, you can use volume measurements as a rough guide. One tablespoon of sesame oil weighs around 14g, so 75g is roughly 5.3 tablespoons. However, this method isn’t as precise as weighing, especially for recipes where balance is key, like marinades or dressings. For best results, invest in a digital scale—it’s a game-changer for air fryer cooking.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for 75g of sesame oil in air fryer recipes</h2>  
<p>This quantity is perfect for coating proteins or vegetables before air frying. Try it in our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>sesame chicken recipe</a>, where 75g of oil helps create a glossy, flavourful glaze. You could also use it to roast potatoes or tofu, giving them a rich, nutty taste. Since sesame oil has a low smoke point, it’s best used for low-temperature air frying or as a finishing oil.</p>  

<p>Another great use for 75g of sesame oil is in homemade air fryer sauces or dips. Mix it with soy sauce, garlic, and ginger for a quick stir-fry base, or drizzle it over cooked dishes for extra aroma. Just remember—a little goes a long way with sesame oil, so 2.65 ounces (75g) can often cover multiple servings.</p>  

<h3>Storing sesame oil for air fryer cooking</h3>  
<p>To keep your sesame oil fresh, store it in a cool, dark place away from heat sources. Over time, oil can degrade, affecting both flavour and cooking performance. If you’re using 75g portions frequently, consider decanting into smaller bottles to minimise exposure to air. Proper storage ensures your oil stays ready for those last-minute <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable air fryer recipes</a>.</p>  

<h2>Converting other sesame oil quantities</h2>  
<p>Need to adjust your recipe? Here’s a quick reference: 50g = 1.76 oz, 100g = 3.53 oz, and 150g = 5.29 oz. These conversions are handy when scaling recipes up or down for your air fryer’s capacity.

<p>Remember that different brands of sesame oil can vary slightly in density, especially between toasted and untoasted varieties. When precision matters, always weigh your oil rather than relying on volume conversions alone. This attention to detail will elevate your air fryer dishes from good to restaurant-quality.</p>

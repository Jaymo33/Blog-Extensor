faqQ1: "Can I use white sugar instead of brown sugar in air fryer recipes?"
faqA1: "While you can substitute white sugar, brown sugar adds moisture and a caramel-like flavour that’s hard to replicate. If substituting, use slightly less white sugar (about 35g instead of 40g) and consider adding a teaspoon of molasses for similar results."
faqQ2: "How do I measure 40g of brown sugar if I don’t have metric scales?"
faqA2: "Without scales, packed brown sugar measures about 8 level teaspoons or just under 3 tablespoons for 40g. However, for baking in your air fryer where precision matters, we strongly recommend using digital scales for the most accurate results."
faqQ3: "Does brown sugar behave differently in an air fryer compared to regular ovens?"
faqA3: "Brown sugar can caramelise faster in an air fryer due to the concentrated heat circulation. When recipes call for 40g of brown sugar, you might need to reduce cooking time slightly or lower the temperature by about 10°C to prevent over-browning."
faqQ4: "Why do UK recipes often use grams instead of ounces for sugar measurements?"
faqA4: "The UK officially uses metric measurements, making grams the standard for baking precision. Since air fryer cooking requires accurate measurements for best results, grams provide more consistency than volume measurements like cups or ounces."

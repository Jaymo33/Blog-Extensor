faqQ1: "Is 125g of granulated sugar the same as 125ml?"
faqA1: "No, 125g of granulated sugar is not the same as 125ml. Weight (grams) and volume (millilitres) measure different properties. While 125g of granulated sugar equals about 4.41 ounces, its volume would be approximately 150ml due to how the granules pack together. For air fryer recipes, always weigh ingredients when possible for accuracy."
faqQ2: "Can I use caster sugar instead of granulated sugar in air fryer recipes?"
faqA2: "Yes, you can substitute caster sugar for granulated sugar in air fryer recipes, but the measurement differs slightly. While 125g of granulated sugar equals 4.41 ounces, caster sugar is finer and slightly denser. You might need to adjust by about 5-10% less when converting grams to ounces for caster sugar in air fryer baking."
faqQ3: "Why do my air fryer cookies with 125g sugar burn on top?"
faqA3: "If cookies with 125g (4.41 ounces) of sugar are burning in your air fryer, try reducing the temperature by 10-15°C. The intense, direct heat of air fryers causes sugar to caramelise faster than in conventional ovens. Also consider using parchment paper and checking progress a few minutes before the recipe suggests."
faqQ4: "How does altitude affect 125g sugar measurements in air fryer baking?"
faqA4: "At higher altitudes, you might need to slightly reduce the 125g (4.41 ounces) of sugar in air fryer recipes. The lower air pressure causes sugar to have greater sweetening power. Start with about 5% less sugar and adjust to taste, as air fryers already intensify flavours due to their concentrated cooking environment."

<h2>Why accurate sugar measurements matter in air fryer baking</h2>
<p>Air fryers cook food differently than conventional ovens, often requiring adjustments to ingredient quantities. Using the correct amount of granulated sugar (125g or 4.41 ounces) ensures your baked goods have the right texture and sweetness. Too much sugar can cause over-browning, while too little may result in dry or bland results.</p>
<p>Many popular air fryer recipes, like those found on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, specify measurements in grams. Converting 125g of granulated sugar to ounces (4.41 oz) helps when using American recipes or kitchen scales that only display ounces. This small but crucial step can elevate your air fryer baking game significantly.</p>

<h2>How to measure 125g of granulated sugar without scales</h2>
<p>If you don't have digital scales, you can still measure 125g of granulated sugar using volume measurements. Approximately 125g equals 10 UK tablespoons or ⅔ cup of granulated sugar. However, for the most accurate results in air fryer cooking, we recommend investing in a good set of kitchen scales.</p>
<p>When preparing air fryer desserts like those in our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>cake recipes</a>, precise sugar measurements ensure consistent results. The compact cooking space of an air fryer means ingredient ratios are even more critical than in traditional oven baking.</p>

<h3>The science behind sugar in air fryer baking</h3>
<p>Granulated sugar does more than just sweeten your air fryer creations. At 125g (4.41 ounces), it contributes to browning, texture, and moisture retention. The rapid air circulation in air fryers causes sugar to caramelise faster, which is why getting the 125g measurement exactly right is so important.</p>

<h2>Converting other common sugar quantities</h2>
<p>While 125g of granulated sugar equals 4.41 ounces, you might need to convert other amounts too. For example, 100g is about 3.53 ounces, and 150g equals roughly 5.29 ounces. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> makes these calculations simple for all your baking needs.</p>
<p>Remember that different types of sugar have varying weights. The 125g to 4.41 ounce conversion applies specifically to granulated sugar. Icing sugar or brown sugar packed differently would yield different ounce measurements for the same gram weight.</p>

<h3>Tips for working with sugar in your air fryer</h3>
<p>When using 125g (4.41 ounces) of granulated sugar in air fryer recipes, consider reducing the temperature slightly to prevent over-browning. The concentrated heat can cause sugar to caramelise more quickly than in conventional ovens. Always preheat your air fryer for even cooking when working with sugar-based recipes.</p>

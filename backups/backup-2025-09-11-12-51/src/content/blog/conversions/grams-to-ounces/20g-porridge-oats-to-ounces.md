faqQ1: "Can I use cups instead of grams or ounces for porridge oats?"
faqA1: "Yes, but cups measure volume, not weight, so accuracy varies. For 20g of porridge oats, use roughly ¼ cup (lightly spooned, not packed). For precise air fryer recipes, weighing in grams or ounces is best."
faqQ2: "Why do some recipes use ounces and others grams for oats?"
faqA2: "Recipes vary by region—the UK typically uses grams, while the US often uses ounces. Always check the recipe origin and convert if needed. Our conversion tools at airfryerrecipe.co.uk make it easy."
faqQ3: "Does the type of oat affect the weight conversion?"
faqA3: "Slightly—rolled oats and quick oats have similar weights, but steel-cut oats are denser. For 20g of standard porridge oats, the 0.71-ounce conversion applies. Adjust if using a different variety."
faqQ4: "How do I store leftover porridge oats after measuring?"
faqA4: "Keep oats in an airtight container in a cool, dry place. Proper storage prevents moisture and pests. For long-term freshness, consider freezing portions in sealed bags."

<h2>Why Convert 20g of Porridge Oats to Ounces?</h2>  
<p>Many UK recipes use grams, but some kitchen scales or international recipes might list ounces instead. Converting 20g of porridge oats to ounces ensures you’re using the right amount, especially in air fryer cooking where precise measurements matter. Too much or too little can affect cooking times and textures. For example, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer breakfast recipes</a> often call for exact oat quantities to achieve the perfect crunch.</p>  

<p>Porridge oats are a staple in many households, and knowing their weight in ounces helps when following American or older British recipes. A digital scale is your best friend here, but if you don’t have one, our conversion guide will save the day. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more handy measurements.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure 20g of Porridge Oats Without a Scale</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a scale, you can use tablespoons to measure 20g of porridge oats. Roughly 3 level tablespoons equal 20g, which is about 0.71 ounces. This method isn’t as precise as weighing, but it works in a pinch. For best results, fluff the oats lightly before scooping to avoid compacting them.</p>  

<h2>Using 20g of Porridge Oats in Air Fryer Recipes</h2>  
<p>Porridge oats are versatile in air fryer cooking, from crunchy toppings to oat-based bakes. For instance, 20g of oats can be toasted in the air fryer for a crispy garnish on yoghurt or desserts.

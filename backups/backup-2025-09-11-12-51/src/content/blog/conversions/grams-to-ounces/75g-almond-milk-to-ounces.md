faqQ1: "Can I use a measuring cup instead of a scale for 75g almond milk?"
faqA1: "Yes, but a scale is more accurate. 75g of almond milk is roughly ⅓ cup or 5 tablespoons. However, slight variations in density between brands can affect the measurement. For best results, especially in baking, use a digital scale."
faqQ2: "Does 75g of almond milk weigh the same as 75g of dairy milk?"
faqA2: "No, because almond milk is less dense than dairy milk. While both measure 75g by weight, their volumes differ slightly. Always weigh ingredients for air fryer recipes to ensure consistency, especially when substituting dairy with almond milk."
faqQ3: "How do I convert 75g almond milk to ounces for US recipes?"
faqA3: "The conversion is the same: 75g equals approximately 2.65 ounces. US and UK ounces are identical for liquid measurements. Just ensure your recipe doesn’t confuse fluid ounces with weight ounces, as they’re not interchangeable."
faqQ4: "Can I use 75g of almond milk in savoury air fryer dishes?"
faqA4: "Absolutely! Almond milk works well in savoury recipes like creamy sauces or marinades. For example, 75g can thin out a spice paste for air-fried chicken or add moisture to a breadcrumb coating.

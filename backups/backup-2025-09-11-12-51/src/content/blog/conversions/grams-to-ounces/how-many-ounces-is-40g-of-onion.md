faqQ1: "Can I use cups instead of grams to measure 40g of onion?"
faqA1: "While you can estimate 40g of onion as roughly 1/3 cup when chopped, this method isn’t as precise as weighing. Onion density varies depending on how finely it’s chopped, so a kitchen scale is recommended for accuracy, especially in air fryer recipes."
faqQ2: "How many onions do I need for 40g?"
faqA2: "One small onion typically weighs 70-100g, so 40g is about half of a small onion. If using a medium onion (around 150g), you’d need roughly a quarter of it to reach 40g. Always weigh for the most accurate measurement."
faqQ3: "Does the type of onion affect the weight conversion?"
faqA3: "No, the conversion from grams to ounces is the same regardless of onion type (red, white, or yellow). However, different onions vary in size and density, so weighing is still the best method for precise measurements in air fryer cooking."
faqQ4: "Why is 40g of onion a common measurement in recipes?"
faqA4: "40g is a practical amount for adding flavour without overpowering a dish. It’s enough for 2-3 servings, making it ideal for air fryer recipes where space is limited. This measurement balances taste and texture perfectly in most dishes."

This precision is especially important for air fryer cooking, where even heat distribution relies on uniform ingredient sizes.</p>

<p>Storing onions correctly also ensures accurate measurements. Keep them in a cool, dry place to prevent moisture loss, which can affect weight.

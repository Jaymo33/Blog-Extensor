faqQ1: "Is 125g of milk the same as 125ml?"

faqQ2: "Can I use US ounces for UK recipes?"

faqQ3: "How do I measure 125g of milk without scales?"
faqA3: "Use a measuring jug with metric markings—125g of milk is about 122ml. For imperial, 4.41 oz is just under half a US cup. Always check your jug’s accuracy for best results."
faqQ4: "Why does milk weight matter in air fryer recipes?"

faqQ1: "Can I use honey instead of agave syrup in air fryer recipes?"
faqA1: "Yes, you can substitute honey for agave syrup, but adjust the quantity slightly. Honey is denser, so 125g equals about 4.23 ounces. Reduce cooking time slightly to prevent burning due to honey’s higher sugar content."
faqQ2: "How do I clean agave syrup residue from my air fryer basket?"
faqA2: "Mix warm water with a mild dish soap and let the basket soak for 10 minutes. Use a soft sponge to gently scrub away sticky residue. Avoid abrasive cleaners to protect non-stick coatings."
faqQ3: "Does agave syrup burn easily in the air fryer?"
faqA3: "Agave syrup caramelises at high temperatures, so watch cooking times closely. For glazes, brush it on in the last few minutes of cooking. Lower temperatures (around 160°C) work best for even browning."
faqQ4: "Where can I find air fryer recipes using agave syrup?"
faqA4: "Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipes section</a> features multiple dishes using agave syrup, from glazes to desserts. Filter by \"sweeteners\" or browse our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert category</a> for inspiration."

<p>125g of agave syrup equals approximately 4.41 ounces. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements can make or break your dish. Whether you’re drizzling it over roasted vegetables or using it as a sweetener in baked goods, knowing the exact weight ensures consistency. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we focus on making conversions simple so you can cook with confidence.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Using the correct amount of agave syrup ensures your dishes aren’t too sweet or lacking flavour. Air fryers cook quickly, so imbalances in ingredients can be more noticeable. For example, a glaze with too much syrup might burn, while too little won’t caramelise properly. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for other common ingredient conversions. Precision is key, especially when adapting recipes for smaller or larger batches.</p>  

<p>Agave syrup is denser than water, so volume measurements like cups can be misleading. Weight measurements, such as grams or ounces, provide accuracy. If you’re working with 125g of agave syrup, a digital kitchen scale is your best friend. For more tips on perfecting air fryer recipes, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a>.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure 125g of Agave Syrup Without a Scale</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a scale, you can use tablespoons for a rough estimate. One tablespoon of agave syrup weighs about 21g, so 125g would be roughly 6 tablespoons. However, this method isn’t as precise, so we recommend investing in a scale for best results. For sticky ingredients like agave syrup, lightly greasing your measuring spoon can help it slide off easily.</p>

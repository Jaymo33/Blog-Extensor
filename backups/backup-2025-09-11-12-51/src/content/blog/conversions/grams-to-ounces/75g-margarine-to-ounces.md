faqQ1: "Can I use butter instead of margarine for 75g in air fryer recipes?"
faqA1: "Yes, you can substitute butter for margarine in a 1:1 ratio. However, butter has a slightly higher fat content, which may affect browning and texture. For best results, monitor cooking times closely, as butter can burn faster in an air fryer."
faqQ2: "How do I measure 75g of margarine without a scale?"
faqA2: "If you don’t have a scale, use the markings on a margarine tub (usually 15g per tablespoon). For 75g, you’d need about 5 tablespoons. Alternatively, a standard UK block of margarine often has measurement lines for easy cutting."
faqQ3: "Does 75g of margarine equal 75ml?"
faqA3: "No, grams measure weight, while millilitres measure volume. The conversion depends on density—75g of margarine is roughly 78ml, but it’s best to weigh it for accuracy, especially in baking."
faqQ4: "Can I use oil instead of 75g margarine in air fryer recipes?"
faqA4: "Yes, but the substitution ratio varies. For 75g of margarine, use about 60ml of oil. Note that oil lacks the emulsifiers in margarine, which may alter texture in baked goods. For frying, oil works well but may require adjusting temperatures."

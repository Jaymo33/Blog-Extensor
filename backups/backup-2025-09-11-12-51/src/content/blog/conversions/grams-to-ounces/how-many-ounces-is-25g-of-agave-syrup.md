faqQ1: "Is 25g of agave syrup the same as 25ml?"
faqA1: "No, 25g of agave syrup is not the same as 25ml. While they're close in volume, agave syrup is denser than water. 25g of agave syrup equals about 18-19ml, not 25ml. For accurate air fryer recipes, it's best to measure by weight (25g or 0.88 ounces) rather than volume."
faqQ2: "Can I use honey instead of 25g agave syrup in air fryer recipes?"
faqA2: "Yes, you can substitute honey for 25g (0.88 ounces) of agave syrup in most air fryer recipes. Use the same weight measurement, but be aware honey is slightly sweeter and may brown faster. Reduce air fryer temperature by 5-10°C when substituting to prevent over-browning."
faqQ3: "How many calories are in 25g of agave syrup?"
faqA3: "There are approximately 75 calories in 25g (0.88 ounces) of agave syrup. While it's a natural sweetener, it's still high in sugar, so use sparingly in air fryer recipes. The 25g measurement helps control portion sizes when creating healthier versions of sweet treats."
faqQ4: "Why do some air fryer recipes use grams instead of ounces?"
faqA4: "Many air fryer recipes use grams because metric measurements are more precise for small quantities like 25g of agave syrup. Digital scales can measure grams more accurately than fluid ounces, especially for sticky ingredients. However, knowing that 25g equals 0.88 ounces helps when using different recipe sources."

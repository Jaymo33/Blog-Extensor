faqQ1: "Why is it better to measure sesame oil by weight rather than volume?"
faqA1: "Measuring sesame oil by weight (grams or ounces) is more accurate than using volume (millilitres or cups) because oils can vary in density. Weight measurements ensure consistency in recipes, especially important for air fryer cooking where precise amounts affect texture and browning."
faqQ2: "Can I use the same conversion for other types of oil?"
faqA2: "While the conversion from grams to ounces is the same (1g = 0.035 ounces), different oils have slightly different densities. For most cooking purposes, the difference is negligible, but for baking or precise recipes, it's best to measure each oil separately."
faqQ3: "How should I store sesame oil for air fryer cooking?"
faqA3: "Sesame oil should be stored in a cool, dark place to prevent rancidity. The refrigerator is ideal for long-term storage, though it may thicken slightly. Bring it to room temperature before measuring 40g (1.41 ounces) for your air fryer recipes."
faqQ4: "What's the best way to measure small amounts of sesame oil for air fryer recipes?"
faqA4: "For small amounts like 40g (1.41 ounces) of sesame oil, a digital kitchen scale is most accurate. If you don't have scales, use measuring spoons - approximately 2 tablespoons plus 2 teaspoons equals 40g, though weighing is always more precise."

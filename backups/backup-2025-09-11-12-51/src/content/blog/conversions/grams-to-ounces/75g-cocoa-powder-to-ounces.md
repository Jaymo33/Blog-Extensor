<h2>Why accurate cocoa powder measurements matter</h2>

<p>Many UK bakers prefer using grams, while others rely on ounces. Knowing both measurements allows you to adapt recipes effortlessly. If you’re using an air fryer for baking, precision is even more critical due to its compact cooking space. A slight miscalculation can affect cooking times and results. That’s why we recommend using a digital scale for the most accurate 75g cocoa powder to ounces conversion.</p>

<p>If you don’t have a kitchen scale, you can still measure 75g of cocoa powder using volume measurements. One tablespoon of cocoa powder weighs roughly 7g, so 75g would be about 10.5 tablespoons. However, this method isn’t as precise as weighing, as cocoa powder can settle or fluff up. For best results, especially in air fryer recipes, investing in a scale is worthwhile.</p>

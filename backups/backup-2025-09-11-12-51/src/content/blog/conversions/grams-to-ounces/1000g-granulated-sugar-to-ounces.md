faqQ1: "Is 1000g of granulated sugar the same as 1kg?"
faqA1: "Yes, 1000g of granulated sugar is exactly 1 kilogram. This makes conversions easier, as 1kg equals approximately 35.27 ounces. Whether you’re measuring for air fryer recipes or other baking, the two units are interchangeable."
faqQ2: "Can I use a measuring cup instead of a scale for 1000g of sugar?"
faqA2: "While you can use a measuring cup, it’s less precise. One cup of granulated sugar weighs about 200g, so 1000g would be roughly 5 cups. For air fryer recipes, where accuracy matters, a kitchen scale is recommended to avoid inconsistencies in texture or sweetness."
faqQ3: "Why does sugar weight matter more in air fryer baking?"
faqA3: "Air fryers cook faster and at higher heat than conventional ovens, so precise sugar measurements prevent over-browning or burning. Too much sugar can caramelise too quickly, while too little may not provide enough structure or sweetness."
faqQ4: "How do I store leftover granulated sugar after measuring 1000g?"
faqA4: "Store granulated sugar in an airtight container in a cool, dry place. This prevents clumping and moisture absorption, ensuring it stays fresh for future air fryer recipes. Avoid storing near strong odours, as sugar can absorb them."

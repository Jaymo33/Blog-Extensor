faqQ1: "Can I use butter instead of margarine in air fryer recipes?"
faqA1: "Yes, you can substitute butter for margarine in most air fryer recipes. However, butter has a lower water content, so you may need to adjust cooking times slightly to prevent burning. Use the same weight (15g of butter equals 0.53 oz) for accurate results."
faqQ2: "Why do UK recipes use grams instead of ounces?"
faqA2: "The UK primarily uses the metric system, so grams are the standard for precise baking and cooking measurements. Ounces are more common in the US, but converting between the two is simple with a digital scale or conversion chart."
faqQ3: "How do I clean margarine residue from my air fryer basket?"
faqA3: "To remove margarine residue, wipe the basket with a warm, soapy cloth or use a dedicated <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner</a>. Avoid harsh scrubbing to prevent damaging non-stick coatings."
faqQ4: "Does margarine affect cooking times in the air fryer?"
faqA4: "Margarine can slightly reduce cooking times by helping food brown faster. However, using too much may cause smoke, so stick to recommended amounts like 15g (0.53 oz) for best results. Always monitor your dish to avoid overcooking."

faqQ1: "Is 125g of cream the same as 125ml?"
faqA1: "No, 125g of cream isn’t identical to 125ml. While they’re close, cream’s density means 125g equals about 122ml. Weight (grams/ounces) is more accurate for baking than volume measurements."
faqQ2: "Can I use fluid ounces to measure 125g of cream?"
faqA2: "Fluid ounces measure volume, not weight. For 125g cream (4.41 weight ounces), you’d need about 4.3 UK fluid ounces. Always use weight measurements for precise air fryer recipes."
faqQ3: "How many calories are in 125g of double cream?"
faqA3: "125g of double cream contains approximately 450 calories. For lighter options, single cream has about 250 calories per 125g. Our air fryer recipes often suggest healthier cream alternatives."
faqQ4: "Does 125g of whipped cream equal 125g liquid cream?"
faqA4: "Yes, 125g is 125g regardless of state – but whipped cream occupies more volume. When measuring whipped cream by volume, you’ll get less actual cream than the liquid equivalent."

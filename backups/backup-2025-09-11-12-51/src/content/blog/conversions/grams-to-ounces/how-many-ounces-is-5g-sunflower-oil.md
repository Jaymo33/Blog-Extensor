faqQ1: "How accurate is the conversion of 5g sunflower oil to ounces?"
faqA1: "The conversion of 5g sunflower oil to 0.18 ounces is highly accurate, based on standard measurement standards. Small variations may occur due to oil density or temperature, but for cooking purposes, this conversion is reliable."
faqQ2: "Can I use a tablespoon to measure 5g of sunflower oil instead of a scale?"
faqA2: "While a teaspoon roughly equals 5g of sunflower oil, weighing it is more precise. Tablespoons vary in size, so for best results, use a digital scale. If you don’t have one, a level teaspoon is a close approximation."
faqQ3: "Why is sunflower oil recommended for air fryers?"
faqA3: "Sunflower oil has a high smoke point, making it ideal for air frying at high temperatures. Its neutral flavour also won’t overpower your dishes. Plus, you often need less oil in an air fryer compared to deep frying."
faqQ4: "Do I need to convert grams to ounces for all air fryer recipes?"
faqA4: "Not necessarily—many UK recipes use grams, but converting to ounces can help if your scale uses imperial units. Consistency in measurement matters more than the unit itself for successful air frying."

faqQ1: "Is 15g of plain yogurt the same as 15ml?"
faqA1: "No, 15g of plain yogurt isn’t identical to 15ml. While they’re close for thin yogurts, thicker varieties like Greek yogurt will differ. Weight (grams) is always more accurate than volume (ml) for consistent results in air fryer recipes."
faqQ2: "Can I use flavoured yogurt instead of plain for air fryer recipes?"
faqA2: "You can, but flavoured yogurts may alter your dish’s taste and sugar content. For savoury recipes like marinades, plain yogurt works best. If substituting, adjust other seasonings accordingly to balance flavours."
faqQ3: "How do I measure 15g of yogurt if my scales only do whole ounces?"
faqA3: "Round 0.53 ounces to the nearest practical measure – about half an ounce. For most air fryer recipes, this small variance won’t significantly impact results. Alternatively, use the tablespoon method mentioned earlier."
faqQ4: "Does yogurt weight change when frozen for air fryer recipes?"
faqA4: "Yes, frozen yogurt expands slightly, but the weight (15g) remains the same. Thaw completely and stir before measuring for accuracy. Frozen yogurt works well in some air fryer desserts, though texture may differ slightly from fresh."

faqQ1: "Is 50g of coconut oil the same as 50ml?"
faqA1: "No, 50g of coconut oil is not the same as 50ml. Weight (grams) and volume (millilitres) measure different properties. Since coconut oil’s density varies with temperature, 50g equals roughly 55ml in its liquid state but less when solid. Always weigh for accuracy in air fryer recipes."
faqQ2: "Can I use olive oil instead of coconut oil in my air fryer?"
faqA2: "Yes, you can substitute olive oil, but adjust the amount. Olive oil is less dense, so 50g (1.76 oz) of coconut oil equals about 2 tablespoons of olive oil. Note that olive oil has a lower smoke point, so it’s better for lower-temperature air frying."
faqQ3: "How do I store coconut oil for air fryer use?"
faqA3: "Store coconut oil in a cool, dark place. It solidifies below 24°C but melts easily when warmed. For easy measuring, keep it at room temperature if your kitchen is warm, or gently melt the needed amount (like 50g/1.76 oz) before use."
faqQ4: "Why does my air fryer smoke when using coconut oil?"
faqA4: "Smoking usually occurs if the oil is overheated. Coconut oil’s smoke point is around 177°C, so avoid exceeding this temperature. Also, ensure you’re using the right amount—50g (1.76 oz) is plenty for most recipes without causing excess smoke. Clean your air fryer regularly to prevent buildup."

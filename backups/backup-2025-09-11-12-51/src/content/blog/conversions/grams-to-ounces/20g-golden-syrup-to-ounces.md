faqQ1: "Can I use honey instead of golden syrup in air fryer recipes?"
faqA1: "Yes, honey can substitute golden syrup in most recipes, but adjust the quantity slightly. Since honey is sweeter, use about 15g (0.53 oz) for every 20g (0.71 oz) of golden syrup. Note that honey may brown faster in the air fryer due to its higher fructose content."
faqQ2: "How do I clean golden syrup from my air fryer basket?"
faqA2: "Soak the basket in warm, soapy water to loosen sticky residue. For stubborn spots, use a soft sponge or brush. Avoid abrasive cleaners that could damage non-stick coatings. Check our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning guide</a> for detailed tips."
faqQ3: "Why is my air fryer recipe too sweet with 20g of golden syrup?"
faqA3: "Golden syrup’s sweetness varies by brand. If your dish is overly sweet, reduce the syrup to 15g (0.53 oz) next time. Alternatively, balance it with acidic ingredients like lemon juice or vinegar in marinades."
faqQ4: "Can I measure golden syrup by volume instead of weight?"
faqA4: "While possible, weight (grams/ounces) is more accurate due to golden syrup’s thickness. If using volume, 20g ≈ 1 tablespoon minus a teaspoon. For precision, especially in baking, a kitchen scale is best."

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>

<p>Golden syrup’s viscosity makes it tricky to measure, so using a digital scale is ideal. If you don’t have one, a tablespoon holds roughly 25g (0.88 oz), meaning 20g is just under a full spoon. For sticky ingredients like this, lightly greasing your measuring spoon helps it slide off easily.

<h3>How to measure 20g of golden syrup without scales</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a scale, use the spoon method: 1 tablespoon ≈ 25g, so 20g is about 4/5 of a tablespoon. For smaller amounts, a teaspoon holds roughly 7g (0.25 oz), so 20g would be just under 3 teaspoons. Remember, these are approximations—investing in a scale guarantees precision.

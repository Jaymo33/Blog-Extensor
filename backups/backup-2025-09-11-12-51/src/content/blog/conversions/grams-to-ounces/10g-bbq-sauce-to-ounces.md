faqQ1: "Can I use 10g of BBQ sauce for air fryer ribs?"
faqA1: "Absolutely! 10g (0.35 oz) of BBQ sauce is ideal for coating a small rack of ribs or a few pork strips in the air fryer. Apply it during the last 5 minutes of cooking to avoid burning. For stickier results, brush on an extra thin layer after flipping."
faqQ2: "How do I convert 20g of BBQ sauce to ounces?"
faqA2: "20g of BBQ sauce equals roughly 0.7 ounces. Simply double the 10g-to-ounces conversion (0.35 oz x 2). This scaling works for any quantity—just multiply grams by 0.035 to get ounces."
faqQ3: "Why does my BBQ sauce burn in the air fryer?"
faqA3: "BBQ sauce contains sugar, which caramelises quickly under high heat. Using precisely 10g (0.35 oz) and applying it late in cooking prevents burning. Also, ensure your air fryer isn’t overcrowded, as poor airflow can cause hotspots."
faqQ4: "Is 10g of BBQ sauce enough for a single serving?"
faqA4: "Yes, 10g (0.35 oz) provides ample flavour for one portion, like a chicken breast or veggie skewer. For heartier dishes, increase to 15–20g. Remember, air fryers intensify flavours, so you often need less sauce than with traditional cooking."

<h2>Why Convert 10g of BBQ Sauce to Ounces?</h2>  
<p>Many UK recipes use grams, but some air fryer guides or international cookbooks might list ingredients in ounces. Converting 10g of BBQ sauce to ounces (0.35 oz) helps avoid guesswork. This is especially useful when following precise recipes, like those for sticky ribs or glazed tofu found in our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipes section</a>. A small discrepancy in sauce quantity can affect texture and flavour, so accuracy matters.</p>  

<p>Air fryers cook food quickly, and sauces like BBQ can caramelise faster than expected. Measuring 10g correctly (0.35 oz) ensures even coating without overloading. Too much sauce can lead to messy drips or uneven cooking, while too little might leave your dish dry.

<h3>How to Measure 10g of BBQ Sauce Accurately</h3>  
<p>Use digital kitchen scales for the most precise measurement of 10g (0.35 oz) of BBQ sauce. If you don’t have scales, a teaspoon holds roughly 5g, so two level teaspoons will get you close. For thicker sauces, lightly grease the spoon to help it slide off easily. Remember, 10g of BBQ sauce to ounces is a small amount—ideal for coating a single portion of chicken or veggies in your air fryer.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for 10g of BBQ Sauce in Air Fryers</h2>  
<p>This quantity is perfect for glazing <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken wings</a> or drumsticks before air frying. Spread 10g (0.35 oz) evenly for a sticky, caramelised finish. It’s also great for marinating tofu or brushing onto salmon fillets. For larger batches, simply scale up the measurement proportionally—20g would be 0.7 oz, and so on.</p>

faqQ1: "Is 20g of water the same as 20ml?"
faqA1: "Yes, for water, 20 grams is equivalent to 20 millilitres because water’s density is 1g/ml. This makes converting between weight and volume straightforward, especially for air fryer recipes where precision matters."
faqQ2: "Can I use ounces and grams interchangeably in air fryer recipes?"
faqA2: "While you can convert between ounces and grams, it’s best to stick to one unit for consistency. Air fryer recipes often rely on precise ratios, so using a scale or conversion tool ensures accuracy."
faqQ3: "Why do some UK recipes use grams instead of ounces?"
faqA3: "The UK primarily uses the metric system, so grams are more common in recipes. However, many scales and measuring tools display both, making conversions like 20g of water to ounces easy for home cooks."
faqQ4: "How do I measure 20g of water without a scale?"
faqA4: "You can use tablespoons or teaspoons—20g of water is roughly 1.3 tablespoons or 4 teaspoons. For small amounts, a medicine syringe or graduated measuring cup offers the most accuracy."

<p>20 grams of water equals approximately 0.705 ounces. This conversion is essential for precise measurements in air fryer recipes, where accuracy can make or break your dish. Whether you’re adjusting a recipe or scaling ingredients, knowing how to convert 20g of water to ounces ensures consistency in your cooking.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate water measurements matter in air frying</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on precise ingredient ratios to achieve the perfect texture and doneness. Adding too much or too little water can affect the moisture levels, leading to soggy or dry results. For example, when making air fryer cakes or steamed buns, 20g of water might seem minor, but it plays a crucial role in the final outcome.</p>  

<p>Many UK recipes use grams, but if your kitchen scale only measures ounces, knowing the conversion helps avoid guesswork. A handy <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> can simplify this process, ensuring you never second-guess measurements again.</p>  

<h3>How to measure 20g of water without a scale</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a digital scale, you can still measure 20g of water accurately. One tablespoon of water is roughly 15 grams, so 20g would be just over 1.3 tablespoons. For smaller quantities, a teaspoon holds about 5 grams, meaning four teaspoons equal 20g. This method is especially useful for recipes like air fryer sauces or marinades.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for 20g of water in air fryer recipes</h2>  
<p>From dough hydration to steaming, 20g of water is often used in small but impactful ways. For instance, when making air fryer bread or dumplings, this amount helps bind ingredients without making the mixture too wet. It’s also ideal for rehydrating dried herbs or spices before adding them to your dish.</p>  

<p>If you’re exploring <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a>, you’ll notice many require precise water measurements. Whether you’re cooking vegetables or preparing a marinade, 20g of water can be the difference between a perfectly balanced dish and one that’s off-kilter.</p>  

<h3>Converting 20g of water to fluid ounces</h3>  
<p>While 20g of water is 0.705 avoirdupois ounces, it’s also equivalent to 0.676 fluid ounces. This distinction matters in liquid measurements, especially for recipes requiring exact volumes. For air fryer cooking, where evaporation rates can vary, using the correct unit ensures consistency.</p>  

<h2>Tips for measuring small quantities in air frying</h2>  
<p>When working with small amounts like 20g of water, precision is key. Use a syringe or graduated measuring spoon for accuracy, especially when preparing sauces or glazes. Avoid estimating, as even slight deviations can alter the texture of air-fried foods.</p>  

<p>For those who frequently convert measurements, bookmarking a reliable resource like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> saves time and reduces errors. Their guides cover everything from gram-to-ounce conversions to optimal cooking times for different ingredients.</p>  

<h3>How temperature affects water weight</h3>  
<p>Water’s density changes slightly with temperature, but for most cooking purposes, 20g of water remains 20g. However, in high-precision baking or scientific cooking methods, these minor variations might matter. For everyday air fryer recipes, though, standard conversions work perfectly.</p>  

<p>Keeping your air fryer clean is just as important as accurate measurements.

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of ingredients, like Nutella, ensures your air fryer dishes turn out perfectly. Too much or too little can affect texture, cooking time, and even flavour. For example, adding 200g of Nutella (7.05 ounces) to a cake batter will give you the ideal richness without overpowering other ingredients.

<p>Air fryers cook food quickly and evenly, so precision is key. Whether you’re making Nutella-stuffed cookies or a decadent brownie, measuring 200g of Nutella correctly ensures consistency. Visit <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>our recipes section</a> for inspiration on how to use Nutella in your air fryer creations.</p>  

<h2>How to measure 200g of Nutella without scales</h2>  
<p>If you don’t have a kitchen scale, you can still measure 200g of Nutella using tablespoons. One tablespoon of Nutella weighs roughly 19g, so 200g is about 10.5 tablespoons. This method isn’t as precise as weighing, but it’s handy in a pinch. For best results, we recommend investing in a digital scale, especially for air fryer recipes where accuracy matters.</p>  
<p>Another trick is to use a measuring cup. 200g of Nutella is roughly ¾ cup, but this can vary slightly depending on how packed the Nutella is.

<h3>Common uses for 200g of Nutella in air fryer recipes</h3>  
<p>200g of Nutella is perfect for making a batch of air fryer Nutella brownies or stuffed French toast. It’s also great for drizzling over air-fried bananas or mixing into pancake batter. The rich, chocolatey flavour pairs well with many desserts, and the 7.05-ounce measurement ensures you get the right balance every time.</p>  

<h3>Storing Nutella for air fryer recipes</h3>  
<p>Once opened, Nutella should be stored in a cool, dry place. If you’ve measured out 200g for a recipe but don’t use it all, simply reseal the jar tightly. Nutella doesn’t need refrigeration, but if you prefer it thicker, you can chill it before using it in air fryer recipes like stuffed pastries or cookies.</p>

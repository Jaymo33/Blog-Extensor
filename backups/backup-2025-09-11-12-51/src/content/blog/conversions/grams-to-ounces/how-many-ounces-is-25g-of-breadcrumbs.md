faqQ1: "Can I use cups instead of grams or ounces for breadcrumbs?"
faqA1: "Yes, but cups are less precise. 25g of fine breadcrumbs is roughly ¼ cup, while coarse crumbs may fill closer to ⅓ cup due to air gaps. For consistent results in air fryer recipes, weighing is best."
faqQ2: "Do panko breadcrumbs weigh the same as regular breadcrumbs?"
faqA2: "Panko breadcrumbs are lighter and flakier, so 25g of panko will take up more volume than regular crumbs. However, the weight in ounces (0.88 oz) remains the same for accurate conversions."
faqQ3: "How do I make 25g of breadcrumbs stick better in the air fryer?"
faqA3: "Dip your food in egg or milk first, then press the breadcrumbs firmly onto the surface. For extra crispiness, lightly spray with oil before air frying at 180°C for even browning."
faqQ4: "Can I substitute almond flour for breadcrumbs in air fryer recipes?"
faqA4: "Yes, but almond flour behaves differently. Use the same weight (25g), but expect a denser, nuttier coating. Adjust cooking times slightly, as almond flour browns faster than breadcrumbs."

faqQ1: "Can I use golden syrup instead of treacle for 150g in recipes?"

faqQ4: "Can I freeze leftover treacle after measuring 150g?"
faqA4: "Yes, treacle freezes well. Portion 150g (5.29 oz) amounts in airtight containers for future use. Thaw at room temperature before using in air fryer recipes."

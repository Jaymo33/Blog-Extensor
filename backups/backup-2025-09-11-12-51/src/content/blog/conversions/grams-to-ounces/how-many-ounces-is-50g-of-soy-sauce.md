faqQ1: "Is 50g of soy sauce the same as 50ml?"
faqA1: "No, 50g of soy sauce is not the same as 50ml. Grams measure weight, while millilitres measure volume. The exact conversion depends on the soy sauce’s density, but generally, 50g is roughly 48–50ml. For air fryer recipes, always check whether the recipe specifies weight or volume."
faqQ2: "Can I use a tablespoon to measure 50g of soy sauce?"
faqA2: "Yes, but it’s less precise. Approximately 3 tablespoons plus 1 teaspoon equal 50g of soy sauce. For best results, use a digital scale or liquid measuring cup. Air fryer recipes often require accuracy, so investing in proper tools is worthwhile."
faqQ3: "Does the brand of soy sauce affect the weight-to-ounce conversion?"
faqA3: "Slightly. Thicker, artisanal soy sauces may weigh more per volume than lighter ones. However, the difference is minimal for home cooking. 50g of any soy sauce will still be close to 1.76 ounces. Stick to your recipe’s measurements for consistency."
faqQ4: "How do I convert other amounts of soy sauce from grams to ounces?"
faqA4: "Multiply the grams by 0.035 to get ounces. For example, 100g of soy sauce equals 3.53 ounces. Bookmark our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a> for quick reference. This trick works for all liquid and dry ingredients in air fryer cooking."

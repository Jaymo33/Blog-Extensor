faqQ1: "Can I use a measuring cup instead of a scale for 500g of balsamic vinegar?"
faqA1: "Yes, but it’s less precise. Since balsamic vinegar’s density varies slightly, 500g (17.64 ounces) is roughly 2 cups. For best results, especially in air fryer recipes, a digital scale is recommended for accuracy."
faqQ2: "How long does 500g of balsamic vinegar last once opened?"
faqA2: "An opened 500g bottle of balsamic vinegar can last up to 3 years if stored properly in a cool, dark place. Always check for changes in smell or taste before using it in your air fryer recipes."
faqQ3: "What’s the best way to reduce 500g of balsamic vinegar for a glaze?"
faqA3: "Simmer 500g (17.64 ounces) of balsamic vinegar in a saucepan over low heat until it thickens, about 15-20 minutes. Use it to glaze air fryer dishes like chicken or vegetables for a rich, tangy flavour."
faqQ4: "Is 500g of balsamic vinegar the same as 500ml?"
faqA4: "No, because balsamic vinegar’s density means 500g is slightly less than 500ml. For precise air fryer recipes, always measure by weight (grams or ounces) rather than volume (millilitres) for the best results."

<p>500g of balsamic vinegar equals approximately 17.64 ounces. This conversion is essential for anyone using an air fryer, as precise measurements can make or break a recipe. Whether you’re whipping up a glaze or marinating meats, knowing how to convert grams to ounces ensures your dish turns out perfectly every time.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on precise cooking times and ingredient ratios to deliver crispy, evenly cooked results. Using the correct amount of balsamic vinegar, whether for a marinade or a reduction, ensures balanced flavours. Too much or too little can throw off the entire dish, especially in recipes like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer glazed chicken</a> or roasted vegetables.</p>  

<p>Many UK recipes list ingredients in grams, but if you’re using a scale that measures in ounces, knowing the conversion is crucial. For example, 500g of balsamic vinegar is roughly 17.64 ounces, a measurement you’ll often need for sauces or dressings.

<h3>How to measure balsamic vinegar without a scale</h3>

One fluid ounce of balsamic vinegar weighs about 28.35 grams, so 17.64 ounces would be close to 500g. However, for the most accurate results, especially in air fryer cooking, a digital scale is recommended.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for balsamic vinegar in air fryer recipes</h2>

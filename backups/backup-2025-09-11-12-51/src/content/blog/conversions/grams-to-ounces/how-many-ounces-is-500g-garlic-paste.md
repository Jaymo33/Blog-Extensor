faqQ1: "Can I use fresh garlic instead of 500g of garlic paste?"
faqA1: "Yes, but the conversion differs. Fresh garlic is less concentrated, so you’d need about 50-60 cloves (or 150g minced) to match 500g of garlic paste. Adjust seasoning to taste."
faqQ2: "How long does 500g of garlic paste last in the fridge?"
faqA2: "Stored in an airtight container, 500g of garlic paste stays fresh for up to two weeks. For longer storage, freeze it in portions for up to three months."
faqQ3: "Is 500g of garlic paste the same as 500ml?"
faqA3: "No, grams measure weight, while millilitres measure volume. Garlic paste’s density means 500g is roughly 400-450ml, but always weigh for accuracy."
faqQ4: "What’s the best way to portion 500g of garlic paste for recipes?"
faqA4: "Divide 500g into smaller containers or ice cube trays (about 1-2 tablespoons each). This makes it easy to grab the right amount for air fryer meals or sauces."

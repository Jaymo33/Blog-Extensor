faqQ1: "Is 500g of whipping cream the same as 500ml?"
faqA1: "No, 500g of whipping cream is not the same as 500ml. Weight (grams) and volume (millilitres) measure different properties. Whipping cream's density means 500g is roughly 480-490ml, but this can vary slightly. Always use weight for accuracy in recipes."
faqQ2: "Can I use a measuring cup instead of a scale for 500g of whipping cream?"
faqA2: "While you can use a measuring cup, it's less accurate than a scale. 500g of whipping cream is approximately 2 cups, but density and air content can affect the volume. For precise results, especially in baking, a digital scale is best."
faqQ3: "How long does 500g of whipping cream last in the fridge?"
faqA3: "Unopened 500g whipping cream lasts about a week past its sell-by date if refrigerated properly. Once opened, use it within 3-4 days. Always check for off smells or curdling before use in air fryer recipes."
faqQ4: "Can I freeze 500g of whipping cream for later use?"
faqA4: "Yes, you can freeze 500g of whipping cream, but it may separate when thawed. It's best used in cooked dishes like soups or sauces after freezing. For whipping or desserts, fresh cream is recommended for the best texture."

faqQ1: "Can I use bottled lime juice instead of fresh for 250g measurements?"
faqA1: "Yes, bottled lime juice works in a pinch, but fresh lime juice offers better flavour. Bottled juice may contain preservatives or added water, slightly altering the weight. For accuracy, stick to freshly squeezed when possible."
faqQ2: "How many limes do I need for 250g of juice?"
faqA2: "You’ll need about 8-10 medium limes to yield 250g of juice, depending on their size and juiciness. Roll limes firmly before cutting to maximise extraction."
faqQ3: "Does 250g of lime juice weigh the same as 250g of water?"
faqA3: "Yes, 250g of lime juice and water weigh the same, but lime juice is slightly denser due to dissolved solids. Volume measurements (like cups) may differ slightly between the two."
faqQ4: "Can I substitute lemon juice for lime juice in air fryer recipes?"
faqA4: "Yes, but lemon juice is slightly less tart. Use the same 250g (8.82 oz) measurement, but expect a milder flavour. Adjust seasonings to taste for the best results."

<h2>Why convert 250g lime juice to ounces?</h2>  
<p>Many UK air fryer recipes use metric measurements, but some kitchen scales or older cookbooks might still list ingredients in ounces.

<h3>How to measure 250g lime juice accurately</h3>  
<p>For the best results, use a digital kitchen scale to weigh lime juice directly in grams. If your scale only measures ounces, aim for 8.82 oz. Alternatively, 250g of lime juice is roughly 1 cup (240ml), but this can vary slightly depending on the juicing method. Freshly squeezed lime juice may contain pulp, which can affect the weight, so straining it first ensures consistency.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for 250g lime juice in air frying</h2>

<h3>Storing leftover lime juice</h3>  
<p>If you don’t use all 250g of lime juice at once, store it in an airtight container in the fridge for up to a week. Freezing lime juice in ice cube trays is another great way to preserve it for future air fryer recipes. Just thaw and measure as needed.</p>

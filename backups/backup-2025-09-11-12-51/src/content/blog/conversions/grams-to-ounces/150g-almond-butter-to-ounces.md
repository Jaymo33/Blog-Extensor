faqQ1: "Can I use peanut butter instead of almond butter in air fryer recipes?"
faqA1: "Yes, you can substitute peanut butter for almond butter in most air fryer recipes. The weight conversion remains the same (150g = 5.29 oz), but the flavour will differ. Peanut butter has a stronger taste, so adjust other ingredients accordingly."
faqQ2: "How do I measure almond butter if I don’t have a kitchen scale?"
faqA2: "You can use tablespoons to estimate 150g of almond butter—about 9.5 tablespoons. However, this method is less accurate than weighing. For best results, consider purchasing a kitchen scale for precise measurements, especially for baking."
faqQ3: "Does almond butter behave differently in air fryer recipes compared to oven baking?"
faqA3: "Almond butter performs similarly in air fryers and ovens, but air fryers cook faster. Reduce cooking time by 20% and check frequently to prevent burning. The 150g (5.29 oz) measurement ensures even cooking in both appliances."
faqQ4: "Why does my almond butter measurement seem off when using cups?"
faqA4: "Almond butter’s density can vary based on brand and temperature, making cup measurements unreliable. Weighing 150g (5.29 oz) guarantees accuracy. If using cups, lightly pack the almond butter and level it off for a closer estimate."

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on even cooking, and incorrect measurements can lead to uneven results. Almond butter, being dense, requires precise weighing to avoid overly dry or soggy outcomes. If you’re making almond butter granola or energy bars, 150g (5.29 oz) ensures the right texture.

<p>Using a kitchen scale is the best way to measure almond butter, as volume measurements (like cups) can vary. For sticky ingredients like almond butter, lightly oiling your measuring spoon or cup helps with accuracy. If you’re converting other nut butters, like peanut or cashew, the weight-to-ounce ratio remains the same.</p>  

<h2>How to measure 150g of almond butter without a scale</h2>  
<p>If you don’t have a scale, you can estimate 150g of almond butter using tablespoons. One tablespoon of almond butter weighs roughly 16g, so 150g is about 9.5 tablespoons. However, this method isn’t as precise, so investing in a scale is ideal for consistent results.

faqQ1: "Is 15g of brown sugar the same as 15g of white sugar in ounces?"
faqA1: "Yes, 15g of any sugar (brown, white, or caster) converts to roughly 0.53 ounces. However, brown sugar is denser when packed, so always measure by weight for accuracy, especially in air fryer recipes where moisture affects results."
faqQ2: "Can I use a measuring spoon instead of a scale for 15g of brown sugar?"
faqA2: "While a scale is best, 1.5 tablespoons of packed brown sugar approximates 15g. For air fryer baking, though, even small discrepancies can alter texture, so weighing is ideal. Check our conversion chart for more tips."
faqQ3: "Why does my air fryer recipe call for such a small amount of brown sugar?"
faqA3: "Air fryers cook quickly, so recipes often use less sugar to prevent over-caramelisation or burning. 15g (0.53 ounces) adds subtle sweetness without overwhelming dishes like glazed vegetables or single-serving desserts."
faqQ4: "How do I store leftover brown sugar after measuring 15g?"
faqA4: "Keep brown sugar in an airtight container to prevent hardening. If it dries out, add a slice of bread or a damp paper towel to restore moisture. Proper storage ensures it’s ready for your next air fryer recipe."

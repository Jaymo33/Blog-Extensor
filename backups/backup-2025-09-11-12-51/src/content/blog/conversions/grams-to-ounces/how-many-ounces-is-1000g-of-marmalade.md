faqQ1: "Can I use 1000g of marmalade straight from the jar in my air fryer?"
faqA1: "Yes, but warming it slightly makes spreading easier. For glazes, thin 1000g (35.27 oz) of marmalade with a splash of water or citrus juice to prevent clumping in the air fryer."
faqQ2: "Does marmalade weight change when cooked in an air fryer?"
faqA2: "Cooking reduces marmalade’s water content, so 1000g (35.27 oz) may yield slightly less after air frying. Factor this in for recipes requiring precise thickness or coverage."
faqQ3: "How many servings does 1000g of marmalade make in air fryer recipes?"
faqA3: "It depends on the dish. For glazes, 1000g (35.27 oz) covers roughly 8-10 portions. In desserts, it could serve 12-15, especially when mixed with other ingredients."
faqQ4: "Can I substitute other jams for marmalade in 1000g measurements?"
faqA4: "Yes, but adjust for sweetness and texture. Marmalade’s citrus peel adds depth, so consider adding zest if using plain jam. Still use 35.27 oz (1000g) for consistent results."

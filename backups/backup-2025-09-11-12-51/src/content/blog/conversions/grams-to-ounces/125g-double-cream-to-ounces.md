faqQ1: "Can I use single cream instead of double cream in air fryer recipes?"
faqA1: "Yes, but the texture and richness will differ. Double cream has a higher fat content (around 48%), making it thicker and better for whipping. Single cream (18% fat) is lighter and may not hold its shape as well in baked or air-fried dishes."
faqQ2: "How do I measure 125g of double cream without scales?"
faqA2: "If you don’t have scales, use a measuring jug with fluid ounce markings. 125g of double cream is roughly 4.41 oz or about ½ cup. However, this method is less precise, so for best results, a digital scale is recommended."
faqQ3: "Does double cream weigh the same as whipped cream?"
faqA3: "No, whipped cream incorporates air, so it becomes lighter in volume but not in weight. 125g of double cream will still be 125g after whipping, but it will take up more space."
faqQ4: "Can I freeze leftover double cream?"
faqA4: "Yes, but it may separate when thawed. Whipped double cream freezes better—just portion it into an airtight container. Thaw in the fridge and re-whip lightly before using in air fryer recipes."

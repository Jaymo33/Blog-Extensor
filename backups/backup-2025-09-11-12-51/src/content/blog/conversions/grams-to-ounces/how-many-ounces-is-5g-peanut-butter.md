faqQ1: "Is 5g of peanut butter the same as 5ml?"
faqA1: "No, 5g of peanut butter is not the same as 5ml. Grams measure weight, while millilitres measure volume. Due to peanut butter’s density, 5g may occupy slightly less or more than 5ml depending on its consistency. For accuracy, always weigh peanut butter when possible."
faqQ2: "Can I use tablespoons to measure 5g of peanut butter?"
faqA2: "A level teaspoon is roughly 5g of peanut butter, while a tablespoon is about 15g. If you need 5g, using a teaspoon is more accurate. For air fryer recipes, precise measurements ensure consistent results, so a kitchen scale is ideal."
faqQ3: "Why does peanut butter weight matter in air fryer recipes?"
faqA3: "Peanut butter’s weight affects texture and cooking time in air fryer recipes. Too much can make dishes greasy, while too little may lack flavour. Measuring 5g accurately ensures balanced results, especially in baking or glazes."
faqQ4: "How do I convert ounces back to grams for peanut butter?"
faqA4: "To convert ounces to grams, multiply by 28.35. For example, 0.18 ounces (5g) x 28.35 = 5g. This conversion is useful for adjusting recipes or using scales that display ounces. Always double-check for precision."

<h2>Why Convert 5g of Peanut Butter to Ounces?</h2>  
<p>Converting 5g of peanut butter to ounces is crucial for following recipes accurately, especially in baking. Many UK recipes use grams, while others may reference ounces, so knowing both measurements is handy. Peanut butter’s density means volume measurements like tablespoons can vary, but weight remains consistent. This precision is vital for air fryer recipes, where even small deviations can affect texture and cooking time.

<p>Using a kitchen scale is the best way to measure 5g of peanut butter, but if you don’t have one, visual approximations can help. A teaspoon of peanut butter is roughly 5g, but this can vary depending on how heaped it is. For air fryer recipes, consistency is key, so weighing ingredients ensures reliable results every time.

<h3>How to Measure 5g of Peanut Butter Without a Scale</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a scale, you can use a measuring spoon to estimate 5g of peanut butter. A level teaspoon is approximately 5g, but this can vary slightly depending on the brand and how dense the peanut butter is. For sticky ingredients like peanut butter, lightly greasing the spoon can help it slide off easily. This method is handy for quick air fryer recipes where precision isn’t critical but still helpful.</p>

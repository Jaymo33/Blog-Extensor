faqQ1: "Can I use a tablespoon to measure 15g of icing sugar?"
faqA1: "While possible, a tablespoon isn’t the most accurate method. 15g of icing sugar is roughly 2 level tablespoons, but density can vary. For best results, especially in air fryer baking, use a digital scale."
faqQ2: "Why does my air fryer recipe call for grams instead of ounces?"
faqA2: "Many modern recipes, especially those from the UK or Europe, use grams for precision. Air fryer cooking benefits from exact measurements to ensure even cooking and perfect texture."
faqQ3: "How do I convert ounces back to grams if needed?"
faqA3: "Multiply the number of ounces by 28.35 to get grams. For example, 0.53 ounces x 28.35 = 15g. This works for all dry ingredients, including icing sugar."
faqQ4: "Can I substitute granulated sugar for icing sugar in air fryer recipes?"
faqA4: "It’s not recommended, as icing sugar dissolves differently and affects texture. For best results, stick to the recipe. If you’re out, blend granulated sugar into a fine powder as a last resort."

faqQ1: "Is 100g of apple cider vinegar the same as 100ml?"

faqQ2: "Can I use other vinegars if a recipe calls for 100g apple cider vinegar?"
faqA2: "Yes, you can substitute other vinegars when a recipe requires 100g (3.53 oz) apple cider vinegar. White wine vinegar or lemon juice work well, though flavours will vary slightly. The 100g to ounces conversion remains the same regardless of vinegar type in air fryer cooking."
faqQ3: "How do I measure 100g apple cider vinegar without scales?"
faqA3: "Without scales, you can measure 100g apple cider vinegar as 100ml (about 7 tablespoons) since their volumes are nearly identical. Use a liquid measuring cup for accuracy, especially important for air fryer recipes where ingredient ratios affect cooking results."
faqQ4: "Why do some air fryer recipes use grams instead of ounces for liquids?"
faqA4: "Many air fryer recipes use grams because it's more precise for small liquid measurements like 100g apple cider vinegar (3.53 oz). Gram measurements eliminate confusion between fluid and weight ounces, ensuring consistent results in your air-fried dishes every time."

faqQ1: "Is 1000g of brown sugar the same as 1000g of white sugar in ounces?"
faqA1: "Yes, 1000g of any sugar type (brown, white, caster) equals 35.27 ounces by weight. However, brown sugar is denser when packed, so always measure by weight for accuracy in air fryer recipes."
faqQ2: "Can I use cups instead of ounces for 1000g of brown sugar?"
faqA2: "While 1000g is roughly 5 UK cups, measuring by weight (35.27 oz) is far more precise. Cups can vary based on how tightly the sugar is packed, affecting recipe outcomes."
faqQ3: "Why do some recipes list brown sugar in grams and others in ounces?"
faqA3: "Recipes may use grams (metric) or ounces (imperial) depending on origin. UK recipes often use grams, while older cookbooks may prefer ounces. Always convert for consistency."
faqQ4: "How should I store leftover 1000g brown sugar after measuring?"
faqA4: "Keep brown sugar in an airtight container to prevent hardening. If it clumps, revive it with a slice of bread or microwave briefly. Proper storage ensures it stays fresh for future air fryer bakes."

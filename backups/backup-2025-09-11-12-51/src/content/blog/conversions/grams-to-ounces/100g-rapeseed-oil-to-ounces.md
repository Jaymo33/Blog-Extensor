faqQ1: "Is 100g of rapeseed oil the same as 100ml?"
faqA1: "No, 100g of rapeseed oil is not the same as 100ml. While they’re close in volume, 100g of rapeseed oil equals approximately 105ml due to differences in density. For precise air fryer cooking, it’s best to measure by weight (grams or ounces) rather than volume."
faqQ2: "Can I use olive oil instead of rapeseed oil in my air fryer?"
faqA2: "Yes, you can substitute olive oil, but be aware it has a lower smoke point than rapeseed oil. For high-temperature air frying, rapeseed oil is more stable. If using olive oil, reduce the temperature slightly to prevent smoking."
faqQ3: "How do I convert other amounts of rapeseed oil from grams to ounces?"
faqA3: "To convert any amount, multiply the grams by 0.0353 to get ounces. For example, 50g would be 1.77 oz. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a> makes this easy for all common air fryer measurements."
faqQ4: "Why is my air fryer smoking when I use rapeseed oil?"
faqA4: "Smoking usually occurs when too much oil is used or the temperature is too high. Stick to the recommended 100g (3.53 oz) measurement and avoid exceeding the oil’s smoke point (around 230°C for rapeseed oil). Regular cleaning also prevents smoke from built-up residue."

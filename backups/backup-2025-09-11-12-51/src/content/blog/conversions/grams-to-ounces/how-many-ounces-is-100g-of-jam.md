faqQ1: "Is 100g of jam the same as 100ml?"
faqA1: "No, 100g of jam is not the same as 100ml. Grams measure weight, while millilitres measure volume. Depending on the jam's density, 100g could be slightly more or less than 100ml. For accuracy, always weigh jam when a recipe specifies grams."
faqQ2: "Can I use a US measuring cup for 100g of jam?"
faqA2: "While you can use a US measuring cup, it's less precise for jam because of its sticky texture. 100g of jam is roughly 1/3 cup, but weighing it with a scale is more reliable. This ensures your air fryer recipes turn out perfectly every time."
faqQ3: "Why do some recipes use ounces instead of grams for jam?"
faqA3: "Ounces are more common in older UK recipes or those from the US, where imperial measurements are standard. Grams are the metric standard in modern UK cooking. Converting 100g of jam to ounces (3.53 oz) helps bridge this gap for consistency."
faqQ4: "How long does 100g of jam last in the fridge once opened?"
faqA4: "Once opened, 100g of jam will last about 1-2 months in the fridge if stored properly in an airtight container. Always check for mould or off smells before using it in air fryer recipes.

<p>100g of jam is approximately 3.53 ounces. This conversion is essential for precise baking and air fryer recipes, especially when following UK measurements. Whether you're making a jam-filled pastry or glazing a cake, knowing this conversion ensures accuracy. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we focus on helping you get measurements right for perfect results every time.</p>

<h2>Why converting 100g of jam to ounces matters</h2>
<p>Many UK recipes, especially those for air fryers, use grams, while some older cookbooks or international recipes might list ounces. Converting 100g of jam to ounces (3.53 oz) ensures you don’t over or under-measure, which can affect texture and taste. For example, too much jam in an air fryer pastry can cause leaks, while too little might leave it dry. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> simplifies these calculations for you.</p>
<p>Jam density can vary slightly depending on the fruit and sugar content, but 100g of jam will always be close to 3.53 ounces. This consistency makes it easy to scale recipes up or down. If you're preparing a larger batch, like for our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>jam-filled air fryer cookies</a>, this conversion ensures uniformity across servings.</p>

<h2>How to measure 100g of jam accurately</h2>
<p>Using a digital kitchen scale is the most accurate way to measure 100g of jam. Simply place your container on the scale, tare it to zero, and spoon in the jam until you hit 100g. If you don’t have a scale, 100g of jam is roughly 4-5 tablespoons, but this can vary based on thickness. For sticky ingredients like jam, a silicone spatula helps scrape every bit out of the measuring spoon.</p>
<p>For air fryer recipes, precision matters even more because the cooking environment is compact and intense. Too much jam in a pastry, for instance, can bubble over and create a mess.

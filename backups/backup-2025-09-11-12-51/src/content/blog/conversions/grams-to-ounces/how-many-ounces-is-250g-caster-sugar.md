faqQ1: "Can I use granulated sugar instead of caster sugar for 250g measurements?"
faqA1: "Yes, you can substitute granulated sugar for caster sugar, but the texture may differ slightly. Granulated sugar has larger crystals, so 250g will measure slightly differently in volume. For best results in air fryer baking, stick to caster sugar when specified."
faqQ2: "How do I store 250g portions of caster sugar for future use?"
faqA2: "Store 250g portions of caster sugar in airtight containers in a cool, dry place. For easy access, pre-measure several 250g (8.82 oz) portions when you buy bulk bags. This saves time when baking and ensures consistent measurements for your air fryer recipes."
faqQ3: "Does 250g of caster sugar convert differently for US and UK ounces?"
faqA3: "No, 250g of caster sugar converts to the same ounce measurement in both US and UK systems. The conversion is based on weight, not volume, so 250g always equals approximately 8.82 ounces regardless of location."
faqQ4: "Why is caster sugar better than granulated for air fryer baking?"
faqA4: "Caster sugar's finer grains dissolve more easily in air fryer recipes, creating lighter textures in cakes and cookies. When measuring 250g portions, caster sugar distributes more evenly than granulated, leading to more consistent baking results in the concentrated heat of an air fryer."

faqQ1: "Can I use bottled lime juice instead of fresh for 15g measurements?"
faqA1: "Fresh lime juice is preferred for its vibrant flavour, but bottled lime juice can work in a pinch. Just note that bottled versions may have added preservatives or a slightly different taste. For accuracy, still measure 15g (0.53 oz) as directed."
faqQ2: "How do I convert other amounts of lime juice from grams to ounces?"
faqA2: "To convert any amount, use the ratio 1g ≈ 0.035 oz. For example, 30g of lime juice would be roughly 1.06 oz. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a> simplifies this for all common measurements."
faqQ3: "Why is weighing lime juice better than measuring by volume?"
faqA3: "Weighing (e.g., 15g) is more precise because lime juice density can vary. Volume measurements (like tablespoons) may differ based on juiciness or pulp content. A kitchen scale ensures consistency in your air fryer recipes."
faqQ4: "What air fryer recipes work best with 15g of lime juice?"
faqA4: "15g of lime juice is perfect for marinades (like prawns or chicken), dressings, or drizzling over air-fried fish. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/seafood>seafood recipes</a> for inspiration—it’s a game-changer for bright, zesty flavours."

<h2>Common Uses for 15g of Lime Juice in Air Fryer Recipes</h2>  
<p>Lime juice adds a bright, citrusy kick to countless air fryer dishes. A 15g portion (0.53 oz) is perfect for marinades, such as those for prawns or chicken, ensuring a tangy flavour without overpowering the dish. It’s also great for drizzling over air-fried fish or mixing into dips and sauces. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we recommend using fresh lime juice for the best results, as bottled versions can lack vibrancy. Whether you’re cooking seafood, meats, or veggies, 15g of lime juice can elevate your meal.</p>  

<p>Another fantastic use for 15g of lime juice is in dressings for air-fried salads or grain bowls. Combine it with olive oil, herbs, and a pinch of salt for a refreshing finish.

<h3>Tips for Storing Lime Juice</h3>

For longer storage, freeze lime juice in ice cube trays—each cube is roughly 15g (0.53 oz), making future recipes a breeze. This way, you’ll always have the perfect amount on hand for your air fryer adventures. Whether you’re whipping up a quick marinade or a zesty sauce, precise measurements ensure delicious results every time.</p>

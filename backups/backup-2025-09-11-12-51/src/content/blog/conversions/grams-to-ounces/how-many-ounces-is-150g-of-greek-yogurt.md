faqQ1: "Is 150g of Greek yogurt the same as 150ml?"
faqA1: "No, 150g of Greek yogurt is not the same as 150ml. Greek yogurt is denser than water, so 150g will take up less volume. For accuracy, always weigh Greek yogurt rather than measuring by volume."
faqQ2: "Can I use regular yogurt instead of Greek yogurt in air fryer recipes?"
faqA2: "Yes, but you may need to adjust the quantity. Greek yogurt is thicker, so regular yogurt could make your dish too wet. Use about 10% less regular yogurt if substituting for Greek yogurt in recipes."
faqQ3: "How many calories are in 150g of Greek yogurt?"
faqA3: "This depends on the fat content. Full-fat Greek yogurt has around 150-180 calories per 150g, while low-fat versions have about 100-120 calories. Always check the label for exact nutritional information."
faqQ4: "Why is my air fryer recipe with Greek yogurt turning out soggy?"
faqA4: "This could happen if you’re using too much yogurt or not preheating the air fryer. Ensure you’re measuring accurately (150g = 5.29 ounces) and patting ingredients dry before adding yogurt-based coatings."

faqQ1: "Why is it important to measure 5g of Greek yogurt accurately in air fryer recipes?"
faqA1: "Accurate measurements ensure your air fryer dishes have the right texture and flavour. Even small amounts like 5g can affect marinades, dressings, or binders. Precise measurements prevent dishes from becoming too dry or too wet."

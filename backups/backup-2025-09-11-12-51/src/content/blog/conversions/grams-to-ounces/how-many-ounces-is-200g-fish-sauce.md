faqQ1: "Can I use a tablespoon to measure 200g of fish sauce?"
faqA1: "While possible, it’s not the most accurate method. One tablespoon of fish sauce weighs about 15g, so 200g would require roughly 13 tablespoons. For precision, a kitchen scale is best—200g equals 7.05 ounces."
faqQ2: "Does fish sauce weigh the same as water in grams?"
faqA2: "No, fish sauce is slightly denser than water. While 200ml of water weighs 200g, fish sauce may weigh slightly more due to its salt and protein content. Always weigh it for accurate measurements."
faqQ3: "How long does 200g of fish sauce last once opened?"
faqA3: "An opened 200g (7.05 oz) bottle of fish sauce can last up to a year if refrigerated. Its high salt content acts as a natural preservative, but always check for off smells or discolouration before use."
faqQ4: "Can I substitute soy sauce for fish sauce in air fryer recipes?"
faqA4: "Yes, but the flavour profile will differ. Soy sauce is saltier and lacks the umami depth of fish sauce. If substituting, use slightly less—around 150g (5.3 oz) of soy sauce for 200g (7.05 oz) of fish sauce."

<p>200g of fish sauce equals approximately 7.05 ounces. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements can make or break a dish. Whether you're whipping up a marinade or adding depth to a stir-fry, knowing how to convert grams to ounces ensures consistency. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we help simplify these conversions so you can focus on cooking.</p>  

<h2>Why converting grams to ounces matters</h2>  
<p>Accurate measurements are crucial in cooking, especially when using an air fryer. Fish sauce, a staple in many Asian-inspired dishes, can overpower a recipe if used incorrectly. Converting 200g of fish sauce to ounces (7.05 oz) ensures you get the right balance of flavour. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> makes this process effortless.</p>  
<p>Many UK recipes use grams, while others reference ounces, so having a reliable conversion method is handy. Whether you're preparing a <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken dish</a> or a seafood marinade, precise measurements guarantee delicious results. Fish sauce adds umami, but too much can ruin a meal—stick to 7.05 oz for 200g.</p>  

<h2>How to measure fish sauce accurately</h2>  
<p>Using a digital kitchen scale is the easiest way to measure 200g of fish sauce. If your scale displays ounces, it should read around 7.05 oz. For those without scales, a liquid measuring jug marked in millilitres can help—200g of fish sauce is roughly 200ml, but always check the label for density variations.</p>  

<h3>Common mistakes when measuring fish sauce</h3>  
<p>One mistake is assuming all liquids weigh the same. Fish sauce is denser than water, so 200ml isn’t always 200g. Always weigh it for accuracy, especially in air fryer recipes where consistency is key. Another error is eyeballing measurements—this can lead to overly salty or unbalanced dishes.</p>  

<h2>Using fish sauce in air fryer recipes</h2>  
<p>Fish sauce works wonders in air fryer marinades, adding depth to proteins like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/salmon>salmon</a> or <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/shrimp>shrimp</a>. For 200g (7.05 oz), mix it with lime juice, garlic, and sugar for a classic Thai-inspired glaze. The air fryer locks in these flavours beautifully, creating crispy, aromatic dishes.</p>  
<p>If you’re new to air frying, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a> offers plenty of ideas. From crispy wings to stir-fries, fish sauce can elevate your cooking. Just remember—200g equals 7.05 oz, so measure carefully to avoid overpowering your dish.</p>  

<h3>Storing fish sauce for longevity</h3>  
<p>Fish sauce lasts longer when stored in a cool, dark place. Once opened, keep it refrigerated to maintain its flavour. A 200g (7.05 oz) bottle will typically last months if sealed properly.

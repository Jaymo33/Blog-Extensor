<h2>Why convert 150g of powdered milk to ounces?</h2>

<h2>How to measure 150g of powdered milk accurately</h2>
<p>Measuring 150g of powdered milk accurately starts with using the right tools. A digital kitchen scale is the most precise way to measure grams, but if you're converting to ounces, a good set of measuring cups can also work.

When converting 150 grams of powdered milk to oz UK measurements, always prioritise weight over volume for accuracy.</p>

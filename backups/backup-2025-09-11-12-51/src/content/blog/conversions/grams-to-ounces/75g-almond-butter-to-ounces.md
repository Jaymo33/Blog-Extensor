faqQ1: "How do I measure 75g of almond butter without a scale?"
faqA1: "You can use tablespoons to measure 75g of almond butter—roughly 5 tablespoons equal 75g (or 2.65 ounces). For sticky ingredients like almond butter, lightly grease the spoon for easier scooping and levelling."
faqQ2: "Is 75g of almond butter the same as 75ml?"
faqA2: "No, grams measure weight, while millilitres measure volume. Almond butter’s density means 75g won’t always equal 75ml. For accuracy, weigh almond butter in grams or ounces instead of using volume measurements."
faqQ3: "Can I use peanut butter instead of almond butter in a 75g recipe?"
faqA3: "Yes, peanut butter can substitute almond butter in equal weights (75g). However, flavour and texture may vary slightly. Adjust other ingredients if needed to balance sweetness or thickness."
faqQ4: "Why does my almond butter measurement seem off when converting to ounces?"
faqA4: "Natural separation in almond butter can cause inconsistencies. Always stir well before measuring to ensure an even texture. If using a scale, tare it with the container to exclude its weight."

faqQ1: "Can I use honey instead of 25g golden syrup in air fryer recipes?"
faqA1: "Yes, you can substitute honey for golden syrup in most air fryer recipes. Use the same weight (25g or 0.88 oz), but note honey is slightly sweeter and may brown faster. Reduce cooking temperature by about 5°C to prevent over-browning."
faqQ2: "How do I clean golden syrup from my air fryer basket?"
faqA2: "For sticky golden syrup residue, soak the basket in warm soapy water first. Use a soft brush to gently remove any remaining syrup. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner</a> guide has more detailed cleaning tips for sugary residues."
faqQ3: "Why is weighing golden syrup better than measuring by volume?"
faqA3: "Golden syrup's thick consistency means volume measurements can vary significantly. Weighing ensures accuracy - 25g will always be 25g, whereas tablespoon measures can differ based on how the syrup settles. This precision matters most in air fryer baking."
faqQ4: "Can I freeze dishes made with 25g golden syrup in the air fryer?"
faqA4: "Most air fryer recipes using 25g golden syrup freeze well. Cool completely before freezing, then reheat in the air fryer at 160°C for 3-5 minutes. The syrup helps retain moisture during freezing and reheating."

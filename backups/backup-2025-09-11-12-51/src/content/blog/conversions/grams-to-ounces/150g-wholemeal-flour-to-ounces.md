faqQ1: "Is 150g of wholemeal flour the same as 150g of plain flour in ounces?"
faqA1: "Yes, 150g of wholemeal flour and 150g of plain flour both equal approximately 5.29 ounces. However, wholemeal flour is denser, so it may feel heavier when measured by volume. Always weigh flour for accuracy in air fryer recipes."
faqQ2: "Can I use cups instead of ounces for 150g wholemeal flour?"
faqA2: "While possible, cups are less precise. 150g (5.29 oz) of wholemeal flour is roughly 1¼ UK metric cups when spooned and levelled. For best results in air fryer baking, use a digital scale to measure 150g directly."
faqQ3: "Why does my air fryer bake turn out dense with 150g wholemeal flour?"
faqA3: "Overmeasuring flour is a common culprit. Ensure you’re using exactly 150g (5.29 oz) and not packing the flour down. Also, check your air fryer’s temperature—some models run hotter, which can affect baking results."
faqQ4: "How do I store wholemeal flour to keep it fresh for air fryer recipes?"
faqA4: "Store wholemeal flour in an airtight container in a cool, dark place. It has a shorter shelf life than plain flour due to its oil content. For longer storage, freeze 150g portions (5.29 oz) in sealed bags for future air fryer bakes."

<h2>Why converting 150g wholemeal flour to ounces matters</h2>  
<p>Baking is a science, and even small measurement discrepancies can affect your air fryer recipes. Wholemeal flour, with its denser texture, requires precise weighing for the best results. Converting 150g to ounces (5.29 oz) ensures your dough or batter isn’t too dry or sticky. Many UK bakers prefer using grams, but some recipes, especially older or American ones, list ingredients in ounces. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> makes switching between units effortless.</p>

For best results, invest in a digital scale—it’s a game-changer for air fryer baking.</p>

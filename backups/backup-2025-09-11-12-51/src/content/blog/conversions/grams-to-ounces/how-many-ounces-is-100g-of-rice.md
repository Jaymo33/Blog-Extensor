faqQ1: "Can I use 100g of rice for two people in the air fryer?"
faqA1: "100g of uncooked rice yields about 300g cooked, which is enough for two light servings. For heartier portions, increase to 150g (5.3 oz) per person. Adjust air fryer time by 2-3 minutes if doubling the quantity."
faqQ2: "How do I convert 100g of rice to cups instead of ounces?"
faqA2: "100g of rice is roughly half a UK metric cup (200ml). For US cups, it’s about 0.4 cups. Note that cup measurements can vary by rice type—weighing is more accurate for air fryer recipes."
faqQ3: "Does 100g of rice weigh the same before and after cooking?"
faqA3: "No, 100g of dry rice absorbs water and expands to about 300g when cooked. Always measure rice uncooked for recipes unless specified otherwise. Air fryer cooking times are based on dry weight."
faqQ4: "Why does my air-fried rice sometimes come out dry?"
faqA4: "Dry rice usually means insufficient water or overcooking. For 100g of rice, use a 1:2 rice-to-water ratio (200ml). Cover the dish with foil to trap steam, and check at 10 minutes to prevent drying."

At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we help simplify cooking conversions so you can focus on creating delicious meals.</p>  

<h2>Why converting 100g of rice to ounces matters</h2>  
<p>Accurate measurements are crucial when cooking rice in an air fryer. Too much or too little rice can affect texture and cooking time. Converting 100g of rice to ounces (3.53 oz) helps you follow recipes precisely, especially those from international sources. Many UK cooks prefer using grams, but some older recipes or American guides may list ingredients in ounces.</p>  

<p>Rice is a staple in many air fryer dishes, from crispy rice cakes to stuffed peppers. If you’re exploring our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipes</a>, you’ll notice measurements in grams for consistency. However, having a quick conversion like 100g rice to ounces handy ensures you never get stuck mid-recipe.</p>  

<h3>How to measure 100g of rice without scales</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a digital scale, you can estimate 100g of rice using household items. A standard UK metric cup holds roughly 200g of uncooked rice, so half a cup is close to 100g. For ounces, 3.53 oz is just under half a US cup (which is 8 oz). Keep in mind that rice types vary in density—basmati is lighter than sticky rice, so adjustments may be needed.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for 100g of rice in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>100g of rice is a versatile portion for air fryer meals. It’s perfect for single servings of fried rice, stuffed vegetables, or as a side dish. When cooked, 100g of dry rice yields about 300g of fluffy rice, ideal for meal prep. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/meal-prep>meal prep recipes</a> for creative ways to use pre-cooked rice.</p>

<h3>Does rice type affect the weight conversion?</h3>  
<p>While 100g of any rice equals 3.53 ounces, the volume may differ. Long-grain rice like basmati is fluffier, so 100g fills more space than short-grain sushi rice. For accuracy, always weigh rice rather than relying on volume measures. This is especially important for air fryer recipes, where overcrowding can lead to uneven cooking.</p>  

<h2>Tips for cooking 100g of rice in your air fryer</h2>  
<p>Cooking rice in an air fryer is quicker than traditional methods. For 100g of rice, use a heatproof dish or foil tray with 200ml of water. Cook at 180°C for 12-15 minutes, stirring halfway. The result? Light, separate grains perfect for stir-fries or salads.

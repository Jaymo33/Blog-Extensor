faqQ1: "Can I use self-raising flour instead of plain flour for 75g measurements?"
faqA1: "Yes, but adjust for leavening agents. Self-raising flour contains baking powder, which alters texture. For precise results, stick to plain flour unless the recipe specifies otherwise."
faqQ2: "How do I convert 75g of plain flour to cups?"
faqA2: "75g of plain flour is roughly ½ cup + 1 tablespoon when lightly spooned. For accuracy, use scales—especially in air fryer baking, where density affects outcomes."
faqQ3: "Why does my air fryer recipe need exact flour measurements?"
faqA3: "Air fryers cook quickly, and imbalances in dry-to-wet ratios can lead to undercooked or burnt results. Precise 75g (2.65 oz) measurements ensure even heat penetration and ideal texture."
faqQ4: "Does 75g of plain flour weigh the same as 75g of other types?"
faqA4: "Weight is consistent, but density varies. Wholemeal flour, for example, is denser, so 75g may occupy less volume. Always weigh flour for accuracy in air fryer recipes."

<p>75g of plain flour equals approximately 2.65 ounces. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes, where precise measurements can affect texture and cooking times. Whether you're whipping up cakes, cookies, or breaded dishes in your air fryer, knowing how to convert grams to ounces ensures consistent results every time.</p>

<h2>Why accurate flour measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on even heat distribution, and incorrect flour quantities can lead to uneven cooking or dry textures. For example, using too much flour in a batter can make it dense, while too little may cause it to fall apart. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we emphasise precision for perfect air-fried treats like our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer cookies</a> or crispy coatings.</p>  

<p>British recipes often use grams, but some cooks prefer ounces for smaller quantities. Converting 75g of plain flour to ounces (2.65 oz) helps streamline the process, especially when scaling recipes up or down. Check our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for other common ingredient swaps.</p>  

<h3>How to measure 75g of plain flour without scales</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have digital scales, use the spoon-and-level method for accuracy. Lightly spoon flour into a measuring cup and level it off with a knife—this avoids compacting the flour, which can add extra grams. For 75g (2.65 oz), you’ll need roughly ½ cup + 1 tablespoon of unsifted plain flour.</p>  

<h2>Common air fryer recipes using 75g of plain flour</h2>  
<p>This quantity is ideal for small-batch baking or coatings. Try it in <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>air fryer cakes</a> or as a base for breaded chicken. The air fryer’s rapid circulation ensures a golden finish without excess oil, making 75g of plain flour go further. For savoury options, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable fritters</a> benefit from this precise measurement.</p>  

<p>Remember, flour type matters too. Plain flour (all-purpose) has a consistent protein content, whereas self-raising includes leavening agents. Always check your recipe’s requirements before converting 75g to ounces to avoid mishaps.</p>  

<h3>Tips for storing plain flour for air fryer use</h3>  
<p>Keep flour in an airtight container to maintain freshness. Humidity can clump it, affecting weight accuracy. If your 75g measurement feels off, fluff the flour with a fork before measuring.

faqQ1: "Is 200g of cornflour the same as 200g of plain flour in ounces?"
faqA1: "No, while 200g equals 7.05 ounces for both, their volumes differ significantly. Cornflour is much finer and denser than plain flour, so they shouldn't be used interchangeably in recipes without adjustment. Always measure by weight (grams or ounces) rather than volume for accuracy."
faqQ2: "Can I use 200g of cornflour for air fryer fried chicken?"
faqA2: "Absolutely! 200g of cornflour (7.05 ounces) makes an excellent crispy coating for air fryer chicken. Combine it with seasonings for flavour, and consider mixing with a little baking powder for extra crunch. The light texture of cornflour gives superior results compared to heavier wheat flours."
faqQ3: "How should I store leftover cornflour after measuring out 200g?"
faqA3: "Store opened cornflour in an airtight container in a cool, dry place. If you've measured out 200g (7.05 ounces) and have leftovers, ensure the container is sealed properly to prevent moisture absorption. Properly stored, cornflour lasts 6-12 months while maintaining its quality for air fryer recipes."
faqQ4: "Why do some recipes specify ounces instead of grams for cornflour?"
faqA4: "Older recipes and American cookbooks often use ounces rather than grams. While 200g of cornflour equals 7.05 ounces, the imperial system remains popular in some regions. For air fryer cooking, either measurement works as long as you're consistent - just use our conversion for accuracy."

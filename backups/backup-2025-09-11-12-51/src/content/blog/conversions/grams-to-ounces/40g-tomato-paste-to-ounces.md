faqQ1: "Can I use tomato sauce instead of 40g tomato paste?"
faqA1: "While you can substitute tomato sauce, the results will differ. Tomato paste is much more concentrated, so you'd need about 120ml (4oz) of tomato sauce to replace 40g (1.41oz) of paste. Keep in mind this will make your dish more liquid, which might affect air fryer cooking times."
faqQ2: "How many calories are in 40g of tomato paste?"
faqA2: "40g of tomato paste contains approximately 50 calories. It's also rich in lycopene and vitamin C. When used in air fryer recipes, the high heat can actually increase the bioavailability of some nutrients in tomato paste."
faqQ3: "Why does my air fryer recipe taste bitter with tomato paste?"
faqA3: "This usually happens when tomato paste burns in the air fryer. To prevent this, mix your 40g (1.41oz) of tomato paste with a bit of oil or water before adding it to other ingredients. Also, consider reducing cooking temperature by about 10Â°C if using tomato paste-heavy recipes."
faqQ4: "Can I freeze measured portions of tomato paste?"
faqA4: "Absolutely! Freezing pre-measured 40g portions (about 1.41oz) of tomato paste is a great time-saver. Simply scoop onto parchment paper, freeze until solid, then transfer to a freezer bag. These frozen portions will keep for up to 3 months and can go straight into your air fryer recipes."

<p>40g of tomato paste equals approximately 1.41 ounces. Whether you're preparing a rich pasta sauce or a flavourful marinade for your air fryer, getting the measurements right is key. Conversions like 40g tomato paste to ounces ensure your recipes turn out perfectly every time. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we know precision matters, especially when working with concentrated ingredients like tomato paste.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Using the correct amount of tomato paste can make or break a dish. Too little, and your sauce lacks depth; too much, and it overpowers other flavours. The air fryer's intense heat means ingredients like tomato paste caramelise quickly, so exact measurements are crucial. For recipes like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>air fryer chicken thighs</a>, a precise 40g of tomato paste ensures balanced seasoning. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a> takes the guesswork out of these measurements.</p>  

<p>Tomato paste is a staple in many air fryer recipes, from Mediterranean dishes to hearty stews. Since it's highly concentrated, even small variations in weight can affect the final taste. Converting 40g tomato paste to ounces (1.41 oz) helps maintain consistency, whether you're scaling a recipe up or down. This is especially useful for batch cooking or meal prep in your air fryer.</p>  

<h3>How to measure 40g of tomato paste without scales</h3>  
<p>If you don't have digital scales, you can still measure 40g of tomato paste accurately. One tablespoon of tomato paste weighs roughly 15g, so 40g is just under 3 tablespoons. For UK cooks, this converts to about 1.41 ounces. Keep in mind that packed versus levelled measurements can vary, so for best results, use proper measuring spoons or a <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>clean</a>, dry kitchen scale.</p>  

<h2>Common recipes using 40g of tomato paste</h2>  
<p>Many air fryer recipes call for around 40g of tomato paste. This amount works perfectly for marinades, like those used in <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>air fryer roasted vegetables</a> or meat dishes. It's also ideal for small-batch pasta sauces or homemade pizza bases. The 40g measurement (1.41 oz) provides enough intensity without making the dish overly acidic or thick.</p>  

<p>When working with tomato paste in your air fryer, remember it browns faster than other ingredients. Mixing 40g of tomato paste with a bit of oil or water can prevent burning. This small adjustment ensures even cooking and better flavour distribution.

<h3>Storing leftover tomato paste</h3>  
<p>After measuring out your 40g of tomato paste, you'll want to store any leftovers properly. Transfer unused paste to an airtight container and refrigerate for up to two weeks. For longer storage, freeze tablespoon-sized portions (about 15g each) on a baking sheet, then transfer to a freezer bag. This way, you'll always have pre-measured amounts ready for your next air fryer creation.</p>

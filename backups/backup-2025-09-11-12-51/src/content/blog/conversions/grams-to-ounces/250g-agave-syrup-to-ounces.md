faqQ1: "Can I use volume measurements (cups) instead of weight for agave syrup?"
faqA1: "While you can use cups, agave syrup's thickness makes volume measurements less accurate than weight. 250g is roughly ¾ cup, but scales ensure precision, especially in baking. For best results, stick to grams or ounces."
faqQ2: "Does the brand of agave syrup affect the 250g to ounces conversion?"
faqA2: "No, the conversion from grams to ounces is consistent regardless of brand. However, density may vary slightly, so weighing is always more reliable than volume measurements for precise recipes."
faqQ3: "How long does 250g of agave syrup last once opened?"
faqA3: "Opened agave syrup lasts about a year if stored properly in a cool, dark place. Avoid refrigeration, as it can cause crystallisation. Always check for off smells or mould before use."
faqQ4: "Can I substitute honey for agave syrup in air fryer recipes?"
faqA4: "Yes, honey can replace agave syrup in a 1:1 ratio, but it has a stronger flavour and higher viscosity. Adjust cooking times slightly, as honey caramelises faster in the air fryer."

Whether you’re whipping up cakes, cookies, or desserts, knowing how to convert grams to ounces ensures your dishes turn out perfectly every time.</p>

<h2>Why Convert 200g of Granulated Sugar to Ounces?</h2>  
<p>Many UK recipes, especially those for air fryers, use grams as the standard unit of measurement. However, some kitchen scales or older recipes might still use ounces. Converting 200g of granulated sugar to ounces (7.05 oz) helps you follow recipes accurately, whether you’re baking a classic Victoria sponge or trying a new <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer dessert</a>. Precision is key in baking, and even a small discrepancy can affect texture and taste.</p>  
<p>If you’re using an air fryer, consistent measurements ensure even cooking and perfect results. For example, a <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>cake recipe</a> calling for 200g of sugar needs exactly 7.05 ounces to maintain the right sweetness and structure. This conversion is also handy if you’re scaling recipes up or down, ensuring you never end up with overly sweet or bland treats.</p>  

<h2>How to Measure 200g of Granulated Sugar Accurately</h2>  
<p>To measure 200g of granulated sugar (7.05 oz), use a digital kitchen scale for the most accurate results. Place your mixing bowl on the scale, tare it to zero, then slowly pour the sugar until it hits 200g. If your scale only displays ounces, stop at 7.05 oz. For those without scales, a measuring cup can work, but it’s less precise—200g of granulated sugar is roughly one cup, but this can vary based on how tightly packed the sugar is.</p>  
<p>When using an air fryer, precise measurements like 200g of granulated sugar (7.05 oz) ensure your batters and mixes have the right consistency. Too much sugar can cause over-browning or uneven cooking, while too little might leave your baked goods dry.

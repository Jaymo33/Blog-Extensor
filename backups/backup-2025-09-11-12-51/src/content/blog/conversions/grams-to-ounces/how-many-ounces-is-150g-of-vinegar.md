faqQ1: "Is 150g of vinegar the same as 150ml?"
faqA1: "Yes, for most vinegars, 150g is roughly equal to 150ml because vinegar’s density is similar to water. However, thicker varieties like balsamic may vary slightly. For air fryer recipes, the difference is usually minimal."
faqQ2: "Can I use a measuring cup for 150g vinegar to ounces?"
faqA2: "A measuring cup can approximate 150g of vinegar as 150ml (about 5 fluid ounces). For absolute precision, especially in baking, a kitchen scale is best. Air fryer marinades often forgive small variances."
faqQ3: "How does 150g vinegar affect air fryer cooking times?"
faqA3: "Vinegar in marinades or glazes won’t significantly alter cooking times, but it helps tenderise meats faster. For crispy foods, a vinegar soak (diluted) can reduce moisture, speeding up browning in the air fryer."
faqQ4: "What’s the best vinegar for air fryer recipes if I’m using 150g?"
faqA4: "White vinegar or apple cider vinegar work well for most air fryer dishes due to their neutral acidity. Balsamic adds richness but can burn at high heat. Always measure 150g (5.29 oz) accurately for balanced flavours."

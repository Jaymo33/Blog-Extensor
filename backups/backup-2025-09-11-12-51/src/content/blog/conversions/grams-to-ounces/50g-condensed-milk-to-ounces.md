faqQ1: "Is 50g of condensed milk the same as 50ml?"
faqA1: "No, 50g of condensed milk isn't the same as 50ml. Weight (grams) and volume (millilitres) measure different properties. Condensed milk is dense, so 50g equals about 38ml. Always weigh ingredients like condensed milk for accuracy in air fryer recipes."
faqQ2: "Can I use evaporated milk instead of condensed milk in air fryer recipes?"
faqA2: "Evaporated milk isn't a direct substitute for condensed milk as it contains no added sugar. For 50g (1.76 oz) of condensed milk, you'd need to add sugar to evaporated milk. However, this may affect texture and cooking times in air fryer recipes."
faqQ3: "How do I measure 50g of condensed milk without scales?"
faqA3: "Without scales, use measuring spoons - 50g (1.76 oz) of condensed milk is roughly 3 level tablespoons. However, for precise air fryer baking, we recommend investing in digital scales for consistent results every time."
faqQ4: "Why do some air fryer recipes use grams instead of ounces?"
faqA4: "Many UK and European recipes use grams as it's more precise for baking. Air fryer recipes often need accuracy, so grams provide better consistency. Our conversion guide helps bridge the gap between measurement systems for perfect results."

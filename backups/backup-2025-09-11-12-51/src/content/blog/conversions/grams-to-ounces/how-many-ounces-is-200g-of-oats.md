<h2>Why Convert 200g of Oats to Ounces?</h2>  
<p>Many UK recipes use grams, but if you're working with a scale or recipe that lists ounces, knowing how to convert 200g of oats to oz is essential. Air fryer recipes, like those on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>our recipes page</a>, often require precise measurements for even cooking. Whether you're making granola, oat bars, or a crunchy topping, 200g of oats is a common quantity. Converting it to ounces ensures you never over or under-measure.</p>  
<p>Oats are a staple in many air fryer breakfasts and snacks, so getting the weight right matters.

<h2>How to Measure 200g of Oats Accurately</h2>  
<p>If you donâ€™t have a scale, measuring 200g of oats (7.05 oz) can be tricky. A standard UK measuring cup holds about 80g of oats, so 200g would be roughly 2.5 cups. However, for air fryer recipes, weighing is always best for consistency. Scooping oats directly from the bag can lead to packed or loose measurements, affecting your dish's texture.</p>  
<p>For perfect air fryer granola or oat-based coatings, use a digital scale set to grams or ounces. If your scale only does ounces, input 7.05 oz for 200g of oats. Need recipe ideas?

faqQ1: "Why is rapeseed oil a good choice for air frying?"
faqA1: "Rapeseed oil is ideal for air frying due to its high smoke point (around 230°C), which prevents burning at high temperatures. Its neutral flavour also won’t overpower your dishes, making it versatile for both savoury and sweet recipes."
faqQ2: "Can I use other oils if I don’t have rapeseed oil?"
faqA2: "Yes, you can substitute rapeseed oil with other high-smoke-point oils like sunflower or vegetable oil. Just ensure you use the same weight (20g or 0.71 oz) for consistent results. Avoid olive oil for high-heat cooking as it burns easily."
faqQ3: "How do I convert other gram measurements to ounces?"
faqA3: "To convert any gram measurement to ounces, divide the grams by 28.35. For example, 50g would be 50 ÷ 28.35 = 1.76 oz. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a> has more detailed references."
faqQ4: "Is 20g of rapeseed oil enough for a whole batch of air-fried food?"
faqA4: "Yes, 20g (0.71 oz) of rapeseed oil is typically sufficient for coating ingredients evenly without making them greasy. For larger batches, you may need to increase the amount slightly, but always start with less to avoid excess oil."

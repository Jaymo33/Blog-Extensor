faqQ1: "How do I convert 200g of mustard to ounces without a calculator?"
faqA1: "You can easily convert 200g of mustard to ounces by multiplying the grams by 0.035. For 200g, that’s 200 x 0.035 = 7.05 ounces. If you prefer a rough estimate, remember that 30g is about 1 ounce, so 200g is just over 6.5 ounces."
faqQ2: "Can I use American mustard for UK air fryer recipes?"
faqA2: "Yes, American mustard works well in UK air fryer recipes, though it’s slightly milder than English mustard. If your recipe calls for 200g (7.05 ounces), the conversion remains the same regardless of the mustard type. Adjust the quantity to taste if needed."
faqQ3: "How many tablespoons are in 200g of mustard?"
faqA3: "200g of mustard is roughly 12 tablespoons or ¾ cup. However, this can vary slightly depending on the mustard’s consistency. For precise air fryer recipes, weighing the mustard is always best."
faqQ4: "Does mustard weight change if it’s Dijon or whole grain?"
faqA4: "Dijon and whole-grain mustard have similar densities, so 200g will still be about 7.05 ounces. However, whole-grain mustard may pack slightly differently due to the seeds. For accuracy, weigh it rather than relying on volume."

faqQ1: "Can I use American mustard for this conversion?"
faqA1: "Yes, the conversion applies to all types of mustard, including American, English, or wholegrain. The weight (75g to ounces) remains the same regardless of variety, though textures may vary slightly."
faqQ2: "Why is weighing mustard better than using volume measurements?"
faqA2: "Weighing is more accurate because mustard’s thickness can affect how much fits in a spoon. 75g of smooth mustard might look different in a tablespoon compared to grainy mustard, but the weight ensures consistency."
faqQ3: "How does mustard affect air fryer cooking times?"
faqA3: "Mustard in marinades or glazes can add moisture, which might slightly extend cooking times. However, 75g is a moderate amount that shouldn’t drastically change your recipe’s timing."
faqQ4: "Where can I find recipes using 75g of mustard?"
faqA4: "Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipes</a> or <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>sauce collections</a> for ideas. Mustard works beautifully in glazes, dressings, and even as a crust for meats."

<h2>Why Convert 75g of Mustard to Ounces?</h2>  
<p>Many air fryer recipes, especially those from the UK, use grams for measurements. However, some kitchen scales or recipes might list ingredients in ounces. Converting 75g of mustard to ounces ensures you’re using the right amount for your dish. This is particularly useful for sauces, dressings, or marinades where balance is key.</p>  
<p>If you’re working with a recipe from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>our collection</a>, you’ll often find both metric and imperial measurements. But when in doubt, our conversion guide has your back. Mustard adds a punchy flavour, so getting the quantity spot-on matters.</p>  

<h2>How to Measure 75g of Mustard Accurately</h2>  
<p>For the most precise measurement, use a digital kitchen scale set to grams. Scoop the mustard into a small bowl until the scale reads 75g. If your scale only shows ounces, aim for 2.65 oz. No scale? A tablespoon of mustard weighs roughly 15g, so 5 tablespoons will get you close to 75g.</p>  
<p>Mustard’s consistency can vary—whether it’s smooth, grainy, or whole grain—so weighing is best.

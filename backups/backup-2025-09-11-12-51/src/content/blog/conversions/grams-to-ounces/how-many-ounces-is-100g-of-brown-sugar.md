faqQ1: "Is 100g of brown sugar the same as 100g of white sugar in ounces?"
faqA1: "Yes, 100g of any sugar (brown or white) equals approximately 3.53 ounces. However, brown sugar is denser when packed, so always measure by weight for accuracy in air fryer recipes."
faqQ2: "Can I use cups instead of ounces for 100g of brown sugar?"
faqA2: "While possible, cups are less precise. 100g of brown sugar is roughly ½ cup when lightly packed. For best results in air fryer baking, use a scale to measure 3.53 ounces (100g) directly."
faqQ3: "Why does my air fryer recipe call for grams instead of ounces?"
faqA3: "Many UK and European recipes use metric measurements. Converting 100g to 3.53 ounces ensures accuracy, especially for baked goods where precision affects texture. Always check the recipe’s origin for measurement preferences."
faqQ4: "How do I adjust cooking time when using 100g of brown sugar in air fryer desserts?"
faqA4: "Sugar quantity rarely affects air fryer timing—stick to the recipe’s suggested duration. However, sugary glazes or toppings may brown faster, so check dishes a few minutes early to prevent burning."

<h2>Why converting 100g of brown sugar to ounces matters</h2>  
<p>When using an air fryer, precise measurements can make or break a recipe. Brown sugar, with its moisture content, can vary slightly in weight, but 100g reliably converts to 3.53 ounces. This accuracy is especially important for baking, where even small deviations can affect texture and taste.</p>  

<p>Many UK recipes, including those on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, list ingredients in grams. If your kitchen scale measures in ounces, this conversion ensures you’re using the right amount. No more guesswork—just perfect results every time.</p>  

<h3>How to measure brown sugar accurately</h3>  
<p>For the best results, use a digital kitchen scale to weigh your brown sugar. If you don’t have one, spoon the sugar into a measuring cup and level it off. Remember, packed brown sugar will weigh more than loosely filled, so 100g (3.53 oz) should be lightly packed for consistency.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for 100g of brown sugar in air fryer recipes</h2>  
<p>From cookies to glazes, 100g of brown sugar is a versatile ingredient. Try it in air fryer desserts like sticky toffee pudding or cinnamon rolls. You’ll find plenty of inspiration in the <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert category</a> on our site.</p>

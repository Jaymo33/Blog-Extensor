faqQ1: "Can I use fresh garlic instead of 20g garlic paste in air fryer recipes?"
faqA1: "Yes, you can substitute fresh garlic for garlic paste. One clove of fresh garlic weighs about 5g, so 20g of garlic paste is roughly equivalent to four cloves. Adjust to taste, as fresh garlic has a slightly different flavour profile."
faqQ2: "How long does 20g of garlic paste last in the fridge?"
faqA2: "When stored in an airtight container, 20g of garlic paste will stay fresh for up to two weeks in the fridge. For longer storage, freeze it in portions—each cube typically holds 10g, making it easy to measure out."
faqQ3: "What’s the best way to measure 20g of garlic paste without a scale?"
faqA3: "If you don’t have a scale, use tablespoons. One tablespoon of garlic paste weighs around 15g, so 20g is roughly 1 and 1/3 tablespoons. This method is less precise but works in a pinch."
faqQ4: "Is 20g of garlic paste the same as 20g of minced garlic?"
faqA4: "Not exactly. Garlic paste is smoother and more concentrated than minced garlic, which has a chunkier texture. While the weight is the same, the texture and intensity of flavour may differ, so adjust recipes accordingly."

<h3>How to Measure 20g of Garlic Paste Without Scales</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a kitchen scale, you can still measure 20g of garlic paste (0.71 oz) using spoons. One tablespoon of garlic paste typically weighs around 15g, so 20g would be roughly 1 and 1/3 tablespoons. This method isn’t as precise as weighing, but it’s a handy workaround for quick recipes.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for Garlic Paste in Air Fryer Recipes</h2>  
<p>Garlic paste is incredibly versatile and works well in marinades, sauces, and rubs for air fryer dishes. For example, a mix of 20g garlic paste (0.71 oz), olive oil, and herbs makes a fantastic marinade for <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>air fryer chicken</a>.

<p>Since garlic paste is concentrated, it blends seamlessly into recipes without leaving chunks. This makes it ideal for dishes where even distribution of flavour is crucial. If you’re new to using garlic paste, start with smaller amounts and adjust to taste.</p>  

<h3>Storing Garlic Paste for Freshness</h3>  
<p>To keep your garlic paste fresh, store it in an airtight container in the fridge. A 20g portion (0.71 oz) will typically last up to two weeks if stored properly. For longer storage, freeze it in ice cube trays—each cube holds about 10g, making it easy to measure out 20g when needed.</p>  

<h2>Converting Other Common Garlic Measurements</h2>

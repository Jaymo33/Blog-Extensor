faqQ1: "Can I use honey instead of 75g maple syrup in recipes?"
faqA1: "Yes, you can substitute honey for maple syrup in most recipes. For 75g of maple syrup (2.65oz), use the same weight of honey. However, honey is sweeter and thicker, so you may need to adjust other liquids in the recipe slightly."
faqQ2: "Why does my air fryer recipe with maple syrup burn so quickly?"
faqA2: "Maple syrup's high sugar content makes it prone to burning in air fryers. When using 75g of maple syrup, try reducing the temperature by 10Â°C and cooking for slightly less time. Alternatively, add the syrup during the last 2-3 minutes of cooking to prevent burning."
faqQ3: "How do I clean maple syrup from my air fryer basket?"
faqA3: "For sticky 75g maple syrup residue, soak the basket in warm soapy water for 10 minutes before scrubbing. For stubborn spots, make a paste of baking soda and water. Always unplug your air fryer and ensure it's completely dry before next use."
faqQ4: "Is 75g of maple syrup the same as 75ml?"
faqA4: "No, 75g of maple syrup is not the same as 75ml. Due to its density, 75g equals about 55ml. Always measure by weight (grams) for accuracy in recipes, especially when converting between metric and imperial measurements like ounces."

<h2>Why accurate maple syrup measurements matter</h2>
<p>Maple syrup is a sticky, viscous liquid where small measurement differences can significantly impact your recipe's outcome. Too much syrup can make dishes overly sweet or cause burning in air fryers, while too little might leave flavours underwhelming. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we recommend using digital scales for grams or proper liquid measuring cups for ounces to ensure accuracy.</p>
<p>Many popular air fryer recipes, like our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>maple-glazed salmon</a> or <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>sticky maple chicken wings</a>, call for precise syrup measurements. The 75g to ounces conversion becomes particularly important when adapting American recipes that use imperial measurements or when your kitchen scales only measure in grams.</p>

<h2>How to measure 75g of maple syrup without scales</h2>
<p>If you don't have digital scales, you can still measure 75g of maple syrup (approximately 2.65 ounces) using volume measurements. Maple syrup has a density of about 1.37 g/ml, meaning 75g equals roughly 55ml or 3.7 tablespoons. However, we always recommend weight measurements for better accuracy.</p>

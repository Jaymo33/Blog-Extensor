faqQ1: "Is 30g of peanut butter the same as 30ml?"
faqA1: "No, 30g and 30ml are not the same for peanut butter. While 30ml of water equals 30g, peanut butter is denser. Roughly, 30g of peanut butter is about 28–30ml, but for accuracy, always weigh it."
faqQ2: "Can I use crunchy peanut butter instead of smooth for air fryer recipes?"
faqA2: "Yes, crunchy peanut butter works in most recipes, but it may alter the texture slightly. For sauces or binding, smooth peanut butter blends more evenly, while crunchy adds a pleasant bite to cookies or granola."
faqQ3: "How many calories are in 30g of peanut butter?"
faqA3: "30g of peanut butter contains roughly 180–200 calories, depending on the brand. It’s energy-dense, so measure carefully if you’re tracking intake."
faqQ4: "Why does my peanut butter measurement seem off?"
faqA4: "Natural peanut butter separates, so always stir it well before measuring. If it’s too oily or thick, your scale or spoon may not capture the correct weight. For precision, use a digital scale."

<h2>How to Measure 30g of Peanut Butter Accurately</h2>  
<p>Using a digital kitchen scale is the easiest way to measure 30g of peanut butter. Simply zero the scale with your container, then scoop the peanut butter until it hits 30g. If you don’t have a scale, two level tablespoons (about 30ml) will roughly equal 30g, though this can vary slightly depending on the peanut butter’s density.</p>  
<p>For sticky ingredients like peanut butter, lightly greasing your measuring spoon or using a spatula can help ensure you get every bit into your mix. This trick is especially handy for air fryer recipes like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cookies>peanut butter cookies</a>, where consistency is key.</p>

faqQ1: "Can I use tomato sauce instead of tomato paste in air fryer recipes?"
faqA1: "Tomato sauce can substitute tomato paste, but you’ll need to adjust quantities. Since tomato paste is concentrated, use three times the amount of tomato sauce for the same flavour intensity. Reduce other liquids in the recipe to maintain consistency."
faqQ2: "How long does tomato paste last once opened?"
faqA2: "Opened tomato paste lasts about 5–7 days in the fridge if stored properly. Transfer it to an airtight container or cover the can tightly with cling film. For longer storage, freeze it in small portions."
faqQ3: "Why is my air fryer recipe too tangy with tomato paste?"
faqA3: "Tomato paste is highly concentrated, so using too much can make dishes overly tangy. Stick to precise measurements like 10g (0.35 oz) and balance it with a pinch of sugar or cream if needed."
faqQ4: "Can I make my own tomato paste for air fryer recipes?"
faqA4: "Yes! Simmer blended tomatoes with a bit of oil and salt until thickened. Homemade tomato paste works well in air fryer recipes, though its consistency may vary slightly from store-bought versions."

faqQ1: "Why does 1000g of cottage cheese equal 35.27 ounces?"
faqA1: "This conversion comes from the standard metric to imperial weight ratio where 1 gram equals approximately 0.03527 ounces. The calculation works for all foods, not just cottage cheese, making it easy to switch between measurement systems in recipes."
faqQ2: "Can I use cups instead of ounces for 1000g cottage cheese?"
faqA2: "While possible, cups measure volume rather than weight, so accuracy varies. 1000g (35.27 oz) of cottage cheese equals about 4.25 US cups, but this depends on how tightly packed it is. For air fryer recipes, weight measurements give more consistent results."
faqQ3: "Does the fat content affect the 1000g to ounces conversion?"
faqA3: "No, the fat percentage in cottage cheese doesn't change the weight conversion. Whether you're using low-fat or full-fat cottage cheese, 1000g will always equal 35.27 ounces. The difference lies in texture and moisture content during cooking."
faqQ4: "How long does 1000g of cottage cheese last in the fridge?"
faqA4: "An unopened 1000g (35.27 oz) container of cottage cheese typically lasts 5-7 days refrigerated after opening. Always check the use-by date and look for any sour smell or mould as signs it's gone bad. For best results, use within 3-4 days of opening."

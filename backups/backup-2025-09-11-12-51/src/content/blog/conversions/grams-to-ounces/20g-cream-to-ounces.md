faqQ1: "Can I use milk instead of 20g of cream in air fryer recipes?"
faqA1: "Yes, but the texture will be lighter. Milk has less fat than cream, so your dish may not be as rich. For best results, use whole milk or add a teaspoon of butter to mimic cream’s consistency."
faqQ2: "How do I measure 20g of cream if I don’t have a scale?"
faqA2: "Use a tablespoon—20g is roughly 1.3 tablespoons of cream. For more accuracy, fill a measuring spoon slightly over the rim. Remember, this method is less precise than weighing but works in emergencies."
faqQ3: "Does 20g of cream make a difference in air fryer baking?"
faqA3: "Absolutely! Cream adds moisture and richness, so 20g (0.7 oz) can affect texture. Too little might dry out cakes, while too much could make them dense. Stick to the recipe for best results."
faqQ4: "Can I freeze 20g portions of cream for later use?"
faqA4: "Yes, freeze cream in small containers or ice cube trays. Thaw in the fridge before using, though it may separate slightly. Whisking or blending can restore its smoothness for cooking."

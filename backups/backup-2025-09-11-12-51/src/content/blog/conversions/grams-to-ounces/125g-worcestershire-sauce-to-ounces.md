faqQ1: "Can I use a tablespoon to measure 125g of Worcestershire sauce?"
faqA1: "While possible, it’s not the most accurate method. One tablespoon of Worcestershire sauce weighs about 15g, so 125g would be roughly 8.3 tablespoons. For precision, especially in air fryer recipes, a scale or liquid measuring cup is better."
faqQ2: "Does Worcestershire sauce weight change if it’s reduced?"
faqA2: "Yes, reducing Worcestershire sauce thickens it, concentrating the flavour and slightly altering the weight per volume. For reductions, measure after cooking to ensure accuracy."
faqQ3: "How long does 125g of Worcestershire sauce last once opened?"
faqA3: "An opened bottle lasts about 1–2 years in the fridge. For best flavour in air fryer recipes, use within 6 months."
faqQ4: "Can I substitute soy sauce for Worcestershire sauce in a 125g measurement?"
faqA4: "Yes, but adjust for saltiness. Soy sauce is saltier, so use 20% less (100g or 3.5 oz) and add a pinch of sugar to mimic Worcestershire’s sweetness."

<h2>Why Convert Worcestershire Sauce from Grams to Ounces?</h2>  
<p>Many UK recipes use grams, while others rely on ounces, especially when referencing older cookbooks or international guides. Converting 125g of Worcestershire sauce to ounces (4.41 oz) ensures accuracy, whether you’re following a <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>classic recipe</a> or experimenting with new flavours. Air fryers, like those featured on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>our site</a>, benefit from precise liquid measurements to avoid overly soggy or dry results.</p>  

<p>Worcestershire sauce is a staple in marinades, glazes, and even <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/beef>beef dishes</a>, so getting the measurement right matters. A slight miscalculation could throw off the balance of sweet, salty, and umami flavours. For best results, use a digital scale for grams or a liquid measuring cup for ounces.</p>  

<h3>Tools for Accurate Measurement</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a scale, a liquid measuring cup with ounce markings will work. Just remember that 125g of Worcestershire sauce is roughly 4.41 fluid ounces.

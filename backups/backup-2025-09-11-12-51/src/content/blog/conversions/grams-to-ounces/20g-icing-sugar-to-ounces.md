faqQ1: "Can I use granulated sugar instead of icing sugar for 20g measurements?"
faqA1: "No, granulated sugar and icing sugar have different textures and weights. 20g of granulated sugar won’t measure the same in volume as icing sugar due to its coarser grain. For best results, stick to icing sugar when the recipe calls for it."
faqQ2: "How do I convert 20g of icing sugar to cups?"
faqA2: "20g of icing sugar is roughly 1/6 cup, but measuring by weight (grams or ounces) is more accurate. Cups can vary based on how tightly the sugar is packed, so a scale is recommended for precision."
faqQ3: "Why does my air fryer dessert taste too sweet with 20g of icing sugar?"
faqA3: "Air fryers intensify flavours, so 20g of icing sugar might be too much for smaller batches. Try reducing the sugar slightly or balancing it with a tart ingredient like lemon zest."
faqQ4: "Can I make icing sugar at home if I run out?"
faqA4: "Yes! Blend 20g of granulated sugar with 1 tsp of cornflour until powdery. This homemade version works well in a pinch for dusting or light frostings."

<h3>How to Measure 20g of Icing Sugar Without a Scale</h3>

However, for best results, a scale is recommended, especially for air fryer baking where precision matters.</p>

faqQ1: "Can I use dried minced onion instead of fresh for 10g measurements?"
faqA1: "Yes, dried minced onion can substitute fresh in a 1:1 ratio by weight. However, dried onion has a more concentrated flavor, so you might want to use slightly less. Rehydrate it with a teaspoon of water before adding to air fryer recipes for better texture."
faqQ2: "How does 10g of minced onion compare to onion powder?"
faqA2: "10g of minced onion equals about 1.5 teaspoons of onion powder. Minced onion provides texture, while powder blends seamlessly into coatings or rubs. For air fryer recipes, minced onion works better when you want visible bits, like in burgers or stuffings."
faqQ3: "Why do some UK recipes use ounces instead of grams for minced onion?"
faqA3: "Older UK cookbooks often used imperial measurements, while modern recipes favor grams. The difference is minimal for small quantities like 10g (0.35 oz), but it's good to know both. Most digital scales today toggle between units for convenience."
faqQ4: "How long does 10g of minced onion last in the fridge?"
faqA4: "Fresh minced onion keeps for 3-5 days refrigerated in an airtight container. For longer storage, freeze it in 10g portions. Frozen minced onion works perfectly in air fryer recipesâ€”just add it directly without thawing to prevent sogginess."

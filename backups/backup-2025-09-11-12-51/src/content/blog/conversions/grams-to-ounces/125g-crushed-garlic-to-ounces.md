faqQ1: "How do I convert 125g of crushed garlic to ounces without a scale?"
faqA1: "If you don't have a scale, 125g of crushed garlic is roughly 4 heaped tablespoons. However, this can vary slightly depending on how finely the garlic is crushed. For the most accurate results, investing in a digital kitchen scale is recommended."
faqQ2: "Can I use minced garlic instead of crushed garlic in my air fryer recipes?"
faqA2: "Yes, minced garlic can be substituted for crushed garlic, but keep in mind it's slightly denser. Use about 10% less minced garlic by weight to match the flavour intensity. Always adjust seasoning to taste."

faqA3: "Freshly crushed garlic lasts about 1-2 weeks in the fridge if stored in an airtight container. For longer storage, freeze it in portions. Just note that frozen garlic may lose some of its pungency over time."
faqQ4: "Why does my air fryer recipe taste too garlicky even with 125g of crushed garlic?"

<h3>Converting Other Garlic Measurements</h3>  
<p>If your recipe calls for minced or whole garlic cloves, the weight will differ. One medium garlic clove weighs about 3-7g, so 125g would be roughly 18-42 cloves. Minced garlic is slightly denser than crushed, so adjust accordingly. Always double-check conversions for the best results.</p>

faqQ1: "Can I use tablespoons instead of grams for hot sauce?"
faqA1: "Yes, but accuracy varies. One tablespoon of hot sauce is roughly 15g, so 10g would be about two-thirds of a tablespoon. For precise results, especially in air fryer recipes, a scale is best."
faqQ2: "Does the type of hot sauce affect the weight?"
faqA2: "Slightly. Thicker sauces like chipotle may weigh more per volume than thinner ones like Tabasco. However, 10g of any hot sauce will still be close to 0.35 ounces—just adjust for texture if mixing into batters or marinades."
faqQ3: "How do I convert larger amounts of hot sauce to ounces?"
faqA3: "Multiply grams by 0.035 to get ounces. For example, 50g of hot sauce equals 1.75 ounces. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a> simplifies larger batches for air fryer cooking."
faqQ4: "Why is my air-fried dish too spicy with 10g of hot sauce?"
faqA4: "Hot sauce potency varies by brand. Start with 5g (0.17 oz) if using extra-spicy varieties, then adjust. Pairing it with creamy ingredients like yogurt can also balance heat in air fryer meals."

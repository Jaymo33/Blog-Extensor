faqQ1: "Is 250g of granulated sugar the same as 250ml?"
faqA1: "No, 250g of granulated sugar isn’t the same as 250ml. Grams measure weight, while millilitres measure volume. Granulated sugar’s density means 250g takes up slightly less space than 250ml. For accuracy, always weigh sugar when baking in your air fryer."
faqQ2: "Can I use a US cup to measure 250g of granulated sugar?"
faqA2: "US cups differ from metric cups. One US cup holds about 200g of granulated sugar, so 250g would be roughly 1.25 US cups. However, weighing is far more precise, especially for air fryer recipes where exact ratios affect cooking times and textures."
faqQ3: "Does the type of sugar affect the 250g to ounces conversion?"
faqA3: "Granulated, caster, and icing sugars have slightly different weights per volume due to grain size. However, 250g of any sugar type still equals 8.82 ounces by weight. The variance comes when measuring by volume (cups or spoons), where finer sugars pack more densely."
faqQ4: "How do I adjust air fryer settings for recipes with 250g of sugar?"
faqA4: "Sugar-heavy recipes like cakes or cookies may brown faster in the air fryer. Reduce temperature by 5-10°C and check a few minutes early. For even cooking, rotate the basket halfway.

<h2>Why convert 250g of granulated sugar to ounces?</h2>
<p>Many UK recipes use grams, while some kitchen scales or older cookbooks prefer ounces. Converting 250g of granulated sugar to ounces (8.82 oz) ensures you follow recipes correctly, especially in air fryer baking where precision matters. A slight mismeasurement can affect texture, rise, or sweetness. For example, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer cake recipes</a> rely on exact sugar quantities for perfect results.</p>
<p>Air fryers cook faster than conventional ovens, so balanced ingredients are crucial. Too much sugar can cause over-browning, while too little may leave desserts bland.

<p>For the best results, use digital kitchen scales set to grams or ounces. If your scale only shows ounces, 250g of granulated sugar translates to 8.82 oz. Scoop the sugar lightly into a measuring cup without packing it down to avoid over-measuring. For sticky or clumped sugar, fluff it with a fork first.</p>
<p>Precision is key in air fryer recipes like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cookies>cookies</a>, where sugar affects spread and crispness. If you lack scales, 250g roughly fills a metric cup (250ml), but weighing is always more reliable.</p>

<h3>Common uses for 250g of granulated sugar</h3>
<p>This amount is ideal for classic bakes. It’s the standard sugar quantity in many <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>air fryer cake recipes</a>, such as Victoria sponge or cupcakes. You’ll also need 250g (8.82 oz) for batches of shortbread, meringues, or syrups for glazing.</p>

<h2>Converting other sugar quantities</h2>
<p>Once you master 250g granulated sugar to ounces (8.82 oz), scaling recipes becomes easier. For 125g, halve it to 4.41 oz; for 500g, double to 17.64 oz. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> covers all common measurements, from flour to butter.</p>
<p>Remember, brown or icing sugar weighs differently due to moisture or fineness. Always check specific conversions for these types. For more tips, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert category</a> for air fryer-friendly sweets.</p>

<h3>Storing granulated sugar for air fryer baking</h3>

faqQ1: "Can I use white flour instead of wholemeal flour in a 30g measurement?"
faqA1: "Yes, but adjust for density. White flour weighs less, so 30g (1.06 oz) of wholemeal flour isn’t a direct swap. For air fryer recipes, use 10% less white flour or add a teaspoon of liquid to compensate."
faqQ2: "Why does my air fryer bake differ when using 30g wholemeal flour?"
faqA2: "Wholemeal flour absorbs more moisture and cooks faster in air fryers. Ensure you’ve converted 30g to ounces (1.06 oz) correctly, and consider reducing temperature by 5°C to prevent dryness."
faqQ3: "How do I store wholemeal flour after measuring 30g portions?"
faqA3: "Keep it airtight in a cool, dark place. Wholemeal flour spoils faster due to its oil content. Pre-measure 30g (1.06 oz) batches in jars for easy access when baking."
faqQ4: "Is 30g of wholemeal flour the same as 30g of self-raising flour in ounces?"
faqA4: "Weight-wise, yes—both are 1.06 oz. However, self-raising flour contains raising agents, so swap carefully in recipes. For air fryer baking, stick to the specified flour type for best results."

faqQ1: "What’s the difference between 138 C in a fan oven and a conventional oven?"
faqA1: "A fan oven at 138 C cooks food faster and more evenly than a conventional oven at the same temperature due to circulating hot air. You’ll typically need to reduce the temperature by about 20 C when using a fan oven."
faqQ2: "Can I use 138 C in my air fryer for baking?"
faqA2: "Yes, you can use 138 C in your air fryer for baking, but adjust the time as air fryers cook faster. Start by reducing the cooking time by 20% and check for doneness regularly."
faqQ3: "How do I convert 138 C to a gas mark setting?"
faqA3: "138 C is roughly equivalent to Gas Mark 1. However, for fan ovens or air fryers, you’ll need to adjust downward to around 120 C for similar results."
faqQ4: "Why does my food cook unevenly at 138 C in the air fryer?"
faqA4: "Uneven cooking can happen if the air fryer basket is overcrowded or not preheated. Ensure proper spacing and shake the basket halfway through cooking for even results."

<p>138 C in a fan oven is equivalent to approximately 120 C when using a conventional oven setting. This conversion is crucial for air fryer users, as most air fryers operate like fan ovens, circulating hot air for even cooking. Understanding this temperature adjustment ensures your recipes turn out perfectly every time. Whether you're baking, roasting, or reheating, getting the temperature right is key.

<h2>Why Convert 138 C to Fan Oven?</h2>
<p>Fan ovens and air fryers work differently from conventional ovens. They use a fan to circulate hot air, which cooks food faster and more evenly. This means you often need to adjust the temperature downward. Converting 138 C to a fan oven setting ensures your food doesn’t overcook or dry out. It’s especially important for delicate dishes like cakes or pastries. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more details.</p>

<p>Many recipes are written for conventional ovens, so knowing how to adjust them for your air fryer is essential. A 138 C fan oven setting will give you similar results to a conventional oven at 138 C, but with shorter cooking times. This is because the circulating air speeds up the cooking process. Always keep an eye on your food the first time you try a new conversion. For recipe ideas, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipes section</a>.</p>

<h3>How to Adjust Cooking Times</h3>
<p>When converting 138 C to a fan oven, you’ll also need to adjust the cooking time. Start by reducing the time by about 20% and check your food regularly. Air fryers are efficient, so dishes often cook faster than in a conventional oven. For example, a cake that takes 30 minutes at 138 C in a conventional oven might only need 24 minutes in a fan oven. Always use a skewer or thermometer to test for doneness.</p>

<h2>Best Practices for Air Fryer Cooking</h2>
<p>Using an air fryer at 138 C fan oven setting requires a few adjustments. Preheat your air fryer for 3-5 minutes to ensure even cooking. Avoid overcrowding the basket, as this can block airflow and lead to uneven results. Shake or turn food halfway through cooking for the best texture.

<p>Different foods react differently to 138 C in a fan oven. Vegetables might roast perfectly, while meats may need a slightly higher temperature. Experiment with small batches to find the ideal settings for your favorite dishes.

With practice, you’ll master the art of air fryer cooking at any temperature.</p>

<h3>Common Mistakes to Avoid</h3>
<p>One common mistake is not adjusting the temperature when converting 138 C to a fan oven. This can lead to burnt or undercooked food. Another pitfall is forgetting to reduce the cooking time, as fan ovens cook faster. Always use an oven thermometer to verify your air fryer’s temperature accuracy. Lastly, avoid using non-air-fryer-safe cookware, as it can affect cooking performance.</p>

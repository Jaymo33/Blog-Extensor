faqQ1: "How do I convert 198 C to fan oven for baking cakes?"
faqA1: "For baking cakes at 198 C in a fan oven, reduce the temperature to 175 C. The fan circulates heat more efficiently, so this lower setting prevents over-browning while ensuring even baking. Always check cakes 5-10 minutes before the recipe's suggested time."
faqQ2: "Can I use the same 198 C to fan oven conversion in my air fryer?"
faqA2: "Yes, the 198 C to fan oven conversion works perfectly for air fryers too. Set your air fryer to 175 C for equivalent results. Remember that air fryers cook faster due to their compact size, so reduce cooking times by about 15-20% compared to conventional oven recipes."
faqQ3: "Why do fan ovens need lower temperatures than conventional ovens?"
faqA3: "Fan ovens circulate hot air continuously, creating more efficient heat transfer. This means food cooks faster and more evenly at lower temperatures. Converting 198 C to 175 C in a fan oven compensates for this increased efficiency while delivering similar results to conventional baking."
faqQ4: "What's the best way to check if my fan oven temperature is accurate?"
faqA4: "Use an independent oven thermometer to verify your fan oven's temperature accuracy. Place it in the centre of the oven while preheating to 175 C (for 198 C conversion). If there's significant variance, you may need to adjust your settings or have your oven calibrated professionally."

<p>198 C in a fan oven is equivalent to approximately 175 C with the fan assist. This conversion is crucial for achieving perfect baking results in modern convection ovens and air fryers. The fan circulates hot air more efficiently, allowing you to reduce the temperature while maintaining cooking performance.</p>

<h2>Understanding Fan Oven Conversions</h2>
<p>When converting 198 C to fan oven settings, you'll typically reduce the temperature by 20-25 degrees. This adjustment accounts for the fan's efficient heat distribution.

<h3>Why 198 C Matters in Baking</h3>
<p>198 C is a common temperature for many baked goods, from cakes to roasted vegetables. When using a fan oven or air fryer, adjusting this to 175 C ensures your food won't dry out or brown too quickly. The circulating air in fan ovens and air fryers creates an ideal environment for even cooking at slightly lower temperatures.</p>

<h2>Air Fryer Equivalent for 198 C</h2>

Keeping your air fryer clean is also crucial for accurate temperature performance - try our recommended <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning products</a>.</p>

<h3>Practical Tips for Temperature Accuracy</h3>
<p>Always preheat your fan oven or air fryer when converting 198 C to ensure temperature stability. Use an oven thermometer to verify your appliance's accuracy, as some models may run hotter or cooler than their displays indicate. This is especially important when working with precise baking temperatures.</p>

<h2>Common Uses for 198 C in Fan Ovens</h2>
<p>Many classic British bakes work beautifully at 198 C (175 C fan). Victoria sponge, scones, and shortbread all benefit from this moderate baking temperature. When using your fan oven or air fryer, the reduced temperature prevents over-browning while ensuring thorough cooking. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert recipes</a> showcase how versatile this temperature can be.</p>

<p>Roasting vegetables at 198 C in a fan oven (175 C actual) yields perfectly caramelised results without burning. The circulating air helps create that desirable crispy exterior while keeping interiors tender. This temperature is also ideal for reheating pre-cooked dishes in your air fryer while maintaining texture.</p>

<h3>Adjusting Cooking Times</h3>
<p>When converting 198 C to fan oven settings, remember that cooking times may be 10-15% shorter than conventional oven recipes suggest. Start checking your food a few minutes early, especially when using an air fryer. The compact space and efficient air circulation can accelerate cooking compared to standard ovens.</p>

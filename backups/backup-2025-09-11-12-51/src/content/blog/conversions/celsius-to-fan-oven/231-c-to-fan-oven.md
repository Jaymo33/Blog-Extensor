faqQ1: "What’s the difference between 231 C and fan oven 210 C?"
faqA1: "The difference is due to the fan oven’s efficient air circulation, which cooks food faster. 231 C in a conventional oven equals 210 C in a fan oven to prevent overcooking."
faqQ2: "Can I use 231 C in my air fryer?"
faqA2: "No, you should reduce it to 210 C for air fryers, as they work like fan ovens. This ensures even cooking and prevents burning."
faqQ3: "Why do fan ovens need lower temperatures?"
faqA3: "Fan ovens circulate hot air, cooking food more efficiently. Lower temperatures (like 210 C instead of 231 C) prevent over-browning or drying out."
faqQ4: "How do I adjust baking times for 231 C in a fan oven?"
faqA4: "Reduce baking times by 5-10 minutes when using 210 C in a fan oven. Always check food early, as fan ovens cook faster than conventional ones."

<p>231 C converts to approximately 210 C in a fan oven. This adjustment accounts for the efficient heat circulation in fan-assisted ovens, which cook food faster and more evenly. Whether you're baking cakes or roasting vegetables, this conversion ensures your dishes turn out perfectly every time. For air fryer users, this temperature is ideal for achieving crispy results without overcooking.

<h2>Why Convert 231 C to Fan Oven?</h2>
<p>Fan ovens circulate hot air, reducing cooking times and temperatures compared to conventional ovens. Converting 231 C to 210 C in a fan oven prevents overcooking and ensures even browning. This is especially useful for delicate baked goods like sponges or pastries. Air fryers, which work similarly to fan ovens, also benefit from this adjustment. Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more details.</p>

<p>Many recipes, especially older ones, list temperatures for conventional ovens. Using 231 C in a fan oven could lead to dry or burnt food. By lowering the temperature to 210 C, you maintain the intended cooking results. This is crucial for dishes like roast chicken or baked potatoes.

<h2>How to Use 231 C in an Air Fryer</h2>
<p>Air fryers operate like mini fan ovens, so the same temperature conversion applies. Setting your air fryer to 210 C when a recipe calls for 231 C ensures perfect results. This is ideal for crispy fries, roasted veggies, or even baking small cakes. Always preheat your air fryer for consistent cooking.

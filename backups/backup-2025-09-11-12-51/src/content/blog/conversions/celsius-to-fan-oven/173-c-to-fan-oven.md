faqQ1: "How does 173 C compare to air fryer temperatures?"
faqA1: "173 C converts to about 150 C in air fryers, following standard fan oven reduction principles. Air fryers cook even faster due to their compact size, so you may need to reduce times slightly beyond the temperature adjustment."
faqQ2: "Can I use 173 C recipes directly in my fan oven?"
faqA2: "No, you should always convert 173 C recipes to about 150 C for fan ovens. The circulating air cooks food more efficiently, so direct use of conventional temperatures risks over-cooking or burning."
faqQ3: "Why do fan ovens need lower temperatures than conventional?"
faqA3: "The constant air movement in fan ovens transfers heat more effectively to food surfaces. This allows for lower temperature settings (like 150 C instead of 173 C) while achieving similar or better cooking results in less time."
faqQ4: "How do I adjust baking times when converting 173 C to fan oven?"
faqA4: "When using the 150 C fan oven equivalent of 173 C, start by reducing cooking times by 10-15%. Check for doneness 5-10 minutes before the original recipe's suggested time, especially for items like cakes or cookies."

<p>173 C converts to approximately 150 C in a fan oven. This 20-25°C reduction is standard when adapting conventional oven temperatures for fan-assisted cooking. Whether you're using an air fryer or convection oven, understanding this conversion ensures your recipes turn out perfectly every time.</p>

<h2>Why Fan Oven Temperatures Differ</h2>
<p>Fan ovens circulate hot air constantly, cooking food faster and more evenly than conventional ovens. The forced air movement means you can lower the temperature while achieving similar results. This principle applies directly to air fryers, which are essentially compact convection ovens. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we recommend always checking conversion charts when trying new recipes.</p>

<p>For baking especially, the 173 C to fan oven adjustment prevents over-browning. Cakes, cookies and pastries benefit from this gentler heat distribution. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> provides detailed guidance for various cooking methods beyond just temperature adjustments.</p>

<h3>Air Fryer Specific Considerations</h3>
<p>When converting 173 C to fan oven settings for air fryers, basket size affects cooking times. Smaller capacities may require slightly shorter durations even at the adjusted 150 C. Always preheat your air fryer for 3-5 minutes when baking, just as you would a conventional oven.</p>

<h2>Practical Conversion Examples</h2>
<p>Let's examine how 173 C translates across different cooking scenarios. Roasting vegetables at 173 C in a conventional oven becomes 150 C in a fan oven or air fryer. For <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipes</a>, this lower temperature prevents drying out while ensuring crispy skin.</p>

<p>When baking at 173 C, the fan oven equivalent maintains moisture better. This is particularly important for delicate items like soufflés or custards. Our testing shows that 150 C in a fan oven produces identical texture to 173 C conventional baking, just with 15-20% less time.</p>

<h3>Temperature Accuracy Tips</h3>
<p>Not all ovens maintain exact temperatures. We recommend using an independent oven thermometer to verify your 173 C to fan oven conversion. Air fryers tend to be more precise, but checking never hurts. For perfect <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/potatoes>roast potatoes</a>, this attention to detail makes all the difference.</p>

<h2>Adjusting Cooking Times</h2>
<p>While 173 C converts to 150 C in fan ovens, timing adjustments complete the equation. As a rule, reduce conventional oven times by 10-15% when using the fan equivalent. However, always check food 5-10 minutes early, especially when air frying smaller portions.</p>

<p>For foods requiring precise internal temperatures (like meats), use a probe thermometer regardless of your 173 C to fan oven conversion. The <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipes section</a> on our site includes specific timing guidance for various air fryer models and capacities.</p>

<h3>Common Mistakes to Avoid</h3>
<p>Overcrowding the basket defeats the purpose of converting 173 C to fan oven settings. Proper air circulation is crucial for even cooking. Also, resist opening the air fryer frequently to check progress - each peek adds several minutes to your cooking time.</p>

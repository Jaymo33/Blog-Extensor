faqQ1: "What’s the difference between 189 C in a conventional oven and a fan oven?"
faqA1: "A conventional oven at 189 C is roughly equivalent to 170 C in a fan oven. Fan ovens circulate hot air, so they cook more evenly and efficiently, allowing you to reduce the temperature."
faqQ2: "Can I use 189 C in an air fryer instead of a fan oven?"
faqA2: "Yes, but you’ll need to adjust the temperature. Set your air fryer to around 170 C, as it works similarly to a fan oven. Cooking times may also be shorter."
faqQ3: "Why do recipes often use 189 C for baking?"
faqA3: "189 C is a common temperature for baking because it provides a good balance between browning and cooking through. It’s ideal for cakes, cookies, and roasted dishes."
faqQ4: "How do I convert 189 C to a gas mark setting?"
faqA4: "189 C is roughly gas mark 5. If using a fan oven, reduce it to gas mark 4 (170 C) for equivalent results. Always check your oven’s manual for precise settings."

<p>189 C converts to approximately 170 C in a fan oven. This is because fan ovens circulate hot air, allowing you to reduce the temperature by around 10-20% for even cooking. Whether you're baking a cake or roasting vegetables, this conversion ensures your dishes come out perfectly every time.</p>

<h2>Why Convert 189 C to Fan Oven?</h2>
<p>Fan ovens cook food more efficiently than conventional ovens, thanks to their built-in fans that distribute heat evenly. When a recipe calls for 189 C, it’s usually designed for a traditional oven. Converting 189 C to fan oven settings (around 170 C) prevents overcooking and ensures your food is evenly baked. This is especially useful for air fryers, which work similarly to fan ovens.</p>
<p>If you’re using an air fryer, you might wonder how 189 C translates. Most air fryers operate like mini fan ovens, so the same rule applies. For example, if a recipe suggests 189 C in a conventional oven, set your air fryer to 170 C. You can find more tips on our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>

<h2>How to Adjust Cooking Times</h2>
<p>Reducing the temperature isn’t the only adjustment you might need. Cooking times can also vary when converting 189 C to fan oven settings. Since fan ovens cook faster, you may need to shorten the cooking time by 5-10 minutes. Keep an eye on your food, especially when trying a new recipe.</p>
<p>For air fryers, the cooking time might be even shorter. A dish that takes 30 minutes at 189 C in a conventional oven could be done in 20-25 minutes at 170 C in an air fryer.

<h3>Common Dishes at 189 C in a Fan Oven</h3>
<p>Many recipes, especially baked goods, call for 189 C. Here are a few examples where converting to 170 C in a fan oven works perfectly:</p>
<ul>
<li>Victoria sponge cake</li>
<li>Roast chicken thighs</li>
<li>Homemade cookies</li>
<li>Roasted vegetables</li>
</ul>

<h2>Tips for Perfect Results</h2>
<p>When using 189 C in a fan oven or air fryer, a few extra tips can make all the difference. Always preheat your appliance to ensure even cooking from the start. Use a light-coloured baking tray to prevent over-browning, and rotate your food halfway through if needed.</p>
<p>Cleaning your air fryer after each use is also crucial for maintaining performance. Our guide on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>how to clean an air fryer</a> makes it quick and easy.</p>

<h3>Air Fryer vs. Fan Oven</h3>
<p>While both appliances use circulating hot air, air fryers are more compact and cook faster. If a recipe suggests 189 C in a fan oven, you might need to reduce the temperature further in an air fryer. Experiment with 160-165 C for the best results, especially with smaller portions.</p>

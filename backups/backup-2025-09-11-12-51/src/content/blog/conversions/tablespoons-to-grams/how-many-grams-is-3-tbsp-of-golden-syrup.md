faqQ1: "Can I use honey instead of golden syrup in air fryer recipes?"
faqA1: "Yes, you can substitute honey for golden syrup, but adjust the quantity. Honey is slightly thinner, so use about 10% less by weight. For 3 tbsp (63g) golden syrup, use roughly 57g honey. Note that honey’s stronger flavour may alter the taste of your dish."
faqQ2: "Why does my air fryer smoke when cooking with golden syrup?"
faqA2: "Smoke occurs when syrup drips onto the heating element. Prevent this by using liners, applying syrups midway through cooking, or diluting the syrup with water. Always monitor high-sugar foods in the air fryer to avoid burning."
faqQ3: "How do I clean golden syrup from my air fryer basket?"
faqA3: "Soak the basket in warm, soapy water to loosen sticky residue. For tough spots, use a soft brush or our recommended <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning methods</a>. Avoid abrasive pads that could damage non-stick coatings."
faqQ4: "Does golden syrup measurement change if it’s cold?"
faqA4: "Cold syrup is thicker and harder to measure accurately. For precise 3 tbsp (63g) portions, gently warm the syrup first. This ensures it pours evenly and gives consistent results in your air fryer recipes."

<p>3 tablespoons (tbsp) of golden syrup equals approximately 63 grams (g). This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements can make or break your dish. Whether you’re baking a cake or glazing meats, knowing the exact weight ensures consistent results every time.</p>

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on even heat distribution, and incorrect ingredient quantities can lead to uneven cooking or texture issues. Golden syrup, a staple in British baking, adds moisture and sweetness, so getting the right amount is crucial. Too much can make dishes overly sticky, while too little might leave them dry.</p>  
<p>For example, if you’re making sticky toffee pudding in your air fryer, 3 tbsp of golden syrup (63g) will give the perfect caramelised finish. Check out more <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer dessert recipes</a> for inspiration. Always measure syrups by weight for accuracy, as their viscosity can make volume measurements unreliable.</p>

<h3>How to measure golden syrup for air fryer recipes</h3>  
<p>Use a digital kitchen scale for the most precise conversion of 3 tbsp golden syrup to grams. Lightly grease your spoon or cup to help the syrup slide off easily. If you don’t have scales, remember that 1 tbsp ≈ 21g, so 3 tbsp ≈ 63g. This method works for most UK golden syrup brands like Lyle’s.</p>

<h2>Common uses for golden syrup in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Golden syrup isn’t just for treacle tarts—it’s fantastic in air fryer glazes, marinades, and even savoury dishes. A 3-tbsp (63g) quantity can sweeten a batch of air-fried flapjacks or add shine to roasted vegetables. Its high sugar content also promotes caramelisation, giving dishes that irresistible golden colour.</p>  
<p>Try using 3 tbsp golden syrup in our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>air fryer chicken glaze</a> recipe. The 63g measurement ensures balanced sweetness without overpowering other flavours. For sticky ribs or wings, combine it with soy sauce and garlic for a quick, crowd-pleasing sauce.</p>

<h3>Converting other syrup measurements</h3>  
<p>If your recipe calls for different amounts, here’s a handy guide: 1 tbsp ≈ 21g, 2 tbsp ≈ 42g, and 4 tbsp ≈ 84g. Bookmark our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for quick reference. Remember that syrup density can vary slightly by brand, so when precision matters, always weigh rather than measure by volume.</p>

<h2>Tips for working with golden syrup in air fryers</h2>  
<p>Golden syrup can drip and cause smoke if it touches the air fryer basket. To prevent this, line the basket with parchment or a silicone liner when using sticky ingredients. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaning guide</a> has tips for tackling any syrup spills. Also, warm the syrup slightly before measuring—it flows more easily and gives more accurate results.</p>  
<p>When substituting golden syrup (3 tbsp/63g) in recipes, note that honey or maple syrup have different weights. Always check conversions to avoid altering your dish’s texture. For perfect <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>air fryer cakes</a>, stick to the specified 63g for 3 tbsp unless the recipe suggests otherwise.</p>

<h3>Storing golden syrup for air fryer recipes</h3>  
<p>Keep your golden syrup in a cool, dry place to maintain its consistency. If it crystallises, gently warm the tin in hot water before measuring out your 3 tbsp (63g). An opened tin lasts about 6 months—just wipe the rim clean after each use to prevent stickiness.</p>

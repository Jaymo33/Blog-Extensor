faqQ1: "Can I use baking powder instead of baking soda in air fryer recipes?"
faqA1: "Baking powder and baking soda aren’t interchangeable. Baking soda requires an acidic ingredient to activate, while baking powder contains its own acid. Substituting one for the other can alter texture and taste. For best results, stick to the recipe’s specified leavening agent."
faqQ2: "Why does my air fryer recipe taste bitter with baking soda?"
faqA2: "Bitterness usually means you’ve used too much baking soda. Even a slight excess, like 0.5 tbsp instead of 0.25 tbsp, can overwhelm the dish. Always measure carefully—using grams (3.75g for 0.25 tbsp) ensures accuracy. Rinsing baking soda-coated foods before cooking can also help."
faqQ3: "How do I store baking soda to keep it fresh for air fryer recipes?"
faqA3: "Store baking soda in an airtight container in a cool, dry place. Moisture and heat can reduce its potency over time. To test freshness, mix 1/4 tsp with vinegar—if it bubbles vigorously, it’s still active. Replace every 6 months for best results."
faqQ4: "Can I reduce the baking soda in my air fryer recipe for dietary reasons?"
faqA4: "Reducing baking soda may affect texture, especially in baked goods. For low-sodium diets, try using half the amount (e.g., 1.875g instead of 3.75g for 0.25 tbsp) and add an extra egg white for lift. Experiment with small batches to find the right balance."

faqQ1: "Does the weight of soy milk change if it's sweetened or flavoured?"
faqA1: "Sweetened or flavoured soy milk may have a slightly higher weight due to added sugars or thickeners. However, the difference is minimal—around 1-2 grams per tablespoon. For precise baking, stick to plain, unsweetened soy milk unless the recipe specifies otherwise."
faqQ2: "Can I use almond milk instead of soy milk in air fryer recipes?"
faqA2: "Yes, almond milk can be substituted, but it has a thinner consistency. 1 tbsp of almond milk weighs about 12 grams, so adjust quantities accordingly. Keep in mind that flavour and texture may vary slightly in the final dish."
faqQ3: "Why is weighing soy milk better than using tablespoons?"
faqA3: "Weighing eliminates inconsistencies caused by how the spoon is filled (level or heaped). Digital scales ensure accuracy, which is crucial for air fryer recipes where precise ratios affect cooking time and texture."
faqQ4: "How do I convert grams of soy milk to cups for larger recipes?"
faqA4: "1 cup of soy milk is roughly 240 grams (or 16 tablespoons). For exact measurements, use a scale or refer to our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a>. This helps when scaling up batters or sauces for air frying."

<p>1 tablespoon (tbsp) of soy milk weighs approximately 15 grams. This measurement is essential for precise cooking, especially in air fryer recipes where ingredient ratios can affect texture and cooking times. Whether you're baking, marinating, or making sauces, knowing the exact weight ensures consistent results every time.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on hot air circulation to cook food evenly, and small deviations in ingredient quantities can impact the final dish. For example, adding too much soy milk to a batter can make it too runny, leading to uneven cooking. On the other hand, too little might dry out your dish. That's why converting 1 tbsp of soy milk to grams (15g) is so useful for precision.</p>

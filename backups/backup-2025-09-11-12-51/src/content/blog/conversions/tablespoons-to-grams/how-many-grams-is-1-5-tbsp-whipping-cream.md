faqQ1: "Can I use double cream instead of whipping cream in air fryer recipes?"
faqA1: "Yes, you can substitute double cream for whipping cream, but keep in mind it has a higher fat content. This means 1.5 tbsp of double cream will weigh slightly more—about 24 grams. Adjust your recipe accordingly to avoid overly rich results."
faqQ2: "Why is weighing whipping cream better than measuring by volume?"
faqA2: "Weighing in grams is more accurate because the thickness of whipping cream can vary. A tablespoon might hold slightly different amounts depending on how it's scooped. Grams ensure consistency, which is especially important for air fryer recipes where precision affects cooking times."
faqQ3: "How do I convert other amounts of whipping cream from tbsp to grams?"
faqA3: "The general rule is 1 tbsp of whipping cream equals 15 grams. So for 2 tbsp, it's 30 grams, and for 0.5 tbsp, it's 7.5 grams. Use this ratio to scale up or down based on your recipe needs."
faqQ4: "Can I freeze leftover whipping cream after measuring 1.5 tbsp?"
faqA4: "Whipping cream can be frozen, but it may separate when thawed. It's best used in cooked dishes rather than for whipping after freezing. If you frequently need small amounts like 1.5 tbsp, consider buying smaller containers to minimise waste."

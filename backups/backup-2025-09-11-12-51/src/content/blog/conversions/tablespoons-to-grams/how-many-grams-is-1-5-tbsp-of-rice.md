faqQ1: "Does the type of rice affect the weight of 1.5 tbsp?"
faqA1: "Yes, the type of rice can slightly alter the weight. While 1.5 tbsp of white rice is about 18 grams, brown rice may weigh closer to 20 grams due to its density. Short-grain or sticky rice varieties can also differ, so weighing them once is helpful for accuracy."
faqQ2: "Can I use 1.5 tbsp of rice for air fryer recipes?"
faqA2: "Absolutely! This measurement is ideal for small portions in air fryer dishes like stuffed peppers or rice cakes. Just ensure the rice is pre-cooked or soaked to avoid uneven results. For larger batches, scale up the measurement accordingly."
faqQ3: "How do I measure 1.5 tbsp of rice without a scale?"
faqA3: "Use a standard tablespoon and fill it level, without packing the rice down. Two half-tablespoons plus another half will give you 1.5 tbsp, equating to roughly 18 grams. For precision, consider investing in a cheap kitchen scale."
faqQ4: "Why is my air fryer rice coming out dry?"
faqA4: "Dry rice in the air fryer often means it wasn’t pre-cooked or soaked enough. Try parboiling the rice for 5 minutes before air frying, or add a splash of water to the basket. Also, avoid overcooking—check for doneness a few minutes early."

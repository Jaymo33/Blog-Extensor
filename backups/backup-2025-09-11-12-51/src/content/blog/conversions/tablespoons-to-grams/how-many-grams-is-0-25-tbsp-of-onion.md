faqQ1: "How do I convert 0.25 tbsp of onion to grams if I don’t have a scale?"
faqA1: "If you don’t have a scale, you can use measuring spoons. A 1/2 teaspoon is equivalent to 0.25 tbsp, so fill it halfway. Alternatively, a standard UK teaspoon holds about 5 grams, so you’d use roughly three-quarters of it for 3.75 grams."
faqQ2: "Can I use dried onion instead of fresh for this measurement?"
faqA2: "Yes, but dried onion is more concentrated. Generally, 1 tbsp of fresh onion equals about 1 teaspoon of dried. For 0.25 tbsp of fresh onion, you’d use approximately 0.25 teaspoon of dried onion, which weighs around 1 gram."
faqQ3: "Why does the weight of onion vary in different recipes?"
faqA3: "The weight can vary based on how finely the onion is chopped or grated. Finely diced onion packs more tightly, increasing the weight per tablespoon. For consistency, always measure onions the same way your recipe specifies, whether chopped, sliced, or minced."
faqQ4: "How can I use 0.25 tbsp of onion in an air fryer recipe?"
faqA4: "This small amount is perfect for seasoning marinades, dressings, or as a subtle flavour enhancer in dishes like air-fried vegetables or meats. Mix it with oil and herbs for a quick glaze, or sprinkle it over potatoes before air frying for extra taste."

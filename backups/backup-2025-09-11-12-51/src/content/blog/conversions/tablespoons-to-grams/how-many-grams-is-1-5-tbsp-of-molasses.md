faqQ1: "Can I use golden syrup instead of molasses in air fryer recipes?"
faqA1: "Golden syrup can substitute molasses in some recipes, but the flavour profile will be different. Molasses has a deeper, more robust taste, while golden syrup is lighter and sweeter. For 1.5 tbsp of molasses (31.5g), use the same quantity of golden syrup, but expect a milder result."
faqQ2: "Does the type of molasses affect the weight measurement?"
faqA2: "Yes, blackstrap molasses is denser than light molasses, but the difference is minimal for home cooking. For 1.5 tbsp, both types weigh roughly 31.5g. If precision is critical, like in baking, it's best to use a kitchen scale for consistent results every time."
faqQ3: "How should I store opened molasses for air fryer recipes?"
faqA3: "Store molasses in an airtight container in a cool, dark place. It keeps for up to a year, though quality is best within 6 months. If crystallisation occurs, gently warm the jar in hot water to restore smoothness before measuring your 1.5 tbsp (31.5g) portions."
faqQ4: "Why does my air fryer recipe with molasses taste bitter?"
faqA4: "Bitterness usually means the molasses was overheated or used in excess. Stick to the recommended 1.5 tbsp (31.5g) measurement and avoid high temperatures that can caramelise the sugars too quickly. Pair molasses with balancing flavours like vanilla or citrus to mellow its intensity."

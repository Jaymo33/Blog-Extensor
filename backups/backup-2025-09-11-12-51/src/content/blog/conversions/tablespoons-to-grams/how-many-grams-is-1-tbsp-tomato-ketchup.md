<p>1 tablespoon (tbsp) of tomato ketchup weighs approximately 15 grams. This measurement is essential for air fryer recipes where precision matters, ensuring your dishes turn out perfectly every time. Whether you're glazing chicken wings or adding a tangy twist to meatballs, knowing the exact weight helps maintain consistency.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Using the correct amount of ingredients ensures your air fryer meals cook evenly and taste just right. Too much ketchup can make dishes overly sweet or soggy, while too little might leave them lacking flavour.

This accuracy is especially important for recipes like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>air fryer chicken recipes</a>, where balance is key.</p>

faqQ1: "Is 3 tbsp of apple cider vinegar the same as 45g in all recipes?"
faqA1: "Yes, 3 tablespoons of apple cider vinegar equals approximately 45 grams in most cases. This conversion is standard for UK measurements. However, factors like temperature or vinegar density might cause slight variations, but 45g is the reliable measurement for air fryer recipes."
faqQ2: "Can I use a kitchen scale to measure 3 tbsp of apple cider vinegar?"
faqA2: "Absolutely! Using a kitchen scale is the most accurate way to measure 3 tbsp (45g) of apple cider vinegar. Simply place your mixing bowl on the scale, tare it to zero, then pour the vinegar until it reaches 45g. This method eliminates measuring errors common with spoons."
faqQ3: "Why do some recipes use grams instead of tablespoons for apple cider vinegar?"
faqA3: "Grams provide more precision than tablespoons, especially in air fryer cooking where consistency matters. Liquid measurements can vary slightly due to how the vinegar fills the spoon. Weight measurements (grams) ensure the same amount is used every time, leading to better results."
faqQ4: "Does the type of vinegar affect the 3 tbsp to grams conversion?"
faqA4: "Most vinegars, including apple cider vinegar, weigh about 15g per tablespoon, so 3 tbsp would be 45g. However, thicker vinegars like balsamic may weigh slightly more. For air fryer recipes, stick to the 45g measurement unless the recipe specifies otherwise."

<p>Many air fryer recipes call for small quantities of liquids like apple cider vinegar.

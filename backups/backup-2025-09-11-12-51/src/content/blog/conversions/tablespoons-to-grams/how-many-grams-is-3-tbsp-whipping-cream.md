faqQ1: "Can I use double cream instead of whipping cream in air fryer recipes?"
faqA1: "Yes, you can substitute double cream for whipping cream, but keep in mind it has a higher fat content (around 48% compared to whipping cream’s 35-40%). This may affect texture, making dishes richer or thicker. Adjust quantities slightly if needed."
faqQ2: "Why does my whipped cream turn grainy in the air fryer?"
faqA2: "Grainy whipped cream is often due to over-whipping or high heat. In the air fryer, avoid exposing whipped cream directly to heat for long periods. If using it as a topping, add it after cooking or use a lower temperature setting."
faqQ3: "How do I convert grams to cups for whipping cream?"
faqA3: "One cup of whipping cream is roughly 240 grams, so 45 grams (3 tbsp) equals about 3 tablespoons or just under 1/4 cup. For precise conversions, refer to our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a>."
faqQ4: "Can I use plant-based whipping cream in the same measurements?"
faqA4: "Plant-based whipping creams vary in density, so 3 tbsp may not always equal 45 grams. Check the packaging for specific weight conversions, or use a scale for accuracy. Some brands may require slight adjustments in air fryer recipes."

<p>3 tablespoons (tbsp) of whipping cream equals approximately 45 grams (g). This conversion is essential for precision in recipes, especially when using an air fryer where exact measurements can impact texture and consistency. Whether you're making a creamy sauce, a fluffy dessert, or a rich topping, knowing how to convert tablespoons to grams ensures perfect results every time.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on even heat distribution, and ingredient ratios play a crucial role in achieving the right texture. Too much or too little whipping cream can affect moisture levels, leading to soggy or dry dishes. For example, if you're making a <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert</a> like a mousse or custard, precise grams ensure the perfect consistency. Similarly, savoury dishes like creamy pasta bakes benefit from exact measurements to avoid separation or curdling.</p>  
<p>Using a kitchen scale for grams is more reliable than volume measurements like tablespoons, as density can vary. Whipping cream, for instance, can differ slightly based on fat content and temperature. For foolproof results, always weigh your ingredients when possible.

<h2>How to Measure 3 tbsp of Whipping Cream Without a Scale</h2>

<p>For best results, avoid packing the cream into the spoon, as this can lead to excess. Instead, gently pour or spoon it in, then level with a knife. If you’re working with a recipe from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>our collection</a>, always cross-check measurements to ensure accuracy. Remember, air fryer recipes often require precision, so when in doubt, opt for weighing.</p>

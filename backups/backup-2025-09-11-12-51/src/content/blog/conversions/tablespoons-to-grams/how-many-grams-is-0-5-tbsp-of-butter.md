faqQ1: "Can I use margarine instead of butter for 0.5 tbsp in air fryer recipes?"
faqA1: "Yes, you can substitute margarine for butter in a 1:1 ratio. However, margarine may have a higher water content, which could slightly affect texture. For best results, stick to butter or use a high-quality baking margarine."
faqQ2: "How do I measure 0.5 tbsp of butter if my spoon is too big?"
faqA2: "If your tablespoon is too large, use a teaspoon instead. Since 1 tbsp equals 3 tsp, 0.5 tbsp would be 1.5 tsp. This method gives you the same 7-gram measurement with greater precision."
faqQ3: "Does salted or unsalted butter affect the 0.5 tbsp to grams conversion?"
faqA3: "No, the weight remains the same (7 grams per 0.5 tbsp) regardless of salt content. However, salted butter may alter the flavour of your dish, so adjust seasonings accordingly in your air fryer recipes."
faqQ4: "Why do some recipes list butter in tablespoons while others use grams?"
faqA4: "Recipes may use different measurement systems based on their origin. UK recipes often favour grams for precision, while US recipes typically use volume measures like tablespoons. Always convert for accuracy, especially in air frying where quantities matter."

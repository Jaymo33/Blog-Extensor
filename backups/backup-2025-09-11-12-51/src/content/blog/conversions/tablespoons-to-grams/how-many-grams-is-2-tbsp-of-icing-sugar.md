faqQ1: "Can I use granulated sugar instead of icing sugar for 2 tbsp in grams?"
faqA1: "No, granulated sugar weighs differently—2 tbsp equals about 25 grams, nearly 50% more than icing sugar. Icing sugar’s fine texture means it packs less densely. For best results in air fryer recipes, stick to icing sugar when specified."
faqQ2: "How do I store leftover icing sugar after measuring 2 tbsp?"
faqA2: "Keep it in an airtight container in a cool, dry place to prevent clumping. If your sugar hardens, pulse it in a blender or sieve it before reusing. Proper storage ensures your next 2-tbsp (16g) measurement stays accurate."
faqQ3: "Why does my air fryer recipe call for icing sugar instead of caster sugar?"
faqA3: "Icing sugar dissolves instantly, making it ideal for glazes, frostings, and light bakes where smooth texture matters. Caster sugar works for creamed mixes but can leave graininess in delicate air fryer desserts like meringues."
faqQ4: "How many calories are in 2 tbsp (16g) of icing sugar?"
faqA4: "There are roughly 62 calories in 16g of icing sugar. While it’s a small amount, be mindful if you’re tracking intake. For lower-sugar options, try reducing the quantity or using alternatives like erythritol blends in air fryer recipes."

<p>2 tablespoons (tbsp) of icing sugar equals approximately 16 grams (g) in the UK. This conversion is essential for precise baking, especially when using an air fryer, where accurate measurements can make or break your recipe. Whether you’re whipping up a quick cake or dusting desserts, knowing how many grams are in 2 tbsp of icing sugar ensures consistency.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Baking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers cook food quickly and evenly, but they rely on precise ingredient ratios for the best results. Too much or too little icing sugar can affect texture and taste, particularly in delicate bakes like sponges or cookies. For example, if you’re making <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer cookies</a>, an extra gram or two of icing sugar could make them overly sweet or crumbly.</p>  

<p>Using a digital scale is the most reliable way to measure 2 tbsp of icing sugar in grams. Scooping directly from the bag can lead to inconsistencies due to settling or packing. For reference, 1 tbsp of icing sugar is roughly 8 grams, so doubling that gives you the 16-gram measurement for 2 tbsp. This precision is especially helpful for <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>air fryer cakes</a>, where balance is key.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure Icing Sugar Without a Scale</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a scale, lightly spoon the icing sugar into a tablespoon and level it off with a knife for the most accurate volume measurement. Avoid packing it down, as this can add up to 20% more sugar than intended. For context, 2 tbsp of icing sugar is about ⅛ of a standard UK cup (120g).</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for 2 Tbsp of Icing Sugar in Air Fryer Recipes</h2>  
<p>This small but mighty measurement pops up in many air fryer recipes. From dusting <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>air fryer desserts</a> like doughnuts to sweetening glazes for pastries, 16 grams of icing sugar delivers just the right touch of sweetness. It’s also perfect for light frostings or mixing into batters for a subtle sugar lift.</p>  

<p>For savoury-sweet balance, try adding 2 tbsp (16g) of icing sugar to a spice rub for <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>air fryer chicken wings</a>. The sugar caramelises during cooking, creating a deliciously sticky glaze.

<h3>UK vs. US Measurements: A Quick Note</h3>  
<p>While UK and US tablespoons are similar (15ml vs. 14.8ml), slight variations can affect grams. The 16g measurement applies to UK tablespoons. If using US recipes, the difference is negligible for icing sugar but worth noting for other ingredients.</p>

faqQ1: "Can I use evaporated milk instead of condensed milk in air fryer recipes?"
faqA1: "Evaporated milk is unsweetened, while condensed milk is sweetened and thicker. Substituting them will alter the taste and texture of your dish. If you must swap, adjust sugar levels accordingly, but sticking to condensed milk is best for recipes requiring its unique consistency."
faqQ2: "Why does my air fryer dessert turn out too runny?"
faqA2: "This often happens due to inaccurate measurements, especially with liquids like condensed milk. Ensure you’ve converted 4 tbsp condensed milk to grams correctly (around 80g). Overloading the air fryer basket or undercooking can also cause sogginess—follow recipe timings closely."
faqQ3: "How do I store leftover condensed milk after measuring?"
faqA3: "Transfer any unused condensed milk to an airtight container and refrigerate. It lasts up to two weeks. For longer storage, freeze it in portions. Always check for spoilage (sour smell or mould) before reusing in recipes."
faqQ4: "Is condensed milk the same in the UK and US?"
faqA4: "Yes, but always check labels for slight variations in sweetness or thickness. UK and US tablespoons are the same volume (15ml), so 4 tbsp condensed milk to grams conversions remain consistent. Use a scale for absolute precision in recipes."

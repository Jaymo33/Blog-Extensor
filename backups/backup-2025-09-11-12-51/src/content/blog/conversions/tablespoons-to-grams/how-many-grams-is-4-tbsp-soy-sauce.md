faqQ1: "Is 4 tbsp of soy sauce the same as 60g in all brands?"
faqA1: "Most standard soy sauces weigh around 60g for 4 tbsp, but thicker or artisanal brands may vary slightly. Always check the label for specific density or use a scale for precision, especially in air fryer recipes where balance is key."
faqQ2: "Can I use a measuring spoon instead of a scale for soy sauce?"
faqA2: "Yes, but for the most accurate results, a digital scale is best. If using spoons, ensure they’re level and standard UK tablespoons (15ml). Small variations won’t ruin a dish, but scales eliminate guesswork for perfect air fryer meals."
faqQ3: "How does soy sauce affect air fryer cooking times?"
faqA3: "Soy sauce in marinades or glazes can slightly reduce cooking times by adding moisture. However, 4 tbsp (60g) won’t drastically change timings. Always check food doneness with a thermometer, especially for proteins like chicken or salmon."
faqQ4: "What’s the best way to store leftover soy sauce?"
faqA4: "Keep opened soy sauce in a cool, dark place or the fridge to maintain freshness. It lasts for months, but always check for changes in smell or flavour. For air fryer recipes, fresh soy sauce ensures the best taste."

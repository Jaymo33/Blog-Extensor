faqQ1: "Can I use regular yogurt instead of Greek yogurt in air fryer recipes?"
faqA1: "Yes, but you may need to adjust the quantity since regular yogurt is thinner. For 5 tbsp of Greek yogurt (75g), use about 6-7 tbsp of regular yogurt to match the thickness. Keep an eye on cooking times, as the extra moisture can affect results."
faqQ2: "How do I convert grams back to tablespoons for Greek yogurt?"
faqA2: "Divide the grams by 15 to get the approximate number of tablespoons. For example, 75g of Greek yogurt is roughly 5 tbsp. Always level off the tablespoons for accuracy, or use a scale for precision."
faqQ3: "Does the brand of Greek yogurt affect the weight per tablespoon?"
faqA3: "Slightlyâ€”thicker brands may weigh more per tablespoon. For most major brands, 5 tbsp of Greek yogurt will be around 75g, but checking with a scale is best for critical recipes."
faqQ4: "Can I freeze Greek yogurt for later use in air fryer recipes?"
faqA4: "Freezing Greek yogurt can change its texture, making it grainy when thawed. It's best used fresh, but if frozen, stir well after thawing and use it in cooked dishes like marinades or baked goods."

<h2>Why Convert Tablespoons to Grams?</h2>  
<p>Converting tablespoons to grams is essential for accuracy, especially in air fryer cooking. Volume measurements like tablespoons can vary based on how the ingredient is packed or scooped. Weight measurements in grams eliminate this inconsistency, ensuring your recipes turn out perfectly every time. Greek yogurt, in particular, can vary in thickness, so weighing it removes any guesswork. If you're serious about air fryer cooking, a kitchen scale is a must-have tool.</p>  
<p>For example, a recipe calling for 5 tbsp of Greek yogurt might not specify whether it's heaped or level. By converting to grams, you avoid over- or under-measuring. This is especially important for air fryer recipes, where precise ratios affect texture and cooking time.

<h2>How to Measure Greek Yogurt Accurately</h2>  
<p>To measure 5 tbsp of Greek yogurt in grams, use a kitchen scale for the most accurate results. Simply place your bowl on the scale, tare it to zero, and spoon in the yogurt until it reaches 75 grams. If you don't have a scale, level off each tablespoon with a knife to ensure consistency. Greek yogurt is denser than regular yogurt, so it's important to measure it carefully.</p>  
<p>For air fryer recipes, precise measurements can affect cooking times and textures. Too much yogurt in a marinade, for instance, might make your dish too wet. Too little could leave it dry.

<h3>Common Uses for Greek Yogurt in Air Fryer Cooking</h3>  
<p>Greek yogurt is a staple in many air fryer recipes, from marinades to dips and even baked goods. Its thick texture and tangy flavour make it ideal for coating chicken or fish before air frying. It also works well in doughs for flatbreads or as a base for creamy sauces. Knowing how many grams 5 tbsp of Greek yogurt is ensures your recipes turn out just right.</p>  

<h2>Greek Yogurt vs. Regular Yogurt in Grams</h2>  
<p>Greek yogurt is denser than regular yogurt, so 5 tbsp will weigh more in grams. Regular yogurt is about 15 grams per tablespoon, while Greek yogurt is closer to 15-20 grams depending on thickness. This difference matters in recipes where moisture content is key. Always check whether your recipe specifies Greek or regular yogurt to avoid mishaps.</p>  
<p>For air fryer cooking, Greek yogurt's thickness makes it better for coatings and marinades. Regular yogurt might be too runny, leading to uneven cooking.

faqQ1: "Can I use single cream instead of double cream for 0.5 tbsp measurements?"
faqA1: "Yes, but single cream has a lower fat content, so the texture may differ. For 0.5 tbsp, the gram weight is similar (around 7 grams), but the richness won’t be the same. Adjust other ingredients if needed for consistency."
faqQ2: "Why does 0.5 tbsp of double cream weigh 7.5 grams?"
faqA2: "Double cream is denser than liquids like water or milk due to its high fat content. A standard UK tablespoon holds 15 grams of double cream, so half (0.5 tbsp) is 7.5 grams. Always measure by weight for accuracy."
faqQ3: "How do I convert 0.5 tbsp of double cream to millilitres?"
faqA3: "0.5 tbsp of double cream is roughly 7.5 ml, but weight (grams) is more reliable for cooking. Volume can vary with temperature, while grams remain consistent. Use a scale for best results in air fryer recipes."
faqQ4: "Can I substitute Greek yoghurt for 0.5 tbsp of double cream?"
faqA4: "Greek yoghurt can work as a lighter substitute, but use 0.5 tbsp (7.5 grams) plus a splash of milk to mimic the creaminess. Note that tanginess may affect the flavour, especially in desserts."

faqQ1: "Can I use butter instead of margarine for 5 tbsp (70g) in air fryer recipes?"
faqA1: "Yes, butter can be substituted for margarine in a 1:1 ratio. However, butter has a slightly higher fat content, which may affect browning and texture. For best results, stick to unsalted butter unless the recipe specifies otherwise."
faqQ2: "How do I convert 5 tbsp of margarine to grams if my recipe uses cups?"
faqA2: "5 tbsp of margarine equals roughly 1/3 cup or 70g. If your recipe uses cups, measure it as a scant 1/3 cup for accuracy. For more conversions, refer to our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>."
faqQ3: "Why is measuring margarine in grams better than tablespoons for air fryer cooking?"
faqA3: "Grams provide precise measurements, ensuring consistent results in air fryer recipes. Tablespoons can vary slightly depending on how the margarine is packed, while grams eliminate guesswork. This is especially important for baking and pastry dishes."
faqQ4: "Does melted margarine weigh the same as solid margarine for 5 tbsp (70g)?"
faqA4: "Yes, melted and solid margarine weigh the same—5 tbsp is still 70g. However, always measure margarine in its solid state for accuracy, as melting can make it harder to gauge volume correctly."

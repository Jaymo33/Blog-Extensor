faqQ1: "Can I use gelatin sheets instead of 0.25 tbsp powder?"
faqA1: "Yes, you can substitute gelatin sheets for powder. One sheet typically equals about 2 grams, so you’d need roughly 1.25 sheets to match 0.25 tbsp (2.5 grams) of powder. Always check the packet instructions for exact conversions, as sheet sizes vary by brand."
faqQ2: "Why does my air fryer dessert with gelatin not set properly?"
faqA2: "If your dessert isn’t setting, you may have used too little gelatin or not bloomed it correctly. Ensure you’re accurately measuring 0.25 tbsp (2.5 grams) and dissolving it fully in warm liquid before adding it to your mixture. Also, let it chill sufficiently after cooking."
faqQ3: "How do I store leftover gelatin powder?"
faqA3: "Keep unused gelatin powder in an airtight container in a cool, dry place. Avoid humidity, as it can cause clumping. Properly stored, it lasts up to 2 years. For best results in air fryer recipes, weigh out 0.25 tbsp (2.5 grams) as needed rather than pre-measuring large batches."
faqQ4: "Can I double a recipe that uses 0.25 tbsp gelatin powder?"
faqA4: "Absolutely! Simply scale up proportionally—0.5 tbsp would be 5 grams. Just ensure you dissolve all the gelatin properly and adjust setting times accordingly. Larger quantities may need slightly longer to set in the fridge after air frying."

<h2>How to measure 0.25 tbsp of gelatin powder</h2>

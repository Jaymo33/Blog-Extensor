faqQ1: "Can I use fresh ginger instead of ginger paste in my air fryer recipes?"
faqA1: "Yes, you can substitute fresh ginger for ginger paste. Grate or finely mince 1 tablespoon of fresh ginger for every tablespoon of paste. Fresh ginger has a brighter, sharper flavour, so adjust to taste."
faqQ2: "Does the brand of ginger paste affect the weight in grams?"
faqA2: "Different brands may vary slightly in density, but the difference is minimal. For most commercial ginger pastes, 5 tbsp will still weigh around 75 grams. Always check the label for specific conversions if available."
faqQ3: "How long does ginger paste last in the fridge?"
faqA3: "Ginger paste typically lasts 3–4 weeks in the fridge if stored in an airtight container. For longer storage, freeze it in portions and thaw as needed."
faqQ4: "Can I make ginger paste at home for air fryer recipes?"
faqA4: "Absolutely! Blend peeled fresh ginger with a bit of water or oil until smooth. Homemade paste may be less dense, so adjust measurements slightly. Store it in the fridge or freezer for future use."

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on even heat distribution, and incorrect ingredient quantities can throw off cooking times and results. Too much ginger paste might overpower your dish, while too little could leave it bland. Measuring by weight (grams) is more reliable than volume (tablespoons) because ginger paste can vary in density. For perfectly balanced flavours, always weigh your ingredients.

<h3>How to measure ginger paste correctly</h3>  
<p>For the most accurate results, use a digital kitchen scale. Scoop the ginger paste into a small bowl on the scale and tare (zero) it before adding the paste. If you don’t have a scale, lightly pack the spoon and level it off with a knife. Avoid heaping tablespoons, as this can add extra grams unintentionally. Need more tips?

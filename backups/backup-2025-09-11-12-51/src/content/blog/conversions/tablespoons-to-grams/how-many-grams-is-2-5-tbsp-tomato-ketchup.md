faqQ1: "Why is it better to measure tomato ketchup in grams rather than tablespoons?"
faqA1: "Grams provide more accuracy because tablespoon measurements can vary based on how the ketchup is packed. Air fryer cooking benefits from precise quantities to ensure even cooking and consistent flavours. Digital scales eliminate this variability for perfect results every time."
faqQ2: "Can I use this conversion for other brands of tomato ketchup?"
faqA2: "Yes, most standard tomato ketchups have similar densities, so the 2.5 tbsp to 37.5g conversion applies across major brands. However, extra thick or reduced-sugar varieties might differ slightly. When in doubt, check your specific brand's nutritional information for precise gram measurements."
faqQ3: "How does this measurement help with air fryer cooking?"
faqA3: "Precise ketchup measurements ensure coatings and glazes have the right consistency for air frying. Too much can make food soggy, while too little might not provide enough flavour. The 37.5g measurement helps create that perfect balance for crispy, flavourful results."
faqQ4: "What if my recipe calls for cups of tomato ketchup instead of tablespoons?"
faqA4: "For cup measurements, remember that 16 tablespoons equal 1 cup. So 2.5 tbsp is about 0.156 cups. Our air fryer conversion chart provides comprehensive volume-to-weight conversions for all common ingredients, making recipe adaptation simple and accurate."

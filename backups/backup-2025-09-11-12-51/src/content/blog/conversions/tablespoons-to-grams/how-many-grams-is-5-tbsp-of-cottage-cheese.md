faqQ1: "Can I use low-fat cottage cheese for the same gram measurement?"
faqA1: "Yes, low-fat and full-fat cottage cheese have similar densities, so 5 tbsp will still weigh around 70 grams. The main difference is moisture content, which may slightly affect texture in recipes. Adjust cooking times if needed."
faqQ2: "How do I store leftover cottage cheese after measuring?"
faqA2: "Seal it in an airtight container and refrigerate for up to 5 days. Stir well before reusing, as separation is normal. For longer storage, freeze it in portions, though thawed cottage cheese works best in cooked dishes."
faqQ3: "Why does my air fryer recipe turn out wet with cottage cheese?"
faqA3: "Excess moisture from cottage cheese can cause sogginess. Try draining it in a sieve for 10 minutes or mixing in breadcrumbs to absorb liquid. Preheating the air fryer also helps crispness."
faqQ4: "Can I substitute ricotta for cottage cheese in air fryer recipes?"
faqA4: "Yes, ricotta has a similar texture but is denser. Use 60 grams (about 4 tbsp) of ricotta per 5 tbsp of cottage cheese. Adjust seasoning, as ricotta is milder in flavour."

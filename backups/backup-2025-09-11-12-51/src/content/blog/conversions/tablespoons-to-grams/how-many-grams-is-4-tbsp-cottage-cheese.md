faqQ1: "Can I use 4 tbsp of cottage cheese instead of 60g in recipes?"
faqA1: "Yes, 4 tablespoons of cottage cheese equals roughly 60 grams, so they can be used interchangeably in most recipes. However, for baking or dishes where precision is key, weighing is more accurate due to variations in cottage cheese density."
faqQ2: "Does the fat content affect the weight of 4 tbsp of cottage cheese?"
faqA2: "The fat content (full-fat vs. low-fat) doesn’t significantly change the weight of 4 tbsp, but it can alter texture and moisture. Full-fat cottage cheese is creamier, while low-fat may be slightly drier, so adjust other liquids in your recipe if needed."
faqQ3: "How do I convert 4 tbsp of cottage cheese to cups?"
faqA3: "Four tablespoons of cottage cheese equal 1/4 cup (60ml). If your recipe uses cups, this conversion works for both UK and US measurements. For air fryer recipes, sticking to grams ensures better accuracy."
faqQ4: "Can I freeze cottage cheese after measuring 4 tbsp portions?"
faqA4: "Yes, cottage cheese freezes well in measured portions. Place 4 tbsp (60g) in airtight containers or bags, leaving room for expansion. Thaw in the fridge overnight and stir before using, as the texture may become slightly grainy."

<h2>How to measure 4 tbsp of cottage cheese</h2>  
<p>To measure 4 tablespoons of cottage cheese, use a standard UK tablespoon (15ml per tbsp). Scoop the cheese lightly without packing it down to avoid over-measuring. If you’re using a kitchen scale, tare it with your bowl before adding the cottage cheese until it reaches 60 grams. This method works for both full-fat and low-fat varieties.</p>  
<p>For recipes like air fryer stuffed mushrooms or cheesy potato cakes, precise measurements ensure even cooking. Cottage cheese melts differently depending on moisture content, so weighing it helps avoid soggy results. Need more air fryer hacks?

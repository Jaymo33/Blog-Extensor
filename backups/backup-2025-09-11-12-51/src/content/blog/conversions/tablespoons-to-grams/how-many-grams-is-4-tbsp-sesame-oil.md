faqQ1: "Can I use 4 tbsp of sesame oil for deep frying in an air fryer?"
faqA1: "No, air fryers require minimal oil compared to deep frying. For most recipes, 1-2 tsp (5-10g) is sufficient. Using 4 tbsp (54g) may cause smoking or uneven cooking. Stick to light coating or misting for best results."
faqQ2: "Does the type of sesame oil affect the weight per tablespoon?"
faqA2: "Yes, toasted sesame oil is slightly denser than light sesame oil, but the difference is negligible for home cooking. Both types weigh ~13.5g per tbsp, so 4 tbsp sesame oil to grams remains ~54g regardless of variety."
faqQ3: "How do I substitute sesame oil if I don’t have enough?"
faqA3: "For every 1 tbsp sesame oil (13.5g), use 1 tbsp neutral oil (like sunflower) + ½ tsp toasted sesame seeds. This mimics the flavour, though the aroma will be milder. Adjust seasoning as needed."
faqQ4: "Why does my air fryer smoke when using sesame oil?"
faqA4: "Sesame oil has a lower smoke point than some oils. To prevent smoking, avoid exceeding 175°C when using it. For high-heat cooking, blend it with a high-smoke-point oil like avocado or peanut oil."

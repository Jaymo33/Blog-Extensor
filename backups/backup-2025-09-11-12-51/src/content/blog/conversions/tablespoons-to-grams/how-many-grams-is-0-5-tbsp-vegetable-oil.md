faqQ1: "Can I use olive oil instead of vegetable oil for 0.5 tbsp measurements?"
faqA1: "Yes, you can substitute olive oil, but note that its density is slightly different. 0.5 tbsp of olive oil weighs about 6.7 grams, nearly the same as vegetable oil. The small difference won’t affect most recipes, but for precision, adjust if needed."
faqQ2: "Why is measuring oil in grams better than tablespoons for air frying?"
faqA2: "Grams provide exact weight, eliminating inconsistencies from how you fill a spoon. Air fryers rely on even oil distribution for crispiness, so grams ensure accuracy. Tablespoons can vary based on oil type and temperature, but grams stay reliable."
faqQ3: "How do I measure 0.5 tbsp vegetable oil if I don’t have a ½ tablespoon spoon?"
faqA3: "Use a full tablespoon and estimate halfway, or measure 1.5 teaspoons (since 1 tbsp = 3 tsp). For the most accuracy, weigh 6.8 grams on a kitchen scale. A little practice makes it easy to eyeball."
faqQ4: "Does the type of vegetable oil affect the gram weight for 0.5 tbsp?"
faqA4: "Most vegetable oils (like sunflower or canola) have similar densities, so 0.5 tbsp ≈ 6.8 grams. Exceptions include thicker oils (e.g., coconut), which weigh slightly more. Always check specific oil types for precise conversions."

faqQ1: "Does 1.5 tbsp of granulated sugar weigh the same as brown sugar?"
faqA1: "No, brown sugar is denser than granulated sugar due to its molasses content. While 1.5 tbsp of granulated sugar weighs about 18.75 grams, the same volume of brown sugar weighs approximately 21 grams. Always check specific conversions when substituting sugars in recipes."
faqQ2: "Can I use cup measurements instead of tablespoons for sugar in air fryer recipes?"
faqA2: "While possible, we recommend weighing ingredients for air fryer recipes as cup measurements can vary. If using cups, 1.5 tbsp equals 0.09 UK cups (about 1/10 cup). For best results, refer to our air fryer conversion chart at airfryerrecipe.co.uk for precise measurements."
faqQ3: "Why does my air fryer recipe need exact sugar measurements?"
faqA3: "Air fryers cook faster and more intensely than conventional ovens, so precise sugar measurements prevent burning or uneven cooking. Too much sugar can cause excessive browning, while too little may affect texture and rise. Accurate measurements ensure consistent results every time."
faqQ4: "How do I convert grams back to tablespoons if my scales stop working?"
faqA4: "In an emergency, remember that 1 UK tablespoon of granulated sugar equals about 12.5 grams. So 18.75 grams would be 1 full tablespoon plus half another. For temporary measuring, use a standard UK tablespoon and level it carefully for accuracy. Consider keeping spare batteries for your scales handy."

<p>1.5 tablespoons of granulated sugar equals approximately 18.75 grams in UK measurements.

Whether you're whipping up cakes, cookies, or glazes, knowing this conversion helps achieve consistent results every time.</p>

<h2>Why accurate sugar measurements matter in air frying</h2>
<p>When using your air fryer, precise ingredient measurements ensure even cooking and perfect texture. Too much sugar can cause excessive browning or burning, while too little might leave your baked goods lacking sweetness. The compact cooking space of an air fryer means measurements need to be more accurate than traditional oven baking. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we recommend weighing ingredients for best results.</p>
<p>Granulated sugar is particularly important to measure correctly as it affects both taste and chemical reactions in baking. In recipes like air fryer cookies or cakes, sugar helps with spreading, browning and moisture retention. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> makes these measurements simple for all your favourite treats.</p>

<h2>How to measure 1.5 tbsp granulated sugar accurately</h2>
<p>For the most precise measurement, use digital kitchen scales set to grams. If you don't have scales, the spoon-and-level method works well. Fill your tablespoon measure slightly heaped, then level off the excess with a straight edge. Do this once fully, then half fill the tablespoon again for your 1.5 tbsp measurement.</p>

<h3>Common UK baking measurements compared</h3>

Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>cake recipes</a> specify UK measurements for accuracy.</p>

<h2>Converting other sugar quantities</h2>

This knowledge is especially useful when adapting traditional recipes for air fryer cooking, where quantities sometimes need adjusting.</p>

faqQ1: "Why is 2.5 tbsp of lime juice 37.5 grams?"
faqA1: "The conversion is based on the average density of lime juice, where 1 tablespoon (tbsp) equals approximately 15 grams (g). This standard measurement ensures consistency in recipes, especially for air fryer cooking where precision affects texture and flavour."
faqQ2: "Can I use bottled lime juice instead of fresh for this conversion?"
faqA2: "Yes, bottled lime juice works for the 2.5 tbsp to grams conversion, but check the label for additives that might alter density. Fresh lime juice may vary slightly in weight due to pulp content, but 37.5g remains a reliable guideline."
faqQ3: "How do I adjust the lime juice quantity for a larger recipe?"
faqA3: "Simply scale the measurement proportionally. For example, 5 tbsp of lime juice would be 75g, and 7.5 tbsp would be 112.5g. Use a digital scale for accuracy, especially in baking or marinades."
faqQ4: "Does the temperature of lime juice affect its weight?"
faqA4: "Temperature has minimal impact on the weight of lime juice. Whether chilled or room temperature, 2.5 tbsp will still be roughly 37.5g. However, pulp or ice in freshly squeezed juice may cause slight variations."

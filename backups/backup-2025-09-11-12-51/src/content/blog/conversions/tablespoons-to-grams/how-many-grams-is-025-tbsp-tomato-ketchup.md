faqQ1: "Can I use 0.25 tbsp of tomato ketchup in air fryer marinades?"
faqA1: "Absolutely! 0.25 tbsp of tomato ketchup (about 3.75 grams) works well in marinades for chicken, tofu, or even vegetables. Its slight sweetness and acidity help tenderise and flavour ingredients. Combine it with spices, oil, and a splash of vinegar for a balanced marinade."
faqQ2: "Why does 0.25 tbsp of tomato ketchup weigh 3.75 grams?"
faqA2: "The weight is based on the density of tomato ketchup, which averages around 15 grams per tablespoon (UK). Since 0.25 tbsp is a quarter of that, it comes to 3.75 grams. Factors like brand or thickness may cause slight variations, but this is a reliable standard for recipes."
faqQ3: "How do I measure 0.25 tbsp of tomato ketchup without a scale?"
faqA3: "If you don't have a scale, use a standard tablespoon and fill it to roughly one-quarter of its capacity. Alternatively, a teaspoon holds 5ml, so 0.25 tbsp is just under 4ml—about three-quarters of a teaspoon. For precision, though, a scale is best."
faqQ4: "Is 0.25 tbsp of tomato ketchup enough for a single serving?"
faqA4: "Yes, 0.25 tbsp (3.75 grams) is plenty for a single serving, especially in air fryer recipes where flavours are concentrated. It's ideal for glazing, dipping, or adding a hint of sweetness without overwhelming the dish. Adjust to taste if you prefer a stronger flavour."

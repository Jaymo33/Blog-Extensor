faqQ1: "Can I use frozen chopped onion instead of fresh for the 3 tbsp measurement?"
faqA1: "Yes, but thaw and drain frozen onion first to remove excess water, which affects weight. Pat dry before measuring to match the 30g equivalent of fresh."
faqQ2: "How does onion size affect the gram measurement for 3 tbsp?"
faqA2: "Finely chopped onion packs more densely, so 3 tbsp may weigh slightly more (up to 35g). Coarsely chopped yields closer to 30g. Always level off tablespoons for consistency."
faqQ3: "Do red and white onions weigh the same per 3 tbsp?"
faqA3: "Both types weigh roughly 30g per 3 tbsp when chopped similarly. Red onions are slightly denser, but the difference is negligible for most recipes."
faqQ4: "How should I store leftover chopped onion after measuring 3 tbsp?"
faqA4: "Keep unused onion in an airtight container in the fridge for 3-4 days. For longer storage, freeze in 30g portions—perfect for future air fryer meals."

<h2>Why accurate onion measurements matter</h2>  
<p>Chopped onion is a staple in many dishes, from air-fried fajitas to hearty stews. Using the right amount ensures balanced flavour without overpowering other ingredients.

Whether you're cooking for one or meal prepping, precision saves time and reduces waste.</p>  

<h3>How to measure chopped onion correctly</h3>  
<p>For consistent results, lightly pack the onion into the tablespoon without crushing it. Level off the top with a knife for an exact 3 tbsp portion. If using a kitchen scale, tare the bowl first, then add the onion until it hits 30 grams. This method works for both fresh and pre-chopped onions.

<h2>Pro tips for air frying with onions</h2>

faqQ1: "Can I use butter instead of 1.5 tbsp olive oil in my air fryer?"
faqA1: "Yes, but butter has a different weight and smoke point. 1.5 tbsp of butter equals about 21g, slightly more than olive oil. Since butter burns more easily, reduce the air fryer temperature by 10°C to prevent smoking."
faqQ2: "How do I measure 1.5 tbsp of olive oil if I only have a teaspoon?"
faqA2: "1.5 tbsp equals 4.5 teaspoons. Use a standard 5ml teaspoon and fill it just under full for each measure. For accuracy, level off the excess with a knife."
faqQ3: "Is 1.5 tbsp of olive oil enough for a whole chicken in the air fryer?"
faqA3: "For a whole chicken, you’ll likely need more—around 2-3 tbsp (27-40g) to coat evenly. Focus on the skin for crispiness, and pat the chicken dry first for better oil adhesion."
faqQ4: "Does 1.5 tbsp of olive oil add many calories to my air fryer meal?"
faqA4: "Yes, 1.5 tbsp (20g) of olive oil contains about 180 calories. If you’re calorie-conscious, try using an oil spray to lightly coat food instead of pouring."

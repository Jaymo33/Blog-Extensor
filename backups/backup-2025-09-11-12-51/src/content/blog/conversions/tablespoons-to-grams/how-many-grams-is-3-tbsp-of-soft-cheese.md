faqQ1: "Is 3 tbsp of soft cheese the same as 45 grams in the UK?"
faqA1: "Yes, in the UK, 3 tablespoons of soft cheese is generally equivalent to 45 grams. This measurement is standard for most soft cheeses like cream cheese or ricotta. However, slight variations can occur depending on the cheese's density, so using a scale is always best for accuracy."
faqQ2: "Can I use 3 tbsp of soft cheese instead of weighing it for air fryer recipes?"
faqA2: "While 3 tbsp of soft cheese is roughly 45 grams, weighing it ensures precision, especially in air fryer cooking where exact measurements matter. If you don’t have a scale, spoon the cheese into the tablespoon measure and level it off for the closest approximation."

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>
<p>Using the correct amount of ingredients is crucial when cooking with an air fryer. Unlike traditional ovens, air fryers circulate hot air rapidly, which means even small measurement errors can affect texture and taste. Soft cheese, in particular, can vary in density, so weighing it ensures consistency. If you’re preparing a dish like stuffed mushrooms or a cheesy pasta bake, 45 grams of soft cheese per 3 tablespoons will give you the perfect balance.

<p>Many air fryer recipes call for soft cheese, from dips to stuffed meats. Measuring by weight rather than volume eliminates guesswork, especially since spoon sizes can differ slightly. A digital kitchen scale is a worthwhile investment for anyone serious about air fryer cooking. For example, if a recipe requires 3 tbsp of soft cheese, you’ll now know it’s roughly 45 grams, making your cooking process smoother and more reliable.</p>

<h2>How to measure soft cheese accurately</h2>
<p>To measure 3 tablespoons of soft cheese in grams, use a digital scale for the most precise results. Scoop the cheese into a tablespoon measure, level it off, and then weigh it. If you don’t have a scale, remember that 1 tablespoon of soft cheese is about 15 grams, so 3 tablespoons equal 45 grams. This method works for popular soft cheeses like cream cheese, ricotta, or mascarpone.</p>

faqQ1: "Can I use marmalade straight from the jar in my air fryer?"
faqA1: "Yes, you can use marmalade directly, but for best results, warm it slightly to make it easier to brush onto food. Mixing it with a teaspoon of water or oil helps it spread evenly and prevents burning in the air fryer."
faqQ2: "Does the type of marmalade affect the weight per tablespoon?"
faqA2: "Thicker, chunkier marmalade may weigh slightly more per tablespoon due to added fruit peel. However, the difference is minimal—around 5 grams at most. For precise measurements, always use a kitchen scale."
faqQ3: "How do I convert grams of marmalade back to tablespoons?"
faqA3: "Divide the gram amount by 20 to get the approximate tablespoon equivalent. For example, 60g of marmalade is roughly 3 tbsp. This method works well for most UK recipes."
faqQ4: "Can I substitute marmalade with jam in air fryer recipes?"
faqA4: "Yes, but expect a sweeter, less tangy flavour. Jam is denser, so use about 10% less by weight. For 4 tbsp (80g) of marmalade, substitute with 72g of jam for similar consistency."

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>
<p>Air fryers rely on precise cooking times and temperatures, and ingredient measurements play a crucial role. Using the correct amount of marmalade ensures your dish isn’t too sweet or too dry.

<p>Many air fryer recipes, especially those involving marinades or glazes, require exact gram measurements. Marmalade’s sticky consistency means volume measurements like tablespoons can vary slightly. That’s why weighing it in grams is more reliable. If you’re exploring new dishes, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a> has plenty of ideas to try.</p>

<h2>How to measure 4 tbsp of marmalade accurately</h2>
<p>To measure 4 tbsp of marmalade, use a standard UK tablespoon, which holds about 15ml. Scoop the marmalade without packing it down to avoid excess. For greater precision, a kitchen scale is your best friend—simply tare the scale and measure until it reads 80 grams. This method eliminates guesswork and guarantees consistency.</p>

<h3>Using marmalade in air fryer recipes</h3>

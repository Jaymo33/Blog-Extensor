faqQ1: "Can I use bottled lime juice instead of fresh for the same weight?"
faqA1: "Yes, bottled lime juice can be substituted, but it may have a slightly different weight due to additives. Fresh lime juice is typically around 15 grams per tbsp, while bottled might vary. Always check the label or weigh it for accuracy."
faqQ2: "Does the type of lime affect the weight per tablespoon?"
faqA2: "Different lime varieties (like Key limes or Persian limes) have similar juice density, so the weight per tbsp stays close to 15 grams. However, juiciness can vary slightly, so weighing ensures consistency."
faqQ3: "How do I convert grams of lime juice to millilitres?"
faqA3: "Since lime juice has a similar density to water, 15 grams is roughly 15 ml. This makes conversions straightforward for liquid measurements in recipes."
faqQ4: "Why does my lime juice measurement seem off when I weigh it?"
faqA4: "If your measurement doesn’t match 15 grams, check your scale’s calibration or how you’re filling the tablespoon. Pulp or seeds can also slightly alter the weight. For best results, strain the juice before measuring."

faqQ1: "Can I use butter instead of margarine in air fryer recipes?"
faqA1: "Yes, butter can be substituted for margarine in most air fryer recipes. However, butter has a slightly higher fat content, so you may need to adjust cooking times slightly. Use the same weight (28g for 2 tbsp) for best results."
faqQ2: "Does margarine type affect the weight conversion?"
faqA2: "Most standard UK margarines have a similar density, so 2 tbsp will still weigh around 28 grams. Low-fat or whipped margarines may vary slightly, so check the packaging for precise measurements."
faqQ3: "How do I measure margarine if I don’t have tablespoons?"
faqA3: "If you don’t have measuring spoons, use a standard teaspoon (5ml) and measure 6 level teaspoons to get 2 tablespoons (28g). Alternatively, use a kitchen scale for the most accurate results."
faqQ4: "Why is my air fryer recipe greasy with margarine?"
faqA4: "Using too much margarine can make food greasy. Stick to 28 grams (2 tbsp) unless the recipe states otherwise. Also, ensure your air fryer is preheated to help the margarine crisp rather than soak into the food."

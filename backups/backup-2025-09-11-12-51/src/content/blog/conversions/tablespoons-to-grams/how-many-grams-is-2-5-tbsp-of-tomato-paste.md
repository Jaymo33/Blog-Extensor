faqQ1: "Can I use tomato puree instead of paste in my air fryer recipes?"
faqA1: "Tomato puree has a thinner consistency and milder flavour than concentrated tomato paste. For air fryer cooking, you'll need to use about double the amount of puree to match 2.5 tbsp (37.5g) of paste. Reduce other liquids in your recipe slightly to compensate for the extra moisture."
faqQ2: "Why does my air fryer recipe specify grams instead of tablespoons for tomato paste?"
faqA2: "Grams provide more accuracy since tomato paste's density can vary between brands. Air fryers circulate hot air intensely, so precise measurements prevent dishes from becoming too dry or soggy. Weight measurements also make scaling recipes up or down simpler without recalculating volumes."
faqQ3: "How long does 2.5 tbsp of tomato paste last in the fridge after opening?"
faqA3: "Once opened, tomato paste stays fresh for 5-7 days in the fridge if transferred to an airtight container. For longer storage, freeze measured portions like 2.5 tbsp (37.5g) in ice cube trays or small bags. Properly stored frozen paste keeps for 3-4 months without quality loss."
faqQ4: "Can I substitute fresh tomatoes for 2.5 tbsp of tomato paste in air fryer recipes?"
faqA4: "You'd need about 3 medium fresh tomatoes, blended and reduced by half, to replace 2.5 tbsp (37.5g) of paste. However, this adds significant moisture to air fryer dishes, potentially affecting texture. For best results, stick to paste unless the recipe specifically allows fresh tomato substitutions."

<p>2.5 tablespoons (tbsp) of tomato paste equals approximately 37.5 grams. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements can make all the difference. Whether you're whipping up a rich pasta sauce or a flavourful marinade, knowing the exact weight ensures consistent results every time.</p>

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>
<p>Air fryers rely on even heat distribution, so ingredient quantities must be spot-on. Too much tomato paste can make dishes overly thick or intense, while too little might leave them lacking depth. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we emphasise precision for perfect textures and flavours. Many of our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>popular recipes</a> call for tomato paste, so getting the grams right is key.</p>
<p>For those who love experimenting, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> simplifies switching between volume and weight measurements. This takes the guesswork out of adapting traditional recipes for your air fryer. Whether you're cooking for one or meal prepping, accurate grams ensure reliability.</p>

<h2>How to measure 2.5 tbsp of tomato paste without scales</h2>
<p>If you don't have digital scales, you can still measure 2.5 tbsp of tomato paste accurately. Standard UK tablespoons hold 15ml, so 2.5 tbsp would be 37.5ml. Pack the paste firmly into the spoon to avoid air gaps, levelling it off with a knife. For sticky ingredients like tomato paste, lightly oiling the spoon helps it slide out cleanly.</p>
<p>Another handy trick is using pre-portioned tubes of tomato paste, which often have markings in grams. Many <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable-based air fryer recipes</a> benefit from this convenience. Storing leftover paste in ice cube trays (about 1 tbsp per cube) also makes future measurements effortless.</p>

<h3>Common uses for 2.5 tbsp tomato paste in air fryer cooking</h3>
<p>This quantity works perfectly for coating 500g of chicken wings or creating a rich base for stuffed peppers. It's also ideal for <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/beef>beef recipes</a> like meatballs or burgers, adding umami depth without making the mixture too wet. When making air fryer pizza or flatbreads, 37.5g of tomato paste spreads nicely over two medium bases.</p>

<h2>Converting other tomato paste quantities to grams</h2>
<p>Once you know 2.5 tbsp equals 37.5g, scaling up or down becomes simple. For example, 1 tbsp is 15g, while 5 tbsp would be 75g. This knowledge helps when adjusting <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> for different serving sizes. Always remember that UK tablespoons differ slightly from US measurements, so stick to one system for consistency.</p>
<p>For larger batches, like meal prepping <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/meal-prep>freezer-friendly dishes</a>, weighing in grams prevents errors. Tomato paste's concentrated flavour means small measurement mistakes can significantly impact taste. Keeping a conversion note on your fridge or in your recipe app saves time during busy cooking sessions.</p>

<h3>Storing leftover tomato paste after measuring</h3>
<p>After measuring out your 2.5 tbsp (37.5g), transfer remaining paste to an airtight container with a thin layer of olive oil on top. This prevents drying and keeps it fresh for 2-3 weeks in the fridge. For longer storage, freeze measured portions in bags labelled with weights - a perfect hack for <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>easy air fryer cleanup</a> later.</p>

faqQ1: "Can I use double cream instead of whipping cream in 0.5 tbsp measurements?"
faqA1: "Yes, but note that double cream is thicker and higher in fat. For 0.5 tbsp (7.5 grams), the substitution works, but the texture may differ slightly in air fryer recipes. Adjust cooking times if needed."
faqQ2: "How do I measure 0.5 tbsp of whipping cream if I only have a teaspoon?"
faqA2: "Use 1.5 teaspoons to equal 0.5 tbsp. Since 1 tbsp is 3 teaspoons, halving it gives you the right amount. For accuracy, level off the teaspoon for 7.5 grams."
faqQ3: "Does 0.5 tbsp of whipped cream weigh the same as liquid whipping cream?"
faqA3: "No, whipped cream incorporates air, so 0.5 tbsp weighs less than 7.5 grams. For recipes, always measure whipping cream before whipping unless specified otherwise."
faqQ4: "Can I convert 0.5 tbsp of whipping cream to millilitres instead of grams?"
faqA4: "Yes, 0.5 tbsp is roughly 7.5ml for whipping cream. However, grams (7.5g) are more reliable for air fryer recipes as volume can vary with aeration or temperature."

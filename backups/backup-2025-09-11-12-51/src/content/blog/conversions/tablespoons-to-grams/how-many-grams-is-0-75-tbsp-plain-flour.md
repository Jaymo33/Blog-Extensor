faqQ1: "Why does 0.75 tbsp of plain flour weight matter in air fryer cooking?"
faqA1: "Precise flour measurements ensure even cooking and perfect texture in air fryers. Too much flour can create dense, dry results, while too little may not provide enough structure. The 0.75 tbsp (5.6g) measurement is particularly important for light coatings and batters."
faqQ2: "Can I use self-raising flour instead of plain flour for 0.75 tbsp measurements?"
faqA2: "You can substitute self-raising flour, but be aware it contains raising agents that may affect results. For 0.75 tbsp measurements, the weight difference is minimal (about 5.6g vs 5.7g), but the added leavening could make coatings puffier than intended in air fryer recipes."
faqQ3: "How do I measure 0.75 tbsp of plain flour without measuring spoons?"
faqA3: "Without proper spoons, you can approximate 0.75 tbsp as three quarter-full teaspoons (since 1 tbsp = 3 tsp). However, for accuracy in air fryer recipes, investing in proper measuring tools or a kitchen scale is recommended, especially for small quantities like this."
faqQ4: "Does the brand of plain flour affect the 0.75 tbsp to grams conversion?"
faqA4: "Different brands may have slightly varying densities, but the difference is minimal for UK plain flours. The standard conversion of 0.75 tbsp to 5.6 grams works for most major brands. For absolute precision with your specific flour, you can weigh a larger amount and calculate proportionally."

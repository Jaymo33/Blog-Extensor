faqQ1: "Can I use crunchy almond butter instead of smooth for the same weight?"
faqA1: "Yes, crunchy and smooth almond butter weigh the same per tablespoon (about 16g per tbsp or 48g for 3 tbsp). The texture differs, but the density remains similar. Just ensure you measure it correctly for accurate results."
faqQ2: "Why does my almond butter weigh slightly more or less than 48g for 3 tbsp?"
faqA2: "Small variations can occur due to settling, oil separation, or how tightly packed the almond butter is. For precision, use a kitchen scale. Stirring the almond butter well before measuring helps standardise the weight."
faqQ3: "How do I measure almond butter without making a mess?"
faqA3: "Lightly grease your measuring spoon or use a spatula to scrape out almond butter cleanly. Alternatively, weigh the jar before and after scooping to calculate the exact grams used without sticky spills."
faqQ4: "Can I substitute peanut butter for almond butter in the same grams?"
faqA4: "Yes, peanut butter has a similar density (about 16g per tbsp). However, flavour and texture will differ. Adjust other ingredients if needed, especially in air fryer recipes where moisture balance matters."

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter</h2>  
<p>Accurate measurements are crucial in cooking, especially when using an air fryer. Too much or too little almond butter can affect texture, moisture, and cooking times.

Many air fryer recipes, like our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>energy ball recipes</a>, rely on exact ratios. A kitchen scale is your best friend here—skip the guesswork and measure directly in grams for foolproof results.</p>

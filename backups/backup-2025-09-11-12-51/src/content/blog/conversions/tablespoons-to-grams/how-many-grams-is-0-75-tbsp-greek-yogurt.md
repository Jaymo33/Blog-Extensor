faqQ1: "Can I use regular yogurt instead of greek yogurt for this conversion?"
faqA1: "Yes, but regular yogurt is thinner, so the weight may differ slightly. For 0.75 tbsp, expect about 10 grams instead of 11.25g. Adjust recipes accordingly, especially in baking where texture is key."
faqQ2: "Why is my air fryer recipe soggy when using greek yogurt?"
faqA2: "Too much yogurt can release excess moisture during cooking. Stick to precise measurements like 0.75 tbsp (11.25g) and pat proteins dry before air frying. Preheating the air fryer also helps crispiness."
faqQ3: "How do I store leftover greek yogurt for future air fryer recipes?"
faqA3: "Keep it sealed in the fridge for up to 2 weeks. Stir well before re-measuring, as separation can affect accuracy. For longer storage, freeze in pre-portioned 11.25g (0.75 tbsp) amounts."
faqQ4: "Can I substitute greek yogurt for oil in air fryer recipes?"
faqA4: "Absolutely! Replace oil with an equal weight of greek yogurt (e.g., 11.25g for 0.75 tbsp). It reduces fat while adding protein. Ideal for healthier muffins or crispy coatings."

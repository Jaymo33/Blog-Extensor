faqQ1: "Is 5 tbsp of caster sugar the same as granulated sugar in grams?"
faqA1: "No, 5 tbsp of granulated sugar weighs about 75 grams, compared to 62.5 grams for caster sugar. The larger crystal size of granulated sugar means it packs more densely into a tablespoon. For air fryer recipes, this difference can affect texture and browning times."
faqQ2: "Can I use 5 tbsp of caster sugar in savoury air fryer dishes?"
faqA2: "While uncommon, a small amount of caster sugar can balance flavours in some savoury dishes. For example, 5 tbsp might be used in a large batch of sweet-and-sour sauce or barbecue glaze for air-fried meats. However, most savoury recipes require far less sugar, typically 1-2 tsp at most."
faqQ3: "How does altitude affect 5 tbsp of caster sugar in air fryer baking?"
faqA3: "At high altitudes, sugar concentrations can affect how baked goods rise and set. You might need to slightly reduce the 5 tbsp quantity (by about 1/2 tbsp) to prevent over-spreading or collapsing. The dry air in mountainous regions also causes faster moisture evaporation during air frying."
faqQ4: "Why does my air fryer caramelise sugar faster than my oven?"
faqA4: "Air fryers circulate hot air directly around food at high speed, causing sugars to caramelise quicker than in conventional ovens. The compact cooking chamber also intensifies heat. When using 5 tbsp of caster sugar, reduce cooking time by 15-20% compared to oven recipes, and check frequently to prevent burning."

<p>5 tablespoons (tbsp) of caster sugar equals approximately 62.5 grams (g). This conversion is essential for precise baking, especially when using an air fryer where measurements can impact cooking times and textures. Whether you're making cakes, cookies, or other sweet treats, knowing the exact weight ensures consistent results every time.</p>

<h2>Why accurate sugar measurements matter in air fryer recipes</h2>  
<p>Air fryers cook food faster and more evenly than traditional ovens, so precise measurements are crucial. Too much sugar can cause over-browning or even burning, while too little might leave your baked goods lacking sweetness. For example, if you're following a recipe from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, getting the sugar right ensures perfect texture and flavour. Caster sugar, with its fine granules, dissolves quickly, making it ideal for air fryer desserts like sponges or meringues.</p>  

<p>Many UK bakers prefer weighing ingredients for accuracy, as tablespoon measurements can vary slightly. A digital kitchen scale is a worthwhile investment for anyone serious about air fryer baking.

<h3>How to measure 5 tbsp of caster sugar without scales</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have scales, use the spoon-and-level method for accuracy. Fill your tablespoon with caster sugar, then level it off with a straight edge like a knife. Repeat this five times to get roughly 62.5 grams. Avoid packing the sugar down, as this can lead to over-measuring. For best results, consider investing in a set of measuring spoons designed for UK tablespoons (15ml per tbsp).</p>

<h2>Common uses for 5 tbsp of caster sugar in air fryer recipes</h2>  
<p>This amount of sugar is perfect for small-batch baking in your air fryer. Popular recipes include vanilla cupcakes, shortbread biscuits, or fruit crumbles. For example, <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>air fryer cakes</a> often call for this quantity to sweeten the batter without overwhelming other flavours. Caster sugar’s fine texture also works well in meringues or pavlovas, where smooth dissolution is key.</p>  

<p>You might also use 5 tbsp of caster sugar to make glazes or syrups for air-fried desserts. A simple lemon drizzle cake, for instance, could use this amount mixed with citrus juice for the perfect finishing touch. Remember, air fryers circulate hot air rapidly, so sugary toppings can caramelise beautifully in minutes.</p>

<h3>Converting other sugar types to grams</h3>  
<p>If you’re out of caster sugar, granulated sugar weighs slightly more (about 75g per 5 tbsp), while icing sugar is lighter (around 50g per 5 tbsp). These differences matter in air fryer recipes where moisture content affects cooking.

<h2>Tips for baking with caster sugar in an air fryer</h2>  
<p>Always preheat your air fryer when baking to ensure even cooking. Sugar melts and caramelises quickly in the concentrated heat, so keep an eye on cooking times. For delicate bakes like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cookies>cookies</a>, consider reducing temperature by 10°C if using recipes designed for conventional ovens. Line your air fryer basket with parchment to prevent sugary mixtures from sticking.</p>  

<p>Remember that air fryers vary by model, so you may need to experiment slightly with timings. Start checking your bakes a few minutes early, especially when working with sugar-heavy recipes. The high heat can turn golden brown to burnt surprisingly fast!</p>

faqQ1: "Does the type of rice affect the weight of 0.25 tbsp?"
faqA1: "Yes, slightly. Basmati and jasmine rice are less dense than short-grain varieties, but the difference is minimal. For most recipes, 0.25 tbsp will still weigh around 3.75 grams."
faqQ2: "Can I use this conversion for cooked rice?"
faqA2: "No, cooked rice absorbs water and becomes heavier. This conversion applies only to uncooked rice. For cooked rice, weigh it directly or refer to specific cooked-rice measurements."
faqQ3: "Why is measuring rice important for air fryer recipes?"
faqA3: "Air fryers cook quickly, so precise measurements prevent uneven results. Too much rice can block airflow, while too little may burn. Accurate portions ensure crispy, evenly cooked dishes every time."
faqQ4: "How do I store leftover rice for air frying later?"
faqA4: "Cool cooked rice completely, then store it in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 2 days. Reheat in the air fryer at 160°C for 3–4 minutes, stirring halfway for even warmth."

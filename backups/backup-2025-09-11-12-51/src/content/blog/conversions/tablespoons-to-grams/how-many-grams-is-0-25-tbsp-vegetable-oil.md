faqQ1: "Can I use olive oil instead of vegetable oil for 0.25 tbsp measurements?"
faqA1: "Yes, you can substitute olive oil, but note it’s slightly denser. 0.25 tbsp of olive oil weighs about 3.8 grams compared to vegetable oil’s 3.7 grams. The small difference won’t affect most air fryer recipes, but may alter flavour profiles."
faqQ2: "How do I measure 0.25 tbsp vegetable oil if I only have teaspoons?"
faqA2: "Since 1 tbsp equals 3 tsp, 0.25 tbsp is 3/4 tsp. Use a 1/4 tsp measure three times to reach 0.25 tbsp (3.7g). For accuracy, level off each spoonful with a knife before adding to your air fryer ingredients."
faqQ3: "Why do some air fryer recipes specify oil in grams rather than tablespoons?"
faqA3: "Grams provide precise measurements unaffected by how you fill the spoon. With small quantities like 0.25 tbsp (3.7g), weighing ensures consistency, especially important in air fryers where excess oil can cause smoking or uneven cooking."
faqQ4: "Does the type of vegetable oil affect the 0.25 tbsp to grams conversion?"
faqA4: "Most vegetable oils (rapeseed, sunflower, etc.) have similar densities, so 0.25 tbsp will be roughly 3.7 grams. Exceptions include thicker oils like coconut oil, where 0.25 tbsp weighs about 4 grams when melted. Always check specific oil types for accuracy."

Many air fryer recipes, like those on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>our recipes page</a>, specify oil in grams for accuracy.</p>  

<p>Vegetable oil is a common choice for air frying due to its high smoke point and neutral flavour.

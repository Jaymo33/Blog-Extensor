faqQ1: "Can I use 1.5 tbsp of oats instead of weighing them?"
faqA1: "Yes, you can use 1.5 tbsp of oats as a volume measurement, but weighing them (12g) is more accurate for consistent results. This is especially important in baking or when making air fryer granola, where texture matters."
faqQ2: "Do different types of oats weigh the same per tablespoon?"
faqA2: "Rolled oats and quick oats have similar weights, but steel-cut oats are denser. For 1.5 tbsp, rolled oats weigh about 12 grams, while steel-cut may be slightly heavier. Always check your specific oat type for best results."
faqQ3: "How does 1.5 tbsp of oats convert to cups?"
faqA3: "1.5 tbsp equals 0.09375 cups (or roughly 1/10 cup) of oats. However, for air fryer recipes, we recommend sticking with grams or tablespoons for smaller, more precise measurements."
faqQ4: "Why is my air fryer recipe with oats turning out dry?"
faqA4: "If your dish is dry, you may have used slightly more than 1.5 tbsp (12g) of oats. Always measure carefully, and consider adding a touch more liquid to balance the oats’ absorbency in air fryer cooking."

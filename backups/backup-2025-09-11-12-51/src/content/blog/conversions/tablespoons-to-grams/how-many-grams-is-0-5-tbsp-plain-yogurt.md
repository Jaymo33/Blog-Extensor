faqQ1: "Does the type of plain yogurt affect the gram measurement for 0.5 tbsp?"
faqA1: "Yes, thicker yogurts like Greek yogurt may weigh slightly more per tablespoon compared to regular plain yogurt. While 0.5 tbsp of standard plain yogurt equals about 7.5g, always check your specific brand’s density for complete accuracy in air fryer recipes."
faqQ2: "Can I use 0.5 tbsp of plain yogurt in air fryer baking?"
faqA2: "Absolutely! 0.5 tbsp (7.5g) of plain yogurt works wonderfully in air fryer baking. It adds moisture to cakes and muffins without making batters too wet. The acidity also helps activate baking soda for better rise. Just be sure to measure accurately for consistent results."
faqQ3: "How do I measure 0.5 tbsp of plain yogurt without measuring spoons?"
faqA3: "If you don’t have measuring spoons, use a standard teaspoon—1.5 teaspoons equals 0.5 tbsp. For grams, a digital scale is most accurate (7.5g). Alternatively, visualise half of a UK 10p coin’s volume for a rough estimate in small air fryer recipes."
faqQ4: "Why use grams instead of tablespoons for measuring yogurt in air fryer cooking?"
faqA4: "Grams provide precise measurements unaffected by how you scoop or pack the yogurt. This matters in air fryer cooking where small quantity changes can impact texture and cooking times. Gram measurements also make scaling recipes up or down much easier with consistent results."

faqQ1: "Can I use other oils instead of olive oil in my air fryer?"
faqA1: "Yes, you can substitute olive oil with other oils like avocado, coconut, or sunflower oil. Just note that each oil has a slightly different weight per tablespoon, so adjust measurements accordingly. For example, 0.5 tbsp of coconut oil weighs about 7 grams, slightly more than olive oil."
faqQ2: "Why does my air fryer food come out greasy with 0.5 tbsp of oil?"
faqA2: "If your food is greasy, you might be using too much oil or not distributing it evenly. Try using an oil sprayer for a lighter coating. Also, ensure your air fryer basket isn’t overcrowded, as this can trap moisture and oil."
faqQ3: "How do I convert grams to tablespoons for olive oil?"
faqA3: "To convert grams to tablespoons, divide the weight by 13 (since 1 tbsp ≈ 13 grams). For example, 6.5 grams is 0.5 tbsp. A kitchen scale is the most accurate tool for these conversions."
faqQ4: "Is 0.5 tbsp of olive oil enough for air frying chicken?"
faqA4: "Yes, 0.5 tbsp (6.5 grams) of olive oil is usually sufficient for coating chicken before air frying. For crispier results, pat the chicken dry first and evenly distribute the oil. You can also marinate the chicken for extra flavour."

<p>Olive oil is a staple in many kitchens, and its weight can vary slightly depending on factors like temperature and brand. However, 6.5 grams per 0.5 tbsp is a reliable standard for most cooking needs. Keeping a kitchen scale handy can help you measure precisely, especially for air fryer recipes where every gram counts.</p>  

<h3>How to measure 0.5 tbsp of olive oil without scales</h3>

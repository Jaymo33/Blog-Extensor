faqQ1: "Can I use Greek yogurt instead of plain yogurt for this conversion?"
faqA1: "Yes, but Greek yogurt is thicker, so 2.5 tbsp may weigh slightly more—around 40-45 grams. Adjust your recipe accordingly, especially if texture is crucial."
faqQ2: "Why is measuring yogurt in grams better than tablespoons?"
faqA2: "Grams provide consistency because yogurt density varies. Tablespoons measure volume, which can differ based on how you scoop. Weight ensures accuracy every time."
faqQ3: "How do I convert other yogurt amounts to grams?"
faqA3: "Use the ratio of 1 tbsp ≈ 15 grams for plain yogurt. For larger quantities, multiply accordingly. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a> simplifies this."
faqQ4: "Can I substitute yogurt in air fryer recipes?"
faqA4: "Yes, but consider the recipe’s needs. Yogurt adds moisture and tang, so substitutes like buttermilk or sour cream may alter flavour and texture slightly."

<h3>Tips for storing and handling yogurt</h3>

faqQ1: "Does the brand of soy milk affect the weight of 3 tablespoons?"
faqA1: "Different brands of soy milk can vary slightly in density due to ingredients like added thickeners or sweeteners. However, the difference is minimal - 3 tablespoons will generally weigh around 45g across most brands. For absolute precision in air fryer recipes, it's best to weigh your soy milk rather than relying solely on volume measurements."
faqQ2: "Can I use this 3 tbsp soy milk to grams conversion for other plant-based milks?"
faqA2: "While almond, oat, and coconut milk have similar densities to soy milk, they're not identical. 3 tablespoons of these alternatives might weigh between 42-48g. For critical recipes, especially in air fryer baking, it's worth checking the specific weight of your chosen plant-based milk to ensure perfect results every time."
faqQ3: "Why is weighing soy milk better than measuring by volume for air fryer recipes?"
faqA3: "Weighing ingredients like soy milk eliminates variables such as how firmly you pack the measuring spoon or minor density differences between brands. Air fryers cook food quickly and intensely, so precise measurements (45g for 3 tbsp soy milk) ensure consistent moisture levels and prevent under or overcooking."
faqQ4: "How does 3 tbsp of soy milk (45g) compare to dairy milk in air fryer recipes?"
faqA4: "By weight, 3 tbsp of dairy milk is also about 45g, so you can typically substitute them 1:1 in air fryer recipes. However, soy milk may brown faster and has a slightly different protein structure, which can affect texture. For best results, monitor your cooking time and adjust as needed when using soy milk."

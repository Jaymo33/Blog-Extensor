faqQ1: "Can I use regular yogurt instead of greek yogurt in air fryer recipes?"
faqA1: "Yes, but keep in mind that regular yogurt has a thinner consistency and higher water content. You may need to adjust the quantity slightly or strain it to achieve a similar texture. For precise conversions, check our air fryer conversion chart."
faqQ2: "How do I measure 2.5 tbsp of greek yogurt without a scale?"
faqA2: "Use a standard tablespoon measure and level off each scoop with a straight edge. Fill it twice, then half-fill it a third time for 2.5 tbsp total. For sticky yogurts, lightly grease the spoon first for easier release."
faqQ3: "Does the fat content of greek yogurt affect the weight per tablespoon?"
faqA3: "The difference is minimal—full-fat and low-fat greek yogurt weigh roughly the same per tablespoon. However, fat content can impact recipe outcomes, so choose the type specified in your air fryer dish for best results."
faqQ4: "Can I freeze greek yogurt for later use in air fryer recipes?"
faqA4: "Yes, but the texture may change slightly after thawing. Stir it well before using, or incorporate it into sauces or batters where consistency is less critical. Frozen yogurt works well in marinades or baked goods."

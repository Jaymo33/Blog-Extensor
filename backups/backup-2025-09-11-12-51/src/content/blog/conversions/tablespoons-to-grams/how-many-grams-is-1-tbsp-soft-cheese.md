faqQ1: "Does the type of soft cheese affect the weight per tablespoon?"
faqA1: "Yes, different soft cheeses have slightly varying weights due to moisture and density. For example, cream cheese is typically 15g per tbsp, while ricotta may be closer to 14g. Always check packaging or use a scale for accuracy."
faqQ2: "Can I use a heaped tablespoon instead of levelled for soft cheese?"
faqA2: "A heaped tablespoon can add up to 20g or more, which may throw off your recipe’s balance. For best results, level off the spoon to ensure you’re using the correct 15g measurement."
faqQ3: "How do I convert larger amounts of soft cheese from tablespoons to grams?"
faqA3: "Multiply the number of tablespoons by 15 to get the weight in grams. For example, 3 tbsp of soft cheese equals roughly 45g. A kitchen scale is the most reliable tool for larger quantities."
faqQ4: "Why is my air fryer recipe too creamy or dry when using soft cheese?"
faqA4: "This often happens due to inaccurate measurements. Too much cheese makes dishes overly rich, while too little can leave them dry. Stick to 15g per tbsp for balanced results in air fryer cooking."

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers cook food quickly and evenly, but they rely on precise ingredient ratios for the best results. Using too much or too little soft cheese can affect texture and flavour. For example, adding 15 grams (1 tbsp) of soft cheese to a sauce ensures it’s creamy without being overly rich. If you’re prepping meals in advance, accurate measurements also help with portion control.

<h3>Types of soft cheese and their weights</h3>  
<p>Not all soft cheeses weigh the same per tablespoon. Cream cheese, ricotta, and mascarpone have slight variations due to moisture content. For instance, 1 tbsp of cream cheese is about 15 grams, while ricotta might be closer to 14 grams. Always check the packaging or use a kitchen scale for the most accurate conversion.

<h2>How to measure soft cheese without a scale</h2>  
<p>If you don’t have a scale, use a standard UK tablespoon (15ml) and level it off for an approximate 15-gram measure. Avoid packing the cheese down, as this can lead to over-measuring. For sticky cheeses like cream cheese, lightly greasing the spoon helps it slide off easily. Need more measurement hacks?

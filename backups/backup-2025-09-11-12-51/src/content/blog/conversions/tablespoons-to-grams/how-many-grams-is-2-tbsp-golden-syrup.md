faqQ1: "Can I use honey instead of golden syrup in air fryer recipes?"
faqA1: "Yes, honey can substitute golden syrup in a 1:1 ratio by volume, but the flavour will be different. Honey is slightly sweeter and has a floral note, whereas golden syrup has a deeper caramel taste. Adjust other sweeteners in the recipe if needed."
faqQ2: "Why does my golden syrup measurement vary slightly each time?"
faqA2: "Golden syrup’s thickness and stickiness can cause small variations in volume measurements. For absolute accuracy, use a digital scale to measure 42g for 2 tbsp. Temperature also affects viscosity—warmer syrup pours more easily, potentially leading to over-pouring."
faqQ3: "How do I clean golden syrup from my air fryer basket?"
faqA3: "Soak the air fryer basket in warm, soapy water to loosen sticky residue. For stubborn spots, use a soft brush or sponge with <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner</a>. Avoid abrasive scrubbers to prevent damaging the non-stick coating."
faqQ4: "Is golden syrup the same as treacle?"
faqA4: "No, golden syrup is lighter and sweeter than treacle, which has a stronger, bittersweet flavour. While both are invert sugars, they aren’t interchangeable in recipes without adjusting quantities. Golden syrup works better for delicate air fryer desserts."

<p>2 tablespoons (tbsp) of golden syrup equals approximately 42 grams in the UK. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precision matters, ensuring your dishes turn out perfectly every time. Whether you’re baking sticky toffee pudding or glazing roasted vegetables, knowing the exact weight of golden syrup helps avoid over-sweetening or under-measuring.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate golden syrup measurements matter</h2>  
<p>Golden syrup is a staple in many British desserts and savoury dishes, especially those prepared in an air fryer. Using too much can make your dish overly sweet, while too little might leave it lacking flavour. For example, if you’re making <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer cookies</a>, 2 tbsp of golden syrup (42g) ensures the right chewy texture without being cloying. Always measure golden syrup by weight for consistency, as its sticky nature makes volume measurements tricky.</p>  

<p>Many air fryer recipes, like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>desserts</a>, rely on golden syrup for moisture and sweetness. A digital kitchen scale is the best tool for this, as it eliminates the guesswork of spoon measurements. If you’re converting from US recipes, note that UK tablespoons are slightly larger (15ml vs. 14.79ml), but the difference in grams is minimal for home cooking.</p>  

<h3>How to measure golden syrup without scales</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have scales, use the spoon-and-level method for 2 tbsp of golden syrup. Fill the spoon to the brim, then level it off with a straight edge. This method isn’t as precise as weighing, but it’s a handy backup. For sticky ingredients like golden syrup, lightly greasing the spoon helps it slide off easily, ensuring you get the full 42g.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for 2 tbsp of golden syrup in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Golden syrup adds a rich, caramelised flavour to air fryer dishes. For instance, 2 tbsp (42g) is perfect for glazing <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>air fryer chicken wings</a>, giving them a glossy finish. It’s also a key ingredient in flapjacks, where precise measurements ensure the right balance of chewiness and crunch. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a> for other common ingredient weights.</p>  

<p>Another great use is in marinades for meats like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/lamb>lamb</a>, where 2 tbsp of golden syrup balances savoury spices. Its high sugar content also helps create a crispy exterior in the air fryer. Remember, golden syrup burns easily, so adjust cooking times and temperatures accordingly to avoid charring.</p>  

<h3>Storing golden syrup for accurate measurements</h3>  
<p>Keep golden syrup in a cool, dry place to maintain its consistency. If it crystallises, gently warm the jar in hot water to return it to a liquid state. This ensures easy pouring and accurate measurements for your air fryer recipes. Always wipe the rim of the jar after use to prevent sticking and spoilage.</p>

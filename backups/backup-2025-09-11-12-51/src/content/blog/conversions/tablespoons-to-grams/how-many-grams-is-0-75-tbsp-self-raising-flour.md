faqQ1: "Can I use plain flour instead of self-raising flour for 0.75 tbsp?"
faqA1: "Yes, but you'll need to add baking powder. For every 100g of plain flour, add 1 tsp of baking powder. Since 0.75 tbsp is about 5.6g, you'd need a tiny pinch—roughly 1/16 tsp. Self-raising flour is more convenient for small measurements like this."
faqQ2: "Why does 0.75 tbsp of self-raising flour weigh 5.6 grams?"
faqA2: "The weight accounts for the flour's density and the added raising agents. Self-raising flour is slightly lighter than plain flour due to the baking powder. This 5.6g measurement is an average—factors like how you scoop the flour can cause minor variations."
faqQ3: "How do I measure 0.75 tbsp without a measuring spoon?"
faqA3: "Use a 1/2 tbsp measure and fill it halfway, or use 2.25 tsp. For the most accuracy, weigh 5.6g on digital scales. Eyeballing small amounts like 0.75 tbsp can lead to inconsistent results, especially in air fryer baking."
faqQ4: "Does the brand of self-raising flour affect the weight?"
faqA4: "Slightly—different brands may have varying densities or raising agent ratios. However, the 5.6g per 0.75 tbsp is a reliable standard across UK brands. For critical baking, always use the same brand once you find one that works well."

<h2>Why accurate flour measurements matter</h2>
<p>Baking is a science, and even small discrepancies in flour measurements can affect your results. Too much flour can make your cakes dense, while too little can leave them flat. Using grams instead of tablespoons eliminates guesswork, especially with self-raising flour, which contains baking powder. Air fryer recipes, like those on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>our recipes page</a>, often require precision for even cooking. Measuring by weight ensures your bakes turn out perfectly every time.</p>

<p>Self-raising flour is a staple in British baking, and its unique composition means it behaves differently to plain flour. The added raising agents mean that the weight per tablespoon can vary slightly. For 0.75 tbsp of self-raising flour, the 5.6-gram measurement is a reliable average. If you're adapting a recipe for your air fryer, this accuracy is key to success.</p>

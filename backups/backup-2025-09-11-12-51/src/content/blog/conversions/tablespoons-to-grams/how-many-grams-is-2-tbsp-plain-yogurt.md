faqQ1: "Can I use Greek yogurt instead of plain yogurt in air fryer recipes?"
faqA1: "Yes, you can substitute Greek yogurt, but note it’s thicker and weighs slightly more—around 35 grams per 2 tbsp. Adjust liquids in your recipe if needed, as Greek yogurt may make mixtures denser."
faqQ2: "Why is weighing yogurt better than measuring by volume?"
faqA2: "Weighing yogurt in grams ensures accuracy, especially since thickness varies between brands. Volume measurements (like tablespoons) can be inconsistent, affecting recipe outcomes."
faqQ3: "How do I convert 2 tbsp of yogurt to grams if my recipe uses cups?"
faqA3: "One cup of plain yogurt is roughly 245 grams, so 2 tbsp (30g) is about 1/8 of a cup. Use a kitchen scale for the most precise conversion."
faqQ4: "Does flavoured yogurt weigh the same as plain yogurt?"
faqA4: "Flavoured yogurts may weigh slightly more due to added sugars or fruit. For accuracy, check the nutrition label or weigh it yourself before using in recipes."

<p>2 tablespoons (tbsp) of plain yogurt weigh approximately 30 grams. This measurement is handy for air fryer recipes where precision matters, ensuring your dishes turn out perfectly every time. Whether you're making marinades, dips, or baked goods, knowing this conversion helps streamline your cooking process.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on precise ingredient ratios to achieve the best texture and flavour. Too much or too little yogurt can affect moisture levels, cooking times, and even browning. For example, adding the right amount of yogurt to a marinade ensures your chicken stays juicy while crisping up nicely.

<p>Many air fryer recipes, like our popular <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken dishes</a>, call for yogurt as a tenderiser. Measuring by weight (grams) rather than volume (tablespoons) eliminates guesswork, especially since yogurt thickness can vary. A kitchen scale is your best friend here, but if you don’t have one, our conversion guide ensures accuracy.</p>  

<h3>How to measure 2 tbsp of plain yogurt without scales</h3>  
<p>If you don’t own a kitchen scale, use standard measuring spoons for 2 tbsp of plain yogurt. Fill the spoon evenly without packing it down, and level off the excess with a knife. Remember, thicker Greek yogurt may weigh slightly more—around 35 grams per 2 tbsp—so adjust accordingly.

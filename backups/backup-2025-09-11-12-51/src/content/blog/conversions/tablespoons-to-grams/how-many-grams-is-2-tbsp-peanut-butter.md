faqA2: "Yes, almond or cashew butter have similar densities, so 2 tbsp will also be roughly 32 grams. However, thicker spreads like tahini might weigh slightly more, so checking with a scale is best for precision."
faqQ3: "Why is weighing peanut butter better than using tablespoons in air fryer cooking?"

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on precise ingredient ratios to deliver crispy, evenly cooked results. Too much or too little peanut butter can alter the texture of your dish. For example, adding extra peanut butter to energy balls might make them overly dense. On the other hand, skimping on it in a satay sauce could leave it too runny. That’s why converting 2 tbsp of peanut butter to grams (32g) is so useful.</p>  
<p>If you’re meal prepping or scaling recipes, grams provide a more reliable measurement than volume. A digital kitchen scale is a must-have tool for air fryer enthusiasts.

<h2>How to measure peanut butter for air fryer recipes</h2>  
<p>Measuring sticky ingredients like peanut butter can be tricky. For the most accurate results, use a spoon to scoop it into a measuring tablespoon, then level it off with a knife. Alternatively, weigh it directly on a digital scale for precision. If your recipe calls for 2 tbsp of peanut butter (32g), this method eliminates guesswork.</p>  

<h3>Using grams vs. tablespoons</h3>  
<p>Grams are more consistent than tablespoons because peanut butter’s density can vary based on brand or natural separation. For UK cooks, 2 tbsp of peanut butter equals 32 grams, regardless of whether it’s smooth or crunchy. This standardisation is especially helpful when adapting American recipes, which often use volume measurements.</p>

If your peanut butter is particularly oily, give it a stir before measuring to ensure consistency. This small step can make a big difference in recipes like air-fried peanut butter banana rolls.</p>

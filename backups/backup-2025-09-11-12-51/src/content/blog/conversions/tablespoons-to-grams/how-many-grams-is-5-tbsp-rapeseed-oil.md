faqQ1: "Can I use 5 tbsp rapeseed oil interchangeably with other oils in an air fryer?"
faqA1: "Yes, but adjust for density differences. For example, 5 tbsp olive oil weighs about 67g (slightly less than rapeseed oil). Always check smoke points—rapeseed oil’s high tolerance (230°C) makes it ideal for air frying compared to butter or coconut oil."
faqQ2: "Why does 5 tbsp rapeseed oil sometimes weigh more or less than 68g?"
faqA2: "Variations occur due to temperature (cold oil is denser) or measuring techniques. For accuracy, use scales. A slightly heaped tablespoon might add 1-2g, while underfilled spoons subtract weight. Consistency matters most in air fryer recipes."
faqQ3: "How many calories are in 5 tbsp (68g) rapeseed oil?"
faqA3: "Five tablespoons contain roughly 612 calories (9kcal/g). While air fryers use less oil than deep frying, mindful measuring helps control intake. Consider spray bottles for lighter coverage in recipes like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>air-fried vegetables</a>."
faqQ4: "Is rapeseed oil better than sunflower oil for air frying?"
faqA4: "Both work, but rapeseed oil has a higher smoke point and more omega-3s. For 5 tbsp portions, the gram difference is minimal (sunflower oil: ~67g). Rapeseed’s neutral taste suits most <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> dishes, from meats to desserts."

<p>5 tablespoons (tbsp) of rapeseed oil equals approximately 68 grams (g). This conversion is essential for precise cooking, especially when using an air fryer where exact measurements can impact texture and crispiness. Whether you’re adapting a recipe or scaling ingredients, knowing the weight of 5 tbsp rapeseed oil ensures consistency in your dishes.</p>

<h2>Why convert 5 tbsp rapeseed oil to grams?</h2>  
<p>Converting tablespoons to grams is crucial for accuracy, particularly in air fryer cooking where even small variations can affect results. Rapeseed oil, a popular choice for its high smoke point and mild flavour, is often measured by volume in recipes. However, weight measurements (grams) eliminate inconsistencies caused by how the oil is poured or levelled. For air fryer recipes, precise oil amounts help achieve that perfect crisp without excess grease.</p>  
<p>At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we recommend using grams for reliable outcomes. This is especially handy when preparing dishes like roasted vegetables or crispy chicken, where oil distribution matters. Our conversion chart simplifies the process, so you can focus on cooking rather than calculations.</p>  

<h3>How to measure 5 tbsp rapeseed oil accurately</h3>  
<p>To measure 5 tbsp rapeseed oil, use a standard UK tablespoon (15ml per tbsp). Fill the spoon to the brim without letting it overflow, then level it with a knife for precision. If converting to grams, a kitchen scale is your best friend—simply pour until it hits 68g. For air fryer recipes, lightly coating ingredients with this amount ensures even cooking without sogginess.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for 5 tbsp rapeseed oil in air fryers</h2>  
<p>Five tablespoons of rapeseed oil (68g) is ideal for batch cooking or marinating. For example, tossing potatoes in this quantity before air frying gives them a golden, crispy finish.

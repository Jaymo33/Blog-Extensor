faqQ1: "Can I use olive oil instead of rapeseed oil for 0.25 tbsp measurements?"
faqA1: "Yes, you can substitute olive oil, but note that 0.25 tbsp of olive oil weighs about 4 grams compared to rapeseed oil’s 3.7 grams. The slight difference won’t affect most air fryer recipes, though rapeseed oil’s higher smoke point makes it better for high-temperature cooking."

faqA3: "Rapeseed oil has a high smoke point (230°C), neutral flavour, and heart-healthy fats. These qualities make it ideal for air frying, where temperatures often reach 200°C. Its light viscosity also ensures even coating with small quantities like 0.25 tbsp (3.7 grams)."
faqQ4: "Does 0.25 tbsp rapeseed oil make a difference in air fryer cooking?"

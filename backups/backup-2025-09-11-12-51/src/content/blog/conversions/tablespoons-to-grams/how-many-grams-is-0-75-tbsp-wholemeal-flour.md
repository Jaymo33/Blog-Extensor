faqQ1: "Can I use plain flour instead of wholemeal flour in this conversion?"
faqA1: "No, plain flour has a different density to wholemeal flour. While 0.75 tbsp of wholemeal flour equals 5.6 grams, the same volume of plain flour would be about 5 grams. For accurate results in air fryer recipes, it's best to use the specific type of flour mentioned."
faqQ2: "How do I measure 0.75 tbsp without special measuring spoons?"
faqA2: "You can use a regular tablespoon and eyeball three-quarters full. Alternatively, measure 1 tbsp and remove about a quarter of it. For absolute precision in air fryer cooking, we recommend using digital scales to measure the 5.6 grams directly."
faqQ3: "Does the brand of wholemeal flour affect the weight?"
faqA3: "Different brands can have slightly varying densities, but the difference is usually minimal. Most UK wholemeal flours will weigh approximately 5.6 grams for 0.75 tbsp. If you're working with an unusually coarse or fine flour, weighing is more reliable than volume measures."
faqQ4: "Why do air fryer recipes sometimes use grams instead of tablespoons?"
faqA4: "Grams provide more consistent results in air fryer cooking because they account for variations in how ingredients settle. Volume measures like tablespoons can be packed differently, affecting recipe outcomes. That's why knowing conversions like 0.75 tbsp wholemeal flour to grams (5.6g) is so valuable."

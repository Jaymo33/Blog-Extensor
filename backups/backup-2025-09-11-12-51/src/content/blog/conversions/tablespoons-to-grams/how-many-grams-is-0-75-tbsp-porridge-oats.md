faqQ1: "Can I use instant oats instead of porridge oats for 0.75 tbsp measurements?"
faqA1: "Instant oats are finer and denser than porridge oats, so 0.75 tbsp would weigh slightly more. For accuracy, stick to porridge oats or adjust the weight to about 6 grams if using instant oats. The texture in recipes will also differ, with instant oats becoming softer faster."
faqQ2: "How do I convert 0.75 tbsp of porridge oats to cups?"
faqA2: "0.75 tbsp is roughly 0.047 cups (about 1/20th of a cup). For air fryer recipes, we recommend sticking to grams or tablespoons for small quantities like this, as cup measurements are less precise for such small amounts."
faqQ3: "Does the brand of porridge oats affect the weight of 0.75 tbsp?"
faqA3: "Different brands can vary slightly in density, but the difference is minimal—usually within 0.5 grams for 0.75 tbsp. For absolute precision in recipes like energy balls or granola, weighing is always best regardless of brand."
faqQ4: "Can I substitute 0.75 tbsp of porridge oats with flour in air fryer recipes?"
faqA4: "Flour behaves very differently from oats in cooking. While you could substitute gram-for-gram (about 5.6g), the texture and binding properties will change significantly. Oats provide structure and chewiness that flour doesn’t replicate, especially in air fryer recipes."

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>
<p>Air fryers rely on even cooking, and incorrect measurements can lead to uneven results. Too many oats might make your dish dry, while too few could leave it soggy. Porridge oats are a staple in many <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a>, from breakfast bars to crumbles. Measuring by weight (grams) is more reliable than volume (tablespoons) because it accounts for density variations. This is especially important for recipes like oat-based energy balls or granola clusters.</p>

<p>Using a digital scale for 0.75 tbsp of porridge oats ensures you get the perfect 5.6 grams every time. This precision is key for meal prepping or baking, where consistency is crucial.

faqQ1: "Does the type of BBQ sauce affect the weight of 4 tablespoons?"
faqA1: "Yes, thicker BBQ sauces (like smoky or honey-based) can weigh slightly more—around 65 grams for 4 tbsp. Lighter, vinegar-based sauces may be closer to 55 grams. Always check labels for density variations, especially with sugar-free or low-sodium options."
faqQ2: "Can I use 4 tbsp of BBQ sauce straight from the fridge in my air fryer?"
faqA2: "It’s best to let chilled BBQ sauce reach room temperature first. Cold sauce can lower the air fryer’s temperature temporarily, affecting crispiness. Stirring it beforehand also ensures even distribution when coating food."
faqQ3: "How do I convert 4 tbsp of BBQ sauce to grams if my recipe uses cups?"
faqA3: "Four tablespoons equal ¼ cup, so 60 grams of BBQ sauce is roughly ¼ cup. For larger batches, remember 1 cup of BBQ sauce weighs about 240 grams. Use a scale for precision, especially with sticky ingredients."
faqQ4: "Why does my air fryer recipe call for grams instead of tablespoons for BBQ sauce?"
faqA4: "Grams ensure consistency across brands and batch sizes, crucial for air fryers’ rapid cooking. Tablespoons can vary based on how sauce is scooped or levelled. Weight measurements eliminate guesswork for perfect results every time."

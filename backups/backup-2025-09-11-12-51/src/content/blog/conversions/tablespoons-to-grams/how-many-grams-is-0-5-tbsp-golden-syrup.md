faqQ1: "Can I use honey instead of 0.5 tbsp golden syrup in air fryer recipes?"
faqA1: "Yes, honey can substitute golden syrup at a 1:1 ratio, but it’s slightly runnier. For 0.5 tbsp (10.5g golden syrup), use the same volume of honey, though flavour profiles differ. Adjust cooking times slightly as honey may caramelise faster in the air fryer."
faqQ2: "How do I clean golden syrup residue from my air fryer basket?"
faqA2: "Soak the basket in warm, soapy water to loosen sticky residue. For stubborn spots, use a soft brush or our recommended <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner</a>. Avoid abrasive scrubbers to prevent coating damage."
faqQ3: "Does 0.5 tbsp golden syrup have the same grams as treacle?"
faqA3: "No, black treacle is denser. While 0.5 tbsp golden syrup is 10.5g, treacle weighs about 11g per 0.5 tbsp. Adjust recipes accordingly, as treacle also has a stronger, more bitter taste."
faqQ4: "Can I reduce the 0.5 tbsp golden syrup in air fryer recipes for less sweetness?"
faqA4: "Absolutely! Reduce to 0.25 tbsp (5g) or replace with unsweetened applesauce for moisture. Test small batches first, as air fryers intensify flavours. Check our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable recipes</a> for naturally sweet alternatives."

<p>Golden syrup is a staple in British baking, adding moisture and sweetness to air fryer treats like flapjacks or sticky puddings.

<p>Air fryers circulate hot air, so sticky ingredients like golden syrup need precise ratios to caramelise without burning. A digital scale is ideal, but if you're using spoons, our conversion helps bridge the gap.

<h3>How to measure 0.5 tbsp golden syrup without scales</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have scales, fill a tablespoon halfway (0.5 tbsp) with golden syrup, levelling it with a knife. Remember, 0.5 tbsp golden syrup to grams is roughly 10.5g, but slight variations occur based on syrup density. For sticky ingredients, lightly greasing the spoon helps with accurate pouring.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for 0.5 tbsp golden syrup in air fryers</h2>  
<p>This small quantity works well in glazes for air-fried ham or brushed onto roasted carrots. It’s also perfect for single-serving desserts, like a drizzle over <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>air fryer cakes</a>. The 10.5-gram measurement ensures balanced sweetness without overpowering other flavours.</p>  

<p>Golden syrup’s thick consistency can help bind granola clusters or crisp up pastry edges. For savoury dishes, combine 0.5 tbsp (10.5g) with mustard for a quick glaze. Find more creative uses in our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert category</a>.</p>  

<h3>Storing golden syrup for accurate measurements</h3>

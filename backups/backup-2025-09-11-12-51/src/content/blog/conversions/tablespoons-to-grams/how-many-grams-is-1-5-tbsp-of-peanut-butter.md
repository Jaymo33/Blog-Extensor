faqQ1: "Does the type of peanut butter affect the gram measurement?"
faqA1: "Yes, different peanut butter types can slightly affect the weight. Natural peanut butter tends to be less dense (about 15g per tbsp) while commercial brands with additives are denser (about 17g per tbsp). For most standard UK peanut butters, 1.5 tbsp equals approximately 24 grams."
faqQ2: "Can I use this conversion for other nut butters?"
faqA2: "This conversion works well for most nut butters with similar consistency to peanut butter, like almond or cashew butter. However, very runny or extremely thick nut butters might vary slightly. When in doubt, weighing your 1.5 tbsp portion is the most accurate method."
faqQ3: "Why is weight measurement better for air fryer recipes?"
faqA3: "Weight measurements are more precise for air fryer cooking because they account for ingredient density variations. The air fryer's rapid circulation cooking requires exact ratios for even cooking. Measuring 1.5 tbsp peanut butter as 24 grams ensures consistent results batch after batch."
faqQ4: "How do I measure peanut butter without making a mess?"
faqA4: "To measure 1.5 tbsp (24g) of peanut butter cleanly, lightly grease your measuring spoon first or use a small spatula to transfer it. For weighing, place parchment paper on your scales, tare to zero, then add peanut butter directly onto the paper until you reach 24 grams."

<h2>Why accurate peanut butter measurements matter</h2>
<p>When cooking in an air fryer, precise measurements can make or break your dish. Too much peanut butter can make cookies spread too thin, while too little might leave your satay sauce lacking flavour. That's why converting 1.5 tbsp peanut butter to grams is so helpful - it takes the guesswork out of measuring sticky ingredients. Our conversion chart at <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart</a> makes these calculations simple.</p>
<p>Peanut butter's density can vary slightly between brands, but most standard UK peanut butters weigh about 16 grams per tablespoon. This means 1.5 tablespoons equals roughly 24 grams. For air fryer recipes where every gram counts, this precision ensures your dishes turn out perfectly cooked every time. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> section for inspiration on how to use your perfectly measured peanut butter.</p>

<h2>How to measure peanut butter accurately</h2>
<p>Measuring sticky ingredients like peanut butter can be tricky. Here are some pro tips to get your 1.5 tablespoons (24 grams) measured perfectly every time:</p>
<h3>Using measuring spoons</h3>
<p>For the most accurate 1.5 tbsp peanut butter measurement, use proper measuring spoons rather than regular cutlery. Level off each tablespoon with a straight edge for precision. Remember that 1.5 tablespoons equals 1 tablespoon plus half a tablespoon - not three half-tablespoons. This method works well for most <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cookies>cookie recipes</a> in your air fryer.</p>

<h3>Weighing with kitchen scales</h3>
<p>The most accurate way to measure 1.5 tbsp peanut butter in grams is using digital kitchen scales. Simply place your bowl on the scales, tare to zero, then add peanut butter until you reach 24 grams. This method eliminates any packing differences and gives you the exact amount needed for air fryer cooking.</p>

<h2>Peanut butter conversions for common air fryer recipes</h2>
<p>Now that you know 1.5 tbsp equals 24 grams, here's how this measurement fits into popular air fryer dishes:</p>
<p>For air fryer peanut butter cookies, you'll typically need about 48 grams (3 tbsp) of peanut butter per batch. Our conversion means this equals exactly two portions of 1.5 tbsp (24 grams each). When making satay sauce for <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>air fryer chicken</a>, 1.5 tablespoons (24 grams) makes enough sauce for 2-3 servings. Remember to clean your air fryer after cooking with sticky ingredients using our recommended <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning methods</a>.</p>

<h2>Adjusting recipes between volume and weight</h2>
<p>Many older recipes use tablespoons while modern ones prefer grams. Knowing that 1.5 tbsp peanut butter equals 24 grams helps bridge this gap. Here's why weight measurements are often better:</p>
<p>Weight measurements account for how ingredients are packed into measuring spoons. A heaped tablespoon of peanut butter could weigh significantly more than a level one, while grams remain consistent. This precision is particularly important in air fryer cooking where even heating requires consistent ingredient ratios. Whether you're making desserts or savoury dishes, our 1.5 tbsp to gram conversion ensures reliable results.</p>

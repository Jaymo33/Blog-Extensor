faqQ1: "Can I use plain flour instead of cornflour in air fryer recipes?"
faqA1: "Yes, but the texture will differ. Cornflour creates a lighter, crispier coating, while plain flour may result in a denser finish. If substituting, use the same weight (12g for 1.5 tbsp) but expect a slightly different outcome."
faqQ2: "Why does my air fryer coating turn out soggy?"
faqA2: "Sogginess often happens if there’s too much moisture or uneven cornflour distribution. Ensure your ingredients are dry before coating, and shake off excess flour. Preheating the air fryer also helps achieve crispiness."
faqQ3: "How do I clean cornflour residue from my air fryer?"
faqA3: "Use a soft brush or damp cloth to wipe away any loose cornflour after cooking. For stubborn residue, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner guide</a> has step-by-step tips."
faqQ4: "Is cornflour the same as cornstarch in the UK?"
faqA4: "Yes, cornflour and cornstarch are the same product in the UK. Both refer to the fine, white powder used for thickening and frying. Always check labels if using international recipes to avoid confusion."

faqQ1: "Can I use honey instead of agave syrup in air fryer recipes?"
faqA1: "Yes, you can substitute honey for agave syrup, but note that honey is slightly denser. 2.5 tbsp of honey weighs around 53g compared to agave’s 50g. Adjust cooking times slightly, as honey caramelises faster and may burn if not monitored."
faqQ2: "Why does my agave syrup glaze burn in the air fryer?"
faqA2: "Agave syrup has a high sugar content, which can caramelise quickly under high heat. To prevent burning, apply a thin layer and reduce cooking time or temperature. You can also mix it with a little water or oil to dilute its intensity."
faqQ3: "Is agave syrup healthier than sugar in air fryer recipes?"
faqA3: "Agave syrup has a lower glycemic index than refined sugar, making it a popular choice for healthier recipes. However, it’s still high in fructose, so moderation is key. It works well in air fryer dishes where a mild, liquid sweetener is needed."
faqQ4: "How do I clean agave syrup residue from my air fryer?"
faqA4: "Agave syrup can leave sticky residue. Let the air fryer cool, then wipe with a damp cloth or use a mild cleaner. For tough spots, a mixture of warm water and baking soda works well. Regular cleaning prevents buildup and maintains performance."

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on precise ingredient ratios to achieve the best texture and flavour. Too much or too little agave syrup can affect browning, caramelisation, and moisture levels.

<h3>How to measure agave syrup correctly</h3>  
<p>Agave syrup is thick and sticky, making it tricky to measure by volume alone. Using a digital kitchen scale for grams ensures accuracy. If you don’t have one, lightly grease your measuring spoon to help the syrup slide out easily. Remember, 2.5 tbsp of agave syrup is roughly 50g, but slight variations can occur based on density and temperature.</p>

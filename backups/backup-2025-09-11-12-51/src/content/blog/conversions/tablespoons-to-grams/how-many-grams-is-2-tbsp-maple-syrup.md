faqQ1: "Can I use honey instead of maple syrup in air fryer recipes?"
faqA1: "Yes, honey can substitute maple syrup in most air fryer recipes, but it’s slightly denser. Use the same volume (2 tbsp), but note that honey weighs around 42 grams compared to maple syrup’s 40 grams. Adjust cooking times slightly to prevent over-browning."
faqQ2: "Why is weighing maple syrup better than measuring by volume?"
faqA2: "Weighing maple syrup in grams ensures accuracy because syrups can vary in thickness. Volume measurements (like tablespoons) can be inconsistent, especially with sticky ingredients. A digital scale guarantees precise amounts for perfect air fryer results every time."
faqQ3: "Does the type of maple syrup affect the weight?"
faqA3: "Yes, darker, thicker maple syrups (like Grade B) may weigh slightly more per tablespoon than lighter ones. However, the difference is minimal—around 1-2 grams per 2 tbsp. For most recipes, 40 grams is a safe estimate."
faqQ4: "How do I clean my air fryer after using sticky maple syrup?"
faqA4: "Wipe the air fryer basket with warm, soapy water immediately after use to prevent syrup from hardening. For stubborn residue, soak the basket in warm water with a bit of baking soda. Regular cleaning keeps your air fryer functioning perfectly."

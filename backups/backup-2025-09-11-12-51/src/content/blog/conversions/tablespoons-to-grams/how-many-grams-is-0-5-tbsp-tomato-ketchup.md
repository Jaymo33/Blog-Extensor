faqQ1: "Is 0.5 tbsp of tomato ketchup the same as 1 tsp?"
faqA1: "No, 0.5 tbsp equals 1.5 tsp. Tablespoons and teaspoons measure different volumes, so conversions matter for precision. In grams, 0.5 tbsp (7.5g) is 50% more than 1 tsp (5g). Always check measurements when adapting recipes."
faqQ2: "Does tomato ketchup weigh the same as other sauces?"
faqA2: "No, sauces vary by density. For example, 0.5 tbsp of mayo weighs about 7g, while soy sauce is closer to 7.5g. Always weigh sticky sauces like ketchup for air fryer recipes to avoid mess and ensure even cooking."
faqQ3: "Can I use grams instead of tablespoons in all air fryer recipes?"
faqA3: "Yes, grams often provide better accuracy, especially for sauces and marinades. Most modern air fryer recipes include gram measurements. If not, our conversion chart can help translate volume to weight."
faqQ4: "Why does my air fryer recipe taste different with ketchup?"
faqA4: "Air fryers concentrate flavours, so 0.5 tbsp (7.5g) may taste stronger than in oven cooking. Start with less and adjust. Also, brands vary in sweetness and thickness, affecting results. Weighing ensures consistency across batches."

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on even cooking, and incorrect measurements can throw off textures and flavours. Too much ketchup might make your dish soggy, while too little could leave it bland. Using grams instead of tablespoons removes guesswork, especially with sticky ingredients like tomato ketchup. If you’re meal prepping or scaling recipes, grams provide uniformity.

<p>Tomato ketchup’s density means volume measurements like tablespoons can vary slightly. Grams eliminate this inconsistency, making them ideal for air fryer cooking. Whether you’re coating chicken wings or mixing a marinade, 0.5 tbsp (7.5g) of ketchup ensures the right balance. For sticky ingredients, a digital kitchen scale is a game-changer.</p>  

<h3>How to measure 0.5 tbsp of tomato ketchup without scales</h3>

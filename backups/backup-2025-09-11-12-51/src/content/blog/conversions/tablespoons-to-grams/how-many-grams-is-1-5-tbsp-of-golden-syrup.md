faqQ1: "Can I use honey instead of golden syrup in air fryer recipes?"
faqA1: "Yes, you can substitute honey for golden syrup, but be aware that honey is slightly thicker and sweeter. Use about 10% less honey by weight (around 28g instead of 31g for 1.5 tbsp golden syrup). The cooking time may need slight adjustment as honey caramelises faster."
faqQ2: "Why does golden syrup weight vary by temperature?"
faqA2: "Golden syrup becomes less dense when warm, so a heated tablespoon may hold slightly less by weight. For accuracy, measure at room temperature. If your syrup’s been stored in a cold place, let it sit out for 30 minutes before measuring for air fryer recipes."
faqQ3: "How do I clean golden syrup from my air fryer basket?"
faqA3: "Soak the basket in warm, soapy water to loosen sticky residue. Avoid abrasive scrubbers—use a soft sponge or nylon brush. For stubborn spots, make a paste of baking soda and water. Always dry thoroughly before next use to prevent rusting."
faqQ4: "Is golden syrup healthier than sugar in air fryer cooking?"
faqA4: "Golden syrup contains similar calories to sugar but has a lower GI index, causing slower blood sugar rises. However, it’s still high in sugars, so use sparingly. Its liquid form distributes sweetness more evenly in air fryer recipes compared to granulated sugar."

<p>1.5 tablespoons (tbsp) of golden syrup equals approximately 31 grams (g). This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements can make all the difference. Whether you're baking a cake or glazing meats, knowing the exact weight ensures consistent results. Golden syrup’s thick, sticky consistency means volume measurements can vary, so grams are far more reliable.

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>
<p>Air fryers rely on even heat distribution, so ingredient proportions must be spot-on. Too much golden syrup can lead to overly sticky or burnt results, while too little might leave dishes lacking flavour. Recipes from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> often use grams for precision, especially in baking. Measuring by weight also saves time—no need to level off tablespoons or worry about packing.

<p>Golden syrup’s density means 1.5 tbsp won’t always weigh the same as other liquids. Factors like temperature and how you fill the spoon can affect volume measurements. That’s why professional chefs and home cooks alike prefer weighing ingredients. For sticky substances like golden syrup, lightly greasing your measuring spoon helps it slide off easily. This trick is handy when prepping <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>desserts</a> in your air fryer.</p>

<h2>How to convert 1.5 tbsp golden syrup to grams</h2>
<p>The simplest method is using digital kitchen scales for accuracy. Place your mixing bowl on the scale, tare it to zero, then add golden syrup until it reads 31g. If you don’t have scales, remember that 1 tbsp of golden syrup is roughly 20.5g, so 1.5 tbsp totals about 31g. This conversion works for UK tablespoons, which differ slightly from US measurements.

<h3>Common uses for golden syrup in air fryer recipes</h3>
<p>Golden syrup adds moisture and caramelised sweetness to air-fried goods. It’s perfect for glazing ham, baking flapjacks, or making sticky toffee pudding.

<h2>Tips for working with golden syrup</h2>
<p>Warm your spoon in hot water before scooping golden syrup—it’ll slide off more easily. Store opened tins in a cool, dry place to prevent crystallisation. If your syrup hardens, gently warm the tin in hot water to restore its pourable consistency. Always measure over a bowl to catch drips, and wipe the spoon clean between uses. For sticky messes, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner guide</a> has handy tips.</p>

<p>When substituting golden syrup in recipes, note that honey or maple syrup have different weights per tablespoon. This affects air fryer cooking times and textures, so adjust accordingly. For savoury dishes needing a touch of sweetness, golden syrup works wonders in marinades too. Its distinct butterscotch flavour enhances everything from roasted vegetables to glazed chicken wings.</p>

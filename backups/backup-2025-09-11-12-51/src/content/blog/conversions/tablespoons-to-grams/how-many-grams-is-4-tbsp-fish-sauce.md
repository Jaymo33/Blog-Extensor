faqQ1: "Can I use 4 tbsp of fish sauce interchangeably with 60g in recipes?"
faqA1: "Yes, 4 tbsp of fish sauce equals roughly 60g, so you can use them interchangeably in most recipes. However, for baking or precise dishes, weighing is more accurate since tablespoon measurements can vary slightly."
faqQ2: "Does the brand of fish sauce affect the weight per tablespoon?"
faqA2: "Most fish sauces have a similar density, so 4 tbsp will still be close to 60g across brands. However, thicker or artisanal sauces might weigh slightly more. When in doubt, check the label or weigh it yourself."
faqQ3: "How do I reduce the saltiness if I’ve added too much fish sauce?"
faqA3: "Balance excess fish sauce with a squeeze of lime or lemon juice, a bit of sugar, or coconut milk. Diluting it with water or broth can also help. In air fryer recipes, pairing it with starchy ingredients like potatoes can absorb some saltiness."
faqQ4: "Can I substitute fish sauce with soy sauce in air fryer recipes?"
faqA4: "Soy sauce can work as a substitute, but it lacks the umami depth of fish sauce. For a closer match, mix soy sauce with a pinch of anchovy paste or Worcestershire sauce. Adjust quantities since soy sauce is less potent."

<p>4 tablespoons (tbsp) of fish sauce weigh approximately 60 grams (g). This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements can make or break a dish. Whether you’re marinating chicken, seasoning seafood, or adding depth to a stir-fry, knowing the exact weight ensures consistency. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we focus on accuracy to help you achieve restaurant-quality results at home.</p>  

<h2>Why converting fish sauce from tbsp to grams matters</h2>  
<p>Fish sauce is a staple in many cuisines, especially in Thai and Vietnamese dishes. Its strong, umami-rich flavour means even small variations can alter the taste of your meal. Converting 4 tbsp of fish sauce to grams (60g) ensures you don’t over or under-season. This is particularly important in air fryer cooking, where flavours intensify due to the high heat and rapid circulation.

<p>Using grams instead of tablespoons also eliminates inconsistencies caused by how the sauce is poured or levelled. A heaped tablespoon, for example, could add extra grams unintentionally. By weighing your fish sauce, you guarantee precision, which is especially useful for meal prepping or scaling recipes.

<h2>How to measure fish sauce accurately</h2>  
<p>To measure 4 tbsp of fish sauce in grams, use a digital kitchen scale for the best accuracy. Place your mixing bowl or container on the scale, tare it to zero, then pour the fish sauce until it reaches 60g. If you don’t have a scale, use standard measuring spoons and level them off with a knife. Remember, fish sauce is dense, so 4 tbsp will always be close to 60g, but slight variations can occur.</p>  

<h3>Common mistakes when measuring fish sauce</h3>  
<p>One mistake is assuming all tablespoons are equal. In the UK, a tablespoon is 15ml, but in some countries, it may differ. Always use metric measurements for consistency. Another error is not accounting for the sauce’s viscosity—fish sauce pours slowly, so rushing can lead to under-measuring.

<h2>Using fish sauce in air fryer recipes</h2>  
<p>Fish sauce adds depth to marinades, glazes, and dipping sauces. In the air fryer, it works beautifully with proteins like chicken, shrimp, or tofu. For example, a marinade with 4 tbsp (60g) of fish sauce, lime juice, and garlic creates a tangy, savoury coating that crisps up perfectly.

<p>Since air fryers cook food faster than conventional ovens, the concentrated heat enhances the fish sauce’s umami notes. Just be mindful of salt content—fish sauce is salty, so balance it with sweetness or acidity.

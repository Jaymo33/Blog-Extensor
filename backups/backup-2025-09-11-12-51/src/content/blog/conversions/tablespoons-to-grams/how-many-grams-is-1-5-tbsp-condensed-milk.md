faqQ1: "Can I use a regular spoon to measure 1.5 tbsp of condensed milk?"
faqA1: "While a regular spoon can work in a pinch, it’s best to use a proper measuring tablespoon for accuracy. Household spoons vary in size, which could affect your recipe. For precise results, weigh 30 grams on a scale or use a levelled tablespoon."
faqQ2: "Does the brand of condensed milk affect the weight per tablespoon?"
faqA2: "Most brands of condensed milk have a similar density, so 1.5 tbsp should still be around 30 grams. However, thicker or premium varieties might vary slightly. If in doubt, check the label or weigh it for certainty."
faqQ3: "How do I store leftover condensed milk after measuring?"
faqA3: "Transfer any unused condensed milk to an airtight container and refrigerate. It’ll keep for up to two weeks. For longer storage, freeze it in portions—thaw before using in your next air fryer recipe."
faqQ4: "Can I substitute evaporated milk for condensed milk in air fryer recipes?"
faqA4: "Evaporated milk isn’t a direct substitute due to its lack of sweetness. If swapping, adjust sugar levels accordingly. For best results, stick to condensed milk unless the recipe specifies otherwise."

faqQ1: "Can I use sweetened condensed milk instead of regular condensed milk in air fryer recipes?"
faqA1: "Yes, sweetened condensed milk works well in most recipes calling for regular condensed milk. Just be mindful of the extra sugar, which may affect browning and texture in the air fryer. Adjust cooking times slightly if needed."
faqQ2: "How do I convert grams to tablespoons for other ingredients?"
faqA2: "Conversion depends on the ingredient’s density. For liquids like milk or oil, 1 tablespoon is roughly 15 grams. For thicker substances like peanut butter, it’s closer to 20 grams. Always check a reliable conversion chart for accuracy."
faqQ3: "Why does my air fryer recipe turn out too sweet with condensed milk?"
faqA3: "Condensed milk is very sweet, so using too much can overpower other flavours. Stick to the recommended 2 tbsp (40g) and balance it with acidic or bitter ingredients. Reducing sugar elsewhere in the recipe can also help."
faqQ4: "Can I make my own condensed milk for air fryer recipes?"
faqA4: "Yes! Simmer milk and sugar until reduced by half. Homemade condensed milk may be slightly thinner, so adjust measurements accordingly. Store-bought versions are more consistent for air fryer cooking."

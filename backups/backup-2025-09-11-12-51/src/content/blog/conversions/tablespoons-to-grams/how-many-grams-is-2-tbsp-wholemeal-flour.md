faqQ1: "Can I use white flour instead of wholemeal flour in air fryer recipes?"
faqA1: "Yes, but adjust the quantity slightly. White flour is less dense, so 2 tbsp weighs about 15 grams instead of 16 grams for wholemeal. You may need to reduce liquid in the recipe slightly, as wholemeal flour absorbs more moisture."
faqQ2: "Why does my air fryer coating turn out too dry with wholemeal flour?"
faqA2: "Wholemeal flour absorbs more oil and liquid than white flour. Try lightly spraying your food with oil before air frying, or mix wholemeal flour with breadcrumbs for a crispier, less dense coating."
faqQ3: "How do I store wholemeal flour for air fryer recipes?"
faqA3: "Keep it in an airtight container in a cool, dark place to prevent rancidity. Wholemeal flour has a shorter shelf life than white flour due to its higher oil content. For long-term storage, freeze it."
faqQ4: "Can I substitute almond flour for wholemeal flour in air fryer baking?"
faqA4: "Almond flour behaves differently, so it’s not a direct swap. Use 1.5 tbsp almond flour (about 12g) for every 2 tbsp wholemeal flour, and expect a denser, moister result. Adjust cooking times in the air fryer accordingly."

<p>2 tablespoons (tbsp) of wholemeal flour weigh approximately 16 grams (g). This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precision matters, especially when baking or coating ingredients. Wholemeal flour, being denser than white flour, requires accurate measuring to avoid dry or dense results. If you’re using an air fryer for baking, this measurement ensures your recipes turn out perfectly every time.

<h2>Why Accurate Flour Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Using the correct amount of wholemeal flour is crucial for air fryer cooking. Too much flour can make batters thick or coatings clumpy, while too little may result in soggy or unevenly cooked food. Wholemeal flour, with its higher fibre content, absorbs more liquid than refined flour, so precision is key. Whether you’re making air-fried breaded chicken or wholesome muffins, knowing that 2 tbsp of wholemeal flour equals 16 grams ensures consistency.

<p>Many UK bakers prefer weighing ingredients for accuracy, as tablespoon measurements can vary slightly. A kitchen scale removes guesswork, especially when adapting recipes for air fryers. If you don’t have one, remember that 2 tbsp of wholemeal flour is roughly 16 grams.

<h3>How to Measure Wholemeal Flour Without a Scale</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a scale, spoon the flour into the tablespoon and level it off with a knife for accuracy. Avoid scooping directly from the bag, as this compacts the flour and leads to over-measuring. For 2 tbsp of wholemeal flour, lightly fill two tablespoons and level them—this should give you close to 16 grams. This method works well for air fryer coatings or batters where slight variations won’t ruin the dish.</p>  

<h2>Converting Other Flour Amounts</h2>  
<p>Need to convert larger quantities? Here’s a quick reference: 4 tbsp of wholemeal flour equals 32 grams, while 8 tbsp (½ cup) is around 64 grams. These conversions are handy for scaling up air fryer recipes like bread or pastry. Wholemeal flour’s nutty flavour works brilliantly in air-fried goods, from savoury coatings to sweet treats.

<p>Remember that different brands of wholemeal flour may vary slightly in density. If precision is critical, like in gluten-free baking, always weigh your flour. For general air fryer cooking, the 2 tbsp = 16 grams rule is reliable.

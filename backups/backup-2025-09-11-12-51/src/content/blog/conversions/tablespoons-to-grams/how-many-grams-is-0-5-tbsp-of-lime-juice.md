faqQ1: "Does bottled lime juice weigh the same as fresh lime juice?"
faqA1: "Yes, bottled and fresh lime juice have nearly identical weights per tablespoon. Both measure approximately 15 grams per tbsp, so 0.5 tbsp would be about 7.5 grams either way. However, fresh lime juice may vary slightly in acidity, which could affect flavour more than weight."
faqQ2: "Can I use this conversion for other citrus juices?"
faqA2: "While lemon juice is very similar (about 15g per tbsp), other citrus juices like orange or grapefruit have slightly different densities. For precise measurements, it's best to check specific conversions for each juice type when substituting in recipes calling for 0.5 tbsp lime juice."
faqQ3: "Why do air fryer recipes often use small amounts like 0.5 tbsp?"
faqA3: "Air fryers concentrate flavours during cooking, so recipes typically use less liquid than conventional oven recipes. The 0.5 tbsp (7.5g) measurement prevents over-saturation while still providing enough acidity for marinades or dressings to work effectively in the air fryer's rapid cooking environment."
faqQ4: "How can I measure 0.5 tbsp without special spoons?"
faqA4: "If you don't have a 0.5 tbsp measure, use 1.5 teaspoons (as 1 tbsp = 3 tsp). Alternatively, weigh out 7.5 grams on a kitchen scale. For small amounts like this, investing in a set of measuring spoons that includes half tablespoons makes air fryer recipe preparation much easier."

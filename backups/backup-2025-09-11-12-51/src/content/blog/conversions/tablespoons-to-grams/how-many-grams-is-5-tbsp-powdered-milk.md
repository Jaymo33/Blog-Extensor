faqQ1: "Can I use liquid milk instead of powdered milk in air fryer recipes?"
faqA1: "Yes, but you’ll need to adjust the recipe. Generally, 1 tablespoon of powdered milk mixed with 4 tablespoons of water equals 5 tablespoons of liquid milk. Keep in mind that liquid milk may alter cooking times slightly in the air fryer."
faqQ2: "Why does powdered milk weight vary between brands?"
faqA2: "Different brands may have varying densities due to processing methods or added ingredients. Always check the packaging for specific weight guidelines. For consistency, stick to one brand when measuring for recipes."
faqQ3: "How do I convert grams back to tablespoons if I don’t have a scale?"
faqA3: "A rough estimate is 7 grams per tablespoon of powdered milk. So, 35 grams would be about 5 tablespoons. For precise baking, though, a scale is recommended."
faqQ4: "Can I use powdered milk in vegan air fryer recipes?"
faqA4: "Traditional powdered milk is dairy-based, but plant-based alternatives (like coconut or soy powder) work similarly. Adjust measurements as needed, as these may have different weights per tablespoon."

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter</h2>  
<p>Using the correct amount of powdered milk can make or break a recipe. Too much can make dishes overly dense, while too little might leave them lacking flavour. Air fryer recipes, in particular, rely on precise measurements for even cooking. If you're new to air frying, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for other handy measurements. Powdered milk is a staple in many kitchens, so getting the grams right saves time and hassle.</p>  

<p>Powdered milk is often used in baking, sauces, and even homemade bread. Measuring by weight (grams) is more accurate than volume (tablespoons) because density can vary. For example, sifted powdered milk will weigh less per tablespoon than compacted powder. If you're prepping meals in advance, accurate measurements ensure every portion tastes just right.

<h3>How to measure powdered milk correctly</h3>  
<p>For the most accurate results, use a digital kitchen scale. Spoon the powdered milk into the tablespoon without packing it down, then level it off with a knife. This method prevents over-measuring and ensures consistency. If you don’t have a scale, remember that 1 tablespoon of powdered milk is roughly 7 grams, so 5 tbsp equals about 35 grams.

<h2>Common uses for powdered milk in air fryer recipes</h2>  
<p>Powdered milk is a versatile ingredient that works well in air fryer recipes. It’s often used in breading mixtures for crispy chicken or fish, adding a subtle creaminess.

<p>Another great use is in homemade seasoning blends. Combine powdered milk with herbs and spices for a flavourful coating on meats or veggies.

<h3>Tips for storing powdered milk</h3>  
<p>To keep powdered milk fresh, store it in an airtight container in a cool, dry place. Exposure to moisture can cause clumping, which affects measurement accuracy. If you use it infrequently, consider labelling the container with the conversion (e.g., "1 tbsp = 7g") for quick reference. Proper storage ensures your powdered milk stays usable for months, ready for your next air fryer adventure.</p>

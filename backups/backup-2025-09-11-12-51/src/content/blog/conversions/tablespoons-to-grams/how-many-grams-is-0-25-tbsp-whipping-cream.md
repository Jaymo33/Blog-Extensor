faqQ1: "Can I use milk instead of 0.25 tbsp whipping cream in air fryer recipes?"
faqA1: "Yes, but milk has less fat, so your dish may be less rich. For 0.25 tbsp (3.75g) of whipping cream, substitute with 0.25 tbsp whole milk plus a pinch of butter for similar texture."
faqQ2: "Why does my air fryer recipe specify 0.25 tbsp whipping cream?"
faqA2: "Small amounts like 0.25 tbsp (3.75g) add moisture without making batters too heavy. In air fryers, precise fat content helps with browning and crispiness, especially in cakes or glazes."
faqQ3: "How do I measure 0.25 tbsp whipping cream if I don’t have a ¼ tbsp spoon?"
faqA3: "Use a 1 tbsp measure and fill it to one-quarter full. Alternatively, use ¾ teaspoon, as 1 tbsp = 3 tsp. For accuracy, a scale is best."
faqQ4: "Does 0.25 tbsp whipping cream change weight when whipped?"
faqA4: "No, 3.75g remains the same, but volume increases. For air fryer recipes, measure before whipping unless specified otherwise. Whipped cream incorporates air, altering texture but not weight."

<p>Many <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> call for small amounts of whipping cream, especially in desserts or glazes.

<h2>How to measure 0.25 tbsp of whipping cream without scales</h2>

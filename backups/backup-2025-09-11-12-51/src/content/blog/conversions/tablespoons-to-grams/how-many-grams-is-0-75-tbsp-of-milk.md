faqQ1: "Can I use plant-based milk instead of regular milk for this conversion?"
faqA1: "Yes, you can use plant-based milk like almond or oat milk, but the weight may vary slightly. Generally, 0.75 tbsp of plant-based milk is close to 11 grams, but check the packaging for exact density if precision is crucial for your recipe."
faqQ2: "Why is it important to measure milk in grams for air fryer recipes?"
faqA2: "Measuring milk in grams ensures consistency, especially in air fryer cooking where small quantities matter. Unlike volume measurements, weight (grams) isn’t affected by factors like air bubbles or settling, giving you reliable results every time."
faqQ3: "How do I measure 0.75 tbsp of milk if I don’t have a tablespoon?"
faqA3: "You can use a teaspoon—0.75 tbsp equals 2.25 teaspoons. Alternatively, use a kitchen scale to weigh out 11.25 grams. For liquids, a measuring jug with millilitre markings also works (0.75 tbsp ≈ 11.1 ml)."
faqQ4: "Does the fat content of milk affect the weight in grams?"
faqA4: "The fat content (whole, semi-skimmed, or skimmed) has a minimal impact on weight. 0.75 tbsp of any milk type will still be roughly 11.25 grams. However, richer milks may slightly alter texture in recipes like cakes or sauces."

<p>4 tablespoons (tbsp) of maple syrup equals approximately 80 grams (g). This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements can make or break your dish. Whether you’re drizzling it over air-fried pancakes or using it as a glaze for salmon, knowing the exact weight ensures consistency. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we focus on helping you get the measurements spot-on for flawless results every time.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on even heat distribution, and incorrect ingredient quantities can throw off cooking times and textures. Maple syrup, being a liquid sweetener, affects moisture levels and caramelisation. Too much can make food soggy, while too little might leave it bland. For perfect air-fryer desserts like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>cakes or cookies</a>, 80g of maple syrup per 4 tbsp is the golden rule. Check our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for other common ingredient swaps.</p>  

<h3>How to measure maple syrup correctly</h3>  
<p>Use a flat-edged utensil to level off tablespoons for accuracy. For sticky syrups like maple, lightly greasing the spoon helps it slide off easily. A digital kitchen scale is ideal for confirming the 80g weight, especially when scaling recipes up or down. If you’re prepping <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>desserts</a>, this precision ensures your treats are never too sweet or dry.</p>

<h3>Substitutes for maple syrup in air fryer dishes</h3>

For sugar-free options, monk fruit syrup or erythritol blends are alternatives, though they won’t caramelise the same way.

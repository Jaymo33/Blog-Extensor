faqQ1: "Is 2 tbsp of cornflour the same in the US and UK?"
faqA1: "No, UK and US tablespoons differ slightly. A UK tablespoon holds 8 grams of cornflour, while a US tablespoon is about 7.5 grams. For air fryer recipes, this small difference can affect crispiness, so always check the recipe’s origin."
faqQ2: "Can I substitute plain flour for cornflour in air fryer recipes?"
faqA2: "You can, but results will vary. Cornflour creates a lighter, crispier coating than plain flour. If substituting, use 25% less plain flour (about 12g instead of 16g for 2 tbsp) to avoid density. For gluten-free options, stick with cornflour."
faqQ3: "Why does my air fryer cornflour coating turn out powdery?"
faqA3: "This usually happens when too much cornflour is used or it isn’t properly mixed with wet ingredients. For 2 tbsp (16g) of cornflour, pair it with 1 beaten egg or buttermilk to create an adhesive base before air frying."
faqQ4: "How should I store opened cornflour for air fryer cooking?"
faqA4: "Keep cornflour in an airtight container in a cool, dry place. Moisture causes clumping, which affects measurements. Properly stored, it lasts 6-12 months. Always stir before measuring 2 tbsp portions to ensure consistent results in air fryer recipes."

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air frying</h2>  
<p>Using the correct amount of cornflour can make or break your air fryer dishes. Too little, and your coating won’t crisp up; too much, and it may turn powdery. For example, when making air-fried chicken, 16 grams (2 tbsp) of cornflour per serving creates the perfect golden crust.

<p>Cornflour is also a key ingredient in gluten-free air fryer baking. If a recipe calls for 2 tbsp cornflour to grams, measuring by weight ensures consistency.

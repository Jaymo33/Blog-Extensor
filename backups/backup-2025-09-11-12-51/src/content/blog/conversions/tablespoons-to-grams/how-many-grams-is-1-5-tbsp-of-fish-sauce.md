faqQ1: "Can I use a teaspoon to measure 1.5 tbsp of fish sauce?"
faqA1: "Yes, you can use teaspoons to measure 1.5 tbsp of fish sauce. Since 1 tablespoon equals 3 teaspoons, 1.5 tbsp would be 4.5 teaspoons. However, for the most accurate measurement (22.5g), a digital scale is recommended, especially for air fryer recipes where precision matters."
faqQ2: "Does the brand of fish sauce affect the weight in grams?"
faqA2: "Different brands of fish sauce can vary slightly in density, but the difference is minimal for home cooking purposes. Most fish sauces will weigh approximately 15g per tablespoon, making 1.5 tbsp about 22.5g. For consistent results in air fryer recipes, stick to the same brand when possible."
faqQ3: "How can I substitute fish sauce in air fryer recipes if I don't have any?"
faqA3: "If you're out of fish sauce, you can use soy sauce mixed with a pinch of sugar as a substitute. For 1.5 tbsp (22.5g) of fish sauce, try 1 tbsp soy sauce plus Â½ tsp sugar. Keep in mind this will alter the flavour profile of your air fryer dish slightly."
faqQ4: "Why is measuring fish sauce in grams better for air fryer cooking?"
faqA4: "Measuring fish sauce in grams (like 22.5g for 1.5 tbsp) is more precise than volume measurements. Air fryers cook food quickly, so balanced flavours are crucial. Grams eliminate inconsistencies from how the sauce fills the spoon, ensuring your marinades and glazes taste perfect every time."

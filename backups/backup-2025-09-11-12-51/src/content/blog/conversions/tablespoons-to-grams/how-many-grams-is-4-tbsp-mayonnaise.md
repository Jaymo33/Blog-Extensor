faqQ1: "Does the type of mayonnaise affect the weight of 4 tbsp?"
faqA1: "Yes, but only slightly. Full-fat, light, and vegan mayonnaises have similar densities, so 4 tbsp will still weigh around 60g. However, thicker brands or homemade mayo might vary by a few grams. For precision, weigh your preferred brand once to confirm."
faqQ2: "Can I use 4 tbsp of mayonnaise straight from the fridge in air fryer recipes?"
faqA2: "Cold mayonnaise can be harder to mix evenly. For coatings or batters, let 4 tbsp (60g) sit at room temperature for 10 minutes first. This ensures smoother blending and consistent cooking in your air fryer."
faqQ3: "How do I convert 4 tbsp of mayonnaise to cups?"
faqA3: "4 tbsp equals ¼ cup of mayonnaise. If your recipe uses cups, this conversion saves time. For air fryer recipes, sticking to grams (60g) is more accurate, especially for smaller quantities."
faqQ4: "Is 4 tbsp of mayonnaise too much for one serving in the air fryer?"
faqA4: "It depends on the recipe. For coatings or marinades, 4 tbsp (60g) typically covers 2–4 servings. If using mayo as a base for dips, adjust to taste. Always balance richness with other ingredients for the best texture."

<h3>How to measure mayonnaise without scales</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have scales, use the spoon-and-level method for accuracy. Fill your tablespoon evenly without packing the mayonnaise down, then level it off with a knife.

faqQ1: "Is 5 tbsp of granulated sugar the same as 5 tbsp of caster sugar in grams?"
faqA1: "No, caster sugar is slightly finer, so 5 tbsp weighs about 56g compared to granulated sugar’s 62.5g. The difference matters in delicate bakes where texture is key. Always check specific conversions for best results in air fryer recipes."
faqQ2: "Can I use brown sugar instead of granulated for the same weight?"
faqA2: "Brown sugar is denser due to moisture, so 5 tbsp weighs roughly 75g. You’ll need to reduce the quantity to match granulated sugar’s 62.5g. Brown sugar also adds moisture, which may affect air fryer cooking times."
faqQ3: "Why does my air fryer recipe taste too sweet with 5 tbsp sugar?"
faqA3: "Air fryers intensify flavours as they cook quickly and circulate heat efficiently. Try reducing sugar by 1-2 tbsp (12.5-25g) for balanced sweetness. Also, ensure you’re using level tablespoons, not heaped."
faqQ4: "How do I convert US tablespoons to UK grams for sugar?"
faqA4: "US tablespoons are 14.8ml vs UK’s 15ml, but the difference is minimal. For granulated sugar, 5 US tbsp ≈ 60g. For precision in air fryer recipes, we recommend sticking to weight measurements in grams."

<p>5 tablespoons (tbsp) of granulated sugar equals approximately 62.5 grams (g) in UK measurements. This conversion is essential for precise baking or cooking, especially when using an air fryer where ingredient accuracy can affect texture and browning. Whether you’re whipping up a cake or caramelising a dessert, knowing this measurement ensures consistency.</p>

<h2>Why accurate sugar measurements matter in air fryer recipes</h2>  
<p>Granulated sugar plays a crucial role in air fryer recipes, from crispy coatings to caramelised finishes. Too much sugar can cause burning, while too little may leave dishes bland. For example, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer dessert recipes</a> rely on precise sugar quantities for perfect results. Measuring by weight (grams) is more reliable than volume (tablespoons) due to variations in scooping methods.</p>  

<p>Many UK bakers prefer grams for consistency, especially when adapting recipes from international sources. If you’re using an <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>, gram measurements eliminate guesswork. This precision is particularly helpful for recipes like meringues or sugar-glazed treats, where even small deviations can alter outcomes.</p>  

<h3>How to measure 5 tbsp of granulated sugar without scales</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have kitchen scales, use the spoon-and-level method for accuracy. Fill your tablespoon lightly without packing the sugar, then level it off with a knife. Repeat five times to reach 62.5g. Avoid tapping or compacting the sugar, as this adds extra weight. For sticky ingredients, consider using <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner</a> to maintain your tools.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for 5 tbsp granulated sugar in air frying</h2>  
<p>This quantity is ideal for glazes, rubs, or sweet coatings in air fryer cooking. Try it in our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>air fryer cake recipes</a> for balanced sweetness. It’s also perfect for candying nuts or creating crisp finishes on fruits like apples or pears. The air fryer’s rapid circulation ensures even sugar distribution, enhancing flavours without clumping.</p>  

<p>For savoury-sweet dishes, 5 tbsp (62.5g) of sugar can balance spices in rubs for meats or vegetables. Check our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>air fryer chicken recipes</a> for inspiration. Remember that sugar caramelises faster in air fryers than conventional ovens, so monitor cooking times closely to prevent burning.</p>  

<h3>Converting other sugar quantities to grams</h3>  
<p>If your recipe calls for different amounts, here’s a quick reference: 1 tbsp granulated sugar = 12.5g, 10 tbsp = 125g. These conversions apply to UK standard tablespoons (15ml). For caster or icing sugar, weights differ slightly due to grain size. Always verify measurements when trying new recipes, especially for delicate air fryer bakes.</p>

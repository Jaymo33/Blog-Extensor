faqQ1: "Can I use evaporated milk instead of condensed milk in air fryer recipes?"
faqA1: "No, evaporated milk lacks the sweetness and thickness of condensed milk. If substituting, mix evaporated milk with sugar (2:1 ratio) to mimic condensed milk’s consistency. However, this may slightly alter cooking times in your air fryer."
faqQ2: "How do I store leftover condensed milk after measuring 5 tbsp?"
faqA2: "Transfer any unused condensed milk to an airtight container and refrigerate. It lasts up to two weeks. For longer storage, freeze it in portioned cubes—thaw before using in future <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a>."
faqQ3: "Why does my air fryer recipe with condensed milk turn out too sweet?"
faqA3: "Condensed milk is intensely sweet, so always measure precisely. If your dish is overly sweet, balance it with a tart ingredient like lemon zest or reduce the quantity slightly. Check our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert category</a> for balanced recipes."
faqQ4: "Can I measure condensed milk in millilitres instead of grams?"
faqA4: "Yes, but ml measures volume, not weight. Since condensed milk is dense, 5 tbsp (75ml) equals roughly 75 grams. For accuracy, especially in air fryer baking, weighing ingredients is best.

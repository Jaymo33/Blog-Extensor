faqQ1: "How many grams are in 1 tablespoon of porridge oats in the UK?"
faqA1: "In the UK, 1 tablespoon (tbsp) of porridge oats weighs approximately 8 grams. This measurement is standard for lightly packed, level tablespoons. For precise cooking, especially in air fryers, using a kitchen scale is recommended."
faqQ2: "Can I use a teaspoon to measure porridge oats instead of a tablespoon?"
faqA2: "Yes, you can use a teaspoon, but you’ll need to adjust the amount. 1 teaspoon (tsp) of porridge oats is roughly 2.7 grams. For recipes requiring 1 tbsp (8 grams), you’d need about 3 teaspoons. A tablespoon is more efficient for larger quantities."
faqQ3: "Does the type of porridge oats affect the weight per tablespoon?"
faqA3: "The weight can vary slightly depending on the oat type (rolled, jumbo, or instant) and how they’re packed. However, 1 tbsp of any porridge oats typically weighs around 8 grams when measured lightly and leveled off. For consistency, stick to one type per recipe."
faqQ4: "Why is it important to measure porridge oats accurately in an air fryer?"
faqA4: "Air fryers cook quickly and evenly, so precise measurements ensure your recipes turn out perfectly. Too many oats can lead to dry or unevenly cooked dishes, while too few may result in a lack of texture. Accurate grams per tablespoon help maintain balance."

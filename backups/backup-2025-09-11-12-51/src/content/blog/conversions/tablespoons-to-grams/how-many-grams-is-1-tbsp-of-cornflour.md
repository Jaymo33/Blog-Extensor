faqQ1: "Can I use plain flour instead of cornflour in my air fryer?"
faqA1: "Yes, but plain flour is heavier—1 tbsp weighs about 7.5 grams, slightly less than cornflour. It also browns differently, so adjust cooking times. For crispier results, stick with cornflour."
faqQ2: "Why does my air fryer coating turn out soggy?"
faqA2: "Sogginess often comes from overcrowding or too much oil. Use 1 tbsp (8 grams) of cornflour per serving, and shake the basket halfway for even cooking."
faqQ3: "How do I convert US tablespoons to UK grams for cornflour?"
faqA3: "A US tablespoon holds 9 grams of cornflour, while a UK tablespoon is 8 grams. Always check your recipe’s origin or use a scale for accuracy."
faqQ4: "Can I substitute cornflour for baking powder in air fryer recipes?"
faqA4: "No, they serve different purposes. Cornflour is a thickener, while baking powder is a leavener. Swapping them will ruin texture—stick to the recipe’s specified grams."

<p>1 tablespoon (tbsp) of cornflour weighs approximately 8 grams in the UK. This measurement is essential for air fryer recipes where precision ensures perfect texture and crispiness. Whether you’re coating chicken or thickening sauces, knowing the exact grams in 1 tbsp of cornflour makes all the difference.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate cornflour measurements matter</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of cornflour is crucial for air fryer cooking. Too little, and your coatings won’t crisp up; too much, and they can turn chalky. For example, a <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>chicken recipe</a> might call for 2 tbsp of cornflour—that’s 16 grams. Precise measurements ensure consistent results every time.</p>  

<p>Cornflour is a staple in many air fryer recipes, from crispy tofu to golden fish fillets. If you’re converting from volume (tbsp) to weight (grams), always use a kitchen scale for accuracy. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more handy measurement tips.</p>  

<h3>How to measure 1 tbsp of cornflour correctly</h3>  
<p>To measure 1 tbsp of cornflour accurately, spoon it lightly into the tablespoon and level it off with a knife. Don’t pack it down, as this can add extra grams. For best results, weigh it on a digital scale—8 grams is the magic number for UK tablespoons.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for cornflour in air fryers</h2>  
<p>Cornflour is a game-changer for air fryer cooking. It helps create ultra-crispy coatings on foods like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken wings</a> or tempura vegetables. Since air fryers circulate hot air, the light texture of cornflour ensures even browning without sogginess.</p>  

<p>You can also use cornflour to thicken sauces or bind ingredients in air fryer recipes. For instance, adding 1 tbsp (8 grams) to a marinade helps it cling better to meat. Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a> for creative ways to use cornflour in your air fryer.</p>  

<h3>Cornflour vs. other thickeners in air fryer cooking</h3>  
<p>Cornflour is finer than plain flour, making it ideal for air fryer coatings. Unlike breadcrumbs, it doesn’t absorb as much oil, so your food stays lighter. If you’re out of cornflour, arrowroot or potato starch can work, but adjust the grams accordingly.</p>  

<h2>Tips for storing and using cornflour</h2>  
<p>Keep cornflour in an airtight container to prevent clumping. Humidity can affect its weight, so always measure it just before use. For sticky air fryer baskets, a light dusting of cornflour prevents food from sticking—just wipe it clean afterward with our recommended <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner</a>.</p>  

<p>If you’re scaling up a recipe, remember that 4 tbsp of cornflour equals 32 grams. This is handy for batch cooking or meal prep. For more air fryer hacks, browse our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>homepage</a> for the latest tips and tricks.</p>

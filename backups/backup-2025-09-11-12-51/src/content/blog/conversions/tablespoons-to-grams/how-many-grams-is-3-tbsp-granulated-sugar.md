faqQ1: "Is 3 tbsp of granulated sugar the same as 3 tbsp of caster sugar in grams?"
faqA1: "No, 3 tablespoons of caster sugar weighs slightly less than granulated sugar—about 36 grams compared to 38 grams. Caster sugar has finer grains, so it packs less densely. Always check specific conversions if substituting sugars in a recipe."
faqQ2: "Can I use a kitchen scale instead of measuring spoons for sugar?"
faqA2: "Absolutely! A kitchen scale is the most accurate way to measure sugar, especially for baking. Simply set your scale to grams and weigh out 38 grams for 3 tablespoons of granulated sugar. This method eliminates packing inconsistencies."
faqQ3: "Why does my air-fried dessert sometimes burn when using sugar?"
faqA3: "Air fryers circulate hot air rapidly, which can cause sugar to caramelise or burn quickly. To prevent this, reduce the cooking time or temperature slightly when using sugary glazes or coatings. Always keep an eye on your dish during the last few minutes."
faqQ4: "How do I convert 3 tbsp of granulated sugar to cups?"
faqA4: "Three tablespoons of granulated sugar equal roughly 1/4 cup (or 0.1875 cups to be precise). However, for accuracy in baking, especially in air fryer recipes, weighing in grams is always best. Cups can vary based on how the sugar is packed."

<p>3 tablespoons of granulated sugar equals approximately 38 grams in the UK. This conversion is essential for precise baking, especially when using an air fryer where measurements can affect texture and browning. Whether you're whipping up cakes, cookies, or even glazes, knowing the exact weight ensures consistent results every time.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate sugar measurements matter</h2>  
<p>Granulated sugar plays a crucial role in baking, affecting texture, sweetness, and even browning. Too much or too little can throw off your recipe, especially in an air fryer where heat distribution is rapid. For example, a <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>cake recipe</a> with too much sugar might brown too quickly, while too little could leave it dense. That’s why converting tablespoons to grams is so important.</p>  

<p>Many UK recipes use grams for precision, but if you’re working from an older cookbook or an international source, you might need to convert tablespoons. A digital kitchen scale is your best friend here, but if you don’t have one, our conversion guide will help.

<h3>How to measure 3 tbsp of granulated sugar</h3>  
<p>To measure 3 tablespoons of granulated sugar accurately, use a standard UK tablespoon (15ml). Level off the sugar with a knife for precision. If you’re scaling a recipe up or down, remember that 1 tablespoon of granulated sugar is roughly 12.7 grams, so 3 tablespoons equal about 38 grams.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for 3 tbsp of granulated sugar</h2>  
<p>Three tablespoons of granulated sugar is a common measurement in many recipes. You might use it in a small batch of <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cookies>cookies</a>, a glaze for air-fried doughnuts, or even a quick caramel sauce for desserts. In an air fryer, sugar helps with caramelisation, so getting the amount right is key.</p>  

<p>For savoury dishes, a pinch of sugar can balance acidity in sauces or marinades. If you’re experimenting with air-fried <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken wings</a>, a sugar-based glaze can add a delicious sticky finish. Just remember to adjust cooking times slightly to avoid burning.</p>  

<h3>Converting other sugar types</h3>  
<p>While this guide focuses on granulated sugar, other types like caster or brown sugar have different weights. For instance, 3 tablespoons of caster sugar weigh slightly less due to finer grains. Always check a reliable conversion chart if you’re substituting sugars in a recipe.</p>  

<h2>Tips for measuring sugar in an air fryer</h2>  
<p>Air fryers cook faster than conventional ovens, so precise measurements are even more critical. Too much sugar can lead to over-browning or even smoking. If you’re adapting a traditional recipe for the air fryer, start with slightly less sugar and adjust to taste.</p>  

<p>For easy cleanup after sugary recipes, use our recommended <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner</a> to remove sticky residues. And if you’re scaling up recipes, remember that air fryer baskets have limited space—stick to smaller batches for even cooking.</p>

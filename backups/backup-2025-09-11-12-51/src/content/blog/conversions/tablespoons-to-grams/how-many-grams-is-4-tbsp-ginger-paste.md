faqQ1: "Can I use fresh ginger instead of ginger paste in my air fryer recipe?"
faqA1: "Yes, you can substitute fresh ginger for ginger paste. Use 1 tablespoon of grated fresh ginger for every 4 tablespoons of ginger paste. Fresh ginger has a brighter, sharper flavour, so adjust to taste."
faqQ2: "Does ginger paste weigh the same as other pastes, like garlic paste?"
faqA2: "No, different pastes have varying densities. Garlic paste, for example, is slightly heavier—4 tbsp would weigh around 68 grams. Always check specific conversions for each ingredient."
faqQ3: "How long does ginger paste last in the fridge?"
faqA3: "Homemade ginger paste lasts about 2-3 weeks in the fridge if stored in an airtight container. Store-bought paste may last longer due to preservatives—check the label for expiry dates."
faqQ4: "Can I freeze ginger paste for later use?"
faqA4: "Absolutely! Freeze ginger paste in ice cube trays for easy portioning. Once frozen, transfer the cubes to a freezer bag. They’ll keep for up to 6 months. Thaw before using in air fryer recipes."

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Using the correct amount of ginger paste can make or break your dish. Too little, and the flavour might be underwhelming; too much, and it could overpower other ingredients. Air fryers cook food quickly, so balanced flavours are crucial. Ginger paste adds a warm, spicy kick to dishes like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>air fryer chicken</a> or stir-fried vegetables. Measuring by weight (grams) is more reliable than volume (tablespoons) for consistency.</p>  

<p>If you're scaling a recipe up or down, converting 4 tbsp of ginger paste to grams ensures accuracy. This is especially useful for meal preppers who batch-cook in their air fryer. For more recipe ideas, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a>.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure Ginger Paste Correctly</h3>  
<p>To measure 4 tbsp of ginger paste accurately, use a flat-edged knife to level off the spoon. Packed ginger paste may weigh slightly more, so 60 grams is a safe estimate. If your recipe calls for grated ginger instead, note that fresh ginger weighs less per tablespoon. Always check whether your recipe specifies paste or fresh ginger to avoid mistakes.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for Ginger Paste in Air Fryer Recipes</h2>  
<p>Ginger paste is a versatile ingredient that works well in marinades, sauces, and glazes. Try it in <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>air fryer vegetable dishes</a> for an extra zing. It pairs beautifully with garlic, soy sauce, and honey for a quick stir-fry. Many Asian-inspired air fryer recipes rely on ginger paste for authentic flavour.</p>  

<p>You can also mix ginger paste into meat marinades for dishes like air fryer beef or lamb. The paste helps tenderise the meat while infusing it with flavour.

<h3>Converting Other Ginger Measurements</h3>

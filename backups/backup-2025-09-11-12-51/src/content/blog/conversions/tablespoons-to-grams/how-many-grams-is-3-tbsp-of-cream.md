faqQ1: "Does the type of cream affect the weight of 3 tablespoons?"
faqA1: "Yes, slightly. Double cream is denser than single cream, so 3 tbsp might weigh closer to 48 grams. Whipped cream, being aerated, could be lighter—around 40 grams. For precise baking, always weigh your cream."
faqQ2: "Can I use millilitres instead of grams for measuring cream?"
faqA2: "Absolutely! Since cream’s density is close to water, 3 tbsp (45ml) is roughly 45 grams. However, for thicker creams like clotted or mascarpone, weighing is more accurate."
faqQ3: "Why do air fryer recipes often use grams instead of tablespoons?"
faqA3: "Grams ensure consistency, especially important in air fryers where slight imbalances affect cooking. Tablespoons can vary based on how ingredients are packed, but grams provide uniform results every time."
faqQ4: "How do I convert grams back to tablespoons if my recipe uses weight?"
faqA4: "Divide the gram amount by 15 (since 1 tbsp ≈ 15g). For example, 30 grams of cream would be 2 tablespoons. For sticky ingredients, lightly grease the spoon for easier measuring."

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on even heat distribution, so ingredient ratios can make or break a dish. Too much cream might make a sauce too runny, while too little could leave it dry. Grams provide a more precise measurement than tablespoons, especially for dense ingredients like cream. If you're experimenting with new recipes, always weigh ingredients for consistency.

<p>Different types of cream (single, double, or whipped) have slight weight variations, but 3 tbsp generally hovers around 45 grams. For best results, use a digital kitchen scale—it’s a game-changer for air fryer cooking. Need inspiration?

<h3>How to measure cream without a scale</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a scale, use standard measuring spoons and level off the cream with a knife. Remember, 1 tbsp equals about 15 grams, so 3 tbsp will be close to 45 grams. For sticky ingredients, lightly grease the spoon first. Avoid packing the cream down, as this can skew the measurement.

<h2>Common cream conversions for air fryer recipes</h2>  
<p>Beyond 3 tbsp, here are other handy cream conversions: 1/4 cup is roughly 60 grams, and 1/2 cup is about 120 grams. These measurements are useful for scaling recipes up or down. Whether you're making a creamy pasta or a custard, precise grams ensure success. Looking for savoury ideas?

<h3>Tips for working with cream in air fryers</h3>  
<p>Cream can splatter in high heat, so use oven-safe containers or foil to shield delicate components. For sauces, warm the cream separately before adding it to the air fryer. This prevents curdling and ensures smooth results. Always preheat your air fryer for even cooking—especially when dairy is involved.</p>

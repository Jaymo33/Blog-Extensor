faqQ1: "Is 1 tbsp of maple syrup the same as 20g in all countries?"
faqA1: "In the UK, 1 tbsp of maple syrup is consistently around 20g due to standardised tablespoon measurements (15ml). However, US tablespoons are slightly larger (14.8ml vs 15ml), so the weight may vary by a gram or two. Always check your local standards if precision is crucial."
faqQ2: "Can I use honey instead of maple syrup in the same weight?"
faqA2: "While honey and maple syrup have similar densities (1 tbsp of honey is also roughly 20g), their flavours and moisture content differ. Honey is sweeter and thicker, which may affect cooking times in air fryer recipes. Adjust other liquids slightly if substituting."
faqQ3: "Why does my maple syrup measurement seem heavier than 20g per tbsp?"
faqA3: "If your syrup is colder or crystallised, it may pack more densely into the spoon, increasing the weight. Let it reach room temperature and stir well before measuring for accuracy. Impurities or added thickeners can also cause slight variations."
faqQ4: "How do I convert grams of maple syrup to cups for larger recipes?"
faqA4: "Since 1 tbsp equals 20g, 1 UK cup (250ml) holds about 16 tbsp, totalling 320g. For US cups (240ml), it’s roughly 300g. Use these approximations for glazes or marinades, but weigh critical ingredients for baking."

<p>1 tablespoon (tbsp) of maple syrup weighs approximately 20 grams. This measurement is essential for precise cooking, especially when using an air fryer, where accuracy can make or break a recipe. Whether you’re drizzling it over air-fried pancakes or using it as a glaze for roasted vegetables, knowing the exact weight ensures consistency.

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on precise cooking times and temperatures, and ingredient measurements are just as crucial. Using too much or too little maple syrup can affect texture, caramelisation, and even cooking times. For example, a sticky glaze with too much syrup might burn, while too little won’t provide enough flavour. That’s why converting 1 tbsp of maple syrup to grams (20g) helps maintain balance in recipes like air-fried desserts or glazed meats.</p>  

<p>If you’re experimenting with new dishes, such as <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer desserts</a>, exact measurements ensure reliable results. Maple syrup’s thickness and sugar content mean its weight can vary slightly, but 20g per tbsp is a reliable standard for UK measurements.</p>  

<h3>How to measure maple syrup without scales</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a digital scale, you can still measure 1 tbsp of maple syrup accurately. Use a standard UK tablespoon (15ml) and fill it to the brim for a close approximation. Since maple syrup is dense, levelling it off with a knife helps avoid excess. For recipes where precision is key, like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>air fryer desserts</a>, investing in a small kitchen scale is worthwhile.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for maple syrup in air fryer recipes</h2>  
<p>Maple syrup isn’t just for pancakes—it’s a versatile ingredient in air fryer cooking. A 20g (1 tbsp) portion can sweeten glazes for salmon, add depth to roasted vegetables, or create a crispy coating for air-fried chicken. Its natural sugars caramelise beautifully under high heat, making it ideal for quick, flavourful dishes.</p>  

<p>For a simple yet delicious idea, try brushing 1 tbsp (20g) of maple syrup over air-fried sweet potatoes before cooking. The result is a perfect balance of sweetness and crispiness. Explore more <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable-based air fryer recipes</a> to make the most of this measurement.</p>  

<h3>Does maple syrup brand affect weight?</h3>  
<p>Most pure maple syrups have a similar density, so 1 tbsp will still weigh around 20g regardless of brand. However, artificially thickened or flavoured syrups may vary slightly. Always check labels if using a non-standard product, especially for recipes where consistency matters, like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>sticky glazes</a> that need even cooking.</p>  

<h2>Converting other syrup measurements</h2>  
<p>If a recipe calls for larger quantities, remember that 100g of maple syrup equals roughly 5 tbsp. This conversion is handy when scaling up recipes for batch cooking or meal prep. For example, a marinade requiring 60g of syrup would need 3 tbsp. Keeping these ratios in mind simplifies adjustments without needing to weigh each time.</p>

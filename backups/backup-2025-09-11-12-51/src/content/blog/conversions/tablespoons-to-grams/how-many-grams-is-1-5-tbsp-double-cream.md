faqQ1: "Can I use single cream instead of double cream for 1.5 tbsp?"
faqA1: "Yes, but single cream has a lower fat content, so the texture and richness will differ. For 1.5 tbsp, you’d still measure roughly 22.5 grams, but the result may be less creamy. Adjust cooking times slightly if substituting in air fryer recipes."
faqQ2: "How do I measure 1.5 tbsp of double cream without scales?"
faqA2: "Use a standard tablespoon and fill it completely once, then half-fill it for the extra 0.5 tbsp. While not as precise as weighing, this method works in a pinch. For best results, invest in a digital scale for accurate air fryer cooking."
faqQ3: "Does the brand of double cream affect the weight per tablespoon?"
faqA3: "Slight variations can occur between brands due to fat content and thickness. However, the difference is minimal—around 1-2 grams per 1.5 tbsp. Stick to reliable brands and weigh for precision in air fryer recipes."
faqQ4: "Can I freeze dishes made with 1.5 tbsp of double cream?"
faqA4: "Yes, but the texture may change slightly upon thawing. Cream-based sauces can separate, so stir well when reheating in the air fryer. For best results, consume frozen dishes within a month."

faqQ1: "Can I use plain flour instead of cornflour for 5 tbsp (40g) in air fryer recipes?"
faqA1: "Yes, but the results will differ. Plain flour creates a denser coating, while cornflour delivers a lighter, crispier texture. For every 5 tbsp (40g) of cornflour, you can substitute with plain flour, but expect a slightly heavier finish. Adjust cooking times if needed."
faqQ2: "How do I store cornflour to keep it fresh for accurate measurements?"
faqA2: "Store cornflour in an airtight container in a cool, dry place. Moisture can cause clumping, leading to inaccurate measurements. For long-term freshness, consider refrigerating it, especially in humid climates. Always give it a stir before measuring."
faqQ3: "Why is my air fryer coating not crispy even with 5 tbsp (40g) of cornflour?"
faqA3: "This could be due to excess moisture on the food before coating. Pat ingredients dry first, or try a light spritz of oil. Also, preheat your air fryer—it helps achieve that instant crisp. Check our recipes for optimal temperature settings."
faqQ4: "Is cornflour the same as cornstarch in the UK?"
faqA4: "Yes, in the UK, cornflour and cornstarch are the same product. Both refer to the fine, white powder made from maize, perfect for thickening and crisping. If a recipe calls for cornstarch, UK cooks should use cornflour."

<h2>Why Accurate Cornflour Measurements Matter in Air Fryers</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on even coating and precise ingredient ratios for crispy, golden results. Too much cornflour can make coatings clumpy, while too little may leave food soggy.

<p>Cornflour is a staple in many air fryer recipes, from crunchy coatings to gluten-free baking. Its light texture helps achieve that coveted crispiness without excess oil. If you’re prepping a batch of <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>air-fried chicken</a>, 40g of cornflour per 5 tbsp ensures an even, golden finish. Always level your tablespoons for accuracy—a kitchen scale is even better!</p>  

<h3>How to Measure 5 Tbsp of Cornflour Without Scales</h3>  
<p>No scales? No problem. Use the spoon-and-level method: lightly spoon cornflour into a tablespoon and level it off with a knife. Five level tablespoons should give you roughly 40 grams. For best results, avoid packing the cornflour down, as this can lead to over-measuring. If you’re working with larger quantities, consider investing in a digital scale for precision.</p>  

<h2>Common Recipes Using 5 Tbsp (40g) of Cornflour</h2>

<h3>UK vs. US Measurements: Does It Affect Grams?</h3>  
<p>In the UK, 1 tablespoon equals 15ml, the same as in the US, so 5 tbsp of cornflour converts to 40g in both regions. However, ingredient density can vary slightly between brands. For absolute precision, especially in baking, weigh your cornflour rather than relying solely on volume.

faqQ1: "Is 2.5 tbsp of condensed milk the same as 50g in all brands?"
faqA1: "Most brands of condensed milk have a similar density, so 2.5 tbsp will generally weigh around 50g. However, check the label for specific nutritional information if precision is critical, especially for dietary needs."
faqQ2: "Can I use a regular spoon to measure 2.5 tbsp of condensed milk?"
faqA2: "While possible, it’s less accurate. A proper measuring spoon ensures consistency, but for best results, weigh it in grams using a kitchen scale. This avoids variations caused by how the milk settles in the spoon."
faqQ3: "How do I convert grams back to tablespoons for condensed milk?"
faqA3: "Divide the grams by 20 (since 1 tbsp ≈ 20g). For example, 60g of condensed milk would be 3 tbsp. Always level off the spoon for accuracy when converting back to volume measurements."
faqQ4: "Why does my air fryer recipe fail with condensed milk measurements?"
faqA4: "Air fryers circulate hot air intensely, so overly thick or unevenly distributed condensed milk can burn. Measure precisely, spread mixtures evenly, and consider reducing cooking time by 1–2 minutes to prevent scorching."

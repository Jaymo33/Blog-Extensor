<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on even cooking, and incorrect ingredient quantities can lead to uneven results. Tomato paste, being a concentrated ingredient, needs precise measurement to avoid overpowering or underwhelming flavours. Too much can make your dish overly tangy, while too little might leave it bland. This is especially important for recipes like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>air fryer chicken dishes</a>, where balance is key.</p>  

<p>Using grams instead of tablespoons eliminates guesswork, as scoop sizes can vary. A kitchen scale ensures accuracy, helping you achieve restaurant-quality meals at home.

<h3>How to measure tomato paste without a scale</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a scale, levelling off your tablespoons is the next best option. Use the back of a knife to scrape off excess paste for an accurate 2 tbsp measure. Remember, 2 tbsp of tomato paste to grams is roughly 30g, but slight variations can occur based on density. For sticky ingredients like tomato paste, lightly greasing your spoon can help with clean measurement.</p>  

<h2>Common recipes using 2 tbsp tomato paste</h2>

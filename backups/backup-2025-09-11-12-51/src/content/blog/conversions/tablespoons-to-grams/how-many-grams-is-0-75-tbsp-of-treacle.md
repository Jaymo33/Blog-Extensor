faqQ1: "Can I use golden syrup instead of treacle in air fryer recipes?"
faqA1: "Yes, golden syrup can substitute treacle in most air fryer recipes, but it’s slightly lighter in flavour and colour. Use the same gram measurement (15g for 0.75 tbsp), but expect a milder taste. For stronger molasses notes, stick with treacle."
faqQ2: "How do I stop treacle from sticking to my measuring spoon?"
faqA2: "Lightly coat your spoon with oil or warm it under hot water first. The oil creates a barrier, while warmth loosens the treacle. For ultimate precision, weigh it directly in grams using a kitchen scale."
faqQ3: "Does treacle burn easily in the air fryer?"
faqA3: "Treacle can burn if exposed to high heat for too long. When glazing, apply it in the last 5 minutes of cooking. For baked goods, follow recommended temperatures and timings to avoid scorching."
faqQ4: "Where can I find air fryer recipes using treacle?"
faqA4: "Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>cake recipes</a> or <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>main collection</a> for treacle-based ideas. From parkin to glazed meats, we’ve got plenty of inspiration for your air fryer."

<p>0.75 tbsp of treacle equals approximately 15 grams. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precision matters, especially when baking cakes or glazing meats.

<h2>Why accurate treacle measurements matter</h2>  
<p>When using an air fryer, precise measurements are key to achieving the perfect texture and flavour. Too much treacle can make desserts overly sweet or cause glazes to burn, while too little might leave dishes lacking richness.

<p>Treacle’s thick consistency means it’s easy to over-pour, leading to wasted ingredients and inconsistent results. By weighing it in grams, you’ll save time and reduce mess. Plus, many air fryer recipes, like our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>treacle tart</a>, rely on exact measurements for the best outcome.</p>  

<h3>How to measure treacle without the mess</h3>

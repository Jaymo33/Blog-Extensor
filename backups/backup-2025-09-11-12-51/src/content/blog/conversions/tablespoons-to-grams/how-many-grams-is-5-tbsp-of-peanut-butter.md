faqQ1: "Can I use crunchy peanut butter instead of smooth for the 5 tbsp (75g) measurement?"
faqA1: "Yes, crunchy and smooth peanut butter have the same density, so 5 tbsp of either will weigh approximately 75 grams. However, crunchy peanut butter may add extra texture to your air fryer recipes, which can be a delightful twist."
faqQ2: "Why does my peanut butter measurement seem slightly off when using tablespoons?"
faqA2: "Peanut butter’s sticky nature means it can compact or leave air gaps in a tablespoon measure, leading to slight variations. For absolute precision, weighing it in grams (75g for 5 tbsp) is recommended, especially for air fryer recipes where consistency matters."
faqQ3: "How do I convert grams back to tablespoons if my recipe uses weight?"
faqA3: "Since 1 tbsp of peanut butter equals 15g, divide the gram amount by 15 to get the tablespoon equivalent. For example, 75g ÷ 15 = 5 tbsp. This makes it easy to switch between measurements depending on your recipe’s requirements."
faqQ4: "Does the brand of peanut butter affect the 5 tbsp to grams conversion?"
faqA4: "Most commercial peanut butters have a similar density, so 5 tbsp will still be around 75g. However, natural peanut butter (without additives) may separate, so stir it well before measuring to ensure accuracy in your air fryer dishes."

<p>5 tablespoons of peanut butter equals approximately 75 grams. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements can make or break your dish. Whether you’re whipping up peanut butter cookies or a savoury satay sauce, knowing the exact weight ensures consistency. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we focus on accuracy to help you achieve perfect results every time.</p>

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on even heat distribution, and incorrect ingredient quantities can lead to uneven cooking. For example, too much peanut butter in a recipe might make it overly dense or greasy. Conversely, too little could leave your dish dry. Measuring 5 tbsp of peanut butter in grams (75g) ensures you hit the sweet spot. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more handy tips.</p>  

<p>Peanut butter is a versatile ingredient, appearing in everything from desserts like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>air fryer cakes</a> to marinades for chicken. Its sticky texture means volume measurements (like tablespoons) can vary slightly. Weight measurements in grams remove this guesswork, making them ideal for air fryer recipes.</p>  

<h3>How to measure peanut butter for air fryer recipes</h3>  
<p>To measure 5 tbsp of peanut butter accurately, use a kitchen scale for the most precise results. Scoop the peanut butter into a bowl and weigh it until you reach 75 grams. If you don’t have a scale, level off each tablespoon with a knife to ensure consistency.

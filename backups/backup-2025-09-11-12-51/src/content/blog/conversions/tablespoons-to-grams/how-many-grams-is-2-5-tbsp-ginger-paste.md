faqQ1: "Can I use fresh ginger instead of ginger paste in my air fryer recipes?"
faqA1: "Yes, you can substitute fresh ginger for ginger paste. Use 1 tbsp of freshly grated ginger for every 15g (1 tbsp) of ginger paste. For 2.5 tbsp (37.5g) of paste, you’d need about 2.5 tbsp of grated ginger. Adjust to taste, as fresh ginger can be more potent."
faqQ2: "Does ginger paste weigh the same as other pastes, like garlic paste?"
faqA2: "Not necessarily. Garlic paste is denser, so 2.5 tbsp would weigh closer to 40-45 grams. Always check specific conversions for each ingredient. For air fryer recipes, precise measurements ensure even cooking and balanced flavours."
faqQ3: "How long does ginger paste last in the fridge?"
faqA3: "Homemade ginger paste lasts about 2-3 weeks in the fridge if stored in an airtight container. Store-bought versions often contain preservatives and can last up to a month. Always check for spoilage before use."
faqQ4: "Can I freeze ginger paste for later use?"
faqA4: "Absolutely! Freeze ginger paste in ice cube trays for easy portioning. Each cube (about 1 tbsp or 15g) thaws quickly for air fryer recipes. Frozen ginger paste keeps for up to 6 months without losing much flavour."

faqQ1: "Can I use dried onions instead of 1.5 tbsp fresh chopped onion?"
faqA1: "Yes, but use 1.5 teaspoons (about 3g) of dried onion flakes to match the flavour of 1.5 tbsp fresh. Rehydrate them briefly in water before adding to air fryer recipes to prevent burning."
faqQ2: "Does the onion type affect the 1.5 tbsp to grams conversion?"
faqA2: "Slightly. Red onions are denser (≈12g per 1.5 tbsp) than white or brown onions (≈11g). Spring onions weigh less—about 8g per 1.5 tbsp of chopped greens. Always adjust for texture differences in air frying."
faqQ3: "How do I store leftover chopped onion for future air fryer use?"
faqA3: "Refrigerate in an airtight container for 3-4 days, or freeze in 11g portions. Frozen onions work well in air fryers but may need 1-2 extra minutes cooking time to evaporate excess moisture."
faqQ4: "Why does my air-fried onion topping taste bitter?"
faqA4: "Overcrowding or high heat can burn onions. Spread 1.5 tbsp (11g) portions evenly in the basket, and cook at 160°C for 5-7 minutes. Toss halfway for even caramelisation without charring."

<p>1.5 tablespoons (tbsp) of chopped onion equals approximately 11 grams. This measurement is essential for air fryer recipes where ingredient precision ensures perfect texture and flavour. Whether you’re making crispy onion toppings or savoury fillings, knowing the exact weight helps avoid over or under-seasoning.

<h2>Why accurate onion measurements matter in air frying</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on even cooking, and inconsistent onion quantities can lead to uneven browning or soggy results. Too much onion might release excess moisture, while too little won’t deliver the intended flavour. Recipes like air-fried onion bhajis or stuffed peppers need precise grams for balance. Visit <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>our recipe collection</a> for dishes where onion measurements are key.</p>  

<p>Chopped onion sizes vary, so weighing eliminates guesswork. A finely diced onion packs more densely into a tablespoon than roughly chopped pieces. For consistent results, always measure by weight when possible—especially in UK recipes where metric grams are standard.</p>  

<h3>How to measure 1.5 tbsp chopped onion without scales</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have kitchen scales, lightly fill a tablespoon with chopped onion and level it off. Repeat halfway for the 1.5 tbsp measure. This method works for most <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable-based air fryer recipes</a>, though weighing is more reliable. Remember, tightly packed onions will weigh more than loosely filled spoons.</p>  

<h2>Common recipes using 1.5 tbsp chopped onion</h2>  
<p>This quantity often appears in small-batch recipes, like air-fryer meatball coatings or mini frittatas. It’s also ideal for seasoning breadcrumbs or adding subtle flavour to <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>air-fried chicken dishes</a>. Since air fryers cook quickly, properly measured onions caramelise evenly without burning.</p>  

<p>For frozen chopped onions, the same 11-gram measure applies—just account for extra moisture. Pat them dry before air frying to prevent steaming. Our guide on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning your air fryer</a> helps tackle onion odours afterwards.</p>  

<h3>Adjusting recipes from volume to weight</h3>  
<p>When converting US recipes using cups to UK grams, note that 1 cup of chopped onion ≈ 160g. So 1.5 tbsp (11g) is roughly 1/14th of a cup. This ratio helps scale larger recipes for air fryer portions. Bookmark <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> for more measurement hacks.</p>

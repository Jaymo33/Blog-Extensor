faqQ1: "Can I use single cream instead of double cream for 0.25 tbsp?"
faqA1: "Yes, you can substitute single cream, but keep in mind it has a lower fat content (around 18% compared to 48% in double cream). The gram measurement will be similar (about 3.75 grams for 0.25 tbsp), but the texture and richness of your dish may vary slightly."
faqQ2: "How do I measure 0.25 tbsp without a measuring spoon?"
faqA2: "If you don’t have a 0.25 tbsp measure, use a standard teaspoon (1 tsp = 0.33 tbsp) and fill it about three-quarters full. Alternatively, estimate by dividing a tablespoon into four equal parts visually. For absolute precision, a digital scale is best."
faqQ3: "Does the brand of double cream affect the weight per tablespoon?"
faqA3: "Most UK double creams have a similar density, so the weight per tablespoon (15 grams) is fairly consistent across brands. However, always check the label for specific nutritional information if precision is critical for your recipe."
faqQ4: "Can I freeze dishes made with 0.25 tbsp of double cream?"
faqA4: "Yes, but be aware that freezing can alter the texture of cream-based dishes. Sauces may separate slightly when thawed, so stir well before reheating. For best results, add fresh cream after thawing if possible."

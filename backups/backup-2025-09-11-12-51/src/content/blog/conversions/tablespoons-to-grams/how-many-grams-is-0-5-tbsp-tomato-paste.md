faqQ1: "Can I use tomato purée instead of tomato paste in air fryer recipes?"
faqA1: "Tomato purée has a thinner consistency and less concentrated flavour than tomato paste. If substituting, you'll need to use about 1.5 times the amount of purée to match 0.5 tbsp (7 grams) of tomato paste. Adjust other liquid ingredients in your air fryer recipe accordingly to maintain the right texture."
faqQ2: "How do I measure 0.5 tbsp of tomato paste without scales?"
faqA2: "If you don't have digital scales, use a proper measuring spoon for accuracy. Fill a tablespoon measure halfway for 0.5 tbsp (about 7 grams). Alternatively, many tomato paste tubes have markings showing tablespoon measurements. You can squeeze out exactly half a tablespoon directly into your air fryer dish."
faqQ3: "Does the brand of tomato paste affect the weight conversion?"
faqA3: "Different brands may have slightly varying densities, but most standard tomato pastes will weigh about 7 grams per 0.5 tbsp. For absolute precision in air fryer cooking, especially with expensive ingredients, it's always best to weigh your tomato paste rather than relying solely on volume measurements."
faqQ4: "Why do air fryer recipes often use small amounts like 0.5 tbsp of tomato paste?"
faqA4: "Air fryers intensify flavours due to their concentrated cooking method. Small amounts of strong ingredients like tomato paste (0.5 tbsp or 7 grams) provide enough flavour without overwhelming the dish. This measurement also helps prevent burning or drying out that can occur with larger quantities in the air fryer's intense heat."

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>
<p>Air fryers rely on precise cooking times and ingredient ratios to deliver crispy, evenly cooked meals. Using too much or too little tomato paste can affect the texture and flavour of your dish.

<h2>Common uses for 0.5 tbsp of tomato paste in air fryer recipes</h2>
<p>This small but mighty measurement features in many air fryer dishes. You might use 7 grams (0.5 tbsp) of tomato paste in homemade air fryer pizza sauce or as a base for stuffed peppers. The concentrated flavour adds depth without making dishes too watery. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipes</a> often include this precise measurement for marinades.</p>

<p>Tomato paste works particularly well in air fryers because it caramelises beautifully under the intense heat.

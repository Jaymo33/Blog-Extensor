faqQ1: "Can I use mustard powder instead of prepared mustard for 0.25 tbsp?"
faqA1: "Yes, you can substitute mustard powder, but the conversion differs. Use about 0.5 tsp of mustard powder mixed with water to replace 0.25 tbsp of prepared mustard. Adjust to taste as the flavour intensity may vary."
faqQ2: "How does the type of mustard affect the weight in grams?"
faqA2: "Different mustards (Dijon, whole grain, yellow) have slightly varying densities, but the difference is minimal. 0.25 tbsp of any prepared mustard will still be close to 3.75 grams. For very thick mustards, level off the spoon for accuracy."
faqQ3: "Why is measuring small amounts like 0.25 tbsp important in air frying?"
faqA3: "Air fryers cook food quickly, so precise measurements ensure even flavour distribution and prevent overpowering tastes. Too much mustard can also cause sticking or uneven browning in the air fryer basket."
faqQ4: "Can I double this measurement if my recipe calls for 0.5 tbsp of mustard?"
faqA4: "Absolutely! Doubling 0.25 tbsp (3.75g) gives you 0.5 tbsp (7.5g). This scaling works for any recipe adjustments, making it easy to adapt quantities while maintaining the right flavour balance."

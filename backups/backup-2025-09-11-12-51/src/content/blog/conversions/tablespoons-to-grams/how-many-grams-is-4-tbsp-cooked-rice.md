faqQ1: "Does the type of rice affect how many grams are in 4 tablespoons?"
faqA1: "Yes, different rice varieties can vary slightly in weight. White rice tends to be lighter, while brown or wild rice may weigh more due to their density. However, the difference is minimal - typically just a few grams per 4 tbsp serving."
faqQ2: "Can I use this conversion for uncooked rice measurements?"
faqA2: "No, this conversion applies only to cooked rice. Uncooked rice weighs significantly more and absorbs water during cooking. For uncooked rice, 4 tbsp equals about 40 grams, but it will expand to roughly 120 grams when cooked."
faqQ3: "How do I measure 4 tbsp of sticky rice accurately?"
faqA3: "For sticky rice, fluff it gently with a fork before measuring to prevent compaction. Lightly fill the tablespoon without pressing down. If the rice is very sticky, slightly wetting the measuring spoon can help it release more cleanly."
faqQ4: "Why is weighing rice better than using volume measurements?"
faqA4: "Weighing in grams provides greater accuracy since rice can settle differently in measuring spoons. This consistency is especially important for air fryer cooking, where precise portions affect cooking time and texture. Digital scales eliminate guesswork for perfect results every time."

Keep in mind that brown rice may weigh slightly more due to its density.</p>

faqQ1: "Can I use millilitres instead of grams for measuring vinegar?"
faqA1: "Yes, 1.5 tbsp of vinegar is roughly 22.5ml, as vinegar’s density is close to water. However, grams are more precise for recipes requiring exact measurements, especially in air fryer cooking where consistency matters."
faqQ2: "Does the type of vinegar change the gram measurement?"
faqA2: "Most vinegars (white, apple cider, red wine) weigh about 15g per tbsp, so 1.5 tbsp would be 22.5g. Thicker varieties like balsamic reduction may weigh slightly more, but the difference is minimal for most recipes."
faqQ3: "How do I convert other vinegar amounts to grams?"
faqA3: "Multiply the number of tablespoons by 15 to get grams (e.g., 2 tbsp = 30g). For teaspoons, multiply by 5 (1 tsp = 5g). Keep our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a> handy for quick reference."
faqQ4: "Why is weighing vinegar better for air fryer recipes?"
faqA4: "Grams ensure accuracy, which is crucial for air fryer cooking where small changes can affect texture and cooking time. Volume measurements (like tbsp) can vary based on how the vinegar is poured, but grams provide consistency."

<p>1.5 tablespoons (tbsp) of vinegar weighs approximately 22.5 grams. This conversion is handy when precision matters in air fryer recipes, ensuring your dishes turn out perfectly every time. Whether you’re marinating chicken or adding a tangy kick to roasted vegetables, knowing the exact weight helps avoid guesswork.</p>  

<h2>Why convert tablespoons to grams?</h2>  
<p>Converting tablespoons to grams ensures accuracy, especially in air fryer cooking where precise measurements can affect texture and flavour. Unlike volume measurements, grams provide consistency, making it easier to replicate recipes. For example, a marinade with 1.5 tbsp of vinegar (22.5g) will taste the same every time you make it. If you’re exploring new recipes on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, gram measurements can simplify your prep work.</p>  

<p>Different vinegars, like apple cider or balsamic, have slightly varying densities, but the difference is minimal for most home cooking. For air fryer recipes, sticking to the standard 15 grams per tablespoon (or 22.5g for 1.5 tbsp) works perfectly. If you’re curious about other conversions, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for quick reference.</p>  

<h3>How to measure vinegar accurately</h3>  
<p>For the most precise results, use a digital kitchen scale to weigh your vinegar. Simply place your measuring spoon on the scale, tare it to zero, and pour until you hit 22.5 grams. This method eliminates errors caused by uneven spoon fills or viscosity differences. If you don’t have a scale, level off your tablespoon with a knife for consistency.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for 1.5 tbsp of vinegar in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Vinegar is a versatile ingredient in air fryer recipes, from tenderising meats to balancing flavours. A 1.5 tbsp (22.5g) portion works well in marinades for chicken or tofu, giving them a subtle tang without overpowering. Try it in a honey-mustard glaze or a quick pickle for vegetables—just toss them in the air fryer for crispy results.</p>  

<p>You can also use 1.5 tbsp of vinegar in dressings for air-fried salads or grain bowls. For example, mix it with olive oil and herbs for a light drizzle over roasted potatoes.

<h3>Does vinegar type affect the weight?</h3>  
<p>While most vinegars weigh roughly 15g per tbsp, thicker varieties like balsamic glaze may be slightly heavier. For everyday cooking, the standard conversion (22.5g per 1.5 tbsp) is reliable. If you’re using a specialty vinegar, check its density or weigh it once to confirm.</p>  

<h2>Tips for working with vinegar in air fryers</h2>  
<p>Vinegar can leave lingering odours in your air fryer if not cleaned properly. After cooking, wipe the basket with a damp cloth and a splash of vinegar to neutralise smells. For a deeper clean, use our recommended <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner</a> to keep your appliance fresh.</p>  

<p>When adding vinegar to marinades, let proteins sit for at least 30 minutes for maximum flavour penetration. For dressings or glazes, brush them onto food during the last few minutes of air frying to prevent burning. Experiment with different vinegars—like rice wine for Asian-inspired dishes or red wine vinegar for Mediterranean flavours.</p>

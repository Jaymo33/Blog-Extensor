faqQ1: "Can I use dried minced onion instead of fresh for this conversion?"
faqA1: "Yes, dried minced onion can be substituted, but the weight differs. Five tablespoons of dried minced onion weigh about 20 grams, as it's less dense. Rehydrate it with a little water before use for better texture in air fryer recipes."
faqQ2: "Does the type of onion affect the gram measurement?"
faqA2: "While all onions have similar densities, sweeter varieties like red or Vidalia may weigh slightly less due to higher water content. For most recipes, the difference is negligible, so 5 tbsp of any minced onion will still be close to 30 grams."
faqQ3: "How should I store leftover minced onion?"
faqA3: "Fresh minced onion keeps for 3–4 days in the fridge in an airtight container. For longer storage, freeze it in portions. Dried minced onion lasts up to a year in a cool, dark place. Always check for freshness before using."
faqQ4: "Can I use this conversion for other minced vegetables?"
faqA4: "This conversion works best for onions due to their density. For minced garlic, 5 tbsp equals about 25 grams, while minced celery is closer to 20 grams. Always check specific vegetable weights for accuracy in air fryer recipes."

<h3>How to measure minced onion correctly</h3>  
<p>For the most accurate conversion of 5 tbsp minced onion to grams, lightly pack the onion into the spoon without compressing it. Overpacking can add extra weight, skewing your recipe. If you don’t have a scale, remember that 1 tbsp of minced onion is roughly 6 grams. This rule of thumb works well for most <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable-based recipes</a>.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for minced onion in air fryer recipes</h2>  
<p>Minced onion adds depth to dishes like air-fried meatballs, stuffed peppers, or homemade onion bhajis. Since 5 tbsp equals about 30 grams, you can easily adjust quantities for larger batches. For example, doubling a recipe would require 60 grams (or 10 tbsp) of minced onion.

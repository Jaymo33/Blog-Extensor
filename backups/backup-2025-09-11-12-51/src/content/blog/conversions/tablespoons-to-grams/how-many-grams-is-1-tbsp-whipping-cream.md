<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Recipes</h2>  
<p>Using the correct weight for ingredients like whipping cream ensures your air fryer dishes turn out as intended. Too much or too little can affect moisture, browning, and even cooking times.

<h3>How to Measure 1 Tbsp Whipping Cream Without a Scale</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a scale, use a standard UK tablespoon (15ml) to measure whipping cream. Fill it to the brim without packing it down, then level it off with a knife.

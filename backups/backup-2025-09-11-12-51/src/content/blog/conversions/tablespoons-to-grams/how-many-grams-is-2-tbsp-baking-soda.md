faqQ1: "Can I use baking powder instead of baking soda for 2 tbsp in grams?"
faqA1: "No, baking powder and baking soda have different weights and properties. While 2 tbsp of baking soda is 28g, baking powder weighs slightly less (about 24g for 2 tbsp). They also react differently in recipes, so substitutions aren’t always straightforward."
faqQ2: "How do I convert 2 tbsp of baking soda to grams for cleaning solutions?"
faqA2: "The conversion is the same: 2 tbsp equals 28g. For cleaning, mix this amount with water to form a paste. Apply it to your air fryer basket, let it sit, then scrub gently for a grease-free finish."
faqQ3: "Why does my 2 tbsp of baking soda weigh more than 28g?"
faqA3: "If your measurement exceeds 28g, you may be packing the baking soda into the spoon. Always use a level tablespoon for accuracy. Humidity can also cause clumping, leading to a heavier weight."
faqQ4: "Is 2 tbsp of baking soda the same in US and UK measurements?"
faqA4: "Yes, 1 UK tablespoon (15ml) is equivalent to 1 US tablespoon (14.8ml), so the difference is negligible. For air fryer recipes, 2 tbsp of baking soda will still be roughly 28g in both systems."

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Using the correct amount of baking soda can make or break your air fryer recipes. Too much can leave a bitter taste, while too little might not provide the desired rise.

<h3>How to measure 2 tbsp of baking soda without a scale</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a digital scale, use a standard UK tablespoon for accuracy. Fill it level with baking soda, avoiding heaping or compacting. Two level tablespoons will give you roughly 28 grams, ideal for recipes like air fryer cakes from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>our cake category</a>.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for 2 tbsp of baking soda in air fryers</h2>

<h3>Does baking soda brand affect weight?</h3>  
<p>Most UK baking soda brands have similar densities, so 2 tbsp should consistently weigh around 28g. However, if your soda is clumpy, sift it before measuring for accuracy. This is especially important for air fryer recipes where precise leavening is crucial.</p>

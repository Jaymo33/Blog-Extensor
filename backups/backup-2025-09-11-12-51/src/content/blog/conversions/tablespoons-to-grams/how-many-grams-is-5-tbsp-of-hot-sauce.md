faqQ1: "Does the type of hot sauce affect the gram weight for 5 tbsp?"
faqA1: "Yes, thicker hot sauces like sriracha may weigh slightly more than thinner varieties such as Tabasco. While 5 tbsp generally equals 75 grams, always check your specific brand’s density if precision is crucial for your air fryer recipe."
faqQ2: "Can I use 5 tbsp of hot sauce directly in the air fryer basket?"
faqA2: "It’s best to mix 5 tbsp (75g) of hot sauce with other ingredients or use it as a marinade. Pouring it directly into the basket can cause smoking or uneven cooking. For glazes, apply during the last few minutes of air frying."
faqQ3: "How do I convert 5 tbsp of hot sauce to grams if I don’t have a scale?"
faqA3: "Use a standard UK tablespoon (15ml) and level it off for consistency. Five level tablespoons should approximate 75 grams. For sticky sauces, lightly grease the spoon to ensure an accurate measure."
faqQ4: "What’s the best way to reduce spiciness if I’ve added too much hot sauce?"
faqA4: "Balance excess heat by adding sweetness (honey or brown sugar) or acidity (lime juice). For air fryer recipes, you can also dilute the sauce with oil or broth before applying it to your food."

<p>5 tablespoons (tbsp) of hot sauce is approximately 75 grams (g). This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements can make or break your dish. Whether you’re marinating chicken, spicing up vegetables, or adding a kick to tofu, knowing the exact weight ensures consistent flavour.</p>

<h2>Why converting 5 tbsp of hot sauce to grams matters</h2>  
<p>When cooking with an air fryer, accuracy is key. Hot sauce can vary in density, but a general rule is that 1 tbsp equals about 15 grams. This means 5 tbsp of hot sauce converts to roughly 75 grams. Using grams instead of volume measurements eliminates guesswork, especially for recipes like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>spicy air-fried wings</a> or <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>marinated chicken</a>.</p>  

<p>Hot sauce brands differ in thickness, so weighing ensures you get the right heat level. For example, thicker sauces like sriracha may weigh slightly more, while thinner varieties like Tabasco could be lighter. Always check your specific brand if precision is crucial.</p>  

<h3>How to measure 5 tbsp of hot sauce accurately</h3>  
<p>To measure 5 tbsp of hot sauce in grams, use a kitchen scale for the most reliable result. Simply tare your scale with an empty bowl, then pour the hot sauce until it reaches 75 grams. If you don’t have a scale, use a standard UK tablespoon (15ml) and level it off for consistency.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for 5 tbsp of hot sauce in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Five tablespoons of hot sauce is perfect for marinating proteins like chicken or tofu. Try it in <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>spicy roasted vegetables</a> or as a glaze for air-fried shrimp. The 75-gram measurement ensures balanced heat without overpowering your dish.</p>  

<p>You can also mix 5 tbsp (75g) of hot sauce with other ingredients like honey or butter for a sticky, spicy coating. This works brilliantly for <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>converting oven recipes</a> to air fryer settings, as the smaller appliance intensifies flavours.</p>  

<h3>Adjusting recipes based on hot sauce weight</h3>  
<p>If a recipe calls for 5 tbsp of hot sauce but you prefer milder heat, reduce the grams incrementally. Start with 50 grams (about 3.5 tbsp) and adjust to taste. For extra spice, add 10-15 grams more, but be cautious—air fryers concentrate flavours.</p>  

<h2>Tips for storing and using hot sauce in air fryer meals</h2>  
<p>Once opened, store hot sauce in the fridge to maintain freshness. When measuring 5 tbsp (75g), shake the bottle well to ensure even consistency. For sticky sauces, lightly grease your measuring spoon to help it slide off easily.</p>  

<p>Hot sauce can also be brushed onto food during air frying for a caramelised finish. Check out <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning tips</a> to prevent sticky residue buildup in your appliance after cooking with saucy recipes.</p>

<h3>How to Convert 260 Fan Oven to Fahrenheit</h3>
<p>To convert 260°F fan oven to a conventional oven, first understand the difference in heat distribution. Fan ovens use a fan to circulate hot air, reducing cooking time. For conventional ovens, reduce the temperature by 20°C. So, 260°F fan oven becomes 140°C in a conventional oven. This ensures your dish cooks evenly without burning.</p>

<h3>Common Mistakes to Avoid</h3>
<p>One common mistake is not adjusting the cooking time when converting temperatures. A conventional oven takes longer to cook than a fan oven. Always monitor your dish and use a timer. Another error is forgetting to preheat the oven, leading to uneven cooking. For more tips, see our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning guide</a>.</p>

<h2>Practical Tips for Baking in a Conventional Oven</h2>
<p>When using a conventional oven, always preheat it to the correct temperature. This ensures even cooking from the start. For a 260°F fan oven recipe, set your conventional oven to 140°C. Use an oven thermometer to verify the temperature, as oven dials can be inaccurate.

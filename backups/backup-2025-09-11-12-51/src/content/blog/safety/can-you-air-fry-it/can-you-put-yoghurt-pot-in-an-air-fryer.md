<p>No, you should not put a yoghurt pot in an air fryer. Most yoghurt pots are made from thin plastic that can melt or even catch fire at typical air fryer temperatures between 160°C to 200°C. The intense circulating heat can warp the container within minutes, potentially releasing harmful chemicals into your food and damaging your appliance.</p>

<h2>Why Yoghurt Pots Aren't Air Fryer Safe</h2>
<p>Standard yoghurt pots found in UK supermarkets are typically made from polypropylene (PP5) or polystyrene (PS6) plastics. While these materials are food-safe at fridge temperatures, they begin softening around 80°C and melt completely by 130°C. Your air fryer's heating element reaches much higher temperatures, creating several risks. The plastic could warp onto heating elements, drip onto food, or release toxic fumes. Even microwave-safe containers aren't necessarily air fryer-safe due to the different heating methods.</p>
<p>Some premium yoghurt brands use slightly thicker containers, but these still aren't designed for dry heat environments. Unlike microwave heating which warms food directly, air fryers blast hot air that surrounds the container from all angles. This makes even short reheating attempts risky. For safe alternatives, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes section</a> that suggests proper cookware.</p>

<h2>What Happens If You Try It Anyway?</h2>
<p>Attempting to use a yoghurt pot in your air fryer can lead to several undesirable outcomes. Within 2-3 minutes at 180°C, the plastic will likely begin warping and sticking to the basket. By 5 minutes, you might notice melting edges or an unpleasant plastic smell. In worst cases, the container could catch fire if it contacts the heating element directly.</p>
<p>The melted plastic can also permanently damage your air fryer's non-stick coating or clog ventilation holes. Cleaning up requires letting the appliance cool completely before carefully removing any stuck-on plastic - a process we detail in our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning guide</a>. Some users report lingering plastic odours that affect future cooking sessions.</p>

<h3>Exceptions and Safer Alternatives</h3>
<p>Glass yoghurt pots (like those from some organic brands) might seem safer, but they're often too thick for proper air circulation. Instead, transfer contents to air fryer-safe containers like silicone molds, small ovenproof ramekins, or parchment paper liners. For portion control, consider our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert recipes</a> designed specifically for air fryers.</p>

<h2>Common Questions About Air Fryer Materials</h2>
<p>Many home cooks wonder why some plastics work in microwaves but not air fryers. Microwave-safe containers are tested for wet heat (steam) and specific radiation frequencies, not the dry, convective heat of air fryers. Even "heat-resistant" plastics usually max out at 120°C - far below air frying temperatures.</p>
<p>When shopping for air fryer accessories, look for materials rated to at least 200°C. Silicone bakeware, stainless steel containers, and tempered glass work best. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a> includes safe material guidelines alongside temperature adjustments for different cookware types.</p>

<h3>Recognising Air Fryer-Safe Symbols</h3>
<p>Check packaging for specific air fryer compatibility symbols rather than relying on general heat resistance claims. Some manufacturers now include air fryer icons alongside microwave and dishwasher symbols. When in doubt, stick to metal or ceramic containers that you'd feel comfortable using in a conventional oven.</p>

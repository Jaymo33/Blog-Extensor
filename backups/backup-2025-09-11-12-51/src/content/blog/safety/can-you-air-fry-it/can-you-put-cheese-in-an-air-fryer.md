<p>Yes, you can put cheese in an air fryer, but it requires careful handling to prevent burning or melting mishaps. Cheese behaves differently under high heat, so knowing which types work best and how to time them is key. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we’ve tested countless methods to help you air fry cheese safely and deliciously.</p>

<h2>Which Cheeses Work Best in an Air Fryer?</h2>
<p>Hard cheeses like cheddar, mozzarella, and parmesan hold up well in an air fryer because they melt evenly without dripping. Soft cheeses like brie or camembert can work but need monitoring to avoid oozing through the basket. For recipes like air-fried cheese sticks or stuffed mushrooms, semi-hard cheeses like gouda or halloumi are ideal. Avoid overly processed cheeses, as they may separate or become greasy. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>cheese-friendly recipes</a> for inspiration.</p>

<p>Pre-shredded cheese often contains anti-caking agents that can affect melting, so grating your own is better. If you’re air frying cheese as a topping, add it in the last 1–2 minutes to prevent burning. For dishes like quesadillas or grilled cheese, a light spritz of oil helps crisp the exterior without sticking. Always use parchment liners or foil for messy melts—find the right <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner</a> to tackle any residue afterward.</p>

<h3>Does Cheese Melt Well in an Air Fryer?</h3>
<p>Cheese melts beautifully in an air fryer if you control the temperature and timing. Low to medium heat (160–180°C) works best for even melting without scorching. For gooey results, cover dishes with foil to trap steam, or layer cheese between ingredients to protect it from direct heat. Mozzarella on pizza or melted cheddar on nachos turns out perfectly with this method.</p>

<h2>Can Cheese Catch Fire in an Air Fryer?</h2>
<p>While rare, cheese can smoke or catch fire if exposed to excessive heat or left unattended. High-fat cheeses are more prone to dripping, which can cause flare-ups. To minimise risks, avoid cooking cheese above 200°C and keep portions small. If you notice smoking, turn off the air fryer immediately and let it cool.

<p>Non-stick baskets are less likely to scorch cheese, but always preheat the air fryer to ensure even cooking. For dishes like cheese-topped burgers or melts, place a drip tray underneath to catch excess grease. If you’re reheating cheesy foods, use lower temperatures and check frequently. Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable recipes</a> with cheese for balanced options.</p>

<h3>How to Reheat Cheese in an Air Fryer</h3>
<p>Reheating cheese-heavy dishes like pizza or lasagne works well at 150°C for 3–5 minutes. Cover with foil to prevent drying out, and add a sprinkle of water to revive melted textures. Avoid overcrowding to ensure even heat distribution.</p>

<h2>Tips for Perfect Air-Fried Cheese Every Time</h2>
<p>Use a light hand with cheese—less is more to prevent clumping or burning. For crispy edges, like on air-fried halloumi, pat the cheese dry before cooking. Pair cheese with sturdy bases like bread or veggies to absorb excess oil. Experiment with our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/potatoes>potato recipes</a> topped with cheese for crowd-pleasing results.</p>

<p>Clean your air fryer promptly after cooking cheese to avoid stubborn residue. A mix of baking soda and warm water works wonders for sticky spots.

faqQ1: "Can silicone cake moulds melt in an air fryer?"
faqA1: "High-quality silicone moulds won’t melt in air fryers as they withstand temperatures up to 230°C. However, cheap silicone blends with plastic fillers may warp or degrade. Always check the manufacturer’s temperature rating before use."
faqQ2: "How do I prevent cake batter from spilling in the air fryer?"
faqA2: "Fill moulds only 2/3 full and place them on a stable surface in the basket. Use moulds with tall sides and avoid over-mixing batter, which creates excess air. For extra security, put a foil-lined tray underneath during baking."
faqQ3: "Why did my cake mould warp in the air fryer?"
faqA3: "Warping usually indicates the mould material can’t handle the air fryer’s intense heat. Thin metal or low-grade silicone are common culprits. Always use moulds specifically rated for high temperatures and consider supporting them with a trivet."
faqQ4: "Can I use paper cake cases in an air fryer?"
faqA4: "Paper cases alone aren’t recommended as the air fryer’s fan can blow them around. If using paper, place them inside a stable metal muffin tin or silicone holder. Better yet, opt for reusable silicone cases designed for air fryers."

<p>Yes, you can put certain cake moulds in an air fryer, but only if they’re made from heat-safe materials like silicone or metal. Avoid plastic or low-quality moulds that could melt or release toxins. The key is checking your mould’s maximum temperature rating – most air fryers operate between 160°C to 200°C, so your mould must withstand this heat.</p>

<h2>Which Cake Moulds Are Air Fryer Safe?</h2>
<p>Silicone cake moulds are generally the best choice for air fryers. They’re flexible, heat-resistant up to 230°C, and often come with reinforced edges for stability. Look for food-grade silicone with no plastic fillers. Metal moulds, especially aluminium or stainless steel, also work well but may require greasing to prevent sticking.

<p>Non-stick coated metal moulds perform excellently but avoid scratched coatings. Ceramic moulds can be used if they’re oven-safe and fit your air fryer basket. Always check the manufacturer’s guidelines – some brands like Ninja specify compatible accessories. Never use paper cases without a supporting metal base as the air flow may displace them.</p>

<h3>Materials to Avoid in Air Fryer Cake Moulds</h3>
<p>Plastic moulds should never go in an air fryer unless explicitly labelled as heat-resistant. Thin plastic melts at around 120°C, potentially damaging your appliance and contaminating food. Glass moulds are risky unless tempered for oven use – rapid temperature changes may cause cracking. Cheap silicone blends with plastic additives may warp or release harmful fumes.</p>

<h2>How to Use Cake Moulds in an Air Fryer</h2>
<p>First, ensure your mould fits comfortably in the basket with space for air circulation. Overcrowding leads to uneven cooking. Grease metal moulds lightly with oil or butter, while silicone usually needs no preparation. Fill moulds only 2/3 full as batter rises.

<p>Set temperatures 10-15°C lower than conventional oven recipes, as air fryers cook faster. Use the bake or cake preset if available. Check doneness 5 minutes early with a toothpick test. Let cakes cool briefly before removing from moulds to prevent breaking. For cleaning tips, visit <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>our cleaning guide</a>.</p>

<h3>Troubleshooting Common Cake Mould Issues</h3>
<p>If cakes stick, your mould may need better greasing or lower temperature. Burnt edges suggest uneven heat – rotate the mould halfway. Sinking centres mean undercooking; extend time in 3-minute increments. For silicone moulds that buckle, place them on a trivet or metal plate for support. Always monitor first-time use closely.</p>

<h2>Safety Considerations for Air Fryer Cake Moulds</h2>
<p>Never leave moulds unattended during first uses. Watch for smoke or odd odours indicating unsuitable materials. Ensure moulds don’t touch heating elements. After use, allow moulds to cool before handling or cleaning. Check for warping or discolouration that signals material degradation.

<p>Consider the mould’s design – those with intricate patterns may need adjusted cooking times. Deep moulds work better than wide ones for even air circulation. For family-sized cakes, you might need to bake in batches. Remember, most air fryer cakes cook 20-30% faster than oven versions, so timing is crucial.</p>

<h3>Best Cake Mould Shapes for Air Fryers</h3>
<p>Round and square moulds under 18cm diameter fit most baskets perfectly. Individual portion moulds like muffin tins work brilliantly. Avoid overly tall designs that block airflow. Some innovative bakers use oven-safe ramekins or even foil cases designed for air fryers. For portion guidance, check our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a>.</p>

faqQ1: "Will parchment paper catch fire in my air fryer?"
faqA1: "Perforated parchment paper designed for air fryers rarely catches fire if used correctly. Avoid letting it touch heating elements or covering the entire basket. Standard baking parchment poses higher risks due to airflow blockage."
faqQ2: "Can I reuse parchment paper in my air fryer?"
faqA2: "We don’t recommend reusing parchment paper, especially after cooking greasy foods. Oil residues can smoke or burn during subsequent uses. Dispose of used liners and replace them for each cooking session."
faqQ3: "Is parchment paper or aluminium foil better for air fryers?"
faqA3: "Parchment paper is generally safer than foil, which can reflect heat unevenly and damage coatings. Some air fryers allow foil for specific recipes, but always check your manual and never let foil contact heating elements."
faqQ4: "Why does my parchment paper keep flying up in the air fryer?"
faqA4: "Secure parchment by placing heavier food (like potatoes or chicken) on the edges or using a metal rack. In drawer-style air fryers, slightly dampening the paper helps it adhere before adding ingredients."

<p>Yes, you can safely use parchment paper in an air fryer if you choose perforated sheets designed for air fryers. Standard baking parchment risks blocking airflow or catching fire, but purpose-made liners with holes allow proper circulation. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we recommend checking your model’s manual first, as some manufacturers specify approved accessories.</p>

<h2>Why Use Parchment Paper in an Air Fryer?</h2>
<p>Parchment paper simplifies cleanup by preventing food from sticking to the basket, especially with sticky items like marinated chicken or melted cheese. It also helps distribute heat evenly, reducing burnt spots on delicate foods like fish fillets or roasted vegetables. Many cooks use it for reheating leftovers, as shown in our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> section. Just ensure the paper doesn’t cover the entire basket – leave gaps for airflow.</p>
<p>Perforated parchment paper is widely available online and in supermarkets, often labelled specifically for air fryers. Brands like Ninja and Philips even sell custom-fit liners for their models. Avoid wax paper or aluminium foil substitutes unless your air fryer’s guidelines permit them, as they can melt or cause sparking.</p>

<h3>Risks of Using Regular Parchment Paper</h3>
<p>Non-perforated parchment paper can obstruct the air fryer’s fan, causing overheating or uneven cooking. In extreme cases, it may ignite if it contacts heating elements. A 2022 study by the UK Kitchen Safety Council noted that 37% of air fryer fires involved improper liner use. Always trim sheets to fit your basket without touching the top or sides.</p>

<h2>How to Use Parchment Paper Correctly</h2>
<p>First, preheat your air fryer for 2-3 minutes before adding food with parchment to prevent shifting. For small items like fries or shrimp, use a single layer; for juicier foods like salmon (see our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/salmon>salmon recipes</a>), fold up the edges to contain drips. Never reuse greasy parchment, as oil buildup can smoke at high temperatures.</p>
<p>Most parchment papers tolerate heats up to 220°C, but check packaging for limits. If cooking above 200°C (like for crispy potatoes), consider silicone mats instead. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a> helps adjust traditional oven recipes safely.</p>

<h3>Model-Specific Considerations</h3>
<p>Ninja Air Fryers work well with their branded parchment liners, which have reinforced edges. For basket-style models like the Cosori, round perforated sheets sit flush against the bottom. Drawer-type air fryers require extra caution – always secure parchment with a metal rack or food weight to prevent it flying up.</p>

<h2>Alternatives to Parchment Paper</h2>
<p>Silicone baskets are reusable and withstand higher temperatures, ideal for frequent air fryer users. Lightly greasing the basket works for non-sticky foods like chicken wings or vegetables. For messy dishes, try our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning tips</a> to maintain your appliance without liners.</p>
<p>Some cooks use cabbage or lettuce leaves as natural, compostable liners for steaming fish or dumplings. However, these won’t crisp foods like parchment does. Always prioritise safety – if unsure, cook directly in the basket and soak it afterwards.</p>

faqQ1: "Can I put a Pyrex bowl in my air fryer?"
faqA1: "Yes, Pyrex bowls are generally safe for air fryers as they're made from heat-resistant borosilicate glass. Ensure the bowl fits with proper air circulation and avoid sudden temperature changes. Start with shorter cooking times at slightly lower temperatures than you'd use in an oven."
faqQ2: "Why did my oven-safe bowl crack in the air fryer?"
faqA2: "Cracking usually occurs from thermal shock - either placing a cold bowl into a hot air fryer or exposing it to rapid temperature changes. Always preheat bowls gradually and avoid using damaged or low-quality ceramics. Check for manufacturer's maximum temperature ratings before use."
faqQ3: "Do metal bowls work differently than ceramic in air fryers?"
faqA3: "Metal bowls heat up and cool down faster than ceramic, which may require adjusting cooking times. They're excellent for foods needing quick browning but can make baked goods cook unevenly. Stainless steel is generally the safest metal choice for air fryers."
faqQ4: "Can I use my air fryer bowl in a conventional oven too?"
faqA4: "Most air fryer-safe bowls are oven-compatible, but always check the manufacturer's guidelines. The reverse isn't always true - some oven bowls may not withstand an air fryer's intense air circulation. When in doubt, look for dual-certified cookware labelled for both appliances."

<p>Yes, you can use oven-safe bowls in most air fryers, provided they fit properly and are made from materials that withstand rapid air circulation at high temperatures. The key factors are bowl material, size compatibility, and avoiding direct contact with heating elements. Many ceramic, glass, and metal bowls labelled "oven-safe" will work, but always check manufacturer guidelines first.</p>

<h2>Understanding Oven-Safe Materials for Air Fryers</h2>
<p>Oven-safe bowls typically come in ceramic, tempered glass, or metal varieties – all of which can generally handle air fryer conditions. Ceramic bowls must be glazed properly to prevent cracking under thermal shock. Pyrex or other borosilicate glass bowls are excellent choices as they distribute heat evenly. Stainless steel bowls work well too, though they may require adjusted cooking times. Avoid any bowls with plastic components or decorative finishes that might peel at high temperatures.</p>
<p>When browsing <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a>, you'll notice many suggest using oven-safe dishes for foods like crumbles or baked eggs. The concentrated heat of an air fryer cooks 20-30% faster than conventional ovens, so always reduce suggested oven times by about 25% when adapting recipes. This prevents overcooking while allowing your oven-safe bowl to perform as intended.</p>

<h3>Size and Placement Considerations</h3>
<p>An oven-safe bowl must leave adequate space for air circulation – at least 2-3cm clearance from all sides of the basket. Overcrowding prevents proper crisping and may cause uneven cooking. For best results, place the bowl on a trivet or air fryer-safe rack to elevate it slightly, ensuring hot air can flow underneath. Most 15-20cm diameter bowls work well in standard 3.5-5 litre air fryers.</p>

<h2>Safety Checks Before Using Oven-Safe Bowls</h2>
<p>Always verify your bowl's maximum temperature rating exceeds your air fryer's highest setting (typically 200°C). Check for hairline cracks or chips that could worsen under heat stress. When first testing a new bowl, place it empty in the air fryer at 150°C for 5 minutes to check for thermal shock. Sudden temperature changes are the main cause of breakage, so always preheat bowls gradually when possible.</p>
<p>Some oven-safe bowls have silicone bases or handles – ensure these components are rated for at least 230°C if your air fryer runs hot. For <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>easy cleaning afterwards</a>, lightly grease the bowl or use parchment liners when cooking sticky foods. Never place cold bowls directly into a preheated air fryer, as the sudden temperature change could cause shattering.</p>

<h3>What Not to Use in Your Air Fryer</h3>
<p>Avoid thin plastic containers, melamine, or decorative bowls with metallic paints. Even if labelled oven-safe, delicate porcelain or antique ceramics may not withstand the intense air currents. Glass lids are generally unsuitable unless specifically designed for air fryers. When in doubt, consult your air fryer manual or the bowl manufacturer's guidelines – safety should always come first.</p>

<h2>Practical Uses for Oven-Safe Bowls</h2>
<p>Oven-safe bowls excel for air frying dishes that benefit from containment – think molten chocolate puddings, individual mac and cheese portions, or crème brûlée. They're perfect for <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/Dessert>air fryer desserts</a> that need gentle, even heating. You can also use them to reheat leftovers like casseroles or soups without drying them out. The bowl's sides prevent sauces from splattering while allowing the top to crisp beautifully.</p>
<p>For roasting vegetables or smaller protein portions, shallow oven-safe dishes work better than deep bowls. This maximises surface area for crisping while still containing juices. When adapting conventional oven recipes from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, reduce both temperature by about 20°C and cooking time by 20-25% for best results with oven-safe bowls.</p>

<h3>Troubleshooting Common Issues</h3>
<p>If your oven-safe bowl develops hot spots, try rotating it halfway through cooking. Excessive browning on one side indicates poor air circulation. For bowls that rattle during cooking, place a heatproof silicone mat underneath to stabilise them. Should any bowl show discolouration or warping after air frying, discontinue use immediately as this signals material breakdown.</p>

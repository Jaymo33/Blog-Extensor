<p id="">Baking pans are essential for air fryer cooking, whether you're making cakes, muffins, or even savoury dishes. The right pan ensures even heat distribution and perfect results every time. From non-stick baking tin sets to silicone options, there's a wide variety to choose from. At <a href="https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk" id="">airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we've tested countless pans to find the best for your air fryer. Let's dive into the details to help you pick the perfect one.</p><h2 id="">Types of Baking Pans for Air Fryers</h2><p id="">Air fryers work best with specific types of baking pans designed to fit their compact space. Non-stick baking tin sets are a popular choice, as they prevent sticking and make cleaning a breeze. Silicone pans are another great option, offering flexibility and easy release for delicate bakes like muffins or cupcakes. For those who love variety, a multi-purpose baking tin set can handle everything from brownies to mini quiches. Always check the dimensions to ensure the pan fits your air fryer basket. You can find more inspiration for recipes at <a href="https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes" id="">airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes</a>.</p><p id="">Metal baking pans are durable and conduct heat well, making them ideal for even baking. However, avoid pans with sharp edges that could damage your air fryer basket. Ceramic or glass pans can also be used, but they may require adjusting cooking times. A good baking tin set will include different sizes for versatility, from small tart tins to larger cake pans. Whether you're baking a chocolate cake or a savoury frittata, the right pan makes all the difference.</p><h3 id="">Non-Stick Baking Tin Sets</h3><p id="">Non-stick baking tin sets are a must-have for air fryer enthusiasts. They ensure your baked goods slide out effortlessly, saving time on scrubbing. Look for sets with a sturdy construction and a reliable non-stick coating. These pans are perfect for everything from cookies to mini pies, and they often come in handy multi-packs.

For cakes and brownies, a square or round baking tin set is ideal. If you love muffins or cupcakes, silicone or non-stick muffin trays are the way to go. Consider the material—non-stick for easy cleaning, or metal for even heat distribution. Always measure your air fryer basket to ensure the pan fits comfortably. For recipe ideas, explore <a href="https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes" id="">airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes</a>.</p><p id="">Another factor is the depth of the pan—shallow pans are great for cookies, while deeper ones suit cakes and breads. Avoid overcrowding the air fryer basket, as this can block airflow and affect cooking. If you're new to air fryer baking, start with a versatile baking tin set that includes multiple sizes. This way, you can experiment with different recipes without buying separate pans. Remember, the right pan can elevate your baking game significantly.</p><h3 id="">Silicone Baking Pans</h3><p id="">Silicone baking pans are lightweight, flexible, and incredibly easy to clean. They're perfect for delicate bakes like muffins or cheesecakes, as they allow for easy release. Silicone also doesn't retain odours, making it great for both sweet and savoury dishes. Just ensure the silicone is heat-resistant and fits your air fryer dimensions. These pans are a fantastic addition to any baking tin set.</p><h2 id="">Tips for Using Baking Pans in Your Air Fryer</h2><p id="">Always preheat your air fryer before adding the baking pan for even cooking. Lightly grease non-stick pans, even if they claim to be stick-resistant, for extra assurance. Avoid overfilling the pan, as this can lead to uneven baking or spills. For best results, rotate the pan halfway through cooking to ensure even browning. Find more expert tips at <a href="https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk" id="">airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>.</p><p id="">If using silicone pans, place them on a trivet or small rack for stability. Metal pans can go directly into the basket, but ensure they're centred for proper airflow.

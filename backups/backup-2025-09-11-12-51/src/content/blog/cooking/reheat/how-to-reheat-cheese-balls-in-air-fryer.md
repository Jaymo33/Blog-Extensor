<p>To reheat cheese balls in an air fryer, set the temperature to 160°C (320°F) and cook for 3–5 minutes until crispy and heated through. This method ensures the coating stays crunchy while the cheese inside melts perfectly. Whether you’re working with leftovers or refrigerated cheese balls, the air fryer delivers consistent results without the sogginess of microwaving.</p>  

<h2>Why Use an Air Fryer to Reheat Cheese Balls?</h2>  
<p>Air fryers excel at reheating fried foods like cheese balls because they circulate hot air evenly, restoring crispiness without extra oil. Unlike microwaves, which can make the coating rubbery, air fryers preserve the texture while ensuring the cheese centre becomes deliciously molten.

<p>Another advantage is speed—reheating cheese balls in an air fryer takes just minutes, making it ideal for quick snacks or party prep. The compact size of most air fryers also means you can reheat small batches without wasting energy.

<h3>Best Temperature for Reheating Cheese Balls</h3>  
<p>160°C (320°F) is the sweet spot for reheating cheese balls—hot enough to crisp the exterior but gentle enough to prevent the cheese from leaking. If your air fryer has presets, use the "reheat" or "snacks" mode for foolproof results. For frozen cheese balls, add 1–2 extra minutes.</p>  

<h2>Step-by-Step Reheating Instructions</h2>  
<p>Start by preheating your air fryer to 160°C for 3 minutes to ensure even cooking. Arrange cheese balls in a single layer, leaving space between them for airflow. Avoid overcrowding, as this leads to uneven reheating. Shake the basket halfway through to promote uniform crispiness.</p>  

<p>For refrigerated cheese balls, check at the 3-minute mark—they typically need 4–5 minutes total. If reheating frozen cheese balls, extend the time to 6–7 minutes. For more recipe ideas, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/appetisers>appetiser category</a>.</p>  

<h3>Tips to Prevent Drying Out</h3>  
<p>Lightly spritzing cheese balls with oil before reheating enhances crispiness. If the coating seems dry, a 10-second brush with melted butter works wonders. For extra insurance, place a foil liner at the bottom of the basket to catch any cheese drips—our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaner guide</a> makes post-cooking tidy-up a breeze.</p>  

<h2>Common Mistakes to Avoid</h2>  
<p>Overheating is the top culprit for burst cheese balls. Stick to the recommended 5-minute max and check frequently. Another mistake is skipping preheating, which can lead to uneven results. Always use tongs to handle hot cheese balls—the molten cheese centre retains heat longer than the coating.</p>  

<p>Using parchment paper with holes or a perforated silicone liner improves airflow compared to solid liners. For cheese-heavy variations like mozzarella sticks, reduce the temperature by 10°C to prevent oozing.

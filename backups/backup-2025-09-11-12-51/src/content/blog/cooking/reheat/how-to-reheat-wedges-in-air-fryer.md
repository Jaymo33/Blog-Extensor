faqQ1: "Can you reheat wedges in an air fryer without drying them out?"
faqA1: "Yes! Reheating wedges at 180°C (350°F) for 3–5 minutes with a light spritz of oil keeps them crispy without drying. Avoid overcrowding the basket for even results."
faqQ2: "What’s the best temperature to reheat wedges in an air fryer?"
faqA2: "180°C (350°F) is ideal—it crisps the exterior without burning. Thicker wedges may need a slightly lower temp (170°C) for longer to heat through evenly."
faqQ3: "How do you reheat wedges in an air fryer if they’re from the fridge?"
faqA3: "Spread them in a single layer at 180°C for 4–6 minutes, shaking halfway. A quick oil spray helps restore crispiness. Check thicker wedges for doneness."
faqQ4: "Can I reheat frozen wedges directly in the air fryer?"
faqA4: "It’s better to thaw them first for even reheating. If short on time, cook frozen wedges at 180°C for 6–8 minutes, shaking occasionally."

<p>Reheating wedges in an air fryer at 180°C (350°F) for 3–5 minutes restores their crispiness perfectly. This method beats microwaving, which often leaves them limp, and is quicker than using a conventional oven. Whether your wedges are from last night’s dinner or stored in the fridge, an air fryer brings them back to life with minimal effort.</p>

<h2>Why Use an Air Fryer to Reheat Wedges?</h2>
<p>Air fryers circulate hot air around the food, ensuring even reheating without drying out the wedges. Unlike microwaves, which steam food, air fryers revive the crispy exterior that makes wedges so enjoyable. This makes them ideal for reheating leftover wedges while maintaining their texture.

<p>Another advantage is speed—reheating wedges in an air fryer takes just minutes, making it perfect for quick snacks or sides. Plus, you won’t need to preheat the appliance, saving even more time. If you’re reheating wedges from the fridge, a light spritz of oil can help restore their golden crunch.

<h2>Step-by-Step Guide to Reheating Wedges</h2>
<p>Start by preheating your air fryer to 180°C (350°F) for 2 minutes if your model requires it. Spread the wedges in a single layer in the basket, ensuring they aren’t overcrowded to allow proper air circulation. Cook for 3–5 minutes, shaking the basket halfway for even crisping. For wedges stored in the fridge, add an extra minute if needed.</p>
<p>If your wedges were frozen, thaw them first for best results. Reheating frozen wedges directly can lead to uneven cooking. For more on handling frozen foods, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/frozen-foods>frozen foods category</a>. A quick brush with oil or a spritz of cooking spray can enhance crispiness, especially if the wedges have dried out slightly.</p>

<h3>Best Temperature for Reheating Wedges</h3>
<p>180°C (350°F) is the sweet spot for reheating wedges in an air fryer—hot enough to crisp them up without burning. Lower temperatures may leave them soggy, while higher heat can overcook the edges. If your wedges are particularly thick, you might need to adjust the time slightly. Always keep an eye on them to avoid overdoing it.</p>

<h3>How Long to Reheat Wedges in an Air Fryer</h3>
<p>Thin, standard-cut wedges typically take 3–5 minutes at 180°C. Thicker wedges or those straight from the fridge may need up to 6 minutes. Check them at the 3-minute mark and shake the basket to ensure even heating. For wedges with toppings or coatings, like cheese or spices, reduce the time slightly to prevent burning.</p>

<h2>Tips for Perfectly Reheated Wedges</h2>
<p>Avoid overcrowding the basket—this traps steam and makes wedges soggy. If reheating a large batch, work in smaller portions for the crispiest results. Lightly misting the wedges with oil can revive their texture, especially if they’ve been stored overnight.

<p>If your wedges include dips or sauces, reheat them separately to maintain crispiness. Adding a sprinkle of salt or herbs after reheating can freshen up their flavour. For wedges that are part of a larger meal, like those from our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/potatoes>potatoes category</a>, adjust reheating times based on accompanying ingredients.</p>

<h3>Reheating Wedges from the Fridge vs. Freezer</h3>
<p>Wedges stored in the fridge reheat faster and more evenly than frozen ones. If using frozen wedges, thaw them first for best results, or extend the reheating time by 1–2 minutes. Frozen wedges may need a light coating of oil to prevent dryness. Always check for doneness by testing the centre with a fork.</p>

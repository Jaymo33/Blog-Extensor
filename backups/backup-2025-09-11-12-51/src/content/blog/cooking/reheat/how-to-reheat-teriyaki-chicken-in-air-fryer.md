<p>To reheat teriyaki chicken in an air fryer, set the temperature to 160°C (320°F) and cook for 3–5 minutes until heated through. This method ensures the chicken stays moist while crisping up the glaze, giving you restaurant-quality results from leftovers. Whether you’re using freshly cooked or refrigerated teriyaki chicken, the air fryer is the best appliance for reviving its texture and flavour.</p>  

<h2>Why Use an Air Fryer to Reheat Teriyaki Chicken?</h2>  
<p>An air fryer circulates hot air around the food, which is ideal for reheating teriyaki chicken without drying it out. Unlike microwaving, which can make the chicken rubbery, the air fryer restores crispiness to the glaze while keeping the meat tender. This method is perfect for those who love their teriyaki chicken with a slight crunch, just like when it was first cooked. Plus, it’s quicker than using an oven, making it a go-to for busy weeknights.</p>  

<p>If you’re new to air frying, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipes section</a> for more inspiration on how to make the most of your appliance. From crispy wings to succulent thighs, an air fryer can handle a variety of chicken dishes with ease. Reheating teriyaki chicken is just one of the many ways this versatile gadget can simplify your cooking routine.</p>  

<h3>Best Temperature for Reheating Teriyaki Chicken</h3>  
<p>The ideal temperature to reheat teriyaki chicken in an air fryer is 160°C (320°F). This ensures even heating without burning the sweet glaze. If your air fryer doesn’t have precise temperature control, a medium setting will work just fine. Always preheat the air fryer for 2–3 minutes before adding the chicken to avoid uneven cooking.</p>  

<h2>Step-by-Step Guide to Reheating Teriyaki Chicken</h2>  
<p>Start by placing your leftover teriyaki chicken in the air fryer basket in a single layer. Avoid overcrowding to allow proper air circulation. Cook for 3 minutes, then check the internal temperature with a meat thermometer—it should reach at least 74°C (165°F) for food safety. If needed, add an extra minute or two until fully heated.</p>  

<p>For extra crispiness, lightly spray the chicken with oil before reheating. This helps revive the glaze and adds a satisfying crunch. If you’re reheating a large batch, work in smaller portions to maintain even results.

<h3>How Long to Reheat Teriyaki Chicken in an Air Fryer</h3>  
<p>Reheating teriyaki chicken typically takes 3–5 minutes at 160°C (320°F). Thicker cuts may need an extra minute, while smaller pieces heat faster. Always check the centre of the chicken to ensure it’s piping hot before serving. If reheating from frozen, add 2–3 extra minutes and flip halfway through.</p>  

<h2>Tips for Keeping Teriyaki Chicken Moist</h2>  
<p>To prevent dryness, lightly brush the chicken with leftover teriyaki sauce or a splash of water before reheating. Covering the chicken with foil for the first half of cooking can also help retain moisture. If your air fryer has a reheat preset, use it for foolproof results.

<p>Leftover teriyaki chicken can also be repurposed into salads, wraps, or rice bowls after reheating. The air fryer’s quick cooking time makes it easy to enjoy last night’s dinner in a whole new way. Whether you’re meal prepping or saving leftovers, this method ensures your teriyaki chicken stays delicious.</p>  

<h3>Can You Reheat Teriyaki Chicken from the Fridge?</h3>  
<p>Yes, refrigerated teriyaki chicken reheats beautifully in an air fryer. Let it sit at room temperature for 10 minutes before cooking to ensure even heating. If the chicken was stored with sauce, pat it dry slightly to avoid excess moisture in the air fryer basket. For best results, reheat within 3 days of refrigeration.</p>  

<h2>Common Mistakes to Avoid</h2>  
<p>Overcrowding the basket is the biggest mistake when reheating teriyaki chicken in an air fryer. This leads to uneven heating and soggy results. Another pitfall is skipping the preheat—cold air fryers take longer to cook, which can dry out the chicken. Always use a meat thermometer to confirm the internal temperature reaches at least 74°C (165°F).</p>  

<p>Using too high a temperature can burn the teriyaki glaze before the chicken heats through. Stick to 160°C (320°F) for perfect results.

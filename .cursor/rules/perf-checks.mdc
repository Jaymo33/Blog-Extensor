# Hot-Path Awareness
- If touching loops, DB calls, or rendering, estimate complexity (Big-O) and note bottlenecks.

# Data Access
- Batch where sensible; avoid N+1; add indexes hints if applicable.

# Proof
- Provide a micro-benchmark or reasoning for expected perf impact; include rollback note if perf regresses.

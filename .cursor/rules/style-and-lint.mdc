description: Enforce repo style, linters, and formatters
globs:
  - "**/*.{ts,tsx,js,jsx,py,go,rb}"
---
# Style
- Follow existing repo configs (ESLint/Prettier, Black, gofmt, RuboCop).
- Do not introduce new style tools without approval; reuse config in repo.

# Output
- Only propose code that passes current linters/formatters. If uncertain, include the command to run locally.

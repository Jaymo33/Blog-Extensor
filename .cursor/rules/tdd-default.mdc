# Rule
- Write failing tests before implementation.
- Prefer fast unit tests; add an integration test if behavior crosses boundaries.
- After code, run tests mentally and point to assertions proving each requirement.

# Coverage
- Add tests for at least: happy path, one edge case, one failure path.

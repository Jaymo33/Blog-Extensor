<p>1.5 tablespoons (tbsp) of sunflower oil equals approximately 20 grams (g). This conversion is essential for precise air fryer cooking, ensuring your recipes turn out perfectly every time. Whether you’re frying, roasting, or baking, knowing the exact weight of sunflower oil helps maintain consistency. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we focus on making measurements simple for hassle-free cooking.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate oil measurements matter in air frying</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of oil in your air fryer ensures even cooking and prevents overly greasy or dry results. Sunflower oil, a popular choice for its high smoke point, works well in air fryers but must be measured correctly. Too much oil can lead to splattering, while too little may leave food undercooked. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> simplifies these calculations for all your cooking needs.</p>  

<p>For example, if a recipe calls for 1.5 tbsp of sunflower oil, converting it to grams (20g) ensures precision. This is especially useful when scaling recipes up or down. Many air fryer dishes, like crispy vegetables or chicken wings, rely on the perfect oil balance for texture and flavour. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipes section</a> for more inspiration on oil measurements.</p>  

<h3>How to measure 1.5 tbsp of sunflower oil without scales</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a kitchen scale, you can still measure 1.5 tbsp of sunflower oil accurately. Use a standard tablespoon and fill it level to the brim, then add half another tablespoon. Alternatively, a standard UK tablespoon holds 15ml, so 1.5 tbsp equals 22.5ml. Since sunflower oil weighs roughly 0.9g per ml, this method confirms the 20g estimate.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for 1.5 tbsp of sunflower oil in air fryers</h2>  
<p>Sunflower oil is versatile in air fryers, perfect for roasting potatoes, crisping tofu, or preparing frozen foods. A measured 1.5 tbsp (20g) is often ideal for coating ingredients evenly without excess oil. For example, tossing sweet potato fries in this amount ensures a golden, crispy finish. Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/potatoes>potato recipes</a> for delicious ways to use this measurement.</p>  

<p>Another great use is marinating proteins like chicken or salmon. A light coating of 1.5 tbsp sunflower oil helps spices adhere and promotes even browning.

Remember, keeping your air fryer clean is easier when oil is measured correctly—visit our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning guide</a> for tips.</p>  

<h3>Comparing sunflower oil to other cooking oils</h3>  
<p>Sunflower oil isn’t the only option for air frying—olive, coconut, and rapeseed oil are alternatives. However, their weights per tablespoon vary slightly. For instance, 1.5 tbsp of olive oil weighs around 21g, while coconut oil is closer to 19g. Always adjust measurements based on the oil type to maintain recipe accuracy.</p>

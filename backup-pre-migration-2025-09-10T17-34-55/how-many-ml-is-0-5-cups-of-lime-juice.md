<p>0.5 cups of lime juice equals approximately 118.29 ml. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements can make or break your dish. Whether you’re whipping up a zesty marinade or a tangy dessert, knowing how to convert cups to ml ensures consistency. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we love helping you nail every recipe with accurate measurements.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Lime Juice Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of lime juice is crucial, especially in air fryer cooking. Too little can leave your dish bland, while too much might overpower other flavours. For example, a marinade for <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>air fryer chicken</a> relies on balanced acidity. Lime juice also affects texture in baked goods, so precision is key. Our conversion chart at <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart</a> simplifies this process.</p>  

<p>Measuring lime juice by volume (cups) versus weight (ml) can vary slightly due to density. Freshly squeezed lime juice may differ slightly from bottled versions. For best results, use a liquid measuring cup or a kitchen scale. If you’re adapting a recipe from the US or UK, this conversion ensures you stay on track. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> for inspiration.</p>  

<h3>Tools for Measuring Lime Juice</h3>  
<p>A liquid measuring cup with ml markings is ideal for accuracy. For small quantities like 0.5 cups (118.29 ml), a jug with clear increments helps. If you’re scaling up for batch cooking, like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/meal-prep>meal prep recipes</a>, a digital scale is even better. Always measure at eye level to avoid over- or under-pouring.</p>  

<h2>Converting Other Lime Juice Quantities</h2>  
<p>Need 1 cup of lime juice? That’s roughly 236.59 ml. For ¼ cup, it’s about 59.15 ml. These conversions are handy when adjusting air fryer recipes. If you’re working with frozen lime juice, thaw it first for consistent measurements. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning guide</a> also ensures your tools stay precise.</p>  

<p>For international cooks, note that US and UK cups differ slightly (US cups are 240 ml, UK cups are 284 ml). Most air fryer recipes use US measurements. When in doubt, stick to ml for universal accuracy. Lime juice substitutes, like lemon juice, follow the same conversions.</p>  

<h3>Common Uses for 0.5 Cups of Lime Juice</h3>  
<p>This quantity is perfect for marinades, dressings, or citrus-based desserts. Try it in an air fryer glaze for shrimp or a refreshing sorbet.

Remember, fresh lime juice elevates flavour, so avoid bottled versions when possible.</p>

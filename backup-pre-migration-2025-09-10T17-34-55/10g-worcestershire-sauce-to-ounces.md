<p>10g of Worcestershire sauce equals approximately 0.35 ounces. This conversion is essential for precise cooking, especially when using an air fryer where measurements can make or break a dish. Whether you’re following a recipe from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> or creating your own, knowing how to convert grams to ounces ensures consistency and flavour balance.</p>

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on precise ingredient ratios to achieve the perfect texture and taste. Too much or too little Worcestershire sauce can alter the moisture content and seasoning of your dish. For example, a marinade for air-fried chicken or beef, like those found in our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipes</a>, requires exact measurements to avoid overpowering or underwhelming flavours. Converting 10g of Worcestershire sauce to ounces (0.35 oz) helps maintain this balance.</p>  
<p>Many UK cooks prefer using grams, but some recipes, especially older or international ones, list ingredients in ounces. Having a reliable conversion method ensures you never have to guess. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> can help with other common measurements, making cooking even easier.</p>  

<h3>How to measure Worcestershire sauce without scales</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a kitchen scale, you can still measure 10g (0.35 oz) of Worcestershire sauce using teaspoons. One teaspoon holds roughly 5g, so 10g would be about two level teaspoons. However, for sticky liquids like Worcestershire sauce, it’s best to use a measuring spoon designed for liquids to avoid inaccuracies. This method is handy when preparing small batches of sauces or glazes for air-fried dishes like mushrooms or tofu.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for Worcestershire sauce in air fryer recipes</h2>  
<p>Worcestershire sauce adds depth to many air fryer dishes, from meats to vegetables. A 10g (0.35 oz) portion is often used in marinades for air-fried steak, as seen in our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/beef>beef recipes</a>, or brushed onto roasted vegetables for extra umami. Its bold flavour enhances dishes without overwhelming other ingredients when measured correctly.</p>  
<p>You might also use 10g of Worcestershire sauce in a glaze for air-fried salmon or mixed seafood. The key is balancing it with other ingredients like honey or soy sauce. For more inspiration, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a>, which includes plenty of dishes where precise Worcestershire sauce measurements shine.</p>  

<h3>Storing Worcestershire sauce for long-term use</h3>  
<p>To keep Worcestershire sauce fresh, store it in a cool, dark place like a cupboard. Once opened, it lasts about 1-2 years. If you’re using small amounts like 10g (0.35 oz) at a time, ensure the bottle is tightly sealed to prevent evaporation or flavour loss. This way, your air fryer recipes will always have that signature tangy kick.</p>

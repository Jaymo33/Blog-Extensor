<p>4 tablespoons (tbsp) of water equals exactly 60 grams (g) in UK measurements. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precision matters, ensuring your dishes turn out perfectly every time. Whether you’re baking, steaming, or adjusting liquid ingredients, knowing this measurement can make all the difference.</p>

<h2>Why accurate water measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>
<p>Air fryers rely on precise ingredient ratios to achieve the best results, especially when baking or steaming. Too much or too little water can affect texture, cooking time, and even safety. For example, adding excess water to a batter might make it too runny, while too little could dry out your dish. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we emphasise the importance of accurate conversions like 4 tbsp water to grams to help you avoid these pitfalls.</p>
<p>Many air fryer recipes, such as cakes or steamed vegetables, require specific water measurements. Converting 4 tbsp of water into grams ensures consistency, whether you’re following a recipe from our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipes</a> section or experimenting with your own creations. This small detail can elevate your cooking from good to great.</p>

<h2>How to measure 4 tbsp of water accurately</h2>
<p>Using a standard UK tablespoon, fill it to the brim without spilling for an exact 15ml measure. Since 1 tbsp of water weighs 15g, multiplying by 4 gives you the 60g total. For best results, use a digital kitchen scale to verify the weight, especially for baking recipes where precision is key.</p>
<p>If you don’t have a scale, levelling off each tablespoon with a knife ensures consistency. Avoid heaped tablespoons, as this can skew the measurement. For more tips on perfecting your air fryer measurements, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>

<h3>Common uses for 4 tbsp of water in air fryer recipes</h3>
<p>This measurement often appears in recipes like steamed buns, cake batters, or marinades. For instance, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>cake recipes</a> frequently call for 4 tbsp of water to achieve the ideal batter consistency. It’s also useful for rehydrating dried ingredients or adjusting sauce thickness.</p>

<h2>Converting other tablespoon measurements to grams</h2>
<p>While 4 tbsp of water is 60g, other liquids like oil or milk have different densities. Always refer to a reliable conversion chart for non-water liquids. For example, 4 tbsp of olive oil weighs about 54g due to its lower density. This distinction is crucial for air fryer recipes where fat content affects cooking times and results.</p>
<p>If you’re working with ingredients beyond water, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a> covers all the common measurements you’ll need. Bookmark it for quick reference during your cooking sessions.</p>

<h3>Tips for measuring small quantities in your air fryer</h3>
<p>For amounts smaller than 4 tbsp, use measuring spoons or a syringe for precision. Even a few grams can make a difference in air fryer cooking, where evaporation rates are higher than in conventional ovens. Keeping your <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer clean</a> also ensures accurate temperature control, which affects how liquids behave during cooking.</p>

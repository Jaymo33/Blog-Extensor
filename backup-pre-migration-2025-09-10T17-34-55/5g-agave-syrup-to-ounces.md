<h3>How to Measure 5g of Agave Syrup Without Scales</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a kitchen scale, you can use a teaspoon to approximate 5g of agave syrup. One level teaspoon holds roughly 5g (or 0.18 ounces) of liquid sweeteners. For sticky ingredients like agave syrup, lightly grease the spoon for easy pouring.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for 5g of Agave Syrup in Air Fryer Recipes</h2>  
<p>Agave syrup is a versatile sweetener in air fryer cooking. From glazing chicken wings to sweetening baked goods, 5g (0.18 ounces) can add just the right touch of sweetness. Try it in our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> for balanced flavours.</p>  

<p>For a quick snack, mix 5g of agave syrup with soy sauce for a sticky glaze on air-fried tofu. Or drizzle it over roasted vegetables for a caramelised finish. The possibilities are endless when you know how many ounces is 5g of agave syrup.</p>  

<h3>Converting Other Sweeteners: Agave vs. Honey vs. Maple Syrup</h3>  
<p>Different sweeteners have varying densities, so 5g won’t always equal 0.18 ounces. For example, honey is thicker than agave syrup, while maple syrup is slightly runnier. Always adjust measurements based on the sweetener you’re using.</p>  

<h2>Tips for Storing and Handling Agave Syrup</h2>  
<p>To keep agave syrup fresh, store it in a cool, dark place. After measuring out 5g (0.18 ounces), wipe the bottle’s neck to prevent stickiness. For more kitchen hacks, visit <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>.</p>  

<p>If your agave syrup crystallises, gently warm the bottle in warm water to restore its smooth texture. This ensures accurate measurements when converting 5g of agave syrup to ounces for your next air fryer creation.</p>  

<h3>Scaling Up: Converting Larger Amounts of Agave Syrup</h3>  
<p>Need more than 5g? Simply multiply the conversion—for example, 10g of agave syrup equals 0.35 ounces. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning guide</a> also helps maintain your air fryer after sticky recipes.</p>

<p>1.25 cups of golden syrup equals approximately 10.6 ounces (or 10.58 oz to be precise). This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements can make or break your dish. Whether you're baking a sticky toffee pudding or glazing roasted vegetables, knowing the exact weight ensures consistency. Golden syrup, a staple in British baking, has a thick, sticky consistency, so measuring by weight is often more reliable than volume. For more air fryer conversions, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>  

<h2>Why measure golden syrup in ounces?</h2>  
<p>Measuring golden syrup in ounces rather than cups ensures accuracy, especially in air fryer cooking where small quantities matter. Volume measurements can vary due to factors like temperature and how the syrup settles in the cup. Weight, on the other hand, provides a consistent result every time. This is particularly useful for recipes like flapjacks or glazes, where the syrup's thickness affects texture. If you're new to air fryer baking, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a> has plenty of ideas to get you started.</p>  

<p>Golden syrup is denser than water, so 1.25 cups won't weigh the same as 1.25 cups of a thinner liquid. This is why converting cups to ounces is so helpful—it accounts for density differences. For example, 1.25 cups of water would weigh about 10 ounces, but golden syrup weighs slightly more due to its viscosity. Always use a kitchen scale for the most precise results, especially when working with sticky ingredients.</p>  

<h3>How to measure golden syrup accurately</h3>  
<p>To measure 1.25 cups of golden syrup, lightly grease your measuring cup with oil to help the syrup slide out easily. Fill the cup to the 1.25 mark, then level it off with a spatula. Alternatively, weigh it directly on a kitchen scale for the most accurate result. If you're scaling up a recipe, remember that 1.25 cups of golden syrup is roughly 10.6 ounces.

<h2>Common uses for golden syrup in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Golden syrup adds a rich, caramel-like sweetness to air fryer dishes, from desserts to savoury glazes. It's perfect for drizzling over air-fried apples or brushing onto pork chops for a sticky finish. Because it’s so thick, it helps create a glossy coating that caramelises beautifully in the air fryer. If you're making a batch of air fryer cookies, golden syrup can replace honey or corn syrup for a deeper flavour. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>cake recipes</a> for more inspiration.</p>  

<p>Another great use for golden syrup is in marinades, where it balances salty and spicy flavours. A mix of soy sauce, ginger, and golden syrup makes a fantastic glaze for air-fried chicken wings. Since the air fryer circulates heat evenly, the syrup caramelises without burning. Just remember to measure carefully—1.25 cups of golden syrup equals 10.6 ounces—to avoid overly sweet or sticky results. For cleaning sticky residues, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner guide</a> has handy tips.</p>  

<h3>Converting other golden syrup measurements</h3>  
<p>If your recipe calls for a different amount of golden syrup, here’s a quick reference: 1 cup = 8.5 ounces, ½ cup = 4.25 ounces, and 2 cups = 17 ounces. These conversions are handy when adjusting portion sizes or scaling recipes for your air fryer. Always double-check measurements, especially when substituting golden syrup for other sweeteners like honey or maple syrup. Their weights can differ slightly, affecting the final dish.</p>

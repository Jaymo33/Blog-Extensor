<h2>How to Measure 425 Grams of Olive Oil Without Scales</h2>

<h3>Using a Measuring Jug</h3>

<h3>Adjusting for UK and US Cup Sizes</h3>
<p>Note that UK and US cup sizes differ slightly. In the UK, 425 grams of olive oil is roughly 1.9 UK cups, while in the US, it’s about 1.8 cups. Always double-check your recipe’s origin to avoid discrepancies.</p>

<h2>Common Mistakes When Measuring Olive Oil</h2>

For precision, always use the correct tools and follow our guide for 425 grams of olive oil in cups.</p>
<p>Storing olive oil properly also affects its density. Keep it in a cool, dark place to maintain consistency. This ensures that your 425-gram measurement remains accurate every time you cook.</p>

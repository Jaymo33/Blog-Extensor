<p>35 ml of tomato sauce equals approximately 0.15 cups. This conversion is handy when following air fryer recipes that require precise measurements. Whether you're whipping up a quick pasta sauce or a delicious air fryer pizza, knowing how to convert millilitres to cups ensures your dish turns out just right.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Precision is key when using an air fryer, as ingredients cook faster and more evenly. Too much or too little tomato sauce can affect texture and flavour. For example, adding 35 ml of tomato sauce (0.15 cups) to a <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>homemade air fryer pizza</a> ensures the base isn't soggy. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for other common measurements.</p>  

<p>Many air fryer recipes, like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken dishes</a>, call for small amounts of sauce for marinating or glazing. Measuring 35 ml of tomato sauce correctly helps avoid overpowering flavours. A kitchen scale or measuring jug can simplify the process, especially for frequent air fryer users.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure 35 ml of Tomato Sauce Without a Scale</h3>  
<p>If you don't have a measuring jug, use a tablespoon—1 tablespoon holds about 15 ml, so 35 ml is roughly 2 tablespoons plus 1 teaspoon. For thicker sauces, like tomato paste, 35 ml might weigh slightly more, so adjust accordingly. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner guide</a> also helps keep your tools spotless for accurate measurements.</p>  

<h2>Common Recipes Using 35 ml of Tomato Sauce</h2>  
<p>Many air fryer recipes, such as <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>stuffed peppers</a>, use 35 ml of tomato sauce for filling or drizzling. This small amount adds richness without making the dish too wet. For a quick snack, try brushing 35 ml (0.15 cups) of sauce on air fryer garlic bread.</p>  

<p>When making air fryer meatballs, 35 ml of tomato sauce can be mixed into the meat or used as a glaze. This measurement ensures even cooking and prevents excess moisture. For more inspiration, browse our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a> tailored for air fryer enthusiasts.</p>  

<h3>Converting 35 ml of Tomato Sauce for Different Dishes</h3>  
<p>If a recipe calls for 35 ml of tomato sauce per serving, scale it up for larger batches. For example, four servings would need 140 ml (about 0.6 cups). Always stir the sauce well before measuring to ensure consistency, especially for air fryer cooking where even distribution matters.</p>

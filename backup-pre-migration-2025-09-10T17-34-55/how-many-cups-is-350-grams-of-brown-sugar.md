<p>350 grams of brown sugar is roughly equivalent to 1.75 cups when lightly packed. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes, where precise measurements can make or break your dish. Whether you're whipping up a cake or a savoury glaze, knowing how to convert grams to cups ensures consistency. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we focus on making cooking conversions effortless for home chefs.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of brown sugar can affect texture, moisture, and browning in air fryer recipes. Too much sugar can lead to over-caramelisation, while too little may leave your dish lacking sweetness. For example, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer cookie recipes</a> rely on precise sugar measurements for the perfect chewiness. Brown sugar, in particular, adds moisture due to its molasses content, so accuracy is key.</p>  

<p>If you're converting 350 grams of brown sugar to cups, always consider whether the sugar is loosely or tightly packed. Lightly packed brown sugar will yield around 1.75 cups, while firmly packed may be closer to 1.5 cups. For more conversions, check our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure Brown Sugar Correctly</h3>  
<p>To measure 350 grams of brown sugar in cups, spoon the sugar into a measuring cup and level it off without pressing down too hard. This ensures consistency, especially for air fryer baking. If your recipe calls for tightly packed sugar, gently press it down before levelling. For best results, use a kitchen scale when possible.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for 350 Grams of Brown Sugar</h2>  
<p>This measurement is perfect for larger batches of air fryer desserts like sticky toffee pudding or glazes for meats. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert category</a> features several recipes where 350 grams of brown sugar shines. It’s also ideal for marinades or rubs, adding depth to dishes like air-fried ribs or pulled pork.</p>  

<p>If you're prepping ahead, storing brown sugar properly ensures it stays fresh. Keep it in an airtight container to prevent hardening. For more storage tips, visit our guide on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer maintenance</a>.</p>  

<h3>Converting Between UK and US Measurements</h3>  
<p>In the UK, cup measurements can vary slightly from US standards. For 350 grams of brown sugar, the difference is minimal, but it’s worth noting for precision. Most UK recipes use weight measurements, so investing in a scale is helpful. If you're adapting a US recipe, stick to lightly packed cups unless specified otherwise.</p>  

<h2>Tips for Baking with Brown Sugar in an Air Fryer</h2>  
<p>Brown sugar caramelises faster in an air fryer due to concentrated heat. To avoid burning, reduce cooking time slightly or lower the temperature by 10°C. For even baking, rotate trays halfway through. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>cake recipes</a> include adjusted timings for air fryer success.</p>  

<p>If your brown sugar has hardened, revive it by microwaving with a damp paper towel for 20 seconds. This ensures accurate measuring for your 350-gram conversions. Always let it cool before using it in recipes.</p>

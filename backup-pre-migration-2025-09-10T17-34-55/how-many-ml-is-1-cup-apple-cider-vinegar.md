<p>1.0 cups of apple cider vinegar equals 240 millilitres (ml). This standard conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements can make or break a dish. Whether you're marinating chicken, whipping up a tangy glaze, or baking, knowing how many ml is 1.0 cups of apple cider vinegar ensures consistency. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we prioritise accuracy to help you achieve perfect results every time.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on even heat distribution, and incorrect liquid measurements can affect texture and cooking times. Using 240 ml of apple cider vinegar instead of eyeballing 1.0 cups ensures marinades penetrate evenly or sauces reduce properly. For example, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer chicken recipes</a> often call for apple cider vinegar to tenderise meat, and precise quantities prevent overpowering flavours.</p>  

<p>Conversions like 1.0 cups of apple cider vinegar in ml also matter for baking. Too much liquid can make batters runny, while too little may dry out cakes. Check our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a> for other common ingredients to avoid guesswork.</p>  

<h3>UK vs. US Cup Measurements</h3>  
<p>While 1.0 UK cups equal 284 ml, most recipes (including those on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>) use the US standard of 240 ml per cup. Always confirm which measurement system your recipe follows to avoid discrepancies. For apple cider vinegar, 1.0 cups in the USA translates directly to 240 ml.</p>  

<h2>How to Measure Apple Cider Vinegar Without a Cup</h2>  
<p>No measuring cups? Use a metric jug to measure 240 ml of apple cider vinegar directly. Alternatively, 16 tablespoons equal 1.0 cups (240 ml), making spoons a handy backup. For sticky ingredients like vinegar, lightly grease the spoon for cleaner pouring.</p>  

<p>Prefer weight? Apple cider vinegar’s density means 1.0 cups (240 ml) weighs roughly 239 grams. A kitchen scale simplifies conversions, especially for recipes like our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>air-fried vegetable dishes</a>, where balance is key.</p>  

<h3>Common Uses for 1.0 Cups of Apple Cider Vinegar</h3>  
<p>From marinades to pickling, 240 ml of apple cider vinegar adds tang and tenderness. Try it in air fryer pulled pork or to deglaze pans for sauces. Its acidity also helps clean air fryer baskets—see our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning guide</a> for tips.</p>

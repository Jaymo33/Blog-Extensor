<h3>How to Measure Fish Sauce Correctly</h3>  
<p>When converting 3 cups of fish sauce to oz, use a liquid measuring cup for accuracy. Pour the sauce to the 3-cup mark, then check the equivalent in fluid ounces (24 fl oz). Avoid using dry measuring cups, as they won’t give you the correct volume. This method works for all liquid ingredients in air fryer cooking, from marinades to sauces.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for 3 Cups of Fish Sauce in Air Fryer Recipes</h2>  
<p>Three cups of fish sauce (24 fl oz) is a generous amount, perfect for batch cooking or meal prep. You might use it to marinate a large quantity of chicken thighs or tofu for air frying. Alternatively, it’s ideal for making dipping sauces to accompany air-fried shrimp or vegetables. Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipes</a> for ideas on how to use fish sauce in marinades.</p>  

<p>Another great use for 3 cups of fish sauce is in seasoning mixes for air-fried dishes like crispy pork belly or stir-fried noodles. The 24-fluid-ounce quantity ensures you have enough for multiple servings.

<h3>Tips for Storing Leftover Fish Sauce</h3>  
<p>If you’ve measured out 3 cups of fish sauce (24 fl oz) but don’t use it all, store the remainder in an airtight container in the fridge. Fish sauce keeps well for months, so you can use it later for other air fryer recipes. Always label the container with the date to keep track of freshness.</p>

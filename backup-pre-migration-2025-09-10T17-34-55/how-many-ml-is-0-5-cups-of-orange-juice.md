<p>0.5 cups of orange juice equals approximately 118 ml, making it easy to measure for your air fryer recipes. Whether you're whipping up a marinade, glaze, or baking a citrus-infused dessert, knowing this conversion ensures accuracy. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we understand how precise measurements can elevate your cooking, especially when working with air fryers.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>
<p>Air fryers rely on even heat distribution, so using the right amount of liquid, like orange juice, ensures consistent results. Too much liquid can lead to soggy textures, while too little might dry out your dish. For example, a marinade with 0.5 cups of orange juice (118 ml) perfectly coats chicken or salmon without overpowering. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipes</a> section for inspiration on using citrus in your air fryer.</p>
<p>Many air fryer recipes, like glazed carrots or orange-infused cakes, call for small amounts of juice. Measuring 0.5 cups of orange juice in millilitres helps avoid guesswork. This precision is especially useful for baking, where exact ratios affect texture and rise. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a> simplifies these adjustments for hassle-free cooking.</p>

<h2>How to Measure 0.5 Cups of Orange Juice Correctly</h2>
<p>For the most accurate conversion of 0.5 cups of orange juice to ml, use a liquid measuring cup with millilitre markings. Fill it to the 118 ml line, or measure half a standard UK cup (284 ml total) for consistency. Freshly squeezed or store-bought orange juice both work, though fresh juice may offer brighter flavour for dishes like air-fried citrus shrimp.</p>
<p>If you don’t have a measuring cup, a kitchen scale can help. Since orange juice has a similar density to water, 118 ml weighs roughly 118 grams. This method is handy for recipes where precision is key, such as our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>citrus cake</a> collection. Always stir the juice before measuring to ensure uniformity.</p>

<h3>UK vs. US Cup Measurements for Orange Juice</h3>
<p>While 0.5 UK cups of orange juice equal 142 ml, the US standard (used in most recipes) is 118 ml. Always check the recipe origin to avoid discrepancies. For air fryer cooking, sticking to one measurement system—like ml—eliminates confusion. Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert recipes</a> to see ml measurements in action for foolproof results.</p>

<h2>Common Uses for 0.5 Cups of Orange Juice in Air Fryers</h2>
<p>From marinades to glazes, 0.5 cups (118 ml) of orange juice adds tangy sweetness to air fryer dishes. Try it in a honey-orange glaze for chicken wings or as a base for salmon fillets. The acidity also helps tenderise meats while adding moisture during cooking. For cleaning, a mix of orange juice and baking soda can even help remove stubborn grease from your air fryer basket—visit our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning guide</a> for tips.</p>
<p>In baking, 118 ml of orange juice lends moisture to cakes and muffins without making them dense. It pairs beautifully with spices like cinnamon or cardamom in air-fried desserts. Whether you're cooking mains or sweets, this measurement is a versatile staple in any air fryer enthusiast’s kitchen.</p>

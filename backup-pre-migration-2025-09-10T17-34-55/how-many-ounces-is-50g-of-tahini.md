<p>50g of tahini equals approximately 1.76 ounces. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precision matters, especially when making sauces, dressings, or marinades. Whether you're following a recipe from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> or creating your own, knowing how to convert grams to ounces ensures consistency. Tahini, a staple in Middle Eastern cuisine, adds richness to dishes, and measuring it correctly can make all the difference.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of tahini ensures your dishes have the perfect texture and flavour. Too much can make sauces overly thick, while too little might leave them lacking depth. Air fryers cook quickly, so precise measurements help avoid under or over-seasoning. For more conversion tips, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> to streamline your cooking process. Whether you're making hummus or drizzling tahini over roasted vegetables, accuracy is key.</p>  

<p>Many UK recipes use grams, while others prefer ounces, so knowing both systems is handy. If you're experimenting with <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a>, having a reliable conversion method saves time. Tahini’s nutty flavour enhances everything from dips to desserts, so getting the measurement right ensures delicious results. A digital kitchen scale is the best tool for accuracy, but if you don’t have one, our guide helps you approximate.</p>  

<h3>How to measure tahini without scales</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a scale, you can use tablespoons to measure tahini. One tablespoon of tahini weighs roughly 15g, so 50g would be just over three tablespoons. However, tahini’s thick consistency means it’s best to stir it well before measuring for accuracy. For sticky ingredients like tahini, a silicone spatula helps scrape every bit from the spoon. This method isn’t as precise as weighing but works in a pinch for most <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable-based recipes</a>.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for tahini in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Tahini is incredibly versatile in air fryer recipes, from marinades to dressings. It pairs perfectly with roasted chickpeas, adding a creamy texture and nutty flavour. You can also mix it with lemon juice and garlic for a quick sauce to drizzle over air-fried salmon or chicken. For dessert lovers, tahini works wonders in air-fried banana bites or drizzled over baked apples. Explore more ideas in our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert category</a> for sweet and savoury inspiration.</p>  

<p>Cleaning your air fryer after using tahini-based recipes is simple with the right tools. A quick wipe with <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner</a> ensures no sticky residue remains. Tahini’s high oil content can leave a film, so regular maintenance keeps your appliance in top condition. Whether you're a tahini enthusiast or new to this ingredient, precise measurements and proper cleaning make air fryer cooking effortless.</p>

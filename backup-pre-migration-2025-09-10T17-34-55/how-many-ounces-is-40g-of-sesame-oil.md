<p>40g of sesame oil equals approximately 1.41 ounces. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements can make all the difference. Whether you’re whipping up a marinade or drizzling sesame oil over veggies, knowing the exact weight ensures perfect results every time. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we’re all about making cooking easier, and this simple conversion is just one way we help.</p>

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>
<p>When using an air fryer, even small variations in ingredient quantities can affect texture and flavour. Sesame oil, with its rich, nutty taste, is often used in small amounts, so getting the measurement right is crucial. Too much can overpower a dish, while too little might leave it lacking. Converting 40g of sesame oil to ounces ensures you’re using the perfect amount for recipes like stir-fries, dressings, or marinades. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more handy tips.</p>

<p>Many air fryer recipes, especially those for Asian-inspired dishes, call for sesame oil. Whether you’re making crispy tofu or glazed salmon, knowing that 40g of sesame oil is 1.41 ounces helps you follow recipes accurately. This precision is especially helpful when scaling recipes up or down. For more recipe ideas, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/tofu>tofu recipes</a> or <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/salmon>salmon dishes</a>.</p>

<h2>How to measure sesame oil for air fryer recipes</h2>
<p>Measuring sesame oil by weight (grams) is more accurate than using volume (millilitres or fluid ounces), as oils can vary in density. If your kitchen scales measure in ounces, knowing that 40g of sesame oil is 1.41 ounces ensures you’re adding the right amount. This is particularly important for air fryer cooking, where even distribution of oil affects crispiness and browning. A digital scale is a worthwhile investment for any air fryer enthusiast.</p>

<h3>Converting other amounts of sesame oil</h3>
<p>If your recipe calls for a different amount of sesame oil, the same conversion principle applies. For example, 20g would be 0.71 ounces, and 100g would be 3.53 ounces. Keeping these conversions in mind makes adapting recipes effortless. For more air fryer measurement tips, visit <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>.</p>

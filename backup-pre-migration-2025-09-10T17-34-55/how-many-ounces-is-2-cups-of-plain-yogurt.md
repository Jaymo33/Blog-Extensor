<p>2 cups of plain yogurt equals approximately 16 ounces (or 1 pound) in weight. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements can make or break a dish. Whether you’re making marinades, dips, or baked goods, knowing how many ounces are in 2 cups of plain yogurt ensures consistency. For more air fryer measurement tips, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate yogurt measurements matter</h2>  
<p>Using the correct amount of yogurt in air fryer recipes ensures the right texture and moisture level. Too much yogurt can make dishes soggy, while too little might leave them dry. For example, if you’re making <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer chicken marinades</a>, 16 ounces of yogurt (2 cups) is often ideal for tenderising. Measuring by weight (ounces) is more precise than volume (cups), especially for thick ingredients like yogurt.</p>  

<p>Many UK recipes use metric measurements, but ounces are still common in air fryer cooking. If you’re converting from grams, 16 ounces is roughly 454 grams. Always use a kitchen scale for accuracy, especially when preparing <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>air fryer desserts</a> where balance is key.</p>  

<h3>How to measure 2 cups of plain yogurt</h3>  
<p>To measure 2 cups of plain yogurt accurately, use a liquid measuring cup for thinner yogurt or a dry measuring cup for thicker varieties. Level off the top with a straight edge for consistency. If you don’t have measuring cups, 16 fluid ounces (by volume) or 16 weight ounces will give you the equivalent. For more tips, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning and maintenance guide</a> to keep your tools precise.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for 2 cups of plain yogurt in air fryers</h2>  
<p>Two cups (16 ounces) of plain yogurt is a versatile ingredient in air fryer cooking. It’s perfect for marinating meats, making creamy dips, or even baking. For instance, a <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken tikka recipe</a> might call for 2 cups of yogurt to tenderise the meat. Yogurt also works well in batter for air-fried veggies or as a base for sauces.</p>  

<p>If you’re meal prepping, 16 ounces of yogurt can be portioned into smaller servings for snacks or breakfasts. Pair it with <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/breakfast>air fryer granola</a> for a quick, healthy option. Remember, thicker yogurts (like Greek yogurt) may weigh slightly more per cup, so adjust accordingly.</p>  

<h3>Converting 2 cups of plain yogurt to other measurements</h3>  
<p>If your recipe uses different units, here’s how 2 cups (16 ounces) of plain yogurt converts: 1 pint, 473 millilitres, or 454 grams. For smaller batches, half a cup is 4 ounces, and a quarter cup is 2 ounces. These conversions are handy when scaling recipes up or down for your air fryer.</p>

<p>400 grams of rice equals approximately 2 cups in the UK and 2.1 cups in the US. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes, where precise measurements ensure even cooking. Whether you're making a quick rice dish or a baked treat, knowing how to convert grams to cups will save you time and hassle.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Rice Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Cooking rice in an air fryer requires precision to avoid undercooked or mushy results. Using the correct amount of rice ensures even heat distribution and perfect texture. For example, if you're making a <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>rice-based air fryer recipe</a>, 400 grams of rice is a common quantity. Too much or too little can throw off the cooking time and moisture balance.</p>  

<p>Different types of rice, like basmati or jasmine, may have slight variations in volume per gram. However, the standard conversion for 400 grams of rice to cups remains consistent for most long-grain varieties. If you're unsure, check our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for other common measurements.</p>  

<h3>UK vs. US Cup Measurements</h3>  
<p>In the UK, 1 cup of rice typically equals 200 grams, meaning 400 grams is 2 cups. In the US, a cup is slightly smaller at about 190 grams, so 400 grams is roughly 2.1 cups. This small difference can affect recipes, especially when scaling up for meal prep or larger batches.</p>  

<h2>How to Measure 400 Grams of Rice Without Scales</h2>  
<p>If you don’t have kitchen scales, you can still measure 400 grams of rice using standard cups. Fill a UK measuring cup to the brim twice, or use a US cup and add an extra tablespoon for accuracy. This method works well for most <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/meal-prep>meal prep recipes</a> where precision is key.</p>  

<p>For best results, fluff the rice before measuring to avoid compacting it. Packed rice can lead to inaccurate measurements and affect cooking times. If you're using an air fryer, spread the rice evenly in the basket for consistent results.</p>  

<h3>Adjusting Air Fryer Recipes for Rice</h3>  
<p>When converting stovetop rice recipes for the air fryer, 400 grams of rice usually requires slightly less liquid. The air fryer’s circulating heat cooks rice faster and more evenly, so reduce water or broth by about 10-15%. This adjustment ensures your rice doesn’t turn out soggy.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for 400 Grams of Rice</h2>  
<p>400 grams of rice is perfect for making 4-6 servings of fried rice, pilaf, or rice pudding in the air fryer. It’s also a great base for <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable-packed rice dishes</a>. Whether you’re cooking for one or meal prepping, this quantity is versatile and easy to scale.</p>  

<p>For crispy rice dishes, like air-fried rice cakes or arancini, 400 grams provides enough volume to form patties or balls. Just ensure your air fryer basket is large enough to accommodate the portions without overcrowding.</p>  

<h3>Storing Cooked Rice from 400 Grams</h3>  
<p>Cooked rice from 400 grams of dry rice yields about 6-8 cups, ideal for leftovers. Store it in airtight containers in the fridge for up to 3 days, or freeze for longer shelf life. Reheat in the air fryer at 160°C for 5-7 minutes for best texture.</p>

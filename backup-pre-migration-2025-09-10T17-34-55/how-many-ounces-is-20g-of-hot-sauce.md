<p>20 grams of hot sauce equals approximately 0.71 ounces. This conversion is handy for air fryer recipes where precise measurements matter. Whether you’re drizzling hot sauce over wings or mixing it into a marinade, knowing the exact weight ensures consistent flavour.

<h2>Why Convert 20g of Hot Sauce to Ounces?</h2>  
<p>Many UK recipes use grams, while others reference ounces, making conversions essential. Hot sauce can vary in thickness, so measuring by weight ensures accuracy. Air fryer recipes, like crispy chicken or spicy tofu, often need precise amounts to balance heat. Overdoing it could ruin a dish, while too little might leave it bland. Visit <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>our recipe hub</a> for perfectly spiced air fryer meals.</p>  

<p>Converting 20g of hot sauce to ounces is simple with a digital scale. If you don’t have one, remember that 1 ounce equals roughly 28.35 grams. This means 20g is just under three-quarters of an ounce. For more tips on measuring ingredients, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning and maintenance guides</a> to keep your air fryer in top shape.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure Hot Sauce for Air Fryer Recipes</h3>  
<p>Using a kitchen scale is the most accurate way to measure 20g of hot sauce. If you’re working without one, a standard teaspoon holds about 5g, so four teaspoons would be close. For thicker sauces, like sriracha, a tablespoon might weigh around 15g. Adjust accordingly to hit the 20g mark. Need inspiration?

<h2>Common Uses for 20g of Hot Sauce</h2>  
<p>Twenty grams of hot sauce is perfect for marinating chicken wings or tofu before air frying. It’s also ideal for drizzling over nachos or mixing into dips. Since air fryers cook quickly, the sauce’s heat intensifies, so measure carefully. For milder dishes, dilute the sauce with a bit of oil or honey.

<p>Hot sauce can also be brushed onto shrimp or salmon fillets before air frying. Twenty grams provides enough flavour without overwhelming the dish. If you’re meal prepping, scale up the recipe while keeping the 20g-per-serving ratio.

<h3>Tips for Storing Hot Sauce</h3>  
<p>Once opened, hot sauce lasts about six months in the fridge. To preserve its flavour, store it in a cool, dark place. If you’ve measured out 20g and have leftovers, transfer them to a small airtight container. Avoid cross-contamination by using clean utensils each time.

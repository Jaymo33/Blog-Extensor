<p>2.5 tablespoons (tbsp) of sunflower oil weighs approximately 34 grams (g). This conversion is essential for air fryer cooking, where precise measurements can make or break a recipe. Whether you’re whipping up crispy chips or a succulent roast, knowing the exact weight ensures perfect results every time.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate oil measurements matter in air fryers</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on hot air circulation to cook food, and too much oil can lead to soggy results. Measuring 2.5 tbsp of sunflower oil in grams (34g) helps maintain the right balance. For recipes like roasted vegetables or homemade crisps, this precision ensures a crispy texture without excess grease. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more handy measurement tips.</p>  

<p>Sunflower oil is a popular choice for air frying due to its high smoke point and neutral flavour. Whether you’re following a recipe from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> or experimenting with your own creations, accurate conversions like 2.5 tbsp to grams are crucial. Too little oil, and your food may dry out; too much, and it won’t crisp properly.</p>  

<h3>How to measure 2.5 tbsp of sunflower oil without scales</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a kitchen scale, use a standard UK tablespoon (15ml) to measure sunflower oil. Fill it to the brim twice, then half-fill a third spoon to reach 2.5 tbsp (37.5ml total). While this method isn’t as precise as weighing 34 grams, it works in a pinch for most air fryer recipes.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for 2.5 tbsp sunflower oil in air fryers</h2>  
<p>Many air fryer recipes call for around 2.5 tbsp (34g) of sunflower oil. This amount is perfect for coating a batch of homemade chips or seasoning a tray of mixed vegetables. For inspiration, browse our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> collection, featuring everything from crispy chicken to golden roast potatoes.</p>  

<p>When preparing frozen foods like onion rings or fries, 2.5 tbsp of sunflower oil (34g) helps achieve that irresistible crunch. Spread it evenly using a pastry brush or spray bottle for best results. Remember, air fryers need less oil than traditional frying, so sticking to precise measurements like this prevents greasy outcomes.</p>  

<h3>Sunflower oil alternatives at 2.5 tbsp (34g)</h3>  
<p>If you’re out of sunflower oil, rapeseed or vegetable oil can substitute at the same 2.5 tbsp (34g) measurement. Avoid heavier oils like olive oil for air frying, as they can smoke at high temperatures.

<h2>Cleaning your air fryer after using sunflower oil</h2>  
<p>After cooking with 2.5 tbsp of sunflower oil (34g), residue can build up in your air fryer basket. Regular cleaning maintains performance and prevents smoke. Our guide on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner</a> methods makes maintenance a breeze.</p>  

<p>For stubborn oil stains from measurements like 2.5 tbsp (34g), a mixture of warm water and baking soda works wonders. Always ensure your air fryer is completely dry before next use to avoid rust or electrical issues. Proper care extends your appliance’s lifespan and ensures consistent cooking results.</p>

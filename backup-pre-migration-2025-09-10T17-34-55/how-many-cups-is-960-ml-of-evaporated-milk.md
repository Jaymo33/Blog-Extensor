<p>960 ml of evaporated milk is equal to approximately 4.06 cups in the US and 3.38 cups in the UK. This conversion is essential for baking and cooking, especially when using an air fryer for recipes that call for precise measurements. Whether you're making a creamy dessert or a savoury dish, knowing how to convert 960 ml of evaporated milk to cups ensures accuracy.</p>  

<h2>Understanding Evaporated Milk Measurements</h2>  
<p>Evaporated milk is a staple in many recipes, from custards to casseroles. When a recipe lists 960 ml of evaporated milk, it's crucial to know the equivalent in cups, especially if you're using an air fryer. The difference between US and UK cup measurements can affect the outcome of your dish. For example, a US cup holds 240 ml, while a UK cup holds 284 ml. This means 960 ml of evaporated milk converts to roughly 4.06 US cups or 3.38 UK cups.</p>  

<p>If you're working with an air fryer, precise measurements matter even more. Too much or too little liquid can alter cooking times and textures. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more handy measurement conversions. Whether you're baking a cake or preparing a creamy sauce, getting the measurements right ensures perfect results every time.</p>  

<h3>Why Accuracy Matters in Air Fryer Cooking</h3>  
<p>Air fryers rely on circulating hot air to cook food evenly, and liquid measurements play a big role in this. Using the correct amount of evaporated milk ensures your dishes have the right consistency. For example, adding too much milk to a batter can make it too runny, while too little can leave it dry. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a> includes plenty of dishes where evaporated milk is key, so accurate conversions are a must.</p>  

<h2>Converting 960 ml of Evaporated Milk for Baking</h2>  
<p>Baking is a science, and measurements need to be precise. If a recipe calls for 960 ml of evaporated milk, knowing the cup equivalent helps avoid mistakes. In the US, 960 ml equals about 4.06 cups, while in the UK, it's closer to 3.38 cups. This difference might seem small, but it can impact the texture and flavour of your baked goods.</p>  

<p>For air fryer baking, where space and heat distribution are factors, getting the liquid measurements right is even more critical. Too much evaporated milk can lead to soggy results, while too little might dry out your dish. If you're new to air fryer baking, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>cake recipes</a> for inspiration and tips on perfect measurements.</p>  

<h3>Common Recipes Using 960 ml of Evaporated Milk</h3>  
<p>Many creamy desserts and sauces use 960 ml of evaporated milk as a base. From flans to custards, knowing the cup conversion ensures your dish turns out just right. If you're making a large batch of a recipe, like a family-sized dessert, this measurement is especially useful. For more ideas, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert recipes</a> that make the most of evaporated milk.</p>  

<h2>Tips for Measuring Evaporated Milk in an Air Fryer</h2>  
<p>When using an air fryer, it's best to measure liquids like evaporated milk in a jug with clear markings. This avoids over or under-pouring, which can affect cooking times. If your recipe calls for 960 ml of evaporated milk, use the correct cup conversion for your region (US or UK) to ensure accuracy.</p>  

<p>Cleaning your air fryer after using evaporated milk is also important, as dairy can leave residues. Our guide on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>how to clean your air fryer</a> makes maintenance easy. Whether you're cooking a savoury casserole or a sweet treat, proper measurement and cleanup keep your air fryer in top condition.</p>

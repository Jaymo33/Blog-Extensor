<p>235 ml of single cream is approximately 1 cup in UK measurements or just under 1 cup (about 0.99 cups) in US measurements. Whether you're baking, cooking, or preparing a creamy sauce for your air fryer, knowing this conversion ensures your recipes turn out perfectly every time.</p>

<h2>Understanding the Conversion: 235 ml to Cups</h2>  
<p>Converting millilitres to cups can be tricky, especially when dealing with liquids like single cream. In the UK, 1 cup is typically 250 ml, meaning 235 ml is just shy of a full cup. In the US, where 1 cup equals 240 ml, 235 ml is very close to 1 cup. This small difference might not matter for some recipes, but for precision baking or air fryer dishes, it's good to know.</p>  
<p>For those using an air fryer, accurate measurements can make or break a recipe. Too much cream could make a dish too rich, while too little might leave it dry. If you're unsure, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more handy tips.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Single cream is often used in delicate recipes like custards, sauces, or even air fryer desserts. A slight variation in measurement can affect texture and taste. For example, adding too much cream to a cake batter could make it dense, while too little might dry it out.</p>  
<p>If you're experimenting with new recipes, especially those from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>our collection</a>, precise measurements ensure consistent results. Whether you're making a creamy pasta sauce or a light dessert, knowing how many cups 235 ml of single cream equals helps you nail the dish every time.</p>  

<h3>UK vs. US Cup Measurements</h3>  
<p>In the UK, a standard cup holds 250 ml, while in the US, it's 240 ml. This means 235 ml of single cream is 0.94 cups in the UK and 0.99 cups in the US. For most recipes, this difference is negligible, but for baking, it's worth noting.</p>  

<h2>How to Measure 235 ml of Single Cream Without a Measuring Cup</h2>  
<p>If you don't have a measuring cup, you can use a kitchen scale. Single cream has a density close to water, so 235 ml weighs roughly 235 grams. Alternatively, use tablespoons—15 ml per tablespoon means 235 ml is about 15.6 tablespoons.</p>  
<p>For air fryer enthusiasts, keeping measurements precise ensures your dishes cook evenly. If you're making a creamy dip or sauce, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert recipes</a> for inspiration.</p>  

<h3>Common Uses for 235 ml of Single Cream</h3>  
<p>Single cream is versatile—use it in soups, sauces, or even air fryer desserts like custards. It adds richness without being overly heavy. If you're making a creamy pasta dish, 235 ml is just enough to coat your ingredients perfectly.</p>  

<h2>Tips for Storing and Using Single Cream</h2>  
<p>Once opened, single cream should be used within a few days. If you're not using it all, freeze it in ice cube trays for later. When cooking with an air fryer, room-temperature cream blends better into mixtures.</p>

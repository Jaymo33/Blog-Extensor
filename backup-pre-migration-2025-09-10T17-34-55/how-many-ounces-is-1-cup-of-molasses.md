<p>One cup of molasses equals approximately 12 ounces. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements can make or break your dish. Whether you're baking gingerbread cookies or glazing meats, knowing how many ounces are in 1 cup of molasses ensures consistency.

<h2>Why accurate molasses measurements matter</h2>  
<p>Molasses is a thick, sticky sweetener that can be tricky to measure. Using too much or too little can affect the texture and flavour of your air fryer recipes. For example, adding extra molasses to a marinade might make it overly sweet, while skimping could leave your dish lacking depth. A standard UK measuring cup holds 12 ounces of molasses, but weighing it ensures precision. If you're working with sticky ingredients like molasses, a kitchen scale is a worthwhile investment.</p>  

<p>Many air fryer recipes, such as sticky ribs or ginger cakes, rely on molasses for that rich, caramelised flavour. Getting the measurement right means your dish turns out perfectly every time. For more recipe ideas, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipe collection</a> featuring molasses-based dishes.</p>  

<h3>How to measure molasses without the mess</h3>  
<p>Measuring molasses can be messy due to its sticky consistency. To make it easier, lightly grease your measuring cup or spoon with oil before adding the molasses. This helps it slide out cleanly, ensuring you get the full 12 ounces per cup. Alternatively, use a silicone spatula to scrape every last bit from the cup. If you're using an air fryer liner, this trick also prevents sticky residue buildup, making cleanup a breeze.</p>  

<h2>Converting molasses for air fryer recipes</h2>  
<p>If your recipe calls for ounces but you only have cup measurements, remember that 1 cup of molasses equals 12 ounces. This conversion is handy when scaling recipes up or down for your air fryer. For example, if a marinade requires 6 ounces of molasses, you’ll need half a cup. Keeping these conversions in mind ensures your air fryer dishes are always spot-on.

<p>Molasses adds moisture and richness to baked goods, so getting the measurement right is crucial. Too little, and your air fryer cake might turn out dry; too much, and it could become overly dense. If you're experimenting with new recipes, start with the standard 12 ounces per cup and adjust as needed.

<h3>Common mistakes when measuring molasses</h3>  
<p>A common mistake is packing molasses into the measuring cup, which can lead to using more than the recipe requires. Instead, pour it gently and level it off with a knife for accuracy. Another error is substituting black treacle for molasses without adjusting the quantity—they have similar weights but slightly different flavours. Always double-check your conversions to avoid mishaps in your air fryer creations.</p>  

<h2>Storing molasses for air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Proper storage keeps molasses fresh and easy to measure. After opening, store it in a cool, dark place or the fridge to prevent crystallisation. If it thickens, gently warm the jar in hot water before measuring. This ensures you get an accurate 12 ounces per cup every time.

<p>Molasses is a versatile ingredient that enhances both sweet and savoury air fryer dishes. Whether you're making barbecue sauce or spiced cookies, knowing that 1 cup equals 12 ounces helps you achieve perfect results.

<p>60 ml of chicken broth equals approximately 0.25 cups (or 1/4 cup). This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements can make or break a dish. Whether you're whipping up a sauce, soup, or marinade, knowing how to convert 60 ml of chicken broth to cups ensures consistency and flavour balance.</p>

<h2>Understanding the Conversion: 60 ml to Cups</h2>
<p>Converting millilitres to cups is straightforward once you know the ratio. In the UK and US, 1 cup equals 240 ml, meaning 60 ml is a quarter of that. This measurement is particularly useful when following air fryer recipes from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, where liquid quantities often need adjusting for smaller batches. For example, a creamy chicken dish might call for 60 ml of broth, and now you know that’s 0.25 cups.</p>
<p>If you’re working with a recipe that uses metric measurements, this conversion saves time and avoids guesswork. Many air fryer enthusiasts find that keeping a <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a> handy simplifies cooking, especially when scaling portions up or down. Whether you’re cooking for one or meal prepping, accuracy ensures your chicken broth-based recipes turn out perfectly every time.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>
<p>Air fryers cook food quickly and evenly, but they rely on precise ingredient ratios for the best results. Too much or too little liquid, like chicken broth, can affect texture and cooking times. For instance, 60 ml of chicken broth (0.25 cups) might be the difference between a succulent chicken breast and a dry one. This is why measuring correctly is crucial, especially for dishes like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>air fryer chicken recipes</a>.</p>
<p>Using the right amount of broth also ensures marinades and sauces aren’t too watery or thick. A quarter cup of broth might seem small, but it’s often enough to enhance flavour without overpowering other ingredients. For more tips on perfecting your air fryer meals, explore the <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipes section</a> on our site, where precise measurements are always highlighted.</p>

<h3>Common Uses for 60 ml of Chicken Broth</h3>
<p>60 ml of chicken broth is a versatile quantity in cooking. It’s ideal for deglazing pans, creating light sauces, or adding moisture to air-fried dishes. For example, a simple garlic butter sauce might combine 60 ml of broth with herbs for a flavourful drizzle. This small amount can also be used to baste chicken or vegetables during cooking, ensuring they stay juicy.</p>

<h3>Converting Other Chicken Broth Quantities</h3>
<p>If your recipe calls for more or less than 60 ml, here’s a quick reference: 30 ml is 0.125 cups (1/8 cup), and 120 ml is 0.5 cups (1/2 cup). These conversions are handy when adjusting portion sizes or experimenting with new dishes. For a full breakdown, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>, which covers everything from millilitres to cups.</p>

<h2>Tips for Measuring Chicken Broth Accurately</h2>
<p>To measure 60 ml of chicken broth precisely, use a liquid measuring cup with clear metric markings. If you only have imperial cups, remember that 0.25 cups is the equivalent. For smaller quantities, a tablespoon (15 ml) can help—four tablespoons equal 60 ml. Always measure at eye level to avoid over- or under-pouring, especially when working with rich broths that can skew flavour balances.</p>
<p>Another pro tip: if you’re using store-bought broth, shake the container well before measuring to ensure consistency. Homemade broth should be strained to remove any solids that could affect volume. And don’t forget to keep your air fryer clean after cooking with liquids—our guide on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaning</a> makes maintenance a breeze.</p>

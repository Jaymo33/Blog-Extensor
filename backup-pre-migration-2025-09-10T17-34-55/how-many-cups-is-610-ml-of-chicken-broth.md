<p>610 ml of chicken broth equals approximately 2.58 cups in the US measurement system and 2.15 cups in the UK system. This conversion is essential for recipes requiring precise liquid measurements, especially when using an air fryer for soups, stews, or sauces. Whether you're following a recipe from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes</a> or improvising, knowing how to convert 610 ml of chicken broth to cups ensures consistency.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Using the correct amount of chicken broth can make or break a dish. Too little, and your meal might turn out dry; too much, and it could become overly soggy. For air fryer recipes, where evaporation rates differ from conventional cooking, precision is key. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more measurement tips.</p>  

<p>Chicken broth is a staple in many dishes, from risottos to casseroles. If you're working with 610 ml of chicken broth, knowing its cup equivalent helps streamline your cooking process. This is particularly useful for batch cooking or meal prep, where scaling recipes up or down is common.</p>  

<h3>US vs. UK Cup Measurements</h3>  
<p>The difference between US and UK cup measurements can be confusing. In the US, 1 cup equals 240 ml, while in the UK, it's 284 ml. This means 610 ml of chicken broth converts to roughly 2.58 US cups or 2.15 UK cups. Always double-check which system your recipe uses to avoid mishaps.</p>  

<h2>How to Measure 610 ml of Chicken Broth Without a Scale</h2>  
<p>If you don't have a measuring jug, you can use standard cups to measure 610 ml of chicken broth. For US cups, fill two cups completely and add just over half of another. For UK cups, two full cups will give you roughly 568 ml, leaving you to eyeball the remaining 42 ml (about three tablespoons).</p>  

<p>Alternatively, repurpose an empty 500 ml water bottle and fill it to the 610 ml mark. This method isn't as precise but works in a pinch. For more air fryer measurement hacks, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipe category</a>.</p>  

<h3>Common Recipes Using 610 ml of Chicken Broth</h3>  
<p>Many air fryer recipes call for around 610 ml of chicken broth. This includes creamy chicken pasta, hearty soups, and even marinades. If you're adapting a stovetop recipe for the air fryer, remember that liquids reduce faster due to the intense heat, so adjust accordingly.</p>  

<h2>Converting Other Chicken Broth Amounts</h2>  
<p>Need to convert a different amount? Here's a quick reference: 250 ml equals about 1.06 US cups or 0.88 UK cups. For larger quantities, 1 litre (1000 ml) is roughly 4.23 US cups or 3.52 UK cups.

<p>Whether you're making a family-sized portion or a single serving, accurate conversions ensure your dish turns out perfectly. For more cooking tips, check out our guide on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>keeping your air fryer clean</a> between uses.</p>  

<h3>Tips for Storing Leftover Chicken Broth</h3>  
<p>If your recipe doesn't use all 610 ml of chicken broth, store the rest in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 4 days. Alternatively, freeze it in ice cube trays for easy portioning later. This way, you'll always have broth on hand for quick meals.</p>

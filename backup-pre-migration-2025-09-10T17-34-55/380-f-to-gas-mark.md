<p>380 F converts to Gas Mark 5 in UK ovens. This medium-high temperature works perfectly for roasting vegetables, baking cakes, or cooking meats in both conventional ovens and air fryers. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we specialise in helping you adapt traditional recipes for modern appliances.</p>

<h2>Understanding 380 F to Gas Mark Conversion</h2>
<p>The Gas Mark system is uniquely British, ranging from 1 to 9 to indicate oven temperatures. When your recipe calls for 380 F, you'll need to set your oven to Gas Mark 5. This equals approximately 193 C in the metric system. Many classic British recipes, especially those for <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>cakes</a> and roasts, use Gas Mark measurements.</p>
<p>Air fryers typically display temperatures in Celsius or Fahrenheit, so knowing this conversion helps when following traditional recipes. The circulating hot air in air fryers means you might need to reduce cooking times by 20% compared to conventional ovens. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> makes these adjustments simple.</p>

<h3>Why 380 F (Gas Mark 5) Works So Well</h3>
<p>This temperature hits the sweet spot for many cooking techniques. It's hot enough to create beautiful browning on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/potatoes>roast potatoes</a> while gentle enough to bake delicate sponges without burning. In air fryers, 380 F helps achieve that perfect crisp exterior with moist interiors.</p>

<h2>Adjusting 380 F for Air Fryer Cooking</h2>
<p>While the temperature conversion remains the same (380 F to Gas Mark 5), air fryers cook differently. Their powerful fans circulate heat more efficiently than conventional ovens. This means you might need to reduce the temperature by 25 F or shorten cooking times when converting Gas Mark recipes.</p>
<p>For example, if roasting chicken at Gas Mark 5 (380 F) normally takes 1 hour, try 45 minutes in your air fryer. Always check food 5-10 minutes before the suggested time. Our collection of <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> includes adjusted timings for popular dishes.</p>

<h3>Common Foods Cooked at 380 F/Gas Mark 5</h3>
<p>This temperature works beautifully for roasted vegetables, especially root vegetables like carrots and parsnips. It's also ideal for baking scones, cooking fish fillets, and reheating leftovers. When using your air fryer at 380 F, remember to shake or turn food halfway for even cooking.</p>

<h2>Gas Mark to Air Fryer Conversion Tips</h2>
<p>Modern air fryers don't use Gas Mark settings, but understanding the conversion helps when using older cookbooks. Alongside our 380 F to Gas Mark 5 conversion, remember that each Gas Mark represents about 25-30 C. Keep your <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer clean</a> for most accurate temperature performance.</p>
<p>For foods that normally cook at Gas Mark 5, preheat your air fryer to 380 F for 3-5 minutes first. This ensures even cooking from the start. The compact size of air fryers means they reach temperature faster than conventional ovens, saving energy and time.</p>

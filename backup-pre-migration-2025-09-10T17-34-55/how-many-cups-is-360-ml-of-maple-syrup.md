<p>360 ml of maple syrup is approximately 1.5 cups. This conversion is essential for precise baking and cooking, especially when using an air fryer for recipes like glazes or sweet treats. Whether you’re in the UK or the US, understanding this measurement ensures your dishes turn out perfectly every time.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter</h2>
<p>When working with maple syrup, accuracy is key. Too much or too little can alter the texture and taste of your dish. For air fryer recipes, precise measurements ensure even cooking and perfect results. Maple syrup is thicker than water, so volume conversions like 360 ml to cups require attention to detail.</p>
<p>At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we emphasise the importance of correct measurements for flawless outcomes. Whether you’re making a marinade or a dessert, knowing how many cups 360 ml of maple syrup equals can make all the difference. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more handy tips.</p>

<h2>UK vs. US Cup Measurements</h2>
<p>In the UK, a standard cup holds 250 ml, while in the US, it’s 240 ml. This slight difference means 360 ml of maple syrup is roughly 1.44 UK cups or 1.5 US cups. For most recipes, this small variance won’t matter, but for precision baking, it’s worth noting.</p>
<p>If you’re using an air fryer for recipes like sticky wings or maple-glazed salmon, sticking to the correct measurement ensures consistency. Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipes</a> section for inspiration on how to use maple syrup in your air fryer creations.</p>

<h3>How to Measure 360 ml of Maple Syrup</h3>
<p>To measure 360 ml of maple syrup accurately, use a liquid measuring cup with clear markings. Pour the syrup slowly to avoid bubbles and check at eye level. For sticky ingredients like maple syrup, lightly greasing the cup can help it slide out easily.</p>

<h3>Common Uses for 360 ml of Maple Syrup</h3>
<p>Maple syrup is versatile in both sweet and savoury dishes. From glazing roasted vegetables to sweetening air fryer desserts, 360 ml (or 1.5 cups) is a handy quantity. Try it in our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert recipes</a> for a natural sweetness boost.</p>

<h2>Converting Other Maple Syrup Quantities</h2>
<p>If you need to convert other amounts, remember that 1 cup equals 240 ml in the US and 250 ml in the UK. For example, 120 ml is 0.5 US cups, and 480 ml is 2 US cups. Keeping these conversions in mind simplifies recipe adjustments.</p>

<p>1 cup of evaporated milk equals approximately 8.5 ounces (240 ml) in UK measurements. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precision ensures perfect texture and consistency. Whether you're making creamy desserts or savoury dishes, knowing the exact weight helps avoid kitchen mishaps.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on even heat distribution, so ingredient ratios must be spot-on. Using the correct amount of evaporated milk—8.5 ounces per cup—ensures your recipes bake or cook evenly. Too much liquid can lead to soggy results, while too little might dry out your dish. For more tips, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>  

<p>Evaporated milk is thicker than regular milk, so volume-to-weight conversions differ slightly. If you’re adapting a recipe from cups to ounces, always double-check. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a> includes measured guidelines for foolproof air fryer meals.</p>  

<h3>How to measure evaporated milk correctly</h3>  
<p>Use a kitchen scale for the most accurate results. Place your measuring cup on the scale, tare it to zero, then pour evaporated milk until it hits 8.5 ounces. No scale? A UK standard measuring cup (240 ml) will suffice, but slight variations can occur.</p>  

<h2>Common recipes using evaporated milk</h2>  
<p>Evaporated milk stars in creamy pasta sauces, custards, and even air-fried cakes. Its rich texture enhances dishes like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>air fryer desserts</a> without overpowering flavours. Need inspiration? Browse our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/breakfast>breakfast recipes</a> for ideas.</p>  

<p>For savoury options, try adding 8.5 ounces (1 cup) of evaporated milk to mashed potatoes or soups. It’s a game-changer in <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipes</a>, lending a velvety finish to sauces.</p>  

<h3>Converting other milk types</h3>  
<p>If substituting fresh milk, use 1 cup (8 oz) plus 2 tablespoons to match evaporated milk’s consistency. For plant-based alternatives, adjust thickness with cornstarch. Always clean your air fryer after dairy-heavy recipes—here’s our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning guide</a>.</p>

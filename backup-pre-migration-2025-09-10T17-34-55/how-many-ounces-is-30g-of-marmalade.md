Air fryer recipes, like those on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, often need exact measurements for glazes or sauces.

<h2>How to Measure 30g of Marmalade Without Scales</h2>
<p>No scales? No problem. Two level tablespoons roughly equal 30g of marmalade (about 1.06 ounces). Use a proper measuring spoon for accuracy, especially for air fryer recipes. Marmalade’s thickness means it won’t settle like flour, so scoop and level carefully.</p>

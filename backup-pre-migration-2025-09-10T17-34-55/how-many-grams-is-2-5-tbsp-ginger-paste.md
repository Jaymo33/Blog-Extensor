<p>2.5 tbsp of ginger paste equals approximately 37.5 grams. This conversion is essential for precise cooking, especially when using an air fryer where measurements can impact texture and flavour. Whether you're following a recipe from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> or experimenting with your own dishes, knowing the exact weight ensures consistency.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on even heat distribution, so ingredient quantities can affect cooking times and results. Too much ginger paste might make a dish overly pungent, while too little could leave it bland. Converting 2.5 tbsp of ginger paste to grams (37.5g) helps maintain balance.

<p>Ginger paste is a staple in many cuisines, adding warmth and depth to dishes like curries, marinades, and stir-fries. When prepping meals for your air fryer, precise measurements ensure flavours are perfectly balanced. Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipes</a> for inspiration on using ginger paste in your cooking.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure Ginger Paste Correctly</h3>  
<p>For the most accurate conversion of 2.5 tbsp ginger paste to grams, use a kitchen scale. Scoop the paste lightly without packing it down to avoid excess. If you don’t have a scale, remember that 1 tbsp of ginger paste is roughly 15 grams, making 2.5 tbsp equal to 37.5 grams.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for Ginger Paste in Air Fryer Recipes</h2>  
<p>Ginger paste works wonderfully in air fryer dishes like glazed chicken, vegetable stir-fries, or even baked goods. Its concentrated flavour means a little goes a long way—so 37.5 grams (2.5 tbsp) is often plenty for a family-sized meal. Try it in our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipes</a> for a zesty kick.</p>

<h3>Substitutes for Ginger Paste</h3>  
<p>If you’re out of ginger paste, freshly grated ginger (about 1 tbsp per 15g of paste) or ground ginger (use half the amount) can work. Just adjust measurements to match the 2.5 tbsp (37.5g) requirement for consistency.</p>

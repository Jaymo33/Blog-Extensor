<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Precision is key when using an air fryer, as even small measurement errors can affect texture and taste. Oat milk, like other liquids, needs to be measured correctly to avoid overly dry or soggy results. For example, if a recipe calls for 0.5 cups of oat milk (118 ml), using too much or too little could throw off the balance. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> simplifies these calculations, so you never have to guess. Whether you're making pancakes or a savoury casserole, accurate measurements ensure consistency.</p>  

<p>Many air fryer recipes, especially baked goods, rely on precise liquid ratios. Oat milk is a popular dairy-free alternative, but its slightly thicker consistency means measurements must be spot-on. If you're converting from cups to ml, remember that 0.5 cups of oat milk is 118 ml. This small but crucial detail can elevate your cooking, whether you're following a recipe from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>our collection</a> or experimenting with your own creations. Always use a measuring jug for liquids to avoid discrepancies.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure 0.5 Cups of Oat Milk Correctly</h3>  
<p>To measure 0.5 cups of oat milk accurately, use a liquid measuring cup with clear ml markings. Pour the oat milk slowly until it reaches the 118 ml line, checking at eye level to avoid over-pouring.

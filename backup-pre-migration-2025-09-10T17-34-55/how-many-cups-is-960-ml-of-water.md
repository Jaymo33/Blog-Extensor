<p>960 ml of water equals approximately 4.06 cups in the UK or 4.06 US cups. This conversion is essential for precise cooking, especially when using an air fryer where measurements can impact texture and cooking times. Whether you’re preparing a sauce, batter, or simply hydrating ingredients, knowing how many cups is 960 ml of water ensures consistency in your dishes. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we help you master these conversions for flawless results every time.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on hot air circulation, so ingredient ratios can affect how evenly your food cooks. Too much liquid, like 960 ml of water, might make dishes soggy, while too little can dry them out. Using the correct cup measurement ensures your recipes turn out perfectly crispy or moist, depending on the dish. For example, a batter with 960 ml of water (about 4 cups) needs precise balancing with dry ingredients for optimal texture. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more handy tips.</p>  

<p>Many air fryer recipes, like cakes or steamed buns, require exact liquid measurements. If a recipe calls for 960 ml of water, knowing it’s roughly 4 cups helps you adjust if using a different measuring system. This is particularly useful for international cooks or when following recipes from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>our collection</a> designed for varied kitchen tools.</p>  

<h2>Converting 960 ml of Water to Cups: UK vs. US</h2>  
<p>In the UK, 1 cup equals 284 ml, while in the US, it’s 237 ml. However, for simplicity, 960 ml of water converts to about 4.06 cups in both systems due to minimal variance. This makes it easy to follow recipes without worrying about regional differences. For baking, like air fryer muffins or bread, this precision ensures your batter isn’t too runny or thick.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure 960 ml of Water Without a Scale</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a measuring jug, use standard cups: 4 cups (960 ml) of water fills a litre jug to just under the brim. For smaller portions, remember that 240 ml equals 1 cup, so 960 ml is simply four of those. This trick works for liquids like stock or milk in air fryer recipes, such as creamy <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/potatoes>potato dishes</a>.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for 960 ml of Water in Air Fryer Recipes</h2>  
<p>This quantity is ideal for steaming, boiling, or mixing batters. For instance, 960 ml of water (4 cups) can steam veggies or fish in your air fryer with a little help from foil or a silicone liner. It’s also perfect for reconstituting dried ingredients like beans or mushrooms, which you can then air fry for crispy results. Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable recipes</a> for ideas.</p>  

<p>Another great use is in marinades or brines. A brine with 960 ml of water, salt, and herbs ensures juicy chicken or turkey in the air fryer. Just pat dry before cooking for that signature crispiness.

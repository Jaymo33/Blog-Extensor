<p>Air fryers rely on even heat distribution, so ingredient ratios must be spot-on. Too much or too little ketchup can alter texture and flavour. For example, a sticky glaze needs the right balance of sweetness and thickness. Recipes like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer BBQ chicken</a> depend on precise ketchup measurements for the perfect finish. Always measure ingredients like tomato ketchup by weight for reliability.</p>  

<h3>How to measure 1.33 cups of tomato ketchup</h3>  
<p>Use a liquid measuring cup for accuracy, filling it just below the 1.33-cup mark. Alternatively, weigh it on a kitchen scale for 10.64 ounces. If your recipe calls for UK measurements, note that 1 US cup equals 8.45 UK fluid ounces, but weight remains consistent.

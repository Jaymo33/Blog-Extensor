<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on even cooking, and incorrect measurements can lead to uneven results. Too many sesame seeds might overcrowd the basket, while too few won’t crisp properly. Measuring 0.75 cup of sesame seeds to ounces ensures consistency, especially for recipes like sesame-crusted tofu or homemade granola. Visit <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>our recipe hub</a> for more inspiration.</p>  

<p>Using a kitchen scale is the most accurate method, but cup-to-ounce conversions are handy when scales aren’t available. For UK cooks, note that 1 US cup equals 8 UK fluid ounces, but weight conversions remain consistent. Our guide simplifies this for hassle-free cooking.</p>  

<h2>How to Measure 0.75 Cup of Sesame Seeds</h2>  
<p>To measure 0.75 cup of sesame seeds, fill a measuring cup three-quarters full without packing them down. Lightly toasted seeds weigh slightly less due to moisture loss, so adjust if needed. For recipes like air-fryer sesame shrimp, precision ensures the perfect crunch.</p>  

<h3>Converting 0.75 Cup Sesame Seeds to Ounces</h3>  
<p>Since 1 cup of sesame seeds weighs about 5 ounces, 0.75 cup equals 3.75 ounces. This conversion works for both black and white sesame seeds. Need more help? Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>sesame chicken recipes</a> for delicious ideas.</p>

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on even cooking, and incorrect ingredient quantities can lead to uneven results. Too much mayonnaise, for example, might make your dish greasy, while too little could leave it dry. Converting 75g of mayonnaise to ounces (2.65 oz) helps you stick to the recipe. Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a> for dishes that use precise measurements for flawless outcomes.</p>  

<p>Many UK recipes use grams, but if your kitchen scale measures ounces, this conversion is a lifesaver. Whether you're meal prepping or cooking for one, accuracy ensures your air fryer meals turn out perfectly every time.

<h3>How to measure 75g of mayonnaise without a scale</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a kitchen scale, you can use tablespoons to measure 75g of mayonnaise.

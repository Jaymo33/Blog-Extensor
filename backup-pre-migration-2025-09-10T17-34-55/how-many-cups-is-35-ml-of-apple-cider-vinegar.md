Whether you're whipping up a marinade or baking a cake, knowing how to convert millilitres to cups ensures your dish turns out perfectly every time.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter</h2>
<p>When cooking or baking, especially with an air fryer, precise measurements can make or break your dish. Apple cider vinegar is often used in small quantities, so getting the conversion right is crucial. Too much or too little can alter the taste and texture of your meal.

<p>Many recipes, particularly those from the UK or USA, may list ingredients in different units. Converting 35 ml of apple cider vinegar to cups ensures you're following the recipe correctly. This is especially important for air fryer recipes, where ingredient ratios can affect cooking times and results.</p>

<h2>How to Measure 35 ml of Apple Cider Vinegar</h2>
<p>If you don't have a measuring cup that shows millilitres, you can use a standard measuring cup and a bit of maths. Since 1 cup is roughly 240 ml, 35 ml is just under 1/7 of a cup. For more precise measurements, consider using a kitchen scale or a graduated measuring spoon.</p>

Its acidity also helps tenderise meats, making it a great addition to your cooking arsenal.</p>

<h3>Converting Other Measurements</h3>

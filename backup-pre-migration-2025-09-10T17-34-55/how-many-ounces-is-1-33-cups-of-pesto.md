<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on even cooking, and incorrect measurements can lead to uneven results. Pesto, with its dense texture, needs careful measuring to avoid overpowering flavours or dry dishes.

<p>Many home cooks underestimate the importance of converting cups to ounces, especially with thick ingredients like pesto. A slight miscalculation can alter the dish’s moisture and flavour balance.

<h3>How to Measure Pesto for Air Fryer Recipes</h3>  
<p>To measure 1.33 cups of pesto accurately, spoon it into a measuring cup without packing it down. Level it off with a knife for precision. If using weight, 10.64 ounces is your target. This method works for both homemade and store-bought pesto, ensuring consistency across recipes.</p>  

<h2>Common Mistakes When Measuring Pesto</h2>  
<p>One frequent error is scooping pesto directly from the jar, which compresses it and leads to excess. Another is guessing the weight, resulting in inaccurate portions. Always measure 1.33 cups of pesto as 10.64 ounces for reliable results. For cleaning tips after cooking, visit our guide on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer maintenance</a>.</p>

<h2>How many ounces is 1.33 cups of ground almonds?</h2>  
<p>1.33 cups of ground almonds equals approximately 4.8 ounces (136 grams). This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes, ensuring your baked goods turn out perfectly every time. Ground almonds are a staple in gluten-free and low-carb baking, so getting the measurement right is crucial. Whether you're making almond flour cakes or cookies, precision matters. For more air fryer baking tips, check out <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>our recipe collection</a>.</p>  

<p>Converting cups to ounces can be tricky, especially with ingredients like ground almonds, which vary in density. A standard cup of ground almonds weighs about 3.6 ounces (102 grams), so 1.33 cups scales up to roughly 4.8 ounces. This measurement is particularly useful for UK bakers who prefer weighing ingredients for consistency.

<h3>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer baking</h3>  
<p>Air fryers cook food faster and more evenly than conventional ovens, so precise measurements ensure your recipes don't dry out or undercook. Ground almonds absorb moisture differently than wheat flour, affecting texture. Using the correct weight (4.8 ounces for 1.33 cups) guarantees perfect results.

<h2>How to measure ground almonds for air fryer recipes</h2>  
<p>For the most accurate results, use a kitchen scale to weigh your ground almonds. Scooping directly from the bag can lead to uneven measurements due to settling. Fluff the almonds with a spoon before measuring to ensure consistency. If you don't have a scale, spoon the almonds into a measuring cup and level it off.

<p>If your recipe calls for 1.33 cups of ground almonds (4.8 ounces), avoid packing them tightly, as this can add extra weight. Lightly spooned almonds ensure the correct ratio for air fryer baking. For recipes like almond flour cookies or cakes, precision ensures the right crumb and moisture.

<h3>Common mistakes when converting cups to ounces</h3>  
<p>One common error is assuming all cup measurements are equal. Ground almonds can vary in fineness, affecting density. Always use the spoon-and-level method for cups or, better yet, weigh them. Another mistake is confusing fluid ounces (volume) with weight ounces. For air fryer recipes, weight ounces (like 4.8 ounces for 1.33 cups) are crucial for accuracy.</p>

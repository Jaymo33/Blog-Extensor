<p>0.125 cup of buttermilk equals exactly 1 fluid ounce (oz). This measurement is crucial for precision in baking and air fryer recipes, where accurate liquid quantities can make or break your dish. Whether you're whipping up fluffy pancakes or a tangy marinade for chicken, knowing this conversion ensures consistency. For more air fryer-friendly recipes, check out <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>our recipe collection</a>.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Buttermilk Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Buttermilk adds moisture and acidity to recipes, making it a staple in baked goods and marinades. Using the correct amount ensures your dishes turn out perfectly every time. Too little buttermilk can result in dry, crumbly textures, while too much may make batters overly wet. If you're prepping a <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipe</a> for the air fryer, precise buttermilk measurements help achieve that crispy, golden finish.</p>  

<p>For those using air fryers, buttermilk is often used in coatings or brines. A 0.125 cup (1 oz) portion is ideal for small batches, like a single serving of fried chicken tenders. If scaling up, simply multiply the measurement accordingly. Need a handy reference? Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> simplifies these calculations.</p>  

<h2>How to Measure 0.125 Cup of Buttermilk</h2>  
<p>Measuring small quantities like 0.125 cup can be tricky without the right tools. Here’s how to do it accurately:</p>  

<h3>Using Measuring Cups</h3>  
<p>Standard measuring cups often include markings for 1/8 cup (0.125 cup). Simply fill to this line for an exact ounce of buttermilk. If your cup lacks this marking, measure 2 tablespoons, as 1 fluid ounce equals 2 tablespoons. For more tips on air fryer prep, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/meal-prep>meal prep guides</a>.</p>  

<h3>Using a Kitchen Scale</h3>  
<p>For ultimate precision, weigh your buttermilk. One fluid ounce of buttermilk weighs approximately 28 grams. Place your container on the scale, tare it, and pour until you hit 28 grams. This method eliminates guesswork, especially for recipes like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>air fryer cakes</a>.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for 0.125 Cup Buttermilk</h2>  
<p>This small but mighty measurement pops up in many recipes. Here’s where you’ll often need it:</p>  

<ul>  
<li>Marinades for air-fried chicken or turkey</li>  
<li>Small-batch pancake or waffle batters</li>  
<li>Tangy dressings for salads or dips</li>  
<li>Moistening crumbs for coatings</li>  
</ul>  

<p>After cooking, don’t forget to clean your air fryer with our recommended <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning solutions</a> to maintain its performance.</p>

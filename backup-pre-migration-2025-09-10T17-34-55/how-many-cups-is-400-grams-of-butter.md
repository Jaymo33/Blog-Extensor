<p>400 grams of butter is roughly equivalent to 1.76 cups (or 1 and 3/4 cups) in standard US measurements. For UK measurements, it’s slightly different due to varying cup sizes, but the conversion remains close to 1.76 cups. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes, where precise measurements can make or break your dish.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Butter Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>When using an air fryer, exact measurements ensure even cooking and perfect texture. Too much butter can make food greasy, while too little might leave it dry. Whether you’re making crispy potatoes or baking a cake, knowing how many cups is 400 grams of butter helps achieve consistency. For more air fryer tips, check out <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>our conversion chart</a>.</p>  

<p>Butter density can vary slightly depending on temperature, so always measure at room temperature for accuracy. If you’re working with melted butter, the volume changes, so weight (grams) is more reliable. For recipes like air-fried cookies or cakes, precise butter measurements ensure the right crumb and texture. Explore more <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> to test your conversions.</p>  

<h3>US vs. UK Cup Measurements</h3>  
<p>In the US, 1 cup of butter is about 227 grams, making 400 grams roughly 1.76 cups. In the UK, a metric cup is 250ml, but butter is still measured by weight for accuracy. Always check your recipe’s origin to avoid confusion. For UK-specific recipes, <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>cake recipes</a> often list both grams and cups.</p>  

<h2>Converting 400g Butter to Cups for Baking</h2>  
<p>Baking requires precision, especially in an air fryer where heat distribution is rapid. If a recipe calls for 400 grams of butter, using 1 and 3/4 cups ensures the right fat content for flaky pastries or moist cakes. For best results, use a kitchen scale, but if you don’t have one, this conversion will work.</p>  

<p>Air fryers excel at baking, from cookies to muffins, but ingredient ratios matter. Too much butter can cause excessive browning, while too little may dry out your bake. For perfect air-fried desserts, check out <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert recipes</a> tailored for air fryers.</p>  

<h3>Tips for Measuring Butter Without a Scale</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a scale, use the markings on butter packaging. A standard block of butter often has tablespoon markings, making it easy to measure 400 grams (about 28 tablespoons). For sticky butter, lightly grease your measuring cup to ensure it slides out cleanly.</p>  

<h2>Common Recipes Using 400g Butter</h2>  
<p>Many air fryer recipes, like shortbread or buttery biscuits, use 400 grams of butter. This amount is ideal for batches serving 8–10 people. Whether you’re making savoury or sweet dishes, accurate conversions prevent waste and ensure consistency.</p>  

<p>For savoury options, try air-fried garlic bread or buttery shrimp—both benefit from precise butter measurements.

<p>25g of rice equals approximately 0.88 ounces. This conversion is essential for air fryer cooking, where precise measurements can make or break a dish. Whether you're meal prepping or cooking a quick side, knowing how to convert grams to ounces ensures consistency. For more air fryer conversions, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>

<h2>Why converting 25g of rice to ounces matters</h2>  
<p>Accurate measurements are crucial for air fryer recipes, especially when dealing with rice. Too much or too little can affect cooking times and texture. Converting 25g of rice to ounces (0.88 oz) helps you follow recipes precisely. This is particularly useful for dishes like air-fried rice cakes or crispy rice snacks. Visit <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>our recipes section</a> for inspiration.</p>  

<p>Rice is a staple in many air fryer meals, from fried rice to rice-based desserts. Knowing the weight in ounces ensures you don’t overcrowd the basket or undercook your dish. For perfect results every time, measure your rice carefully. If you're cooking for one, 25g of rice (0.88 oz) is a great single-serving portion.</p>  

<h3>How to measure 25g of rice without scales</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a scale, you can estimate 25g of rice using household items. A tablespoon of uncooked rice weighs roughly 15g, so 1.5 tablespoons will give you close to 25g. For more accuracy, use a standard measuring cup—25g is about 1/8 of a cup. Remember, these are approximations, so invest in a kitchen scale for best results.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for 25g of rice in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>25g of rice might seem small, but it’s perfect for single servings or side dishes. Try it in air-fried rice balls, crispy rice crackers, or as a base for stir-fries. For more ideas, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable recipes</a> that pair well with rice.</p>  

<p>Rice can also be used in air fryer desserts, like rice pudding or mochi. Converting 25g to ounces ensures you get the right texture and consistency. Experiment with different types of rice—basmati, jasmine, or sushi rice—each with slightly different weights per cup.

<h3>Tips for cooking rice in an air fryer</h3>  
<p>Pre-rinse your rice to remove excess starch, which can cause clumping. Use a light spray of oil to prevent sticking and ensure even cooking. For 25g of rice (0.88 oz), cook at 180°C for 10-12 minutes, shaking halfway. Pair it with proteins or veggies from our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipes</a> for a complete meal.</p>

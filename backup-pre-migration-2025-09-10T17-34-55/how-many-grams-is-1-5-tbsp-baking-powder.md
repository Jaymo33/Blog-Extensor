<p>1.5 tablespoons (tbsp) of baking powder equals approximately 21 grams in UK measurements. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements can make or break your dish. Whether you’re whipping up fluffy cakes or crispy batters, knowing the exact weight ensures consistent results every time.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate baking powder measurements matter</h2>  
<p>Baking powder is a leavening agent that helps baked goods rise. Too little, and your air fryer cakes or muffins will be dense. Too much, and they might collapse or taste bitter. For air fryer recipes, where heat distribution is rapid, precision is key. A digital scale is your best friend here, as volume measurements (like tablespoons) can vary based on how you scoop.</p>  

<p>At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we recommend weighing ingredients for reliability. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> includes common baking powder conversions, so you’ll never second-guess measurements again. This is especially handy for recipes like air fryer doughnuts or savoury batters.</p>  

<h3>How to measure 1.5 tbsp baking powder correctly</h3>  
<p>To measure 1.5 tbsp of baking powder accurately, use a flat-edged utensil to level off the powder. Avoid packing it down, as this can lead to over-measuring. If you’re scaling a recipe up or down, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe section</a> offers adjustable serving sizes with gram equivalents.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for 1.5 tbsp baking powder in air fryers</h2>  
<p>This quantity is often used in small-batch air fryer recipes, such as single-serving cakes or tempura batters. For example, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>air fryer cake recipes</a> frequently call for 1.5 tbsp of baking powder to ensure a light, fluffy texture. It’s also ideal for homemade air fryer onion rings or fritters.</p>  

<p>If you’re adapting oven recipes for the air fryer, remember that baking powder’s potency can vary with heat intensity. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning guide</a> to maintain your appliance’s performance, as residue from baking powder can affect cooking efficiency over time.</p>  

<h3>Converting other baking powder quantities</h3>  
<p>Need to adjust the amount? Here’s a quick reference: 1 tbsp baking powder = 14 grams, so 1.5 tbsp = 21 grams. For larger batches, 2 tbsp equals 28 grams. Bookmark this page or our conversion chart for easy access during your next air fryer baking session.</p>

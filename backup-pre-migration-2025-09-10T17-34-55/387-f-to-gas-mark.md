<p>387°F converts to Gas Mark 5, which is the standard setting for many baking recipes in both conventional ovens and air fryers. This temperature is ideal for achieving perfectly cooked goods without burning or undercooking. Whether you're using an air fryer or traditional oven, understanding this conversion ensures your dishes turn out just right every time.</p>

<h2>Why 387°F to Gas Mark 5 Matters</h2>
<p>Gas Mark 5 represents a moderate oven temperature that's versatile enough for various cooking methods. When converted from 387°F, it becomes particularly useful for British recipes that specify Gas Mark rather than Fahrenheit. Many classic baking recipes at <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> use this temperature for cookies, cakes, and roasted vegetables.</p>
<p>The precision of this conversion helps prevent common cooking mishaps. Air fryers especially benefit from accurate temperature settings since their rapid air circulation can cause faster cooking. At 387°F (Gas Mark 5), you'll achieve even browning without drying out your food. This makes it perfect for everything from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>air fryer cakes</a> to roasted chicken thighs.</p>

<h2>Converting Between Fahrenheit and Gas Mark</h2>
<p>The Gas Mark system is uniquely British, with each number representing a specific temperature range. Gas Mark 5 corresponds to 375-400°F, with 387°F sitting comfortably in the middle. This makes it an excellent all-purpose temperature for most cooking needs. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> includes these details for quick reference.</p>
<p>When using an air fryer at 387°F, remember that cooking times may be shorter than conventional ovens. The powerful fan circulates hot air efficiently, reducing overall cook time by about 20%. This is particularly noticeable when preparing frozen foods or reheating leftovers. Always check your food a few minutes early to prevent overcooking.</p>

<h3>Adjusting Recipes for 387°F/Gas Mark 5</h3>
<p>Many British recipes specify Gas Mark temperatures, requiring conversion for air fryer users. When a recipe calls for Gas Mark 5, simply set your air fryer to 387°F. The results should be nearly identical, though you might need to reduce cooking time slightly. This works exceptionally well for roasted potatoes and other <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/potatoes>potato dishes</a>.</p>

<h2>Common Uses for 387°F (Gas Mark 5)</h2>
<p>This temperature is ideal for baking cookies with crisp edges and soft centers. It's also perfect for roasting vegetables, allowing them to caramelize without burning. When cooking meat, 387°F provides enough heat to brown the exterior while keeping the interior juicy. Many frozen convenience foods also cook beautifully at this temperature.</p>
<p>For air fryer users, 387°F works wonders with breaded items like chicken tenders or fish fillets. The hot air circulates evenly, creating a crispy coating without excessive oil. Remember to <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>clean your air fryer</a> regularly when cooking at these temperatures to prevent smoke from accumulated grease.</p>

<h3>Temperature Accuracy Tips</h3>
<p>Not all ovens and air fryers maintain temperature perfectly. Consider using an oven thermometer to verify your appliance's accuracy at 387°F/Gas Mark 5. This is especially important for baking, where precise temperatures make all the difference. Air fryers typically maintain temperature more consistently than conventional ovens.</p>

<p>25g of baking powder equals approximately 0.88 ounces. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes, where precise measurements can make or break your dish. Whether you’re whipping up cakes, bread, or even savoury batters, knowing how to convert grams to ounces ensures consistency. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we focus on making cooking simpler with accurate conversions and foolproof recipes.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer baking</h2>  
<p>Baking powder is a leavening agent, and even small discrepancies can affect how your dish rises. Too little, and your cake might turn out dense; too much, and it could collapse. The air fryer’s rapid circulation means ingredients react faster, so precision is key. For example, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer cake recipes</a> rely on exact measurements for perfect results every time.</p>  

<p>Converting 25g of baking powder to ounces (0.88 oz) ensures you’re using the right amount. A digital kitchen scale is the most reliable tool, but if you’re using measuring spoons, check their volume equivalents. Most UK bakers prefer grams, but some older recipes or international guides might use ounces, making this conversion handy.</p>  

<h3>How to measure 25g of baking powder without a scale</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a scale, 25g of baking powder is roughly 5 teaspoons. However, spoon sizes vary, so fluff the powder first and level it off for accuracy. For air fryer recipes, consistency matters—especially in batters or doughs. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a> simplifies these adjustments, so you’ll never second-guess measurements again.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for 25g of baking powder in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>From fluffy scones to crispy tempura, 25g of baking powder (0.88 oz) is a versatile quantity. It’s enough for a medium-sized batch of pancakes or a light batter for <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>air-fried vegetables</a>. Since air fryers cook faster than conventional ovens, the right leavening ensures even texture without over-expansion.</p>  

<p>For savoury dishes, like air-fried onion rings or fish coatings, 25g of baking powder adds lift without altering flavour. Check our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/white-fish>white fish recipes</a> for inspiration. Remember, storing baking powder in a cool, dry place maintains its potency, so your 25g measurements stay effective.</p>  

<h3>Converting other baking ingredients from grams to ounces</h3>  
<p>While 25g of baking powder is 0.88 oz, other ingredients differ. Flour, for instance, is lighter: 25g equals about 0.88 oz by weight, but volume varies. For air fryer baking, always weigh dry ingredients for accuracy. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning guide</a> also highlights why keeping tools residue-free ensures precise measurements.</p>

<p>100g of crushed garlic equals approximately 3.53 ounces. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes, where precise measurements can make or break your dish. Whether you're following a recipe from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> or experimenting with your own creations, knowing how to convert 100g crushed garlic to ounces ensures consistent results.</p>

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air frying</h2>
<p>Air fryers cook food quickly and evenly, but they rely on precise ingredient quantities for the best results. Too much or too little garlic can throw off the flavour balance of your dish. For example, a recipe calling for 100g of crushed garlic to ounces (3.53 oz) needs that exact amount to achieve the intended taste. This is especially important for dishes like garlic bread or roasted vegetables, where garlic is the star ingredient.</p>
<p>Many air fryer recipes, including those in our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipes section</a>, use metric measurements. If you're more comfortable with imperial units, knowing that 100 grams of crushed garlic equals about 3.53 ounces will help you follow these recipes with confidence. This conversion is also handy when scaling recipes up or down to suit your needs.</p>

<h2>How to measure 100g of crushed garlic</h2>
<p>Measuring crushed garlic by weight is more accurate than using volume measurements like tablespoons. Garlic cloves vary in size, so counting cloves isn't reliable for precise recipes. To measure 100g of crushed garlic, you'll need digital kitchen scales. Simply place your bowl on the scales, tare them to zero, then add garlic until you reach 100g (or 3.53 ounces).</p>
<p>If you don't have scales, you can estimate that 100g of crushed garlic is roughly equivalent to about 20-25 average-sized cloves. However, for air fryer recipes where precision matters, we recommend investing in a good set of scales. You'll find them invaluable for all your cooking, not just when converting 100g crushed garlic to oz measurements.</p>

<h3>Converting other garlic measurements</h3>
<p>While we've focused on 100g of crushed garlic to ounces, you might need to convert other quantities too. Here's a quick reference: 50g equals about 1.76 ounces, and 200g is approximately 7.05 ounces. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> includes these and other common conversions to make your cooking easier.</p>

<h2>Using garlic in your air fryer</h2>
<p>Now that you know 100 grams of crushed garlic equals 3.53 ounces, let's talk about using it in your air fryer. Garlic adds incredible flavour to air-fried dishes, from chicken to vegetables. When using 100g of crushed garlic (3.53 oz), distribute it evenly over your ingredients for consistent flavouring. For garlic-heavy dishes like garlic mushrooms or prawns, this measurement ensures perfect results every time.</p>
<p>Remember that garlic burns easily in the air fryer's intense heat. To prevent this, mix your 100g of crushed garlic (3.53 oz) with a little oil before adding it to your dish. You'll find plenty of garlic-infused recipes in our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetables category</a>, all tested to work perfectly with these measurements.</p>

<h3>Storing leftover crushed garlic</h3>
<p>If you've measured out 100g of crushed garlic but don't use it all, proper storage is key. Transfer the remaining garlic to an airtight container and refrigerate for up to two weeks. You can also freeze measured portions (like 100g/3.53 oz) in ice cube trays for future use in your air fryer recipes.</p>

<h2>Common recipes using 100g crushed garlic</h2>
<p>Many delicious air fryer recipes call for around 100g of crushed garlic (3.53 ounces). Garlic butter shrimp, roasted garlic potatoes, and garlic herb chicken are just a few examples. These dishes rely on the precise measurement of 100g crushed garlic to ounces to achieve their signature flavours.</p>

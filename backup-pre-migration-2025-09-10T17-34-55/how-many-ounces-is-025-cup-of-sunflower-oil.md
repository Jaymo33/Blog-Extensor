<p>0.25 cup of sunflower oil equals approximately 2 ounces (or 59 ml). This measurement is essential for air fryer recipes, where precise oil quantities ensure crispy, evenly cooked results without excess grease. Whether you’re making roasted veggies or crispy chicken, knowing this conversion helps you nail the recipe every time.</p>

<h2>Why accurate oil measurements matter in air frying</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of oil in your air fryer is crucial for achieving the perfect texture. Too little oil can leave food dry, while too much can make it greasy. Sunflower oil, with its high smoke point, is a popular choice for air frying. A 0.25 cup (2 oz) portion is often ideal for coating ingredients lightly without overpowering them.</p>  
<p>For more tips on air fryer conversions, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>. It’s a handy resource for adjusting recipes to suit your appliance. Whether you’re cooking frozen foods or fresh veggies, precise measurements make all the difference.</p>  

<h2>How to measure 0.25 cup of sunflower oil</h2>  
<p>Measuring 0.25 cup of sunflower oil is simple with the right tools. Use a liquid measuring cup with clear markings, or a kitchen scale for weight (2 oz). If you don’t have a scale, remember that 1 tablespoon equals 0.5 oz, so 0.25 cup (4 tablespoons) is 2 oz.</p>  
<p>For UK cooks, note that metric measurements may differ slightly. A 0.25 cup of sunflower oil is roughly 59 ml, but weighing it in ounces ensures consistency. Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> for inspiration on using this measurement in dishes like crispy potatoes or tofu.</p>  

<h3>Sunflower oil vs. other oils in air frying</h3>  
<p>Sunflower oil’s neutral flavour and high smoke point (around 225°C) make it ideal for air frying. Compared to olive oil or butter, it’s less likely to burn. A 0.25 cup (2 oz) portion works well for most recipes, but always adjust based on the food’s density.</p>  

<h2>Common recipes using 0.25 cup of sunflower oil</h2>  
<p>Many air fryer recipes call for 0.25 cup of sunflower oil. For example, crispy chicken wings often need this amount for a light coating. Similarly, roasted vegetables like potatoes or mushrooms benefit from 2 oz of oil for even browning.</p>  
<p>If you’re meal prepping, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/meal-prep>meal prep recipes</a> for ideas. From marinated tofu to seasoned shrimp, 0.25 cup of sunflower oil is a versatile base.

<h3>Adjusting oil quantities for different foods</h3>  
<p>Denser foods like frozen chips might need slightly more oil (up to 3 oz), while delicate items like fish require less. Always start with 0.25 cup (2 oz) and adjust as needed. This ensures your air fryer meals are golden, not greasy.</p>

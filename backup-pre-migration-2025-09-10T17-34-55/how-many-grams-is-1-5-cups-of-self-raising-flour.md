<p>1.5 cups of self-raising flour equals approximately 195 grams. This conversion is essential for precise baking, especially when using an air fryer where measurements can make or break a recipe. Whether you're whipping up cakes, muffins, or bread, knowing the exact weight ensures consistency and perfect results every time.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Flour Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Baking is a science, and even small deviations in flour measurements can affect texture and rise. Self-raising flour contains baking powder, so incorrect amounts can lead to dense or overly airy bakes. For air fryer recipes, where cooking times are shorter, precision is even more critical. A kitchen scale is your best friend here, but if you don’t have one, our conversion guide will help. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more handy tips.</p>  

<p>Many bakers rely on cups, but weight (grams) is far more reliable. Flour can settle or be packed differently, leading to inconsistencies. For example, 1.5 cups of self-raising flour in the UK might differ slightly from US measurements due to cup size variations. Always aim for 195 grams for the best results in your air fryer creations.</p>  

<h2>Converting Cups to Grams for Self-Raising Flour</h2>  
<p>Self-raising flour is lighter than plain flour due to the added raising agents. One cup typically weighs around 130 grams, so 1.5 cups equal roughly 195 grams. This conversion is vital for recipes like scones or sponges, where the right rise is crucial. If you’re adapting a traditional oven recipe for the air fryer, precise measurements ensure even cooking.</p>  

<p>For those who love baking, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> section has plenty of ideas to try. From fluffy cakes to crispy bread, accurate flour measurements are the first step to success. Remember, 1.5 cups of self-raising flour in grams is 195, but always double-check with a scale if possible.</p>  

<h3>UK vs. US Cup Measurements</h3>  
<p>In the UK, a standard cup holds 250ml, while in the US, it’s 240ml. This slight difference can affect your baking, especially with flour. For 1.5 cups of self-raising flour, UK bakers should use 195 grams, while US bakers might find 190 grams more accurate. When in doubt, weigh it out!</p>  

<h2>Common Baking Recipes Using 1.5 Cups of Self-Raising Flour</h2>  
<p>Many classic bakes call for 1.5 cups of self-raising flour. Think Victoria sponge, banana bread, or even air fryer doughnuts. These recipes rely on the flour’s raising agents for lift and texture. Using the correct gram measurement ensures your bakes are light, fluffy, and perfectly cooked in the air fryer.</p>  

<p>For inspiration, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>cake recipes</a> designed for air fryers. Whether you’re a beginner or a pro, knowing how many grams 1.5 cups of self-raising flour weighs will elevate your baking game. And don’t forget to keep your air fryer in top shape with our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning tips</a>.</p>  

<h3>Tips for Measuring Flour Without a Scale</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a scale, fluff the flour with a fork before scooping it into the cup. Level it off with a knife for accuracy. Avoid packing the flour down, as this can lead to over-measuring. For 1.5 cups of self-raising flour, aim for a light, aerated consistency to hit that 195-gram mark.</p>  

<h2>Adjusting Recipes for Air Fryer Baking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers cook faster and more evenly than conventional ovens, so recipes often need tweaking. When converting, ensure your 1.5 cups of self-raising flour (195 grams) is measured precisely to avoid dry or dense results. Reduce cooking times by 20% and check frequently for doneness.</p>

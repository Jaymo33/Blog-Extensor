<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>
<p>Using the right amount of ingredients is crucial for air fryer success.

For recipe ideas, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipes section</a>.</p>
<p>Air fryers work best when ingredients are evenly spaced, so measuring 0.375 cup (3 oz) of canned beans ensures optimal results. This is especially useful for batch cooking or meal prep, where consistency is key.

<h2>How to Measure 0.375 Cup of Canned Beans</h2>
<p>Measuring 0.375 cup of canned beans is simple with the right tools. Use a standard measuring cup and fill it just under halfway for an accurate 0.375 cup (3 oz) portion. Drain the beans first to avoid excess liquid, which can affect cooking times. For more precision, a kitchen scale can confirm the weight in ounces.</p>
<p>If you don’t have a 0.375 cup measure, you can use tablespoons—6 tablespoons equal 0.375 cup. This method works well for smaller batches or when scaling recipes. Remember, 0.375 cup of canned beans is 3 oz, whether you’re cooking for one or meal prepping for the week.</p>

<h3>Common Uses for 0.375 Cup of Canned Beans</h3>
<p>This measurement is perfect for adding protein to air fryer dishes. Try 0.375 cup (3 oz) of canned beans in veggie patties, stuffed peppers, or as a topping for air-fried nachos. The versatility of beans makes them a staple in many <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable-based recipes</a>.</p>

<h3>Tips for Storing Leftover Canned Beans</h3>
<p>If you have leftover beans from your 0.375 cup portion, store them in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 3 days. You can also freeze them for longer storage.

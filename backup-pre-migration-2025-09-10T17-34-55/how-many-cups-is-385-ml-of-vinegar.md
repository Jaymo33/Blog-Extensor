<p>385 ml of vinegar equals approximately 1.63 US cups or 1.35 UK cups. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes, where precise measurements ensure the perfect balance of flavours. Whether you're marinating chicken or whipping up a tangy glaze, knowing how to convert millilitres to cups makes cooking effortless.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Vinegar Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of vinegar in air fryer recipes ensures your dishes aren’t too acidic or bland. A slight miscalculation can throw off the taste, especially in marinades or dressings. For example, a recipe calling for 385 ml of vinegar needs exactly 1.63 US cups to maintain the intended flavour profile. If you're following a UK recipe, 1.35 UK cups will give you the correct measurement.</p>  

<p>At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we emphasise precision in measurements for consistent results. Whether you're making crispy chicken wings or a zesty salad dressing, converting 385 ml of vinegar to cups correctly ensures your dish turns out perfectly every time. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for other common measurement swaps.</p>  

<h3>US vs UK Cup Measurements</h3>  
<p>It’s important to note that US and UK cup measurements differ slightly. A US cup holds 240 ml, while a UK cup is 284 ml. This means 385 ml of vinegar translates to 1.63 US cups but only 1.35 UK cups. Always check which measurement system your recipe uses to avoid errors.</p>  

<h2>How to Measure 385 ml of Vinegar Without a Scale</h2>  
<p>If you don’t have a measuring jug, you can still measure 385 ml of vinegar using standard cups. For US cups, fill one cup (240 ml) and then add roughly two-thirds of another cup. For UK cups, one full cup (284 ml) plus a little over a quarter cup will get you close to 385 ml.</p>  

<p>For more precise measurements, consider using a liquid measuring jug with millilitre markings. This is especially useful for air fryer recipes where exact proportions matter. Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a> for dishes that make the most of vinegar’s tangy kick.</p>  

<h3>Common Uses for 385 ml of Vinegar in Air Fryer Cooking</h3>  
<p>Vinegar is a versatile ingredient in air fryer recipes. From tenderising meats to adding acidity to sauces, 385 ml of vinegar can be used in marinades, pickling brines, or even as a natural cleaner for your air fryer basket. A mix of vinegar and water helps remove stubborn grease, keeping your appliance in top condition.</p>  

<h2>Converting Other Vinegar Quantities</h2>  
<p>Need to convert a different amount of vinegar? The same principles apply. For example, 250 ml of vinegar is roughly 1.06 US cups or 0.88 UK cups. Keeping a conversion chart handy, like the one on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, simplifies cooking and baking.</p>  

<p>If you're working with larger quantities, remember that 1000 ml (1 litre) of vinegar equals about 4.23 US cups or 3.52 UK cups. Whether you're scaling up a recipe or adjusting on the fly, these conversions ensure accuracy.

<h3>Vinegar Substitutes in Air Fryer Recipes</h3>  
<p>If you run out of vinegar, lemon juice or white wine can often be used as substitutes. However, the flavour profile will change slightly, so adjust other seasonings accordingly. For 385 ml of vinegar, you could use 385 ml of lemon juice, but reduce any added salt to balance the acidity.</p>

<p>4 tablespoons (tbsp) of sunflower oil weigh approximately 54 grams (g). This conversion is essential for precise cooking, especially when using an air fryer, where accurate measurements can make or break a recipe. Whether you’re frying, baking, or roasting, knowing the exact weight ensures consistent results. For more air fryer conversions, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air frying</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on hot air circulation to cook food evenly, and using the right amount of oil is crucial. Too much oil can make food greasy, while too little may result in dry or unevenly cooked dishes. Converting 4 tbsp of sunflower oil to grams (54g) helps maintain the perfect balance. This precision is especially important for recipes like crispy fries or golden chicken wings. Visit <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>our recipe collection</a> for more inspiration.</p>  

<p>Sunflower oil is a popular choice for air frying due to its high smoke point and neutral flavour. Measuring it correctly ensures your food cooks evenly without excess oil pooling at the bottom. If you’re new to air frying, start with smaller quantities and adjust as needed. For cleaning tips, explore our guide on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>how to clean your air fryer</a>.</p>  

<h3>How to measure sunflower oil for air frying</h3>  
<p>Using a kitchen scale is the most accurate way to measure 4 tbsp of sunflower oil in grams. Simply pour the oil into a measuring spoon and weigh it to confirm it’s 54g. If you don’t have a scale, levelling off the tablespoons ensures consistency. For recipes requiring precise oil amounts, like those in our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken category</a>, accuracy is key.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for 4 tbsp of sunflower oil in air fryers</h2>  
<p>Four tablespoons of sunflower oil (54g) is often used for coating vegetables, marinating meats, or creating crispy textures. It’s perfect for recipes like air-fried potatoes or breaded chicken. The oil helps achieve that golden crunch without deep frying. For more ideas, browse our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/potatoes>potato recipes</a>.</p>  

<p>Sunflower oil’s light flavour makes it versatile for both savoury and sweet dishes. Whether you’re making onion rings or doughnuts, 4 tbsp (54g) provides just enough fat for even cooking. Remember, air fryers require less oil than traditional methods, so sticking to measurements like this ensures healthier results.</p>  

<h3>Tips for substituting sunflower oil in air fryer recipes</h3>  
<p>If you’re out of sunflower oil, you can substitute it with other oils like rapeseed or vegetable oil, keeping the 54g measurement for 4 tbsp. Avoid heavier oils like olive oil for high-temperature cooking, as they can smoke. For more substitution tips, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>homepage</a>.</p>

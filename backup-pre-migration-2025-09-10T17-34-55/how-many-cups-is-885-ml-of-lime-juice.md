<p>885 ml of lime juice is equal to approximately 3.74 cups. This conversion is essential for recipes requiring precise measurements, especially when using an air fryer. Whether you're making zesty marinades, tangy desserts, or refreshing drinks, knowing how to convert millilitres to cups ensures your dish turns out perfectly.</p>  

<h2>Understanding Lime Juice Measurements</h2>  
<p>When working with lime juice in recipes, accuracy matters. Too much or too little can throw off the balance of flavours, particularly in air fryer dishes where ingredients cook quickly. The standard conversion for liquids is 1 cup equals 236.588 ml, so 885 ml divided by this gives roughly 3.74 cups. For most home cooks, rounding to 3.75 cups works perfectly fine.</p>  

<p>If you're using an air fryer for recipes like lime-glazed chicken or citrus-infused desserts, precise measurements ensure consistent results. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more handy measurement tips. Lime juice is often used in marinades, dressings, and even baking, so having this conversion at your fingertips saves time.</p>  

<h3>Why Measuring Lime Juice Accurately Matters</h3>  
<p>Lime juice adds acidity and brightness to dishes, but its potency means even small deviations can alter taste. In air fryer cooking, where ingredients cook faster than in conventional ovens, precise measurements prevent overpowering flavours. For example, a lime-infused shrimp recipe might call for exact amounts to balance the dish perfectly.</p>  

<h2>Converting 885 ml Lime Juice for Baking and Cooking</h2>  
<p>Baking often requires exact measurements, and lime juice is no exception. If a cake or cookie recipe calls for 885 ml of lime juice, knowing it’s roughly 3.75 cups helps avoid mishaps. Air fryer baking, like making lime drizzle cakes, benefits from precise conversions to ensure even cooking and perfect texture.</p>  

<p>For savoury dishes, such as lime-marinated meats or fish, the same rule applies. Too much lime juice can make proteins tough, while too little might leave the dish bland.

Whether you're cooking for one or meal prepping, accurate measurements make all the difference.</p>

<h3>Adjusting Recipes for Personal Taste</h3>

For a stronger kick, add a little extra—just be mindful of how it affects the overall dish, especially in air fryer cooking where flavours concentrate.</p>  

<h2>Cleaning Up After Using Lime Juice</h2>

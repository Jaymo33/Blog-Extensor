<h2>Why accurate jam measurements matter</h2>
<p>Using the correct amount of jam is crucial for achieving the right texture and flavour in your dishes. Too much jam can make baked goods soggy, while too little might leave them dry. In air fryer recipes, precise measurements help ensure even cooking and perfect results. Many of our favourite <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> call for specific jam quantities to create that ideal balance.</p>

<p>When converting between volume and weight measurements, it's important to consider the jam's consistency. Thicker jams like marmalade might weigh slightly more per tablespoon than runnier varieties. For consistent results, we recommend using digital kitchen scales when measuring ingredients for your air fryer creations.</p>

<h2>How to measure 1 tbsp of jam accurately</h2>
<p>The most accurate way to measure jam is by using proper measuring spoons and levelling off the excess. For sticky ingredients like jam, lightly greasing the spoon can help it slide off more easily. Alternatively, you can use a small spatula to scrape out every last bit. If you're working with particularly thick jam, warming it slightly can make it easier to measure.</p>

<h3>Using digital scales for precision</h3>
<p>Digital kitchen scales offer the most precise way to measure 1 tbsp of jam in grams. Simply place your container on the scale, tare it to zero, then add your jam until you reach 20 grams. This method eliminates any guesswork and ensures perfect results every time, especially important for delicate <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>air fryer desserts</a>.</p>

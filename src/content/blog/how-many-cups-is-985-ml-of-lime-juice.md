<p>985 ml of lime juice is equivalent to approximately 4.16 cups. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements can make or break a dish. Whether you're preparing a zesty marinade, a tangy dessert, or a refreshing beverage, knowing how to convert millilitres to cups ensures accuracy. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we understand the importance of getting measurements right for perfect results every time.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Lime Juice Measurements Matter</h2>
<p>Using the correct amount of lime juice in your air fryer recipes ensures balanced flavours and optimal cooking results. Too little juice can leave your dish lacking brightness, while too much can overpower other ingredients. For example, a marinade for chicken or shrimp requires precise acidity to tenderise without becoming overly sour. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipes</a> section offers plenty of inspiration for dishes where lime juice plays a starring role.</p>
<p>Converting 985 ml of lime juice to cups is particularly useful for larger batches, such as meal prep or family-sized portions. Whether you're cooking for one or a crowd, knowing that 985 ml equals roughly 4.16 cups helps streamline your preparation. This measurement is also handy when scaling recipes up or down, ensuring consistency across different serving sizes.</p>

<h2>How to Measure 985 ml of Lime Juice Without a Measuring Cup</h2>
<p>If you don't have a measuring cup handy, there are other ways to measure 985 ml of lime juice. A standard UK metric measuring jug will have millilitre markings, making it easy to measure out the exact amount. Alternatively, you can use a kitchen scale, as 985 ml of lime juice weighs approximately 985 grams due to its similar density to water.</p>
<p>For those who prefer visual cues, 985 ml of lime juice fills about two-thirds of a standard 1.5-litre bottle. This can be helpful when you're in a pinch and need a rough estimate. However, for baking or precise cooking, we recommend using proper measuring tools to ensure accuracy. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more handy measurement tips.</p>

<h3>Converting 985 ml of Lime Juice for Different Cup Sizes</h3>
<p>It's worth noting that cup measurements can vary slightly between countries. In the UK, 1 cup is typically 250 ml, while in the US, it's 240 ml. This means 985 ml of lime juice equals 3.94 US cups or 4.16 UK cups. For most practical purposes, the difference is negligible, but it's something to keep in mind for precision baking.</p>

<h2>Using 985 ml of Lime Juice in Air Fryer Recipes</h2>
<p>985 ml of lime juice is perfect for larger batches of air fryer dishes like citrus-marinated chicken wings or lime-infused shrimp. The acidity helps tenderise proteins while adding a refreshing zing. For example, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipes</a> often call for lime juice as a key ingredient in marinades and glazes.</p>
<p>When working with lime juice in your air fryer, remember that acidic ingredients can sometimes react with certain basket materials. To avoid any issues, consider using <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner</a> regularly to maintain your appliance. This ensures your air fryer stays in top condition, ready for your next culinary adventure.</p>

<h3>Storing Leftover Lime Juice</h3>
<p>If you have leftover lime juice after measuring out 985 ml, store it in an airtight container in the fridge for up to a week. You can also freeze lime juice in ice cube trays for longer storage, perfect for adding a burst of flavour to future air fryer dishes. This way, you'll always have lime juice on hand when inspiration strikes.</p>

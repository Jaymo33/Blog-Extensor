<h2>Why Accurate Lime Juice Measurements Matter</h2>
<p>Using the correct amount of lime juice in your air fryer recipes ensures balanced flavours and optimal cooking results. Too little juice can leave your dish lacking brightness, while too much can overpower other ingredients. For example, a marinade for chicken or shrimp requires precise acidity to tenderise without becoming overly sour. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipes</a> section offers plenty of inspiration for dishes where lime juice plays a starring role.</p>
<p>Converting 985 ml of lime juice to cups is particularly useful for larger batches, such as meal prep or family-sized portions. Whether you're cooking for one or a crowd, knowing that 985 ml equals roughly 4.16 cups helps streamline your preparation. This measurement is also handy when scaling recipes up or down, ensuring consistency across different serving sizes.</p>

<h2>How to Measure 985 ml of Lime Juice Without a Measuring Cup</h2>
<p>If you don't have a measuring cup handy, there are other ways to measure 985 ml of lime juice. A standard UK metric measuring jug will have millilitre markings, making it easy to measure out the exact amount. Alternatively, you can use a kitchen scale, as 985 ml of lime juice weighs approximately 985 grams due to its similar density to water.</p>
<p>For those who prefer visual cues, 985 ml of lime juice fills about two-thirds of a standard 1.5-litre bottle. This can be helpful when you're in a pinch and need a rough estimate.

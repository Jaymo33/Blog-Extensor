<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>
<p>Air fryers rely on even heat distribution, and incorrect measurements can lead to uneven cooking or overly dense textures.

If you're new to air frying, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a> offers plenty of inspiration with precise measurements.</p>
<p>Many UK cooks struggle with cup-to-ounce conversions, especially for ingredients like ground cinnamon, which can vary in density. Using a kitchen scale is the most reliable method, but our guide simplifies the process. For example, 1.33 cups of ground cinnamon translates to roughly 5.3 ounces, a handy reference for quick recipes. Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert recipes</a> to put this conversion to good use.</p>

<h2>How to measure ground cinnamon correctly</h2>
<p>Measuring ground cinnamon by volume (cups) can be tricky due to its fine texture. For the most accurate results, fluff the cinnamon with a spoon before lightly scooping it into a measuring cup.

If you're converting 1.33 cups of ground cinnamon to ounces, remember that 1 cup equals roughly 4 ounces, making 1.33 cups about 5.3 ounces.</p>

<h3>Using a kitchen scale for precision</h3>
<p>A digital kitchen scale is the best tool for converting 1.33 cups of ground cinnamon to ounces. Simply tare your scale with an empty bowl, then add the cinnamon until it reaches 5.3 ounces. This method eliminates guesswork and ensures your air fryer recipes turn out perfectly every time.

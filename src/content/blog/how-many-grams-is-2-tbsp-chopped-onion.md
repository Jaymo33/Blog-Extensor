<p>2 tablespoons (tbsp) of chopped onion weigh approximately 20 grams. This measurement is essential for air fryer recipes where precision ensures even cooking and perfect flavour. Whether you’re preparing a stir-fry, casserole, or seasoning mix, knowing the exact weight helps avoid over or under-seasoning.

<h2>Why accurate onion measurements matter in air frying</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on even heat distribution, so ingredient consistency is crucial. Too much onion can release excess moisture, leading to soggy results, while too little may leave your dish lacking flavour. Chopped onion is a common ingredient in many air fryer recipes, from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable dishes</a> to marinades. Measuring by weight (grams) rather than volume (tablespoons) ensures accuracy, especially since onion pieces can vary in size and density.</p>  

<p>If you’re following a recipe from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, you’ll notice many provide both volume and weight measurements. This helps home cooks achieve restaurant-quality results. A digital kitchen scale is a worthwhile investment for anyone serious about air frying, as it eliminates guesswork and improves consistency.</p>  

<h3>How to measure chopped onion correctly</h3>  
<p>For the most accurate 2 tbsp to grams conversion, finely chop your onion uniformly. Pack the tablespoon lightly—don’t press down, as this compresses the onion and skews the measurement. If your recipe calls for 20g and you only have tablespoons, two level tbsp should suffice. Remember, onion size affects density; a finely minced 2 tbsp may weigh slightly more than roughly chopped.</p>  

<h2>Common recipes using 2 tbsp chopped onion</h2>  
<p>Many air fryer dishes use this quantity, including omelettes, stuffed peppers, or <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken seasonings</a>. It’s also a base measurement for sauces and dips. Since air fryers cook quickly, pre-measuring ingredients like onion ensures everything is ready to go when the cooking starts. No last-minute chopping means less stress and better results.</p>

From crispy onion toppings to savoury fillings, precise measurements make all the difference. And if you’re scaling a recipe up or down, knowing that 2 tbsp equals roughly 20g makes adjustments simple.</p>  

<h3>Storing pre-chopped onion for convenience</h3>  
<p>If you frequently use 2 tbsp portions, consider pre-chopping and freezing onions in 20g batches. This saves time and reduces waste. Just thaw before use, pat dry if excess moisture appears, and they’re ready for your air fryer. Proper storage keeps flavour intact—use airtight containers or freezer bags.</p>

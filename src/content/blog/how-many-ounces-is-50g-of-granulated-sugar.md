<p>50g of granulated sugar equals approximately 1.76 ounces. This conversion is essential for precise baking and air fryer recipes, ensuring your dishes turn out perfectly every time. Whether you're whipping up a cake or caramelising sugar for a dessert, knowing this measurement can make all the difference.</p>

<h2>Why accurate sugar measurements matter</h2>
<p>Getting the right amount of granulated sugar is crucial, especially in air fryer recipes where precision affects texture and taste. Too much sugar can lead to overly sweet or burnt results, while too little might leave your dish lacking flavour. For example, a <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>classic sponge cake</a> relies on the perfect sugar balance to rise properly.</p>
<p>Granulated sugar is a staple in many <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert recipes</a>, from cookies to crumbles. If you're adapting a recipe from grams to ounces, this conversion ensures consistency. Air fryers cook quickly, so even small measurement errors can have noticeable effects.</p>

<h2>How to measure 50g of granulated sugar</h2>
<p>If you don’t have a digital scale, you can use measuring spoons or cups to approximate 50g of granulated sugar. One tablespoon of granulated sugar weighs around 12.5g, so four tablespoons will give you roughly 50g. For ounces, this translates to just under two ounces.</p>
<p>For those who prefer volume measurements, 50g of granulated sugar is about a quarter cup. However, weighing ingredients is always more accurate, especially for <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversions</a>. A small kitchen scale is a worthwhile investment for any home baker.</p>

<h3>Converting other sugar quantities</h3>
<p>If your recipe calls for a different amount of granulated sugar, the same principle applies. For instance, 100g of granulated sugar equals roughly 3.53 ounces. Keeping a <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a> handy can save time and reduce errors.</p>

<h2>Common uses for 50g of granulated sugar</h2>
<p>This quantity is often used in small-batch recipes, such as single-serving desserts or glazes. For example, a <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>vanilla cupcake</a> might require 50g of granulated sugar for the perfect sweetness. Air fryers excel at these smaller portions, making them ideal for testing new recipes.</p>
<p>Granulated sugar also plays a role in savoury dishes, like balancing the acidity in a tomato-based sauce. Whether you're baking or cooking, knowing how to convert 50g to ounces ensures your dish turns out as intended.</p>

<h3>Tips for measuring sugar in an air fryer</h3>
<p>Air fryers circulate hot air, which can cause sugars to caramelise or burn faster than in a conventional oven. Measuring accurately helps prevent this. If you're coating fruit or making a glaze, 50g of granulated sugar is often the sweet spot.</p>

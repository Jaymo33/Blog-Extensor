<p>3 tablespoons (tbsp) of mayonnaise weigh approximately 45 grams in the UK. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements can make or break a dish. Whether you’re making crispy chicken or a quick mayo-based dip, knowing the exact weight ensures consistency. For more air fryer conversions, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate mayonnaise measurements matter</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of mayonnaise in your air fryer recipes ensures the perfect texture and flavour. Too much mayo can make dishes greasy, while too little might leave them dry. For example, a <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>mayo-coated chicken recipe</a> relies on the correct 3 tbsp to grams ratio for crispy, juicy results. Accurate measurements also help with portion control, especially if you’re tracking calories or macros.</p>  

<p>Mayonnaise density can vary slightly between brands, but 3 tbsp generally equals 45 grams. If you’re using a thicker or lighter mayo, consider weighing it for precision. For more tips on perfecting air fryer meals, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipe category</a>.</p>  

<h3>How to measure mayonnaise without scales</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have kitchen scales, use a standard UK tablespoon (15ml) to measure mayonnaise. Fill it level for accuracy, and avoid packing it down. Three level tablespoons will give you roughly 45 grams. For sticky ingredients like mayo, a silicone spatula helps scrape every bit out of the spoon.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for 3 tbsp of mayonnaise in air fryer recipes</h2>  
<p>Three tablespoons of mayonnaise (45g) is a versatile quantity for many air fryer dishes. It’s perfect for coating chicken breasts, making crispy potatoes, or creating a quick dipping sauce. For example, mix 3 tbsp mayo with herbs for a flavourful <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/potatoes>potato wedge glaze</a>. The mayo helps achieve a golden, crispy finish in the air fryer.</p>  

<p>You can also use this amount to bind breadcrumbs for fish or veggie patties. If you’re meal prepping, 3 tbsp of mayo divides neatly into single servings. For more inspiration, browse our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/meal-prep>meal prep recipes</a>.</p>  

<h3>Converting other mayonnaise quantities</h3>  
<p>Need to adjust your recipe? Here’s a quick guide: 1 tbsp mayo = 15g, 2 tbsp = 30g, and 4 tbsp = 60g. These conversions work for most UK mayonnaise brands.

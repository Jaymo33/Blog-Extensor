<h2>Understanding Butter Measurements</h2>
<p>Butter is a staple in many air fryer recipes, from cakes to roasted vegetables. Measuring it accurately is crucial, especially when converting between grams and cups. In the UK, butter is often sold in 250g blocks, making 225g a common measurement for recipes.

<p>When converting 225 grams of butter to cups, it’s important to note that US and UK cup measurements differ slightly. A US cup is 240ml, while a UK cup is 250ml. This means 225g of butter is roughly 1 US cup or just under 1 UK cup. For precise baking, using a kitchen scale is always best.

<h3>Why Accuracy Matters in Air Fryer Cooking</h3>

<h2>Converting 225 Grams of Butter to Cups</h2>
<p>To convert 225 grams of butter to cups, you’ll need to consider the density of butter. Butter is denser than water, so 225g takes up less space than 225ml. In the US, 1 cup of butter is about 227g, so 225g is just under 1 cup. In the UK, 1 cup is roughly 250g, so 225g is about 0.9 cups.

<p>If you don’t have a scale, you can use measuring cups, but be aware that packing butter into a cup can affect the measurement. For best results, soften the butter slightly before measuring. This ensures an accurate 225 grams of butter in cups for your air fryer recipes.

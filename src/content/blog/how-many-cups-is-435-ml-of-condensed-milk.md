<p>435 ml of condensed milk is approximately 1.84 cups when measured in standard US cups. This conversion is essential for baking and cooking, especially when using an air fryer for desserts like fudge or cakes. Whether you're following a recipe from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> or improvising, knowing this measurement ensures consistency.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Precision is key in baking, and condensed milk is no exception. Too much or too little can alter the texture and sweetness of your dish. For air fryer recipes, such as those found in our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>dessert section</a>, exact measurements ensure even cooking and perfect results. Condensed milk is thick and sticky, so using the right amount avoids overly dense or runny outcomes.</p>

<h3>How to Measure 435 ml of Condensed Milk</h3>  
<p>To measure 435 ml of condensed milk accurately, use a liquid measuring cup with clear markings. Pour slowly to avoid air bubbles, and level off the top with a spatula.

For air fryer recipes, like those in our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>cake category</a>, precision ensures even baking.</p>

<h3>Adjusting Recipes for Different Cup Sizes</h3>  
<p>Note that US and UK cup sizes differ slightly (1 US cup = 240 ml, 1 UK cup = 250 ml). For 435 ml of condensed milk, this means roughly 1.81 UK cups or 1.84 US cups. Most recipes on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> use US measurements, so double-check if adapting from another source. Small variations can affect air fryer baking times.</p>  

<h2>Tips for Working With Condensed Milk</h2>  
<p>Condensed milk is sticky, so lightly greasing your measuring cup or spoon helps it slide out easily. For air fryer recipes, warming the can slightly (in warm water) makes pouring smoother. If you’re scaling a recipe up or down, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion guide</a> simplifies adjustments.

<p>0.5 tbsp of mayonnaise weighs approximately 7 grams. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements can make all the difference. Whether you're whipping up a quick sauce or coating ingredients for a crispy finish, knowing the exact weight ensures consistency. For more handy conversions, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>
<p>Air fryers rely on even heat distribution to cook food perfectly, and precise ingredient measurements help achieve this. Using 0.5 tbsp of mayonnaise, which converts to roughly 7 grams, ensures your dishes aren’t overly greasy or dry. This is especially important for recipes like crispy chicken or roasted vegetables, where the right amount of fat is key. Visit <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>our recipe collection</a> for inspiration on how to use mayonnaise in your air fryer.</p>

<p>Mayonnaise is a versatile ingredient, but too much or too little can alter the texture and taste of your dish. For example, 0.5 tbsp of mayonnaise (7 grams) is ideal for coating small batches of food. If you’re meal prepping or cooking for a crowd, you’ll need to scale up accordingly. Always measure carefully to avoid disappointing results.</p>

<h2>How to measure 0.5 tbsp of mayonnaise accurately</h2>
<p>Measuring 0.5 tbsp of mayonnaise can be tricky if you don’t have the right tools. A standard tablespoon holds 15 ml, so half of that is 7.5 ml, which weighs about 7 grams. For the most accurate results, use a kitchen scale to weigh the mayonnaise directly. This eliminates guesswork and ensures your air fryer dishes turn out perfectly every time.</p>

<h3>Using a kitchen scale for precision</h3>
<p>A digital kitchen scale is the best way to measure 0.5 tbsp of mayonnaise in grams. Simply place your bowl or container on the scale, tare it to zero, and add the mayonnaise until it reads 7 grams. This method is far more reliable than eyeballing or using measuring spoons, especially for sticky ingredients like mayonnaise.</p>

<h2>Common recipes using 0.5 tbsp of mayonnaise</h2>
<p>Many air fryer recipes call for small amounts of mayonnaise, such as 0.5 tbsp (7 grams). This quantity is perfect for making a light coating for chicken wings, fish fillets, or even roasted potatoes. For a delicious twist, try our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>air fryer chicken recipes</a>, where mayonnaise helps create a crispy, golden crust.</p>

<p>Another great use for 0.5 tbsp of mayonnaise is in marinades or dips. Mix it with herbs and spices for a quick sauce, or blend it into breadcrumbs for extra crunch. The possibilities are endless, and with precise measurements, you’ll never go wrong. Don’t forget to explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable recipes</a> for more ideas.</p>

<h2>Tips for storing and using mayonnaise in air fryer recipes</h2>
<p>Mayonnaise can spoil if not stored properly, so always keep it refrigerated and check the expiry date. When measuring 0.5 tbsp (7 grams), use a clean spoon to avoid contamination. For best results in air fryer cooking, spread the mayonnaise evenly over your ingredients to ensure uniform crisping. And if you’re looking for ways to keep your air fryer clean, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning guide</a> has you covered.</p>

<h3>Substitutes for mayonnaise in air fryer cooking</h3>
<p>If you’re out of mayonnaise or prefer a lighter option, Greek yogurt or sour cream can work as substitutes. However, keep in mind that 0.5 tbsp of these alternatives may weigh slightly differently. Always adjust measurements accordingly to maintain the right consistency in your recipes.</p>

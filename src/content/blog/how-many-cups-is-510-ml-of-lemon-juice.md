<p>510 ml of lemon juice equals approximately 2.15 cups in standard US measurements. For UK cup measurements, it’s roughly 2.25 cups due to slight variations in cup sizes. Whether you're whipping up a zesty marinade or baking a tangy dessert, knowing this conversion ensures your air fryer recipes turn out perfectly every time.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Lemon Juice Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Precision is key when working with lemon juice, especially in air fryer recipes where balance is everything. Too much acidity can overpower a dish, while too little might leave it bland. For example, a <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>lemon drizzle cake</a> requires just the right amount of lemon juice to achieve that perfect tang. Using 510 ml (or 2.15 cups) ensures consistency, whether you're cooking for a crowd or meal prepping.</p>  

<p>Lemon juice also plays a crucial role in marinades, like those for <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>air fryer chicken</a>, where it tenderises the meat. A slight miscalculation could affect texture and flavour. That’s why keeping a <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a> handy is a game-changer for home cooks.</p>  

<h3>US vs. UK Cup Measurements</h3>  
<p>It’s worth noting that US and UK cup sizes differ slightly. In the US, 1 cup equals 240 ml, while in the UK, it’s 250 ml. So, 510 ml converts to 2.15 US cups or 2.25 UK cups. This small discrepancy might not matter for casual cooking, but for baking—like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>air fryer cakes</a>—it’s best to stick to one system.</p>  

<h2>How to Measure 510 ml of Lemon Juice Without a Scale</h2>  
<p>If you don’t have a measuring jug, you can use standard kitchen tools. A US cup holds 240 ml, so 510 ml is just over 2 cups (480 ml) plus 2 tablespoons (30 ml). For UK cooks, 2 cups (500 ml) plus a teaspoon (10 ml) will get you close. Freshly squeezed lemon juice works best, but bottled juice is fine if strained for pulp.</p>  

<p>For recipes like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>air fryer desserts</a>, accuracy ensures the right balance of sweetness and acidity. Always taste as you go—especially with citrus, as fruit acidity can vary. And don’t forget to <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>clean your air fryer</a> after cooking with sticky lemon-based sauces!</p>  

<h3>Common Recipes Using 510 ml of Lemon Juice</h3>  
<p>This quantity is ideal for batch cooking, such as lemon curd or salad dressings. It’s also perfect for marinating proteins like shrimp or tofu in your air fryer. The bright flavour cuts through richness, making it a staple in healthier cooking.</p>

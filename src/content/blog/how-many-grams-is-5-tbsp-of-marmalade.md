<p>5 tablespoons of marmalade equals approximately 100 grams, making it easy to measure for air fryer recipes or baking. This conversion ensures accuracy, whether you’re whipping up a glaze or adding sweetness to a dish. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we know precise measurements are key to perfect results, especially when using an air fryer.</p>  

<h2>Why Convert Tablespoons to Grams?</h2>  
<p>Converting tablespoons to grams is essential for consistency in cooking and baking. Marmalade’s thickness can vary, so weight measurements eliminate guesswork. If you’re following a recipe from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>our collection</a>, grams ensure you get the right balance of sweetness and texture. Air fryer recipes, in particular, benefit from precise measurements to avoid overly sticky or dry outcomes.</p>  

<p>Using a kitchen scale is the easiest way to measure 5 tbsp of marmalade in grams. Simply spoon the marmalade into a bowl on the scale until it hits 100g. No scale? A heaped UK tablespoon holds roughly 20g of marmalade, so 5 tbsp will be close to 100g. For more conversions, check our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>handy air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>  

<h3>How Marmalade Consistency Affects Weight</h3>  
<p>Thicker marmalade will weigh slightly more per tablespoon than runny varieties. If your marmalade is very dense, you might find 5 tbsp is closer to 110g. For recipes where precision matters, like air fryer cakes or glazes, always opt for weight measurements. This is especially useful for <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert recipes</a> where texture is crucial.</p>  

<h2>Using Marmalade in Air Fryer Recipes</h2>  
<p>Marmalade adds a lovely citrusy sweetness to air fryer dishes, from glazed meats to baked goods. Knowing that 5 tbsp equals 100g helps you adjust recipes effortlessly. Try brushing marmalade over chicken or salmon in the air fryer for a sticky, caramelised finish. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipes</a> section has great ideas to experiment with.</p>  

<p>For baking, marmalade can be used in cakes or pastries. If a recipe calls for 100g of marmalade, you now know that’s 5 tbsp. This ensures your air fryer bakes turn out perfectly every time. Remember to clean your air fryer basket afterwards—sticky residues can be tricky! Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning guide</a> makes it simple.</p>  

<h3>Tips for Measuring Sticky Ingredients</h3>  
<p>To measure marmalade easily, lightly grease your spoon or cup first. This helps the marmalade slide off cleanly, giving you an accurate 5 tbsp (100g). If you’re scaling a recipe up or down, keep the 20g-per-tbsp ratio in mind.

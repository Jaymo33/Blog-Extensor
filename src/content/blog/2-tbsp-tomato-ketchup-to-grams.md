<p>2 tablespoons (tbsp) of tomato ketchup weigh approximately 30 grams in the UK. This measurement is essential for air fryer recipes where precision ensures the best results. Whether you’re making glazes, marinades, or sauces, knowing the exact weight helps maintain consistency. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we focus on accurate conversions to elevate your cooking. Let’s dive deeper into why this matters and how to use it.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate ketchup measurements matter</h2>  
<p>Using the correct amount of tomato ketchup ensures your air fryer dishes have the right balance of sweetness and acidity. Too much can overpower other flavours, while too little might leave your meal lacking. For recipes like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>air fryer chicken wings</a>, 30 grams of ketchup per 2 tablespoons is ideal for a sticky glaze. Consistency is key, especially when scaling up or down for larger batches. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> simplifies this process.</p>  

<p>Many store-bought sauces, including ketchup, vary slightly in density due to sugar content or brand differences. However, 30 grams per 2 tbsp is a reliable standard for UK measurements. If you’re adapting a recipe from cups or ounces, this conversion ensures accuracy. For more tips, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> section, where precision meets flavour.</p>  

<h3>How to measure 2 tbsp of tomato ketchup without scales</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a kitchen scale, use a standard UK tablespoon (15ml) to measure ketchup. Fill it level for accuracy, scraping off any excess with a knife. Two level tablespoons will give you roughly 30 grams. For thicker sauces, avoid compacting the ketchup to prevent over-measuring. This method works well for quick recipes like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>air-fried vegetables</a> with a ketchup dip.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for 2 tbsp of tomato ketchup in air fryers</h2>  
<p>Tomato ketchup isn’t just for burgers—it’s a versatile ingredient in air fryer cooking. A 30-gram portion (2 tbsp) can be mixed with spices for a quick glaze on meats or brushed onto <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/potatoes>air fryer potatoes</a> before cooking. It also works as a base for homemade BBQ sauce or a tangy dip for crispy snacks. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we recommend keeping these conversions handy for effortless meal prep.</p>  

<p>For cleaning sticky ketchup residue from your air fryer basket, check out our guide on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner</a>. Proper maintenance ensures your appliance stays in top condition for all your saucy creations. Remember, precise measurements like 2 tbsp (30g) of ketchup help avoid messy spills and uneven cooking.</p>  

<h3>Does brand affect the weight of tomato ketchup?</h3>  
<p>While most UK tomato ketchups weigh around 30 grams per 2 tbsp, slight variations exist between brands. Thicker, premium ketchups may weigh slightly more due to higher tomato content, while budget versions could be less dense. For consistent results, stick to one brand when following recipes. If switching brands, adjust slightly by taste, especially in dishes like air fryer meatballs or glazed ribs.</p>

<p>485 ml of coconut milk is approximately 2.05 cups. This conversion is essential for recipes, especially when using an air fryer, where precise measurements can make or break a dish. Whether you're whipping up a curry or baking a cake, knowing how to convert millilitres to cups ensures consistency. For more air fryer conversions, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of coconut milk can affect the texture and flavour of your dish. Too much liquid might make your air fryer recipe soggy, while too little could dry it out. Coconut milk is a staple in many cuisines, from Thai curries to vegan desserts, so getting the measurement right is crucial. If you're new to air fryer cooking, browse our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a> for inspiration.</p>  

<p>Different brands of coconut milk may vary slightly in consistency, but 485 ml will always be close to 2.05 cups. For baking, where precision is key, consider using a kitchen scale for even better accuracy. Many air fryer recipes, like our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert category</a>, rely on exact measurements for perfect results.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure Coconut Milk Correctly</h3>  
<p>To measure 485 ml of coconut milk, use a liquid measuring cup for the most accurate results. Stir the coconut milk well before measuring, as it can separate in the can. If you don’t have a measuring cup, remember that 485 ml is roughly 2.05 cups, or just over 2 cups. This measurement works for both UK and US cup sizes, making it versatile for any recipe.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for 485 ml of Coconut Milk</h2>  
<p>485 ml of coconut milk is a common amount in many recipes. It’s perfect for making creamy curries, soups, or even dairy-free ice cream in your air fryer. If you love experimenting, try our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipes</a>, where coconut milk adds richness and depth.</p>  

<p>You can also use 485 ml of coconut milk in baking, such as for moist cakes or fluffy pancakes. The natural sweetness and fat content of coconut milk make it a great substitute for dairy.

<h3>Converting Other Coconut Milk Amounts</h3>  
<p>If your recipe calls for a different amount of coconut milk, you can use the same conversion ratio. For example, 250 ml is about 1.06 cups, and 1 litre is roughly 4.23 cups. Keeping these conversions handy will save time and ensure your air fryer dishes turn out perfectly every time.</p>

<p>1 cup of pesto equals approximately 8 ounces, making it easy to measure for air fryer recipes. Whether you're whipping up a quick pasta dish or coating chicken for a crispy finish, knowing this conversion ensures accuracy. Pesto's thick consistency means it packs densely, so measuring by weight (ounces) can be more reliable than volume (cups) for consistent results. For more air fryer measurement tips, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>  

<h2>Why Measure Pesto in Ounces?</h2>  
<p>Measuring pesto in ounces rather than cups guarantees precision, especially when adapting recipes for your air fryer. Unlike liquids, pesto's texture varies—homemade versions might be chunkier, while store-bought ones are smoother. Weight measurements eliminate guesswork, ensuring your dishes turn out perfectly every time. If you're meal prepping, weighing pesto also helps portion control. Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> for creative ways to use pesto.</p>  

<p>Converting 1 cup of pesto to ounces is straightforward, but always consider the recipe's requirements. For example, air fryer dishes like pesto-coated veggies or chicken need even distribution for optimal crispiness. A kitchen scale simplifies this process, and our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion guide</a> offers additional help for other ingredients.</p>  

<h3>Homemade vs. Store-Bought Pesto</h3>  
<p>Homemade pesto often weighs slightly less per cup (around 7.5 ounces) due to looser textures, while store-bought versions typically hit the 8-ounce mark. If precision matters, like in air fryer baking, opt for weight measurements. For inspiration, browse our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable recipes</a> featuring pesto.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for Pesto in Air Fryers</h2>  
<p>Pesto adds vibrant flavor to air fryer dishes, from crispy potatoes to juicy salmon. Since 1 cup of pesto equals 8 ounces, you can easily adjust quantities for marinades or dips. Try tossing pesto with shrimp or tofu before air frying for a herby kick. Need cleaning tips after cooking?

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on precise cooking times and ingredient quantities to deliver crispy, evenly cooked meals. Using the correct amount of greek yogurt, like 0.66 cup (5.28 ounces), ensures your marinades, dips, or baked goods have the right consistency.

<p>Greek yogurt is a versatile ingredient in air fryer recipes, from creamy sauces to protein-packed snacks. Measuring 0.66 cup accurately means your dishes will have the perfect balance of moisture and flavour. Whether you're making a marinade for chicken or a healthy dessert, precision is key. Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipes</a> for inspiration.</p>  

<h3>How to measure 0.66 cup of greek yogurt</h3>  
<p>To measure 0.66 cup of greek yogurt, use a liquid measuring cup for the most accurate results. Fill it to just below the 2/3 cup mark, as greek yogurt is thick and can be tricky to level. Alternatively, weigh it on a kitchen scale for 5.28 ounces. This method is especially useful for baking, where precision is crucial.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for 0.66 cup of greek yogurt in air fryer recipes</h2>  
<p>Greek yogurt adds creaminess and protein to many air fryer dishes. Use 0.66 cup (5.28 ounces) in marinades for chicken or lamb, or mix it with herbs for a tasty dip. It’s also great in healthier desserts, like air-fried yogurt bites. For more ideas, browse our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert recipes</a>.</p>  

<p>Another popular use is in breakfast recipes, such as air-fryer pancakes or muffins. The 0.66 cup measurement ensures your batter isn’t too thick or thin. Greek yogurt can even replace sour cream in many recipes for a lighter option. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/breakfast>breakfast category</a> for more inspiration.</p>  

<h3>Tips for storing and using greek yogurt</h3>  
<p>Store your greek yogurt in the fridge and use it within a week of opening for the best quality. If your recipe calls for 0.66 cup (5.28 ounces), measure it just before use to maintain freshness. Leftovers can be used in smoothies or as a topping for air-fried potatoes.</p>

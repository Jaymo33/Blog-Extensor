<p>1.5 cups of lentils equals approximately 300 grams, making it easy to measure for air fryer recipes. Whether you're preparing a hearty lentil stew or crispy air-fried lentil bites, precise measurements ensure consistent results. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we know how crucial accurate conversions are for perfect cooking.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Lentil Measurements Matter</h2>
<p>Getting the right amount of lentils ensures your dishes turn out as intended. Too few lentils, and your meal might lack substance; too many, and textures can become uneven. For air fryer recipes, especially those involving lentil patties or falafel, 1.5 cups of lentils (300g) is a common starting point. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for other handy measurements.</p>
<p>Lentils expand when cooked, so measuring them correctly avoids overfilling your air fryer basket. Whether you're using red, green, or brown lentils, 1.5 cups will yield roughly 300 grams. This measurement works for both UK and US cup sizes, though slight variations may occur based on lentil type.</p>

<h2>Converting 1.5 Cups of Lentils to Grams</h2>
<p>Converting cups to grams is straightforward once you know the standard weight. One cup of uncooked lentils typically weighs around 200 grams, so 1.5 cups equal 300 grams. This conversion is essential for recipes like air-fried lentil koftas or spiced lentil snacks, where precision affects texture.</p>
<p>If you're using split lentils, the weight might differ slightly due to density. For example, 1.5 cups of split red lentils could weigh closer to 285 grams. Always refer to your recipe or our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>lentil recipe collection</a> for tailored guidance.</p>

<h3>Types of Lentils and Their Weights</h3>
<p>Different lentil varieties have slight weight variations per cup. Brown and green lentils are denser, so 1.5 cups will reliably weigh 300 grams. Split lentils, like red or yellow, may weigh less due to their smaller size. For air fryer cooking, stick to the 300-gram benchmark unless your recipe specifies otherwise.</p>

<h2>Using 1.5 Cups of Lentils in Air Fryer Recipes</h2>
<p>Air fryers excel at cooking lentils into crispy, flavourful dishes. With 1.5 cups (300g) of lentils, you can make lentil burgers, falafel, or even crunchy lentil snacks.

<p>Pre-soaking lentils can reduce cooking time and improve texture. For air frying, combine 1.5 cups of lentils with spices and binders like flaxseed or breadcrumbs. Shape the mixture into patties or balls, then air fry at 180°C for 12–15 minutes until golden.</p>

<h3>Tips for Perfect Lentil Measurements</h3>
<p>Use a kitchen scale for the most accurate 1.5-cup-to-grams conversion. If you don’t have one, fluff the lentils before measuring to avoid compacting them. For consistent results, level off the measuring cup with a straight edge.

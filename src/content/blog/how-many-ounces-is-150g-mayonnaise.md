<p>150g of mayonnaise is approximately 5.29 ounces. This conversion is essential for precise cooking, especially when using an air fryer where measurements can impact texture and consistency. Whether you're preparing a creamy dip or a rich sauce, knowing the exact weight ensures your dish turns out perfectly.</p>

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on precise ingredient ratios to achieve the best results. Too much or too little mayonnaise can affect the moisture and crispiness of your dish. For example, a <a href="https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes">mayonnaise-based coating</a> for chicken needs the right balance to crisp up properly. Accurate conversions like 150g to ounces help maintain consistency across recipes.</p>  

<p>Many air fryer recipes, especially those involving sauces or dressings, require exact measurements. If you're adapting a recipe from grams to ounces, this conversion ensures you don’t over or under-measure. Check out our <a href="https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart">air fryer conversion chart</a> for more handy tips.</p>  

<h3>How to measure 150g of mayonnaise without scales</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a kitchen scale, you can use measuring spoons or cups to approximate 150g of mayonnaise. One tablespoon of mayonnaise weighs roughly 15g, so 10 tablespoons would equal 150g. For ounces, this translates to just over 5 ounces, making it easy to measure for recipes like <a href="https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken">air fryer chicken dishes</a>.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for 150g of mayonnaise in air fryer recipes</h2>  
<p>Mayonnaise is a versatile ingredient in air fryer cooking. From crispy coatings to creamy dips, 150g (or 5.29 ounces) is a common quantity for many recipes. For instance, a <a href="https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/potatoes">potato salad</a> might call for this amount to bind ingredients together while keeping them moist during cooking.</p>  

<p>Another popular use is as a base for marinades. Mixing 150g of mayonnaise with herbs and spices creates a rich coating for meats or vegetables. The air fryer’s high heat ensures the mayo crisps up without burning, giving your dish a delicious golden finish.</p>  

<h3>Converting other mayonnaise quantities</h3>  
<p>If your recipe calls for a different amount of mayonnaise, the same conversion principle applies. For example, 100g of mayonnaise is roughly 3.53 ounces, while 200g equals about 7.05 ounces. Keeping these conversions handy simplifies cooking, especially when experimenting with new dishes in your air fryer.</p>  

<h2>Tips for storing and using mayonnaise in air fryer recipes</h2>  
<p>Mayonnaise can spoil if not stored correctly, so always check the expiry date before use. Once opened, keep it refrigerated and use it within a month. For air fryer recipes, room-temperature mayonnaise blends more easily with other ingredients, ensuring even distribution.</p>  

<p>Cleaning your air fryer after using mayonnaise-based recipes is crucial. Residue can build up and affect performance. Use a dedicated <a href="https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner">air fryer cleaner</a> to maintain your appliance and keep it in top condition for future cooking adventures.</p>

<p>225 grams of icing sugar is roughly equivalent to 1.8 cups in the UK and 1.75 cups in the US. Getting this measurement right is crucial for baking, especially when using an air fryer for desserts like cakes or cookies. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we know precision matters, so let’s break down the conversion in detail.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Baking</h2>  
<p>Baking is a science, and even small measurement discrepancies can affect texture and taste. Icing sugar, also known as powdered sugar, is often used in frostings, glazes, and light batters. Whether you're making <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>air fryer cakes</a> or dusting desserts, knowing how many cups 225 grams of icing sugar equals ensures consistency. Too much sugar can make frostings overly sweet, while too little may leave them runny.</p>  

<p>Different countries use varying cup sizes, which adds another layer of complexity. The UK and US measure cups differently, so it’s essential to clarify which standard you're using. For example, 225 grams of icing sugar in UK cups is slightly more than in US cups due to volume differences. Always check your recipe’s origin to avoid mistakes.</p>  

<h3>UK vs. US Cup Measurements for Icing Sugar</h3>  
<p>In the UK, 1 cup of icing sugar typically weighs 125 grams, meaning 225 grams equals about 1.8 cups. In the US, 1 cup is around 128 grams, so 225 grams is roughly 1.75 cups. This small difference might not seem significant, but for delicate recipes, precision counts.

<h2>How to Measure Icing Sugar Correctly</h2>  
<p>For the most accurate results, use a kitchen scale to weigh 225 grams of icing sugar directly. If you don’t have one, spoon the sugar into a measuring cup and level it off with a knife—never pack it down. Packed icing sugar can lead to over-measuring, throwing off your recipe. This method works whether you're baking traditional oven treats or experimenting with <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>air fryer desserts</a>.</p>  

<p>If your recipe calls for sifted icing sugar, measure after sifting to avoid clumps. Sifting ensures a lighter texture, which is especially important for airy frostings or delicate sponges.

<p>885 ml of oat milk is approximately 3.74 cups in the UK or 3.75 cups in the US. This conversion is essential for recipes, especially when using an air fryer for baking or cooking. Precise measurements ensure your dishes turn out perfectly every time.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter</h2>
<p>Using the right amount of oat milk can make or break a recipe. Too much or too little can affect texture, moisture, and even cooking times. Whether you're making a creamy sauce or a fluffy cake in your air fryer, accuracy is key. For more air fryer tips, check out <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>our conversion chart</a>.</p>

<p>Oat milk is a popular dairy-free alternative, but its density can vary slightly between brands. This means measuring by volume (like cups) rather than weight ensures consistency. If you're experimenting with new recipes, precise measurements help replicate success. Visit <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>our recipes section</a> for inspiration.</p>

<h2>UK vs. US Cup Measurements</h2>
<p>In the UK, a standard cup measures 250 ml, while in the US, it's 240 ml. This small difference can add up in larger quantities like 885 ml of oat milk. For UK bakers, 885 ml equals roughly 3.74 cups. In the US, it's closer to 3.75 cups.</p>

<h3>Converting for Air Fryer Recipes</h3>
<p>Many air fryer recipes call for precise liquid measurements. If a recipe lists oat milk in cups but you've measured in ml, this conversion is handy. For example, a vegan cake might require 885 ml of oat milk, which is just under 4 cups. Always double-check your measurements for best results.</p>

<h2>Common Uses for 885 ml of Oat Milk</h2>
<p>This quantity is perfect for batch cooking or larger recipes. You might use it for a big batch of pancakes, a creamy soup, or a dairy-free custard. The air fryer excels at these dishes, and accurate measurements ensure even cooking.

<p>Oat milk's neutral flavor makes it versatile in both sweet and savory dishes. From smoothies to sauces, 885 ml gives you enough for multiple servings. If you're meal prepping, this amount can streamline your cooking process. For cleaning tips, see <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>our guide</a>.</p>

<h3>Tips for Measuring Oat Milk</h3>

If your recipe calls for 885 ml, you can measure it directly or use the cup conversion for convenience.

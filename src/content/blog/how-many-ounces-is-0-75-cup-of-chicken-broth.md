<p>0.75 cup of chicken broth equals 6 fluid ounces (fl oz) in the UK. This measurement is essential for precise cooking, especially when using an air fryer where accurate liquid quantities can affect texture and flavour. Whether you’re preparing soups, stews, or marinades, knowing this conversion ensures your dish turns out perfectly every time.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Using the correct amount of chicken broth is crucial for air fryer recipes, as liquids help maintain moisture and prevent drying. Too much broth can make food soggy, while too little may lead to uneven cooking. For example, when making a chicken dish in the air fryer, 0.75 cup of chicken broth (6 fl oz) is often ideal for basting or creating a sauce. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more handy measurement tips.</p>  

<p>Precision is key when adapting traditional recipes for the air fryer. Many recipes call for chicken broth in cups, but ounces are easier to measure with a kitchen scale. If you’re meal prepping or batch cooking, converting 0.75 cup of chicken broth to ounces ensures consistency across multiple servings. Visit our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipes section</a> for inspiration on using chicken broth in your air fryer.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure 0.75 Cup of Chicken Broth Without a Scale</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a kitchen scale, you can still measure 0.75 cup of chicken broth accurately. Use a liquid measuring cup and fill it to the three-quarter mark. Alternatively, 6 fluid ounces is equivalent to 12 tablespoons or 177 millilitres. This method works well for recipes like air fryer soups or braised dishes where broth is a key ingredient.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for 0.75 Cup of Chicken Broth in Air Fryer Recipes</h2>  
<p>Chicken broth adds depth and richness to many air fryer dishes. A 0.75 cup portion (6 fl oz) is perfect for marinating chicken, deglazing the air fryer basket, or creating a light sauce. Try it in our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipes</a> for extra flavour and moisture. The broth helps keep meats tender and infuses them with savoury notes.</p>  

<p>Another great use for 0.75 cup of chicken broth is in vegetable dishes. Tossing veggies like potatoes or mushrooms in a small amount of broth before air frying enhances their taste without adding excess oil. For cleaning tips after cooking with broth, see our guide on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer maintenance</a>.</p>  

<h3>Converting Other Chicken Broth Measurements</h3>  
<p>If your recipe calls for a different amount of chicken broth, here are some quick conversions: 1 cup equals 8 fl oz, 0.5 cup equals 4 fl oz, and 0.25 cup equals 2 fl oz. These conversions are handy when scaling recipes up or down for your air fryer. Always measure liquids at eye level for accuracy.</p>  

<h2>Tips for Storing Leftover Chicken Broth</h2>  
<p>After measuring out 0.75 cup of chicken broth (6 fl oz), you might have leftovers. Store unused broth in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 4 days or freeze it for longer shelf life. Frozen broth can be portioned into ice cube trays for easy future use in air fryer recipes.</p>

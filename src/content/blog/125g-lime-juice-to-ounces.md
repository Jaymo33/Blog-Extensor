<p>125g of lime juice equals approximately 4.41 ounces. Whether you're prepping a zesty marinade or a tangy glaze for your air fryer dishes, getting the measurements right is key. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we know how important precision is for perfect results. Let’s dive into the details so you can nail every recipe.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate lime juice measurements matter</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of lime juice can make or break a dish. Too little, and your marinade lacks punch; too much, and it overpowers other flavours. For air fryer recipes, balance is everything. Lime juice adds acidity, brightness, and depth, especially in dishes like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>air fryer chicken</a> or <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/shrimp>shrimp recipes</a>. Converting 125g lime juice to ounces ensures consistency, whether you're cooking for one or meal prepping.</p>  

<p>Many UK cooks prefer grams, but some recipes use ounces. Knowing that 125g lime juice is roughly 4.41 oz helps avoid guesswork. This conversion is handy for international recipes or when using older cookbooks. Plus, it’s useful for scaling recipes up or down without losing flavour balance.</p>  

<h2>How to measure 125g of lime juice</h2>  
<p>If your kitchen scale measures grams, simply weigh the juice directly. No scale? Use a liquid measuring cup with fluid ounce markings. Since lime juice is roughly the same density as water, 125g equals about 125ml, which converts to 4.41 oz. For smaller quantities, a tablespoon holds roughly 0.5 oz (15ml), so 125g would be around 8-9 tablespoons.</p>  

<h3>Tools for precise conversions</h3>  
<p>A digital kitchen scale is the most accurate way to measure 125g lime juice in ounces. Look for one with both metric and imperial units. Alternatively, refer to our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for quick reference. Measuring spoons or jugs with dual markings (ml and oz) are also helpful for smaller quantities.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for 125g lime juice in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Lime juice is a staple in marinades, dressings, and glazes. For example, 125g (4.41 oz) of lime juice is perfect for a citrusy <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/fish>fish dish</a> or a vibrant veggie toss. It’s also great for balancing rich flavours in <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>desserts</a> like key lime pie bites. With precise measurements, your air fryer creations will turn out perfectly every time.</p>  

<p>Need to adjust a recipe? If it calls for 125g lime juice but you only have ounces, now you know it’s 4.41 oz. This conversion works for fresh or bottled juice, though fresh lime juice often has a brighter flavour. Store unused juice in the fridge or freeze it in ice cube trays for later use.</p>  

<h3>Tips for working with lime juice</h3>  
<p>Fresh lime juice tastes best, but bottled works in a pinch. Roll limes on the counter before juicing to maximise yield. Strain seeds and pulp for smoother results. If substituting bottled juice, check for additives—some brands include preservatives that alter flavour.

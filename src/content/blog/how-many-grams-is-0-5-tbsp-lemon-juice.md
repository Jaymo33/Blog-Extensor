<p>0.5 tbsp of lemon juice weighs approximately 7.5 grams. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precision matters. Whether you're marinating chicken or adding zest to desserts, knowing the exact weight ensures consistent results. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we focus on accurate measurements to help you cook with confidence.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on even heat distribution, so ingredient quantities must be precise. Too much or too little lemon juice can alter the texture and flavour of your dish. For example, a marinade with 0.5 tbsp of lemon juice (7.5g) ensures balanced acidity without overpowering. Check our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for other common measurements.</p>  

<p>Many recipes, like air-fried salmon or lemon-drizzled vegetables, call for small amounts of lemon juice. Knowing that 0.5 tbsp equals 7.5 grams helps avoid guesswork. This precision is especially useful for baking in air fryers, where exact ratios affect rise and texture.</p>  

<h3>How to measure 0.5 tbsp of lemon juice accurately</h3>  
<p>Use a metric measuring spoon or a digital kitchen scale for the best results. If you don’t have a scale, fill a tablespoon halfway for 0.5 tbsp. Freshly squeezed lemon juice may vary slightly in density, but 7.5 grams is a reliable average. For more tips, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a>.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for 0.5 tbsp of lemon juice in air fryer recipes</h2>  
<p>This small quantity is perfect for brightening dishes without overwhelming them. Try it in marinades for chicken or tofu, or drizzle it over air-fried vegetables. A 0.5 tbsp (7.5g) splash can also enhance dressings or glazes for fish, like in our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/salmon>salmon recipes</a>.</p>  

<p>Lemon juice also helps tenderise meats and balance rich flavours. For example, 0.5 tbsp in a spice rub adds subtle acidity to lamb or beef. If you’re cooking frozen foods, a light lemon drizzle can revive their freshness after air frying.</p>  

<h3>Converting other lemon juice measurements to grams</h3>  
<p>Need larger or smaller amounts? Here’s a quick guide: 1 tbsp of lemon juice equals 15 grams, while 1 tsp is about 5 grams. These conversions are handy for scaling recipes up or down. Visit <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> for more measurement tips and tricks.</p>  

<h2>Tips for working with lemon juice in air fryers</h2>  
<p>To prevent sticking, mix lemon juice with oil before applying it to food. For even distribution, use a spray bottle for misting. After cooking, clean your air fryer basket with our recommended <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner</a> to remove any citrus residue.</p>  

<p>Store leftover lemon juice in an airtight container in the fridge for up to a week. Fresh juice works best, but bottled lemon juice can substitute in a pinch—just check for added sugars or preservatives.

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>

<p>Golden syrup’s viscosity makes it tricky to measure, so using a digital scale is ideal. If you don’t have one, a tablespoon holds roughly 25g (0.88 oz), meaning 20g is just under a full spoon. For sticky ingredients like this, lightly greasing your measuring spoon helps it slide off easily. Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipes</a> for inspiration on using golden syrup in air fryer desserts and savoury dishes.</p>  

<h3>How to measure 20g of golden syrup without scales</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a scale, use the spoon method: 1 tablespoon ≈ 25g, so 20g is about 4/5 of a tablespoon. For smaller amounts, a teaspoon holds roughly 7g (0.25 oz), so 20g would be just under 3 teaspoons. Remember, these are approximations—investing in a scale guarantees precision.

<p>20g of golden syrup equals approximately 0.71 ounces. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements can make or break your dish. Whether you're baking sticky buns or glazing meats, knowing how to convert grams to ounces ensures accuracy. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we help simplify these conversions so you can focus on cooking. Golden syrup, a staple in British baking, requires careful measuring due to its thick consistency.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on precise ingredient ratios to achieve even cooking and perfect textures. Too much golden syrup can make dishes overly sticky, while too little might leave them dry. Converting 20g of golden syrup to ounces (0.71 oz) ensures your recipes turn out just right. For more conversions, check our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>. Whether you're making cakes or glazes, accuracy is key to air fryer success.</p>  

<p>Golden syrup’s viscosity makes it tricky to measure, so using a digital scale is ideal. If you don’t have one, a tablespoon holds roughly 25g (0.88 oz), meaning 20g is just under a full spoon. For sticky ingredients like this, lightly greasing your measuring spoon helps it slide off easily. Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipes</a> for inspiration on using golden syrup in air fryer desserts and savoury dishes.</p>  

<h3>How to measure 20g of golden syrup without scales</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a scale, use the spoon method: 1 tablespoon ≈ 25g, so 20g is about 4/5 of a tablespoon. For smaller amounts, a teaspoon holds roughly 7g (0.25 oz), so 20g would be just under 3 teaspoons. Remember, these are approximations—investing in a scale guarantees precision. For more tips, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning guide</a> ensures sticky messes won’t ruin your air fryer.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for golden syrup in air fryer recipes</h2>  
<p>Golden syrup adds sweetness and shine to air fryer dishes like flapjacks, glazed ham, or sticky toffee pudding. Converting 20g to ounces (0.71 oz) helps when adapting traditional recipes for air frying. Its high sugar content caramelises beautifully under the air fryer’s heat. Visit our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert category</a> for golden syrup-based treats. From drizzle cakes to glazed nuts, this ingredient is a game-changer.</p>  

<p>For savoury dishes, golden syrup balances salty flavours in marinades or BBQ sauces. Measuring 20g (0.71 oz) accurately ensures the right sweetness level. Pair it with soy sauce or mustard for a quick glaze on air-fried chicken or salmon. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipes</a> for ideas. Golden syrup’s versatility makes it a must-have for air fryer enthusiasts.</p>  

<h3>Storing and handling golden syrup for air fryer cooking</h3>  
<p>Store golden syrup in a cool, dry place to prevent crystallisation. If it hardens, warm the jar in hot water before measuring 20g (0.71 oz). Always wipe the rim after use to keep the bottle clean. For sticky spills, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning guide</a> has solutions. Proper storage ensures your syrup stays ready for impromptu air fryer baking sessions.</p>

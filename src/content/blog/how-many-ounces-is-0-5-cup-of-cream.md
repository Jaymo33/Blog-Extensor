<p>0.5 cup of cream equals approximately 4 ounces. This conversion is essential for precise cooking, especially when using an air fryer where measurements can impact texture and consistency. Whether you're making a creamy sauce or a decadent dessert, knowing how many ounces are in 0.5 cup of cream ensures your dish turns out perfectly.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on precise measurements to achieve the best results. Too much or too little cream can affect the texture of your dish, making it either too dry or overly rich. For example, a <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>creamy pasta bake</a> requires the right balance of ingredients to crisp up nicely in the air fryer. Measuring 0.5 cup of cream correctly ensures your recipes turn out as intended.</p>  
<p>Many air fryer recipes, like those found on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, list ingredients by weight for accuracy. Converting 0.5 cup of cream to ounces (4 oz) helps you follow these recipes without guesswork. This is particularly useful for baking, where precision is key to achieving the perfect rise and texture.</p>  

<h2>How to Measure 0.5 Cup of Cream Correctly</h2>  
<p>To measure 0.5 cup of cream accurately, use a liquid measuring cup for the best results. Fill it to the halfway mark, ensuring the cream sits level for an exact measurement. If you're using a kitchen scale, 0.5 cup of cream will weigh around 4 ounces, making it easy to double-check your measurements.</p>  
<p>For those who prefer metric measurements, 0.5 cup of cream is roughly 120 millilitres. This conversion is handy if you're following a recipe from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>our conversion chart</a>. Whether you're making a <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>decadent dessert</a> or a creamy soup, precise measurements ensure consistent results every time.</p>  

<h3>Common Uses for 0.5 Cup of Cream in Air Fryer Recipes</h3>  
<p>0.5 cup of cream is a versatile measurement used in many air fryer dishes. From creamy mashed potatoes to rich custards, this amount adds just the right level of richness. For example, a <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>vanilla cake</a> might call for 0.5 cup of cream to keep it moist and fluffy during air frying.</p>  

<h3>Tips for Storing Leftover Cream</h3>  
<p>If you have leftover cream after measuring out 0.5 cup, store it in an airtight container in the fridge. It will stay fresh for up to a week, ready for your next air fryer creation. For longer storage, consider freezing cream in ice cube trays for easy portioning later.</p>

<p id="">You can make delicious KFC-style chicken in your air fryer that's crispy on the outside and juicy inside with just 15 minutes of cooking time. This method uses 80% less oil than traditional deep-frying while delivering that signature Kentucky fried chicken air fryer magic we all crave.</p><h2 id="">The Secret to Air Fryer KFC Chicken</h2><p id="">The key to replicating that distinctive KFC flavour lies in the seasoning blend. While the exact recipe is famously secret, our version combines paprika, garlic powder, onion powder, and a touch of cayenne for that authentic kick. The air fryer's rapid hot air circulation creates an incredibly crisp coating without submerging the chicken in oil. For more air fryer conversion tips, check out our handy <a href="https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart" id="">air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p><p id="">When preparing your air fryer KFC chicken, always pat the pieces dry first to help the coating stick better. Brushing with a light coating of oil (just 1-2 teaspoons) will enhance browning. Arrange the chicken in a single layer with space between pieces - overcrowding leads to steaming rather than crisping. Flip halfway through cooking for even results.</p><h3 id="">Choosing the Right Chicken Cuts</h3><p id="">For authentic Kentucky fried chicken air fryer results, use a mix of drumsticks, thighs, and wings. Bone-in, skin-on pieces work best as they stay juicier during the high heat cooking. Breast meat can dry out quicker, so if using, consider brining first or cooking at a slightly lower temperature. Find more chicken inspiration in our <a href="https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken" id="">chicken recipe category</a>.</p><h2 id="">Step-by-Step Air Fryer KFC Chicken Recipe</h2><p id="">Start by mixing 1 cup flour with 1 tbsp each of paprika, garlic powder, onion powder, 1 tsp salt, 1/2 tsp black pepper, and 1/4 tsp cayenne in a large bowl. In another bowl, whisk 1 egg with 1/2 cup buttermilk. Dip each chicken piece in the flour mixture, then the egg wash, then back in the flour for a double coating that ensures extra crispiness.</p><p id="">Preheat your air fryer to 190°C for 3 minutes. Lightly spray the basket with oil and arrange the coated chicken pieces without touching. Cook for 12-15 minutes, flipping halfway, until the internal temperature reaches 75°C. The result? Perfectly crispy air fryer KFC chicken that's golden brown and packed with flavour. Serve with classic sides from our <a href="https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes" id="">recipes collection</a>.</p><h3 id="">Tips for Extra Crispy Results</h3><p id="">For an even crispier coating, let the breaded chicken rest for 10 minutes before cooking to allow the coating to set. Some cooks swear by adding a tablespoon of cornstarch to the flour mixture for extra crunch. If your air fryer tends to dry out food, spritzing the chicken lightly with oil halfway through cooking can help maintain moisture while keeping that signature crispness.</p><h2 id="">Healthier Than Takeaway KFC</h2><p id="">Traditional KFC chicken can contain up to 20g of fat per portion, while our air fryer version typically has just 5-7g. The air fryer's efficient cooking method means you get all the texture and flavour with significantly less oil. It's also lower in calories - a win for anyone watching their intake but craving that Kentucky fried chicken air fryer experience.</p><p id="">Cleanup is easier too - no vats of used oil to dispose of. Just wipe down your air fryer basket with our recommended <a href="https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner" id="">air fryer cleaner</a> and you're done. The reduced oil also means no lingering fried food smells in your kitchen - just the delicious aroma of perfectly seasoned chicken.</p><h3 id="">Serving Suggestions</h3><p id="">Complete your air fryer KFC chicken feast with classic sides like creamy coleslaw, buttery corn on the cob, and fluffy mashed potatoes. For a lighter option, try a fresh green salad or roasted vegetables. The beauty of making this at home is you can customize the meal to your preferences while still enjoying that familiar KFC taste.</p><h2 id="">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><p id="">Can I use frozen chicken? Yes, but thaw completely first and pat very dry to prevent a soggy coating. How long does it keep? Enjoy immediately for best texture, though leftovers will stay crisp in the fridge for 2 days (reheat in the air fryer for 3-4 minutes). Can I make it gluten-free? Absolutely - just substitute the flour with your favourite GF blend.</p><p id="">For more inspiration on creating takeaway favourites at home, explore all our <a href="https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk" id="">airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> guides. From crispy wings to healthier burgers, your air fryer can recreate all your fast food cravings with better ingredients and less guilt.

<p>85 ml of water equals approximately 0.36 cups in the UK and 0.35 cups in the US. Whether you're prepping ingredients for your air fryer or baking, knowing this conversion ensures your recipes turn out just right. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we understand the importance of precise measurements, especially when adapting recipes for your air fryer.</p>  

<h2>Understanding the Conversion</h2>  
<p>Converting millilitres to cups can be tricky because cup sizes vary between the UK and the US. In the UK, 1 cup is roughly 284 ml, while in the US, it's about 240 ml. This means 85 ml of water is slightly less than half a cup in both systems. For air fryer recipes, where precision matters, using a measuring jug or digital scale can help avoid guesswork.</p>  

<p>If you're working with a recipe from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>our recipe collection</a>, you might need to adjust measurements like 85 ml of water to fit your air fryer's capacity. Always double-check conversions to ensure your dishes cook evenly and taste perfect.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Using the correct amount of liquid, like 85 ml of water, can make or break a recipe. Too much water can lead to soggy results, while too little might dry out your food. This is especially important in air fryers, where circulating hot air cooks food quickly and efficiently. A slight mismeasurement can throw off cooking times and textures.</p>  

<p>For example, if you're making a batter or marinade, 85 ml of water needs to be precise to maintain the right consistency. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for other common measurement conversions to streamline your cooking process.</p>  

<h3>Tools for Measuring 85 ml of Water</h3>  
<p>A liquid measuring cup with millilitre markings is the easiest way to measure 85 ml of water accurately. If you don't have one, a standard UK tablespoon holds about 15 ml, so roughly 5.5 tablespoons would equal 85 ml. For US measurements, a tablespoon is 14.8 ml, so you'd need around 5.75 tablespoons.</p>  

<h3>Common Uses for 85 ml of Water</h3>  
<p>You might need 85 ml of water for small-batch recipes, such as single-serving cakes or sauces. It's also useful for rehydrating ingredients like dried mushrooms or grains before air frying. For more inspiration, browse our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert recipes</a>, where precise liquid measurements are key.</p>  

<h2>Adjusting Recipes for Your Air Fryer</h2>  
<p>When converting traditional recipes for your air fryer, measurements like 85 ml of water may need slight tweaks. Air fryers cook faster, so reducing liquids slightly can prevent sogginess. Always start with less liquid and add more if needed, especially when trying new recipes from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>.</p>  

<p>For cleaning your air fryer after cooking, a mix of 85 ml of water and vinegar can work wonders. Check our guide on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaning</a> for more tips on maintaining your appliance.</p>

<p>110 ml of soy sauce is roughly 0.46 cups (just under half a cup). This conversion is handy when following air fryer recipes that list ingredients in millilitres but require cup measurements. Whether you're marinating chicken or seasoning tofu, knowing this conversion ensures your dish turns out perfectly.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Soy Sauce Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Getting the right amount of soy sauce is crucial for balancing flavours in your air fryer dishes. Too little, and your meal might lack depth; too much, and it could become overly salty. Many recipes on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> rely on precise measurements for the best results. Whether you're making crispy tofu or glazed salmon, 110 ml of soy sauce (or 0.46 cups) ensures consistency.</p>  

<p>For those who love Asian-inspired air fryer meals, soy sauce is a staple. From stir-fries to marinades, it adds umami richness. If a recipe calls for 110 ml of soy sauce, you now know it’s just under half a cup. This small but important detail can make all the difference in your cooking.</p>  

<h2>Converting 110 ml of Soy Sauce to Cups</h2>  
<p>Converting millilitres to cups isn’t always straightforward, especially with liquids like soy sauce. The general rule is that 240 ml equals 1 cup, so 110 ml works out to approximately 0.46 cups. If you don’t have a measuring cup handy, you can use a tablespoon—about 15 ml per tablespoon—meaning 110 ml is roughly 7.3 tablespoons.</p>  

<h3>Measuring Without a Cup</h3>  
<p>If you’re in a pinch, a standard UK mug holds around 250 ml, so filling it just under halfway will give you close to 110 ml.

<h2>Using 110 ml of Soy Sauce in Air Fryer Recipes</h2>  
<p>Soy sauce is a versatile ingredient in air fryer cooking. A 110 ml quantity (0.46 cups) is often used in marinades for proteins like chicken, beef, or tofu. For example, a teriyaki glaze might combine 110 ml of soy sauce with honey, garlic, and ginger for a delicious coating.</p>

<h3>Adjusting for Different Soy Sauce Types</h3>  
<p>Not all soy sauces are created equal—light soy sauce is saltier, while dark soy sauce is richer and less salty. If a recipe specifies 110 ml of light soy sauce, you might need to adjust slightly if using dark soy sauce. Always taste as you go to avoid over-seasoning your air fryer creations.</p>  

<h2>Common Mistakes When Measuring Soy Sauce</h2>  
<p>One of the biggest mistakes is eyeballing liquid measurements, which can lead to overly salty or bland dishes. Always use a measuring jug or spoons for accuracy. Another error is confusing millilitres with grams—soy sauce’s volume (ml) isn’t the same as its weight (g).</p>

<h3>Storing Leftover Soy Sauce</h3>  
<p>If you’ve measured out 110 ml of soy sauce but only used part of it, store the rest in an airtight container in the fridge. Soy sauce keeps for months, so you can use it later for another air fryer recipe. This prevents waste and keeps your ingredients fresh for future meals.</p>

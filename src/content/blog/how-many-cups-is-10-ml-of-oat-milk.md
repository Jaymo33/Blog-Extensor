<p>10 ml of oat milk equals approximately 0.042 cups (or roughly 1/24 of a cup). This small measurement is often used in air fryer recipes, especially for sauces, batters, or dressings where precision matters. Whether you're whipping up a quick breakfast or a decadent dessert, knowing this conversion ensures your dish turns out just right.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on even heat distribution, so ingredient ratios can make or break a recipe. Too much or too little liquid, like oat milk, can affect texture and cooking time. For example, adding 10 ml of oat milk to a cake batter instead of the intended 0.042 cups might seem minor, but it could lead to a denser result. Always measure carefully for consistent outcomes.</p>

<h3>How to Measure 10 ml of Oat Milk Without a Measuring Cup</h3>  
<p>Don’t have a measuring cup handy? Use a teaspoon—10 ml is roughly 2 teaspoons. For larger batches, a kitchen scale set to grams (10 ml of oat milk weighs about 10.3 grams) can be more accurate.

<h2>Common Uses for 10 ml of Oat Milk in Air Fryer Recipes</h2>

<h3>Converting 10 ml of Oat Milk for UK vs. US Cups</h3>  
<p>Note that UK cups (284 ml) differ slightly from US cups (240 ml). For 10 ml, the difference is negligible (0.042 UK cups vs. 0.042 US cups), but it’s worth double-checking for larger quantities. Always refer to your air fryer’s manual or our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion guide</a> for clarity.</p>  

<h2>Tips for Working with Small Liquid Measurements</h2>  
<p>Use a syringe or dropper for precision when measuring 10 ml of oat milk. For sticky ingredients, lightly coat the measuring spoon with oil to ensure all the liquid slides out. Clean your air fryer basket promptly after using dairy alternatives—our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning guide</a> makes it hassle-free.</p>

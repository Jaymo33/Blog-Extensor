<p>150 grams of butter is roughly 2/3 cup (0.66 cups) in both UK and US measurements. Whether you're baking a cake or preparing a savoury dish in your air fryer, getting the butter measurement right ensures perfect results every time. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we know precise conversions make all the difference in cooking.</p>

<h2>Understanding Butter Measurements</h2>  
<p>Butter can be tricky to measure, especially when switching between grams and cups. For 150 grams of butter, the conversion is straightforward: it’s just under 3/4 cup. This applies to both unsalted and salted butter, as density remains consistent. If you’re using an air fryer for recipes like cookies or cakes, accuracy ensures even cooking. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for other common ingredient swaps.</p>  

<p>In the UK, butter is often sold in 250g blocks, making it easy to measure 150g by eye. Simply divide the block into roughly three equal parts, then take two. For air fryer recipes, softened butter blends better with other ingredients, so measure after bringing it to room temperature. Need inspiration? Browse our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>cake recipes</a> designed for air fryers.</p>  

<h3>Why 150 Grams of Butter Matters in Air Frying</h3>  
<p>Using 150 grams of butter correctly can elevate your air fryer dishes. Too much butter may cause smoking, while too little can dry out baked goods. For crispy coatings or moist cakes, stick to the 2/3 cup measurement. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a> includes tips for adjusting butter quantities based on dish types.</p>  

<h2>Converting 150g Butter to Cups: Step by Step</h2>  
<p>To convert 150 grams of butter to cups, use a kitchen scale for precision. If you don’t have one, spoon softened butter into a measuring cup, ensuring no air pockets. Level it off with a knife for accuracy. For air fryer recipes like shortbread or pastry, this method prevents uneven textures. Prefer visual guides? Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning tips</a> ensure your tools stay accurate.</p>  

<p>Note that 150 grams of butter in cups may vary slightly by brand due to moisture content. For air frying, stick to trusted brands with consistent density. If adapting a traditional recipe for the air fryer, reducing butter by 10% can prevent excess grease. Try this with our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cookies>cookie recipes</a> for best results.</p>  

<h3>Common Mistakes When Measuring Butter</h3>  
<p>Packing butter into a cup compresses it, leading to over-measurement. Instead, gently fill the cup and level it. For air fryer recipes, melted butter should be measured after melting, not before. This avoids discrepancies in volume. Always use standardised cups, not mugs or teacups, for reliable conversions.</p>

<h3>Measuring Without a Cup</h3>
<p>If you don’t have a measuring cup handy, you can use a kitchen scale. Evaporated milk weighs roughly 250 grams per cup, so 235 ml would be about 245 grams. This method is just as accurate and can be a lifesaver when you're in a pinch.</p>

<h2>Common Uses for Evaporated Milk</h2>
<p>Evaporated milk is a versatile ingredient used in both sweet and savoury dishes. It’s often found in desserts like custards, pies, and fudge, as well as in creamy pasta sauces or soups. Its rich, concentrated flavour adds depth to any recipe.</p>

<h3>Storing Evaporated Milk</h3>
<p>Once opened, evaporated milk should be stored in the fridge and used within a few days. If you’re not planning to use it all at once, consider freezing it in ice cube trays for easy portioning later. This way, you’ll always have the right amount on hand for your next culinary adventure.</p>

<h2>Tips for Baking with Evaporated Milk</h2>
<p>When baking with evaporated milk, it’s important to account for its reduced water content. This means you may need to adjust other liquid ingredients in your recipe slightly. Always follow the recipe closely, especially when using an air fryer, as cooking times and temperatures can vary.</p>

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>

<p>Many air fryer recipes call for small quantities of sauces like bbq, especially when cooking for one or two people. Converting 0.25 tablespoon of bbq sauce to grams ensures you don’t overdo it.

<h3>How to measure 0.25 tbsp of bbq sauce without scales</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a kitchen scale, you can use a measuring spoon. A standard UK tablespoon holds 15ml, so 0.25 tbsp is roughly one-quarter of that. For bbq sauce, this translates to just under 4 grams. Remember, thicker sauces like bbq may vary slightly in weight, so adjust as needed.

<h3>Does bbq sauce brand affect the weight?</h3>  
<p>Yes, thicker or sweeter bbq sauces may weigh slightly more per 0.25 tbsp due to higher sugar content. However, the difference is minimal—usually within 0.5 grams. For most recipes, 3.75 grams is a reliable benchmark. Always taste and adjust if using a particularly dense or runny sauce.</p>

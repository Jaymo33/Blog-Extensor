<h2>Why Accurate Milk Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Accurate measurements are crucial in cooking, especially when using an air fryer. Too much or too little milk can affect texture, moisture, and even cooking times. For example, a slight variation in milk quantity can make cakes too dense or sauces too runny. By converting 1.0 cups of milk to grams, you eliminate guesswork and achieve consistent results. Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more handy tips.</p>  

<p>Different recipes may call for milk in grams rather than cups, especially those from international sources. Knowing that 1.0 cups of milk equals 240 grams simplifies the process. This is particularly useful for air fryer recipes, where precision ensures even cooking. Whether you're making a <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert</a> or a savoury dish, accurate measurements are key.</p>  

<h3>US vs UK Cup Measurements</h3>  
<p>It’s worth noting that cup measurements can vary between the US and UK. In the US, 1.0 cups of milk is standardised at 240 grams, while UK cups may differ slightly.

<h2>Converting Milk for Air Fryer Recipes</h2>  
<p>Air fryers excel at delivering crispy, evenly cooked meals, but they rely on precise ingredient ratios. Converting 1.0 cups of milk to grams ensures your batters and mixtures are perfect.

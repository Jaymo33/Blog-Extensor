<p>200 grams of honey is roughly equivalent to 0.63 cups in the UK and 0.85 cups in the US. This conversion is essential for baking, cooking, or air fryer recipes where precision matters. Honey’s thickness and density mean it doesn’t measure the same as liquids like water, so using weight (grams) is often more accurate. If you’re following a recipe from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, knowing this conversion ensures your dishes turn out perfectly every time.</p>

<h2>Why Measuring Honey Accurately Matters</h2>  
<p>Honey is a staple in many recipes, from glazes to desserts, and its sticky nature makes measuring tricky. Too much or too little can throw off the balance of your dish, especially in air fryer cooking where ingredients need to be precise. For example, a honey-glazed salmon or a batch of air fryer cookies relies on the right sweetness and texture. Using a kitchen scale for grams is ideal, but if you only have cups, this conversion is your best bet.</p>  

<p>Different types of honey, like raw or processed, can vary slightly in density, but 200 grams generally falls within the 0.63–0.85 cup range.

<h2>UK vs. US Cup Measurements for Honey</h2>  
<p>In the UK, a standard cup holds 250ml, while in the US, it’s 240ml. This small difference affects how honey is measured. For 200 grams of honey, UK cooks will need about 0.63 cups, whereas US cooks will use roughly 0.85 cups. If you’re adapting a recipe from one system to another, this distinction is crucial.</p>  

<p>Air fryer recipes often list ingredients in grams for consistency, but if you’re working with a cup-based recipe, keep this conversion handy.

<h3>How to Measure Honey Without a Scale</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a scale, use the spoon-and-level method for cups. Lightly grease the cup or spoon with oil to help the honey slide out easily. Fill the cup gradually, levelling off the top with a knife. Remember, 200 grams of honey is roughly 10–12 tablespoons, depending on the honey’s thickness.</p>  

<h3>Common Recipes Using 200 Grams of Honey</h3>  
<p>Honey is versatile in air fryer cooking. Try it in marinades for chicken, glazes for roasted vegetables, or even in desserts like air fryer baklava.

<h2>Tips for Working with Honey in Air Fryers</h2>

For sticky glazes, brush them on in the last few minutes of cooking. Cleaning your air fryer after using honey?

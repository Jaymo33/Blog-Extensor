<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of ingredients ensures your air fryer dishes turn out perfectly. Double cream, with its high fat content, can affect texture and flavour if not measured correctly. A slight variation might make your sauce too thick or your dessert overly rich. That’s why converting 5g of double cream to ounces (0.18 oz) is so useful.

<p>Air fryers cook food quickly, so precision is key to avoiding under or overcooking. Whether you're making a creamy pasta sauce or a decadent cake, accurate measurements save time and ingredients. Double cream is a staple in many <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipes</a>, from savoury to sweet. Knowing how to convert grams to ounces helps you follow both UK and international recipes with ease. It’s all about getting the best results from your air fryer.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure 5g of Double Cream Without Scales</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a kitchen scale, you can still measure 5g of double cream accurately. One teaspoon of double cream is roughly 5g, which equals 0.18 ounces. This method works well for small quantities, especially when adding cream to sauces or batters. For larger amounts, a measuring spoon set or a liquid measuring cup can help. Just remember that double cream is denser than milk, so volume measurements aren’t always exact.</p>  

<h2>Using Double Cream in Air Fryer Recipes</h2>  
<p>Double cream adds richness and moisture to air fryer dishes, from creamy pasta bakes to indulgent desserts. When converting 5g to ounces (0.18 oz), you’ll find it’s often used in small quantities for glazes or toppings. For example, a dollop of whipped double cream on an air-fried scone is heavenly. Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert recipes</a> for inspiration on using double cream in sweet treats.</p>  

<p>Double cream also works wonders in savoury dishes, like creamy garlic mushrooms or rich carbonara. Since air fryers circulate hot air, creamy sauces thicken quickly without curdling. Just remember to measure carefully—5g (0.18 oz) can make a big difference in consistency.

<h3>Common Mistakes When Measuring Double Cream</h3>  
<p>One mistake is confusing double cream with whipping cream or single cream, which have different fat contents. Double cream is about 48% fat, so 5g (0.18 oz) packs more richness than other creams. Another error is eyeballing measurements, which can lead to overly heavy or light dishes. Always use proper tools for accuracy, especially in air fryer cooking where precision matters. A small digital scale is a worthwhile investment for any kitchen.</p>  

<h2>Converting Other Cream Measurements</h2>  
<p>If you need to convert larger amounts, remember that 100g of double cream equals about 3.5 ounces. This is useful for recipes requiring bigger quantities, like custards or ice creams. For smaller amounts, like 5g (0.18 oz), a teaspoon is your best friend. Whether you’re making a <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>cake</a> or a sauce, accurate conversions ensure consistent results. Bookmark our conversion chart for quick reference.</p>  

<p>Different creams have different weights, so always check the type you’re using. Clotted cream, for example, is denser than double cream, so 5g would be slightly less in volume. When in doubt, weigh your ingredients for the best outcome. Air fryer cooking thrives on precision, and knowing your conversions makes all the difference.

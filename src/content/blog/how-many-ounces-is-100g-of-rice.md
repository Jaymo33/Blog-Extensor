<h2>Why converting 100g of rice to ounces matters</h2>  
<p>Accurate measurements are crucial when cooking rice in an air fryer. Too much or too little rice can affect texture and cooking time. Converting 100g of rice to ounces (3.53 oz) helps you follow recipes precisely, especially those from international sources.

<p>Rice is a staple in many air fryer dishes, from crispy rice cakes to stuffed peppers. If you’re exploring our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipes</a>, you’ll notice measurements in grams for consistency. However, having a quick conversion like 100g rice to ounces handy ensures you never get stuck mid-recipe.</p>  

<h3>How to measure 100g of rice without scales</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a digital scale, you can estimate 100g of rice using household items. A standard UK metric cup holds roughly 200g of uncooked rice, so half a cup is close to 100g. For ounces, 3.53 oz is just under half a US cup (which is 8 oz). Keep in mind that rice types vary in density—basmati is lighter than sticky rice, so adjustments may be needed.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for 100g of rice in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>100g of rice is a versatile portion for air fryer meals. It’s perfect for single servings of fried rice, stuffed vegetables, or as a side dish. When cooked, 100g of dry rice yields about 300g of fluffy rice, ideal for meal prep.

<h3>Does rice type affect the weight conversion?</h3>  
<p>While 100g of any rice equals 3.53 ounces, the volume may differ. Long-grain rice like basmati is fluffier, so 100g fills more space than short-grain sushi rice. For accuracy, always weigh rice rather than relying on volume measures. This is especially important for air fryer recipes, where overcrowding can lead to uneven cooking.</p>  

<h2>Tips for cooking 100g of rice in your air fryer</h2>

The result? Light, separate grains perfect for stir-fries or salads.

<p>100 grams of rice equals approximately 3.53 ounces. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes, where precise measurements can make all the difference. Whether you're cooking jasmine, basmati, or long-grain rice, knowing how to convert grams to ounces ensures consistent results. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we help simplify cooking conversions so you can focus on creating delicious meals.</p>  

<h2>Why converting 100g of rice to ounces matters</h2>  
<p>Accurate measurements are crucial when cooking rice in an air fryer. Too much or too little rice can affect texture and cooking time. Converting 100g of rice to ounces (3.53 oz) helps you follow recipes precisely, especially those from international sources. Many UK cooks prefer using grams, but some older recipes or American guides may list ingredients in ounces.</p>  

<p>Rice is a staple in many air fryer dishes, from crispy rice cakes to stuffed peppers. If you’re exploring our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipes</a>, you’ll notice measurements in grams for consistency. However, having a quick conversion like 100g rice to ounces handy ensures you never get stuck mid-recipe.</p>  

<h3>How to measure 100g of rice without scales</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a digital scale, you can estimate 100g of rice using household items. A standard UK metric cup holds roughly 200g of uncooked rice, so half a cup is close to 100g. For ounces, 3.53 oz is just under half a US cup (which is 8 oz). Keep in mind that rice types vary in density—basmati is lighter than sticky rice, so adjustments may be needed.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for 100g of rice in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>100g of rice is a versatile portion for air fryer meals. It’s perfect for single servings of fried rice, stuffed vegetables, or as a side dish. When cooked, 100g of dry rice yields about 300g of fluffy rice, ideal for meal prep. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/meal-prep>meal prep recipes</a> for creative ways to use pre-cooked rice.</p>  

<p>For crispy rice dishes, like air-fried arancini or rice patties, 100g of cooked rice works beautifully. The air fryer’s rapid circulation ensures even browning without excess oil. If you’re new to air frying rice, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a> simplifies switching between grams, ounces, and cups.</p>  

<h3>Does rice type affect the weight conversion?</h3>  
<p>While 100g of any rice equals 3.53 ounces, the volume may differ. Long-grain rice like basmati is fluffier, so 100g fills more space than short-grain sushi rice. For accuracy, always weigh rice rather than relying on volume measures. This is especially important for air fryer recipes, where overcrowding can lead to uneven cooking.</p>  

<h2>Tips for cooking 100g of rice in your air fryer</h2>  
<p>Cooking rice in an air fryer is quicker than traditional methods. For 100g of rice, use a heatproof dish or foil tray with 200ml of water. Cook at 180°C for 12-15 minutes, stirring halfway. The result? Light, separate grains perfect for stir-fries or salads. For more inspiration, browse our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable rice dishes</a>.</p>  

<p>After cooking, always clean your air fryer basket to prevent residue buildup. A quick wipe with our recommended <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner</a> keeps it in top condition. Remember, 100g of rice (3.53 oz) is just the beginning—experiment with herbs, spices, and mix-ins to elevate simple rice into a standout dish.</p>

<p>2 cups of chopped spinach equals approximately 2.5 ounces (70 grams). This measurement is key for air fryer recipes where precision ensures even cooking and perfect texture. Whether you're making spinach-stuffed chicken or crispy veggie bites, knowing the weight helps avoid over or under-seasoning.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate spinach measurements matter</h2>  
<p>Getting the right amount of chopped spinach ensures your air fryer dishes cook evenly. Too much spinach can make recipes soggy, while too little might leave them dry. For dishes like spinach and feta parcels or air-fried spanakopita, 2 cups (2.5 oz) is often the sweet spot. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more handy measurement swaps.</p>  

<p>Fresh spinach reduces significantly when cooked—2 cups raw becomes about ½ cup cooked. This shrinkage affects air fryer timing. Recipes at <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> account for this, like our 5-minute wilted spinach side dish that starts with precisely measured raw leaves.</p>  

<h3>Measuring chopped spinach correctly</h3>  
<p>For accurate 2-cup measurements, loosely pack spinach leaves into a dry measuring cup without crushing them. Pressed-down spinach can weigh 3+ ounces—nearly 20% more than the standard 2.5 oz. This difference matters in air fryer recipes where excess moisture affects crispiness.</p>  

<h2>Spinach conversions for UK cooks</h2>  
<p>UK fluid ounces differ slightly from US weights, but for chopped spinach, 2 cups consistently equals 2.5 oz (70g) regardless of location. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a> includes UK-friendly versions of classics like spinach and ricotta rolls with clear ounce measurements.</p>  

<p>When substituting frozen spinach, use ¼ cup thawed and drained per 2 cups fresh. Frozen packs often list weights—look for 70g equivalents. For more frozen veg tips, visit our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/frozen-foods>frozen foods section</a>.</p>  

<h3>Best air fryer spinach recipes</h3>  
<p>Try our crispy spinach and artichoke dip—it uses exactly 2 cups (2.5 oz) chopped spinach for perfect chip-to-dip ratio. The air fryer gives it a golden crust without drying out the greens. Discover this and other <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable-forward recipes</a> that make the most of your 2-cup measurement.</p>  

<h2>Storing measured spinach</h2>  
<p>Pre-chopped 2-cup portions stay fresh 3-5 days in airtight containers with a dry paper towel. For longer storage, blanch and freeze in 2.5 oz batches—ideal for quick air fryer meals. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning guide</a> shows how to remove spinach residues post-cooking.</p>  

<p>Remember: 2 cups chopped spinach (2.5 oz) works for most air fryer baskets. Overcrowding prevents proper air circulation—measure carefully for evenly cooked greens every time.</p>

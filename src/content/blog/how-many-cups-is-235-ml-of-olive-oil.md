<p>235 ml of olive oil is approximately 1 cup. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements can make or break your dish. Whether you're baking, frying, or roasting, knowing how to convert millilitres to cups ensures consistency in your cooking. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we help you nail these measurements every time.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of olive oil in your air fryer ensures even cooking and perfect texture. Too much oil can make food greasy, while too little may leave it dry. For example, when making crispy potatoes or chicken wings, 235 ml of olive oil (or 1 cup) is often the ideal amount. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more handy tips.</p>  

<p>Many air fryer recipes, especially those for baked goods or marinades, rely on precise oil measurements. If you're preparing a dish like air-fried vegetables or tofu, 235 ml of olive oil provides just enough moisture without overpowering the flavours. For more recipe ideas, visit our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipes section</a>.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure 235 ml of Olive Oil Without a Measuring Cup</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a measuring cup, you can use a standard metric measuring jug to measure 235 ml of olive oil. Alternatively, 235 ml is roughly the same as 16 tablespoons, which can be easier to measure with a spoon. Just remember that 1 tablespoon equals about 15 ml, so 16 tablespoons will give you close to 235 ml.</p>  

<h2>Converting 235 ml of Olive Oil for Different Recipes</h2>  
<p>Whether you're following a UK or US recipe, knowing that 235 ml of olive oil equals 1 cup simplifies things. In the UK, recipes often use millilitres, while US recipes prefer cups. This conversion is particularly useful for air fryer cooking, where precision is key. For more air fryer measurement tips, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable recipes</a>.</p>  

<p>If you're scaling a recipe up or down, remember that 235 ml of olive oil is also equivalent to half a pint or 0.99 cups (technically just under 1 cup). This small difference usually won’t affect most dishes, but for baking, it’s best to measure exactly. Need cleaning tips for your air fryer after cooking? Try our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner guide</a>.</p>  

<h3>Common Mistakes When Measuring Olive Oil</h3>  
<p>One mistake people make is pouring olive oil directly into the air fryer basket without measuring. This can lead to uneven cooking or excess oil pooling at the bottom. Always measure 235 ml of olive oil (or the required amount) before adding it to your dish. Another tip is to use a spray bottle for even distribution.</p>  

<h2>Using 235 ml of Olive Oil in Popular Air Fryer Dishes</h2>  
<p>Many air fryer favourites, like crispy chicken or roasted vegetables, call for around 235 ml of olive oil. This amount is perfect for coating ingredients evenly without making them soggy. For example, tossing sweet potato fries in 235 ml of olive oil before air frying ensures they come out golden and crisp.</p>  

<p>If you're making marinades or dressings, 235 ml of olive oil provides a balanced base. Pair it with herbs and spices for delicious results. For more inspiration, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipes</a>, where precise oil measurements are key.</p>  

<h3>Storing Leftover Olive Oil After Measuring</h3>  
<p>If you’ve measured out 235 ml of olive oil but don’t use it all, store the leftover oil in an airtight container. Keep it in a cool, dark place to maintain freshness. Reusing olive oil in the air fryer isn’t recommended, as it can break down and affect flavour.</p>

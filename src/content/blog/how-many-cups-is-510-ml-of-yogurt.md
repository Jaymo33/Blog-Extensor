<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter</h2>
<p>When cooking or baking, especially in an air fryer, precise measurements are crucial. Too much or too little yogurt can affect texture, moisture, and even cooking times. For example, a <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>yogurt-based marinade</a> for chicken needs the right balance to avoid being too runny or thick.

<h2>How to Measure 510 ml of Yogurt in Cups</h2>
<p>To measure 510 ml of yogurt in cups, use a standard measuring cup. One cup equals 237 ml, so 510 ml divided by 237 ml gives you roughly 2.15 cups. For baking, it’s often easier to round to 2 cups plus 1 tablespoon, as most recipes tolerate small adjustments. If precision is key, a kitchen scale is your best friend—weighing 510 grams of yogurt is more accurate than volume measurements.</p>

<h3>US vs UK Cup Measurements</h3>
<p>It’s worth noting that US and UK cup sizes differ slightly. A US cup is 237 ml, while a UK cup is 284 ml. For 510 ml of yogurt, this means 2.15 US cups or 1.8 UK cups. Always check which measurement system your recipe uses to avoid confusion. Most air fryer recipes on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> specify measurements clearly, so you’ll never go wrong.</p>

Whether you’re whipping up crispy chips or a moist cake, knowing how many ml is 1.5 cups of vegetable oil ensures consistency. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we specialise in making cooking conversions effortless, so you can focus on creating delicious meals.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Using the correct amount of oil is crucial in air fryer recipes. Too little oil, and your food may turn out dry; too much, and it can become greasy. Converting 1.5 cups of vegetable oil to ml (355 ml) helps you achieve the perfect balance. Many air fryer recipes, like those in our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipes section</a>, rely on precise oil measurements for optimal texture and flavour.</p>  

<p>Vegetable oil is a common ingredient in air frying because of its high smoke point and neutral taste. Whether you’re making crispy chicken or roasted vegetables, knowing how much oil to use ensures even cooking. For more tips on air fryer conversions, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure 1.5 Cups of Vegetable Oil Accurately</h3>  
<p>To measure 1.5 cups of vegetable oil in ml, use a liquid measuring cup with millilitre markings. Pour the oil slowly to avoid spills and check the measurement at eye level. If you don’t have a measuring cup, a kitchen scale can also help—1.5 cups of vegetable oil weighs roughly 340 grams, which is close to 355 ml.</p>  

<h2>Differences Between UK and US Cup Measurements</h2>  
<p>It’s worth noting that UK and US cup measurements can vary slightly. In the UK, 1 cup is typically 250 ml, while in the US, it’s 240 ml. For 1.5 cups of vegetable oil, this means 375 ml in the UK and 360 ml in the US. However, most air fryer recipes, including those on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, use the standard 240 ml US cup, making 1.5 cups equal to 355 ml.</p>  

<p>If you’re following a British recipe, double-check the cup measurements to avoid discrepancies. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/potatoes>potato recipes</a>, for example, often specify whether they use UK or US measurements to ensure accuracy.</p>

For instance, crispy chicken wings or battered fish fillets may require this amount for optimal crispiness. If you’re preparing a large batch, like our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipes</a>, precise oil measurements ensure even cooking and flavour distribution.</p>  

<h2>Tips for Reducing Oil in Air Fryer Recipes</h2>  
<p>While 1.5 cups of vegetable oil (355 ml) is a standard measurement, you can often reduce the amount for healthier cooking. Air fryers require less oil than traditional frying methods—sometimes just a light spray will do. Experiment with reducing the oil by half and see if the texture still meets your expectations.</p>

<p>1.5 cups of condensed milk equals 355 ml, making it easy to measure for your air fryer recipes. Whether you're whipping up a dessert or adding richness to a dish, this conversion ensures precision. Condensed milk is a staple in many recipes, and knowing the exact ml measurement helps avoid guesswork. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we focus on making cooking conversions simple and accurate. This guide will help you measure 1.5 cups of condensed milk in ml effortlessly.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter</h2>
<p>Using the correct amount of condensed milk can make or break your recipe. Too little, and your dessert might lack sweetness or creaminess; too much, and it could become overly dense. Air fryer recipes, in particular, rely on precise measurements for consistent results. Converting 1.5 cups of condensed milk to ml ensures you’re following the recipe exactly. For more conversion tips, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>

<p>Condensed milk is thicker than regular milk, so measuring it by volume (cups) or weight (ml) requires attention. A slight variation can affect the texture and taste of your dish. Whether you're making fudge, caramel, or a creamy filling, 355 ml of condensed milk is the perfect amount for 1.5 cups. Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a> for ideas on how to use this measurement.</p>

<h2>How to Measure 1.5 Cups of Condensed Milk in ml</h2>
<p>To measure 1.5 cups of condensed milk in ml, you’ll need a liquid measuring cup or a kitchen scale. Pour the condensed milk into the cup until it reaches the 1.5-cup mark, which translates to 355 ml. If using a scale, 1.5 cups of condensed milk weighs approximately 510 grams, but ml is the preferred measurement for liquids. This method ensures accuracy, especially for air fryer recipes where consistency is key.</p>

<h3>Using a Measuring Jug</h3>
<p>A clear measuring jug with ml markings is the easiest way to measure 1.5 cups of condensed milk. Simply pour the milk into the jug until it hits the 355 ml line. If your jug only has cup measurements, fill it to the 1.5-cup mark and note that this equals 355 ml.

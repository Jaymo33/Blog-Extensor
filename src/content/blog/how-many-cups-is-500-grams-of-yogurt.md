Whether you're making a creamy dip or a fluffy cake, knowing how to convert grams to cups ensures consistent results every time.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Yogurt Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Using the correct amount of yogurt can make or break a recipe. Too much yogurt can make baked goods dense, while too little might leave them dry. For air fryer recipes, precise measurements ensure even cooking and perfect texture. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we emphasise the importance of accurate conversions for foolproof dishes.</p>  

<p>Yogurt is a versatile ingredient in both sweet and savoury dishes. From marinades to desserts, knowing how many cups 500 grams of yogurt equals helps streamline your cooking process.

<h2>UK vs. US Cup Measurements</h2>  
<p>It's important to note that UK and US cup sizes differ slightly. A UK cup holds 284 ml, while a US cup is 240 ml. This means 500 grams of yogurt equals about 1.75 UK cups or 2.1 US cups. Always check which measurement system your recipe uses to avoid mistakes.</p>  

<p>Many air fryer recipes, especially those on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>our recipe page</a>, provide measurements in both grams and cups for convenience. If you're adapting a traditional oven recipe for the air fryer, converting grams to cups ensures the right consistency.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure Yogurt Correctly</h3>  
<p>For the most accurate measurement, use a kitchen scale to weigh 500 grams of yogurt. If you don't have one, spoon the yogurt into a measuring cup and level it off with a knife. Avoid packing it down, as this can lead to over-measuring. Strained yogurt (like Greek yogurt) may require slight adjustments due to its thicker consistency.</p>

<h3>Storing Leftover Yogurt</h3>

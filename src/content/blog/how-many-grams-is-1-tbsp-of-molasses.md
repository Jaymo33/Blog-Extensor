<p>1 tablespoon (tbsp) of molasses weighs approximately 20 grams in the UK. This measurement is essential for air fryer recipes where precision matters, especially in baking or glazing dishes. Whether you’re making sticky gingerbread or a rich marinade, knowing the exact weight ensures consistent results. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we recommend using a digital scale for sticky ingredients like molasses to avoid messy spills and inaccuracies.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on even heat distribution, so precise ingredient quantities are crucial for perfect results. Too much molasses can make dishes overly sticky or burn, while too little might leave them lacking flavour. For recipes like air-fried flapjacks or glazed meats, 1 tbsp molasses to grams conversion ensures balance. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for other common ingredient weights.</p>  

<p>Molasses adds depth to both sweet and savoury dishes, from cakes to barbecue sauces. Its thick consistency means volume measurements (like tablespoons) can vary, making weight more reliable. If you’re adapting a traditional recipe for the air fryer, converting 1 tbsp of molasses into grams guarantees accuracy. Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a> for molasses-based ideas tailored to air fryers.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure Molasses Without a Scale</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a scale, lightly grease your tablespoon before scooping molasses to help it slide off easily. Fill the spoon evenly and level it with a knife for the closest approximation to 20 grams. For sticky ingredients, silicone measuring spoons are a game-changer—find them in our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/accessories>accessories guide</a>.</p>  

<h2>Molasses in Popular Air Fryer Recipes</h2>  
<p>Molasses shines in air-fried desserts like ginger cookies or sticky toffee pudding. Its rich, caramelised flavour also enhances savoury dishes, such as glazed ham or roasted vegetables. For 1 tbsp molasses in grams UK recipes, stick to the 20-gram benchmark to avoid overpowering other ingredients. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert category</a> features plenty of molasses-inspired treats optimised for air fryers.</p>  

<p>When substituting molasses with other sweeteners, adjust weights accordingly. For example, honey is lighter (about 21 grams per tbsp), while golden syrup is closer to 25 grams. Always cross-check conversions to maintain recipe integrity. Need cleaning tips after working with sticky molasses? Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner guide</a> has you covered.</p>  

<h3>UK vs. US Tablespoon Measurements</h3>  
<p>In the UK, 1 tbsp equals 15ml, the same as the US, but ingredient densities can vary. For molasses, the 20-gram standard applies to both, but always verify with a scale if precision is critical. This is especially important for baking, where small discrepancies can affect texture.</p>

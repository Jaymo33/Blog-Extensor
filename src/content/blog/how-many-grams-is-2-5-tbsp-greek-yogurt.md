<p>2.5 tablespoons (tbsp) of greek yogurt equals approximately 37.5 grams (g). This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements can make all the difference in texture and consistency. Whether you’re whipping up a marinade, baking a cake, or preparing a healthy dip, knowing the exact weight ensures perfect results every time.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on even heat distribution, and ingredient ratios play a crucial role in achieving the desired outcome. Too much or too little greek yogurt can affect moisture levels, browning, and overall taste. For example, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer cake recipes</a> often call for greek yogurt to keep them light and fluffy—getting the measurement right is key.</p>  

<p>If you’re converting other ingredients, check out our handy <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for quick reference. It covers everything from flour to liquids, making recipe adjustments a breeze.</p>  

<h3>How to measure 2.5 tbsp of greek yogurt accurately</h3>  
<p>For the most precise results, use a digital kitchen scale to weigh your greek yogurt. Scoop the yogurt into a tablespoon measure, level it off, and repeat until you’ve reached 2.5 tbsp. Alternatively, you can weigh it directly—37.5 grams is your target. This method is especially useful for sticky or dense ingredients like greek yogurt.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for greek yogurt in air fryer recipes</h2>  
<p>Greek yogurt is a versatile ingredient in air fryer cooking. It’s often used in marinades for chicken or lamb, adding tenderness and a subtle tang. Try it in our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>air fryer chicken recipes</a> for juicy, flavourful results. It also works wonders in baked goods, replacing heavier fats like butter or oil.</p>  

<p>For a healthier twist, greek yogurt can be swapped into dips or sauces. Pair it with herbs and spices for a creamy accompaniment to air-fried vegetables or seafood. Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable air fryer recipes</a> for inspiration.</p>  

<h3>Converting other yogurt quantities to grams</h3>  
<p>If your recipe calls for a different amount, here’s a quick reference: 1 tbsp of greek yogurt is roughly 15 grams, while 1 cup (16 tbsp) equals about 240 grams. Keep these conversions handy when scaling recipes up or down. For more tips, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning and maintenance guide</a> ensures your air fryer stays in top shape for precise cooking.</p>  

<h2>Tips for working with greek yogurt in air fryer dishes</h2>  
<p>Greek yogurt can thicken sauces or bind ingredients together, making it ideal for coatings or batters. When using it in marinades, let proteins sit for at least 30 minutes to absorb the flavours. For baking, ensure all ingredients are at room temperature to avoid curdling.</p>  

<p>If you’re experimenting with frozen yogurt drops or yogurt-based coatings, check our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert air fryer recipes</a> for creative ideas. The right measurements ensure your treats come out perfectly every time.</p>

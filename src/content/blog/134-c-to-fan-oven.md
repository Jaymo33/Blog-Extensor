<p>134 C converts to approximately 120 C in a fan oven. This 10-20 degree reduction is standard when converting conventional oven temperatures to fan-assisted settings. Whether you're baking, roasting, or using your air fryer, understanding this conversion ensures perfectly cooked dishes every time.</p>

<h2>Understanding Fan Oven Temperature Conversions</h2>
<p>Fan ovens circulate hot air using a built-in fan, cooking food more evenly and quickly than conventional ovens. When a recipe states 134 C, you'll typically need to reduce this by 10-20 degrees for fan oven cooking. This means setting your fan oven to around 120 C achieves similar results to 134 C in a conventional oven.</p>
<p>This conversion applies whether you're baking cakes at <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>134 C in fan oven for delicate sponges</a> or roasting vegetables. The circulating air prevents hot spots while reducing cooking time. Many modern air fryers operate on similar principles to fan ovens, making these conversions useful across appliances.</p>

<h2>How 134 C Translates to Air Fryer Cooking</h2>
<p>Air fryers essentially work as compact, powerful fan ovens. When converting 134 C to air fryer settings, you can use the same 120 C fan oven equivalent. However, since air fryers cook even faster, you may need to reduce cooking time by 20% compared to fan oven recipes.</p>
<p>For perfect <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> at this temperature, preheat your appliance for 3 minutes. Foods like roasted potatoes or chicken wings benefit from this moderate heat, achieving crisp exteriors without drying out. Always shake the basket halfway through for even cooking.</p>

<h3>Common Uses for 134 C in Fan Ovens</h3>
<p>120 C fan oven temperature (equivalent to 134 C conventional) is ideal for delicate bakes. This includes meringues, cheesecakes, and slow-roasted tomatoes. The gentle heat prevents burning while allowing thorough cooking. It's also perfect for dehydrating fruits or making jerky.</p>

<h2>Temperature Conversion Chart for Reference</h2>
<p>Bookmark this simple guide for converting between conventional, fan, and air fryer temperatures. For 134 C conventional oven, use 120 C in fan ovens. In air fryers, start with 120 C but reduce time by 15-20 minutes per hour of original cooking time.</p>
<p>Our comprehensive <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> covers all common temperature ranges. Remember that oven thermostats vary, so invest in an inexpensive oven thermometer to verify actual temperatures. This ensures your 134 C to fan oven conversions yield perfect results every time.</p>

<h3>Adjusting Cooking Times at 134 C Equivalent</h3>
<p>When using 120 C in a fan oven (134 C conventional equivalent), reduce cooking times by about 10%. Check food 5-10 minutes before the recipe suggests. For air fryers, the time reduction is more significant - typically 20-25% less than conventional oven times.</p>

<h2>Tips for Perfect Results at This Temperature</h2>
<p>At 120 C fan (134 C conventional), moisture retention is key. Cover dishes with foil for the first half of cooking when roasting meats. For baking, use light-colored pans to prevent over-browning. In air fryers, spritz foods lightly with oil for optimal crispness without drying out.</p>
<p>Regular <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaning</a> maintains consistent performance at all temperatures. Grease buildup can affect airflow and heating efficiency. For fan ovens, clean the fan blades periodically to ensure proper air circulation at your precise 134 C conversions.</p>

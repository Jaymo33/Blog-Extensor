<p>2 cups of rapeseed oil equals approximately 16 ounces (or 1 pound) in weight. This conversion is essential for air fryer cooking, where precise measurements can make all the difference in texture and flavour. Whether you’re frying, roasting, or baking, knowing how to convert cups to ounces ensures your recipes turn out perfectly every time.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of oil is crucial when cooking with an air fryer. Too much oil can lead to greasy results, while too little may leave your food dry. Rapeseed oil, with its high smoke point and neutral flavour, is a popular choice for air fryer recipes. By converting 2 cups of rapeseed oil to ounces, you can follow recipes more accurately, whether you’re making crispy chips or succulent chicken.</p>

<h3>How to measure rapeseed oil for air fryer recipes</h3>  
<p>When measuring rapeseed oil, it’s best to use a liquid measuring cup for accuracy. Fill it to the 2-cup mark, ensuring the oil sits level at eye view. If you don’t have measuring cups, a kitchen scale set to ounces will work just as well. Simply pour the oil until it reaches 16 ounces, and you’re ready to cook.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for rapeseed oil in air fryers</h2>

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Using the correct amount of almond butter ensures your recipes turn out perfectly every time. Too much can make baked goods oily, while too little might leave them dry. The air fryer’s rapid cooking method means small measurement errors can have big effects. For example, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>almond butter cookie recipe</a> relies on precise 30g portions for the ideal texture. Always measure ingredients like almond butter carefully for consistent results.</p>  

<p>Converting 30g of almond butter to ounces is straightforward with a digital scale. If you don’t have one, use a conversion chart like our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion guide</a>. Almond butter’s density means 30g fills roughly two tablespoons, but weighing is more accurate. This is especially important for air fryer baking, where even small deviations can affect cooking times and textures.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure 30g of Almond Butter Without a Scale</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a kitchen scale, use the spoon-and-level method for almond butter. Two level tablespoons of almond butter will be close to 30g or 1.06 ounces. For sticky nut butters, lightly grease your measuring spoon first to help it slide out cleanly. This trick works well for air fryer recipes like our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>almond butter brownies</a>, where precision matters.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for 30g of Almond Butter in Air Fryer Recipes</h2>  
<p>30g of almond butter is a versatile amount for many air fryer dishes. It’s perfect for single-serving energy balls, glazes for chicken or tofu, or as a base for healthy desserts. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/breakfast>almond butter breakfast bars</a> use exactly 30g per portion for balanced flavour and texture. The air fryer’s even heat distribution helps recipes with almond butter cook evenly without burning.</p>  

<p>For savoury dishes, 30g of almond butter can be thinned with water or oil to make a marinade. Try it with <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>air fryer chicken thighs</a> for a nutty, rich flavour.

<h3>Storing Almond Butter for Accurate Measuring</h3>  
<p>To make measuring 30g of almond butter easier, store it at room temperature for a spreadable consistency. Stir well before measuring to incorporate any separated oils.

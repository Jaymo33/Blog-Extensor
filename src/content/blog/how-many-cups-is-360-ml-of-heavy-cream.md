<p>360 ml of heavy cream is approximately 1.52 cups in US measurements or 1.27 cups in UK measurements. This conversion is essential for baking, cooking, and air fryer recipes where precision matters. Whether you're whipping up a creamy dessert or a savoury sauce, knowing how to measure heavy cream correctly ensures perfect results every time. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we understand the importance of accurate measurements for flawless dishes.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurement Matters</h2>  
<p>Using the correct amount of heavy cream can make or break a recipe. Too little, and your sauce might be too thin; too much, and your dessert could become overly rich. For air fryer recipes, precise measurements ensure even cooking and perfect textures. If you're following a recipe from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>our collection</a>, getting the conversion right is key to replicating the dish successfully.</p>  

<p>Heavy cream is a staple in many recipes, from creamy pasta sauces to decadent desserts. Whether you're using it in a traditional oven or an air fryer, knowing how to convert 360 ml of heavy cream to cups is invaluable. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more handy measurement tips.</p>  

<h3>US vs UK Cup Measurements</h3>  
<p>It's important to note that US and UK cup measurements differ slightly. In the US, 1 cup equals 240 ml, while in the UK, it's 284 ml. This means 360 ml of heavy cream converts to roughly 1.52 US cups or 1.27 UK cups. Always check which measurement system your recipe uses to avoid mistakes.</p>  

<h2>How to Measure Heavy Cream Without a Scale</h2>  
<p>If you don't have a kitchen scale, measuring 360 ml of heavy cream is still straightforward. Use a liquid measuring cup for the most accurate results. Pour the cream slowly to the 360 ml mark, ensuring it sits level for precision. For air fryer recipes, accuracy ensures your dish cooks evenly and tastes just right.</p>  

<p>Alternatively, you can use tablespoons as a rough guide. Since 1 tablespoon is about 15 ml, 360 ml of heavy cream equals roughly 24 tablespoons. This method is handy if you're in a pinch, but for best results, stick to a measuring cup. Explore more tips on our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert recipes page</a> for creamy treats.</p>  

<h3>Common Uses for 360 ml of Heavy Cream</h3>  
<p>360 ml of heavy cream is perfect for making rich sauces, whipped cream, or creamy soups. In air fryer cooking, it's often used for batters or to add moisture to baked goods. Whether you're making a classic carbonara or a luxurious chocolate mousse, this measurement pops up frequently.</p>

<p>510 ml of corn syrup is approximately 2.15 cups when measured accurately. Whether you're baking a sticky toffee pudding or glazing air-fried chicken, precise measurements ensure perfect results every time. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we know how crucial conversions are for air fryer recipes, so let’s break it down.</p>  

<h2>Understanding Corn Syrup Measurements</h2>  
<p>Corn syrup is a common ingredient in both baking and air frying, adding sweetness and moisture to dishes.

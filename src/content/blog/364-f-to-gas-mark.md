<p>364°F converts to Gas Mark 4.5, making it a moderate oven temperature perfect for baking and air frying. This conversion is essential for UK cooks using recipes with Fahrenheit measurements or when adapting air fryer recipes between different heating methods. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we specialise in helping you navigate these temperature conversions for flawless results every time.</p>

<h2>Understanding 364 F to Gas Mark Conversion</h2>
<p>The Gas Mark scale is uniquely British, with each increment representing a specific temperature range. Gas Mark 4.5 sits between Gas Mark 4 (350°F/180°C) and Gas Mark 5 (375°F/190°C), providing precise control for delicate bakes. When converting 364 fahrenheit to gas mark, it's helpful to know that each full Gas Mark equals about 25-30°F. This 364 degrees f to gas mark conversion is particularly useful for American recipes that need adapting for UK ovens or air fryers.</p>
<p>Many modern ovens now display both Fahrenheit and Gas Mark, but if yours doesn't, memorising key conversions like 364 f in gas mark can save time. For air fryer users, this temperature is ideal for items like scones, muffins or delicate pastries that benefit from moderate, even heat. Check our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more temperature equivalents.</p>

<h2>Using 364 F in Different Cooking Appliances</h2>
<p>When applying the 364 f to gas mark uk conversion to an air fryer, remember that air fryers cook faster than conventional ovens. You may need to reduce cooking time by 20% when using Gas Mark 4.5 (364°F) in an air fryer. This temperature works beautifully for recipes like our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>air fryer cakes</a> collection, where gentle heat prevents drying.</p>
<p>For conventional ovens, 364 degrees fahrenheit to gas mark 4.5 is a versatile setting. It's hot enough to cook thoroughly without excessive browning, making it perfect for: custards, cheesecakes, delicate biscuits and some breads. The slight precision of Gas Mark 4.5 (versus a full Gas Mark 4 or 5) can make all the difference in professional-quality results.</p>

<h3>Adjusting for Fan Ovens</h3>
<p>If you're using a fan-assisted oven with the 364 f fan oven to gas mark conversion, you'll typically reduce the temperature by 20°C. However, since Gas Marks don't have decimal points in most oven controls, you'd round Gas Mark 4.5 down to Gas Mark 4 for fan ovens. Always check your food 5-10 minutes early when making these adjustments.</p>

<h2>Why 364 F to Gas Mark Matters for Air Fryers</h2>
<p>The gas mark equivalent of 364 f is particularly relevant for air fryer users because many appliance manuals provide temperature settings in Gas Mark. Knowing that 364°F equals Gas Mark 4.5 helps when following recipes from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>our recipe collection</a> or converting traditional oven recipes. This temperature range prevents burning while ensuring thorough cooking.</p>
<p>Air fryers excel at 364 f to gas mark baking because their rapid air circulation mimics a convection oven's even heat distribution. Foods like scones, muffins and tea cakes benefit from this precise temperature control. Remember to lightly grease or use <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer liners</a> at this temperature to prevent sticking without affecting heat circulation.</p>

<h3>Common Foods Cooked at 364 F/Gas Mark 4.5</h3>
<p>This temperature range shines for delicate bakes that need gentle heat: Victoria sponge cakes, madeleines, shortbread biscuits and crème brûlée. It's also excellent for reheating pre-cooked foods in your air fryer without drying them out. The 364 fahrenheit gas mark level provides enough heat to crisp without burning.</p>

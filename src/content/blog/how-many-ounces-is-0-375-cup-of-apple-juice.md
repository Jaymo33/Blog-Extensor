<p>0.375 cup of apple juice equals 3 ounces (oz) in the UK measurement system. This conversion is essential for precise cooking, especially when using an air fryer where ingredient ratios can affect texture and flavour. Whether you’re making a glaze, marinade, or baking, knowing the exact weight ensures consistent results. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we focus on helping you get the most out of your air fryer with accurate measurements and delicious recipes.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on even heat distribution, so ingredient proportions can make or break a dish. Too much liquid, like apple juice, might lead to soggy results, while too little can dry out your food. Converting 0.375 cup of apple juice to ounces (3 oz) helps maintain balance. If you’re working with other liquids, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for quick reference. Precision is key, whether you’re making glazes for meats or baking desserts.</p>  

<p>Many air fryer recipes, like those in our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipes section</a>, call for small quantities of liquids. Apple juice adds sweetness and moisture, perfect for dishes like glazed chicken or apple-infused cakes. Measuring 0.375 cup (3 oz) ensures you don’t overpower the dish. If you’re experimenting, start with this amount and adjust to taste. Remember, air fryers cook faster than conventional ovens, so exact measurements prevent overcooking or uneven results.</p>  

<h3>How to measure 0.375 cup of apple juice without a scale</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a kitchen scale, use a liquid measuring cup marked in fractions. 0.375 cup is equal to 3/8 cup, or 6 tablespoons. For smaller quantities, a tablespoon measure works well—just ensure you level it off for accuracy. Alternatively, repurpose a shot glass (1.5 oz) twice to reach 3 oz. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we recommend investing in a digital scale for the most reliable results, especially when working with sticky liquids like apple juice.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for 0.375 cup of apple juice in air fryer recipes</h2>  
<p>Apple juice isn’t just for drinking—it’s a versatile ingredient in air fryer cooking. A 0.375 cup (3 oz) portion works beautifully in marinades for pork or chicken, adding subtle sweetness. Try it in our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipes</a> for a tenderising effect. You can also reduce it into a glaze by simmering with spices, then brushing onto meats during the last few minutes of air frying. The sugars caramelise, creating a glossy, flavourful finish.</p>  

<p>For desserts, 0.375 cup of apple juice moistens cakes and muffins without making them dense. Combine it with cinnamon and a touch of butter for a quick apple drizzle. If you’re making a fruit compote, this quantity balances tartness in berries or rhubarb. After cooking, don’t forget to clean your air fryer basket—sticky residues from apple juice can build up. Our guide on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner</a> makes maintenance a breeze.</p>  

<h3>Adjusting recipes when substituting apple juice</h3>  
<p>If a recipe calls for 0.375 cup of another liquid (like broth or water), substituting apple juice adds flavour but also sugar. Reduce added sweeteners elsewhere in the recipe to compensate. For savoury dishes, balance the sweetness with acidity—a splash of vinegar works wonders. In baking, remember that apple juice’s sugar content promotes browning, so you may need to slightly lower the temperature or shorten cooking time in your air fryer.</p>

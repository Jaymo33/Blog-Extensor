<p>10 ml of tomato sauce equals approximately 0.042 cups (or roughly 1/24 of a cup). This small measurement is often used in air fryer recipes for sauces, dressings, or marinades where precision matters. Whether you're preparing a quick pasta dish or a flavourful glaze, knowing this conversion ensures your meals turn out just right.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on even heat distribution, and using the right amount of sauce can prevent soggy or unevenly cooked food. Too much liquid can lead to steaming instead of crisping, while too little might leave your dish dry. For perfect results, always measure ingredients like tomato sauce carefully.

<p>Tomato sauce is a staple in many air fryer recipes, from meatball subs to stuffed peppers. If you're working with small quantities like 10 ml, a measuring spoon or syringe can help. For larger batches, scaling up is easy—just multiply the conversion accordingly.

<h3>How to Measure 10 ml of Tomato Sauce Without a Measuring Cup</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a measuring cup handy, you can use a standard teaspoon. Two level teaspoons (5 ml each) will give you 10 ml of tomato sauce. Alternatively, a tablespoon holds about 15 ml, so filling it two-thirds full will get you close to 10 ml. Precision matters, especially in air fryer cooking, where excess moisture can affect texture.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for 10 ml of Tomato Sauce in Air Fryer Recipes</h2>  
<p>Small amounts of tomato sauce, like 10 ml, are often used for basting, glazing, or adding a hint of flavour. For example, brushing 10 ml of sauce on air-fryer chicken wings adds a tangy kick without overpowering the dish. It’s also perfect for mini pizza bites or as a dipping sauce for crispy veggies.</p>  

<p>If you're meal prepping, 10 ml of tomato sauce can be portioned into small containers for individual servings. This ensures consistency across batches.

<h2>Tips for Working With Tomato Sauce in Your Air Fryer</h2>  
<p>Tomato sauce can caramelise quickly in an air fryer due to its sugar content. To prevent burning, apply it in thin layers or during the last few minutes of cooking. If using 10 ml as a glaze, brush it on lightly for even coverage. For dishes like meatballs or stuffed peppers, mix the sauce with breadcrumbs to help absorb excess moisture.</p>

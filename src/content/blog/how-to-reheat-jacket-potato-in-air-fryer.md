<p>To reheat a jacket potato in an air fryer, preheat to 180°C (350°F) and cook for 5–8 minutes until piping hot. This method restores crispiness while keeping the inside fluffy – far better than microwaving. Whether you’ve stored your spud in the fridge or have leftovers from last night, your air fryer is the ideal tool for revival.</p>

<h2>Why Use an Air Fryer to Reheat Jacket Potatoes?</h2>
<p>Air fryers circulate hot air rapidly, which means your reheated jacket potato regains its crispy skin without drying out. Unlike microwaves that steam potatoes, air fryers mimic the texture of oven-baked spuds. For those who love meal prep, this appliance is a game-changer – check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/potatoes>potato recipes</a> for more inspiration. The quick reheating time (just 5–8 minutes) makes it perfect for speedy lunches or sides. Plus, it’s energy-efficient compared to firing up a full oven.</p>

<p>If your jacket potato has toppings like cheese or beans, the air fryer melts them beautifully without making the base soggy. Our tests at <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> show that 180°C delivers the best balance of speed and texture. For frozen pre-cooked jacket potatoes, add 2–3 extra minutes – our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a> helps adjust cook times across models.</p>

<h2>Step-by-Step Reheating Instructions</h2>
<h3>For Fresh Leftovers (Room Temperature)</h3>
<p>Place the jacket potato directly in the air fryer basket. No oil is needed if the skin was originally crispy. Cook at 180°C for 5 minutes, then check if the centre reaches 75°C with a food thermometer. If reheating multiple potatoes, space them evenly and add 1–2 minutes.</p>

<h3>For Refrigerated Jacket Potatoes</h3>
<p>Cold potatoes straight from the fridge need slightly longer. Spritz the skin lightly with water or oil to prevent over-drying. Air fry at 180°C for 7–8 minutes, flipping halfway. The water trick works wonders – discover more kitchen hacks in our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a>.</p>

<h2>Optimal Temperature and Timing</h2>
<p>180°C (350°F) is the sweet spot for reheating jacket potatoes in an air fryer. Higher temperatures risk burning the skin before heating the centre thoroughly. At this setting, most standard-sized potatoes (200–300g) reheat perfectly in 5–8 minutes. For smaller jacket potatoes, reduce to 4–6 minutes.</p>

<p>If your air fryer has reheat presets, avoid using them – they’re typically designed for fried foods. Instead, manual temperature control yields better results. Always check that the internal temperature reaches at least 75°C for food safety. Different air fryer models vary slightly – consult our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning guide</a> to maintain optimal performance.</p>

<h2>Tips for Extra Crispy Results</h2>
<p>Brush the skin with a tiny amount of olive oil before reheating for maximum crispiness. Sprinkle with sea salt for enhanced flavour. If your potato was originally wrapped in foil, remove it completely – foil prevents the skin from crisping up. For stuffed jacket potatoes, cover toppings loosely with foil for the first 3 minutes to prevent burning.</p>

<p>Cutting the reheated potato open immediately releases steam that softens the skin. Let it rest for 1–2 minutes after cooking. For next-level texture, try the double-cook method: reheat for 4 minutes, let cool for 2 minutes, then air fry again for 3 minutes. This technique works brilliantly for <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/meal-prep>meal prep</a> potatoes.</p>

<p>175 grams of grated cheese is roughly equivalent to 1.75 cups. This measurement can vary slightly depending on how finely the cheese is grated and how tightly it's packed, but 1.75 cups is a reliable starting point for most recipes. Whether you're making a cheesy air fryer dish or prepping for baking, knowing this conversion ensures your dishes turn out perfectly every time.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Cheese Measurements Matter</h2>
<p>Getting the right amount of grated cheese is crucial for achieving the perfect texture and flavour in your dishes. Too much cheese can make your air fryer recipes overly greasy, while too little can leave them lacking in flavour. For example, if you're making air fryer nachos or a cheesy bake, 175 grams of grated cheese (or 1.75 cups) will give you the ideal balance. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more handy measurements.</p>

<p>Different types of cheese can also affect the volume. Hard cheeses like cheddar or parmesan will yield slightly more cups per gram compared to softer cheeses like mozzarella. This is because softer cheeses tend to pack more tightly. If you're using a mix of cheeses, it's best to measure by weight for accuracy. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipes section</a> has plenty of ideas for using grated cheese in your air fryer.</p>

<h3>How to Measure Grated Cheese Properly</h3>
<p>To measure 175 grams of grated cheese accurately, use a kitchen scale for the best results. If you don't have one, lightly spoon the grated cheese into a measuring cup without packing it down. This ensures you don't end up with more cheese than the recipe calls for. For air fryer dishes like crispy cheese bites or stuffed mushrooms, precise measurements make all the difference.</p>

<h2>Converting Grams to Cups for Different Cheeses</h2>
<p>While 175 grams of grated cheese generally equals 1.75 cups, this can vary depending on the cheese type. For hard cheeses like cheddar, 175 grams will be closer to 1.8 cups, whereas softer cheeses like mozzarella might be closer to 1.6 cups. If you're adapting a recipe from grams to cups, it's always best to weigh the cheese first for the most accurate results.</p>

<p>If you're working with pre-shredded cheese, note that it often contains anti-caking agents, which can slightly alter the volume. For the best flavour and texture, grating your own cheese is recommended. Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable recipes</a> for delicious ways to incorporate grated cheese into your meals.</p>

<h3>Common Recipes Using 175 Grams of Grated Cheese</h3>
<p>175 grams of grated cheese is perfect for dishes like air fryer quesadillas, cheesy garlic bread, or a classic mac and cheese. This amount ensures a rich, cheesy flavour without overwhelming the dish. For a lighter option, try sprinkling 175 grams of grated cheese over air fryer roasted vegetables or a hearty salad.</p>

<h2>Tips for Storing Grated Cheese</h2>
<p>If you've grated more cheese than you need, store it in an airtight container in the fridge for up to a week. For longer storage, freeze the grated cheese in portions—175 grams is a handy amount to freeze for future recipes. When you're ready to use it, thaw it in the fridge overnight. For more tips on keeping your air fryer in top condition, check out our guide on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner</a>.</p>

<p>Grated cheese can clump together over time, so give it a quick stir before measuring. If you're using frozen grated cheese, let it thaw completely and pat it dry with a paper towel to remove excess moisture. This ensures your measurements stay accurate and your dishes turn out perfectly.

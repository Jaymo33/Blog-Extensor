<p>160 ml of single cream is approximately 0.68 cups in the UK and 0.67 cups in the US. This conversion is essential for baking, cooking, and air fryer recipes where precision matters. Whether you're whipping up a creamy sauce or a decadent dessert, knowing the exact measurement ensures your dish turns out perfectly.</p>

<h2>Understanding the Conversion</h2>  
<p>Converting millilitres to cups can be tricky, especially when dealing with liquids like single cream. The UK and US use slightly different cup measurements, which can affect your recipe. In the UK, 1 cup equals 284 ml, while in the US, it's 240 ml. For 160 ml of single cream, this means roughly 0.68 cups in the UK and 0.67 cups in the US.</p>  
<p>If you're using an air fryer, precise measurements are even more critical. Too much or too little cream can alter the texture and taste of your dish. For more air fryer tips, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> to simplify your cooking process.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Single cream is a staple in many recipes, from soups to desserts. Using the wrong amount can lead to a runny sauce or a dry cake. For example, if you're making a creamy pasta dish in your air fryer, 160 ml of single cream provides just the right richness without overpowering other ingredients.</p>  
<p>Baking is another area where precision is key. A slight variation in cream measurement can affect the consistency of your batter or dough. If you're experimenting with new recipes, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a> offers plenty of inspiration with accurate measurements.</p>  

<h3>UK vs. US Cup Measurements</h3>  
<p>The difference between UK and US cup sizes might seem small, but it can add up in recipes requiring multiple measurements. For 160 ml of single cream, the UK measurement is 0.68 cups, while the US is 0.67 cups. This slight variance won't ruin a dish, but it's good to know for precision.</p>  

<h2>Tips for Measuring Single Cream</h2>  
<p>Using a measuring jug with millilitre markings is the easiest way to measure 160 ml of single cream. If you don't have one, a standard UK cup (284 ml) filled just over halfway will give you the right amount. For US cups (240 ml), fill it to about two-thirds full.</p>  
<p>When working with air fryer recipes, consistency is key. Too much cream can make dishes soggy, while too little can dry them out. For more tips on maintaining your air fryer, visit our guide on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>how to clean your air fryer</a>.</p>  

<h3>Common Uses for 160 ml of Single Cream</h3>  
<p>Single cream is versatile and used in everything from sauces to desserts. A 160 ml portion is perfect for enriching soups, creating creamy pasta sauces, or adding moisture to cakes. If you're exploring new dishes, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert recipes</a> showcase delicious ways to use single cream.</p>  

<h2>Converting Other Measurements</h2>  
<p>If your recipe calls for a different amount of single cream, it's easy to adjust. For example, 80 ml is roughly 0.34 cups in the UK and 0.33 cups in the US. Doubling the recipe? 320 ml equals about 1.36 UK cups or 1.33 US cups.</p>

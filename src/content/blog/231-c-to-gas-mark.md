<p>231 C converts to Gas Mark 4. This is the standard UK oven temperature equivalent that works perfectly for most baking and roasting in both conventional ovens and air fryers. Whether you're adapting a recipe from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> or converting an old family favourite, knowing this conversion ensures consistent results.</p>

<h2>Understanding 231 C to Gas Mark Conversion</h2>
<p>The Gas Mark system is uniquely British, developed as a simpler way to set oven temperatures before digital controls existed. Gas Mark 4 represents the moderate heat range ideal for everything from Victoria sponges to roast chicken. When your air fryer recipe calls for 231 C, you're typically looking at cooking times between 20-40 minutes depending on what you're preparing. Many classic <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/Cakes>cake recipes</a> use this temperature as it provides gentle, even heat without risking burnt edges.</p>
<p>Modern air fryers with digital controls make temperature conversion easier than ever, but understanding the Gas Mark equivalent helps when using older cookbooks or handwritten recipes. The 231 C to Gas Mark 4 conversion remains consistent whether you're using a conventional oven, fan-assisted oven, or air fryer. However, air fryers cook faster due to their compact size and powerful circulation, so you may need to reduce cooking times by about 20% when converting oven recipes.</p>

<h3>Why 231 C to Gas Mark Matters for Air Fryer Cooking</h3>
<p>Precision matters when air frying, as the compact cooking chamber means temperature fluctuations have more immediate effects. Gas Mark 4 (231 C) is particularly versatile - hot enough to crisp chicken wings yet gentle enough for delicate pastries. When converting 231 degrees Celsius to Gas Mark for your air fryer, remember that most models don't use Gas Mark settings, so you'll need to set the temperature directly to 231 C. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> can help with other common temperature adjustments.</p>

<h2>Common Uses for 231 C (Gas Mark 4) in Air Fryers</h2>
<p>This temperature works beautifully for a wide range of air fryer dishes. From golden roast potatoes to perfectly risen muffins, 231 C provides the ideal balance between browning and thorough cooking. Many frozen foods like chicken nuggets or spring rolls cook perfectly at this temperature, achieving that desirable crisp exterior without burning. It's also excellent for reheating leftovers - much better than a microwave for restoring crisp textures.</p>
<p>When preparing <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/Vegetables>vegetable dishes</a> in your air fryer, 231 C (Gas Mark 4) helps caramelise natural sugars without drying them out. Root vegetables particularly benefit from this temperature, developing rich flavours while maintaining some bite. For meat lovers, this setting works well for thicker cuts that need thorough cooking without excessive browning - think pork chops or chicken thighs.</p>

<h3>Adjusting Cooking Times at 231 C in Your Air Fryer</h3>
<p>While the 231 C to Gas Mark conversion remains constant, air fryer cooking times typically need reducing compared to conventional ovens. Start checking your food about 5 minutes before the original recipe suggests. The intense air circulation means foods cook faster and more evenly, though basket shaking or turning may still be necessary for even browning. Always preheat your air fryer to 231 C for consistent results, just as you would with a Gas Mark 4 oven setting.</p>

<h2>Special Considerations for Baking at 231 C (Gas Mark 4)</h2>
<p>Baking in an air fryer at 231 C requires some technique adjustments. Use smaller baking tins or silicone moulds that fit your air fryer basket, and consider reducing sugar quantities slightly as caramelisation happens faster. The powerful heat circulation can dry out some batters, so covering with foil during the first half of cooking often helps. Many bakers find they get the best results by starting at 231 C then reducing to 200 C for the final few minutes.</p>
<p>For those converting family recipes from Gas Mark to Celsius, remember that 231 C is just one of several key baking temperatures. Our complete guide at <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> covers all the essential conversions. When baking at 231 C in your air fryer, always use an oven thermometer to verify the temperature, as some models can run slightly hot or cold. This ensures your Victoria sponge or scones turn out perfectly every time.</p>

<h3>Cleaning Your Air Fryer After Cooking at 231 C</h3>
<p>After cooking at higher temperatures like 231 C, your air fryer may develop more stubborn grease spots. Regular cleaning with our recommended <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaning solutions</a> keeps it performing optimally. Always cool the appliance completely before cleaning, and pay special attention to the heating element area where splatters can accumulate at these temperatures.</p>

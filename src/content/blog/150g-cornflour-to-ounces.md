<h2>Why accurate cornflour measurements matter</h2>
<p>Cornflour plays a crucial role in many air fryer recipes, from creating crispy coatings to thickening sauces. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we know that even small measurement differences can affect texture and cooking times. That's why converting 150g cornflour to ounces correctly is so important for consistent results.</p>
<p>Many UK recipes use grams, while some older cookbooks or international sources might use ounces. Our conversion helps bridge this gap, especially when preparing air fryer favourites like crispy chicken or vegetable tempura. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more handy measurement swaps.</p>

<h2>How to measure 150g of cornflour</h2>
<p>For the most accurate 150g cornflour to ounces conversion, use digital kitchen scales. Scoop the cornflour lightly into your measuring cup or onto the scales without packing it down. This prevents over-measuring, which could make batters too thick or coatings too dense in your air fryer creations.</p>
<p>If you don't have scales, 150g of cornflour equals about 5.29 ounces or roughly 1 UK cup plus 1 tablespoon. However, we always recommend weighing for precision, especially when making delicate <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>air fryer cakes</a> where texture is crucial.</p>

<h3>Cornflour vs other thickeners</h3>
<p>While converting 150g cornflour to ounces is straightforward, it's worth noting that cornflour has different properties to plain flour or arrowroot. Cornflour creates crispier coatings and clearer sauces, making it ideal for many air fryer recipes. Its lighter texture means 150g occupies slightly more volume than the same weight of plain flour.</p>

<h2>Common uses for 150g of cornflour</h2>
<p>150g (5.29 ounces) of cornflour is a useful quantity for several air fryer preparations. It's enough to coat 4-6 chicken portions for crispy fried chicken, or to make batter for a batch of tempura vegetables. This amount also works well for thickening sauces or gravies to accompany your air fryer mains.</p>

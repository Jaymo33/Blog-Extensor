<h3>Converting 10 ml of Maple Syrup for Different Recipes</h3>

<h2>Cleaning Up After Using Maple Syrup in Your Air Fryer</h2>  
<p>Maple syrup can be sticky, and if it drips into your air fryer basket, it may cause residue buildup. To keep your appliance in top condition, clean it immediately after use. A mixture of warm water and mild detergent works well, or try our recommended <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner</a> for tough stains.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers cook food quickly and evenly, but they rely on precise ingredient ratios to achieve the best texture and flavour. Using the correct amount of condensed milk—59 ml for 0.25 cups—ensures your recipes turn out as intended. Too much or too little can affect moisture levels, browning, and even cooking times.</p>

<p>3 cups of lemon juice equals approximately 24 fluid ounces (or 24 oz). This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes, ensuring accurate measurements for marinades, dressings, or baked goods. Whether you’re preparing a zesty lemon drizzle cake or a tangy chicken marinade, knowing how many ounces are in 3 cups of lemon juice helps you achieve consistent results.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Precision is key when using an air fryer, as slight variations in liquid quantities can affect texture and cooking times. Lemon juice, often used in marinades or glazes, needs to be measured correctly to balance flavours. Too much can overpower a dish, while too little might leave it lacking brightness. For more air fryer measurement tips, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>  

<p>Many air fryer recipes, like lemon garlic shrimp or citrus-glazed salmon, rely on lemon juice for acidity and freshness. If you’re scaling a recipe up or down, converting 3 cups of lemon juice to ounces ensures you maintain the right ratios. This is especially useful for meal prep or batch cooking, where consistency is crucial.</p>  

<h3>Lemon Juice Conversions: Cups to Ounces</h3>  
<p>In the UK and US, 1 cup of lemon juice is equivalent to 8 fluid ounces. Therefore, 3 cups of lemon juice equal 24 fluid ounces. This measurement applies whether you’re using freshly squeezed lemon juice or store-bought varieties. For recipes requiring weight instead of volume, 24 fluid ounces of lemon juice weigh roughly 680 grams.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for 3 Cups of Lemon Juice in Air Fryer Recipes</h2>  
<p>Lemon juice is a versatile ingredient in air fryer cooking. From marinades to desserts, 3 cups (or 24 oz) can be used in dishes like lemon herb chicken, citrus-glazed vegetables, or even lemon curd for air-fried pastries. Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> for inspiration.</p>  

<p>If you’re prepping a large batch of lemon-infused dishes, such as lemon pepper tofu or lemon garlic cod, 3 cups of lemon juice ensures you have enough for multiple servings. The acidity also helps tenderise proteins, making it ideal for air fryer cooking. Just remember to pat ingredients dry before air frying to avoid excess moisture.</p>  

<h3>Tips for Measuring Lemon Juice Accurately</h3>  
<p>For precise measurements, use a liquid measuring cup rather than dry cups. Fill it to the 3-cup mark at eye level to avoid over- or under-pouring. If using bottled lemon juice, shake well before measuring to ensure consistency. For fresh lemons, about 12–15 medium lemons yield 3 cups (24 oz) of juice.</p>  

<h2>Cleaning Your Air Fryer After Using Lemon Juice</h2>  
<p>Lemon juice can leave residues or sticky spots in your air fryer basket. To keep it in top condition, wipe down the basket and tray with warm, soapy water after use. For stubborn stains, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner guide</a> offers simple solutions.</p>  

<p>Regular maintenance ensures your air fryer performs optimally, especially when cooking acidic ingredients like lemon juice. Avoid abrasive cleaners, as they can damage non-stick coatings. Instead, opt for gentle, food-safe cleaning agents to prolong your appliance’s lifespan.</p>

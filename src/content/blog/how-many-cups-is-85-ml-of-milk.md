<p>85 ml of milk is approximately 0.36 cups (US) or 0.34 cups (UK). This conversion is essential for precise baking and cooking, especially when using an air fryer. Whether you're whipping up a cake or a creamy sauce, knowing how to measure liquids correctly ensures perfect results every time.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Milk Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Getting the right amount of milk is crucial for recipes, especially in baking where ratios affect texture and rise. Too much or too little can lead to dense cakes or runny batters. For air fryer recipes, precise measurements help achieve even cooking and perfect consistency. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more handy tips.</p>  

<p>In the UK, cup measurements differ slightly from the US, so it's important to use the correct standard. If you're following a recipe from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, always check whether it uses metric or imperial measurements to avoid mistakes.</p>  

<h2>How to Measure 85 ml of Milk Without a Scale</h2>  
<p>If you don't have a measuring jug, you can use tablespoons as a rough guide. One tablespoon holds about 15 ml, so 85 ml is roughly 5.5 tablespoons. For baking, it's best to use proper measuring tools for accuracy. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a> includes many dishes where precise milk measurements make all the difference.</p>  

<h3>US vs. UK Cup Measurements</h3>  
<p>In the US, one cup equals 240 ml, while in the UK, it's 250 ml. This means 85 ml of milk is 0.36 cups in the US and 0.34 cups in the UK. Always verify which standard your recipe uses to avoid errors. For more baking tips, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>cake recipes</a>.</p>

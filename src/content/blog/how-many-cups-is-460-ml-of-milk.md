<p>460 ml of milk is approximately 1.94 cups in the UK or 1.95 cups in the US. This conversion is essential for recipes, especially when using an air fryer for baking or cooking. Whether you're whipping up a cake or a creamy sauce, getting the measurement right ensures perfect results every time.</p>  

<h2>Understanding Milk Measurements</h2>  
<p>When converting 460 ml of milk to cups, it's important to note the difference between UK and US cup sizes. A UK cup holds 250 ml, while a US cup is slightly smaller at 240 ml. For accuracy in recipes, especially when using an air fryer, precise measurements matter. You can find more conversion tips on our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>  

<p>Many baking recipes, like those for cakes or custards, rely on exact liquid measurements. If you're using 460 ml of milk, rounding to 2 cups (UK) is often acceptable, but for precision, stick to 1.94 cups. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipes section</a> for inspiration on how to use this measurement in delicious dishes.</p>  

<h3>Why Accuracy Matters in Air Fryer Cooking</h3>  
<p>Air fryers require precise ingredient ratios to ensure even cooking. Too much or too little liquid, like 460 ml of milk, can affect texture and cooking time. For example, a batter with excess milk might not crisp properly. Always measure carefully for the best results.</p>  

<h2>Converting 460 ml of Milk for Different Recipes</h2>  
<p>Whether you're making a creamy pasta sauce or a fluffy pancake batter, 460 ml of milk translates to just under 2 cups. This measurement is common in many <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert recipes</a>, such as custards or puddings. Using the correct amount ensures the right consistency and flavour.</p>  

<p>For savoury dishes, like a cheese sauce or mashed potatoes, 460 ml of milk provides the perfect balance of creaminess. If you're scaling a recipe, remember that 460 ml is roughly 1.95 US cups or 1.94 UK cups. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning guide</a> can help you maintain your air fryer after cooking with milk-based dishes.</p>  

<h3>Tips for Measuring Milk in Cups</h3>  
<p>To measure 460 ml of milk accurately, use a liquid measuring cup with clear markings. Pour the milk slowly to avoid spills, and check at eye level. For sticky ingredients like condensed milk, lightly grease the cup first for easy pouring.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for 460 ml of Milk</h2>  
<p>This measurement is ideal for recipes like rice pudding, b√©chamel sauce, or even a small batch of ice cream. If you're experimenting with <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/breakfast>breakfast recipes</a>, 460 ml of milk can make a generous portion of overnight oats or pancake batter.</p>  

<p>For those who prefer savoury dishes, 460 ml of milk works well in creamy soups or casseroles. Just remember to adjust cooking times in your air fryer based on the dish's thickness and ingredients.</p>

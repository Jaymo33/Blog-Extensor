Whether you're whipping up a cake or a creamy sauce, knowing how to convert millilitres to cups ensures consistency in your dishes.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurement Matters</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of oat milk can make or break a recipe. Too much liquid can lead to soggy textures, while too little might dry out your dish. For air fryer recipes, precision is key to achieving that perfect crispiness. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more handy measurement tips.</p>  

<p>Oat milk is a popular dairy-free alternative, and its consistency can vary slightly between brands. Measuring 735 ml of oat milk correctly ensures your recipes turn out as intended. Whether you're making pancakes or a savoury sauce, this conversion will help you nail the texture every time.</p>  

<h2>How to Measure 735 ml of Oat Milk</h2>  
<p>If you don't have a measuring jug with millilitre markings, you can use standard cups. One cup holds roughly 240 ml, so 735 ml is just over 3 cups. For more precise results, use a kitchen scale or a liquid measuring cup. Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a> for ideas on how to use oat milk in your air fryer.</p>

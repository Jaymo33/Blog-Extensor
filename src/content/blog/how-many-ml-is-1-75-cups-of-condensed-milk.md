<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>

<p>Condensed milk is thicker than regular milk, so measuring by volume (cups) can sometimes be tricky. Converting to millilitres (ml) gives you a more accurate measurement, especially for international recipes. If you’re using a UK or US measuring cup, note that 1 cup equals 236.6 ml, making 1.75 cups roughly 414 ml. Always double-check your conversions to avoid mishaps.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure Condensed Milk Correctly</h3>  
<p>To measure 1.75 cups of condensed milk accurately, use a liquid measuring cup with ml markings. Spoon the condensed milk into the cup without packing it down, then level it off with a knife. For sticky ingredients like condensed milk, lightly greasing the measuring cup can help it slide out easily. This method ensures you get the exact 414 ml needed for your recipe.</p>

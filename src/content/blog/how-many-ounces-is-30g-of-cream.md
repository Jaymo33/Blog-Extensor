<p>30 grams of cream is approximately 1.06 ounces. Whether you’re whipping up a dessert or adding a creamy touch to a savoury dish in your air fryer, getting the measurements right is key. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we know precision matters, especially when converting grams to ounces for UK recipes.</p>

<h2>Why Convert 30g of Cream to Ounces?</h2>  
<p>Many UK recipes, especially those for air fryers, use grams, but some kitchen scales or international recipes might list ounces. Knowing how to convert 30g of cream to ounces ensures your dishes turn out perfectly every time. Cream is a common ingredient in air fryer desserts like cakes or custards, so accuracy is crucial.</p>  
<p>For example, if you’re making a creamy garlic sauce for chicken or a dessert from our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipes</a> section, 30g of cream translates to just over 1 ounce. This small but precise measurement can make all the difference in texture and flavour.</p>  

<h2>How to Measure 30g of Cream Accurately</h2>  
<p>If your kitchen scale doesn’t switch between grams and ounces, here’s a simple trick: 30g of cream equals roughly 1.06 ounces. For most recipes, rounding to 1 ounce works fine, but for baking or delicate sauces, stick to the exact conversion. Use a digital scale for the best results.</p>  
<p>Need a visual? 30g of cream is about two tablespoons. If you’re preparing a dish from our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert</a> category, like a chocolate mousse or cheesecake, this measurement ensures consistency.</p>  

<h3>Common Uses for 30g of Cream in Air Fryer Recipes</h3>  
<p>30g of cream is often used in small-batch recipes, like single-serving desserts or sauces. For instance, a creamy mushroom sauce for steak or a drizzle for air-fried fruit crumbles. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a> for other common measurements.</p>  

<h3>Does Cream Type Affect the Weight?</h3>  
<p>Whether it’s double, single, or whipped cream, 30g will always equal 1.06 ounces by weight. However, whipped cream has more air, so 30g by volume might look different. For accuracy, weigh it instead of using cups or spoons.</p>  

<h2>Tips for Working with Cream in Your Air Fryer</h2>  
<p>Cream can curdle or separate if overheated, so when using it in air fryer recipes, add it towards the end of cooking. For example, stir it into a sauce after the main ingredients are cooked. This keeps the texture smooth and rich.</p>

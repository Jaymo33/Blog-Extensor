<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Precision is key when using an air fryer, as uneven portions can lead to undercooked or overcooked food. Rolled barley, like other grains, expands during cooking, so measuring correctly ensures even results. A 0.25 cup portion is ideal for single servings or side dishes. If you’re new to air frying, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> for inspiration. Always use a kitchen scale for the most accurate conversions.</p>  

<h3>How to measure rolled barley without a scale</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a scale, use a dry measuring cup for rolled barley. Fluff the barley lightly before scooping to avoid compacting it. Level off the excess with a straight edge for an exact 0.25 cup measurement. Remember, 0.25 cup of rolled barley equals roughly 0.88 ounces.

<p>5 grams (5g) of soy sauce is approximately 0.18 ounces (oz). Whether you're preparing a marinade for your air fryer or adjusting a recipe, this conversion ensures accuracy. Soy sauce is a staple in many dishes, from stir-fries to glazes, and knowing how to measure it correctly is key. For more air fryer-friendly conversions, visit <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>our conversion chart</a>.</p>  

<h2>Why Convert 5g of Soy Sauce to Ounces?</h2>  
<p>Many UK recipes use grams, while others rely on ounces, making conversions essential. If you're using an air fryer, precise measurements can affect texture and flavour. For example, a marinade with too much soy sauce might become overly salty. Conversely, too little could leave your dish bland. Check out <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>our recipe collection</a> for perfectly balanced dishes.</p>  

<p>Converting 5g of soy sauce to ounces (0.18 oz) helps when using kitchen scales or measuring spoons. Some scales switch between units, but others require manual calculations. This is especially handy for air fryer cooking, where small quantities matter. Whether you're making crispy tofu or glazed salmon, accuracy ensures delicious results every time.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure 5g of Soy Sauce Without Scales</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have scales, 5g of soy sauce is roughly one teaspoon. However, this can vary slightly depending on the brand and viscosity. For air fryer recipes, using a measuring spoon is a quick alternative. Just remember that 0.18 oz (5g) is a small amount, so pour carefully. Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/tofu>tofu recipes</a> for ideas on using soy sauce effectively.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for 5g of Soy Sauce in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Soy sauce adds depth to marinades, glazes, and dipping sauces. In an air fryer, a little goes a long way—5g (0.18 oz) can season a single portion of chicken or tofu perfectly. It’s also great for enhancing the umami flavour in vegetables like mushrooms or broccoli. For inspiration, browse our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable recipes</a>.</p>  

<p>When reheating leftovers in the air fryer, a dash of soy sauce can revive flavours. Just 5g (0.18 oz) mixed with a bit of oil can refresh fried rice or noodles. Avoid overdoing it, as the air fryer intensifies flavours. For tips on cleaning your air fryer after saucy dishes, visit <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>our cleaning guide</a>.</p>  

<h3>Converting Larger Quantities of Soy Sauce</h3>  
<p>Need to scale up? Multiply the conversion—for example, 10g of soy sauce equals 0.35 oz. This is useful for batch cooking or meal prep in the air fryer. Remember, soy sauce is high in sodium, so adjust other seasonings accordingly.

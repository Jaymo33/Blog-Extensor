<p>500g of self-raising flour equals approximately 17.64 ounces. This conversion is essential for bakers who prefer using imperial measurements or follow recipes with ounce-based instructions. Whether you're baking cakes, bread, or other treats in your air fryer, knowing this conversion ensures consistent results every time. For more handy conversions, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>  

<h2>Why Convert Grams to Ounces?</h2>  
<p>Many UK recipes use grams, while others rely on ounces, especially older or American-inspired recipes. Converting 500g of self-raising flour to ounces (17.64 oz) helps avoid measurement mishaps. This is particularly useful when using an air fryer, where precise ingredient ratios can affect texture and rise. If you're exploring new recipes, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a> offers plenty of inspiration.</p>  

<p>Self-raising flour contains baking powder, so accurate measurements are crucial for achieving the right lift in baked goods. Too much or too little can lead to dense or overly crumbly results. For air fryer baking, where heat distribution differs from conventional ovens, precision matters even more.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure 500g of Self-Raising Flour</h3>  
<p>To measure 500g of self-raising flour (17.64 oz), use a digital kitchen scale for accuracy. If you don’t have one, spoon the flour into a measuring cup and level it off—avoid packing it down. For air fryer recipes, sifting the flour afterward ensures even distribution and better texture. Need cleaning tips for your air fryer after baking? Try our recommended <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner</a>.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for 500g of Self-Raising Flour</h2>  
<p>500g of self-raising flour (17.64 oz) is enough for a large cake, a batch of scones, or several small air fryer bakes. Popular recipes include Victoria sponge, muffins, and even air-fryer doughnuts. For more ideas, browse our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>cake recipes</a> tailored for air fryers.</p>  

<p>Self-raising flour is also great for quick breads and pancakes. In an air fryer, these bake faster and often come out lighter than traditional methods. Just remember to adjust cooking times and temperatures accordingly—our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a> can help with that too.</p>  

<h3>Storing Self-Raising Flour</h3>  
<p>Keep your 500g (17.64 oz) of self-raising flour in an airtight container to maintain freshness. Moisture can deactivate the baking powder, leading to flat bakes. If you bake often, consider storing smaller portions for convenience.</p>

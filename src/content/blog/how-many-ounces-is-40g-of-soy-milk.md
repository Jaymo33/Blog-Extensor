<p>40 grams (40g) of soy milk equals approximately 1.41 ounces (oz). This conversion is essential for precise measurements in air fryer recipes, ensuring your dishes turn out perfectly every time. Whether you're whipping up a creamy sauce or baking a dairy-free dessert, knowing how to convert grams to ounces is a game-changer. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we focus on making cooking simpler with accurate conversions and delicious recipes.</p>  

<h2>Why Convert 40g of Soy Milk to Ounces?</h2>  
<p>Many air fryer recipes, especially those from the UK, use metric measurements like grams. However, some kitchen scales or recipe books might list ingredients in ounces. Converting 40g of soy milk to ounces ensures you get the right consistency and flavour in your dishes. Whether you're making a vegan cake or a savoury sauce, precision matters. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more handy measurement tips.</p>  

<p>Soy milk is a popular dairy alternative, and its weight can vary slightly based on brand and thickness. However, 40g is a standard measurement for small portions, like adding to batters or smoothies. If you're preparing a larger batch, you might need to scale up the conversion. For more recipe ideas, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipes section</a>.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure 40g of Soy Milk Accurately</h3>  
<p>Using a digital kitchen scale is the easiest way to measure 40g of soy milk. Set your scale to grams, pour the soy milk until it hits 40g, and then convert to ounces if needed. If you don’t have a scale, 40g is roughly 2.5 tablespoons, but weighing is always more accurate. For best results in air fryer cooking, stick to precise measurements.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for 40g of Soy Milk in Air Fryer Recipes</h2>  
<p>40g of soy milk is often used in small-batch recipes, like single-serving pancakes or muffins. It’s also perfect for light sauces or glazes in air fryer dishes. If you're making a vegan <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert</a>, this measurement ensures the right balance of moisture without overpowering other flavours. For savoury dishes, like marinated tofu, 40g can be just enough to create a creamy coating.</p>  

<p>Another great use for 40g of soy milk is in air fryer batters. Whether you're coating chicken or vegetables, this amount helps achieve a light, crispy texture. If you're experimenting with dairy-free cooking, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/tofu>tofu recipes</a> are a great place to start.</p>  

<h3>Tips for Storing and Using Soy Milk</h3>  
<p>Once opened, soy milk should be refrigerated and used within a few days. Shake well before measuring, as separation is natural. If you’re using it in air fryer recipes, room-temperature soy milk blends better with dry ingredients.

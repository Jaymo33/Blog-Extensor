<h2>Why Accurate Vinegar Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of vinegar is crucial for balancing flavours in marinades, dressings, and sauces. Too much can overpower a dish, while too little may leave it bland. In air fryer cooking, vinegar is often used to tenderise meats or add tang to glazes. For example, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer chicken recipes</a> often include vinegar for extra juiciness.</p>  

<p>Vinegar also plays a role in cleaning your air fryer, helping to dissolve grease and remove odours. A 1:1 mix of vinegar and water (237 ml each) makes an effective natural cleaner.

<h3>Types of Vinegar and Their Uses</h3>  
<p>Different vinegars have unique flavours and strengths, but their ml-to-cup ratio stays the same. White vinegar is great for pickling, while balsamic adds depth to roasted vegetables. Apple cider vinegar works well in marinades for <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>air fryer chicken dishes</a>.</p>  

<h2>Converting Other Cup Measurements to ml</h2>  
<p>If your recipe calls for a different amount of vinegar, here’s a quick reference: 0.5 cups = 118 ml, 2 cups = 473 ml. These conversions are handy when scaling recipes up or down. For baking, precise measurements ensure your cakes and breads rise properly.

<p>Measuring liquids like vinegar in ml is more accurate than using cups, especially in smaller quantities. A digital kitchen scale can help, but a graduated measuring jug works too. Always measure at eye level for the best accuracy.</p>  

<h3>Common Mistakes When Measuring Vinegar</h3>  
<p>One mistake is confusing fluid ounces with ml—remember, 1 cup = 237 ml, not 240 ml. Another is using a dry measuring cup instead of a liquid one, which can lead to slight inaccuracies. For consistent results, stick to ml measurements where possible.</p>

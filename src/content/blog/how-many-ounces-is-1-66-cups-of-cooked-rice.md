<h2>Why Convert Cups to Ounces for Air Fryer Cooking?</h2>
<p>Converting cups to ounces helps achieve accuracy, especially in air fryer cooking where space and heat distribution matter. Unlike volume measurements, weight (ounces) accounts for rice density, which varies with moisture content. This precision prevents overloading your air fryer basket, ensuring even cooking.

<h3>How to Measure Cooked Rice Accurately</h3>
<p>Use a kitchen scale for the most reliable conversion from cups to ounces. Fluff the rice with a fork before measuring to prevent compacting, which skews volume. For 1.66 cups, lightly spoon the rice into a measuring cup without pressing down. If scaling recipes, note that 1 cup of cooked rice typically weighs 8 ounces.</p>

<h2>Common Uses for 1.66 Cups of Cooked Rice in Air Fryers</h2>

<p>4 tablespoons (tbsp) of oats weigh approximately 30 grams. This measurement is crucial for air fryer recipes, ensuring consistency in texture and cooking times. Whether you're making granola, oat bars, or coating for chicken, precise measurements matter. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we know accuracy makes all the difference in air frying. Let’s break down why this conversion matters and how to use it.</p>  

<h2>Why measuring oats correctly matters</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of oats ensures your air fryer recipes turn out perfectly every time. Too many oats can make dishes dry, while too few may leave them soggy. For example, oat-coated chicken or homemade granola relies on precise measurements. A kitchen scale is the best tool, but if you don’t have one, tablespoons to grams conversions are handy.

<p>Oats are a staple in many air fryer recipes, from breakfast to desserts. Whether you're making crunchy toppings or binding ingredients, 4 tbsp (30g) is a common measurement.

Getting the weight right ensures even cooking and perfect results every time.</p>  

<h3>How to measure oats without a scale</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a kitchen scale, use the spoon-and-level method for accuracy. Fill your tablespoon loosely with oats, then level it off with a knife. Avoid packing the oats down, as this can lead to over-measuring. Four level tablespoons should give you roughly 30 grams.

<h3>Tips for storing oats</h3>  
<p>Keep your oats fresh by storing them in an airtight container in a cool, dry place. This prevents them from absorbing moisture and losing their texture. For long-term storage, consider freezing them in portions. Properly stored oats ensure your 4 tbsp (30g) measurements stay consistent over time.</p>

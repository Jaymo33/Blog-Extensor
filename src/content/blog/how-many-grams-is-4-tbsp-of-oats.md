<p>4 tablespoons (tbsp) of oats weigh approximately 30 grams. This measurement is crucial for air fryer recipes, ensuring consistency in texture and cooking times. Whether you're making granola, oat bars, or coating for chicken, precise measurements matter. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we know accuracy makes all the difference in air frying. Let’s break down why this conversion matters and how to use it.</p>  

<h2>Why measuring oats correctly matters</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of oats ensures your air fryer recipes turn out perfectly every time. Too many oats can make dishes dry, while too few may leave them soggy. For example, oat-coated chicken or homemade granola relies on precise measurements. A kitchen scale is the best tool, but if you don’t have one, tablespoons to grams conversions are handy. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more helpful measurements.</p>  

<p>Oats are a staple in many air fryer recipes, from breakfast to desserts. Whether you're making crunchy toppings or binding ingredients, 4 tbsp (30g) is a common measurement. For more recipe ideas, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/breakfast>breakfast category</a>. Getting the weight right ensures even cooking and perfect results every time.</p>  

<h3>How to measure oats without a scale</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a kitchen scale, use the spoon-and-level method for accuracy. Fill your tablespoon loosely with oats, then level it off with a knife. Avoid packing the oats down, as this can lead to over-measuring. Four level tablespoons should give you roughly 30 grams. For more tips, visit <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for 4 tbsp of oats in air fryer recipes</h2>  
<p>Four tablespoons of oats (30g) are perfect for coating chicken or fish before air frying. They add a crispy texture without needing excess oil. You can also mix them into homemade granola or energy bars for a healthy crunch. For dessert lovers, try incorporating oats into air-fried cookies or crumbles. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipes section</a> for inspiration.</p>  

<p>Oats are also great for binding ingredients in veggie burgers or meatballs. Their neutral flavour makes them versatile in savoury and sweet dishes. If you're meal prepping, knowing that 4 tbsp equals 30 grams helps with portion control.

<h3>Tips for storing oats</h3>  
<p>Keep your oats fresh by storing them in an airtight container in a cool, dry place. This prevents them from absorbing moisture and losing their texture. For long-term storage, consider freezing them in portions. Properly stored oats ensure your 4 tbsp (30g) measurements stay consistent over time.</p>

<p>0.5 cup of almonds equals approximately 2.5 ounces (70 grams). This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements ensure perfect texture and flavour. Whether you’re making almond-crusted chicken or a batch of air-fried granola, knowing the weight helps avoid under or over-seasoning.</p>

<h2>Why accurate almond measurements matter in air frying</h2>  
<p>Air fryers cook food quickly and evenly, but incorrect measurements can lead to uneven results. Too many almonds might overcrowd the basket, while too few won’t provide enough crunch. For recipes like almond-crusted fish or roasted vegetables, 0.5 cup (2.5 oz) is a common portion size. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more handy measurement tips.</p>  

<p>Almonds add texture and nutrition to air-fried dishes, but their density means volume measurements can vary. Whole almonds differ slightly from sliced or slivered almonds in weight per cup. For consistent results, weigh your almonds using kitchen scales or refer to trusted conversions like ours at <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>.</p>  

<h3>Types of almonds and their weights</h3>  
<p>Whole natural almonds weigh roughly 5 oz per cup, so 0.5 cup equals 2.5 oz. Blanched or sliced almonds may vary slightly due to processing. If your air fryer recipe calls for almond flour, 0.5 cup weighs closer to 1.75 oz—always check the packaging for specifics.</p>  

<h2>Converting 0.5 cup almonds to ounces for UK cooks</h2>  
<p>In the UK, recipes often use grams, but ounces remain popular for baking. Our 0.5 cup to oz almond conversion (2.5 oz) works for both US and UK measuring cups. For gram measurements, 0.5 cup almonds equals 70g—ideal for <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>air fryer desserts</a> like frangipane or biscotti.</p>  

<p>Precision matters when coating foods like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>air fryer chicken</a> with almond crusts. Too much coating can burn, while too little won’t crisp properly. Use our 0.5 cup (2.5 oz) guideline and adjust based on your air fryer’s capacity. Smaller models may require batch cooking for even results.</p>  

<h3>Tips for measuring almonds without scales</h3>  
<p>No kitchen scales? Spoon almonds into your measuring cup and level off the top—don’t pack them down. For 0.5 cup, fill halfway and check for consistency. Remember that 1 US cup = 8 UK fluid ounces, but weights stay the same. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a> includes weight and volume measures for foolproof cooking.</p>  

<h2>Common air fryer recipes using 0.5 cup almonds</h2>  
<p>From crunchy toppings to main dishes, 0.5 cup (2.5 oz) almonds features in many air fryer favourites. Try almond-crusted tofu, granola clusters, or Moroccan-spiced nuts. For cleaning sticky almond residue, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner guide</a> keeps your appliance spotless.</p>  

<p>Almonds toast beautifully in air fryers at 160°C for 5-8 minutes—shake the basket occasionally. Store unused almonds in airtight containers to maintain freshness. Whether you’re converting 0.5 cup to ounces for meal prep or snacks, accurate measures guarantee delicious results every time.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>
<p>Using the right amount of mozzarella cheese is crucial for air fryer recipes. Too little, and your dish might lack flavour; too much, and it could become overly greasy. Air fryers cook food quickly, so precise measurements help achieve the perfect texture. For example, 475 grams of mozzarella cheese (about 2.25 cups) is ideal for a family-sized pizza.

<p>Different brands of mozzarella cheese may vary slightly in density, so it's always best to weigh your ingredients if possible. However, if you don’t have scales, the cup measurement will get you close enough for most dishes.

<h2>How to Measure Mozzarella Cheese for Air Fryer Recipes</h2>
<p>When measuring 475 grams of mozzarella cheese, it’s important to consider whether it’s shredded, cubed, or sliced. Shredded cheese packs more densely into a cup, while cubed or sliced cheese leaves more air gaps. For accuracy, lightly pack shredded mozzarella into the measuring cup without pressing too hard. This method ensures you get the right amount for recipes like air fryer garlic bread or stuffed mushrooms.</p>

<h3>Shredded vs. Cubed Mozzarella</h3>
<p>Shredded mozzarella is the most common form used in air fryer recipes because it melts evenly. If you’re using cubed mozzarella, 475 grams will take up slightly more volume—closer to 2.5 cups. For dishes like air fryer caprese skewers, cubed cheese works beautifully.

<h2>How to Measure Mozzarella Cheese for Air Fryer Recipes</h2>
<p>When measuring 475 grams of mozzarella cheese, it’s important to consider whether it’s shredded, cubed, or sliced. Shredded cheese packs more densely into a cup, while cubed or sliced cheese leaves more air gaps. For accuracy, lightly pack shredded mozzarella into the measuring cup without pressing too hard. This method ensures you get the right amount for recipes like air fryer garlic bread or stuffed mushrooms.</p>

<h3>Shredded vs. Cubed Mozzarella</h3>
<p>Shredded mozzarella is the most common form used in air fryer recipes because it melts evenly. If you’re using cubed mozzarella, 475 grams will take up slightly more volume—closer to 2.5 cups. For dishes like air fryer caprese skewers, cubed cheese works beautifully.

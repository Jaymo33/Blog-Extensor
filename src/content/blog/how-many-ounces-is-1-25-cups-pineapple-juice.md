<p>1.25 cups of pineapple juice equals 10 fluid ounces (UK measurement). This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes, marinades, or cocktails where precision matters. Pineapple juice adds a sweet, tangy flavour to dishes, and knowing the exact weight ensures consistency in your cooking.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Pineapple Juice Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>When using pineapple juice in air fryer recipes, accuracy ensures the right balance of sweetness and acidity. Too much juice can make dishes overly soggy, while too little might leave them lacking flavour. Whether you're making glazes for <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>air fryer chicken</a> or marinades for seafood, 1.25 cups (10 oz) is a common measurement. Check our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more handy measurement tips.</p>  

<p>Pineapple juice is also packed with enzymes like bromelain, which tenderises meat—ideal for air frying. Measuring correctly ensures you get the benefits without overdoing it. For more tropical-inspired dishes, browse our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipe collection</a>.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure Pineapple Juice Correctly</h3>  
<p>Use a liquid measuring cup for the most precise results. Fill to the 1.25-cup mark at eye level to avoid under or over-pouring. If converting 1.25 cups of pineapple juice to ounces for a UK recipe, remember it’s 10 fluid ounces. For thicker mixtures, like smoothies or glazes, a kitchen scale can help verify the weight.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for 1.25 Cups of Pineapple Juice</h2>  
<p>This quantity is perfect for marinades, such as those used in <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/pork>air fryer pork dishes</a>. It’s also great for tropical desserts or glazes for air-fried ham. Since pineapple juice caramelises well in the air fryer, 10 oz (1.25 cups) ensures even coverage without excess liquid pooling.</p>  

<p>Another popular use is in cocktails or mocktails—like a pineapple mojito or a tropical punch. If you’re meal prepping, pre-measuring 1.25 cups (10 oz) saves time.

<h3>Adjusting Recipes for Different Quantities</h3>  
<p>If a recipe calls for 1.25 cups of pineapple juice but you need less, halve it to 0.625 cups (5 oz). Doubling? That’s 2.5 cups (20 oz). Always adjust other liquids accordingly to maintain balance.

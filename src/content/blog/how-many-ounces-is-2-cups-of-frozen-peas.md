<p>2 cups of frozen peas weigh approximately 10 ounces (283 grams). This measurement is essential for air fryer recipes, ensuring accurate portioning and even cooking. Whether you're making a quick side dish or adding peas to a larger meal, knowing the weight helps you nail the recipe every time. For more air fryer conversions, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>  

<h2>Why measure frozen peas in ounces?</h2>  
<p>Measuring frozen peas by weight (ounces) rather than volume (cups) ensures consistency in your air fryer recipes. Volume measurements can vary based on how tightly peas are packed, but weight remains precise. This is especially important for air frying, where even cooking relies on uniform ingredient sizes. If you're prepping a batch of <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable-based dishes</a>, accurate measurements make all the difference.</p>  

<p>Frozen peas are a staple in many kitchens due to their convenience and nutritional value. They retain most of their vitamins and cook quickly in the air fryer, making them ideal for busy weeknights. By knowing that 2 cups equal roughly 10 ounces, you can easily scale recipes up or down. For more recipe ideas, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> collection.</p>  

<h3>How to measure frozen peas accurately</h3>  
<p>For the most precise measurement, use a kitchen scale to weigh your frozen peas directly in ounces. If you don't have a scale, lightly fill a measuring cup without packing the peas down. Avoid thawing them first, as this can alter the weight and texture. Keeping peas frozen ensures they cook evenly in the air fryer, whether you're roasting or adding them to a stir-fry.</p>  

<h2>Tips for cooking frozen peas in the air fryer</h2>  
<p>Frozen peas cook beautifully in the air fryer, retaining their vibrant colour and crisp-tender texture. Preheat your air fryer to 180°C (350°F) and spread the peas in a single layer for even cooking. A light spray of oil and a pinch of salt enhance their natural sweetness. For more tips on maintaining your appliance, see our guide on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaning</a>.</p>  

<p>Air frying frozen peas is a game-changer for quick, healthy sides. Since 2 cups weigh about 10 ounces, you can easily adjust cooking times based on portion size. Smaller batches may take 5-7 minutes, while larger quantities might need 8-10 minutes. Shake the basket halfway through to ensure even crisping. Pair them with other <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/frozen-foods>frozen foods</a> for a complete meal.</p>  

<h3>Common uses for 2 cups of frozen peas</h3>  
<p>Two cups (10 ounces) of frozen peas are perfect for adding to fried rice, soups, or standalone side dishes. Their mild flavour pairs well with herbs, butter, or a sprinkle of Parmesan. In the air fryer, they can be transformed into crispy snacks or blended into dips. The versatility of peas makes them a must-have in any freezer.</p>

<p>5g of treacle equals approximately 0.18 ounces. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements can make all the difference. Whether you're baking sticky toffee pudding or glazing meats, knowing the exact weight ensures consistent results. Treacle, a thick syrup popular in British baking, adds rich flavour but must be measured accurately. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we help you nail these details for perfect dishes every time.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate treacle measurements matter</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of treacle ensures your recipes aren’t overly sweet or too dry. In an air fryer, where cooking times are shorter, precision is key. Too much treacle can cause burning, while too little might leave your dish lacking flavour. For recipes like gingerbread or flapjacks, 5g of treacle (0.18 oz) is often just the right touch. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more handy measurement swaps.</p>  

<p>Treacle’s sticky consistency makes it tricky to measure by volume. Weight is far more reliable, especially when scaling recipes up or down. A digital kitchen scale is your best friend here, ensuring you hit that 5g mark spot-on. If you’re working in ounces, 0.18 oz is the magic number. For more baking tips, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>cake recipes</a> designed for air fryers.</p>  

<h3>How to measure 5g of treacle without scales</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have scales, a teaspoon can approximate 5g of treacle—about 1 slightly heaped teaspoon. However, this method isn’t as precise, so adjust cautiously. Treacle’s thickness means it clings to spoons, so always level off excess for accuracy. For sticky ingredients like this, a silicone spatula helps scrape every last gram into your mix. Visit <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> for more clever kitchen hacks.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for 5g of treacle in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>This small quantity of treacle works wonders in glazes for meats like gammon or chicken. Brushed on during the last few minutes of air frying, it creates a glossy, caramelised finish. In desserts, 5g of treacle enhances depth without overpowering—ideal for individual puddings or biscuits. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a> features dozens of ways to use treacle effectively.</p>  

<p>Treacle also balances acidity in barbecue sauces or baked beans made in the air fryer. Just 5g (0.18 oz) can round out flavours beautifully. Remember, treacle burns faster than sugar, so monitor cooking closely. For savoury ideas, try our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable dishes</a> where a touch of treacle elevates roasted roots.</p>  

<h3>Storing treacle for accurate measuring</h3>  
<p>Keep treacle in a cool, dry place to maintain consistent viscosity. If it crystallises, gently warm the jar in hot water to restore smoothness before measuring. Always wipe the rim clean after use to prevent hardening. Proper storage means your 5g portions will measure the same every time.

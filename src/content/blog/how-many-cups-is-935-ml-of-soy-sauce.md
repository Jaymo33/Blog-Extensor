<p>935 ml of soy sauce equals approximately 3.95 cups (or just under 4 cups) when measured using standard US cup measurements. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes, where precise liquid measurements can make or break a dish. Whether you're marinating chicken, glazing salmon, or preparing a stir-fry sauce, knowing how to convert millilitres to cups ensures consistency in flavour and texture. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we understand the importance of accurate measurements, especially when working with bold ingredients like soy sauce.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Soy Sauce Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of soy sauce is crucial in air fryer cooking. Too little, and your dish may lack depth; too much, and it can become overly salty or overpowering. For example, a recipe calling for 935 ml of soy sauce in a marinade for <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>air fryer chicken</a> needs precise measurement to balance flavours. The difference between 3.5 cups and 4 cups can significantly alter the taste, especially in concentrated sauces or glazes.</p>  

<p>Many air fryer recipes, like those found on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>our recipe hub</a>, rely on soy sauce for umami richness. Whether you're making teriyaki tofu or a honey-soy glaze for salmon, knowing that 935 ml of soy sauce converts to roughly 4 cups helps streamline your prep. This is particularly useful when scaling recipes up or down, ensuring your dish turns out perfectly every time.</p>  

<h3>US vs UK Cup Measurements</h3>  
<p>It's worth noting that US and UK cup measurements differ slightly. A US cup is 240 ml, while a UK metric cup is 250 ml. For 935 ml of soy sauce, this means approximately 3.95 US cups or 3.74 UK cups. Most modern recipes, including those on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>our conversion chart</a>, use US measurements unless specified otherwise. Always check the recipe origin to avoid discrepancies.</p>  

<h2>How to Measure 935 ml of Soy Sauce Without a Measuring Cup</h2>  
<p>If you don't have a measuring cup handy, you can still measure 935 ml of soy sauce using common kitchen tools. A standard mug holds about 300–350 ml, so roughly 2.5 mugs would equal 935 ml. Alternatively, a large liquid measuring jug with millilitre markings is ideal for accuracy. For air fryer cooking, precision matters—especially when preparing sauces for <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>air-fried vegetables</a> or marinades.</p>  

<p>Another handy trick is using a tablespoon: 1 tablespoon equals 15 ml, so 935 ml is about 62 tablespoons. While this method is less practical for large quantities, it's useful for small adjustments. Remember, soy sauce is a potent ingredient, so even slight variations can impact your dish.

<p>0.5 cup of pumpkin seeds equals approximately 2.5 ounces (70 grams). This measurement is essential for air fryer recipes, ensuring your roasted pumpkin seeds turn out perfectly crispy every time. Whether you’re prepping a snack or adding them to a dish, knowing the exact weight helps with consistency. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we focus on precise conversions to make cooking effortless.</p>

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on even heat distribution, so using the right amount of ingredients ensures optimal results. Too many pumpkin seeds can overcrowd the basket, leading to uneven cooking. Too few might burn quickly. By converting 0.5 cup of pumpkin seeds to ounces, you avoid guesswork and achieve perfectly roasted seeds every time. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more handy measurements.</p>  

<p>Pumpkin seeds are a nutritious snack, packed with protein and healthy fats. When roasted in an air fryer, they become irresistibly crunchy. Measuring them correctly ensures you get the right portion size and cooking time. For more recipe ideas, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> section.</p>  

<h3>How to measure 0.5 cup of pumpkin seeds</h3>  
<p>Use a dry measuring cup for accuracy, filling it loosely without packing the seeds down. Level off the top with a straight edge for a precise 0.5 cup. If you don’t have a scale, remember that 0.5 cup of pumpkin seeds equals roughly 2.5 ounces. This conversion works for both US and UK measurements, making it easy to follow any recipe.</p>  

<h2>Best ways to roast pumpkin seeds in an air fryer</h2>  
<p>Once you’ve measured your 0.5 cup (2.5 oz) of pumpkin seeds, toss them with a bit of oil and salt. Preheat your air fryer to 160°C (320°F) and cook for 8–10 minutes, shaking the basket halfway. The result? Golden, crispy seeds ready to enjoy. For more snack inspiration, browse our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/snacks>snack recipes</a>.</p>  

<p>Roasted pumpkin seeds make a great topping for salads, soups, or even desserts. Their nutty flavour pairs well with spices like paprika or cinnamon. Since air fryers cook quickly, keeping an eye on the time ensures they don’t overcook.

<h3>Storing pumpkin seeds for later use</h3>  
<p>If you have leftover pumpkin seeds, store them in an airtight container at room temperature. They’ll stay fresh for up to two weeks. Measuring 0.5 cup (2.5 oz) portions beforehand helps with meal prep, so you always have a healthy snack on hand.

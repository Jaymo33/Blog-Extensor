Whether you’re cooking for one or meal prepping, accurate conversions like 40g minced garlic to ounces make life easier.</p>  

<h3>How to measure minced garlic accurately</h3>  
<p>Measuring minced garlic can be tricky due to its sticky texture. For 40g of minced garlic (1.41 oz), use a kitchen scale for the most precise results.

Remember, air fryer recipes often rely on exact measurements for even cooking, so accuracy is key.</p>

<p>0.66 cup of rolled barley equals approximately 3.5 ounces (oz). This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements ensure perfect texture and cooking times. Whether you're making granola, porridge, or baked goods, knowing the weight of rolled barley helps achieve consistent results.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Using the correct amount of rolled barley ensures even cooking and prevents dry or undercooked dishes. The air fryer's rapid circulation requires balanced ingredient ratios for optimal results. Too much barley can lead to clumping, while too little may dry out your recipe.

<p>Rolled barley is a versatile ingredient in air fryer recipes, from breakfast bowls to savoury bakes. Its weight affects cooking time, so measuring by ounces rather than volume improves accuracy. Explore <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>our recipe collection</a> for barley-inspired dishes.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure 0.66 Cup of Rolled Barley</h3>  
<p>For the most accurate 3.5-ounce measurement, use a kitchen scale. If you don’t have one, lightly spoon barley into a measuring cup without packing it down. Level off the top with a straight edge for consistency. This method works well for <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/breakfast>breakfast recipes</a> like air-fried granola clusters.</p>  

<h2>Converting Rolled Barley for Different Recipes</h2>  
<p>When adapting oven recipes for your air fryer, converting 0.66 cup of rolled barley to ounces ensures proper texture. Air fryers cook faster, so ingredient ratios matter more than in conventional baking. For example, 3.5 ounces of barley in energy bars will bind better than a volume measurement.</p>  

<p>Barley’s density can vary slightly between brands, so weighing eliminates guesswork. If you’re making <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>desserts</a>, precise ounces prevent overly dense or crumbly results. Always check your air fryer’s capacity before scaling recipes.</p>  

<h3>Common Uses for 0.66 Cup (3.5 oz) of Rolled Barley</h3>  
<p>This quantity is perfect for single-serving air fryer granola or coating for chicken. It also works well in stuffings or as a binder in veggie burgers. For easy cleaning after cooking barley-based dishes, try <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>our recommended cleaner</a>.</p>  

<h2>Tips for Cooking With Rolled Barley in an Air Fryer</h2>  
<p>Toast 3.5 ounces of barley at 160°C for 5 minutes to enhance its nutty flavour before adding to recipes. Stir halfway through for even browning. Soaking barley briefly reduces cooking time in dishes like air-fried pilafs.</p>  

<p>For <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable-based meals</a>, combine barley with roasted veggies in the air fryer basket. The 0.66 cup (3.5 oz) measurement creates balanced portions without overcrowding. Always preheat your air fryer for grain-based recipes.</p>

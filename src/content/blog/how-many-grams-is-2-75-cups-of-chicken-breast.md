<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on hot air circulation to cook food evenly, and incorrect measurements can lead to undercooked or dry results. For example, 2.75 cups of chicken breast in grams (330g) ensures you don’t overcrowd the basket, allowing proper airflow. Overloading can cause uneven cooking, while too little may dry out the meat.

<p>Chicken breast is a lean protein, and its weight can vary slightly based on how it’s chopped or shredded. For best results, use a kitchen scale to confirm 2.75 cups of chicken breast in grams before cooking. This small step guarantees your air fryer delivers juicy, perfectly cooked chicken every time.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure 2.75 Cups of Chicken Breast</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a scale, here’s a simple method: lightly pack diced or shredded chicken into a measuring cup until it reaches 2.75 cups. Avoid pressing down, as this compacts the meat and skews the weight. For shredded chicken, fluff it lightly with a fork before measuring. Need more chicken-based recipes?

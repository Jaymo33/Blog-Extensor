<p>5g of coconut oil equals approximately 0.18 ounces. This conversion is essential for precise cooking, especially when using an air fryer where measurements can impact texture and flavour. Whether you’re preparing a crispy dish or a moist cake, knowing how to convert grams to ounces ensures consistency in your recipes. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we focus on making cooking conversions simple and accessible for everyone.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air frying</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of coconut oil can make or break your air fryer recipe. Too little oil, and your food may turn out dry; too much, and it could become greasy. For example, 5g of coconut oil (0.18 ounces) is ideal for lightly coating vegetables or adding moisture to baked goods. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> helps you switch between units effortlessly, so you never have to guess.</p>  
<p>Many air fryer recipes, especially those for desserts or roasted vegetables, rely on precise oil measurements. Coconut oil is a popular choice due to its high smoke point and health benefits. Whether you’re making crispy sweet potato fries or a fluffy cake, converting 5g of coconut oil to ounces ensures your dish turns out perfectly every time.</p>  

<h2>How to measure 5g of coconut oil without scales</h2>  
<p>If you don’t have a kitchen scale, you can still measure 5g of coconut oil (0.18 ounces) using household items. One teaspoon of coconut oil weighs roughly 4.5g, so a slightly heaped teaspoon will give you close to 5g. For more accuracy, refer to our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe section</a>, where we provide detailed measurement tips for air fryer cooking.</p>  

<h3>Using coconut oil in air fryer recipes</h3>  
<p>Coconut oil works wonderfully in air fryers, especially for roasting vegetables or baking. Its mild flavour complements both sweet and savoury dishes. For instance, tossing Brussels sprouts in 5g of coconut oil (0.18 ounces) before air frying enhances their crispiness without overpowering their natural taste.

<h2>Common conversions for coconut oil</h2>  
<p>Beyond 5g, it’s helpful to know other common conversions for coconut oil in air fryer cooking. For example, 10g is approximately 0.35 ounces, while 15g equals 0.53 ounces. These conversions are handy when scaling recipes up or down. If you’re preparing a larger batch, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner guide</a> ensures your appliance stays in top condition after use.</p>  

<h3>Storing and melting coconut oil for air frying</h3>  
<p>Coconut oil solidifies at cooler temperatures, so you may need to melt it before measuring. To measure 5g (0.18 ounces) accurately, gently warm the oil until it’s liquid, then use a measuring spoon or scale. This step is crucial for recipes like air-fried chicken or tofu, where even coating ensures optimal crispiness.</p>

<p>1 tablespoon (tbsp) of chilli sauce weighs approximately 15 grams. This measurement is essential for air fryer recipes where precise ingredient quantities can make or break your dish. Whether you’re whipping up a spicy marinade or adding a kick to your air-fried chicken, knowing the exact grams in 1 tbsp of chilli sauce ensures consistent results every time.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on even heat distribution, and incorrect measurements can throw off cooking times and textures.

<h2>How to Measure Chilli Sauce Correctly</h2>  
<p>To measure 1 tbsp of chilli sauce in grams, use a digital kitchen scale for precision. Simply place your measuring spoon on the scale, tare it to zero, then add the sauce until it reaches 15 grams. This method eliminates inconsistencies caused by varying sauce thicknesses or spoon sizes.</p>  

<h3>Common Mistakes When Measuring Sauces</h3>  
<p>One mistake is using a heaped tablespoon, which can add extra grams and alter your recipe’s flavour. Another is assuming all sauces weigh the same—thicker sauces like sriracha may differ slightly from runnier varieties. Always measure by weight for accuracy, especially when following air fryer recipes.</p>  

<h2>Converting Other Sauce Measurements to Grams</h2>  
<p>If your recipe calls for larger quantities, here’s a quick guide: 2 tbsp of chilli sauce equals 30 grams, while ¼ cup (4 tbsp) is roughly 60 grams. These conversions are handy for batch cooking or meal prep.

<h3>Adjusting Recipes for Personal Taste</h3>  
<p>While 15 grams per tablespoon is standard, you can tweak the amount to suit your spice preference. Just remember that altering the sauce quantity may affect cooking times. For example, extra chilli sauce might require a minute less in the air fryer to prevent burning.</p>  

<h2>Frequently Asked Questions About Sauce Measurements</h2>  
<p>Many home cooks wonder if bottled chilli sauce brands vary in weight. Most mainstream brands, like Encona or Sriracha, will be close to 15 grams per tablespoon, but artisanal sauces with chunkier textures might differ slightly. When in doubt, weigh your sauce for the best results.</p>  

<p>Another common query is whether to measure sauces before or after heating. For accuracy, always measure chilli sauce at room temperature, as heating can change its density. This tip is especially useful for sticky sauces used in glazes or marinades.

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>
<p>Precision is key when using an air fryer, as ingredients cook faster and more intensely than in conventional ovens. Using the right amount of agave syrup—whether 25g or 0.88 ounces—can make or break a recipe. Too much syrup can cause burning, while too little might leave dishes lacking flavour. Many of our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> rely on exact measurements for perfect results. This is especially true for baked goods and glazes where consistency matters.</p>
<p>Agave syrup is a popular sweetener in air fryer cooking due to its mild flavour and easy pouring consistency. Whether you're making cookies, cakes, or glazes, knowing that 25g equals 0.88 ounces helps maintain recipe integrity. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert recipes</a> often feature this versatile ingredient. Remember, accurate measurements lead to consistent cooking times and temperatures in your air fryer.</p>

<h2>How to measure 25g of agave syrup without scales</h2>
<p>If you don't have digital scales, you can still measure 25g (0.88 ounces) of agave syrup using tablespoons.

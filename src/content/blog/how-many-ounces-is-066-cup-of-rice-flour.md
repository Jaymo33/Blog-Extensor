<p>0.66 cup of rice flour equals approximately 3.17 ounces (oz). This conversion is essential for precise baking and cooking, especially when using an air fryer where measurements can impact texture and consistency.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>When using an air fryer, precise measurements ensure even cooking and perfect results. Too much or too little rice flour can affect the crispiness or density of your dish. For example, if you’re making air-fried tempura or gluten-free breading, 0.66 cup of rice flour (3.17 oz) is a common measurement for small batches.</p>  

<p>Rice flour is a popular choice for air fryer recipes because it’s gluten-free and creates a light, crispy coating. Whether you’re making <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer onion rings</a> or coating chicken, knowing how many ounces are in 0.66 cup helps maintain consistency. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more handy measurements.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure Rice Flour Correctly</h3>  
<p>To ensure accuracy, spoon rice flour into a measuring cup and level it off with a knife. Scooping directly from the bag can compact the flour, leading to incorrect measurements. If you’re converting 0.66 cup of rice flour to ounces, a digital kitchen scale is the most reliable tool.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for 0.66 Cup of Rice Flour in Air Fryers</h2>  
<p>This measurement is ideal for small-batch recipes, such as coating for <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>air fryer chicken tenders</a> or making gluten-free dough. Since air fryers cook food quickly, using the right amount of rice flour ensures even browning without sogginess.</p>  

<p>If you’re experimenting with <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>air fryer desserts</a>, 0.66 cup (3.17 oz) of rice flour works well for small cakes or cookies. Always preheat your air fryer and lightly grease the basket for best results. For more tips, visit <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>.</p>  

<h3>Converting Other Rice Flour Measurements</h3>  
<p>If your recipe calls for a different amount, remember that 1 cup of rice flour equals roughly 4.8 ounces. This makes 0.66 cup of rice flour to oz a handy reference for scaling recipes up or down. A <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>clean air fryer basket</a> also ensures even heat distribution for perfect results every time.</p>

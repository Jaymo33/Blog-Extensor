<p>10 grams of tomato paste equals approximately 0.35 ounces. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements can make or break a dish. Whether you’re whipping up a quick pasta sauce or marinating chicken, knowing the exact weight ensures consistency. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we focus on making cooking conversions effortless so you can focus on flavour.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on even cooking, and incorrect ingredient quantities can lead to dry or undercooked results. Tomato paste, often used in small amounts, is a key ingredient in many recipes. Measuring 10g of tomato paste correctly (0.35 oz) ensures your sauces and marinades have the right consistency. For more conversion tips, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>  

<p>Tomato paste adds depth to dishes like air-fried meatballs or vegetable stews. Using too much can overpower the dish, while too little might leave it bland. Whether you’re following a British or international recipe, converting 10g of tomato paste to ounces guarantees accuracy. Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a> for inspiration.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure 10g of Tomato Paste Without Scales</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a kitchen scale, a tablespoon can help. One level tablespoon of tomato paste is roughly 15g, so two-thirds of a tablespoon equals 10g (0.35 oz). For sticky ingredients like tomato paste, lightly oil the spoon for easier measurement. This trick works well for air fryer recipes requiring small quantities.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for 10g of Tomato Paste in Air Fryer Recipes</h2>  
<p>Tomato paste is a versatile ingredient, especially in air fryer cooking. A 10g portion (0.35 oz) is perfect for adding richness to mini pizzas, kebabs, or stuffed peppers. Its concentrated flavour means a little goes a long way. For more ideas, browse our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipes</a> featuring tomato-based marinades.</p>  

<p>Another great use is in air-fried meatloaf or burger patties, where 10g of tomato paste binds ingredients while adding moisture. You can also mix it with herbs and oil for a quick glaze. Visit <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> for creative ways to use tomato paste in your air fryer meals.</p>  

<h3>Storing Leftover Tomato Paste</h3>  
<p>After measuring 10g (0.35 oz), store the rest in an airtight container in the fridge for up to a week. Alternatively, freeze teaspoon-sized portions for future use. This prevents waste and ensures you always have tomato paste ready for your next air fryer adventure.</p>

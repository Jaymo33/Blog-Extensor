<p>1.5 cups of pesto equals approximately 12 ounces. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes, ensuring precise measurements for the best results. Whether you're making pesto chicken or a pasta bake, knowing the exact weight helps maintain consistency. For more air fryer tips, check out <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Using the correct amount of pesto ensures your dish isn’t too dry or overly saucy. Air fryers cook food quickly, so precise measurements prevent burning or undercooking. Pesto, with its rich blend of basil, garlic, and oil, needs careful portioning. Too much can make dishes greasy, while too little may lack flavour. For more recipe ideas, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipes section</a>.</p>  

<p>Converting cups to ounces is especially useful for UK cooks, as many recipes use metric measurements. A standard cup holds 8 ounces, but pesto’s density means 1.5 cups weigh slightly more. This small difference can impact your cooking, so accuracy is key. If you’re unsure, a kitchen scale is a handy tool. Find more conversion tips on our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure Pesto for Air Fryer Recipes</h3>  
<p>For best results, use a liquid measuring cup for pesto. Scoop the pesto into the cup and level it off with a spatula. If you don’t have a measuring cup, a kitchen scale set to ounces works perfectly. Remember, 1.5 cups of pesto equals 12 ounces, making it easy to adjust recipes. Need inspiration?

<h2>Common Uses for 1.5 Cups of Pesto in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Pesto is incredibly versatile in the air fryer. Use 1.5 cups (12 ounces) to coat chicken breasts, drizzle over roasted vegetables, or mix into pasta bakes. The intense heat of the air fryer locks in flavours, making pesto dishes taste even better. For a quick meal, toss pesto with shrimp and air fry for 8 minutes. Discover more ideas in our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/shrimp>shrimp recipes</a>.</p>  

<p>Another great option is pesto-stuffed mushrooms. Combine 1.5 cups of pesto with breadcrumbs and cheese, then stuff into mushroom caps. Air fry until golden for a delicious appetiser. Pesto also works wonders as a marinade or dipping sauce. Keep your air fryer clean with our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning guide</a> to maintain peak performance.</p>  

<h3>Tips for Storing Leftover Pesto</h3>  
<p>If you have leftover pesto, store it in an airtight container in the fridge for up to a week. You can also freeze pesto in ice cube trays for easy portioning. When ready to use, simply thaw and add to your air fryer dishes. This saves time and reduces waste, making meal prep a breeze.</p>

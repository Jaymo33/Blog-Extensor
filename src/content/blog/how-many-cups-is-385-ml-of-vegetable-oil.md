<p>385 ml of vegetable oil equals approximately 1.63 cups in the US or 1.54 cups in the UK. Whether you're baking or using your air fryer, getting measurements right is key to perfect results. This guide will help you convert 385 ml of vegetable oil to cups accurately, no matter where you are.</p>

<h2>Understanding the Conversion</h2>
<p>Converting millilitres to cups can be tricky, especially since US and UK cup measurements differ. For 385 ml of vegetable oil, the US standard cup (240 ml) gives you roughly 1.63 cups. The UK cup (250 ml) comes out to about 1.54 cups. This small difference matters in recipes, particularly for air frying where precision affects texture and cooking time.</p>
<p>When using your air fryer, accurate oil measurements ensure even cooking and prevent soggy or overly dry results. Too much oil can lead to smoke, while too little might leave food sticking. For perfect air fryer recipes, always measure carefully and check whether your recipe uses US or UK measurements.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter</h2>
<p>Getting the right amount of vegetable oil is crucial for both taste and texture. In baking, too much oil can make cakes greasy, while too little can dry them out. For air frying, the right oil quantity ensures crispy, golden results without excess smoke or sticking. That's why knowing how to convert 385 ml of vegetable oil to cups is so helpful.</p>
<p>Many <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> call for specific oil amounts to achieve the best results. Whether you're making crispy chips or juicy chicken, measuring oil correctly makes all the difference. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> can help with other common measurements too.</p>

<h3>US vs UK Cup Measurements</h3>
<p>The difference between US and UK cups might seem small, but it can affect your cooking. A US cup holds 240 ml, while a UK cup holds 250 ml. For 385 ml of vegetable oil, that means 1.63 US cups versus 1.54 UK cups. Always check which measurement system your recipe uses, especially when trying new dishes in your air fryer.</p>

<h2>Tips for Measuring Vegetable Oil</h2>
<p>Measuring oil accurately doesn't have to be complicated. Use a clear liquid measuring cup for best results, and check at eye level. Pour slowly to avoid spills, and remember that 385 ml of vegetable oil is just over 1.5 cups in most cases. For sticky ingredients, lightly grease your measuring cup first to help the oil slide out easily.</p>
<p>If you're adapting recipes for your air fryer, consider reducing oil slightly since air fryers need less than traditional frying methods. Many <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipes</a> work beautifully with just a light coating of oil in the air fryer. The same goes for <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable dishes</a>, where a little oil goes a long way.</p>

<h3>Converting Other Amounts</h3>
<p>Once you've mastered converting 385 ml of vegetable oil to cups, you can apply the same principles to other quantities. Remember that 100 ml equals about 0.42 US cups or 0.4 UK cups. Keeping these ratios in mind makes recipe adjustments simple, whether you're scaling up or down for your air fryer meals.</p>

<p>1.5 cups of gram flour equals approximately 6.35 ounces (180 grams). This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes, where precise measurements can make or break your dish. Whether you're making crispy pakoras or fluffy besan ladoo, knowing the exact weight ensures consistency. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we emphasise accuracy to help you achieve perfect results every time.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on even heat distribution, and incorrect measurements can lead to uneven cooking or texture issues. For example, too much gram flour in a batter can make it dense, while too little may cause it to fall apart. Using 1.5 cups of gram flour (6.35 ounces) ensures your recipes turn out just right. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more handy measurement tips.</p>  

<p>Gram flour, also known as besan, is a staple in many air fryer recipes, from savoury snacks to gluten-free baking. Its unique properties require careful measuring, especially when scaling recipes up or down. Whether you're following a recipe from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>our collection</a> or experimenting, precise conversions are key.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure 1.5 Cups of Gram Flour Correctly</h3>  
<p>For the most accurate results, use a kitchen scale to weigh 6.35 ounces (180 grams) of gram flour. If you don’t have one, spoon the flour into a measuring cup and level it off with a knife. Avoid packing the flour down, as this can lead to over-measuring. This method ensures your 1.5 cups of gram flour to ounces conversion is spot-on.</p>

<p>Brown sugar is slightly denser than white sugar, so weight matters more than volume.

This is especially important for air fryer recipes, where even small imbalances can affect crispiness or caramelisation.</p>

<h3>Does brown sugar type affect the weight?</h3>  
<p>Light and dark brown sugar have almost identical weights, so 10g of either will still be 0.35 ounces. However, moist, fresh brown sugar packs more tightly than older, dried-out sugar. If your sugar has hardened, break it up before measuring for accuracy in air fryer recipes.</p>

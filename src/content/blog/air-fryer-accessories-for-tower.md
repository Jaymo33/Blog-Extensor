<p id="">If you own a Tower air fryer, investing in the right air fryer accessories for Tower models can significantly enhance your cooking experience. Essential add-ons like air fryer liners for Tower make cleanup effortless while protecting your basket. Let’s explore how these accessories can upgrade your kitchen game.</p><h2 id="">Must-have Tower air fryer accessories</h2><p id="">Every Tower air fryer owner should consider these practical additions. Silicone liners prevent food from sticking to the basket, making them one of the most useful air fryer accessories for Tower appliances. The Tower silicone air fryer liner is particularly popular as it’s reusable and heat-resistant up to 230°C. Pair these with a good set of tongs and you’ll find flipping foods like the crispy chicken from our <a href="https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken" id="">chicken recipes collection</a> becomes much easier.</p><p id="">Another game-changer is the multi-level rack system, perfect for cooking different foods simultaneously. Imagine preparing salmon from our <a href="https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/salmon" id="">salmon recipes</a> on one level while roasting vegetables below. For Tower Vizion owners, the Tower Vizion air fryer accessories range includes specially designed racks that fit perfectly in your model’s basket.</p><h3 id="">Silicone liners: Your cleanup saviour</h3><p id="">The Tower silicone air fryer liner deserves special attention. These flexible mats catch drips and prevent stubborn stains, meaning less scrubbing after cooking messy foods. They’re particularly handy for sticky marinades or when trying new recipes from <a href="https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes" id="">our recipe hub</a>. Most liners are dishwasher safe, making them incredibly convenient for busy cooks.</p><h2 id="">Expanding your cooking possibilities</h2><p id="">Beyond basic liners, several accessories can transform what you can cook. A pizza pan designed for Tower models lets you create perfect crispy bases, while a baking tin enables you to make everything from brownies to frittatas. For seafood lovers, the right accessories mean perfect shrimp every time – check our <a href="https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/shrimp" id="">shrimp recipes</a> for inspiration.</p><p id="">Don’t overlook smaller items like grill mats or skewer sets. These allow for more creative cooking, especially when preparing vegetable dishes from our <a href="https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables" id="">vegetable recipes section</a>. The right accessories mean your Tower air fryer becomes far more than just a fryer – it’s a complete compact oven.</p><h3 id="">Cleaning and maintenance essentials</h3><p id="">Keeping your Tower air fryer in top condition requires proper care. Invest in a soft-bristle brush specifically designed for air fryer baskets. Combined with our recommended <a href="https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner" id="">air fryer cleaner</a>, these tools make maintenance simple. Regular cleaning ensures your accessories like the Tower silicone air fryer liner last longer and perform better.</p><h2 id="">Choosing the right accessories for your model</h2><p id="">Not all air fryer accessories for Tower models fit every variant. The Tower Vizion air fryer accessories are specifically shaped for that model’s unique basket dimensions. Always check compatibility before purchasing, especially for items like silicone liners or racks. The right fit ensures even cooking and prevents any safety issues.</p><p id="">For temperature-sensitive cooking, consider pairing your accessories with our handy <a href="https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart" id="">air fryer conversion chart</a>.

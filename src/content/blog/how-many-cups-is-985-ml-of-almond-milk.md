Whether you're whipping up a cake or a creamy sauce, knowing how to convert millilitres to cups ensures your dish turns out perfectly every time.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of almond milk can make or break a recipe. Too much liquid can lead to soggy cakes or runny sauces, while too little might dry out your dish.

<p>Almond milk is a popular dairy-free alternative, but its consistency can vary between brands.

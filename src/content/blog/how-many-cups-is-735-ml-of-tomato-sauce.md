<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter</h2>
<p>Accurate measurements are crucial in cooking, especially when using an air fryer. Too much or too little tomato sauce can affect the texture and flavour of your dish. For example, 735 ml of tomato sauce in cups should be measured carefully to avoid a soggy or dry outcome. Air fryers cook food quickly, so imbalances in ingredients can be more noticeable.

Whether you're cooking for one or a family, precision ensures everyone enjoys the meal.</p>

<h2>US vs UK Cup Measurements</h2>
<p>It's important to note that US and UK cup measurements differ slightly. In the US, 1 cup equals 240 ml, while in the UK, it's 250 ml. This means 735 ml of tomato sauce converts to 3.1 US cups or 3.3 UK cups. For air fryer recipes, this small difference can impact the final dish, especially in baked goods or sauces. Always check which measurement system your recipe uses.</p>

<h3>How to Measure 735 ml of Tomato Sauce</h3>
<p>To measure 735 ml of tomato sauce accurately, use a liquid measuring jug with clear markings. Pour the sauce slowly to the 735 ml line, checking at eye level for precision. If you don't have a jug, use standard measuring cups: 3 US cups plus 2 tablespoons will give you roughly 735 ml. For UK cups, 3 cups plus 1 tablespoon is close enough. Avoid guessing, as it can lead to inconsistent results.</p>

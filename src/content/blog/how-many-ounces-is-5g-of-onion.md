<p>If you’re exploring <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a>, precise measurements can make all the difference. Onions are a staple in many dishes, from stir-fries to casseroles, and getting the amount right ensures balanced flavours.

<h2>How to Measure 5g of Onion</h2>  
<p>Measuring 5g of onion is simple with a digital kitchen scale. If your scale displays ounces, it should show 0.18 oz for 5g. For those without scales, a rough estimate is about one teaspoon of finely diced onion. Remember, onion density can vary, so a scale is best for accuracy.</p>  
<p>When prepping for <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable-based air fryer dishes</a>, consistency matters. Whether you’re making onion bhajis or adding onions to a roast, 5g (0.18 oz) is a small but impactful quantity.

<h3>Common Uses for 5g of Onion</h3>  
<p>5g of onion might seem small, but it’s perfect for garnishing or adding subtle flavour. Think sprinkling over air-fried potatoes or mixing into a marinade. For larger quantities, simply multiply the conversion—e.g., 10g of onion equals 0.35 oz.</p>  

<h2>Tips for Cooking with Onions in an Air Fryer</h2>  
<p>Onions cook quickly in an air fryer, so keep an eye on them. At 180°C, diced onions take about 3-5 minutes to soften. For caramelised onions, cook longer at a lower temperature. Always measure your 5g (0.18 oz) accurately to avoid overpowering other ingredients.</p>

<p>5 grams of onion equals approximately 0.18 ounces. This conversion is handy when following air fryer recipes that require precise measurements. Whether you're making crispy onion rings or adding diced onions to a dish, knowing how to convert 5g of onion to ounces ensures your cooking is spot-on.</p>

<h2>Why Convert 5g of Onion to Ounces?</h2>  
<p>Many UK recipes, especially those for air fryers, use grams for accuracy. However, some cooks prefer ounces for convenience. Converting 5g of onion to ounces (0.18 oz) helps bridge this gap. It’s particularly useful when scaling recipes or using kitchen scales that display ounces.</p>  
<p>If you’re exploring <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a>, precise measurements can make all the difference. Onions are a staple in many dishes, from stir-fries to casseroles, and getting the amount right ensures balanced flavours. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> can help with other common conversions too.</p>  

<h2>How to Measure 5g of Onion</h2>  
<p>Measuring 5g of onion is simple with a digital kitchen scale. If your scale displays ounces, it should show 0.18 oz for 5g. For those without scales, a rough estimate is about one teaspoon of finely diced onion. Remember, onion density can vary, so a scale is best for accuracy.</p>  
<p>When prepping for <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable-based air fryer dishes</a>, consistency matters. Whether you’re making onion bhajis or adding onions to a roast, 5g (0.18 oz) is a small but impactful quantity. Keep your <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer clean</a> to avoid lingering onion smells between uses.</p>  

<h3>Common Uses for 5g of Onion</h3>  
<p>5g of onion might seem small, but it’s perfect for garnishing or adding subtle flavour. Think sprinkling over air-fried potatoes or mixing into a marinade. For larger quantities, simply multiply the conversion—e.g., 10g of onion equals 0.35 oz.</p>  

<h2>Tips for Cooking with Onions in an Air Fryer</h2>  
<p>Onions cook quickly in an air fryer, so keep an eye on them. At 180°C, diced onions take about 3-5 minutes to soften. For caramelised onions, cook longer at a lower temperature. Always measure your 5g (0.18 oz) accurately to avoid overpowering other ingredients.</p>  
<p>Pair onions with other <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/potatoes>potato-based air fryer recipes</a> for a hearty meal. From hash browns to loaded wedges, a touch of onion elevates the dish. Need more inspiration? Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>homepage</a> for endless ideas.</p>  

<h3>Scaling Up the Conversion</h3>  
<p>If your recipe calls for more onion, here’s a quick reference: 10g = 0.35 oz, 20g = 0.7 oz, and 50g = 1.76 oz. This makes it easy to adjust measurements without recalculating each time.</p>

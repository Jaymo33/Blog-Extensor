<p>0.75 cup of pesto equals 6 ounces, making it easy to measure for air fryer recipes. Whether you're whipping up a quick pasta dish or coating chicken, precise measurements ensure perfect results every time.

<h2>Why accurate pesto measurements matter</h2>  
<p>Getting the right amount of pesto ensures your dishes aren’t too dry or overly greasy.

<p>Pesto’s density can vary slightly depending on ingredients, but 0.75 cup reliably converts to 6 ounces.

<h2>Common uses for 0.75 cup of pesto</h2>

<p>3 tablespoons of self-raising flour weigh approximately 24 grams in UK measurements. This conversion is essential for air fryer baking, where precision ensures perfect results every time. Whether you're whipping up cakes, muffins, or savoury bakes in your air fryer, knowing exact weights helps avoid dense or uneven textures. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we emphasise accuracy for foolproof recipes. Let’s dive deeper into conversions and tips for measuring self-raising flour.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Flour Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Using the correct weight for 3 tbsp of self-raising flour ensures your baked goods rise properly. Too much flour can make cakes heavy, while too little may cause them to collapse. Air fryers circulate hot air rapidly, so precise measurements are even more critical than in conventional ovens. For consistent results, we recommend using digital scales over volume measurements. Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for other common ingredient swaps.</p>  

<p>Self-raising flour contains baking powder, so its density differs slightly from plain flour. Spooning flour lightly into a tablespoon (not packing it down) gives the most accurate 24-gram measurement. If you’re adapting a recipe from cups to grams, check our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> section for tested conversions. A small discrepancy can affect texture, especially in compact air fryer baskets.</p>  

<h3>Tools for Measuring Self-Raising Flour</h3>  
<p>Digital kitchen scales are the gold standard for converting 3 tbsp of self-raising flour to grams. If you don’t have scales, use the spoon-and-level method: gently spoon flour into the tablespoon, then level it off with a knife. Avoid tapping the spoon, as this compacts the flour. For larger batches, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>cake recipes</a> include gram measurements to simplify scaling up.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for 3 Tbsp of Self-Raising Flour</h2>  
<p>This small quantity is perfect for single-serving air fryer bakes, like mug cakes or mini scones. Combined with 1 tbsp sugar and 2 tbsp milk, it makes a quick 5-minute cake. Self-raising flour’s leavening properties mean no additional baking powder is needed.

<p>0.125 cup of caster sugar equals approximately 1 ounce (0.99 oz to be precise). Whether you're baking in an air fryer or a conventional oven, getting your measurements right is key to perfect results. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we know how important accuracy is, especially when whipping up desserts or sweet treats in your air fryer.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate sugar measurements matter</h2>  
<p>Using the correct amount of caster sugar ensures your baked goods have the right texture and sweetness. Too much sugar can make cakes overly moist or cause cookies to spread too thin. Too little, and your desserts might turn out dry or bland. If you're using an air fryer, precise measurements are even more critical due to its faster cooking times.</p>  

<p>For air fryer recipes, especially those from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>our collection</a>, getting the sugar ratio right helps avoid burnt edges or undercooked centres. Whether you're making air-fried donuts or a quick sponge, 0.125 cup of caster sugar (about 1 ounce) is a common measurement for small-batch baking.</p>  

<h3>How to measure 0.125 cup of caster sugar</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a 0.125 cup measure, you can use tablespoons instead. Since 1 cup equals 16 tablespoons, 0.125 cup is the same as 2 tablespoons. For even more precision, a digital kitchen scale will give you the exact ounce measurement—just set it to 0.99 oz for 0.125 cup of caster sugar.</p>  

<h2>Converting caster sugar for UK bakers</h2>  
<p>In the UK, caster sugar is finer than granulated sugar but coarser than icing sugar. This makes it ideal for air fryer baking, as it dissolves quickly. If you're following a US recipe, remember that UK cups and US cups differ slightly. Always check <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>our conversion chart</a> for accurate measurements.</p>  

<p>When converting 0.125 cup of caster sugar to ounces, UK bakers should note that 1 UK cup is roughly 10 oz, meaning 0.125 cup equals about 1.25 oz. However, for most practical purposes, 1 ounce (0.99 oz) is close enough for air fryer recipes.</p>  

<h3>Common uses for 0.125 cup of caster sugar</h3>  
<p>This small amount of sugar is perfect for single-serving desserts or adjusting sweetness in air fryer recipes. Try it in mini cakes, mug brownies, or a small batch of cookies. For more inspiration, browse our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert category</a>.</p>  

<h2>Tips for measuring sugar in an air fryer</h2>  
<p>Since air fryers cook faster than ovens, sugar measurements need to be spot-on to avoid over-browning. Use a flat measuring spoon for dry ingredients, and level it off with a knife. If scaling up a recipe, check our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion guide</a> to adjust sugar quantities correctly.</p>  

<p>For sticky caster sugar, lightly grease your measuring spoon or cup to help it slide out easily. And if you're experimenting with sugar substitutes, remember that alternatives like erythritol or stevia may require different amounts—always check the packaging.</p>

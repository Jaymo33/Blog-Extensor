<p>2.25 cups of cocoa powder equals approximately 225 grams. This conversion is essential for baking accuracy, especially when using an air fryer, where precise measurements can make or break your recipe. Whether you're making brownies, cakes, or chocolate desserts, knowing the exact weight ensures consistency and perfect results every time.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Baking is a science, and even small deviations in ingredient quantities can affect texture and taste. Cocoa powder, in particular, can vary in density depending on how it's packed. Measuring by weight (grams) rather than volume (cups) eliminates guesswork. If you're using an air fryer for baking, precise measurements are even more critical due to the appliance's rapid cooking method.

<p>Many UK and US recipes use cups, but grams are the gold standard for accuracy. A kitchen scale is a must-have tool for serious bakers. If you're experimenting with air fryer recipes from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, converting cups to grams will help you achieve bakery-quality results at home.</p>  

<h2>How to Measure Cocoa Powder Correctly</h2>  
<p>To measure 2.25 cups of cocoa powder accurately, fluff the powder first with a spoon to aerate it. Then, lightly spoon it into a measuring cup without packing it down. Level off the top with a straight edge for consistency. For the most precise results, use a digital scale set to grams.</p>  

<h3>US vs. UK Cup Measurements</h3>  
<p>While 2.25 cups of cocoa powder is roughly 225 grams in both US and UK measurements, slight variations can occur due to cup size differences. US cups are 240ml, whereas UK cups are 250ml. For air fryer recipes, sticking to weight measurements eliminates any confusion between regional standards.</p>

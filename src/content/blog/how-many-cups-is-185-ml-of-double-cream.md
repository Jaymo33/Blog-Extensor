<p>185 ml of double cream is approximately 0.78 cups. This conversion is essential for baking and cooking, especially when using an air fryer for recipes that require precise measurements. Whether you're whipping up a dessert or adding richness to a savoury dish, knowing how to convert millilitres to cups ensures consistent results every time.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter</h2>
<p>When working with double cream, even small measurement errors can affect the texture and taste of your dish. Too much cream can make a sauce overly rich, while too little might leave it lacking in flavour. For air fryer recipes, precise measurements help achieve the perfect consistency, whether you're making a creamy pasta bake or a luscious dessert.

<p>Double cream is thicker and richer than single cream, so its volume-to-weight ratio differs slightly. This means 185 ml of double cream won’t weigh the same as 185 ml of milk or water. Always use a measuring jug or kitchen scales for the best results, especially when adapting recipes for your air fryer.</p>

<h2>How to Measure 185 ml of Double Cream</h2>
<p>To measure 185 ml of double cream accurately, use a liquid measuring cup with millilitre markings. Fill it to the 185 ml line, ensuring the cream sits level for an exact measurement. If you don’t have a measuring cup, a standard metric measuring jug will work just as well.

<h3>Using Kitchen Scales</h3>
<p>If you prefer using scales, 185 ml of double cream weighs roughly 185 grams, as its density is close to 1 g/ml. This method is particularly handy for baking, where precision is key. Simply place your bowl on the scales, tare to zero, and pour the cream until you hit 185 grams.</p>

<h2>Converting 185 ml of Double Cream in Different Cup Sizes</h2>
<p>In the UK, a standard cup measures 250 ml, so 185 ml is just under 0.74 UK cups. In the US, where a cup is 240 ml, 185 ml converts to roughly 0.77 US cups. These small differences might not seem significant, but they can impact recipes, especially in baking.

<h3>Adjusting Recipes for Your Air Fryer</h3>

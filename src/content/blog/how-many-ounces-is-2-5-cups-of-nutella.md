<p>2.5 cups of Nutella equals approximately 20 ounces. This conversion is essential for anyone using Nutella in recipes, especially when preparing air fryer desserts or baked goods. Whether you're whipping up a batch of cookies or a decadent cake, knowing the exact weight ensures consistency and perfect results every time.</p>

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter</h2>
<p>Using the correct amount of Nutella is crucial for achieving the right texture and flavour in your dishes. Too much or too little can throw off the balance of your recipe. For air fryer recipes, precise measurements help ensure even cooking and prevent messes. If you're new to air frying, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more handy tips.</p>
<p>Nutella's rich, creamy texture means it can be tricky to measure by volume alone. That's why converting cups to ounces is so helpful. Whether you're making a Nutella-filled pastry or a chocolate spread for toast, knowing the weight takes the guesswork out of your cooking.</p>

<h2>How to measure Nutella accurately</h2>
<p>Measuring Nutella by weight is more reliable than using cups, as it accounts for variations in density. A kitchen scale is your best friend here. Simply tare your bowl, then scoop in Nutella until you hit 20 ounces for 2.5 cups. No scales? Use the displacement method: fill a measuring jug with water, add Nutella until the water rises by 2.5 cups, then weigh the Nutella.</p>

<h3>Converting other Nutella measurements</h3>
<p>If your recipe calls for a different amount of Nutella, here are some common conversions: 1 cup of Nutella is roughly 8 ounces, while half a cup equals 4 ounces. For smaller quantities, 1 tablespoon is about 0.5 ounces. These conversions work for both UK and US measurements, so you can follow any recipe with confidence.</p>

<h2>Using Nutella in air fryer recipes</h2>
<p>Nutella works brilliantly in air fryer recipes, from stuffed French toast to molten chocolate cakes. Its high sugar content means it caramelises beautifully under the air fryer's intense heat. For inspiration, browse our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> collection, featuring plenty of chocolatey treats.</p>
<p>When using Nutella in your air fryer, remember it can drip and cause smoking. Always use parchment liners or silicone moulds to contain the spread. After cooking, clean your air fryer promptly with our recommended <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning products</a> to prevent sticky residues building up.</p>

<h3>Storing leftover Nutella</h3>
<p>Once opened, Nutella keeps for about 2 months at room temperature. Store it in a cool, dark place with the lid tightly sealed. If your Nutella separates, give it a good stir before using. For longer storage, you can refrigerate it, though this will make it harder to spread.</p>

<h2>Nutella recipe ideas</h2>
<p>Beyond spreading on toast, Nutella shines in countless desserts. Try swirling it into brownie batter before air frying, or use it as a dip for churros. It also makes a fantastic filling for crepes or stuffed pancakes. For more ideas, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert recipes</a> section.</p>
<p>When baking with Nutella, remember it contains sugar and oil which can affect your recipe's moisture content. You may need to adjust other ingredients slightly. Always taste as you go, especially when using Nutella as a frosting or filling.</p>

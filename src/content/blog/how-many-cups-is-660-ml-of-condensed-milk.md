<p>660 ml of condensed milk is approximately 2.8 cups. This conversion is essential for baking and cooking, especially when using an air fryer where precise measurements can make or break a recipe. Whether you're making a creamy dessert or a savoury dish, knowing how to convert ml to cups ensures consistency. For more air fryer conversions, visit <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>our conversion chart</a>.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter</h2>
<p>Condensed milk is a staple in many recipes, from cakes to custards, and its thickness means even small measurement errors can affect the outcome. In an air fryer, where cooking times are shorter, precision is even more critical. Too much condensed milk can make a dish overly sweet or soggy, while too little can leave it dry. For perfect results every time, always measure carefully. Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> for inspiration.</p>

<p>Using the right tools, like a liquid measuring cup or kitchen scale, ensures accuracy. If you don’t have a measuring cup, remember that 660 ml of condensed milk is roughly 2.8 cups. This conversion is based on the standard US cup measurement, which is 240 ml per cup. For UK bakers, the difference is minimal but worth noting for precision. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert recipes</a> for ideas using condensed milk.</p>

<h2>How to Measure Condensed Milk Without a Cup</h2>
<p>If you don’t have a measuring cup, you can still measure 660 ml of condensed milk using other methods. A kitchen scale is the most accurate alternative, as 660 ml weighs about 800 grams. Alternatively, use tablespoons—660 ml is roughly 44 tablespoons. This method is less precise but works in a pinch. For more tips on measuring ingredients, visit <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>.</p>

<h3>Converting ml to Cups for Other Ingredients</h3>
<p>While this guide focuses on condensed milk, the same principles apply to other liquids. For example, 660 ml of water or milk also equals 2.8 cups. However, thicker liquids like syrup or honey may vary slightly due to density. Always double-check conversions for accuracy, especially when adapting recipes for your air fryer. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning guide</a> ensures your air fryer stays in top condition for precise cooking.</p>

<h2>Common Uses for 660 ml of Condensed Milk</h2>
<p>660 ml of condensed milk is a common measurement in many recipes, particularly desserts. It’s enough for a large batch of fudge, a creamy cheesecake, or a rich caramel sauce. In the air fryer, condensed milk can be used for quick desserts like banoffee pie or sticky toffee pudding. The key is to measure accurately to avoid overpowering sweetness or texture issues.</p>

<p>For savoury dishes, condensed milk adds a touch of creaminess to sauces or glazes. Try it in a marinade for chicken or as a base for a dipping sauce. The versatility of condensed milk makes it a must-have in any kitchen, especially for air fryer enthusiasts. Discover more creative uses in our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>cake recipes</a>.</p>

<h3>Storing Leftover Condensed Milk</h3>
<p>If you have leftover condensed milk after measuring out 660 ml, store it properly to maintain freshness. Transfer it to an airtight container and refrigerate for up to two weeks. You can also freeze it for longer storage, though the texture may change slightly. Thaw frozen condensed milk in the fridge before using it in your next air fryer creation.</p>

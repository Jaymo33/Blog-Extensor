For example, a honey-glazed salmon or a batch of air-fried cookies relies on the perfect ratio of ingredients.

<h2>Converting 0.5 Cups of Honey to Grams</h2>
<p>The conversion from cups to grams is straightforward once you know honey’s density. One cup of honey typically weighs around 340 grams, so halving that gives you 170 grams for 0.5 cups. This measurement applies to most honey varieties, including clover, wildflower, and manuka. If you’re working with a particularly thick or runny honey, a kitchen scale is your best friend for precision.</p>

<p>For those who love baking, this conversion is a game-changer. Imagine making a batch of honey cakes or muffins in your air fryer—knowing the exact gram measurement ensures perfect results every time.

<h3>How Temperature Affects Honey Measurements</h3>
<p>Honey’s viscosity changes with temperature, which can slightly alter its volume-to-weight ratio. Cold honey is thicker and may pack more densely into a cup, while warm honey pours more easily and takes up less space. For the most accurate 0.5 cups of honey in grams, measure at room temperature. If your honey has crystallised, gently warm it before measuring to ensure consistency.</p>

<h2>Common Uses for 0.5 Cups of Honey</h2>
<p>Half a cup of honey is a versatile quantity in both sweet and savoury dishes. It’s enough to glaze a tray of roasted vegetables or chicken wings in the air fryer, adding a caramelised finish. In baking, it’s perfect for sweetening a loaf of bread or a batch of cookies. Honey’s natural preservative qualities also make it ideal for marinades and dressings, extending the shelf life of meal-prepped dishes.</p>

<p>For a quick and tasty air fryer recipe, try brushing 0.5 cups of honey (170 grams) over salmon fillets before cooking. The result is a glossy, flavourful dish with minimal effort.

<p>5 tablespoons of vegetable oil equals approximately 68 grams. This conversion is essential for precise cooking, especially when using an air fryer where measurements can impact texture and crispiness. Whether you're frying, baking, or roasting, knowing the exact weight ensures consistent results every time.</p>

<h2>Why accurate oil measurements matter in air frying</h2>
<p>Air fryers rely on hot air circulation to cook food evenly, and using the right amount of oil is crucial. Too little oil can leave food dry, while too much may make it greasy. Converting 5 tbsp vegetable oil to grams (68g) helps maintain this balance. Many <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> specify oil in grams for precision, especially when dealing with marinades or coatings.</p>
<p>Vegetable oil is a common choice for air frying due to its high smoke point and neutral flavour. Measuring it correctly ensures your dishes turn out perfectly crispy without excess oil absorption.

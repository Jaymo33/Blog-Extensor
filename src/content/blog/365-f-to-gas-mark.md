<h2>What is 365 F to Gas Mark?</h2>
<p>365°F converts to Gas Mark 4.5 in the UK temperature scale. This is a common temperature for baking, roasting, and air frying dishes like cakes, casseroles, or vegetables. While most ovens use Gas Mark settings, air fryers typically display temperatures in Fahrenheit or Celsius. If your air fryer recipe calls for 365°F but your oven uses Gas Mark, this conversion ensures perfect results. For more air fryer temperature guides, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>

<p>Gas Mark 4.5 falls between Gas Mark 4 (350°F) and Gas Mark 5 (375°F), making it ideal for moderate baking. Many air fryer recipes, especially those for <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>cakes</a> or <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken</a>, use 365°F for even cooking without drying out the food. Since air fryers circulate heat more efficiently than ovens, you might reduce cooking time by 10-15% when converting from Gas Mark. Always preheat your air fryer to 365°F for consistent results, just as you would with an oven.</p>

<h3>Why Use 365 F in an Air Fryer?</h3>
<p>365°F (Gas Mark 4.5) strikes a balance between browning and gentle cooking. It’s hot enough to crisp chicken wings or roast potatoes but low enough to bake delicate items like muffins without burning. Air fryers excel at this temperature because their rapid air circulation mimics a convection oven. For frozen foods like nuggets or fries, 365°F ensures a crispy exterior while thoroughly heating the centre. Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a> for dishes optimised for 365°F.</p>

<h2>How to Convert 365 F to Gas Mark</h2>
<p>Converting 365°F to Gas Mark is straightforward: it’s Gas Mark 4.5. While Gas Mark scales typically use whole numbers, some modern ovens allow half-mark increments for precision. If your oven doesn’t support half marks, round to Gas Mark 4 and extend cooking time slightly. In an air fryer, set the temperature to 365°F directly—no conversion needed. Remember that air fryers cook faster, so check food 5-10 minutes earlier than oven recipes suggest.</p>

<p>For reference, here’s how 365°F compares to other common temperatures: Gas Mark 4 is 350°F, Gas Mark 5 is 375°F, and 365°F sits neatly between them. This makes it perfect for dishes needing moderate heat, like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>roasted vegetables</a> or fish fillets. Always use an oven thermometer to verify your appliance’s accuracy, especially with Gas Mark settings that can vary between models.</p>

<h3>Adjusting Air Fryer Recipes from Gas Mark</h3>
<p>When adapting oven recipes that use Gas Mark to your air fryer, set the temperature to 365°F (Gas Mark 4.5) and reduce cooking time by 20%. For example, if a recipe states “Gas Mark 4.5 for 30 minutes,” try 365°F for 24 minutes in the air fryer. Shake or flip food halfway through for even cooking. Some air fryers have presets for common dishes—if yours includes a “bake” function, it likely uses a similar temperature range. Keep your air fryer clean for optimal performance; our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning guide</a> makes maintenance easy.</p>

<h2>Common Dishes Cooked at 365 F (Gas Mark 4.5)</h2>
<p>Many classic dishes thrive at 365°F (Gas Mark 4.5). In air fryers, this includes crispy tofu, homemade granola, and stuffed mushrooms. For ovens, it’s ideal for Victoria sponge cakes or shepherd’s pie. The moderate heat allows thorough cooking without excessive browning—perfect for dishes with sugar or dairy that might burn at higher temperatures. Air fryers particularly excel at reheating leftovers at 365°F, reviving pizza or fried chicken without drying them out.</p>

<p>Frozen foods also benefit from 365°F in air fryers. Items like spring rolls or fish fingers cook evenly at this temperature, avoiding the sogginess that can occur at lower heats or the burnt edges from higher settings. For best results, preheat your air fryer and avoid overcrowding the basket. If you’re new to air frying, start with simple <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/potatoes>potato recipes</a> at 365°F to get a feel for timing and doneness.</p>

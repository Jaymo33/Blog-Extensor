    "acceptedAnswer": {
    "@type": "Answer",
    "text": "At higher altitudes, you might need to slightly reduce sugar quantities (by about 1-2 tablespoons per 350g) as lower air pressure can cause faster moisture evaporation. This helps prevent over-browning or excessive spreading in air fryer baked goods. The exact adjustment depends on your elevation."

    "acceptedAnswer": {
    "@type": "Answer",
    "text": "This could be due to your air fryer's intense heat caramelising the sugar more than a conventional oven would. Try reducing the sugar by 10-15% in recipes where caramelisation might be too intense. Also ensure you're using standard measuring cups - some coffee mugs or teacups hold significantly more than an actual measuring cup."

<p>350 grams of granulated sugar is approximately 1.75 cups in the UK or 1.67 cups in the US. Getting this conversion right is essential for baking success, especially when using an air fryer where precise measurements can affect texture and browning. Whether you're making cookies, cakes, or other sweet treats, knowing how to convert grams to cups ensures consistent results every time.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Sugar Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Baking</h2>
<p>When baking in an air fryer, even small measurement discrepancies can lead to uneven cooking or texture issues. Granulated sugar not only sweetens your recipes but also affects moisture retention and caramelisation. For example, if you're making air fryer cookies from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>our recipe collection</a>, using the correct 350 grams to cups conversion ensures the perfect chewiness. Too much sugar can make baked goods spread too thin, while too little might leave them dry.</p>
<p>The compact cooking space of an air fryer amplifies the importance of precision. Unlike conventional ovens where there's more margin for error, air fryers circulate hot air intensely around food. This means your <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/Cakes>air fryer cakes</a> need exactly the right sugar quantity to brown properly without burning. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a> can help you adjust other ingredients too for perfect air fryer results.</p>

<h2>UK vs US Cup Measurements for 350g Granulated Sugar</h2>
<p>It's crucial to note that UK and US cup measurements differ slightly. In the UK, 350 grams of granulated sugar equals about 1.75 cups, while in the US it's approximately 1.67 cups. This difference stems from variations in standard cup sizes between the two measurement systems. For most home baking in an air fryer, this small variance won't make a dramatic difference, but for precision recipes it's worth being aware.</p>
<p>If you're following an American recipe but using UK measurements (or vice versa), it's worth investing in a kitchen scale for complete accuracy. Many of our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/Dessert>air fryer dessert recipes</a> provide measurements in both grams and cups to eliminate confusion. Remember that how you fill the cup also affects the measurement - the scoop-and-level method is most accurate for granulated sugar.</p>

<h3>How to Measure 350g Granulated Sugar Without Scales</h3>
<p>If you don't have kitchen scales, you can still measure 350 grams of granulated sugar using cups. Fill your measuring cup loosely with sugar, then level it off with a straight edge. Do this gently to avoid packing the sugar down, as compressed sugar will give you an inaccurate measurement. For 350 grams, you'll need about 1 and 3/4 UK cups or 1 and 2/3 US cups of granulated sugar.</p>

<h2>Common Recipes Using 350 Grams of Granulated Sugar</h2>
<p>Many classic baking recipes call for around 350 grams of granulated sugar. This quantity is perfect for a standard batch of air fryer cupcakes or a medium-sized sponge cake. When making <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/Cookies>air fryer cookies</a>, 350 grams of sugar typically yields about 24-30 cookies, depending on size. The sugar helps create that perfect crisp exterior while keeping the centres deliciously chewy.</p>
<p>Some savoury air fryer recipes also use sugar in smaller quantities for balance. For instance, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/Chicken>air fryer chicken glaze recipes</a> might include a tablespoon or two from your 350g measurement. After baking, remember to clean your air fryer properly - sugar residues can caramelise and become sticky. Our guide on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaning</a> has tips for keeping your appliance in top condition.</p>

<h3>Storing Leftover Granulated Sugar</h3>
<p>If your recipe doesn't use the full 350 grams, store the remainder in an airtight container in a cool, dry place. Granulated sugar keeps indefinitely when stored properly, making it a versatile staple for all your air fryer baking needs. For best results when measuring later, fluff the sugar with a fork before scooping to prevent compaction that could throw off your measurements.</p>

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on even heat distribution, and incorrect ingredient quantities can throw off cooking times and textures. Too much ketchup, for example, might make your dish overly soggy, while too little could leave it dry. By converting 4 tbsp of tomato ketchup to grams, you ensure your recipes turn out perfectly every time. Visit <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>our recipe collection</a> for inspiration on using ketchup in air fryer meals.</p>  

<p>Many UK cooks prefer weighing ingredients for better accuracy, especially with sticky condiments like ketchup. A digital kitchen scale is a handy tool for this, eliminating the need for messy spoon measurements. If you're new to air frying, precise weights help you master the technique faster.</p>  

<h3>How to measure tomato ketchup for air fryer recipes</h3>  
<p>For the most accurate results, use a digital scale to weigh your ketchup directly. If you don’t have one, lightly spoon the ketchup into a tablespoon and level it off. Remember, 4 tbsp of tomato ketchup equals roughly 60 grams, but slight variations can occur based on brand thickness. Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipes</a> for tasty ways to use this measurement.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for 4 tbsp of tomato ketchup in air frying</h2>

A 60-gram portion (4 tbsp) works perfectly in glazes for meats like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/beef>beef</a> or as a base for homemade barbecue sauces.

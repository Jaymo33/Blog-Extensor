<p>385 ml of lemon juice is approximately 1.63 cups. This conversion is essential for recipes requiring precise measurements, especially when using an air fryer where ingredient ratios can affect cooking results. Whether you're preparing a citrusy glaze or a tangy marinade, knowing this conversion ensures your dish turns out perfectly every time.</p>

<h2>Understanding Lemon Juice Measurements</h2>
<p>When working with lemon juice in recipes, accuracy matters. 385 ml of lemon juice translates to roughly 1.63 cups, but it's worth noting that this can vary slightly depending on how you measure. For air fryer recipes found on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, precise measurements help achieve consistent results. The acidity of lemon juice can affect how other ingredients behave during cooking, making correct measurements crucial.</p>
<p>Many baking recipes, especially those for cakes or cookies in your air fryer, call for specific amounts of lemon juice. If you're working with 385 ml of lemon juice, you'll need about 1 and 2/3 cups. This conversion is particularly useful when scaling recipes up or down. For more conversion help, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>

<h2>Why Measurement Accuracy Matters</h2>
<p>In air frying, where heat circulates rapidly, the balance of wet to dry ingredients can make or break your dish. 385 ml of lemon juice (1.63 cups) adds significant moisture and acidity that affects texture and rise. Too much can make baked goods soggy, while too little might leave them dry. This is especially important for <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>air fryer cakes</a> where precision is key.</p>
<p>The acidity in 385 ml of lemon juice also interacts with baking soda or powder in recipes. This chemical reaction needs the right proportions to work effectively. When converting 385 ml of lemon juice to cups, using proper measuring tools ensures your air fryer creations turn out light and fluffy every time.</p>

<h3>Measuring Tools for Best Results</h3>
<p>For the most accurate conversion of 385 ml of lemon juice to cups, use a liquid measuring cup with clear markings. Glass measures are ideal as they won't absorb citrus odors. When measuring sticky liquids like lemon juice, lightly grease the cup first for easier pouring and more precise measurement.</p>

<h2>Converting Lemon Juice in Recipes</h2>
<p>Many international recipes list lemon juice in milliliters rather than cups. When you encounter 385 ml of lemon juice in a recipe, knowing it's about 1.63 cups helps adapt it for your air fryer. This conversion is handy whether you're making <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>citrus desserts</a> or savory dishes.</p>
<p>If your recipe calls for 385 ml of lemon juice but you only have measuring cups, the 1.63 cup equivalent will serve you well. Remember that fresh lemon juice varies in acidity, so taste as you go.

<h3>Adjusting for Concentration Differences</h3>
<p>When working with bottled versus fresh lemon juice, the 385 ml to cups conversion remains the same, but flavor intensity may differ. Bottled juice is often more concentrated, so you might need slightly less than the full 1.63 cups for the same tartness level in your air fryer dishes.</p>

<h2>Practical Tips for Using Lemon Juice</h2>
<p>Now that you know 385 ml of lemon juice equals about 1.63 cups, here are some practical tips. When adding lemon juice to air fryer marinades, distribute it evenly for consistent flavor.

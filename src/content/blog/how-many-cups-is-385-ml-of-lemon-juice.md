<h2>Why Measurement Accuracy Matters</h2>
<p>In air frying, where heat circulates rapidly, the balance of wet to dry ingredients can make or break your dish. 385 ml of lemon juice (1.63 cups) adds significant moisture and acidity that affects texture and rise. Too much can make baked goods soggy, while too little might leave them dry. This is especially important for <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>air fryer cakes</a> where precision is key.</p>
<p>The acidity in 385 ml of lemon juice also interacts with baking soda or powder in recipes. This chemical reaction needs the right proportions to work effectively. When converting 385 ml of lemon juice to cups, using proper measuring tools ensures your air fryer creations turn out light and fluffy every time.</p>

<h3>Measuring Tools for Best Results</h3>
<p>For the most accurate conversion of 385 ml of lemon juice to cups, use a liquid measuring cup with clear markings. Glass measures are ideal as they won't absorb citrus odors. When measuring sticky liquids like lemon juice, lightly grease the cup first for easier pouring and more precise measurement.</p>

<h2>Converting Lemon Juice in Recipes</h2>

This conversion is handy whether you're making <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>citrus desserts</a> or savory dishes.</p>
<p>If your recipe calls for 385 ml of lemon juice but you only have measuring cups, the 1.63 cup equivalent will serve you well. Remember that fresh lemon juice varies in acidity, so taste as you go.

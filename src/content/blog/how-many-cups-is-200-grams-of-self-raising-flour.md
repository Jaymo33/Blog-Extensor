<p>200 grams of self-raising flour equals approximately 1.6 cups when measured correctly. This conversion is essential for baking in an air fryer, where precise measurements can make or break your recipe. Whether you're whipping up cakes, muffins, or scones, knowing how to convert grams to cups ensures consistent results every time.

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Baking is a science, and even small deviations in flour measurements can affect texture and rise. Self-raising flour, which contains baking powder, needs careful handling to avoid dense or overly airy results. Using 200 grams of self-raising flour (roughly 1.6 cups) ensures your air fryer bakes turn out light and fluffy. If you're unsure, a digital kitchen scale is your best friend for precision. For more on air fryer baking essentials, explore <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>our conversion chart</a>.</p>  

<p>Different brands of self-raising flour may vary slightly in density, so always spoon the flour into the measuring cup and level it off. Scooping directly from the bag can compact the flour, leading to inaccurate measurements. This is especially important for air fryer recipes, where even small errors can impact cooking times and results. Need inspiration?

<h3>UK vs. US Cup Measurements</h3>  
<p>It's worth noting that UK and US cup measurements differ slightly. A UK cup holds 250ml, while a US cup is 240ml. For 200 grams of self-raising flour, this translates to about 1.6 UK cups or 1.67 US cups. Always check your recipe's origin to avoid confusion.

<h2>Tips for Measuring Self-Raising Flour</h2>  
<p>To measure 200 grams of self-raising flour accurately, use the spoon-and-level method. Gently spoon the flour into your measuring cup until it's heaped, then level it off with a straight edge. Avoid tapping the cup, as this compacts the flour. For air fryer baking, consistency is keyâ€”whether you're making <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cookies>cookies</a> or bread.</p>  

<p>If you don't have a scale, remember that 200 grams of self-raising flour is roughly 1.6 cups. However, investing in a digital scale will give you the most reliable results. Air fryer recipes often require precision, so a scale can be a game-changer.

<h3>Common Mistakes to Avoid</h3>  
<p>One common mistake is using a liquid measuring cup for dry ingredients like self-raising flour. Dry and liquid cups are designed differently, and using the wrong one can throw off your measurements. Always use dry measuring cups for flour to ensure 200 grams equals 1.6 cups accurately.</p>

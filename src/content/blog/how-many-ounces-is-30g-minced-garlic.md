<h3>How to Measure Minced Garlic Without a Scale</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a scale, 30g of minced garlic is roughly two tablespoons. However, this can vary based on how finely the garlic is chopped. For air fryer dishes, we recommend weighing for consistency. Pre-minced garlic from jars often has added moisture, so adjust accordingly.

<h2>Common Uses for 30g of Minced Garlic</h2>

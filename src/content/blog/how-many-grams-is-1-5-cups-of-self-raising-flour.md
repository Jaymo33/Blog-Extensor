<p>1.5 cups of self-raising flour equals approximately 195 grams. This conversion is essential for precise baking, especially when using an air fryer where measurements can make or break a recipe. Whether you're whipping up cakes, muffins, or bread, knowing the exact weight ensures consistency and perfect results every time.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Flour Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Baking is a science, and even small deviations in flour measurements can affect texture and rise. Self-raising flour contains baking powder, so incorrect amounts can lead to dense or overly airy bakes. For air fryer recipes, where cooking times are shorter, precision is even more critical. A kitchen scale is your best friend here, but if you don’t have one, our conversion guide will help. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more handy tips.</p>  

<p>Many bakers rely on cups, but weight (grams) is far more reliable. Flour can settle or be packed differently, leading to inconsistencies. For example, 1.5 cups of self-raising flour in the UK might differ slightly from US measurements due to cup size variations. Always aim for 195 grams for the best results in your air fryer creations.</p>  

<h2>Converting Cups to Grams for Self-Raising Flour</h2>  
<p>Self-raising flour is lighter than plain flour due to the added raising agents. One cup typically weighs around 130 grams, so 1.5 cups equal roughly 195 grams. This conversion is vital for recipes like scones or sponges, where the right rise is crucial. If you’re adapting a traditional oven recipe for the air fryer, precise measurements ensure even cooking.</p>

<h3>UK vs. US Cup Measurements</h3>  
<p>In the UK, a standard cup holds 250ml, while in the US, it’s 240ml. This slight difference can affect your baking, especially with flour. For 1.5 cups of self-raising flour, UK bakers should use 195 grams, while US bakers might find 190 grams more accurate. When in doubt, weigh it out!</p>  

<h2>Common Baking Recipes Using 1.5 Cups of Self-Raising Flour</h2>

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on rapid air circulation to cook food evenly, and incorrect liquid measurements can affect texture and doneness. Using the right amount of chicken broth—like 235 ml—ensures your dishes stay moist without becoming soggy. Many <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> call for precise broth quantities to balance flavours and moisture.

Always measure liquids like chicken broth in a clear measuring jug for accuracy. Need more tips? Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaning guide</a> helps maintain precision by keeping your appliance in top shape.</p>  

<h3>Converting 235 ml of Chicken Broth for UK and US Recipes</h3>  
<p>In the UK, metric measurements like millilitres (ml) are standard, while US recipes often use cups. Since 235 ml of chicken broth is roughly 1 cup, this conversion bridges the gap between international recipes. For air fryer users, this means no more guessing when adapting a US recipe to your kitchen. If you're working with a <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken-based dish</a>, precise broth measurements ensure juicy, flavourful results every time.</p>

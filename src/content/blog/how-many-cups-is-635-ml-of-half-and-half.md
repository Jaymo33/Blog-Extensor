<p>635 ml of half and half equals approximately 2.68 cups. Whether you're baking a cake or preparing a creamy sauce in your air fryer, knowing this conversion ensures your recipe turns out perfectly. Half and half, a blend of milk and cream, is commonly used in both sweet and savoury dishes, so getting the measurement right is key.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Precision is crucial in cooking and baking, especially when using an air fryer. Too much or too little half and half can affect the texture and taste of your dish.

<p>If you’re following a recipe from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, you’ll want to ensure your measurements are spot-on. Many air fryer recipes rely on precise liquid ratios to achieve the perfect crispiness or tenderness. A handy <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a> can help you switch between metric and imperial measurements effortlessly.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure Half and Half Properly</h3>  
<p>When measuring 635 ml of half and half, use a liquid measuring cup for accuracy. Pour the half and half up to the 2.68-cup mark, or weigh it if you prefer using a kitchen scale. This ensures consistency, whether you're making a creamy pasta sauce or a decadent dessert in your air fryer.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for Half and Half in Air Fryer Recipes</h2>  
<p>Half and half is a versatile ingredient that works well in many air fryer dishes. From creamy mashed potatoes to rich custards, it adds a smooth texture and mild richness.

<h2>Tips for Storing Half and Half</h2>

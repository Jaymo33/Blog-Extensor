<p>2.5 cups of plain yogurt equals approximately 20 ounces. This conversion is essential for anyone using precise measurements in their air fryer recipes, ensuring consistent results every time. Whether you're making dips, marinades, or baked goods, knowing the exact weight of your ingredients can make all the difference.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of ingredients ensures your air fryer dishes turn out perfectly. Too much or too little yogurt can affect texture and cooking times. For example, a <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>yogurt-based marinade</a> for chicken needs the correct consistency to coat evenly. Precise measurements also help when scaling recipes up or down, so you never waste food.</p>  
<p>Air fryers cook food quickly, so even small measurement errors can lead to overcooking or undercooking. If you're making a <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>yogurt cake</a>, 2.5 cups of plain yogurt (20 ounces) ensures the batter has the right moisture content. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a> for other common ingredient measurements.</p>  

<h2>How to Measure 2.5 Cups of Plain Yogurt</h2>  
<p>For the most accurate results, use a kitchen scale to weigh your yogurt. Scoop the yogurt into a measuring cup, then transfer it to the scale to confirm it's 20 ounces. If you don't have a scale, fluff the yogurt with a spoon before gently filling the measuring cup to avoid compacting it.</p>  

<h3>Converting Yogurt Measurements for UK Cooks</h3>

This is handy when following international recipes or using <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> guides.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for 2.5 Cups of Plain Yogurt in Air Fryer Recipes</h2>

Try it in <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>yogurt-marinated chicken</a> or as a base for healthy dips.

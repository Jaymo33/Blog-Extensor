<p>1.5 cups of peanut butter equals approximately 12 ounces. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes, where precise measurements can make or break your dish. Whether you're baking peanut butter cookies or preparing a satay sauce, knowing the exact weight ensures consistency. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we help you nail every recipe with accurate conversions and expert tips.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on even cooking, and incorrect measurements can lead to uneven results. Too much peanut butter might make your cookies spread too thin, while too little could leave them dry. Using 12 ounces (1.5 cups) ensures your recipes turn out perfectly every time. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more handy measurement guides.</p>  

<p>Peanut butter is a staple in many air fryer recipes, from desserts to savoury dishes. Its thick consistency means volume-to-weight conversions are crucial. If you're working with UK measurements, rest assured that 1.5 cups translates to 12 ounces regardless of regional differences. For more inspiration, browse our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> collection.</p>  

<h3>How to measure peanut butter correctly</h3>  
<p>Measuring sticky ingredients like peanut butter can be tricky. For accuracy, use a kitchen scale to weigh out 12 ounces directly. If you don’t have one, lightly grease your measuring cup to help the peanut butter slide out easily. This method ensures you get the full 1.5 cups without leaving half stuck to the utensil.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for 1.5 cups of peanut butter in air fryer recipes</h2>  
<p>This quantity is perfect for batch cooking. You might use it for a large batch of peanut butter cookies, a creamy satay sauce for chicken skewers, or even energy bites. The air fryer’s rapid circulation ensures even cooking, so your peanut butter-based dishes come out perfectly every time. Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert recipes</a> for sweet ideas.</p>  

<p>Another great use is in protein bars or granola clusters. The air fryer gives them a crisp exterior while keeping the centre chewy. Since peanut butter is calorie-dense, measuring 1.5 cups (12 ounces) helps with portion control. For savoury options, try our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipes</a> with peanut-based marinades.</p>  

<h3>Adjusting recipes for different peanut butter types</h3>  
<p>Natural peanut butter tends to be runnier, while commercial varieties are thicker. If using natural, you may need slightly less than 1.5 cups to hit 12 ounces. Always check the label for weight per cup to ensure accuracy. This small adjustment can prevent your air fryer dishes from becoming too oily or dry.</p>

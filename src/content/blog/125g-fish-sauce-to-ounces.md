<p>125g of fish sauce equals approximately 4.41 ounces. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements can make or break a dish. Whether you're marinating chicken or adding depth to a stir-fry, knowing the exact weight ensures consistency. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we help you nail every measurement for flawless cooking.</p>

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on precise ingredient ratios to deliver crispy, evenly cooked results. Too much or too little fish sauce can alter the flavour and texture of your dish.

<h3>How to measure 125g fish sauce without scales</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a kitchen scale, use a liquid measuring cup for approximate conversions. Since 1 fluid ounce of fish sauce weighs roughly 28.35g, 125g translates to just under 4.5 fluid ounces. For best results, invest in a digital scale—it’s a game-changer for air fryer cooking.</p>

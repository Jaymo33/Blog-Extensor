<h3>How to Measure Butter Correctly</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a kitchen scale, you can still measure 1.25 cups of butter accurately. One standard stick of butter in the UK is about 113 grams, so 2.5 sticks equal roughly 1.25 cups. Pack the butter firmly into a measuring cup to avoid air gaps, ensuring consistency. For air fryer recipes, like those in our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>cake category</a>, precise butter measurements help avoid soggy or unevenly cooked results.</p>  

<h2>Converting Butter Measurements for Air Fryer Recipes</h2>  
<p>Air fryers cook food faster and more evenly than conventional ovens, so ingredient accuracy is key. Whether you’re making crispy cookies or fluffy cakes, knowing that 1.25 cups of butter is 284 grams ensures your dish turns out perfectly. Many <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert recipes</a> rely on this conversion for consistent results.</p>  

<p>If you’re adapting a traditional recipe for the air fryer, double-check your butter measurements. A slight miscalculation can lead to overcooking or undercooking. For example, too much butter in an air fryer cake might cause it to brown too quickly on the outside while remaining raw inside.</p>

Always verify which measurement system your recipe uses. Another mistake is using melted butter instead of solid butter for cup measurements, which can throw off the weight.</p>

<p>No, you should not put paper towel in an air fryer as it poses a significant fire risk. The high-speed circulating heat in air fryers can easily cause paper products to ignite, especially when they come into contact with heating elements or get blown around by the fan.</p>

<h2>Why Paper Towel Is Dangerous in Air Fryers</h2>
<p>Air fryers operate at temperatures between 150°C to 200°C, which is far beyond paper's ignition point. Unlike conventional ovens where paper might be safe when properly secured, the powerful fan in air fryers creates unpredictable air currents. These currents can dislodge paper towels, allowing them to contact heating elements where they can instantly catch fire.</p>
<p>The risk increases when cooking fatty foods that might drip onto the paper towel. Grease acts as an accelerant, making ignition more likely. Even if the paper doesn't catch fire, it can scorch and leave behind unpleasant odors or even damage your air fryer's non-stick coating.

<h2>Safe Alternatives to Paper Towel</h2>
<p>If you're looking to absorb grease or prevent sticking, consider these safer options than paper towel in your air fryer. Parchment paper designed specifically for air fryers has heat-resistant properties and often comes with pre-cut holes for proper airflow. These liners are widely available and much safer than regular paper towel.</p>
<p>Silicone mats are another excellent alternative that won't catch fire and are reusable. Many air fryer models come with their own specially designed racks or trays that eliminate the need for any additional liners.

<h3>What About Reheating with Paper Towel?</h3>
<p>Some people wonder if using paper towel in an air fryer for reheating is safer since temperatures might be lower. However, even at reheating temperatures around 150°C, paper towel remains a fire hazard. The combination of dry heat and air circulation creates perfect conditions for ignition, especially over longer reheating periods.</p>

<h2>Manufacturer Recommendations on Paper Products</h2>
<p>Most major air fryer brands explicitly warn against using paper towel in their appliances. Ninja, Philips, and other leading manufacturers state that only approved accessories should be used in their devices. Using unauthorized materials like paper towel may void your warranty if it causes damage.</p>
<p>Always consult your specific model's manual for guidance on compatible liners and accessories. Many manufacturers offer their own branded liners that are tested for safety with their appliances.

<h3>What If Paper Towel Accidentally Goes In?</h3>
<p>If paper towel accidentally enters your air fryer during cooking, turn off the appliance immediately and unplug it. Allow it to cool completely before carefully removing any paper remnants. Inspect the heating element and interior for any signs of scorching or damage before using again.</p>

<h2>Proper Cleaning Without Paper Towel</h2>
<p>While you shouldn't use paper towel in an air fryer during cooking, they can be helpful for cleaning - but only after the unit has completely cooled. Damp paper towels can help wipe away grease and food particles from cold surfaces.

<p>Regular maintenance with proper tools will keep your air fryer in top condition without resorting to risky paper towel use during cooking. Always follow the manufacturer's cleaning instructions to preserve your appliance's performance and safety features.</p>

<p>560 ml of honey is approximately 2.37 cups in US measurements or 2.46 cups in UK measurements. This conversion is essential for baking and cooking, especially when using an air fryer where precision matters. Whether you're whipping up a sweet glaze or a sticky marinade, knowing how to convert ml to cups ensures your dish turns out perfectly every time.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Honey Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Getting the right amount of honey is crucial for both flavour and texture in your recipes. Too much honey can make dishes overly sweet or sticky, while too little might leave them lacking depth. For air fryer recipes, precise measurements help prevent burning or uneven cooking. If you're exploring new dishes, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipe collection</a> for inspiration.</p>  

<p>Honey's viscosity means it doesn't pour like water, so measuring by volume can be tricky. Using a liquid measuring cup with a spout helps, but weighing honey (if your recipe allows) is even more accurate. For more tips on conversions, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> is a handy resource.</p>  

<h3>US vs. UK Cup Measurements</h3>  
<p>The difference between US and UK cups might seem small, but it can affect your recipe. A US cup is 240 ml, while a UK cup is 227 ml. For 560 ml of honey, this means roughly 2.37 US cups or 2.46 UK cups. Always check which measurement system your recipe uses to avoid mishaps.</p>  

<h2>How to Measure Honey Without Sticky Mess</h2>  
<p>Measuring sticky ingredients like honey can be frustrating, but a few tricks make it easier. Lightly coating your measuring cup with oil helps honey slide out cleanly. Alternatively, warm the honey slightly (not too hot) to make it less viscous. If you're prepping multiple ingredients, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/meal-prep>meal prep recipes</a> can save time.</p>  

<p>Another method is the spoon-and-level technique: use a spoon to fill the measuring cup, then level it off with a knife. This avoids air pockets and ensures accuracy. After measuring, a quick wipe with <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner</a> keeps your tools spotless.</p>  

<h3>Converting Honey for Air Fryer Recipes</h3>  
<p>Air fryers cook faster than conventional ovens, so balancing wet and dry ingredients is key. If a recipe calls for 560 ml of honey, converting it to cups ensures even cooking. For glazes or marinades, like those in our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipes</a>, precise measurements prevent sogginess or burning.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for 560 ml of Honey</h2>  
<p>560 ml of honey is a versatile quantity for both sweet and savoury dishes. It's enough for a batch of honey-glazed carrots, a marinade for roast chicken, or several servings of honey cake. In the air fryer, honey works beautifully for sticky wings or glazed nuts—just monitor cooking times closely.</p>  

<p>If you're experimenting with desserts, try drizzling honey over air-fried fruit or incorporating it into batters. For more ideas, browse our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert category</a>. Remember, honey caramelises quickly, so reduce cooking temperatures slightly if needed.</p>  

<h3>Storing Leftover Honey</h3>  
<p>If you don't use all 560 ml of honey at once, store it properly to maintain quality. Keep it in an airtight container at room temperature, away from direct sunlight. Honey crystallises over time, but gently warming the jar in warm water restores its smooth texture.</p>

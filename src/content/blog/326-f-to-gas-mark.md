<p>326°F converts to Gas Mark 3 in UK ovens and air fryers. This moderate temperature is perfect for baking cookies, roasting vegetables, or cooking delicate proteins in your air fryer. Understanding this conversion helps when following recipes designed for conventional ovens.</p>

<h2>Why Convert 326 F to Gas Mark?</h2>
<p>Many British recipes still use Gas Mark measurements, especially for baking. If your air fryer only shows Fahrenheit, knowing that 326 F equals Gas Mark 3 ensures accurate cooking. This temperature works beautifully for items that need gentle, even heat without excessive browning. You'll find it ideal for scones, muffins, and some cake recipes on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>.</p>

<p>Gas Mark 3 (326°F) falls into the moderate oven temperature range. It's lower than the typical air fryer roasting temperature but perfect when you want slower, more controlled cooking. This makes it excellent for dishes where you don't want the outside to cook faster than the inside, like our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/Cakes>air fryer cake recipes</a>.</p>

<h3>How Gas Mark Compares to Air Fryer Temperatures</h3>
<p>Air fryers cook faster than conventional ovens due to their circulating hot air. When converting 326 F to Gas Mark 3 for air frying, you might reduce cooking time by 20-25%. For example, cookies that take 15 minutes in a Gas Mark 3 oven may need just 10-12 minutes in an air fryer.

<h2>Common Uses for 326 F (Gas Mark 3)</h2>
<p>This temperature works wonderfully for delicate baked goods that need gentle heat. Try it for Victoria sponge cakes, shortbread biscuits, or meringues in your air fryer. It's also excellent for slow-roasting tomatoes or drying herbs. The moderate heat prevents burning while ensuring thorough cooking.</p>

<p>For savoury dishes, 326 F (Gas Mark 3) suits items like stuffed peppers or aubergine parmigiana. The lower temperature allows fillings to cook through without the exterior becoming too crisp.

<h3>Adjusting Cooking Times at Gas Mark 3</h3>
<p>When using 326 F in your air fryer, remember that basket-style models cook faster than oven-style ones. For even cooking at Gas Mark 3, shake or turn food halfway through. This ensures all surfaces get equal exposure to the circulating heat, especially important for items like roasted nuts or granola.</p>

<h2>Tips for Baking at 326 F to Gas Mark 3</h2>
<p>Use parchment paper or silicone liners when baking at this temperature to prevent sticking. The moderate heat means batters and doughs need proper support to maintain their shape. Our guide to <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning your air fryer</a> after baking is especially helpful for sticky batters.</p>

<p>For best results at 326 F (Gas Mark 3), preheat your air fryer for 3-5 minutes. This ensures even cooking from the start, crucial for baked goods. If adapting an oven recipe, reduce the sugar slightly as air fryers promote more caramelisation at lower temperatures.</p>

<h3>Troubleshooting 326 F Cooking</h3>
<p>If food isn't browning enough at Gas Mark 3, try increasing to 350 F (Gas Mark 4) for the last few minutes. Conversely, if edges are browning too fast, cover with foil. Remember that air fryer models vary, so note your preferred settings for 326 F conversions with your specific appliance.</p>

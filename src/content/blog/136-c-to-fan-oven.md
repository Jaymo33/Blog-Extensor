<p>136 C in a fan oven is equivalent to approximately 120 C in a conventional oven. This adjustment accounts for the efficient heat circulation of a fan oven, which cooks food faster and more evenly. If you're using an air fryer, 136 C translates directly, as air fryers operate similarly to fan ovens. For perfect results, always preheat your appliance and check recipes for specific guidance. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we recommend verifying temperatures with a reliable oven thermometer.</p>  

<h2>Understanding Fan Oven Temperatures</h2>  
<p>Fan ovens use a built-in fan to circulate hot air, ensuring even cooking and reducing cooking times. When a recipe calls for 136 C in a fan oven, it's typically 10-20 C lower than a conventional oven setting. This difference is crucial for avoiding overcooked or burnt dishes. Many modern air fryers, like those featured on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>our conversion chart</a>, follow the same principles. Always adjust recipes accordingly, especially when baking delicate items like cakes or cookies.</p>  

<p>For example, if a traditional recipe requires 150 C, setting your fan oven to 136 C might yield similar results. This adjustment is particularly useful for roasting vegetables or cooking meats evenly. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a> for fan oven and air fryer-friendly dishes tailored to these temperatures. Remember, slight variations between appliances mean it's best to monitor your food as it cooks.</p>  

<h3>Why 136 C Works for Baking</h3>  
<p>136 C is a versatile temperature for baking, especially in fan ovens and air fryers. It's ideal for items that require gentle, even heat, such as sponge cakes or shortbread. The fan-assisted circulation prevents hot spots, ensuring a consistent bake. If you're adapting a conventional recipe, reducing the temperature by 10-20 C (to 136 C) often works perfectly.

<h2>Air Fryer Equivalents for 136 C</h2>  
<p>Air fryers and fan ovens share similar heating mechanisms, so 136 C in a fan oven is the same in an air fryer. This makes converting recipes straightforward, whether you're roasting potatoes or baking muffins. However, air fryers cook faster due to their compact size, so keep an eye on timing. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning guide</a> ensures your appliance stays in top condition for accurate temperature performance. Always preheat your air fryer for the best results.</p>  

<p>For frozen foods like chips or chicken nuggets, 136 C in an air fryer delivers crispy results without burning. This temperature is also great for reheating leftovers evenly. If you're unsure, start with a lower time and check frequently. Many air fryer models, like those we review on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, have presets that simplify cooking at 136 C.</p>  

<h3>Common Mistakes at 136 C</h3>  
<p>Avoid overcrowding your air fryer basket or fan oven tray at 136 C, as this disrupts airflow. Uneven cooking can occur if food is piled too high or spaced improperly. For best results, arrange items in a single layer and shake or turn them halfway through cooking. This ensures everything cooks evenly, whether you're roasting vegetables or baking cookies.</p>

<p>3 cups of mayonnaise equals approximately 24 ounces. This conversion is essential for precise cooking, especially when using an air fryer where measurements can make or break a recipe. Whether you're whipping up a batch of crispy chicken or a creamy dip, knowing how to convert 3 cups of mayonnaise to ounces ensures consistency and perfect results every time.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on precise ingredient ratios to achieve the perfect texture and flavour. Too much or too little mayonnaise can affect the crispiness or moisture of your dish. For example, if you're making <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer chicken tenders</a>, the right amount of mayonnaise in your coating ensures a golden, crunchy exterior. Accurate measurements also help when scaling recipes up or down, so you never waste ingredients.</p>  

<p>Mayonnaise is a common ingredient in many air fryer recipes, from dips to marinades. If you're unsure about conversions, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> can be a handy reference. It covers everything from cups to ounces, grams, and millilitres, making it easier to follow any recipe without guesswork.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure Mayonnaise Correctly</h3>  
<p>Measuring mayonnaise can be tricky due to its thick consistency. For the most accurate results, use a liquid measuring cup for fluids or a kitchen scale for weight. Scoop the mayonnaise into the cup and level it off with a straight edge to ensure you're getting exactly 3 cups. If you're converting to ounces, remember that 1 cup of mayonnaise is roughly 8 ounces, so 3 cups would be 24 ounces.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for 3 Cups of Mayonnaise in Air Fryer Recipes</h2>  
<p>Three cups of mayonnaise can go a long way in air fryer cooking. It's often used as a base for creamy sauces, like the one in our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>air fryer chicken recipes</a>. You might also mix it with breadcrumbs for a crispy coating or blend it into a dip for veggies or chips. Since mayonnaise helps retain moisture, it's perfect for preventing dry results in air-fried dishes.</p>  

<p>If you're meal prepping, knowing how many ounces are in 3 cups of mayonnaise helps you portion correctly. For instance, a batch of <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>air fryer vegetable fritters</a> might call for a specific amount of mayonnaise in the batter. Precise measurements ensure every fritter turns out just right, with no soggy or overly dry spots.</p>  

<h3>Tips for Storing Leftover Mayonnaise</h3>  
<p>If you don't use all 3 cups of mayonnaise at once, proper storage is key. Transfer it to an airtight container and refrigerate it to maintain freshness. Always check for signs of spoilage, like an off smell or separation, before reusing.

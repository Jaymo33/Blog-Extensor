<p>0.25 cup of tahini equals approximately 2 ounces (oz). This measurement is crucial for air fryer recipes where precision ensures the best texture and flavour. Whether you’re whipping up a batch of hummus or a tahini-based dressing, knowing how many ounces are in 0.25 cup of tahini helps you follow recipes accurately.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Tahini Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of tahini can make or break your dish. Too little, and your hummus might lack creaminess; too much, and it could become overly dense. For air fryer recipes, precise measurements like 0.25 cup of tahini to ounces ensure consistent results every time. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for other common ingredient conversions.</p>  

<p>Tahini’s thick consistency means it’s best measured by weight rather than volume for accuracy. A kitchen scale is ideal, but if you’re using cups, knowing that 0.25 cup of tahini is 2 ounces simplifies things. This is especially helpful when adapting recipes from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>our collection</a> to suit your air fryer.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure Tahini Correctly</h3>  
<p>To measure 0.25 cup of tahini, use a liquid measuring cup and level it off with a spatula. Alternatively, weigh it for precision—2 ounces is your target. Sticky ingredients like tahini can be tricky, so lightly oiling the measuring cup helps it slide out easily.</p>  

<h2>Converting Tahini for Air Fryer Recipes</h2>

Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/tofu>tofu recipes</a> for inspiration.</p>

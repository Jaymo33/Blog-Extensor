<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Baking</h2>  
<p>Baking is a science, and even small measurement errors can lead to dry cakes or overly dense cookies. Brown sugar, whether light or dark, packs differently than granulated sugar, so volume-to-weight conversions are crucial. Air fryer recipes, like those on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, often rely on grams for consistency. Using 500 grams instead of 2.5 cups ensures your desserts bake evenly and taste just right.</p>  

<p>Many UK bakers prefer weighing ingredients for accuracy, especially with sticky brown sugar. A kitchen scale eliminates guesswork, whether you're making a <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>cake</a> or prepping a glaze for air-fried doughnuts. For reference, 1 cup of brown sugar typically weighs 200 grams, so scaling up to 2.5 cups is straightforward.</p>  

<h3>UK vs. US Cup Measurements</h3>  
<p>While 2.5 cups of brown sugar equals 500 grams in both regions, cup sizes can vary slightly. UK cups are based on metric standards (250ml per cup), whereas US cups use 240ml. For most recipes, this difference is negligible, but for precision baking, grams are the gold standard. Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a> for air fryer treats that specify both cup and gram measurements.</p>  

<h2>How to Measure Brown Sugar Correctly</h2>  
<p>To get exactly 500 grams from 2.5 cups, pack the brown sugar firmly into the measuring cup. Unlike granulated sugar, brown sugar contains molasses, making it denser. If you’re adapting a <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cookies>cookie recipe</a> for the air fryer, compacting the sugar ensures the dough holds its shape.

<p>If your recipe calls for loosely packed sugar, reduce the weight by 10-15%. However, most baking recipes assume firmly packed cups unless stated otherwise. When in doubt, weigh 2.5 cups at 500 grams for foolproof results. This method works perfectly for air fryer desserts like brownies or sticky toffee pudding.</p>

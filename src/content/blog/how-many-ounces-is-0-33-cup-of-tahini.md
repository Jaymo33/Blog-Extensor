<p>0.33 cup of tahini equals approximately 2.64 ounces. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements can make or break a dish. Whether you’re whipping up a batch of hummus or adding tahini to a marinade, knowing the exact weight ensures consistency. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we focus on helping you get the measurements right for perfect results every time.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on even cooking, and incorrect ingredient quantities can lead to uneven textures or flavours. Tahini, a thick paste made from sesame seeds, is often used in small but impactful amounts. Measuring 0.33 cup of tahini in ounces ensures you don’t overpower or underwhelm your dish. For more air fryer measurement tips, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>  

<p>Many recipes, especially those for dressings or dips, call for tahini in fractions of a cup. Converting 0.33 cup of tahini to ounces (2.64 oz) helps streamline the process, especially if your kitchen scale only measures in grams or ounces. This precision is particularly useful for air fryer recipes, where ingredient ratios affect cooking times and outcomes.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure Tahini Without a Scale</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a kitchen scale, you can still measure 0.33 cup of tahini accurately. Use a liquid measuring cup and level it off with a straight edge. Tahini’s thick consistency means it won’t pour like water, so spoon it into the cup and scrape off the excess.

<h2>Common Uses for Tahini in Air Fryer Recipes</h2>  
<p>Tahini adds richness to marinades, sauces, and even baked goods. In air fryer cooking, it’s often used in glazes for chicken or as a base for dressings. Knowing that 0.33 cup of tahini equals 2.64 ounces helps you adjust recipes without guesswork. Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipes</a> for tahini-infused ideas.</p>

<p>0.33 cup of chopped spinach equals approximately 0.8 ounces (or roughly 23 grams). This measurement is handy for air fryer recipes, ensuring you get the perfect portion every time. Whether you’re whipping up a quick side dish or adding greens to your meal prep, knowing this conversion saves time and hassle.</p>

<h2>Why Measure Chopped Spinach for Air Fryer Recipes?</h2>  
<p>Accurate measurements matter, especially when using an air fryer. Too much spinach can lead to uneven cooking, while too little might leave your dish lacking. Chopped spinach is a versatile ingredient, perfect for air fryer recipes like crispy spinach bites, stuffed mushrooms, or even as a topping for air-fried pizzas. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we recommend measuring ingredients like spinach precisely for consistent results.</p>  

<p>Spinach shrinks significantly when cooked, so 0.33 cup (0.8 oz) of raw chopped spinach yields less once air-fried. This makes it ideal for recipes where you want a subtle green touch without overpowering other flavours. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more handy measurement tips.</p>  

<h2>How to Convert 0.33 Cup Chopped Spinach to Ounces</h2>  
<p>Converting cups to ounces isn’t always straightforward, especially with leafy greens like spinach. A general rule is that 1 cup of chopped spinach weighs about 2.4 ounces, so 0.33 cup is roughly 0.8 ounces. For UK cooks, this equals approximately 23 grams. If you’re using frozen chopped spinach, thaw and drain it first for accurate measurements.</p>  

<h3>Tools for Measuring Spinach</h3>  
<p>A kitchen scale is the most reliable way to measure 0.33 cup of chopped spinach in ounces. If you don’t have one, lightly pack the spinach into a measuring cup without compressing it too much.

<h2>Using 0.33 Cup Chopped Spinach in Air Fryer Dishes</h2>  
<p>This small but mighty portion of spinach works wonders in air fryer recipes. Try mixing it into omelette bites, sprinkling it over garlic bread, or blending it into a creamy dip. Spinach adds nutrients without overwhelming the dish, making it a favourite for healthy cooking. Visit <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>our vegetable category</a> for more inspiration.</p>  

<p>If you’re meal prepping, 0.33 cup (0.8 oz) of chopped spinach per serving keeps portions balanced. Pair it with air-fried chicken or salmon for a complete meal. Remember, fresh spinach cooks faster than frozen, so adjust air fryer times accordingly—usually 3–5 minutes at 180°C.</p>  

<h3>Common Mistakes When Measuring Spinach</h3>  
<p>Overpacking the measuring cup is a frequent error, leading to more spinach (and ounces) than intended. For 0.33 cup, gently fill the cup and level it off. Also, always chop spinach uniformly to ensure even cooking in the air fryer. Need cleaning tips after cooking?

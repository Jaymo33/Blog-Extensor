<p>2 tablespoons (tbsp) of condensed milk weigh approximately 40 grams. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements ensure perfect results. Whether you’re making desserts or glazes, knowing the exact weight helps avoid kitchen mishaps. For more handy conversions, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Using the correct amount of condensed milk can make or break a recipe. Too much can cause excessive browning, while too little may leave your dish lacking flavour. Air fryers cook food quickly, so precision is key. If you’re experimenting with new recipes, always measure ingredients like condensed milk carefully. Visit <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>our recipe collection</a> for tried-and-tested ideas.</p>  

<p>Condensed milk is a staple in many desserts, from fudgy brownies to creamy cheesecakes. Knowing that 2 tbsp equals 40 grams simplifies scaling recipes up or down. This is especially useful when adapting traditional oven recipes for the air fryer. For more dessert inspiration, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>cake recipes</a>.</p>  

<h3>How to measure condensed milk correctly</h3>  
<p>For the most accurate results, use a digital kitchen scale to weigh your condensed milk. If you don’t have one, spoon the condensed milk into a measuring tablespoon and level it off. Avoid packing it down, as this can lead to over-measuring. Keeping your air fryer clean is also crucial—check out our guide on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaning</a> for tips.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for condensed milk in air fryer recipes</h2>  
<p>Condensed milk adds richness to many air fryer dishes, from sticky buns to caramelised bananas. Its thick consistency helps bind ingredients together, making it ideal for no-bake treats. If you’re making a batch of cookies, 2 tbsp (40g) of condensed milk can enhance both texture and sweetness. Discover more sweet treats in our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert section</a>.</p>  

<p>Savory dishes can also benefit from a touch of condensed milk. A small amount can balance spicy or tangy flavours in marinades or glazes. Since air fryers circulate hot air efficiently, condensed milk-based coatings crisp up beautifully. For more creative ideas, browse our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>homepage</a>.</p>  

<h3>Storing condensed milk for air fryer recipes</h3>  
<p>Once opened, condensed milk should be stored in an airtight container in the fridge. This prevents it from drying out or developing off-flavours. If your recipe calls for 2 tbsp (40g), measure it straight from the fridge for best results. Proper storage ensures your air fryer creations turn out perfectly every time.</p>

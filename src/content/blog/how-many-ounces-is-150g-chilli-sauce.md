<h2>Why Convert 150g of Chilli Sauce to Ounces?</h2>  
<p>Many UK recipes, especially those for air fryers, list ingredients in grams, while some kitchen scales or international recipes use ounces. Converting 150g of chilli sauce to ounces ensures accuracy, preventing overly spicy or bland results. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we recommend using precise measurements for consistent flavour.</p>

<h2>How to Measure 150g of Chilli Sauce Accurately</h2>  
<p>Using a digital kitchen scale is the easiest way to measure 150g of chilli sauce. Set your scale to grams, tare the container, and pour until you hit 150g. If your scale only shows ounces, aim for 5.29 oz instead.</p>  

<h3>Using Measuring Spoons or Cups</h3>

<h2>How to Measure 3.5 Cups of Orange Juice Correctly</h2>  
<p>To measure 3.5 cups of orange juice accurately, use a liquid measuring cup with clear markings. Fill it to the 3-cup line first, then add another half cup. If you don’t have a measuring cup, a standard UK metric jug works too—just pour until you reach 828 ml. Avoid using dry measuring cups, as they won’t give you the exact liquid volume needed for recipes like our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>citrus-glazed chicken</a>.</p>

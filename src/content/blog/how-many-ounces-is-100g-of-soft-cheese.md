<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>

If you're experimenting with new dishes, browse our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a> for inspiration.</p>  

<h3>How to measure soft cheese without scales</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a kitchen scale, you can estimate 100g of soft cheese using tablespoons. One tablespoon of soft cheese weighs roughly 15g, so 6.5 tablespoons equal 100g (or 3.53 oz). This method isn’t as precise but works in a pinch for recipes like air fryer stuffed mushrooms or cheesecake bites.</p>  

<h2>Common air fryer recipes using 100g of soft cheese</h2>

<h3>Tips for storing soft cheese</h3>

<h2>Converting other cheese types</h2>

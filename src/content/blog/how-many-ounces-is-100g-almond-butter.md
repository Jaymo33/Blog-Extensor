<p>100g of almond butter equals approximately 3.53 ounces. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes, baking, or meal prep where precise measurements matter. Whether you're whipping up a batch of almond butter cookies or adding it to a savoury dish, knowing the exact weight ensures perfect results every time. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we help simplify conversions so you can focus on cooking.</p>  

<h2>Why Convert 100g of Almond Butter to Ounces?</h2>  
<p>Many UK recipes use grams, while others rely on ounces, especially older cookbooks or international guides. Converting 100g of almond butter to ounces (3.53 oz) ensures accuracy, particularly in air fryer cooking where ingredient ratios affect texture and taste. Almond butter’s density means slight measurement errors can alter a dish’s consistency. For example, too much almond butter in energy balls might make them overly sticky. Check our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for other common ingredient swaps.</p>  

<p>Precision is key in baking—whether you're making almond butter brownies or protein bars. A digital kitchen scale is the best tool for grams-to-ounces conversions, but if you’re in a pinch, remember that 100g almond butter is roughly 3.5 oz. For more air fryer-friendly recipes, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipes section</a>.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure Almond Butter Without a Scale</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a scale, use volume measurements: 100g of almond butter is about 6 tablespoons. However, this can vary slightly depending on the brand’s thickness. Stirring natural almond butter before measuring ensures consistency. For sticky ingredients like almond butter, lightly grease your measuring spoon to help it slide out easily. Need more tips? Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner guide</a> also covers kitchen hacks for messy ingredients.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for 100g of Almond Butter</h2>  
<p>100g (3.53 oz) of almond butter is perfect for single-serving recipes. Try it in air-fryer granola, drizzle it over roasted vegetables, or blend it into smoothies. It’s also a great base for vegan sauces—mix with soy sauce, garlic, and a splash of water for a nutty stir-fry glaze. For inspiration, browse our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert category</a>, featuring almond butter cookies and cakes.</p>  

<p>Almond butter’s rich flavour enhances both sweet and savoury dishes. Use 100g to make a batch of energy balls with oats and honey, or add it to overnight oats for extra protein. In savoury cooking, it pairs well with chicken or tofu—brush it on before air frying for a caramelised crust.

<h3>Storing Almond Butter for Freshness</h3>  
<p>After measuring 100g of almond butter, store the rest in a cool, dark place to prevent oil separation. Natural almond butter may require stirring before each use. For longer shelf life, refrigerate it—just note that chilled almond butter thickens, so adjust measurements if using it straight from the fridge.</p>

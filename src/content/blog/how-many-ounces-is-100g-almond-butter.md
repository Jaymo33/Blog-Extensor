<h3>Storing Almond Butter for Freshness</h3>  
<p>After measuring 100g of almond butter, store the rest in a cool, dark place to prevent oil separation. Natural almond butter may require stirring before each use. For longer shelf life, refrigerate it—just note that chilled almond butter thickens, so adjust measurements if using it straight from the fridge.</p>

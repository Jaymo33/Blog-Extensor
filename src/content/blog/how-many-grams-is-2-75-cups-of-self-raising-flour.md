Whether you're following a recipe from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> or adjusting measurements, knowing the exact weight ensures perfect results every time.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Flour Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Baking is a science, and even small measurement errors can lead to dense or dry results. Self-raising flour contains baking powder, so precision is crucial. If you're using an air fryer for baking, like the recipes found on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes</a>, grams provide a more reliable measurement than cups. A digital kitchen scale removes guesswork and guarantees consistency.</p>  

<p>Many UK bakers prefer weighing ingredients, as cup measurements can vary based on how the flour is scooped. For air fryer recipes, especially cakes or muffins, 330 grams of self-raising flour ensures the right rise and texture.

<h3>How to Measure 2.75 Cups of Self-Raising Flour</h3>  
<p>To measure 2.75 cups of self-raising flour accurately, fluff the flour with a spoon before lightly scooping it into a measuring cup. Level off the excess with a knife for consistency. However, weighing 330 grams on a scale is far more reliable, especially for air fryer baking where even heat distribution affects outcomes.</p>  

<h2>Converting Cups to Grams for Different Flours</h2>  
<p>Not all flours weigh the same per cup. While 2.75 cups of self-raising flour is 330 grams, plain flour is slightly heavier at around 345 grams for the same volume. This difference matters in recipes, particularly for air fryer baking where texture is key. Always refer to a trusted conversion guide, like the one on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, for precise measurements.</p>  

<p>If you're adapting a US recipe, note that UK self-raising flour may have a different rising agent concentration. For best results, stick to weight measurements.

<h3>Common Mistakes When Measuring Flour</h3>

<h2>Using Self-Raising Flour in Air Fryer Recipes</h2>

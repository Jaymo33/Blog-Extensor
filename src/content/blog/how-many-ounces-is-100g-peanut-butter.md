<p>100g of peanut butter equals approximately 3.53 ounces. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements can make or break your dish. Whether you're whipping up peanut butter cookies or a savoury satay sauce, knowing the exact weight ensures consistency. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we focus on accuracy to help you achieve the best results. Let’s dive deeper into why this conversion matters and how to use it effectively.</p>

<h2>Why converting 100g of peanut butter to ounces matters</h2>
<p>Accurate measurements are crucial in cooking, especially when using an air fryer. Peanut butter’s density means 100g can look different depending on how it’s scooped or packed. Converting 100g of peanut butter to ounces (3.53 oz) eliminates guesswork and ensures your recipes turn out perfectly. This is particularly important for baked goods like peanut butter cookies, where texture is key. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more handy measurements.</p>

<p>Many UK recipes use grams, while others rely on ounces, so knowing both is helpful. If you’re adapting a recipe from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>our collection</a>, this conversion ensures you won’t end up with overly dense or runny results. Peanut butter’s sticky nature makes it tricky to measure by volume, so weight is far more reliable. Whether you’re making a dessert or a marinade, 100g peanut butter to ounces is a conversion worth memorising.</p>

<h3>How to measure 100g of peanut butter accurately</h3>
<p>For the most precise measurement, use a digital kitchen scale set to grams. Scoop the peanut butter into a bowl until the scale reads 100g, then note that this equals 3.53 ounces. If your scale only measures in ounces, aim for 3.5 oz for a close approximation. Avoid using measuring cups for peanut butter, as packing density can vary wildly. For more tips on perfect measurements, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert recipes</a> where precision is key.</p>

<h2>Common uses for 100g of peanut butter in air fryer recipes</h2>
<p>100g of peanut butter (or 3.53 oz) is a versatile amount for many air fryer dishes. It’s enough for a batch of peanut butter cookies, a satay sauce for chicken skewers, or a rich glaze for tofu. The air fryer’s even heat distribution ensures peanut butter-based recipes cook uniformly. If you’re making peanut butter granola or energy bites, this measurement is a great starting point. Visit <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> for creative ways to use this quantity in your cooking.</p>

<p>Peanut butter’s high fat content means it can burn easily in the air fryer, so watch cooking times closely. At 100g (3.53 oz), it’s enough to add flavour without overwhelming other ingredients. For cleaning sticky peanut butter residue, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner guide</a> has you covered. Whether you’re baking, frying, or making sauces, knowing that 100g equals 3.53 ounces takes the stress out of recipe adjustments.</p>

<h3>Converting other peanut butter amounts</h3>
<p>Once you know 100g of peanut butter is 3.53 oz, scaling up or down becomes easy. For example, 50g would be 1.76 oz, while 200g equals 7.05 oz. This knowledge is handy when modifying portion sizes or trying new recipes. Many air fryer recipes call for peanut butter in these increments, so having the conversions at your fingertips saves time. Keep this guide bookmarked for whenever you need to convert 100 grams of peanut butter to ounces quickly.</p>

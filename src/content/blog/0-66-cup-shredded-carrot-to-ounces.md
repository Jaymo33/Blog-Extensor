<h3>Converting Other Carrot Measurements</h3>  
<p>If your recipe calls for grated or diced carrot instead of shredded, note that the weight may vary slightly due to density. For example, 0.66 cup of grated carrot could weigh closer to 3 ounces. Always double-check conversions when switching between preparation methods to maintain recipe accuracy.</p>  

<h2>Tips for Storing Shredded Carrot</h2>  
<p>To keep shredded carrot fresh for future air fryer recipes, store it in an airtight container with a paper towel to absorb excess moisture. Properly stored, it lasts up to 5 days in the fridge. For longer storage, freeze portions in 2.64-ounce (0.66 cup) batches—perfect for quick meal prep.</p>  

<p>Pre-shredded carrots from the supermarket are convenient but often drier than freshly shredded ones. If using store-bought, you might need a touch more moisture in your recipe. For more meal prep ideas, visit <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>.</p>

<p>30 grams (30g) of sesame oil equals approximately 1.06 ounces (oz). This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements can make or break your dish. Whether you're drizzling sesame oil over roasted vegetables or using it in a marinade, knowing the exact weight ensures perfect results every time.</p>  

<h2>Why Convert 30g of Sesame Oil to Ounces?</h2>  
<p>Many air fryer recipes, especially those from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, use metric measurements like grams. However, if your kitchen scale measures in ounces, converting 30g of sesame oil to oz is crucial. This small but mighty ingredient adds depth to dishes like stir-fries, dressings, and even baked goods. Getting the measurement right ensures balanced flavours and avoids overpowering your meal.</p>  
<p>Sesame oil is denser than water, so volume measurements (like tablespoons) aren’t always accurate. Weight is the most reliable method, especially for air fryer cooking where consistency matters. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for other common ingredient conversions.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure 30g of Sesame Oil Without a Scale</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a kitchen scale, you can approximate 30g of sesame oil using volume. One tablespoon of sesame oil weighs about 14g, so 30g is roughly 2 tablespoons plus ½ teaspoon. However, for precision in recipes like those on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>airfryerrecipe.co.uk’s chicken category</a>, a scale is best.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for 30g of Sesame Oil in Air Fryers</h2>  
<p>30g of sesame oil is perfect for marinating proteins like chicken or tofu before air frying. It’s also ideal for tossing vegetables like broccoli or Brussels sprouts for a crispy, flavourful finish. Many <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable-based air fryer recipes</a> call for this amount to enhance taste without greasiness.</p>  
<p>You can also use 30g of sesame oil to make dressings or dipping sauces. Its rich, nutty flavour pairs well with soy sauce, garlic, and ginger—common ingredients in air fryer-friendly Asian dishes. For more inspiration, browse our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a>.</p>  

<h3>Does Sesame Oil Smoke in the Air Fryer?</h3>  
<p>Sesame oil has a lower smoke point than some oils (around 210°C), so it’s best used for low to medium-heat air frying or as a finishing oil. For high-heat cooking, blend it with a higher smoke point oil like avocado or peanut oil.</p>  

<h2>Storing Sesame Oil for Longevity</h2>  
<p>To keep sesame oil fresh, store it in a cool, dark place. Once opened, refrigerate it to extend its shelf life. Proper storage ensures your 30g measurements remain consistent in flavour and quality for future air fryer creations.</p>

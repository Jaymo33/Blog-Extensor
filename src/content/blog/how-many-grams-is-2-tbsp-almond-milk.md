<p>2 tablespoons (tbsp) of almond milk equals approximately 30 grams (g). This conversion is handy for air fryer recipes where precise measurements matter. Whether you're whipping up a cake or a savoury dish, knowing the exact weight ensures consistency. Almond milk is a popular dairy-free alternative, and its light texture works brilliantly in air fryer cooking. For more conversions, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>
<p>Using the correct amount of almond milk can make or break your air fryer recipe. Too much liquid can lead to soggy results, while too little might dry out your dish. Almond milk, being lighter than dairy milk, requires careful measurement. Many <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> rely on precise ratios for perfect texture and flavour. Converting 2 tbsp of almond milk to grams helps avoid guesswork.</p>

<p>Air fryers circulate hot air rapidly, so ingredient proportions are crucial. A slight imbalance can affect cooking times and outcomes. For example, baking a cake with 30g of almond milk instead of a rough tablespoon estimate ensures even rising. If you're new to air frying, start with accurate measurements for foolproof results. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert recipes</a> often use almond milk for lighter bakes.</p>

<h2>How to measure almond milk without scales</h2>
<p>If you don’t have kitchen scales, you can still measure 2 tbsp of almond milk accurately. Use a standard UK tablespoon, which holds 15ml of liquid. Fill it level to the brim for an exact measure. Two tablespoons will give you roughly 30g of almond milk. This method works well for most <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/breakfast>breakfast recipes</a> like pancakes or granola.</p>

<h3>Converting other almond milk quantities</h3>
<p>Need to scale up or down? Here’s a quick reference: 1 tbsp almond milk = 15g, 3 tbsp = 45g, and ¼ cup (4 tbsp) = 60g. These conversions are useful for batch cooking or adjusting serving sizes. Almond milk’s consistency can vary by brand, so stick to the same one for consistent results.

<h2>Common uses for almond milk in air fryer recipes</h2>
<p>Almond milk is a versatile ingredient in air fryer cooking. It’s great for soaking oats, thinning batters, or adding moisture to baked goods. Try it in vegan muffins, dairy-free sauces, or even crispy coatings for tofu. The mild flavour won’t overpower other ingredients, making it ideal for both sweet and savoury dishes. Many of our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable-based recipes</a> use almond milk for creamy textures without dairy.</p>

<p>For best results, shake the almond milk carton well before measuring. Separation is natural, and a good mix ensures uniform consistency. Unsweetened varieties work best for savoury dishes, while vanilla-flavoured can enhance desserts. Remember, 2 tbsp (30g) is your go-to measure for small batches.

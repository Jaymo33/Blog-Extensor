<p>985 ml of chicken broth equals approximately 4.16 cups in the US measurement system or 3.46 cups in the UK system. Whether you're preparing a hearty soup or a flavourful risotto in your air fryer, accurate measurements ensure the best results. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we know how crucial precision is for air fryer cooking, so let’s break this down.</p>  

<h2>Understanding Cup Measurements for Chicken Broth</h2>  
<p>Chicken broth is a staple in many recipes, from soups to casseroles. Knowing how to convert millilitres to cups helps avoid guesswork. In the US, 1 cup equals 240 ml, while in the UK, it’s 284 ml. This means 985 ml of chicken broth converts to roughly 4.16 US cups or 3.46 UK cups. Always check your recipe’s origin to ensure accuracy.</p>  

<p>For air fryer recipes, liquid measurements matter—too much broth can make dishes soggy, while too little dries them out. If you’re adapting a traditional recipe for your air fryer, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> simplifies adjustments. Whether you’re making a chicken stew or a savoury gravy, precise measurements guarantee success.</p>  

<h3>Why Accurate Conversions Matter</h3>  
<p>Using the wrong cup measurement can throw off a recipe’s balance. For example, 985 ml of chicken broth in a UK recipe measured with US cups adds extra liquid, potentially diluting flavours. Air fryer cooking relies on even heat distribution, so consistency is key. Always double-check whether your recipe uses metric or imperial measurements.</p>  

<h2>Converting 985 ml of Chicken Broth for Cooking</h2>  
<p>If your recipe calls for 985 ml of chicken broth, you’ll need about 4 and 1/6 US cups or 3 and 1/2 UK cups. Measuring cups with clear ml and cup markings help, but a kitchen scale is even more precise. For air fryer-friendly dishes like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipes</a>, accuracy ensures perfect texture and taste.</p>  

<p>When scaling recipes, remember that 985 ml is just under a litre (1000 ml). This is useful for batch cooking or meal prep. If you’re reheating broth-based dishes in the air fryer, check our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a> for time and temperature tips. Proper measurements prevent overcooking or uneven results.</p>  

<h3>Tips for Measuring Chicken Broth</h3>  
<p>For sticky or thick broths, lightly grease your measuring cup to ensure all liquid pours out. If substituting stock cubes or powder for 985 ml of liquid broth, follow package instructions for dilution. Air fryer recipes often need less liquid than oven-baked ones, so adjust accordingly. Visit <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> for tailored advice on adapting recipes.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for 985 ml of Chicken Broth</h2>  
<p>This quantity is ideal for soups, risottos, or braising meats in the air fryer. For example, a creamy chicken and mushroom dish might use exactly 985 ml. If you’re cooking for a crowd, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/meal-prep>meal prep guides</a> help scale recipes efficiently. Remember, reducing broth intensifies flavour, so adjust cooking times if simmering.</p>  

<p>For cleaning your air fryer after cooking with broth, avoid harsh scrubs. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning guide</a> keeps your appliance in top shape. Whether you’re converting 985 ml of chicken broth for a family dinner or experimenting with new dishes, precise measurements make all the difference.</p>

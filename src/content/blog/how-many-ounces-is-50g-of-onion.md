<p>50g of onion equals approximately 1.76 ounces. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes, where precise measurements can make or break your dish. Whether you’re making crispy onion rings or adding onions to a stir-fry, knowing the exact weight ensures consistency. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we focus on helping you get the best results with accurate conversions and easy-to-follow guides.</p>

<h2>Why accurate onion measurements matter in air frying</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on even cooking, and the right amount of onion ensures your dish isn’t too soggy or dry. Too much onion can release excess moisture, while too little might leave your meal lacking flavour. For recipes like air-fried onion bhajis or caramelised onions, 50g (1.76 oz) is a common starting point. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more handy weight conversions to simplify your cooking process.</p>  

<p>Using a digital kitchen scale is the best way to measure 50g of onion accurately. If you don’t have one, roughly half a medium-sized onion equals 50g.

<h3>How to convert 50g of onion to ounces</h3>  
<p>The conversion from grams to ounces is straightforward: 1 gram equals 0.035 ounces. So, 50g multiplied by 0.035 gives you 1.76 ounces. This measurement is particularly useful for UK cooks following international recipes. If you’re prepping multiple servings, simply scale up the amount—100g of onion would be 3.53 ounces, for example.</p>  

<h3>Common recipes using 50g of onion</h3>  
<p>Many air fryer recipes call for 50g of onion, such as stuffed peppers, fajitas, or homemade onion powder. For inspiration, browse our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a>, where precise measurements help you achieve perfect results every time. Whether you’re a beginner or a seasoned cook, accurate conversions like 50g to ounces take the guesswork out of cooking.</p>  

<h2>Tips for measuring onions without a scale</h2>  
<p>If you don’t have a scale, you can estimate 50g of onion by volume. Finely chopped onion fills about half a US cup, while sliced onion fills roughly two-thirds of a cup. Keep in mind that onion density varies, so these are rough estimates. For best results, invest in a cheap digital scale—they’re a game-changer for air fryer cooking.</p>  

<p>Another handy trick is to remember that one small onion typically weighs around 100g, so half of it will be close to 50g.

<h3>Why UK cooks need this conversion</h3>  
<p>Many UK recipes use grams, while older or American recipes often list ingredients in ounces. Knowing that 50g of onion is 1.76 ounces helps bridge the gap between measurement systems. This is especially useful when adapting family favourites or trying trending dishes from across the pond.</p>  

<h3>Storing leftover onion portions</h3>  
<p>If you only need 50g of onion for a recipe, store the rest in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 5 days. You can also freeze chopped onion in 50g portions for future use—perfect for quick midweek air fryer meals. Just remember to adjust cooking times slightly as frozen onions release more moisture.</p>

<h2>Why accurate sugar measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>
<p>Using the right amount of caster sugar is crucial for air fryer recipes. Too much sugar can cause burning, while too little might leave your dish lacking in sweetness. The air fryer's intense heat means ingredients behave differently compared to conventional ovens. That's why precise measurements, like knowing 15g of caster sugar is 0.53 ounces, are so important.</p>
<p>At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we've found that many baking recipes require small amounts of sugar for glazes or toppings.

<p>Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> includes common measurements like this one, helping you adapt any recipe for your air fryer. Remember that caster sugar is finer than granulated, so volume measurements can vary slightly.</p>

<p>1.5 cups of rice flour equals approximately 6.35 ounces (oz) in the UK measurement system. Whether you're whipping up gluten-free treats or perfecting crispy coatings for air fryer dishes, precise measurements are key. Rice flour, a staple in many kitchens, behaves differently than wheat flour, so getting the conversion right ensures your recipes turn out just as intended.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter for Air Fryer Recipes</h2>  
<p>Using the correct amount of rice flour can make or break your air fryer creations. Too much flour can lead to dry, crumbly results, while too little might not provide the desired texture. For example, if you're making air fryer onion rings or gluten-free chicken tenders, the coating relies heavily on the right flour ratio. That’s why knowing how many ounces are in 1.5 cups of rice flour is so important.</p>

<h2>How to Measure Rice Flour Correctly</h2>  
<p>Measuring rice flour isn’t as straightforward as scooping it straight from the bag. For the most accurate results, spoon the flour into your measuring cup and level it off with a knife. This prevents packing too much flour into the cup, which can throw off your recipe. If you’re using a kitchen scale, 1.5 cups of rice flour should weigh around 6.35 ounces.</p>  

<h3>Common Uses for Rice Flour in Air Fryers</h3>

Knowing the exact conversion from cups to ounces ensures consistency across all your dishes.</p>

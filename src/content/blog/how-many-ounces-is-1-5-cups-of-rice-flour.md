<p>1.5 cups of rice flour equals approximately 6.35 ounces (oz) in the UK measurement system. Whether you're whipping up gluten-free treats or perfecting crispy coatings for air fryer dishes, precise measurements are key. Rice flour, a staple in many kitchens, behaves differently than wheat flour, so getting the conversion right ensures your recipes turn out just as intended.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter for Air Fryer Recipes</h2>  
<p>Using the correct amount of rice flour can make or break your air fryer creations. Too much flour can lead to dry, crumbly results, while too little might not provide the desired texture. For example, if you're making air fryer onion rings or gluten-free chicken tenders, the coating relies heavily on the right flour ratio. That’s why knowing how many ounces are in 1.5 cups of rice flour is so important.</p>  

<p>At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we emphasise precision in every recipe. Whether you're baking or frying, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> helps you switch between cups, grams, and ounces effortlessly. This ensures your dishes, from crispy tofu to fluffy cakes, come out perfectly every time.</p>  

<h2>How to Measure Rice Flour Correctly</h2>  
<p>Measuring rice flour isn’t as straightforward as scooping it straight from the bag. For the most accurate results, spoon the flour into your measuring cup and level it off with a knife. This prevents packing too much flour into the cup, which can throw off your recipe. If you’re using a kitchen scale, 1.5 cups of rice flour should weigh around 6.35 ounces.</p>  

<h3>Common Uses for Rice Flour in Air Fryers</h3>  
<p>Rice flour is a versatile ingredient, especially in gluten-free cooking. It’s perfect for coating chicken, fish, or vegetables before air frying, giving them a light, crispy texture. You’ll also find it in many <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer dessert recipes</a>, like mochi or shortbread. Knowing the exact conversion from cups to ounces ensures consistency across all your dishes.</p>  

<h2>Converting Other Rice Flour Measurements</h2>  
<p>If your recipe calls for a different amount of rice flour, here’s a quick reference: 1 cup of rice flour equals roughly 4.23 ounces, while 2 cups equal about 8.47 ounces. These conversions are handy when scaling recipes up or down, especially if you’re meal prepping or cooking for a crowd.</p>

Accurate measurements and proper maintenance go hand in hand for kitchen success.</p>  

<h3>Why Rice Flour Works So Well in Air Fryers</h3>  
<p>Rice flour’s fine texture and lack of gluten make it ideal for air frying. It crisps up beautifully without becoming greasy, making it a healthier alternative to traditional frying. Whether you’re making tempura vegetables or gluten-free cookies, 1.5 cups of rice flour (6.35 ounces) will give you the perfect base for your recipe.</p>

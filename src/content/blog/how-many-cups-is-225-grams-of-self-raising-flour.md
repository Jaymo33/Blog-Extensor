<p>225 grams of self-raising flour equals approximately 1.8 cups when measured correctly. This conversion is essential for air fryer baking, where precise measurements can make or break your recipe. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we know how frustrating inaccurate conversions can be, so we've created this detailed guide to help you measure with confidence.</p>

<h2>Understanding Self-Raising Flour Measurements</h2>
<p>Self-raising flour is a staple in British baking, containing added raising agents that help cakes and batters rise. When converting 225 grams of self-raising flour to cups, it's important to note that the measurement can vary slightly depending on how you scoop the flour. The most accurate method is to spoon the flour into the measuring cup and level it off with a knife, rather than scooping directly from the bag.</p>
<p>For air fryer recipes, precise measurements are even more crucial due to the appliance's compact cooking space. A slight variation in flour quantity can affect how your baked goods rise and cook. That's why we recommend using digital scales for the most accurate results, especially when trying new recipes from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>our collection</a>.</p>

<h3>Why 225 Grams Is a Common Measurement</h3>
<p>225 grams of self-raising flour is equivalent to 8 ounces or half a pound, making it a standard quantity in many British recipes. This amount is perfect for small batches of scones, cupcakes, or fairy cakes - all of which cook beautifully in an air fryer. When converted to cups, this measurement gives you consistent results whether you're baking traditional oven recipes or adapting them for your air fryer.</p>

<h2>Converting Grams to Cups Accurately</h2>
<p>While 225 grams of self-raising flour generally equals about 1.8 cups, several factors can influence this conversion. The type of cup you use (US vs UK), how packed the flour is, and even humidity levels can affect the measurement. For absolute precision in your air fryer baking, we suggest using our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> as a reliable reference.</p>
<p>If you don't have scales handy, remember that 1 cup of self-raising flour typically weighs around 125 grams. This means 225 grams would be just under 2 cups. However, for delicate recipes like sponge cakes or soufflés where exact proportions matter, weighing your ingredients will always give you better results than cup measurements.</p>

<h3>Tips for Measuring Self-Raising Flour</h3>
<p>When measuring 225 grams of self-raising flour for air fryer recipes, always fluff the flour in its container first to aerate it. Spoon the flour gently into your measuring cup without packing it down, then level off the top with a straight edge. This technique helps prevent using too much flour, which can make your baked goods dense - particularly important in air fryers where space is limited.</p>

<h2>Air Fryer Baking With Self-Raising Flour</h2>
<p>Converting 225 grams of self-raising flour to cups is just the first step in successful air fryer baking. The appliance's rapid air circulation means your recipes may cook faster than traditional methods. When adapting oven recipes for your air fryer, consider reducing the temperature by about 20°C and checking for doneness a few minutes earlier than the recipe suggests.</p>

<h3>Troubleshooting Common Issues</h3>
<p>If your air fryer baked goods made with 225 grams of self-raising flour aren't rising properly, check that your flour is fresh. Self-raising flour loses its raising power over time, especially if not stored in an airtight container. Also ensure you're not overmixing the batter, as this can knock out the air bubbles needed for a good rise in the confined space of an air fryer basket.</p>

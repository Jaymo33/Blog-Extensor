<h2>Why converting 50g rolled oats to ounces matters</h2>  
<p>Accurate measurements are crucial for air fryer recipes, as even small discrepancies can affect texture and cooking times. Rolled oats, commonly used in granola, flapjacks, or crumbles, need the right balance to crisp up perfectly in the air fryer.

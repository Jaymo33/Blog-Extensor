<h3>How to measure almond milk correctly</h3>  
<p>For the most accurate results, use a liquid measuring cup placed on a flat surface. Fill it to the 3-cup mark without tilting, and you’ll have precisely 24 ounces of almond milk. This method avoids over-pouring, which can throw off your recipe. If you’re working with smaller quantities, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a> simplifies scaling.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for 3 cups of almond milk in air fryer recipes</h2>

<p>1.5 tablespoons (tbsp) of double cream weighs approximately 22.5 grams. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precision ensures the best texture and flavour. Whether you’re making a creamy pasta sauce or a decadent dessert, knowing the exact weight helps avoid kitchen mishaps.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on even heat distribution, and incorrect ingredient quantities can throw off cooking times and results. Using 1.5 tbsp of double cream without converting to grams might lead to overly rich or thin dishes. For perfect consistency, always measure ingredients like double cream accurately. You’ll find more tips on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>our conversion chart</a>.</p>  

<p>Double cream is thicker than single cream, so its weight per tablespoon differs slightly. While 1 tbsp of double cream is about 15 grams, 1.5 tbsp comes to roughly 22.5 grams. This small difference can impact recipes, especially when baking air fryer cakes or custards. For more dessert ideas, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>cake recipes</a>.</p>  

<h3>How to measure 1.5 tbsp of double cream accurately</h3>  
<p>For the best results, use a digital kitchen scale to weigh your double cream. If you don’t have one, fill a tablespoon halfway for the extra 0.5 tbsp. Remember, slight variations can occur based on cream density, so weighing is always more reliable. Check out our guide on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> for more measurement tips.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for 1.5 tbsp of double cream in air fryer recipes</h2>  
<p>This small quantity of double cream is perfect for enriching sauces, glazes, or even adding moisture to baked goods. For example, a creamy garlic sauce for air-fried chicken or a dollop in mashed potatoes can elevate your dish. Find inspiration in our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipes</a>.</p>  

<p>If you’re reheating leftovers, a splash of double cream can revive dried-out dishes. Just 1.5 tbsp (22.5 grams) can transform a basic pasta bake into something luxurious.

<h3>Converting other cream measurements</h3>  
<p>If your recipe calls for a different amount, here’s a quick reference: 1 tbsp = 15 grams, 2 tbsp = 30 grams, and so on. Keep this in mind when adjusting portion sizes for air fryer meals. Precision ensures your dishes turn out perfectly every time.</p>

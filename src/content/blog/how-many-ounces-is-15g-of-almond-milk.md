<h3>Using Almond Milk in Air Fryer Recipes</h3>

<h2>Common Conversions for Almond Milk</h2>

<h3>Tips for Storing Almond Milk</h3>  
<p>Once opened, almond milk should be refrigerated and used within 7-10 days. Shake well before measuring, as separation can occur. If you’re using it in air fryer recipes, room-temperature almond milk blends better with other ingredients.</p>  

<h2>Why Accuracy Matters in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers cook food quickly and evenly, but only if the ingredients are measured correctly. Too much liquid can lead to steaming instead of crisping. Whether you’re converting 15g of almond milk to ounces or adjusting portion sizes, precision ensures perfect results.</p>

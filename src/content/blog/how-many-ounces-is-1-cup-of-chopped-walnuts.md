<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air frying</h2>  
<p>Using the correct amount of chopped walnuts can make or break your air fryer recipe. Too much can lead to uneven cooking, while too little might leave your dish lacking flavour. Air fryers rely on hot air circulation, so ingredient ratios are crucial. If you're new to air frying, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a> offers plenty of inspiration. Always measure ingredients like chopped walnuts carefully for consistent results.</p>  

<p>Chopped walnuts add texture and richness to both sweet and savoury dishes. From coating fish to topping desserts, knowing the weight in ounces helps streamline prep. A kitchen scale is handy, but if you're using cups, remember that 1 cup equals roughly 4 ounces.

<h3>How to measure chopped walnuts correctly</h3>

<p>2.5 cups of baking powder equals approximately 20 ounces. This conversion is essential for precise baking, especially when using an air fryer for cakes, cookies, or other treats. Accurate measurements ensure your recipes turn out perfectly every time, whether you’re following a classic cake recipe or experimenting with new air fryer creations.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Baking</h2>  
<p>Baking powder is a leavening agent, and using the right amount is crucial for achieving the perfect rise in your baked goods. Too little, and your cakes or cookies may turn out dense. Too much, and they could collapse or taste bitter. When using an air fryer, precise measurements like converting 2.5 cups of baking powder to ounces (20 oz) help maintain consistency across recipes.</p>  
<p>For example, if you’re making air fryer cupcakes or muffins, the correct amount of baking powder ensures a light, fluffy texture. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> for inspiration on how to use these measurements in delicious desserts.</p>

<h3>How to Measure 2.5 Cups of Baking Powder Correctly</h3>  
<p>To measure 2.5 cups of baking powder accurately, use a dry measuring cup and level it off with a straight edge. Scooping directly from the container can compact the powder, leading to an incorrect measurement. For best results, weigh it on a kitchen scale—20 ounces is the precise weight for 2.5 cups.</p>

<h2>Common Uses for 2.5 Cups of Baking Powder</h2>  
<p>This quantity is often used in large-batch baking, such as for multiple cakes or a big batch of cookies. If you’re meal prepping or hosting, knowing that 2.5 cups of baking powder equals 20 ounces helps streamline your cooking process. It’s also handy for scaling recipes up or down depending on your needs.</p>  
<p>For instance, if you’re preparing a big batch of air fryer cookies, you might need to adjust the recipe. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> can help you make these adjustments effortlessly.</p>

<h3>Converting Other Baking Powder Quantities</h3>  
<p>If you need to convert smaller or larger amounts, the same principle applies: 1 cup of baking powder equals 8 ounces. So, 1.5 cups would be 12 ounces, and 3 cups would be 24 ounces. This makes it easy to adapt any recipe, whether you’re baking a single cake or a large batch of desserts.</p>

<h2>Tips for Storing Baking Powder</h2>  
<p>To keep your baking powder fresh and effective, store it in an airtight container in a cool, dry place. Moisture can cause it to clump or lose its potency, which could affect your air fryer recipes. If you’re unsure whether your baking powder is still active, test it by mixing a teaspoon with hot water—if it bubbles, it’s still good to use.</p>

<h2>Why accurate flour measurements matter</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of flour is crucial for air fryer baking. Too much flour can make your cakes dense, while too little can leave them crumbly. The difference between 125g and 4.41 ounces might seem small, but it can impact texture and rise. Many UK recipes, especially those on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, use grams, so knowing the ounce equivalent helps if your scales only measure in imperial units. This conversion is also handy for following international recipes without hassle.</p>  

<p>Air fryers cook faster than conventional ovens, so precise measurements ensure even baking. If you're making cookies or muffins, 125g of plain flour (4.41 ounces) is a common base for small batches.

<h2>How to measure 125g of plain flour without scales</h2>  
<p>If you don't have digital scales, you can still measure 125g of plain flour using a measuring cup. One UK cup of plain flour weighs about 120g, so 125g is roughly 1 cup plus 1 teaspoon. However, this method isn't as precise as weighing, as flour can settle or be packed differently. For best results, fluff the flour with a fork before scooping and level it off with a knife.</p>  

<h3>Using tablespoons for small adjustments</h3>  
<p>One tablespoon of plain flour weighs around 8g, so 125g would be roughly 15.5 tablespoons. This method works for small adjustments but isn't ideal for large quantities. If you're scaling up a recipe, investing in a digital scale is worth it for accuracy.</p>

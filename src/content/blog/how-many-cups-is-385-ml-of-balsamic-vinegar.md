<h3>Does Balsamic Vinegar Thicken When Heated in an Air Fryer?</h3>  
<p>Yes, balsamic vinegar reduces and thickens when heated, intensifying its flavour. If your recipe requires 385 ml of balsamic vinegar in cups (1.63 cups), remember that the volume will decrease as it cooks. This is particularly useful for glazes or sauces where a thicker consistency is desired. Always account for this reduction when measuring.</p>  

<h2>Common Mistakes When Measuring Balsamic Vinegar</h2>  
<p>One of the biggest mistakes is assuming all liquids measure the same. Balsamic vinegar is denser than water, so 385 ml won’t fill the same space as 385 ml of water. Always use a liquid measuring cup for accuracy. Another error is eyeballing measurements—while 385 ml of balsamic vinegar is roughly 1.63 cups, slight deviations can affect your dish.</p>  

<p>For best results, use a clear measuring cup and check the measurement at eye level. If you’re working with sticky balsamic vinegar, lightly grease the measuring cup to ensure it pours out completely.

<h3>How to Store Leftover Balsamic Vinegar</h3>

<h2>Why Accurate Flour Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Baking is a science, and even small measurement discrepancies can affect your results. Using 1.75 cups of plain flour without converting to ounces might lead to dense or dry baked goods. Air fryers, in particular, require precise ingredient ratios due to their rapid cooking method. A slight imbalance in flour can alter the texture of your <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer cakes</a> or bread. That’s why weighing flour in ounces is the gold standard for professional and home bakers alike.</p>  

<p>Measuring by weight eliminates inconsistencies caused by how flour is scooped or packed. One cup of sifted flour weighs less than a cup of densely packed flour, which is why volume measurements can be unreliable. For air fryer recipes, where even cooking is crucial, sticking to ounces ensures your <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>cakes</a> rise evenly and your cookies bake to perfection.</p>

Remember, 1.75 cups of plain flour converts to 7.7 oz, a handy figure to keep in mind for quick reference.</p>

<p>0.5 cup of greek yogurt equals approximately 4.4 ounces (or 4.4 oz). This measurement is crucial for air fryer recipes, where precise ingredient quantities can make all the difference. Whether you're whipping up a marinade or baking a healthy dessert, knowing this conversion ensures your dish turns out perfectly every time.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on precise cooking times and ingredient ratios to deliver crispy, evenly cooked results. Using the correct amount of greek yogurt—like 0.5 cup (4.4 oz)—can affect texture and moisture levels. For example, adding too much yogurt to a marinade might make your chicken soggy, while too little could leave it dry. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more handy measurement tips.</p>  

<p>Greek yogurt is a versatile ingredient in air fryer cooking, often used in dips, sauces, and even baked goods. Its thick consistency means it holds up well under high heat, making it ideal for recipes like air-fried chicken tenders or yogurt-marinated kebabs. If you're new to air frying, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a> for inspiration.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure 0.5 Cup of Greek Yogurt</h3>  
<p>To measure 0.5 cup of greek yogurt accurately, use a dry measuring cup or a kitchen scale. Scoop the yogurt into the cup and level it off with a straight edge for consistency. For even more precision, weigh it—4.4 oz is your target. This method is especially helpful for baking, where exact measurements are key.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for 0.5 Cup of Greek Yogurt in Air Fryer Recipes</h2>  
<p>Half a cup of greek yogurt (4.4 oz) is a common measurement in many air fryer dishes. It’s perfect for creating creamy marinades, such as for tandoori chicken or spiced lamb kebabs. You’ll find plenty of ideas in our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipes</a> section.</p>  

<p>Greek yogurt also works wonders in air-fried desserts, like yogurt cakes or fruit parfaits. Its tangy flavour balances sweetness, and its thickness helps bind ingredients. For a quick treat, try mixing 0.5 cup of greek yogurt with honey and freezing it for a creamy air-fryer-friendly dessert.</p>  

<h3>Converting Other Greek Yogurt Measurements</h3>  
<p>If your recipe calls for a different amount of greek yogurt, here’s a quick reference: 1 cup equals about 8.8 oz, while 1/4 cup is roughly 2.2 oz. Keep these conversions handy, especially when scaling recipes up or down for your air fryer.</p>  

<h2>Tips for Storing and Using Greek Yogurt</h2>  
<p>To keep your greek yogurt fresh, store it in an airtight container in the fridge. If you’ve measured out 0.5 cup (4.4 oz) and have leftovers, use them within a few days. Greek yogurt can also be frozen, though its texture may change slightly—perfect for smoothies or cooked dishes later.</p>  

<p>For cleaning your air fryer after cooking with yogurt-based recipes, check out our guide on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner</a> to keep your appliance in top condition. A well-maintained air fryer ensures better cooking results every time.</p>  

<h3>Nutritional Benefits of Greek Yogurt in Air Fryer Meals</h3>  
<p>Greek yogurt is packed with protein and probiotics, making it a healthy addition to air fryer meals. Using 0.5 cup (4.4 oz) in your recipes adds creaminess without excessive calories. It’s a great substitute for heavier ingredients like mayo or sour cream.</p>

<p>160 ml of evaporated milk is roughly 2/3 of a standard UK cup (240 ml) or just over 1/2 of a US cup (237 ml). This conversion is essential for baking and cooking, especially when using air fryers, where precise measurements can affect texture and taste. Whether you're making a creamy sauce or a rich dessert, knowing how to convert 160 ml of evaporated milk to cups ensures consistency in your recipes.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>When working with evaporated milk, even small measurement discrepancies can alter the outcome of your dish. Too much liquid can make batters runny, while too little can dry out baked goods. For air fryer recipes, where cooking times are shorter, precision is key to achieving the perfect texture. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more handy measurement tips.</p>  

<p>Evaporated milk is thicker and richer than regular milk, so substituting it incorrectly can throw off your recipe. If you're adapting a recipe from US measurements, remember that UK cups are slightly larger. This difference might seem minor, but it can impact the final result, especially in delicate desserts like custards or flans.</p>  

<h2>Converting 160 ml of Evaporated Milk to Cups</h2>  
<p>To convert 160 ml of evaporated milk to cups, use the following guidelines: In the UK, 1 cup equals 240 ml, so 160 ml is approximately 2/3 cup. In the US, 1 cup is 237 ml, making 160 ml just over 1/2 cup. For air fryer recipes, measuring accurately ensures even cooking and perfect results every time.</p>  

<h3>Using Measuring Tools</h3>  
<p>For the most accurate measurement, use a liquid measuring cup with clear markings. Pour the evaporated milk slowly to avoid spills and check at eye level. If you don’t have a measuring cup, a kitchen scale can help—160 ml of evaporated milk weighs about 170 grams. Explore more <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> that use precise measurements for flawless dishes.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for 160 ml of Evaporated Milk</h2>  
<p>This quantity is often used in small-batch recipes, such as single-serve desserts or sauces. In air fryer cooking, 160 ml of evaporated milk might be used for a creamy mac and cheese or a rich bread pudding. Its concentrated flavour adds depth without overwhelming other ingredients.</p>  

<p>For those who love baking, 160 ml of evaporated milk is perfect for small cakes or custards. If you're prepping ahead, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert recipes</a> for inspiration. Whether you're making a quick pudding or a layered trifle, precise measurements ensure success.</p>  

<h3>Adjusting Recipes for Air Fryers</h3>  
<p>Air fryers cook faster than conventional ovens, so recipes using 160 ml of evaporated milk may need slight adjustments. Reduce cooking times by 20% and check for doneness early. The concentrated sweetness of evaporated milk can also caramelise quickly, so keep an eye on your dish to prevent burning.</p>  

<h2>Tips for Storing Evaporated Milk</h2>  
<p>Once opened, transfer unused evaporated milk to an airtight container and refrigerate for up to five days. If your recipe calls for 160 ml but you’ve opened a larger can, consider freezing leftovers in ice cube trays for future use. Thawed evaporated milk works well in cooked dishes but may separate slightly in beverages.</p>

<p>1 cup of double cream equals approximately 8.45 ounces. This measurement is essential for precision in baking and cooking, especially when using an air fryer. Whether you're whipping up a dessert or adding richness to a savoury dish, knowing the exact weight ensures consistent results.

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter</h2>  
<p>Accurate measurements are crucial for achieving the perfect texture and flavour in your dishes. Double cream, with its high fat content, can significantly alter the outcome if not measured correctly. Too much can make a dish overly rich, while too little might leave it lacking. This is especially important in air fryer recipes, where precise ratios ensure even cooking. For more tips on perfecting your recipes, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a>.</p>  

<p>Measuring by weight (ounces) is often more reliable than volume (cups) because it accounts for variations in density. Double cream can vary slightly in thickness, so weighing it removes any guesswork. This is why many professional bakers prefer using scales. If you're serious about air fryer cooking, investing in a good kitchen scale is a game-changer.</p>  

<h3>How to measure double cream correctly</h3>  
<p>To measure 1 cup of double cream accurately, use a liquid measuring cup for volume or a kitchen scale for weight. If using a scale, set it to ounces and pour the cream until it reaches 8.45 oz. For sticky or thick creams, gently spoon it into the measuring cup to avoid air pockets. Level it off with a straight edge for precision. This method ensures your <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert recipes</a> turn out perfectly every time.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for double cream in air fryer recipes</h2>  
<p>Double cream is a versatile ingredient that adds richness to both sweet and savoury dishes. In air fryer cooking, it’s often used in sauces, custards, or as a topping for desserts. For example, a creamy garlic sauce for chicken or a decadent chocolate mousse can benefit from the precise measurement of double cream. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipes</a> for inspiration.</p>  

<p>Another popular use is in air fryer baking, where double cream helps create moist, tender cakes and scones. Since air fryers cook faster than conventional ovens, getting the measurements right is even more critical. Too much cream can lead to soggy results, while too little might dry out your bake.

<h3>Converting other cream measurements</h3>  
<p>If your recipe calls for a different amount of double cream, here’s a quick reference: ½ cup = 4.23 oz, ¼ cup = 2.11 oz, and 2 cups = 16.9 oz. These conversions are handy when scaling recipes up or down. Remember, air fryer cooking often requires adjustments, so always double-check your measurements.

<p>0.125 cup of lime juice equals exactly 1 fluid ounce (oz). This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements can make or break a dish. Whether you’re marinating chicken or adding a zesty kick to desserts, knowing the exact weight ensures consistency.</p>

<h2>Why accurate lime juice measurements matter</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of lime juice is crucial for balancing flavours in air fryer recipes. Too little, and your dish might lack tang; too much, and it could become overpowering. For example, a <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>lime-infused shrimp recipe</a> relies on precise measurements to achieve the perfect citrus balance. A 0.125 cup (1 oz) portion is often ideal for marinades or dressings.</p>  
<p>Air fryers cook food quickly, so even small measurement errors can affect results. If you’re preparing a <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>lime-marinated chicken</a>, 0.125 cup of juice ensures even flavouring without excess moisture. For more conversions, check our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>handy air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>  

<h3>How to measure 0.125 cup of lime juice</h3>  
<p>Use a liquid measuring cup for accuracy. Fill it to the 1/8 cup mark (or 2 tablespoons) to get 0.125 cup. Alternatively, a kitchen scale set to ounces will confirm you’ve measured 1 oz of lime juice. This method is especially useful for sticky ingredients like honey or syrups.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for 0.125 cup lime juice in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>This small but mighty measurement pops up in many recipes. A 0.125 cup (1 oz) of lime juice perfectly seasons a batch of <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>air-fried vegetables</a> or adds brightness to fish tacos. It’s also the ideal amount for glazes, like a honey-lime drizzle for air-fried salmon.</p>  
<p>For frozen foods, such as <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/frozen-foods>air-fryer prawns</a>, 0.125 cup of lime juice in the marinade prevents freezer flavours from dominating. After cooking, a quick clean with <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner</a> removes any citrus residue.</p>  

<h3>Converting other lime juice amounts</h3>  
<p>Need more or less? Here’s a quick guide: 0.25 cup = 2 oz, 0.5 cup = 4 oz, and 1 cup = 8 oz. These conversions help scale recipes up or down while maintaining flavour balance. Always use fresh lime juice for the best results in air fryer dishes.</p>

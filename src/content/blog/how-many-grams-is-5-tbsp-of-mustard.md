<p>5 tablespoons of mustard weigh approximately 75 grams. This conversion is handy for air fryer recipes where precise measurements can make all the difference. Whether you’re preparing a marinade, glaze, or sauce, knowing the exact weight ensures consistency in flavour and texture.</p>  

<h2>Why converting tbsp to grams matters in air frying</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on even cooking, and accurate ingredient measurements help achieve the best results. Mustard, often used in marinades or as a condiment, can vary in density depending on the brand or type. Converting 5 tbsp of mustard into grams (around 75g) ensures you’re using the right amount for your dish. For more air fryer conversion tips, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>  

<p>Using grams instead of tablespoons also eliminates guesswork, especially when scaling recipes up or down. If you’re meal prepping or adjusting portion sizes, weighing ingredients like mustard guarantees accuracy. This is particularly useful for recipes like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>air fryer chicken</a>, where marinades play a key role.</p>  

<h3>Types of mustard and their weights</h3>  
<p>Not all mustards weigh the same per tablespoon. Dijon, whole grain, and yellow mustard have slight variations in density. For example, 5 tbsp of Dijon mustard may weigh closer to 80 grams, while yellow mustard could be around 70 grams. Always check the label or use a kitchen scale for precision.</p>  

<h2>How to measure mustard accurately</h2>  
<p>For the most accurate conversion of 5 tbsp of mustard to grams, use a digital kitchen scale. Scoop the mustard into a measuring spoon, level it off, and then weigh it. This method removes inconsistencies caused by packing or air pockets. If you don’t have a scale, remember that 1 tbsp of mustard is roughly 15 grams, so 5 tbsp equals 75 grams.</p>  

<p>Mustard is a staple in many <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a>, from glazes for salmon to coatings for crispy potatoes. Getting the measurement right ensures your dish isn’t overly tangy or bland.

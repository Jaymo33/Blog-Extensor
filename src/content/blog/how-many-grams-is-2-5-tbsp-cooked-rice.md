<p>2.5 tablespoons (tbsp) of cooked rice equals approximately 37.5 grams (g) in UK measurements. This conversion is handy for air fryer recipes where precision matters, whether you’re reheating leftovers or cooking a fresh batch. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we know accurate measurements can make or break a dish—especially when portioning rice for crispy air-fried rice cakes or balanced meals.</p>  

<h2>Why convert 2.5 tbsp of cooked rice to grams?</h2>  
<p>Converting tablespoons to grams ensures consistency in your air fryer recipes. Unlike volume measurements (like tbsp), weight (grams) accounts for variations in how rice is packed or fluffed. For example, 2.5 tbsp of tightly packed cooked rice might weigh slightly more than loosely scooped rice. If you’re meal prepping or following a recipe from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>our collection</a>, grams provide reliable results every time.</p>  

<p>Grams are also essential for nutritional tracking. If you’re counting calories or macros, weighing 2.5 tbsp of cooked rice as 37.5 grams helps you log portions accurately. This is especially useful for air fryer dishes like crispy rice balls or stuffed peppers, where rice is a key ingredient. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a> for other common ingredients.</p>  

<h3>How to measure 2.5 tbsp of cooked rice in grams</h3>  
<p>Use a digital kitchen scale for the most precise measurement. Spoon cooked rice into a tablespoon without packing it down, then level it off with a knife. Repeat until you’ve measured 2.5 tbsp, then transfer it to the scale. If you’re working with sticky rice, lightly grease the spoon to prevent clumping. For more tips, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/meal-prep>meal prep recipes</a> designed for air fryer efficiency.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for 2.5 tbsp of cooked rice in air fryer recipes</h2>  
<p>This portion is ideal for single servings or small-batch cooking. Try it in air-fried arancini, where 37.5 grams of rice binds perfectly with cheese and herbs. It’s also great for stuffing peppers or mushrooms—just mix with spices and a protein like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/shrimp>shrimp</a> before air frying. Leftover rice? Spread 2.5 tbsp portions on parchment paper, spray with oil, and air fry for crispy rice crackers.</p>  

<p>For breakfast, combine 37.5 grams of cooked rice with egg and veggies in a ramekin for a quick air-fried rice bake. If you’re scaling up, multiply the measurement accordingly—for example, 10 tbsp would be 150 grams. Always refer to your air fryer’s manual for capacity limits, and use our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning guide</a> to maintain your appliance after cooking sticky rice dishes.</p>  

<h3>Variations in rice types and their weights</h3>  
<p>Different rice varieties can slightly alter the weight per tablespoon. While 2.5 tbsp of standard white or brown cooked rice averages 37.5 grams, denser grains like wild rice or glutinous rice may weigh closer to 40 grams. Always adjust air fryer times by a minute or two if using heavier rice types to ensure even crisping.</p>

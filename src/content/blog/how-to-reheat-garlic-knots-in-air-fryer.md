<p>To reheat garlic knots in an air fryer, set the temperature to 160°C (320°F) and cook for 3–4 minutes until warmed through and crispy. This method restores their texture far better than a microwave, keeping them soft inside with a perfectly crisp exterior. Whether your garlic knots are from yesterday’s takeaway or homemade, your air fryer is the best tool for the job.</p>

<h2>Why Use an Air Fryer to Reheat Garlic Knots?</h2>
<p>Air fryers circulate hot air around food, which is ideal for reheating garlic knots without making them soggy or dry. Unlike microwaves that steam bread, air fryers crisp up the exterior while keeping the inside fluffy.

<p>Garlic knots contain butter or oil, which helps them crisp up beautifully in the air fryer. The high heat reactivates the garlic flavour, making them taste freshly baked. If you’re reheating garlic knots from the fridge, let them sit at room temperature for 10 minutes first. This prevents the middle from staying cold while the outside overcooks.</p>

<h3>Ideal Temperature for Reheating</h3>
<p>The perfect air fryer garlic knots reheat temp is 160°C (320°F). This moderate heat warms them through without burning the garlic or drying out the dough. Higher temperatures risk charring the exterior before the centre heats up. If your air fryer runs hot, reduce to 150°C and add an extra minute.

<h2>Step-by-Step Reheating Instructions</h2>
<p>First, preheat your air fryer to 160°C for 2 minutes. Arrange the garlic knots in a single layer – overcrowding causes uneven heating. For best results, spritz them lightly with water or brush with melted butter to prevent drying out. Reheat for 3–4 minutes, shaking the basket halfway. The garlic knots air fryer reheat time may vary slightly depending on size and thickness.</p>
<p>For extra crispiness, sprinkle a pinch of grated parmesan during the last minute. If reheating frozen garlic knots, add 1–2 minutes to the cooking time. Always check internal temperature reaches 75°C if using a food thermometer. Serve immediately – they’re best enjoyed hot from the air fryer.

<h3>Tips for Perfect Results</h3>
<p>To reheat garlic knots without drying in an air fryer, place a small ovenproof dish of water in the basket. The steam helps maintain moisture while still crisping the exterior. If your knots have hardened, wrap them in foil for the first 2 minutes, then uncover to crisp. For garlic knots with cheese, reduce temperature to 150°C to prevent burning.</p>

<h2>Common Reheating Mistakes to Avoid</h2>
<p>Overcrowding the basket is the main culprit for unevenly reheated garlic knots. They need space for air circulation – cook in batches if necessary. Another mistake is reheating at too high a temperature, which dries out the bread before warming the centre. Always preheat your air fryer for consistent results.

<h3>Storing Garlic Knots for Best Reheating</h3>

They’ll keep for 2–3 days in the fridge or up to 3 months frozen. Separate layers with parchment paper if stacking to prevent sticking.</p>

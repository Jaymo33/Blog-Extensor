<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on precise cooking times and ingredient measurements to deliver crispy, evenly cooked dishes.

<p>Treacle is a versatile ingredient, often used in both sweet and savoury dishes. Its rich, molasses-like flavour pairs well with spices like ginger and cinnamon, making it a staple in many British desserts. When measuring small amounts like 0.25 tbsp, using a digital kitchen scale can help ensure accuracy. If you don’t have one, a measuring spoon will do the trick—just remember that 0.25 tbsp is a quarter of a standard tablespoon.

<h2>How to measure 0.25 tbsp of treacle without a scale</h2>

To measure this, fill your tablespoon halfway and then divide that portion in half again. Treacle’s sticky consistency can make this tricky, so lightly greasing the spoon with oil can help it slide off easily. This method ensures you get close to the 4.5-gram mark without needing specialised equipment.</p>

<p>1.5 tablespoons (tbsp) of sesame oil equals approximately 20.25 grams. This conversion is essential for precise cooking, especially when using an air fryer where exact measurements can make a big difference in texture and flavour. Whether you’re whipping up a stir-fry or marinating chicken, knowing the weight of sesame oil ensures consistency in your dishes.

<h2>Why accurate sesame oil measurements matter</h2>  
<p>Using the correct amount of sesame oil is crucial for achieving the right balance of flavour and moisture in your air fryer recipes. Too much oil can make food greasy, while too little might leave it dry. Converting 1.5 tbsp of sesame oil to grams (20.25g) helps eliminate guesswork. This is especially useful for recipes like crispy tofu or sesame-glazed salmon, where precision is key. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more handy measurements.</p>  

<p>Sesame oil has a distinct nutty flavour, and its weight can vary slightly depending on temperature and brand. Measuring by grams ensures accuracy, unlike volume measurements which can be inconsistent. For example, 1.5 tbsp of sesame oil in grams is a reliable metric for baking or frying. If you’re preparing a marinade or dressing, this conversion ensures your dish turns out perfectly every time. Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipes</a> for inspiration.</p>  

<h2>How to measure sesame oil for air frying</h2>  
<p>To measure 1.5 tbsp of sesame oil in grams, use a digital kitchen scale for the most accurate results. Simply tare your scale with the container on it, then pour the oil until it reaches 20.25 grams. This method is far more reliable than using measuring spoons, which can vary in fill level. For air fryer cooking, precision ensures even cooking and perfect crispiness.</p>  

<h3>Common uses for sesame oil in air fryers</h3>  
<p>Sesame oil is a staple in many air fryer recipes, from Asian-inspired dishes to roasted vegetables. Its high smoke point makes it ideal for frying, while its rich flavour enhances marinades and dressings. Whether you’re making crispy chicken wings or flavourful stir-fried veggies, knowing that 1.5 tbsp equals 20.25 grams helps you nail the recipe. For more ideas, browse our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipes</a>.</p>  

<h2>Converting other sesame oil measurements</h2>  
<p>If your recipe calls for a different amount of sesame oil, here’s a quick reference: 1 tbsp is roughly 13.5 grams, while 2 tbsp equals 27 grams. These conversions are handy when scaling recipes up or down. For example, if you need 3 tbsp of sesame oil, that’s about 40.5 grams. Keeping these figures in mind ensures your air fryer meals are consistently delicious.</p>  

<h3>Tips for storing sesame oil</h3>  
<p>To maintain freshness, store sesame oil in a cool, dark place away from direct sunlight. Proper storage ensures the oil retains its flavour and quality, which is vital for recipes requiring 1.5 tbsp (20.25g) or other precise measurements. If you’re unsure about your oil’s freshness, give it a quick sniff—rancid oil will have an off smell.

    "@type": "Answer",
    "text": "No, garlic powder is much more concentrated. As a general rule, 1/8 teaspoon of garlic powder equals one fresh garlic clove. For 1.33 cups (about 50-60 cloves), you’d need roughly 6-7 teaspoons of powder. Always adjust to taste preference."

    "acceptedAnswer": {
    "@type": "Answer",
    "text": "Air fryers intensify flavours as they cook, so garlic can become more pronounced. Try reducing the amount slightly or balancing it with acidic ingredients like lemon juice. The high heat also causes garlic to cook faster, so adding it later in the cooking process might help."

<p>1.33 cups of crushed garlic equals approximately 10.64 ounces. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements can make or break a dish. Whether you’re whipping up garlic-infused chicken or a flavourful vegetable stir-fry, knowing the exact weight ensures consistency. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we understand the importance of accurate measurements for perfect results every time.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate garlic measurements matter in air frying</h2>  
<p>Garlic is a powerhouse ingredient that can elevate any dish, but too much or too little can throw off the balance. In air fryer cooking, where heat circulates rapidly, precise amounts ensure even flavour distribution. Crushed garlic, in particular, can vary in density, making volume-to-weight conversions tricky. That’s why knowing 1.33 cups of crushed garlic to ounces is so useful for home cooks.</p>  
<p>For example, if you’re following a recipe from our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipes section</a>, you’ll want to get the garlic measurement spot-on. Too much garlic can overpower delicate proteins like chicken or fish, while too little might leave your dish lacking depth. With 1.33 cups translating to roughly 10.64 ounces, you can confidently adjust quantities without second-guessing.</p>  

<h3>How to measure crushed garlic correctly</h3>  
<p>When converting 1.33 cups of crushed garlic to oz, the method of measurement matters. Always use standard measuring cups and level off the top for accuracy. If you’re working with whole cloves, remember that one medium clove yields about half a teaspoon when crushed. For larger batches, a kitchen scale is your best friend—simply tare the scale with your bowl and add garlic until you hit 10.64 ounces.</p>  

<h2>Common air fryer recipes using 1.33 cups of crushed garlic</h2>  
<p>Garlic shines in countless air fryer dishes, from crispy roast potatoes to succulent shrimp. A quantity like 1.33 cups (or 10.64 ounces) is perfect for marinades or sauces that serve 4-6 people. Try it in our popular garlic butter shrimp from the <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/shrimp>shrimp category</a>, where the garlic caramelises beautifully under the air fryer’s intense heat.</p>  
<p>Another standout is garlic roasted chicken—combine your 10.64 ounces of crushed garlic with olive oil, lemon juice, and herbs for a show-stopping main. The air fryer locks in moisture while creating a golden, garlicky crust. For vegetarian options, toss cauliflower florets with your measured garlic before air frying for a low-carb side that packs a punch.</p>  

<h3>Storage tips for leftover crushed garlic</h3>  
<p>If your recipe doesn’t use the full 1.33 cups (10.64 ounces), proper storage maintains freshness. Transfer leftovers to an airtight container, cover with olive oil, and refrigerate for up to two weeks. Alternatively, freeze portions in ice cube trays for instant garlic hits in future <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>air fryer recipes</a>. Just remember to label with the date and weight for easy reference.</p>  

<h2>Converting other garlic measurements for air fryer use</h2>  
<p>While we’ve focused on 1.33 cups of crushed garlic to ounces, you might need smaller or larger quantities. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> covers everything from cloves to tablespoons. As a rule of thumb, one cup of crushed garlic weighs about 8 ounces, so adjust proportions accordingly. This knowledge is invaluable when scaling recipes up or down for different serving sizes.</p>  
<p>For instance, if a recipe calls for 2.66 cups of crushed garlic, you’d simply double our 1.33 cup measurement to 21.28 ounces. The air fryer’s compact cooking space means getting quantities right prevents overcrowding and ensures even cooking. Whether you’re meal prepping or cooking for one, these conversions take the guesswork out of garlic-heavy dishes.</p>  

<h3>Cleaning your air fryer after garlic-heavy recipes</h3>  
<p>Garlic’s pungent aroma can linger in your air fryer if not cleaned properly. After cooking with 1.33 cups (10.64 ounces) of crushed garlic, wipe down the basket with warm soapy water immediately. For stubborn odours, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner guide</a> recommends a vinegar-water solution. Regular maintenance keeps your appliance fresh and ready for the next flavour-packed creation.</p>

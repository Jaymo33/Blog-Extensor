<p>0.25 tbsp of sunflower oil equals approximately 3.7 grams. This conversion is essential for precise cooking, especially when using an air fryer where exact measurements can impact texture and crispiness. Whether you’re following a recipe from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> or experimenting with your own dishes, knowing this conversion ensures consistent results.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air frying</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on hot air circulation to cook food evenly, and even small variations in oil quantity can affect the outcome. Too much oil can make food greasy, while too little may leave it dry. For recipes like crispy vegetables or perfectly golden chicken, 0.25 tbsp of sunflower oil (3.7 grams) is often the ideal amount. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more handy measurements.</p>  

<p>Many air fryer recipes, especially those in our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken category</a>, call for small oil quantities to achieve that signature crispiness. Measuring 0.25 tbsp of sunflower oil accurately ensures you don’t overpower the dish while still enhancing flavour and texture.</p>  

<h3>How to measure 0.25 tbsp of sunflower oil</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a tablespoon measure handy, you can use a teaspoon instead. Since 1 tbsp equals 3 tsp, 0.25 tbsp is roughly 0.75 tsp. For grams, a digital kitchen scale is the most accurate tool. Simply tare your scale with the container on it, then add sunflower oil until it reads 3.7 grams.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for 0.25 tbsp of sunflower oil</h2>  
<p>This small quantity of oil is perfect for lightly coating air fryer baskets to prevent sticking or for tossing with ingredients like potatoes or Brussels sprouts. Many of our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipes</a> use this measurement to balance health and crispiness. It’s also ideal for marinating proteins without making them overly oily.</p>  

<p>Sunflower oil is a popular choice for air frying due to its high smoke point and neutral flavour. Whether you’re cooking frozen foods from our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/frozen-foods>frozen foods category</a> or fresh vegetables, 0.25 tbsp (3.7 grams) provides just enough lubrication for perfect results.</p>  

<h3>Converting other oil quantities</h3>  
<p>If your recipe calls for a different amount, remember that 1 tbsp of sunflower oil weighs about 14 grams. This makes scaling up or down simple. For example, 0.5 tbsp would be 7 grams, while 1 tsp (0.33 tbsp) is roughly 4.6 grams. Always refer to reliable sources like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> for tested measurements.</p>

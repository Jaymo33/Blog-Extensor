<p>100g of plain yogurt is approximately 3.53 ounces. This conversion is essential for precise measurements, especially when preparing air fryer recipes that require exact quantities. Whether you're whipping up a creamy dip or a marinade, knowing how to convert grams to ounces ensures your dish turns out perfectly every time.</p>

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on precise cooking times and ingredient ratios to deliver crispy, evenly cooked results. Using the correct amount of yogurt, such as 100g (3.53 oz), can affect the texture and consistency of your dish. For example, a marinade with too much yogurt might become overly thick, while too little could fail to coat your ingredients properly.</p>  
<p>At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we emphasise the importance of accurate conversions to help you achieve restaurant-quality meals at home. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more handy measurement tips.</p>

<h2>How to measure 100g of plain yogurt without scales</h2>  
<p>If you don’t have a kitchen scale, you can still measure 100g of plain yogurt using simple household tools. A standard metric measuring cup holds about 250ml, so 100g of yogurt would fill roughly 40% of the cup. Alternatively, two heaped tablespoons of yogurt will give you close to 100g (3.53 oz).</p>  
<p>For more precise measurements, consider investing in a digital scale. It’s a small tool that makes a big difference, especially when following recipes from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>our collection</a>.</p>

<h3>Common uses for 100g of plain yogurt in air fryer recipes</h3>  
<p>Plain yogurt is a versatile ingredient in air fryer cooking. It works wonderfully as a base for marinades, adding tenderness to chicken or lamb. You can also use it to create creamy dips or even lighten up baked goods like air-fried muffins.</p>

<h2>Converting other yogurt quantities to ounces</h2>  
<p>If your recipe calls for a different amount of yogurt, here’s a quick reference: 50g is about 1.76 oz, 200g is roughly 7.05 oz, and 250g equals approximately 8.82 oz. These conversions are particularly useful when scaling recipes up or down.</p>

<h3>Tips for storing and using plain yogurt</h3>  
<p>To keep your plain yogurt fresh, always store it in the fridge and use it within its expiry date. If you’re using it in air fryer recipes, let it come to room temperature first for easier mixing. This small step can make a big difference in the consistency of your marinades or batters.</p>

Whether you're whipping up a creamy dip or a marinade, knowing how to convert grams to ounces ensures your dish turns out perfectly every time.</p>

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on precise cooking times and ingredient ratios to deliver crispy, evenly cooked results. Using the correct amount of yogurt, such as 100g (3.53 oz), can affect the texture and consistency of your dish. For example, a marinade with too much yogurt might become overly thick, while too little could fail to coat your ingredients properly.</p>

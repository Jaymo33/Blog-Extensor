<p>35 ml of chicken broth equals approximately 0.15 cups (or roughly 1/8 cup plus 1 teaspoon). This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise liquid measurements can make or break a dish. Whether you're making a marinade, sauce, or soup, knowing how to convert millilitres to cups ensures consistent results every time.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on precise ingredient ratios to achieve the perfect texture and flavour. Too much liquid, like chicken broth, can lead to soggy results, while too little might dry out your dish. For example, when making a <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>chicken-based air fryer recipe</a>, 35 ml of broth might be used to keep the meat moist without over-saturating it. Always measure liquids carefully to avoid common pitfalls.</p>  

<p>Many air fryer enthusiasts use chicken broth to add depth to dishes like roasted vegetables or marinated proteins.

<h3>How to Measure 35 ml of Chicken Broth Without a Scale</h3>

For air fryer meals, it’s often used to baste meats or deglaze a pan. Always adjust seasonings accordingly, as broth adds saltiness.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of tartar sauce can make or break your dish. Too much, and your coating might become soggy; too little, and the flavour falls flat. Air fryers rely on even distribution of ingredients for optimal cooking. That’s why converting 0.33 cup of tartar sauce to ounces (2.64 oz) is so useful. For more recipe ideas, visit our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipes section</a>.</p>  

<p>Many air fryer recipes call for small quantities of sauces like tartar sauce to keep things light and crispy. Measuring by weight (ounces) is often more accurate than volume (cups), especially for thicker condiments. If you're working with other ingredients, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a> can help streamline your prep.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure 0.33 Cup of Tartar Sauce</h3>  
<p>To measure 0.33 cup of tartar sauce, use a liquid measuring cup with clear markings. Fill it just below the 1/3 cup line for accuracy. Alternatively, a kitchen scale set to ounces will give you the precise 2.64 oz equivalent. This method is ideal for recipes where consistency is key, like air fryer fish or shrimp dishes.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for 0.33 Cup of Tartar Sauce</h2>  
<p>This amount is perfect for coating 4-6 portions of fish fillets or chicken strips before air frying. Tartar sauce adds moisture and flavour without overwhelming the dish.

<p>You can also use 0.33 cup (2.64 oz) of tartar sauce as a dipping portion for sides like air-fried chips or onion rings. It’s just enough to complement without drowning the crunch.

<h3>Tips for Storing Leftover Tartar Sauce</h3>

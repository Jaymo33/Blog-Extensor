<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>
<p>Air fryers rely on precise ingredient ratios to achieve the perfect texture and flavour. Too much or too little liquid can affect cooking times and results.

Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> simplifies these calculations, so you never have to second-guess your measurements. Whether you're baking cakes or roasting vegetables, accuracy is key.</p>

<h3>UK vs. US Cup Measurements</h3>
<p>In the UK, a standard cup holds 250 ml, while in the US, it's 240 ml. This slight difference means 535 ml of water converts to 2.26 cups in the UK and 2.25 cups in the US. For most air fryer recipes, this variance won’t make a noticeable difference, but it’s good to be aware of.

<h2>How to Measure 535 ml of Water Without a Measuring Cup</h2>
<p>If you don’t have a measuring cup, you can use a kitchen scale to weigh 535 grams of water, as 1 ml of water weighs 1 gram.

For more tips on air fryer measurements, visit our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning and maintenance guide</a>, which also covers proper measuring tools.</p>

<p>Another handy trick is to use tablespoons—20 UK tablespoons equal roughly 300 ml, so 535 ml would be about 35 tablespoons. While this method isn’t as precise, it works in a pinch.

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on precise ingredient ratios to achieve perfect results. Too much or too little marmalade can affect texture and flavour. For instance, a sticky glaze might burn if over-applied, while too little won’t caramelise properly. Many <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> call for small quantities, making conversions like 1.5 tbsp marmalade to grams crucial. Consistency is key, whether you're cooking for one or meal prepping.</p>  

<p>Using a digital scale eliminates guesswork. While tablespoons measure volume, grams account for density, which varies between brands. Homemade marmalade, for example, might be chunkier than store-bought, affecting weight. For reliable results, always weigh ingredients when possible.

<h3>How to Measure 1.5 tbsp Marmalade Without Scales</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have scales, use levelled tablespoons for accuracy. Scoop marmalade and level off the excess with a knife. Note that 1.5 tbsp equals 22.5 ml, but weight remains the gold standard. For sticky ingredients like marmalade, lightly greasing the spoon helps release it cleanly. Need more tips?

<h2>Common Uses for 1.5 tbsp Marmalade in Air Fryer Recipes</h2>  
<p>Marmalade adds a citrusy sweetness to both savoury and sweet dishes. Glaze chicken or salmon with 1.5 tbsp (30g) for a caramelised finish, or swirl it into cake batters. In the air fryer, marmalade’s sugar content helps create crispy edges—ideal for <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/breakfast>breakfast recipes</a> like French toast. For a quick dessert, brush it over puff pastry before air frying.</p>  

<p>Experiment with flavours by adjusting the quantity. A heaped 1.5 tbsp (closer to 35g) intensifies sweetness, while a scant measure keeps it subtle. Pair marmalade with spices like ginger or chilli for depth. Looking for more ideas?

<p>122 fan oven converts to approximately 150°C in a conventional oven. This conversion is essential for achieving the same cooking results when switching between oven types. Fan ovens circulate hot air, cooking food faster and more evenly, while conventional ovens rely on radiant heat. Understanding this difference helps prevent under or overcooking your dishes.</p>

<h2>Why Convert 122 Fan Oven to Conventional Oven?</h2>
<p>Many recipes, especially those from Europe, specify temperatures for fan ovens. If you're using a conventional oven, converting 122 fan oven to conventional oven settings ensures your food cooks properly. The general rule is to increase the temperature by 20°C when moving from fan to conventional. This adjustment accounts for the slower heat distribution in traditional ovens.</p>
<p>At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we recommend keeping a conversion chart handy for quick reference. This is particularly useful when trying new recipes or when your appliance manual doesn't provide conversion guidelines. Remember that cooking times may also need adjustment when converting 122 fan oven to conventional oven temperatures.</p>

<h2>How to Adjust Cooking Times</h2>
<p>When you've converted 122 fan oven to conventional oven (150°C), you'll typically need to increase cooking time by 10-15%. This compensates for the less efficient heat distribution in conventional ovens. However, always check your food 5-10 minutes before the recommended time to prevent overcooking.</p>
<p>For baking enthusiasts, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> includes comprehensive guidelines for various oven types. This resource is invaluable when adapting recipes between different cooking appliances, ensuring consistent results whether you're using fan, conventional, or even air fryer settings.</p>

<h3>Special Considerations for Baking</h3>
<p>When converting 122 fan oven to conventional oven for baking, position matters. In a conventional oven, the middle rack provides the most even heat distribution. For delicate items like cakes or pastries, you might need to rotate your pans halfway through cooking to ensure even browning.</p>

<h2>Converting to Air Fryer Temperatures</h2>
<p>If you're wondering about 122 fan oven to air fryer equivalent, the conversion differs slightly. Air fryers cook even faster than fan ovens, so you'd typically reduce the temperature by 20°C and shorten cooking time. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a> includes specific air fryer adaptations for popular dishes.</p>
<p>For example, when converting 122 fan oven to conventional oven for roasting vegetables, you'd use 150°C. But in an air fryer, you might try 130°C and check for doneness several minutes early. This flexibility is why many home cooks love using air fryers for quick, even cooking.</p>

<h3>Common Conversion Mistakes to Avoid</h3>
<p>One frequent error is forgetting that 122 fan oven to celsius is actually the same temperature (122°C), just with different cooking dynamics. The conversion to conventional oven refers to achieving equivalent cooking results, not changing the actual temperature scale. Another mistake is not adjusting cooking times when converting 122 fan oven to conventional oven settings.</p>

<h2>Practical Conversion Examples</h2>
<p>Let's examine specific applications of 122 fan oven to conventional oven conversion. For roasting chicken, 122°C fan becomes 150°C conventional, with increased cooking time. For baking cookies, you might need to watch carefully as conventional ovens can create hot spots that fan ovens avoid.</p>
<p>Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipe category</a> includes both fan and conventional oven instructions, making meal planning easier. Whether you're preparing a Sunday roast or weeknight dinner, understanding these conversions ensures perfectly cooked meals every time.</p>

<h3>Using Oven Thermometers for Accuracy</h3>
<p>Even with perfect 122 fan oven to conventional oven conversion, oven thermostats can be inaccurate. An inexpensive oven thermometer verifies your actual cooking temperature. This is especially important when precision matters, like when baking bread or delicate pastries.</p>

<p>20g of tomato paste equals approximately 0.71 ounces. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes, where precise measurements can make all the difference. Whether you're whipping up a quick pasta sauce or a flavourful marinade, knowing how to convert grams to ounces ensures your dish turns out just right. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we understand the importance of accuracy in cooking, especially when using an air fryer.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on precise cooking times and ingredient quantities to deliver perfect results. Using too much or too little tomato paste can throw off the balance of your dish, affecting texture and flavour. For example, adding 20g of tomato paste (0.71 ounces) to a marinade ensures the right consistency without overpowering other ingredients. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more handy measurement tips.</p>  

<p>Tomato paste is a concentrated ingredient, so even small variations in quantity can have a big impact. Whether you're making a rich bolognese or a tangy glaze, measuring 20g of tomato paste correctly guarantees consistent results. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipes</a> section offers plenty of inspiration for using tomato paste in your air fryer creations.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure 20g of Tomato Paste Without Scales</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a kitchen scale, you can still measure 20g of tomato paste (0.71 ounces) using tablespoons. One tablespoon of tomato paste typically weighs around 15g, so 20g is roughly 1 and 1/3 tablespoons. For sticky ingredients like tomato paste, lightly oiling the spoon helps it slide off easily. This trick is especially useful when prepping air fryer meals in a hurry.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for 20g of Tomato Paste in Air Fryer Recipes</h2>  
<p>Tomato paste adds depth and richness to countless dishes. In your air fryer, 20g (0.71 ounces) can be used to create a flavourful base for sauces, stews, or even as a glaze for meats. Try mixing it with herbs and spices for a quick marinade, or stir it into soups for an extra umami kick. Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipes</a> for ideas on incorporating tomato paste into your meals.</p>  

<p>Another great use for 20g of tomato paste is in homemade air fryer pizza sauces. Combine it with garlic, oregano, and a splash of water for a deliciously simple topping. The concentrated flavour means a little goes a long way, making it a cost-effective ingredient.

<h3>Storage Tips for Leftover Tomato Paste</h3>  
<p>Once opened, tomato paste can be stored in the fridge for up to a week. To keep it fresh longer, transfer 20g portions into an ice cube tray and freeze. This way, you’ll always have the right amount (0.71 ounces) ready for your next air fryer adventure. It’s a handy trick for meal prep enthusiasts and busy cooks alike.</p>

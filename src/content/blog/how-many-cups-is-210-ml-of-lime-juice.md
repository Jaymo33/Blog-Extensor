<p>210 ml of lime juice is approximately 0.89 cups. This conversion is essential for recipes requiring precise measurements, especially when using an air fryer. Whether you're whipping up a zesty marinade or a tangy dessert, knowing how to convert 210 ml of lime juice to cups ensures consistency. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we understand the importance of accurate measurements for perfect results every time.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Lime Juice Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of lime juice can make or break a dish. Too little, and your recipe lacks zest; too much, and it becomes overpowering. For air fryer recipes, precision is key to achieving the right balance of flavours. A common measurement like 210 ml of lime juice in cups ensures your marinades, dressings, or desserts turn out just right. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more handy tips.</p>  

<p>Many recipes, especially those for baking or sauces, rely on exact liquid measurements. Lime juice, with its strong acidity, needs careful measuring to avoid altering the dish's taste. Whether you're following a UK or US recipe, converting 210 ml of lime juice to cups helps standardise your cooking. For more inspiration, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> collection.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure 210 ml of Lime Juice</h3>  
<p>To measure 210 ml of lime juice accurately, use a liquid measuring cup with clear metric markings. Fill it to the 210 ml line for precision. If your cup only shows imperial measurements, remember that 210 ml is roughly 0.89 cups. For smaller quantities, a tablespoon holds about 15 ml, so 14 tablespoons equal 210 ml. Always use fresh lime juice for the best flavour in your air fryer dishes.</p>  

<h2>Converting 210 ml of Lime Juice for Baking</h2>  
<p>Baking requires exact measurements, and lime juice is no exception. Whether you're making a key lime pie or citrus-infused cakes, 210 ml of lime juice converts to just under a cup. This ensures your baked goods have the perfect tang without being too sour.

<p>If a recipe calls for 210 ml of lime juice and you only have cups, measure out 0.89 cups for accuracy. Slight variations can affect the texture and taste, especially in delicate bakes. Always squeeze fresh limes rather than using bottled juice for the best results. Need cleaning tips for sticky lime residue?

<h3>Using 210 ml of Lime Juice in Savoury Dishes</h3>  
<p>In savoury cooking, 210 ml of lime juice adds brightness to marinades, dressings, and sauces. For air-fried chicken or shrimp, this amount provides enough acidity to tenderise and flavour the protein. Convert 210 ml to cups (0.89) for easy measuring, ensuring your dish isn’t overly acidic.

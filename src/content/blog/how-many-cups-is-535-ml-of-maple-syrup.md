<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of maple syrup can make or break your dish. Too much can overpower flavours, while too little might leave your recipe lacking sweetness. Air fryer recipes, like those found on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>our recipes page</a>, often rely on precise liquid measurements for even cooking. Maple syrup’s viscosity means it doesn’t pour like water, so measuring correctly is key.</p>

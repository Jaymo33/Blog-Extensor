<p>1 cup of coconut oil equals approximately 8 ounces (or 226.8 grams). This measurement is essential for air fryer recipes, ensuring your dishes turn out perfectly every time. Whether you're baking, frying, or roasting, accurate conversions make all the difference. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we help simplify cooking conversions so you can focus on creating delicious meals.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air frying</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of coconut oil ensures even cooking and prevents food from sticking to the air fryer basket. Too much oil can make dishes greasy, while too little may cause dryness. For best results, measure coconut oil precisely—especially when following recipes from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>our collection</a>. Whether you're making crispy vegetables or succulent chicken, the correct oil quantity enhances texture and flavour.</p>  

<p>Coconut oil is a popular choice for air frying due to its high smoke point and subtle sweetness. Unlike butter, it remains stable at high temperatures, making it ideal for air fryer cooking. If you're new to using coconut oil, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a> for other common measurements. This way, you’ll never second-guess ingredient quantities again.</p>  

<h3>How to measure coconut oil correctly</h3>  
<p>Measuring coconut oil can be tricky since it changes texture with temperature. For solid coconut oil, pack it into a measuring cup and level it off. If melted, pour it into a liquid measuring cup for accuracy. Keep in mind that 1 cup of coconut oil to ounces is always 8 oz, regardless of its state. For more tips on handling ingredients, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipes</a>, where precise measurements are key.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for coconut oil in air fryers</h2>  
<p>Coconut oil works wonders in air fryers, from crisping potatoes to coating proteins. Its natural richness adds depth to dishes like air-fried shrimp or tofu. If you're preparing frozen foods, a light brush of coconut oil prevents sticking while enhancing crispiness. Visit <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/frozen-foods>our frozen foods section</a> for inspiration on using coconut oil effectively.</p>  

<p>Beyond frying, coconut oil can be used to grease air fryer baskets or liners. Just a small amount ensures easy cleanup and prevents residue buildup. For maintenance tips, check our guide on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>keeping your air fryer spotless</a>.

Whether you’re meal prepping or cooking for one, knowing how many ounces are in 1 cup of coconut oil ensures consistency.

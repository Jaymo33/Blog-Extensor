<p>75g of baking soda equals approximately 2.65 ounces. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes, where precise measurements can make all the difference. Whether you're whipping up crispy treats or cleaning your air fryer, knowing how to convert grams to ounces ensures consistency. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we help you nail every measurement for flawless results.</p>  

<h2>Why Convert 75g of Baking Soda to Ounces?</h2>  
<p>Many UK recipes use grams, while others rely on ounces, especially older cookbooks or international guides. Converting 75g of baking soda to ounces (2.65 oz) ensures you follow recipes accurately. This is particularly important in air fryer cooking, where ingredient ratios affect texture and rise. Too much or too little baking soda can ruin baked goods or cleaning solutions.</p>  
<p>For example, if you're making air fryer cookies from our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipes</a> section, precise measurements guarantee the perfect chew. Baking soda also plays a role in cleaning your air fryer—check our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning guide</a> for tips.</p>  

<h2>How to Measure 75g of Baking Soda Accurately</h2>  
<p>Use a digital kitchen scale for the most precise measurement. Place a bowl on the scale, tare it to zero, then add baking soda until it reads 75g. If you don’t have a scale, use measuring spoons: 75g is roughly 15 teaspoons. However, weighing is always more reliable for air fryer recipes.</p>  

<h3>Common Uses for 75g of Baking Soda in Air Fryers</h3>  
<p>Beyond baking, 75g of baking soda can freshen your air fryer. Mix it with water to create a paste for scrubbing stubborn grease. It’s also great for deodorising—sprinkle a little inside and wipe after 10 minutes. For more cleaning hacks, visit our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner</a> page.</p>  

<h2>Conversion Chart for Baking Soda</h2>  
<p>Bookmark our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a> for quick reference. Here’s a handy table for common baking soda weights: 25g = 0.88 oz, 50g = 1.76 oz, and 100g = 3.53 oz. This saves time when scaling recipes up or down for your air fryer.</p>  

<h3>Tips for Storing Baking Soda</h3>  
<p>Keep baking soda in an airtight container to maintain freshness. Humidity can clump it, making measurements less accurate. Store it away from strong odours, as it absorbs smells. Proper storage ensures your 75g portions remain consistent for every recipe.</p>

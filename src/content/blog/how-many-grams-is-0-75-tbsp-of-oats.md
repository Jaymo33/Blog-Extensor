<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>
<p>Air fryers rely on even cooking, and incorrect measurements can lead to uneven results. Too many oats might make your dish dry, while too few could leave it soggy. Measuring 0.75 tbsp of oats in grams ensures consistency, especially for recipes like crispy oat-crusted fish or homemade granola clusters. Visit <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>our recipes section</a> for inspiration on using oats in your air fryer.</p>
<p>British oats are typically rolled or jumbo, and their density can vary slightly. That's why weighing 0.75 tbsp of oats in grams (5.6g) is more reliable than volume measurements. For breakfast ideas like air-fried oatmeal cookies or oat-crusted bananas, precise measurements make all the difference. Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/breakfast>breakfast category</a> for more oat-based delights.</p>

<h2>How to measure 0.75 tbsp of oats without scales</h2>
<p>If you don’t have digital scales, use a measuring spoon and level it off with a knife for accuracy. Remember, 0.75 tbsp of oats is roughly three-quarters of a standard UK tablespoon. For recipes like oat-crusted chicken tenders or apple crumble, this method works well. Need cleaning tips for sticky oat residues?

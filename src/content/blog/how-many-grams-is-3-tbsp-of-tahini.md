<p>3 tablespoons of tahini equals approximately 45 grams. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements ensure perfect results. Whether you're making dips, dressings, or marinades, knowing the weight of tahini helps maintain consistency. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we emphasise accuracy to elevate your cooking. Tahini's density can vary slightly, but 45 grams is a reliable standard.</p>

<h2>Why accurate tahini measurements matter</h2>
<p>Using the correct amount of tahini ensures your dishes have the right texture and flavour. Too much can make sauces overly thick, while too little might leave them lacking depth. For air fryer recipes, precise measurements prevent uneven cooking or overly dense results. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for other common ingredient conversions. Consistency is key, especially when experimenting with new dishes.</p>

<p>Tahini is a staple in Middle Eastern cuisine, often used in hummus, baba ganoush, and dressings. Its rich, nutty flavour enhances both savoury and sweet dishes. When converting 3 tbsp of tahini to grams, remember that slight variations won’t ruin your meal. However, for baking or precise recipes, sticking to 45 grams is best. Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a> for inspiration on using tahini in your air fryer.</p>

<h3>How to measure tahini accurately</h3>
<p>For the most accurate measurement, use a kitchen scale to weigh tahini directly. Scooping it with a spoon can lead to inconsistencies due to its sticky texture. If you don’t have a scale, level off the tablespoons evenly. Remember, 3 tbsp of tahini to grams is roughly 45g, but always double-check for critical recipes. Proper measuring ensures your air fryer dishes turn out perfectly every time.</p>

<h2>Common uses for tahini in air fryer cooking</h2>
<p>Tahini adds richness to marinades for chicken, lamb, or tofu in the air fryer. It also works well in dressings for roasted vegetables or drizzled over falafel. For sweet treats, try tahini in cookies or drizzled over air-fried bananas. Visit our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert category</a> for creative ideas. Its versatility makes it a must-have for any air fryer enthusiast.</p>

<p>When substituting tahini in recipes, keep the 3 tbsp tahini to grams conversion in mind. Other nut butters may have different densities, so adjustments might be needed. For cleaning sticky tahini residue from your air fryer, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning guide</a> has handy tips. Whether you’re a beginner or a pro, precise measurements make all the difference.</p>

<h3>Storing tahini for long-term use</h3>
<p>Tahini can separate over time, so always stir it well before measuring. Store it in a cool, dark place to maintain freshness. If you use it infrequently, refrigeration can extend its shelf life. Just bring it to room temperature before measuring 3 tbsp of tahini in grams for recipes. Proper storage ensures your tahini stays ready for your next air fryer creation.</p>

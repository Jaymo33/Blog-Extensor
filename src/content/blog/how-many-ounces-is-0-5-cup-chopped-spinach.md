<p>0.5 cup of chopped spinach equals approximately 1.5 ounces (or 42.5 grams). This measurement is essential for air fryer recipes, ensuring accurate portions for dishes like spinach-stuffed chicken or crispy veggie sides. Whether you're meal prepping or whipping up a quick snack, knowing this conversion helps avoid guesswork.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Spinach Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Getting the right amount of chopped spinach ensures your air fryer recipes turn out perfectly. Too much spinach can make dishes soggy, while too little might leave them lacking in flavour. For example, if you're making air-fried spinach and feta parcels, 0.5 cup (1.5 oz) is often the ideal portion per serving. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> for more inspiration.</p>  

<p>Spinach shrinks significantly when cooked, so measuring it raw is crucial. A packed 0.5 cup of fresh chopped spinach yields roughly 1.5 ounces, but once air-fried, it reduces to about a quarter of that volume. This makes it perfect for adding to omelettes, stuffed mushrooms, or even as a topping for air-fried salmon.</p>  

<h2>How to Measure Chopped Spinach Correctly</h2>  
<p>When measuring 0.5 cup of chopped spinach, lightly pack the leaves into your measuring cup without crushing them. This ensures consistency, especially if you're following a recipe from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>. If you don’t have measuring cups, a kitchen scale is the most accurate tool—just set it to ounces and weigh out 1.5 oz.</p>  

<h3>Using Frozen vs. Fresh Spinach</h3>  
<p>Frozen chopped spinach is denser than fresh, so 0.5 cup of thawed spinach weighs closer to 2.5 ounces. Always drain excess water before using it in air fryer recipes to prevent sogginess. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a> can help adjust measurements for different spinach types.</p>  

<h2>Best Air Fryer Recipes Using 0.5 Cup Spinach</h2>  
<p>From crispy spinach dip to stuffed chicken breasts, 0.5 cup of chopped spinach is a versatile ingredient. Try it in air-fried spanakopita bites or as a filling for cheesy spinach rolls. For more ideas, browse our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable recipes</a> section.</p>  

<p>Spinach also works well in air-fried egg muffins or as a base for healthy chips. Since it cooks quickly, pairing it with proteins like chicken or tofu ensures a balanced meal.

<p>1 tablespoon (tbsp) of granulated sugar weighs approximately 12.5 grams in the UK. This measurement is essential for baking, cooking, and even air fryer recipes where precision ensures perfect results. Whether you're whipping up a cake or caramelising sugar for a dessert, knowing this conversion saves time and avoids guesswork.

<h2>Why accurate sugar measurements matter</h2>  
<p>Using the correct amount of granulated sugar can make or break a recipe. Too much can overpower flavours, while too little may leave desserts bland. In air fryer cooking, precise measurements ensure even caramelisation and texture. For example, a <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>cake recipe</a> relying on 1 tbsp of granulated sugar per serving needs exact grams for consistency. Digital scales eliminate measuring errors, especially when scaling recipes up or down.</p>  

<p>Granulated sugar’s density means slight variations can occur based on how tightly it’s packed. Spooning sugar lightly into a tablespoon and levelling it off gives the most accurate 12.5-gram measure. For sticky or clumped sugar, fluff it with a fork first. If you’re adapting a US recipe, note that UK tablespoons differ slightly—always double-check conversions to avoid mishaps.</p>  

<h3>Converting other sugar measurements</h3>  
<p>Beyond 1 tbsp, you might need to convert cups or ounces of granulated sugar to grams. One UK cup holds roughly 200 grams of granulated sugar, while 1 ounce equals about 28 grams. These conversions are handy for larger batches, like when preparing <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cookies>cookies</a> in your air fryer.

<h2>Common uses for 1 tbsp of granulated sugar</h2>  
<p>From sweetening morning coffee to balancing sauces, 1 tbsp of granulated sugar is a kitchen staple. In air fryer recipes, it’s often used to glaze <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken wings</a> or caramelise fruit for desserts. A light sprinkle over air-fried doughnuts or churros enhances texture without overwhelming sweetness. For savoury dishes, a pinch (about 1/4 tbsp) can round out acidic flavours in marinades.</p>  

<p>When reducing sugar in recipes, substitute carefully—each tbsp removed alters texture and browning. In air fryers, sugar helps achieve crispy finishes, so adjustments may require trial and error.

<h3>Tips for measuring granulated sugar</h3>  
<p>For the most accurate 12.5-gram measure, use a digital scale set to grams. If using tablespoons, avoid compacting sugar into the spoon—lightly fill and level with a knife. Store sugar in an airtight container to prevent moisture absorption, which can affect weight. When halving recipes, note that 1/2 tbsp of granulated sugar equals about 6.25 grams.</p>

<p>0.25 tbsp of self-raising flour equals approximately 2.5 grams. This conversion is essential for precise baking, especially when using an air fryer where exact measurements can affect texture and rise. Whether you're whipping up cakes or bread, knowing how to convert tablespoons to grams ensures consistent results every time.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Flour Measurements Matter</h2>
<p>Baking is a science, and even small variations in flour quantities can impact your final product. Too much flour can make baked goods dense, while too little may cause them to collapse. When using an air fryer, precise measurements are even more critical due to its rapid cooking method. For perfect results, always measure your self-raising flour accurately.</p>
<p>At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we recommend using digital scales for the most reliable measurements. If you don't have scales, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> can help you convert between volume and weight measurements effortlessly.</p>

<h2>How to Measure 0.25 tbsp of Self-Raising Flour</h2>
<p>Measuring small quantities like 0.25 tbsp can be tricky without the right tools. A standard tablespoon holds 15ml, so 0.25 tbsp is roughly one-quarter of that amount. For the most accurate measurement, use a measuring spoon set that includes fractional tablespoons or a digital scale set to grams.</p>

<h3>The Weight of Self-Raising Flour</h3>
<p>Self-raising flour weighs slightly less than plain flour due to the added raising agents. On average, 1 tablespoon of self-raising flour weighs about 10 grams, making 0.25 tbsp approximately 2.5 grams. This slight variation matters in delicate bakes like scones or sponge cakes where precise measurements are crucial.</p>

<p>300 grams of rolled oats is roughly equivalent to 3.75 cups. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes, ensuring you get the right texture and consistency every time. Whether you're making granola, oat bars, or a crunchy topping, accurate measurements make all the difference.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter</h2>
<p>Using the correct amount of rolled oats ensures your air fryer recipes turn out as intended. Too little, and your granola might not clump properly. Too much, and your oat bars could end up dry. For perfect results every time, precise measurements are non-negotiable.</p>

<h2>How to Measure Rolled Oats Correctly</h2>
<p>Measuring 300 grams of rolled oats in cups isn’t as straightforward as it seems. The density of rolled oats can vary, so spooning them lightly into a measuring cup is the best method. Avoid packing them down, as this can lead to an inaccurate measurement.</p>

<h3>UK vs. US Cup Measurements</h3>

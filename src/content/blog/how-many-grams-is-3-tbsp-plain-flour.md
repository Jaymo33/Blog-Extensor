<p>3 tablespoons of plain flour equals approximately 24 grams. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precision matters, ensuring your bakes and batters turn out just right. Whether you're whipping up air fryer cakes, cookies, or breaded dishes, knowing the exact weight of your ingredients can make all the difference.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate flour measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Using the correct amount of flour is crucial in air fryer recipes because it affects texture, rise, and overall success. Too much flour can make baked goods dense, while too little may cause them to crumble. For example, if you're making air fryer cookies from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>our recipe collection</a>, precise measurements ensure the perfect chewiness. The air fryer's rapid circulation means small imbalances in ingredients can lead to uneven cooking.</p>  

<p>Many UK bakers prefer weighing ingredients like plain flour rather than using volume measurements like tablespoons. This avoids inconsistencies caused by how densely the flour is packed into the spoon. A digital kitchen scale is a worthwhile investment for air fryer enthusiasts who love baking.

<h3>How to measure 3 tbsp of plain flour accurately</h3>  
<p>For the most precise 3 tbsp plain flour to grams conversion, use the scoop-and-level method. Lightly spoon flour into the tablespoon without packing it down, then level off the excess with a straight edge. This gives you the standard 8 grams per tablespoon that professional bakers use. Never scoop directly from the bag as this compacts the flour and can add up to 25% more by weight.</p>  

<h2>Common air fryer recipes using 3 tbsp plain flour</h2>  
<p>Many quick air fryer recipes call for small amounts of plain flour like 3 tablespoons (24g). This quantity is perfect for coating chicken wings before air frying to achieve that crispy golden finish. It's also ideal for small batches of air fryer pancakes or thickening sauces in <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipes</a>. The moderate amount helps create light batters without making food overly doughy.</p>  

<p>When preparing air fryer fish cakes or vegetable fritters, 3 tbsp of plain flour (24g) binds ingredients without dominating flavours. This measurement also works well for dusting surfaces when rolling out air fryer doughnuts or pastries. Remember that different brands of plain flour may vary slightly in density, so when precision matters, weighing is best.

<h3>Adjusting recipes when you only have measuring spoons</h3>  
<p>If you don't have scales, understanding that 3 tbsp plain flour equals 24 grams helps adapt recipes. When a recipe specifies grams but you only have measuring spoons, this conversion ensures accuracy. For example, if an air fryer cake recipe requires 120g flour, you'd need 15 tablespoons (5 lots of 3 tbsp). Keep our conversion handy when trying new recipes from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>.</p>  

<h2>Storing plain flour for best air fryer results</h2>  
<p>To maintain consistency in your 3 tbsp plain flour to grams measurements, store flour properly. Keep it in an airtight container in a cool, dry place to prevent moisture absorption which changes weight. Wholemeal plain flour weighs slightly more than white - about 9g per tablespoon - so adjust accordingly. Always give flour a quick stir before measuring as it can settle during storage.</p>  

<p>For those who use their air fryer frequently, consider pre-measuring common quantities like 3 tbsp (24g) portions of plain flour and storing them in small containers. This saves time when preparing favourites like air fryer tempura or <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable coatings</a>. Proper storage also prevents insect infestations that can ruin your flour supply. Remember to clean your air fryer basket after flour-heavy recipes using our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning guide</a>.</p>

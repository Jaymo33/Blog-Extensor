<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>
<p>Air fryers rely on precise ingredient ratios to achieve the best results. Too much or too little tomato paste can affect the texture and flavour of your dish. For example, if you’re making a <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>spicy tomato chicken</a>, the right amount of tomato paste ensures a balanced taste.

That’s why knowing how to convert 1.66 cups of tomato paste to ounces is so valuable.</p>

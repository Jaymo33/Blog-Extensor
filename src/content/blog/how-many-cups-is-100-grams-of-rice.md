<p>100 grams of rice equals approximately 0.5 cups (½ cup) when measured uncooked. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes, where precise measurements ensure perfect results. Whether you're making fried rice, rice cakes, or a side dish, knowing how many cups 100 grams of rice is can make all the difference. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we focus on accurate conversions to help you cook with confidence.</p>  

<h2>Understanding Rice Measurements</h2>  
<p>Rice measurements can vary depending on the type of rice and whether it's cooked or uncooked. For example, 100 grams of uncooked long-grain white rice typically fills about ½ cup, while short-grain rice may be slightly more compact. When cooked, rice expands, so 100 grams of uncooked rice yields roughly 1.5 to 2 cups of cooked rice. This is crucial for portioning meals in your air fryer, especially if you're meal prepping or following a recipe from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>our recipe collection</a>.</p>  

<p>Different rice types, like basmati, jasmine, or brown rice, have slightly different densities. Brown rice, for instance, is less dense than white rice, meaning 100 grams might take up slightly more volume. Always check the packaging or use a kitchen scale for the most accurate measurement. If you're unsure, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> can help you adjust quantities effortlessly.</p>  

<h3>Why Measuring Rice Correctly Matters</h3>  
<p>Accurate rice measurements ensure your air fryer dishes turn out perfectly every time. Too much rice can lead to uneven cooking, while too little might leave you with a dry or underwhelming dish. Whether you're making a quick stir-fry or a hearty rice pudding, knowing how many cups 100 grams of rice is will help you achieve the right texture and flavour. For more tips on perfecting your air fryer meals, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/meal-prep>meal prep recipes</a>.</p>  

<h2>Converting Grams to Cups for Different Rice Types</h2>  
<p>Not all rice is created equal, and conversions can vary. For example, 100 grams of basmati rice is roughly 0.53 cups, while the same weight of jasmine rice is about 0.48 cups. Brown rice, being less dense, measures closer to 0.55 cups per 100 grams. These small differences matter in air fryer cooking, where precision ensures even cooking and optimal texture.</p>  

<p>If you're working with specialty rice like wild rice or black rice, the conversion may differ further. Always refer to the packaging or use a digital scale for the most accurate results. For more detailed conversions, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion guide</a>, which covers everything from rice to other common ingredients.</p>  

<h3>Tips for Measuring Rice Without a Scale</h3>  
<p>If you don't have a kitchen scale, you can still measure 100 grams of rice using standard cups. A general rule is that 1 cup of uncooked rice weighs about 200 grams, so half a cup will give you roughly 100 grams. However, this method isn't as precise as weighing, so for best results, invest in a cheap digital scale. It's a small tool that makes a big difference, especially when following air fryer recipes from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>.</p>  

<h2>Common Mistakes When Measuring Rice</h2>  
<p>One of the biggest mistakes is confusing cooked and uncooked rice measurements. Remember, 100 grams of uncooked rice yields much more once cooked. Another error is packing rice into the cup, which can lead to over-measuring. Instead, lightly spoon the rice into the measuring cup and level it off for accuracy. These small adjustments ensure your air fryer dishes turn out just right.</p>  

<p>Using the wrong type of cup (e.g., a US cup vs. a UK cup) can also throw off measurements. A US cup is 240ml, while a UK cup is 250ml, a small but meaningful difference. Always double-check which measurement system your recipe uses.

<h3>How to Store Leftover Rice</h3>  
<p>If you've cooked too much rice, store it in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 3 days. You can reheat it in the air fryer for a quick and crispy texture. Just spread it out in the basket and heat at 180°C for 3-5 minutes.

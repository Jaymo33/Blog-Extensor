<p>20 grams of rapeseed oil equals approximately 0.71 ounces. This conversion is essential for air fryer cooking, where precise measurements can make all the difference in texture and flavour. Whether you’re following a recipe from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> or experimenting with your own creations, knowing how to convert grams to ounces ensures accuracy.</p>

<h2>Why Convert 20g of Rapeseed Oil to Ounces?</h2>
<p>Many air fryer recipes, especially those from the UK, use metric measurements like grams. However, some cooks prefer working with ounces, particularly when using kitchen scales with imperial units. Converting 20g of rapeseed oil to ounces (0.71 oz) helps maintain consistency in your cooking. Rapeseed oil is a popular choice for air frying due to its high smoke point and neutral flavour, making it ideal for everything from crispy potatoes to succulent chicken.</p>
<p>If you’re exploring <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a>, you’ll often encounter measurements in grams. Having a quick conversion reference ensures you never miss a beat. For more detailed conversions, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>, which covers everything from weights to temperatures.</p>

<h2>How to Measure 20g of Rapeseed Oil Accurately</h2>
<p>Measuring 20g of rapeseed oil precisely is crucial for air fryer success. A digital kitchen scale set to grams is the most accurate tool, but if yours only displays ounces, you’ll need to know that 20g equals 0.71 oz. Alternatively, you can use a measuring spoon: 20g of rapeseed oil is roughly 1.5 tablespoons, though this method is less precise.</p>

<h3>Using Rapeseed Oil in Air Fryer Recipes</h3>
<p>Rapeseed oil is a versatile ingredient for air fryer cooking. Its light flavour won’t overpower dishes, and its high smoke point (around 230°C) makes it perfect for high-heat cooking. Whether you’re making crispy vegetables or golden chicken wings, 20g of rapeseed oil (0.71 oz) is often the perfect amount to coat ingredients evenly without excess grease.</p>

<h2>Common Recipes Using 20g of Rapeseed Oil</h2>
<p>Many <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipes</a> call for 20g of rapeseed oil to achieve that perfect crispiness. For example, a batch of air-fried chicken thighs might require this amount to ensure even browning. Similarly, roasted potatoes or other <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/potatoes>potato dishes</a> often use 20g of oil for optimal texture.</p>
<p>If you’re preparing frozen foods like fries or nuggets, 20g of rapeseed oil can enhance crispiness. Just remember to shake the basket halfway through cooking for even results.

<h3>Tips for Storing and Using Rapeseed Oil</h3>
<p>To keep your rapeseed oil fresh, store it in a cool, dark place away from direct sunlight. Always check the expiry date, as rancid oil can ruin your dish. When measuring 20g (0.71 oz) for air frying, pour slowly to avoid over-pouring. A clean air fryer is also essential—check out our guide on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaning</a> for best practices.</p>

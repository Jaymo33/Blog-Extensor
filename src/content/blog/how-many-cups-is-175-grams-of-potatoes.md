<h2>Best Potato Types for Air Frying</h2>  
<p>Not all potatoes are created equal when it comes to air frying. Russet and Maris Piper potatoes are ideal for crispy results due to their high starch content. For 175 grams of these varieties, you'll get perfectly golden wedges or chips in about 15-20 minutes. Sweet potatoes also work well but may require a light oil coating.</p>  

<p>Waxy potatoes like Charlotte or Jersey Royals hold their shape better but won't crisp up as much. If you're using these, 175 grams (1.25 cups) is still a good portion for roasting or air-frying.

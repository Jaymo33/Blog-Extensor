<p>350 grams of lentils equals approximately 1.75 cups when measured using standard UK or US cup measurements. This conversion ensures accuracy whether you're preparing a hearty lentil stew or a crispy air fryer snack. Getting the right measurement is key for perfect texture and cooking times, especially when using an air fryer. For more air fryer conversions, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Lentil Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Using the correct amount of lentils ensures your dishes cook evenly and retain the right texture. Too many lentils can overcrowd your air fryer basket, leading to uneven cooking, while too few might dry out. Lentils are a staple in many air fryer recipes, from crispy lentil patties to spiced lentil snacks. If you're new to air frying, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> for inspiration.</p>  

<p>Measuring 350 grams of lentils in cups is especially useful if you don’t have a kitchen scale handy. Different types of lentils (red, green, or brown) may vary slightly in density, but 1.75 cups is a reliable estimate. For best results, fluff the lentils before measuring to avoid compacting them. This ensures consistency across all your lentil-based dishes.</p>  

<h3>Types of Lentils and Their Measurements</h3>  
<p>Different lentil varieties can affect the final cup measurement slightly. Red lentils, for example, are smaller and may pack more densely, while green lentils are larger and fluffier. If precision is crucial, weighing your lentils is always the best method.

<h2>Converting Grams to Cups for Air Fryer Recipes</h2>  
<p>Converting 350 grams of lentils to cups is straightforward once you know the ratio. One cup of lentils typically weighs around 200 grams, so 350 grams works out to roughly 1.75 cups. This conversion is handy for scaling recipes up or down depending on your needs. If you're cooking for a crowd, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable recipes</a> offer great options.</p>  

<p>Air fryers excel at cooking lentils evenly, whether you're roasting them for crunch or baking them into patties. Always preheat your air fryer for the best results, and shake the basket occasionally to ensure even cooking. For cleaning tips, visit our guide on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner</a> to keep your appliance in top shape.</p>  

<h3>Common Mistakes When Measuring Lentils</h3>  
<p>Avoid scooping lentils directly from the bag with a cup, as this can lead to uneven measurements. Instead, spoon them lightly into the measuring cup and level off the top. Compacted lentils can throw off your recipe, leading to dry or undercooked results.

<p>0.5 cups of buttermilk equals approximately 118 ml, making it easy to measure for your air fryer recipes. Whether you’re baking fluffy pancakes or marinating chicken, precise measurements ensure perfect results every time. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we know how crucial accuracy is in cooking, especially when using an air fryer. This guide will help you convert cups to millilitres effortlessly, so you never have to second-guess your measurements again.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of buttermilk can make or break your air fryer recipes. Too little, and your baked goods might turn out dry; too much, and they could become soggy. Air fryers circulate hot air rapidly, so ingredient ratios need to be spot-on. That’s why knowing how many ml is 0.5 cups of buttermilk is essential for consistent results. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for other common measurements.</p>  

<p>Buttermilk adds tenderness and a slight tang to dishes, making it a favourite in both baking and marinades. Whether you’re making buttermilk fried chicken or fluffy scones, 0.5 cups (118 ml) is a common measurement in many recipes. If you’re working with a UK or US recipe, rest assured that this conversion remains the same—no need for adjustments.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure Buttermilk Correctly</h3>  
<p>For the most accurate results, use a liquid measuring jug rather than dry cups. Pour the buttermilk up to the 118 ml mark, ensuring it sits level for precision. If you don’t have a measuring jug, a standard UK metric cup holds 250 ml, so 0.5 cups would be half of that. Need more air fryer-friendly recipes?

If you’re new to air fryer cooking, start with something simple like buttermilk biscuits—they’re quick, easy, and delicious.

Remember, precise measurements are key in air frying, where even small deviations can affect texture and cooking time.

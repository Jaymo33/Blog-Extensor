If you purchase 5 kg of untrimmed chicken breast, the conversion to approximately 11 pounds applies to that total weight. However, after trimming away excess fat and connective tissue, the actual cooked weight will be slightly less. For most air fryer recipes, it's best to work with the trimmed weight for accurate portioning and cooking times."

    "acceptedAnswer": {
    "@type": "Answer",
    "text": "Converting 5 kg chicken breast to pounds (approximately 11 pounds) helps you understand the total quantity you're working with, but air fryer cooking times are based on portion size and thickness rather than total weight. You'll typically need to cook in batches to avoid overcrowding, with each batch taking 15-20 minutes at 180°C depending on thickness. The conversion knowledge mainly helps with meal planning and portion division rather than directly adjusting cooking times."

    "acceptedAnswer": {
    "@type": "Answer",
    "text": "Yes, the conversion of 5 kg to approximately 11 pounds applies to all chicken parts, including thighs, wings, and drumsticks, as the conversion is based on weight rather than cut. However, different chicken parts may require adjusted air fryer cooking times and temperatures. While the weight conversion remains consistent, cooking techniques might vary – for example, chicken thighs often benefit from slightly longer cooking times than breast meat at the same temperature."

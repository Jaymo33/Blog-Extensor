<p>5 grams of baking powder equals approximately 0.18 ounces. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precision matters, especially when baking cakes or bread. Whether you're using a digital scale or measuring spoons, knowing this conversion ensures your recipes turn out perfectly every time.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Baking</h2>  
<p>Baking powder is a leavening agent, and even small measurement errors can affect your air fryer recipes. Too much can make cakes bitter, while too little may leave them dense. That’s why converting 5g of baking powder to ounces (0.18 oz) correctly is crucial.

<p>Many UK bakers prefer grams, but some recipes use ounces. If you’re using an American recipe or a vintage cookbook, knowing how to convert 5g baking powder to oz ensures consistency. A digital kitchen scale is the most accurate tool, but measuring spoons can work if calibrated properly.</p>  

<h3>Tools for Measuring 5g of Baking Powder</h3>  
<p>A digital scale is the best way to measure 5g of baking powder (0.18 oz). If you don’t have one, use a teaspoon—5g is roughly 1 level teaspoon. For more precision, refer to our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> section, where we detail exact measurements for perfect results.</p>  

<h2>Common Mistakes When Converting 5g to Ounces</h2>  
<p>One mistake is confusing weight (grams/ounces) with volume (cups/spoons). Baking powder’s density means 5g isn’t the same as 5ml. Always use weight for accuracy. Another error is using outdated conversion charts—modern scales provide precise 5g-to-oz conversions (0.18 oz).</p>  

<p>For those using air fryers, compact spaces mean measurements must be spot-on. Too much baking powder can cause overflow, while too little may leave your cake flat.

<h3>How to Adjust Recipes Using 5g of Baking Powder</h3>  
<p>If a recipe calls for 5g of baking powder (0.18 oz) and you’re scaling up, multiply carefully. For example, doubling requires 10g (0.35 oz). Always sift baking powder to avoid clumps, especially in air fryer baking where even heat distribution is key.</p>  

<h2>Converting Other Baking Powder Amounts</h2>  
<p>Need to convert 10g, 15g, or more? Here’s a quick reference: 10g = 0.35 oz, 15g = 0.53 oz. Bookmark our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a> for easy access. Remember, accurate measurements are the secret to air fryer success.</p>

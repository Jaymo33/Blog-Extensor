<h2>Why accurate flour measurements matter</h2>  
<p>Baking is a science, and even small deviations in flour weight can affect texture and rise. Using 200g of plain flour (7.05 oz) ensures consistency, especially in air fryer baking where heat distribution is rapid. Too much flour can make baked goods dense, while too little may cause them to crumble. For foolproof results, always weigh your ingredients.

<p>Many UK recipes use grams, but some older cookbooks or international sources list ounces. Knowing that 200g of plain flour is 7.05 oz helps bridge the gap. This is particularly useful for air fryer recipes, where precision ensures even cooking.

<h3>How to measure 200g of plain flour without scales</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have scales, you can use the spoon-and-level method. Lightly spoon flour into a measuring cup and level it off with a knife. However, this method is less accurate than weighing, as 200g of plain flour can vary in volume depending on how it’s packed. For best results, invest in digital scales—they’re a game-changer for air fryer baking.</p>  

<h2>Converting other flour amounts</h2>  
<p>Need to convert a different amount? Here’s a quick reference: 100g of plain flour is 3.53 oz, and 250g is 8.82 oz. These conversions are handy for scaling recipes up or down.

<p>Remember, plain flour (all-purpose flour) has a different weight-to-volume ratio than self-raising or wholemeal flour. Always check the type of flour specified in your recipe. If you’re adapting recipes for the air fryer, precise measurements like 200g to 7.05 oz ensure success.

<h3>Common mistakes when measuring flour</h3>  
<p>Scooping flour directly from the bag compacts it, leading to more than 200g per cup. Always fluff the flour first, then spoon it into your measuring tool. For air fryer recipes, even small errors can affect cooking times and textures. Stick to weight measurements for reliability, especially when converting 200g of plain flour to ounces.</p>

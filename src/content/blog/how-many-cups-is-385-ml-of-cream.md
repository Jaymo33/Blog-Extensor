<p>385 ml of cream is approximately 1.63 cups in the UK or 1.62 cups in the US. This conversion is essential for accurate baking and cooking, especially when using an air fryer. Whether you're whipping up a dessert or preparing a creamy sauce, knowing the exact measurement ensures perfect results every time.

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter</h2>
<p>Precision is key when it comes to baking and cooking, particularly with ingredients like cream. Too much or too little can alter the texture and taste of your dish. For air fryer recipes, where consistency is crucial, getting the measurement right ensures even cooking. A slight variation in cream quantity can affect the outcome of cakes, sauces, or even creamy pasta dishes. That’s why knowing how many cups 385 ml of cream equals is so important.</p>

<p>If you’re using an air fryer for baking, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for other handy measurements. Cream is a versatile ingredient, and accurate conversions help you avoid kitchen mishaps. Whether you’re making a classic Victoria sponge or a rich carbonara, precise measurements make all the difference.</p>

<h2>UK vs. US Cup Measurements</h2>
<p>It’s worth noting that cup measurements differ slightly between the UK and the US. In the UK, 1 cup equals 250 ml, while in the US, it’s 240 ml. This means 385 ml of cream converts to 1.63 cups in the UK and 1.62 cups in the US. While the difference is minimal, it’s something to keep in mind for recipes requiring exact proportions.</p>

<h3>How to Measure Cream Without a Scale</h3>
<p>If you don’t have a kitchen scale, using measuring cups is the next best option. Pour the cream slowly into the cup, ensuring it reaches the correct line. For 385 ml, you’ll need just over 1.5 cups in both UK and US measurements.

<h2>Common Uses for 385 ml of Cream</h2>
<p>Cream is a staple in many recipes, from desserts to savoury dishes. With 385 ml, you can make a luxurious whipped cream topping, a creamy mushroom sauce, or even a rich ice cream base. In an air fryer, cream-based dishes like custards or cheesecakes turn out perfectly with the right measurements.

<h3>Tips for Storing Leftover Cream</h3>
<p>If you have leftover cream, store it in an airtight container in the fridge. It typically lasts 3-4 days, but always check for spoilage before use. You can also freeze cream for longer storage, though it may separate when thawed. Shake or whisk it to restore consistency before using it in recipes.</p>

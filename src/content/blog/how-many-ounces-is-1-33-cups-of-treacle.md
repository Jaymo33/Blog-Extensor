<p>1.33 cups of treacle equals approximately 10.64 ounces. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements can make or break your dish. Whether you’re baking a sticky toffee pudding or glazing meats, knowing the exact weight ensures consistency. Treacle, a thick and sticky syrup, can be tricky to measure, so converting cups to ounces simplifies the process. For more air fryer conversions, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>

<h2>Why Convert Cups to Ounces for Treacle?</h2>
<p>Measuring treacle by weight (ounces) is far more accurate than using volume (cups). Treacle’s thick consistency means it can settle or trap air, leading to inconsistent cup measurements. Ounces provide a reliable standard, especially for air fryer recipes where precision matters. If you’re working with a recipe from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>our collection</a>, you’ll often find weights listed for this reason. Converting 1.33 cups of treacle to ounces ensures your dish turns out perfectly every time.</p>

<p>Another benefit of using ounces is scalability. Doubling or halving a recipe becomes effortless when you’re working with weight rather than volume. This is particularly useful for batch cooking or meal prepping in your air fryer. For more tips on scaling recipes, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/meal-prep>meal prep category</a>.</p>

<h3>How to Measure Treacle Accurately</h3>
<p>To measure 1.33 cups of treacle, use a liquid measuring cup and a spatula. Coat the cup with a light layer of oil to help the treacle slide out easily. Fill the cup slightly above the 1.33-cup mark, then level it off with the spatula. For sticky ingredients like treacle, a digital kitchen scale is your best friend. Simply tare the scale with your container, then pour until you hit 10.64 ounces.</p>

<h2>Common Uses for Treacle in Air Fryer Recipes</h2>
<p>Treacle adds depth and sweetness to both sweet and savoury air fryer dishes. From glazing ham to enriching gingerbread cakes, its versatility is unmatched. If you’re new to cooking with treacle, start with our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>cake recipes</a> for foolproof results. The 1.33 cups to ounces conversion is especially handy here, as many cake recipes call for precise measurements.</p>

<p>Treacle also works wonders in marinades for meats like chicken or lamb. Its sticky texture helps coatings adhere better in the air fryer, creating a delicious caramelised finish. For savoury inspiration, browse our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipes</a>. Remember, 10.64 ounces of treacle will give you the perfect balance of sweetness and stickiness.</p>

<h3>Cleaning Up After Measuring Treacle</h3>
<p>Treacle’s sticky nature means cleanup can be a challenge. Always measure over a sheet of parchment paper to catch drips. For stubborn residue, warm water and dish soap usually do the trick. For tougher cleaning jobs, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner guide</a> has all the tips you need. Keeping your tools clean ensures accurate measurements every time you convert 1.33 cups of treacle to ounces.</p>

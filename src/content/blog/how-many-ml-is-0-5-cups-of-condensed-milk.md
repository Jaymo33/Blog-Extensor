<p>0.5 cups of condensed milk equals approximately 120 ml. This conversion is essential for precise baking and cooking, especially when using an air fryer where measurements can impact texture and consistency. Whether you’re making a creamy dessert or a rich sauce, knowing the exact ml equivalent ensures perfect results every time. For more air fryer conversions, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on precise ingredient ratios to achieve the best texture and flavour. Too much or too little condensed milk can throw off the balance of your recipe, leading to overly sweet or dry results. Measuring 0.5 cups of condensed milk correctly (120 ml) ensures consistency, whether you’re making fudgy brownies or a caramel drizzle. If you’re new to air fryer baking, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> for foolproof ideas.</p>  

<p>Condensed milk is thicker than regular milk, so using a liquid measuring cup or kitchen scale helps avoid errors. For sticky ingredients like this, lightly greasing your measuring cup can make pouring easier. If you’re scaling up a recipe, remember that 1 cup of condensed milk equals 240 ml—handy for larger batches of treats like banoffee pie or cheesecake.</p>  

<h3>Converting Cups to ml for Different Ingredients</h3>  
<p>Not all ingredients weigh the same per cup, so it’s crucial to use the right conversions. While 0.5 cups of condensed milk is 120 ml, the same volume of water would be 118 ml due to density differences. Always double-check conversions for sticky or dense ingredients to avoid mishaps. For more baking tips, visit our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert recipes</a> section.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for 0.5 Cups of Condensed Milk</h2>  
<p>This measurement is perfect for small-batch desserts, like air-fryer flan or tres leches cake. Condensed milk adds richness without overwhelming sweetness, making it ideal for balancing flavours. You could also use 120 ml to sweeten coffee, drizzle over pancakes, or mix into homemade ice cream. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>cake recipes</a> for inspiration.</p>  

<p>If you’re meal prepping, 0.5 cups (120 ml) of condensed milk can be portioned into smaller servings for quick dessert toppings. It’s also a key ingredient in no-churn ice cream bases—just whip it with cream and freeze. For savoury twists, try adding a splash to curries or glazes for a touch of sweetness.</p>  

<h3>Tips for Measuring Sticky Ingredients</h3>  
<p>Condensed milk can be messy to measure, so here’s a pro tip: warm the can slightly in warm water to make pouring smoother. Alternatively, use a silicone spatula to scrape every last bit from the measuring cup.

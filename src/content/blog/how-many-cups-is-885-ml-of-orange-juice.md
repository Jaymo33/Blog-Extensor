<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>
<p>Precision is key when using an air fryer, as even small deviations can affect texture and cooking time. Converting 885 ml of orange juice to cups ensures your recipes turn out just right. For example, a cake batter with too much liquid might not rise properly, while a marinade with too little could lack flavour. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more handy measurement tips.</p>

<p>Many air fryer recipes, especially those for desserts or glazes, rely on precise liquid measurements.

This is particularly useful for recipes like orange drizzle cake or sticky chicken wings, where balance is everything.</p>

<h2>How to Measure 885 ml of Orange Juice Without a Measuring Cup</h2>
<p>Don't have a measuring cup? No problem. A standard UK mug holds about 250 ml, so 885 ml would be just over 3.5 mugs. Alternatively, use a kitchen scale—orange juice weighs roughly 1.04 grams per ml, so 885 ml would be around 920 grams.

<p>If you're using US cups (240 ml), 885 ml of orange juice equals about 3.69 cups. For metric cups (250 ml), it's closer to 3.54 cups. Always double-check which cup measurement your recipe uses to avoid mishaps. This is especially important for air fryer baking, where precision ensures even cooking.</p>

<h2>Common Uses for 885 ml of Orange Juice in Air Fryer Recipes</h2>
<p>From marinades to glazes, 885 ml of orange juice is a versatile ingredient. Try it in an orange-glazed salmon or a citrus-infused cake—both cook beautifully in the air fryer. For inspiration, browse our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert category</a> for sweet and tangy treats.</p>

<p>Another great use for 885 ml of orange juice is in homemade BBQ sauces or sticky ribs. The acidity tenderises meat while adding a bright, fresh flavour.

<h3>Storing Leftover Orange Juice</h3>
<p>If you don't use all 885 ml of orange juice, store it in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 3 days. Alternatively, freeze it in ice cube trays for future recipes. This way, you'll always have the right amount on hand for spontaneous air fryer creations.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter</h2>
<p>Using the right amount of coconut milk can make or break your dish. Too much liquid can lead to soggy results, while too little might leave your food dry.

<h2>How to Measure Coconut Milk Correctly</h2>
<p>Measuring liquids like coconut milk can be tricky, especially if you don’t have a measuring jug. A standard cup holds 240 ml, so 685 ml is just under three cups. For the most accurate results, use a liquid measuring cup with clear markings. If you’re using a can of coconut milk, give it a good shake before measuring to ensure consistency. This is particularly important for air fryer recipes, where even small discrepancies can affect the outcome.</p>

<h3>Using Coconut Milk in Air Fryer Recipes</h3>
<p>Coconut milk is a versatile ingredient that works beautifully in air fryer recipes. From marinades to desserts, its creamy texture enhances flavours and adds moisture. For instance, a splash of coconut milk can elevate a simple chicken curry or add richness to a vegan dessert.

<h2>Converting Other Measurements</h2>
<p>While 685 ml of coconut milk equals 2.9 cups, it’s helpful to know other common conversions. For example, 250 ml is roughly one cup, and 500 ml is about two cups. These conversions come in handy when adjusting recipe quantities or working with different measuring systems. If you’re baking, precision is key, so always double-check your measurements.

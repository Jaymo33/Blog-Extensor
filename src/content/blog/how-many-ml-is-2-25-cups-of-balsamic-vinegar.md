<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on precise cooking times and ingredient ratios to deliver crispy, evenly cooked results. Using too much or too little balsamic vinegar can throw off the balance of flavours and textures. For example, a marinade with 2.25 cups of balsamic vinegar (532.32 ml) needs the right acidity to tenderise meat without overpowering it. Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> for dishes that make the most of this versatile ingredient.</p>  

<p>Measuring liquids like balsamic vinegar correctly is especially important in air fryer baking. A sticky glaze or sauce requires the right viscosity to coat foods evenly. Too much liquid can lead to soggy results, while too little might leave your dish dry. Always use a measuring jug with millilitre markings for the best accuracy.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure Balsamic Vinegar for Air Fryer Recipes</h3>  
<p>To measure 2.25 cups of balsamic vinegar (532.32 ml), use a liquid measuring cup placed on a flat surface. Pour slowly until the meniscus aligns with the 532 ml mark. For smaller quantities, a tablespoon (15 ml) or teaspoon (5 ml) can help fine-tune the measurement. If you're scaling a recipe, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a> simplifies the maths.</p>

<h3>Converting Between US and UK Measurements</h3>

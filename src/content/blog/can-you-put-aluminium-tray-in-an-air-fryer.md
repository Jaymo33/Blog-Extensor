<p>Yes, you can put an aluminium tray in an air fryer, but with precautions. Aluminium trays won’t melt under normal air frying temperatures, but they can block airflow, leading to uneven cooking. Always ensure the tray fits properly and doesn’t touch the heating element. For more tips on safe air fryer use, check out <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>.</p>  

<h2>Is It Safe to Use Aluminium Trays in an Air Fryer?</h2>  
<p>Aluminium trays are generally safe for air fryers if used correctly. The material can withstand temperatures up to 250°C, which is well within most air fryer ranges. However, improper use can cause issues like restricted airflow or even damage to the fryer’s non-stick coating. Always check your air fryer’s manual for specific guidelines on metal use.</p>  

<p>Some air fryer brands, like Ninja, explicitly allow aluminium trays, while others advise against them. If you’re unsure, opt for air fryer-safe alternatives like silicone or parchment liners. For a full breakdown of compatible accessories, visit <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>our conversion chart</a>.</p>  

<h3>Will an Aluminium Tray Melt or Catch Fire?</h3>  
<p>No, aluminium trays won’t melt in an air fryer under normal conditions. The melting point of aluminium is around 660°C, far higher than air fryer temperatures. However, if the tray is too thin or crumpled, it might warp or disrupt airflow, affecting cooking performance.</p>  

<h2>Best Practices for Using Aluminium Trays</h2>  
<p>To avoid uneven cooking, place the aluminium tray in the air fryer basket without overcrowding. Ensure at least an inch of space around the edges for proper air circulation. For recipes requiring crispiness, like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/potatoes>air-fried potatoes</a>, skip the tray altogether for direct heat exposure.</p>  

<p>If reheating food, an aluminium tray can be handy but may extend cooking time. For quick reheating tips, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a>. Always monitor the first few minutes to ensure the tray isn’t blocking heat distribution.</p>  

<h3>Can Aluminium Trays Damage Your Air Fryer?</h3>  
<p>While rare, poorly fitted trays can scratch the basket or interfere with the heating element. Stick to trays labelled as air fryer-safe, and avoid folding edges that could disrupt airflow. For cleaning scratched surfaces, try <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>our recommended cleaner</a>.</p>  

<h2>Alternatives to Aluminium Trays</h2>  
<p>Silicone liners and parchment paper are excellent substitutes for aluminium trays. They’re non-reactive, promote even cooking, and are easier to clean. For delicate foods like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/fish>white fish</a>, these alternatives prevent sticking without compromising crispiness.</p>  

<p>If you must use aluminium, opt for perforated trays designed for air fryers. These allow better airflow while containing mess. Always prioritise safety and efficiency to extend your air fryer’s lifespan.</p>

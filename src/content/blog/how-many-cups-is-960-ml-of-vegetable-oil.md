<p>960 ml of vegetable oil equals approximately 4.06 cups. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes, where precise measurements can make or break your dish. Whether you're whipping up crispy chips or a moist cake, knowing how to convert millilitres to cups ensures consistent results every time.</p>  

<h2>Understanding the Conversion</h2>  
<p>Converting millilitres to cups isn’t as tricky as it seems. One standard cup holds roughly 236.6 ml, so dividing 960 ml by this number gives you the cup equivalent. For air fryer cooking, accuracy matters—especially when dealing with oils, as too much or too little can affect texture and flavour. If you’re unsure, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for quick reference.</p>  

<p>Different oils have slightly varying densities, but vegetable oil’s conversion is straightforward. Whether you're following a recipe from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> or adjusting one, this measurement ensures your dish turns out just right. For baking, where precision is crucial, measuring correctly prevents dry or overly greasy results.</p>  

<h3>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Frying</h3>  
<p>Air fryers circulate hot air to cook food evenly, and oil plays a key role in achieving that perfect crisp. Too little oil, and your food may turn out dry; too much, and it could become soggy. That’s why knowing that 960 ml of vegetable oil is roughly 4 cups helps maintain balance. For more tips, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a>.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for 960 ml of Vegetable Oil</h2>  
<p>This quantity is often used in larger batches of fried foods, marinades, or baking. If you’re meal prepping or cooking for a crowd, 960 ml (or 4 cups) ensures you have enough oil without constant refills. For example, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipes</a> often call for generous oil amounts to achieve that golden crunch.</p>  

<p>Deep-frying in an air fryer isn’t common, but some recipes benefit from a light oil coating. Measuring 960 ml accurately means you can portion it out for multiple dishes. If you’re unsure how much to use, start with less—you can always add more as needed.</p>  

<h3>Converting Between Metric and Imperial</h3>  
<p>While the UK primarily uses millilitres, some older recipes still reference cups. Knowing that 960 ml of vegetable oil equals about 4 cups bridges the gap between measurement systems. For more conversions, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion guide</a> simplifies the process.</p>  

<h2>Tips for Measuring Oil in an Air Fryer</h2>  
<p>Using a liquid measuring cup is the easiest way to measure 960 ml of vegetable oil. Pour slowly to avoid spills, and check at eye level for accuracy. If you’re working with smaller quantities, remember that 240 ml equals 1 cup—so 960 ml is four times that amount.</p>  

<p>For sticky or thick oils, lightly grease the measuring cup first to ensure all the oil pours out cleanly. This trick is especially helpful when preparing <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>desserts</a>, where every drop counts. After measuring, don’t forget to clean your air fryer basket with our recommended <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner</a>.</p>

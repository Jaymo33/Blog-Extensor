<p>Reheating rotisserie chicken in an air fryer is simple—set it to 160°C (320°F) and cook for 3–5 minutes until heated through. This method locks in moisture while crisping the skin, making it taste freshly cooked. Whether you’ve stored it in the fridge or have leftovers from last night, your air fryer is the best tool for the job.

<h2>Why Use an Air Fryer to Reheat Rotisserie Chicken?</h2>  
<p>The air fryer’s rapid hot air circulation ensures even reheating without drying out the meat. Unlike microwaving, which can leave chicken rubbery, the air fryer restores crispiness to the skin while keeping the inside tender. It’s also faster than using an oven, making it perfect for quick meals.

<p>Another advantage is portion control—you can reheat just what you need, reducing waste. The air fryer also requires minimal preheating, so your leftovers are ready in minutes. For those who meal prep, this method ensures your chicken stays delicious all week. Need help with conversions?

<h3>Best Temperature for Reheating Rotisserie Chicken</h3>  
<p>160°C (320°F) is the sweet spot—hot enough to crisp the skin but gentle enough to prevent overcooking. If your chicken is particularly thick, increase the time slightly rather than the temperature. Avoid going above 180°C (350°F), as higher heat can dry out the meat. For frozen rotisserie chicken, thaw it first for best results.</p>  

<h2>Step-by-Step Guide to Reheating Rotisserie Chicken</h2>  
<p>Start by placing the chicken pieces in a single layer in the air fryer basket—overcrowding leads to uneven heating. Lightly spritz with oil if you want extra crispiness, but it’s not essential. Set the timer for 3 minutes, then check the internal temperature with a meat thermometer (it should reach 74°C/165°F). For larger portions, add 1–2 minutes as needed.</p>  

<p>If reheating a whole rotisserie chicken, consider breaking it down into smaller pieces first. This ensures faster, more even results. For extra flavour, brush the chicken with a little broth or butter before reheating. Looking for more ways to use your air fryer?

<h3>Tips for Keeping Chicken Moist</h3>  
<p>To prevent dryness, avoid reheating for too long—check every minute after the initial 3 minutes. Covering the chicken loosely with foil for the first half of cooking can help retain moisture. If the skin isn’t crispy enough, finish with a 1-minute blast at 180°C (350°F). Always let the chicken rest for a minute before serving.</p>  

<h2>Common Mistakes to Avoid</h2>  
<p>One major mistake is reheating straight from frozen—this leads to uneven cooking and dry edges. Always thaw fridge-cold chicken first for best texture. Another error is skipping the preheat—while not always necessary, it ensures consistent results. Overcrowding the basket is another culprit; give each piece space for proper air circulation.</p>  

<p>Using too high a temperature is also problematic—it’s better to reheat gently and extend the time if needed. Finally, forgetting to check the internal temperature can result in undercooked or overcooked chicken.

<h3>How to Store Rotisserie Chicken for Reheating</h3>  
<p>Store leftover rotisserie chicken in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 3 days. For longer storage, freeze portions in freezer-safe bags—they’ll keep for 2–3 months. When ready to reheat, thaw overnight in the fridge first. Proper storage ensures your chicken stays fresh and safe to eat.</p>

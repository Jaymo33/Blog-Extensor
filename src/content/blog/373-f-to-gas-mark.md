At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we specialise in making these conversions simple for home cooks. Whether you're baking or roasting, Gas Mark 5 (373 F) delivers consistent, reliable results.</p>

<h2>Why Convert 373 F to Gas Mark?</h2>
<p>Many British recipes use Gas Mark temperatures, while air fryers often display Fahrenheit or Celsius. Converting 373 F to Gas Mark 5 ensures you can follow any recipe accurately. This is especially useful for baking, where precise temperatures matter. Air fryers cook faster than ovens, so adjusting the temperature correctly prevents overcooking.

<p>Gas Mark 5 (373 F) is a versatile temperature for many dishes. It's hot enough to crisp up roasted potatoes but gentle enough for delicate cakes. If you're new to air frying, start with this setting for foolproof results. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a> includes plenty of ideas for Gas Mark 5 cooking. From crispy chicken to fluffy muffins, this temperature works wonders in an air fryer.</p>

<h3>Common Dishes Cooked at 373 F (Gas Mark 5)</h3>
<p>Roasted vegetables, such as carrots and potatoes, turn out perfectly at 373 F (Gas Mark 5). This temperature caramelises their natural sugars without burning them. Cakes and muffins also bake evenly at this setting, with a golden crust and soft centre. Even frozen foods, like fish fingers or chicken nuggets, crisp up nicely.

<h2>How to Adjust Cooking Times for Air Fryers</h2>
<p>Air fryers cook faster than conventional ovens, so you'll need to reduce cooking times by about 20%. For example, if a recipe says 30 minutes at Gas Mark 5, try 24 minutes in your air fryer. Always check food a few minutes early to avoid overcooking. Preheating your air fryer ensures even cooking, just like an oven. For more detailed guidance, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning and maintenance tips</a> help keep your appliance in top condition.</p>

<p>Different air fryer models may vary slightly in temperature accuracy. If your food isn't cooking evenly, try rotating the basket halfway through. Smaller portions cook faster, so adjust times accordingly. Remember, 373 F (Gas Mark 5) is a starting pointâ€”feel free to tweak it based on your preferences. With practice, you'll master air frying at this temperature for consistently delicious meals.</p>

<h3>Tips for Perfect Results at 373 F</h3>
<p>Use a light spray of oil to help food crisp up at 373 F (Gas Mark 5). Don't overcrowd the basket, as this prevents proper air circulation. Shake or turn food halfway through cooking for even browning. For baked goods, use oven-safe dishes that fit your air fryer basket. With these tips, you'll get restaurant-quality results at home.</p>

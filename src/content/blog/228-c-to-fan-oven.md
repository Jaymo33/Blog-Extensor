<p>228 C converts to approximately 200 C in a fan oven. This 20-degree reduction is standard for fan-assisted cooking, ensuring even heat distribution without overcooking. Whether you're baking, roasting, or adapting recipes for your air fryer, this conversion is essential for perfect results every time.</p>

<h2>Understanding Fan Oven Conversions</h2>
<p>Fan ovens circulate hot air constantly, cooking food faster and more evenly than conventional ovens. When a recipe states 228 C, reducing it to 200 C in a fan oven prevents burning or drying out. This rule applies whether you're using a built-in oven or countertop models like those from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>'s recommended brands.</p>
<p>For air fryer users, the principle remains similar. Most air fryers operate like mini convection ovens, so the 228 C to 200 C conversion still holds true. Check our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for specific model adjustments, especially when preparing crispy <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipes</a> or baked goods.</p>

<h3>Why 228 C Requires Adjustment</h3>
<p>The forced air in fan ovens transfers heat more efficiently than radiant heat in conventional ovens. At 228 C, this intensity could lead to overbrowning or uneven cooking. Dropping to 200 C gives you better control, whether you're roasting vegetables or testing <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>new recipes</a>.</p>

<h2>Air Fryer Adaptations</h2>
<p>Modern air fryers typically max out around 200 C, making them ideal for this converted temperature. When your recipe calls for 228 C, set your air fryer to 200 C and monitor cooking time - it may finish 20% faster. This works perfectly for <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/potatoes>roast potatoes</a> or reheating frozen foods.</p>
<p>Some premium air fryer models offer higher temperature ranges. If yours reaches 228 C, use it sparingly for quick searing or crisping, but reduce cooking time by 15-20%. Always refer to your manufacturer's guidelines and our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning tips</a> to maintain performance.</p>

<h3>Baking at 228 C Equivalent</h3>
<p>For baked goods requiring 228 C, the 200 C fan setting helps prevent domed tops or cracked surfaces. The even heat promotes uniform rising, especially important for cakes and pastries. Preheat thoroughly and consider rotating trays halfway for perfect results.</p>

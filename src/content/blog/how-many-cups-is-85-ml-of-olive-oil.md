<p>85 ml of olive oil is approximately 0.36 cups in the US measurement system and 0.30 cups in the UK system. Whether you're preparing a delicious air fryer recipe or baking, accurate measurements are key to perfect results. Olive oil is a staple in many kitchens, and knowing how to convert millilitres to cups ensures your dishes turn out just right.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Olive Oil Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Using the correct amount of olive oil can make or break a recipe. Too little, and your dish might turn out dry; too much, and it could become greasy. For air fryer cooking, precision is especially important because the appliance relies on hot air circulation. A slight imbalance in oil can affect texture and crispiness. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we emphasise the importance of accurate measurements for consistent results.</p>  

<p>Olive oil is commonly used in both savoury and sweet dishes, from roasted vegetables to cakes. If you're following a recipe from another country, you might need to convert between millilitres and cups. This guide simplifies that process, so you can focus on creating delicious meals without second-guessing your measurements.</p>  

<h2>Converting 85 ml of Olive Oil to Cups</h2>  
<p>In the US, 1 cup equals 240 ml, meaning 85 ml of olive oil is roughly 0.36 cups. In the UK, where 1 cup is 284 ml, 85 ml converts to about 0.30 cups. These small differences matter, especially in baking, where precision is crucial. If you're using an air fryer, sticking to the right measurement ensures even cooking and perfect crispiness.</p>  

<p>For quick reference, here’s a handy conversion table for olive oil measurements:</p>  

<ul>  
<li>85 ml = 0.36 US cups</li>  
<li>85 ml = 0.30 UK cups</li>  
<li>85 ml = 5.75 tablespoons (US)</li>  
<li>85 ml = 4.8 tablespoons (UK)</li>  
</ul>  

<h3>Measuring Olive Oil Without a Scale</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a measuring jug or scale, you can use tablespoons to measure 85 ml of olive oil. In the US, 1 tablespoon is about 15 ml, so 85 ml equals roughly 5.75 tablespoons. In the UK, 1 tablespoon is 17.7 ml, making 85 ml approximately 4.8 tablespoons. While not as precise as a measuring cup, this method works in a pinch.</p>  

<h2>Using 85 ml of Olive Oil in Air Fryer Recipes</h2>  
<p>Olive oil is a fantastic choice for air fryer cooking because of its high smoke point and rich flavour. Whether you're making crispy potatoes, chicken, or vegetables, 85 ml of olive oil is enough to coat ingredients evenly. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> for inspiration on how to use this measurement effectively.</p>  

<p>For example, tossing sweet potato fries in 85 ml of olive oil before air frying ensures they come out golden and crispy. You can also use this amount to marinate chicken or drizzle over vegetables for roasting. The key is to distribute the oil evenly for consistent cooking.</p>  

<h3>Adjusting Recipes for Different Measurements</h3>  
<p>If a recipe calls for a different amount of olive oil, you can easily adjust it using our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>. This tool helps you switch between millilitres, cups, and tablespoons, so you never have to guess. Whether you're scaling up or down, accurate conversions ensure your dish turns out perfectly every time.</p>  

<h2>Common Mistakes When Measuring Olive Oil</h2>  
<p>One of the biggest mistakes is eyeballing measurements, which can lead to inconsistent results. Another is using the wrong type of cup—US and UK cups differ slightly, so always check which system your recipe follows. For best results, use a clear measuring jug with millilitre and cup markings.</p>  

<p>Storing olive oil properly also matters. Keep it in a cool, dark place to maintain its quality. If your oil has gone rancid, it can affect the taste of your dish, no matter how accurately you measure it.

<h3>Olive Oil Substitutes in Air Fryer Cooking</h3>  
<p>If you run out of olive oil, you can substitute it with other oils like avocado, sunflower, or coconut oil. Just remember that each oil has a different smoke point and flavour profile, which might slightly alter your dish. For baking, melted butter can also work, though it will change the texture.</p>

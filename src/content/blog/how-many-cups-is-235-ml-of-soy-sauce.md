<p>235 ml of soy sauce equals approximately 1 cup in US measurements or just under 1 cup (0.98 cups) in UK measurements. Whether you're preparing a marinade for air-fried chicken or whipping up a stir-fry sauce, knowing this conversion ensures your dish turns out perfectly every time. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we understand how crucial precise measurements are for air fryer cooking.</p>

<h2>Understanding the Conversion</h2>
<p>The difference between US and UK cup measurements can be confusing, but it's essential for accuracy. In the US, 1 cup equals 240 ml, making 235 ml of soy sauce just shy of a full cup. In the UK, 1 cup is 250 ml, so 235 ml translates to roughly 0.98 cups. This small variation matters when scaling recipes or adjusting flavours for air fryer dishes like teriyaki salmon or glazed tofu.</p>

<p>For air fryer cooking, where sauces reduce quickly due to the intense heat, getting the liquid measurements right ensures balanced flavours. Whether you're following a recipe from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>our collection</a> or creating your own, this conversion helps maintain consistency. Always measure soy sauce carefully, as its saltiness can overpower a dish if overused.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Soy Sauce Measurements Matter</h2>
<p>Soy sauce isn't just a condiment - it's a powerful flavour builder in marinades, glazes, and dipping sauces for air-fried foods. Too little, and your dish might lack depth; too much, and it becomes unpalatably salty. When working with 235 ml of soy sauce (about 1 cup), you're typically preparing enough for multiple servings or batch cooking.</p>

<p>Many popular air fryer recipes, like those in our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken category</a>, use soy sauce as a base ingredient. The 235 ml measurement often appears in recipes for 4-6 portions. Understanding this conversion helps when halving or doubling recipes for your air fryer. Remember that soy sauce's intensity varies by brand, so always taste as you cook.</p>

<h3>Measuring Tools for Precision</h3>
<p>For the most accurate measurement of 235 ml of soy sauce, use a liquid measuring cup with clear metric and imperial markings. Glass measures allow you to check the meniscus (the liquid's curve) at eye level for precision. If you only have standard cups, remember that 235 ml is just under 1 cup in US measurements and slightly more than Â¾ cup plus 2 tablespoons in UK measurements.</p>

<h2>Converting Soy Sauce for Different Recipes</h2>
<p>When adapting recipes between measurement systems, the 235 ml to cups conversion becomes particularly valuable. For instance, if an American recipe calls for 1 cup of soy sauce (240 ml), and you're using UK measurements, you'd need about 235 ml to achieve a similar result. This small adjustment ensures your air-fried dishes maintain their intended flavour profile.</p>

<p>Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a> includes this and other common measurement translations to simplify your cooking process. Whether you're making crispy tofu with a soy-based glaze or marinating chicken wings, precise measurements lead to better results. The 235 ml measurement frequently appears in Asian-inspired air fryer recipes where balanced flavours are crucial.</p>

<h3>Tips for Working With Soy Sauce</h3>
<p>Soy sauce's viscosity means it pours differently than water, affecting measurements. To accurately measure 235 ml, place your measuring cup on a level surface and pour slowly. For sticky sauces, lightly grease the measuring cup first to ensure all the soy sauce slides out. These techniques help when preparing marinades for air-fried dishes like our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable recipes</a> that often use soy-based sauces.</p>

<h2>Common Uses for 235 ml of Soy Sauce</h2>
<p>This quantity of soy sauce typically serves as the base for multiple air fryer meals. You might use it in a teriyaki glaze for salmon fillets, a marinade for chicken thighs, or a seasoning liquid for stir-fried vegetables. The 235 ml (approximately 1 cup) measurement is versatile enough for family-sized portions while being easy to scale if needed.</p>

<p>When cleaning after working with soy sauce, remember that it can stain and leave odours.

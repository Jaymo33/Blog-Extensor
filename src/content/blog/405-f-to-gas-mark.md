<h2>Tips for Cooking at 405 F or Gas Mark 6</h2>
<p>When cooking at 405 F or Gas Mark 6, always check your food halfway through. Air fryers circulate heat intensely, so items can cook faster than expected.

Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> team recommends rotating trays or shaking baskets for even browning.</p>
<p>Experiment with cook times, as air fryers vary by model. Start with the recommended time and adjust as needed. Keep in mind that 405 F or Gas Mark 6 is ideal for achieving a golden crust on foods. For delicate items like fish or tofu, you might reduce the temperature slightly to prevent drying out. Always refer to your air fryer's manual for specific guidance on high-heat cooking.</p>

<p>Reheating pizza in an air fryer at 160°C for 3-5 minutes restores its crispy base and gooey cheese perfectly. This method beats microwaving, which often leaves slices soggy, and is quicker than using a conventional oven. Whether you’re dealing with leftover delivery or homemade slices, your air fryer can bring them back to life with minimal effort.</p>

<h2>Why Use an Air Fryer to Reheat Pizza?</h2>
<p>An air fryer circulates hot air around the pizza, crisping the crust while gently warming the toppings. Unlike microwaves that steam food, air fryers preserve texture, making them ideal for reheating pizza. The compact size also means faster preheating and lower energy use compared to a full-sized oven. For more tips on optimising your air fryer, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>
<p>Leftover pizza often suffers from a limp base when reheated poorly. The air fryer solves this by evenly distributing heat, ensuring every bite stays delicious. Whether you prefer thin crust or deep pan, adjusting the time slightly can cater to different thicknesses. Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a> for creative ways to use your air fryer beyond reheating.</p>

<h2>Step-by-Step Guide to Reheating Pizza</h2>
<h3>Preheating Your Air Fryer</h3>
<p>Preheat your air fryer to 160°C for 2-3 minutes before adding the pizza. This ensures even cooking from the start and prevents a cold centre. Skipping this step might lead to uneven reheating, especially with thicker slices. Most models have a preheat function, but simply running it empty works too.</p>

<h3>Arranging the Slices</h3>
<p>Place pizza slices in a single layer, leaving space between them for air circulation. Overcrowding causes uneven crisping and longer reheating times. For extra crispiness, spritz the crust lightly with water or brush with olive oil. If reheating multiple slices, work in batches for consistent results.</p>

<h2>Optimal Temperature and Timing</h2>
<p>The ideal temperature to reheat pizza in an air fryer is 160°C for 3-5 minutes. Thicker slices or loaded toppings may need an extra minute, while thin crusts cook faster. Check at the 3-minute mark to avoid over-drying. For frozen pizza, add 1-2 minutes to the timing.</p>
<p>Different air fryer models may vary slightly, so adjust based on your appliance. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/frozen-foods>frozen foods guide</a> includes specific tips for reheating various items. Remember, it’s easier to add time than fix burnt pizza, so start conservatively.</p>

<h2>Tips for Perfect Reheated Pizza</h2>
<h3>Avoiding Sogginess</h3>
<p>Place a piece of kitchen paper under the pizza to absorb excess oil during reheating. This trick keeps the base crisp without making it greasy. For extra protection against sogginess, avoid stacking slices straight from the fridge – let them sit for 5 minutes first.</p>

<h3>Restoring Freshness</h3>
<p>Sprinkle a few drops of water on cheese areas before reheating to prevent drying out. Covering delicate toppings like fresh herbs with foil for the first half of cooking preserves their flavour. After reheating, let the pizza rest for a minute – the residual heat will finish the job perfectly.</p>

<h2>Cleaning Your Air Fryer After Use</h2>
<p>Once cooled, wipe your air fryer basket with warm soapy water to remove any cheese or sauce residue. For stubborn bits, soak the basket briefly before scrubbing. Regular cleaning maintains performance and prevents smoke from burnt-on food. Check our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning guide</a> for deep maintenance tips.</p>
<p>Always ensure the appliance is unplugged and completely cool before cleaning. Built-up grease can affect future cooking results and even become a fire hazard. For particularly messy reheating sessions, consider using parchment liners to simplify cleanup.</p>

<h3>How to measure 150g of plain yogurt without scales</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a scale, 150g of plain yogurt is roughly 5 heaped tablespoons or just under 2/3 of a standard UK cup (250ml). However, this method isn’t as accurate as weighing, so for best results, invest in a kitchen scale. Air fryer recipes often rely on precise ratios, especially for baking, where even small deviations can affect the outcome.</p>

<h3>Tips for storing and using plain yogurt in air fryer recipes</h3>  
<p>Always check the expiration date on your yogurt, as fresh ingredients yield the best results. If your recipe calls for 150g of plain yogurt but you’ve opened a larger tub, store the remainder in an airtight container in the fridge. Stir well before using, as yogurt can separate over time. For longer storage, consider freezing portions in 150g amounts, though the texture may change slightly when thawed.</p>

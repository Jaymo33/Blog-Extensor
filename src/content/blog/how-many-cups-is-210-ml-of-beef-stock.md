<h2>Understanding the Conversion: 210 ml to Cups</h2>

<h3>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h3>  
<p>Air fryers cook food quickly and evenly, but incorrect liquid measurements can lead to soggy or dry results. Using the right amount of beef stock ensures your dishes stay moist without becoming watery. This is especially important for recipes like air-fried beef casseroles or braised dishes, where liquid ratios affect cooking times.</p>  

<h2>How to Measure 210 ml of Beef Stock Without a Cup</h2>  
<p>If you don’t have a measuring cup, there are easy alternatives. A standard UK tablespoon holds 15 ml, so 14 tablespoons equal 210 ml. Alternatively, use a kitchen scale—210 ml of beef stock weighs the same in grams.

<p>Another handy trick is using a drinking glass—many hold around 200–250 ml, so filling it just below the rim will get you close to 210 ml. Just remember, accuracy matters most in baking and sauces, so investing in a good measuring jug is worth it.

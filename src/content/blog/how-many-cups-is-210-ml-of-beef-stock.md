<p>210 ml of beef stock equals approximately 0.89 cups (just under 1 cup). This conversion is essential for precise cooking, especially when using an air fryer for recipes like stews, gravies, or marinades. Getting the measurement right ensures your dishes turn out perfectly every time.</p>

<h2>Understanding the Conversion: 210 ml to Cups</h2>  
<p>Converting millilitres to cups can be tricky, especially when working with liquids like beef stock. The standard conversion is 1 cup = 236.59 ml, meaning 210 ml is roughly 0.89 cups. This measurement is crucial for air fryer recipes, where precision affects texture and flavour. Whether you’re making a rich beef stew or a savoury sauce, knowing how much stock to use makes all the difference.</p>  

<p>For those who prefer visualising measurements, 210 ml of beef stock fills a standard measuring cup just below the 1-cup line. If you don’t have a measuring cup, you can use a kitchen scale—210 ml of beef stock weighs about 210 grams. For more air fryer-friendly conversions, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>  

<h3>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h3>  
<p>Air fryers cook food quickly and evenly, but incorrect liquid measurements can lead to soggy or dry results. Using the right amount of beef stock ensures your dishes stay moist without becoming watery. This is especially important for recipes like air-fried beef casseroles or braised dishes, where liquid ratios affect cooking times.</p>  

<h2>How to Measure 210 ml of Beef Stock Without a Cup</h2>  
<p>If you don’t have a measuring cup, there are easy alternatives. A standard UK tablespoon holds 15 ml, so 14 tablespoons equal 210 ml. Alternatively, use a kitchen scale—210 ml of beef stock weighs the same in grams. For more tips on measuring ingredients, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> section.</p>  

<p>Another handy trick is using a drinking glass—many hold around 200–250 ml, so filling it just below the rim will get you close to 210 ml. Just remember, accuracy matters most in baking and sauces, so investing in a good measuring jug is worth it.

<h3>Common Recipes Using 210 ml of Beef Stock</h3>

<h2>UK vs. US Cup Measurements</h2>  
<p>While 210 ml of beef stock is roughly 0.89 US cups, UK cups differ slightly (1 UK cup = 284 ml). For air fryer recipes, stick to the US standard unless specified. This avoids confusion and ensures consistent results. Need more conversions? Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>chart</a> has you covered.</p>  

<p>Most modern recipes, including those on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, use metric or US cup measurements. Always double-check the recipe’s origin to avoid mishaps. A little attention to detail goes a long way in air fryer cooking!</p>

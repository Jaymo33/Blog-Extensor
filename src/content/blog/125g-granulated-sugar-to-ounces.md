While 125g of granulated sugar equals 4.41 ounces, caster sugar is finer and slightly denser.

    "@type": "Answer",
    "text": "If cookies with 125g (4.41 ounces) of sugar are burning in your air fryer, try reducing the temperature by 10-15°C. The intense, direct heat of air fryers causes sugar to caramelise faster than in conventional ovens. Also consider using parchment paper and checking progress a few minutes before the recipe suggests."

    "acceptedAnswer": {
    "@type": "Answer",
    "text": "At higher altitudes, you might need to slightly reduce the 125g (4.41 ounces) of sugar in air fryer recipes. The lower air pressure causes sugar to have greater sweetening power. Start with about 5% less sugar and adjust to taste, as air fryers already intensify flavours due to their concentrated cooking environment."

<p>125g of granulated sugar equals approximately 4.41 ounces. This conversion is essential for air fryer baking, where precise measurements can make or break your recipe. Whether you're making cookies, cakes, or other sweet treats in your air fryer, knowing how to convert grams to ounces ensures perfect results every time.</p>

<h2>Why accurate sugar measurements matter in air fryer baking</h2>
<p>Air fryers cook food differently than conventional ovens, often requiring adjustments to ingredient quantities. Using the correct amount of granulated sugar (125g or 4.41 ounces) ensures your baked goods have the right texture and sweetness. Too much sugar can cause over-browning, while too little may result in dry or bland results.</p>
<p>Many popular air fryer recipes, like those found on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, specify measurements in grams. Converting 125g of granulated sugar to ounces (4.41 oz) helps when using American recipes or kitchen scales that only display ounces. This small but crucial step can elevate your air fryer baking game significantly.</p>

<h2>How to measure 125g of granulated sugar without scales</h2>
<p>If you don't have digital scales, you can still measure 125g of granulated sugar using volume measurements. Approximately 125g equals 10 UK tablespoons or ⅔ cup of granulated sugar. However, for the most accurate results in air fryer cooking, we recommend investing in a good set of kitchen scales.</p>
<p>When preparing air fryer desserts like those in our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>cake recipes</a>, precise sugar measurements ensure consistent results. The compact cooking space of an air fryer means ingredient ratios are even more critical than in traditional oven baking.</p>

<h3>The science behind sugar in air fryer baking</h3>
<p>Granulated sugar does more than just sweeten your air fryer creations. At 125g (4.41 ounces), it contributes to browning, texture, and moisture retention. The rapid air circulation in air fryers causes sugar to caramelise faster, which is why getting the 125g measurement exactly right is so important.</p>

<h2>Converting other common sugar quantities</h2>
<p>While 125g of granulated sugar equals 4.41 ounces, you might need to convert other amounts too. For example, 100g is about 3.53 ounces, and 150g equals roughly 5.29 ounces. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> makes these calculations simple for all your baking needs.</p>
<p>Remember that different types of sugar have varying weights. The 125g to 4.41 ounce conversion applies specifically to granulated sugar. Icing sugar or brown sugar packed differently would yield different ounce measurements for the same gram weight.</p>

<h3>Tips for working with sugar in your air fryer</h3>
<p>When using 125g (4.41 ounces) of granulated sugar in air fryer recipes, consider reducing the temperature slightly to prevent over-browning. The concentrated heat can cause sugar to caramelise more quickly than in conventional ovens. Always preheat your air fryer for even cooking when working with sugar-based recipes.</p>

<h2>Common air fryer recipes using 125g of sugar</h2>
<p>Many classic air fryer desserts call for around 125g of granulated sugar (4.41 ounces). This includes small batch cakes, cookies, and even some fruit crumbles. The portion size is perfect for the compact capacity of most air fryers, yielding just enough for 2-4 servings.</p>
<p>For inspiration, check out our collection of <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert recipes</a> specifically designed for air fryers. From chocolate chip cookies to lemon drizzle cakes, these treats all benefit from precise sugar measurements like 125g converted accurately to ounces.</p>

<h3>Cleaning sugar residue from your air fryer</h3>
<p>After making sweet treats with 125g of granulated sugar, it's important to clean your air fryer properly. Sugar can caramelise and stick to the basket.

Whether you're making cookies, cakes, or other sweet treats in your air fryer, knowing how to convert grams to ounces ensures perfect results every time.</p>

<h2>Why accurate sugar measurements matter in air fryer baking</h2>
<p>Air fryers cook food differently than conventional ovens, often requiring adjustments to ingredient quantities. Using the correct amount of granulated sugar (125g or 4.41 ounces) ensures your baked goods have the right texture and sweetness.

<p>Many popular air fryer recipes, like those found on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, specify measurements in grams. Converting 125g of granulated sugar to ounces (4.41 oz) helps when using American recipes or kitchen scales that only display ounces. This small but crucial step can elevate your air fryer baking game significantly.</p>

<h2>How to measure 125g of granulated sugar without scales</h2>
<p>If you don't have digital scales, you can still measure 125g of granulated sugar using volume measurements. Approximately 125g equals 10 UK tablespoons or â…” cup of granulated sugar.

<p>When preparing air fryer desserts like those in our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>cake recipes</a>, precise sugar measurements ensure consistent results. The compact cooking space of an air fryer means ingredient ratios are even more critical than in traditional oven baking.</p>

<h3>The science behind sugar in air fryer baking</h3>
<p>Granulated sugar does more than just sweeten your air fryer creations. At 125g (4.41 ounces), it contributes to browning, texture, and moisture retention. The rapid air circulation in air fryers causes sugar to caramelise faster, which is why getting the 125g measurement exactly right is so important.</p>

<h2>Converting other common sugar quantities</h2>
<p>While 125g of granulated sugar equals 4.41 ounces, you might need to convert other amounts too. For example, 100g is about 3.53 ounces, and 150g equals roughly 5.29 ounces. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> makes these calculations simple for all your baking needs.</p>
<p>Remember that different types of sugar have varying weights. The 125g to 4.41 ounce conversion applies specifically to granulated sugar. Icing sugar or brown sugar packed differently would yield different ounce measurements for the same gram weight.</p>

<h3>Tips for working with sugar in your air fryer</h3>
<p>When using 125g (4.41 ounces) of granulated sugar in air fryer recipes, consider reducing the temperature slightly to prevent over-browning. The concentrated heat can cause sugar to caramelise more quickly than in conventional ovens. Always preheat your air fryer for even cooking when working with sugar-based recipes.</p>

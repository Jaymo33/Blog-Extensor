<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on even cooking, and incorrect measurements can throw off the balance of your dish. Too much ginger paste might overpower the flavours, while too little could leave your meal tasting bland. That’s why converting 250g of ginger paste to ounces (8.82 oz) is so useful. It’s a common measurement in many recipes, especially those found on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>.

<p>Many UK cooks prefer using grams, but some recipes, particularly older or American ones, list ingredients in ounces. Converting 250g of ginger paste to ounces bridges this gap. It’s also handy when scaling recipes up or down. If you're meal prepping or cooking for a crowd, knowing that 250g equals 8.82 ounces helps maintain consistency across batches.</p>  

<h3>How to measure ginger paste accurately</h3>  
<p>For the best results, use a digital kitchen scale to weigh your ginger paste. If you don’t have one, a standard measuring spoon can work in a pinch—though it’s less precise. One tablespoon of ginger paste weighs roughly 15g, so 250g would be about 16.5 tablespoons. However, for air fryer recipes, we recommend sticking to weight measurements for accuracy.</p>

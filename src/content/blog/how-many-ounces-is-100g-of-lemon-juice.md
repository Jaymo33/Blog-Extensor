<p>100g of lemon juice equals approximately 3.53 ounces. Whether you're whipping up a zesty marinade or a tangy glaze for your air fryer dishes, knowing this conversion ensures your recipes turn out just right. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we understand how crucial precise measurements are for cooking success, especially when using an air fryer.</p>  

<h2>Why Convert 100g of Lemon Juice to Ounces?</h2>  
<p>Many UK recipes, especially those for air fryers, list ingredients in grams, while some kitchen scales or measuring tools use ounces. Converting 100g of lemon juice to ounces (3.53 oz) helps avoid confusion and ensures accuracy. This is particularly important for recipes like lemon-glazed chicken or citrus-infused desserts, where the balance of acidity can make or break the dish.</p>  
<p>If you're exploring our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a>, you'll notice that precise measurements are key. Lemon juice adds brightness to dishes, and even a small miscalculation can alter the flavour.

<h2>How to Measure 100g of Lemon Juice Accurately</h2>  
<p>To measure 100g of lemon juice, you can use a digital kitchen scale set to grams. If your scale only displays ounces, aim for 3.53 oz. Alternatively, 100g of lemon juice is roughly 6-7 tablespoons, but weighing is more precise. Freshly squeezed lemon juice is best for air fryer recipes, as bottled varieties often contain preservatives.</p>  

<h3>Using Lemon Juice in Air Fryer Recipes</h3>  
<p>Lemon juice is a versatile ingredient in air fryer cooking. It works wonders in marinades for <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken</a> or <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/fish>fish</a>, adding flavour and helping to tenderise the meat. A splash of lemon juice can also prevent oxidation in fruits or vegetables, keeping them fresh and vibrant.</p>  

<h2>Common Mistakes When Measuring Lemon Juice</h2>  
<p>One mistake is assuming all lemon juice weighs the same. Freshly squeezed lemon juice may have slight variations in density due to pulp content. Bottled lemon juice, while convenient, often has added water or sugar, which can affect the weight. Always opt for fresh lemons when precision matters.</p>  
<p>Another error is confusing fluid ounces with weight ounces. In the UK, recipes typically refer to weight ounces (oz) for solids like lemon juice. If you're unsure, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a> can help clarify.</p>  

<h3>Storing Lemon Juice for Future Use</h3>  
<p>If you have leftover lemon juice, store it in an airtight container in the fridge for up to a week. For longer storage, freeze it in ice cube traysâ€”each cube is roughly 15g (0.53 oz), making it easy to measure for future air fryer recipes.</p>

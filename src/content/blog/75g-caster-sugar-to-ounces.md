<p>75g of caster sugar equals approximately 2.65 ounces. This conversion is essential for precise baking, especially when using an air fryer where measurements can make or break a recipe. Whether you're whipping up cakes, cookies, or desserts, knowing how to convert grams to ounces ensures consistency. For more air fryer conversions, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate sugar measurements matter</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of caster sugar is crucial for texture and sweetness in your air fryer recipes. Too much sugar can lead to overly sweet or burnt results, while too little may leave your dish bland. Air fryers cook food faster than conventional ovens, so precision is key. If you're making a cake, for example, 75g of caster sugar (2.65 oz) ensures the perfect rise and crumb. Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> for inspiration.</p>  

<p>Measuring ingredients by weight (grams) is more reliable than volume (cups or spoons) because sugar density can vary. A digital kitchen scale is the best tool for this, ensuring your 75g of caster sugar is spot on. For cleaning tips after baking, visit our guide on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner</a>.</p>  

<h3>How to measure 75g of caster sugar without scales</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a scale, you can use measuring spoons or cups, but be aware this method is less precise. Roughly, 75g of caster sugar is about 6 tablespoons or just under ⅓ of a standard UK measuring cup. However, weighing is always best for accuracy, especially in air fryer baking where small deviations matter.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for 75g of caster sugar</h2>  
<p>This amount is perfect for small-batch desserts or air fryer cakes. For instance, a classic Victoria sponge or cookies often call for 75g of caster sugar. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>cake recipes</a> for ideas. The air fryer’s rapid circulation ensures even baking, so precise sugar measurements help avoid uneven results.</p>  

<p>You might also use 75g of caster sugar for glazes or syrups in air fryer desserts. Since sugar caramelises quickly in the air fryer, sticking to 2.65 ounces (75g) prevents burning. For savoury dishes that need a touch of sweetness, like glazed carrots, this measurement works wonders too.</p>  

<h3>Converting other sugar quantities</h3>  
<p>If your recipe requires a different amount, remember that 1 ounce is roughly 28.35 grams. So, 100g of caster sugar would be about 3.53 ounces. Keeping a conversion chart handy saves time and ensures your air fryer dishes turn out perfectly every time.</p>

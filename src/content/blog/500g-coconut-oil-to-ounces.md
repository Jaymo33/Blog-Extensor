<h2>How to measure 500g of coconut oil in ounces</h2>  
<p>Measuring coconut oil can be tricky since it changes texture with temperature. Solid coconut oil is easier to weigh, while melted oil requires a liquid measuring cup. To convert 500g of coconut oil to ounces, use a kitchen scale set to grams or ounces. If your scale only shows grams, multiply by 0.0353 to get the ounce equivalent (500g x 0.0353 = 17.64 oz).</p>  
<p>For those without a scale, a standard UK tablespoon holds about 0.5 oz (15g) of coconut oil. This means 500g would be roughly 35 tablespoons. However, weighing is far more accurate, especially for air fryer recipes where consistency matters.

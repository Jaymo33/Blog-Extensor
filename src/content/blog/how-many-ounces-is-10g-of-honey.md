<p>10 grams of honey equals approximately 0.35 ounces. This conversion is handy when following air fryer recipes that require precise measurements, especially for sticky ingredients like honey. Whether you're whipping up a glaze or sweetening a marinade, knowing how to convert 10g honey to ounces ensures your dish turns out perfectly.</p>  

<h2>Why Convert 10g of Honey to Ounces?</h2>  
<p>Many UK recipes, especially those for air fryers, use metric measurements like grams. However, some kitchen scales or older cookbooks might list weights in ounces. Converting 10g of honey to ounces (0.35 oz) helps avoid guesswork and guarantees accuracy. This is particularly important for air fryer cooking, where precise ingredient ratios affect texture and browning.</p>  

<p>Honey’s viscosity means even small measurement errors can alter a recipe’s outcome. For example, a sticky glaze for <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer chicken wings</a> requires the right balance of sweetness. Too much honey can make the dish overly sticky, while too little might leave it bland. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> simplifies these calculations for all your cooking needs.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure 10g of Honey Accurately</h3>  
<p>Using a digital kitchen scale is the easiest way to measure 10g of honey. If your scale displays ounces, it should read around 0.35 oz for 10g. No scale? A teaspoon holds roughly 7g of honey, so 1.5 teaspoons will get you close to 10g. Remember, honey’s thickness means it’s best to lightly coat the spoon with oil first for cleaner measuring.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for 10g of Honey in Air Fryer Recipes</h2>  
<p>A 10g honey portion is ideal for glazes, marinades, or drizzles in air fryer cooking. For instance, a honey-mustard glaze for <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>air fryer chicken thighs</a> might call for 10g of honey mixed with mustard and herbs. Similarly, a 10g honey drizzle over roasted vegetables caramelises beautifully in the air fryer’s high heat.</p>  

<p>Honey also works wonders in <a href=https://www.airryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>air fryer desserts</a>, like fruit crisps or baked apples. Since air fryers circulate hot air efficiently, a small amount of honey (like 10g) can evenly coat ingredients without pooling.

<h3>Converting Other Honey Amounts</h3>  
<p>If your recipe requires more or less honey, here’s a quick reference: 20g ≈ 0.7 oz, 50g ≈ 1.76 oz, and 100g ≈ 3.53 oz. These conversions are useful when scaling recipes up or down for your air fryer’s capacity. Always measure honey by weight (not volume) for consistency, as its density varies with temperature.</p>  

<h2>Tips for Working with Honey in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Honey can burn quickly in an air fryer due to its high sugar content. To prevent this, mix 10g of honey with a bit of oil or water before applying it to food. Alternatively, brush honey-based glazes onto food during the last few minutes of cooking. This ensures caramelisation without charring.</p>  

<p>For even distribution, warm 10g of honey slightly before mixing it into marinades or batters. This is especially helpful for coatings on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/shrimp>air fryer shrimp</a> or tofu. Remember, honey’s sweetness intensifies when heated, so adjust other seasonings accordingly.</p>

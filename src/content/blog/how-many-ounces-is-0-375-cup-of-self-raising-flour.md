<p>0.375 cup of self-raising flour equals approximately 1.5 ounces (oz). This conversion is essential for air fryer baking, where precise measurements can make or break your recipe. Whether you're whipping up cakes, muffins, or bread in your air fryer, knowing the exact weight ensures consistency. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we focus on helping you achieve perfect results with accurate conversions.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate flour measurements matter in air fryer baking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers cook food faster and more evenly than conventional ovens, so ingredient precision is crucial. Too much or too little flour can affect texture, rise, and browning. For example, 0.375 cup of self-raising flour to ounces (1.5 oz) ensures your batter isn’t too dense or runny. Many of our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> rely on this balance for light, fluffy results.</p>  

<p>Self-raising flour contains baking powder, so incorrect measurements can also impact leavening. If you’re converting 0.375 cup of self-raising flour in ounces, a kitchen scale is your best friend. For more tips, check our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> to simplify your baking process.</p>  

<h3>How to measure 0.375 cup of self-raising flour correctly</h3>  
<p>Use the spoon-and-level method for dry ingredients like flour. Gently spoon the flour into your measuring cup until it’s slightly heaped, then level it off with a knife. This avoids compacting the flour, which could lead to using more than 1.5 oz. For air fryer recipes, consistency is key—especially with delicate bakes like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>cakes</a>.</p>  

<h2>Common conversions for air fryer baking</h2>  
<p>Beyond 0.375 cup self-raising flour to oz, here are other handy conversions: 1 cup equals 4 oz, and 0.5 cup equals 2 oz. These measurements help scale recipes up or down for your air fryer’s capacity. If you’re adapting a traditional recipe, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a> takes the guesswork out of adjustments.</p>  

<p>For example, if a recipe calls for 1.5 cups (6 oz) of self-raising flour and you only need half, you’d use 0.75 cup (3 oz). Knowing how many ounces are in 0.375 cup of self-raising flour (1.5 oz) lets you halve or double recipes with confidence. This precision is especially useful for smaller air fryer batches.</p>  

<h3>Tips for storing self-raising flour</h3>  
<p>Keep your flour in an airtight container to maintain its leavening power. Humidity can affect weight and performance, so always measure 0.375 cup of self-raising flour in ounces (1.5 oz) just before use. For longer storage, freeze it—just bring it to room temperature before baking in your air fryer.</p>  

<h2>Troubleshooting air fryer baking with self-raising flour</h2>  
<p>If your bakes turn out dense or uneven, double-check your 0.375 cup self-raising flour to ounces conversion. Overmixing can also deflate the batter, so fold gently. For sticky doughs, like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cookies>cookies</a>, chilling the dough before air frying helps retain shape.</p>  

<p>Self-raising flour loses potency over time, so test it by mixing a spoonful with water—if it doesn’t bubble, replace it. Always use fresh flour for reliable results when converting 0.375 cup to ounces. And don’t forget to preheat your air fryer for even baking!</p>

<p>885 ml of soy sauce is approximately 3.74 cups. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes, ensuring accurate measurements for marinades, sauces, and glazes. Whether you're following a recipe from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> or creating your own, knowing how to convert millilitres to cups guarantees consistent flavours.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Soy Sauce Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of soy sauce can make or break a dish. Too little, and your meal might lack depth; too much, and it could become overly salty. For air fryer recipes, precision is key, especially when marinating proteins like chicken or tofu. A conversion chart, like the one on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>our site</a>, helps streamline the process.</p>  
<p>Many air fryer enthusiasts rely on soy sauce for its umami-rich flavour. Whether you're preparing a quick stir-fry or a slow-marinated dish, 885 ml of soy sauce translates to roughly 3.74 cups. This measurement is particularly useful for batch cooking or meal prep, ensuring every portion is perfectly seasoned.</p>  

<h2>Converting 885 ml of Soy Sauce to Cups</h2>  
<p>The conversion from millilitres to cups isn't always straightforward, as cup sizes vary between the UK and USA. However, for most practical purposes, 885 ml of soy sauce equals 3.74 cups. This measurement is based on the standard metric cup (250 ml), which is commonly used in cooking.</p>  
<p>If you're using an American recipe, note that a US cup is slightly smaller (240 ml). In this case, 885 ml of soy sauce would be closer to 3.69 cups. For air fryer recipes, the difference is minimal, but it's worth double-checking if precision is critical. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a> includes both metric and imperial measurements for convenience.</p>  

<h3>Tools for Measuring Soy Sauce</h3>  
<p>A liquid measuring cup or a kitchen scale is ideal for measuring 885 ml of soy sauce. If you don't have these tools, a standard mug holds about 250 ml, so you can estimate accordingly. For air fryer cooking, consistency is key, so investing in reliable measuring tools is a smart move.</p>  

<h2>Using 885 ml of Soy Sauce in Air Fryer Recipes</h2>  
<p>Soy sauce is a staple in many air fryer dishes, from glazed salmon to teriyaki chicken. With 885 ml (or 3.74 cups), you can marinate multiple servings or prepare a large batch of sauce. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipes</a> for inspiration on how to use this quantity effectively.</p>  
<p>When working with soy sauce in the air fryer, remember that it can caramelise quickly due to the high heat. To avoid burning, lightly coat ingredients or mix the soy sauce with other liquids like honey or vinegar. This balance ensures a rich flavour without overpowering the dish.</p>  

<h3>Storing Leftover Soy Sauce</h3>  
<p>If you don't use all 885 ml of soy sauce at once, store it in an airtight container in the fridge. Proper storage maintains its flavour and prevents contamination.

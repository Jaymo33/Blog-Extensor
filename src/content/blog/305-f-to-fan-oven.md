<p>305°F converts to approximately 150°C in a fan oven. This is a crucial conversion for air fryer users adapting American recipes, as most UK fan ovens use Celsius. Getting this temperature right ensures your food cooks evenly without burning or drying out.</p>

<h2>Understanding 305 F in Fan Oven Terms</h2>
<p>When converting 305 F to fan oven settings, you're dealing with a moderate baking temperature. This is ideal for delicate items like custards or slow-roasting vegetables in your air fryer. The fan circulation in both appliances means heat distribution is more even than conventional ovens.</p>
<p>For reference, 305 F sits between the standard 300 F (149°C) and 325 F (163°C) marks. It's a slightly gentler heat perfect for recipes requiring gradual cooking. Many <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> from the US use this specific temperature for achieving crisp exteriors without overcooking interiors.</p>

<h3>Why 305 F Matters for Air Fryers</h3>
<p>Air fryers operate similarly to fan ovens but with more intense air circulation. When a recipe calls for 305 F, it's often to balance browning with thorough cooking. This temperature works particularly well for <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken dishes</a> where you want golden skin without drying the meat.</p>

<h2>Conversion Charts and Practical Tips</h2>
<p>Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> shows 305 F equals 150°C in fan ovens with a 20°C reduction from conventional settings. Remember that air fryers cook faster, so you may need to reduce cooking times by 15-20% compared to fan oven instructions.</p>
<p>For foods that normally cook at 305 F, like baked goods or casseroles, check them 5 minutes early. The rapid air technology in air fryers can accelerate browning. If you're adapting a conventional oven recipe, lowering the temperature by about 25°F (14°C) often gives better results.</p>

<h3>Common Foods Cooked at 305 F</h3>
<p>This temperature works beautifully for <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/potatoes>roast potatoes</a>, giving them time to crisp without burning. It's also ideal for reheating leftovers like pizza or fried chicken in your air fryer, keeping them crispy without drying out.</p>

<h2>Adjusting for Different Air Fryer Models</h2>
<p>Not all air fryers heat identically. If yours runs hot, you might need to set it to 140°C instead of 150°C when converting 305 F. Always do a test run with a small batch when trying new temperatures. Keep notes for your specific model - this helps build your personal <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>air fryer recipe</a> database.</p>
<p>Modern air fryers with digital controls make entering 150°C simple. For analog dial models, aim between the 140°C and 160°C marks. The small difference won't dramatically affect most recipes calling for 305 F.</p>

<h3>Troubleshooting 305 F Conversions</h3>
<p>If food browns too quickly at 150°C, try reducing to 140°C and extending cooking time slightly. Conversely, if items aren't crisping, increase to 160°C for the last few minutes. Regular <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaning</a> ensures consistent temperature performance.</p>

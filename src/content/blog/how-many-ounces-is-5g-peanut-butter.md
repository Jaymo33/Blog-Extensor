<h2>Why Convert 5g of Peanut Butter to Ounces?</h2>  
<p>Converting 5g of peanut butter to ounces is crucial for following recipes accurately, especially in baking. Many UK recipes use grams, while others may reference ounces, so knowing both measurements is handy. Peanut butter’s density means volume measurements like tablespoons can vary, but weight remains consistent. This precision is vital for air fryer recipes, where even small deviations can affect texture and cooking time.

<p>Using a kitchen scale is the best way to measure 5g of peanut butter, but if you don’t have one, visual approximations can help. A teaspoon of peanut butter is roughly 5g, but this can vary depending on how heaped it is. For air fryer recipes, consistency is key, so weighing ingredients ensures reliable results every time.

<h3>How to Measure 5g of Peanut Butter Without a Scale</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a scale, you can use a measuring spoon to estimate 5g of peanut butter. A level teaspoon is approximately 5g, but this can vary slightly depending on the brand and how dense the peanut butter is. For sticky ingredients like peanut butter, lightly greasing the spoon can help it slide off easily. This method is handy for quick air fryer recipes where precision isn’t critical but still helpful.</p>

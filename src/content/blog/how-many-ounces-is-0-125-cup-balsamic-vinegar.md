<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on even cooking, and incorrect measurements can lead to uneven results. Too much balsamic vinegar might make your dish overly tangy, while too little could leave it bland.

If you’re new to air frying, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a> for inspiration.</p>  

<p>Using a kitchen scale is the most accurate way to measure liquids like balsamic vinegar. However, if you don’t have one, knowing that 0.125 cup equals 1 oz is a handy shortcut. This measurement is particularly useful for small quantities, such as dressings or glazes. For more tips, visit <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure 0.125 Cup Without a Scale</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a measuring cup with 0.125 cup markings, use 2 tablespoons instead. This equals 1 fluid ounce, the same as 0.125 cup of balsamic vinegar. For sticky liquids like balsamic vinegar, lightly grease the spoon for easier pouring. Need cleaning tips?

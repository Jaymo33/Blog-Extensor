<p>1.5 cups of frozen peas weigh approximately 12 ounces (340 grams). This conversion is essential for air fryer cooking, where precise measurements can affect texture and cooking times. Whether you’re whipping up a quick side dish or adding peas to a larger recipe, knowing the weight ensures consistent results. For more handy conversions, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter for Frozen Peas</h2>  
<p>Using the correct weight of frozen peas ensures even cooking in your air fryer. Too many peas can lead to steaming instead of crisping, while too few might burn. Frozen peas are a staple in many air fryer recipes, from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable medleys</a> to protein-packed meals. Measuring by weight (ounces) is often more reliable than volume (cups), as peas can settle or vary in density.</p>  

<p>If you’re scaling a recipe up or down, converting 1.5 cups of frozen peas to ounces (12 oz) makes adjustments simple. For example, doubling a recipe would mean using 24 ounces instead of 3 cups. This precision is especially useful for meal preppers or those cooking for larger families. Need inspiration? Browse our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> for creative ways to use frozen peas.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure Frozen Peas Correctly</h3>  
<p>For the most accurate measurement, use a kitchen scale to weigh your frozen peas directly in ounces. If you don’t have one, lightly spoon the peas into a measuring cup without packing them down. Avoid thawing the peas first, as this can alter the weight and texture. Keeping them frozen ensures they cook evenly and retain their vibrant colour in the air fryer.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for 1.5 Cups of Frozen Peas in Air Fryers</h2>  
<p>Frozen peas are incredibly versatile in air fryer cooking. A 1.5-cup (12 oz) portion works perfectly for sides like garlic-pea mash or crispy pea fritters. They also pair well with proteins like salmon or chicken in one-tray meals. Since peas cook quickly, they’re ideal for last-minute additions to stir-fries or grain bowls prepared in the air fryer.</p>  

<p>For a simple snack, toss 1.5 cups of frozen peas with a bit of olive oil and salt, then air fry at 180°C for 8–10 minutes. The result? Lightly crispy peas with a tender interior. If you’re experimenting with new dishes, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/frozen-foods>frozen foods section</a> has plenty of ideas to get you started.</p>  

<h3>Tips for Cooking Frozen Peas in an Air Fryer</h3>  
<p>To prevent sogginess, spread the peas in a single layer in the air fryer basket. Shake them halfway through cooking for even browning. Since 1.5 cups of frozen peas equals 12 ounces, you’ll need to adjust cooking times if scaling the quantity. Always preheat your air fryer for the crispiest results, and consider pairing peas with other veggies for a balanced dish.</p>  

<h2>Converting Other Frozen Vegetable Measurements</h2>  
<p>While 1.5 cups of frozen peas equal 12 ounces, other veggies may differ. For example, 1.5 cups of frozen broccoli florets weigh closer to 10 ounces due to their shape and density. Always check weight conversions when substituting ingredients in air fryer recipes. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a> covers common frozen veggies to simplify your cooking.</p>  

<p>Keeping your air fryer clean is just as important as accurate measurements. After cooking peas or other veggies, use our guide on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaning</a> to maintain peak performance. A well-maintained air fryer ensures consistent results every time you cook.</p>

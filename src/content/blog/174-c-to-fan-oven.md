<p>174°C in a conventional oven converts to approximately 154°C in a fan oven. This 20°C reduction is standard when switching between conventional and fan-assisted cooking. For air fryer users, this means adjusting your appliance to 154°C for recipes originally designed for conventional ovens.</p>

<h2>Understanding Fan Oven Conversions</h2>
<p>Fan ovens circulate hot air using a built-in fan, cooking food faster and more evenly than conventional ovens. When converting 174°C to fan oven temperature, you'll typically reduce the heat by 20°C. This means 174°C becomes 154°C in a fan-assisted oven. Many modern recipes at <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> now include both conventional and fan oven temperatures.</p>
<p>The same principle applies when using an air fryer, which essentially functions as a compact fan oven. If a recipe calls for 174°C in a conventional oven, set your air fryer to 154°C. This ensures your food cooks through properly without burning. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> makes these adjustments simple for all your favourite dishes.</p>

<h3>Why Temperature Conversion Matters</h3>
<p>Getting the temperature right is crucial for perfect results. At 174°C conventional (154°C fan), you're in the ideal range for baking cakes, roasting vegetables, or cooking poultry. The circulating air in fan ovens and air fryers means heat transfers more efficiently to your food. This is why we reduce the temperature - to prevent overcooking while maintaining that perfect golden finish.</p>

<h2>Air Fryer Equivalent for 174°C</h2>
<p>When using an air fryer instead of a conventional oven, the 174°C to 154°C conversion remains the same as for fan ovens. Air fryers work similarly to fan ovens, just on a smaller scale. This makes them excellent for quick, energy-efficient cooking. For example, when making roasted potatoes from our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/potatoes>potato recipes collection</a>, this temperature conversion ensures crispy outsides and fluffy insides.</p>
<p>Remember that cooking times may vary slightly between fan ovens and air fryers. While the temperature conversion from 174°C conventional to 154°C remains constant, air fryers often cook food faster due to their compact size. Always check your food a few minutes earlier than the recipe suggests when using an air fryer.</p>

<h3>Common Uses for 174°C Fan Setting</h3>
<p>The 174°C conventional (154°C fan) temperature is versatile for many dishes. It's perfect for baking Victoria sponge cakes, roasting chicken pieces, or cooking vegetable bakes. When converted correctly for your fan oven or air fryer, this temperature gives gentle yet thorough cooking. For more recipe ideas at this temperature, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>cake recipes</a> section.</p>

<h2>Tips for Perfect Temperature Control</h2>
<p>To ensure accuracy when converting 174°C to fan oven or air fryer settings, always preheat your appliance. Oven thermometers can verify your fan oven's actual temperature matches its display. For air fryers, some models may run slightly hotter, so consider reducing the temperature by another 5-10°C if food browns too quickly.</p>
<p>Keep your appliances clean for the most accurate temperature readings. A buildup of grease and food particles can affect heat distribution. Our guide to <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaning</a> makes maintenance simple. Regular cleaning ensures your 174°C to fan oven conversions remain precise for perfect cooking results every time.</p>

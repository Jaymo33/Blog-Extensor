<p>160 ml of soy sauce is approximately 0.68 cups. Whether you’re marinating chicken, glazing salmon, or seasoning vegetables for your air fryer, knowing this conversion ensures your recipes turn out perfectly every time. Precise measurements matter, especially when working with bold flavours like soy sauce. Let’s dive deeper into how this conversion works and how to use it in your cooking.</p>

<h2>Understanding the Conversion: 160 ml to Cups</h2>  
<p>Converting millilitres to cups can be tricky, but it’s essential for accurate cooking. One standard metric cup holds 250 ml, so 160 ml of soy sauce is roughly 0.68 cups. This measurement is useful for both UK and US recipes, though slight variations exist in cup sizes. For air fryer cooking, precision ensures even seasoning and marination. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more handy measurements.</p>  

<p>If you don’t have a measuring cup, you can use a kitchen scale for better accuracy. Soy sauce weighs about 1.04 grams per ml, so 160 ml would be around 166 grams. This method is especially helpful for baking or meal prep where exact ratios matter. Whether you’re making crispy tofu or glazed shrimp, getting the measurement right makes all the difference.</p>  

<h3>Why Measuring Soy Sauce Correctly Matters</h3>  
<p>Soy sauce is a powerful ingredient—too much can overpower a dish, while too little may leave it bland. In air fryer recipes, where flavours concentrate due to rapid cooking, balance is key. For example, marinating chicken with 160 ml (0.68 cups) of soy sauce ensures deep flavour without excessive saltiness. Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> for inspiration on using soy sauce perfectly.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for 160 ml of Soy Sauce in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>This quantity of soy sauce is ideal for marinating proteins like chicken, beef, or tofu. A 160 ml (0.68 cups) batch can coat about 500 grams of meat or vegetables, infusing them with umami richness. Try it in our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>air fryer chicken recipes</a> for a crispy, flavourful result. The soy sauce caramelises beautifully in the air fryer, creating a glossy finish.</p>  

<p>You can also use 160 ml of soy sauce for stir-fry sauces or dipping accompaniments. Mix it with garlic, honey, or ginger for a versatile glaze. Since air fryers cook quickly, pre-marinating with the right amount of soy sauce ensures maximum flavour penetration. Don’t forget to check our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner guide</a> to keep your appliance spotless after cooking with sticky sauces.</p>  

<h3>Adjusting Recipes for Different Soy Sauce Types</h3>  
<p>Light soy sauce is saltier, while dark soy sauce is thicker and sweeter. If substituting, adjust the quantity slightly—160 ml of dark soy sauce may need diluting with water or broth. For low-sodium versions, you might use a bit more without overwhelming the dish. Always taste as you go, especially when adapting recipes for your air fryer.</p>  

<h2>Tips for Measuring Soy Sauce Without a Cup</h2>  
<p>No measuring cup? A standard UK tablespoon holds 15 ml, so 160 ml is about 10.5 tablespoons. For smaller quantities, a teaspoon (5 ml) can help you measure precisely. Alternatively, repurpose a clean medicine syringe for liquid measurements. These hacks are perfect when prepping marinades for <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>air fryer vegetables</a> or proteins.</p>  

<p>Another trick is using a liquid measuring jug with millilitre markings. Pour the soy sauce to the 160 ml line, then transfer it to your mixing bowl. This method minimises spills and ensures accuracy. Remember, air fryer cooking benefits from well-measured ingredients, so take your time with conversions.</p>

<p>0.5 cups of chicken broth equals approximately 118 ml, making it easy to measure for air fryer recipes. Whether you’re preparing a savoury dish or a hearty soup, precise measurements ensure perfect results every time. Converting cups to millilitres is especially useful when following international recipes or adjusting portion sizes. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we focus on simplifying conversions so you can cook with confidence.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Using the correct amount of liquid, like chicken broth, ensures your air fryer meals turn out just right. Too much broth can make food soggy, while too little may dry it out. For dishes like air-fried casseroles or marinated chicken, 0.5 cups (118 ml) of broth adds moisture without overpowering flavours.

Precision is key, especially when adapting recipes for smaller or larger servings.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure 0.5 Cups of Chicken Broth Correctly</h3>  
<p>For the most accurate measurement, use a liquid measuring cup rather than dry cups. Fill it to the 0.5-cup mark, or weigh 118 ml if using a metric scale. If you don’t have measuring tools, a standard UK tablespoon holds about 15 ml, so roughly 8 tablespoons equal 0.5 cups. Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipes</a> for dishes that use chicken broth, like air-fried risotto or gravy.</p>  

<h2>Converting Other Common Chicken Broth Measurements</h2>  
<p>Beyond 0.5 cups, you might need to convert different amounts of chicken broth for air fryer recipes. For example, 1 cup equals 237 ml, while 0.25 cups is roughly 59 ml. These conversions are handy when scaling recipes up or down. If you’re working with larger batches, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipe category</a> offers plenty of inspiration.</p>  

<h3>Does Chicken Broth Density Affect the Conversion?</h3>  
<p>Chicken broth has a similar density to water, so 0.5 cups reliably converts to 118 ml. However, thicker broths or stocks may vary slightly. For best results, stick to standard liquid measurements unless a recipe specifies otherwise. Need to clean your air fryer after cooking?

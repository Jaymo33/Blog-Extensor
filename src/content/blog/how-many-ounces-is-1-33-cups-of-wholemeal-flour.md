<p>1.33 cups of wholemeal flour equals approximately 5.64 ounces (or 160 grams). This conversion is essential for air fryer baking, where precise measurements can make or break your recipe. Whether you’re whipping up a batch of air fryer cookies or a hearty loaf, knowing the exact weight ensures consistent results every time.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Flour Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Baking is a science, and even small deviations in flour quantity can affect texture and rise. Wholemeal flour, in particular, has a denser structure than plain flour, so measuring by weight (ounces or grams) is far more reliable than volume (cups). If you’re using an air fryer for baking, precision is key—especially with recipes from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, where balanced ingredients guarantee success.</p>  

<p>Many UK bakers prefer weighing ingredients for accuracy, as cup measurements can vary based on how the flour is scooped or packed. A kitchen scale eliminates guesswork, ensuring your air fryer cakes, breads, and pastries turn out perfectly every time. For more conversion tips, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure Wholemeal Flour Correctly</h3>  
<p>To avoid overpacking your cups, lightly spoon the flour into the measuring cup and level it off with a knife. This method prevents compacting, which can lead to using up to 20% more flour than intended. For air fryer recipes, especially those involving delicate batters or doughs, weighing your flour ensures consistency.</p>  

<h2>Converting Cups to Ounces for Air Fryer Recipes</h2>  
<p>Wholemeal flour weighs roughly 4.25 ounces per cup, so 1.33 cups equate to about 5.64 ounces. This conversion is handy for adapting traditional oven recipes to your air fryer, where space and cooking dynamics differ. If you’re experimenting with <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>air fryer cakes</a>, precise flour measurements help maintain moisture and structure.</p>  

<p>For those without a scale, remember that 1 cup of wholemeal flour is approximately 120 grams, making 1.33 cups close to 160 grams. This metric is useful for UK bakers following recipes from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, where gram measurements are often provided alongside cups.</p>  

<h3>Common Mistakes When Measuring Flour</h3>  
<p>Scooping flour directly from the bag with a measuring cup compacts it, leading to excess flour and dry, dense bakes. Another pitfall is tapping the cup to “settle” the flour—this also increases the weight. For air fryer baking, where heat circulates intensely, dry doughs can overcook quickly, so accuracy is crucial.</p>  

<h2>Using Wholemeal Flour in Air Fryer Baking</h2>  
<p>Wholemeal flour adds nuttiness and fibre to air fryer recipes, but its absorbency requires slight adjustments. If substituting for plain flour, reduce the amount by 10–15% or add a touch more liquid. This tweak prevents dry outcomes, especially in recipes like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cookies>air fryer cookies</a> or muffins.</p>  

<p>For savoury dishes, such as air fryer breaded chicken or veggie coatings, wholemeal flour provides a hearty crunch. Just ensure you’ve measured correctly—5.64 ounces (1.33 cups) is the golden ratio for balanced texture. Need cleaning tips after flour-heavy recipes?

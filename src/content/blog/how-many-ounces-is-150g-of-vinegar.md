<h2>Why convert 150g vinegar to ounces?</h2>  
<p>Many UK recipes use grams, while others rely on ounces, especially when referencing older cookbooks or international guides. Converting 150g of vinegar to ounces (5.29 oz) ensures you’re using the correct amount for balanced flavours. Air fryer recipes, like those found on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>our recipes page</a>, often need precise liquid measurements to avoid soggy or overly dry results. Whether you’re making crispy chicken wings or glazed vegetables, accuracy matters.</p>  

<p>Vinegar’s density means 150g takes up roughly 150ml in volume, but weight conversions are more reliable for consistency.

<h3>How to measure 150g of vinegar without scales</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have digital scales, you can still measure 150g of vinegar using a measuring jug. Since vinegar’s density is close to water, 150g equals roughly 150ml.

<h2>Common uses for 150g of vinegar in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Vinegar is a versatile ingredient in air fryer recipes, from tenderising meats to adding a punchy finish. A 150g (5.29 oz) quantity is perfect for marinades, like those used in our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipes</a>.

<h3>Does vinegar type affect the 150g to ounces conversion?</h3>  
<p>While all vinegars have similar densities, slight variations exist. Apple cider, white wine, or balsamic vinegar will all convert 150g to roughly 5.29 ounces. However, thicker varieties, like aged balsamic, may weigh slightly more per volume. For most air fryer recipes, the difference is negligible, but it’s worth noting for ultra-precise baking.</p>

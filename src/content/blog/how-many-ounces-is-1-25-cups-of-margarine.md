<p>1.25 cups of margarine equals 10 ounces, making it easy to measure for your air fryer recipes. Whether you're whipping up a cake or preparing a savoury dish, accurate conversions ensure perfect results every time. Margarine, a common butter substitute, is often measured in cups, but many recipes—especially those on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>—require ounces for precision. Understanding this conversion helps streamline your cooking process.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on precise ingredient ratios to achieve crispy, evenly cooked results. Too much or too little margarine can affect texture and flavour. For example, a <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>cake recipe</a> using 1.25 cups of margarine (10 oz) ensures the right moisture balance. Unlike traditional ovens, air fryers circulate hot air rapidly, so exact measurements prevent undercooking or dryness.</p>  

<p>Margarine’s density can vary slightly by brand, but standard conversions remain reliable. If you’re adapting a recipe from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>our conversion chart</a>, sticking to 10 ounces for 1.25 cups guarantees consistency. This is especially useful for <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cookies>cookies</a>, where fat content directly impacts spread and crispiness.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure Margarine Without Scales</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a kitchen scale, use the markings on margarine packaging. Most UK blocks are divided into 50g or 1.75oz portions, so 10 ounces equals roughly 285g. Alternatively, 1.25 cups is equivalent to 20 tablespoons—handy for smaller batches. For sticky margarine, lightly grease your measuring cup for easy release.</p>  

<h2>Converting Margarine for UK vs. US Recipes</h2>  
<p>UK and US cup measurements differ slightly, but margarine conversions stay consistent. Whether you’re following a British or American recipe, 1.25 cups of margarine always translates to 10 ounces. This simplifies adapting <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>global recipes</a> for your air fryer without guesswork.</p>  

<p>For frozen or softened margarine, weight is more reliable than volume. If a recipe calls for melted margarine, measure it solid first (1.25 cups = 10 oz), then melt. This avoids inaccuracies from air pockets. Need to clean sticky residue? Check <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>our cleaning guide</a> for tips.</p>  

<h3>Common Margarine Substitutes in Air Fryer Recipes</h3>  
<p>Butter, coconut oil, or vegetable shortening can replace margarine at a 1:1 ratio by weight (10 oz). Adjust cooking times slightly, as substitutes may have different moisture levels. For vegan options, ensure your margarine is plant-based—many UK brands label this clearly.</p>

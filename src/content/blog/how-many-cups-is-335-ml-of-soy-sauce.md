<p>335 ml of soy sauce equals approximately 1.42 cups. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes, ensuring your dishes have the perfect balance of flavour. Whether you’re marinating chicken or whipping up a stir-fry, accurate measurements make all the difference. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we know how crucial precise conversions are for cooking success.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>
<p>Using the right amount of soy sauce can elevate your air fryer dishes from good to great. Too little, and your meal might lack depth; too much, and it could become overly salty. The air fryer’s intense heat means flavours concentrate quickly, so precision is key. For example, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>teriyaki chicken recipe</a> relies on the perfect soy sauce ratio for that sticky-sweet glaze. Measuring 335 ml of soy sauce correctly ensures consistent results every time.</p>

<p>Many air fryer recipes, like those in our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken category</a>, call for soy sauce as a base ingredient. Whether you’re cooking for one or meal prepping, knowing how 335 ml translates to cups saves time and hassle. It’s also handy when scaling recipes up or down, so you never waste a drop of this versatile condiment.</p>

<h2>Converting 335 ml of Soy Sauce to Cups</h2>
<p>The standard conversion for 335 ml to cups is roughly 1.42 cups. This measurement applies to both UK and US cup sizes, as the difference between them is negligible for soy sauce. If you’re using a measuring jug, fill it just past the 1 1/3 cup mark for the most accurate result. For those who prefer weight, 335 ml of soy sauce weighs about 347 grams.</p>

<h3>Tools for Measuring Soy Sauce</h3>
<p>A liquid measuring cup is ideal for measuring 335 ml of soy sauce, as it allows you to check the meniscus at eye level. If you don’t have one, a standard 250 ml mug plus another 85 ml (about 1/3 cup) will get you close enough for most recipes. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a> has more handy tips for adapting measurements to your air fryer cooking.</p>

<h2>Using 335 ml of Soy Sauce in Air Fryer Recipes</h2>
<p>335 ml of soy sauce is enough for multiple batches of marinades or sauces. For instance, our popular <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/beef>beef stir-fry</a> uses about 60 ml per serving, meaning 335 ml could season five generous portions. The air fryer’s rapid circulation ensures the soy sauce coats ingredients evenly, creating deliciously caramelised edges.</p>

<p>When working with thicker sauces like hoisin or oyster sauce, you might need to adjust quantities slightly. The saltiness of soy sauce means it’s often diluted with other liquids in recipes. Always taste as you go, especially when converting between millilitres and cups, to avoid over-seasoning your dish.</p>

<h3>Storing Leftover Soy Sauce</h3>
<p>If your recipe doesn’t use all 335 ml of soy sauce, transfer the remainder to an airtight container. Store it in a cool, dark place – the fridge isn’t necessary but can help maintain freshness longer. Proper storage ensures your soy sauce stays flavourful for future air fryer creations, from crispy tofu to glazed salmon.</p>

<h2>Common Mistakes When Measuring Soy Sauce</h2>
<p>One frequent error is confusing fluid ounces with millilitres, which can throw off your 335 ml measurement. Another is pouring soy sauce directly from the bottle without checking the level, leading to inconsistent amounts. For best results, use a clear measuring cup on a flat surface and pour slowly to the 335 ml mark.</p>

<p>Temperature can also affect volume measurements slightly, though with soy sauce the difference is minimal. If you’ve recently cleaned your air fryer with our recommended <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning solution</a>, ensure your measuring tools are completely dry before use to prevent any liquid sticking to the sides.</p>

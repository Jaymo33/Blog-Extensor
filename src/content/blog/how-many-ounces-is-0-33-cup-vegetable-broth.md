<h3>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h3>  
<p>Air fryers cook food quickly and evenly, but only if ingredient ratios are correct. Too much or too little liquid, like vegetable broth, can affect texture and cooking time. For example, 0.33 cup of vegetable broth to ounces (2.64 fl oz) ensures your marinades or sauces aren't too watery. This precision is especially important for <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/frozen-foods>frozen food recipes</a>, where excess moisture can lead to sogginess.</p>  

<h2>How to measure 0.33 cup of vegetable broth</h2>  
<p>If you don't have a measuring cup marked for 0.33 cup, use a 1/3 cup and fill it slightly less. Alternatively, use a kitchen scale to weigh 2.64 fl oz of vegetable broth. For UK cooks, note that 1 UK fluid ounce is roughly equivalent to 1.04 US fluid ounces, but the difference is negligible for most recipes. Need more air fryer tips?

<p>Another handy trick is to use tablespoons: 0.33 cup equals about 5.28 tablespoons. This method works well for small batches or when adjusting recipes on the fly. Remember, 0.33 cup of vegetable broth in ounces is a versatile measurement for everything from risottos to braised dishes.

<h3>Common uses for 0.33 cup of vegetable broth</h3>  
<p>This measurement is perfect for deglazing pans, creating light sauces, or adding moisture to air-fried vegetables. It's also ideal for marinating proteins like tofu or chicken before air frying. Whether you're converting 0.33 cup of vegetable broth to oz for a soup or a glaze, precision ensures balanced flavours.</p>

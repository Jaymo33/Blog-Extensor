<p>0.33 cup of baking soda equals approximately 2.64 ounces. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes, where precise measurements ensure perfect results. Whether you're baking, cleaning, or prepping ingredients, knowing the exact weight saves time and avoids mistakes. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we focus on making conversions simple for home cooks. Let’s dive deeper into why this measurement matters and how to use it effectively.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on even heat distribution, so ingredient ratios must be spot-on. Too much baking soda can alter texture, while too little may affect rise. For recipes like air fryer cakes or cookies, 0.33 cup of baking soda (2.64 ounces) is a common measurement. Check our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for other common conversions. Precision ensures your dishes turn out light, fluffy, and delicious every time.</p>  

<p>Beyond baking, baking soda is a powerhouse for cleaning air fryer baskets. A mix of 0.33 cup (2.64 ounces) with water creates a non-toxic scrub. Visit our guide on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner</a> for more tips. Accurate measurements prevent residue buildup and extend appliance life. Whether cooking or maintaining your air fryer, knowing conversions like 0.33 cup to ounces is invaluable.</p>  

<h3>How to measure 0.33 cup of baking soda without scales</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a scale, use the spoon-and-level method. Fill a measuring cup with baking soda, then level it off with a knife. For 0.33 cup, aim for one-third of a standard cup. This roughly translates to 5 tablespoons plus 1 teaspoon. While not as precise as weighing, it works in a pinch. For best results, invest in a kitchen scale—especially for air fryer recipes where consistency is key.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for 0.33 cup of baking soda in air fryers</h2>  
<p>This measurement pops up in recipes like air fryer pretzels or savoury muffins. It’s also ideal for marinating proteins—try it in our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>air fryer chicken recipes</a>. Baking soda tenderises meat and enhances browning. For vegetarian options, 0.33 cup (2.64 ounces) works wonders in tofu scrambles or veggie fritters. Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a> for inspiration.</p>  

<p>Cleaning is another major use. A paste made from 0.33 cup baking soda and water removes stubborn grease from air fryer trays. It’s chemical-free and safe for non-stick coatings. Regular maintenance with proper measurements keeps your appliance in top shape. Remember, 0.33 cup equals 2.64 ounces—whether you’re cooking or cleaning, precision pays off.</p>  

<h3>Converting other baking soda amounts for air fryer recipes</h3>

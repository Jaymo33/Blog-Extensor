description: "Cooking chicken breast in an air fryer is a game-changer for busy UK kitchens. Air Fryer Recipes UK experts recommend preheating your model to around 180 °C (360 °F) before cooking. A medium-thickness breast (6–8 oz) typically needs 13–15 minutes, flipped halfway for a perfect crispy finish. Always use a meat thermometer to confirm the internal temperature hits 74 °C (165 °F), ensuring safety and juiciness."

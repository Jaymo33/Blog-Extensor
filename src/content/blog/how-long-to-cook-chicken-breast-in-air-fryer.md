description: "Cooking chicken breast in an air fryer is a game-changer for busy UK kitchens. Air Fryer Recipes UK experts recommend preheating your model to around 180 °C (360 °F) before cooking. A medium-thickness breast (6–8 oz) typically needs 13–15 minutes, flipped halfway for a perfect crispy finish. Always use a meat thermometer to confirm the internal temperature hits 74 °C (165 °F), ensuring safety and juiciness."

<h2 id="">How Long to Cook Chicken Breast in Air Fryer</h2><p id="">Cooking chicken breast in an air fryer is a game-changer for busy UK kitchens. <a href="https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk" id="">Air Fryer Recipes UK</a> recommend <a target="_new" href="https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-knowledge-library" id="">preheating</a> your model to around 180 °C (360 °F) before cooking. A medium-thickness breast (6–8 oz) typically needs 13–15 minutes, flipped halfway for a perfect <a target="_new" href="https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes/air-fryer-breaded-chicken" id="">crispy finish</a>. Always use a <a target="_new" href="https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-knowledge-library" id="">meat thermometer</a> to confirm the internal temperature hits 74 °C (165 °F), ensuring safety and juiciness.</p><p id="">Every batch of <a target="_new" href="https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken" id="">air fryer chicken recipes</a> benefits from this approach. Thicker cuts take 16–20 minutes, while thin pieces can be ready in 10. Let the chicken rest post-cooking — <a target="_new" href="https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-knowledge-library" id="">carry-over cooking</a> brings it to perfection. Try this method in recipes like our <a target="_new" href="https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes/air-fryer-diced-chicken" id="">air fryer diced chicken</a> or <a target="_new" href="https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes/air-fryer-southern-fried-chicken" id="">southern fried chicken</a>.</p><h3 id="">Perfect Tips for Juicy Chicken Every Time</h3><p id="">Start by evening out the breast’s thickness using a rolling pin or meat mallet. Brush with oil, season well, and place in a preheated basket. Flip halfway to ensure even crisping. Use an <a target="_new" href="https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-knowledge-library" id="">instant-read thermometer</a> and don’t overcrowd—air circulation is key to results like our <a target="_new" href="https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes/air-fryer-chicken-mini-fillets" id="">air fryer chicken mini fillets</a>.</p><h2 id="">Mastering Safety &amp; Technique </h2><p id="">Proper safety starts with internal temp. For all <a href="https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken" id="">air fryer chicken recipes</a>, aim for 74 °C (165 °F) at the thickest point. Remove the chicken at 70 °C and let it rest for 5 minutes—carry-over heat does the rest. That’s how we nailed our <a target="_new" href="https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes/jamie-oliver-style-air-fryer-chicken-thighs-recipes" id="">Jamie Oliver style air fryer chicken thighs</a>.</p><p id="">Overcrowding is a common mistake.

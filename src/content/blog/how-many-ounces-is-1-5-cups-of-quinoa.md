<p>1.5 cups of quinoa equals approximately 9 ounces (255 grams). This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes, where precise measurements can make or break your dish. Whether you're meal prepping or cooking a quick quinoa salad, knowing this conversion ensures consistency. For more air fryer measurement tips, visit <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>our conversion chart</a>.</p>

<h2>Why accurate quinoa measurements matter</h2>  
<p>Using the correct amount of quinoa in your air fryer ensures even cooking and perfect texture. Too much quinoa can lead to clumping, while too little might dry out. Quinoa expands as it cooks, so 1.5 cups (9 ounces) yields about 4.5 cups cooked. This makes it ideal for <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/meal-prep>meal prep recipes</a> or family-sized portions. Always measure quinoa before rinsing to avoid discrepancies.</p>  

<p>Quinoa is a versatile ingredient, perfect for air fryer dishes like stuffed peppers or crispy quinoa patties. If you’re unsure about conversions, bookmark <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> for quick reference. Our site also features a <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>library of recipes</a> tailored for air fryer cooking.</p>  

<h3>How to measure quinoa correctly</h3>  
<p>For the most accurate 1.5 cups (9 ounces) of quinoa, use a dry measuring cup and level it off with a knife. Avoid packing the quinoa down, as this can add extra weight. If you’re using a kitchen scale, set it to ounces or grams for precision. Rinse quinoa thoroughly before cooking to remove its natural coating, which can taste bitter.</p>  

<h2>Common quinoa-to-ounce conversions</h2>  
<p>Here’s a quick reference for other quinoa measurements: 1 cup = 6 ounces, 2 cups = 12 ounces, and 3 cups = 18 ounces. These conversions help scale recipes up or down for your air fryer. For example, a <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable quinoa bake</a> might call for 1.5 cups (9 ounces) to serve four people.</p>  

<p>Remember, UK and US cup sizes are identical, so no adjustments are needed. If you’re doubling a recipe, 3 cups of quinoa will weigh 18 ounces. Store uncooked quinoa in an airtight container to maintain freshness for future <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer meals</a>.</p>  

<h3>Tips for cooking quinoa in an air fryer</h3>  
<p>Precise measurements like 1.5 cups (9 ounces) of quinoa ensure even cooking in the air fryer. Combine quinoa with water or broth in a 1:1.5 ratio for fluffy results. Cook at 180°C for 12–15 minutes, stirring halfway. Let it rest for 5 minutes before fluffing with a fork. Experiment with seasonings for added flavour.</p>

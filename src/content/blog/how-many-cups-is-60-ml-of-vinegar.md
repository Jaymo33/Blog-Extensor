<p>60 ml of vinegar equals approximately 0.25 cups (or 1/4 cup). This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements can make or break your dish. Whether you’re whipping up a marinade or adding a tangy twist to your cooking, knowing how to convert 60 ml of vinegar to cups ensures consistency and flavour balance.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Vinegar Measurements Matter</h2>
<p>Using the right amount of vinegar in your air fryer recipes is crucial for achieving the perfect taste and texture. Too little, and your dish might lack acidity; too much, and it could become overpowering. For example, a <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>marinade for chicken</a> often calls for 60 ml of vinegar, which translates to 0.25 cups. This measurement ensures the meat stays tender without becoming too sour.</p>
<p>Vinegar also plays a key role in baking, especially when combined with baking soda for leavening. If you’re making <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>air fryer cakes</a>, 60 ml of vinegar (0.25 cups) can help create a light, fluffy texture. Always measure carefully to avoid altering the chemical balance of your recipe.</p>

<h2>How to Measure 60 ml of Vinegar Without a Measuring Cup</h2>
<p>If you don’t have a measuring cup handy, you can still measure 60 ml of vinegar accurately. A standard tablespoon holds 15 ml, so four tablespoons equal 60 ml (or 0.25 cups). Alternatively, use a kitchen scale: 60 ml of vinegar weighs roughly 60 grams, as vinegar has a similar density to water.</p>
<p>For those who prefer visual cues, 60 ml of vinegar fills about one-third of a standard teacup. This method isn’t as precise but works in a pinch. For more reliable conversions, bookmark our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for quick reference.</p>

<h3>UK vs. US Cup Measurements</h3>
<p>It’s worth noting that UK and US cup measurements differ slightly. In the UK, 1 cup equals 284 ml, while in the US, it’s 240 ml. However, 60 ml of vinegar converts to 0.25 cups in both systems, making this conversion universal for most recipes. Always double-check your recipe’s origin to avoid confusion.</p>

<h2>Common Recipes Using 60 ml of Vinegar</h2>
<p>Many air fryer recipes call for 60 ml of vinegar, especially in marinades and dressings. For instance, a <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>honey-mustard chicken glaze</a> might use 60 ml of apple cider vinegar (0.25 cups) for a balanced sweetness and tang. Similarly, pickling vegetables in your air fryer often requires this measurement to achieve the right acidity.</p>
<p>Vinegar is also a great natural <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner</a>. A mix of 60 ml of vinegar and water can help remove grease and odours. This dual-purpose ingredient is a kitchen staple, so mastering its measurements is a must.</p>

<h3>Tips for Storing Vinegar</h3>
<p>To keep your vinegar fresh, store it in a cool, dark place. Exposure to light and heat can degrade its quality over time. Always seal the bottle tightly to prevent evaporation, which could alter your measurements. If you use vinegar frequently, consider buying it in bulk to save money and ensure you always have enough for your recipes.</p>

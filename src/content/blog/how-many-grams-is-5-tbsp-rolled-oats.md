<p>5 tablespoons of rolled oats weigh approximately 40 grams. This conversion is essential for precise measurements in recipes, especially when using an air fryer. Whether you're making granola, oat bars, or a healthy breakfast, knowing the exact weight ensures consistency. For more air fryer-friendly recipes, check out <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Accurate measurements are crucial for achieving the perfect texture and taste in your dishes. Too many oats can make your recipe dry, while too few might leave it soggy. This is especially important in air fryer cooking, where even heat distribution relies on balanced ingredients. If you're new to air frying, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a> can help you adjust traditional recipes effortlessly.</p>  

<p>Rolled oats are a staple in many kitchens, offering versatility and nutrition. They're great for breakfast bakes, energy balls, and even savoury coatings. For inspiration, browse our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/breakfast>breakfast recipes</a> tailored for air fryers. Measuring by weight (grams) rather than volume (tablespoons) ensures you get the same results every time.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure Rolled Oats Correctly</h3>  
<p>To measure 5 tbsp of rolled oats accurately, use a kitchen scale for the best results. Scoop the oats lightly into the tablespoon without packing them down. This prevents over-measuring, which can throw off your recipe. For air fryer cooking, consistency is keyâ€”whether you're making granola or oat-crusted chicken.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for 5 tbsp of Rolled Oats</h2>  
<p>Five tablespoons of rolled oats (40g) are perfect for single-serving recipes. You can whip up a small batch of overnight oats, a portion of homemade granola, or a coating for air-fried fish. If you're meal prepping, scale up the measurements accordingly. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/meal-prep>meal prep section</a> has plenty of ideas to get you started.</p>  

<p>Rolled oats are also a great binder in veggie burgers or meatballs. Their neutral flavour blends well with spices and herbs, making them a kitchen essential. For cleaning tips after cooking, visit <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> to keep your appliance in top condition.</p>  

<h3>Converting Other Oat Measurements</h3>  
<p>If your recipe calls for a different amount of rolled oats, here's a quick reference: 1 tbsp equals about 8g, and 1 cup is roughly 80g. These conversions are handy when adapting recipes for your air fryer. Always double-check measurements to avoid under or overloading your ingredients.</p>

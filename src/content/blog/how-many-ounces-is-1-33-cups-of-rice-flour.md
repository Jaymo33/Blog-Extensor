<p>1.33 cups of rice flour equals approximately 5.3 ounces (or 150 grams) when measured accurately. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes, where precise measurements can make or break your dish. Whether you’re making crispy coatings or gluten-free baked goods, knowing how many ounces are in 1.33 cups of rice flour ensures consistency. For more air fryer conversions, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>
<p>Air fryers rely on even heat distribution, and incorrect measurements can lead to uneven cooking or texture issues. Rice flour, in particular, behaves differently than wheat flour, so getting the right amount is crucial. Too much flour can make coatings overly dense, while too little might not crisp up properly. If you’re new to air frying, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a> has plenty of ideas to get you started.</p>
<p>Many UK home cooks prefer weighing ingredients like rice flour for accuracy. A kitchen scale is your best friend here, but if you only have measuring cups, 1.33 cups of rice flour translates to roughly 5.3 ounces. This measurement is especially handy for gluten-free recipes, where rice flour is a staple.</p>

<h2>How to measure 1.33 cups of rice flour correctly</h2>
<p>To measure 1.33 cups of rice flour accurately, fluff the flour first with a spoon to avoid compacting it. Then, gently spoon it into your measuring cup and level it off with a straight edge. Don’t tap or shake the cup, as this can lead to overpacking. For best results, weigh it out—5.3 ounces is the gold standard.</p>
<p>Rice flour is lighter than all-purpose flour, so volume measurements can vary. If you’re adapting a recipe from cups to ounces, always check whether it calls for packed or loose flour. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert recipes</a> often use rice flour for light, crispy textures.</p>

<h3>Common uses for 1.33 cups of rice flour in air fryers</h3>
<p>This amount is perfect for coating chicken or fish before air frying. It’s also ideal for making gluten-free batters or thickening sauces. Rice flour’s fine texture helps create an even, golden crust without becoming gummy. For cleaning tips after flour-heavy recipes, see our guide on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer maintenance</a>.</p>

<h2>Converting other rice flour amounts to ounces</h2>
<p>If your recipe calls for more or less than 1.33 cups, here’s a quick reference: 1 cup of rice flour equals about 4 ounces, so scaling up or down is simple. For example, 2 cups would be 8 ounces, while 0.5 cups equals 2 ounces. Bookmark our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a> for future reference.</p>
<p>Remember that humidity and brand can affect rice flour’s density. When in doubt, weigh it—especially for fussy recipes like tempura or delicate cakes. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>cake recipes</a> often specify weights for foolproof results.</p>

<h3>Tips for working with rice flour in air fryers</h3>
<p>Rice flour browns faster than wheat flour, so reduce cooking times by 1-2 minutes when using it in air fryer recipes. For extra crispiness, mix it with cornstarch (about 25% by weight). Always preheat your air fryer when using rice flour coatings to ensure even cooking from the start.</p>

<p>5 tablespoons of lime juice equals approximately 75 grams. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precision matters, whether you're marinating chicken, dressing a salad, or whipping up a zesty sauce. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we know that accurate measurements can make or break a dish, so let’s dive into the details.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate lime juice measurements matter</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of lime juice ensures balanced flavours in your air fryer dishes. Too little, and your marinade might lack tang; too much, and it could overpower other ingredients. Whether you're preparing <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>air fryer chicken</a> or a citrusy dessert, 5 tbsp of lime juice (75g) is a common measurement in many recipes. For more conversions, check our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>  

<p>Lime juice’s acidity can also affect cooking times and textures, especially in air fryer recipes. For example, marinating shrimp or tofu in lime juice requires precise amounts to avoid over-tenderising. If you’re unsure, always measure by weight for consistency.</p>  

<h2>How to measure lime juice correctly</h2>  
<p>For the most accurate results, use a digital kitchen scale to weigh your lime juice. If you don’t have one, a standard UK tablespoon holds about 15ml, which translates to roughly 15 grams for lime juice. This means 5 tbsp of lime juice will be close to 75 grams. Remember, freshly squeezed lime juice may vary slightly in density compared to bottled varieties.</p>  

<h3>Tips for consistent measurements</h3>  
<p>Strain your lime juice to remove pulp before measuring, as chunks can throw off the weight. Also, ensure your tablespoons are level—not heaped—for precision. If you’re scaling up a recipe, like our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer lime-infused dishes</a>, these small details matter.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for 5 tbsp of lime juice</h2>  
<p>This quantity is perfect for marinades, dressings, or even baking. Try it in air fryer fish tacos, citrus-glazed vegetables, or a tangy drizzle for desserts. Lime juice also works wonders in <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>air fryer desserts</a>, adding brightness to cakes and cookies.</p>  

<p>For cleaning your air fryer, a mix of lime juice and baking soda can help remove stubborn grease. Check our guide on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaning</a> for more tips. Whether cooking or cleaning, 5 tbsp of lime juice (75g) is a versatile kitchen staple.</p>

    "text": "Weight measurements are more accurate because cup measurements can vary based on how sugar is packed. Air fryers circulate heat intensely, so precise sugar amounts prevent over-browning or uneven cooking. For consistent results, especially in <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>air fryer desserts</a>, weighing ingredients is best."

    "text": "You can reduce sugar, but it may affect texture and browning. Sugar provides moisture and structure in baking. If cutting back, consider adding a tablespoon of apple sauce or yogurt per quarter cup of sugar reduced. This helps maintain the desired consistency in air fryer bakes."

<p>1.25 cups of granulated sugar equals approximately 10 ounces (UK). This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements ensure perfect texture and consistency. Whether you’re baking a cake or making cookies, knowing the exact weight of sugar helps avoid overly sweet or dry results. For more air fryer conversions, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>

<h2>Why accurate sugar measurements matter in air fryer baking</h2>  
<p>Granulated sugar plays a crucial role in air fryer baking, affecting texture, browning, and moisture. Too much sugar can cause excessive browning or even burning, while too little may leave your baked goods dry. The air fryer’s rapid circulation means ingredients react differently than in a conventional oven. For perfect results every time, measure sugar by weight (ounces) rather than volume (cups). Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> for foolproof measurements.</p>  

<p>Using a kitchen scale is the most reliable method, but if you don’t have one, spooning sugar into a measuring cup and levelling it off works too. Avoid packing sugar down, as this can lead to over-measuring. For reference, 1 cup of granulated sugar typically weighs around 8 ounces (UK), so 1.25 cups equals 10 ounces. This precision is especially important for delicate desserts like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>air fryer cakes</a>.</p>  

<h3>How to measure granulated sugar without a scale</h3>  
<p>If you don’t own a kitchen scale, use the spoon-and-level method for accuracy. Gently spoon granulated sugar into a measuring cup until it’s overflowing, then level it off with a straight edge. Never scoop directly from the bag, as this compacts the sugar and leads to inaccurate measurements. For 1.25 cups, fill one cup completely, then add a quarter cup using the same method. This ensures you get the correct 10-ounce equivalent for your air fryer recipes.</p>  

<h2>Common air fryer recipes using 1.25 cups of granulated sugar</h2>  
<p>Many air fryer desserts call for around 1.25 cups (10 ounces) of granulated sugar. Classic <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cookies>air fryer cookies</a> often use this amount to achieve the perfect balance of sweetness and chewiness. Cakes, such as vanilla or chocolate sponge, also frequently require this measurement. The air fryer’s even heat distribution ensures sugar dissolves properly, giving baked goods a uniform texture.</p>  

<p>Other recipes that may use 1.25 cups of sugar include air fryer brownies, muffins, and even some glazes or syrups. If you’re adapting a traditional recipe for the air fryer, check our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion guide</a> for adjustments. Remember, the air fryer cooks faster, so sugar caramelises quicker—keep an eye on baking times to prevent over-browning.</p>  

<h3>Tips for storing granulated sugar for air fryer use</h3>  
<p>Store granulated sugar in an airtight container in a cool, dry place to prevent clumping. Humidity can cause sugar to harden, making it difficult to measure accurately. If your sugar has lumps, break them up before measuring for your air fryer recipes. Proper storage ensures consistent results every time you bake.

<p>10g of garlic paste is approximately 0.35 ounces. Whether you're whipping up a quick marinade or adding flavour to your air fryer dishes, knowing this conversion ensures your recipes turn out just right. Garlic paste is a staple in many kitchens, especially for those who love the convenience of pre-prepared ingredients. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we understand how crucial accurate measurements are for perfect results every time.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Precision is key when it comes to air fryer recipes. Unlike traditional ovens, air fryers cook food quickly and evenly, so even small measurement errors can affect the outcome. Converting 10g of garlic paste to ounces (0.35 oz) ensures your dishes have the right balance of flavour. Too much garlic can overpower a dish, while too little might leave it bland. For more conversion tips, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>  

<p>Garlic paste is a versatile ingredient used in everything from marinades to sauces. Whether you're cooking chicken, vegetables, or even tofu in your air fryer, getting the measurement right makes all the difference. If you're new to air frying, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipes section</a> has plenty of inspiration to get you started.</p>  

<h3>How to measure garlic paste accurately</h3>  
<p>Using a digital kitchen scale is the easiest way to measure 10g of garlic paste. If you don't have one, a standard teaspoon holds roughly 5g, so two level teaspoons will give you 10g (or 0.35 oz). For sticky ingredients like garlic paste, lightly oiling the spoon can help it slide off easily. Always level off the spoon for the most accurate measurement.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for garlic paste in air fryer recipes</h2>  
<p>Garlic paste adds depth and richness to many air fryer dishes. It's perfect for marinating meats like chicken or lamb, or for seasoning vegetables before roasting. A little goes a long way, so 10g (0.35 oz) is often enough for a family-sized portion.

<p>Cleaning your air fryer after using garlic paste is important, as the strong aroma can linger. Our guide on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>how to clean your air fryer</a> has handy tips to keep it fresh and ready for your next culinary adventure.</p>  

<h3>Converting other garlic paste measurements</h3>  
<p>If your recipe calls for a different amount of garlic paste, here are some quick conversions: 5g equals 0.18 oz, 20g equals 0.71 oz, and 50g equals 1.76 oz. Keeping these conversions handy saves time and ensures consistency in your cooking. Whether you're meal prepping or cooking on the fly, accurate measurements make all the difference.</p>

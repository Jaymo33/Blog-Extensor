<p>60 ml of water equals approximately 0.25 cups (or 1/4 cup) in both UK and US measurements. This conversion is essential for precise cooking, especially when using an air fryer where accurate liquid measurements can affect texture and cooking times. Whether you’re baking, making sauces, or prepping ingredients, knowing how to convert 60 ml of water to cups ensures consistency in your recipes.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on rapid air circulation to cook food evenly, and incorrect liquid measurements can lead to soggy or uneven results. For example, adding too much water to a batter or marinade can make food steam instead of crisp. Conversely, too little liquid might dry out your dish. That’s why converting 60 ml of water to cups (0.25 cups) correctly is crucial for perfect air fryer meals.</p>

<h2>How to Measure 60 ml of Water Without a Measuring Cup</h2>  
<p>Don’t have a measuring cup handy? No problem. You can use everyday household items to estimate 60 ml of water. A standard tablespoon holds about 15 ml, so four tablespoons equal 60 ml (or 0.25 cups). Alternatively, a small shot glass typically holds 30–50 ml, so filling it slightly over halfway will get you close to 60 ml.</p>  
<p>For baking or air fryer recipes where precision is key, investing in a digital kitchen scale or a set of measuring spoons is a smart move.

<h3>UK vs. US Cup Measurements</h3>  
<p>While 60 ml of water converts to 0.25 cups in both the UK and US, it’s worth noting that cup sizes can vary slightly in other countries. For example, Australian cups are 250 ml, whereas Japanese cups are 200 ml. Stick to the standard 240 ml per cup for consistency in recipes, especially when using an air fryer.</p>  

<h2>Common Recipes Using 60 ml of Water</h2>  
<p>Many air fryer recipes call for small amounts of water, such as 60 ml, to create steam or thin out sauces. For instance, a simple stir-fry sauce might combine 60 ml of water with soy sauce, garlic, and honey. Similarly, baking powder-based batters often need precise liquid measurements to rise properly.</p>

<h3>Tips for Measuring Liquids in an Air Fryer</h3>  
<p>When adding water to air fryer recipes, use a spouted measuring cup for accuracy. Pour slowly to avoid spills, and level off the measurement with a straight edge. For marinades or sauces, mix the 60 ml of water with other ingredients in a separate bowl before adding them to the air fryer basket.</p>

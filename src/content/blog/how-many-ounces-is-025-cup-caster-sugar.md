<p>0.25 cup of caster sugar equals approximately 1.76 ounces (50 grams) in UK measurements. This conversion is essential for air fryer baking, where precise measurements can make or break your recipe. Whether you’re whipping up cakes, cookies, or desserts, knowing the exact weight ensures perfect results every time. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we simplify conversions so you can focus on creating delicious treats without the guesswork.</p>

<h2>Why accurate sugar measurements matter in air fryer baking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers cook food faster and more evenly than traditional ovens, so ingredient precision is crucial. Too much sugar can cause over-browning or burning, while too little may leave your baked goods bland. Caster sugar, with its fine granules, dissolves quickly—ideal for air fryer recipes like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>cakes</a> and meringues. By measuring 0.25 cup as 1.76 ounces, you’ll achieve consistent texture and sweetness. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a> for other common baking measurements.</p>  

<p>Many UK recipes use weight (ounces or grams) rather than volume (cups) for accuracy. A kitchen scale is the best tool, but if you’re using cups, fluff the sugar first to avoid compacting. Level it off with a knife for the correct 0.25 cup amount. This small adjustment ensures your air fryer desserts turn out light and fluffy, just like the recipes on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>.</p>  

<h3>Converting 0.25 cup caster sugar to ounces: step-by-step</h3>  
<p>To convert 0.25 cup of caster sugar to ounces, multiply the cup measurement by the weight per cup. One UK cup of caster sugar weighs roughly 7 ounces (200 grams), so 0.25 cup equals 1.76 ounces. For grams, it’s 50 grams—handy for recipes using metric measurements. If you’re adapting a US recipe, note that UK cups are slightly larger (284ml vs. 240ml), so adjustments may be needed. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe hub</a> includes UK-friendly versions of popular bakes.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for 0.25 cup caster sugar in air fryer recipes</h2>  
<p>This small-but-mighty amount of sugar is perfect for single-serving desserts or balancing flavours in savoury dishes. Try it in air fryer shortbread, fruit crumbles, or glazes for <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken</a>. Since air fryers circulate hot air, sugar caramelises beautifully—ideal for achieving a golden finish on pastries. Remember to lightly grease baking liners (find our top picks <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>here</a>) to prevent sticking.</p>  

<p>For context, 0.25 cup (1.76 oz) of caster sugar contains about 14 teaspoons. That’s enough to sweeten a batch of air fryer cookies or a small sponge cake. If reducing sugar in a recipe, substitute cautiously—it affects texture and browning. Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert section</a> for inspiration using this measurement.</p>  

<h3>Tips for measuring caster sugar without scales</h3>  
<p>No scales? Use the spoon-and-level method: gently spoon sugar into a measuring cup until heaped, then level with a knife. Avoid tapping the cup, as this compacts the sugar and skews the 0.25 cup-to-ounce ratio. For sticky caster sugar, lightly coat the cup with oil first. Store sugar in an airtight container to maintain consistency—humid conditions can clump it, making measurements less accurate.</p>

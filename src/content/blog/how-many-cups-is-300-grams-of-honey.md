Whether you're whipping up a glaze or sweetening a marinade, knowing how many cups 300 grams of honey equals ensures perfect results every time.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Honey Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Honey is a staple in many recipes, from cakes to glazes, and its thick consistency means small measurement errors can impact texture and taste. For air fryer recipes, precision is key—too much honey can cause sticking or uneven cooking, while too little might leave dishes bland. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we emphasise accurate conversions to help you nail every dish.</p>  

<p>Honey’s density varies slightly depending on temperature and type, but 300 grams generally fills just under a cup. This makes it crucial to measure correctly, especially when adapting recipes for air fryers.

<h2>UK vs. US Cup Measurements for Honey</h2>  
<p>In the UK, a standard cup holds 250ml, while in the US, it’s 240ml. This slight difference means 300 grams of honey equals approximately 0.88 UK cups or 0.79 US cups. If you’re following a recipe from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>our collection</a>, always check which measurement system it uses.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure Honey Without Scales</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have scales, use the spoon-and-level method. Fill a measuring cup with honey, then level it off with a knife. Remember, honey’s stickiness can make this tricky, so lightly greasing the cup helps. For air fryer recipes, consistency matters—so weigh whenever possible.</p>  

<h2>Using 300 Grams of Honey in Air Fryer Recipes</h2>

<h2>Understanding Cup to Millilitre Conversions</h2>
<p>When converting cups to millilitres, it's important to note that 1.0 cups of water is precisely 236.588 ml. This measurement is based on the US customary cup, which is the standard used in most recipes. If you're using a UK cup, the measurement differs slightly at 284.131 ml, but most modern recipes default to the US measurement. For air fryer cooking, sticking to the US standard ensures consistency.</p>
<p>Many <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> rely on precise liquid measurements to achieve the right texture and doneness. Whether you're making crispy vegetables or a moist cake, knowing how many ml are in 1.0 cups of water helps avoid under or over-hydrating your ingredients. Always use a proper measuring cup for liquids to ensure accuracy.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>
<p>Air fryers cook food quickly using circulating hot air, which means small measurement errors can lead to uneven cooking.

That's why knowing that 1.0 cups of water equals 236.588 ml is crucial.</p>

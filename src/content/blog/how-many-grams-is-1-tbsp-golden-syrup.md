Use about 20 grams (just under 1 tbsp) of honey per 21 grams of golden syrup to balance the flavour. Adjust cooking times slightly, as honey may caramelise faster in the air fryer."

<p>One tablespoon (1 tbsp) of golden syrup weighs approximately 21 grams. This measurement is essential for air fryer recipes where precision ensures perfect texture and flavour. Whether you're baking cakes or glazing meats, knowing the exact weight helps avoid overly sweet or dry results.

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Golden syrup is a staple in many British desserts and glazes, but using too much or too little can ruin a dish. The air fryer's rapid cooking means ingredients must be measured precisely to avoid burning or uneven cooking. A slight variation in golden syrup’s weight can affect caramelisation, moisture, and overall taste. For foolproof recipes, always measure by weight rather than volume where possible. Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> for inspiration on using golden syrup perfectly.</p>  

<h3>How to measure golden syrup correctly</h3>  
<p>To measure 1 tbsp of golden syrup accurately, lightly grease the spoon to help the syrup slide off easily. Alternatively, use a digital kitchen scale for the most precise 21-gram measurement. This method is especially useful for sticky ingredients like golden syrup, ensuring consistency in every batch. For cleaning sticky residue, try our recommended <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner</a>.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for golden syrup in air fryer recipes</h2>  
<p>Golden syrup adds a rich, buttery sweetness to air fryer desserts like sticky toffee pudding or flapjacks. It’s also great for glazing ham or brushing over roasted vegetables for a caramelised finish. Since the air fryer cooks quickly, the syrup’s sugar content helps achieve a glossy coating without burning. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert recipes</a> for more ways to use golden syrup.</p>  

<h3>Converting other golden syrup measurements</h3>  
<p>If a recipe calls for grams but you only have measuring spoons, remember that 1 teaspoon of golden syrup weighs about 7 grams. For larger quantities, 100 grams of golden syrup equals roughly 4.8 tablespoons. These conversions ensure your air fryer dishes turn out just right, whether you're scaling up or down. Need more tips?

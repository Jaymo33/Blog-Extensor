<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Golden syrup is a staple in many British desserts and glazes, but using too much or too little can ruin a dish. The air fryer's rapid cooking means ingredients must be measured precisely to avoid burning or uneven cooking. A slight variation in golden syrup’s weight can affect caramelisation, moisture, and overall taste. For foolproof recipes, always measure by weight rather than volume where possible.

<h3>How to measure golden syrup correctly</h3>  
<p>To measure 1 tbsp of golden syrup accurately, lightly grease the spoon to help the syrup slide off easily. Alternatively, use a digital kitchen scale for the most precise 21-gram measurement.

<p>3 cups of gram flour equals approximately 12 ounces (340 grams). This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precision ensures perfect texture and crispiness. Whether you're making pakoras, bhajis, or gluten-free baked goods, knowing the exact weight helps avoid kitchen mishaps.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on even heat distribution, so using the right amount of ingredients is crucial. Too much gram flour can make dishes dense, while too little may affect binding. For consistent results, weighing ingredients like gram flour ensures your air-fried creations turn out perfectly every time.</p>  
<p>If you're new to air frying, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for other common ingredient conversions. It’s a lifesaver for adapting traditional recipes to your air fryer. Gram flour, also known as besan, is a staple in many cuisines, so getting the measurements right opens up a world of delicious possibilities.</p>  

<h2>How to Measure Gram Flour Correctly</h2>  
<p>Measuring dry ingredients like gram flour can be tricky if you don’t use the right technique. For the most accurate results, spoon the flour into your measuring cup and level it off with a knife. Avoid packing it down, as this can lead to over-measuring.</p>  
<p>If you’re working with a recipe from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>our collection</a>, you’ll often find both volume (cups) and weight (ounces/grams) measurements. This dual approach helps eliminate guesswork, especially when dealing with ingredients like gram flour, which can vary in density.</p>  

<h3>Common Uses for Gram Flour in Air Fryers</h3>  
<p>Gram flour is incredibly versatile in air fryer cooking. It’s perfect for coating vegetables, making crispy snacks, or even as a gluten-free alternative in baking. Popular dishes include onion bhajis, crispy tofu, and spiced chickpea fritters—all of which benefit from precise measurements.</p>  

<h2>Converting Other Gram Flour Quantities</h2>  
<p>Need to adjust your recipe? Here’s a quick reference for other common gram flour conversions: 1 cup ≈ 4 ounces (113g), 2 cups ≈ 8 ounces (227g), and 4 cups ≈ 16 ounces (454g). Keeping these numbers handy simplifies scaling recipes up or down.</p>

<h3>Tips for Storing Gram Flour</h3>  
<p>To keep gram flour fresh, store it in an airtight container in a cool, dark place. It has a high fat content, which can turn rancid if exposed to heat or moisture. Proper storage ensures your flour stays ready for your next air fryer adventure.</p>

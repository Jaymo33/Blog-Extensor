<h2>Why convert 125g of cream cheese to ounces?</h2>  
<p>Many UK recipes use grams, while others reference ounces, especially older cookbooks or international guides.

Cream cheese is a staple in dishes like stuffed mushrooms or <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer desserts</a>, so getting the measurement right is key. A small discrepancy can affect texture, so always weigh ingredients for consistency.</p>  

<p>If you're using an air fryer, cream cheese measurements matter even more. Too much can make fillings runny, while too little might leave dishes dry.

<h3>How to measure 125g of cream cheese without scales</h3>  
<p>No kitchen scales? Use tablespoons: 125g of cream cheese is roughly 8 level tablespoons. Pack it firmly to avoid air gaps for accuracy. For block cream cheese, 125g is about 1/2 cup when softened. If you're prepping <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>air fryer desserts</a>, these approximations work in a pinch. Remember, though, weighing is always best for precision.</p>

Cream cheese also adds richness to mashed potatoes or <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/breakfast>air fryer breakfasts</a> like stuffed French toast. Always soften it first for even mixing and smoother results.</p>

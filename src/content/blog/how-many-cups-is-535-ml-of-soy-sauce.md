<p>535 ml of soy sauce is approximately 2.26 cups. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes, where precise measurements can make or break your dish. Whether you're marinating chicken or whipping up a stir-fry, knowing this conversion ensures your flavours are spot-on. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we help simplify cooking conversions so you can focus on creating delicious meals.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of soy sauce is crucial for balancing flavours in air fryer dishes. Too much can overpower, while too little might leave your meal tasting bland. The air fryer's intense heat means liquids reduce faster, so precision is key. For more tips on perfecting your air fryer recipes, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipes section</a>. Whether you're cooking chicken, tofu, or vegetables, accurate measurements ensure consistent results.</p>  

<p>Many air fryer enthusiasts struggle with converting metric to imperial measurements. A standard cup holds 240 ml, but slight variations exist between UK and US measurements. For soy sauce, which is slightly denser than water, 535 ml converts to roughly 2.26 cups. This small difference can impact your dish, so always measure carefully. Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more handy conversions.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure 535 ml of Soy Sauce Without a Measuring Cup</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a measuring cup, you can use a kitchen scale for accuracy. Soy sauce weighs about 1.04 grams per ml, so 535 ml would be roughly 556 grams. Alternatively, use a standard mug (about 250 ml) and fill it just over twice. For more creative measuring hacks, visit <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>. Remember, consistency is key when preparing marinades or sauces for your air fryer.</p>  

<h2>Common Recipes Using 535 ml of Soy Sauce</h2>  
<p>Many Asian-inspired air fryer dishes call for soy sauce in this quantity. Teriyaki chicken, stir-fried vegetables, or even glazed salmon often require precise measurements. For a delicious teriyaki recipe, head to our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken category</a>. The 535 ml measurement is perfect for batch cooking or meal prep, ensuring your flavours are evenly distributed.</p>  

<p>Soy sauce isn’t just for savoury dishes—it can also enhance desserts like chocolate cakes or cookies. The umami flavour adds depth, but getting the measurement right is critical. Too much can ruin the balance. If you're experimenting, start with smaller quantities and adjust. For dessert ideas, browse our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>cakes section</a>.</p>  

<h3>Tips for Storing Leftover Soy Sauce</h3>  
<p>Once opened, soy sauce should be stored in a cool, dark place to maintain its flavour. If you’ve measured out 535 ml but only used part, transfer the rest to an airtight container. Proper storage ensures it stays fresh for future air fryer recipes.

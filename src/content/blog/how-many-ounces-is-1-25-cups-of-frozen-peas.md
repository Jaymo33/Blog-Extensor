<p>1.25 cups of frozen peas weigh approximately 10 ounces (283 grams). This measurement is essential for air fryer recipes, ensuring your dishes turn out perfectly portioned every time. Whether you're meal prepping or whipping up a quick side, knowing this conversion saves time and hassle.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of frozen peas ensures even cooking and prevents overcrowding in your air fryer basket. Overloading can lead to unevenly cooked or soggy results, while too little might dry out. For best results, stick to the 1.25 cups (10 oz) measurement when following recipes on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>.</p>  

<p>Many air fryer recipes, like those in our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetables category</a>, rely on precise measurements for optimal texture and flavour. Frozen peas are a versatile ingredient, perfect for quick sides or adding to mixed dishes. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a> for other common ingredient measurements.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure Frozen Peas Correctly</h3>  
<p>For the most accurate 1.25 cups to ounces conversion, use dry measuring cups and level off the top. Don't pack the peas down, as this can add extra weight. If you don't have measuring cups, a kitchen scale is your best friend – simply weigh out 10 ounces of frozen peas instead.</p>  

<h2>Adjusting Air Fryer Recipes with Frozen Peas</h2>  
<p>Many frozen pea recipes call for 1.25 cups (10 oz) as a standard portion size. This works perfectly for 2-3 servings as a side dish. If you're adapting a recipe from our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipes section</a>, you might need to adjust cooking times slightly based on your air fryer model.</p>  

<p>For crispy roasted peas, spread your 10 ounces of frozen peas in a single layer in the air fryer basket. Cook at 190°C for 8-10 minutes, shaking halfway. The high heat quickly thaws and crisps the peas without making them mushy. This method works great for snackable peas or salad toppers.</p>  

<h3>Storing Leftover Frozen Peas</h3>  
<p>If you don't use all your measured 1.25 cups (10 oz) of peas, simply refreeze them in an airtight container. They'll keep for several months. When ready to use again, there's no need to thaw – just add a minute or two to your air fryer cooking time.</p>  

<h2>Nutritional Benefits of 1.25 Cups Frozen Peas</h2>  
<p>That 10-ounce portion of frozen peas packs about 125 calories, 8g protein, and 5g fibre. They're an excellent source of vitamins A, C, and K. The convenience of frozen peas means you always have this nutritious veggie on hand for quick air fryer meals.</p>

<p>35 ml of cream is approximately 0.15 cups in the UK and 0.148 cups in the US. Whether you're whipping up a dessert or adding richness to a savoury dish, knowing this conversion ensures your recipe turns out perfectly every time. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we understand how crucial precise measurements are, especially when using an air fryer where consistency is key.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of cream can make or break a recipe. Too little, and your dish might lack richness; too much, and it could become overly heavy or soggy. Air fryers, in particular, rely on balanced ingredients for even cooking. If you're preparing a creamy sauce or a dessert like our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>air fryer desserts</a>, 35 ml of cream needs to be measured correctly to avoid disappointment.</p>  

<p>For those who love baking, small discrepancies in measurements can lead to texture issues. A precise 35 ml of cream ensures your cakes, custards, or frostings have the perfect consistency. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for other common measurement swaps to keep your cooking on track.</p>  

<h3>UK vs. US Cup Measurements</h3>  
<p>It's important to note that UK and US cup measurements differ slightly. In the UK, 1 cup equals 284 ml, while in the US, it's 240 ml. This means 35 ml of cream converts to roughly 0.15 cups in the UK and 0.148 cups in the US. If you're following a recipe from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>our collection</a>, always check which measurement system it uses.</p>  

<h2>How to Measure 35 ml of Cream Without a Scale</h2>  
<p>Not everyone has a kitchen scale or measuring jug handy, but there are simple ways to measure 35 ml of cream. A standard tablespoon holds about 15 ml, so just over two tablespoons will give you 35 ml. Alternatively, use a shot glass, which typically holds 25-30 ml, and top it up slightly. For air fryer recipes, precision matters—so if you're unsure, invest in a small measuring cup or spoons.</p>  

<p>Another handy trick is to use the markings on your cream packaging. Many UK brands indicate millilitres on the side, making it easy to pour out 35 ml directly. If you're scaling up a recipe, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a> can help adjust other ingredients proportionally.</p>  

<h3>Common Recipes Using 35 ml of Cream</h3>  
<p>35 ml of cream is a versatile amount used in many dishes. It's perfect for enriching soups, creating a silky pasta sauce, or adding moisture to baked goods. Try it in our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>creamy chicken recipes</a> for a luxurious touch. In air fryer cooking, a small amount of cream can elevate dishes like mashed potatoes or scrambled eggs without making them too heavy.</p>  

<h2>Converting Other Cream Measurements</h2>  
<p>If your recipe calls for a different amount of cream, here are some quick conversions: 50 ml is roughly 0.21 UK cups, 100 ml is about 0.42 UK cups, and 250 ml equals just over 1 UK cup.

<p>25g of maple syrup equals approximately 0.88 ounces. Whether you're whipping up a glaze for air-fried salmon or sweetening a dessert, knowing this conversion ensures your recipes turn out perfectly. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we understand the importance of precise measurements for flawless cooking.</p>  

<h2>Why convert 25g of maple syrup to ounces?</h2>  
<p>Many UK recipes use grams, but some kitchen scales or international recipes might list ingredients in ounces. Converting 25g of maple syrup to ounces (0.88 oz) helps maintain accuracy, especially when working with sticky ingredients like syrup. Air fryer recipes, like our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>maple-glazed carrots</a>, often require small, precise amounts to avoid overpowering flavours.</p>  

<p>Using the correct measurement ensures your dish isn’t too sweet or too bland. Maple syrup’s thickness means even a slight miscalculation can affect texture and taste. For more conversions, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>  

<h3>How to measure 25g of maple syrup accurately</h3>  
<p>For sticky ingredients like maple syrup, weighing is more reliable than volume measurements. Use a digital scale set to grams, and lightly grease your spoon or measuring cup to help the syrup slide off easily. If you don’t have a scale, 25g is roughly 1.5 tablespoons, but weighing is always best for precision.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for 25g of maple syrup in air fryer recipes</h2>  
<p>This small amount of maple syrup is perfect for glazes, marinades, or drizzling over air-fried desserts. Try it in our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>maple-mustard chicken thighs</a> or as a sweetener for roasted nuts. The key is balancing sweetness without making dishes overly sugary.</p>  

<p>Maple syrup also works wonders in breakfast recipes, like air-fried French toast or pancake bites. For more inspiration, browse our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/breakfast>breakfast category</a>. Remember, 25g (0.88 oz) is just enough to add depth without overwhelming other flavours.</p>  

<h3>Tips for working with maple syrup in air fryers</h3>  
<p>Maple syrup can burn quickly due to its sugar content. To prevent this, mix it with oil or butter when glazing, and cook at a lower temperature. Always preheat your air fryer to ensure even cooking. For sticky residue, clean your basket promptly with our recommended <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner</a>.</p>

<h2>Why convert 125g of powdered milk to ounces?</h2>

Converting 125g of powdered milk to ounces (4.41 oz) ensures accuracy, whether you’re following a <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe</a> or scaling portions. Powdered milk is a staple in baking and sauces, so getting the measurement right affects texture and flavour. A slight miscalculation could lead to a dry cake or runny batter, so precision matters.</p>  

<p>If you’re using an air fryer for desserts like cheesecakes or custards, powdered milk often adds richness. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a> can help you switch between units effortlessly.

<h3>How to measure 125g of powdered milk without scales</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a scale, use measuring cups or spoons for approximate conversions. One tablespoon of powdered milk weighs about 6g, so 125g would be roughly 21 tablespoons.

Scooping powdered milk directly can vary due to compaction, so fluff it first for consistency.</p>

Whether you're making a creamy soup or a saucy dish, knowing how to convert millilitres to cups ensures perfect results every time.</p>

<h2>Understanding the Conversion</h2>
<p>Converting 660 ml of chicken broth to cups depends on which measurement system you're using. In the US, 1 cup equals 240 ml, while in the UK, 1 cup is 284 ml. This means 660 ml translates to roughly 2.79 US cups or 2.34 UK cups. Always check your recipe's origin to use the correct conversion.</p>

<h2>Why Measurement Accuracy Matters</h2>
<p>Precision is key when working with liquids in air fryer recipes. Chicken broth adds moisture and flavour, but the wrong amount can ruin a dish. Whether you're making a <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipe</a> or a vegetable stew, the 660 ml to cups conversion ensures consistent results.</p>
<p>Air fryers circulate hot air, so liquids evaporate faster than in conventional ovens. Measuring 660 ml of chicken broth correctly helps balance moisture levels. For best results, use a liquid measuring cup rather than dry measuring cups for accuracy.</p>

<h3>US vs UK Cup Measurements</h3>
<p>The difference between US and UK cups affects how you measure 660 ml of chicken broth. US cups are smaller (240 ml), while UK cups are larger (284 ml). This means 660 ml equals more US cups (2.79) than UK cups (2.34). Always check which system your recipe uses.</p>

<h2>Practical Applications</h2>
<p>Knowing that 660 ml of chicken broth equals about 2.79 US cups helps when scaling recipes. Many air fryer dishes call for specific amounts of liquid to create steam or sauce. This conversion is particularly useful for <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>one-pot air fryer meals</a> where broth is a key ingredient.</p>

<h3>Measuring Without a Cup</h3>
<p>If you don't have measuring cups, you can still measure 660 ml of chicken broth using other methods. A standard UK metric measuring jug will show millilitres clearly. Alternatively, know that 660 ml is just slightly less than three-quarters of a litre.</p>

<h2>Conversion Tips for Perfect Results</h2>
<p>When converting 660 ml of chicken broth to cups, always use liquid measuring tools for accuracy. Eye-balling can lead to inconsistent results, especially in air fryer cooking where evaporation rates are higher. For best results, measure at eye level on a flat surface.</p>
<p>Remember that 660 ml of chicken broth equals different cup amounts depending on your location. This is particularly important when following international recipes from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> or other sources. When in doubt, stick to millilitres for precision.</p>

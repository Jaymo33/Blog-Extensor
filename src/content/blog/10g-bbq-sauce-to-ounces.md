<p>10g of BBQ sauce equals approximately 0.35 ounces. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements can make or break a dish. Whether you’re marinating chicken, glazing salmon, or prepping a quick snack, knowing how to convert grams to ounces ensures consistency. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we focus on making cooking effortless, and accurate measurements are a big part of that.</p>  

<h2>Why Convert 10g of BBQ Sauce to Ounces?</h2>  
<p>Many UK recipes use grams, but some air fryer guides or international cookbooks might list ingredients in ounces. Converting 10g of BBQ sauce to ounces (0.35 oz) helps avoid guesswork. This is especially useful when following precise recipes, like those for sticky ribs or glazed tofu found in our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipes section</a>. A small discrepancy in sauce quantity can affect texture and flavour, so accuracy matters.</p>  

<p>Air fryers cook food quickly, and sauces like BBQ can caramelise faster than expected. Measuring 10g correctly (0.35 oz) ensures even coating without overloading. Too much sauce can lead to messy drips or uneven cooking, while too little might leave your dish dry.

<h3>How to Measure 10g of BBQ Sauce Accurately</h3>  
<p>Use digital kitchen scales for the most precise measurement of 10g (0.35 oz) of BBQ sauce. If you don’t have scales, a teaspoon holds roughly 5g, so two level teaspoons will get you close. For thicker sauces, lightly grease the spoon to help it slide off easily. Remember, 10g of BBQ sauce to ounces is a small amount—ideal for coating a single portion of chicken or veggies in your air fryer.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for 10g of BBQ Sauce in Air Fryers</h2>  
<p>This quantity is perfect for glazing <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken wings</a> or drumsticks before air frying. Spread 10g (0.35 oz) evenly for a sticky, caramelised finish. It’s also great for marinating tofu or brushing onto salmon fillets. For larger batches, simply scale up the measurement proportionally—20g would be 0.7 oz, and so on.</p>

<h3>Tips for Working with BBQ Sauce in Air Fryers</h3>  
<p>To prevent mess, apply 10g (0.35 oz) of BBQ sauce in the last few minutes of cooking. This stops it from burning or dripping onto the basket.

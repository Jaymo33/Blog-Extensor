<h2>Understanding Heavy Cream Measurements</h2>
<p>Heavy cream, also known as double cream in the UK, is a staple in many recipes. When converting 260 ml of heavy cream to cups, it's essential to know which measurement system you're using. In the US, 1 cup equals 240 ml, while in the UK, 1 cup is 250 ml. This slight difference can affect your recipe, especially in baking where precision matters.</p>
<p>For air fryer recipes, such as those found in our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipes</a> section, accurate measurements ensure your dishes turn out perfectly. Whether you're making a creamy pasta sauce or a decadent dessert, knowing how many cups 260 ml of heavy cream equals will save you time and hassle.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Conversions Matter</h2>
<p>Using the wrong amount of heavy cream can alter the texture and taste of your dish. Too much cream can make a sauce overly rich, while too little can leave it dry. For air fryer cooking, where ingredients cook quickly, precision is even more critical. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> can help you avoid these pitfalls.</p>

<h3>US vs UK Cup Measurements</h3>
<p>The difference between US and UK cup measurements might seem small, but it can add up in larger recipes. For 260 ml of heavy cream, the US measurement is 1.1 cups, while the UK measurement is 1.04 cups. This discrepancy is due to the different standards used in each country.</p>

<h2>Tips for Measuring Heavy Cream</h2>

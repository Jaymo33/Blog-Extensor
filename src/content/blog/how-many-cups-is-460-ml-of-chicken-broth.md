<p>460 ml of chicken broth equals approximately 1.94 cups in the UK or 1.92 cups in the US. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes, where precise measurements can make or break a dish. Whether you’re making soups, stews, or sauces, knowing how to convert 460 ml of chicken broth to cups ensures consistency. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we focus on helping you get the measurements right for perfect results every time.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>
<p>Using the correct amount of chicken broth is crucial for achieving the right texture and flavour in your air fryer dishes. Too much liquid can make your food soggy, while too little can leave it dry. Converting 460 ml of chicken broth to cups helps you follow recipes accurately, especially when adapting traditional oven or stovetop recipes for the air fryer. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> is a handy tool for these adjustments.</p>
<p>Chicken broth is a versatile ingredient used in everything from marinades to gravy. Whether you’re cooking <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipes</a> or vegetable dishes, knowing that 460 ml of chicken broth is roughly 1.94 cups (UK) or 1.92 cups (US) ensures your meals turn out as intended. This precision is especially important when scaling recipes up or down.</p>

<h2>How to Measure 460 ml of Chicken Broth Without a Measuring Cup</h2>
<p>If you don’t have a measuring cup, you can still measure 460 ml of chicken broth using other tools. A standard UK metric cup holds 250 ml, so 460 ml is just under two cups. In the US, where a cup is 240 ml, 460 ml is slightly less than two cups. For the most accurate results, use a kitchen scale—460 ml of chicken broth weighs about 460 grams.</p>
<p>Another method is to use tablespoons: 1 UK tablespoon is 15 ml, so 460 ml equals roughly 31 tablespoons. This method is less precise but works in a pinch. For more tips on accurate measurements, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a>, which includes detailed guides for air fryer cooking.</p>

<h3>UK vs. US Cup Measurements for Chicken Broth</h3>
<p>The slight difference between UK and US cup measurements means 460 ml of chicken broth converts to 1.94 cups in the UK and 1.92 cups in the US. This variation might seem small, but it can affect recipes where precision matters, such as baking or reducing sauces. Always check whether your recipe uses UK or US measurements to avoid discrepancies.</p>

<h2>Common Recipes Using 460 ml of Chicken Broth</h2>
<p>Many air fryer recipes call for 460 ml of chicken broth, including soups, casseroles, and marinades. For example, a creamy chicken and mushroom casserole might require this exact amount to achieve the perfect consistency. You can find inspiration in our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/mushrooms>mushroom recipes</a> section, where broth is often a key ingredient.</p>
<p>Another popular use for 460 ml of chicken broth is in gravy or sauce preparations. The air fryer’s concentrated heat can reduce liquids quickly, so starting with the right amount—1.94 cups in the UK or 1.92 cups in the US—ensures your sauce isn’t too thick or thin.

<h3>Converting Other Liquid Measurements for Air Fryer Recipes</h3>

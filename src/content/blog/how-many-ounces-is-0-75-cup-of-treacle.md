<p>0.75 cup of treacle equals approximately 8.5 ounces. This measurement is crucial for air fryer recipes where precision can make or break your dish. Treacle, a thick syrup, is often used in British baking, and knowing its weight ensures your recipes turn out perfectly. Whether you're making sticky toffee pudding or treacle tart, accurate measurements matter. Visit <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes</a> for more inspiration.</p>

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>
<p>Air fryers rely on precise measurements to ensure even cooking and perfect results. Too much treacle can make your dish overly sweet or sticky, while too little might leave it dry. Measuring 0.75 cup of treacle in ounces helps you stay consistent. This is especially important for recipes like treacle flapjacks or gingerbread. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more handy tips.</p>

<p>Treacle’s density means volume measurements can vary slightly, so weighing it ensures accuracy. A kitchen scale is your best friend here, but if you don’t have one, our conversion guide will help. For more baking ideas, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>cake recipes</a> designed for air fryers.</p>

<h2>How to measure treacle without a scale</h2>
<p>If you don’t have a kitchen scale, you can still measure 0.75 cup of treacle accurately. Use a liquid measuring cup and level it off with a spatula. Remember, treacle is sticky, so lightly greasing the cup can help it slide out easily. This method ensures you get close to the 8.5-ounce mark.

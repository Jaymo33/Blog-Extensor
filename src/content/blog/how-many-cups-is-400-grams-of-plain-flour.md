<p>400 grams of plain flour is roughly equivalent to 3.2 cups in the UK and 3.3 cups in the US. Measuring flour by weight ensures accuracy, especially when baking or preparing air fryer recipes. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we emphasise precision for the best results.</p>  

<h2>Why Measuring Flour Accurately Matters</h2>  
<p>Using the correct amount of flour is crucial for achieving the right texture in baked goods. Too much flour can make cakes dense, while too little can cause them to collapse. Air fryer recipes, like those on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes</a>, rely on precise measurements for even cooking.</p>  
<p>Measuring by weight (grams) is more reliable than volume (cups) because flour can settle or be packed differently. A digital kitchen scale ensures consistency, whether you're making bread, cookies, or air-fried treats.</p>  

<h3>UK vs. US Cup Measurements</h3>  
<p>In the UK, 1 cup of plain flour weighs about 125 grams, so 400 grams equals roughly 3.2 cups. In the US, 1 cup is approximately 120 grams, making 400 grams about 3.3 cups. Always check which standard your recipe follows.</p>  

<h2>How to Measure 400 Grams of Plain Flour Without a Scale</h2>  
<p>If you don’t have a scale, fluff the flour with a fork before spooning it into a measuring cup. Level it off with a knife for accuracy. However, for best results, invest in a scale—especially for air fryer baking, where precision matters.</p>  
<p>For more conversion tips, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>. It’s a handy tool for adapting recipes to your air fryer.</p>  

<h3>Common Recipes Using 400 Grams of Plain Flour</h3>  
<p>This amount is perfect for cakes, bread, or batter for air-fried foods. Try our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>air fryer cake recipes</a> for delicious, evenly baked treats. Remember, accurate measurements ensure perfect results every time.</p>  

<h2>Tips for Storing and Using Plain Flour</h2>  
<p>Store flour in an airtight container to prevent moisture absorption. If your flour feels compacted, sieve it before measuring. For cleaning tips, visit <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner</a> to keep your appliance in top condition.</p>

<p>85 ml of vegetable oil is approximately 0.36 cups in the US measurement system and 0.30 cups in the UK system. Whether you're following a recipe for your air fryer or baking, knowing this conversion ensures accuracy. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we understand how crucial precise measurements are for perfect results.</p>

<h2>Understanding the Conversion</h2>
<p>Converting millilitres to cups can be tricky, especially when dealing with ingredients like vegetable oil. The density of oil means it doesn’t always align perfectly with water-based measurements. For 85 ml of vegetable oil, the US standard cup (240 ml) gives roughly 0.36 cups, while the UK metric cup (284 ml) results in about 0.30 cups. This difference matters when scaling recipes for your air fryer or oven.</p>
<p>If you’re using an air fryer, accuracy is key to avoiding overly greasy or dry dishes. For example, a recipe calling for 85 ml of vegetable oil in cups ensures even cooking.

<h2>Why Measurement Accuracy Matters</h2>
<p>Using the correct amount of vegetable oil affects texture, moisture, and cooking time. Too much oil can make food soggy, while too little may lead to sticking or uneven browning. Air fryers, in particular, rely on minimal oil for crispy results, so measuring 85 ml of vegetable oil precisely is essential.</p>
<p>For air frying classics like crispy potatoes or chicken wings, 85 ml of vegetable oil in cups translates to just under half a US cup. This small quantity is often enough to coat ingredients lightly. Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipes</a> section for oil-free or low-oil air fryer ideas.</p>

<h3>US vs. UK Cup Measurements</h3>
<p>The difference between US and UK cups stems from historical measurement systems. A US cup holds 240 ml, while a UK cup is 284 ml. When converting 85 ml of vegetable oil, this variance means adjusting recipes accordingly. Always check which standard your recipe uses to avoid mishaps.</p>

<h2>Practical Tips for Measuring Oil</h2>
<p>For best results, use a liquid measuring cup with clear ml and cup markings. Pour the oil slowly to the 85 ml line, then check the cup equivalent. If you don’t have a measuring cup, a tablespoon (15 ml) can help—85 ml equals about 5.5 tablespoons.</p>

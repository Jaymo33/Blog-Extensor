<p>385 ml of evaporated milk is approximately 1.63 cups. Whether you're baking a cake or whipping up a creamy sauce, knowing this conversion ensures your recipe turns out just right. Evaporated milk is a staple in many dishes, from desserts to savoury meals, and getting the measurement spot-on matters. If you're using an air fryer for recipes requiring evaporated milk, precise measurements help avoid soggy or dry results. Head over to <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>our conversion chart</a> for more handy measurement guides.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Using the correct amount of evaporated milk can make or break your dish. Too little, and your recipe might lack creaminess; too much, and it could become overly dense. For air fryer recipes, where consistency is key, measuring 385 ml of evaporated milk accurately ensures even cooking. Many baking recipes, like custards or flans, rely on precise liquid ratios for the perfect texture. Check out <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>our recipe collection</a> for dishes that use evaporated milk perfectly.</p>  

<p>Evaporated milk is thicker than regular milk, so volume conversions aren't always straightforward. A standard cup holds 240 ml, but evaporated milk's density means 385 ml translates to roughly 1.63 cups. This small difference can impact your cooking, especially in air fryer baking where moisture levels are crucial. Always use a measuring jug for liquids to avoid errors.

<h3>Converting 385 ml to Cups for Different Recipes</h3>  
<p>Whether you're making a pie, pudding, or sauce, 385 ml of evaporated milk equals about 1.63 cups. For US recipes, this conversion is essential since many use cup measurements. In the UK, where metric measurements are standard, knowing both systems helps when following international recipes. If you're adapting a recipe for your air fryer, precise measurements ensure even heat distribution. Need more conversions?

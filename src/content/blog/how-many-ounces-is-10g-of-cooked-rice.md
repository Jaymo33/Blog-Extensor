<p>10 grams of cooked rice equals approximately 0.35 ounces. This conversion is handy when preparing air fryer meals, especially if you’re following recipes that use ounces instead of grams. Whether you’re meal prepping or cooking a single portion, knowing this measurement ensures accuracy and consistency in your dishes.</p>

<h2>Why convert 10g of cooked rice to ounces?</h2>  
<p>Many air fryer recipes, especially those from the UK or US, list ingredients in ounces rather than grams. Converting 10g of cooked rice to ounces (0.35 oz) helps you follow these recipes precisely. This is particularly useful for dishes like air-fried rice cakes or stuffed peppers, where portion control matters. For more air fryer conversions, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>  

<p>Accurate measurements also prevent overloading your air fryer basket, which can affect cooking performance. Whether you’re making a quick <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable stir-fry</a> or reheating leftovers, knowing the weight in ounces ensures even cooking. Plus, it simplifies scaling recipes up or down depending on your needs.</p>  

<h3>How to measure 10g of cooked rice</h3>  
<p>To measure 10g of cooked rice, use a digital kitchen scale for precision. If you don’t have one, a rough estimate is about two level teaspoons. Remember, cooked rice weighs more than uncooked rice due to absorbed water, so always measure after cooking.

<h2>Common uses for 10g of cooked rice in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>10g of cooked rice might seem small, but it’s perfect for single-serving dishes. Try it in air-fried arancini, stuffed mushrooms, or as a base for mini rice bowls. It’s also ideal for <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/meal-prep>meal prep</a>, allowing you to portion rice evenly across multiple meals.</p>  

<p>Another great use is in air fryer sushi rolls or rice-stuffed peppers. Since air fryers cook quickly, smaller portions like 10g (0.35 oz) ensure even heating without drying out the rice.

<h3>Tips for cooking rice in an air fryer</h3>  
<p>If you’re cooking rice directly in the air fryer, use a heatproof dish and add a bit of extra water to prevent drying. Pre-cooked rice reheats beautifully in the air fryer—just spritz with water and heat at 160°C for 3-5 minutes.

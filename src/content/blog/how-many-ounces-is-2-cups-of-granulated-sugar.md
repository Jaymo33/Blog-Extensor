<p>2 cups of granulated sugar equals approximately 14.1 ounces (400 grams). This measurement is crucial for air fryer baking, where precision ensures perfect results every time. Whether you’re making cakes, cookies, or desserts, knowing the exact weight of your ingredients can make all the difference. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we’re all about helping you get the best from your air fryer with accurate conversions and tips.</p>

<h2>Why accurate sugar measurements matter in air fryer baking</h2>
<p>Baking in an air fryer requires precision, especially when it comes to sugar. Too much or too little can affect texture, browning, and even cooking time. Granulated sugar, being a dry ingredient, needs to be measured correctly to avoid dense or overly sweet results. For example, if you’re making <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer cookies</a>, 14.1 ounces of sugar will give you the ideal balance of crispness and sweetness. Always use a kitchen scale for the most accurate results, as cup measurements can vary slightly.</p>

<p>Many air fryer recipes, like those found in our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>cake category</a>, rely on precise sugar measurements for consistency. A slight deviation can lead to undercooked or overly browned treats. If you’re converting from cups to ounces, remember that granulated sugar weighs about 7.05 ounces per cup. This makes 2 cups equal to 14.1 ounces, a handy figure to keep in mind for all your baking needs.</p>

<h3>How to measure 2 cups of granulated sugar correctly</h3>
<p>To measure 2 cups of granulated sugar accurately, use the spoon-and-level method. Spoon the sugar into your measuring cup without packing it down, then level it off with a straight edge. This ensures you’re not adding extra sugar by mistake. For even better accuracy, weigh it on a kitchen scale—14.1 ounces is your target. If you’re scaling a recipe up or down, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a> can help you adjust measurements effortlessly.</p>

<h2>Common air fryer recipes using 2 cups of granulated sugar</h2>
<p>Many popular air fryer recipes call for around 2 cups of granulated sugar. Classic <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cookies>cookies</a>, for instance, often require this amount to achieve the perfect sweetness and texture. Cakes and muffins also frequently use 2 cups of sugar, especially larger batches designed for family servings. If you’re experimenting with desserts like air fryer brownies or blondies, this measurement is a great starting point.</p>

<p>For those who love baking, knowing that 2 cups of granulated sugar equals 14.1 ounces simplifies recipe adjustments.

<h3>Converting other sugar types to ounces</h3>
<p>While granulated sugar is the most common, other types like brown or powdered sugar have different weights.

Always check your recipe for the specific type of sugar required, as substitutions can alter the outcome.

<p>Air fryers rely on even heat distribution, so ingredient quantities must be spot-on. Too much or too little chilli sauce can alter the texture and flavour of your dish.

<h2>Common uses for 2 tbsp of chilli sauce in air fryer recipes</h2>  
<p>This quantity is ideal for glazes, marinades, or dips. For instance, mix 30g of chilli sauce with honey for sticky wings or stir it into mayo for a spicy dip. The balanced heat of 2 tbsp (30g) enhances flavour without overpowering. Discover more ideas in our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetables section</a>.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on even cooking, and incorrect ingredient quantities can lead to uneven textures or undercooked food. Mozzarella cheese, in particular, melts at a specific rate, so using the right amount—170 grams for 1.5 cups—ensures perfect meltiness without excess oil. If you’re prepping a <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken dish</a> or a veggie bake, precise cheese measurements help balance flavours and textures. Plus, it saves you from guessing and wasting ingredients.</p>  

<p>Different brands of mozzarella cheese may vary slightly in density, but 170 grams is a reliable standard for shredded or grated cheese. For block mozzarella, you might need to adjust slightly based on how finely you grate it. Always use a kitchen scale for the most accurate results, especially when following recipes from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure Mozzarella Cheese Without a Scale</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a scale, lightly pack the mozzarella cheese into a measuring cup to reach 1.5 cups (170 grams). Avoid pressing too hard, as this can compact the cheese and throw off the measurement. For recipes like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/potatoes>potato gratin</a>, evenly distributing the cheese ensures every bite is delicious. Remember, 1.5 cups of mozzarella cheese in grams is a handy conversion to keep bookmarked.</p>  

<h2>Converting Mozzarella Cheese for UK vs. US Recipes</h2>  
<p>While 1.5 cups of mozzarella cheese equals 170 grams in most cases, slight variations exist between UK and US cup measurements. UK cups are typically 250ml, while US cups are 240ml, but the difference is minimal for cheese. If you’re adapting a <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe</a> from another country, sticking to grams eliminates confusion. This is especially useful for air fryer cooking, where precision matters.</p>  

<p>For block mozzarella, 1.5 cups shredded usually weighs around 170 grams, but if you’re using fresh mozzarella (like in a caprese salad), the water content changes the weight. Always drain excess liquid before measuring. Need to clean your air fryer after a cheesy recipe?

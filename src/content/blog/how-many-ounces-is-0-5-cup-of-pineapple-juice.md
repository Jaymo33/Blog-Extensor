<p>0.5 cup of pineapple juice equals 4 fluid ounces (oz). This measurement is essential for precise cooking, especially when preparing air fryer recipes that require exact liquid quantities. Whether you're marinating chicken or creating a glaze, knowing how to convert 0.5 cup of pineapple juice to ounces ensures consistent results every time.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on precise measurements to deliver perfectly cooked meals. Too much or too little liquid, like pineapple juice, can affect texture and flavour. For example, marinating chicken with 0.5 cup of pineapple juice (4 oz) helps tenderise the meat while adding a sweet tang. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more handy measurement tips.</p>  

<p>Using the correct amount of pineapple juice ensures your recipes aren’t overly soggy or dry. If you're making a glaze or sauce, 0.5 cup (4 oz) of pineapple juice balances acidity and sweetness. Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> for inspiration on how to use pineapple juice in delicious dishes.</p>  

<h3>How to measure 0.5 cup of pineapple juice accurately</h3>  
<p>To measure 0.5 cup of pineapple juice, use a liquid measuring cup for the most precise results. Fill it to the 4 oz mark, which is equivalent to half a standard cup. For smaller quantities, a kitchen scale set to ounces can also work. This method is especially useful for recipes requiring exact liquid measurements.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for 0.5 cup of pineapple juice in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Pineapple juice is a versatile ingredient in air fryer recipes. A 0.5 cup (4 oz) portion works well in marinades for chicken, pork, or shrimp, adding moisture and flavour. It’s also great for glazing roasted vegetables or creating sticky sauces for ribs. Browse our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipes</a> for ideas on incorporating pineapple juice.</p>  

<p>Another popular use for 0.5 cup of pineapple juice is in dessert recipes. It adds natural sweetness to cakes or can be reduced into a syrup for drizzling.

<h3>Converting 0.5 cup of pineapple juice to other measurements</h3>  
<p>If you need to convert 0.5 cup of pineapple juice to other units, remember it’s equal to 4 fluid ounces, 118 millilitres, or 8 tablespoons. These conversions are handy when scaling recipes up or down. Always double-check measurements to avoid cooking mishaps.</p>  

<h2>Tips for storing pineapple juice for air fryer recipes</h2>  
<p>Once opened, pineapple juice should be refrigerated and used within 5-7 days. If you only need 0.5 cup (4 oz) for a recipe, consider freezing the rest in ice cube trays for future use. This prevents waste and ensures you always have pineapple juice on hand for quick air fryer meals.</p>

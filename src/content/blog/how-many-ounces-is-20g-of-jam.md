<p>20 grams of jam equals approximately 0.71 ounces. This conversion is handy when following air fryer recipes that require precise measurements, especially for sticky ingredients like jam. Whether you're making pastries, glazes, or sauces, knowing how to convert grams to ounces ensures your dish turns out perfectly every time. For more air fryer measurement tips, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on precise cooking times and temperatures, so accurate ingredient measurements are crucial. Using too much or too little jam can affect the texture and flavour of your dish. For example, adding extra jam to a glaze might make it overly sweet or sticky, while too little could leave your dish lacking flavour. If you're new to air frying, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a> offers plenty of inspiration with measured ingredients.</p>  

<p>Jam is a common ingredient in air fryer desserts and glazes, from jam-filled doughnuts to sticky chicken wings. Measuring 20g of jam correctly ensures consistency, whether you're baking or cooking. A digital kitchen scale is the best tool for this, but if you don’t have one, our conversion guide will help. For more tips on handling sticky ingredients, visit our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning guide</a> to keep your air fryer in top condition.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure 20g of Jam Without a Scale</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a scale, you can use tablespoons to measure 20g of jam. One tablespoon of jam is roughly 20g, but this can vary depending on the jam's thickness. For a more accurate measure, use a measuring spoon and level it off. This method works well for recipes where precision isn’t critical, like spreading jam on toast or mixing it into batters.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for 20g of Jam in Air Fryer Recipes</h2>  
<p>20g of jam is just the right amount for many air fryer recipes. It’s perfect for glazing pastries, filling thumbprint cookies, or adding a sweet touch to marinades. For example, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert recipes</a> often call for small amounts of jam to enhance flavour without overpowering the dish. Whether you're making jam tarts or glazed chicken, 20g is a versatile measurement.</p>  

<p>Another great use for 20g of jam is in air fryer sauces. Mix it with mustard or vinegar for a quick glaze, or swirl it into yogurt for a fruity dip. The key is balancing the jam’s sweetness with other ingredients. If you're experimenting, start with 20g and adjust to taste. For more creative ideas, browse our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/breakfast>breakfast recipes</a> featuring jam as a key ingredient.</p>  

<h3>Converting Other Jam Measurements</h3>  
<p>If your recipe calls for a different amount of jam, here’s a quick reference: 50g equals about 1.76 ounces, and 100g is roughly 3.53 ounces. These conversions are useful when scaling recipes up or down. Remember, thicker jams like marmalade may weigh slightly more than runny ones, so adjust accordingly.

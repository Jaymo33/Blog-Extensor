<p>1 cup of butter equals 8 ounces (or 227 grams). This measurement is standard in both UK and US baking, making it easy to follow recipes for your air fryer or oven. Whether you're whipping up cookies, cakes, or savoury dishes, knowing this conversion ensures accuracy and delicious results.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate butter measurements matter</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of butter is crucial for texture and flavour in your cooking. Too much butter can make baked goods greasy, while too little might leave them dry. For air fryer recipes, precise measurements help avoid uneven cooking or excess oil splatter. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more handy tips.</p>  

<p>Butter is often sold in blocks or sticks, and knowing how many ounces are in 1 cup simplifies prep work. If you're adapting a recipe from grams to ounces or vice versa, this conversion is a lifesaver. For more inspiration, browse our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> collection.</p>  

<h3>Measuring butter without scales</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a kitchen scale, use the markings on butter packaging. A standard UK block of butter is 250g, just slightly over 1 cup (8 ounces). For smaller amounts, tablespoons work too—1 ounce of butter is roughly 2 tablespoons. Keep your air fryer in top shape with our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning guide</a>.</p>  

<h2>Common butter conversions for air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Here’s a quick reference for butter measurements in ounces and cups:</p>  
<ul>  
<li>1/4 cup butter = 2 ounces</li>  
<li>1/2 cup butter = 4 ounces</li>  
<li>1 cup butter = 8 ounces</li>  
<li>2 cups butter = 16 ounces (1 pound)</li>  
</ul>  

<p>These conversions are handy when scaling recipes up or down. For savoury dishes like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>air fryer chicken</a>, butter measurements ensure crispy, golden results. Sweet treats like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cookies>air fryer cookies</a> also rely on precise butter quantities.</p>  

<h3>Does butter type affect weight?</h3>  
<p>Salted, unsalted, or whipped butter all weigh roughly the same per cup. However, whipped butter has more air, so it’s less dense. For accurate results, stick to standard block butter in recipes. If using spreads, check labels for oil content, as this can alter measurements.</p>

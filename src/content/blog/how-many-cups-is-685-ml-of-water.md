<p>685 ml of water is approximately 2.89 cups in the UK or 2.9 cups in the US. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements can make or break your dish. Whether you’re baking a cake or preparing a sauce, knowing how to convert millilitres to cups ensures consistency. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we focus on helping you get the measurements right for perfect results every time.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>
<p>Using the correct amount of water in air fryer recipes is crucial for texture and taste. Too much water can make dishes soggy, while too little can lead to dryness. For example, when making air fryer cakes or steamed buns, 685 ml of water (or 2.89 cups) ensures the batter has the right consistency. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for other common measurements.</p>
<p>Precision is also key when reheating or cooking frozen foods in the air fryer. A slight variation in liquid measurements can affect cooking times and results. Whether you’re preparing a <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken dish</a> or a vegetable stir-fry, knowing how many cups 685 ml of water equals helps you stay on track.</p>

<h2>UK vs. US Cup Measurements</h2>
<p>It’s important to note that cup measurements differ slightly between the UK and the US. In the UK, 1 cup equals 284 ml, while in the US, it’s 240 ml. This means 685 ml of water converts to 2.89 UK cups or 2.9 US cups. For air fryer recipes, this small difference can matter, especially in baking.</p>
<p>If you’re following a recipe from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>our collection</a>, always check whether it uses UK or US measurements. This ensures your dishes turn out as intended, whether you’re making desserts or savoury meals.</p>

<h3>How to Measure 685 ml of Water Without a Measuring Cup</h3>
<p>If you don’t have a measuring cup, you can use a kitchen scale to measure 685 ml of water. Since 1 ml of water weighs 1 gram, 685 ml equals 685 grams. Alternatively, use a standard mug, but keep in mind that mugs vary in size. For accuracy, refer to our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a>.</p>

<h3>Common Recipes Using 685 ml of Water</h3>
<p>Many air fryer recipes, such as steamed puddings or broths, call for around 685 ml of water. For example, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert recipes</a> often use this measurement for syrups or custards. Knowing the cup equivalent helps you adapt recipes quickly and confidently.</p>

<h2>Tips for Measuring Liquids in an Air Fryer</h2>
<p>When measuring water for air fryer recipes, always use a clear measuring jug for accuracy. Pour slowly to avoid spills, especially when working with hot liquids. For sticky mixtures like sauces, lightly grease the measuring cup to ensure all the liquid pours out evenly.</p>

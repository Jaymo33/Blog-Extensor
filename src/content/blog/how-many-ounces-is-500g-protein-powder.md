<p>500g of protein powder equals approximately 17.64 ounces. This conversion is essential for anyone using protein powder in recipes, meal prep, or even air fryer cooking. Whether you're baking protein bars or adding powder to smoothies, knowing the exact weight ensures consistency and perfect results every time.</p>

<h2>Why Convert 500g of Protein Powder to Ounces?</h2>  
<p>Understanding how many ounces are in 500g of protein powder helps with portion control and recipe accuracy. Many UK recipes, especially those on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, use grams, but some kitchen scales or international recipes might require ounces. Converting 500g to ounces ensures you’re using the right amount, whether you’re meal prepping or experimenting with protein-packed air fryer treats.</p>  

<p>Protein powder is a staple for fitness lovers and home cooks alike. From shakes to baked goods, getting the measurements right is crucial. If you’re using an air fryer for protein cookies or muffins, precise measurements like 500g to ounces can make or break your recipe. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more handy tips.</p>  

<h2>How to Measure 500g of Protein Powder Accurately</h2>  
<p>To measure 500g of protein powder in ounces, you’ll need a reliable kitchen scale. Digital scales with both gram and ounce settings are ideal. Simply scoop your protein powder into a bowl on the scale until it hits 500g, then switch the unit to ounces to see the conversion. This method eliminates guesswork and ensures precision.</p>  

<p>If you don’t have a scale, you can use volume measurements, but these are less accurate. Protein powder can vary in density, so 500g might not always fill the same cup size. For best results, stick to weighing. For more air fryer-friendly recipes using precise measurements, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipes section</a>.</p>

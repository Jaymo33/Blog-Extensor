<p>1.25 cups of pumpkin seeds equals approximately 5.5 ounces (or 156 grams). This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes, ensuring accurate measurements for perfect results every time. Whether you’re roasting pumpkin seeds for a snack or using them in a dish, knowing the weight helps maintain consistency. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we focus on precise measurements to elevate your cooking.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on even heat distribution, so using the right amount of ingredients ensures everything cooks uniformly. Too many pumpkin seeds can overcrowd the basket, leading to uneven roasting. Conversely, too few might burn quickly. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> simplifies these calculations, taking the guesswork out of cooking.</p>  

<p>Pumpkin seeds are a versatile ingredient, perfect for snacks, salads, or even as a crunchy topping. Whether you’re following a recipe from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>our collection</a> or experimenting, knowing the exact weight ensures success. For example, 1.25 cups of pumpkin seeds (5.5 oz) roasted at 180°C for 10 minutes yields perfectly crispy results.</p>  

<h3>How to measure pumpkin seeds correctly</h3>  
<p>For the most accurate measurement, use a kitchen scale. However, if you only have measuring cups, lightly spoon the seeds into the cup without packing them down. This prevents over-measuring, which can affect cooking times. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/snacks>snack recipes</a> for creative ways to use pumpkin seeds in your air fryer.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for pumpkin seeds in air fryers</h2>  
<p>Pumpkin seeds are a nutritious addition to many dishes. Roasting them in the air fryer enhances their natural crunch and flavour. Try sprinkling them over soups, salads, or even blending them into pesto. For inspiration, browse our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable recipes</a>, where pumpkin seeds add texture and protein.</p>  

<p>Another great way to use 1.25 cups (5.5 oz) of pumpkin seeds is in homemade granola or energy bars. The air fryer toasts them evenly, locking in nutrients and flavour. If you’re new to air frying, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning guide</a> ensures your appliance stays in top condition for every recipe.</p>  

<h3>Storing pumpkin seeds for freshness</h3>  
<p>Once measured and roasted, store pumpkin seeds in an airtight container to maintain crispness. They’ll stay fresh for weeks, ready to elevate any meal. For more storage tips and recipe ideas, visit <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>.</p>

    "@type": "Answer",
    "text": "Air fryers concentrate flavours during cooking, so recipes typically use less liquid than conventional oven recipes. The 0.5 tbsp (7.5g) measurement prevents over-saturation while still providing enough acidity for marinades or dressings to work effectively in the air fryer's rapid cooking environment."

    "text": "If you don't have a 0.5 tbsp measure, use 1.5 teaspoons (as 1 tbsp = 3 tsp). Alternatively, weigh out 7.5 grams on a kitchen scale. For small amounts like this, investing in a set of measuring spoons that includes half tablespoons makes air fryer recipe preparation much easier."

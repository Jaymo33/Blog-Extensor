<p>760 ml of condensed milk is approximately 3.2 cups. This conversion is essential for baking and cooking, especially when using an air fryer for recipes that require precise measurements. Whether you're making a dessert or a savoury dish, knowing the exact cup equivalent ensures consistency and great results.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of condensed milk can make or break your recipe. Too little, and your dish might lack sweetness or creaminess. Too much, and it could become overly dense or sticky. For air fryer recipes, precise measurements ensure even cooking and perfect texture. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more handy measurement tips.</p>  

<p>Condensed milk is a staple in many desserts, from fudge to cheesecakes. If you're adapting a recipe for your air fryer, knowing how to convert 760 ml to cups is crucial. Our guide simplifies this process, so you can focus on creating delicious meals without the guesswork.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure 760 ml of Condensed Milk</h3>  
<p>Measuring condensed milk can be tricky due to its thick consistency. For 760 ml, use a liquid measuring cup and fill it to the 3-cup mark, then add an additional 1/5 cup (or roughly 2 tablespoons) to reach 3.2 cups. Alternatively, weigh it—760 ml of condensed milk weighs about 800 grams.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for 760 ml of Condensed Milk</h2>  
<p>This quantity is often found in large-batch recipes, such as cakes, pies, or ice cream. If you're using an air fryer, condensed milk works wonderfully in <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert recipes</a> like caramel flan or sticky toffee pudding. Its rich, sweet flavour enhances both texture and taste.</p>  

<p>You can also use 760 ml of condensed milk in savoury dishes, like marinades or glazes for meats. The air fryer’s high heat caramelises the sugars, creating a delicious crust. For more inspiration, browse our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a>.</p>  

<h3>Converting Other Condensed Milk Measurements</h3>  
<p>If your recipe calls for a different amount, here’s a quick reference: 1 cup = 237 ml, so 380 ml is roughly 1.6 cups, and 950 ml is about 4 cups. Keep these conversions handy for seamless baking and air frying.</p>  

<h2>Tips for Working with Condensed Milk</h2>  
<p>To avoid mess, lightly grease your measuring cup before pouring condensed milk—it’ll slide out easily. If you’re using a can, transfer leftovers to an airtight container and refrigerate. For cleaning sticky residue from your air fryer, try our recommended <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner</a>.</p>  

<p>Condensed milk can also be substituted with evaporated milk and sugar, but the texture will differ. For best results in air fryer recipes, stick to the original measurement of 760 ml (3.2 cups) unless experimenting.</p>  

<h3>Storing Leftover Condensed Milk</h3>  
<p>If you don’t use all 760 ml, transfer the remainder to a sealed container and refrigerate for up to two weeks. You can also freeze it for longer storage—just thaw and stir before using in your next <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>cake or dessert</a>.</p>

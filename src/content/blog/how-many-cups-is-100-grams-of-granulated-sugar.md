<h2>Why Accurate Sugar Measurements Matter</h2>
<p>Getting the right amount of granulated sugar is crucial for baking success. Too much sugar can make your dessert overly sweet or cause it to brown too quickly in the air fryer. Too little, and your cake might turn out dry or lack flavour. Measuring 100 grams of granulated sugar accurately ensures consistency, whether you're making cookies, cakes, or even sweetening your morning porridge.

<p>Granulated sugar is a staple in many recipes, from classic Victoria sponge to American-style chocolate chip cookies. If you're using an air fryer for baking, precise measurements help avoid undercooked or burnt results. A digital kitchen scale is the most accurate tool, but if you only have measuring cups, knowing that 100 grams of granulated sugar equals roughly ½ cup is a game-changer.

<h3>How to Measure 100 Grams of Granulated Sugar Without a Scale</h3>
<p>If you don’t have a scale, use the spoon-and-level method for accuracy. Lightly spoon granulated sugar into a measuring cup until it’s heaped, then level it off with a straight edge. Avoid packing the sugar down, as this can lead to over-measuring. Remember, 100 grams of granulated sugar is about ½ cup, but slight variations can occur depending on how tightly it’s packed.

<h2>Differences Between UK and US Cup Measurements</h2>
<p>It’s worth noting that UK and US cup measurements differ slightly. In the UK, a standard cup holds 250ml, while in the US, it’s 240ml. This small variation can affect your baking, especially when converting 100 grams of granulated sugar to cups. For air fryer recipes, sticking to one measurement system avoids confusion. If you’re using an American recipe, 100 grams of granulated sugar will still be close to ½ cup, but always double-check for precision.</p>

<p>Many air fryer recipes, like those found on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>our dessert category</a>, rely on accurate sugar measurements for perfect texture and sweetness. Whether you’re making a sticky toffee pudding or a simple sponge, knowing how many cups 100 grams of granulated sugar equals ensures consistent results. Keep this conversion handy for stress-free baking.</p>

<h3>Common Mistakes When Measuring Granulated Sugar</h3>
<p>One common mistake is scooping sugar directly from the bag with a measuring cup, which compacts it and leads to excess. Another is using a heaped cup instead of a level one, adding unnecessary sweetness to your dish. For 100 grams of granulated sugar, always aim for a precise ½ cup to avoid these pitfalls. Clean your air fryer basket after baking with our recommended <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner</a> to maintain hygiene.</p>

<h2>Converting Other Sugar Types</h2>
<p>While this guide focuses on granulated sugar, other types like caster or brown sugar have different densities. For example, 100 grams of caster sugar may measure slightly more than ½ cup due to its finer texture. Always refer to specific conversion charts if you’re substituting sugar types in air fryer recipes. Whether you’re baking or cooking, accurate measurements make all the difference.</p>

<p>Granulated sugar is versatile, but knowing how many cups 100 grams equals helps streamline your cooking process. From air fryer desserts to sweet glazes, this conversion is a kitchen essential.

<p>300 grams of cream is approximately 1.27 cups. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements can make or break your dish. Whether you’re whipping up a creamy dessert or a savoury sauce, knowing how many cups 300 grams of cream equals ensures perfect results every time.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>
<p>Using the right amount of cream is crucial for air fryer recipes. Too much can make dishes soggy, while too little might leave them dry. For example, a creamy pasta bake or a rich dessert like cheesecake relies on the correct ratio of ingredients. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we emphasise precision to help you achieve restaurant-quality results at home.</p>
<p>Converting 300 grams of cream to cups is straightforward once you know the density. Cream’s thickness means it doesn’t pack the same way as flour or sugar, so volume measurements can vary. Always use a kitchen scale for grams if possible, but if you’re using cups, our conversion ensures you’re spot-on.</p>

<h2>How to Measure 300 Grams of Cream Without a Scale</h2>
<p>Don’t have a kitchen scale? No problem. You can still measure 300 grams of cream using standard cups. One cup of cream typically weighs around 240 grams, so 300 grams is just over 1 1/4 cups. For best results, use a liquid measuring cup and fill it to the 1.27-cup mark for accuracy.</p>
<p>If you’re adapting a recipe from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>our collection</a>, this conversion ensures your dish turns out perfectly. Whether it’s a creamy garlic sauce for chicken or a decadent chocolate mousse, precise measurements are key. Remember, air fryers cook quickly, so ingredient ratios matter more than ever.</p>

<h3>UK vs. US Cup Measurements</h3>
<p>It’s worth noting that UK and US cup measurements differ slightly. A UK cup is 284 ml, while a US cup is 240 ml. For 300 grams of cream, this means 1.27 US cups or roughly 1.06 UK cups. Always check which standard your recipe uses to avoid confusion.</p>

<p>1.5 cups of plain yogurt equals approximately 12 ounces (340 grams). This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes, ensuring your dishes turn out perfectly every time. Whether you’re making dips, marinades, or baked goods, knowing the exact weight helps maintain consistency. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we focus on precise measurements to elevate your cooking. Let’s dive deeper into why this conversion matters.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate yogurt measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of yogurt ensures your air fryer recipes have the perfect texture and moisture. Too much yogurt can make dishes soggy, while too little may dry them out. For example, a marinade with 1.5 cups of plain yogurt (12 ounces) coats chicken evenly for juicy results. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer chicken recipes</a> for inspiration. Precision is key, especially when adapting traditional oven recipes for the air fryer.</p>  

<p>Yogurt also acts as a tenderiser in meats, so measuring 1.5 cups correctly (12 ounces) ensures even marination. If you’re meal prepping, this conversion helps batch cooking. Visit our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/meal-prep>meal prep section</a> for yogurt-based marinades. Whether you’re cooking for one or a family, accuracy saves time and reduces waste.</p>  

<h3>How to measure 1.5 cups of plain yogurt without scales</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a kitchen scale, use liquid measuring cups for yogurt. Spoon the yogurt into the cup and level it off for an accurate 1.5 cups (12 ounces). Avoid compacting it, as this skews the measurement. For sticky yogurts, lightly grease the measuring cup first. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a> simplifies other common measurements too.</p>  

<h2>Converting 1.5 cups of plain yogurt in UK vs. US measurements</h2>  
<p>In the UK, 1.5 cups of plain yogurt is still roughly 12 ounces, but metric users may prefer grams (340g). Most UK air fryer recipes list both, so check labels if adapting American recipes. For more conversions, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion guide</a>. This ensures your yogurt-based dishes, like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>air fryer desserts</a>, turn out flawless.</p>  

<p>Note that cup sizes can vary slightly by brand, so for baking, weigh yogurt when possible. A 1.5-cup (12-ounce) yogurt measurement works for cakes, muffins, and even frozen yogurt bites.

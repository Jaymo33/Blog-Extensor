<p>Different oils have varying densities, but vegetable oil is a common choice for its neutral flavour and high smoke point. Measuring 685 ml accurately ensures consistency across recipes, whether you're making chips, chicken, or cakes. A kitchen scale can help, but cup measurements are convenient for quick prep.

<h3>UK vs. US Cup Measurements</h3>  
<p>In the UK, 1 cup equals 284 ml, while in the US, it's 240 ml. This means 685 ml of vegetable oil converts to roughly 2.89 UK cups or 2.9 US cups. Always check your recipe's origin to avoid confusion. Most air fryer recipes on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> use UK measurements for local convenience.</p>  

<h2>How to Measure 685 ml of Vegetable Oil Without a Scale</h2>

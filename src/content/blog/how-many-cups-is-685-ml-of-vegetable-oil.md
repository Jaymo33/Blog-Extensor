<p>685 ml of vegetable oil equals approximately 2.89 cups in the UK or 2.9 cups in the US. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes, ensuring accuracy for crispy, delicious results. Whether you're baking or frying, getting the measurement right makes all the difference. For more handy conversions, visit <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>our air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Using the correct amount of vegetable oil ensures your air fryer dishes turn out perfectly crispy without being greasy. Too much oil can lead to soggy results, while too little may leave food dry. Air fryers are designed to circulate hot air efficiently, so precise oil measurements enhance their performance. For example, 685 ml of vegetable oil (2.9 cups) is ideal for batch cooking or larger recipes. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a> for inspiration.</p>  

<p>Different oils have varying densities, but vegetable oil is a common choice for its neutral flavour and high smoke point. Measuring 685 ml accurately ensures consistency across recipes, whether you're making chips, chicken, or cakes. A kitchen scale can help, but cup measurements are convenient for quick prep. For more tips, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipes</a>.</p>  

<h3>UK vs. US Cup Measurements</h3>  
<p>In the UK, 1 cup equals 284 ml, while in the US, it's 240 ml. This means 685 ml of vegetable oil converts to roughly 2.89 UK cups or 2.9 US cups. Always check your recipe's origin to avoid confusion. Most air fryer recipes on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> use UK measurements for local convenience.</p>  

<h2>How to Measure 685 ml of Vegetable Oil Without a Scale</h2>  
<p>If you don’t have a measuring jug, use standard tablespoons: 1 UK tablespoon holds 15 ml, so 685 ml is about 46 tablespoons. For US tablespoons (14.8 ml), it’s roughly 46.3. This method works in a pinch but isn’t as precise as cups or scales. For best results, invest in a good measuring set, especially if you love <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert recipes</a>.</p>  

<p>Another trick is to repurpose a clean 500 ml bottle and mark the 685 ml level. This is handy for bulk cooking or meal prep. Remember, air fryers require less oil than traditional frying, so 685 ml goes further than you’d think. Need cleaning tips?

<h3>Common Recipes Using 685 ml of Vegetable Oil</h3>  
<p>This quantity is perfect for large batches of fried chicken, doughnuts, or tempura. In an air fryer, you’ll use far less oil—just a light coating—so 685 ml can last multiple cooks. For smaller servings, halve the measurement to 1.45 cups (342.5 ml). Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/potatoes>potato recipes</a> for ideas.</p>

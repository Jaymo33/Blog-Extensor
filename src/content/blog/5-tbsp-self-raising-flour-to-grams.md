<h2>Why accurate flour measurements matter</h2>  
<p>Baking is a science, and even small deviations in flour quantities can affect texture and rise. Self-raising flour contains baking powder, so incorrect measurements may lead to dense or overly puffed results. In air fryer cooking, where heat distribution is rapid, precision is even more critical. Too much flour can dry out your dish, while too little may cause it to collapse.

<p>Many UK bakers rely on tablespoons for small quantities, but grams offer better accuracy. Digital scales eliminate the variability of scooping techniques, ensuring your air fryer cakes turn out light and fluffy every time.

<h3>How to measure 5 tbsp of self-raising flour</h3>  
<p>For consistent results, spoon the flour into the tablespoon and level it off with a knife. Avoid packing or tapping the spoon, as this compacts the flour and skews the weight. If using scales, tare the bowl first, then add flour until it reaches 45 grams. This method works perfectly for air fryer recipes like scones or batter-based dishes.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for 5 tbsp of self-raising flour</h2>  
<p>This quantity is ideal for small-batch baking, such as single-serving mug cakes or coating proteins like chicken or fish. In air fryers, a light dusting of flour helps achieve crispy textures without deep frying.

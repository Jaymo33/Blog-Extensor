<p>100g of condensed milk equals approximately 3.53 ounces. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes, baking, or any dish requiring precise measurements. Whether you're whipping up a dessert or adjusting a recipe, knowing how to convert grams to ounces ensures accuracy. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we make conversions simple so you can focus on cooking.</p>  

<h2>Why Convert 100g of Condensed Milk to Ounces?</h2>  
<p>Many UK recipes use grams, while others rely on ounces, especially older cookbooks or international guides. Converting 100g of condensed milk to ounces (3.53 oz) helps maintain consistency in your cooking. Air fryer recipes, like cakes or custards, often need exact measurements for the best results. If you're using an American recipe, this conversion ensures you don’t over or under-measure ingredients.</p>  

<p>Condensed milk is a staple in desserts, from fudge to banoffee pie. Knowing the weight in ounces makes it easier to scale recipes up or down. For more air fryer-friendly conversions, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure 100g of Condensed Milk Without Scales</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have scales, you can use volume measurements. Roughly 100g of condensed milk is about 5 tablespoons or ¼ cup plus 1 tablespoon. However, weighing is more accurate, especially for air fryer recipes where precision matters. For sticky ingredients like condensed milk, lightly greasing your measuring spoon helps it slide off easily.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for 100g of Condensed Milk in Air Fryer Recipes</h2>  
<p>Condensed milk adds richness to air fryer desserts like cheesecakes, cookies, or even dulce de leche. A 100g portion (3.53 oz) is perfect for small-batch recipes. Try it in our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer caramel drizzle</a> or as a sweetener for air-fried bananas. Its thick consistency also works well in no-bake treats.</p>  

<p>For savoury dishes, condensed milk can balance spices in marinades or glazes. If you’re experimenting, start with 100g (3.53 oz) and adjust to taste. Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert category</a> for more inspiration.</p>  

<h3>Tips for Storing Leftover Condensed Milk</h3>  
<p>Once opened, transfer unused condensed milk to an airtight container and refrigerate. It lasts up to two weeks. For longer storage, freeze portions in ice cube trays—each cube is roughly 25g (0.88 oz), so four cubes make 100g. Thaw in the fridge before using.</p>  

<h2>Converting Other Common Weights for Condensed Milk</h2>  
<p>Need to adjust your recipe? Here’s a quick reference: 50g = 1.76 oz, 200g = 7.05 oz, and 400g (a standard tin) = 14.11 oz. Bookmark our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a> for easy access. Remember, air fryer cooking thrives on precision, so measure carefully for perfect results every time.</p>

<p>Many home cooks underestimate the importance of converting cups to ounces, but it’s a game-changer for air fryer success.

Avoid packing it down, as this can lead to over-measuring. For thicker sauces like tartar, a spoon can help level off the top. This method will get you close to the 4-ounce mark, though a scale is always more precise.</p>

<p>285 ml of vinegar is approximately 1.2 cups in the UK or 1.19 cups in the US. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes that require precise liquid measurements. Whether you're marinating chicken or making a tangy glaze, getting the vinegar quantity right makes all the difference.</p>

<h2>Understanding Vinegar Measurements for Air Fryer Cooking</h2>
<p>When using vinegar in air fryer recipes, accuracy matters. Too much can overpower your dish, while too little might leave it lacking flavour. The 285 ml measurement often appears in recipes for pickling solutions, marinades, or salad dressings. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we recommend using measuring jugs with both metric and imperial markings for foolproof results.</p>
<p>For those converting between systems, remember that UK and US cup measurements differ slightly. The UK cup holds 284 ml, while the US cup is 240 ml. This means 285 ml of vinegar equals about 1.2 UK cups or 1.19 US cups. These small differences can affect recipes, especially when scaling up quantities for meal prep.</p>

<h2>Why 285 ml of Vinegar Matters in Air Fryer Recipes</h2>
<p>Many air fryer recipes call for 285 ml of vinegar because it's a common bottle size in the UK. This quantity works perfectly for creating balanced flavours in dishes like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>air fryer chicken</a> or vegetable marinades. The acidity helps tenderise proteins while adding that signature tang.</p>
<p>When converting 285 ml vinegar to cups, consider the recipe's origin. British recipes will use the UK cup (1.2 cups), while American ones use the US cup (1.19 cups). For most home cooking, this 0.01 cup difference won't be noticeable, but it's good practice to be precise with measurements.</p>

<h3>Tools for Accurate Vinegar Measurement</h3>
<p>Invest in quality measuring tools for consistent results. A glass liquid measuring cup with clear markings lets you see the 285 ml line easily. For smaller quantities, use measuring spoons - remembering that 15 ml equals 1 tablespoon.

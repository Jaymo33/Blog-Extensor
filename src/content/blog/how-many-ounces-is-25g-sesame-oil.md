<p>25g of sesame oil equals approximately 0.88 ounces. This conversion is essential for precise cooking, especially when using an air fryer where measurements can make or break a dish. Whether you're following a recipe from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> or experimenting with your own creations, knowing how to convert grams to ounces ensures consistency.</p>

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>
<p>Air fryers rely on precise cooking times and ingredient quantities to deliver crispy, evenly cooked results. Using too much or too little sesame oil can affect the texture and flavour of your dish. For example, a recipe calling for 25g of sesame oil (0.88 ounces) might be for a marinade or dressing, where balance is key. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for other common measurements.</p>
<p>Many UK recipes use grams, while others might list ounces, so having a reliable conversion handy saves time and hassle. If you're preparing a dish like sesame-glazed salmon or stir-fried vegetables, the right amount of sesame oil enhances the flavour without overpowering other ingredients. Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a> for more inspiration.</p>

<h2>How to measure 25g of sesame oil without scales</h2>
<p>If you don’t have a kitchen scale, you can still measure 25g of sesame oil (0.88 ounces) using tablespoons. One tablespoon of sesame oil weighs roughly 14g, so 25g is just under two tablespoons. This method isn’t as precise as using scales but works in a pinch. For best results, invest in a digital scale for accurate measurements.</p>
<p>Sesame oil is denser than water, so volume measurements like cups or millilitres aren’t ideal for converting to ounces. Stick to weight measurements for consistency, especially when air frying. If you're cooking a <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipe</a>, precise oil measurements help achieve that perfect crispiness.</p>

<h3>Common uses for 25g of sesame oil in air fryer recipes</h3>
<p>25g of sesame oil is often used in marinades, dressings, or as a finishing oil for air-fried dishes. Its rich, nutty flavour pairs well with Asian-inspired recipes, such as air-fried tofu or crispy prawns. You’ll find many of these dishes in our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/tofu>tofu category</a> or <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/shrimp>shrimp recipes</a>.</p>

<h2>Tips for storing and using sesame oil</h2>
<p>Sesame oil has a strong flavour, so a little goes a long way. Store it in a cool, dark place to preserve its quality. If your air fryer basket gets greasy after cooking with sesame oil, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning guide</a> can help keep it in top condition.</p>
<p>When substituting sesame oil in recipes, remember that 25g (0.88 ounces) is a small but impactful amount. Its high smoke point makes it great for air frying, but avoid overheating to prevent bitterness. For more tips on air fryer maintenance and usage, browse our expert guides.</p>

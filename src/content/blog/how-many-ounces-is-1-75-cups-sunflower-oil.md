<p>1.75 cups of sunflower oil equals approximately 14 ounces (or 14.2 oz to be precise). This conversion is essential for air fryer cooking, where precise measurements can make or break your dish. Whether you’re making crispy chips or a succulent roast, getting the oil quantity right ensures even cooking and perfect texture.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate oil measurements matter in air fryers</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on hot air circulation to cook food, and using the right amount of oil ensures crispiness without excess grease. Too much oil can lead to soggy results, while too little may leave your food dry. For 1.75 cups of sunflower oil, knowing it’s roughly 14 ounces helps you follow recipes accurately. If you’re experimenting with your own creations, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for other handy measurements.</p>  

<p>Sunflower oil is a popular choice for air frying due to its high smoke point and neutral flavour. Whether you’re making <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>crispy chicken</a> or roasted vegetables, measuring 1.75 cups (14 oz) ensures consistent results. If you’re unsure about conversions, a kitchen scale can be a game-changer for precision cooking.</p>  

<h3>How to measure sunflower oil without a scale</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a kitchen scale, use standard measuring cups for liquids. One cup of sunflower oil weighs about 8 ounces, so 1.75 cups would be 14 ounces. For UK cooks, note that fluid ounces and weight ounces are slightly different, but in this case, the difference is negligible. Always level off the oil in your measuring cup for accuracy.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for 1.75 cups of sunflower oil in air fryers</h2>  
<p>Many air fryer recipes call for oil to enhance texture and flavour. For example, 1.75 cups (14 oz) of sunflower oil is perfect for batch-frying <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/potatoes>potato wedges</a> or coating chicken wings. It’s also ideal for marinating meats or brushing onto vegetables before roasting. Remember, air fryers require less oil than traditional frying, so 14 ounces goes a long way.</p>  

<p>If you’re preparing multiple dishes, 1.75 cups of sunflower oil can cover several batches.

Proper care ensures your appliance stays in top condition for future recipes.</p>

When converting 159 C to Gas Mark, you're looking at Gas Mark 3 - the ideal setting for many baked goods and slow-cooked meals. This temperature works particularly well in air fryers for dishes that benefit from even, moderate heat without excessive browning.</p><p id="">At <a href="https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart" id="">airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we recommend keeping a conversion chart handy when switching between Celsius and Gas Mark measurements.

This temperature allows food to cook through evenly without burning the exterior - crucial for cakes, custards, and delicate pastries.

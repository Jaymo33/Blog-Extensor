    "@type": "Answer",
    "text": "No, 0.5 cup of lime juice weighs slightly more than water due to its density and dissolved solids. While 0.5 cup of water weighs about 4 oz (by volume), lime juice weighs approximately 4.2 oz by weight. For most air fryer recipes, this small difference won’t affect the outcome."

<p>0.5 cup of lime juice equals 4 fluid ounces (oz). This measurement is essential for air fryer recipes where precise liquid quantities can make or break your dish. Whether you’re marinating chicken or adding zest to a dessert, knowing this conversion ensures consistency.</p>

<h2>Why accurate lime juice measurements matter</h2>
<p>Using the right amount of lime juice is crucial in air fryer cooking. Too little can leave your dish bland, while too much might overpower other flavours. For example, a <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>marinade recipe</a> might call for 0.5 cup of lime juice to tenderise meat perfectly. Getting this measurement wrong could affect texture and taste.</p>
<p>Lime juice also plays a key role in balancing acidity in dishes. When preparing <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>air fryer chicken recipes</a>, the 4 oz from 0.5 cup helps create that perfect tangy flavour. This precision becomes even more important when scaling recipes up or down for different serving sizes.</p>

<h2>How to measure 0.5 cup of lime juice</h2>
<p>Measuring lime juice accurately is simple with the right tools. A liquid measuring cup is ideal for getting exactly 0.5 cup (4 oz) of lime juice. For smaller quantities, you might use tablespoons – 0.5 cup equals 8 tablespoons. Always measure at eye level for accuracy.</p>
<p>If you’re working with fresh limes, about 4-5 medium limes will yield 0.5 cup of juice. This can vary slightly depending on the lime’s size and juiciness. For consistent results in your <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>air fryer cooking</a>, consider using bottled lime juice when precise measurements are crucial.</p>

<h3>Converting 0.5 cup lime juice to other units</h3>
<p>Besides ounces, you might need to convert 0.5 cup of lime juice to other units. It’s equivalent to 118 millilitres (ml) or about 120 grams (g) by weight. These conversions come in handy when following international recipes or using digital kitchen scales.</p>

<h2>Using 0.5 cup lime juice in air fryer recipes</h2>
<p>Many delicious air fryer recipes use 0.5 cup of lime juice as a key ingredient. From zesty <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/shrimp>shrimp dishes</a> to tangy marinades, this quantity adds bright flavour without overwhelming. The acidity also helps tenderise proteins while cooking in the air fryer.</p>
<p>When substituting bottled lime juice for fresh, the 0.5 cup (4 oz) measurement remains the same. However, fresh lime juice often provides better flavour for dishes like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer fish tacos</a>. Always taste and adjust seasonings as needed after adding the lime juice.</p>

<h3>Storing leftover lime juice</h3>
<p>If you have leftover lime juice from your 0.5 cup measurement, proper storage maintains freshness. Transfer it to an airtight container and refrigerate for up to a week. For longer storage, freeze the juice in ice cube trays – each cube holds about 1 oz, making future measurements easy.</p>

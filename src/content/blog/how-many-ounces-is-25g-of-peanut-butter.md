<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on precise ingredient ratios to deliver perfectly cooked meals. Too much or too little peanut butter can alter texture and cooking times. For example, adding extra peanut butter to a cookie dough might make it too dense, while skimping could leave it dry. That’s why converting 25g of peanut butter to ounces (0.88 oz) is crucial for recipe success.

<p>Peanut butter’s thickness also affects measurements. Creamy varieties may settle differently in a measuring spoon compared to chunky versions. For best results, use a kitchen scale to weigh 25g accurately. If you don’t have one, remember that 0.88 ounces is roughly two level tablespoons. Need inspiration?

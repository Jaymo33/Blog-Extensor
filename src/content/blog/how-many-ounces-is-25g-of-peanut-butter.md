<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on precise ingredient ratios to deliver perfectly cooked meals. Too much or too little peanut butter can alter texture and cooking times. For example, adding extra peanut butter to a cookie dough might make it too dense, while skimping could leave it dry. That’s why converting 25g of peanut butter to ounces (0.88 oz) is crucial for recipe success. Explore more air fryer-friendly <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipes</a> to put this knowledge into practice.</p>  

<p>Peanut butter’s thickness also affects measurements. Creamy varieties may settle differently in a measuring spoon compared to chunky versions. For best results, use a kitchen scale to weigh 25g accurately. If you don’t have one, remember that 0.88 ounces is roughly two level tablespoons. Need inspiration? Try our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert recipes</a> featuring peanut butter.</p>  

<h3>How to measure peanut butter without a scale</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a scale, use the spoon-and-level method for sticky ingredients like peanut butter. Lightly grease your spoon to help it slide off easily. Fill it heaping, then level it with a knife for consistency. Two tablespoons of peanut butter roughly equate to 25g or 0.88 ounces.

<h2>Common uses for 25g of peanut butter in air fryer recipes</h2>  
<p>Peanut butter is versatile in air fryer cooking. A 25g portion works well in sauces, glazes, or baked goods like cookies or cakes. It adds richness without overpowering other flavours.

<p>When using peanut butter in marinades, 25g (0.88 oz) balances sweetness and saltiness perfectly. Combine it with soy sauce, garlic, and a splash of lime for a Thai-inspired glaze on chicken or tofu. Remember to clean your air fryer basket afterward—sticky residues need proper care.

<h3>Adjusting recipes for different peanut butter types</h3>  
<p>Natural peanut butter tends to be runnier, while commercial brands are thicker. If substituting, adjust liquids in your recipe slightly. For 25g of natural peanut butter, you might need a touch less oil or water elsewhere. Always taste and tweak as you go for the best results.</p>

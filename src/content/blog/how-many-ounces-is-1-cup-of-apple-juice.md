<p>1 cup of apple juice equals approximately 8.45 ounces. This measurement is standard for liquid ingredients like apple juice, making it easy to convert for recipes. Whether you’re using an air fryer or traditional oven, knowing this conversion ensures your dishes turn out perfectly every time.

<h2>Understanding liquid measurements</h2>  
<p>Liquid measurements can be tricky, especially when converting between cups and ounces. In the UK, 1 cup of apple juice is roughly 8.45 ounces, but this can vary slightly based on density and temperature. If you’re using an air fryer, precise measurements are key to achieving the right texture and flavour. For example, a marinade with too much liquid can make food soggy, while too little might dry it out. Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> for inspiration on how to use apple juice in your cooking.</p>  

<p>When measuring apple juice, always use a liquid measuring cup for accuracy. A standard UK cup holds 250 millilitres, which translates to 8.45 ounces. This is especially important for air fryer recipes, where even small measurement errors can affect cooking times and results. If you’re unsure, double-check with a kitchen scale or refer to our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a>.</p>  

<h3>Why accuracy matters in air fryer cooking</h3>  
<p>Air fryers rely on precise measurements to ensure even cooking and crispiness. Too much liquid, like apple juice, can create steam, which may prevent food from crisping up properly. On the other hand, too little liquid might result in dry or unevenly cooked dishes. For best results, measure your apple juice carefully and adjust other ingredients accordingly.

<h2>Common uses for apple juice in air fryer recipes</h2>  
<p>Apple juice isn’t just for drinking—it’s a versatile ingredient in air fryer cooking. From glazes for meats like chicken or pork to sweetening desserts, apple juice adds a subtle fruity flavour.

<h3>Converting other measurements for apple juice</h3>

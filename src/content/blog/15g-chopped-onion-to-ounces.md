<p>15g of chopped onion equals approximately 0.53 ounces. This conversion is handy when following air fryer recipes that list ingredients in grams but require ounces for measurement. Whether you’re whipping up a quick stir-fry or prepping veggies for crispy air-fried onions, knowing this conversion ensures accuracy.</p>

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air frying</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on precise ingredient quantities to deliver consistent results. Too much or too little onion can affect texture and cooking time. For example, overcrowding the basket with excess chopped onion may lead to uneven crisping. On the flip side, skimping on portions could leave your dish lacking flavour.</p>  
<p>Many UK recipes, especially those on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, provide measurements in grams, but some cooks prefer using ounces. Converting 15g of chopped onion to ounces (0.53 oz) helps bridge this gap. It’s also useful when scaling recipes up or down to suit your needs.</p>  

<h2>How to measure 15g of chopped onion</h2>  
<p>If you don’t have a digital scale, visual cues can help. Roughly, 15g of chopped onion fills about two tablespoons. This amount works well for most air fryer recipes, from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable sides</a> to meat seasonings. For finer accuracy, invest in a kitchen scale—they’re affordable and eliminate guesswork.</p>  

<h3>Common uses for 15g chopped onion</h3>  
<p>This small-but-mighty quantity adds depth to dishes without overpowering them. Try it in air-fried frittatas, stuffed mushrooms, or as a base for marinades. It’s also perfect for single-serving recipes, ensuring you don’t waste leftovers.

<h2>Converting other onion quantities</h2>  
<p>While 15g chopped onion equals 0.53 ounces, you might need larger amounts. For example, 30g is roughly 1.06 ounces, and 50g translates to 1.76 ounces. Bookmarking a reliable converter or keeping a cheat sheet in your kitchen saves time during meal prep.</p>  
<p>Remember, onion density can vary slightly based on chop size. Finely diced onions pack more tightly than roughly chopped ones, so adjust measurements if precision is crucial. For bulk prepping, consider our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/meal-prep>meal prep guides</a> to streamline cooking.</p>  

<h3>Tips for storing chopped onions</h3>  
<p>Pre-chopped onions oxidise quickly, so store unused portions in an airtight container for up to three days. Alternatively, freeze 15g portions in ice cube trays for future air fryer recipes. This trick works brilliantly for last-minute additions to soups or casseroles.</p>  

<h2>Scaling recipes with 15g chopped onion</h2>  
<p>When doubling or halving recipes, maintain the 15g-to-0.53-ounce ratio for consistency. For instance, if a dish calls for 45g onion (1.59 ounces), you’d use three 15g portions. This method simplifies adjustments without recalculating each time.</p>

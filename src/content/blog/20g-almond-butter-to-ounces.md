<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on even heat distribution, so ingredient quantities must be spot-on. Too much almond butter can make recipes greasy, while too little might leave them dry.

<p>Almond butter’s density means volume measures (like tablespoons) can vary, making weight more reliable. A kitchen scale is your best friend here—simply tare your bowl, add 20g, and you’re good to go. For sticky ingredients like almond butter, lightly oiling your spoon helps with clean measuring.

<h3>How to measure 20g of almond butter without scales</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have scales, two level tablespoons of almond butter roughly equal 20g (0.71 oz). Pack it tightly and scrape off the excess for accuracy. This method works well for sauces or marinades in air fryer dishes like glazed chicken or tofu. For sticky ingredients, a silicone spatula ensures you get every last bit—handy for <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/meal-prep>meal prep</a>.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for 20g of almond butter in air fryer recipes</h2>

<h3>Storing almond butter for air fryer recipes</h3>  
<p>To keep almond butter fresh, store it upside down in a cool cupboard—this helps redistribute oils. If separation occurs, a quick stir restores its smooth texture, ensuring your 20g (0.71 oz) measures are consistent. For longer storage, refrigerate and let it soften slightly before use.</p>

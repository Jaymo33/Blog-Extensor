<p>230 C in a fan oven is equivalent to approximately 210 C with the fan setting on. This conversion accounts for the more efficient heat distribution in fan-assisted ovens, which cook food faster and more evenly than conventional ovens. When using an air fryer, which operates similarly to a fan oven, you'll often find recipes calling for 230 C that need slight adjustment for optimal results.</p>

<h2>Understanding Fan Oven Temperatures</h2>
<p>Fan ovens circulate hot air around the food using a built-in fan, creating a convection effect that speeds up cooking. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we recommend reducing temperatures by about 20 degrees when converting from conventional to fan settings. So 230 C becomes 210 C in a fan oven - a crucial adjustment for perfect baking and roasting.</p>
<p>This temperature conversion works particularly well for items like roasted vegetables from our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetables recipe category</a>. The circulating air ensures even cooking without the need to rotate trays, making 230 C (210 C fan) ideal for achieving crispy exteriors and tender interiors. Many air fryer models actually mimic fan oven technology, so these conversions apply perfectly to countertop cooking too.</p>

<h2>When to Use 230 C in Fan Cooking</h2>
<p>The 230 C to fan oven conversion is most commonly used for roasting meats and vegetables, baking pizzas, and creating crispy textures. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a> features numerous dishes that benefit from this high-heat approach, especially when you want that perfect golden-brown finish.</p>
<h3>Perfect for Roasting</h3>
<p>Roasting at 230 C (210 C fan) gives vegetables like potatoes and carrots wonderful caramelisation while keeping them moist inside. The fan setting ensures heat reaches all surfaces evenly, eliminating hot spots that can cause uneven cooking. This temperature also works beautifully for chicken thighs or turkey pieces in both fan ovens and air fryers.</p>

<h2>Converting for Air Fryers</h2>
<p>Since air fryers use rapid air technology similar to fan ovens, the 230 C to fan oven conversion applies directly. Most air fryer recipes calling for 230 C actually mean 210 C on the fan setting. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more detailed temperature guidance across different cooking methods.</p>
<p>When adapting conventional oven recipes to air fryers, remember that cooking times will be shorter at 230 C (210 C fan). Start checking food about 5-10 minutes before the original recipe suggests. The circulating air cooks food more efficiently, so items like frozen chips or chicken wings will crisp up beautifully at this temperature without needing the full conventional oven time.</p>

<h2>Special Considerations for Baking</h2>
<p>While 230 C converts to 210 C in a fan oven for most cooking, delicate baked goods sometimes need extra attention. Cakes and cookies might brown too quickly at this temperature, so consider reducing further to 200 C fan or monitoring closely. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>cake recipes</a> include specific fan oven adjustments to help you achieve perfect results every time.</p>
<h3>Temperature Accuracy Matters</h3>
<p>Oven thermostats can vary, so it's worth investing in an oven thermometer to verify your 230 C to fan oven conversion. Place it in the center of your oven or air fryer basket to ensure accurate readings. Regular calibration checks will help maintain precision, especially important when working with high temperatures like 230 C where small variations can significantly impact results.</p>

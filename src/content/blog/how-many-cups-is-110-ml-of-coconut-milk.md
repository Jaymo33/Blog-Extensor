<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on even heat distribution, so ingredient ratios must be spot-on. Too much or too little coconut milk can alter texture and cooking times. For example, adding extra liquid might make batters too runny, while too little can dry out dishes. Many <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> call for coconut milk, especially in Asian-inspired or dairy-free dishes. Measuring 110 ml of coconut milk correctly ensures your meals turn out perfectly every time. It’s a small detail that makes a big difference.</p>  

<p>If you’re working with frozen coconut milk, thaw it first for accurate measuring. Shake the can well, as separation is common. For baking, stick to the 0.46-cup mark to avoid soggy or dense results. Need more tips? Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert recipes</a> often use coconut milk for creamy, vegan-friendly treats. Precision is key, whether you’re making a curry or a cake.</p>  

<h3>US vs. UK Cup Measurements</h3>  
<p>The slight difference between US and UK cups matters when converting 110 ml of coconut milk. A US cup is 240 ml, while a UK cup is 250 ml. This means 110 ml equals 0.46 US cups or 0.44 UK cups. For most recipes, the variance won’t ruin your dish, but it’s good to know. If you’re following a British recipe, adjust accordingly. Air fryer cooking is forgiving, but accuracy never hurts.</p>  

<h2>How to Measure 110 ml of Coconut Milk Without a Scale</h2>  
<p>No measuring jug? Use a tablespoon—15 ml equals one tablespoon, so 110 ml is about 7.3 tablespoons. For rough estimates, a US half-cup is 120 ml, so 110 ml is just shy of that. Stir the coconut milk first, as the cream and liquid can separate. For sticky batters or sauces, like those in our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipes</a>, consistency is crucial. A little extra or less can affect browning and crispiness.</p>  

<p>Another trick: use a standard drinking glass, which often holds 200–250 ml. Fill it halfway for 110 ml. Clean your air fryer basket afterward—coconut milk can leave residue. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning guide</a> has tips for tackling sticky messes. Whether you’re baking or frying, these hacks save time and stress.</p>

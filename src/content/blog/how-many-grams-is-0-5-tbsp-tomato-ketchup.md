<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on even cooking, and incorrect measurements can throw off textures and flavours. Too much ketchup might make your dish soggy, while too little could leave it bland. Using grams instead of tablespoons removes guesswork, especially with sticky ingredients like tomato ketchup. If you’re meal prepping or scaling recipes, grams provide uniformity.

<p>Tomato ketchup’s density means volume measurements like tablespoons can vary slightly. Grams eliminate this inconsistency, making them ideal for air fryer cooking. Whether you’re coating chicken wings or mixing a marinade, 0.5 tbsp (7.5g) of ketchup ensures the right balance. For sticky ingredients, a digital kitchen scale is a game-changer.</p>  

<h3>How to measure 0.5 tbsp of tomato ketchup without scales</h3>

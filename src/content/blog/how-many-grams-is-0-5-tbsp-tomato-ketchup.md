<p>0.5 tbsp of tomato ketchup weighs approximately 7.5 grams. This measurement is essential for air fryer recipes where precision matters, especially when balancing flavours or sticking to dietary guidelines. Whether you’re whipping up a quick glaze or adding a tangy twist to your dish, knowing the exact weight ensures consistency. For more air fryer conversions, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on even cooking, and incorrect measurements can throw off textures and flavours. Too much ketchup might make your dish soggy, while too little could leave it bland. Using grams instead of tablespoons removes guesswork, especially with sticky ingredients like tomato ketchup. If you’re meal prepping or scaling recipes, grams provide uniformity. Explore more precision tips in our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> section.</p>  

<p>Tomato ketchup’s density means volume measurements like tablespoons can vary slightly. Grams eliminate this inconsistency, making them ideal for air fryer cooking. Whether you’re coating chicken wings or mixing a marinade, 0.5 tbsp (7.5g) of ketchup ensures the right balance. For sticky ingredients, a digital kitchen scale is a game-changer.</p>  

<h3>How to measure 0.5 tbsp of tomato ketchup without scales</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have scales, fill a tablespoon halfway for 0.5 tbsp. However, for sticky sauces like ketchup, levelling it with a knife improves accuracy. Remember, this method is less precise than weighing in grams. For best results, invest in a cheap digital scale—it’s a must for air fryer enthusiasts. Cleanup is easy too; just wipe down with <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner</a>.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for 0.5 tbsp tomato ketchup in air fryer recipes</h2>  
<p>This small amount works perfectly in glazes for <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>air fryer chicken</a> or as a base for homemade BBQ sauce. Mix it with spices for a quick marinade, or drizzle over air-fried potatoes. Since air fryers intensify flavours, 7.5g (0.5 tbsp) of ketchup goes further than you’d think. It’s also great for binding breadcrumbs on fish or tofu.</p>  

<p>For healthier swaps, dilute ketchup with vinegar or water to stretch the flavour without extra sugar. This trick works wonders in <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>air fryer vegetable</a> dishes. Remember, 0.5 tbsp (7.5g) of ketchup contains about 2g of sugar, so measure carefully if watching intake. Check our site for low-sugar recipe ideas!</p>  

<h3>Converting other ketchup amounts to grams</h3>  
<p>1 tbsp of tomato ketchup equals 15g, while 1 tsp is roughly 5g. These conversions help when scaling recipes up or down. For batch cooking, multiply 7.5g (0.5 tbsp) by your required servings. Always note that different brands may vary slightly in density, so adjust to taste. Bookmark <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> for more handy measurement guides.</p>

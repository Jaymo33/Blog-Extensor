A 0.33 cup measure might hold slightly different amounts depending on how you pour, but 2.64 ounces will always be exact.

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air frying</h2>
<p>Air fryers rely on hot air circulation to cook food evenly, and the right amount of oil is crucial. Too much oil can lead to soggy results, while too little might leave your food dry.

<p>Sunflower oil is a popular choice for air frying due to its high smoke point and neutral flavour. Knowing how many ounces are in 0.33 cup allows you to adapt recipes with confidence. This is especially useful when scaling recipes up or down to suit your needs.</p>

<h3>How to measure 0.33 cup of sunflower oil</h3>
<p>If you don't have a measuring cup marked with 0.33 increments, you can use a standard 1/3 cup measure and fill it slightly less.

<p>4 tablespoons (tbsp) of caster sugar equals approximately 50 grams (g). This conversion is essential for precise baking, especially when using an air fryer, where accurate measurements can make or break your recipe. Whether you're making cakes, cookies, or desserts, knowing the exact weight ensures consistent results every time.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate sugar measurements matter</h2>  
<p>Baking is a science, and even small deviations in ingredient quantities can affect texture and taste. Caster sugar, with its fine granules, dissolves quickly and is commonly used in sponges, meringues, and delicate desserts. If you're using an air fryer for baking, precise measurements like 4 tbsp of caster sugar to grams (50g) help maintain the right moisture and structure. Too much sugar can lead to over-browning, while too little might leave your bake dry.</p>  

<p>For those who love experimenting with air fryer recipes, a reliable <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a> can be a lifesaver. It eliminates guesswork and ensures your treats turn out perfectly every time. Whether you're making a classic Victoria sponge or trying a new dessert, knowing the exact grams for 4 tbsp of caster sugar keeps things foolproof.</p>  

<h3>How to measure caster sugar correctly</h3>  
<p>Using a kitchen scale is the most accurate way to measure 4 tbsp of caster sugar in grams. However, if you don’t have one, spoon the sugar into the tablespoon lightly without packing it down. Level it off with a knife for consistency. Remember, 1 tbsp of caster sugar is roughly 12.5g, so 4 tbsp totals around 50g.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for 4 tbsp of caster sugar</h2>  
<p>This quantity is perfect for small batches of desserts, such as cupcakes, cookies, or even a quick caramel sauce. If you're using an air fryer, 50g of caster sugar works well in recipes like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>air fryer cakes</a> or meringues. Its fine texture ensures even distribution, giving your bakes a light, fluffy finish.</p>  

<p>For those who enjoy meal prepping, knowing the conversion from 4 tbsp of caster sugar to grams helps when scaling recipes up or down. Whether you're baking for one or a crowd, accuracy ensures your treats are always a hit. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a> for more inspiration on using caster sugar in your air fryer.</p>  

<h3>Converting other sugar types</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have caster sugar, granulated sugar can be used, but it weighs slightly more—about 14g per tbsp. Brown sugar, being denser, weighs around 13g per tbsp when packed. Always adjust accordingly to avoid altering your recipe’s outcome. For more tips on ingredient swaps, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion guides</a>.</p>  

<h2>Tips for baking with caster sugar in an air fryer</h2>  
<p>Air fryers circulate hot air, which can cause sugar-heavy recipes to brown faster. To prevent burning, reduce the temperature slightly or check your bake a few minutes early. Using 50g (4 tbsp) of caster sugar in smaller batches ensures even cooking. For sticky bakes like flapjacks, lining your air fryer basket with parchment paper helps with easy removal and cleanup.</p>  

<p>Keeping your air fryer clean is just as important as accurate measurements. Sugar residues can caramelize and stick, so regular wiping with a <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>suitable cleaner</a> maintains performance. Whether you're baking or reheating, a well-maintained air fryer ensures consistent results every time.</p>

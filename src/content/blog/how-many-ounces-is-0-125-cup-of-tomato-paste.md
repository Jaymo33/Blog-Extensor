<p>0.125 cup of tomato paste equals approximately 1 ounce. This measurement is handy for air fryer recipes where precision matters. Whether you're making a sauce or marinating meat, knowing this conversion ensures your dish turns out perfectly. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we focus on making cooking measurements effortless for your air fryer meals.</p>

<h2>Understanding the conversion</h2>
<p>Converting 0.125 cup of tomato paste to ounces is straightforward once you know the ratio. One standard US cup of tomato paste weighs about 8 ounces, so 0.125 cup is simply one-eighth of that amount. This measurement is particularly useful when following air fryer recipes that call for small quantities of tomato paste. Many of our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> use tomato paste as a flavour base, so getting the measurement right is key.</p>

<p>For UK cooks, it's important to note that fluid ounces and weight ounces can differ slightly. However, for tomato paste, which has a thick consistency, the weight measurement in ounces is what matters most in cooking. This small amount of tomato paste can make a big difference in dishes like our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>air fryer chicken recipes</a>, where it adds depth to marinades and sauces.</p>

<h3>Why accurate measurements matter</h3>

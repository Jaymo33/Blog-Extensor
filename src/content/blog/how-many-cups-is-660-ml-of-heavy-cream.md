<p>660 ml of heavy cream is approximately 2.79 cups in the US measurement system and 2.32 cups in the UK measurement system. Whether you're baking a cake, making a creamy sauce, or preparing a dessert in your air fryer, knowing this conversion ensures accuracy. Heavy cream is a versatile ingredient, and getting the measurement right can make or break your recipe.</p>

<h2>Understanding the Conversion</h2>
<p>Converting millilitres to cups can be tricky, especially when dealing with ingredients like heavy cream. The density of heavy cream means it doesn't always behave like water, but for most practical purposes, the standard conversion works. In the US, 1 cup equals 240 ml, while in the UK, 1 cup is 284 ml. This difference is crucial when following recipes from different regions.</p>
<p>For example, if you're using an American recipe that calls for 660 ml of heavy cream, you'll need about 2.79 US cups. If the recipe is British, you'll need roughly 2.32 UK cups. Always check the origin of your recipe to avoid confusion. For more conversions, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter</h2>
<p>Heavy cream is a key ingredient in many recipes, from soups to desserts. Using too much or too little can affect the texture and taste of your dish. For instance, if you're making a creamy pasta sauce in your air fryer, too much cream can make it overly rich, while too little can leave it dry. Accurate measurements ensure consistency and delicious results every time.</p>
<p>If you're baking, precision is even more critical. Heavy cream adds moisture and fat, which influence the structure of cakes and pastries. A slight deviation can lead to a dense or crumbly texture. For perfect results, always measure your heavy cream carefully.

<h3>Tips for Measuring Heavy Cream</h3>
<p>When measuring heavy cream, use a liquid measuring cup for accuracy. Pour the cream slowly to avoid spills and check the measurement at eye level. If your recipe calls for whipped cream, remember that whipped cream occupies more volume than liquid cream. For best results, whip the cream after measuring it in its liquid form.</p>

<h2>Common Uses for 660 ml of Heavy Cream</h2>
<p>660 ml of heavy cream is a common quantity in many recipes. You might use it to make a large batch of ice cream, a creamy soup, or a decadent dessert. In the air fryer, heavy cream can be used to make rich sauces, custards, or even crispy toppings for dishes like gratins. The possibilities are endless, and knowing the exact cup measurement helps you scale recipes up or down with ease.</p>

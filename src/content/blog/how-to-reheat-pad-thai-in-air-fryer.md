<p>To reheat Pad Thai in an air fryer, set the temperature to 160°C (320°F) and cook for 3-5 minutes, stirring halfway. This gentle heat revives the noodles without overcooking them, while the air circulation keeps everything crispy. Whether you’re working with leftovers from the fridge or last night’s takeaway, your air fryer can bring back that fresh-cooked texture.</p>

<h2>Why Use an Air Fryer for Reheating Pad Thai?</h2>
<p>The air fryer’s rapid hot air circulation is perfect for reheating Pad Thai evenly without sogginess. Unlike microwaves that steam noodles into mush, the air fryer crisps them up while maintaining moisture. It’s also faster than reheating in an oven, making it ideal for quick meals.

<p>Pad Thai contains delicate ingredients like rice noodles, eggs, and peanuts that need careful reheating. The air fryer’s precise temperature control prevents rubbery eggs or burnt peanuts.

<h2>Step-by-Step Guide to Reheating Pad Thai</h2>
<p>Start by preheating your air fryer to 160°C (320°F) for 3 minutes. Spread the Pad Thai in an even layer in the basket – overcrowding leads to uneven heating. If your portions are large, reheat in batches. Lightly spray or drizzle water over the noodles to prevent drying, then cook for 3 minutes.</p>
<p>After 3 minutes, shake the basket or stir the noodles thoroughly. Check for hot spots and rearrange if needed. Continue cooking for another 1-2 minutes until piping hot. For extra crispiness, add a minute, but watch closely to avoid burning. Always let it cool slightly before eating – the filling retains heat longer than expected.</p>

<h3>Best Temperature for Reheating Pad Thai</h3>
<p>160°C (320°F) strikes the perfect balance between reheating thoroughly and preserving texture. Higher temperatures risk drying out the noodles or burning the sweet tamarind sauce. Lower temps may leave the center cold while overcooking the edges. This temperature works for most <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken Pad Thai</a> or vegetarian versions.</p>

<h2>Pro Tips for Perfect Results</h2>
<p>For fridge-cold Pad Thai, let it sit at room temperature for 10 minutes before air frying. This reduces the reheating time and prevents cold centers. If your noodles seem dry, sprinkle 1-2 teaspoons of water or chicken broth before cooking. Covering with foil for the first 2 minutes helps retain moisture.</p>
<p>Add fresh garnishes like lime wedges, crushed peanuts, or cilantro after reheating to brighten flavors. For shrimp Pad Thai, check our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/shrimp>shrimp recipes</a> section for complementary dishes. Always clean your air fryer basket afterwards – sticky sauces can burn on. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning guide</a> makes maintenance effortless.</p>

<h3>How to Store Pad Thai for Best Reheating</h3>
<p>Store leftovers in an airtight container within 2 hours of cooking. Separate noodles from fresh garnishes to maintain texture. Properly stored Pad Thai keeps for 3-4 days in the fridge – perfect for meal prep. For longer storage, freeze in portioned containers for up to 2 months.</p>

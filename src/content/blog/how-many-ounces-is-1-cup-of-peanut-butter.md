<p>1 cup of peanut butter equals approximately 8.5 ounces (240 grams). This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes, ensuring accurate ingredient ratios for perfect results every time. Whether you're making peanut butter cookies or satay sauce, knowing this measurement helps avoid kitchen mishaps.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Peanut Butter Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Using the correct amount of peanut butter ensures your air fryer dishes turn out as intended. Too much can make batters oily, while too little might leave recipes dry. For example, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>peanut butter energy bites</a> rely on precise measurements for the right texture.</p>  
<p>Peanut butter’s density can vary slightly between brands, but 8.5 ounces per cup is a reliable standard. If you’re using a UK measuring cup, double-check it aligns with the 240ml metric standard. For more conversions, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> simplifies baking and cooking adjustments.</p>  

<h3>Converting Peanut Butter for Air Fryer Recipes</h3>  
<p>Many air fryer recipes, like our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>peanut butter cookies</a>, list ingredients by weight for consistency. A kitchen scale is handy, but if you’re using cups, remember 1 cup peanut butter to ounces is roughly 8.5 oz. For smaller batches, half a cup equals about 4.25 ounces.</p>  

<h2>Common Peanut Butter Measurement Questions</h2>  
<p>Sticky ingredients like peanut butter can be tricky to measure. To get an accurate 1 cup peanut butter in ounces, lightly spray your measuring cup with oil first. This helps it slide out cleanly without leaving residue. For more tips, explore our guide on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning air fryer accessories</a> after messy ingredients.</p>  
<p>Natural peanut butter often separates, so stir it well before measuring. If you’re using a crunchy variety, pack it gently to avoid air gaps. These small steps ensure your <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> creations turn out perfectly every time.</p>  

<h3>Scaling Recipes with Peanut Butter</h3>  
<p>Doubling a recipe? Two cups of peanut butter equal 17 ounces. For larger batches, like our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cookies>peanut butter granola bars</a>, weigh ingredients for precision. This avoids guesswork and guarantees balanced flavours.</p>

<p>265 F converts to approximately 130 C in a fan oven. This is a common temperature for slow-cooking dishes like casseroles or roasting vegetables in an air fryer. If you're using a fan-assisted oven or air fryer, this conversion ensures your food cooks evenly without drying out. For more precise adjustments, always refer to your appliance's manual or our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>

<h2>Why Convert 265 F to Fan Oven?</h2>
<p>Converting 265 F to fan oven settings (130 C) is essential for UK cooks using air fryers or convection ovens. Fan ovens circulate hot air, which means they cook faster and more evenly than conventional ovens. This conversion helps prevent overcooking, especially for delicate dishes like custards or slow-roasted meats. Many air fryer recipes, like those in our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken category</a>, rely on precise fan oven temperatures. Always double-check conversions if your appliance has unique settings.</p>

<p>Air fryers, which work similarly to fan ovens, benefit from this conversion too. A 265 F fan oven equivalent ensures crispy results without burning. For example, roasting nuts or dehydrating fruits at this temperature requires accuracy. If you're adapting a US recipe, this conversion is your first step.

<h3>How to Adjust Cooking Times</h3>
<p>When using 265 F in a fan oven, reduce cooking times by 10-15% compared to conventional ovens. Air fryers may need even less time due to their compact size. For instance, a dish that takes 60 minutes at 265 F in a standard oven might take 50 minutes in a fan oven or 45 in an air fryer. Always check food early to avoid overdoing it.</p>

<h2>Common Uses for 265 F in Fan Ovens</h2>
<p>265 F (130 C fan) is ideal for slow-cooking or dehydrating. Think pulled pork, roasted tomatoes, or homemade yogurt in an air fryer. This temperature gently breaks down connective tissues in meats without toughening them. It's also perfect for proofing dough or keeping dishes warm. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable recipes</a> often use this setting for caramelised results.</p>

<p>For air fryer users, 265 F fan oven equivalent works well for batch cooking. It's low enough to reheat leftovers without drying them out. Try it for warming bread or melting cheese on casseroles. Remember to preheat your air fryer for consistent results. Need cleaning tips? Visit our guide on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer maintenance</a>.</p>

<h3>Air Fryer vs. Fan Oven at 265 F</h3>
<p>Air fryers cook faster than fan ovens at 265 F due to their concentrated heat. Reduce cooking times by 20% when switching from fan oven to air fryer. For example, roasted chickpeas that take 40 minutes in a fan oven might need just 30 in an air fryer. Always shake the basket halfway for even cooking.</p>

<p>250g of peanut butter equals approximately 8.82 ounces. This conversion is essential for anyone using recipes that require precise measurements, especially when cooking with an air fryer. Whether you’re making peanut butter cookies or a savoury sauce, knowing the exact weight ensures perfect results every time.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on even cooking, and incorrect ingredient quantities can throw off your dish. Too much peanut butter might make a recipe overly dense, while too little could leave it dry. For consistent results, always measure ingredients like peanut butter accurately. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for other common measurements.</p>  

<p>Peanut butter is a versatile ingredient in air fryer recipes, from desserts like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cookies>cookies</a> to savoury dishes like satay chicken. Since air fryers cook quickly, precise measurements ensure your food doesn’t burn or undercook. If you’re new to air frying, start with smaller batches to get the hang of it.</p>  

<h2>How to measure peanut butter for air fryer recipes</h2>  
<p>Measuring sticky ingredients like peanut butter can be tricky. For the most accurate results, use a kitchen scale set to grams or ounces. If you don’t have one, spoon the peanut butter into a measuring cup and level it off. Avoid packing it down, as this can lead to over-measuring.</p>  

<h3>Converting grams to ounces for peanut butter</h3>  
<p>The general rule is that 1 gram equals 0.035 ounces, so 250g of peanut butter is roughly 8.82 ounces. This conversion is useful for recipes from the US or UK, where measurements may vary. Bookmark our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipes page</a> for more air fryer-friendly ideas.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for 250g of peanut butter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Peanut butter works wonderfully in both sweet and savoury air fryer dishes. Try it in peanut butter cookies, energy bites, or as a glaze for chicken. Since air fryers circulate hot air, peanut butter-based coatings crisp up beautifully without excess oil.</p>  

<p>For a quick dessert, spread peanut butter on toast and air fry for a crispy treat. You can also mix it into batters for cakes or muffins—just ensure you’re using the correct 250g to ounces conversion.

<h3>Cleaning peanut butter residue from your air fryer</h3>

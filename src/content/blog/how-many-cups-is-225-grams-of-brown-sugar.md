<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Using the correct amount of brown sugar can make or break your recipe. Too much can lead to overly sweet or dense results, while too little may leave your baked goods lacking flavour. Air fryer recipes, in particular, rely on precise measurements due to their compact cooking environment. If you're converting grams to cups, always consider whether the sugar is packed or loose. For a handy reference, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> covers all common ingredients.</p>  

<p>Brown sugar has a unique texture that affects its volume. Unlike granulated sugar, it clumps together, meaning a cup of packed brown sugar weighs more than a loosely filled one. This is why weighing ingredients is often more reliable than using cup measurements. However, if you don’t have scales, knowing that 225 grams equals about 1.1 cups is a great starting point.

<h3>How to Measure Brown Sugar Correctly</h3>  
<p>To measure 225 grams of brown sugar in cups, lightly spoon the sugar into a measuring cup without packing it down. Then level it off with a knife for an accurate reading. If your recipe calls for packed brown sugar, press it firmly into the cup to eliminate air gaps. This method ensures consistency, whether you're baking cookies or making a glaze for air-fried desserts. For more precision, invest in a digital kitchen scale—it’s a game-changer for air fryer cooking.</p>  

<h2>Converting Grams to Cups for Different Sugars</h2>  
<p>Not all sugars weigh the same, so conversions vary. For example, 225 grams of granulated sugar equals about 1.1 cups, while powdered sugar is closer to 1.8 cups due to its finer texture. Brown sugar falls somewhere in between because of its moisture content. If you're adapting a recipe for your air fryer, always double-check the type of sugar used. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a> simplifies this process for all your baking needs.</p>  

<p>When working with air fryers, even small measurement errors can affect cooking times and textures. That’s why we recommend weighing ingredients whenever possible. If you’re in a pinch, though, remember that 225 grams of brown sugar is approximately 1.1 cups.

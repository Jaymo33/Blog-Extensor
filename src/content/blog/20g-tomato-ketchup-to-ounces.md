<p>20g of tomato ketchup equals approximately 0.71 ounces. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements can make or break your dish. Whether you’re making crispy chicken wings or loaded fries, knowing how many ounces 20g of tomato ketchup is ensures consistency in flavour and texture. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we understand the importance of accurate conversions for perfect results every time.</p>

<h2>Why Convert 20g of Tomato Ketchup to Ounces?</h2>  
<p>Many air fryer recipes, especially those from the UK, use grams as the standard measurement. However, if you’re following an international recipe or using kitchen scales that display ounces, converting 20g of tomato ketchup to ounces becomes necessary. This small but crucial step ensures your dish turns out just right. For example, if you’re making sticky glazed salmon or BBQ-style tofu, the exact amount of ketchup matters.</p>  
<p>Additionally, understanding conversions helps when meal prepping or scaling recipes. Whether you’re cooking for one or a family, knowing that 20g of tomato ketchup is 0.71 ounces saves time and avoids guesswork. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more handy measurements to streamline your cooking process.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure 20g of Tomato Ketchup Accurately</h3>  
<p>For the most precise measurement, use a digital kitchen scale set to grams. If your scale only displays ounces, simply multiply the grams by 0.035 to get the equivalent in ounces. For 20g of tomato ketchup, this calculation gives you 0.71 ounces. No scale? A standard UK tablespoon holds roughly 15g of ketchup, so 20g is just over one tablespoon. This method works in a pinch but isn’t as accurate as weighing.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for 20g of Tomato Ketchup in Air Fryer Recipes</h2>  
<p>Tomato ketchup is a versatile ingredient in air fryer cooking. From marinades to glazes, 20g of tomato ketchup adds the perfect balance of sweetness and tang. Try it in recipes like air-fried chicken drumsticks, where 20g of ketchup mixed with honey and spices creates a sticky, finger-licking glaze. Or use it as a base for homemade BBQ sauce to elevate your next batch of crispy fries.</p>  
<p>For healthier options, 20g of tomato ketchup can be brushed onto salmon fillets or tofu before air frying. The slight caramelisation adds depth of flavour without overpowering the dish. Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> for more creative ways to use this measurement in your cooking.</p>  

<h3>Tips for Storing Leftover Tomato Ketchup</h3>  
<p>If you’ve measured out 20g of tomato ketchup and have leftovers, store it in an airtight container in the fridge. Tomato ketchup typically lasts up to six months when refrigerated, but always check for changes in colour or smell. For smaller portions, squeeze bottles or condiment containers with tight lids work best. Proper storage ensures your ketchup stays fresh for future air fryer creations.</p>  

<p>Cleaning your air fryer after using sticky ingredients like ketchup is also important. Residue can build up and affect performance.

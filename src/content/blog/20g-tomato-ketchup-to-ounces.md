<h2>Why Convert 20g of Tomato Ketchup to Ounces?</h2>

However, if you’re following an international recipe or using kitchen scales that display ounces, converting 20g of tomato ketchup to ounces becomes necessary.

<h3>How to Measure 20g of Tomato Ketchup Accurately</h3>  
<p>For the most precise measurement, use a digital kitchen scale set to grams. If your scale only displays ounces, simply multiply the grams by 0.035 to get the equivalent in ounces. For 20g of tomato ketchup, this calculation gives you 0.71 ounces. No scale? A standard UK tablespoon holds roughly 15g of ketchup, so 20g is just over one tablespoon. This method works in a pinch but isn’t as accurate as weighing.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for 20g of Tomato Ketchup in Air Fryer Recipes</h2>  
<p>Tomato ketchup is a versatile ingredient in air fryer cooking. From marinades to glazes, 20g of tomato ketchup adds the perfect balance of sweetness and tang. Try it in recipes like air-fried chicken drumsticks, where 20g of ketchup mixed with honey and spices creates a sticky, finger-licking glaze. Or use it as a base for homemade BBQ sauce to elevate your next batch of crispy fries.</p>

<p>85 ml of buttermilk is roughly 0.36 cups, making it a handy measurement for baking and cooking in your air fryer. Whether you're whipping up pancakes, cakes, or marinades, knowing this conversion ensures your recipes turn out perfectly every time. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we understand the importance of precise measurements, especially when working with air fryers where consistency is key.</p>

<h2>Understanding the Conversion</h2>  
<p>Converting 85 ml of buttermilk to cups is straightforward once you know the ratio. One cup equals 236.59 ml, so dividing 85 ml by this number gives you approximately 0.36 cups. This measurement is particularly useful for recipes that call for small amounts of buttermilk, such as dressings or batters. If you're using an air fryer, precise measurements like this can make all the difference in texture and flavour.</p>  

<p>For those who prefer visual aids, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> provides a quick reference for common measurements. Whether you're scaling up or down, this tool ensures you never miss a beat in the kitchen. Buttermilk, with its tangy flavour, is a staple in many recipes, so getting the conversion right is essential.</p>  

<h3>Why Buttermilk Matters in Air Fryer Recipes</h3>  
<p>Buttermilk adds moisture and a slight tang to dishes, making it a favourite for air fryer recipes like fried chicken or fluffy pancakes. When converting 85 ml of buttermilk to cups, you ensure your marinades or batters have the right consistency. Too much or too little can affect the final result, so accuracy is key. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipes section</a> for inspiration on how to use buttermilk in your air fryer creations.</p>  

<h2>Measuring Tools and Tips</h2>  
<p>While measuring cups are common, a kitchen scale can provide even more accuracy for 85 ml of buttermilk. If you don’t have one, a liquid measuring cup with clear ml markings will do the trick. For air fryer cooking, where precision matters, investing in reliable tools can elevate your dishes. Cleaning your tools is just as important—our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner guide</a> helps keep everything spotless.</p>  

<p>If you're working with a recipe that uses cups but your buttermilk is measured in ml, this conversion saves the day. For example, 85 ml of buttermilk in cups is 0.36, which you can round to 1/3 cup for simplicity in most recipes. This small adjustment ensures your air fryer dishes turn out as intended, whether you're baking or frying.</p>  

<h3>Common Recipes Using 85 ml of Buttermilk</h3>  
<p>From tender <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>air fryer chicken</a> to moist cakes, 85 ml of buttermilk is a versatile ingredient. Its acidity helps tenderise meats and adds lift to baked goods. If you're experimenting with new recipes, this measurement is a great starting point for small batches. Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert recipes</a> for sweet treats that use buttermilk to perfection.</p>  

<h2>Conversion Variations</h2>  
<p>While 85 ml of buttermilk equals roughly 0.36 cups, it’s worth noting that cup sizes can vary slightly by region. In the UK, a standard cup is 250 ml, while in the US, it’s 240 ml. For most practical purposes, however, the difference is negligible. When working with air fryer recipes, consistency is more important than perfection, so don’t stress over minor variations.</p>  

<p>If you’re doubling or halving a recipe, simply adjust the 85 ml of buttermilk proportionally. For example, 170 ml would be roughly 0.72 cups, or just under 3/4 cup. This flexibility makes it easy to scale recipes for your air fryer, whether you’re cooking for one or a crowd.

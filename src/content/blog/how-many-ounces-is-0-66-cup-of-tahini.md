<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter</h2>
<p>Accurate measurements are crucial when cooking with tahini, especially in air fryer recipes where ingredient ratios affect texture and flavour. Too much tahini can make a dish overly dense, while too little might leave it lacking in richness. By converting 0.66 cup of tahini to ounces, you ensure your recipes turn out perfectly every time. This precision is particularly important for dishes like tahini-glazed vegetables or tahini-marinated chicken, where balance is key.

<p>Using a kitchen scale for measurements like 0.66 cup of tahini to ounces can also save time and reduce cleanup. Instead of dealing with sticky measuring cups, you can weigh your ingredients directly into the mixing bowl. This method is especially handy for air fryer cooking, where efficiency is a priority. Plus, it eliminates the guesswork, ensuring your tahini-based dishes are consistently delicious.</p>

<h3>How to Measure Tahini Correctly</h3>
<p>Measuring tahini can be tricky due to its thick, sticky consistency. To get an accurate 0.66 cup of tahini in ounces, lightly spray your measuring cup with oil first. This prevents the tahini from sticking and ensures you can pour it out cleanly. Alternatively, use a spoon to scoop and level the tahini in the cup for precise measurement.

Its richness also pairs well with chicken or tofu, creating a delicious crust when air-fried.

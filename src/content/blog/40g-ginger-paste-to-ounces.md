<p>40g of ginger paste equals approximately 1.41 ounces. This conversion is handy for air fryer recipes where precise measurements matter. Whether you're whipping up a marinade or adding a punch of flavour to your dishes, knowing the exact weight ensures consistency.

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on precise ingredient ratios to deliver perfectly cooked meals. Too much ginger paste can overpower a dish, while too little might leave it bland. Measuring 40g of ginger paste correctly ensures balanced flavours. This is especially important for recipes like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer chicken tikka</a> or stir-fries. Always use a digital scale for the best results.</p>  

<p>Ginger paste is a staple in many cuisines, adding warmth and depth to dishes. Whether you're making sauces, marinades, or dressings, 40g (1.41 oz) is a common measurement. For more recipe ideas, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipes</a> section. Accurate conversions help avoid kitchen mishaps and wasted ingredients.</p>  

<h3>How to measure ginger paste without a scale</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a scale, you can estimate 40g of ginger paste using tablespoons. Roughly, 1 tablespoon equals about 15g, so 40g would be just under 3 tablespoons. However, this method isn’t as precise as weighing. For best results, invest in a kitchen scale—it’s a game-changer for air fryer cooking.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for 40g of ginger paste</h2>  
<p>40g of ginger paste is perfect for marinating proteins like chicken or tofu before air frying. It also works well in sauces, soups, and even baked goods. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable recipes</a> for inspiration. The bold flavour of ginger paste pairs beautifully with soy sauce, garlic, and honey.</p>  

<p>Another great use for 40g of ginger paste is in homemade salad dressings or dips. Combine it with yoghurt, lime juice, and spices for a zesty accompaniment to air-fried snacks.

<h3>Storing ginger paste for freshness</h3>  
<p>To keep ginger paste fresh, store it in an airtight container in the fridge. A 40g portion can last up to two weeks if sealed properly. You can also freeze it in ice cube trays for longer storage. This way, you’ll always have the right amount ready for your next air fryer adventure.</p>

<p>2.5 cups of sweet chilli sauce equals approximately 20 fluid ounces (or 20 oz). This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements can make or break your dish. Whether you're marinating chicken wings or glazing shrimp, knowing the exact weight ensures consistent results every time.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on even heat distribution, and incorrect ingredient quantities can lead to uneven cooking or overly saucy dishes. Sweet chilli sauce, with its sticky consistency, needs careful measuring to avoid overpowering flavours. For perfect results, always use standardised cups and ounces when following recipes from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>.</p>  
<p>Many air fryer recipes, like crispy tofu or glazed salmon, call for sweet chilli sauce as a key ingredient. Getting the 2.5 cups to ounces conversion right ensures your dish isn't too dry or soggy. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for other common measurement swaps.</p>  

<h2>How to measure sweet chilli sauce correctly</h2>  
<p>Liquid ingredients like sweet chilli sauce should be measured in a clear, liquid measuring cup for accuracy. Fill to the 2.5-cup mark at eye level, ensuring no air bubbles distort the measurement. For thicker sauces, gently stir to remove trapped air before pouring.</p>  

<h3>Using a kitchen scale for precision</h3>  
<p>If you want absolute accuracy, weigh your 2.5 cups of sweet chilli sauce on a digital scale. Twenty ounces is the equivalent weight, but slight variations can occur based on brand density. This method is ideal for batch cooking or meal prep from our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/meal-prep>meal prep recipes</a>.</p>  

<h2>Common air fryer recipes using 2.5 cups sweet chilli sauce</h2>  
<p>This quantity works perfectly for glazing a full batch of chicken wings or coating crispy tofu cubes. The 20-ounce measurement ensures enough sauce for even coverage without excess pooling in the air fryer basket. Browse our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a> for inspiration.</p>  
<p>For seafood lovers, 2.5 cups (20 oz) of sweet chilli sauce makes an excellent marinade for shrimp or glaze for salmon fillets. The balanced quantity allows for proper caramelisation without dripping through the basket. Always preheat your air fryer for best results with saucy dishes.</p>  

<h3>Adjusting recipes for different serving sizes</h3>  
<p>If your air fryer recipe serves fewer people, simply halve the 2.5 cups (20 oz) measurement. For larger batches, double it while ensuring your air fryer isn't overcrowded. Proper spacing is key to achieving that perfect crispy texture we all love.</p>  

<h2>Storage tips for leftover sweet chilli sauce</h2>  
<p>After measuring out your 2.5 cups (20 oz), store any remaining sauce in an airtight container in the fridge. Proper storage maintains freshness for future air fryer creations. Remember to clean your air fryer promptly after cooking sticky sauces using our recommended <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning methods</a>.</p>

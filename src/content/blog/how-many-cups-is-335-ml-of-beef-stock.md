<p>335 ml of beef stock equals approximately 1.42 cups in the UK or 1.41 cups in the US. This conversion is essential for precise cooking, especially when using an air fryer, where measurements can make or break a dish. Whether you're preparing a rich gravy or a hearty stew, knowing how much beef stock to use ensures consistent results every time.</p>  

<h2>Understanding the Conversion</h2>  
<p>Converting millilitres to cups can be tricky, as cup sizes vary between the UK and the US. In the UK, 1 cup equals 284 ml, while in the US, it's 237 ml. For 335 ml of beef stock, this means roughly 1.42 UK cups or 1.41 US cups. This small difference might not seem significant, but for recipes requiring precision, it matters.</p>  

<p>If you're using an air fryer, accurate measurements are even more critical. Too much liquid can lead to soggy results, while too little might dry out your dish.

<h3>Why Accurate Measurements Matter</h3>  
<p>Beef stock is a staple in many recipes, from soups to casseroles. Using the right amount ensures balanced flavours and textures.

<h2>Practical Tips for Measuring Beef Stock</h2>  
<p>Measuring liquids like beef stock can be messy if you're not careful. Use a clear measuring jug with millilitre and cup markings for accuracy. If you don't have one, a standard UK or US measuring cup will do, but remember the slight variation in sizes.</p>  

<p>For air fryer recipes, it's best to measure liquids before adding them to avoid spills. If you're working with frozen beef stock, thaw it first for an accurate measurement.

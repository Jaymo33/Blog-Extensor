<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter</h2>
<p>Precision is key when working with condensed milk, especially in air fryer recipes. Too much or too little can alter the texture and taste of your dish. For example, a cheesecake or fudge recipe relying on 2.0 cups of condensed milk needs the exact 473 ml for perfect results. Air fryers cook quickly, so balanced ingredients are crucial.

<h3>UK vs. US Cup Measurements</h3>
<p>While 2.0 cups of condensed milk equals 473 ml in the US, UK cup measurements can vary slightly. Always double-check your recipe’s origin to avoid discrepancies. Most modern recipes use the US standard, but it’s worth confirming. If you’re using a UK recipe, consider weighing the condensed milk for absolute precision. For more measurement guides, visit <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>.</p>

<h2>How to Measure Condensed Milk Without a Cup</h2>
<p>If you don’t have measuring cups, a kitchen scale can help. One ml of condensed milk weighs roughly 1.3 grams, so 473 ml would be about 615 grams. This method is handy for those who prefer weighing ingredients. Alternatively, use a liquid measuring jug marked in ml for accuracy. For cleaning tips post-measurement, see our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner guide</a>.</p>

<p>Another trick is to use tablespoons—16 tablespoons make up one cup, so 2.0 cups would be 32 tablespoons. While less precise, it works in a pinch. Remember, condensed milk is sticky, so level off each tablespoon for the best results.

<p>5 grams of self-raising flour equals approximately 0.18 ounces. This conversion is essential for precise baking, especially when using an air fryer where measurements matter. Whether you're whipping up cakes, cookies, or bread, getting the flour ratio right ensures perfect results every time. For more air fryer baking tips, visit <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes</a>.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Flour Measurements Matter</h2>
<p>Baking is a science, and even small discrepancies in flour measurements can affect texture and rise. Self-raising flour contains baking powder, so precision is key. If you're using an air fryer, uneven measurements can lead to dry or dense results. That’s why converting 5g of self-raising flour to ounces (0.18 oz) ensures consistency. For a full guide on air fryer conversions, check out <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>our conversion chart</a>.</p>

<p>Many UK recipes use grams, but if your scales only measure ounces, knowing this conversion is a lifesaver. Whether you're making scones or muffins, 5g of self-raising flour is a common small measurement. For more baking inspiration, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>cake recipes</a> tailored for air fryers.</p>

<h2>How to Measure 5g of Self-Raising Flour Without Scales</h2>
<p>Don’t have digital scales? No problem! A teaspoon of self-raising flour weighs roughly 3g, so 5g is just under two level teaspoons. For accuracy, fluff the flour first and spoon it lightly into the measuring spoon. Avoid packing it down, as this can lead to over-measuring. If you’re baking in an air fryer, slight variations can impact cooking time, so precision matters.</p>

<h3>Converting Larger Quantities of Self-Raising Flour</h3>
<p>Need to scale up? Here’s a quick reference: 10g of self-raising flour equals 0.35 oz, and 100g equals 3.53 oz. Bookmark <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> for more handy conversion tips. Whether you’re baking for one or a crowd, accurate measurements make all the difference.</p>

<h2>Common Mistakes When Measuring Flour</h2>
<p>Scooping flour directly from the bag compacts it, leading to excess. Instead, use the spoon-and-level method for accuracy. Another mistake is ignoring the difference between self-raising and plain flour—they’re not interchangeable without adjustments.

<p>Air fryer baking is forgiving, but flour measurements shouldn’t be guessed. If a recipe calls for 5g of self-raising flour (0.18 oz), stick to it for best results.

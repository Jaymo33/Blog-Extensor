Whether you're marinating chicken, glazing vegetables, or adding a tangy kick to a dish, knowing how many cups is 35 ml of balsamic vinegar helps streamline your cooking process.</p>  

<h2>Understanding Balsamic Vinegar Measurements</h2>  
<p>Balsamic vinegar is a staple in many kitchens, especially for air fryer enthusiasts who love its rich, tangy flavour. When a recipe calls for 35 ml of balsamic vinegar, it’s useful to know the cup equivalent to avoid guesswork. In the UK and US, cup measurements differ slightly, but 35 ml translates to roughly 0.15 cups in both systems.

<h3>Why Accuracy Matters in Air Fryer Cooking</h3>  
<p>Air fryers cook food quickly and evenly, so ingredient proportions need to be spot-on. Too much balsamic vinegar can overpower a dish, while too little might leave it bland. Measuring 35 ml of balsamic vinegar correctly ensures balanced flavours every time. If you’re new to air frying, start with simple recipes like balsamic-glazed chicken or tofu from our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipes</a> section.</p>  

<h2>Converting 35 ml of Balsamic Vinegar to Cups</h2>  
<p>To convert 35 ml of balsamic vinegar to cups, remember that 1 cup equals 240 ml. Dividing 35 ml by 240 ml gives you 0.146 cups, which rounds to 0.15 cups. This measurement is especially useful when scaling recipes up or down. For example, if a recipe calls for 70 ml of balsamic vinegar, you’d use 0.3 cups instead.</p>  

<p>If you don’t have a measuring cup, a tablespoon holds about 15 ml, so 35 ml of balsamic vinegar is roughly 2 tablespoons plus 1 teaspoon. For more baking and cooking conversions, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion guide</a>.</p>

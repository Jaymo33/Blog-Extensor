<p>0.5 cups of self-raising flour equals approximately 60 grams. This conversion is essential for precise baking, especially when using an air fryer where measurements matter. Whether you're whipping up cakes or bread, knowing the exact gram equivalent ensures consistent results every time. For more air fryer conversions, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Flour Measurements Matter</h2>
<p>Baking is a science, and even small measurement errors can affect texture and rise. Self-raising flour contains baking powder, so precision is key. Too much or too little can make your air fryer cakes dense or flat. Using grams instead of cups eliminates guesswork, giving you perfect bakes every time. Visit <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>our recipe collection</a> for foolproof ideas.</p>

<p>Air fryers heat quickly, so balanced ingredients are crucial. A 60-gram measurement ensures your self-raising flour performs as intended. This is especially important for recipes like scones or muffins, where lift matters. For more baking tips, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>cake recipes</a> designed for air fryers.</p>

<h3>How to Measure 0.5 Cups of Self-Raising Flour</h3>
<p>For the most accurate 60-gram measurement, use a kitchen scale. Scooping flour directly from the bag can compact it, leading to excess. Instead, spoon flour lightly into the cup and level it off. This method ensures your 0.5 cups of self-raising flour is truly 60 grams. Need cleaning tips? Try our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner guide</a>.</p>

<h2>UK vs US Cup Measurements</h2>
<p>While 0.5 cups of self-raising flour is 60 grams in the UK, US cups differ slightly. A US cup holds about 120 grams, making 0.5 cups closer to 65 grams. Always check your recipe's origin to avoid mishaps. For UK-specific air fryer recipes, <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> uses standard British measurements.</p>

<p>This discrepancy matters most in delicate bakes like souffl√©s or Victoria sponge. When converting US recipes, adjust your 0.5 cups of self-raising flour to 60 grams for UK flour. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert section</a> has adjusted recipes ready to go.</p>

<h3>Common Recipes Using 0.5 Cups Self-Raising Flour</h3>
<p>Many air fryer recipes call for 0.5 cups (60g) of self-raising flour. Think small-batch pancakes, scones, or even coating for fried chicken. This amount is perfect for 2-3 servings, ideal for quick air fryer meals. Check our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/breakfast>breakfast recipes</a> for inspiration.</p>

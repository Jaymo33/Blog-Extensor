<p>0.75 tbsp of caster sugar equals approximately 9.4 grams. This conversion is essential for precise baking, especially when using an air fryer where measurements matter. Whether you’re whipping up cakes, cookies, or desserts, knowing the exact weight ensures consistent results. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we help simplify these conversions so your recipes turn out perfectly every time.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate sugar measurements matter in air fryer baking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers cook food quickly and evenly, but inaccurate measurements can lead to dry or overly sweet results. Caster sugar, with its fine texture, dissolves faster than granulated sugar, making it ideal for air fryer recipes. Measuring 0.75 tbsp of caster sugar correctly (9.4 grams) ensures your baked goods have the right sweetness and texture. For more tips, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> to streamline your cooking process.</p>  

<p>Many UK recipes use tablespoons, but grams provide greater precision. If you’re adapting a traditional recipe for your air fryer, converting 0.75 tbsp of caster sugar to grams eliminates guesswork. This is particularly useful for delicate bakes like sponges or meringues, where even small measurement errors can affect the outcome.</p>  

<h3>How to measure 0.75 tbsp of caster sugar without scales</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have digital scales, you can still measure 0.75 tbsp of caster sugar accurately. Fill a tablespoon halfway (0.5 tbsp) and then add half of that amount again. Alternatively, use a teaspoon—0.75 tbsp equals 2.25 teaspoons. For more air fryer-friendly dessert ideas, browse our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipes</a> section.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for 0.75 tbsp of caster sugar in air fryer recipes</h2>  
<p>This small but precise amount of sugar is often used in glazes, toppings, or light batters. For example, a single-serving air fryer mug cake might call for 0.75 tbsp (9.4 grams) of caster sugar to balance sweetness without overpowering other flavours. It’s also perfect for dusting fruits or enhancing the caramelisation of air-fried desserts.</p>  

<p>If you’re meal prepping, knowing how many grams are in 0.75 tbsp of caster sugar helps scale recipes up or down. Visit our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert category</a> for inspiration on using this measurement in everything from cookies to crumbles. Accurate conversions mean no wasted ingredients and perfectly portioned treats.</p>  

<h3>Converting other sugar amounts for air fryer baking</h3>  
<p>Once you’ve mastered 0.75 tbsp of caster sugar (9.4 grams), you can apply the same precision to larger or smaller quantities. For instance, 1 tbsp of caster sugar is roughly 12.5 grams, while 0.5 tbsp is about 6.25 grams. Keeping these conversions handy ensures your air fryer bakes are consistently delicious.

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on even heat distribution, so ingredient ratios are crucial. Too much or too little almond milk can affect texture, especially in baked goods like muffins or cakes. For example, adding extra almond milk might make your batter too runny, leading to uneven cooking. On the other hand, too little could result in a dry, crumbly outcome. That’s why converting 3 tbsp of almond milk to grams (45g) helps maintain recipe integrity.

<p>Many air fryer enthusiasts prefer almond milk for its lighter consistency and dairy-free benefits. However, its slightly thinner texture compared to dairy milk means measurements need extra attention. If you’re substituting almond milk in a recipe originally designed for cow’s milk, the 3 tbsp to 45g conversion ensures you stay on track. This is particularly useful for vegan or lactose-free adaptations of classic dishes.</p>  

<h3>How to measure 3 tbsp of almond milk accurately</h3>  
<p>For the most precise measurement, use a digital kitchen scale to weigh out 45g of almond milk. If you don’t have one, fill a tablespoon measure to the brim without letting it overflow. Level it off with a straight edge for consistency. Remember, slight variations can occur depending on the brand or whether the almond milk is homemade.

<h3>Does almond milk brand affect the weight?</h3>  
<p>While most commercial almond milks hover around 15g per tablespoon (45g for 3 tbsp), homemade versions can differ. Thicker, creamier almond milks may weigh slightly more, while diluted ones could be lighter. Always check the label if using store-bought, as some brands add stabilisers or sweeteners that alter density. For consistent results, stick to the same brand once you find one that works for your recipes.</p>

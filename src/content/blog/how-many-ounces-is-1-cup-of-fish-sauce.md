<h2>Why measuring fish sauce accurately matters</h2>

In air fryer cooking, balance is key—too much fish sauce can make food overly salty, while too little might leave it bland. Recipes like air-fried salmon or crispy tofu often rely on fish sauce for depth of flavour. Measuring by weight (ounces) rather than volume (cups) ensures precision.

<p>Many UK cooks wonder about the difference between US and UK cup measurements. Luckily, for fish sauce, the variance is minimal—roughly 8.45 oz per cup in both systems. If you're scaling up a recipe, this consistency is a relief. Always use a liquid measuring cup for accuracy, as fish sauce’s viscosity can skew dry measurements. Need a cleaner for sticky residue?

<p>1 cup of fish sauce equals approximately 8.45 ounces. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements can make or break a dish. Whether you're marinating chicken or seasoning seafood, knowing the exact weight ensures consistent results. Fish sauce is a staple in many Asian-inspired air fryer dishes, so getting the measurement right matters. For more conversion tips, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>  

<h2>Why measuring fish sauce accurately matters</h2>  
<p>Fish sauce is a potent ingredient, and even a small miscalculation can overpower your dish. In air fryer cooking, balance is key—too much fish sauce can make food overly salty, while too little might leave it bland. Recipes like air-fried salmon or crispy tofu often rely on fish sauce for depth of flavour. Measuring by weight (ounces) rather than volume (cups) ensures precision. For recipe ideas, browse our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> collection.</p>  

<p>Many UK cooks wonder about the difference between US and UK cup measurements. Luckily, for fish sauce, the variance is minimal—roughly 8.45 oz per cup in both systems. If you're scaling up a recipe, this consistency is a relief. Always use a liquid measuring cup for accuracy, as fish sauce’s viscosity can skew dry measurements. Need a cleaner for sticky residue? Try our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner guide</a>.</p>  

<h3>Converting fish sauce for air fryer marinades</h3>  
<p>Marinades are where fish sauce truly shines in air fryer cooking. A standard marinade might call for 1 cup of fish sauce, which translates to 8.45 oz. This measurement works perfectly for dishes like air-fried chicken thighs or shrimp skewers. If you’re adjusting a recipe, remember that 1 tablespoon of fish sauce is about 0.5 oz. For more marinade inspiration, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipes</a>.</p>  

<h2>Common mistakes when measuring fish sauce</h2>  
<p>One frequent error is using a dry measuring cup instead of a liquid one, which can lead to spills or inaccuracies. Another is eyeballing the amount—fish sauce’s strong flavour demands precision. Always level off the cup for an exact 8.45 oz measurement. Storing fish sauce properly (in a cool, dark place) also preserves its quality. For seafood lovers, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/shrimp>shrimp recipes</a> showcase fish sauce beautifully.</p>  

<p>If you’re halving a recipe, ½ cup of fish sauce equals roughly 4.23 oz. This is handy for smaller air fryer batches or testing new flavours. Digital kitchen scales are ideal for these adjustments, especially with sticky ingredients like fish sauce. For crispy, flavourful results, precise measurements are non-negotiable.

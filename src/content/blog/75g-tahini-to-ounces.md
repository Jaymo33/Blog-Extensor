<h2>Why Convert 75g of Tahini to Ounces?</h2>

<p>Measuring tahini can be tricky due to its thick, sticky consistency. For 75g (2.65 oz), use a digital kitchen scale for the most accurate results.

<p>Tahini is a staple in many <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable-based air fryer recipes</a>, from roasted cauliflower to crispy chickpeas. Its nutty taste enhances dishes, but too much or too little can throw off the balance.

<h3>How to Measure Garlic Paste Correctly</h3>  
<p>Use a liquid measuring cup for garlic paste, as itâ€™s thick but pourable. Scoop the paste into the cup and level it off with a spatula for accuracy. Avoid packing it down, as this can lead to over-measuring. For sticky ingredients like garlic paste, a quick spray of oil on the measuring cup can help it slide out easily.</p>  

<h2>Converting Cups to Ounces for Different Ingredients</h2>  
<p>Not all ingredients weigh the same per cup. While 2 cups of garlic paste is roughly 16 ounces, other ingredients like flour or sugar differ. Always refer to a reliable conversion guide, especially when adapting recipes for your air fryer.

<h3>Common Mistakes When Measuring Garlic Paste</h3>

<h2>Using Garlic Paste in Air Fryer Recipes</h2>

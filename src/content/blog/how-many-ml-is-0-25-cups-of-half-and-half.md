<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on precise ingredient ratios to achieve even cooking and optimal results.

<h3>How to Measure Half and Half Correctly</h3>  
<p>Use a liquid measuring cup for accuracy, filling it to the 59 ml mark for 0.25 cups. Avoid dry measuring cups, as they can lead to slight variations. If your recipe calls for UK or US measurements, rest assured that 0.25 cups of half and half in ml remains the same. For creamy dishes like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>desserts</a>, this precision ensures velvety results.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for Half and Half in Air Fryer Recipes</h2>

<h3>Converting Other Dairy Measurements</h3>

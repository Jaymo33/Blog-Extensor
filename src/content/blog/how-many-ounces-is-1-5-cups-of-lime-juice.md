<p>1.5 cups of lime juice equals 12 fluid ounces (or approximately 340 grams). This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precision ensures the perfect balance of flavours. Whether you’re making a tangy marinade or a refreshing dessert, knowing how to convert cups to ounces is a game-changer.</p>

<h2>Why accurate lime juice measurements matter</h2>
<p>Using the right amount of lime juice can make or break your air fryer dish. Too little, and your recipe might lack zest; too much, and it could become overpowering. For example, a <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>lime-infused chicken recipe</a> relies on the perfect ratio of citrus to other ingredients. Measuring 1.5 cups of lime juice correctly ensures consistency every time.</p>
<p>Lime juice is often used in marinades, dressings, and even baked goods. If you’re preparing a <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>citrus dessert</a>, the difference between 10 and 12 ounces could affect texture and taste. Always use a liquid measuring cup for accuracy, and double-check conversions if you’re scaling recipes up or down.</p>

<h2>How to measure lime juice for air fryer recipes</h2>
<p>When converting 1.5 cups of lime juice to ounces, it’s important to note that fluid ounces measure volume, not weight. For most liquids, 1 cup equals 8 fluid ounces, so 1.5 cups would be 12 fluid ounces. However, if you’re using a kitchen scale, 12 fluid ounces of lime juice weighs roughly 340 grams.</p>
<p>If you don’t have a measuring cup handy, you can use a standard drinking glass as a rough guide—just remember it’s not as precise. For best results, invest in a <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a> to keep your measurements accurate across all your air fryer recipes.</p>

<h3>Common uses for 1.5 cups of lime juice</h3>
<p>This quantity of lime juice is perfect for batch cooking or meal prep. You might use it for a large <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>citrus chicken dish</a>, a zesty salad dressing, or even a lime-infused cake. The air fryer excels at locking in flavours, so precise measurements help maximise taste.</p>

<h2>Converting other citrus juices</h2>
<p>The same conversion applies to other citrus juices like lemon or orange. If a recipe calls for 1.5 cups of lemon juice, that’s also 12 fluid ounces. However, always consider the acidity levels—lime juice is typically more tart than lemon, so adjustments might be needed.</p>
<p>For those who love experimenting, try substituting lime juice in <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/seafood>seafood recipes</a>. The bright acidity pairs beautifully with shrimp or white fish in the air fryer. Just remember to stick to the 1.5 cups (12 ounces) measurement for consistency.</p>

<h3>Tips for storing lime juice</h3>
<p>Fresh lime juice is best, but if you’re using bottled, ensure it’s pure juice without additives. Store any leftover juice in an airtight container in the fridge for up to a week. For longer storage, freeze it in ice cube trays—each cube is roughly 1 ounce, making future measurements a breeze.</p>

<p>0.5 tbsp of sesame oil weighs approximately 6.5 grams. This measurement is crucial for air fryer recipes where precision ensures perfect texture and flavour. Whether you’re making crispy stir-fries or marinating proteins, knowing the exact weight helps avoid oily or dry results. For more conversions, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>

<h2>Why accurate sesame oil measurements matter</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of sesame oil in your air fryer can make or break a dish. Too little, and your food lacks depth; too much, and it becomes greasy. Sesame oil has a strong flavour, so 0.5 tbsp (6.5g) is often enough for marinades or dressings. Many <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> call for small quantities to enhance taste without overpowering. Always measure carefully to achieve restaurant-quality results at home.</p>  

<p>For those who love Asian-inspired dishes, sesame oil is a staple. A precise 0.5 tbsp (6.5g) can elevate stir-fried vegetables or glazed chicken wings. If you’re experimenting with new flavours, start with this amount and adjust to taste. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipe category</a> features plenty of ideas to put your measurement skills to use.</p>  

<h2>How to measure 0.5 tbsp sesame oil correctly</h2>  
<p>Measuring small amounts like 0.5 tbsp can be tricky without the right tools. Use a graduated measuring spoon or a digital kitchen scale for accuracy. Pour slowly to avoid spills, especially when working with sticky oils like sesame. If you don’t have a 0.5 tbsp measure, half a standard UK tablespoon (15ml) will do. For more tips, explore our guide on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning air fryers</a> after oily recipes.</p>  

<h3>Converting other sesame oil quantities</h3>  
<p>If your recipe calls for larger amounts, here’s a quick reference: 1 tbsp sesame oil = 13g, while 1 tsp equals about 4.3g. These conversions are handy when scaling recipes up or down. Bookmark <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> for all your air fryer measurement needs, from oils to spices.</p>  

<h2>Sesame oil substitutes in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>If you’re out of sesame oil, try peanut or avocado oil at a 1:1 ratio—though flavours will differ. For lighter dishes, a 0.5 tbsp (6.5g) drizzle of olive oil works too. Remember, sesame oil’s nutty taste is unique, so substitutes may alter your dish’s profile. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable recipes</a> showcase how different oils affect outcomes.</p>  

<h3>Storing sesame oil for freshness</h3>  
<p>To preserve sesame oil’s quality, keep it in a cool, dark place. Once opened, use within 6 months for best flavour. Rancid oil can ruin even perfectly measured 0.5 tbsp portions. For long-term storage, refrigerate and bring to room temperature before use.</p>

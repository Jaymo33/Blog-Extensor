<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on precise cooking times and ingredient quantities to deliver crispy, evenly cooked results. Fish sauce, with its strong flavour, requires careful measurement—too much can overpower a dish, while too little might leave it lacking depth. Converting 30g of fish sauce to ounces (1.06 oz) helps maintain balance in recipes like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer marinades</a> or dipping sauces. This accuracy is especially important when scaling recipes up or down, ensuring consistency every time you cook.</p>  

<p>Many UK home cooks prefer using grams for dry ingredients and millilitres for liquids, but some recipes still reference ounces. Understanding how to convert 30g of fish sauce to ounces bridges this gap, making it easier to follow international recipes or older cookbooks. If you're working with other sauces or marinades, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipe category</a> offers plenty of ideas where precise fish sauce measurements come in handy.</p>  

<h3>Tools for converting 30g fish sauce to ounces</h3>

Keep in mind that 30 grams of fish sauce is roughly two UK tablespoons, but weights can vary slightly depending on the brand's density.</p>

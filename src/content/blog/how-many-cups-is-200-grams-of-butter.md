<p>200 grams of butter is roughly equivalent to 0.88 cups (just under 1 cup) in standard US measurements. If you're using UK measurements, it's closer to 0.85 cups due to slight differences in cup sizes. Getting this conversion right is especially important for air fryer recipes, where precise measurements can make or break your dish.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Butter Measurements Matter</h2>
<p>When cooking or baking in your air fryer, precise measurements ensure consistent results. Too much butter can make dishes greasy, while too little may leave them dry. For example, if you're making air fryer cookies from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, the right butter ratio is crucial for texture and flavour. Using 200 grams of butter instead of the correct cup measurement could throw off the entire recipe.</p>
<p>Butter density can vary slightly depending on temperature and brand, but 200 grams is a common measurement in many recipes. Whether you're following a European recipe that uses grams or an American one that uses cups, knowing this conversion helps you adapt seamlessly. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more handy measurement swaps.</p>

<h2>Converting 200 Grams of Butter to Cups</h2>
<p>To convert 200 grams of butter to cups, you'll need to know that 1 cup of butter typically weighs around 227 grams. This means 200 grams is just shy of a full cup. For most practical purposes, you can use 7/8 cup or 0.88 cups as a close approximation. If you don't have measuring cups, 200 grams is also equal to about 14 tablespoons.</p>
<p>If you're working with UK measurements, where 1 cup is 250ml, 200 grams of butter equals roughly 0.85 cups. This small difference usually won't affect most air fryer recipes, but for precision baking, it's worth noting. Many of our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>air fryer cake recipes</a> specify both gram and cup measurements to avoid confusion.</p>

<h3>Measuring Without Scales</h3>
<p>If you don't have kitchen scales, you can still measure 200 grams of butter using the markings on the wrapper. Standard butter blocks often have tablespoon markings - 200 grams equals about 14 tablespoons. Alternatively, use the displacement method: fill a measuring cup with water to the 200ml mark, add butter until the water reaches 400ml, and you'll have roughly 200 grams.</p>

<h2>Butter Conversions for Different Recipes</h2>
<p>When adapting recipes for your air fryer, understanding butter conversions opens up a world of possibilities. Whether you're making savoury dishes from our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipe collection</a> or sweet treats, knowing that 200 grams equals about 0.88 cups helps you recreate international recipes with confidence.</p>
<p>The type of butter matters too - European-style butters often have higher fat content, which might slightly affect measurements. For most standard butters available in UK supermarkets, the 200g to 0.88 cup conversion holds true. If you're using spreadable butter, it's best to weigh it for accuracy as the added oils can change the density.</p>

<h3>Storing Butter for Air Fryer Cooking</h3>
<p>Proper butter storage ensures accurate measurements. Keep butter refrigerated and bring it to room temperature before measuring for baking recipes. If you need to quickly soften butter for your air fryer recipes, cut it into small cubes - they'll reach room temperature faster and be easier to measure accurately.</p>

<h2>Common Butter Measurement Mistakes</h2>
<p>One frequent error is packing butter into measuring cups, which can lead to using too much. Instead, spoon softened butter into the cup and level it off. Another mistake is using liquid measuring cups for butter - always use dry measuring cups for solids. These small details make a big difference in air fryer cooking, where precise ratios affect cooking times and results.</p>
<p>Remember that butter measurements can vary by country. American recipes typically use 227g per cup, while some international recipes might use 200g or 250g per cup. When in doubt, stick to weight measurements for accuracy. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> team always recommends weighing ingredients when possible for the best air fryer results.</p>

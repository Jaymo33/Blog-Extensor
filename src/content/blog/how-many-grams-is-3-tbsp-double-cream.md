<p>3 tablespoons (tbsp) of double cream equals approximately 45 grams (g). This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precision matters, whether you're whipping up a creamy sauce or baking a rich dessert. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we know accurate measurements can make or break a dish, so let’s dive deeper into how to measure double cream correctly.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on precise ingredient ratios to ensure even cooking and perfect textures. Too much or too little double cream can affect the consistency of batters, sauces, or baked goods. For example, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>creamy garlic mushroom recipe</a> requires exact measurements to achieve the right richness. Using 45 grams of double cream for 3 tbsp ensures your dish turns out as intended.</p>  

<p>Double cream is thicker than single cream, with a fat content of around 48%. This density means it weighs slightly more per tablespoon compared to lighter creams. If you’re substituting or scaling recipes, always check our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for reliable measurements.</p>  

<h3>How to measure double cream without scales</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have kitchen scales, use standard UK tablespoons (15ml each) and level them off for accuracy. Three slightly heaped tablespoons will roughly equal 45 grams. For recipes like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>decadent air fryer desserts</a>, this method works well in a pinch.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for 3 tbsp of double cream in air fryer recipes</h2>  
<p>Three tablespoons (45g) of double cream is a versatile quantity. It’s perfect for enriching scrambled eggs, creating a silky pasta sauce, or adding moisture to cakes. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipe collection</a> includes dishes like creamy chicken thighs or indulgent bread pudding where this measurement shines.</p>  

<p>For savoury dishes, 45 grams of double cream balances acidity in tomato-based sauces or adds depth to mashed potatoes. In desserts, it helps achieve a luscious texture in custards or mousses. Always store leftover cream properly—check our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning guide</a> to keep your air fryer grease-free after cooking with dairy.</p>  

<h3>Converting other cream measurements to grams</h3>  
<p>If your recipe calls for a different amount, here’s a quick reference: 1 tbsp = 15g, 2 tbsp = 30g, and 4 tbsp = 60g. These conversions apply to UK double cream specifically—single cream or whipped variants may differ slightly in weight.</p>

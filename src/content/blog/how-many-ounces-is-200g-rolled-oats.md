<p>Rolled oats are a staple in breakfast dishes like baked oats or energy bars. If a recipe calls for 200g and your scales only show ounces, this conversion saves the day.

<h2>How to Measure 200g of Rolled Oats Without Scales</h2>  
<p>No scales? No problem. While weighing is ideal, you can approximate 200g of rolled oats using volume. One packed cup of rolled oats weighs roughly 80g, so 2.5 cups equal 200g (or 7.05 oz). Note that this method is less precise—oat density varies based on how they’re packed. For air fryer recipes like crumbles or flapjacks, slight variations might affect texture.

<h2>Common Mistakes When Measuring Rolled Oats</h2>

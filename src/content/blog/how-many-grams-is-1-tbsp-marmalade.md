<p>1 tablespoon (tbsp) of marmalade weighs approximately 20 grams in the UK. This measurement is essential for air fryer recipes where precision ensures the perfect balance of sweetness and texture. Whether you’re glazing meats or baking desserts, knowing the exact weight helps avoid soggy or overly dry results. For more air fryer conversions, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on hot, circulating air to cook food evenly, and incorrect measurements can throw off the entire dish. Too much marmalade can make food sticky or burn, while too little might leave it lacking flavour. Using grams instead of volume measurements (like tablespoons) ensures consistency, especially when adapting recipes from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>our collection</a>.</p>  
<p>For example, if a recipe calls for 40 grams of marmalade, you’ll know that’s exactly 2 tablespoons. This precision is particularly useful for baking air fryer cakes or glazing chicken wings. A digital kitchen scale is the best tool for this, but if you don’t have one, our conversion guide will help.</p>  

<h3>How to measure marmalade without a scale</h3>  
<p>If you don’t own a scale, use a standard UK tablespoon (15ml) and level it off with a knife for an accurate 20-gram portion. Chunky marmalade may vary slightly, so stir it first to distribute the fruit evenly. For sticky ingredients like marmalade, lightly greasing the spoon can help it slide off cleanly.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for marmalade in air fryer recipes</h2>  
<p>Marmalade isn’t just for toast—it’s a versatile ingredient in air fryer cooking. It works as a glaze for meats like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken</a> or pork, adds sweetness to baked goods, and even enhances sauces. Since air fryers cook quickly, the sugar in marmalade caramelises beautifully without burning if measured correctly.</p>  
<p>Try brushing 20 grams (1 tbsp) of marmalade over salmon fillets before air frying for a glossy, tangy finish. Or mix it with mustard for a quick glaze on sausages. For dessert, swirl it into <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>air fryer cakes</a> or drizzle it over baked brie.</p>  

<h3>Adjusting recipes for different marmalade types</h3>  
<p>Thick-cut marmalade may weigh slightly more per tablespoon due to larger fruit pieces, while smooth varieties could be closer to 18 grams. If adapting a recipe, start with less and adjust to taste. Always check labels for added sugars, as this affects weight and cooking behaviour.</p>  

<h2>Converting other marmalade measurements</h2>  
<p>Need larger quantities? Here’s a quick guide: 1 teaspoon (tsp) ≈ 7 grams, 50 grams ≈ 2.5 tbsp, and 100 grams ≈ 5 tbsp. Bookmark our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a> for easy reference. Remember, UK and US tablespoons differ slightly (UK: 15ml, US: 14.8ml), but the gram weight remains consistent for marmalade.</p>  
<p>Cleaning sticky marmalade from your air fryer? Soak the basket in warm water and use our recommended <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner</a> to remove residue without scratching surfaces.</p>

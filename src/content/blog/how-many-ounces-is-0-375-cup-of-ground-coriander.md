<p>0.375 cup of ground coriander equals approximately 1.5 ounces (oz). This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements ensure perfect results every time. Whether you're following a recipe from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> or improvising, knowing how to convert cups to ounces is a game-changer.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Using the correct amount of ground coriander can make or break your dish. Too little, and the flavour falls flat; too much, and it overpowers other ingredients. The air fryer’s intense heat means spices like coriander need to be measured precisely for balanced results. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for other common ingredient conversions.</p>  

<p>Ground coriander is a staple in many air fryer recipes, from marinades to rubs. If you’re working with 0.375 cup, knowing it’s 1.5 oz helps streamline prep. For more recipe ideas, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipes</a>, where coriander often shines.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure Ground Coriander Correctly</h3>  
<p>For accuracy, use a kitchen scale to weigh 0.375 cup of ground coriander. If you don’t have one, spoon the spice into a measuring cup and level it off. Avoid packing it down, as this can lead to over-measuring. Precision ensures your air fryer dishes turn out just right.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for 0.375 Cup of Ground Coriander</h2>  
<p>This amount is perfect for seasoning larger batches of food. Think air-fried chicken thighs, spiced vegetables, or even homemade falafel. Ground coriander adds warmth and depth, making it a favourite in global cuisines. Visit <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>our recipe hub</a> for inspiration.</p>  

<p>If you’re prepping meal components like marinades or dry rubs, 0.375 cup (1.5 oz) of ground coriander goes a long way. Pair it with cumin and paprika for a smoky kick, or mix it with yoghurt for a tenderising marinade. The air fryer locks in these flavours beautifully.</p>  

<h3>Converting Other Spice Measurements</h3>  
<p>Need to convert different amounts? A general rule is that 1 cup of ground coriander weighs about 4 oz. So, 0.375 cup is roughly a third of that. Bookmark our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a> for quick reference mid-recipe.</p>  

<h2>Tips for Storing Ground Coriander</h2>  
<p>Keep your ground coriander fresh by storing it in an airtight container away from heat and light. Proper storage ensures the spice retains its flavour, whether you’re using 0.375 cup or a pinch. For more kitchen organisation tips, check our guide on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>keeping your air fryer spotless</a>.</p>  

<p>Buying in bulk? Measure out 0.375 cup (1.5 oz) portions and store them separately for easy access. This saves time and keeps your spice drawer tidy. Freshness matters, especially when cooking with an air fryer’s high heat.</p>

<p>535 ml of lemon juice equals approximately 2.26 cups. This conversion is essential for recipes where precise measurements matter, especially when using an air fryer for dishes like lemon chicken or citrus-glazed desserts. Whether you're following a British or American recipe, knowing how to convert 535 ml of lemon juice to cups ensures your dish turns out perfectly every time.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Lemon Juice Measurements Matter</h2>
<p>Getting the right amount of lemon juice can make or break a recipe. Too little, and your dish might lack brightness; too much, and it could become overpoweringly tart. When using an air fryer, precise measurements are even more critical because the cooking process intensifies flavours. For example, a lemon drizzle cake made in an air fryer requires exactly 535 ml of lemon juice (or 2.26 cups) to achieve the perfect balance of sweetness and acidity.</p>
<p>Many air fryer recipes, like those on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes</a>, call for lemon juice as a marinade or glaze. Having a reliable conversion from millilitres to cups means you can adapt any recipe with confidence. This is particularly useful when preparing dishes like lemon garlic shrimp or citrus-infused roasted vegetables, where the acidity needs to be just right.</p>

<h2>How to Measure 535 ml of Lemon Juice</h2>
<p>If you don't have a measuring jug with millilitre markings, you can still measure 535 ml of lemon juice accurately using cups. Since 1 cup equals 236.588 ml, you'll need just over 2 cups (specifically 2.26 cups) for 535 ml. For best results, use a liquid measuring cup rather than dry measuring cups, as the spout makes pouring easier and reduces spills.</p>

<h3>Tips for Measuring Lemon Juice</h3>
<p>Freshly squeezed lemon juice is always preferable for flavour, but bottled lemon juice works in a pinch. If using fresh lemons, note that one medium lemon yields about 50 ml of juice, so you'll need roughly 11 lemons for 535 ml. For air fryer recipes, like those in our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken category</a>, freshly squeezed juice can elevate the dish significantly.</p>

<h2>Converting 535 ml of Lemon Juice in Different Countries</h2>
<p>While the UK and US use slightly different cup measurements, the difference is minimal for practical purposes. In the UK, 1 cup is 250 ml, making 535 ml equal to 2.14 cups. In the US, where 1 cup is 240 ml, 535 ml equals 2.23 cups. For most air fryer recipes, this small variance won't affect the outcome, but it's good to be aware of the difference if precision is crucial.</p>
<p>If you're working with a recipe from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>our conversion chart</a>, you'll find that 535 ml of lemon juice translates consistently to about 2 1/4 cups. This measurement works perfectly for everything from lemon curd to salad dressings prepared in your air fryer.</p>

<h2>Using 535 ml of Lemon Juice in Air Fryer Recipes</h2>
<p>Lemon juice is incredibly versatile in air fryer cooking. From tenderising meats to adding zing to vegetables, 535 ml (2.26 cups) can go a long way. Try using this amount in a marinade for air fryer chicken thighs, or mix it with olive oil and herbs for a vibrant dressing. The acidity helps create beautiful caramelisation while keeping foods moist during the air frying process.</p>
<p>For dessert lovers, 535 ml of lemon juice makes enough curd for several batches of air fryer tarts or a generous lemon glaze for cakes. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert recipes</a> for inspiration on how to use this quantity effectively. Remember, proper measurement ensures your sweet treats have just the right balance of tart and sweet.</p>

<h3>Storing Leftover Lemon Juice</h3>
<p>If you don't use all 535 ml at once, store the remaining juice in an airtight container in the fridge for up to a week. For longer storage, freeze the juice in ice cube trays - each cube holds about 30 ml, making it easy to portion out for future air fryer recipes. This way, you'll always have lemon juice ready when inspiration strikes.</p>

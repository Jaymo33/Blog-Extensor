<h2>Why Convert Cups to Ounces for Cooked Rice?</h2>  
<p>Measuring rice by weight (ounces) rather than volume (cups) ensures precision, especially in air fryer cooking. Rice density can vary based on grain type and cooking method, making weight a more reliable metric. For example, 1.33 cups of fluffy jasmine rice may weigh slightly less than sticky sushi rice. If you’re preparing <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/meal-prep>meal prep recipes</a>, weighing ingredients avoids guesswork and guarantees consistency.</p>  

<p>Air fryers excel at reheating rice, but portion control is key to avoiding dry or uneven results. A 10.6-ounce portion fits perfectly in most air fryer baskets, crisping up without overcrowding. For best results, spread the rice evenly and lightly spray with oil.

<h3>How to Measure 1.33 Cups of Cooked Rice Accurately</h3>  
<p>Use a kitchen scale for the most accurate conversion of 1.33 cups to ounces. Fluff the rice with a fork before lightly spooning it into a measuring cup—avoid packing it down.

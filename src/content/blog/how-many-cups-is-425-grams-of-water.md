<p>425 grams of water equals approximately 1.8 cups (using the UK metric cup measurement of 250ml per cup). This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes, where precise liquid measurements can impact texture and cooking times. Whether you're making sauces, batters, or steaming ingredients, knowing how to convert grams to cups ensures consistency in your dishes.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Water Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of water in air fryer recipes can make or break your dish. Too much liquid can lead to soggy results, while too little might dry out your food. For example, when making air fryer steamed vegetables or a light batter for crispy coatings, 425 grams of water (or 1.8 cups) is a common measurement. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more handy measurement swaps.</p>  

<p>Many air fryer recipes, like those for cakes or steamed puddings, rely on precise water ratios. If you're adapting a traditional recipe for your air fryer, converting grams to cups correctly ensures your dish turns out perfectly.

<h3>UK vs. US Cup Measurements</h3>  
<p>It’s worth noting that UK and US cup measurements differ slightly. In the UK, 1 cup equals 250ml, while in the US, it’s 240ml. For 425 grams of water, this means roughly 1.8 UK cups or 1.77 US cups—a small but sometimes crucial difference in baking. Always double-check which measurement system your recipe uses.</p>  

<h2>How to Measure 425 Grams of Water Without Scales</h2>  
<p>If you don’t have kitchen scales, you can still measure 425 grams of water accurately using a measuring jug. Since 1ml of water weighs 1 gram, 425 grams is equivalent to 425ml. Fill your jug to the 425ml mark, and you’ve got the perfect amount for your air fryer recipe.

<p>Another handy trick is using common household items. A standard UK mug holds about 250ml (1 cup), so 425 grams would be just under two mugfuls. This method is great for quick adjustments when you’re mid-recipe. Need cleaning tips after cooking?

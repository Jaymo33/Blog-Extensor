<p>15g of plain flour equals approximately 0.53 ounces. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements can make or break your dish. Whether you're baking air fryer cakes or coating chicken, knowing how to convert grams to ounces ensures consistency. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we help simplify these conversions so you can focus on cooking.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate flour measurements matter</h2>  
<p>Using the correct amount of plain flour is crucial for air fryer recipes. Too much flour can make your dish dry, while too little may affect texture. For example, air fryer cookies or cakes rely on precise ratios. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> makes it easy to switch between metric and imperial measurements. This ensures your recipes turn out perfectly every time.</p>  

<p>Many UK recipes use grams, but some cooks prefer ounces. Converting 15g of plain flour to ounces (0.53 oz) helps when following international recipes. Whether you're making air fryer bread or coating fish, accurate measurements matter. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a> for more inspiration on using plain flour in your air fryer.</p>  

<h2>How to measure 15g of plain flour</h2>  
<p>Measuring 15g of plain flour accurately is simple with the right tools. A digital kitchen scale is the most precise method. If you don’t have one, use a measuring spoon—15g is roughly two level tablespoons. For best results, fluff the flour before scooping to avoid compacting it. This ensures your air fryer dishes, like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>air fryer cakes</a>, turn out light and fluffy.</p>  

<h3>Converting other flour amounts</h3>  
<p>If your recipe calls for more or less flour, the same conversion principle applies. For example, 30g of plain flour equals about 1.06 ounces. Keep our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a> handy for quick reference. This is especially useful for baking in your air fryer, where precision is key.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for 15g of plain flour</h2>  
<p>15g of plain flour is often used for light coatings or small batches. It’s perfect for dusting fish fillets or thickening sauces in your air fryer. You might also use it for making air fryer pancakes or as a binder in meatballs. Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable recipes</a> for creative ways to use small amounts of flour.</p>

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on precise ingredient ratios to achieve the perfect texture and flavour. Too much or too little baking soda can affect the rise of cakes or the crispiness of batters. That’s why converting 0.5 tbsp of baking soda to grams is so important. A slight miscalculation could lead to dense or overly airy results. For foolproof recipes, always measure ingredients by weight when possible.</p>  

<p>Many UK bakers prefer using grams for accuracy, as tablespoon measurements can vary slightly depending on how the ingredient is scooped. Baking soda, in particular, can compact or fluff up, making volume measurements less reliable. If you’re experimenting with <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>air fryer cakes</a>, sticking to grams will give you better consistency.</p>  

<h3>How to measure 0.5 tbsp of baking soda correctly</h3>  
<p>To measure 0.5 tbsp of baking soda, use a proper measuring spoon and level it off with a straight edge. Avoid packing the baking soda down, as this can lead to using more than intended. For the most accurate results, weigh it on a kitchen scale—7 grams is your target. If you don’t have a scale, fluff the baking soda first before lightly spooning it into the measuring spoon.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for 0.5 tbsp of baking soda in air fryer recipes</h2>  
<p>Half a tablespoon of baking soda is often used in small-batch air fryer recipes, such as mini cakes or batters for fried foods. It helps with browning and crispiness, which is why it’s a staple in many <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a>. From onion rings to tempura veggies, the right amount ensures a light, crispy coating.</p>  

<p>Baking soda also neutralises acidity in recipes like buttermilk-based batters, helping them rise better in the air fryer’s concentrated heat. If you’re making <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cookies>air fryer cookies</a>, 0.5 tbsp (7g) of baking soda can make them spread just right without becoming too dense. Always check your recipe’s requirements to avoid over- or under-measuring.</p>  

<h3>Converting other baking soda measurements</h3>  
<p>If your recipe calls for a different amount, here’s a quick reference: 1 tbsp of baking soda equals about 14 grams, while 1 tsp is roughly 4.7 grams. These conversions are handy when scaling recipes up or down for your air fryer.

<h2>Tips for storing baking soda for air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>To keep your baking soda fresh and effective, store it in an airtight container away from moisture. Humidity can cause clumping, making it harder to measure 0.5 tbsp accurately. If you notice it’s lost its fizz when mixed with vinegar, it’s time to replace it. Proper storage ensures your <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner</a> and recipes work as intended.</p>  

<p>For best results, buy baking soda in smaller quantities if you don’t use it often. This prevents it from losing potency over time. Always check the expiry date, as old baking soda won’t leaven properly, affecting your air fryer bakes. Keeping it fresh means your 0.5 tbsp (7g) measurements will always deliver the right rise and texture.</p>

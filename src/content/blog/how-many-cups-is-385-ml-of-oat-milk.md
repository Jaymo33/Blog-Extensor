<p>385 ml of oat milk is approximately 1.63 cups in the US measurement system and 1.52 cups in the UK measurement system. Whether you're whipping up a cake or preparing a creamy sauce in your air fryer, knowing this conversion ensures your recipes turn out perfectly. Oat milk has become a staple in many kitchens, especially for those who prefer plant-based alternatives. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we understand the importance of accurate measurements for flawless results.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of oat milk can make or break your dish. Too much liquid can lead to soggy textures, while too little might dry out your food. This is especially crucial when using an air fryer, where precise ratios affect cooking times and crispiness. For example, a batter that’s too thin won’t coat chicken properly, while a thick one might not crisp up as desired.

Whether you're making pancakes or a creamy pasta sauce, 385 ml of oat milk should be measured correctly to avoid kitchen mishaps. A slight variation might not seem like much, but it can alter the final outcome significantly.</p>  

<h3>US vs. UK Cup Measurements</h3>  
<p>The difference between US and UK cup measurements can be confusing. In the US, 1 cup equals 240 ml, while in the UK, it’s 250 ml. This means 385 ml of oat milk translates to roughly 1.63 US cups or 1.52 UK cups. If you're following a recipe from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert category</a>, double-check which measurement system it uses to avoid errors.</p>  

<h2>How to Measure 385 ml of Oat Milk Without a Measuring Cup</h2>  
<p>Don’t have a measuring cup? No problem! You can use a standard mug or glass to estimate 385 ml of oat milk. A typical UK mug holds about 284 ml, so filling it just over halfway will get you close. Alternatively, use a kitchen scale—oat milk weighs roughly 1 gram per ml, so 385 grams equals 385 ml.

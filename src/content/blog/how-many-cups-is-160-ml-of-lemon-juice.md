<p>160 ml of lemon juice equals approximately 2/3 of a standard US cup or just over half a UK metric cup. This conversion is handy for air fryer recipes, where precise measurements can make all the difference. Whether you’re whipping up a zesty marinade or a tangy dessert, knowing how to convert 160 ml of lemon juice to cups ensures your dish turns out perfectly every time.</p>

<h2>Understanding Lemon Juice Measurements</h2>
<p>Lemon juice is a common ingredient in many air fryer recipes, from glazes to dressings. Measuring it accurately is key, especially since acidity can affect cooking times and flavours. A US cup holds 240 ml, so 160 ml of lemon juice is roughly 2/3 of a cup. In the UK, a metric cup is 250 ml, making 160 ml just over half a cup. This small difference matters when scaling recipes or adjusting flavours.</p>
<p>For air fryer cooking, precision ensures even cooking and balanced tastes. If you’re using a recipe from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, check whether it follows US or UK measurements. Many recipes on the site, like those in the <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert category</a>, rely on accurate liquid measurements for perfect results.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Conversions Matter</h2>
<p>In air fryer cooking, too much or too little lemon juice can alter texture and taste. For example, a marinade with 160 ml of lemon juice might need adjusting if the recipe calls for 3/4 cup. Using 2/3 cup instead keeps the acidity balanced, preventing over-tartness. This is especially important for dishes like air-fried lemon chicken or citrus-glazed salmon.</p>
<p>If you’re unsure about conversions, refer to the <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for quick reference. It’s a lifesaver when adapting recipes or experimenting with new flavours. For more inspiration, browse the <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipes section</a> for dishes that use lemon juice creatively.</p>

<h3>Tools for Measuring Lemon Juice</h3>
<p>A liquid measuring cup is the best tool for measuring 160 ml of lemon juice. Glass or plastic cups with clear ml and cup markings make it easy to get the right amount. For smaller quantities, a kitchen scale can also help, as 160 ml of lemon juice weighs roughly 160 grams. Avoid using dry measuring cups, as they won’t give you an accurate liquid measurement.</p>

<h3>Adjusting Recipes for Your Air Fryer</h3>
<p>When converting traditional oven recipes for your air fryer, liquid measurements like 160 ml of lemon juice may need tweaking. Air fryers cook faster, so reducing liquids slightly can prevent sogginess. For example, if a recipe calls for 1 cup of lemon juice, try 160 ml (2/3 cup) instead. This ensures a crispier finish, especially for dishes like lemon-glazed tofu or citrus-infused veggies.</p>

<h2>Common Uses for 160 ml of Lemon Juice</h2>
<p>160 ml of lemon juice is a versatile amount for many air fryer dishes. It’s enough for a tangy marinade for chicken or fish, a zesty glaze for desserts, or a refreshing dressing for salads. You could also use it in <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>lemon cake recipes</a>, where acidity helps activate baking soda for a light, fluffy texture.</p>
<p>For cleaning your air fryer, a mix of 160 ml lemon juice and water can help remove grease and odours. Check out the <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner guide</a> for more natural cleaning tips. Lemon juice’s acidity makes it a great natural cleaner, leaving your appliance fresh and ready for the next recipe.</p>

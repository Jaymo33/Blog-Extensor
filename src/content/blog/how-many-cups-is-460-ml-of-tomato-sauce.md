<p>460 ml of tomato sauce is roughly equivalent to 1.94 cups in the US or 1.62 cups in the UK. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes, ensuring your dishes turn out perfectly every time. Whether you're making pasta sauce, casseroles, or marinades, getting the measurement right makes all the difference. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we know precision matters, so let’s dive into the details.</p>  

<h2>Understanding Cup Measurements for Tomato Sauce</h2>  
<p>Tomato sauce is a staple in many dishes, from lasagne to meatballs, and measuring it correctly ensures balanced flavours. In the US, 1 cup equals 240 ml, while the UK uses 284 ml per cup. This means 460 ml converts to approximately 1.94 US cups or 1.62 UK cups. If you're using an air fryer, slight variations can affect cooking times, so accuracy is key. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more handy tips.</p>  

<p>For thicker sauces, like passata or purée, the volume may differ slightly due to density. Always measure tomato sauce in a liquid measuring cup for the best results. If you're scaling a recipe, remember that 460 ml of tomato sauce is just under 2 US cups, making it easy to adjust. Need recipe ideas? Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> for inspiration.</p>  

<h3>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h3>  
<p>Air fryers cook food faster than conventional ovens, so precise measurements prevent over or under-seasoning. Too much tomato sauce can make dishes soggy, while too little may dry them out. Whether you're making <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipes</a> or vegetable bakes, 460 ml of tomato sauce should be measured carefully. A slight error could alter cooking times or texture.</p>  

<h2>Converting 460 ml of Tomato Sauce for Different Recipes</h2>  
<p>If you're adapting a recipe from metric to cups, knowing 460 ml equals roughly 1.94 US cups helps streamline the process. For UK cooks, it’s closer to 1.62 cups. This conversion is useful for dishes like shakshuka, pizza sauce, or even <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable stews</a>. Always level off your measuring cup for consistency.</p>  

<p>Some recipes call for "cups" without specifying US or UK measurements. In such cases, default to US cups (240 ml) unless the recipe originates from the UK. For air fryer cooking, thicker sauces may require slight adjustments—460 ml of tomato sauce could reduce slightly during cooking. Keep an eye on your dish and stir occasionally for even results.</p>  

<h3>Tips for Measuring Tomato Sauce Without a Cup</h3>  
<p>No measuring cup? Use a kitchen scale—460 ml of tomato sauce weighs about 460 grams. Alternatively, a standard UK mug holds roughly 300 ml, so 460 ml would be just over 1.5 mugs. For air fryer recipes, consistency matters, so avoid eyeballing if possible. Need to clean sticky sauce residue?

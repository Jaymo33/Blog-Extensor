<p>5 tablespoons of wholemeal flour weigh approximately 40 grams. This conversion is essential for precise baking, especially when using an air fryer for recipes like muffins or bread. Understanding these measurements ensures consistency and perfect results every time.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate flour measurements matter</h2>  
<p>Baking is a science, and even small measurement discrepancies can affect texture and rise. Wholemeal flour, being denser than white flour, requires careful weighing for best results. Whether you’re making air fryer cakes or bread, 5 tbsp of wholemeal flour to grams should be exact. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more handy measurements.</p>

<h3>How to measure wholemeal flour correctly</h3>  
<p>To convert 5 tbsp of wholemeal flour into grams accurately, fluff the flour first with a fork before spooning it into the tablespoon. Level it off with a knife for consistency. This method prevents compacting, which can lead to using more flour than intended.</p>

<p>Wholemeal flour adds fibre and nutrients to baked goods. If you’re making muffins or scones in the air fryer, 5 tbsp of wholemeal flour in grams ensures the right balance without making them too dense.</p>  

<h3>Converting other flour amounts</h3>

<h2>Tips for baking with wholemeal flour</h2>  
<p>Wholemeal flour absorbs more liquid than white flour, so you may need to adjust wet ingredients slightly. When using 5 tablespoon wholemeal flour UK grams in air fryer recipes, consider adding a touch more moisture for the perfect texture.</p>

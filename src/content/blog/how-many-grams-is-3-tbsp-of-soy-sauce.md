For marinades applied beforehand, the quantity remains unchanged. Always measure ingredients pre-cooking for consistent results."

<p>3 tablespoons of soy sauce weigh approximately 45 grams. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements can make or break a dish. Whether you're marinating chicken or glazing salmon, knowing the exact weight ensures consistent results every time. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we understand the importance of accuracy, especially when working with bold flavours like soy sauce.</p>

<h2>Why measuring soy sauce in grams matters</h2>  
<p>Using grams instead of tablespoons guarantees consistency, especially in air fryer cooking where even small variations can affect texture and taste. Soy sauce is a key ingredient in many Asian-inspired dishes, from stir-fries to glazes. If you're preparing a recipe like teriyaki chicken or honey-soy salmon, precise measurements ensure the perfect balance of salty and sweet. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipes section</a> for more ideas that use soy sauce effectively.</p>  

<p>Many UK cooks prefer weighing ingredients for better accuracy, as tablespoon sizes can vary slightly. A digital kitchen scale is a must-have tool for anyone serious about air fryer cooking. If you're new to converting measurements, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> makes it simple to switch between volume and weight.</p>  

<h3>How to measure soy sauce accurately</h3>  
<p>For the most precise measurement, use a digital scale set to grams. Pour the soy sauce directly into a small bowl or container on the scale until it reaches 45 grams. If you don't have scales, use a standard UK tablespoon (15ml) and level it off for consistency. Remember that soy sauce's viscosity means it clings to measuring spoons, so slight variations are normal.</p>  

<h2>Common recipes using 3 tbsp soy sauce</h2>  
<p>Many popular air fryer dishes call for exactly 3 tablespoons of soy sauce. This quantity works perfectly for marinades serving 2-4 people or as a base for sauces. Try it in our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipes</a>, where soy sauce adds depth to crispy wings or sticky drumsticks. The 45-gram measurement ensures the salt content balances perfectly with other ingredients.</p>  

<p>Vegetarian cooks can use this amount in tofu marinades or vegetable stir-fries. The umami-rich flavour enhances mushrooms and aubergines beautifully. For seafood lovers, 3 tbsp (45g) of soy sauce makes an excellent glaze for salmon or prawns. Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/mixed-seafood>mixed seafood collection</a> for inspiration.</p>  

<h3>Adjusting recipes based on soy sauce brands</h3>  
<p>Different soy sauce brands vary in saltiness and thickness. Light soy sauce typically weighs slightly less per tablespoon than dark varieties. If substituting brands, taste as you go - you might need to adjust other seasonings. Keeping your air fryer clean is also crucial when working with sticky ingredients like soy sauce - our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning guide</a> has handy tips.</p>  

<h2>Converting other soy sauce measurements</h2>  
<p>Once you know 3 tbsp equals 45 grams, scaling recipes becomes straightforward. Need half the amount? That's 1.5 tbsp or 22.5 grams. Doubling a recipe? You'll want 6 tbsp or 90 grams of soy sauce. This flexibility is why weight measurements are favoured by professional chefs and home cooks alike.</p>  

<p>For those who prefer metric measurements, remembering that 1 tablespoon of soy sauce equals 15 grams simplifies calculations. This conversion works for most liquid ingredients in air fryer cooking, from oils to vinegar.

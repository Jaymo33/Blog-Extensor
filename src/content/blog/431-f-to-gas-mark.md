<p>431°F converts to Gas Mark 8, which is the standard equivalent for this temperature in UK ovens and air fryers. This is a common temperature for roasting meats, baking pastries, and creating crispy textures in your air fryer. Whether you're following a recipe from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> or adapting traditional oven instructions, knowing this conversion is essential.</p>

<h2>Understanding Gas Mark and Fahrenheit</h2>
<p>Gas Mark is a temperature scale used in the UK, while Fahrenheit is more common in the US. Gas Mark 8 equals 450°F (232°C), but 431°F is close enough to use the same setting. Most air fryers display temperatures in Celsius or Fahrenheit, so conversions are often needed. The <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> on our site makes these adjustments simple. Many modern air fryers have presets that eliminate guesswork.</p>

<p>When cooking at 431°F (Gas Mark 8), you'll achieve excellent browning and crispiness. This temperature works well for chicken, potatoes, and other roasted vegetables.

<h3>Why 431°F Matters in Air Fryers</h3>

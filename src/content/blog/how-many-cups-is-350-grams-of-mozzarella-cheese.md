<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>
<p>Using the right amount of mozzarella cheese can make or break your air fryer dish. Too little, and your meal lacks flavour; too much, and it becomes overly greasy. Air fryers cook food quickly, so precise measurements ensure even melting and browning. This is especially important for recipes like air fryer garlic bread or stuffed mushrooms.

<p>Different types of mozzarella (shredded, cubed, or fresh) can slightly alter the cup measurement. Shredded mozzarella packs more densely, while fresh mozzarella contains more moisture. Always fluff the cheese lightly before measuring for consistency.

<h3>Tips for Storing Mozzarella Cheese</h3>

<h2>Why accurate quinoa measurements matter</h2>  
<p>Using the correct amount of quinoa ensures your dishes have the right texture and flavour. Too little, and your meal might lack substance; too much, and it could become overly dense. Air fryer recipes, like those found on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>our recipes page</a>, often rely on precise measurements for even cooking. Quinoa expands when cooked, so starting with the right quantity is crucial. A small discrepancy in measurement can lead to noticeable differences in the final dish.</p>  

<p>For example, if you're making a quinoa-stuffed pepper in your air fryer, 0.5 tbsp (5 grams) of uncooked quinoa yields about 15 grams once cooked. This ratio helps you plan portions accurately. Many of our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable-based recipes</a> incorporate quinoa for added protein and texture. By measuring correctly, you ensure every bite is balanced and delicious.</p>  

<h3>How to measure 0.5 tbsp of quinoa</h3>  
<p>To measure 0.5 tbsp of quinoa, use a standard tablespoon and fill it halfway. For greater accuracy, a kitchen scale is ideal—simply weigh out 5 grams. If you don’t have a scale, levelling off the quinoa in the spoon ensures consistency. Avoid packing it down, as this can lead to over-measuring.

<h3>Tips for cooking quinoa in an air fryer</h3>  
<p>Rinse quinoa thoroughly before cooking to remove its natural coating, which can taste bitter. Combine 0.5 tbsp (5 grams) of quinoa with 15ml of water or broth in an air fryer-safe dish. Cook at 180°C for 10–12 minutes, stirring halfway. The result should be light and fluffy, ready to add to any dish. For best results, let it rest for a few minutes after cooking.</p>

<p>0.375 cup of soy sauce equals 3 ounces. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements can make or break a dish. Whether you’re marinating chicken or whipping up a stir-fry, knowing the exact weight ensures consistent results. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we focus on accuracy to help you cook like a pro.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate soy sauce measurements matter</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of soy sauce is crucial for balancing flavours in your air fryer dishes. Too little, and your meal might lack depth; too much, and it could become overly salty. Converting 0.375 cup of soy sauce to ounces (3 oz) helps you stay on track. This is especially handy for recipes like teriyaki salmon or glazed tofu, where precision is key. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipes</a> for more inspiration.</p>  

<p>Many air fryer enthusiasts rely on volume measurements, but weight (ounces) is often more reliable. A kitchen scale can simplify the process, ensuring your 0.375 cup of soy sauce is perfectly measured every time. This small adjustment can elevate your cooking, whether you’re preparing a quick stir-fry or marinating meats. For more tips, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>  

<h3>How to measure 0.375 cup of soy sauce</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a 0.375 cup measure, you can use tablespoons instead. Six tablespoons equal 0.375 cup, which converts to 3 ounces of soy sauce. This method is great for smaller quantities and ensures accuracy without specialised tools. For larger batches, a liquid measuring cup with clear markings will do the trick.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for 0.375 cup of soy sauce</h2>  
<p>This measurement is ideal for marinades, dressings, and sauces in air fryer cooking. For example, 0.375 cup (3 oz) of soy sauce works perfectly for a family-sized portion of honey garlic chicken or crispy tofu. It’s also a great base for homemade teriyaki sauce, which pairs beautifully with salmon or shrimp. Browse our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipes</a> for delicious ideas.</p>  

<p>Another popular use is in stir-fries, where 0.375 cup of soy sauce adds rich umami flavour. Combine it with garlic, ginger, and a splash of sesame oil for an easy sauce. The air fryer crisps up veggies and proteins while the soy sauce ties everything together.

<h3>Tips for storing soy sauce</h3>  
<p>Once opened, soy sauce should be stored in a cool, dark place to maintain its flavour. If you’re measuring 0.375 cup frequently, consider keeping a dedicated bottle for cooking. This prevents cross-contamination and ensures your measurements stay consistent. Proper storage also extends the shelf life, so your soy sauce is always ready for your next air fryer adventure.</p>

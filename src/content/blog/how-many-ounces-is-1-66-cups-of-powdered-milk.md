<p>1.66 cups of powdered milk equals approximately 13.28 ounces. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements can make or break your dish. Whether you're whipping up a cake or a creamy sauce, knowing the exact weight ensures consistency and perfect results every time.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>
<p>Air fryers rely on precise cooking times and temperatures, and ingredient measurements are just as crucial. Using the correct amount of powdered milk, like 1.66 cups converted to 13.28 ounces, ensures your recipes turn out as intended. Too much or too little can affect texture, moisture, and even cooking time.</p>
<p>For example, if you're making a <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>cake in your air fryer</a>, the right balance of powdered milk ensures a tender crumb. Similarly, creamy dishes like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>soups or sauces</a> need exact measurements to avoid being too thick or thin. Always double-check your conversions to avoid kitchen mishaps.</p>

<h2>How to Convert 1.66 Cups of Powdered Milk to Ounces</h2>
<p>The standard conversion for powdered milk is 1 cup = 8 ounces. Therefore, 1.66 cups of powdered milk equals 13.28 ounces. This measurement is based on the UK standard, so you can trust its accuracy for your recipes.</p>
<p>If you're using a kitchen scale, simply weigh out 13.28 ounces for 1.66 cups. No scale? Use a <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a> or measuring cups with clear markings. Remember, powdered milk can settle, so fluff it up before measuring for the most accurate results.</p>

<h3>Common Uses for 1.66 Cups of Powdered Milk</h3>
<p>Powdered milk is versatile in air fryer cooking. From <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>desserts</a> to savoury dishes, 1.66 cups (13.28 ounces) can be used in breading mixes, batters, or even homemade seasoning blends. It's a pantry staple that adds richness without the need for refrigeration.</p>

<h2>Tips for Measuring Powdered Milk Accurately</h2>
<p>Always spoon powdered milk into your measuring cup and level it off with a knife. Scooping directly from the bag can compact the powder, leading to inaccurate measurements. For 1.66 cups, measure 1 full cup first, then add two-thirds of another cup.</p>
<p>If you're scaling a recipe up or down, use our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a> to adjust the ounces accordingly. And don't forget to keep your air fryer clean—powdered milk can leave residue if not wiped properly. Check out our guide on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning your air fryer</a> for best practices.</p>

<h3>Storing Powdered Milk for Freshness</h3>
<p>To keep your powdered milk fresh, store it in an airtight container in a cool, dry place. This ensures your 1.66 cups (13.28 ounces) will be ready for your next air fryer adventure without clumping or spoiling.</p>

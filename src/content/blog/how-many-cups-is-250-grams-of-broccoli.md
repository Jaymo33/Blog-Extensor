<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>
<p>Getting the right amount of broccoli is crucial for even cooking in your air fryer. Too much can lead to steaming instead of crisping, while too little might burn. Broccoli is a versatile veggie, perfect for air frying, but its density means weight-to-volume conversions aren’t always straightforward. A packed cup of florets will weigh more than loosely filled chopped pieces. For best results, use a kitchen scale when possible or refer to trusted conversions like 250 grams of broccoli in cups.</p>
<p>If you’re new to air frying, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a> includes plenty of veggie-packed ideas. From crispy broccoli bites to full meals, precise measurements help replicate restaurant-quality dishes at home. Remember, 250 grams of broccoli is about two medium heads, so you can eyeball it if needed.</p>

<h3>How to Measure 250 Grams of Broccoli Without a Scale</h3>
<p>No scale? No problem! For 250 grams of broccoli, aim for roughly 3 cups of loosely packed florets or 2.5 cups if finely chopped. The stems add weight but take up less volume, so adjust accordingly. If you’re using frozen broccoli, note that it’s often pre-chopped and may measure differently—thaw and drain it first for accuracy.

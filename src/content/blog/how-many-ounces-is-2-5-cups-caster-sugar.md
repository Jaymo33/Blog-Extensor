<h2>Why accurate sugar measurements matter in air fryer baking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers cook food faster than conventional ovens, so precise ingredient ratios are crucial. Too much or too little sugar can affect browning, texture, and even cooking times.

<h3>How to measure 2.5 cups of caster sugar correctly</h3>  
<p>Use a dry measuring cup and level off the sugar with a straight edge for accuracy. Scooping directly from the bag can compress the sugar, leading to over-measurement. For 2.5 cups of caster sugar in ounces, a kitchen scale is the best tool. This method is especially handy for air fryer baking, where small batches are common. Need cleaning tips?

<h2>Common uses for 2.5 cups of caster sugar in air fryer recipes</h2>  
<p>This quantity is perfect for cakes, cookies, and meringues. For instance, a classic Victoria sponge or air-fryer shortbread might require 2.5 cups of caster sugar (17.64 oz).

Remember, precise conversions like 2.5 cups caster sugar to oz UK ensure consistent results.</p>  

<h3>Converting other sugar types to ounces</h3>  
<p>Granulated or brown sugar weighs differently due to grain size and moisture. For example, 2.5 cups of granulated sugar equals roughly 17.64 oz, similar to caster sugar. However, brown sugar is denser, so 2.5 cups would weigh about 20 oz. Always adjust measurements based on the sugar type for air fryer success.

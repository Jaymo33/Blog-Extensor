<p>3.0 cups of self-raising flour equals approximately 360 grams. This conversion is essential for baking, especially when using an air fryer, where precise measurements can make or break your recipe. Whether you're whipping up cakes, muffins, or bread, knowing the exact gram equivalent ensures consistency and perfect results every time.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Flour Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Baking is a science, and even small measurement errors can lead to dense or dry results. Self-raising flour, which contains baking powder, requires extra precision. If you're using an air fryer, the confined cooking space means ingredients must be perfectly balanced. Too much flour can cause uneven cooking, while too little may result in a collapsed bake. For foolproof recipes, always measure by weight rather than volume.</p>  
<p>At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we recommend using a digital kitchen scale for accuracy. Cups can vary based on how the flour is scooped, but grams provide a universal standard. This is especially helpful when adapting traditional oven recipes for air fryer use, where cooking times and temperatures differ.</p>

<h2>How to Convert Cups to Grams for Self-Raising Flour</h2>  
<p>The general rule is that 1 cup of self-raising flour weighs around 120 grams. Therefore, 3.0 cups of self-raising flour equals roughly 360 grams. However, factors like humidity and packing density can slightly alter this. For best results, fluff the flour with a fork before lightly spooning it into the measuring cup. Avoid tapping or compacting it, as this can add up to 20% more flour by weight.</p>  
<p>If you're scaling a recipe from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>our collection</a>, always cross-check the measurements. Many UK recipes use grams, while US ones rely on cups. A quick conversion ensures your air fryer bakes turn out light and fluffy every time.</p>

<h3>Common Mistakes When Measuring Flour</h3>  
<p>One of the biggest errors is scooping flour directly from the bag with a measuring cup. This compacts the flour, leading to an excess. Instead, use the spoon-and-level method: gently spoon flour into the cup, then level it off with a knife. For absolute precision, invest in a digital scale—they're inexpensive and eliminate guesswork.</p>

<h2>Using Self-Raising Flour in Air Fryer Recipes</h2>  
<p>Self-raising flour is a staple for quick bakes like scones, pancakes, and muffins in the air fryer. Its built-in leavening agent ensures a good rise, but the correct weight is crucial. Too much flour can make bakes heavy, while too little may cause them to spread. Always follow trusted recipes, like those on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>our cakes category</a>, for reliable results.</p>  
<p>Air fryers circulate hot air rapidly, so batters and doughs cook faster than in conventional ovens. This means precise measurements are even more critical. If you're converting a recipe, start with the correct gram equivalent for 3.0 cups of self-raising flour (360g) and adjust other ingredients proportionally.</p>

<h3>Adjusting Recipes for Air Fryer Baking</h3>  
<p>When adapting oven recipes for the air fryer, reduce the temperature by about 20°C and check for doneness a few minutes early. Since air fryers vary, use a toothpick test to confirm cakes or muffins are fully cooked.

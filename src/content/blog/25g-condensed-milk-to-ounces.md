<p>25g of condensed milk equals approximately 0.88 ounces. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes, especially when precision matters for baking or dessert-making. Whether you’re whipping up a cake or a creamy topping, knowing the exact weight ensures perfect results every time.</p>  

<h2>Why Convert 25g of Condensed Milk to Ounces?</h2>  
<p>Many UK recipes, especially those for air fryers, use grams, while others rely on ounces. Converting 25g of condensed milk to ounces (0.88 oz) helps maintain accuracy, particularly in baking where measurements can make or break a dish. If you’re using an air fryer for desserts like cheesecakes or fudgy brownies, precise measurements ensure the right texture and consistency.</p>  

<p>Condensed milk is a staple in many air fryer recipes, from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>quick desserts</a> to rich sauces. Knowing how to convert 25g to ounces means you can easily follow both metric and imperial recipes without guesswork. For more conversions, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure 25g of Condensed Milk</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a scale, you can use tablespoons to measure 25g of condensed milk. One tablespoon holds roughly 20g, so 1.25 tablespoons will give you the equivalent of 25g or 0.88 ounces. For sticky ingredients like condensed milk, lightly greasing the spoon helps with accurate pouring.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for 25g of Condensed Milk in Air Fryers</h2>  
<p>Condensed milk adds richness to air fryer desserts like banoffee pie, fudge, or even <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>air fryer cakes</a>. Since 25g is a small amount, it’s often used for glazes, drizzles, or as part of a larger mixture. Its thick, sweet consistency enhances flavour without overwhelming other ingredients.</p>  

<p>Another popular use is in no-churn ice cream or as a sweetener for air-fried pastries. Because air fryers cook quickly, condensed milk caramelises beautifully, adding a delicious depth to treats. For cleaning sticky residues, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner guide</a> has handy tips.</p>  

<h3>Converting Larger Amounts of Condensed Milk</h3>  
<p>If your recipe calls for more than 25g, simply scale the conversion. For example, 50g of condensed milk equals 1.76 ounces, and 100g is 3.53 ounces. Keeping a conversion chart handy saves time, especially when experimenting with new <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>air fryer dessert recipes</a>.</p>  

<h2>Tips for Working with Condensed Milk in Air Fryers</h2>  
<p>Condensed milk can burn easily due to its high sugar content, so always monitor cooking times. When using 25g (0.88 oz) in air fryer recipes, spread it evenly or mix well to prevent hotspots. Preheating the air fryer ensures even cooking and avoids clumping.</p>  

<p>For sticky recipes, lining the basket with parchment paper makes cleanup easier. If you’re making a larger batch, remember that 25g of condensed milk is just under an ounce, so adjust other ingredients proportionally.

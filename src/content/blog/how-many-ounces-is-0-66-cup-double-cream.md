<p>0.66 cup of double cream equals approximately 5.28 ounces (oz). This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements can make or break a dish. Whether you’re making a rich dessert or a creamy sauce, knowing the exact weight ensures consistency. Double cream is denser than single cream, so volume-to-weight conversions matter. For more air fryer measurement tips, visit <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>our conversion chart</a>.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on even heat distribution, and ingredient proportions affect cooking times. Too much or too little double cream can alter textures, especially in baked goods or custards. For example, a <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert recipe</a> might require 5.28 oz of double cream for the perfect consistency. Measuring by weight (ounces) is more reliable than volume (cups) for dense ingredients like cream. Always use a kitchen scale for best results.</p>  

<p>If you’re adapting a traditional recipe for the air fryer, conversions like 0.66 cup to ounces are crucial. Air fryers cook faster, so ingredient ratios must be spot-on. Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a> for dishes tailored to air fryer cooking. From creamy pasta bakes to indulgent puddings, precise measurements guarantee success.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure 0.66 Cup of Double Cream Without a Scale</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a scale, use liquid measuring cups for 0.66 cup (about 2/3 cup) of double cream. Fill the cup just below the rim to avoid spillage. Remember, 0.66 cup converts to 5.28 oz, but slight variations can occur based on cream thickness. For sticky ingredients like double cream, spray the measuring cup with oil for easier pouring. Check out our guide on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning air fryer accessories</a> after handling creamy mixtures.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for 0.66 Cup (5.28 oz) of Double Cream</h2>  
<p>This quantity is perfect for small-batch recipes, like a two-serving chocolate mousse or a creamy mushroom sauce. In air fryers, double cream adds richness to <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/potatoes>potato gratins</a> or custards. Since air fryers excel at portion control, 5.28 oz of cream avoids waste. For larger recipes, scale up the conversion—1 cup of double cream equals roughly 8 oz.</p>  

<p>Double cream also works wonders in air-fryer scones or clotted cream substitutes. Its high fat content (around 48%) ensures a velvety texture. Need inspiration?

From pancakes to French toast, 0.66 cup of double cream elevates any dish.</p>  

<h3>UK vs. US Measurements for Double Cream</h3>  
<p>In the UK, double cream is slightly thicker than US heavy cream, but the ounce conversion remains similar. For 0.66 cup, both equate to ~5.28 oz. Always check labels if substituting—some US creams contain stabilizers. For authentic British recipes, stick to UK double cream and precise conversions like 0.66 cup to ounces.</p>

<p>150g of onion equals approximately 5.29 ounces. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes, where precise measurements can make all the difference. Whether you’re preparing a hearty stew or crispy onion rings, knowing how to convert grams to ounces ensures your dish turns out perfectly every time. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we understand the importance of accurate measurements, especially when working with ingredients like onions that can vary in density.</p>

<h2>Why accurate onion measurements matter in air frying</h2>  
<p>Onions are a staple in many air fryer recipes, from caramelised toppings to crunchy garnishes. Using the right amount ensures balanced flavours and even cooking. If you’re following a recipe that calls for 150g of onion, converting it to ounces (5.29 oz) helps if your kitchen scales only measure in imperial units. For more air fryer measurement tips, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>  
<p>Air fryers cook food quickly, so unevenly sized onion pieces can lead to inconsistent results. Measuring 150g of onion (or 5.29 ounces) ensures uniformity, whether you’re dicing, slicing, or grating. This precision is especially handy for recipes like air-fried onion bhajis or stuffed peppers, where the onion’s weight affects texture and cooking time.</p>  

<h2>How to measure 150g of onion without scales</h2>  
<p>Don’t have kitchen scales? No problem. One medium-sized onion typically weighs around 150g (5.29 ounces), making it a handy rule of thumb. For smaller or larger onions, adjust accordingly—half a large onion or two small ones should get you close to the 150g mark. If you’re prepping ahead, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipes section</a> has plenty of ideas for using up leftover onions.</p>  

<h3>Using cups for approximate measurements</h3>  
<p>If you’re in a pinch, 150g of chopped onion roughly fills one metric cup. However, this can vary depending on how finely you dice the onion. For air fryer recipes, we recommend sticking to weight measurements for the best results, as volume measurements can be less precise.</p>  

<h2>Common air fryer recipes using 150g of onion</h2>  
<p>From savoury dishes to snacks, 150g of onion (5.29 ounces) is a versatile quantity. Try it in air-fried onion rings, where the exact weight ensures even crispiness. Or add it to a batch of air-fryer fajitas for a perfectly balanced flavour. For more inspiration, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable recipes</a>.</p>  
<p>Another great option is air-fried stuffed mushrooms, where 150g of finely diced onion adds depth without overpowering the dish. Remember, accurate measurements like 150g (5.29 ounces) help replicate restaurant-quality results at home.

<h3>Adjusting recipes for personal taste</h3>  
<p>While 150g of onion is a standard measurement, feel free to tweak it based on your preferences. Love extra onion in your dishes? Add an extra 50g (1.76 ounces) for a stronger flavour. Prefer a milder taste? Reduce the quantity slightly. The air fryer’s versatility makes it easy to experiment.</p>

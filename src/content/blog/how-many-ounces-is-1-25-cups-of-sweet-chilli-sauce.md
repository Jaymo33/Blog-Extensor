<p>1.25 cups of sweet chilli sauce equals approximately 10 ounces. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes, where precise measurements can make or break a dish. Whether you’re marinating chicken or glazing shrimp, knowing the exact weight ensures consistent results. Sweet chilli sauce is a versatile ingredient, and getting the right amount is key to balancing flavours. For more air fryer conversions, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Using the correct amount of sweet chilli sauce ensures your air fryer dishes are neither too dry nor overly saucy. A deviation of even a few ounces can alter the texture and taste significantly. This is especially important for recipes like sticky wings or glazed salmon, where the sauce is the star. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we emphasise precision to help you achieve restaurant-quality results at home. Our guides are designed to take the guesswork out of cooking.</p>  

<p>Sweet chilli sauce is thicker than many other liquids, so volume-to-weight conversions can be tricky. Unlike water, which has a straightforward conversion (1 cup = 8 ounces), sweet chilli sauce is denser. This means 1.25 cups will weigh slightly more than you might expect. For those who love experimenting with <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipes</a>, this accuracy is a game-changer.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure Sweet Chilli Sauce Correctly</h3>  
<p>For the most accurate measurement, use a kitchen scale to weigh your sweet chilli sauce in ounces. If you don’t have one, spoon the sauce into a measuring cup and level it off with a knife. Avoid packing the sauce down, as this can lead to over-measuring. This method ensures you get exactly 10 ounces from 1.25 cups, perfect for recipes like air fryer sweet chilli glazed tofu or shrimp.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for Sweet Chilli Sauce in Air Fryers</h2>  
<p>Sweet chilli sauce is a staple in many air fryer recipes, from marinades to dipping sauces. Its sweet-spicy flavour pairs well with proteins like chicken, shrimp, and tofu. For example, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> section features a popular sweet chilli glazed chicken that uses exactly 1.25 cups (10 ounces) of sauce. The balance of flavours is spot-on, thanks to precise measurements.</p>  

<p>Another great use is as a glaze for air fryer salmon or vegetables. The sauce caramelises beautifully under high heat, creating a sticky, flavourful coating. Whether you’re cooking for one or meal prepping for the week, knowing how many ounces are in 1.25 cups of sweet chilli sauce ensures consistency.

<h3>Converting Other Measurements</h3>  
<p>If your recipe calls for a different amount of sweet chilli sauce, here’s a quick reference: 1 cup = 8 ounces, 0.5 cup = 4 ounces, and 2 cups = 16 ounces. These conversions are handy for scaling recipes up or down.

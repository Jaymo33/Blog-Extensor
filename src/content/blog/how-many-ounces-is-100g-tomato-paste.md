<p>100g of tomato paste equals approximately 3.53 ounces. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes, where precise measurements can make or break a dish. Whether you’re making a rich pasta sauce or a flavourful marinade, knowing how to convert grams to ounces ensures consistency. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we help simplify cooking conversions so you can focus on creating delicious meals.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on precise ingredient ratios to achieve the perfect texture and flavour. Too much tomato paste can make a dish overly thick, while too little might leave it lacking depth. Converting 100g of tomato paste to ounces (3.53 oz) ensures your recipes turn out just right. For more conversion tips, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>  

<p>Tomato paste is a staple in many air fryer recipes, from hearty stews to quick weeknight dinners. Its concentrated flavour means small adjustments can have a big impact. Measuring 100g of tomato paste correctly (3.53 oz) helps maintain balance in dishes like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipes</a> or <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable roasts</a>.</p>  

<h3>How to measure tomato paste without scales</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a kitchen scale, you can still measure 100g of tomato paste (3.53 oz) using tablespoons. One tablespoon of tomato paste weighs roughly 15g, so 100g is about 6.5 tablespoons. This method isn’t as precise but works in a pinch for recipes like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer sauces</a>.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for 100g of tomato paste in air fryer recipes</h2>  
<p>Tomato paste adds depth to many air fryer dishes. A 100g portion (3.53 oz) is perfect for making marinades, glazes, or even a rich base for air-fried meatballs. Its concentrated flavour means a little goes a long way, so accurate measuring ensures you don’t overpower your dish.</p>  

<p>For example, in <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/beef>beef recipes</a>, 100g of tomato paste (3.53 oz) can create a robust sauce or glaze. It’s also great for adding umami to vegetarian dishes, like air-fried stuffed peppers. Keeping your measurements precise ensures every bite is packed with balanced flavour.</p>  

<h3>Storing leftover tomato paste</h3>  
<p>If your recipe only uses part of a 100g (3.53 oz) tomato paste portion, store the rest in an airtight container in the fridge. It’ll keep for up to a week, ready for your next air fryer creation. For longer storage, freeze it in ice cube trays for easy portioning later.</p>

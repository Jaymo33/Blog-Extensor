<h3>How to measure tomato paste without scales</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a kitchen scale, you can still measure 100g of tomato paste (3.53 oz) using tablespoons. One tablespoon of tomato paste weighs roughly 15g, so 100g is about 6.5 tablespoons.

<h2>Common uses for 100g of tomato paste in air fryer recipes</h2>

<h3>Storing leftover tomato paste</h3>  
<p>If your recipe only uses part of a 100g (3.53 oz) tomato paste portion, store the rest in an airtight container in the fridge. It’ll keep for up to a week, ready for your next air fryer creation. For longer storage, freeze it in ice cube trays for easy portioning later.</p>

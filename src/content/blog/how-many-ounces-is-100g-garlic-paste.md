Let’s dive deeper into conversions and tips for using garlic paste in your air fryer.</p>

<h2>Why Convert 100g of Garlic Paste to Ounces?</h2>  
<p>Converting 100g of garlic paste to ounces ensures accuracy, especially when following air fryer recipes. Many UK recipes use grams, while others reference ounces, so knowing both measurements is handy. Garlic paste adds depth to dishes like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>air fryer chicken</a> or roasted vegetables. A slight miscalculation can overpower or underwhelm your meal. By mastering this conversion, you’ll confidently adapt any recipe to your air fryer.</p>

For more conversions, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>. It’s a lifesaver for avoiding kitchen mishaps and ensuring your air fryer meals turn out perfectly every time.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure Garlic Paste for Air Fryer Recipes</h3>  
<p>Measuring garlic paste accurately is key to nailing your air fryer dishes. Use a digital kitchen scale for the most precise results, especially when converting 100g to ounces. If you don’t have a scale, tablespoons can work in a pinch—roughly 6-7 tablespoons equal 100g. However, scales are more reliable for consistency. For sticky ingredients like garlic paste, lightly oil the measuring spoon or cup for easy release.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for 100g of Garlic Paste in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Garlic paste is incredibly versatile in air fryer recipes. A 100g portion (3.53 ounces) is perfect for marinades, rubs, or even mixed into dips. Try it in <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>air fryer roasted vegetables</a> for an extra punch of flavour. You can also blend it with olive oil and herbs for a quick glaze. The concentrated taste means a little goes a long way, so measure carefully to avoid overpowering your dish.</p>  

<p>Another great use for 100g of garlic paste is in homemade sauces or dressings. Mix it with yogurt for a tangy dip or stir it into mayonnaise for a bold sandwich spread. If you’re meal prepping, portioning 100g batches ensures consistency across recipes. For more inspiration, browse our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipe collection</a>, where precise measurements lead to delicious results.</p>  

<h3>Tips for Storing Leftover Garlic Paste</h3>  
<p>If you’ve measured 100g of garlic paste but only need half, proper storage keeps it fresh. Transfer leftovers to an airtight container and refrigerate for up to two weeks. For longer storage, freeze portions in ice cube trays—each cube holds about 15g (0.53 ounces). Thaw as needed for future air fryer recipes. Always label containers with dates to track freshness and avoid waste.</p>

<p>635 ml of lime juice is approximately 2.68 cups. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes, ensuring precise measurements for marinades, dressings, or desserts. Whether you're following a British or American recipe, knowing how to convert millilitres to cups guarantees perfect results every time.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Lime Juice Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of lime juice can make or break a dish. Too little, and your marinade lacks zest; too much, and it overpowers other flavours. For air fryer recipes, precision ensures even cooking and balanced taste. A dish like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer lime chicken</a> relies on the perfect lime-to-marinade ratio for that tangy kick.</p>  
<p>Many home cooks struggle with conversions, especially when switching between metric and imperial units. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> simplifies this process, so you never second-guess measurements again. Whether you're baking, grilling, or making cocktails, 635 ml of lime juice translates to roughly 2.68 cups.</p>  

<h3>Converting 635 ml Lime Juice for Baking</h3>  
<p>Baking demands accuracy, and lime juice is no exception. If a recipe calls for 635 ml of lime juice, measuring 2.68 cups ensures your cake or tart isn’t overly sour. For <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>lime-infused desserts</a>, this precision guarantees a refreshing finish without overpowering sweetness.</p>  

<h2>US vs. UK Cup Measurements</h2>  
<p>Did you know US and UK cups differ slightly? A US cup is 240 ml, while a UK cup is 250 ml. For 635 ml of lime juice, this means 2.65 US cups or 2.54 UK cups. Most modern recipes standardise to the US measurement, but always check the origin of your recipe.</p>  
<p>If you're using an air fryer for <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>lime-marinated chicken</a>, stick to one measurement system to avoid inconsistencies. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner</a> also helps maintain your appliance after cooking citrus-based dishes, preventing residue buildup.</p>  

<h3>Tips for Measuring Lime Juice</h3>  
<p>For the most accurate 635 ml lime juice measurement, use a liquid measuring cup. Fill it to the 2.68-cup mark at eye level to avoid overpouring. Freshly squeezed lime juice offers the best flavour, but bottled works in a pinch—just check for additives.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for 635 ml of Lime Juice</h2>  
<p>From marinades to cocktails, 635 ml of lime juice (2.68 cups) is versatile. Try it in air fryer fish tacos, ceviche, or a zesty salad dressing. For a refreshing drink, mix it with sparkling water and a hint of sweetener.</p>  
<p>If you're experimenting with <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/seafood>lime-infused seafood</a>, precise measurements ensure balanced acidity. Too much lime can "cook" delicate proteins like shrimp, while too little misses the mark. Always taste as you go!</p>

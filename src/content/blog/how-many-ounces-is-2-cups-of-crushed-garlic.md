<p>2 cups of crushed garlic equals approximately 16 ounces (or 1 pound). This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements can make or break your dish. Whether you’re making garlic butter shrimp or roasted garlic potatoes, knowing the exact weight ensures consistent flavour and texture.</p>

<h2>Why accurate garlic measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of crushed garlic in your air fryer recipes ensures balanced flavours without overpowering your dish. Too little, and you’ll miss that rich, aromatic punch; too much, and it can become bitter. Air fryers cook food quickly, so evenly distributed garlic is key for perfect results. For more air fryer tips, visit <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>our conversion chart</a>.</p>  

<p>Garlic’s density can vary slightly depending on how finely it’s crushed, but 2 cups generally weigh around 16 ounces. If you’re working with a recipe that calls for weight rather than volume, this conversion will save you time and hassle. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>garlic-infused recipes</a> for inspiration.</p>  

<h3>How to measure crushed garlic correctly</h3>  
<p>For the most accurate measurement, lightly pack the crushed garlic into your measuring cup without pressing too hard. Over-packing can lead to more garlic than needed, altering the taste of your dish. If you’re using pre-minced garlic from a jar, note that it may have a slightly different weight due to added moisture.</p>  

<h2>Common recipes using 2 cups of crushed garlic</h2>  
<p>Many air fryer recipes benefit from generous amounts of garlic, such as garlic bread, roasted chicken, or garlic butter mushrooms. For example, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>garlic butter chicken</a> uses 2 cups of crushed garlic for a bold, savoury flavour. Always adjust measurements based on personal taste preferences.</p>  

<p>If you’re prepping a large batch of garlic-heavy dishes, like garlic-infused oils or marinades, knowing that 2 cups equals 16 ounces helps streamline your cooking process. Explore more <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>garlic-forward vegetable recipes</a> to make the most of your air fryer.</p>  

<h3>Tips for storing excess crushed garlic</h3>  
<p>If you’ve crushed more garlic than needed, store it in an airtight container in the fridge for up to a week. For longer storage, freeze it in ice cube trays with a bit of olive oil. This way, you’ll always have pre-measured garlic ready for your next air fryer masterpiece.</p>  

<p>Cleaning your air fryer after cooking with garlic is crucial to prevent lingering odours. Use our recommended <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner</a> to keep your appliance fresh and ready for the next use.</p>

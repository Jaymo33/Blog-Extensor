<p>60 ml of half and half equals approximately 0.25 cups (or 1/4 cup). This conversion is essential for precise baking and cooking, especially when using an air fryer where measurements can make or break a recipe. Whether you're whipping up a creamy sauce or a decadent dessert, knowing how to convert 60 ml of half and half to cups ensures consistency and perfection every time.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter</h2>
<p>When it comes to cooking and baking, precision is key. Using the correct amount of half and half can affect the texture, flavour, and overall success of your dish. For air fryer recipes, where ingredients cook quickly and evenly, even small measurement errors can lead to less-than-ideal results. That’s why knowing how many cups 60 ml of half and half is can be a game-changer in the kitchen.</p>
<p>Half and half is a versatile ingredient used in everything from creamy soups to rich desserts. If you’re following a recipe from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, you’ll want to ensure your measurements are spot-on. Whether you’re making a savoury sauce or a sweet treat, 60 ml of half and half translates to 0.25 cups, making it easy to measure and use.</p>

<h2>Converting 60 ml of Half and Half to Cups</h2>
<p>Converting millilitres to cups can seem tricky, but it’s straightforward once you know the ratio. For liquids like half and half, 240 ml equals 1 cup. Therefore, 60 ml is a quarter of that amount, or 0.25 cups. This conversion is particularly useful for air fryer recipes, where precise measurements ensure even cooking and perfect results.</p>
<p>If you don’t have a measuring cup handy, you can use a tablespoon as a substitute. Since 1 tablespoon is roughly 15 ml, 60 ml of half and half would be 4 tablespoons. This handy trick is great for quick adjustments, especially when you’re mid-recipe and realise you need to convert 60 ml of half and half to cups on the fly.</p>

<h3>Using Half and Half in Air Fryer Recipes</h3>
<p>Half and half adds richness to many air fryer dishes, from creamy pasta bakes to indulgent desserts. When a recipe calls for 60 ml of half and half, you now know it’s 0.25 cups. This measurement is perfect for small batches, ensuring your dish isn’t overly rich or too thin.

<h2>Common Uses for 60 ml of Half and Half</h2>
<p>Half and half is a staple in many kitchens, and 60 ml (or 0.25 cups) is a common measurement in recipes. It’s often used in coffee, sauces, and baked goods. In air fryer cooking, it can be used to create creamy dips, moist cakes, or even to brush onto pastries for a golden finish. Knowing how many cups 60 ml of half and half is ensures you can adapt recipes with confidence.</p>
<p>For example, if you’re making a creamy garlic sauce for chicken, 60 ml of half and half will give you just the right consistency. Or, if you’re baking a small batch of scones, 0.25 cups of half and half will keep them tender without making them too heavy.

<h3>Tips for Measuring Half and Half</h3>
<p>To measure 60 ml of half and half accurately, use a liquid measuring cup with clear markings. Pour the half and half to the 60 ml line, or fill it to the 0.25 cup mark. If you’re using a scale, 60 ml of half and half weighs approximately 61 grams. This precision is especially important for air fryer recipes, where even small deviations can affect cooking times and results.</p>

<h2>Half and Half Substitutes</h2>
<p>If you’re out of half and half, you can still make your recipe work. For 60 ml (0.25 cups) of half and half, mix 30 ml of milk with 30 ml of heavy cream. This creates a similar richness and texture. Alternatively, you could use evaporated milk or a plant-based creamer, though the flavour may vary slightly.

<p>When using substitutes in air fryer recipes, keep an eye on cooking times, as different liquids may affect how your dish cooks. For example, a sauce made with a half and half substitute might thicken faster or slower than the original recipe intended. Adjust accordingly to avoid overcooking or undercooking.</p>

<h3>Storing Half and Half</h3>
<p>Once opened, half and half should be stored in the fridge and used within 7-10 days. If your recipe only calls for 60 ml (0.25 cups), you’ll want to make sure the rest doesn’t go to waste. Consider planning another recipe that uses half and half, like a creamy soup or a batch of pancakes.

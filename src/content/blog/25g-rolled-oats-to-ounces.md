<h2>Why convert 25g rolled oats to ounces?</h2>
<p>Many UK recipes use metric measurements, while some kitchen scales or older cookbooks still display ounces. Converting 25g of rolled oats to ounces (0.88 oz) helps when following international recipes or using equipment with imperial measurements. This small quantity is particularly common in breakfast recipes or when making oat-based toppings for desserts. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> includes this and other handy measurements for stress-free cooking.</p>

<h2>How to measure 25g of rolled oats without scales</h2>
<p>If you don't have digital scales, you can measure 25g of rolled oats (0.88 ounces) using standard tablespoons. Approximately 4 level tablespoons of rolled oats will give you the right amount. However, for best results in air fryer recipes, we recommend investing in affordable digital kitchen scales. They're particularly useful for <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes/dessert>dessert recipes</a> where precision affects texture and consistency.</p>

<h3>Does the type of oats affect the conversion?</h3>
<p>All types of oats - rolled, jumbo or porridge - have similar density, so 25g converts to 0.88 ounces regardless of variety. However, steel-cut oats are slightly denser, so you might need to adjust measurements slightly if substituting. For most air fryer recipes on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, rolled oats are recommended for their consistent texture and cooking properties.</p>

<h2>Common uses for 25g of rolled oats in air fryer cooking</h2>

<h3>Storing rolled oats for freshness</h3>
<p>After measuring out your 25g (0.88oz) portions, store remaining rolled oats in an airtight container in a cool, dark place. Proper storage maintains freshness for up to 12 months. For longer storage, consider freezing measured portions - the air fryer can toast them straight from frozen when needed.</p>

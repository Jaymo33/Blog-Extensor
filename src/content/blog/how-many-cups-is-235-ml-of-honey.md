<p>235 ml of honey is roughly equivalent to 1 cup (240 ml) when measured in standard US cups. However, due to honey’s thick consistency, slight variations can occur depending on how you pour or scoop it. For precise baking or air fryer recipes, using a measuring jug or kitchen scales ensures accuracy.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Honey Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>When cooking or baking, especially in an air fryer, precise measurements can make or break a dish. Honey’s sticky nature means it can clump or settle, leading to inconsistent volumes. Whether you’re whipping up a glaze for <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>air fryer chicken</a> or sweetening a cake, knowing the exact conversion from millilitres to cups ensures perfect results every time.</p>  

<p>For those who love experimenting with <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a>, understanding liquid conversions like 235 ml of honey in cups helps avoid overly sweet or dry outcomes. A slight mismeasurement could alter texture and taste, so sticking to reliable conversions is key.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure 235 ml of Honey Properly</h3>  
<p>To measure 235 ml of honey accurately, use a liquid measuring cup with clear markings. Lightly coat the cup with oil or non-stick spray to help the honey slide out easily. Alternatively, weigh it—honey weighs about 340 grams per cup, so 235 ml would be roughly 284 grams. This method is especially useful for <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversions</a> where precision matters.</p>  

<h2>Converting 235 ml of Honey for Different Recipes</h2>  
<p>Whether you’re making marinades, desserts, or glazes, 235 ml of honey (or just under 1 cup) is a common measurement. For example, a sticky <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/salmon>honey-glazed salmon</a> in the air fryer might call for this amount to balance sweetness and caramelisation. Adjusting recipes from millilitres to cups ensures consistency across different cooking methods.</p>  

<p>If you’re scaling a recipe up or down, remember that 235 ml of honey is close to 1 cup but not exact. For larger batches, like baking <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>air fryer cakes</a>, slight deviations can multiply, so double-check your conversions. Keeping a conversion chart handy, like the one on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, simplifies the process.</p>  

<h3>Common Mistakes When Measuring Honey</h3>  
<p>One frequent error is not accounting for honey’s viscosity. Pouring 235 ml directly into a cup without scraping can leave residue, resulting in less than needed. Another pitfall is using dry measuring cups, which aren’t designed for sticky liquids. Always opt for liquid measures or scales to avoid inaccuracies in your air fryer dishes.</p>

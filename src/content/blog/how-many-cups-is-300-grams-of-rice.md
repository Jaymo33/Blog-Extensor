<p>300 grams of rice is approximately 1.5 cups when using standard measuring cups. However, this can vary slightly depending on the type of rice and how it's packed. For air fryer recipes where precision matters, knowing this conversion helps achieve perfect results every time.</p>

<h2>Understanding Rice Measurements</h2>
<p>When converting 300 grams of rice to cups, it's important to consider the rice variety. Long-grain white rice typically measures about 1.5 cups for 300 grams, while short-grain or brown rice might be slightly less due to density differences. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we recommend using a kitchen scale for accuracy, especially when preparing air fryer meals where ingredient ratios affect cooking time and texture.</p>

<p>The way you measure rice also impacts the conversion. Scooping rice directly from the bag gives a different volume than spooning it gently into the cup. For consistent results in your air fryer recipes, we suggest the spoon-and-level method: use a spoon to transfer rice into the measuring cup, then level off the top with a straight edge.</p>

<h3>Types of Rice and Their Volumes</h3>
<p>Different rice varieties have varying densities, meaning 300 grams won't always equal the same cup measurement. Basmati rice, for example, is lighter and fluffier than sticky sushi rice. If you're making <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer rice dishes</a>, knowing these differences helps adjust cooking times and liquid ratios for perfect results.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Rice Measurement Matters</h2>
<p>In air fryer cooking, precise measurements ensure even cooking and proper texture. Using the correct amount of rice (300 grams or about 1.5 cups) prevents overcrowding and allows for proper air circulation. This is particularly important when making <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable rice dishes</a> in your air fryer, where moisture content needs careful balancing.</p>

<p>For those following specific recipes from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, accurate rice measurements mean your dish will turn out as intended. Whether you're making fried rice, rice pudding, or using rice as a base for other ingredients, starting with the right quantity of rice (300 grams or 1.5 cups) sets you up for success.</p>

<h3>Converting Between Grams and Cups</h3>

Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> includes various rice measurements for different recipe needs.

<h2>Tips for Measuring Rice in Your Air Fryer</h2>
<p>When preparing 300 grams of rice (approximately 1.5 cups) for air frying, consider the capacity of your appliance. Most air fryers work best when not overloaded, so this quantity is ideal for 2-3 servings. If you're cooking for more people, you might need to work in batches to maintain crispiness and even cooking.</p>

<p>2.5 tbsp of tomato ketchup equals approximately 37.5 grams. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements can make all the difference. Whether you're whipping up a quick sauce or marinating chicken, knowing the exact weight ensures consistency. For more handy conversions, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>
<p>Air fryers rely on even heat distribution, so ingredient quantities must be spot-on. Too much or too little tomato ketchup can throw off the balance of your dish. For example, a sticky glaze or marinade needs the right consistency to coat evenly. If you're preparing <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipes</a>, precise ketchup measurements ensure perfect flavour every time.</p>
<p>Many air fryer recipes call for tablespoons, but grams provide greater accuracy. Kitchen scales eliminate guesswork, especially with thick condiments like tomato ketchup. This is particularly useful when adapting recipes from cups to metric measurements. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a> includes both volume and weight for foolproof cooking.</p>

<h3>How to measure 2.5 tbsp of tomato ketchup</h3>
<p>For the most accurate 2.5 tbsp tomato ketchup to grams conversion, use a digital scale. Spoon the ketchup into a measuring tablespoon without packing it down, then level off the top. Repeat until you've measured 2.5 tablespoons, which should weigh about 37.5 grams. This method works perfectly for <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable coatings</a> and glazes.</p>

<h2>Common uses for 2.5 tbsp tomato ketchup in air fryer recipes</h2>
<p>This quantity often appears in sauces, marinades, and glazes for air fryer dishes. A 2.5 tablespoon portion blends beautifully with other ingredients without overpowering flavours. It's ideal for coating <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/frozen-foods>frozen foods</a> before air frying, creating that perfect sticky finish. The 37.5 gram measurement ensures consistent results batch after batch.</p>
<p>Many homemade barbecue sauces start with this amount of tomato ketchup as a base. When mixed with spices and a touch of honey, it creates enough sauce for several servings. Remember to clean your air fryer basket afterwards with our recommended <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning products</a> to remove any sticky residue.</p>

<h3>Converting other ketchup measurements to grams</h3>
<p>If your recipe calls for different amounts, here's a quick reference: 1 tbsp equals 15 grams, so 5 tbsp would be 75 grams. These conversions are invaluable when scaling recipes up or down. Whether you're cooking for one or meal prepping, gram measurements take the uncertainty out of air fryer cooking.</p>

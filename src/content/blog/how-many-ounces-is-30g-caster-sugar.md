<p>30g of caster sugar equals approximately 1.06 ounces. This conversion is essential for air fryer baking, where precise measurements can make or break your recipe. Whether you're whipping up cakes, cookies, or desserts, knowing how to convert 30g caster sugar to ounces ensures consistency. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we focus on helping you achieve perfect results with every air fryer bake.</p>

<h2>Why Convert 30g Caster Sugar to Ounces?</h2>
<p>Many UK recipes use grams, while some kitchen scales or international recipes might list ounces. Converting 30g of caster sugar to ounces (1.06 oz) helps you follow recipes accurately. This is especially useful for air fryer baking, where small quantities matter. For example, a light sponge cake or delicate cookies require precise sugar measurements. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more handy measurements.</p>

<p>Using the correct amount of caster sugar ensures your baked goods have the right texture and sweetness. Too much sugar can make desserts overly sweet or cause uneven baking in the air fryer. Too little might leave them bland or dry. Whether you're making <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>air fryer cakes</a> or cookies, 30g caster sugar to ounces is a conversion worth memorising.</p>

<h3>How to Measure 30g Caster Sugar Without Scales</h3>
<p>If you don’t have digital scales, you can still measure 30g of caster sugar (1.06 oz) using tablespoons. One level tablespoon of caster sugar is roughly 12.5g, so 2.5 tablespoons equal 30g. However, for best results, we recommend using scales for accuracy. Air fryer recipes often require precision, and eyeballing measurements can lead to inconsistent outcomes.</p>

<h2>Common Uses for 30g Caster Sugar in Air Fryer Recipes</h2>
<p>30g of caster sugar is a common measurement in many air fryer desserts. For instance, it’s perfect for small batches of <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cookies>air fryer cookies</a> or a single-serving cake. Caster sugar dissolves quickly, making it ideal for light, fluffy bakes. If you’re experimenting with <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a>, keep this conversion handy.</p>

<p>Another great use for 30g caster sugar is in air fryer meringues or fruit crumbles. The fine texture blends seamlessly into batters and toppings. Remember, air fryers cook faster than conventional ovens, so precise measurements prevent burning or undercooking. For more tips, explore our guide on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning your air fryer</a> after baking sugary treats.</p>

<h3>Does Caster Sugar Type Affect the Weight?</h3>
<p>Standard UK caster sugar weighs the same as golden caster sugar—30g equals 1.06 ounces regardless of type. However, brown caster sugar may be slightly denser due to moisture. If substituting, stick to the 30g measurement for consistency. Air fryer baking is all about precision, so slight variations can impact your results.</p>

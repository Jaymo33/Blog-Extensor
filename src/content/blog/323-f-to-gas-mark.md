<h2>Tips for Perfect Results at Gas Mark 3</h2>
<p>Always check your food 5-10 minutes before the recommended cooking time ends. Air fryers circulate heat more efficiently than ovens, so dishes may cook faster. For even browning, shake the basket or rotate the tray halfway through cooking. This is particularly important for items like roasted potatoes or chicken wings.</p>

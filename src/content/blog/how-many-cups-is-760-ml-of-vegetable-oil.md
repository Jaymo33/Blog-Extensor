<h2>How to Measure 760 ml of Vegetable Oil Without a Measuring Cup</h2>
<p>Don’t have a measuring cup? No problem. A standard UK mug holds roughly 284 ml, so 760 ml is just under 2.7 mugs. Alternatively, use a kitchen scale—vegetable oil weighs about 0.92 grams per ml, so 760 ml equals roughly 699 grams. This method is handy for air fryer cooking, where every gram counts.</p>
<p>For smaller batches, remember that 250 ml equals 1 cup, so 760 ml is just over 3 cups. If you're preparing a marinade or dressing, this approximation works well.

Most air fryer recipes on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> use UK measurements for consistency.</p>

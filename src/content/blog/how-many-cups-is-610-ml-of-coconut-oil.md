<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of coconut oil can make or break a recipe. Too much can leave dishes greasy, while too little may dry them out.

Measuring correctly ensures consistency, whether you're making sweet or savoury dishes.</p>  

<p>Converting 610 ml of coconut oil to cups is straightforward with the right tools. A standard metric cup holds 240 ml, so 610 ml divided by 240 gives roughly 2.57 cups. If you don’t have a measuring cup, a kitchen scale can help.

<h3>How to Measure Coconut Oil for Air Frying</h3>

Use a clear measuring cup for liquids or weigh it for solid measurements. Many air fryer recipes, like those in our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert category</a>, specify melted coconut oil for even distribution.</p>

<p>0.125 cup of sesame seeds equals approximately 0.6 ounces (or roughly 17 grams). This measurement is essential for air fryer recipes where precision ensures perfect results. Whether you're sprinkling sesame seeds over salmon or mixing them into a crispy coating, knowing the exact weight helps avoid over or under-seasoning.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on even heat distribution, so ingredient quantities must be precise. Too many sesame seeds can lead to uneven cooking, while too few might leave your dish lacking flavour. For recipes like sesame-crusted tofu or crispy chicken, 0.125 cup (0.6 oz) is a common measurement. If you're unsure, check our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for quick reference.</p>  

<p>Many air fryer recipes, especially those for <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken</a> or <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetables</a>, call for small amounts of sesame seeds. Measuring 0.125 cup ensures consistency, whether you're baking or toasting them. For best results, use a kitchen scale if possible—especially when working with seeds, which can vary in density.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure 0.125 Cup of Sesame Seeds Without a Scale</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a scale, use a measuring cup and fill it to the 1/8 cup mark. Lightly shake the cup to settle the seeds, but don’t pack them down. This method gives you roughly 0.6 oz, though slight variations may occur. For more precision, consider investing in a digital scale—it’s a game-changer for air fryer cooking.</p>  

<h2>Common Recipes Using 0.125 Cup Sesame Seeds</h2>  
<p>Sesame seeds add crunch and nutty flavour to many air fryer dishes. A 0.125 cup (0.6 oz) portion works well for coatings, like sesame-crusted salmon or tofu. You’ll also find this measurement in recipes for homemade granola or Asian-inspired marinades. Browse our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipes</a> section for inspiration.</p>  

<p>For example, a crispy sesame chicken recipe might use 0.125 cup of seeds mixed with breadcrumbs. Similarly, roasted vegetables tossed with sesame seeds benefit from this precise amount. Too much can overpower the dish, while too little might go unnoticed. Always measure carefully for balanced flavours.</p>  

<h3>Storing Sesame Seeds for Freshness</h3>  
<p>To keep sesame seeds fresh, store them in an airtight container in a cool, dark place. If you’ve opened a large bag, consider freezing portions to maintain quality. Fresh seeds ensure the best taste and texture in your air fryer creations.

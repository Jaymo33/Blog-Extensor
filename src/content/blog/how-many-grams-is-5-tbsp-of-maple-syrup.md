<p>5 tablespoons (tbsp) of maple syrup is equivalent to approximately 100 grams (g). This conversion is essential for precise measurements in air fryer recipes, ensuring your dishes turn out perfectly every time. Whether you’re glazing salmon or sweetening a dessert, knowing the exact weight helps maintain consistency. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we focus on accuracy to make your cooking experience effortless.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on precise ingredient ratios to achieve the best texture and flavour. Too much or too little maple syrup can alter the caramelisation and moisture levels in your dish. For example, a sticky glaze for chicken or a drizzle over roasted vegetables requires the right balance. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> simplifies these calculations, so you never have to second-guess.</p>  

<p>Maple syrup’s density means volume measurements like tablespoons can vary slightly in weight. That’s why weighing ingredients, especially for baking or marinades, ensures reliability. If you’re preparing a batch of cookies or a savoury glaze, 100 grams of maple syrup gives you the perfect sweetness without overpowering other flavours.</p>  

<h3>How to measure 5 tbsp of maple syrup without scales</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a kitchen scale, use a standard UK tablespoon (15ml) and fill it level for accuracy. Five tablespoons should roughly equal 100 grams, but slight variations can occur due to syrup thickness. For recipes where precision is key, like our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer dessert collection</a>, weighing is always recommended.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for 5 tbsp (100g) of maple syrup in air fryer recipes</h2>

In your air fryer, 100 grams can be used to glaze salmon fillets, sweeten roasted carrots, or add depth to a BBQ marinade.

<h3>Tips for storing and handling maple syrup</h3>  
<p>To keep maple syrup fresh, store it in a cool, dark place or refrigerate after opening. Its high sugar content prevents spoilage, but refrigeration maintains quality. If your syrup crystallises, gently warm it in a water bath before measuring.

<h2>Why accurate sesame oil measurements matter</h2>  
<p>Using the correct amount of sesame oil is crucial for air fryer recipes. Too much oil can make food greasy, while too little may leave it dry. For example, a <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipe</a> might call for 1 tbsp sesame oil, but weighing it ensures consistency. Digital scales are more reliable than volume measurements, especially with viscous oils like sesame. Always measure at room temperature for the most accurate results.</p>  

<p>Sesame oil has a strong flavour, so precise measurements prevent overpowering dishes. If you’re adapting a stovetop recipe for the air fryer, converting tablespoons to grams helps maintain balance.

<h3>How to measure sesame oil without scales</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have scales, use a standard UK tablespoon (15ml) and fill it level for 13.6 grams of sesame oil. Avoid heaping or underfilling, as this alters the weight. For smaller amounts, a teaspoon holds roughly 4.5 grams. Remember, oil viscosity can vary with temperature, so room-temperature measurements are best.

<h2>Converting sesame oil for different recipes</h2>  
<p>Many air fryer recipes, like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>roasted vegetables</a>, use sesame oil for flavour. If a recipe lists cups, note that 1 cup of sesame oil weighs about 218 grams (16 tbsp). For marinades or dressings, grams provide better precision than volume. Always check if the recipe uses toasted or light sesame oil, as weights can differ slightly.

<p>When substituting oils, adjust grams accordingly—coconut oil weighs 14 grams per tbsp, while olive oil is 13.5 grams. These small differences matter in air fryer cooking, where even heat distribution relies on proper oil amounts. For baking, like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>air fryer cakes</a>, precise oil measurements ensure the right texture.</p>  

<h3>Common mistakes when measuring sesame oil</h3>  
<p>Using a dirty or wet tablespoon can skew measurements, as residual liquid displaces oil. Always use dry utensils. Another mistake is eyeballing—1 tbsp sesame oil should precisely fill the spoon’s bowl, not the stem. For sticky oils, lightly coat the spoon with cooking spray first for easy pouring. These small steps guarantee accurate 13.6-gram portions every time.</p>

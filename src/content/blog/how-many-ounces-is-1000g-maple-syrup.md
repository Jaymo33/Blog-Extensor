<h2>Why convert 1000g of maple syrup to ounces?</h2>
<p>Converting 1000g of maple syrup to ounces is crucial for following recipes, especially those designed for air fryers. Many UK recipes use grams, while others might list ingredients in ounces.

For example, using too much in an air fryer glaze could make it overly sweet or sticky.</p>

However, scales are far more reliable for sticky ingredients like maple syrup.</p>

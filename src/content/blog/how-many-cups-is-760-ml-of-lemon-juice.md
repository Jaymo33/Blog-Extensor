<p>760 ml of lemon juice is equivalent to approximately 3.2 cups. This conversion is essential for baking, cooking, or preparing marinades in your air fryer. Precise measurements ensure your dishes turn out perfectly every time, whether you're following a recipe from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> or experimenting with your own creations.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Lemon Juice Measurements Matter</h2>
<p>Using the right amount of lemon juice can make or break a dish. Too little, and your recipe might lack tanginess; too much, and it could become overpoweringly sour. For air fryer recipes, especially those involving marinades or glazes, 760 ml of lemon juice (or 3.2 cups) ensures balanced flavours. If you're working with a recipe from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes</a>, precise conversions help replicate professional results at home.</p>
<p>Lemon juice also plays a role in tenderising meats or adding acidity to baked goods. Whether you're preparing chicken, fish, or even desserts, knowing that 760 ml equals 3.2 cups simplifies the process. This is particularly useful for air fryer cooking, where ingredient ratios affect texture and browning.</p>

<h2>Converting 760 ml of Lemon Juice to Cups</h2>
<p>The standard conversion for liquid measurements is 1 cup = 237 ml. Therefore, 760 ml divided by 237 ml per cup gives roughly 3.2 cups. This applies whether you're in the UK or the US, though slight variations exist due to cup sizes. For air fryer recipes, consistency is key, so always measure carefully.</p>
<p>If you don't have a measuring jug, you can use a standard 250 ml cup (common in the UK) to approximate. Three full cups would be 750 ml, leaving just 10 ml extra—about two teaspoons. For exact measurements, refer to <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart</a> for detailed guides.</p>

<h3>Using Lemon Juice in Air Fryer Recipes</h3>
<p>Lemon juice is a versatile ingredient in air fryer cooking. From marinades for chicken or fish to glazes for desserts, 760 ml (3.2 cups) can cover multiple recipes. For example, a lemon-herb marinade for air-fried salmon might use 120 ml (½ cup) per serving, meaning 760 ml could prepare six portions.</p>

<h3>Adjusting Recipes for Different Quantities</h3>
<p>If a recipe calls for 760 ml of lemon juice but you only have smaller bottles, knowing the cup equivalent helps. For instance, two 350 ml bottles plus 60 ml (¼ cup) would total 760 ml. This flexibility is handy when scaling recipes up or down for your air fryer.</p>

<h2>Tips for Measuring Lemon Juice</h2>
<p>Freshly squeezed lemon juice offers the best flavour, but bottled works too. To measure 760 ml (3.2 cups) accurately, use a liquid measuring cup with clear markings. For smaller increments, tablespoons or teaspoons can help fine-tune the amount.

<p>Storing leftover lemon juice is easy—keep it in an airtight container in the fridge for up to a week. Alternatively, freeze it in ice cube trays for future use. This way, you can thaw exactly 760 ml (3.2 cups) when needed for your next air fryer masterpiece.</p>

<h3>Common Mistakes to Avoid</h3>
<p>One mistake is confusing millilitres with grams—lemon juice’s volume (ml) differs from its weight. Another is using dry measuring cups for liquids, which can lead to inaccuracies. Always opt for liquid measures when working with 760 ml of lemon juice.</p>

<p>2.5 cups of powdered milk equals approximately 20 ounces (oz). This conversion is essential for precise baking and cooking, especially when using an air fryer where measurements matter. Whether you're making a creamy sauce or a fluffy cake, knowing how to convert cups to ounces ensures consistency in your recipes.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on even cooking, and incorrect measurements can lead to dry or uneven results. Powdered milk is often used in air fryer recipes for coatings, batters, or as a dairy substitute. For example, a <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>perfectly crispy chicken recipe</a> might call for powdered milk in its breading mix. Measuring 2.5 cups of powdered milk correctly (20 oz) ensures the right texture and flavour.</p>  

<p>Many UK cooks prefer weighing ingredients for better accuracy. If your recipe lists 2.5 cups of powdered milk but you only have scales, knowing it’s 20 oz saves time and hassle. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more handy measurement swaps.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure Powdered Milk Correctly</h3>  
<p>Scooping powdered milk directly from the bag can lead to packed cups, giving you more than needed. For the most accurate 2.5 cups (20 oz), spoon the powder lightly into a measuring cup and level it off. This method prevents dense measurements and keeps your air fryer dishes light and fluffy.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for Powdered Milk in Air Fryer Recipes</h2>  
<p>Powdered milk isn’t just for emergencies—it’s a versatile ingredient in air fryer cooking. From crispy coatings to creamy <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>desserts</a>, it adds richness without the moisture of liquid milk. For instance, 2.5 cups (20 oz) of powdered milk can make a large batch of pancake mix or a cheese sauce for nachos.</p>  

<p>It’s also great for <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/frozen-foods>frozen foods</a> like onion rings or fish fillets, helping the breading stick better. If you’re meal prepping, pre-measuring 2.5 cups (20 oz) of powdered milk saves time for future recipes. Just store it in an airtight container to keep it fresh.</p>  

<h3>Converting Other Measurements for Air Fryer Success</h3>  
<p>If your recipe uses grams or milliliters, 20 oz of powdered milk is roughly 567 grams. Always double-check conversions, especially for baked goods where precision is key. A <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>clean air fryer basket</a> also ensures even cooking, so measurements aren’t thrown off by leftover residue.</p>

<p>4 tablespoons (tbsp) of golden syrup equals approximately 85 grams (g). This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes, ensuring precise measurements for perfect results every time. Whether you’re baking cakes, glazing meats, or making desserts, knowing the exact weight of golden syrup helps maintain consistency. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we focus on accurate conversions to make your cooking effortless.</p>

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Golden syrup is a sticky, sweet ingredient often used in baking and glazing. Its thick consistency means volume measurements like tablespoons can vary slightly in weight. For air fryer recipes, precision ensures even cooking and perfect texture. Too much syrup can make dishes overly sweet or sticky, while too little might leave them dry. Using grams instead of tablespoons eliminates guesswork, especially when following recipes from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>our collection</a>.</p>  

<p>Air fryers circulate hot air rapidly, so ingredient ratios are crucial. Golden syrup’s density means 4 tbsp will always weigh around 85g, but slight variations can occur based on temperature and brand. For consistent results, we recommend using a kitchen scale. If you’re new to air frying, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a> for other common ingredients.</p>  

<h3>How to measure golden syrup without a scale</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a scale, use the spoon-and-level method for 4 tbsp of golden syrup. Fill your tablespoon, then level it off with a knife for accuracy. Remember, 4 tbsp equals 85g, so adjust your recipe accordingly. For sticky ingredients like golden syrup, lightly greasing the spoon helps it slide off easily. This trick is handy when preparing desserts from our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert category</a>.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for golden syrup in air fryer recipes</h2>  
<p>Golden syrup adds a rich, caramelised flavour to both sweet and savoury dishes. In air fryers, it’s perfect for glazing ham, baking flapjacks, or drizzling over roasted vegetables. Its high sugar content helps create a glossy finish and enhances browning. For inspiration, browse our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>cake recipes</a>, where golden syrup often stars as a key ingredient.</p>  

<p>When using golden syrup in air fryers, avoid overheating it to prevent burning. A lower temperature (around 160°C) works best for syrupy glazes. Always preheat your air fryer to ensure even cooking. If you’re unsure about timings, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning guide</a> also includes tips for removing sticky residues post-cooking.</p>  

<h3>Storing and substituting golden syrup</h3>  
<p>Golden syrup lasts for months in a cool, dry place. If it crystallises, gently warm the jar in hot water to restore its smooth texture. For substitutes, honey or maple syrup can work, but adjust quantities as they have different densities. Always check conversions to ensure your air fryer recipes turn out perfectly.</p>

<p>Converting 355°F in a fan oven to a conventional oven is straightforward: it equals approximately 375°F in a standard oven. Fan ovens circulate hot air for faster, more even cooking, so you'll typically need to reduce the temperature by 20-25°F when using a conventional oven. This conversion ensures your baked goods and roasts come out perfectly every time.</p>

<h2>Why Convert 355 Fan Oven to Conventional Oven?</h2>
<p>Fan ovens cook food about 20% faster than conventional ovens due to their forced air circulation. When a recipe calls for 355°F in a fan oven, using the same temperature in a conventional oven could lead to overcooking or burning. That's why adjusting to 375°F in a traditional oven gives similar results. This is particularly important for delicate bakes like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>cakes</a> or cookies where precise temperatures matter.</p>
<p>Many modern recipes specify fan oven temperatures, especially those from the UK and Europe. If you're using an older conventional oven or American recipes, this conversion becomes essential. The same principle applies when using an air fryer, which works similarly to a fan oven. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more detailed equivalents.</p>

<h2>How to Adjust Cooking Times When Converting</h2>
<p>While temperature is crucial, cooking time adjustments are equally important when converting between oven types. As a general rule, reduce cooking time by about 10% when using a conventional oven compared to a fan oven. For example, if a recipe suggests 30 minutes at 355°F fan, try 27-28 minutes at 375°F conventional.</p>
<p>Always check food 5-10 minutes before the suggested cooking time ends. This is especially true for items like roasted <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken</a> or baked goods where doneness can vary. Use visual cues - golden brown colour for baked goods, clear juices for meats - rather than relying solely on timers. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a> includes both fan and conventional oven timings for your convenience.</p>

<h3>Special Considerations for Different Foods</h3>
<p>Some foods require more careful temperature management than others. Delicate items like soufflés or custards might need a slightly lower conventional oven temperature (around 365°F) to prevent cracking or curdling. Conversely, hearty roasts or root vegetables can often handle the full 375°F conversion without issues.</p>

<h2>Converting 355 Fan Oven to Air Fryer</h2>
<p>Air fryers operate similarly to fan ovens but in a much smaller space, which intensifies the heat circulation. For most recipes, you can use the same 355°F setting in your air fryer as in your fan oven, but reduce cooking time by about 20%. This makes air fryers perfect for quick, crispy results with foods like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/potatoes>potatoes</a> or frozen snacks.</p>
<p>Remember that air fryer baskets vary in size, so you may need to cook in batches to avoid overcrowding. For best results, shake or turn food halfway through cooking.

<h3>Common Mistakes to Avoid</h3>
<p>One frequent error is forgetting that fan oven temperatures are typically about 20°F lower than their conventional counterparts. Another is not adjusting rack positions - in conventional ovens, the middle rack usually gives the most even heat distribution. Also, avoid opening the oven door frequently as this causes temperature fluctuations that can affect cooking results.</p>

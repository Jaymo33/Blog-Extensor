<p>0.33 cup of lemon juice equals approximately 2.64 fluid ounces (fl oz). Whether you're preparing a zesty marinade or a tangy glaze for air fryer dishes, precise measurements matter. This conversion ensures your recipes turn out perfectly every time.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on precise ingredient ratios for even cooking and perfect texture. Too much or too little lemon juice can alter the acidity, affecting taste and browning. For example, a <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>lemon-herb chicken recipe</a> needs the right balance to avoid overpowering flavours. Measuring 0.33 cup of lemon juice correctly (2.64 fl oz) ensures consistency.</p>  

<p>Using a kitchen scale for liquids like lemon juice can improve accuracy. However, if you only have measuring cups, knowing that 0.33 cup converts to 2.64 fl oz simplifies the process. Check our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more handy measurement tips.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure 0.33 Cup of Lemon Juice Without a Scale</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a scale, use a liquid measuring cup marked in ounces. Fill it to the 2.64 fl oz line for 0.33 cup of lemon juice. Alternatively, use a standard 1/3 cup measure and reduce it slightly—this method works in a pinch for recipes like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>air fryer chicken dishes</a>.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for 0.33 Cup of Lemon Juice in Air Fryer Recipes</h2>  
<p>Lemon juice adds brightness to marinades, dressings, and glazes. For example, 0.33 cup (2.64 fl oz) works well in a honey-lemon glaze for salmon or a citrusy drizzle for roasted vegetables. It’s also ideal for deglazing pans when making sauces for air-fried meats.</p>  

<p>Prepping ahead? Freeze 0.33 cup portions of lemon juice in ice cube trays for future use. This trick saves time when whipping up quick <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/frozen-foods>frozen air fryer meals</a>. Just thaw and measure as needed.</p>  

<h3>Converting Other Lemon Juice Measurements</h3>  
<p>Need different amounts? One full cup of lemon juice equals 8 fl oz, so halving it gives 4 fl oz (0.5 cup). For smaller quantities, 0.25 cup is 2 fl oz. Bookmark our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion guide</a> for quick reference.</p>  

<h2>Tips for Storing Lemon Juice</h2>  
<p>Fresh lemon juice lasts 2–3 days in the fridge. To extend its life, store it in an airtight container or freeze it. If using bottled lemon juice, check the label—some brands concentrate differently, affecting measurements. Always clean your <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer basket</a> after cooking acidic foods to prevent residue buildup.</p>

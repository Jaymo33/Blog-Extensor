<p>473 F converts to approximately 245 C in a fan oven. This is the standard equivalent for most UK fan-assisted ovens and air fryers, making it easier to adapt American recipes. Whether you're using a Ninja, Philips, or another brand, this conversion ensures your dishes cook evenly without burning.</p>

<h2>Why Convert 473 F to Fan Oven?</h2>
<p>Many air fryer recipes, especially those from the US, list temperatures in Fahrenheit. Converting 473 F to fan oven settings (245 C) helps UK users achieve the same crispy results. Fan ovens circulate hot air, similar to air fryers, so this temperature works well for fried chicken, roasted veggies, or baked goods. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more common equivalents.</p>
<p>Using 245 C in a fan oven mimics the intense heat of an air fryer at 473 F. This is ideal for recipes like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>crispy chicken wings</a> or quick-roasted potatoes. Remember, fan ovens cook faster than conventional ones, so reduce cooking times by 10-15% to avoid overcooking.</p>

<h2>Adjusting Air Fryer Recipes for Fan Ovens</h2>
<p>If your air fryer recipe calls for 473 F, set your fan oven to 245 C and monitor the food closely. Air fryers heat more aggressively, so you might need to extend the time slightly. For example, 20 minutes in an air fryer could take 25 minutes in a fan oven. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a> includes adjusted timings for both appliances.</p>
<p>Pro tip: Use the middle rack in your fan oven for even cooking. Place a tray of water on the bottom shelf to prevent drying out dishes like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>air fryer cakes</a>. For meats, insert a thermometer to ensure they reach safe internal temperatures.</p>

<h3>Common Dishes Cooked at 473 F / 245 C</h3>
<p>This temperature works beautifully for crispy foods. Think homemade onion rings, reheated pizza, or even <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/frozen-foods>frozen snacks</a>. The high heat creates a golden exterior while keeping interiors tender. Just space items evenly on the tray to allow proper airflow.</p>

<h2>Troubleshooting Fan Oven Conversions</h2>
<p>If food browns too quickly at 245 C, try lowering to 230 C and extending the time. Every oven varies, so keep notes for future reference. For cleaning burnt-on grease, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning guide</a> has eco-friendly solutions. Always preheat your fan oven for 10 minutes before cooking at 473 F equivalents.</p>
<p>Glass or ceramic dishes may require 5-10 extra minutes compared to metal trays. Rotate pans halfway through for uniform browning. Remember, 473 F in an air fryer equals 245 C in a fan oven, but adjustments ensure perfection.</p>

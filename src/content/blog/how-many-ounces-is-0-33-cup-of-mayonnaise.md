<p>0.33 cup of mayonnaise equals approximately 2.64 ounces. This conversion is essential for precise cooking, especially when using an air fryer where measurements can make or break a recipe. Whether you’re preparing a creamy dip or a savoury coating, knowing the exact weight ensures consistent results every time.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>
<p>Air fryers rely on precise ingredient ratios to achieve the perfect texture and flavour. Using too much or too little mayonnaise can affect the crispiness or moisture of your dish. For example, a <a href="https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes">chicken recipe</a> might call for 0.33 cup of mayonnaise to coat the meat evenly. Measuring it correctly in ounces ensures the coating isn’t too thick or thin.</p>
<p>Many air fryer enthusiasts swear by weighing ingredients for better consistency. A kitchen scale can help you measure 2.64 ounces of mayonnaise effortlessly. If you’re new to air frying, check out our <a href="https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart">conversion chart</a> for other common measurements used in recipes.</p>

<h2>How to Measure 0.33 Cup of Mayonnaise Without a Scale</h2>
<p>Not everyone has a kitchen scale handy, but you can still measure 0.33 cup of mayonnaise accurately. Use a liquid measuring cup and fill it to the one-third mark, then add a teaspoon to account for the extra 0.33. This method works well for thicker condiments like mayonnaise.</p>
<p>Alternatively, you can eyeball it by dividing a standard 8-ounce cup of mayonnaise into roughly three parts. One part will be close to 0.33 cup or 2.64 ounces. For more tips on measuring ingredients, explore our <a href="https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/meal-prep">meal prep guides</a>.</p>

<h3>Common Recipes Using 0.33 Cup of Mayonnaise</h3>
<p>Many air fryer recipes call for 0.33 cup of mayonnaise, such as crispy chicken tenders or potato salads. This amount is perfect for coating four chicken breasts or mixing into a batch of <a href="https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/potatoes">air-fried potatoes</a>. The creamy texture helps bind breadcrumbs or spices for a golden finish.</p>

<h2>Converting Other Mayonnaise Measurements</h2>
<p>If your recipe requires a different amount of mayonnaise, here’s a quick reference: 1 cup equals 8 ounces, so 0.5 cup is 4 ounces, and 0.25 cup is 2 ounces. These conversions are handy for scaling recipes up or down, especially when meal prepping for a family.</p>
<p>For larger batches, you might need to convert tablespoons to ounces. One tablespoon of mayonnaise is roughly 0.5 ounce, so 0.33 cup (5.33 tablespoons) equals 2.64 ounces.

<h3>Tips for Storing Mayonnaise in Your Kitchen</h3>
<p>Mayonnaise should be stored in the fridge to maintain freshness. If you’re using it frequently for air fryer recipes, consider transferring it to a squeeze bottle for easy dispensing. Always check the expiry date, as old mayonnaise can spoil your dish.</p>

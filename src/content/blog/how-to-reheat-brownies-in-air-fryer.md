<p>Reheating brownies in an air fryer is simple: preheat to 160°C (320°F), warm for 3–5 minutes, and enjoy gooey, fresh-tasting results. The air fryer’s rapid hot air circulation ensures even heating without drying them out, making it the best way to reheat brownies quickly. Whether you’ve stored them in the fridge or left them at room temperature, this method works brilliantly.</p>  

<h2>Why Use an Air Fryer to Reheat Brownies?</h2>  
<p>Air fryers excel at reheating baked goods like brownies because they distribute heat evenly, preventing soggy or overcooked spots. Unlike microwaves, which can make brownies rubbery, the air fryer restores a crisp edge while keeping the centre soft. It’s also faster than using an oven, perfect for when you crave warm brownies without the wait.

<p>Another advantage is control. You can adjust the temperature and time to suit your preference—whether you like slightly crispy edges or an ultra-gooey middle. Plus, reheating brownies in an air fryer prevents the dryness that often comes with microwaving. It’s a game-changer for dessert lovers!</p>  

<h3>Best Temperature to Reheat Brownies</h3>  
<p>160°C (320°F) is the ideal air fryer temperature for reheating brownies. This gentle heat warms them through without burning the edges or drying them out. If your brownies are fridge-cold, add an extra minute to the timing. For frozen brownies, thaw them first or extend the reheating time by 2–3 minutes.</p>  

<h2>Step-by-Step Guide to Reheating Brownies</h2>  
<p>Start by preheating your air fryer to 160°C (320°F) for 3 minutes. Place the brownies in the basket in a single layer, leaving space between them for air circulation. Heat for 3–5 minutes, checking at the 3-minute mark to avoid overdoing it. For extra moisture, spritz them lightly with water or cover with foil.</p>  

<p>If reheating multiple brownies, work in batches to ensure even results. Serve immediately for that just-baked texture.

<h3>How Long to Reheat Brownies</h3>  
<p>3–5 minutes is usually enough, but thicker or fridge-cold brownies may need up to 6 minutes. Keep an eye on them—overheating can make them dry. If you’re reheating frosted brownies, reduce the time to 2–3 minutes to prevent melting.</p>  

<h2>Tips for Perfectly Reheated Brownies</h2>  
<p>For crispy edges, reheat uncovered. For softer results, cover with foil or add a damp paper towel underneath. If your brownies are stale, a quick brush with milk or butter before reheating can revive them. Always let them cool slightly before eating—the chocolate stays hotter than you’d expect!</p>  

<p>Store leftover brownies in an airtight container to maintain freshness. For more dessert ideas, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert category</a>.

<h3>Reheating Frozen Brownies</h3>  
<p>Thaw frozen brownies first for best results, then reheat as usual. If short on time, add 2–3 extra minutes to the reheating time, checking frequently. Avoid overheating, as frozen brownies can dry out faster.</p>

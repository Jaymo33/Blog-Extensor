<p>0.5 tbsp of rice weighs approximately 6 grams, though this can vary slightly depending on the type of rice. Whether you're using an air fryer or cooking traditionally, accurate measurements ensure consistent results.

<h2>Why Measuring Rice Accurately Matters</h2>  
<p>Getting the right amount of rice is crucial for portion control and recipe accuracy. Too much or too little can throw off the texture and cooking time, especially in an air fryer. For example, if you're making a quick <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable stir-fry</a>, precise rice measurements ensure even cooking.</p>  
<p>Rice expands as it cooks, so 0.5 tbsp of uncooked rice will yield more once prepared. This is why many <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> specify uncooked measurements. Knowing the gram equivalent helps if your recipe uses weight instead of volume.</p>  

<h2>Types of Rice and Their Weights</h2>  
<p>Not all rice weighs the same per tablespoon. Long-grain white rice, for instance, is lighter than short-grain or brown rice. Here’s a quick breakdown of common varieties:</p>  
<ul>  
<li>White rice (long-grain): ~6g per 0.5 tbsp</li>  
<li>Brown rice: ~7g per 0.5 tbsp</li>  
<li>Basmati or jasmine: ~5.5g per 0.5 tbsp</li>  
</ul>

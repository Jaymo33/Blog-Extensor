<p>635 ml of olive oil equals approximately 2.68 cups. This conversion is essential for anyone using an air fryer, as precise measurements can make or break a recipe. Whether you're baking, frying, or roasting, knowing how to convert millilitres to cups ensures your dishes turn out perfectly every time. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we understand the importance of accurate measurements, especially when working with olive oil in air fryers.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Olive Oil Measurements Matter</h2>
<p>Using the right amount of olive oil in your air fryer recipes is crucial for achieving the perfect texture and flavour. Too much oil can make food greasy, while too little may result in dry or unevenly cooked dishes. Converting 635 ml of olive oil to cups ensures you get the balance just right. Many air fryer recipes, like those found in our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipes section</a>, rely on precise measurements for consistent results.</p>
<p>Olive oil is a staple in Mediterranean cooking and works wonderfully in air fryers for everything from roasted vegetables to crispy chicken. Knowing that 635 ml of olive oil equals roughly 2.68 cups helps you follow recipes accurately, whether they're from the UK, USA, or elsewhere. This conversion is particularly useful when scaling recipes up or down, ensuring your air fryer meals turn out perfectly every time.</p>

<h2>How to Measure 635 ml of Olive Oil in Cups</h2>
<p>To measure 635 ml of olive oil in cups, you'll need a liquid measuring cup for accuracy. The standard conversion is 1 cup = 237 ml, so 635 ml works out to about 2.68 cups. For air fryer cooking, it's best to use a clear measuring cup with millilitre and cup markings to ensure precision.

<h3>US vs UK Cup Measurements</h3>
<p>While the difference is minimal, it's worth noting that US and UK cup measurements vary slightly. In the UK, 1 cup equals 284 ml, while in the US it's 237 ml. For 635 ml of olive oil, this means approximately 2.24 UK cups or 2.68 US cups. Most modern recipes, including those on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, use the US standard unless specified otherwise.</p>

<h2>Using 635 ml of Olive Oil in Air Fryer Recipes</h2>
<p>635 ml (about 2.68 cups) of olive oil is enough for multiple batches of air fryer recipes. From crispy potatoes to succulent chicken, olive oil helps achieve that perfect golden finish.

<h3>Tips for Measuring Olive Oil Accurately</h3>
<p>When measuring 635 ml of olive oil (2.68 cups), always use a liquid measuring cup on a level surface. For small amounts, consider using a kitchen scale for greater precision. Remember that olive oil's viscosity means it pours differently than water, so take your time when measuring for air fryer recipes to ensure accuracy.</p>

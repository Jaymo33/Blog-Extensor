<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Using the correct amount of peanut butter—or any ingredient—ensures your air fryer dishes turn out perfectly. Too much can make recipes greasy, while too little may dry them out. Air fryers cook food quickly, so even small measurement errors can have noticeable effects. For example, 50g of peanut butter (1.76 oz) is ideal for binding ingredients in energy balls or adding richness to sauces. Explore more precision-based recipes on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>our recipes page</a>.</p>  

<p>Peanut butter’s density means volume measures (like tablespoons) can vary, making weight more reliable. A kitchen scale is the best tool, but if you’re converting on the fly, remember that 50g peanut butter to ounces is roughly 1.76 oz. This accuracy is especially useful for baking, where ratios are critical. Need to adjust portion sizes? Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert category</a> has adaptable ideas.</p>  

<h3>How to measure peanut butter without a scale</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a scale, two level tablespoons of peanut butter will be close to 50g (1.76 oz). However, brands vary in density, so this isn’t exact. For sticky ingredients like peanut butter, lightly oiling your measuring spoon helps release it cleanly. This trick is handy when prepping air fryer granola or marinades.

<h2>Common uses for 50g of peanut butter in air fryer recipes</h2>  
<p>50g of peanut butter (1.76 oz) is a versatile quantity. It’s enough for a batch of 6–8 peanut butter cookies or a creamy satay sauce for chicken skewers. In air fryers, peanut butter can also glaze roasted vegetables or bind protein bars. For inspiration, browse our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/breakfast>breakfast recipes</a>, where peanut butter adds richness to oats or toast toppings.</p>

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>
<p>Air fryers rely on precise cooking times and temperatures, and ingredient measurements are just as crucial. Using the correct amount of maple syrup, like 0.25 tbsp (3.75 grams), ensures your food caramelises perfectly without burning. Too much syrup can lead to sticky, unevenly cooked dishes, while too little might leave your meal lacking flavour.</p>
<p>At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we emphasise the importance of accurate conversions for perfect results.

<h2>How to measure 0.25 tbsp of maple syrup accurately</h2>

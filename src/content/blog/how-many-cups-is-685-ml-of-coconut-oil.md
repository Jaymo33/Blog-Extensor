<p>685 ml of coconut oil equals approximately 2.9 cups. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes, where precise measurements can make or break your dish. Whether you're baking, frying, or roasting, knowing how to convert millilitres to cups ensures consistent results every time.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of coconut oil in your air fryer can affect texture, flavour, and cooking time. Too much oil can make food greasy, while too little may leave it dry. For perfect results, always measure liquids like coconut oil carefully. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more handy tips.</p>  

<p>Many air fryer recipes, especially those for baked goods or crispy snacks, rely on coconut oil for moisture and crispiness. If you’re adapting a recipe from metric to imperial measurements, this conversion is a lifesaver. Visit <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>our recipe collection</a> for inspiration.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure Coconut Oil Correctly</h3>  
<p>Coconut oil can be tricky to measure because it changes texture with temperature. For solid oil, pack it into a measuring cup and level it off. For liquid oil, pour it into a liquid measuring cup for accuracy. This ensures your 685 ml of coconut oil translates perfectly to 2.9 cups.</p>  

<h2>Converting 685 ml of Coconut Oil for Different Recipes</h2>  
<p>Whether you’re making air-fried desserts or savoury dishes, 685 ml of coconut oil (2.9 cups) works in most recipes. For example, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>air fryer cake recipes</a> often use coconut oil for a moist crumb.

<h3>Common Mistakes When Measuring Coconut Oil</h3>  
<p>One mistake is assuming all oils measure the same. Coconut oil’s density varies depending on its state, so always measure by volume, not weight. Another error is using the wrong cup size—stick to standard US cups (240 ml) for consistency.</p>

<h3>Storing Coconut Oil for Long-Term Use</h3>

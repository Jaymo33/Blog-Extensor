<p>2 tablespoons (tbsp) of minced garlic equals approximately 28 grams. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precision ensures perfect flavour and texture. Whether you're whipping up garlic-infused chicken or roasted vegetables, knowing the exact weight helps avoid overpowering or underwhelming results. For more handy conversions, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate garlic measurements matter</h2>  
<p>Garlic is a powerhouse of flavour, but too much or too little can drastically alter your dish. In an air fryer, where cooking times are shorter, precise measurements ensure even distribution. A heaped tablespoon might accidentally add 5-10 extra grams, throwing off your recipe. For consistent results, level off your minced garlic with a knife. Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>garlic-heavy recipes</a> to put this knowledge to the test.</p>  

<p>Different brands of minced garlic may vary slightly in density due to oil or preservatives. If using jarred minced garlic, drain excess liquid before measuring. Freshly minced garlic tends to be lighter, so adjust accordingly. For meal prep efficiency, consider our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/meal-prep>meal prep category</a> with garlic-friendly dishes.</p>  

<h3>Tools for measuring minced garlic</h3>  
<p>A standard UK tablespoon holds 15ml, but minced garlic's sticky texture makes scooping tricky. Use a small spatula to pack it lightly without air gaps. Digital kitchen scales are ideal for grams, especially when scaling recipes. If you're converting larger quantities, remember that 1 cup of minced garlic is roughly 135 grams.</p>  

<h2>Common recipes using 2 tbsp minced garlic</h2>  
<p>Many air fryer staples rely on this measurement, like garlic butter shrimp or crispy potatoes. For example, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>garlic Parmesan chicken</a> uses exactly 2 tbsp (28g) for balanced pungency. Garlic burns easily in air fryers, so mix it with oil or add it midway through cooking. Always preheat your air fryer to prevent clumping.</p>  

<p>Vegetarian options shine too—try tossing 28g of minced garlic with olive oil and broccoli florets. The high heat caramelises the garlic beautifully. For cleaning sticky garlic residue afterwards, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner guide</a> has pro tips. Remember, 2 tbsp minced garlic also works wonders in marinades for tofu or mushrooms.</p>  

<h3>Converting other garlic forms</h3>  
<p>If substituting garlic paste, use 25g for 2 tbsp minced garlic. Granulated garlic requires just 10g for equivalent flavour. Whole garlic cloves vary, but one medium clove yields about 1 tsp (5g) when minced.

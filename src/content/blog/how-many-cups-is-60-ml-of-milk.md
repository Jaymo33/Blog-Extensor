<p>60 ml of milk equals approximately 0.25 cups (or 1/4 cup). This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes, where precise measurements can make or break your dish. Whether you’re whipping up a cake, a creamy sauce, or a batter, knowing how to convert 60 ml of milk to cups ensures perfect results every time.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on even cooking, and incorrect measurements can throw off textures and flavours. For example, adding too much milk to a batter can make it too runny, while too little can leave it dry. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we emphasise precision to help you achieve restaurant-quality results at home.</p>  
<p>Many air fryer recipes, like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>cakes</a> or <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/breakfast>breakfast dishes</a>, call for small amounts of milk. Measuring 60 ml of milk correctly ensures your dishes turn out just right. A handy <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a> can save time and avoid kitchen mishaps.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure 60 ml of Milk Without a Measuring Cup</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a measuring cup, you can use a tablespoon. Since 1 tablespoon holds about 15 ml, 60 ml of milk equals 4 tablespoons. This method works well for small quantities, especially when preparing sauces or marinades in your air fryer.</p>  

<h2>Converting 60 ml of Milk for Different Recipes</h2>  
<p>Whether you’re following a UK or US recipe, 60 ml of milk remains roughly 0.25 cups. However, slight variations can occur based on the type of milk (whole, skim, or plant-based). For <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a>, consistency is key, so always measure carefully.</p>  
<p>For baking, like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>desserts</a>, even a small discrepancy can affect rising or texture. If your recipe calls for 60 ml of milk, use a liquid measuring cup for accuracy. Avoid guessing, as air fryers amplify cooking inconsistencies.</p>  

<h3>Common Uses for 60 ml of Milk in Air Fryer Cooking</h3>  
<p>This small amount of milk is often used in batters, glazes, or creamy dips. For example, a light brushing of milk on air-fryer scones enhances browning.

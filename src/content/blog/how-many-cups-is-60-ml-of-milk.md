<p>60 ml of milk equals approximately 0.25 cups (or 1/4 cup). This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes, where precise measurements can make or break your dish.

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on even cooking, and incorrect measurements can throw off textures and flavours.

<h3>How to Measure 60 ml of Milk Without a Measuring Cup</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a measuring cup, you can use a tablespoon. Since 1 tablespoon holds about 15 ml, 60 ml of milk equals 4 tablespoons. This method works well for small quantities, especially when preparing sauces or marinades in your air fryer.</p>  

<h2>Converting 60 ml of Milk for Different Recipes</h2>  
<p>Whether you’re following a UK or US recipe, 60 ml of milk remains roughly 0.25 cups. However, slight variations can occur based on the type of milk (whole, skim, or plant-based). For <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a>, consistency is key, so always measure carefully.</p>  
<p>For baking, like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>desserts</a>, even a small discrepancy can affect rising or texture.

<p>2.25 cups of icing sugar equals approximately 270 grams. This conversion is essential for precise baking, especially when using an air fryer where measurements can make or break a recipe. Whether you’re making cakes, cookies, or frosting, knowing the exact gram equivalent ensures consistency. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we focus on helping you achieve perfect results every time with accurate conversions.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Baking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers require precise ingredient measurements to ensure even cooking and perfect texture. Too much or too little icing sugar can affect the moisture and structure of your baked goods. For example, if you’re making air fryer cookies, 270 grams of icing sugar will give the right sweetness without making them too dense. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more handy baking tips.</p>  

<p>Different brands of icing sugar may have slight variations in density, but 270 grams is a reliable standard. If you’re using a UK or US cup measurement, this conversion remains consistent. For more air fryer-friendly recipes, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipes section</a> for inspiration.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure Icing Sugar Correctly</h3>  
<p>For the most accurate results, use a digital kitchen scale to measure 270 grams of icing sugar. If you don’t have one, lightly spoon the sugar into a measuring cup and level it off with a knife. Avoid packing it down, as this can lead to an incorrect measurement. This method ensures your air fryer desserts turn out perfectly every time.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for 2.25 Cups of Icing Sugar</h2>  
<p>This quantity is ideal for frosting a batch of cupcakes or making a glaze for air fryer cakes. You can also use it in cookie dough or dusting desserts for a professional finish. If you’re experimenting with air fryer desserts, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>cake recipes</a> for delicious ideas.</p>  

<p>Another great use is in no-bake treats like fudge or meringues. Since air fryers excel at delicate baking, precise measurements ensure your creations are flawless. For more tips on maintaining your appliance, see our guide on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning your air fryer</a> to keep it in top condition.</p>  

<h3>Converting Other Sugar Measurements</h3>  
<p>If you need to adjust the recipe, remember that 1 cup of icing sugar is roughly 120 grams. This makes scaling up or down simple. Whether you’re halving a recipe or doubling it, keeping this ratio in mind ensures consistency.

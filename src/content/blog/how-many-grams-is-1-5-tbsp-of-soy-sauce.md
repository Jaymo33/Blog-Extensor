<p>1.5 tablespoons (tbsp) of soy sauce equals approximately 22.5 grams (g). This conversion is essential for precise cooking, especially when using an air fryer where measurements can impact texture and flavour. Whether you're marinating chicken, seasoning tofu, or preparing a glaze, knowing the exact weight ensures consistency in your dishes.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate soy sauce measurements matter</h2>  
<p>Using the correct amount of soy sauce is crucial for balancing flavours in your air fryer recipes. Too little can leave your dish bland, while too much may make it overly salty. For example, a marinade for <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>air fryer chicken</a> relies on precise soy sauce quantities to achieve the perfect umami taste. Grams provide a more accurate measurement than volume, especially for liquids like soy sauce, which can vary in density.</p>  
<p>If you're preparing a stir-fry or glaze, converting 1.5 tbsp of soy sauce to grams ensures your dish turns out just right. Many <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> list ingredients by weight, so having this conversion handy saves time and avoids guesswork. Plus, it helps when scaling recipes up or down for meal prep or smaller portions.</p>  

<h2>How to measure soy sauce accurately</h2>  
<p>For the most precise results, use a digital kitchen scale to weigh your soy sauce. Simply place your measuring spoon on the scale, tare it to zero, then pour the soy sauce until you reach 22.5 grams. If you don’t have a scale, levelling off your tablespoon with a knife ensures a consistent 15 grams per tbsp, making 1.5 tbsp equal to 22.5 grams.</p>  

<h3>Common soy sauce conversions</h3>  
<p>Here’s a quick reference for other soy sauce measurements in grams: 1 tbsp = 15g, 2 tbsp = 30g, and 3 tbsp = 45g. These conversions are handy when adjusting recipes or using different quantities.

<h2>Using soy sauce in air fryer recipes</h2>  
<p>Soy sauce is a staple in many air fryer dishes, from crispy tofu to glazed salmon. Its salty, savoury flavour enhances meats, vegetables, and even <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>air-fried veggies</a>. When measuring 1.5 tbsp (22.5g) of soy sauce for a marinade, combine it with ingredients like garlic, honey, or ginger for a delicious coating.</p>  
<p>For sticky glazes or sauces, reducing soy sauce with a bit of sugar or mirin creates a glossy finish on air-fried dishes. Just remember to account for evaporation if you’re reducing the liquid.

<h3>Tips for substituting soy sauce</h3>  
<p>If you’re out of soy sauce, alternatives like tamari, coconut aminos, or liquid aminos can work. However, their saltiness and density may vary, so adjust the grams accordingly. For example, tamari is slightly thicker, so 1.5 tbsp might weigh closer to 24 grams. Always taste as you go when substituting!</p>

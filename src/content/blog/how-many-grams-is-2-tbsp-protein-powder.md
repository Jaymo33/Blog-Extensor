<p>2 tablespoons (tbsp) of protein powder typically weigh around 15–20 grams, depending on the brand and density. This conversion is essential for precise cooking, baking, or meal prep, especially when using an air fryer. Whether you're making protein-packed snacks or adding a boost to your meals, knowing the exact weight ensures consistency.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate protein powder measurements matter</h2>  
<p>Getting the right amount of protein powder can make or break a recipe. Too much can make baked goods dry, while too little might not give you the desired protein boost. If you're using an air fryer for protein snacks like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>energy balls or protein bars</a>, precise measurements ensure perfect texture and flavour. A digital kitchen scale is the best tool for accuracy, but if you don’t have one, knowing the gram equivalent of tablespoons helps.</p>  

<p>Different brands of protein powder vary in density, so weights can differ slightly. Whey protein tends to be lighter, while plant-based options like pea or soy protein may be denser. Checking the nutrition label for serving sizes in grams can also help. For more conversion tips, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>  

<h3>How to measure protein powder without a scale</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a scale, use the spoon-and-level method for accuracy. Scoop the protein powder into the tablespoon without packing it down, then level it off with a knife. This prevents over-measuring, which can throw off your recipe. For best results, stick to the same brand and type of protein powder once you’ve found the right measurement.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for protein powder in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Protein powder isn’t just for shakes—it’s great for air fryer recipes too! You can add it to pancake batter, muffins, or even crispy protein cookies. If you're meal prepping, try making <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/breakfast>high-protein breakfast bites</a> that reheat perfectly in the air fryer. Since air frying requires precise ingredient ratios, knowing how many grams are in 2 tbsp of protein powder helps avoid dry or crumbly results.</p>  

<p>Another great use is coating foods like chicken or tofu in a protein-enhanced breading. Mix protein powder with spices and a little flour for a crispy, high-protein crust. Just remember that protein powder can brown faster than regular flour, so adjust cooking times accordingly.

<h3>Protein powder substitutions in recipes</h3>  
<p>If you run out of protein powder, you can substitute it with almond flour or oat flour, but the texture and protein content will differ. Always adjust liquid ingredients slightly since protein powder absorbs moisture.

<p>100g of worcestershire sauce equals approximately 3.53 ounces. Whether you’re preparing a marinade or adding flavour to your air fryer dishes, getting the measurements right is crucial. Worcestershire sauce is a staple in many kitchens, and knowing how to convert grams to ounces ensures your recipes turn out perfectly every time.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Precision is key when cooking with an air fryer, especially for sauces like worcestershire. Too much or too little can alter the taste and texture of your dish. For example, if you’re making a glaze for air fryer chicken wings, 100g of worcestershire sauce (3.53 ounces) provides the ideal balance of tangy and savoury flavours. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more handy measurement tips.</p>  

<p>Using the correct amount ensures even cooking and prevents overpowering your meal. Whether you’re following a recipe from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> or experimenting with your own creations, accurate conversions make all the difference. Worcestershire sauce is dense, so measuring by weight (grams or ounces) is more reliable than volume.</p>  

<h2>How to measure 100g of worcestershire sauce</h2>  
<p>If you don’t have a kitchen scale, you can still measure 100g of worcestershire sauce using tablespoons. One tablespoon holds roughly 15g, so 100g is about 6.5 tablespoons. However, for the most precise results, a digital scale is best. This ensures your air fryer dishes, like our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>air fryer chicken recipes</a>, turn out perfectly seasoned.</p>  

<h3>Converting grams to ounces for other ingredients</h3>  
<p>Many air fryer recipes use grams or ounces, so knowing how to convert between them is useful. For example, 100g of flour is around 3.53 ounces, just like worcestershire sauce. However, ingredients vary in density, so always double-check conversions. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a> simplifies this process for all your cooking needs.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for worcestershire sauce in air fryer recipes</h2>  
<p>Worcestershire sauce adds depth to marinades, glazes, and even burgers cooked in the air fryer. For instance, 100g (3.53 ounces) can be mixed with honey and garlic for a delicious glaze. It’s also great in meatloaf or as a seasoning for roasted vegetables. Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/beef>air fryer beef recipes</a> for more inspiration.</p>  

<p>Since worcestershire sauce is concentrated, a little goes a long way. Measuring 100g accurately ensures your dishes aren’t too salty or overpowering. Whether you’re cooking for one or meal prepping, precise measurements guarantee consistent results. Don’t forget to clean your air fryer after cooking saucy dishes—check out our guide on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>how to clean your air fryer</a>.</p>  

<h3>Storing worcestershire sauce for freshness</h3>  
<p>To keep your worcestershire sauce fresh, store it in a cool, dark place. Once opened, it lasts about a year in the pantry. If you use it frequently in air fryer recipes, consider buying smaller bottles to maintain flavour quality. Proper storage ensures your 100g measurements stay consistent over time.</p>

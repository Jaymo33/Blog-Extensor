<p>85 ml of soy sauce is approximately 0.36 cups (just over 1/3 cup). This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements can make or break a dish. Whether you're marinating chicken or whipping up a stir-fry, knowing how to convert ml to cups ensures your flavours are spot-on.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Soy Sauce Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of soy sauce is crucial in cooking, especially in an air fryer where flavours intensify. Too much can overpower a dish, while too little might leave it bland. For example, if you're making <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer teriyaki chicken</a>, 85 ml of soy sauce (0.36 cups) balances sweetness and saltiness perfectly. Always measure liquids properly to avoid recipe mishaps.</p>  

<p>Many air fryer recipes, like those on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, list ingredients in metric and imperial units. If you're using a US recipe, note that 1 US cup equals 240 ml, while a UK cup is 284 ml. For 85 ml of soy sauce, stick to the 0.36 cup measurement to stay accurate.</p>  

<h3>Tools for Measuring Soy Sauce</h3>  
<p>A liquid measuring cup or kitchen scale is ideal for converting 85 ml of soy sauce to cups. If you don’t have these, a standard tablespoon holds 15 ml, so roughly 5.5 tablespoons equal 85 ml. For air fryer marinades, precision ensures even cooking and flavour distribution.</p>  

<h2>Converting 85 ml of Soy Sauce for Air Fryer Recipes</h2>  
<p>When adapting recipes for your air fryer, converting 85 ml of soy sauce to cups (0.36 cups) helps maintain consistency. For instance, <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>air fryer chicken recipes</a> often use soy sauce for depth of flavour. Too much liquid can affect crispiness, so measure carefully.</p>  

<p>If you’re scaling a recipe up or down, refer to <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>our conversion chart</a> for quick adjustments. Whether you're cooking for one or a family, knowing that 85 ml of soy sauce equals 0.36 cups simplifies meal prep.</p>  

<h3>Soy Sauce Substitutes and Adjustments</h3>  
<p>If you’re out of soy sauce, coconut aminos or tamari can work, but adjust quantities since their saltiness varies. For 85 ml of soy sauce (0.36 cups), start with slightly less substitute and taste as you go. Air fryer dishes like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>glazed veggies</a> rely on balanced flavours.</p>  

<h2>Common Mistakes When Measuring Soy Sauce</h2>  
<p>Pouring soy sauce directly from the bottle often leads to over-measuring. Instead, use a measuring cup for 85 ml (0.36 cups) to avoid overly salty dishes. In air fryer cooking, excess liquid can also cause steaming instead of crisping.</p>  

<p>Another mistake is ignoring regional cup differences. If a recipe calls for 85 ml of soy sauce, stick to the ml measurement or confirm whether it’s US or UK cups. For more tips, check <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning guides</a> to keep your air fryer in top shape after saucy recipes.</p>  

<h3>Storing Leftover Soy Sauce</h3>  
<p>After measuring 85 ml of soy sauce, store the bottle in a cool, dark place to preserve its flavour. If you frequently use small amounts, consider a squeeze bottle for easier pouring and less waste in air fryer recipes.</p>

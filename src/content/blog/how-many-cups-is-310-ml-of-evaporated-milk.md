<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of evaporated milk can make or break a recipe. Too little, and your dish might lack creaminess; too much, and it could become overly dense.

<p>Evaporated milk is thicker than regular milk, so its volume-to-weight ratio differs. This means 310 ml of evaporated milk won't weigh the same as 310 ml of whole milk. Always use a measuring jug or kitchen scales for accuracy, especially when preparing dishes like air fryer cheesecakes or custards.</p>  

<h2>Converting 310 ml of Evaporated Milk to Cups</h2>  
<p>To convert 310 ml of evaporated milk to cups, you'll need to know that 1 cup equals 236.59 ml. Dividing 310 by 236.59 gives you roughly 1.31 cups. This measurement is particularly useful for UK bakers, as many recipes use metric measurements. If you're in the USA, this conversion still applies, as cup sizes are standardized.</p>

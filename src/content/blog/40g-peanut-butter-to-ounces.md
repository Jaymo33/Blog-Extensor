<p>40 grams (40g) of peanut butter equals approximately 1.41 ounces (oz). Whether you’re whipping up a batch of air fryer cookies or a savoury peanut sauce, getting the measurement right is key. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we know how crucial accurate conversions are for perfect results every time.</p>  

<h2>Why converting 40g of peanut butter to ounces matters</h2>  
<p>Many UK air fryer recipes use grams, but if your kitchen scale only measures ounces, knowing the conversion is essential. Peanut butter’s thick consistency means even small measurement errors can affect texture and flavour. For example, adding too much can make cookies overly dense, while too little might leave sauces too runny. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> simplifies these calculations for all your cooking needs.</p>  

<p>Peanut butter is a staple in both sweet and savoury dishes, from protein-packed snacks to decadent desserts. Whether you’re making peanut butter cookies in your air fryer or a satay glaze for chicken, precision ensures consistency. Visit our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipes section</a> for inspiration on how to use this versatile ingredient.</p>  

<h3>How to measure 40g of peanut butter without scales</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have digital scales, two level tablespoons of peanut butter roughly equal 40g (1.41 oz). For sticky ingredients like peanut butter, lightly greasing the spoon helps it slide off cleanly. Alternatively, use a metric measuring jug for liquids – 40g of peanut butter fills about 2.5cm in a standard 250ml jug. Always level off the top for accuracy.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for 40g of peanut butter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>This small but mighty amount of peanut butter works wonders in air fryer recipes. Mix it into oatmeal for a protein boost, swirl it into brownie batter, or blend it into a glaze for crispy tofu. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert category</a> features peanut butter treats that’ll satisfy any sweet tooth.</p>  

<p>For savoury dishes, 40g of peanut butter makes enough sauce for two portions of air fryer satay chicken or a flavourful dip for vegetable spring rolls. The rich, nutty taste pairs perfectly with spices like cumin and chilli.

<h3>Storing peanut butter for accurate measurements</h3>  
<p>Natural peanut butter separates, so always stir it thoroughly before measuring. For consistent 40g portions, store jars upside down to redistribute oils evenly. If your peanut butter is refrigerated, let it sit at room temperature for 15 minutes – cold peanut butter compacts, leading to inaccurate measurements.</p>  

<h2>Converting other peanut butter amounts between grams and ounces</h2>  
<p>While 40g equals 1.41 oz, you might need other conversions for larger batches. Here’s a quick reference:</p>

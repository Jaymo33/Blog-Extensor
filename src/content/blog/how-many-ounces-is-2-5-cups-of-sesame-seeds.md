<p>2.5 cups of sesame seeds equal approximately 12 ounces (340 grams). This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements ensure perfect results. Whether you're making sesame-crusted chicken or adding seeds to a stir-fry, knowing the weight helps avoid under or over-seasoning.

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of sesame seeds can make or break a dish. Too few, and you lose flavour; too many, and the texture becomes overwhelming. The air fryer's intense heat means ingredients like sesame seeds toast quickly, so precision is key. Many recipes on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> rely on exact measurements for consistency. Whether you're cooking chicken, tofu, or vegetables, knowing 2.5 cups of sesame seeds equals 12 ounces ensures success.</p>  

<p>Measuring by weight (ounces) is often more reliable than volume (cups) because seeds can settle or vary in density. A kitchen scale eliminates guesswork, especially for air fryer recipes where even cooking is crucial. If you're prepping meals in advance, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/meal-prep>meal prep recipes</a> for ideas.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure Sesame Seeds for Air Fryer Recipes</h3>  
<p>For the most accurate results, use a digital scale to weigh 12 ounces (340 grams) of sesame seeds. If you don't have one, lightly spoon the seeds into a measuring cup without packing them down. Avoid tapping the cup, as this compacts the seeds and skews the measurement. This method ensures your 2.5 cups of sesame seeds to ounces conversion is spot-on.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for Sesame Seeds in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Sesame seeds add crunch and nutty flavour to air-fried dishes. Try them in coatings for chicken or tofu, sprinkled over roasted vegetables, or mixed into homemade granola. For inspiration, browse our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipes</a> or <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable dishes</a>. Remember, 2.5 cups of sesame seeds in ounces is 12, so adjust quantities accordingly.</p>  

<p>Toasting sesame seeds in the air fryer enhances their flavour. Spread 12 ounces (2.5 cups) evenly in the basket and cook at 160°C for 3–5 minutes, shaking occasionally. Store any leftovers in an airtight container to maintain freshness. For more tips on keeping your air fryer in top condition, see our guide on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaning</a>.</p>  

<h3>Converting Other Sesame Seed Measurements</h3>  
<p>If your recipe calls for a different amount, here are quick conversions: 1 cup of sesame seeds = 4.8 ounces, and ½ cup = 2.4 ounces. These ratios help scale recipes up or down while maintaining balance. Whether you're converting 2.5 cups of sesame seeds to oz or smaller quantities, consistency is key for air fryer success.</p>

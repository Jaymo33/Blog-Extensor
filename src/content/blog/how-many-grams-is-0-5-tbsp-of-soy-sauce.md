<h3>How to measure 0.5 tbsp of soy sauce without scales</h3>
<p>If you don’t have a kitchen scale, you can still measure 0.5 tbsp of soy sauce accurately. A standard UK tablespoon holds 15ml, so half is 7.5ml.

<h3>Converting other soy sauce measurements to grams</h3>
<p>While we’ve focused on 0.5 tbsp of soy sauce to grams (7.5g), you might need other conversions too. A full tablespoon is about 15g, and a teaspoon is roughly 5g. These conversions are handy when scaling recipes up or down. Remember that different brands of soy sauce may vary slightly in density, so these are approximate measurements.</p>

<h2>Tips for cooking with soy sauce in your air fryer</h2>
<p>When using soy sauce in your air fryer, always apply it as part of a marinade or glaze rather than pouring it directly onto food. This prevents dripping and makes cleanup easier. The 0.5 tbsp (7.5g) measurement works well for single portions or small batches. For larger quantities, simply scale up while maintaining the same ratios.</p>

<p>Soy sauce can burn at high temperatures, so it’s best used in the last few minutes of cooking or mixed with oil. This is particularly important when air frying at temperatures above 180°C.

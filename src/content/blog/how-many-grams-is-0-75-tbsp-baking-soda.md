<p>0.75 tbsp of baking soda equals approximately 11.25 grams. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements can make or break your dish. Whether you’re whipping up fluffy cakes or crispy snacks, knowing the exact weight ensures consistent results every time.</p>

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on even heat distribution, and incorrect ingredient quantities can lead to uneven cooking or texture issues. Baking soda, in particular, affects browning and rise, so getting the grams right is crucial.

<p>Using a digital scale for dry ingredients like baking soda eliminates guesswork. Unlike volume measurements (tbsp), weight (grams) accounts for density variations. This is especially handy for UK bakers, where metric measurements are standard.</p>

<h3>How to measure 0.75 tbsp baking soda without scales</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have scales, fill a tablespoon measure three-quarters full for 0.75 tbsp. However, for air fryer recipes requiring precision, we recommend investing in a kitchen scale.

<h2>Common uses for baking soda in air fryer recipes</h2>  
<p>Baking soda isn’t just for cakes – it’s a versatile air fryer staple. It helps crisp coatings on chicken wings, lightens batter for tempura, and even neutralises odours between cooks.

<p>When converting 0.75 tbsp baking soda to grams, remember it’s about 15 grams per full tablespoon. This ratio works for most UK-brand baking sodas, but check your packaging for density variations. Always level off your spoon for accuracy.</p>

<h3>Storing baking soda for optimal air fryer results</h3>  
<p>Keep baking soda in an airtight container to maintain potency. Humidity can cause clumping, affecting your 0.75 tbsp measurements. For deep-cleaning your appliance afterwards, try our recommended <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner</a> solutions.</p>

<h2>Troubleshooting baking soda measurements</h2>

<p>Remember that 0.75 tbsp baking soda to grams conversions may vary slightly by brand. When scaling recipes up or down, always recalculate rather than eyeballing proportions. This ensures your air fryer creations turn out perfectly every time.</p>

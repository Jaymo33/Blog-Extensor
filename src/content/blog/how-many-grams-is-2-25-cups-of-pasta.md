<p>2.25 cups of pasta equals approximately 225 grams, though this can vary slightly depending on the pasta shape and density. Getting this measurement right is key for perfectly portioned air fryer meals, whether you're whipping up a quick lunch or meal prepping for the week. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we know precision matters, so let’s dive into the details.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Pasta Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Using the correct amount of pasta ensures even cooking and avoids overcrowding in your air fryer basket. Overfilling can lead to unevenly cooked or clumpy pasta, while underfilling might leave you hungry. Whether you're making crispy pasta bakes or reheating leftovers, 225 grams (or 2.25 cups) is a handy benchmark for single servings or small batches.</p>  

<p>Different pasta shapes can affect weight slightly—for example, penne and fusilli may pack differently into a cup. If you’re following a recipe from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>our collection</a>, sticking to grams removes guesswork. A kitchen scale is your best friend here, but if you don’t have one, fluffing the pasta lightly before measuring helps standardise cup-to-gram conversions.</p>  

<h3>Common Pasta Types and Their Weights</h3>  
<p>While 2.25 cups of dry pasta generally translates to 225 grams, here’s a quick reference for popular varieties: spaghetti weighs roughly 100 grams per cup, while denser shapes like rigatoni or macaroni may clock in closer to 120 grams per cup. For air fryer recipes, such as our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken pasta bakes</a>, weighing ensures consistency.</p>  

<h2>Converting Cups to Grams for Air Fryer Success</h2>  
<p>Air fryers excel at crispy, even results, but portion control is crucial. If you’re adapting a stovetop recipe, converting 2.25 cups of pasta to grams (225g) guarantees the right texture. Too much pasta can block airflow, leading to soggy outcomes. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a> for other common ingredients.</p>  

<p>For dishes like air-fried mac and cheese or pesto pasta, precision ensures the sauce coats evenly. If you’re cooking for a crowd, simply scale up—4.5 cups would be 450 grams, and so on. Remember, cooked pasta doubles in volume, so 225 grams of dry pasta yields about 4.5 cups cooked, perfect for two servings.</p>  

<h3>Tips for Measuring Without a Scale</h3>  
<p>No scale? Use the “finger test” for long pasta: a bundle of spaghetti roughly the diameter of a 10p coin weighs about 100 grams. For smaller shapes, fill a cup loosely without packing it down. And if you’re reheating leftovers, <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>keeping your air fryer clean</a> prevents flavour transfer and ensures accurate cooking times.</p>  

<h2>FAQs About Pasta Measurements</h2>

<h2>Why accurate garlic measurements matter</h2>  
<p>Garlic is a powerhouse ingredient that can elevate any dish, but too much or too little can throw off the balance. In an air fryer, where flavours intensify due to rapid cooking, precise amounts are crucial. For example, 30g of chopped garlic (1.06 oz) is perfect for a batch of garlic bread or roasted vegetables. If you're unsure, always measure rather than eyeball itâ€”especially when trying new recipes from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>our collection</a>.</p>  

<p>Chopped garlic also varies in density depending on how finely it's minced. A coarse chop may take up more space but weigh the same as finely minced garlic. This is why weight (grams or ounces) is more reliable than volume (teaspoons or tablespoons). For air fryer cooking, consistency ensures even flavour distribution and prevents overpowering your dish.</p>  

<h3>Converting grams to ounces for air fryer recipes</h3>  
<p>Converting 30g of chopped garlic to ounces is straightforward: 1 gram equals roughly 0.035 ounces, so 30g x 0.035 = 1.06 oz. This conversion applies to most ingredients, making it a handy rule for air fryer cooking. If you're scaling up a recipe, simply multiply the grams by 0.035 to get the equivalent in ounces. For example, 60g of chopped garlic would be 2.12 oz.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for 30g of chopped garlic</h2>  
<p>30g (1.06 oz) of chopped garlic is a versatile amount for many air fryer dishes. It's enough to season a whole chicken, infuse oil for roasted potatoes, or add depth to a vegetable stir-fry.

<p>2.5 tablespoons (tbsp) of chopped onion equals approximately 20 grams. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precision matters. Whether you’re making crispy onion toppings or flavourful bases, knowing the exact weight ensures consistency. For more air fryer measurement guides, visit <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>our conversion chart</a>.</p>

<h2>Why accurate onion measurements matter in air frying</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of chopped onion can make or break your air fryer dish. Too little, and you’ll miss out on flavour; too much, and it may release excess moisture. Air fryers rely on even cooking, so precise measurements like 2.5 tbsp chopped onion to grams help achieve perfect results. Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a> for dishes where onions shine.</p>  

<p>Onions vary in density depending on how finely they’re chopped. That’s why weight (grams) is more reliable than volume (tablespoons) for consistency. For 2.5 tbsp of moderately chopped onion, 20 grams is the sweet spot. This measurement works well for everything from fajitas to onion rings in your air fryer.</p>  

<h3>How to measure 2.5 tbsp chopped onion correctly</h3>  
<p>For accurate results, lightly pack the chopped onion into a tablespoon without compressing it. Level off the top with a knife for a precise 2.5 tbsp measurement. If you’re converting 2.5 tbsp of chopped onion into grams regularly, consider keeping a kitchen scale handy. It’s a game-changer for air fryer cooking where ratios matter.</p>  

<h2>Common air fryer recipes using 2.5 tbsp chopped onion</h2>  
<p>Many air fryer dishes call for around 2.5 tbsp (20g) of chopped onion. This amount perfectly seasons two servings of air-fried chicken fajitas or adds depth to vegetable stir-fries. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable recipe category</a> for inspiration. The right onion quantity ensures flavours meld beautifully without overpowering.</p>  

<p>For onion-heavy dishes like blooming onions or onion bhajis, you’ll need larger quantities. But 2.5 tbsp chopped onion in grams (20g) is ideal for most everyday recipes. It’s enough to impart flavour without making cleanup difficult. Speaking of cleanup, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning guide</a> helps maintain your appliance after onion-heavy use.</p>  

<h3>Converting other onion measurements to grams</h3>  
<p>While we’ve focused on 2.5 tbsp chopped onion to grams, you might need other conversions. One medium onion (chopped) typically yields about 8 tablespoons or 120 grams. For smaller amounts, 1 tbsp equals roughly 8 grams. Bookmark our conversion resources for quick reference during meal prep.</p>  

<h2>Tips for working with onions in air fryers</h2>  
<p>Onions can sometimes stick to air fryer baskets due to their natural sugars. To prevent this, lightly coat your 2.5 tbsp (20g) of chopped onion with oil before cooking. This ensures even crisping and easy release. The moisture in onions also affects cooking times, so adjust accordingly based on your recipe.</p>  

<p>For caramelised onions in the air fryer, you might start with more than 2.5 tbsp as they reduce significantly. The concentrated sweetness adds incredible depth to burgers or steaks. Remember that onion sizes vary, so when a recipe calls for 2.5 tbsp chopped onion in grams, weighing ensures accuracy regardless of onion size.</p>

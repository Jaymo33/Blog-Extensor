<p>25 grams of onion equals approximately 0.88 ounces. This conversion is handy when following air fryer recipes that use metric or imperial measurements. Whether you're prepping ingredients for a stir-fry or a crispy onion topping, knowing this conversion ensures accuracy. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we make it easy to switch between units for seamless cooking.</p>

<h2>Why accurate onion measurements matter</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of onion can make or break a dish. Too little, and you might miss out on flavour; too much, and it can overpower other ingredients. In air fryer cooking, precise measurements help achieve even cooking and perfect texture. For example, 25g of onion (0.88 oz) is ideal for small batches or as a garnish. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more handy tips.</p>  

<p>Onions add depth to dishes like air-fried fajitas, burgers, or roasted vegetables. Whether you're using red, white, or brown onions, 25g is roughly a small handful when chopped. For recipes requiring larger quantities, simply scale up the conversion. Visit our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetables category</a> for inspiration on using onions in your air fryer.</p>  

<h3>How to measure 25g of onion without a scale</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a kitchen scale, you can estimate 25g of onion by volume. One medium onion weighs about 150g, so 25g is roughly one-sixth of a medium onion. Chopped, this fills around two tablespoons. For finely diced onion, it’s closer to three tablespoons. Keep in mind that onion density varies slightly depending on how it’s cut.</p>  

<h2>Converting 25g onion to ounces for air fryer recipes</h2>  
<p>Many UK air fryer recipes use grams, while others prefer ounces. Converting 25g of onion to ounces (0.88 oz) ensures you’re using the right amount for consistent results. This is especially useful for recipes like air-fried onion rings or caramelised onion toppings. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipes section</a> features dishes where precise onion measurements matter.</p>  

<p>For larger batches, remember that 100g of onion equals roughly 3.5 ounces. This makes scaling recipes up or down straightforward. If you’re prepping meal components in advance, accurate conversions save time and reduce waste. Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/meal-prep>meal prep category</a> for make-ahead ideas featuring onions.</p>  

<h3>Common air fryer recipes using 25g of onion</h3>  
<p>Small quantities of onion, like 25g (0.88 oz), work well in air fryer omelettes, stuffed mushrooms, or as a garnish for soups. They’re also perfect for testing new recipes without committing to larger portions. When air-frying, onions cook quickly, so keep an eye on them to prevent burning.

<p>50g of lime juice equals approximately 1.76 ounces. This conversion is handy when following air fryer recipes that list ingredients in grams but require ounces for precise measuring. Whether you’re marinating chicken, preparing a citrusy glaze, or adding a tangy twist to vegetables, knowing this conversion ensures your dish turns out perfectly every time.</p>

<h2>Why convert 50g of lime juice to ounces?</h2>  
<p>Many UK air fryer recipes use metric measurements, but some kitchen scales or measuring cups display ounces. Converting 50g of lime juice to ounces (1.76 oz) helps avoid guesswork, especially when precision matters—like in marinades or dressings. A slight miscalculation could throw off the balance of flavours, so it’s worth getting it right.</p>  
<p>At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we recommend using a digital scale for accuracy. If you don’t have one, remember that 1 fluid ounce of lime juice roughly weighs 28.35g, making 50g just under 2 ounces.

<h2>How to measure 50g of lime juice without a scale</h2>  
<p>No scale? No problem. One medium lime yields about 30–50ml (or 30–50g) of juice, depending on its size and juiciness. So, 50g of lime juice is roughly the juice of one large lime or one and a half smaller limes. Squeeze freshly for the best flavour, especially in air fryer recipes like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>citrus-marinated chicken</a>.</p>  
<p>Alternatively, use a measuring spoon: 50g of lime juice is close to 3.5 tablespoons (since 1 tbsp ≈ 15ml). For sticky recipes like glazes, warm the lime juice slightly to make pouring easier. Avoid bottled juice if possible—fresh lime juice enhances dishes like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air-fryer shrimp tacos</a> with brighter acidity.</p>

<h3>Does lime juice weight vary by type?</h3>  
<p>Freshly squeezed lime juice and bottled varieties have similar densities, so 50g of either will equal roughly 1.76 ounces. However, bottled juice often contains preservatives or additives that may slightly alter the weight. For the purest flavour and accurate measurements, fresh is best—especially in delicate air fryer recipes.</p>

<h2>Common uses for 50g of lime juice in air frying</h2>  
<p>Fifty grams of lime juice (1.76 oz) is a versatile quantity. It’s enough to marinate 500g of chicken, whip up a tangy dipping sauce, or drizzle over <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>air-fried vegetables</a>. Try it in a marinade with garlic, honey, and chilli for a zesty kick, or mix with olive oil for a light dressing.</p>  
<p>Lime juice also helps tenderise proteins and prevents oxidation in veggies. After cooking, a quick spritz freshens up dishes like air-fryer fish tacos. For cleaning your air fryer, lime juice mixed with water can help dissolve grease—just follow our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning guide</a>.</p>

<h3>Storing leftover lime juice</h3>  
<p>If your recipe calls for 50g but you’ve squeezed extra, store it in an airtight container in the fridge for up to a week. Freeze it in ice cube trays (each cube holds about 15g) for future use in marinades or sauces. Just thaw and measure—no waste!</p>

<p>335 ml of olive oil is approximately 1.42 cups. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes, where precise measurements can make or break a dish. Whether you’re whipping up crispy roasted vegetables or a succulent chicken dish, knowing how to convert millilitres to cups ensures perfect results every time. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we’re all about making cooking easier, so let’s dive into the details.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of olive oil in your air fryer can mean the difference between crispy, golden perfection and soggy disappointment. Too much oil can lead to greasy results, while too little might leave your food dry. For example, when making air-fried potatoes, 335 ml of olive oil (1.42 cups) is often enough to coat a large batch evenly. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more handy measurement tips.</p>  

<p>Olive oil is a staple in many air fryer recipes, from Mediterranean-style dishes to simple roasted veggies. If you’re prepping a recipe like our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>air-fryer roasted vegetables</a>, knowing that 335 ml equals roughly 1.42 cups helps streamline your cooking process. No more guessing or last-minute conversions—just perfect results every time.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure 335 ml of Olive Oil Without a Measuring Cup</h3>  
<p>Don’t have a measuring cup? No problem! You can use a standard metric measuring jug or even a kitchen scale. Since 1 ml of olive oil weighs about 0.92 grams, 335 ml would be roughly 308 grams. Alternatively, a tablespoon holds about 15 ml, so 335 ml is around 22 tablespoons. Just remember, precision matters, especially when baking.</p>  

<h2>Converting 335 ml of Olive Oil for Different Recipes</h2>  
<p>Whether you’re making a marinade, dressing, or frying, 335 ml of olive oil (1.42 cups) is a versatile measurement. For instance, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>air-fryer chicken recipes</a> often call for this amount to ensure juicy, flavourful results. If you’re scaling a recipe up or down, remember that 335 ml is just over 1 and 1/3 cups, making adjustments easier.</p>  

<p>For baking enthusiasts, 335 ml of olive oil can replace butter in many recipes, adding a rich, fruity depth. If you’re trying our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air-fryer cake recipes</a>, this conversion ensures your batter has the perfect consistency. Keep our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner guide</a> handy too—olive oil can sometimes leave residue!</p>  

<h3>US vs UK Cup Measurements</h3>  
<p>It’s worth noting that US and UK cup measurements differ slightly. A US cup is 240 ml, while a UK cup is 250 ml. For 335 ml of olive oil, this means roughly 1.4 US cups or 1.34 UK cups. Always check your recipe’s origin to avoid discrepancies, especially when following international guides.</p>

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Precision is key when using an air fryer, as ingredients cook faster and more evenly with the right quantities. Margarine, often used in baking or as a cooking fat, needs exact measurements to avoid greasy or dry results. Too much margarine can lead to excess oil pooling, while too little may cause sticking or uneven browning. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> simplifies these calculations for you. With 500g of margarine converted to 17.64 ounces, you can confidently follow any recipe.</p>  

<p>Many UK recipes use grams, but if your kitchen scale measures in ounces, this conversion is essential. Air fryers work best with precise ingredient ratios, especially for cakes, cookies, or crispy coatings. Whether you're making <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>air fryer cakes</a> or roasting vegetables, knowing 500g margarine to ounces ensures perfect texture and flavour. No more second-guessing—just reliable measurements for delicious meals.</p>  

<h3>How to measure margarine without a scale</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a kitchen scale, you can still measure 500g of margarine using volume equivalents. One tablespoon of margarine weighs roughly 14g, so 500g would be about 35 tablespoons. However, weighing is more accurate, especially for air fryer recipes where consistency matters. For best results, invest in a digital scale or refer to our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a> for pre-converted measurements.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for margarine in air fryer recipes</h2>

For example, 500g of margarine in ounces (17.64 oz) might be used for a large batch of <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cookies>air fryer cookies</a>. It’s also great for brushing on vegetables or meats before air frying to enhance crispiness.</p>

<h3>Does margarine type affect the weight?</h3>  
<p>Most margarines have a similar density, so 500g will generally equal 17.64 ounces regardless of brand. However, whipped or light margarines may vary slightly due to added air. Always check the packaging for exact weight if precision is crucial. For consistent results in air fryer cooking, stick to standard block margarine when possible.</p>

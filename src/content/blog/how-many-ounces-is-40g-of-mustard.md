<h2>Why converting 40g of mustard to ounces matters</h2>  
<p>Accurate measurements are crucial in cooking, especially when using an air fryer. A slight variation in ingredients like mustard can affect texture and flavour. Converting 40g of mustard to ounces (1.41 oz) ensures consistency, whether you’re following a recipe or experimenting. Many UK recipes use grams, but if your kitchen scales default to ounces, this conversion is a lifesaver. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more handy tips.</p>  

<p>Mustard adds tang and depth to dishes, from glazes for <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>air fryer chicken</a> to marinades for vegetables.

Precision is key, whether you’re cooking for one or meal prepping for the week.</p>  

<h3>How to measure 40g of mustard without scales</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have kitchen scales, you can still measure 40g of mustard (1.41 oz) using tablespoons. One tablespoon of mustard weighs roughly 15g, so 40g is just under 3 tablespoons.

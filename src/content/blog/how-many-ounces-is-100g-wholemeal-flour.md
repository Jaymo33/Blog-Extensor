<p>100g of wholemeal flour equals approximately 3.53 ounces. This conversion is essential for bakers using recipes with imperial measurements or adjusting quantities for air fryer cooking. Whether you're making bread, cakes, or coatings for air-fried dishes, getting the flour measurement right ensures consistent results every time.</p>

<h2>Understanding flour measurements</h2>
<p>When converting 100g of wholemeal flour to ounces, it's important to note that flour density can vary slightly. However, the standard conversion of 100g to 3.53 ounces works perfectly for most baking purposes. Many UK recipes, especially those for air fryers, provide measurements in grams, but some older cookbooks or American recipes might use ounces.</p>
<p>At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we recommend using digital scales for the most accurate measurements. This is particularly crucial when working with wholemeal flour, which has a different density to plain flour. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> includes all the common baking measurements you'll need for perfect results.</p>

<h2>Why accurate flour measurements matter</h2>
<p>In baking, especially for air fryer recipes, precision is key. Too much flour can make your baked goods dense and dry, while too little can result in a crumbly texture. When converting 100g wholemeal flour to ounces, that 3.53 ounce measurement becomes the foundation for successful recipes.</p>
<p>Wholemeal flour behaves differently to white flour in recipes, absorbing more liquid and producing a denser texture. That's why getting the 100g to ounce conversion right is so important. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>cake recipes</a> section for ideas on how to use your perfectly measured wholemeal flour.</p>

<h3>Converting other flour quantities</h3>
<p>Once you've mastered the 100g wholemeal flour to ounces conversion, you can easily scale recipes up or down. For example, 50g would be 1.76 ounces, while 200g converts to 7.05 ounces. These conversions work for all types of flour, though weights may vary slightly between brands.</p>

<h2>Tips for measuring wholemeal flour</h2>
<p>When measuring 100g of wholemeal flour (3.53 ounces), the spoon-and-level method works best. Gently spoon the flour into your measuring cup or onto scales without packing it down. This prevents over-measuring, which is easy to do with denser wholemeal flour.</p>
<p>For air fryer baking, we recommend weighing ingredients rather than using volume measurements. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a> includes weights for all ingredients to take the guesswork out of your cooking. Remember that 100g wholemeal flour to ounces is just one of many useful conversions for air fryer enthusiasts.</p>

<h3>Common uses for 100g wholemeal flour</h3>
<p>100g of wholemeal flour (3.53 ounces) is perfect for small batches of air fryer baked goods. You might use this quantity for coating chicken before air frying, making individual muffins, or creating a small loaf of bread. The nutty flavour of wholemeal flour adds depth to many <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/breakfast>breakfast recipes</a>.</p>

<h2>Storing wholemeal flour properly</h2>
<p>Once you've measured out your 100g of wholemeal flour (3.53 ounces), proper storage is key to maintaining freshness. Wholemeal flour has a shorter shelf life than white flour due to its higher oil content. Store it in an airtight container in a cool, dark place, or consider refrigeration for longer storage.</p>

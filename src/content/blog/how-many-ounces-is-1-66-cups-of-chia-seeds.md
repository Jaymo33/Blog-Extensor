<p>1.66 cups of chia seeds equals approximately 8.8 ounces. This conversion is essential for anyone using chia seeds in air fryer recipes or meal prep. Whether you're making chia puddings, energy bars, or adding them to baked goods, accurate measurements ensure perfect results every time.</p>

<h2>Why accurate chia seed measurements matter</h2>  
<p>Chia seeds are packed with nutrients, and their unique texture can make or break a recipe. Too many chia seeds can make dishes overly thick, while too few might not provide the desired consistency. This is especially important in air fryer recipes, where precise measurements ensure even cooking. For more air fryer tips, check out <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>our conversion chart</a>.</p>  

<p>Many UK cooks prefer weighing ingredients like chia seeds for accuracy. Cups can vary slightly in size, but ounces provide a consistent measurement. If you're new to using chia seeds in your air fryer, our guide to <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> has plenty of inspiration.</p>  

<h2>How to measure 1.66 cups of chia seeds</h2>  
<p>Measuring 1.66 cups of chia seeds is simple with the right tools. Use a standard UK measuring cup for dry ingredients, filling it just below the rim. For the 0.66 portion, you can eyeball two-thirds of a cup or use a kitchen scale for precision. A digital scale set to ounces will give you the most accurate result.</p>  

<p>If you don’t have a scale, remember that 1 cup of chia seeds weighs roughly 5.3 ounces. This means 1.66 cups would be about 8.8 ounces.

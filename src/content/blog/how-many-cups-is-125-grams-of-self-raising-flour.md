<p>125 grams of self-raising flour equals approximately 1 cup in UK measurements or 0.9 cups in US measurements. Getting this conversion right is essential for baking success, especially when using an air fryer for cakes, muffins, or other flour-based recipes. Whether you're following a recipe from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> or adjusting measurements on the fly, knowing how to convert grams to cups ensures consistency.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Flour Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Baking is a science, and even small measurement discrepancies can affect texture and rise. Self-raising flour contains baking powder, so using too much or too little can lead to dense or overly airy results. For air fryer recipes, precise measurements are even more critical due to the compact cooking space. If you're preparing a cake or bread in your air fryer, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipes section</a> for foolproof ideas.</p>  

<p>Using a kitchen scale is the most accurate method, but if you only have measuring cups, knowing the gram-to-cup conversion is vital. A slight variation in how you scoop flour—whether spooned or scooped—can change the measurement. For best results, fluff the flour before lightly spooning it into the cup and leveling it off with a knife.</p>  

<h3>UK vs. US Cup Measurements</h3>  
<p>In the UK, 1 cup of self-raising flour is typically 125 grams, while in the US, 1 cup is around 140 grams. This means 125 grams of self-raising flour equals 1 UK cup or roughly 0.9 US cups. Always check whether your recipe uses UK or US measurements to avoid mishaps. If you're unsure, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> can help clarify.</p>  

<h2>How to Measure Self-Raising Flour Without a Scale</h2>  
<p>If you don’t have a digital scale, use the spoon-and-level method for accuracy. Gently fluff the flour in its bag or container, then spoon it into your measuring cup without packing it down. Level off the excess with a straight edge. Avoid scooping directly with the cup, as this compacts the flour and leads to over-measuring. For air fryer baking, even small errors can affect cooking times and textures.</p>  

<p>Another handy trick is to memorise common conversions. For example, 125 grams of self-raising flour is roughly one UK cup, making it easy to adjust recipes on the fly. If you're scaling up a recipe, check our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>cake category</a> for inspiration on perfect air fryer bakes.</p>  

<h3>Common Baking Mistakes with Self-Raising Flour</h3>  
<p>Using expired self-raising flour is a common mistake—the baking powder loses potency over time, leading to flat bakes. Always check the expiry date before use. Another error is substituting plain flour without adding baking powder, which won’t give the same rise. If you're adapting a recipe, ensure you account for the missing leavening agent.</p>  

<h2>Air Fryer Baking Tips for Perfect Results</h2>  
<p>Air fryers circulate hot air, which can dry out baked goods if not monitored. To prevent this, lightly cover cakes or muffins with foil halfway through cooking. Also, reduce the temperature slightly compared to conventional oven recipes—air fryers cook faster. For more tips, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning and maintenance guide</a> to keep your appliance in top shape.</p>  

<p>Preheating your air fryer ensures even cooking, just like a traditional oven. Most air fryer recipes, especially those using self-raising flour, benefit from a few minutes of preheating. If you're experimenting with new recipes, start with smaller batches to test cooking times and adjustments.</p>  

<h3>Storing Self-Raising Flour for Freshness</h3>  
<p>Keep self-raising flour in an airtight container in a cool, dry place to maintain its rising power. Humidity can cause clumping and reduce effectiveness. If you bake infrequently, consider storing it in the freezer for longer shelf life—just bring it to room temperature before use.</p>

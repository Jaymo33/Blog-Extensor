<p>0.66 cup of passata equals approximately 5.28 ounces. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements can make or break a dish. Whether you’re whipping up a quick pasta sauce or a rich tomato-based stew, knowing how many ounces are in 0.66 cup of passata ensures consistency and flavour balance.</p>  

<h2>Understanding Passata Measurements</h2>  
<p>Passata, a smooth Italian tomato purée, is a staple in many air fryer recipes. Unlike chopped tomatoes, passata has a thicker consistency, which means its weight can vary slightly from other tomato products. When converting 0.66 cup of passata to ounces, it’s important to note that 1 cup of passata typically weighs around 8 ounces. Therefore, 0.66 cup of passata translates to roughly 5.28 ounces.</p>  

<p>For those using metric measurements, 5.28 ounces is equivalent to about 150 grams. This conversion is particularly useful when following recipes from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, where precision is key. Whether you’re making a classic marinara or a hearty bolognese, knowing the exact weight of your passata ensures your dish turns out perfectly every time.</p>  

<h3>Why Accurate Measurements Matter</h3>  
<p>Air fryer cooking relies heavily on precise ingredient ratios to achieve the best results. Too much passata can make a dish overly watery, while too little can leave it dry and lacking in flavour.

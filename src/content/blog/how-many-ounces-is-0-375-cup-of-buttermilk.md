<h2>Why accurate buttermilk measurements matter</h2>  
<p>Buttermilk is a staple in many air fryer recipes, from tenderising meats to adding moisture to baked goods. Using 0.375 cup (3 ounces) ensures your batter isn’t too thick or thin. Too much buttermilk can make coatings soggy, while too little may dry out your dish. For perfect results every time, measure carefully. Explore more tips on our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipes page</a>.</p>  

<p>Air fryers rely on even cooking, and precise ingredient ratios help achieve this. Buttermilk’s acidity also affects browning and texture, so accuracy is key. Whether you’re making buttermilk chicken or fluffy scones, 3 ounces of buttermilk per 0.375 cup guarantees success. Need recipe ideas? Try our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipes</a> for inspiration.</p>  

<h3>How to measure buttermilk without a scale</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a kitchen scale, use liquid measuring cups for 0.375 cup (3 ounces) of buttermilk. Fill the cup to the 3/8 mark or eyeball halfway between 1/4 and 1/2 cup. For sticky ingredients like buttermilk, spray the cup with oil first for easy pouring. Always level off the top with a straight edge for accuracy.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for 0.375 cup buttermilk in air fryers</h2>  
<p>This measurement is perfect for marinades, batters, and dips. For example, 0.375 cup (3 ounces) of buttermilk tenderises chicken wings before air frying. It’s also ideal for coating fish fillets or creating light, crispy tempura. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/frozen-foods>frozen foods section</a> for quick buttermilk-based meals.</p>  

<p>Buttermilk’s tangy flavour enhances everything from fried pickles to onion rings. When using 0.375 cup, pair it with spices for a flavourful brine. The acidity helps break down proteins, resulting in juicier meats.

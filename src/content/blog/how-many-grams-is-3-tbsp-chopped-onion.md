<p>3 tablespoons (tbsp) of chopped onion weighs approximately 30 grams. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precision ensures even cooking and perfect texture. Whether you're prepping a stir-fry, casserole, or seasoning mix, knowing the exact weight helps avoid over or under-seasoning. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we focus on accurate measurements to elevate your cooking game. Use this guide to convert 3 tbsp chopped onion to grams effortlessly.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate onion measurements matter</h2>  
<p>Chopped onion is a staple in many dishes, from air-fried fajitas to hearty stews. Using the right amount ensures balanced flavour without overpowering other ingredients. Too little, and your dish may lack depth; too much, and it can become bitter. For air fryer recipes, uniform sizing also promotes even crisping. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more handy measurement swaps. Whether you're cooking for one or meal prepping, precision saves time and reduces waste.</p>  

<h3>How to measure chopped onion correctly</h3>  
<p>For consistent results, lightly pack the onion into the tablespoon without crushing it. Level off the top with a knife for an exact 3 tbsp portion. If using a kitchen scale, tare the bowl first, then add the onion until it hits 30 grams. This method works for both fresh and pre-chopped onions. For recipe inspiration, browse our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable category</a> featuring onion-heavy dishes like crispy onion bhajis.</p>  

<h2>Common recipes using 3 tbsp chopped onion</h2>  
<p>Many air fryer favourites call for this quantity, such as stuffed peppers, savoury muffins, or quick pickled onions. It’s also ideal for seasoning minced meat or tofu before air frying. Visit <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>our recipe hub</a> for ideas like onion-infused burgers or caramelised onion tarts. Remember, 3 tbsp chopped onion to grams (30g) ensures your dish won’t be overwhelmed. Adjust slightly for milder varieties like shallots or stronger ones like red onions.</p>  

<h3>Scaling up or down</h3>  
<p>Need more or less? Here’s a quick reference: 1 tbsp ≈ 10g, 2 tbsp ≈ 20g, and 4 tbsp ≈ 40g. These ratios help when adapting recipes for smaller or larger batches. For frozen chopped onion, thaw and drain excess liquid before measuring. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning guide</a> also covers post-onion prep tips to keep your appliance odour-free.</p>  

<h2>Pro tips for air frying with onions</h2>  
<p>Onions can burn quickly in air fryers due to their sugar content. Toss them in a bit of oil and cook at 160°C for 5-8 minutes, shaking halfway. For caramelised results, add a pinch of sugar. Pair them with other <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/potatoes>potato-based recipes</a> for classic combos like roast potatoes with onions. Always measure after chopping—not before—as sizes vary widely.</p>

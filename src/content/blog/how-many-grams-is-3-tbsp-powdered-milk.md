<p>3 tablespoons of powdered milk equals approximately 21 grams. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precision matters, whether you're baking, making sauces, or preparing meals. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we know accurate measurements can make or break a dish, especially when using powdered milk in air fryer-friendly recipes like cakes or creamy sauces.</p>

<h2>Why converting 3 tbsp powdered milk to grams matters</h2>  
<p>Powdered milk is a versatile ingredient, often used in air fryer recipes for its long shelf life and convenience. Measuring it correctly ensures consistency in texture and flavour. Whether you're whipping up a batch of air fryer cookies or a creamy pasta sauce, knowing that 3 tbsp of powdered milk is roughly 21 grams helps avoid guesswork. For more conversion tips, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>  

<p>Using a kitchen scale for powdered milk is ideal, but if you don’t have one, spoon-and-level methods work too. Just remember that 1 tablespoon holds about 7 grams of powdered milk, so 3 tbsp neatly translates to 21 grams. This accuracy is particularly useful for <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert recipes</a> where ratios matter.</p>  

<h3>How to measure powdered milk without a scale</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a scale, use a dry measuring spoon and level it off with a knife for precision. Scooping directly from the bag can lead to uneven amounts, affecting your recipe. For air fryer baking, like our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>popular cake recipes</a>, even small measurement errors can alter the outcome.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for powdered milk in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Powdered milk isn’t just for beverages—it’s a secret weapon in air fryer cooking. From binding ingredients in meatballs to adding richness to bread coatings, its applications are endless. If you’re making <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>air fryer chicken</a>, a light dusting of powdered milk can enhance crispiness.</p>  

<p>It’s also great for rehydrating in sauces or soups cooked in the air fryer. Since 3 tbsp of powdered milk equals 21 grams, you can easily adjust quantities for larger batches. Just remember to store it properly to maintain freshness—keep it sealed in a cool, dry place.</p>  

<h3>Adjusting recipes for different powdered milk brands</h3>  
<p>Not all powdered milk brands have the same density, so slight variations in weight may occur. If a recipe calls for 3 tbsp (21g) but your brand feels heavier, use a scale for certainty. For troubleshooting air fryer mishaps, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning guide</a> can help with post-cooking maintenance.</p>

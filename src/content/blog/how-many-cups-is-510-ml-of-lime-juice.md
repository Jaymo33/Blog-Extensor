<p>510 ml of lime juice equals approximately 2.15 cups in standard US measurements. Whether you're preparing a zesty marinade or a tangy dessert, knowing this conversion ensures your air fryer recipes turn out perfectly. Lime juice is a versatile ingredient, often used in dishes like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>air fryer chicken</a> or <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>citrus-infused desserts</a>, so getting the measurement right is key.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Lime Juice Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Precision is crucial when working with lime juice, especially in air fryer recipes where balance is everything. Too much lime juice can overpower a dish, while too little might leave it bland. For example, if you're making a <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>lime-glazed salmon</a>, 510 ml of lime juice (or 2.15 cups) ensures the right acidity and flavour. Air fryers cook quickly, so every ingredient must be measured correctly to avoid mishaps.</p>  
<p>Additionally, lime juice plays a role in tenderising meats and balancing sweetness in desserts. If you're using it for <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversions</a>, knowing how 510 ml translates to cups helps streamline your cooking process. Whether you're following a recipe or experimenting, this measurement ensures consistency.</p>  

<h3>US vs UK Cup Measurements</h3>  
<p>It's worth noting that US and UK cup measurements differ slightly. In the UK, 1 cup is 284 ml, whereas in the US, it's 240 ml. For 510 ml of lime juice, this means roughly 2.15 US cups or 1.8 UK cups. Always check which system your recipe uses to avoid confusion. Most air fryer recipes, including those on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, follow US measurements unless stated otherwise.</p>  

<h2>How to Measure Lime Juice Without a Measuring Cup</h2>  
<p>If you don’t have a measuring cup handy, you can still measure 510 ml of lime juice accurately. A standard lime yields about 30 ml of juice, so you’d need roughly 17 limes to reach 510 ml. Alternatively, use a kitchen scale—510 ml of lime juice weighs approximately 510 grams, as its density is close to water. This method is handy for air fryer recipes where precision matters.</p>  
<p>Another trick is to repurpose a clean, empty water bottle with millilitre markings. Simply squeeze the lime juice directly into the bottle until you hit the 510 ml mark. This is especially useful for larger batches, like when preparing marinades for <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>air-fried vegetables</a> or proteins.</p>  

<h3>Using Lime Juice in Air Fryer Recipes</h3>  
<p>Lime juice adds brightness to air fryer dishes, from crispy chicken wings to citrusy desserts. When converting 510 ml to cups (2.15 cups), you can adjust recipes effortlessly. For example, a lime-infused glaze or dressing will benefit from this exact measurement. Always store leftover lime juice in an airtight container in the fridge to maintain freshness for future <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cooking sessions</a>.</p>

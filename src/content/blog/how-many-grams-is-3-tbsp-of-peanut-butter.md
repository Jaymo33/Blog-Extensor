<h2>Why accurate peanut butter measurements matter</h2>  
<p>Using the correct amount of peanut butter ensures your air fryer dishes turn out just right. Too much can make recipes overly dense, while too little might leave them dry.

<h2>How to measure peanut butter without scales</h2>  
<p>Don’t have a kitchen scale? No problem. You can still measure 3 tbsp of peanut butter accurately using simple household tools. A standard UK tablespoon holds about 16 grams of peanut butter, so three level tablespoons will give you roughly 48 grams. Avoid heaping spoonfuls unless the recipe specifies otherwise. For sticky ingredients like peanut butter, lightly greasing the spoon helps it slide off cleanly.</p>  

<h3>Using measuring spoons vs. weight</h3>  
<p>While measuring spoons are convenient, weighing ingredients is often more precise. This is especially true for air fryer recipes, where even small deviations can affect cooking times. If you’re serious about perfect results, investing in a digital scale is worthwhile. Many budget-friendly options are available, and they’re indispensable for baking.

The rich, nutty flavour enhances both sweet and savoury dishes. Remember, 3 tbsp (48g) strikes the right balance without overpowering other ingredients.</p>

<p>2.5 cups of sugar syrup equals approximately 20 ounces. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precision ensures perfect results. Whether you’re making glazes, desserts, or marinades, knowing the exact weight helps avoid mishaps. For more air fryer tips, visit <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on even cooking, and incorrect measurements can throw off textures and flavours. Sugar syrup, for instance, affects caramelisation and moisture levels. Too much or too little can ruin a dish, especially in baked goods or glazes. That’s why converting 2.5 cups of sugar syrup to ounces (20 oz) is so important. For more precise conversions, check our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>  

<p>Many air fryer recipes, like cakes or sticky wings, call for sugar syrup. Measuring by weight (ounces) is often more reliable than volume (cups). This avoids inconsistencies due to syrup density or settling. If you’re experimenting with recipes, always double-check conversions. Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a> for inspiration.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure Sugar Syrup Correctly</h3>  
<p>Use a liquid measuring cup for sugar syrup, filling it to the 2.5-cup mark at eye level. For ounces, a kitchen scale is ideal—simply pour until it hits 20 oz. If your recipe uses UK measurements, note that 1 UK cup is slightly larger, but 2.5 cups still roughly equate to 20 oz. Clean sticky residues promptly with <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner</a> to maintain accuracy.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for Sugar Syrup in Air Fryer Recipes</h2>  
<p>Sugar syrup is a staple in desserts like air-fried doughnuts or baklava. It’s also great for glazing meats or vegetables, adding a glossy finish. Since 2.5 cups of sugar syrup equals 20 ounces, you can adjust recipes without guesswork. For savoury dishes, try our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipes</a> with a sweet twist.</p>  

<p>In baking, sugar syrup keeps cakes moist and extends shelf life. For example, a 20-oz batch can soak a sponge cake evenly. Always distribute syrup carefully to prevent sogginess in the air fryer. Need ideas? Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert category</a> has plenty of syrupy treats.</p>  

<h3>Tips for Storing Leftover Sugar Syrup</h3>  
<p>After measuring 2.5 cups (20 oz), store extra syrup in an airtight container. Refrigeration prevents crystallisation, and it’ll last for weeks. Reheat gently before reusing in air fryer recipes to restore viscosity. Label containers with dates to track freshness.</p>

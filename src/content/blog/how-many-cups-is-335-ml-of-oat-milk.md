<p>335 ml of oat milk is approximately 1.42 cups (US) or 1.18 cups (UK). Whether you're whipping up a creamy dessert or a savoury dish in your air fryer, knowing this conversion ensures your recipes turn out just right. Oat milk is a popular dairy-free alternative, and getting the measurements spot-on can make all the difference in texture and flavour.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Using the correct amount of oat milk in your air fryer recipes ensures consistency. Too much liquid can make dishes soggy, while too little might leave them dry. For example, if you're making a batter for air-fried onion rings, 335 ml of oat milk (1.42 cups US) will give you the perfect consistency. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more handy measurement tips.</p>  

<p>Oat milk is also great for vegan baking in the air fryer. Whether you're making cakes or muffins, knowing that 335 ml equals roughly 1.42 cups helps you follow recipes precisely. Visit our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipes section</a> for inspiration on how to use oat milk in your air fryer creations.</p>  

<h3>US vs UK Cup Measurements</h3>  
<p>It's important to note that US and UK cup measurements differ slightly. In the US, 335 ml of oat milk equals 1.42 cups, while in the UK, it's about 1.18 cups. This distinction is crucial for air fryer recipes, especially if you're following an international cookbook or online guide.</p>  

<h2>How to Measure 335 ml of Oat Milk Without a Measuring Cup</h2>  
<p>If you don't have a measuring cup, you can still measure 335 ml of oat milk accurately. A standard metric measuring jug will show millilitres, making it easy to pour the exact amount. Alternatively, use a kitchen scaleâ€”oat milk weighs roughly 1 gram per millilitre, so 335 grams equals 335 ml.</p>  

<p>For those who prefer visual cues, 335 ml of oat milk fills just over half a standard UK pint glass (568 ml). This rough estimate can help in a pinch, but for best results in air fryer cooking, precise measurements are key. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert recipes</a> often call for oat milk, so accuracy matters.</p>  

<h3>Common Recipes Using 335 ml of Oat Milk</h3>  
<p>Many air fryer recipes call for 335 ml of oat milk, such as pancakes, custards, or creamy pasta sauces. For example, a vegan mac and cheese might require this amount to achieve the perfect creamy texture. Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/breakfast>breakfast recipes</a> for more ideas.</p>  

<h2>Converting Other Oat Milk Measurements</h2>  
<p>If your recipe calls for a different amount of oat milk, here are some quick conversions: 250 ml is about 1.06 cups (US), and 500 ml is roughly 2.11 cups (US). These conversions are handy when scaling recipes up or down for your air fryer.</p>

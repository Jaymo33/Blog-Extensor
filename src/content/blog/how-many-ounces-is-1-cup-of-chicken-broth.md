<p>1 cup of chicken broth equals approximately 8 ounces. This measurement is essential for air fryer recipes, ensuring your dishes turn out perfectly every time. Whether you're making soups, stews, or marinades, knowing this conversion helps you follow recipes accurately. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we provide detailed guides to make cooking effortless.</p>

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of chicken broth can make or break your dish. Too little, and your food might dry out in the air fryer. Too much, and it could become soggy. This is especially important for recipes like air fryer soups or casseroles, where liquid ratios are crucial. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more handy tips.</p>  

<p>Chicken broth adds depth of flavour to many dishes, from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipes</a> to vegetable sides. Measuring it correctly ensures consistency, whether you're batch cooking or trying a new recipe. Our guides at <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> take the guesswork out of cooking.</p>  

<h2>How to measure chicken broth correctly</h2>  
<p>For the most accurate results, use a liquid measuring cup designed for fluids like chicken broth. Place it on a flat surface and pour until the broth reaches the 1-cup mark. This method avoids spills and ensures you get exactly 8 ounces of broth for your air fryer recipes.</p>  

<h3>Using kitchen scales for precision</h3>  
<p>If you want absolute accuracy, weigh your chicken broth using digital kitchen scales. Set them to ounces, tare your container, then pour the broth until it reaches 8 ounces. This method is ideal for recipes where precision is key, like sauces or reductions.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for chicken broth in air fryers</h2>  
<p>Chicken broth works wonders in air fryer cooking. Use it to keep meats moist, create delicious gravies, or add flavour to roasted vegetables. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a> features countless ways to incorporate this versatile ingredient into your air fryer meals.</p>  

<p>From marinating chicken to deglazing your air fryer basket after cooking, chicken broth is a kitchen staple. Remember, 1 cup equals 8 ounces whether you're using it for <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable dishes</a> or protein mains. Keep this conversion handy for stress-free cooking sessions.</p>  

<h3>Storing leftover chicken broth</h3>  
<p>After measuring out your 1 cup (8 ounces) of chicken broth, store any leftovers properly. Refrigerate opened broth for up to 4 days, or freeze it in measured portions for future air fryer recipes. This ensures you always have the right amount on hand when inspiration strikes.</p>  

<h2>Converting other chicken broth measurements</h2>  
<p>Need different amounts? Half a cup of chicken broth equals 4 ounces, while 2 cups equal 16 ounces. These conversions work for all your air fryer needs, from small snacks to family-sized meals.

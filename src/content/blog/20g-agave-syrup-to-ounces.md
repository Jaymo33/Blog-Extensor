<p>20g of agave syrup is approximately 0.705 ounces. This conversion is handy for air fryer recipes where precise measurements matter. Whether you're drizzling it over desserts or using it in marinades, knowing the exact weight ensures perfect results every time.</p>  

<h2>Why Convert Grams to Ounces for Agave Syrup?</h2>  
<p>Many UK recipes, especially those for air fryers, use grams for accuracy. However, some kitchen scales or American recipes might list ounces instead. Converting 20g of agave syrup to ounces (0.705 oz) helps avoid guesswork. This is particularly useful for baking, where even small measurement errors can affect texture and taste.</p>  
<p>Agave syrup is thicker than honey but lighter than molasses, so volume measurements can be tricky. Weight-based conversions, like 20g to ounces, are far more reliable. For more air fryer-friendly sweeteners, check out <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>our recipe collection</a>.</p>  

<h2>How to Measure 20g of Agave Syrup Accurately</h2>  
<p>Using a digital kitchen scale is the easiest way to measure 20g of agave syrup. If your scale displays ounces, it should read roughly 0.705 oz. For those without scales, two level teaspoons (not heaped) will get you close to 20g, though weighing is always best.</p>  

<h3>Using Agave Syrup in Air Fryer Recipes</h3>  
<p>Agave syrup works wonderfully in air fryer glazes and marinades. Its mild sweetness complements dishes like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>air-fried chicken</a> or roasted vegetables. Since 20g equals 0.705 ounces, you can easily adjust recipes without compromising flavour.</p>  

<h2>Common Conversions for Agave Syrup</h2>  
<p>Beyond 20g to ounces, here are other handy agave syrup conversions: 50g = 1.76 oz, 100g = 3.53 oz. Bookmark <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>our conversion chart</a> for quick reference. These measurements ensure your air fryer dishes turn out perfectly sweetened every time.</p>  

<h3>Storing Agave Syrup for Freshness</h3>  
<p>Keep your agave syrup in a cool, dark place to prevent crystallisation. After opening, it lasts about a year. For sticky spills, <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>our cleaning guide</a> has tips to keep your air fryer spotless.</p>

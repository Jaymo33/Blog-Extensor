<h2>Why Convert 30g of Protein Powder to Ounces?</h2>  
<p>Converting 30g of protein powder to ounces is crucial for recipes requiring precise measurements. Many UK recipes use grams, while some kitchen scales or international recipes may list ounces.

<h3>How to Measure 30g of Protein Powder Accurately</h3>  
<p>To measure 30g of protein powder in ounces, use a digital kitchen scale for precision.

For air fryer recipes like protein muffins or pancakes, this ensures the right balance of dry and wet ingredients.

<h3>Does Protein Powder Brand Affect the Weight?</h3>  
<p>Yes, different protein powders vary in density, so 30g may look different between brands. Whey protein is fluffier than plant-based options, which are often denser. Always weigh your 30g (1.06 oz) instead of relying on scoop sizes. This is especially important for air fryer recipes, where exact measurements prevent dryness or sogginess.</p>

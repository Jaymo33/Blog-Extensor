<h2>How many ounces is 1.5 cups of gluten-free flour?</h2>  
<p>1.5 cups of gluten-free flour equals approximately 6.35 ounces (180 grams). This conversion is essential for baking, especially when using an air fryer, where precise measurements ensure even cooking. Gluten-free flour behaves differently than regular flour, so getting the weight right matters. Whether you’re making air fryer cookies or cakes, knowing this conversion helps avoid dry or dense results. For more air fryer baking tips, check out <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>our recipe collection</a>.</p>  

<p>Gluten-free flours vary in density, so weighing ingredients is more reliable than volume measurements. Brands like almond, coconut, or rice flour can differ slightly, but 1.5 cups typically lands near 6.35 oz. If you’re adapting a recipe for your air fryer, always measure by weight for consistency. Need a full conversion chart? Visit <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>our handy guide</a> for all your baking needs.</p>  

<h3>Why weight matters in gluten-free baking</h3>  
<p>Gluten-free flours lack the binding properties of wheat flour, making accurate measurements crucial. Too much or too little flour can lead to crumbly or gummy textures. For air fryer recipes, where heat circulates rapidly, precise ratios ensure even browning. A kitchen scale is your best friend here—skip the guesswork and measure directly in ounces. Explore <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>gluten-free cake recipes</a> tailored for air fryers.</p>  

<h2>Converting cups to ounces for UK bakers</h2>  
<p>In the UK, bakers often work in grams, but ounces are still widely used. 1.5 cups of gluten-free flour translates to 6.35 oz (180g), regardless of location. If your recipe uses metric measurements, a digital scale simplifies the process. Air fryer baking benefits from this precision, as even slight imbalances affect cooking time. For more UK-friendly conversions, bookmark <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>.</p>  

<p>Note that US and UK cup sizes are identical (240ml per cup), so no adjustment is needed. However, gluten-free flour brands may vary in weight per cup due to texture. Always check the packaging or weigh for accuracy. Planning a batch of air fryer cookies? See <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cookies>our cookie recipes</a> for foolproof ideas.</p>  

<h3>Tips for measuring gluten-free flour</h3>  
<p>Spoon the flour into the measuring cup and level it off—don’t scoop directly, as this compacts the flour. For air fryer recipes, sifting the flour first ensures a lighter texture. If you’re doubling a recipe, weigh each batch separately to maintain consistency. Keep your air fryer basket clean for even baking; <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>our cleaning guide</a> has you covered.</p>

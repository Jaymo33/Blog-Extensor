Whether you’re following a recipe from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes</a> or experimenting with your own creations, knowing how to convert grams to ounces is a game-changer.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter for Porridge Oats</h2>  
<p>Using the correct amount of porridge oats ensures your air fryer recipes turn out just right. Too little, and your dish might lack texture; too much, and it could become dry or dense.

<p>Converting 100g of porridge oats to ounces is straightforward once you know the ratio. Grams and ounces are both units of weight, but they belong to different measurement systems—metric and imperial, respectively. If you’re using a kitchen scale, switching between the two is simple with a quick calculation or a handy conversion chart.</p>  

<h3>How to Convert 100g of Porridge Oats to Ounces</h3>  
<p>To convert 100g of porridge oats to ounces, multiply the grams by 0.035274. This gives you 3.53 ounces, which is the standard conversion for most cooking purposes.

<h3>Tips for Measuring Porridge Oats Without a Scale</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a kitchen scale, you can estimate 100g of porridge oats using measuring cups. One cup of porridge oats typically weighs around 80-90g, so 100g is roughly 1.1 cups. However, this can vary depending on how tightly packed the oats are, so weighing is always best for accuracy.

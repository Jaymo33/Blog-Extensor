<p>15g of butter equals approximately 0.53 ounces. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements can make or break your dish. Whether you’re whipping up crispy potatoes or a buttery dessert, knowing how to convert grams to ounces ensures consistency. For more air fryer conversions, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate butter measurements matter in air frying</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of butter in your air fryer can affect texture, flavour, and cooking time. Too much butter might make your food greasy, while too little could leave it dry. For example, a recipe like air-fried salmon or crispy mushrooms often calls for precise butter quantities. If you’re unsure, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a> offers tested measurements for perfect results every time.</p>  

<p>Butter is often measured in grams in the UK, but some recipes use ounces, especially those from the US. Converting 15g of butter to ounces (0.53 oz) ensures you’re following the recipe correctly. This is particularly important for baking in your air fryer, where exact ratios matter. For more tips on air fryer baking, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>cake recipes</a>.</p>  

<h3>How to measure 15g of butter without scales</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a kitchen scale, you can still measure 15g of butter using tablespoons. One tablespoon of butter is roughly 14g, so just over a tablespoon will give you 15g. This method isn’t as precise as weighing, but it works in a pinch for recipes like air-fried vegetables or garlic bread.

<h2>Common air fryer recipes using 15g of butter</h2>  
<p>Many air fryer recipes call for small amounts of butter, like 15g, to add richness without overpowering the dish. For instance, buttery air-fried shrimp or herbed potatoes often use this quantity. If you’re experimenting, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable recipes</a> offer great inspiration for using butter sparingly and effectively.</p>  

<p>Butter also helps achieve a golden crisp on foods like air-fryer cookies or garlic knots. Since 15g of butter is just over half an ounce, it’s enough to coat lightly without making the dish heavy.

<h3>Converting other butter quantities for air frying</h3>  
<p>If your recipe calls for larger amounts, like 30g or 50g of butter, simply double or triple the 15g conversion. For example, 30g of butter equals about 1.06 ounces. This flexibility is handy for batch cooking or meal prep in your air fryer.

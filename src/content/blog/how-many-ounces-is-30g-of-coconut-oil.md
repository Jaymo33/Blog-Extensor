<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of coconut oil in your air fryer ensures even cooking and prevents dryness or sogginess. Too little oil, and your food might stick or lack crispiness.

<p>Many air fryer recipes, especially those for baked goods or roasted vegetables, rely on precise oil measurements. Coconut oil, with its high smoke point and rich flavour, is a popular choice. Whether you’re preparing a <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken dish</a> or a dessert, knowing how to convert 30g to ounces ensures consistency. This small detail can elevate your cooking from good to great.</p>  

<h3>How to measure 30g of coconut oil without scales</h3>

<h3>Tips for storing and melting coconut oil</h3>

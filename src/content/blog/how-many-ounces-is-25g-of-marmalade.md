<p>25g of marmalade is approximately 0.88 ounces. This conversion is essential for anyone using an air fryer to cook or bake with marmalade, as precise measurements can make all the difference in your recipes. Whether you're making a glaze for ham or a sweet topping for cakes, knowing how many ounces 25g of marmalade equals ensures accuracy and consistency.</p>

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>
<p>Using the correct amount of marmalade in your air fryer recipes is crucial for achieving the desired texture and flavour. Too much marmalade can make dishes overly sweet or sticky, while too little might leave them lacking in taste. Air fryers cook food quickly and evenly, so precise measurements help ensure perfect results every time. For more tips on air fryer cooking, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>

<p>Marmalade is a versatile ingredient that can be used in both sweet and savoury dishes. From glazes for meats to fillings for pastries, knowing how many ounces 25g of marmalade is will help you follow recipes accurately. If you're looking for inspiration, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipes section</a> has plenty of ideas to get you started.</p>

<h2>How to measure 25g of marmalade without scales</h2>
<p>If you don't have a kitchen scale, you can still measure 25g of marmalade using tablespoons. One tablespoon of marmalade is roughly 20g, so 25g would be just over one tablespoon. This method isn't as precise as using scales, but it's a handy alternative when you're in a pinch. For best results, we recommend investing in a digital scale for accurate measurements.</p>

<p>Another way to estimate 25g of marmalade is by volume. Marmalade has a similar density to honey, so 25g would be about 1.5 teaspoons. However, this can vary depending on the brand and thickness of the marmalade. Always check the label for specific weight-to-volume conversions if available.</p>

<h3>Converting 25g of marmalade to ounces for UK recipes</h3>
<p>In the UK, recipes often use grams, but some older recipes or international ones might use ounces. Knowing that 25g of marmalade is 0.88 ounces can help you adapt recipes to your preferred measurement system. This is particularly useful when using an air fryer, as precise measurements ensure even cooking and perfect results.</p>

<p>0.5 cups of yogurt equals approximately 120 grams, making it easy to measure for air fryer recipes and baking. This conversion ensures accuracy, whether you're whipping up a creamy dessert or a savoury marinade. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we know precise measurements are key to perfect results, especially when using an air fryer.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Yogurt Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Getting the right amount of yogurt—0.5 cups or 120 grams—can make or break a recipe. Too much can make batters runny, while too little might dry out dishes. Air fryer cooking, in particular, relies on balanced moisture for crispy yet tender results. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for other common ingredient swaps. Whether you're making a marinade for chicken or a cake batter, 0.5 cups of yogurt in grams ensures consistency.</p>  

<p>Yogurt adds creaminess and acidity to dishes, so precise measurements help maintain the intended texture and flavour. For example, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipes</a> often use yogurt for tenderising, and 120 grams is the sweet spot. If you're converting from US cups to grams, note that UK measurements may vary slightly—always double-check for accuracy.</p>  

<h3>Types of Yogurt and Their Weights</h3>  
<p>Not all yogurts weigh the same per 0.5 cups. Greek yogurt is denser, so 0.5 cups may weigh closer to 140 grams, while regular yogurt stays around 120 grams. Always adjust based on thickness for air fryer recipes.

<h2>How to Measure 0.5 Cups of Yogurt Without a Scale</h2>  
<p>No kitchen scale? Use the spoon-and-level method: spoon yogurt into a measuring cup and level it off with a knife. This ensures you get as close to 120 grams as possible. For sticky yogurts, lightly grease the cup first. If you're prepping <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/meal-prep>meal prep recipes</a>, weighing ingredients saves time and guarantees consistency.</p>

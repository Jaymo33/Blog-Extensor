<p>3 cups of chopped onion equals approximately 12 ounces (340 grams). This measurement is key for air fryer recipes, ensuring your dishes turn out perfectly every time. Whether you’re cooking onions for a stir-fry, caramelising them for a burger topping, or adding them to a casserole, knowing the weight helps with consistency. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we focus on precise measurements to make your cooking effortless.</p>

<h2>Why measuring onions accurately matters</h2>  
<p>Using the correct amount of onion ensures your air fryer recipes have the right balance of flavour and texture. Too much onion can overpower a dish, while too little might leave it lacking. For example, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>onion rings recipe</a> relies on precise measurements for that perfect crunch. Onions also vary in size, so measuring by weight (ounces) is more reliable than volume (cups). This is especially important when following recipes from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable-based dishes</a>.</p>  

<p>If you’re converting 3 cups of onion to ounces, remember that 1 cup of chopped onion is roughly 4 ounces. This makes scaling recipes up or down much easier. For air fryer cooking, evenly sized pieces ensure even cooking, so weighing your onions helps maintain consistency. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a> for other common ingredient measurements.</p>  

<h3>How to measure onions for air frying</h3>  
<p>To measure 3 cups of onion accurately, chop them uniformly before filling your measuring cup. Avoid packing the onions down, as this can lead to an incorrect measurement. If you’re using a kitchen scale, place your bowl on it, tare the weight, then add the onions until you reach 12 ounces. This method is foolproof and ensures your <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/potatoes>potato and onion dishes</a> turn out just right.</p>  

<h2>Common onion measurement conversions</h2>  
<p>Besides 3 cups to ounces, you might need other conversions for air fryer recipes. For instance, 1 medium onion yields about 1 cup chopped, or roughly 4 ounces. If a recipe calls for 6 ounces of onion, that’s 1.5 cups. Keeping these conversions handy saves time and reduces guesswork. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning guide</a> also helps maintain your air fryer for consistent cooking results.</p>  

<p>For UK cooks, note that fluid ounces and weight ounces differ slightly, but for onions, the difference is negligible. Whether you’re making a classic French onion soup or crispy air-fried onions, precise measurements matter.

<h3>Tips for cooking onions in an air fryer</h3>  
<p>Onions cook beautifully in an air fryer, caramelising evenly without excessive oil. For best results, toss them in a light coating of oil and spread them in a single layer. Cooking at 180°C (350°F) for 10-12 minutes usually yields perfect caramelised onions. Adjust the time if you prefer them crisper or softer.</p>

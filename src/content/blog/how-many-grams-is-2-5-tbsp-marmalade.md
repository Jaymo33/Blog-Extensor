<p>2.5 tablespoons (tbsp) of marmalade equals approximately 37.5 grams (g). This conversion is essential for precise air fryer cooking, ensuring your recipes turn out perfectly every time. Whether you’re making glazes, desserts, or sauces, accurate measurements make all the difference.</p>

<h2>Why accurate marmalade measurements matter</h2>  
<p>Using the correct amount of marmalade in your air fryer recipes ensures balanced flavours and textures. Too much can make dishes overly sweet or sticky, while too little might leave them lacking. For example, a glaze for air-fried ham or a topping for air fryer cakes needs precise measurements. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we emphasise accuracy to help you achieve restaurant-quality results at home.</p>  

<p>Converting tablespoons to grams is particularly useful for UK cooks, as many recipes use metric measurements. Marmalade’s density can vary slightly depending on brand or homemade recipes, but 2.5 tbsp generally weighs around 37.5 grams. This consistency is why we recommend using a kitchen scale for the best accuracy, especially when working with air fryer recipes.</p>  

<h2>How to measure 2.5 tbsp of marmalade without scales</h2>  
<p>If you don’t have a kitchen scale, you can still measure 2.5 tbsp of marmalade accurately. Use a standard UK tablespoon (15ml) and level off each spoonful with a knife to avoid excess. For sticky ingredients like marmalade, lightly greasing the spoon can help it slide off easily. This method is handy when preparing quick air fryer meals or desserts.</p>  

<p>Remember, 1 UK tablespoon of marmalade is roughly 15 grams, so 2.5 tbsp equals 37.5 grams. This conversion works well for most recipes, from glazing air-fried salmon to sweetening <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer breakfast dishes</a>.

<h3>Adjusting recipes based on marmalade density</h3>  
<p>While 2.5 tbsp of marmalade typically weighs 37.5 grams, thicker or chunkier varieties might be slightly heavier.

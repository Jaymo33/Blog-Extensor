<p>560 ml of condensed milk is approximately 2.37 cups. This conversion is essential for baking and cooking, especially when using an air fryer where precise measurements matter. Whether you're making a cake, fudge, or a creamy dessert, knowing how many cups 560 ml of condensed milk equals ensures consistency in your recipes.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of condensed milk can make or break your air fryer dessert. Too little, and your dish might lack sweetness or creaminess; too much, and it could become overly dense. Air fryers cook food quickly and evenly, so precise measurements like 560 ml of condensed milk in cups help achieve perfect results.

<h3>Does Condensed Milk Thicken When Heated in an Air Fryer?</h3>

<p>Whether you're baking or making no-cook desserts, 560 ml of condensed milk in cups is a handy conversion.

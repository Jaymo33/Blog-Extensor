<p>280°F converts to approximately 140°C in a fan oven. This is the standard conversion for most recipes, whether you're using an air fryer or a conventional fan-assisted oven. Understanding this conversion ensures your dishes cook evenly and avoid burning or undercooking. For precise results, always refer to your appliance's manual or our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>

<h2>Why Convert 280°F to Fan Oven?</h2>
<p>Fan ovens circulate hot air for faster, more even cooking, which means temperatures often need adjusting. At 280°F (140°C fan), foods like roasted vegetables or baked goods achieve perfect texture without drying out. This is especially useful for air fryers, which work similarly to fan ovens but in a compact space. If you're adapting a recipe from a conventional oven, this conversion ensures consistency.

<p>Many air fryer users find 280°F ideal for reheating or slow-cooking delicate items. Unlike higher heats, it prevents burning while thoroughly warming dishes. This temperature also works well for proofing dough or dehydrating fruits. Always preheat your appliance for accuracy, as fan ovens and air fryers heat up quickly.

<h3>How Fan Ovens Differ from Conventional Ovens</h3>
<p>Fan ovens use a built-in fan to distribute heat, reducing cooking times by about 20%. This means 280°F in a conventional oven behaves like 140°C in a fan setting. Air fryers amplify this effect with rapid air circulation, so monitoring doneness is key. Foods like chicken wings or fries benefit from this efficient heat distribution.

<h2>Common Uses for 280°F in Fan Ovens</h2>
<p>This temperature excels at reheating leftovers without sogginess. Pizza, casseroles, and even fried foods regain crispiness at 280°F (140°C fan). It's also a safe bet for baking custards or cheesecakes that require gentle heat. In air fryers, it’s perfect for toasting nuts or drying herbs.

<p>For frozen foods, 280°F helps thaw and cook evenly. Items like spring rolls or fish fillets avoid exterior burns while heating through. Remember to shake or flip foods halfway for uniform cooking. This mimics the fan oven’s even airflow, a trick borrowed from professional kitchens. Always use a meat thermometer for proteins to ensure safety.</p>

<h3>Adjusting Cooking Times</h3>
<p>Since fan ovens cook faster, reduce times by 5-10 minutes when using 280°F. Air fryers may need even less time due to their compact size. Start checking doneness early, especially with baked goods or meats. Keep a log of adjustments for your favourite dishes to streamline future cooking.

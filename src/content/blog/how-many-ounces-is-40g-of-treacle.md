<p>40 grams of treacle is approximately 1.41 ounces. This conversion is essential for precise baking and cooking, especially when using an air fryer where measurements matter. Whether you’re whipping up a sticky toffee pudding or a glaze for meats, knowing how to convert grams to ounces ensures your recipes turn out perfectly every time.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on precise cooking times and ingredient ratios to deliver crispy, evenly cooked results. Using the correct amount of treacle—whether 40g or its ounce equivalent—can make or break a recipe. Too much treacle can cause burning, while too little might leave your dish lacking in flavour.

<p>Treacle, a thick syrup made during sugar refining, is a staple in British baking. Its sticky consistency means even small measurement errors can affect texture and taste. If you’re adapting a recipe from grams to ounces, always double-check your conversions to avoid mishaps. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a> includes plenty of treacle-based dishes to try.</p>  

<h3>How to measure 40g of treacle without scales</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a digital scale, you can still measure 40g of treacle using tablespoons. One tablespoon of treacle weighs roughly 20g, so two level tablespoons will give you 40g (or about 1.41 ounces). For sticky ingredients like treacle, lightly greasing your spoon can help it slide off more easily.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for treacle in air fryer recipes</h2>  
<p>Treacle adds depth and sweetness to both sweet and savoury dishes. In an air fryer, it’s perfect for glazing ham, making gingerbread, or adding a caramelised finish to roasted vegetables. For inspiration, browse our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert recipes</a> featuring treacle.</p>  

<p>When working with treacle in an air fryer, remember it can burn quickly due to its high sugar content. To prevent this, mix it with other liquids like vinegar or soy sauce for marinades, or brush it onto food in thin layers. Cleaning treacle residue from your air fryer?

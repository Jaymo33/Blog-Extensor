<p>30g of condensed milk is approximately 1.06 ounces. This conversion is essential for precise measurements, especially when using an air fryer for baking or cooking. Whether you're whipping up a dessert or adding a sweet touch to a dish, knowing the exact weight ensures consistency. For more air fryer conversions, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on precise measurements to deliver even cooking and perfect textures. Using too much or too little condensed milk can affect the outcome of your recipe. For example, adding 30g of condensed milk instead of 1.06 ounces might seem minor, but it can alter moisture levels. This is especially important for recipes like cakes or custards, where balance is key. Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> for dishes that benefit from exact measurements.</p>  

<p>Condensed milk is a staple in many desserts, from fudges to pies. Measuring 30g correctly ensures your treats turn out just right. If you're working with UK measurements, 30g of condensed milk equals roughly 1.06 ounces. This small but crucial detail can make all the difference in your air fryer creations. For more tips on perfecting your bakes, visit our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert recipe category</a>.</p>  

<h3>How to measure 30g of condensed milk without a scale</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a digital scale, you can still measure 30g of condensed milk using tablespoons. One tablespoon of condensed milk weighs about 20g, so 1.5 tablespoons will give you roughly 30g. This method isn’t as precise as weighing, but it works in a pinch. For best results, invest in a kitchen scale to ensure accuracy. You’ll find it invaluable for all your air fryer cooking needs.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for 30g of condensed milk in air fryer recipes</h2>  
<p>Condensed milk adds richness and sweetness to many air fryer dishes. A 30g portion is perfect for small batches of fudge, caramel sauces, or even as a glaze for pastries. Its thick consistency helps bind ingredients, making it ideal for no-bake treats. If you’re experimenting with new recipes, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>cake recipe category</a> has plenty of inspiration.</p>  

<p>Another great use for 30g of condensed milk is in air fryer cheesecakes or custards. The precise measurement ensures the right texture and sweetness. Too much can make the dish overly sweet, while too little might leave it lacking flavour. For cleaning tips after making sticky treats, check out our guide on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner</a>.</p>  

<h3>Converting other weights of condensed milk to ounces</h3>  
<p>If your recipe calls for a different amount of condensed milk, here’s a quick reference: 50g is about 1.76 ounces, and 100g is roughly 3.53 ounces. These conversions are handy when scaling recipes up or down. Remember, accuracy is key for consistent results in your air fryer.

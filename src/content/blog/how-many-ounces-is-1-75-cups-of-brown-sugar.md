If substituting, reduce the liquid in the recipe slightly, as granulated sugar doesn’t retain moisture like brown sugar."

    "text": "Store brown sugar in an airtight container with a terra cotta brown sugar saver or a slice of bread to maintain moisture. If it hardens, revive it by microwaving with a damp paper towel for 20-second intervals. Proper storage ensures accurate measurements for recipes calling for 1.75 cups."

Conversely, overpacking can make dishes overly sweet. Always measure carefully and consider using a scale for consistency, especially in air fryer baking."

<p>1.75 cups of brown sugar equals approximately 14 ounces (oz). This conversion is essential for baking and cooking, especially when using an air fryer for recipes that require precise measurements. Whether you're making cookies, cakes, or even savoury dishes, knowing the weight ensures consistency and perfect results every time.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>When using an air fryer, precise measurements can make or break a recipe. Unlike traditional ovens, air fryers circulate hot air rapidly, meaning ingredient ratios must be spot-on to avoid undercooking or burning. Brown sugar, in particular, can clump or caramelise differently if not measured correctly. For more air fryer tips, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> to simplify your cooking process.</p>  

<p>Many air fryer recipes, like our popular <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cookies>cookie recipes</a>, rely on brown sugar for texture and flavour. Using 1.75 cups (14 oz) ensures your treats come out perfectly chewy or crispy, depending on your preference. If you're new to air frying, start with smaller batches to test measurements before scaling up.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure Brown Sugar Correctly</h3>  
<p>Brown sugar should be packed firmly into the measuring cup for accuracy. Unlike granulated sugar, which can be scooped loosely, brown sugar’s moisture content means it settles differently. Use the back of a spoon to press it down, ensuring no air gaps. This method guarantees you’re using the right amount—whether it’s 1.75 cups or smaller quantities.</p>  

<h2>Converting Cups to Ounces for UK Bakers</h2>  
<p>In the UK, bakers often work in grams or ounces rather than cups. If your recipe calls for 1.75 cups of brown sugar, knowing it’s 14 oz helps bridge the gap between measurement systems. For more UK-friendly conversions, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a>, tailored to local preferences and appliances.</p>  

<p>Air fryers are versatile, but ingredient weights can vary by brand. For example, 1.75 cups of brown sugar might weigh slightly more or less depending on humidity. If precision is critical, use a kitchen scale. This is especially handy for recipes like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>cakes</a>, where texture relies on exact ratios.</p>  

<h3>Common Mistakes When Measuring Brown Sugar</h3>  
<p>One mistake is using a liquid measuring cup for dry ingredients like brown sugar. These cups are designed for fluids and can lead to overpacking. Always use dry measuring cups for 1.75 cups of brown sugar to avoid discrepancies. Another tip? Store brown sugar in an airtight container to prevent hardening, which can throw off measurements.</p>  

<h2>Scaling Recipes Up or Down</h2>  
<p>If your air fryer recipe requires more or less than 1.75 cups of brown sugar, here’s a quick reference: 1 cup = 8 oz, so adjust accordingly. For example, 0.75 cups would be 6 oz. Need to clean sticky residue from your air fryer after baking? Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning guide</a> has you covered.</p>  

<p>Remember, air fryers heat quickly, so even small measurement errors can affect cooking times. If you’re doubling a recipe, ensure your air fryer basket isn’t overcrowded. This is crucial for dishes like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>desserts</a>, where even browning is key. Happy baking!</p>

<h2>Why accurate chickpea measurements matter</h2>

<h2>How to measure chickpeas for air frying</h2>
<p>For the most accurate results, use a kitchen scale to weigh your chickpeas. If you don’t have one, a measuring cup will do—just remember that 1.5 cups of chickpeas is roughly 12 ounces. This measurement works whether you’re using them whole, mashed, or blended into hummus.</p>
<p>When preparing chickpeas for the air fryer, rinse and drain them thoroughly to remove excess moisture. Pat them dry with a kitchen towel to help them crisp up better.

<h3>Converting chickpeas for different recipes</h3>
<p>If a recipe calls for ounces but you only have cup measurements, now you know 1.5 cups of chickpeas equal 12 ounces.

<h2>Tips for cooking chickpeas in the air fryer</h2>
<p>To get the best results, toss your chickpeas with a bit of oil and your favourite seasonings before air frying. Spread them in a single layer to ensure even cooking, and shake the basket halfway through. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we recommend experimenting with flavours like smoked paprika, garlic powder, or cumin for extra depth.</p>
<p>If you’re using canned chickpeas, reduce the cooking time slightly since they’re already pre-cooked. For dried chickpeas, soak and boil them first before air frying. Either way, knowing that 1.5 cups of chickpeas equal 12 ounces helps you portion your recipes perfectly.</p>

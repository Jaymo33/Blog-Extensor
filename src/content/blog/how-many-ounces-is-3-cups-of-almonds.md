<h2>Why Accurate Almond Measurements Matter</h2>

<p>Almonds are a versatile ingredient, adding crunch and nutrition to meals. Whether you're using sliced, whole, or ground almonds, measuring by weight (ounces) is often more reliable than volume (cups). This is especially true for air fryer cooking, where even heat distribution is crucial.</p>  

<h2>How to Measure Almonds Correctly</h2>  
<p>For the most accurate results, use a kitchen scale to weigh your almonds. If you don’t have one, lightly spoon almonds into a measuring cup without packing them down. Avoid tapping the cup, as this compacts the almonds and skews the measurement. For more air fryer tips, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a>.</p>  

<h3>Whole vs. Sliced Almonds</h3>  
<p>Whole almonds and sliced almonds have slightly different weights per cup due to air gaps. While 3 cups of whole almonds weigh around 12 ounces, sliced almonds may be closer to 10 ounces. Always adjust measurements based on the almond form specified in your recipe.</p>  

<h2>Common Almond Recipes for the Air Fryer</h2>  
<p>Almonds shine in air fryer recipes, from savoury coatings to sweet treats. Try almond-crusted chicken tenders or air-fried almond biscotti for a delicious crunch. For more inspiration, browse our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert category</a>.</p>  

<p>Roasting almonds in the air fryer is another great way to enhance their flavour. Toss them with a bit of oil and salt, then air fry at 160°C for 5-7 minutes. Keep an eye on them to prevent burning, as almonds cook quickly in the air fryer.</p>  

<h3>Storing Almonds for Freshness</h3>  
<p>To keep almonds fresh, store them in an airtight container in a cool, dark place. For longer storage, freeze them in a sealed bag. Proper storage ensures your almonds stay crisp and ready for your next air fryer creation.</p>

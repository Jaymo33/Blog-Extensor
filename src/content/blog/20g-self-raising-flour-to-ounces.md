<p>20g of self-raising flour equals approximately 0.71 ounces. This conversion is essential for air fryer baking, where precise measurements can make or break your recipe. Whether you’re making fluffy cakes or crispy batters, knowing how to convert grams to ounces ensures consistency. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we help you nail every measurement for perfect air fryer results.</p>  

<h2>Why Convert 20g of Self-Raising Flour to Ounces?</h2>  
<p>Many UK bakers prefer using grams, but some recipes, especially older ones, list ingredients in ounces. Converting 20g of self-raising flour to ounces (0.71 oz) ensures accuracy, especially in air fryer recipes where small quantities matter. A slight mismeasurement can affect the rise and texture of your baked goods. For more conversion tips, check our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>  

<p>Self-raising flour contains baking powder, so precise measurements are crucial. Too much or too little can throw off the chemical balance, leading to dense or overly puffed results. If you’re scaling a recipe up or down, converting 20g to ounces helps maintain the right ratios. Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> for foolproof baking ideas.</p>  

<h3>Tools for Measuring 20g of Self-Raising Flour</h3>  
<p>A digital kitchen scale is the most accurate way to measure 20g of self-raising flour (0.71 oz). If you don’t have one, use a measuring spoon: roughly 4 level tablespoons equal 20g. Avoid packing the flour, as this can lead to excess. For more tips on keeping your air fryer mess-free, see our guide on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaning</a>.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for 20g of Self-Raising Flour</h2>  
<p>Small quantities like 20g (0.71 oz) of self-raising flour are perfect for single-serving air fryer cakes or coating proteins. Try it in mini sponge cakes or as a light dusting for fried chicken. The precise measurement ensures even cooking and perfect texture. For inspiration, browse our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>air fryer cake recipes</a>.</p>  

<p>Self-raising flour’s leavening properties make it ideal for quick breads and batters. Converting 20g to ounces helps when adjusting portion sizes or experimenting with new recipes. Whether you’re baking or frying, accuracy is key. Discover more ways to use self-raising flour in our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert category</a>.</p>  

<h3>Tips for Storing Self-Raising Flour</h3>  
<p>Keep self-raising flour in an airtight container to preserve its rising power. Humidity can activate the baking powder prematurely, so store it in a cool, dry place. If your 20g measurement seems off, check for clumps and sift the flour before use.</p>

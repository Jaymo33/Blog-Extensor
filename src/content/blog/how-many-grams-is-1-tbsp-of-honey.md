<p>1 tablespoon (tbsp) of honey weighs approximately 21 grams in the UK. This measurement is essential for air fryer recipes where precision can make or break your dish. Whether you’re drizzling honey over roasted vegetables or using it to sweeten baked goods, knowing the exact weight ensures consistent results. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we focus on accurate conversions to help you cook with confidence. Keep reading to learn more about measuring honey and its uses in air frying.</p>

<h2>Why accurate honey measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>
<p>Using the correct amount of honey ensures your dishes aren’t overly sweet or lacking flavour. In air fryer recipes, honey acts as a glaze, marinade, or sweetener, so precision is key. Too much honey can cause burning due to its high sugar content, while too little might leave your dish bland. For example, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>honey-glazed salmon recipe</a> relies on the perfect 21-gram measurement per tablespoon. This balance enhances taste without compromising texture or cooking time.</p>

<p>Honey’s viscosity means volume measurements like tablespoons can vary slightly. Weight measurements in grams eliminate this inconsistency, especially in baking. If you’re adapting oven recipes for your air fryer, converting tablespoons to grams ensures reliability. Check our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for other common ingredient conversions. Accurate measurements also help when scaling recipes up or down for meal prep or smaller portions.</p>

<h2>How to measure 1 tbsp of honey in grams</h2>
<p>The simplest way to measure honey is using a digital kitchen scale. Place your mixing bowl or spoon on the scale, tare it to zero, then add honey until it reads 21 grams. If you don’t have scales, use a standard UK tablespoon (15ml) and level it off with a knife. Remember that honey’s stickiness can make volume measurements tricky, so scraping the spoon clean ensures accuracy. For sticky ingredients like honey, we recommend using a <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>non-stick air fryer liner</a> to simplify cleanup afterwards.</p>

<h3>Converting other honey quantities</h3>
<p>If your recipe calls for multiple tablespoons, multiply accordingly: 2 tbsp = 42 grams, 3 tbsp = 63 grams, and so on. For smaller amounts, 1 teaspoon (tsp) of honey weighs about 7 grams. These conversions are handy when adjusting <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert recipes</a> or marinades. Always use grams for precision, especially in air fryer baking where cooking times are shorter and measurements matter more.</p>

<h2>Common uses for honey in air fryer recipes</h2>
<p>Honey works wonderfully in both sweet and savoury air fryer dishes. It caramelises beautifully, creating glossy glazes for meats like chicken or pork. Try brushing 21 grams (1 tbsp) of honey over <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>air fryer chicken wings</a> during the last few minutes of cooking for sticky perfection. In baking, honey adds moisture to cakes and cookies while helping them brown evenly. Its natural sweetness means you can often reduce other sugars in recipes.</p>

<p>Honey also makes excellent marinades when combined with ingredients like soy sauce or mustard. For vegetables, a light honey drizzle before air frying enhances natural flavours. Just remember that honey burns at high temperatures, so add it towards the end of cooking. Our tip: mix honey with a little oil or water to help it distribute evenly without burning.

<h3>Storing and handling honey for best results</h3>
<p>Store honey in a cool, dry place to maintain its quality. If it crystallises, gently warm the jar in warm water to return it to liquid form. When measuring, warm honey flows more easily but doesn’t significantly affect the weight. Always use clean, dry utensils to prevent contamination. For easy cleanup after cooking with honey, wipe your air fryer basket while it’s still warm to remove any sticky residue before it hardens.</p>

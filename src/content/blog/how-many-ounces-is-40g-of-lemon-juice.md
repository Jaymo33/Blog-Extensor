<p>40g of lemon juice equals approximately 1.41 ounces. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precision matters, ensuring your dishes turn out perfectly every time. Whether you’re marinating chicken or adding a zesty kick to desserts, knowing the exact weight-to-volume ratio is key. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we help simplify these conversions so you can focus on cooking. Let’s dive deeper into why this measurement matters and how to use it in your kitchen.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate lemon juice measurements matter</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of lemon juice can make or break a recipe. Too little, and your dish might lack brightness; too much, and it could become overly acidic. For air fryer recipes, precision ensures even cooking and balanced flavours. Whether you’re making crispy lemon chicken or a tangy glaze for salmon, 40g of lemon juice (1.41 ounces) is a common measurement. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more handy tips.</p>  

<p>Lemon juice is often used in marinades, dressings, and sauces, where exact proportions are crucial. In baking, acidity affects texture, so measuring 40g of lemon juice correctly ensures your cakes and cookies turn out just right.

<h3>How to measure 40g of lemon juice</h3>  
<p>The easiest way to measure 40g of lemon juice is with a digital kitchen scale. Simply place your container on the scale, tare it to zero, and pour the juice until it hits 40g. If you don’t have a scale, 1.41 ounces is roughly 2.5 tablespoons. Remember, fresh lemon juice is always best for flavour, but bottled works in a pinch.

<h2>Common uses for 40g of lemon juice</h2>  
<p>40g of lemon juice is a versatile amount used in many air fryer recipes. It’s perfect for marinating chicken, adding zest to roasted vegetables, or creating a light glaze for fish. The acidity helps tenderise meat while adding a fresh, vibrant flavour. If you’re cooking shrimp or tofu, a 40g lemon juice marinade can elevate the dish. Discover more inspiration in our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipes</a> collection.</p>  

<p>Lemon juice also works wonders in desserts, balancing sweetness with a tangy kick. From lemon drizzle cakes to air-fried lemon cookies, 40g is often the magic number. For cleaning your air fryer after cooking, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner guide</a> has all the tips you need.</p>  

<h3>Converting other lemon juice amounts</h3>  
<p>If your recipe calls for more or less lemon juice, you can easily scale the conversion. For example, 20g is about 0.7 ounces, while 80g is roughly 2.82 ounces. Keeping these conversions handy saves time and ensures consistency in your cooking. Whether you’re prepping meal kits or experimenting with new dishes, accurate measurements are your best friend.</p>

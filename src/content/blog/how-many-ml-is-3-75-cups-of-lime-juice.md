<h2>Why Accurate Lime Juice Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of lime juice can elevate your air fryer dishes, balancing flavours without overpowering them. Too little juice might leave your meal lacking zest, while too much can make it overly acidic. For recipes like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer lime chicken</a> or citrus-glazed salmon, precision is key.

<h2>How to Measure Lime Juice Correctly</h2>  
<p>When converting 3.75 cups of lime juice to ml, it's important to use the right tools.

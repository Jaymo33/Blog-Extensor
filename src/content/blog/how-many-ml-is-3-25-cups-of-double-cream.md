<p>Double cream is a staple in many British recipes, from scones to custards. Its high fat content means it behaves differently than single cream or milk, making accuracy crucial.

<h3>How to Measure Double Cream Correctly</h3>  
<p>For the most accurate conversion, use a liquid measuring jug with ml markings. Scooping double cream with a cup measure can lead to inconsistencies due to its thickness.

This means 3.25 US cups of double cream is 780 ml, whereas 3.25 UK cups is 923 ml—so always check which cup measurement your recipe uses.

<p>30g of soy milk equals approximately 1.06 ounces. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements can make all the difference. Whether you’re whipping up a dairy-free batter or adding moisture to a dish, knowing how many ounces is 30g of soy milk ensures consistency. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we focus on making conversions effortless for home cooks. Let’s dive deeper into why this measurement matters and how to use it in your air fryer.</p>

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on precise ingredient ratios to achieve the perfect texture and flavour. Too much or too little liquid, like soy milk, can affect browning and crispiness. For example, if a recipe calls for 30g of soy milk and you use the wrong ounce equivalent, your batter might be too thick or thin. This is especially important for recipes like vegan pancakes or crispy tofu coatings. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more handy measurement swaps. Consistency is key to mastering air fryer cooking.</p>  

<p>Many air fryer recipes, especially those for baked goods or coatings, require exact liquid measurements. Soy milk is a popular dairy-free alternative, but its weight-to-volume ratio differs from cow’s milk. That’s why converting 30g of soy milk to ounces (1.06 oz) ensures your recipes turn out right every time. Whether you’re meal prepping or experimenting with new dishes, accurate conversions prevent kitchen mishaps. For more recipe ideas, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a> featuring soy milk-based dishes.</p>

<h2>How to measure 30g of soy milk without scales</h2>  
<p>If you don’t have digital scales, you can still measure 30g of soy milk (1.06 oz) using volume measurements. Two tablespoons of soy milk roughly equal 30g, but this can vary slightly by brand. For the most accurate results, use a liquid measuring cup marked in fluid ounces. Remember that 30g of soy milk to ounces is a weight-to-volume conversion, so density plays a role. Always stir your soy milk before measuring to ensure consistency.</p>  

<h3>Converting other soy milk amounts</h3>  
<p>The same principles apply when converting different quantities of soy milk. For example, 15g equals about 0.53 ounces, while 60g is approximately 2.12 ounces. These conversions are handy when scaling recipes up or down for your air fryer. Bookmark our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a> for quick reference during cooking sessions. Whether you’re making a small batch of vegan muffins or a family-sized portion, precise measurements guarantee success.</p>  

<h2>Soy milk in popular air fryer recipes</h2>  
<p>Soy milk works wonderfully in various air fryer dishes, from breakfast to desserts. Try it in vegan French toast, where 30g of soy milk (1.06 oz) combines with spices for the perfect dip. It’s also great in batter for onion rings or as a binder for breadcrumbs. Discover creative ways to use soy milk in our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert category</a>, featuring dairy-free treats. The versatility of soy milk makes it a staple for health-conscious air fryer enthusiasts.</p>  

<p>When substituting soy milk in recipes originally designed for dairy, remember that 30g of soy milk to ounces (1.06 oz) may behave differently in cooking. Soy milk has a slightly sweeter taste and thinner consistency, which can affect browning times in the air fryer. Adjust cooking times by 1-2 minutes if needed, and always preheat your air fryer for even results.

<h3>Storing soy milk for air fryer use</h3>  
<p>Proper storage ensures your soy milk maintains its quality for air fryer recipes. After opening, refrigerate soy milk and use within 5-7 days for best results. Shake well before measuring out 30g (1.06 oz) portions, as separation can occur. For longer storage, consider freezing soy milk in 30g portions – just thaw and stir before use. This prep trick saves time when you’re ready to cook.</p>

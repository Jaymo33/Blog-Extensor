Whether you’re whipping up a dairy-free batter or adding moisture to a dish, knowing how many ounces is 30g of soy milk ensures consistency.

Let’s dive deeper into why this measurement matters and how to use it in your air fryer.</p>

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on precise ingredient ratios to achieve the perfect texture and flavour. Too much or too little liquid, like soy milk, can affect browning and crispiness. For example, if a recipe calls for 30g of soy milk and you use the wrong ounce equivalent, your batter might be too thick or thin. This is especially important for recipes like vegan pancakes or crispy tofu coatings.

Consistency is key to mastering air fryer cooking.</p>  

<p>Many air fryer recipes, especially those for baked goods or coatings, require exact liquid measurements. Soy milk is a popular dairy-free alternative, but its weight-to-volume ratio differs from cow’s milk. That’s why converting 30g of soy milk to ounces (1.06 oz) ensures your recipes turn out right every time. Whether you’re meal prepping or experimenting with new dishes, accurate conversions prevent kitchen mishaps.

<p>100g of Nutella equals approximately 3.53 ounces. This conversion is essential for anyone using recipes that list ingredients in grams or ounces, especially when preparing air fryer treats. Whether you’re making a Nutella-filled pastry or a chocolatey dessert, knowing this measurement ensures accuracy.</p>  

<h2>Why converting 100g of Nutella to ounces matters</h2>  
<p>Many UK recipes, especially those for air fryers, use metric measurements like grams. However, some older or international recipes might list ingredients in ounces. Converting 100g of Nutella to ounces (3.53 oz) helps avoid mistakes and ensures your dish turns out perfectly. For more air fryer conversions, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>  

<p>Nutella’s thick, spreadable consistency means its weight can vary slightly depending on how it’s measured. Scooping it directly from the jar with a spoon might yield a different weight compared to levelling it off. For precise baking, using a kitchen scale is best. If you’re working with other ingredients, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a> has plenty of ideas.</p>  

<h3>How to measure 100g of Nutella without scales</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a kitchen scale, you can estimate 100g of Nutella using tablespoons. One tablespoon of Nutella weighs roughly 19g, so 100g is about 5.25 tablespoons. This method isn’t as precise as weighing, but it works in a pinch for recipes like air fryer brownies or stuffed French toast.</p>  

<h2>Using Nutella in air fryer recipes</h2>  
<p>Nutella is a versatile ingredient for air fryer recipes, from stuffed croissants to chocolate drizzles. Knowing that 100g of Nutella equals 3.53 ounces helps when adjusting portion sizes or scaling recipes. For inspiration, browse our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert category</a> for delicious ideas.</p>  

<p>When working with Nutella in the air fryer, remember it melts quickly. Preheating your air fryer and using parchment liners can prevent messes. If you need tips on keeping your appliance clean, our guide on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaning</a> has you covered.</p>  

<h3>Common conversions for Nutella</h3>  
<p>Besides 100g of Nutella to ounces, other handy conversions include 50g (1.76 oz) or 200g (7.05 oz). These measurements are useful for batch cooking or meal prepping.

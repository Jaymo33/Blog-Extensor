<p>Nutella’s thick, spreadable consistency means its weight can vary slightly depending on how it’s measured. Scooping it directly from the jar with a spoon might yield a different weight compared to levelling it off. For precise baking, using a kitchen scale is best. If you’re working with other ingredients, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a> has plenty of ideas.</p>

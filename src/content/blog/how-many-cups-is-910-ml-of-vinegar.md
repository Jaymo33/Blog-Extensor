<h2>Why Accurate Vinegar Measurements Matter</h2>

<h2>UK vs. US Cup Measurements</h2>  
<p>It's worth noting that UK and US cup measurements differ slightly. In the UK, 1 cup equals 284 ml, while in the US, it's 240 ml. This means 910 ml of vinegar converts to roughly 3.85 UK cups or 3.84 US cups. For most recipes, this minor difference won't affect the outcome, but it's good to be aware of.</p>  
<p>If you're following a recipe from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>our collection</a>, always check whether it uses UK or US measurements. This ensures your air fryer dishes turn out as intended, whether you're cooking a savoury main or a sweet treat.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure 910 ml of Vinegar Without a Measuring Cup</h3>  
<p>If you don't have a measuring cup, you can use a kitchen scale. Since vinegar has a similar density to water, 910 ml weighs roughly 910 grams. Alternatively, use a standard mug (about 300 ml) and adjust accordingly.

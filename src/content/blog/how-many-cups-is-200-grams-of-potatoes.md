<p>200 grams of potatoes equals roughly 1.25 cups when diced or sliced, but this can vary slightly based on potato type and cut size. Whether you're prepping for crispy air fryer roasties or a hearty potato bake, accurate measurements ensure perfect results every time. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we know precision matters, especially when converting grams to cups for UK and US recipes.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Potato Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Getting the right amount of potatoes ensures even cooking and avoids overcrowding in your air fryer. Too many potatoes can lead to steaming instead of crisping, while too few might dry out. For recipes like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/potatoes>air fryer potato wedges</a>, 200 grams is a common portion size. This measurement also helps when scaling recipes up or down for meal prep.</p>  

<p>Different potato varieties, such as Maris Piper or King Edward, have slight density variations, but 200 grams generally fills just over one standard measuring cup. If you’re using a kitchen scale, weigh after peeling and chopping for the most accurate results. For more conversion tips, check our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure 200 Grams of Potatoes Without a Scale</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a scale, use a measuring cup and lightly pack diced potatoes to reach the 1.25-cup mark. For whole small potatoes, about 2 medium-sized spuds will weigh close to 200 grams. Remember, air fryer recipes like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>hash browns or potato croquettes</a> rely on consistent sizing for even cooking.</p>  

<h2>Converting 200 Grams of Potatoes for Different Recipes</h2>  
<p>Whether you’re making roast potatoes, mash, or air-fried chips, 200 grams of potatoes adapts easily. For crispy skins, toss diced potatoes in oil before air frying at 200°C for 15–20 minutes. If boiling for mash, 200 grams yields about one generous serving. For US readers, note that UK cup sizes are slightly larger (250ml vs. 240ml), but the difference is negligible for most recipes.</p>  

<p>Prepping frozen potatoes? Check our guide to <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/frozen-foods>cooking frozen foods in the air fryer</a>. Frozen diced potatoes often weigh similarly to fresh, but always check packaging for exact conversions. Keep your air fryer basket clean between uses with our recommended <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning tips</a>.</p>  

<h3>Common Mistakes When Measuring Potatoes</h3>  
<p>Avoid packing potatoes too tightly into cups, as this can add extra weight. Also, peeling potatoes reduces their volume—200 grams of peeled potatoes fills slightly less than unpeeled. For best results, weigh after prepping to match recipe requirements. If your air fryer recipe calls for "200 grams of potatoes in cups," err on the side of slightly less to prevent overcrowding.</p>

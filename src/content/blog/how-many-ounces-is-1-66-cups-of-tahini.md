<p>1.66 cups of tahini equals approximately 13.28 ounces. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precision ensures the best texture and flavour. Whether you're making dips, dressings, or baked goods, knowing the exact weight of tahini helps avoid kitchen mishaps. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we focus on making measurements easy so your dishes turn out perfectly every time.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Tahini Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Using the correct amount of tahini can make or break a recipe. Too little, and your hummus might lack creaminess; too much, and your cookies could turn greasy. Air fryer cooking, in particular, benefits from precise ingredient ratios to ensure even cooking and perfect results. That’s why converting 1.66 cups of tahini to ounces (13.28 oz) is so important.</p>  
<p>For more air fryer measurement tips, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>. It covers everything from flour to liquids, so you’ll never second-guess your quantities again. Whether you're preparing a savoury dish or a sweet treat, accurate measurements are the key to success.</p>  

<h2>How to Measure Tahini Correctly</h2>  
<p>Tahini’s thick, sticky consistency can make measuring tricky. For the most accurate results, use a kitchen scale to weigh out 13.28 ounces (the equivalent of 1.66 cups). If you don’t have a scale, spoon the tahini into a measuring cup and level it off with a knife. Avoid packing it down, as this can lead to over-measuring.</p>  

<h3>Using Tahini in Air Fryer Recipes</h3>  
<p>Tahini works wonderfully in air fryer recipes, from marinades to desserts. Try it in our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>tahini-glazed chicken</a> or as a base for energy bites. Since air fryers cook food quickly and evenly, precise measurements ensure your dishes aren’t too dry or overly rich.</p>  

<h2>Common Tahini Conversions</h2>

Bookmark our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a> for quick reference.

<h3>Storing Tahini for Freshness</h3>  
<p>To keep tahini from separating or going rancid, store it in a cool, dark place. Stir well before each use, especially if it’s been sitting. Proper storage ensures your 1.66 cups (13.28 oz) of tahini stays fresh for months, ready for your next air fryer creation.</p>

<p id="">An air fry tray is a perforated metal or silicone insert that fits inside your air fryer basket, designed to improve air circulation and cooking efficiency. This simple yet brilliant piece of air fryer equipment helps prevent food from sticking while ensuring even crispiness throughout.</p><h2 id="">Why every air fryer needs a tray</h2><p id="">Air fry trays solve one of the biggest challenges in air frying - overcrowding. When you pile food directly into the basket, the lower layers steam rather than crisp up. The elevated design of an air fry tray allows hot air to circulate underneath your food, giving you restaurant-quality results every time.</p><p id="">These clever air fryer attachments are particularly useful when cooking multiple items at once. Try using one for our <a href="https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken" id="">chicken recipes</a> while placing vegetables directly in the basket below - you'll get perfectly cooked meals with minimal effort. Many home cooks find it's their most-used among all their air frying accessories.</p><h3 id="">Types of air fry trays available</h3><p id="">You'll find three main varieties: stainless steel mesh trays (great for durability), silicone-coated trays (ideal for non-stick needs), and multi-level stacking trays (perfect for large families). Some premium air fryer gadgets even come with custom-sized trays designed specifically for certain models.</p><h2 id="">Top benefits of using an air fry tray</h2><p id="">Beyond just preventing soggy bottoms, these practical air fryer tools offer several advantages. They make cleaning easier by catching crumbs and grease, they allow you to cook different foods simultaneously without flavours mixing, and they protect your air fryer basket from scratches.</p><p id="">For those who love batch cooking, stacking trays effectively double your air fryer's capacity. This is especially handy when preparing multiple components for meals from our <a href="https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes" id="">recipe collection</a>. Whether you're cooking shrimp, salmon, or veggies, the right tray makes all the difference.</p><h3 id="">Choosing the best air fry tray</h3><p id="">Look for trays with the right diameter for your model (measure your basket first), sturdy construction, and adequate perforation for airflow. Many of the best air fryer accessories come with handy features like foldable edges or silicone grips for easy handling when hot.</p><h2 id="">Creative ways to use your air fry tray</h2><p id="">Beyond its obvious uses, an air fry tray can become your secret weapon in the kitchen. Use it to keep smaller items like nuts or herbs from falling through the basket, as a drying rack for washed fruits, or even as a makeshift steamer when lined with parchment. The team at <a href="https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk" id="">airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> particularly recommends trays for cooking delicate fish like in our <a href="https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/salmon" id="">salmon recipes</a>.</p><p id="">Some innovative cooks even use their trays as portion dividers when meal prepping, or as cooling racks for freshly baked goods. With a good quality air fry tray, you'll wonder how you ever managed without one - it's easily one of the most versatile air fryer gifts you could receive.</p><h3 id="">Caring for your air fry tray</h3><p id="">Most trays are dishwasher safe, but hand washing preserves their finish longer. Avoid using metal utensils that could scratch non-stick surfaces.

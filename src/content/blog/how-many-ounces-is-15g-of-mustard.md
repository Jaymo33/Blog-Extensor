<p>15 grams of mustard equals approximately 0.53 ounces. Whether you're preparing a glaze for air-fried chicken or mixing a marinade, knowing this conversion ensures your recipes turn out perfectly every time. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we understand how crucial precise measurements are for cooking success, especially when using an air fryer.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of ingredients can make or break your dish. Too much mustard in a marinade might overpower the flavours, while too little could leave your meal tasting bland. Air fryers cook food quickly and efficiently, so precise measurements ensure even cooking and balanced taste.

<h3>How to Measure Mustard Without a Scale</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a kitchen scale, you can still measure 15g of mustard using common household items. One level tablespoon of mustard is roughly 15g, but this can vary slightly depending on the mustard's thickness. For sticky or coarse mustards, it’s best to use a scale for accuracy.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for Mustard in Air Fryer Recipes</h2>  
<p>Mustard adds a tangy kick to many air fryer dishes, from glazed salmon to crispy potatoes. A 15g (0.53 oz) portion is often enough for a marinade or sauce serving two people. For inspiration, browse our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipes</a>, where mustard is a popular ingredient.</p>  

<p>Mustard also works as a binder for coatings, helping breadcrumbs stick to air-fried foods like chicken tenders or fish fillets. If you're new to air frying, start with simple recipes and gradually experiment with bolder flavours like mustard-based glazes.</p>  

<h3>Storing Mustard for Freshness</h3>  
<p>To keep mustard fresh, store it in a cool, dark place before opening and in the fridge afterward. A 15g portion is a small amount, so if you're using it sparingly, consider transferring it to an airtight container to maintain its flavour.

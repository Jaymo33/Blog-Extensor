<h2>Gas Mark 1 to Celsius Conversion</h2>
<p>Gas Mark 1 converts to 140°C, making it one of the lowest oven temperatures for gentle cooking. This temperature is perfect for slow-roasting vegetables or keeping dishes warm in your air fryer. Many traditional British recipes still reference Gas Marks, so knowing this conversion is essential. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we recommend reducing cooking times by 20% when converting oven recipes. The precise heat control of modern air fryers makes them ideal for low-temperature cooking.</p>

<p>When converting Gas Mark 1 to Celsius for air fryer use, remember these units represent the same heat intensity. The main difference comes from how air fryers circulate heat more efficiently than conventional ovens. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> shows how to adjust various oven temperatures. For delicate dishes like custards or slow-cooked meats, 140°C provides gentle, even heating. Always preheat your air fryer for 3 minutes when cooking at Gas Mark 1 equivalent temperatures.</p>

<h3>Why Gas Mark 1 Matters for Air Fryers</h3>
<p>Gas Mark 1 (140°C) is particularly useful for dehydrating fruits or making jerky in your air fryer. The low temperature prevents burning while slowly removing moisture. Many air fryer models have specific dehydration settings that match this temperature range. When adapting family recipes that use Gas Mark 1, you'll achieve better results by understanding the Celsius equivalent. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert recipes</a> for ideas using this gentle heat setting.</p>

<h2>Cooking Techniques at 140°C</h2>
<p>At Gas Mark 1 equivalent (140°C), your air fryer excels at slow-cooking techniques. This temperature perfectly renders fat in duck confit or breaks down collagen in cheaper cuts of meat. Unlike conventional ovens, air fryers maintain this low temperature more consistently. The rapid air circulation prevents hot spots that could overcook delicate items. For best results, use a meat thermometer when cooking proteins at this temperature.</p>

<p>Baking at Gas Mark 1 to Celsius conversion (140°C) requires some adjustments. Cakes and biscuits need longer cooking times but develop exceptional texture. The <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> team recommends checking items every 5 minutes when first trying a recipe. This temperature also works wonderfully for proofing dough or reviving stale bread. Remember that air fryer baskets cook faster than oven shelves, so reduce quantities accordingly.</p>

<h3>Temperature Comparison Guide</h3>
<p>Gas Mark 1 sits at the lower end of the temperature spectrum, equivalent to 140°C or 285°F. In fan ovens, you'd typically reduce this by 10-20°C, but air fryers behave differently. Their intense airflow means you should use the standard Gas Mark 1 to Celsius conversion without reduction. For perfect <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/potatoes>roast potatoes</a>, start at 140°C to render fat before crisping at higher heat. Always refer to your specific model's manual as some vary in temperature calibration.</p>

<h2>Common Uses for Gas Mark 1 Equivalent</h2>
<p>Many classic British dishes rely on Gas Mark 1 temperatures for perfect results. In your air fryer, this translates to 140°C - ideal for slow-cooked casseroles or meltingly tender pulled pork. The low heat gently cooks eggs for custards or baked cheesecakes without curdling. When using your air fryer for these applications, consider using foil or parchment to prevent over-browning. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning guide</a> shows how to maintain your appliance after slow cooking.</p>

<p>Dehydrating at Gas Mark 1 equivalent (140°C) creates perfect fruit leathers or herb drying. The air fryer's circulation removes moisture faster than conventional ovens at this temperature. For jerky, slice meat thinly and rotate trays every 30 minutes. Vegetables like tomatoes develop intense flavour when slow-roasted at 140°C. Always leave the basket slightly ajar when dehydrating to allow moisture escape.</p>

<h3>Troubleshooting Low Temperature Cooking</h3>
<p>If foods aren't cooking properly at Gas Mark 1 equivalent (140°C), first verify your air fryer's temperature accuracy. Some models run hot or cold, requiring adjustment. For even cooking at low temperatures, shake or turn food more frequently than at higher heats. When converting traditional recipes, remember air fryers don't have the same thermal mass as ovens, so they cool faster when adding food. Preheat thoroughly and avoid overcrowding the basket for best results.</p>

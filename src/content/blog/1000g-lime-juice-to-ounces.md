<h2>How to measure 1000g of lime juice accurately</h2>  
<p>Using a digital kitchen scale is the easiest way to measure 1000g of lime juice. Simply place your container on the scale, tare it to zero, and pour the juice until you hit 1000g. If you don’t have a scale, 1000g roughly equals 4 cups (950ml) of lime juice, but this can vary slightly depending on the juice’s density. For best results, stick to weight measurements.</p>  

<h3>Converting 1000g lime juice to fluid ounces</h3>  
<p>While 1000g of lime juice is 35.27 ounces by weight, fluid ounces measure volume. Lime juice’s density means 1000g is roughly 33.8 fluid ounces. This distinction matters in recipes where liquid volume is critical, such as soups or cocktails. Always check whether your recipe calls for weight or volume measurements.</p>  

<h2>Using lime juice in air fryer recipes</h2>  
<p>Lime juice adds brightness to air-fried dishes like shrimp, chicken, or vegetables. For example, a 1000g batch of lime juice could be used to marinate several portions of <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>air fryer chicken</a>. The acidity also helps tenderise meats and balance rich flavours. Remember to pat proteins dry before air frying to avoid excess moisture.</p>  

<p>If you’re experimenting with <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>air fryer desserts</a>, lime juice can elevate cakes or tarts. A 1000g quantity would be enough for multiple batches, so store any unused juice in the fridge.

<h3>Storing leftover lime juice</h3>  
<p>If you don’t use all 1000g of lime juice at once, transfer it to an airtight container and refrigerate for up to a week. For longer storage, freeze the juice in ice cube trays—each cube holds about 30g (1 oz), making future measurements a breeze.</p>

<p>1.5 cups of plain flour equals approximately 6.35 ounces. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements can make or break your dish. Whether you're baking cakes or coating chicken, knowing the exact weight ensures consistency. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we emphasise accuracy to help you achieve perfect results every time.</p>

<h2>Why accurate flour measurements matter</h2>
<p>Using the correct amount of flour is crucial for air fryer recipes. Too much flour can make your baked goods dense, while too little may cause them to fall apart. For example, if you're making air fryer cookies from our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipes</a> section, 1.5 cups of plain flour (6.35 ounces) ensures the right texture. Precision is key, especially when converting between cups and ounces.</p>
<p>Many UK bakers prefer weighing ingredients for better accuracy. Cups can vary based on how you scoop the flour, but ounces provide a consistent measurement. This is particularly important for air fryer cooking, where even heat distribution relies on balanced ingredients. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more handy tips.</p>

<h2>How to measure 1.5 cups of plain flour</h2>
<p>To measure 1.5 cups of plain flour accurately, use the spoon-and-level method. Spoon the flour into the measuring cup without packing it down, then level it off with a knife. This avoids compacting the flour, which can lead to using more than needed. For 6.35 ounces, a kitchen scale is your best friend, especially for air fryer recipes like those in our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>cake category</a>.</p>

<h3>Using a kitchen scale</h3>
<p>A digital kitchen scale removes the guesswork when converting 1.5 cups of plain flour to ounces. Simply place your bowl on the scale, tare it to zero, and add flour until it reaches 6.35 ounces. This method is foolproof and ensures your air fryer dishes turn out perfectly every time.

<h2>Common mistakes when measuring flour</h2>
<p>One common mistake is scooping flour directly from the bag with the measuring cup. This compacts the flour, leading to more than 1.5 cups (and thus more than 6.35 ounces). Another error is tapping the cup to settle the flour, which also increases the amount. For air fryer cooking, these small differences can affect texture and cooking time.</p>
<p>Always fluff the flour with a fork before measuring to aerate it. This ensures a lighter, more accurate measurement. If you're unsure, refer to our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a> or use a scale. Proper measurements are the foundation of successful air fryer baking, whether you're making bread or coating fish from our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/white-fish>white fish recipes</a>.</p>

<h3>Adjusting for humidity</h3>
<p>Humidity can affect flour weight, making 1.5 cups slightly heavier or lighter than 6.35 ounces. In humid conditions, flour absorbs moisture and becomes denser. If your air fryer recipes aren't turning out as expected, consider weighing your flour instead of relying on cups. This is especially important for delicate bakes like soufflés or pastries.</p>

<h2>Converting other flour amounts</h2>
<p>Once you master converting 1.5 cups of plain flour to ounces (6.35 oz), you can apply the same principles to other measurements. For example, 1 cup of plain flour is roughly 4.23 ounces, while 2 cups equal about 8.47 ounces. These conversions are handy for scaling air fryer recipes up or down. Visit <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> for more measurement guides and recipe ideas.</p>
<p>Remember, different types of flour (like wholemeal or self-raising) may have slightly different weights. Always check specific conversions if you're substituting. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a> covers various ingredients to simplify your air fryer cooking.</p>

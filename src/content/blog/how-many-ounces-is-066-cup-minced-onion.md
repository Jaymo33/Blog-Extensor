<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air frying</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on precise ingredient quantities to deliver crispy, evenly cooked results. Using too much or too little minced onion can affect texture and taste.

If you're unsure about conversions, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a> includes detailed measurements for foolproof cooking.</p>  

<p>Minced onion is a staple in many air fryer recipes, from meatloaf to vegetable stir-fries. Measuring by weight (ounces) rather than volume (cups) eliminates guesswork. This is especially useful when scaling recipes up or down. For more tips on air fryer measurements, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable-focused recipes</a>.</p>  

<h3>How to measure 0.66 cup of minced onion</h3>  
<p>To measure 0.66 cup of minced onion, use a dry measuring cup and lightly pack the onion without compressing it. Alternatively, a kitchen scale provides the most accurate result—simply weigh out 2.64 oz. This method is ideal for recipes where consistency is key, such as air-fried onion rings or casseroles.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for minced onion in air fryers</h2>  
<p>Minced onion adds depth to countless air fryer dishes. From meatballs to veggie patties, 0.66 cup (2.64 oz) is a versatile quantity. It’s also a key ingredient in marinades and rubs for proteins like chicken or tofu. For inspiration, browse our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipes</a> featuring minced onion.</p>

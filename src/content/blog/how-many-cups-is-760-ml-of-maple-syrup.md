Whether you're making glazes, marinades, or sweet treats, knowing how to convert millilitres to cups ensures your dishes turn out perfectly every time.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of maple syrup can make or break a recipe. Too little, and your dish might lack sweetness or depth. Too much, and it could become overly sticky or cloying. For air fryer recipes, precise measurements are especially important because the cooking process is faster and more intense than traditional methods.</p>

<h2>How to Measure 760 ml of Maple Syrup</h2>  
<p>Measuring sticky ingredients like maple syrup can be tricky. To get an accurate 760 ml (3.2 cups), use a liquid measuring cup with clear markings. Lightly grease the cup with oil or cooking spray to help the syrup slide out easily. This prevents waste and ensures you're using the exact amount needed.</p>  
<p>For air fryer cooking, consider using a silicone liner to avoid sticky messes. Our guide on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner</a> can help keep your appliance in top shape.

<h3>UK vs. US Cup Measurements</h3>  
<p>It's worth noting that UK and US cup measurements differ slightly. In the UK, 1 cup is 284 ml, while in the US, it's 240 ml. For 760 ml of maple syrup, this means roughly 2.67 UK cups or 3.2 US cups. Always check which standard your recipe follows to avoid mistakes.</p>  

<h2>Using Maple Syrup in Air Fryer Recipes</h2>  
<p>Maple syrup works wonderfully in air fryer recipes, adding a rich, caramelised flavour. Try brushing it over salmon or chicken before cooking for a glossy, sweet finish. It also pairs well with roasted vegetables like carrots or sweet potatoes, enhancing their natural sweetness.</p>  
<p>For dessert ideas, drizzle maple syrup over air-fried apples or pears. You can even use it in bakingâ€”our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>cake recipes</a> include several options that feature this delicious ingredient. Just remember to adjust cooking times slightly, as sugary glazes can brown faster in the air fryer.</p>  

<h3>Storing Leftover Maple Syrup</h3>  
<p>If you have leftover maple syrup after measuring out 760 ml, store it in an airtight container in the fridge. Proper storage keeps it fresh for months. For easy pouring, warm the syrup slightly before using it again in your next air fryer creation.</p>

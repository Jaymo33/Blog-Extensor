<p>0.25 cup of garlic paste equals approximately 2 ounces. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements can make or break a dish. Whether you're whipping up a marinade or seasoning your ingredients, knowing the exact weight ensures consistency. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we focus on helping you get the measurements right for perfect results every time.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Using the correct amount of garlic paste can significantly impact the flavour and texture of your dish. Too little, and your meal might lack depth; too much, and it could overpower other ingredients. Air fryers cook food quickly, so precise measurements ensure even distribution of flavours. For more tips on perfecting your air fryer recipes, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipes section</a>.</p>  

<p>Garlic paste is a staple in many cuisines, and its consistency can vary. Some brands are thicker, while others are more liquid, which might slightly affect the weight. However, 0.25 cup generally translates to 2 ounces, making it easy to follow recipes without a kitchen scale. If you're unsure, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> can help with other common measurements.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure Garlic Paste Without a Scale</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a kitchen scale, measuring spoons and cups can still give you accurate results. A standard US cup holds 8 fluid ounces, so 0.25 cup is a quarter of that. For garlic paste, this works out to roughly 2 ounces by weight. Remember, UK measurements are the same for volume, so this conversion applies whether you're using metric or imperial cups.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for Garlic Paste in Air Fryer Recipes</h2>  
<p>Garlic paste is incredibly versatile and works well in marinades, sauces, and rubs for air fryer dishes. From <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipes</a> to roasted vegetables, it adds a rich, savoury flavour. Since air fryers circulate hot air, the garlic paste caramelises beautifully, enhancing the taste of your meals.</p>  

<p>When using garlic paste in your air fryer, mix it with oil or other wet ingredients to prevent burning. A little goes a long way, so 0.25 cup (or 2 ounces) is often enough for a family-sized portion. For more inspiration, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable recipes</a>, where garlic paste is a star ingredient.</p>  

<h3>Storing Garlic Paste for Future Use</h3>  
<p>If you have leftover garlic paste, store it in an airtight container in the fridge for up to two weeks. You can also freeze it in ice cube trays for easy portioning. When you’re ready to use it, just thaw the required amount—0.25 cup (2 ounces) per batch—and you’re good to go.</p>  

<h2>Converting Other Garlic Paste Measurements</h2>  
<p>Need to adjust your recipe? Here’s a quick reference for common garlic paste conversions: 1 tablespoon is about 0.5 ounces, and 1 teaspoon is roughly 0.17 ounces. If you’re scaling up, 0.5 cup of garlic paste equals 4 ounces. For more conversions, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> has you covered.</p>  

<p>Garlic paste is a game-changer in air fryer cooking, offering convenience and intense flavour. Whether you’re making a quick weeknight dinner or meal prepping, knowing how to measure it correctly ensures delicious results.

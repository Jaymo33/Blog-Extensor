<p>4 tablespoons (tbsp) of molasses weigh approximately 85 grams (g). This conversion is essential for precise baking and cooking, especially when using an air fryer where measurements matter for perfect results. Whether you're making sticky gingerbread or a savoury glaze, knowing the exact weight ensures consistency.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate molasses measurements matter</h2>  
<p>Molasses is a thick, sticky sweetener that can vary slightly in density depending on the brand and type. Measuring by weight (grams) rather than volume (tablespoons) ensures accuracy, especially in air fryer recipes where even small deviations can affect texture and cooking time. For example, too much molasses in a marinade might make it overly sticky, while too little could leave your dish lacking depth.</p>  
<p>At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we recommend using a kitchen scale for the most reliable results. If you don’t have one, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> can help you switch between volume and weight measurements effortlessly.</p>  

<h2>How to measure molasses without a scale</h2>  
<p>If you don’t have a scale, you can still measure 4 tbsp of molasses accurately. Use a proper tablespoon measure, levelling it off with a knife for precision. Molasses is sticky, so lightly greasing the spoon with oil can help it slide out easily. Remember, 4 tbsp equals 85 grams, so adjust your recipe accordingly.</p>  

<h3>Types of molasses and their weights</h3>  
<p>Not all molasses are the same. Light molasses is thinner, while blackstrap is thicker and denser. For most recipes, 4 tbsp of standard molasses weighs 85g, but blackstrap may be slightly heavier. Always check your recipe for specifics, especially if you're adapting it for air frying.</p>  

<h2>Using molasses in air fryer recipes</h2>  
<p>Molasses adds rich flavour to air fryer dishes like glazed meats, baked beans, or even desserts. Its sticky consistency helps coatings adhere, making it great for crispy wings or ribs. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>molasses-based recipes</a> for inspiration.</p>  
<p>When substituting molasses in air fryer recipes, remember that its moisture content can affect cooking times. If you're converting a traditional oven recipe, reduce the temperature slightly and keep an eye on doneness.</p>  

<h3>Storing molasses for long-term use</h3>  
<p>Molasses lasts for years if stored properly. Keep it in a cool, dark place, and ensure the lid is tightly sealed to prevent drying. If it crystallises, gently warm the jar in hot water to restore its smooth texture.</p>  

<h2>Common conversions for molasses</h2>  
<p>Beyond 4 tbsp, here are other useful molasses conversions: 1 tbsp = 21g, 1 cup = 340g. These are handy when scaling recipes up or down for your air fryer. For more conversions, visit our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion guide</a>.</p>  

<h3>Cleaning molasses residue from your air fryer</h3>  
<p>Molasses can leave sticky residues. To clean your air fryer after using molasses, wipe it down while still warm with a damp cloth. For stubborn spots, use our recommended <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner</a>.</p>

<p>0.5 tbsp of wholemeal flour weighs approximately 4 grams. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precision ensures perfect texture and consistency. Whether you're baking muffins, bread, or coating ingredients, knowing the exact weight of your flour can make or break your dish.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Flour Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Baking is a science, and even small deviations in flour measurements can affect your results. Too much flour can make your air fryer creations dense and dry, while too little can leave them crumbly. Wholemeal flour, in particular, has a slightly different density compared to plain flour, so conversions like 0.5 tbsp to grams are crucial.

<p>Using a digital scale is the most reliable way to measure flour, as scooping with a tablespoon can vary based on how tightly packed it is. If you don’t have a scale, fluffing the flour before spooning it into the tablespoon can help.

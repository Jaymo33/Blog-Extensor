<h2>Why Convert 10g of Icing Sugar to Ounces?</h2>
<p>Many UK recipes use grams, while others rely on ounces, making conversions a common kitchen task. If you’re baking in an air fryer, precision is key to avoid dry or overly sweet results. Converting 10g of icing sugar to ounces (0.35 oz) helps maintain consistency, whether you’re dusting desserts or mixing batters.</p>
<p>For example, if you’re making air fryer cookies from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>our recipe collection</a>, accurate measurements ensure the right texture and sweetness. A digital scale can simplify the process, but knowing the conversion saves time if you’re using measuring cups.</p>

<h2>How to Measure 10g of Icing Sugar Without a Scale</h2>
<p>If you don’t have a scale, you can use volume measurements to approximate 10g of icing sugar. One tablespoon of icing sugar typically weighs around 8g, so 1.25 tablespoons will give you roughly 10g. However, this method isn’t as precise as weighing, so for best results, invest in a kitchen scale.</p>
<p>For air fryer baking, precision matters even more due to the appliance’s intense heat. Check out <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>our conversion chart</a> for other common baking measurements to streamline your cooking process.</p>

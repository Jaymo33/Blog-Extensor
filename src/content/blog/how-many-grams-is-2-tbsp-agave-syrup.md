<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>
<p>Air fryers rely on precise cooking times and temperatures, and ingredient measurements play a crucial role in achieving the best results. Using the correct weight for 2 tbsp of agave syrup ensures your recipes aren’t too sweet or too dry. For example, a glaze with too much syrup might burn, while too little won’t caramelise properly.

<p>Many air fryer recipes, especially desserts like cakes or cookies, require exact measurements to maintain texture and taste. Agave syrup is a popular sweetener due to its mild flavour and lower glycemic index, but its viscosity means volume measurements can vary. That’s why weighing 2 tbsp of agave syrup in grams is far more reliable than using spoons alone.</p>

<h2>How to measure 2 tbsp of agave syrup accurately</h2>
<p>To measure 2 tbsp of agave syrup in grams, a digital kitchen scale is your best friend. Simply place your measuring spoon on the scale, tare it to zero, then pour the syrup until it reaches 42 grams. This method eliminates guesswork and ensures consistency across all your <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a>.</p>

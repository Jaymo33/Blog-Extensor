<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on even cooking, and incorrect measurements can throw off texture and taste. Too much hot sauce might make your dish overly spicy, while too little could leave it bland. Measuring 2 tbsp of hot sauce in grams ensures consistency, especially for recipes like crispy wings or glazed tofu. If you’re new to air frying, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a> has plenty of ideas to get started.</p>  

<p>Hot sauce density can vary slightly by brand, but 30 grams is a reliable average. For thicker sauces like sriracha, it might be closer to 32 grams, while thinner varieties could be around 28 grams. Always adjust to taste, especially if you’re adapting a recipe from cups to grams.

<h3>How to Measure Hot Sauce Without a Scale</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a kitchen scale, use standard measuring spoons for accuracy. A UK tablespoon holds 15ml, so 2 tbsp equal 30ml, which roughly converts to 30 grams for most hot sauces. For sticky sauces, lightly grease the spoon to ensure it slides out cleanly. This trick works well for marinades in dishes like air-fried shrimp or tofu.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for 2 Tbsp of Hot Sauce</h2>  
<p>Two tablespoons of hot sauce can transform a simple meal. Mix it with melted butter for spicy air-fryer wings, or blend it into a glaze for salmon. It’s also perfect for adding a kick to roasted vegetables or homemade crisps.

<h3>Adjusting Recipes for Personal Taste</h3>

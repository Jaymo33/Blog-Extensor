<h2>Why Accurate Vinegar Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Vinegar plays a crucial role in balancing flavours, tenderising meats, and even cleaning your air fryer. Using too much or too little can alter the taste and texture of your dish. For example, 260 ml of vinegar in a marinade can be the difference between perfectly tangy chicken and an overpoweringly sour meal. If you're prepping a batch of <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>air fryer chicken recipes</a>, precise measurements ensure every bite is delicious.</p>  

<p>In baking, vinegar reacts with baking soda to create lift in cakes and cookies. A slight miscalculation—like using 1.5 cups instead of 1.1 cups (260 ml)—could affect the rise of your <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>air fryer cakes</a>. For consistent results, always measure liquids like vinegar carefully, especially when adapting recipes for air frying.</p>  

<h3>UK vs. US Cup Measurements</h3>  
<p>While 260 ml of vinegar converts to 1.1 UK cups, it’s roughly 1.09 US cups due to slight differences in cup sizes. This might seem negligible, but for recipes requiring precision, like pickling or dressings, it’s worth noting. If you’re following a US recipe, use 1.09 cups; for UK recipes, stick to 1.1 cups. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a> includes both UK and US measurements for hassle-free cooking.</p>  

<h2>How to Measure 260 ml of Vinegar Without a Scale</h2>  
<p>No measuring jug? No problem. A standard UK metric cup holds 250 ml, so 260 ml of vinegar is just over one cup (about a tablespoon extra). For US cups, fill to the 1-cup mark and add 2 teaspoons. Alternatively, use a 100 ml shot glass: 2.6 servings will give you 260 ml. This method works well for <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>air fryer vegetable recipes</a> where vinegar is used in dressings or glazes.</p>  

<p>For sticky ingredients like balsamic vinegar, lightly grease your measuring cup with oil to ensure every drop slides out. This trick saves waste and guarantees you’re using the full 260 ml.

<h3>Common Recipes Using 260 ml of Vinegar</h3>  
<p>260 ml of vinegar is a popular quantity in many dishes. It’s enough for a large batch of coleslaw dressing, a tangy pulled pork marinade, or pickling vegetables for <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/meal-prep>meal prep</a>. In air fryer cooking, it’s ideal for deglazing pans or creating shiny glazes for meats. Remember, white vinegar is milder than apple cider or malt vinegar, so adjust other seasonings accordingly.</p>

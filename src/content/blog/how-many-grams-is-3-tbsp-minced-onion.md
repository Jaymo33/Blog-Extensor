<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air frying</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on hot air circulation, so ingredient quantities directly impact cooking times and textures. Too much minced onion can lead to uneven browning, while too little might leave your dish lacking flavour. By converting 3 tbsp minced onion to grams, you ensure consistency every time. This is especially useful for batch cooking or following recipes from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>our collection</a>.</p>  

<p>Minced onion is a staple in many dishes, from savoury muffins to hearty casseroles. When using an air fryer, the dry heat intensifies flavours, making precise measurements crucial. A 30-gram portion of minced onion provides the right balance for most recipes without overpowering other ingredients.</p>  

<h3>How to measure minced onion correctly</h3>  
<p>For the most accurate 3 tbsp minced onion to grams conversion, use a kitchen scale. Scoop the minced onion lightly into your tablespoon without packing it down. Level off the top with a knife for consistency. If you don't have scales, remember that 1 tbsp of minced onion weighs roughly 10 grams.</p>  

<h2>Converting minced onion for different recipes</h2>  
<p>Whether you're making <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable dishes</a> or protein-based meals, the 3 tbsp minced onion to grams ratio remains constant. However, the preparation method may vary. For air-fried dishes, consider mixing the minced onion with a small amount of oil to prevent drying out.</p>  

<p>Some recipes may call for dried minced onion instead of fresh. In this case, 3 tablespoons equals about 15 grams as dried onion is more concentrated. Always check whether your recipe specifies fresh or dried to avoid measurement errors.

<h3>Common uses for 3 tbsp minced onion</h3>  
<p>Thirty grams of minced onion perfectly seasons two portions of air-fried chicken or fish. It's also ideal for flavouring homemade burger patties or meatballs cooked in the air fryer. For vegetarian options, try adding it to <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/tofu>tofu dishes</a> before air frying for extra depth.</p>  

<h2>Storing minced onion for future use</h2>  
<p>If you've minced more onion than needed, store the remainder in an airtight container. Three tablespoons (30 grams) of minced onion freezes well for up to 3 months. Portion it into ice cube trays with a little water or oil for easy future use in air fryer recipes.</p>  

<p>When defrosting frozen minced onion, remember that it may release more water during cooking. Adjust your air fryer temperature slightly lower and extend the cooking time by a few minutes. This prevents sogginess in dishes like air-fried fritters or stuffed mushrooms.</p>  

<h3>Alternative measurements for minced onion</h3>  
<p>If you need smaller quantities, 1 tbsp minced onion equals 10 grams, while half a tablespoon is 5 grams. For larger batches, 6 tbsp equals 60 grams. These conversions help scale recipes up or down while maintaining the right flavour balance in your air fryer creations.</p>

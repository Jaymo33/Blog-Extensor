<p>Yes, you can put glass in an air fryer, but only if it's borosilicate or tempered glass specifically rated for high temperatures. Regular drinking glasses or bakeware often can't handle the rapid heating and may shatter. At airfryerrecipe.co.uk, we always recommend checking manufacturer guidelines before attempting to use any glass in your appliance.</p>

<h2>Understanding Glass Types for Air Fryers</h2>
<p>Not all glass is created equal when it comes to air fryer safety. Borosilicate glass, like Pyrex, can typically withstand temperatures up to 300°C, making it suitable for most air frying. Tempered glass is another option, but always verify its heat resistance. Many UK households have glassware that looks sturdy but isn't designed for the intense, direct heat of an air fryer.</p>
<p>When browsing our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a>, you'll notice we rarely recommend glass unless specified. The rapid temperature changes in air fryers create thermal shock that can crack ordinary glass. Even preheating your air fryer with glass inside requires caution - always place it in a cold appliance and let it heat gradually.</p>

<h3>Why Most Glass Isn't Air Fryer Safe</h3>
<p>Standard soda-lime glass (used in most drinkware) has poor thermal shock resistance. When exposed to sudden temperature changes above 60°C difference, stress fractures form. Air fryers cycle between high heat and cooling rapidly during cooking, creating perfect conditions for glass to shatter. This is why we suggest using metal or ceramic alternatives from our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a> when adapting oven recipes.</p>

<h2>Safe Practices for Using Glass in Air Fryers</h2>
<p>If you must use glass, select pieces specifically marked as oven-safe or air fryer-safe. Never use glass with cracks, chips, or manufacturing defects. Always place glass containers on the air fryer tray or basket - never directly on the heating element. Leave adequate space around the glass for air circulation, about 2-3cm from all sides.</p>
<p>For those cooking <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>air fryer desserts</a> in glass ramekins, reduce temperatures by 10-15°C compared to metal pans. Glass heats slower but retains heat longer, which can lead to overcooking. Monitor food closely during the last few minutes, as glass cookware continues cooking even after removal due to residual heat.</p>

<h3>What Happens When Glass Breaks in an Air Fryer?</h3>
<p>If glass shatters during use, immediately unplug the appliance and let it cool completely before attempting cleanup. Shards can damage the heating element or fan, and tiny fragments may remain in crevices. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning guide</a> shows how to thoroughly sanitize after glass breakage to prevent food contamination.</p>

<h2>Best Alternatives to Glass in Air Fryers</h2>
<p>Silicone and stainless steel containers are generally safer choices for air frying. Many UK supermarkets now stock affordable air fryer-safe metal pans that distribute heat more evenly than glass. For baking, consider parchment paper or silicone liners instead of glass dishes when preparing <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>air fryer cakes</a>.</p>
<p>Ceramic dishes rated for high heat can sometimes substitute for glass, but check their maximum temperature rating first. Unlike glass, ceramics typically handle thermal shock better but may require longer cooking times. Always preheat ceramic dishes with the air fryer to prevent cracking from sudden temperature changes.</p>

<p>0.33 cup of rice flour equals approximately 1.5 ounces (oz). This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements ensure the best texture and consistency. Whether you’re baking gluten-free treats or coating ingredients for frying, knowing the exact weight of rice flour makes all the difference.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Using the correct amount of rice flour ensures your air fryer recipes turn out perfectly every time. Too much flour can make coatings clumpy, while too little might not provide enough crispiness. For example, if you’re making air-fried chicken or crispy tofu, 0.33 cup of rice flour (1.5 oz) is often the ideal amount for a light, even coating.</p>  

<p>Rice flour is a popular choice for gluten-free cooking, and its weight can vary slightly depending on how it’s packed. Scooping versus spooning the flour into the measuring cup can affect the final weight, so weighing it in ounces removes any guesswork. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more handy measurement tips.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure 0.33 Cup of Rice Flour Correctly</h3>  
<p>For the most accurate measurement, use a kitchen scale to weigh 1.5 oz of rice flour. If you don’t have one, lightly spoon the flour into a measuring cup and level it off with a knife. Avoid packing the flour down, as this can lead to using more than needed. This method ensures consistency, especially for delicate recipes like air fryer cookies or cakes.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for 0.33 Cup of Rice Flour in Air Fryer Recipes</h2>  
<p>Rice flour is incredibly versatile in air fryer cooking. From crispy coatings to gluten-free baking, 0.33 cup (1.5 oz) is a common measurement in many recipes. For example, it’s perfect for dusting shrimp before air frying or mixing into batter for onion rings. You’ll find plenty of inspiration in our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> collection.</p>  

<p>Another great use is in gluten-free baking. If you’re making air fryer muffins or pancakes, 0.33 cup of rice flour provides the right structure without gluten. Pair it with other gluten-free flours for the best results, and always check your measurements to avoid dense or crumbly textures.</p>  

<h3>Converting Other Rice Flour Measurements</h3>  
<p>If your recipe calls for a different amount of rice flour, here’s a quick reference: 1 cup of rice flour is roughly 4.5 oz, while ½ cup is about 2.25 oz. These conversions are handy when scaling recipes up or down. For more precise measurements, always use a digital scale—especially when working with gluten-free ingredients.</p>  

<h2>Tips for Storing and Using Rice Flour in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Rice flour has a longer shelf life than wheat flour, but it’s best stored in an airtight container in a cool, dry place. If you use it frequently, consider buying in bulk and storing it properly to maintain freshness. When measuring 0.33 cup (1.5 oz), ensure your flour hasn’t clumped, as this can throw off your measurements.</p>

Whether you’re making tempura vegetables or gluten-free chicken tenders, 0.33 cup (1.5 oz) of rice flour is a great starting point. Experiment with different recipes to find your perfect balance.</p>

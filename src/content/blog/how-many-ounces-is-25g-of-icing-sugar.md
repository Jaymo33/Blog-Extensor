<p>25g of icing sugar equals approximately 0.88 ounces. If you're baking in your air fryer and need precise measurements, this conversion ensures your recipes turn out perfectly every time. Whether you're dusting desserts or making frosting, knowing how to convert grams to ounces is essential for accuracy.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer baking</h2>  
<p>Baking in an air fryer requires precision, especially when working with ingredients like icing sugar. Too much or too little can affect texture and taste. For example, if you're making air fryer cookies or cakes, the right amount of icing sugar ensures the perfect sweetness and consistency. Visit <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes</a> for inspiration on how to use icing sugar in your air fryer creations.</p>  

<p>Measuring 25g of icing sugar to ounces is straightforward, but using a digital scale is always best for accuracy. If you don't have one, a conversion chart can help. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more handy measurements.</p>  

<h3>How to measure 25g of icing sugar without scales</h3>  
<p>If you don't have scales, you can use a measuring spoon or cup to estimate 25g of icing sugar. One tablespoon of icing sugar is roughly 10g, so 2.5 tablespoons will give you close to 25g. However, for baking, especially in an air fryer, weighing ingredients is always more reliable.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for 25g of icing sugar in air fryer recipes</h2>  
<p>Icing sugar is a versatile ingredient in air fryer baking. From dusting doughnuts to making glazes, 25g is often the perfect amount for small batches. If you're making air fryer cakes or cookies, this quantity is ideal for a light, sweet finish without overpowering the dish.</p>  

<p>For more ideas on how to use icing sugar in your air fryer, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert recipes</a>. You'll find everything from air fryer brownies to mini cheesecakes, all requiring precise measurements for the best results.</p>  

<h3>Converting other sugar measurements for air fryer baking</h3>  
<p>If you're working with different quantities, it's helpful to know that 100g of icing sugar equals about 3.5 ounces. This makes scaling recipes up or down much easier. Whether you're baking for one or a crowd, accurate conversions ensure consistency in every batch.</p>  

<h2>Tips for storing icing sugar for air fryer recipes</h2>  
<p>To keep your icing sugar fresh and clump-free, store it in an airtight container. Humidity can cause it to harden, making it difficult to measure 25g accurately. If your sugar does clump, sift it before use to ensure smooth, even distribution in your air fryer recipes.</p>

<p>1.25 cups of icing sugar is approximately 150 grams. This conversion is essential for baking, especially when using an air fryer for desserts like cakes or cookies. Precise measurements ensure your recipes turn out perfectly every time.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Baking is a science, and even small measurement discrepancies can affect texture and taste. Whether you're making air fryer cupcakes or dusting desserts, knowing the exact grams for 1.25 cups of icing sugar ensures consistency. Too much sugar can make treats overly sweet, while too little may affect structure.</p>  

<p>At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we emphasise precision for flawless results. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> helps streamline your baking process, so you spend less time calculating and more time enjoying delicious treats.</p>  

<h3>UK vs. US Cup Measurements</h3>  
<p>It's worth noting that cup sizes differ slightly between the UK and US. A UK cup holds 250ml, while a US cup is 240ml. For icing sugar, this minor difference doesn’t drastically alter the gram conversion, but it’s good practice to stick to one system for consistency.</p>  

<h2>How to Measure Icing Sugar Correctly</h2>  
<p>For the most accurate results, use a kitchen scale. Scooping icing sugar directly from the bag can lead to packed cups, resulting in more sugar than intended. Instead, spoon the sugar lightly into the measuring cup and level it off with a knife.</p>  

<p>If you're adapting recipes from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>our collection</a>, weighing ingredients eliminates guesswork. This method is particularly useful for air fryer baking, where even heat distribution relies on balanced mixtures.</p>  

<h3>Common Uses for 1.25 Cups of Icing Sugar</h3>  
<p>This amount is perfect for frosting a small cake, making buttercream, or dusting desserts like doughnuts. If you're experimenting with <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>air fryer cakes</a>, precise sugar measurements ensure the right sweetness and texture.</p>  

<h2>Converting Other Sugar Amounts</h2>

<h3>Storing Icing Sugar for Freshness</h3>  
<p>To prevent clumping, store icing sugar in an airtight container in a cool, dry place. Humidity can cause it to harden, making measuring tricky. Proper storage ensures your sugar stays fluffy and easy to work with for future bakes.</p>

<h3>How to Measure 475 Grams of Pasta Without Scales</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a kitchen scale, you can still measure 475 grams of pasta using cups. A standard UK cup holds about 100 grams of dried pasta, so 4.75 cups will give you roughly 475 grams. For smaller shapes like macaroni, fill the cup lightly to avoid packing too tightly. Larger shapes, like fusilli, may require slightly more cups to reach 475 grams. Always fluff the pasta in the cup for an accurate measurement.</p>  

<h2>Converting 475 Grams of Pasta for Different Recipes</h2>  
<p>Whether you’re making a pasta bake or air-fried noodles, converting 475 grams of pasta to cups is simple. For baked dishes, 4.75 cups of dried pasta will yield plenty for four servings. If you’re cooking spaghetti, 475 grams equals about five cups when loosely packed. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/potatoes>potato-based recipes</a> for side dish inspiration. Remember, cooked pasta doubles in volume, so adjust your measurements accordingly.</p>  

<p>For air fryer pasta dishes, 475 grams of pasta is ideal for crispy, golden results. Spread the pasta evenly in the air fryer basket to ensure even cooking. If you’re adding sauces or toppings, reduce the quantity slightly to prevent overcrowding. For cleaning tips after cooking, see our guide on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer maintenance</a>. With the right measurements, your pasta dishes will turn out perfectly every time.</p>  

<h3>Common Mistakes When Measuring Pasta</h3>  
<p>One of the biggest mistakes is packing pasta too tightly into the cup, which leads to inaccurate measurements. For 475 grams of pasta, lightly fill the cup and level it off for consistency. Another error is ignoring pasta shape—long strands like linguine take up more space than small shells. Always check the packaging for weight-to-cup conversions if unsure. With these tips, converting 475 grams of pasta to cups becomes effortless.</p>

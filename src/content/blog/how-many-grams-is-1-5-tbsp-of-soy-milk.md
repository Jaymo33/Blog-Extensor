<p>1.5 tablespoons (tbsp) of soy milk weighs approximately 22.5 grams. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements can make or break your dish. Whether you’re whipping up a cake or a savoury sauce, knowing the exact weight ensures consistency and perfect results every time.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on even heat distribution, and incorrect ingredient quantities can lead to uneven cooking or texture issues. For example, using too much liquid like soy milk in a batter can make it too runny, while too little might dry it out. That’s why converting 1.5 tbsp of soy milk to grams (22.5g) is so helpful—it takes the guesswork out of measuring.</p>  

<p>If you’re working with other ingredients, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for quick reference. It covers everything from flour to oils, making recipe adjustments a breeze. For more inspiration, browse our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> collection, where precision meets flavour.</p>  

<h3>How to measure soy milk correctly</h3>  
<p>For the most accurate results, use a digital kitchen scale to weigh your soy milk. If you don’t have one, ensure your tablespoon is levelled off—no heaping scoops! This is especially important for baking, where even small discrepancies can affect the final product. Keep in mind that 1.5 tbsp of soy milk equals 22.5 grams, a handy figure to remember.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for soy milk in air fryer recipes</h2>  
<p>Soy milk is a versatile ingredient in air fryer cooking, often used in vegan baking, batters, and marinades. For instance, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>air fryer cake recipes</a> frequently call for plant-based milk alternatives like soy milk. Its neutral flavour and creamy texture make it a great substitute for dairy.</p>  

<p>Another popular use is in crispy coatings—think tofu or vegetable fritters. The 1.5 tbsp (22.5g) measurement ensures the right consistency for dipping. If you’re experimenting, always clean your air fryer afterward with our recommended <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning tips</a> to maintain performance.</p>  

<h3>Converting other soy milk quantities</h3>  
<p>Need to adjust your recipe? Here’s a quick guide: 1 tbsp of soy milk is roughly 15 grams, while 2 tbsp equal 30 grams. Scaling up or down is simple once you know the base conversion.

<p>135 ml of lemon juice equals approximately 0.57 cups (just over half a cup). This conversion is essential for baking, cooking, or preparing marinades in your air fryer. Whether you're following a recipe from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> or improvising, knowing this measurement ensures accuracy.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Precision is key when working with lemon juice, especially in air fryer recipes. Too much acidity can overpower a dish, while too little might leave it lacking flavour. For example, if you're making a lemon drizzle cake in your air fryer, 135 ml of lemon juice (0.57 cups) is the perfect amount for a balanced taste. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> for more inspiration.</p>  

<p>Lemon juice also plays a crucial role in marinades for chicken or fish. A precise 135 ml (0.57 cups) ensures the right level of tanginess without making the meat too sour. If you're preparing a citrus-glazed salmon, this measurement will help you nail the recipe every time.</p>  

<h2>Converting 135 ml of Lemon Juice to Cups</h2>  
<p>Converting millilitres to cups can be tricky, especially since cup sizes vary between the UK and the US. In the UK, 1 cup is typically 250 ml, while in the US, it's 240 ml. For 135 ml of lemon juice, the conversion is roughly 0.57 cups in the UK and 0.56 cups in the US. This small difference usually won’t affect your air fryer cooking, but it’s good to be aware of.</p>  

<h3>Using a Measuring Cup</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a metric measuring jug, use a standard cup and fill it just over halfway for 135 ml of lemon juice. For more precise conversions, refer to our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> to avoid mistakes in your cooking.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for 135 ml of Lemon Juice</h2>  
<p>This measurement is often used in dressings, desserts, and marinades. For instance, a lemon vinaigrette for an air-fried chicken salad might call for 135 ml (0.57 cups) of lemon juice. Similarly, a lemon curd for desserts requires precise acidity, making this conversion invaluable.</p>  

<p>If you're baking lemon cookies or a citrus-infused cake in your air fryer, 135 ml of lemon juice provides the perfect balance of flavour. Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert recipes</a> for more sweet and tangy ideas.</p>  

<h3>Adjusting Recipes for Different Quantities</h3>  
<p>Sometimes, you might need to scale a recipe up or down. If a dish requires 270 ml of lemon juice, simply double the 135 ml measurement to 1.14 cups. Conversely, halving it would mean using 67.5 ml (about 0.28 cups). Keeping these conversions handy saves time and ensures consistency.</p>  

<h2>Tips for Measuring Lemon Juice</h2>  
<p>Freshly squeezed lemon juice is best for flavour, but bottled works in a pinch. To measure 135 ml accurately, use a liquid measuring cup rather than dry cups. If you’re using an air fryer for meal prep, consider pre-measuring ingredients like lemon juice to streamline cooking.</p>  

<p>For cleaning your air fryer after cooking with lemon juice, check out our guide on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner</a> to keep it in top condition. Lemon juice can leave residues, so proper maintenance is key.</p>

<h3>How to Measure Crushed Garlic Correctly</h3>

Remember, fresh garlic delivers the best flavour for air fryer dishes.</p>

<h3>Converting Other Garlic Measurements</h3>  
<p>If your recipe calls for minced or whole garlic cloves, the weight will differ. One medium garlic clove weighs about 3-7g, so 125g would be roughly 18-42 cloves. Minced garlic is slightly denser than crushed, so adjust accordingly. Always double-check conversions for the best results.</p>

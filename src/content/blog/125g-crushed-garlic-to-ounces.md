<p>125g of crushed garlic equals approximately 4.41 ounces. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes, where precise measurements can make or break a dish. Whether you're whipping up garlic-infused chicken or a flavourful vegetable stir-fry, knowing the exact weight ensures consistency. For more handy conversions, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on even cooking, and incorrect measurements can lead to uneven results. Too much garlic might overpower your dish, while too little could leave it bland. Crushed garlic, in particular, has a unique density, making weight conversions crucial. If you're prepping a recipe like garlic butter shrimp or roasted potatoes, precision is key. Visit <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>our recipe collection</a> for inspiration.</p>  

<p>Many UK cooks prefer using grams, while others work in ounces. Converting 125g of crushed garlic to ounces ensures you follow recipes correctly, whether they're from British or international sources. This small detail can elevate your cooking from good to great. For more tips, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable recipes</a>.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure Crushed Garlic Correctly</h3>  
<p>Crushed garlic can be tricky to measure due to its sticky texture. Using a digital kitchen scale is the most accurate method. Simply tare your scale with the container, then add garlic until it hits 125g. If you don't have a scale, 125g is roughly 4 heaped tablespoons. Remember, fresh garlic delivers the best flavour for air fryer dishes.</p>  

<h2>Common Recipes Using 125g of Crushed Garlic</h2>  
<p>From garlic bread to marinades, 125g of crushed garlic is a versatile ingredient. Try it in air-fryer garlic mushrooms or a creamy garlic dip. The strong flavour pairs well with meats, veggies, and even tofu. For a full list of ideas, browse our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipes</a>.</p>  

<p>If you're meal prepping, 125g of crushed garlic can be portioned and frozen for later use. This saves time and ensures you always have fresh garlic on hand. Just remember to label your containers with the weight to avoid confusion.

<h3>Converting Other Garlic Measurements</h3>  
<p>If your recipe calls for minced or whole garlic cloves, the weight will differ. One medium garlic clove weighs about 3-7g, so 125g would be roughly 18-42 cloves. Minced garlic is slightly denser than crushed, so adjust accordingly. Always double-check conversions for the best results.</p>

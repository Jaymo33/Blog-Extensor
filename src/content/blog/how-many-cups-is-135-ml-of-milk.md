<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>
<p>When using an air fryer, precise measurements like 135 ml of milk in cups can affect texture and cooking time. Too much liquid can lead to soggy results, while too little might dry out your dish. For example, if you're making air fryer pancakes or a batter-based recipe, getting the 135 ml to cups conversion right ensures fluffy, even results.</p>
<p>Many air fryer recipes, like those on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, rely on balanced wet and dry ingredients. A slight miscalculation with 135 ml of milk could throw off the entire dish. That’s why understanding conversions like 135 ml milk to cups is so important for consistent, delicious outcomes.</p>

<h2>How to Measure 135 ml of Milk Without a Measuring Cup</h2>

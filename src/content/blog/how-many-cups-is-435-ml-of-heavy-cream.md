<p>435 ml of heavy cream is approximately 1.84 cups.

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>

<h3>How to Measure Heavy Cream Correctly</h3>  
<p>For the most accurate results, use a liquid measuring cup rather than dry measuring cups. Heavy cream’s thickness means it can cling to the sides, so pour slowly and check at eye level. If you’re preparing a dish like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>air fryer cakes</a>, precise measurements ensure the batter rises evenly.</p>

For instance, a <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>creamy garlic pasta</a> might call for 435 ml of heavy cream to achieve the right consistency. Always adjust seasoning and cooking times based on your air fryer model.</p>  

<p>If you’re reheating a dish with heavy cream, like a soup or casserole, avoid overheating as it can separate.

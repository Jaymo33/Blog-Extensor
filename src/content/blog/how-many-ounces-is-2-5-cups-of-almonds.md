Whether you're whipping up a batch of almond-crusted chicken or a healthy snack, knowing the exact weight ensures perfect results every time.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Almond Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Precision is key when working with almonds, especially in air fryer recipes where even small deviations can affect texture and cooking time.

<p>Almonds come in different forms—whole, sliced, or slivered—which can slightly alter the weight per cup. However, 2.5 cups of whole almonds generally weigh around 10.5 ounces. If you're using sliced almonds, the weight might vary by a small margin, so always check your recipe notes.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure Almonds Correctly</h3>  
<p>For the most accurate conversion of 2.5 cups of almonds to ounces, use a kitchen scale. Scoop the almonds into a measuring cup without packing them down, then level off the top. This ensures you're not over- or under-measuring. If you don’t have a scale, remember that 1 cup of whole almonds is roughly 4.2 ounces, making 2.5 cups equal to 10.5 ounces.</p>

<h3>Converting Almonds for UK Measurements</h3>  
<p>In the UK, recipes may use grams instead of ounces. 10.5 ounces of almonds convert to roughly 298 grams. This is useful if you're following a British recipe or using a metric scale. Always double-check if the recipe calls for whole, sliced, or ground almonds, as densities differ.</p>  

<h2>Storing Almonds for Freshness</h2>  
<p>Once you've measured your 2.5 cups of almonds, proper storage keeps them fresh. Store in an airtight container in a cool, dark place, or freeze for longer shelf life. This is especially handy if you buy almonds in bulk for air fryer recipes.</p>

<p>0.5 cups of rice equals approximately 100 grams, though this can vary slightly depending on the type of rice. Whether you're using an air fryer or a traditional oven, precise measurements ensure consistent results. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we know how important accuracy is for perfect meals.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Rice Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Getting the right amount of rice is crucial for portion control and recipe success. Too much rice can overcrowd your air fryer basket, leading to uneven cooking. Too little might leave you with a dry or underwhelming dish. Measuring 0.5 cups of rice in grams helps standardise your cooking, especially when following recipes from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>our collection</a>.</p>  

<p>Different rice types, like basmati or jasmine, have slightly different densities. While 0.5 cups of long-grain white rice typically weighs around 100 grams, brown rice may be closer to 105 grams. Always check the packaging or use a kitchen scale for the most precise measurement.</p>  

<h3>Converting Cups to Grams for Air Fryer Recipes</h3>  
<p>Air fryers work best with exact measurements to ensure even cooking and crispiness. If a recipe calls for 0.5 cups of rice, converting it to grams (about 100g) helps avoid guesswork. For more conversions, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>handy air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>  

<h2>Types of Rice and Their Weights</h2>  
<p>Not all rice weighs the same per cup. Here’s a quick breakdown of common rice types and their approximate weight for 0.5 cups:</p>  

<ul>  
<li>White long-grain rice: ~100g</li>  
<li>Brown rice: ~105g</li>  
<li>Basmati rice: ~95g</li>  
<li>Jasmine rice: ~90g</li>  
</ul>  

<p>For meal prepping or batch cooking, knowing these differences ensures your air fryer dishes turn out perfectly every time. Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/meal-prep>meal prep recipes</a> for inspiration.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure Rice Without a Scale</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a kitchen scale, use the spoon-and-level method for accuracy. Lightly spoon rice into a measuring cup without packing it down, then level it off with a knife. This method helps approximate 0.5 cups of rice in grams more reliably than scooping.</p>  

<h2>Common Mistakes When Measuring Rice</h2>  
<p>One of the biggest mistakes is packing rice into the measuring cup, which can add up to 20% more than intended. Another is using a liquid measuring cup instead of a dry one, leading to inconsistencies. For air fryer recipes, these small errors can affect texture and cooking time.</p>  

<p>Always use proper measuring tools and refer to reliable sources like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> for conversions. Keeping your air fryer clean also ensures even heat distribution—check our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning guide</a> for tips.</p>  

<h3>Adjusting Recipes for Different Rice Types</h3>  
<p>If substituting rice varieties, adjust cooking times slightly. For example, brown rice may need a few extra minutes in the air fryer compared to white rice. Always test for doneness and tweak as needed.</p>

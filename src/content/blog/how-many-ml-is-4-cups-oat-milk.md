<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter</h2>

<h2>Converting Cups to Millilitres</h2>

This conversion works for both UK and US cup measurements, though slight variations may exist in older recipes. If you're scaling a recipe up or down, this ratio remains consistent.</p>  

<h3>Measuring Tools to Use</h3>

For smaller quantities, a graduated measuring cup works well. If you prefer weight measurements, 946 ml of oat milk weighs roughly 970 grams, but this can vary slightly depending on the brand.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for 4.0 Cups of Oat Milk</h2>  
<p>This quantity is perfect for larger batches of dishes like overnight oats, soups, or air fryer-baked goods. Many <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/breakfast>breakfast recipes</a> call for oat milk as a base, ensuring a creamy texture without dairy. You could also use it for homemade vegan ice cream or smoothies, where precise liquid ratios matter.</p>

<h3>Storing Leftover Oat Milk</h3>  
<p>Once opened, oat milk should be refrigerated and used within 5-7 days. If you've measured 4.0 cups (946 ml) but don’t need it all, store the remainder in an airtight container. Shake well before reuse, as separation is natural. For longer storage, consider freezing oat milk in ice cube trays for smoothies.</p>  

<h2>Adjusting Recipes for Oat Milk</h2>  
<p>Oat milk’s mild sweetness works well in both sweet and savoury dishes. When substituting for dairy milk, use a 1:1 ratio—so 4.0 cups (946 ml) replaces 4.0 cups of regular milk. However, oat milk may brown faster in the air fryer due to its sugar content, so adjust cooking times slightly.

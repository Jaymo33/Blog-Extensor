<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air frying</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on even heat distribution, and incorrect oil quantities can lead to uneven cooking or soggy results. Using 0.25 tbsp of rapeseed oil (3.7 grams) ensures just enough fat for crispiness without excess grease. Many recipes on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> specify small oil amounts to keep dishes healthy. Precision is key, especially when adapting traditional oven recipes for air fryers.</p>  

<p>Rapeseed oil is a popular choice due to its high smoke point and neutral flavour. Measuring 0.25 tbsp (3.7 grams) allows for light coating without overpowering your ingredients. For perfect results every time, consider investing in digital kitchen scales or a dedicated measuring spoon set. Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipes</a> to put this measurement to delicious use.</p>  

<h3>How to measure 0.25 tbsp rapeseed oil without scales</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have scales, fill a tablespoon with rapeseed oil and divide it roughly into four equal parts. One of these parts will be close to 0.25 tbsp (3.7 grams). For more accuracy, use a 1/4 tablespoon measure if available. Remember, slight variations won’t ruin your dish, but precision helps replicate successful results.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for 0.25 tbsp rapeseed oil in air fryers</h2>  
<p>This small quantity is perfect for lightly coating vegetables before air frying. Try it with our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/potatoes>potato recipes</a> for golden, crispy results. It’s also ideal for greasing air fryer baskets to prevent sticking without adding unnecessary calories. Many marinades and dressings call for precisely 0.25 tbsp (3.7 grams) of rapeseed oil as a base.</p>  

<p>When making air fryer cakes or muffins, 0.25 tbsp rapeseed oil (3.7 grams) adds moisture without making batter too greasy. It’s a versatile measurement that features in many recipes on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>. For cleaning your air fryer after use, check out our guide on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer maintenance</a> to keep it in top condition.</p>  

<h3>Comparing rapeseed oil to other cooking fats</h3>  
<p>While 0.25 tbsp of olive oil weighs slightly more (about 4 grams), the difference is negligible for most air fryer recipes. Rapeseed oil’s neutral taste makes it preferable for delicate dishes where you don’t want strong flavours. Its high smoke point (around 230°C) makes it safer for air frying than butter or coconut oil.</p>

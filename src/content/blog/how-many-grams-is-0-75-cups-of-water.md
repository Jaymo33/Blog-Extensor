<h2>Why Convert Cups to Grams for Water?</h2>
<p>Measuring water by weight (grams) is more accurate than using volume (cups) because it eliminates variables like cup shape or settling. This is especially important for air fryer recipes, where precise moisture levels affect texture and cooking time. For example, a <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>vegetable stir-fry</a> might require exact water amounts to prevent sogginess.</p>
<p>Grams are the standard in professional kitchens and many international recipes.

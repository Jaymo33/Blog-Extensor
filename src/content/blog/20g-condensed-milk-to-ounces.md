<p>20g of condensed milk equals approximately 0.71 ounces. This conversion is handy for air fryer recipes where precise measurements matter. Whether you’re baking a cake or making a glaze, knowing the exact weight ensures perfect results every time.</p>

<h2>Why Convert Grams to Ounces for Condensed Milk?</h2>
<p>Many UK air fryer recipes use grams, but some cooks prefer ounces for smaller quantities. Condensed milk is thick and sticky, making it tricky to measure by volume. Weight measurements like grams or ounces are far more accurate, especially for sticky ingredients.</p>
<p>If you’re using an air fryer for desserts, precise measurements prevent over-sweetening or dryness. A slight variation in condensed milk can affect texture, so conversions matter. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for other common ingredient swaps.</p>

<h2>How to Measure 20g of Condensed Milk Accurately</h2>
<p>Use a digital kitchen scale for the most precise measurement. Place your mixing bowl on the scale, tare it to zero, then add condensed milk until it hits 20g. If you don’t have scales, two level teaspoons roughly equal 20g, but this isn’t as accurate.</p>
<p>For sticky ingredients like condensed milk, lightly grease your spoon or scoop first. This helps the milk slide off easily without waste. Explore more <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> where precise measurements make all the difference.</p>

<h3>Common Uses for 20g of Condensed Milk in Air Fryers</h3>
<p>This small quantity is perfect for glazing pastries, sweetening coffee, or adding richness to batters. In air fryers, it’s often used for mini desserts like mug cakes or drizzles. Its thick consistency helps coatings stick to foods like banana fritters.</p>

<h2>Converting Other Quantities of Condensed Milk</h2>
<p>Need more or less than 20g? Here’s a quick reference: 50g = 1.76 oz, 100g = 3.53 oz. Bookmark our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a> for instant access to these calculations. Remember, air fryer cooking benefits from precision – especially with sugary ingredients that can burn easily.</p>
<p>For larger batches, multiply the 20g-to-ounces ratio accordingly. Always level off your measurements for consistency across recipes. Discover more <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert recipes</a> where condensed milk shines in your air fryer.</p>

<h3>Storing Leftover Condensed Milk</h3>
<p>After measuring your 20g portion, transfer leftovers to an airtight container. It keeps for weeks in the fridge – just stir before reusing as separation occurs. Wipe the can’s rim before sealing to prevent sticking.</p>

<h2>Cleaning Tips After Handling Condensed Milk</h2>
<p>Sticky residues can build up on air fryer baskets and tools. For easy cleanup, soak utensils in warm soapy water immediately after use. Our guide to <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaning</a> has more maintenance tips to keep your appliance in top shape.</p>
<p>When condensed milk drips onto your air fryer basket, address it promptly to avoid burnt-on sugar. A soft brush and baking soda paste work wonders for stubborn spots without scratching surfaces.</p>

<p>5 tablespoons (tbsp) of yeast equals approximately 45 grams (g). This conversion is essential for baking, especially when using an air fryer for recipes like doughnuts or bread rolls. Accurate measurements ensure your dough rises perfectly every time.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate yeast measurements matter</h2>  
<p>Yeast is a crucial ingredient in baking, and even small measurement errors can affect your results. Too little yeast, and your dough wonâ€™t rise properly. Too much, and it might overproof or develop an off-flavour. Whether you're making air fryer pizza dough or cinnamon rolls, precision matters.

<p>In the UK, recipes often use grams for precision, while tablespoons are more common in casual cooking. Converting 5 tbsp of yeast to grams ensures consistency, especially when scaling recipes up or down.

<h3>How to measure yeast correctly</h3>  
<p>For the most accurate results, use a digital kitchen scale to weigh 5 tbsp of yeast in grams. Scooping yeast directly from the packet with a tablespoon can lead to uneven measurements due to settling or packing. Lightly fluff the yeast before measuring for consistency. If you're working with active dry yeast, note that its weight per tablespoon may differ slightly from instant yeast.</p>  

<h2>Common yeast conversions for baking</h2>  
<p>Beyond 5 tbsp, here are other useful yeast conversions: 1 tbsp equals about 9 grams, and 1 teaspoon (tsp) is roughly 3 grams. These conversions are handy when adjusting recipes for smaller batches or experimenting with air fryer-friendly breads.

<p>If your recipe calls for fresh yeast instead of dry, the conversion differs. Fresh yeast is about twice the weight of dry yeast, so adjust accordingly. Always check the recipe notes for specific yeast types, especially when adapting traditional oven recipes for the air fryer.</p>  

<h3>Yeast types and their weights</h3>  
<p>Not all yeast weighs the same per tablespoon. Active dry yeast is slightly denser than instant yeast, while fresh yeast (compressed) has a different texture altogether. For 5 tbsp of active dry yeast, expect around 47 grams, whereas instant yeast might weigh closer to 45 grams. Always refer to your yeast packaging for precise measurements.</p>  

<h2>Air fryer baking with yeast</h2>  
<p>Using yeast in air fryer recipes requires slight adjustments compared to conventional ovens. The rapid air circulation can dry out dough faster, so keep an eye on proofing times. Preheating your air fryer for yeast-based recipes helps ensure even cooking. For cleaning tips after baking, see our guide on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer maintenance</a>.</p>  

<p>Popular air fryer yeast recipes include mini bagels, doughnut holes, and flatbreads. Since air fryers cook faster than ovens, reduce standard baking times by 20-30% when converting recipes. The 5 tbsp to grams conversion ensures your dough has the perfect yeast ratio for these smaller, quicker bakes.</p>  

<h3>Troubleshooting yeast measurements</h3>  
<p>If your air fryer-baked goods aren't rising properly, double-check your yeast measurements. Expired yeast or water that's too hot/cold can also affect performance. For consistent results, store yeast in an airtight container in the fridge and use it within its expiration date. When in doubt, test your yeast with warm water and sugar before adding it to your recipe.</p>

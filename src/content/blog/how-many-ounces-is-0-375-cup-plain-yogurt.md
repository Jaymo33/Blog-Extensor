<p>0.375 cup of plain yogurt equals approximately 3 ounces. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements can make all the difference. Whether you’re making a marinade, a sauce, or a baked good, knowing the exact weight ensures consistent results. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we understand the importance of accurate measurements for perfect dishes every time.</p>

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>
<p>Using the right amount of ingredients is crucial in air fryer cooking. Too much or too little yogurt can affect the texture and taste of your dish. For example, if you’re making a yogurt-based marinade for chicken, 0.375 cup (or 3 ounces) of plain yogurt ensures the right consistency. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more handy measurements.</p>
<p>Air fryers cook food quickly and evenly, but they rely on precise ingredient ratios. A slight variation in yogurt quantity can lead to undercooked or overcooked meals. That’s why we recommend using a kitchen scale for accuracy, especially when dealing with small measurements like 0.375 cup of plain yogurt.</p>

<h2>How to measure 0.375 cup of plain yogurt</h2>
<p>Measuring 0.375 cup of plain yogurt can be tricky without the right tools. Here’s how to do it easily: Use a liquid measuring cup and fill it to the 1/4 cup mark, then add half of another 1/4 cup. Alternatively, weigh it on a kitchen scale for exactness—3 ounces is your target. For more tips, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipes section</a>.</p>

<h3>Using a kitchen scale for precision</h3>
<p>A kitchen scale is the most accurate way to measure 0.375 cup of plain yogurt. Simply place your bowl on the scale, tare it to zero, and add yogurt until it reads 3 ounces. This method eliminates guesswork and ensures your air fryer recipes turn out perfectly every time.</p>

<h2>Common recipes using 0.375 cup of plain yogurt</h2>
<p>Many air fryer recipes call for 0.375 cup of plain yogurt. For instance, yogurt marinades for <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken</a> or dips for <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetables</a> often use this measurement. The tangy flavor of yogurt pairs well with spices, making it a versatile ingredient. Visit <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> for inspiration.</p>
<p>Yogurt can also be used in baking, such as for air fryer muffins or cakes. The acidity in yogurt helps activate baking soda, resulting in a light and fluffy texture. Knowing that 0.375 cup equals 3 ounces ensures your baked goods rise perfectly.</p>

<h3>Tips for substituting yogurt in recipes</h3>
<p>If you’re out of plain yogurt, you can substitute it with Greek yogurt or sour cream, but adjust the quantity slightly. Greek yogurt is thicker, so you might need less than 0.375 cup (3 ounces) to achieve the same consistency. Always check the recipe for best results.</p>

<h2>Cleaning your air fryer after using yogurt</h2>
<p>Yogurt can leave residues in your air fryer basket. To keep it clean, wipe the basket with a damp cloth immediately after use. For stubborn stains, use our recommended <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner</a>. Regular maintenance ensures your air fryer stays in top condition.</p>

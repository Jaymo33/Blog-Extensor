    "acceptedAnswer": {
    "@type": "Answer",
    "text": "With a large quantity like 22.8 kg (approximately 50 pounds), it is crucial to cook in batches to avoid overcrowding your air fryer basket. Overcrowding leads to steam instead of crisp air frying. For chicken thighs, a good starting point is 200°C for 20-25 minutes per batch, flipping halfway through, until the internal temperature reaches 75°C.

It’s all about having the right tool for the job, and knowledge is the best tool you have.</p>

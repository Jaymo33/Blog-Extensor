<p>Yes, you can safely use Reynolds parchment paper in most air fryers, provided you follow specific guidelines to prevent fire hazards or damage. The key is ensuring the parchment doesn't block airflow or touch heating elements. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we've tested various methods and found parchment liners particularly useful for messy foods like marinated chicken or sticky desserts.</p>

<h2>How Reynolds Parchment Works in Air Fryers</h2>
<p>Reynolds parchment is heat-resistant up to 220°C (428°F), making it suitable for most air frying temperatures. Unlike wax paper, it won't melt at typical cooking temperatures between 160-200°C. Many users at <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes</a> prefer it for easy cleanup when preparing greasy foods like sausages or bacon. The parchment's silicone coating prevents sticking without needing oil, creating healthier versions of crispy favourites.</p>
<p>For best results, trim the parchment to fit your air fryer basket without covering the entire base. Leaving some space allows proper air circulation, preventing uneven cooking. Some models like Ninja air fryers work particularly well with pre-cut parchment rounds available at UK supermarkets. Always weight down the edges with food to prevent the parchment from lifting during cooking.</p>

<h3>Temperature Considerations</h3>
<p>While Reynolds parchment won't melt below 220°C, prolonged exposure near this limit may cause slight browning. For high-heat recipes like those found in our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/Potatoes>potato dishes section</a>, consider reducing temperature by 10°C when using parchment. This precaution maintains crispiness while eliminating any risk of scorching.</p>

<h2>Safety Precautions When Using Parchment</h2>
<p>Never use Reynolds parchment when cooking at temperatures exceeding 220°C, as this risks burning or smoking. Always ensure the parchment lies flat without touching the heating element - a common cause of parchment fires in compact air fryers. The team at <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner</a> recommends checking your manufacturer's guidelines, as some brands explicitly prohibit parchment use.</p>
<p>For foods requiring frequent shaking like chips or vegetables, consider perforated parchment paper instead. These specially designed sheets allow better airflow while still catching drips. When reheating pizza or other dry items, you might skip parchment altogether - our tests show minimal sticking at temperatures below 180°C.</p>

<h3>Alternative Liners for Different Foods</h3>
<p>For very high-heat cooking above 200°C, silicone mats often outperform parchment paper. They're reusable, withstand temperatures up to 260°C, and won't blow around in the air stream. When preparing delicate fish fillets from our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/Salmon>salmon recipes collection</a>, silicone prevents sticking better than parchment while being equally easy to clean.</p>

<h2>Troubleshooting Common Parchment Issues</h2>
<p>If your Reynolds parchment curls during cooking, lightly spritz it with water before adding food. This temporary moisture helps the paper lay flat until the food's weight takes over. For recipes requiring extended cook times like our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/Beef>beef dishes</a>, check the parchment halfway through - reposition if needed to maintain even browning.</p>
<p>Should parchment ever catch fire (extremely rare when used correctly), immediately turn off and unplug your air fryer. Never open the basket - this feeds the flames with oxygen. Keep baking soda nearby as it effectively smothers electrical fires without damaging your appliance.</p>

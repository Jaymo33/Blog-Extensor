<p>225 grams of plain flour equals approximately 1.8 cups in the UK or 1.75 cups in the US. Getting this conversion right is crucial for baking success, especially when using an air fryer for recipes like cakes or bread. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we know precision matters, so let’s dive into the details.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Flour Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Using the correct amount of flour ensures your baked goods have the right texture and rise. Too much flour can make cakes dense, while too little may cause them to collapse. This is especially important for air fryer baking, where consistency is key. Whether you’re making cookies or a sponge cake, 225 grams of plain flour should be measured carefully.</p>  

<p>Different countries use different cup sizes, which can lead to confusion. The UK standard cup holds 250ml, while the US cup is 240ml. For 225 grams of plain flour, this slight difference means you’ll need roughly 1.8 UK cups or 1.75 US cups. Always check your recipe’s origin to avoid mishaps.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure 225 Grams of Plain Flour Correctly</h3>  
<p>The best way to measure flour is by weight for absolute accuracy. If you don’t have scales, fluff the flour with a spoon before lightly scooping it into a measuring cup. Avoid packing it down, as this can lead to using too much. For air fryer recipes, consistency is everything—check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more handy tips.</p>  

<h2>UK vs. US Cup Measurements</h2>  
<p>In the UK, 1 cup of plain flour is roughly 125 grams, meaning 225 grams equals about 1.8 cups. In the US, 1 cup is around 128 grams, so 225 grams is closer to 1.75 cups. This small difference can impact recipes, so always double-check which measurement system your recipe uses.</p>  

<p>If you’re adapting a US recipe for your UK air fryer, slight adjustments may be needed. For example, if a recipe calls for 2 cups (256g US), you’d use about 2.05 UK cups (256g ÷ 125g).

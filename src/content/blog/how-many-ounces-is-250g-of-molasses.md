<p>250g of molasses equals approximately 8.82 ounces. This conversion is essential for anyone using molasses in baking or air fryer recipes, where precision can make or break a dish. Whether you're whipping up gingerbread cookies or a sticky glaze for meats, knowing the exact weight ensures consistent results. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we understand the importance of accurate measurements, especially when working with thick, dense ingredients like molasses.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate conversions matter</h2>  
<p>Molasses is a sticky, viscous liquid that can be tricky to measure by volume alone. Unlike water or milk, its density means that 250g won't neatly translate to a standard cup measurement. That's why weighing molasses in grams or ounces is far more reliable. If you're following an air fryer recipe from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>our collection</a>, you'll want to ensure every gram counts for perfect texture and flavour.</p>  

<p>Many UK bakers prefer using grams for precision, while some older recipes still list ounces. Converting 250g of molasses to ounces (8.82 oz) bridges this gap. This is particularly useful when scaling recipes up or down, or when using international cookbooks. A digital kitchen scale that switches between metric and imperial units is a worthwhile investment for any avid baker or air fryer enthusiast.</p>  

<h3>How to measure molasses accurately</h3>  
<p>To measure 250g of molasses (or 8.82 ounces), lightly grease your measuring spoon or cup with oil first. This helps the molasses slide out cleanly without sticking. Alternatively, use the tare function on your scales: place your mixing bowl on the scale, zero it out, then pour molasses directly until you hit 250g.

<h2>Molasses in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>While molasses is often associated with baking, it's also fantastic in air fryer recipes. A 250g (8.82 oz) quantity can make enough glaze for multiple batches of wings or ribs. The high sugar content caramelises beautifully under the air fryer's intense heat, creating a glossy, sticky coating. Try brushing it on salmon fillets or tofu before air frying for a sweet-savoury crust – find inspiration in our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/salmon>salmon recipes</a>.</p>  

<p>Remember that molasses burns easily due to its sugar content. When using 250g in an air fryer recipe, consider mixing it with oil or vinegar to lower the burning point. Start with shorter cooking times and check frequently. After cooking, clean your air fryer basket promptly – sticky molasses residue can harden. Our guide on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaning</a> makes this task effortless.</p>  

<h3>Types of molasses and their weights</h3>  
<p>Not all molasses weighs the same per 250g. Light molasses (from the first boiling of sugarcane) is slightly less dense than blackstrap (from the third boiling). While 250g of any molasses equals 8.82 ounces, blackstrap will appear slightly thicker in the measuring cup. For most <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert recipes</a>, light or dark molasses works best, while blackstrap's intense flavour suits marinades.</p>

<p>363 F converts to approximately 184 C in a fan oven. This is the standard conversion for recipes requiring precise temperatures, especially when using an air fryer or convection oven. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we specialise in making these conversions effortless for home cooks.</p>

<h2>Why Convert 363 F to Fan Oven?</h2>
<p>Fan ovens circulate hot air for even cooking, similar to air fryers. Converting 363 F ensures your dishes cook perfectly without over or underdoing it. Many air fryer recipes, like those in our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipes</a> section, rely on accurate fan oven equivalents. This temperature works well for roasting vegetables or baking cookies.</p>
<p>Using 363 F in a fan oven is ideal for dishes needing moderate heat. It’s a versatile setting for everything from crispy chicken to delicate desserts. Check our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a> for other common temperatures.</p>

<h2>How to Adjust Cooking Times</h2>
<p>When using 363 F in a fan oven, reduce cooking times by 10-15% compared to conventional ovens. Air fryers cook even faster due to their compact size. For example, cookies at 363 F might take 12 minutes instead of 15. Always check food early to avoid overcooking.</p>
<p>Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cookies>cookie recipes</a> include adjusted timings for fan ovens and air fryers. This ensures perfect results every time. Remember, fan ovens and air fryers distribute heat more efficiently than traditional ovens.</p>

<h3>Air Fryer vs Fan Oven at 363 F</h3>
<p>Air fryers and fan ovens both use convection heating, but air fryers are more intense. At 363 F, an air fryer will cook food faster than a fan oven. Reduce cooking times by 20% when switching from fan oven to air fryer. This is crucial for recipes like our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken dishes</a>.</p>

<h2>Common Uses for 363 F in Fan Ovens</h2>
<p>363 F is perfect for roasting vegetables, baking muffins, or reheating leftovers. It’s hot enough to crisp food without burning it. Many frozen foods, like those in our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/frozen-foods>frozen foods section</a>, cook beautifully at this temperature.</p>

<h3>Tips for Perfect Results</h3>
<p>Always preheat your fan oven or air fryer to 363 F for consistent results. Use an oven thermometer to verify the temperature. Rotate food halfway through cooking for even browning. These small steps make a big difference in your cooking.</p>

<h2>Why Convert Cups to Grams?</h2>
<p>Converting cups to grams is crucial for accuracy, especially in baking and air frying. Cups measure volume, while grams measure weight, and olive oil’s density can vary slightly. Using grams eliminates guesswork, ensuring your <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> turn out perfectly every time. This is particularly important for dishes like air-fried vegetables or crispy chicken, where oil quantity affects texture and flavour.</p>
<p>Many UK recipes use grams, so converting 2.75 cups of olive oil to grams (618g) simplifies following international recipes. It also helps when scaling recipes up or down. For example, if you’re meal prepping or cooking for a crowd, precise measurements prevent mishaps. Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable recipes</a> to put your perfectly measured olive oil to good use.</p>

<h2>How to Measure Olive Oil Accurately</h2>
<p>To measure 2.75 cups of olive oil in grams, use a digital kitchen scale for the most accurate results. Pour the oil into a measuring cup first, then transfer it to a bowl on the scale. This method avoids spills and ensures you hit the 618-gram mark precisely. For sticky or dense ingredients, a scale is even more critical.</p>
<p>If you don’t have a scale, remember that 1 cup of olive oil is roughly 225 grams, so 2.75 cups would be about 618 grams. However, slight variations can occur based on oil temperature and type. For best results, stick to weighing. Need tips on keeping your air fryer clean after oily recipes?

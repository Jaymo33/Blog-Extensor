<p>4 tablespoons (tbsp) of lime juice weigh approximately 60 grams (g). This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precision ensures the perfect balance of flavours.

<h2>Why Accurate Lime Juice Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of lime juice can make or break a dish. Too little, and your recipe lacks brightness; too much, and it becomes overpowering. In air fryer cooking, marinades and glazes rely on precise ratios to enhance flavours without overwhelming other ingredients. For example, a citrusy <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipe</a> benefits from the exact 60g measurement of lime juice for balanced taste.</p>  

<p>Lime juice also affects texture and moisture levels in air-fried foods. A marinade with too much juice can make proteins mushy, while too little might leave them dry. By converting 4 tbsp lime juice to grams, you ensure consistency in every batch.

<h3>How to Measure Lime Juice Correctly</h3>  
<p>For the most accurate 4 tbsp lime juice to grams conversion, use a kitchen scale. Scoop the juice into a tablespoon measure, then transfer it to the scale for the exact weight. If you don’t have a scale, remember that 1 tbsp of lime juice is roughly 15g, so 4 tbsp equals 60g. This method works for both fresh-squeezed and bottled lime juice.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for 4 Tbsp Lime Juice in Air Fryers</h2>  
<p>From marinades to dressings, 4 tbsp (60g) of lime juice adds a vibrant kick to air fryer dishes. Try it in a zesty shrimp marinade or a tangy glaze for salmon.

<h3>Tips for Storing Lime Juice</h3>  
<p>Fresh lime juice lasts about a week in the fridge, while bottled varieties can stay good for months. If you frequently use 4 tbsp portions, consider freezing pre-measured amounts in ice cube trays. Each cube holds roughly 15g (1 tbsp), making it easy to grab the right quantity for recipes.</p>

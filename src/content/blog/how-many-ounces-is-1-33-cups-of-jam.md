<h3>How to measure jam correctly</h3>  
<p>For the most accurate conversion of 1.33 cups of jam to ounces, use a kitchen scale. Scoop the jam into a measuring cup, then weigh it to confirm it’s 10.64 oz. If you don’t have a scale, spoon the jam into the cup without packing it down to avoid excess. Sticky ingredients like jam can vary in density, so weighing removes guesswork.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for 1.33 cups of jam in air fryer cooking</h2>

<h2>Tips for working with jam in the air fryer</h2>

<p>0.5 cups of rolled oats equals approximately 45 grams. This conversion is essential for precise baking and cooking, especially when using an air fryer. Whether you're making granola, oatmeal, or baked goods, knowing the exact weight ensures consistent results.

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Using the correct amount of rolled oats is crucial for texture and flavour. Too little, and your dish might turn out dry; too much, and it could become dense.

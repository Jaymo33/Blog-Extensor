<p>235 ml of water equals approximately 1 cup (US) or 0.99 cups (UK). Getting this conversion right is essential for air fryer recipes, where precise measurements can make or break your dish. Whether you're baking cakes or preparing sauces, knowing how to convert millilitres to cups ensures consistency and perfect results every time.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Using the correct amount of water in air fryer recipes is crucial for texture and taste. Too much liquid can lead to soggy results, while too little may cause dryness. For example, when making air fryer cakes or steamed dishes, 235 ml of water (or just under 1 cup) is often the sweet spot.

<p>Many air fryer recipes, like those for <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>cakes</a> or batters, rely on precise liquid ratios. A slight miscalculation can affect rise and browning. Measuring 235 ml of water correctly ensures your dishes turn out light, fluffy, and evenly cooked.</p>  

<h3>US vs. UK Cup Measurements</h3>  
<p>It’s important to note that US and UK cup sizes differ slightly. A US cup holds 240 ml, while a UK cup is 284 ml. This means 235 ml of water is nearly 1 US cup but roughly 0.99 UK cups. For most air fryer recipes, this small difference won’t matter, but for baking, it’s worth using a measuring jug for accuracy.</p>  

<h2>How to Measure 235 ml of Water Without a Measuring Cup</h2>  
<p>If you don’t have a measuring cup, you can use a standard mug or scale. A typical UK mug holds about 250 ml, so filling it just below the brim will give you close to 235 ml. Alternatively, weigh the water—235 ml weighs 235 grams, as water’s density is 1 g/ml.</p>  

<p>For air fryer recipes like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>steamed vegetables</a>, eyeballing the water can work, but for baking, precision is key. Consider investing in a digital scale or a graduated measuring jug for foolproof results.</p>  

<h3>Common Recipes Using 235 ml of Water</h3>

<h2>Tips for Converting ml to Cups in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>

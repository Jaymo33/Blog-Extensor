<p>1.5 tablespoons (tbsp) of chopped onion equals approximately 11 grams. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements can make or break your dish. Whether you’re whipping up a quick stir-fry or a flavourful marinade, knowing the exact weight ensures consistency. For more handy conversions, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Onion Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Getting the right amount of onion is crucial for balancing flavours in your air fryer dishes. Too much can overpower, while too little might leave your meal tasting bland. Onions also contain moisture, which affects cooking times—another reason why grams are more reliable than volume measurements. If you’re prepping ahead, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/meal-prep>meal prep recipes</a> can help streamline your cooking process.</p>  

<p>For UK cooks, tablespoon sizes are standardised, but onion density can vary based on how finely it’s chopped. That’s why weighing in grams removes the guesswork. Whether you’re making crispy onion toppings or a savoury base for sauces, precision ensures perfect results every time.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure 1.5 Tbsp of Onion Correctly</h3>  
<p>Use a flat-edged knife to level off your tablespoon for an exact 1.5 tbsp measurement. For even greater accuracy, a kitchen scale is ideal—especially if you’re scaling recipes up or down. If you’re new to air frying, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a> for inspiration.</p>  

<h2>Common Recipes Using 1.5 Tbsp Onion</h2>  
<p>Many air fryer dishes call for small amounts of onion to enhance flavour without overwhelming other ingredients. Think homemade burger patties, stuffed mushrooms, or even a quick salsa. For vegetable-heavy meals, browse our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable recipes</a> tailored for air fryers.</p>  

<p>If you’re converting a traditional recipe to air fryer cooking, adjusting onion quantities might be necessary due to differences in evaporation rates. Always start with the recommended 11 grams (1.5 tbsp) and tweak to taste. Need cleaning tips after cooking? Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner guide</a> has you covered.</p>  

<h3>Tips for Storing Leftover Onion</h3>  
<p>Chopped onion can be refrigerated for up to 3 days in an airtight container. For longer storage, freeze portions in ice cube trays—each cube holds roughly 1 tbsp (7 grams), making future measurements a breeze.</p>

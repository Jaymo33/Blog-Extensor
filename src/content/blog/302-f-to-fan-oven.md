<p>302°F converts to approximately 150°C in a fan oven. This is a common temperature for slow-roasting vegetables or baking delicate desserts in an air fryer. Understanding this conversion ensures your dishes cook evenly, whether you're using a conventional oven or adapting recipes for your air fryer. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we recommend checking our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a> for precise adjustments.</p>

<h2>Why Convert 302°F to Fan Oven?</h2>
<p>Fan ovens circulate hot air for faster, more even cooking, which means temperatures often need adjusting from traditional Fahrenheit settings. Converting 302°F to 150°C fan ensures your air fryer doesn't overcook dishes like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken</a> or baked goods. This is especially useful for recipes originally designed for conventional ovens. The fan setting reduces cooking time by about 20%, so keep an eye on your food.</p>
<p>Air fryers work similarly to fan ovens, using rapid air circulation. If a recipe calls for 302°F, setting your air fryer to 150°C fan will yield comparable results. For crispy textures, like with <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/potatoes>roast potatoes</a>, you might need to tweak the time slightly. Always preheat your air fryer for the best outcomes.</p>

<h2>How to Adjust Cooking Times</h2>
<p>When using 302°F (150°C fan) in an air fryer, reduce the cooking time by 5-10 minutes compared to a conventional oven. For example, cookies that take 12 minutes at 302°F in an oven might need just 8-9 minutes in the air fryer. Check our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a> for tested timings.</p>

<h3>Tips for Specific Foods</h3>
<p>Delicate items like custards or <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>sponge cakes</a> benefit from the even heat of 150°C fan. For meats, use a thermometer to confirm doneness, as air fryers cook faster. Frozen foods, such as <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/frozen-foods>chips or nuggets</a>, often cook well at this temperature without needing extra oil.</p>

<h2>Common Mistakes to Avoid</h2>
<p>Overcrowding the air fryer basket at 302°F (150°C fan) prevents proper air circulation, leading to uneven cooking. Also, skipping preheating can throw off timings.

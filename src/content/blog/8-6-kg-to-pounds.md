Many modern scales offer a 'unit' button that lets you switch from metric to imperial with a simple press, displaying the result instantly.

<h3>The Simple Math Behind 8.6 kg in Pounds</h3>
<p>The conversion factor from kilograms to pounds is an international standard, meaning 1 kilogram always equals 2.20462262185 pounds. To find what is 8.6 kg in pounds, you simply perform the multiplication: 8.6 × 2.20462262185. The result of this calculation is 18.95975454791, which we neatly round to 18.96 pounds for everyday use.

This level of detail can be important for competition-level baking or very specific dietary plans.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Garlic Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Garlic is a powerful ingredient that can make or break a dish. Too little, and your meal lacks depth; too much, and it overpowers other flavours. When using an air fryer, precise measurements like 500g crushed garlic to ounces ensure consistency. This is particularly important for recipes like garlic bread, roasted vegetables, or marinades found in our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipes section</a>.</p>  

<p>Crushed garlic also varies in density compared to whole cloves, so weight conversions are more reliable than volume. For example, 500g crushed garlic in ounces is a fixed weight, whereas measuring by the spoonful can lead to inconsistencies. This precision is key for air fryer cooking, where even heat distribution relies on uniform ingredient sizes.</p>

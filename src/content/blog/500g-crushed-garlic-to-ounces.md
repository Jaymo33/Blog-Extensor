<p>500g of crushed garlic equals approximately 17.64 ounces. This conversion is essential for precise cooking, especially when using an air fryer where ingredient measurements can impact the final dish. Whether you're following a recipe from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> or prepping ingredients for meal prep, knowing this conversion ensures accuracy.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Garlic Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Garlic is a powerful ingredient that can make or break a dish. Too little, and your meal lacks depth; too much, and it overpowers other flavours. When using an air fryer, precise measurements like 500g crushed garlic to ounces ensure consistency. This is particularly important for recipes like garlic bread, roasted vegetables, or marinades found in our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipes section</a>.</p>  

<p>Crushed garlic also varies in density compared to whole cloves, so weight conversions are more reliable than volume. For example, 500g crushed garlic in ounces is a fixed weight, whereas measuring by the spoonful can lead to inconsistencies. This precision is key for air fryer cooking, where even heat distribution relies on uniform ingredient sizes.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure Crushed Garlic Correctly</h3>  
<p>To measure 500g of crushed garlic, use a kitchen scale for accuracy. If you don’t have one, remember that 500g equals roughly 17.64 ounces. This conversion is useful for UK cooks who might follow recipes using metric or imperial units. For more tips on conversions, check our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for 500g Crushed Garlic</h2>  
<p>500g of crushed garlic is a large quantity, often used in batch cooking or meal prep. You might use it for garlic butter, marinades, or seasoning proteins like chicken or lamb. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipes</a> often call for generous amounts of garlic, making this conversion handy.</p>  

<p>Another popular use is for air-fried vegetables. Tossing veggies like potatoes or mushrooms in crushed garlic before air frying enhances their flavour. If you're unsure about quantities, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a> offers guidance on balancing flavours for perfect results every time.</p>  

<h3>Storing Leftover Crushed Garlic</h3>  
<p>If you’ve converted 500g crushed garlic to ounces but don’t use it all, store it properly. Keep it in an airtight container in the fridge for up to a week, or freeze it in portions for longer storage. This ensures you always have garlic ready for quick air fryer meals.</p>

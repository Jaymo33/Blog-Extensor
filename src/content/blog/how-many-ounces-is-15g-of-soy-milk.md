<h2>How to Measure 15g of Soy Milk Accurately</h2>  
<p>Using a digital kitchen scale is the easiest way to measure 15g of soy milk. Simply place your container on the scale, tare it to zero, and pour until you hit 15g. If you don’t have a scale, a tablespoon holds roughly 15g (or 0.53 oz) of soy milk, but this can vary slightly depending on density.</p>  

<h3>Using Measuring Spoons for Soy Milk</h3>  
<p>While not as precise as a scale, measuring spoons can work in a pinch. One level tablespoon is close to 15g, but for best results, stick to a scale. For more air fryer-friendly recipes, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipes section</a>.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for 15g of Soy Milk in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Soy milk is a versatile ingredient in air fryer recipes. From light batters for crispy vegetables to creamy dips, 15g (0.53 oz) can be just the right amount. Try it in vegan pancakes or as a binder for breadcrumbs on tofu. For inspiration, browse our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/tofu>tofu recipes</a>.</p>  
<p>Another great use is in marinades. A small amount of soy milk can tenderise plant-based proteins while adding subtle creaminess. If you're meal prepping, precise measurements ensure consistency across batches.</p>  

<h3>Storing Leftover Soy Milk</h3>  
<p>If you have leftover soy milk after measuring out 15g, store it in an airtight container in the fridge. Shake well before using, as separation is natural.

<p>15 grams (g) of soy milk is approximately 0.53 ounces (oz). If you're using an air fryer and need precise measurements for recipes, this conversion is essential for perfect results every time. Whether you're making a creamy sauce or a light batter, knowing how to convert grams to ounces ensures consistency in your cooking.</p>  

<h2>Why Convert 15g of Soy Milk to Ounces?</h2>  
<p>Many air fryer recipes, especially those from the UK or US, use different measurement systems. While grams are common in the UK, ounces are often used in American recipes. Converting 15g of soy milk to ounces (0.53 oz) helps avoid confusion and ensures your dish turns out just right. For more air fryer measurement tips, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>  
<p>Precision is key when working with liquids like soy milk in air fryer recipes. Too much or too little can affect texture and cooking time. Whether you're making crispy tofu or a vegan dessert, accurate measurements make all the difference. Visit <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> for more helpful guides.</p>  

<h2>How to Measure 15g of Soy Milk Accurately</h2>  
<p>Using a digital kitchen scale is the easiest way to measure 15g of soy milk. Simply place your container on the scale, tare it to zero, and pour until you hit 15g. If you don’t have a scale, a tablespoon holds roughly 15g (or 0.53 oz) of soy milk, but this can vary slightly depending on density.</p>  

<h3>Using Measuring Spoons for Soy Milk</h3>  
<p>While not as precise as a scale, measuring spoons can work in a pinch. One level tablespoon is close to 15g, but for best results, stick to a scale. For more air fryer-friendly recipes, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipes section</a>.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for 15g of Soy Milk in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Soy milk is a versatile ingredient in air fryer recipes. From light batters for crispy vegetables to creamy dips, 15g (0.53 oz) can be just the right amount. Try it in vegan pancakes or as a binder for breadcrumbs on tofu. For inspiration, browse our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/tofu>tofu recipes</a>.</p>  
<p>Another great use is in marinades. A small amount of soy milk can tenderise plant-based proteins while adding subtle creaminess. If you're meal prepping, precise measurements ensure consistency across batches.</p>  

<h3>Storing Leftover Soy Milk</h3>  
<p>If you have leftover soy milk after measuring out 15g, store it in an airtight container in the fridge. Shake well before using, as separation is natural. For tips on keeping your air fryer clean after cooking with liquids, see our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning guide</a>.</p>  

<h2>Converting Other Soy Milk Measurements</h2>  
<p>Need to convert a different amount? Here’s a quick reference: 30g is about 1.06 oz, and 50g is roughly 1.76 oz. Bookmark <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> for more handy conversion tips and air fryer hacks.</p>  
<p>Remember, slight variations can occur based on soy milk brand and thickness. Always adjust recipes to taste, especially when working with small quantities like 15g (0.53 oz).</p>

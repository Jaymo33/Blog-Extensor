<p>1 tablespoon (tbsp) of brown sugar weighs approximately 12.5 grams in the UK. This measurement is essential for air fryer recipes, where precision ensures perfect texture and flavour. Whether you're baking cookies or glazing meats, knowing the exact conversion helps avoid mishaps.

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air frying</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on even heat distribution, so ingredient ratios must be spot-on. Too much sugar can cause burning, while too little may leave dishes bland. Brown sugar, with its moisture content, affects texture differently than white sugar. That’s why converting 1 tbsp of brown sugar to grams (12.5g) is crucial for consistency. Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> for perfectly measured sweet and savoury ideas.</p>  

<h3>Types of brown sugar and their weights</h3>  
<p>Light and dark brown sugar have slightly different densities due to molasses content. However, 1 tbsp of either type averages 12.5 grams in UK measurements. Packed brown sugar may weigh slightly more, so always level off your spoon for accuracy. This small detail makes a big difference in air fryer baking.</p>  

<h2>Converting other sugar measurements</h2>  
<p>If your recipe calls for cups or ounces, here’s a quick guide: 1 cup of brown sugar equals roughly 200 grams, while 1 ounce is about 28 grams. These conversions help scale recipes up or down for your air fryer’s capacity.

<h3>Common mistakes when measuring brown sugar</h3>  
<p>Scooping directly from the bag often leads to uneven amounts. Instead, spoon sugar into the tablespoon and level it with a knife. For sticky recipes like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cookies>air fryer cookies</a>, compacting the sugar slightly ensures the right sweetness. Remember, 1 tbsp brown sugar to grams should always be 12.5g for reliability.</p>  

<h2>How to adjust air fryer recipes with brown sugar</h2>  
<p>Since air fryers cook faster than ovens, reducing sugar by 10% can prevent over-caramelisation. For glazes or rubs, mix 12.5g (1 tbsp) brown sugar with spices for balanced flavour. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>air fryer chicken recipes</a> showcase how sugar enhances savoury dishes too.</p>  

<h3>Storing brown sugar for freshness</h3>  
<p>Keep brown sugar in an airtight container to maintain moisture. If it hardens, place a slice of bread in the container overnight to soften it. Proper storage ensures your 1 tbsp measurement stays consistent for every air fryer bake.</p>

<p>1.75 cups of tomato paste equals approximately 14 ounces, making it easy to measure for air fryer recipes. Whether you're whipping up a quick pasta sauce or a hearty stew, knowing this conversion ensures your dish turns out perfectly every time. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we believe precise measurements are key to culinary success, especially when using an air fryer.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of tomato paste can make or break your air fryer dish. Too much can overpower the flavours, while too little might leave your meal tasting bland. Air fryers cook food quickly and evenly, so precise measurements ensure consistent results. For more tips on perfecting your air fryer recipes, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>  

<p>Tomato paste is a concentrated ingredient, so even small variations in quantity can affect the final taste. If you're adapting a traditional recipe for the air fryer, converting cups to ounces helps maintain the intended flavour balance. This is especially useful for dishes like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>air fryer chicken recipes</a>, where tomato paste often forms the base of marinades or sauces.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure Tomato Paste Correctly</h3>  
<p>When measuring tomato paste, always use a liquid measuring cup for accuracy. Scoop the paste into the cup and level it off with a straight edge for a precise 1.75-cup measurement. If you don't have measuring cups, a kitchen scale set to ounces will do the trick—just aim for 14 ounces.</p>  

<h2>Converting Other Tomato Paste Quantities</h2>  
<p>Need to adjust your recipe? Here's a quick reference for common tomato paste conversions: 1 cup equals 8 ounces, while 0.5 cups equals 4 ounces. For larger batches, 2 cups of tomato paste translate to 16 ounces. These conversions are handy when scaling recipes up or down for your air fryer.</p>  

<p>If you're working with a recipe that uses grams instead of ounces, 1.75 cups of tomato paste is roughly 396 grams. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a> includes both metric and imperial measurements, so you'll always find the right fit for your kitchen tools.</p>  

<h3>Storing Leftover Tomato Paste</h3>  
<p>Opened tomato paste can be stored in the fridge for up to a week. For longer storage, freeze measured portions in an ice cube tray—each cube holds about 1 ounce, making it easy to grab just what you need for future air fryer meals. Proper storage ensures you always have tomato paste on hand without waste.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for Tomato Paste in Air Fryer Recipes</h2>  
<p>Tomato paste adds depth to countless air fryer dishes, from meatballs to vegetable bakes. It's a key ingredient in <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>air fryer vegetable recipes</a>, where it helps create crispy, flavourful coatings. You'll also find it in marinades for <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/beef>air fryer beef recipes</a>, adding richness without excess moisture.</p>  

<p>For a quick weeknight meal, try mixing tomato paste with herbs and olive oil to coat chicken or fish before air frying. The concentrated flavour caramelises beautifully in the air fryer, creating a restaurant-quality finish. And don't forget to keep your appliance in top condition with our recommended <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner</a> for easy maintenance.</p>

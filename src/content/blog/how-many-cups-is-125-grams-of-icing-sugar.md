<p>125 grams of icing sugar is roughly equivalent to 1 cup in both UK and US measurements. However, slight variations can occur due to how the sugar is packed. For precise baking, especially in air fryer recipes, measuring by weight is always best.</p>

<h2>Understanding Icing Sugar Measurements</h2>
<p>When converting grams to cups for icing sugar, density plays a key role. Icing sugar is finely ground, which means it packs more tightly than granulated sugar. This is why 125 grams of icing sugar fills about 1 cup, whereas granulated sugar would take up more space. For air fryer baking, precision matters, so using a kitchen scale is ideal.</p>
<p>If you don’t have scales, fluff the icing sugar with a fork before spooning it into the cup. Avoid tapping the cup, as this compacts the sugar and leads to inaccurate measurements.

<h2>UK vs US Cup Measurements</h2>
<p>While 125 grams of icing sugar equals 1 cup in both the UK and US, there are slight differences in cup sizes. A UK cup holds 250ml, while a US cup is 240ml. This minor variation won’t drastically affect most recipes, but for delicate bakes like macarons or sponges, sticking to grams ensures consistency.</p>
<p>If you’re adapting a recipe from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>our collection</a>, always check whether it uses UK or US measurements. Many air fryer recipes specify grams to avoid confusion, making conversions hassle-free.</p>

<h3>Why Weight Beats Volume for Baking</h3>
<p>Measuring by weight (grams) is far more accurate than using cups. Factors like humidity, how the sugar is stored, and even the brand can affect volume measurements. For air fryer baking, where precision impacts texture and rise, weighing ingredients eliminates guesswork.</p>

<h2>Common Uses for 125 Grams of Icing Sugar</h2>
<p>This amount is perfect for frosting a small cake, dusting desserts, or making a glaze. Many <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>air fryer cake recipes</a> call for 125 grams of icing sugar to achieve the ideal sweetness and consistency. It’s also a key ingredient in buttercream and royal icing.</p>
<p>If you’re reheating baked goods in your air fryer, a light dusting of icing sugar can refresh their appearance. Just ensure your air fryer is clean—our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning guide</a> can help!</p>

<h3>Storing Icing Sugar Correctly</h3>
<p>To keep icing sugar fresh, store it in an airtight container away from moisture. Clumping can alter its density, making cup measurements less reliable. If your sugar hardens, sieve it before use to restore its fine texture.</p>

<h2>Converting Other Sugar Amounts</h2>
<p>Need to adjust your recipe? Here’s a quick reference: 250 grams of icing sugar equals 2 cups, while 60 grams is roughly ½ cup. For larger batches, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a> covers all common measurements.</p>

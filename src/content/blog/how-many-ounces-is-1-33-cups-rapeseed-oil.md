<p>1.33 cups of rapeseed oil equals approximately 10.64 ounces. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precision matters, ensuring your dishes turn out perfectly every time. Whether you’re frying, baking, or roasting, knowing the exact weight of your ingredients can make or break a recipe. Rapeseed oil, a staple in many kitchens, is often measured in cups, but many recipes, especially those on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, may require ounces for accuracy.</p>

<h2>Why Convert Cups to Ounces for Rapeseed Oil?</h2>  
<p>Converting cups to ounces is crucial for consistency in cooking, especially when using an air fryer. Air fryers rely on precise measurements to ensure even cooking and perfect texture. Rapeseed oil, with its high smoke point and neutral flavour, is a popular choice for air frying, but its density means volume (cups) and weight (ounces) aren’t interchangeable. A slight miscalculation could lead to overly greasy or dry results, which is why knowing that 1.33 cups of rapeseed oil equals 10.64 ounces is so helpful.</p>  
<p>Many air fryer recipes, like those found in our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipes section</a>, specify weights for better accuracy. This is particularly important for baking, where ratios of wet to dry ingredients can affect the final product. By converting 1.33 cups of rapeseed oil to ounces, you ensure your air fryer dishes are consistently delicious.</p>

<h3>How to Measure Rapeseed Oil Accurately</h3>  
<p>For the most accurate measurement, use a kitchen scale to weigh your rapeseed oil in ounces. If you don’t have a scale, remember that 1 cup of rapeseed oil is roughly 8 ounces, so 1.33 cups would be about 10.64 ounces. This method is handy when following air fryer recipes that list ingredients by weight, such as those in our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>cake category</a>.</p>

<h2>Common Uses for Rapeseed Oil in Air Fryers</h2>  
<p>Rapeseed oil is versatile and works well in air fryers for frying, roasting, and even baking. Its high smoke point (around 230°C) makes it ideal for high-heat cooking, while its mild flavour won’t overpower your dishes. Whether you’re making crispy chicken, roasted vegetables, or even desserts, 1.33 cups (or 10.64 ounces) of rapeseed oil can be the perfect amount for coating or frying.</p>  
<p>For example, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipes</a> often call for a light coating of oil to achieve that golden, crispy finish. Knowing how many ounces are in 1.33 cups of rapeseed oil ensures you don’t over or under-oil your ingredients, leading to better results every time.</p>

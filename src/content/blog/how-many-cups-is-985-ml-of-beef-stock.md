<p>985 ml of beef stock equals approximately 4.16 cups. This conversion is essential for recipes requiring precise measurements, especially when using an air fryer for dishes like stews or casseroles. Whether you're following a British or American recipe, knowing how to convert ml to cups ensures your dish turns out perfectly every time.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Getting the right amount of beef stock can make or break a recipe. Too little, and your dish may lack depth; too much, and it could become overly watery. Air fryer recipes, like those found on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, often rely on precise liquid measurements for even cooking. Converting 985 ml of beef stock to cups ensures consistency, whether you're making gravy, soup, or a hearty beef casserole.</p>  

<p>For those who love experimenting with <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a>, understanding volume conversions is key. Many recipes, especially those involving braising or deglazing, require exact liquid quantities. Measuring 985 ml of beef stock correctly means your dish will have the perfect balance of flavours and textures.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure 985 ml of Beef Stock</h3>  
<p>If you don't have a measuring jug, you can use standard cups to measure 985 ml of beef stock. Since 1 cup equals roughly 237 ml, 985 ml translates to just over 4 cups. For precision, use a kitchen scale or a liquid measuring cup marked in millilitres. This ensures your air fryer dishes, like those in our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/beef>beef recipe category</a>, turn out perfectly every time.</p>  

<h2>Converting 985 ml of Beef Stock for Different Recipes</h2>  
<p>Whether you're cooking a classic beef bourguignon or a quick air fryer stew, knowing how many cups 985 ml of beef stock equals is crucial. British and American cup measurements differ slightly, but for most recipes, the standard 237 ml per cup works well. If you're scaling a recipe up or down, check our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for quick reference.</p>  

<p>For dishes like slow-cooked beef or air fryer pot roasts, the right amount of stock ensures tender, flavourful results. Too much liquid can lead to soggy textures, while too little may cause drying. Measuring 985 ml of beef stock accurately helps maintain the ideal moisture balance, especially when using an air fryer.</p>  

<h3>Common Uses for 985 ml of Beef Stock</h3>  
<p>985 ml of beef stock is perfect for making rich gravies, soups, or braising liquids. In an air fryer, it's ideal for dishes like beef stroganoff or mushroom and beef risotto.

<h2>Tips for Storing Leftover Beef Stock</h2>  
<p>If your recipe doesn't use all 985 ml of beef stock, store the remainder properly. Pour it into an airtight container and refrigerate for up to 3 days or freeze for longer shelf life. This ensures you always have stock on hand for quick air fryer meals.</p>

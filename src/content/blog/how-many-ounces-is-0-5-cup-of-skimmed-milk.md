<h3>How to Measure 0.5 Cup of Skimmed Milk Correctly</h3>  
<p>To measure 0.5 cup of skimmed milk accurately, use a liquid measuring cup with clear markings. Pour the milk to the 0.5 cup line, ensuring it sits level for precision. If you’re converting to ounces (4.23 oz), a kitchen scale can also help verify the amount.</p>  

<h2>Common Recipes Using 0.5 Cup of Skimmed Milk</h2>

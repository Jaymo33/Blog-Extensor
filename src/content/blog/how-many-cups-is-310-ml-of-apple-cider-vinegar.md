<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Using the correct amount of apple cider vinegar is crucial for balancing flavours in your dishes. Too much can overpower a recipe, while too little might leave it lacking acidity.

This method is especially useful for air fryer recipes where precision impacts texture and flavour.</p>

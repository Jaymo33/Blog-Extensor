<p>2 tablespoons (tbsp) of tomato paste equals approximately 30 grams (g). This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements can make or break your dish. Whether you're making a rich pasta sauce or a flavourful marinade, knowing the exact weight ensures consistency. For more handy conversions, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on even cooking, and incorrect ingredient quantities can lead to uneven results. Tomato paste, being a concentrated ingredient, needs precise measurement to avoid overpowering or underwhelming flavours. Too much can make your dish overly tangy, while too little might leave it bland. This is especially important for recipes like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>air fryer chicken dishes</a>, where balance is key.</p>  

<p>Using grams instead of tablespoons eliminates guesswork, as scoop sizes can vary. A kitchen scale ensures accuracy, helping you achieve restaurant-quality meals at home. If you're new to air frying, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a> offers plenty of inspiration with measured ingredients.</p>  

<h3>How to measure tomato paste without a scale</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a scale, levelling off your tablespoons is the next best option. Use the back of a knife to scrape off excess paste for an accurate 2 tbsp measure. Remember, 2 tbsp of tomato paste to grams is roughly 30g, but slight variations can occur based on density. For sticky ingredients like tomato paste, lightly greasing your spoon can help with clean measurement.</p>  

<h2>Common recipes using 2 tbsp tomato paste</h2>  
<p>Many air fryer recipes call for 2 tbsp of tomato paste, from hearty stews to glazes. For example, a classic <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>air fryer ratatouille</a> might use this amount to deepen flavours. Similarly, meatball or burger mixes often include tomato paste for moisture and richness. Knowing the gram equivalent ensures your dish turns out perfectly every time.</p>  

<p>Tomato paste also works wonders in marinades for <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/beef>air fryer beef recipes</a>, adding umami depth. If you’re batch-cooking, converting 2 tbsp of tomato paste into grams helps scale recipes up or down. Always store leftover paste in an airtight container or freeze it in portions for future use.</p>  

<h3>Tips for working with tomato paste in air fryers</h3>  
<p>Tomato paste can thicken sauces quickly, so dilute it with a splash of water or stock if needed. When air frying, spread pastes or glazes evenly to prevent burning. For easy cleanup, line your basket with <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer liners</a> before adding sticky ingredients like tomato paste.</p>

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on even heat distribution, and incorrect flour quantities can lead to uneven cooking. Too much gram flour may result in dry, crumbly dishes, while too little can leave food undercooked. Measuring 0.66 cup of gram flour in ounces ensures consistency, especially for recipes like onion bhajis or savoury pancakes. If you're experimenting with gluten-free baking, precise weights are even more critical. Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a> for inspiration.</p>  

<p>Gram flour is denser than wheat flour, so volume-to-weight conversions aren't always straightforward. A standard UK cup holds about 4 ounces of gram flour, meaning 0.66 cup equates to roughly 2.64 ounces. This small but important detail can elevate your air fryer dishes from good to great. For those who love crispy, golden results, weighing ingredients is a game-changer.

<h3>How to measure gram flour without scales</h3>  
<p>If you don't have kitchen scales, use the spoon-and-level method for accuracy. Lightly spoon gram flour into a measuring cup until it's heaped, then level it off with a knife. This avoids compacting the flour, which could skew your 0.66 cup measurement. For air fryer batters, consistency is key—too thick or thin, and your dish won't crisp up properly.

<h3>Tips for storing gram flour</h3>

Always check for a nutty aroma—if it smells musty, it's time to replace it. Proper storage means your air fryer creations will always taste their best.</p>

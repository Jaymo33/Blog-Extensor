<p>0.66 cup of gram flour equals approximately 2.64 ounces (oz) in UK measurements. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precision ensures perfect texture and consistency. Whether you're making crispy bhajis or gluten-free snacks, knowing the exact weight helps avoid soggy or overly dense results. Gram flour, also known as besan, is a staple in many cuisines, and accurate measurements make all the difference. For more air fryer conversions, visit <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>our conversion chart</a>.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on even heat distribution, and incorrect flour quantities can lead to uneven cooking. Too much gram flour may result in dry, crumbly dishes, while too little can leave food undercooked. Measuring 0.66 cup of gram flour in ounces ensures consistency, especially for recipes like onion bhajis or savoury pancakes. If you're experimenting with gluten-free baking, precise weights are even more critical. Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a> for inspiration.</p>  

<p>Gram flour is denser than wheat flour, so volume-to-weight conversions aren't always straightforward. A standard UK cup holds about 4 ounces of gram flour, meaning 0.66 cup equates to roughly 2.64 ounces. This small but important detail can elevate your air fryer dishes from good to great. For those who love crispy, golden results, weighing ingredients is a game-changer. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable recipes</a> for ideas using gram flour.</p>  

<h3>How to measure gram flour without scales</h3>  
<p>If you don't have kitchen scales, use the spoon-and-level method for accuracy. Lightly spoon gram flour into a measuring cup until it's heaped, then level it off with a knife. This avoids compacting the flour, which could skew your 0.66 cup measurement. For air fryer batters, consistency is key—too thick or thin, and your dish won't crisp up properly.

<h2>Common uses for gram flour in air fryers</h2>  
<p>Gram flour is a versatile ingredient, perfect for coating vegetables, fish, or tofu before air frying. Its high protein content creates a crispier texture than wheat flour, making it ideal for gluten-free diets. Measuring 0.66 cup of gram flour in ounces ensures your batter adheres evenly without clumping. Popular dishes include crispy okra, spiced chickpea bites, and even air-fried falafel. For more ideas, browse our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/tofu>tofu recipes</a>.</p>  

<p>Beyond savoury dishes, gram flour works wonders in air fryer desserts like besan ladoo or gluten-free cookies. The 0.66 cup to ounces conversion helps maintain the right balance of moisture and structure. Whether you're baking or frying, precise measurements guarantee consistent results every time. Don't forget to preheat your air fryer for optimal performance. Hungry for more? Try our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert section</a>.</p>  

<h3>Tips for storing gram flour</h3>  
<p>Keep gram flour in an airtight container to prevent moisture absorption, which can affect weight measurements. If stored properly, it stays fresh for months, ready for your next 0.66 cup to ounces conversion. For bulk buyers, dividing flour into smaller portions ensures accuracy when measuring. Always check for a nutty aroma—if it smells musty, it's time to replace it. Proper storage means your air fryer creations will always taste their best.</p>

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of condensed milk can affect the texture and taste of your dish. Too much can make it overly sweet, while too little might leave it lacking flavour. Air fryers cook quickly, so precise measurements help avoid under or overcooking. If you're experimenting with new recipes, like those in our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipes section</a>, conversions like 40g to ounces are invaluable.</p>  

<p>Condensed milk is a staple in many desserts, from fudgy brownies to creamy cheesecakes. Knowing how to convert 40g to ounces ensures consistency, especially when scaling recipes up or down.

<h3>How to measure condensed milk without scales</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have scales, you can use tablespoons to measure condensed milk. One tablespoon holds roughly 20g, so 40g would be two tablespoons. However, for baking, scales are more accurate. Always level off the spoon for the best results.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for condensed milk in air fryer recipes</h2>  
<p>Condensed milk adds richness to air fryer desserts like banoffee pie or sticky toffee pudding. It’s also great for glazes or drizzles on cakes and pastries. For savoury dishes, a touch can balance spicy or tangy flavours. Discover more creative uses in our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>cakes category</a>.</p>

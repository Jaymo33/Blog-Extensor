<p>225 grams of lentils equals approximately 1.1 cups when measured using standard UK or US cup measurements. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes, where precise ingredient quantities ensure even cooking and perfect texture. Whether you're making lentil patties, soups, or casseroles, knowing how many cups 225 grams of lentils translates to will help you nail the recipe every time.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Lentil Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Getting the right amount of lentils is crucial, especially when using an air fryer. Too many lentils can overcrowd the basket, leading to uneven cooking, while too few might dry out or burn. For dishes like crispy lentil falafels or air-fried lentil koftas, 225 grams of lentils (roughly 1.1 cups) is a common starting point. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more handy measurement guides.</p>  

<p>Lentils expand when cooked, so measuring them correctly ensures your dish isn’t too dense or watery. If you’re meal prepping, 225 grams of lentils yields about 2.5 cups once cooked—ideal for batch cooking. For more inspiration, browse our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>lentil-based air fryer recipes</a> to put this measurement to good use.</p>  

<h3>UK vs. US Cup Measurements</h3>  
<p>While the difference between UK and US cups is minimal, it’s worth noting that 225 grams of lentils equals 1.1 cups in both systems. For absolute precision, use a kitchen scale, but if you’re relying on cups, fluff the lentils before scooping to avoid compacting them. This ensures consistency across recipes, whether you’re following a British or American guide.</p>  

<h2>How to Measure 225 Grams of Lentils Without a Scale</h2>  
<p>No scale? No problem. To measure 225 grams of lentils in cups, use a dry measuring cup and fill it loosely to the brim. Avoid packing the lentils down, as this can skew the measurement. Lentils vary slightly in size, but as a rule, 1 cup holds about 200 grams, so 225 grams is just over a cup. For lentil-heavy dishes like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable lentil bakes</a>, this method works perfectly.</p>  

<p>If you’re adapting a recipe from grams to cups, remember that brown and green lentils have similar densities, while red lentils are slightly lighter. Adjust slightly if swapping varieties. Need more tips? Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning guide</a> ensures your air fryer stays in top shape for lentil-based meals.</p>  

<h3>Cooking Lentils in the Air Fryer</h3>  
<p>Pre-cooked lentils work best in the air fryer. For 225 grams of lentils (1.1 cups), toss them with a bit of oil and seasoning, then air fry at 180°C for 8–10 minutes for a crispy texture. This method is perfect for salads or topping grain bowls. For whole recipes, like lentil burgers, combine with binders like egg or breadcrumbs before air frying.</p>  

<h2>Common Recipes Using 225 Grams of Lentils</h2>  
<p>From soups to snacks, 225 grams of lentils is a versatile quantity. Try air-fried lentil meatballs or stuffed peppers for a protein-packed meal. For baking, lentil flour (ground from 225g lentils) adds richness to gluten-free treats.

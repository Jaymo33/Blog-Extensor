<h3>UK vs. US Cup Measurements</h3>  
<p>While the difference between UK and US cups is minimal, it’s worth noting that 225 grams of lentils equals 1.1 cups in both systems. For absolute precision, use a kitchen scale, but if you’re relying on cups, fluff the lentils before scooping to avoid compacting them. This ensures consistency across recipes, whether you’re following a British or American guide.</p>  

<h2>How to Measure 225 Grams of Lentils Without a Scale</h2>  
<p>No scale? No problem. To measure 225 grams of lentils in cups, use a dry measuring cup and fill it loosely to the brim. Avoid packing the lentils down, as this can skew the measurement. Lentils vary slightly in size, but as a rule, 1 cup holds about 200 grams, so 225 grams is just over a cup. For lentil-heavy dishes like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable lentil bakes</a>, this method works perfectly.</p>  

<p>If you’re adapting a recipe from grams to cups, remember that brown and green lentils have similar densities, while red lentils are slightly lighter. Adjust slightly if swapping varieties.

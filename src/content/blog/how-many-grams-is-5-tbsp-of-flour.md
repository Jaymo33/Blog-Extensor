<p>5 tablespoons (tbsp) of flour equals approximately 40 grams (g). This conversion is essential for precise baking, especially when using an air fryer where measurements can make or break a recipe.

<h2>Why accurate flour measurements matter</h2>  
<p>Using the correct amount of flour is crucial in baking. Too much can make your dish dry and dense, while too little may cause it to fall apart. Air fryer recipes, in particular, rely on precise measurements for even cooking. A digital kitchen scale is the best tool for accuracy, but if you only have spoons, our conversion helps bridge the gap.

<p>Different types of flour, like plain or self-raising, have slight weight variations, but 5 tbsp generally averages around 40g. Scooping flour directly from the bag can compress it, leading to inaccurate measurements. Instead, spoon the flour lightly into the tablespoon and level it off for consistency. This method ensures your air fryer dishes turn out perfectly every time.</p>  

<h3>How to measure flour without a scale</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a scale, use the spoon-and-level method for the most accurate 5 tbsp flour to grams conversion. Gently spoon flour into the tablespoon until it’s heaping, then level it off with a straight edge. Avoid tapping or packing the flour down, as this adds extra weight.

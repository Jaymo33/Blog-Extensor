<p>0.375 cup of condensed milk equals approximately 3 ounces (3 oz) in weight. This conversion is essential for precise baking and cooking, especially when using an air fryer where measurements matter. Whether you're making desserts or sauces, knowing the exact weight ensures consistent results every time.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Using the correct amount of condensed milk can make or break your air fryer recipes. Too much can lead to overly sweet or soggy results, while too little might leave your dish lacking flavour. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we emphasise precision for the best outcomes. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> simplifies these calculations, so you never have to guess.</p>  

<p>Condensed milk is a staple in many air fryer desserts, from fudgy brownies to creamy cheesecakes. Measuring 0.375 cup (3 oz) correctly ensures your treats turn out perfectly every time. If you're exploring new recipes, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>dessert section</a> for inspiration.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure 0.375 Cup of Condensed Milk</h3>  
<p>To measure 0.375 cup of condensed milk, use a liquid measuring cup for accuracy. Fill it to the 3/8 cup mark or divide 1/2 cup slightly below halfway. For weight, a kitchen scale set to ounces will confirm you have exactly 3 oz. This method eliminates guesswork and guarantees consistency.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for 0.375 Cup Condensed Milk in Air Fryer Recipes</h2>  
<p>This measurement is often used in small-batch air fryer desserts or sauces. For example, a single-serving caramel drizzle or a mini cheesecake filling might call for 0.375 cup (3 oz) of condensed milk. It’s also handy for glazes or sweetening air-fried fruits like bananas or apples.</p>

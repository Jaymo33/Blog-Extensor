<h2>Why Measure Cooked Rice in Grams?</h2>  
<p>Measuring cooked rice in grams provides accuracy, especially for air fryer recipes where portion sizes matter. Unlike volume measurements, weight accounts for variations in rice density. This is particularly helpful for meal prepping or tracking nutritional intake. If you're new to air frying, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipes section</a> offers plenty of inspiration.</p>  

<p>Using grams also ensures consistency across different types of rice, from basmati to jasmine. Whether you're reheating leftovers or cooking from scratch, precise measurements lead to better results.

<h3>How to Measure 0.25 tbsp of Cooked Rice</h3>  
<p>To measure 0.25 tbsp of cooked rice, use a digital kitchen scale for the most accurate results. Lightly pack the rice into a measuring spoon, then weigh it to confirm it's around 3.75 grams. This method eliminates guesswork and ensures your air fryer dishes turn out perfectly every time.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for 0.25 tbsp of Cooked Rice</h2>  
<p>While 0.25 tbsp might seem like a small amount, it's perfect for garnishing dishes or adding texture to air fryer meals.

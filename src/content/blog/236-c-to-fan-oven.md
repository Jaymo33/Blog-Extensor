<p>236°C in a conventional oven converts to approximately 210°C in a fan oven. This 10-20°C reduction is standard for fan-assisted cooking, as the circulating air distributes heat more efficiently. Whether you're baking, roasting, or using an air fryer, understanding this conversion ensures perfectly cooked dishes every time.</p>

<h2>Why Fan Oven Temperatures Differ</h2>
<p>Fan ovens cook faster and more evenly than conventional ovens because the fan circulates hot air around the food. This means you can typically reduce the temperature by 10-20°C when converting from conventional to fan settings. For 236°C, we recommend setting your fan oven to 210°C for equivalent results. Many modern air fryers operate similarly to fan ovens, making this conversion useful for <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> too.</p>
<p>The science behind this lies in heat transfer efficiency. With forced convection (fan-assisted cooking), the moving air particles transfer thermal energy more effectively to your food's surface. This is why air fryers - essentially mini convection ovens - can achieve crispier results at slightly lower temperatures than traditional ovens. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more temperature adjustments.</p>

<h2>Applying 236°C Fan Settings in Cooking</h2>
<p>When a recipe calls for 236°C in a conventional oven, setting your fan oven to 210°C will yield similar results. This temperature is ideal for many cooking techniques. For instance, it's perfect for achieving crispy roast potatoes or golden-brown pastry. In an air fryer, you might even reduce it slightly further to 200°C due to the compact cooking space.</p>
<p>Different foods respond uniquely to fan oven temperatures. Baked goods like the cakes in our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>cake recipes collection</a> may need careful monitoring at this temperature. The circulating air can cause them to brown faster, so consider rotating pans or covering with foil if needed. For meats and vegetables, the fan setting helps achieve even cooking and better browning.</p>

<h3>Air Fryer Equivalent for 236°C</h3>
<p>Most air fryers operate similarly to fan ovens, so the 210°C setting applies. However, because air fryers are more efficient at heat transfer, you might find better results at 200°C. Always check food a few minutes early when adapting conventional oven recipes to air frying. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> features many recipes specifically tested for air fryer temperatures.</p>

<h2>Tips for Perfect Temperature Control</h2>
<p>Oven thermometers are invaluable for verifying your fan oven's accuracy. Place one on the middle rack to ensure your 210°C setting is true. For air fryers, remember that smaller batches cook more evenly at this temperature. Overcrowding can lead to uneven results, even with perfect temperature conversion.</p>
<p>When cooking frozen foods at this temperature, like those in our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/frozen-foods>frozen foods section</a>, you might need to adjust cooking times rather than temperatures. The fan setting will help achieve crispiness while ensuring thorough heating. Always preheat your fan oven or air fryer for about 5 minutes when cooking at 210°C for best results.</p>

<h3>Common Mistakes to Avoid</h3>
<p>One frequent error is forgetting to reduce the temperature when switching from conventional to fan oven settings. Another is assuming all ovens calibrate perfectly - yours might run hot or cold. Regular <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaning</a> also ensures accurate temperature readings and even cooking at 210°C.</p>

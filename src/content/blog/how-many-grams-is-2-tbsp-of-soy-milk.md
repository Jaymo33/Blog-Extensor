<p>2 tablespoons (tbsp) of soy milk weigh approximately 30 grams. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements can make all the difference. Whether you're whipping up a cake or a savoury dish, knowing the exact weight ensures consistency. For more air fryer conversions, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on even cooking, and incorrect measurements can throw off texture and taste. For example, using too much or too little soy milk in a batter can affect how it crisps up. That’s why converting 2 tbsp of soy milk to grams (30g) is so helpful. Many of our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> use grams for precision. It’s a small detail that makes a big difference.</p>  

<p>If you’re working with frozen ingredients, like those in our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/frozen-foods>frozen foods section</a>, precise measurements ensure even cooking. Soy milk is often used in vegan or dairy-free recipes, so getting the weight right is key. A digital kitchen scale is the best tool for this, but our conversion guide helps when you’re in a pinch.</p>  

<h2>How to measure 2 tbsp of soy milk without scales</h2>  
<p>Not everyone has a kitchen scale, so here’s how to measure 2 tbsp of soy milk accurately. Use a standard UK tablespoon (15ml) and fill it level to the brim twice. This will give you roughly 30 grams. Avoid heaping or scant tablespoons, as this can skew the measurement. For more tips, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning and usage guides</a> to keep your air fryer in top shape.</p>  

<h3>Common recipes using 2 tbsp of soy milk</h3>  
<p>Many air fryer recipes call for small amounts of soy milk, such as pancakes, muffins, or batters. For example, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>cake recipes</a> often use 2 tbsp (30g) of soy milk for moisture. It’s also great in savoury dishes like tofu marinades or creamy sauces. Knowing the gram equivalent helps adjust recipes effortlessly.</p>  

<h2>Converting other soy milk measurements</h2>  
<p>If your recipe calls for a different amount, here’s a quick reference: 1 tbsp of soy milk is about 15 grams, and 1 cup is roughly 240 grams. These conversions are handy for scaling recipes up or down.

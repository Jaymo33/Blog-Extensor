<p>1.25 cups of almonds equals approximately 5 ounces (oz). This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements ensure even cooking and perfect texture. Whether you're making almond-crusted chicken or a batch of homemade granola, knowing the exact weight helps avoid over or under-seasoning.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Almond Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>When using an air fryer, consistency is key. Too many almonds can overcrowd the basket, leading to uneven cooking, while too few may leave your dish lacking in flavour. For recipes like almond-crusted fish or roasted almonds, 1.25 cups (5 oz) is a common measurement.

<p>Almonds vary slightly in size, but standard US cups measure them at roughly 4 oz per cup. This means 1.25 cups of almonds translates to 5 oz. If you're in the UK, this conversion remains the same, as fluid ounces and weight ounces align closely for dry ingredients like nuts.</p>  

<h3>Converting Cups to Ounces for Different Almond Types</h3>  
<p>Whole, sliced, or slivered almonds have slightly different densities. Whole almonds weigh about 4 oz per cup, while sliced almonds may be closer to 3.5 oz due to air gaps. For 1.25 cups of sliced almonds, expect around 4.4 oz. Always check your recipe for specifics, especially for air fryer dishes like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>almond-crusted chicken</a>.</p>  

<h2>How to Measure Almonds Correctly</h2>  
<p>For the most accurate results, use a kitchen scale to weigh your almonds. If you don’t have one, lightly spoon almonds into a measuring cup without packing them down. Overfilling can add extra ounces, throwing off your recipe. Need more air fryer tips? Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a> for inspiration.</p>

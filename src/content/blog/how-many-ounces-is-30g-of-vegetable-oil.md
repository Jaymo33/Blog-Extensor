<p>30g of vegetable oil equals approximately 1.06 ounces. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements can make or break your dish. Whether you’re frying, baking, or roasting, knowing how to convert grams to ounces ensures consistency in your cooking. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we help you nail every recipe with accurate conversions and expert tips.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air frying</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on precise ingredient ratios to achieve the perfect texture and flavour. Too much or too little oil can affect crispiness and cooking times. For example, 30g of vegetable oil to ounces (1.06 oz) is a common measurement for coating vegetables or marinating proteins. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> simplifies these calculations, so you never have to guess.</p>  

<p>Using the right amount of oil also prevents excess smoke or uneven cooking. Many air fryer recipes, like crispy potatoes or chicken wings, call for 30g of vegetable oil to ensure even browning. If you’re unsure, a kitchen scale is your best friend—just weigh out 30g and convert it to ounces for clarity.</p>  

<h2>How to measure 30g of vegetable oil without a scale</h2>  
<p>Don’t have a scale? No problem. One tablespoon of vegetable oil weighs roughly 14g, so 30g is just over two tablespoons. For ounces, this translates to about 1.06 oz. Keep in mind that viscosity can vary slightly between oils, so this method is best for quick estimates. For precision, we recommend using a scale or checking our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe section</a> for foolproof measurements.</p>  

<h3>Common uses for 30g of vegetable oil in air fryers</h3>

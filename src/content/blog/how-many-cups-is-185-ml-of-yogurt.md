    "@type": "Answer",
    "text": "Yes, for yogurt, 185 ml is roughly equivalent to 185 grams because yogurt has a similar density to water. However, thicker yogurts like Greek yogurt may weigh slightly more due to lower water content. Always check your specific yogurt type if precision is crucial."

<p>185 ml of yogurt is approximately 0.78 cups in the US measurement system and roughly 0.65 cups in the UK. Whether you're baking a cake or preparing a marinade for your air fryer, getting the measurements right ensures perfect results every time. This guide will help you convert 185 ml of yogurt to cups accurately, so you never have to second-guess your recipes again.</p>  

<h2>Understanding Yogurt Measurements</h2>  
<p>When it comes to cooking and baking, precision matters. Yogurt is a common ingredient in everything from cakes to marinades, and knowing how to convert 185 ml of yogurt to cups can save you from kitchen mishaps. The difference between US and UK cup measurements can be confusing, but we’ll clarify both so you can follow any recipe with confidence. For more air fryer-friendly conversions, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>  

<p>In the US, a standard cup holds 240 ml, while in the UK, it’s 284 ml. This means 185 ml of yogurt translates to roughly 0.78 US cups or 0.65 UK cups. If you’re using an air fryer for recipes like yogurt-marinated chicken or baked goods, these conversions ensure your dish turns out just right. Always measure yogurt in a liquid measuring cup for the most accurate results.</p>  

<h3>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h3>  
<p>Air fryers rely on precise cooking times and ingredient ratios to deliver crispy, evenly cooked meals. Using too much or too little yogurt in a marinade or batter can affect texture and taste. For example, a yogurt-based coating for air-fried chicken needs the right consistency to adhere properly. If you’re exploring new recipes, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a> has plenty of inspiration.</p>  

<h2>Converting 185 ml of Yogurt for Baking</h2>  
<p>Baking is a science, and small measurement errors can lead to dense cakes or dry muffins. If a recipe calls for 185 ml of yogurt, knowing the cup equivalent helps streamline the process. For US bakers, 0.78 cups is close enough to ¾ cup plus a tablespoon. UK bakers can use just over ½ cup plus a teaspoon for similar accuracy.</p>  

<p>Yogurt adds moisture and tenderness to baked goods, making it a popular substitute for butter or oil in healthier recipes. If you’re adapting a traditional recipe for your air fryer, precise measurements ensure success. For more baking tips, browse our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>cake recipes</a> designed for air fryers.</p>  

<h3>Common Uses for 185 ml of Yogurt</h3>  
<p>Beyond baking, 185 ml of yogurt is perfect for marinades, dips, and even salad dressings. Its tangy flavour enhances dishes like air-fried lamb kebabs or crispy tofu. If you’re meal prepping, yogurt-based sauces keep well in the fridge. For quick cleanup, try our recommended <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner</a> to maintain your appliance.</p>  

<h2>Handy Tips for Measuring Yogurt</h2>  
<p>To measure 185 ml of yogurt accurately, use a liquid measuring cup with clear markings. If you don’t have one, a kitchen scale set to grams (since 185 ml of yogurt weighs about 185 grams) works too. Stirring the yogurt first ensures a consistent texture, especially if it’s been sitting in the fridge.</p>  

<p>For air fryer recipes, thicker yogurts like Greek yogurt are ideal because they cling better to ingredients. If a recipe calls for regular yogurt and you only have Greek, thin it slightly with milk or water. Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable recipes</a> for yogurt-based dips that pair perfectly with air-fried snacks.</p>

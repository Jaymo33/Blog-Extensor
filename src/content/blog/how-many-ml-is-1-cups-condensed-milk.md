<p>1.0 cups of condensed milk equals approximately 240 ml. This measurement is crucial for air fryer recipes, ensuring accuracy in baking and dessert preparation.

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Precision is key when using an air fryer, especially for baking and desserts. Too much or too little condensed milk can alter the texture and taste of your dish. For example, a slight variation in ml measurement can make your fudge too runny or your cake too dense. That’s why converting 1.0 cups of condensed milk to ml (240 ml) ensures consistency. Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more helpful tips.</p>  

<p>Air fryers cook food faster than conventional ovens, so precise measurements prevent overcooking or undercooking. If you’re adapting a traditional recipe for the air fryer, converting cups to ml is essential. This is particularly true for condensed milk, which is thicker and denser than regular milk. Visit <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>our recipe collection</a> for air fryer-friendly desserts that use condensed milk perfectly.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure Condensed Milk Correctly</h3>  
<p>To measure 1.0 cups of condensed milk accurately, use a liquid measuring cup with clear ml markings. Scoop the condensed milk gently to avoid air pockets, and level it off with a spatula. If you don’t have a measuring cup, a kitchen scale can help—240 ml of condensed milk weighs roughly 300 grams.

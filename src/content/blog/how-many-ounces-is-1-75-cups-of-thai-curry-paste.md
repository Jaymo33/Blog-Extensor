For precise measurements, always check the specific brand's packaging if available."

You can freeze 1.75 cup (14 ounce) batches or smaller amounts in ice cube trays (about 1 ounce per cube). When frozen solid, transfer the cubes to a freezer bag. This way, you'll always have the right amount ready for your next air fryer recipe without needing to measure each time."

<p>1.75 cups of thai curry paste equals approximately 14 ounces. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes, ensuring your dishes have the perfect balance of flavours. Whether you're making a fragrant curry or a spicy marinade, accurate measurements make all the difference. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we specialise in helping you get the most out of your air fryer with precise conversions. Keep reading to learn more about measuring thai curry paste and other ingredients.</p>

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>
<p>Getting the right amount of thai curry paste ensures your dish isn’t too overpowering or bland. Air fryers cook food quickly, so precise measurements help maintain consistency. Too much paste can lead to overly spicy results, while too little might leave your dish lacking flavour. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> makes it easy to switch between cups and ounces. This is especially useful for recipes that call for specific quantities of thai curry paste.</p>

<p>Thai curry paste is a concentrated ingredient, so even small measurement errors can affect the final dish. Whether you're cooking chicken, shrimp, or vegetables in your air fryer, the right amount of paste ensures authentic flavours. For more recipe ideas, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipes</a> section. Accurate conversions like 1.75 cups to ounces help you replicate restaurant-quality meals at home.</p>

<h3>How to measure thai curry paste correctly</h3>
<p>Use a liquid measuring cup for thai curry paste, as it’s thick and sticky. Scoop the paste into the cup and level it off with a knife for an exact measurement. If you don’t have measuring cups, a kitchen scale set to ounces will do the trick. Remember, 1.75 cups of thai curry paste converts to roughly 14 ounces. This method works for both homemade and store-bought pastes, ensuring consistency every time.</p>

<h2>Common uses for thai curry paste in air fryer recipes</h2>
<p>Thai curry paste is incredibly versatile in air fryer cooking. It works well as a marinade for proteins like chicken, beef, or tofu. You can also mix it with coconut milk for a quick sauce to drizzle over air-fried vegetables. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipes section</a> features plenty of ideas to put your 1.75 cups (14 ounces) of paste to good use. From spicy wings to fragrant rice dishes, the possibilities are endless.</p>

<p>Another great way to use thai curry paste is in air-fried seafood dishes. Try coating shrimp or cod with a thin layer of paste before cooking for an extra kick. The high heat of the air fryer caramelises the paste, deepening its flavours. For more inspiration, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/shrimp>shrimp recipes</a>. Remember, 1.75 cups equals 14 ounces, so you can easily scale recipes up or down as needed.</p>

<h3>Storing leftover thai curry paste</h3>
<p>If you have leftover thai curry paste after measuring out 1.75 cups (14 ounces), proper storage is key. Transfer it to an airtight container and refrigerate for up to a month. You can also freeze portions in ice cube trays for easy future use. This way, you’ll always have the right amount on hand for impromptu air fryer meals.

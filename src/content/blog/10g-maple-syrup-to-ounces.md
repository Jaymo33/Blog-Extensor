<p>10g of maple syrup equals approximately 0.35 ounces. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements can make or break your dish. Whether you’re drizzling it over air-fried pancakes or using it as a glaze for chicken, knowing the exact weight ensures perfect results every time. For more handy conversions, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on even cooking, and small discrepancies in ingredient weights can affect texture and flavour. Maple syrup, being a sticky liquid, can be tricky to measure by volume alone. That’s why weighing it in grams or ounces ensures consistency. If you’re prepping a batch of air-fried desserts, like our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert recipes</a>, precise syrup measurements prevent overly sweet or dry results.</p>  

<p>Using a digital kitchen scale is the best way to measure 10g of maple syrup accurately. If you don’t have one, a standard teaspoon holds roughly 7g, so 10g is just under 1.5 teaspoons. However, for recipes requiring exact ratios, sticking to weight measurements is ideal. For more tips on perfecting air fryer meals, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a>.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure Maple Syrup Without a Scale</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a scale, you can estimate 10g of maple syrup using household spoons. A tablespoon typically holds about 20g, so half a tablespoon will get you close. For sticky ingredients like syrup, lightly greasing the spoon helps it slide off easily. Remember, these are rough estimates—investing in a scale guarantees precision, especially for baking.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for 10g of Maple Syrup in Air Fryer Recipes</h2>  
<p>Maple syrup isn’t just for pancakes—it’s a versatile sweetener in air fryer cooking. A 10g portion is perfect for glazing air-fried bacon, sweetening oatmeal, or adding a caramelised touch to roasted vegetables. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/breakfast>breakfast recipes</a> for creative ways to incorporate this golden syrup.</p>  

<p>You can also mix 10g of maple syrup with mustard or soy sauce for a quick marinade. Its natural sweetness balances savoury flavours, making it a staple in many <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipes</a>. Since air fryers circulate hot air efficiently, glazes caramelise beautifully without burning—just keep an eye on cooking times.</p>  

<h3>Storing Maple Syrup for Long-Term Use</h3>  
<p>Pure maple syrup lasts months in the fridge, so you can measure out 10g portions as needed. To prevent mould, always use clean utensils and store it in an airtight container. If your syrup crystallises, gently warm it in a water bath to restore its smooth texture.</p>

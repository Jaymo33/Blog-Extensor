<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on even cooking, and small discrepancies in ingredient weights can affect texture and flavour. Maple syrup, being a sticky liquid, can be tricky to measure by volume alone. That’s why weighing it in grams or ounces ensures consistency. If you’re prepping a batch of air-fried desserts, like our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert recipes</a>, precise syrup measurements prevent overly sweet or dry results.</p>  

<p>Using a digital kitchen scale is the best way to measure 10g of maple syrup accurately. If you don’t have one, a standard teaspoon holds roughly 7g, so 10g is just under 1.5 teaspoons. However, for recipes requiring exact ratios, sticking to weight measurements is ideal.

<h3>How to Measure Maple Syrup Without a Scale</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a scale, you can estimate 10g of maple syrup using household spoons. A tablespoon typically holds about 20g, so half a tablespoon will get you close. For sticky ingredients like syrup, lightly greasing the spoon helps it slide off easily. Remember, these are rough estimates—investing in a scale guarantees precision, especially for baking.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for 10g of Maple Syrup in Air Fryer Recipes</h2>

<h3>Storing Maple Syrup for Long-Term Use</h3>

<h2>Why Accurate Sugar Measurements Matter</h2>
<p>Granulated sugar is a staple in baking, and even small measurement errors can affect texture and taste. Too much sugar can make desserts overly sweet or cause them to brown too quickly in the air fryer. Too little can result in a dry or crumbly finish. That's why converting 450 grams of granulated sugar to cups correctly is so important. Whether you're making <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>air fryer cakes</a> or cookies, precision is key. Always use a kitchen scale for the most accurate results.</p>

<p>If you don’t have a scale, spooning the sugar into a measuring cup and levelling it off works too. Avoid packing the sugar down, as this can lead to over-measuring. For air fryer recipes, consistency is everything, and proper measurements ensure even cooking. Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a> for more inspiration on using granulated sugar in your air fryer creations.</p>

<h2>UK vs. US Cup Measurements</h2>
<p>It’s worth noting that UK and US cup measurements differ slightly. In the UK, 1 cup of granulated sugar is about 200 grams, while in the US, it’s approximately 212 grams. This means 450 grams of granulated sugar converts to 2.25 cups in the UK and 2.12 cups in the US. Always check which measurement system your recipe uses to avoid confusion.</p>

<p>For air fryer baking, these small differences can impact the final result. If you’re adapting a recipe from another country, double-check the conversions.

<h3>Tips for Measuring Granulated Sugar</h3>
<p>For the best results, use a kitchen scale to measure 450 grams of granulated sugar directly. If you’re using cups, fluff the sugar first to prevent compaction. Spoon it into the cup gently and level it off with a straight edge. Never scoop directly from the bag, as this can pack the sugar and lead to over-measuring.</p>

<p>5 grams (5g) of lemon juice equals approximately 0.18 ounces (0.18 oz). This conversion is essential for precise cooking, especially when using an air fryer where ingredient accuracy can impact texture and flavour. Whether you're whipping up a zesty marinade or adding a tangy twist to desserts, knowing how to convert 5g lemon juice to ounces ensures consistency in your recipes.</p>  

<h2>Why Convert 5g of Lemon Juice to Ounces?</h2>  
<p>Many UK recipes, especially those for air fryers, list ingredients in grams, while some cooks prefer using ounces for measurement. Converting 5g of lemon juice to ounces (0.18 oz) helps bridge this gap. If you're following an air fryer recipe from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, this conversion ensures you add just the right amount of citrusy brightness.</p>  

<p>Lemon juice is a versatile ingredient, often used in marinades, dressings, and even baked goods. Whether you're preparing a <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken dish</a> or a light dessert, precise measurements matter. Too much lemon juice can overpower a dish, while too little might leave it lacking that fresh zing.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure 5g of Lemon Juice Accurately</h3>  
<p>For the most accurate conversion of 5g lemon juice to ounces, use a digital kitchen scale set to grams. If your scale displays ounces, it should read around 0.18 oz. Alternatively, you can use measuring spoons—5g is roughly one teaspoon of lemon juice, though this can vary slightly depending on the lemon's ripeness and juiciness.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for 5g of Lemon Juice in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>In air fryer recipes, 5g of lemon juice (0.18 oz) is often used to add acidity and brightness. It’s perfect for light coatings on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>roasted vegetables</a> or as part of a marinade for proteins. The air fryer’s rapid circulation enhances the lemon’s flavour, making even small amounts impactful.</p>  

<p>You might also find 5g of lemon juice in dressings for air-fried salads or as a finishing touch on seafood dishes. For more inspiration, check out the <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> to adjust other measurements seamlessly.</p>  

<h3>Does Lemon Juice Weight Change When Cooked?</h3>  
<p>When heated in an air fryer, lemon juice reduces slightly due to evaporation, but the weight difference for 5g is minimal. If using it in a sauce or glaze, account for this by adding a tiny bit extra if needed. Always taste as you go to balance flavours perfectly.</p>  

<h2>Tips for Storing and Using Lemon Juice</h2>  
<p>Freshly squeezed lemon juice is best for accuracy when measuring 5g (0.18 oz). Store leftover juice in an airtight container in the fridge for up to a week. For longer storage, freeze lemon juice in ice cube trays—each cube is roughly 15g, so you can thaw a third for 5g portions.</p>  

<p>If you’re using bottled lemon juice, check the label for additives, as these can affect taste and measurement accuracy. For more air fryer tips, explore <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> to make the most of your cooking adventures.</p>

<p>235 ml of double cream is approximately 1 cup in standard US measurements, or just under 1 cup (0.99 cups) for precise conversions. This measurement is essential for baking, cooking, and especially when using an air fryer to ensure perfect consistency in your recipes. Whether you're whipping up a creamy sauce or a decadent dessert, knowing the exact conversion helps avoid kitchen mishaps.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of double cream can make or break a recipe. Too little, and your dish might lack richness; too much, and it could become overly heavy. For air fryer recipes, precise measurements ensure even cooking and perfect texture. If you're following a recipe from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, getting the conversion right guarantees the best results every time.</p>  

<p>Double cream is thicker than single cream, so its volume-to-weight ratio differs slightly. While 235 ml is roughly 1 cup, slight variations can occur based on temperature and density. For air fryer baking, sticking to exact measurements ensures your cakes, custards, or sauces turn out just right.</p>  

<h3>Converting 235 ml of Double Cream in Different Cup Sizes</h3>  
<p>Not all cups are created equal. A US cup measures 240 ml, while a UK cup is 284 ml. This means 235 ml of double cream is closer to 1 US cup but about 0.83 UK cups. If your recipe uses metric measurements, sticking to millilitres avoids confusion.

<h2>Using Double Cream in Air Fryer Recipes</h2>  
<p>Double cream adds richness to air fryer dishes like creamy pasta bakes, custards, or even mashed potatoes. Since air fryers cook faster than conventional ovens, measuring ingredients accurately prevents overcooking or splitting. For example, a splash too much cream in a sauce could make it too runny under high heat.</p>

<h3>Tips for Measuring Double Cream</h3>  
<p>For the most accurate measurement, use a liquid measuring cup and check at eye level. If you don’t have one, a kitchen scale can help—235 ml of double cream weighs about 235 grams. Avoid scooping with dry measuring cups, as this can compress the cream and lead to inaccuracies.</p>  

<h2>Common Recipes Using 235 ml of Double Cream</h2>  
<p>From savoury to sweet, double cream is a versatile ingredient. Try it in air fryer carbonara, creamy mushroom sauces, or even whipped cream for desserts. Many <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert recipes</a> call for this exact amount, ensuring a luscious texture without being overly heavy.</p>  

<p>For a quick treat, whip 235 ml of double cream with a bit of sugar and vanilla, then pipe it onto air-fried fruit or cakes. Since air fryers circulate hot air, creamy elements need precise measurements to maintain stability. Too much liquid can lead to soggy results, so stick to 1 cup (235 ml) for perfect outcomes.</p>  

<h3>Storing Leftover Double Cream</h3>  
<p>If you have extra double cream, store it in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 3 days. You can also freeze it for later use in cooked dishes, though it may separate when thawed.

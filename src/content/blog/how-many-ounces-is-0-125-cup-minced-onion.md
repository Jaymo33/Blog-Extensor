<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on even cooking, and incorrect ingredient quantities can throw off the balance.

<p>Minced onion is a common ingredient in many dishes, from meatloaf to stir-fries. Its fine texture means it distributes evenly, but this also makes measuring by weight more reliable than volume.

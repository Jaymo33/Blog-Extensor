<p id="">164 C converts to Gas Mark 3, a moderate oven temperature perfect for slow roasting, baking, and air frying. This temperature is commonly used for dishes that need gentle, even cooking without browning too quickly. Whether you're using a conventional oven or an air fryer, knowing how to convert 164 C to Gas Mark ensures your recipes turn out perfectly every time. At <a href="https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk" id="">airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we specialise in helping you master these conversions for fuss-free cooking.</p><h2 id="">Why 164 C to Gas Mark Matters</h2><p id="">Gas Mark 3 (164 C) is a versatile temperature for many recipes, from cakes to roasted meats. It’s low enough to prevent burning but high enough to cook food thoroughly. In an air fryer, 164 C works well for reheating, baking, or slow-cooking delicate items like soufflés. Many British recipes, especially older ones, still use Gas Mark, so knowing how to convert 164 C to Gas Mark is essential. Check out our <a href="https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart" id="">air fryer conversion chart</a> for more handy temperature guides.</p><p id="">If you’re adapting an oven recipe for an air fryer, 164 C (Gas Mark 3) often requires slight timing adjustments. Air fryers circulate heat more efficiently, so cooking times may be shorter. For example, a Victoria sponge that takes 25 minutes in an oven at 164 C might need just 18–20 minutes in an air fryer. Always keep an eye on your dish the first time you try a new temperature conversion.</p><h2 id="">How to Convert 164 C to Gas Mark</h2><p id="">Converting 164 C to Gas Mark is straightforward: it’s Gas Mark 3. This applies to both fan and conventional ovens, though fan ovens may cook faster. For air fryers, which typically use Celsius, 164 C is a common setting for gentle cooking. If your air fryer has a Gas Mark equivalent, it’s likely labelled as ‘Moderate’ or ‘3’. Our <a href="https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes" id="">recipe collection</a> includes many dishes tested at this temperature.</p><h3 id="">Common Uses for 164 C (Gas Mark 3)</h3><p id="">This temperature is ideal for baking light cakes, slow-roasting vegetables, or reheating leftovers without drying them out. Try it for classics like lemon drizzle cake or roasted root vegetables. For air fryer users, 164 C works beautifully for <a href="https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes" id="">cake recipes</a> that need even rising without a crispy top. It’s also great for proofing dough or warming bread.</p><h2 id="">Air Fryer Tips for 164 C</h2><p id="">When using 164 C in an air fryer, preheat for 3–5 minutes to ensure even cooking. Smaller air fryers may need a lower temperature or shorter time, so adjust accordingly. For foods that dry out easily, like fish or tofu, cover loosely with foil. Explore our <a href="https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables" id="">vegetable recipes</a> for ideas on using 164 C to roast peppers or mushrooms to perfection.</p><p id="">Cleaning your air fryer after cooking at 164 C is easier since lower temperatures reduce splattering. A quick wipe with our recommended <a href="https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner" id="">air fryer cleaner</a> keeps it in top condition. Remember, 164 C to Gas Mark conversions are just as important for maintenance as they are for cooking—knowing your appliance’s settings ensures longevity.</p><h3 id="">When to Avoid 164 C</h3><p id="">While 164 C (Gas Mark 3) is versatile, it’s too low for crisping fried foods or searing meats. For crispy chips or chicken wings, you’ll need 180–200 C. However, 164 C is perfect for finishing dishes that might burn at higher heats, like glazed ham or fruit crumbles.</p>

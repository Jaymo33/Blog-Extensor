<p>150g of lemon juice is approximately 5.29 ounces. This conversion is essential for anyone using UK measurements in their air fryer recipes, ensuring accuracy for the perfect dish. Whether you're marinating chicken or adding a citrusy kick to desserts, knowing how to convert grams to ounces is a kitchen must.</p>

<h2>Why converting 150g of lemon juice to ounces matters</h2>
<p>Precision is key in cooking, especially when using an air fryer. Lemon juice can make or break a recipe, and measuring it correctly ensures balanced flavours. Many UK recipes, like those on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, list ingredients in grams, but some cooks prefer ounces. Converting 150g of lemon juice to ounces (5.29 oz) helps maintain consistency across different measurement systems.</p>
<p>Air fryers cook food quickly, so getting the lemon juice quantity right prevents over-seasoning or dryness. Whether you're making lemon-infused salmon or a zesty glaze for air-fried chicken, accurate measurements guarantee perfect results every time.

<h2>How to measure 150g of lemon juice accurately</h2>
<p>For precise measurements, use digital kitchen scales set to grams. Squeeze fresh lemons until the scale reads 150g, then note the equivalent in ounces (5.29 oz). If you don't have scales, roughly 5-6 medium lemons yield 150g of juice. However, scales are more reliable for consistent results in air fryer cooking.</p>
<p>Bottled lemon juice can also be used, but check the label for concentration differences. Some brands may require adjusting quantities slightly. For perfect air fryer dishes like lemon drizzle cake or citrus-marinated tofu, always measure carefully.

<h3>Common uses for 150g of lemon juice in air fryer recipes</h3>
<p>150g (5.29 oz) of lemon juice is perfect for marinating 4 chicken breasts or adding tang to a batch of air-fried vegetables. It's also ideal for making glazes or dressings to accompany air-fried fish like cod or salmon. The acidity helps tenderise meats while adding bright flavour notes.</p>

<h3>Storing leftover lemon juice</h3>
<p>If your recipe doesn't use all 150g, store leftover juice in an airtight container in the fridge for up to a week. Alternatively, freeze it in ice cube trays for future air fryer recipes. Each cube typically holds about 15g (0.5 oz), making it easy to portion out when needed.</p>

<p>Using the correct amount of cornflour ensures your air fryer dishes have the right texture and consistency. Too much or too little can affect the outcome, whether you're making fried chicken or tempura vegetables. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we recommend weighing ingredients for the best results.

<h2>How to Measure 500g of Cornflour Accurately</h2>
<p>To measure 500g of cornflour accurately, use a digital kitchen scale set to grams. If your scale only measures in ounces, you'll need to convert 500g to 17.64 ounces. Scoop the cornflour into your measuring container until the scale reaches the desired weight. Avoid packing the cornflour down, as this can lead to over-measuring.

<h3>Using Measuring Cups for Cornflour</h3>
<p>While weighing is the most accurate method, you can use measuring cups if you don't have a scale. One cup of cornflour weighs approximately 125g, so 500g would be roughly 4 cups. However, this method is less precise due to variations in how cornflour settles. For best results in your air fryer recipes, stick to weighing whenever possible.</p>

<h3>Why Cornflour Works So Well in Air Fryers</h3>
<p>Cornflour is particularly effective in air fryers because it creates an exceptionally crisp coating. It has a finer texture than regular flour and doesn't contain gluten, which can sometimes make coatings tough. When used in air fryer recipes, cornflour helps moisture evaporate quickly, resulting in that desirable crunch. It's also great for creating light, tempura-style batters that cook evenly in the air fryer's circulating heat.</p>

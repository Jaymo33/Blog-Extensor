<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Precision is key when using an air fryer, as even small deviations can affect texture and cooking time. Tomato sauce, for instance, can thicken or thin out if the quantity isn’t measured correctly. Using 240 ml (1.0 cups) ensures consistency, whether you’re coating chicken, layering lasagne, or creating a dipping sauce. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> simplifies these calculations, so you never have to second-guess.</p>

Measuring 1.0 cups (240 ml) accurately prevents your dish from becoming too dry or overly saucy.

<h3>UK vs. US Cup Measurements</h3>  
<p>While 1.0 UK cup is roughly 284 ml, most modern recipes—including those on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>—use the US standard (240 ml per cup). Always confirm which measurement system your recipe follows to avoid discrepancies. This is especially important for baking, where precision is non-negotiable.</p>  

<h2>How to Measure Tomato Sauce Without a Measuring Cup</h2>  
<p>If you don’t have a measuring cup handy, you can use a kitchen scale for accuracy. Since tomato sauce has a similar density to water, 240 ml weighs approximately 240 grams. Alternatively, a standard UK tablespoon holds 15 ml, so 16 tablespoons equal 1.0 cups (240 ml). This method works well for smaller batches or when adjusting recipes on the fly.</p>  
<p>For sticky sauces like tomato, lightly greasing your measuring cup or spoon ensures the sauce slides out cleanly. This trick is handy when prepping freezer-friendly meals from our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/meal-prep>meal prep category</a>, where exact portions matter.</p>

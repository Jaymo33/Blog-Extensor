<p>1.0 cups of tomato sauce equals 240 millilitres (ml). This standard conversion is essential for air fryer recipes, ensuring your dishes turn out perfectly every time. Whether you’re making a rich pasta sauce or a flavourful marinade, knowing the exact ml measurement helps avoid guesswork. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we prioritise accuracy to help you achieve restaurant-quality results at home.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Precision is key when using an air fryer, as even small deviations can affect texture and cooking time. Tomato sauce, for instance, can thicken or thin out if the quantity isn’t measured correctly. Using 240 ml (1.0 cups) ensures consistency, whether you’re coating chicken, layering lasagne, or creating a dipping sauce. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> simplifies these calculations, so you never have to second-guess.</p>  
<p>Many air fryer recipes, like stuffed peppers or meatball dishes, rely on tomato sauce for moisture and flavour. Measuring 1.0 cups (240 ml) accurately prevents your dish from becoming too dry or overly saucy. For more recipe ideas, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> collection, where precise measurements are always highlighted.</p>  

<h3>UK vs. US Cup Measurements</h3>  
<p>While 1.0 UK cup is roughly 284 ml, most modern recipes—including those on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>—use the US standard (240 ml per cup). Always confirm which measurement system your recipe follows to avoid discrepancies. This is especially important for baking, where precision is non-negotiable.</p>  

<h2>How to Measure Tomato Sauce Without a Measuring Cup</h2>  
<p>If you don’t have a measuring cup handy, you can use a kitchen scale for accuracy. Since tomato sauce has a similar density to water, 240 ml weighs approximately 240 grams. Alternatively, a standard UK tablespoon holds 15 ml, so 16 tablespoons equal 1.0 cups (240 ml). This method works well for smaller batches or when adjusting recipes on the fly.</p>  
<p>For sticky sauces like tomato, lightly greasing your measuring cup or spoon ensures the sauce slides out cleanly. This trick is handy when prepping freezer-friendly meals from our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/meal-prep>meal prep category</a>, where exact portions matter.</p>  

<h3>Common Recipes Using 1.0 Cups (240 ml) of Tomato Sauce</h3>  
<p>Many air fryer favourites call for this quantity, from homemade pizza sauce to shakshuka. A classic example is air-fryer meatballs, where 240 ml of tomato sauce creates the perfect glaze. Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipes</a> for dishes like saucy drumsticks or marinades that use this measurement.</p>  

<h2>Cleaning Tips After Handling Tomato Sauce</h2>  
<p>Tomato sauce can leave stubborn stains in your air fryer basket. To keep it spotless, wipe the basket with warm, soapy water immediately after use. For baked-on residue, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner guide</a> offers step-by-step solutions. Regular maintenance ensures your appliance stays in top condition for precise cooking.</p>  
<p>Storing leftover tomato sauce? An airtight container in the fridge preserves freshness for up to five days. You can also freeze portions in 240 ml (1.0 cups) batches for future recipes—ideal for quick weeknight dinners.</p>

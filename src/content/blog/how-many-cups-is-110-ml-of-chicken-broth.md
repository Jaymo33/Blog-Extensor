<p>110 ml of chicken broth equals approximately 0.46 cups (just under half a cup). Whether you're prepping a sauce, marinade, or soup in your air fryer, getting the measurement right ensures your dish turns out perfectly every time. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we know how frustrating inaccurate conversions can be, so we’ve simplified it for you.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>
<p>Air fryers rely on precise cooking conditions to deliver crispy, evenly cooked meals. Using the correct amount of liquid, like 110 ml of chicken broth, prevents dishes from becoming too dry or soggy. Whether you're making a gravy or braising chicken, the right balance of broth enhances flavour and texture.

<p>Recipes often list ingredients in millilitres or cups, and converting between the two can be tricky. A slight miscalculation—like mistaking 110 ml of chicken broth for a full cup—could throw off your entire dish. That’s why we recommend using measuring jugs with both metric and imperial markings for foolproof results.</p>

<h2>How to Measure 110 ml of Chicken Broth Without a Scale</h2>
<p>If you don’t have a measuring jug handy, you can still measure 110 ml of chicken broth accurately. A standard metric tablespoon holds 15 ml, so 7 tablespoons plus 1 teaspoon will give you roughly 110 ml. Alternatively, a US liquid measuring cup’s ½-cup mark is 118 ml—close enough for most recipes.</p>

<h3>Common Uses for 110 ml of Chicken Broth in Air Fryer Recipes</h3>
<p>This amount is perfect for deglazing pans, creating light sauces, or adding moisture to <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken dishes</a>. Try it in air-fryer risottos, stews, or even as a base for marinades. The subtle savoury flavour of chicken broth elevates simple ingredients without overpowering them.</p>

<h2>Converting 110 ml of Chicken Broth for UK vs US Recipes</h2>
<p>In the UK, 1 cup equals 284 ml, while in the US, it’s 236 ml. This means 110 ml of chicken broth translates to 0.39 UK cups or 0.46 US cups. Always check which measurement system your recipe uses—our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a> specifies both for clarity.</p>

<p>For bakers, this small difference can impact outcomes. When adapting American recipes, reduce other liquids slightly if using UK cups to account for the variance. Conversely, British recipes converted to US measurements may need a touch more liquid to maintain consistency.</p>

<h3>Tips for Storing Leftover Chicken Broth</h3>
<p>After measuring out 110 ml, store any remaining broth in an airtight container for up to 4 days. Freeze it in ice cube trays (each cube is ~30 ml) for easy future use. This way, you’ll always have pre-measured portions ready for quick <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleanup</a> and cooking.</p>

<p>560 ml of half and half equals approximately 2.37 cups in the US measurement system and 2.46 cups in the UK. This conversion is essential for baking and cooking, especially when using an air fryer where precise measurements matter. Whether you're whipping up a creamy sauce or a decadent dessert, knowing how to convert ml to cups ensures your dish turns out perfectly every time.</p>

<h2>Understanding Half And Half Measurements</h2>  
<p>Half and half is a dairy product made by combining equal parts whole milk and cream. It's commonly used in recipes to add richness without being as heavy as pure cream. When converting 560 ml of half and half to cups, it's important to note that US and UK cup measurements differ slightly. In the US, 1 cup is 240 ml, while in the UK, it's 250 ml. This small difference can affect your recipe, so always double-check which measurement system you're using.</p>  
<p>For air fryer recipes, precision is key to achieving the right texture and consistency. Whether you're making a creamy pasta sauce or a fluffy cake, knowing how many cups 560 ml of half and half equals ensures your dish turns out just right.

<h2>Why Accurate Conversions Matter</h2>  
<p>Using the correct amount of half and half can make or break your recipe. Too much can make your dish overly rich, while too little might leave it lacking in flavour. For air fryer cooking, where heat distribution is rapid, precise measurements help avoid undercooked or overcooked results. Whether you're making a savoury dish like creamy mushrooms or a sweet treat like custard, accuracy is crucial.</p>

If you don't have measuring tools, remember that 560 ml is just over 2 US cups or 2.5 UK cups. This method works well for air fryer recipes, where consistency is key.</p>

<h2>Common Uses for Half And Half in Air Fryer Recipes</h2>

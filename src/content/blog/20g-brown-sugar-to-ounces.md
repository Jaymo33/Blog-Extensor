<p>20g of brown sugar equals approximately 0.71 ounces. This conversion is handy for air fryer recipes where precision matters, especially when baking cakes or cookies. Whether you're using a digital scale or measuring cups, knowing this conversion ensures your treats turn out perfectly every time. For more air fryer measurement tips, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Baking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers cook food faster and more evenly than conventional ovens, so precise measurements are crucial. Too much or too little sugar can affect texture, browning, and even cooking times. Brown sugar, in particular, adds moisture and richness to baked goods, so getting the amount right is key. If you're new to air fryer baking, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> for foolproof ideas.</p>  
<p>Using a kitchen scale is the most accurate way to measure 20g of brown sugar, but if you don’t have one, spooning the sugar lightly into a measuring cup works too. Just avoid packing it down, as this can lead to over-measuring. For more tips on perfecting air fryer desserts, browse our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>cake recipes</a>.</p>  

<h2>How to Convert 20g of Brown Sugar to Ounces</h2>  
<p>Converting grams to ounces is straightforward: 1 gram equals 0.035 ounces. So, 20g multiplied by 0.035 gives you 0.71 ounces. This conversion is especially useful for UK bakers following American recipes, which often use ounces or cups. Keep our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a> bookmarked for quick reference.</p>  

<h3>Using a Digital Scale for Precision</h3>  
<p>A digital scale is the best tool for measuring 20g of brown sugar accurately. Simply place your bowl on the scale, tare it to zero, and add the sugar until it hits 20g. This method eliminates guesswork and ensures consistent results in your air fryer bakes.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for 20g of Brown Sugar in Air Fryer Recipes</h2>  
<p>20g of brown sugar is a common measurement in small-batch air fryer desserts, like mug cakes or cookie dough bites. It’s also perfect for glazes or rubs for meats like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>air fryer chicken</a>. The caramel-like flavour of brown sugar enhances both sweet and savoury dishes.</p>  
<p>If you're reheating desserts in your air fryer, a sprinkle of brown sugar can revive their texture. Just remember to clean your air fryer afterward—sticky sugar residues can build up. Our guide on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning your air fryer</a> has all the tips you need.</p>  

<h3>Substitutes for Brown Sugar in a Pinch</h3>  
<p>If you’re out of brown sugar, mix 20g of white sugar with ½ teaspoon of molasses for a similar flavour. This hack works well in air fryer recipes where moisture and depth are key, like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cookies>cookies</a> or granola.</p>

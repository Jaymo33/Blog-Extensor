<p>135 ml of heavy cream is approximately 0.57 cups. This conversion is essential for precise baking and cooking, especially when using an air fryer where measurements can make or break a recipe. Whether you're whipping up a creamy dessert or a rich sauce, knowing this conversion ensures consistency every time.</p>

<h2>Understanding the Conversion</h2>
<p>Converting millilitres to cups can be tricky, especially with ingredients like heavy cream, which has a different density than water. For 135 ml of heavy cream, the exact measurement is roughly 0.57 cups. This is based on the standard US cup measurement, which is 240 ml per cup. If you're using a UK metric cup, which is 250 ml, the conversion would be slightly different.</p>
<p>When working with an air fryer, precise measurements are crucial. Too much or too little heavy cream can affect the texture and cooking time of your dish. For example, adding too much cream to a batter might make it too runny, while too little could dry it out. Always measure carefully for the best results.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter</h2>
<p>Heavy cream is a staple in many recipes, from soups to desserts. Using the right amount ensures your dish turns out as intended. For air fryer recipes, like those on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, accuracy is key to achieving the perfect crispiness or tenderness.</p>
<p>In baking, even small deviations can lead to significant changes in texture and taste. For instance, if you're making a cake in your air fryer, the wrong amount of heavy cream could result in a dense or dry cake. Always double-check your measurements to avoid disappointment.</p>

<h3>Tools for Measuring Heavy Cream</h3>
<p>A liquid measuring cup is the best tool for measuring 135 ml of heavy cream. These cups usually have markings for both millilitres and cups, making conversions easy. If you don't have one, a kitchen scale can also be used. Simply weigh the cream and convert grams to cups using a conversion chart.</p>

<h3>Common Uses for 135 ml of Heavy Cream</h3>
<p>This amount of heavy cream is perfect for small batches of sauces, soups, or desserts. For example, you might use it in a creamy pasta sauce or a small batch of whipped cream for topping desserts. Check out <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert recipes</a> on our site for inspiration.</p>

<h2>Converting Other Measurements</h2>
<p>If you need to convert other amounts of heavy cream, a general rule is that 1 cup equals 240 ml. So, for 135 ml, you'd divide by 240 to get 0.57 cups. This method works for any liquid ingredient, though densities may vary slightly.</p>
<p>For more conversions, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> is a handy resource. It covers everything from temperatures to weights, making it easier to adapt recipes for your air fryer.</p>

<h3>Tips for Working with Heavy Cream</h3>
<p>Heavy cream can be temperamental, especially when whipping. Make sure it's cold before whipping, and avoid overmixing. For air fryer recipes, consider using a liner to prevent spills and make cleanup easier.

<p>10 grams of soy milk is approximately 0.35 ounces. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements can make all the difference. Whether you're whipping up a creamy sauce or a light batter, knowing how to convert grams to ounces ensures consistency in your cooking. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we understand the importance of accuracy, especially when working with plant-based ingredients like soy milk.</p>  

<h2>Why Convert 10g of Soy Milk to Ounces?</h2>  
<p>Many UK recipes, especially those for air fryers, use metric measurements like grams. However, some kitchen scales or international recipes might list ingredients in ounces. Converting 10g of soy milk to ounces (0.35 oz) helps avoid guesswork and guarantees the right texture and flavour in your dishes. For more conversions, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>  

<p>Soy milk is a popular dairy alternative in air fryer cooking, often used in vegan desserts or light batters. Whether you're making tofu scrambles or dairy-free cakes, precise measurements ensure your dish turns out perfectly. If you're exploring more plant-based recipes, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/tofu>tofu category</a> has plenty of inspiration.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure 10g of Soy Milk Accurately</h3>  
<p>For the most accurate measurement, use a digital kitchen scale set to grams. If your scale only displays ounces, simply multiply the grams by 0.035 to get the equivalent in ounces. For 10g of soy milk, this calculation gives you 0.35 ounces. This method works for all liquid ingredients, ensuring your air fryer recipes are spot-on every time.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for 10g of Soy Milk in Air Fryer Recipes</h2>  
<p>Small quantities of soy milk, like 10g (0.35 oz), are often used in glazes, thin batters, or marinades. For example, a light brushing of soy milk can help breadcrumbs adhere to tofu or vegetables before air frying. Discover more creative uses in our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a>.</p>  

<p>Another great application is in dairy-free baking. A small amount of soy milk can moisten mixtures without overwhelming the flavour. Whether you're making vegan cookies or a fluffy cake, 10g of soy milk can be the perfect addition.

<h3>Tips for Working with Soy Milk in Your Air Fryer</h3>  
<p>Soy milk behaves similarly to dairy milk in most recipes, but it’s slightly thinner. If a recipe calls for 10g of soy milk (0.35 oz), you can usually substitute it directly for dairy milk. Just be mindful of cooking times, as soy milk may brown faster due to its sugar content. Always preheat your air fryer for even results.</p>

<p>500 grams of powdered milk equals approximately 17.64 ounces. This conversion is essential for anyone using an air fryer, as precise measurements can make or break a recipe. Whether you’re whipping up a cake or preparing a creamy sauce, knowing the exact weight ensures consistency. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we focus on helping you achieve culinary perfection with accurate conversions and tips.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on precise ingredient ratios to deliver even cooking and perfect textures. Using 500g of powdered milk instead of the correct ounce measurement could throw off your recipe. For example, too much powdered milk in a batter might make it overly dense, while too little could result in a lack of flavour. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> simplifies these calculations, so you never have to guess.</p>  

<p>Many UK home cooks prefer weighing ingredients in grams, but some recipes, especially older or American ones, use ounces. Converting 500g of powdered milk to ounces ensures you follow the recipe correctly. This is particularly important for baking, where precision is key. If you’re exploring <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert recipes</a>, getting the measurements right guarantees a delicious outcome.</p>  

<h3>How to measure 500g of powdered milk without scales</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a kitchen scale, you can still measure 500g of powdered milk using volume. One cup of powdered milk typically weighs around 120g, so 500g would be roughly 4 cups and 2 tablespoons. However, this method isn’t as precise as weighing, so we recommend investing in a digital scale for accuracy.

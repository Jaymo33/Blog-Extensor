<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Using the correct amount of condensed milk ensures your recipes have the right texture and sweetness. Too little, and your dessert might lack richness; too much, and it could become overly sticky or dense. Air fryers cook food quickly, so precise measurements prevent undercooking or burning. If you’re working with condensed milk in recipes like fudge or cheesecake, 1.66 cups (13.28 ounces) is a common quantity. For more dessert ideas, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a>.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure Condensed Milk Correctly</h3>  
<p>To measure 1.66 cups of condensed milk accurately, use a liquid measuring cup with clear markings. Scoop the condensed milk into the cup, ensuring it’s level at the top for precision. If you don’t have a measuring cup, a kitchen scale set to ounces (13.28 oz for 1.66 cups) works perfectly. Remember, condensed milk is thick, so avoid packing it down or leaving air gaps.</p>  

<h2>Common Recipes Using 1.66 Cups of Condensed Milk</h2>  
<p>Many air fryer desserts call for condensed milk, including tres leches cake, flan, and sticky toffee pudding. These recipes often require 1.66 cups (13.28 ounces) to achieve the ideal consistency and sweetness. If you’re experimenting with new dishes, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert category</a> offers plenty of inspiration. Always double-check your measurements to avoid recipe mishaps.</p>  

<h3>Converting Other Condensed Milk Quantities</h3>  
<p>If your recipe calls for a different amount of condensed milk, here’s a quick reference: 1 cup = 8 ounces, so 0.5 cups = 4 ounces, and 2 cups = 16 ounces. This makes scaling recipes up or down simple. For more conversions, visit our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion guide</a>.</p>  

<h2>Tips for Working with Condensed Milk in an Air Fryer</h2>  
<p>Condensed milk can caramelize quickly in an air fryer due to its high sugar content. To prevent burning, cook at a lower temperature (around 150°C) and check frequently. If you’re making dulce de leche, place the condensed milk in a heatproof dish covered with foil.

<h3>Storing Leftover Condensed Milk</h3>  
<p>If you have leftover condensed milk after measuring 1.66 cups (13.28 ounces), transfer it to an airtight container and refrigerate. It stays fresh for up to two weeks. You can also freeze it for longer storage—just thaw before using it in your next air fryer recipe.</p>

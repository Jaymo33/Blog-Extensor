<p>260 F converts to approximately 120 C in a fan oven. This is a common temperature for baking, roasting, and air frying, especially for dishes like crispy chicken or roasted vegetables. Understanding this conversion ensures your recipes turn out perfectly, whether you're using an air fryer or a conventional fan oven.</p>  

<h2>Why Convert 260 F to Fan Oven?</h2>  
<p>Fan ovens circulate hot air for even cooking, which means they often require lower temperatures than conventional ovens. Converting 260 F to fan oven settings (120 C) helps prevent overcooking or burning. This is particularly useful for air fryers, which work similarly to fan ovens but in a compact space. If you're adapting a recipe from an American source, this conversion is essential.</p>  

<p>Many UK recipes use fan oven temperatures, so knowing how to convert 260 F ensures consistency. For example, if you're making a dish from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, you might need to adjust the temperature. Fan ovens and air fryers cook faster, so reducing the heat slightly (from 260 F to 120 C) balances the cooking time and results.</p>  

<h2>How to Use 260 F in an Air Fryer</h2>  
<p>Air fryers operate like mini fan ovens, so the 260 F to fan oven conversion (120 C) applies directly. However, air fryers cook faster due to their compact size and powerful airflow. When using 260 F in an air fryer, you might need to reduce the cooking time by 10-20% compared to a fan oven. Always check food a few minutes early to avoid overdoing it.</p>  

<h3>Adjusting Recipes for Air Fryers</h3>  
<p>If a recipe calls for 260 F in a conventional oven, you’ll need to adjust it for an air fryer. Set your air fryer to 120 C (the fan oven equivalent of 260 F) and monitor the food closely. Dishes like frozen fries or chicken wings cook beautifully at this temperature. For more air fryer tips, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>  

<h2>Common Dishes Cooked at 260 F (120 C Fan)</h2>  
<p>Many recipes work well at 260 F in a fan oven or air fryer. Roasted vegetables, such as potatoes or carrots, crisp up nicely at this temperature. Chicken thighs or drumsticks also cook evenly, with a golden finish. Even baked goods like cookies or muffins can be adapted to 120 C in a fan oven.</p>  

<p>For example, if you're making a <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipe</a>, 260 F (120 C fan) is ideal for juicy, crispy results. The same goes for reheating leftovers—your air fryer at 120 C will revive food without drying it out. Just remember to adjust the time accordingly.</p>  

<h3>Tips for Perfect Results</h3>  
<p>Preheat your air fryer or fan oven for even cooking at 260 F (120 C fan). Use a light oil spray for crispiness, and avoid overcrowding the basket. For cleaning tips, check our guide on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer maintenance</a>. With these adjustments, you’ll master cooking at 260 F in no time.</p>

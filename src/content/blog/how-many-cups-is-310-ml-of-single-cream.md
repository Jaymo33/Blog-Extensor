<p>310 ml of single cream is approximately 1.31 cups. This conversion is essential for precise baking and cooking, especially when using an air fryer where measurements can make or break a recipe. Whether you're whipping up a creamy dessert or a savoury sauce, knowing how to convert millilitres to cups ensures consistency every time.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of single cream can affect the texture and taste of your dish. Too little, and your sauce might be too thick; too much, and it could become runny. For air fryer recipes, precise measurements help achieve the perfect balance, whether you're making a creamy pasta bake or a luscious custard. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more handy tips.</p>  

<p>Single cream is a staple in many British kitchens, and its versatility makes it ideal for both sweet and savoury dishes. From enriching soups to creating light, fluffy desserts, knowing how to measure it correctly ensures your recipes turn out just right.

<h2>How to Measure 310 ml of Single Cream</h2>  
<p>If you don’t have a measuring jug, you can use a standard cup to measure 310 ml of single cream. A UK metric cup holds 250 ml, so 310 ml is roughly 1 and 1/4 cups plus an extra tablespoon. For US cups, which are slightly smaller at 240 ml, you’d need about 1.31 cups. Always level off the cream with a knife for accuracy.</p>  

<h3>Using Single Cream in Air Fryer Recipes</h3>  
<p>Single cream works wonderfully in air fryer dishes, adding richness without overpowering other flavours. Try it in creamy mushroom sauces or as a base for custards in desserts like crème brûlée. For a quick clean-up, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner</a> guide has you covered.</p>

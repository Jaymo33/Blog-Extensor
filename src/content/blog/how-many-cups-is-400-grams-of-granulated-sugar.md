<p>400 grams of granulated sugar equals approximately 2 cups in the US and 1.6 cups in the UK. This conversion is essential for baking, especially when using an air fryer for desserts. Whether you're whipping up cookies or cakes, getting the measurement right ensures perfect results every time.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Sugar Measurements Matter</h2>
<p>Granulated sugar is a staple in baking, and even a slight variation can affect texture and taste. Too much sugar can make desserts overly sweet or cause them to brown too quickly in the air fryer. Too little, and your treats might lack flavour or structure. That’s why knowing how many cups 400 grams of granulated sugar equals is so important.</p>
<p>For air fryer recipes, precision is key because the cooking environment is more compact. A well-measured ingredient ensures even cooking and perfect browning. If you're exploring sweet recipes on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, you'll find that accurate measurements make all the difference.</p>

<h2>US vs UK Cup Measurements</h2>
<p>In the US, 1 cup of granulated sugar weighs about 200 grams, so 400 grams equals roughly 2 cups. However, UK cup measurements differ slightly due to metric standards. In the UK, 1 cup is about 250 grams, meaning 400 grams is closer to 1.6 cups. Always check which measurement system your recipe uses.</p>
<p>If you're following a recipe from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, it’s best to weigh ingredients for accuracy. Many UK-based recipes provide measurements in grams, but if you only have cups, this conversion will help.</p>

<h3>How to Measure Granulated Sugar Correctly</h3>
<p>For the most accurate results, use a kitchen scale to weigh 400 grams of granulated sugar. If using cups, spoon the sugar into the cup and level it off with a knife—don’t pack it down. Packed sugar can lead to over-measuring, which might throw off your recipe.</p>

<h2>Common Recipes Using 400 Grams of Sugar</h2>
<p>Many air fryer desserts call for around 400 grams of granulated sugar. Classic options include sponge cakes, cookies, and even caramelised fruits. If you're new to air fryer baking, check out the <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for temperature and timing adjustments.</p>
<p>For example, a batch of air-fryer chocolate chip cookies might use 400 grams of sugar for a perfect balance of sweetness. Similarly, a Victoria sponge cake adapted for the air fryer benefits from precise measurements to ensure a light, fluffy texture.</p>

<h3>Adjusting Sugar for Healthier Alternatives</h3>
<p>If you're looking to reduce sugar, you can substitute part of the 400 grams with alternatives like erythritol or stevia. However, keep in mind that granulated sugar contributes to texture and browning, so adjustments may affect the final result.</p>

<h2>Storing Granulated Sugar for Baking</h2>
<p>Granulated sugar should be stored in an airtight container to prevent clumping. Moisture can cause sugar to harden, making it difficult to measure accurately. If your sugar has hardened, break it up before measuring to ensure consistency in your air fryer recipes.</p>

<h3>Cleaning Up After Baking</h3>
<p>Sugar can leave sticky residues in your air fryer basket. To keep it clean, use a non-abrasive sponge and warm soapy water. For stubborn spots, check out the <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner guide</a> for safe and effective methods.</p>

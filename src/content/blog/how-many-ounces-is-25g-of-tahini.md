Whether you're whipping up a tahini-based sauce or adding it to a marinade, knowing the exact weight ensures consistency.

<h2>Why Convert 25g of Tahini to Ounces?</h2>  
<p>Many air fryer recipes, especially those from the UK, use grams as the standard measurement. However, some kitchen scales or recipes might list tahini in ounces. Converting 25g of tahini to ounces (0.88 oz) ensures you follow the recipe correctly. This is particularly useful for dishes like tahini-glazed chicken or roasted vegetables, where the right balance of ingredients matters.</p>  
<p>If you're exploring international recipes, you might encounter ounces more frequently. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> can help you switch between units effortlessly. Whether you're meal prepping or trying a new recipe, accurate measurements lead to better results.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure 25g of Tahini</h3>  
<p>Measuring tahini can be tricky due to its thick, sticky consistency. For 25g of tahini (0.88 oz), use a digital kitchen scale for precision. If you don’t have one, a tablespoon holds roughly 15g of tahini, so 1.5 tablespoons will get you close. Stir the tahini well before measuring, as the oil often separates.</p>  

<h2>Using Tahini in Air Fryer Recipes</h2>  
<p>Tahini adds a rich, nutty flavour to air fryer dishes, from marinades to dips. For example, a 25g portion of tahini can elevate a simple salmon fillet or tofu dish. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>tahini-based recipes</a> for inspiration. The key is to distribute it evenly for maximum flavour.</p>  
<p>Since tahini is calorie-dense, measuring 25g (0.88 oz) helps control portions. This is especially handy for meal preppers or those tracking intake. A little goes a long way, so accuracy ensures you don’t overpower your dish.</p>  

<h3>Common Mistakes When Measuring Tahini</h3>  
<p>One mistake is not accounting for tahini’s density. Unlike liquids, 25g of tahini doesn’t equate to 25ml. Always weigh it for accuracy. Another pitfall is using compacted tahini straight from the fridge—let it soften slightly for easier measuring.</p>

<p>660 ml of cream is approximately 2.8 cups in the UK or 2.79 cups in the US. This conversion is essential for anyone using an air fryer to whip up desserts, sauces, or creamy dishes. Whether you're following a recipe from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> or improvising, knowing this measurement ensures accuracy.</p>  

<h2>Understanding the Conversion</h2>  
<p>Converting millilitres to cups isn’t always straightforward, especially with cream. The density of cream means it doesn’t pour or settle like water, so slight variations can occur. For most recipes, 660 ml of cream translates to roughly 2.8 UK cups or 2.79 US cups. This difference might seem minor, but precision matters in baking and air fryer cooking.</p>  

<p>If you’re using a standard UK measuring cup (250 ml), 660 ml of cream equals 2.64 cups. In the US, where a cup is 236.59 ml, it’s closer to 2.79 cups. Always check your recipe’s origin to avoid confusion. For more conversions, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>  

<h3>Why Accurate Measurements Matter</h3>  
<p>Air fryer recipes often rely on precise ratios to achieve the perfect texture. Too much cream can make a dish soggy, while too little might leave it dry. Whether you’re making a creamy pasta sauce or a decadent dessert, measuring 660 ml of cream correctly ensures consistency.</p>  

<h2>UK vs. US Cup Measurements</h2>  
<p>The difference between UK and US cup sizes can trip up even experienced cooks. A UK cup holds 250 ml, while a US cup is slightly smaller at 236.59 ml. When converting 660 ml of cream, this means UK bakers will use 2.8 cups, while US bakers will measure 2.79 cups.</p>  

<p>For air fryer recipes, this small discrepancy usually won’t ruin a dish, but it’s worth noting for precision. If you’re adapting a US recipe to UK measurements, round up slightly. Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a> for ideas that use cream perfectly.</p>  

<h3>Tips for Measuring Cream</h3>  
<p>Cream’s thickness means it’s best measured in a liquid measuring cup for accuracy. Pour slowly to avoid air bubbles, and level off the top with a spatula. If your recipe calls for 660 ml of cream but you only have cups, remember: 2.8 UK cups or 2.79 US cups will do the trick.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for 660 ml of Cream</h2>  
<p>From rich desserts to savoury sauces, 660 ml of cream is a versatile ingredient. In the air fryer, it’s perfect for making creamy dips, custards, or even whipped toppings. Try it in a <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert recipe</a> for a luxurious finish.</p>  

<p>You might also use 660 ml of cream in soups or casseroles. Its high fat content helps create a smooth, velvety texture. For cleaning tips after cooking with cream, visit our guide on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner</a>.</p>  

<h3>Converting Other Cream Measurements</h3>  
<p>If your recipe calls for a different amount of cream, the same principles apply. For example, 330 ml of cream is roughly 1.4 UK cups or 1.4 US cups. Always double-check conversions to avoid mistakes, especially when baking.</p>

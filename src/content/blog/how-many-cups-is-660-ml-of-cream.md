<p>660 ml of cream is approximately 2.8 cups in the UK or 2.79 cups in the US. This conversion is essential for anyone using an air fryer to whip up desserts, sauces, or creamy dishes. Whether you're following a recipe from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> or improvising, knowing this measurement ensures accuracy.</p>  

<h2>Understanding the Conversion</h2>  
<p>Converting millilitres to cups isn’t always straightforward, especially with cream. The density of cream means it doesn’t pour or settle like water, so slight variations can occur. For most recipes, 660 ml of cream translates to roughly 2.8 UK cups or 2.79 US cups. This difference might seem minor, but precision matters in baking and air fryer cooking.</p>  

<p>If you’re using a standard UK measuring cup (250 ml), 660 ml of cream equals 2.64 cups. In the US, where a cup is 236.59 ml, it’s closer to 2.79 cups. Always check your recipe’s origin to avoid confusion. For more conversions, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>  

<h3>Why Accurate Measurements Matter</h3>  
<p>Air fryer recipes often rely on precise ratios to achieve the perfect texture. Too much cream can make a dish soggy, while too little might leave it dry. Whether you’re making a creamy pasta sauce or a decadent dessert, measuring 660 ml of cream correctly ensures consistency.</p>  

<h2>UK vs. US Cup Measurements</h2>  
<p>The difference between UK and US cup sizes can trip up even experienced cooks. A UK cup holds 250 ml, while a US cup is slightly smaller at 236.59 ml. When converting 660 ml of cream, this means UK bakers will use 2.8 cups, while US bakers will measure 2.79 cups.</p>

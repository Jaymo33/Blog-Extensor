<p>335 ml of coconut oil equals approximately 1.42 cups (US) or 1.18 cups (UK). This conversion is essential for air frying and baking, where precise measurements can make or break a recipe. Whether you're whipping up crispy treats in your air fryer or baking a moist cake, knowing how to convert 335 ml of coconut oil to cups ensures consistency. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we understand the importance of accurate measurements for perfect results.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Frying</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of coconut oil can significantly impact the texture and flavour of your air-fried dishes. Too little oil, and your food might turn out dry; too much, and it could become greasy. Converting 335 ml of coconut oil to cups helps you strike the perfect balance. For air fryer recipes, precision is key—whether you're coating vegetables or preparing a marinade. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more handy measurement tips.</p>  

<p>Many air fryer enthusiasts prefer coconut oil for its high smoke point and health benefits. If you're experimenting with new dishes, knowing that 335 ml of coconut oil equals roughly 1.42 US cups simplifies the process. This measurement is especially useful when scaling recipes up or down. For more inspiration, browse our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> collection.</p>  

<h3>US vs. UK Cup Measurements</h3>  
<p>It's worth noting that US and UK cup measurements differ slightly. While 335 ml of coconut oil converts to 1.42 US cups, it's about 1.18 UK cups. This distinction is crucial if you're following a recipe from a different region. Always double-check which measurement system your recipe uses to avoid mishaps. For more guidance, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert recipes</a>, where coconut oil is a popular ingredient.</p>  

<h2>How to Measure 335 ml of Coconut Oil Without a Scale</h2>  
<p>If you don't have a kitchen scale, you can still measure 335 ml of coconut oil accurately using standard measuring cups. One US cup holds roughly 237 ml, so 335 ml is just over 1.4 cups. For UK bakers, a metric cup holds 250 ml, making 335 ml equivalent to 1.18 cups. These conversions ensure your air fryer dishes turn out perfectly every time.</p>  

<p>Coconut oil is solid at room temperature but melts easily, making it tricky to measure. To get an accurate 335 ml measurement, gently melt the oil first, then pour it into a liquid measuring cup. This method eliminates air pockets and ensures consistency.

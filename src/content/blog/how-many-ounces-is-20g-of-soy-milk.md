<p>20g of soy milk is approximately 0.705 ounces. This conversion is essential for anyone using an air fryer, as precise measurements can make or break a recipe. Whether you're preparing a creamy dessert or a savoury dish, knowing how to convert grams to ounces ensures your cooking is spot-on every time.</p>

<h2>Why Convert 20g of Soy Milk to Ounces?</h2>
<p>Many air fryer recipes, especially those from the UK, use metric measurements like grams. However, some kitchen scales or recipes might list ingredients in ounces. Converting 20g of soy milk to ounces (0.705 oz) helps you follow recipes accurately. This is particularly useful for baking, where precision is key to achieving the perfect texture and flavour.</p>
<p>At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we often see questions about conversions, especially for plant-based ingredients like soy milk. Whether you're making a <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert</a> or a <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/breakfast>breakfast dish</a>, getting the measurements right ensures your food turns out perfectly every time.</p>

<h2>How to Measure 20g of Soy Milk Accurately</h2>
<p>To measure 20g of soy milk, you can use a digital kitchen scale set to grams. If your scale only displays ounces, simply multiply the grams by 0.035274 to get the equivalent in ounces. For 20g of soy milk, this calculation gives you 0.705 ounces. This method works for any liquid ingredient, ensuring consistency in your air fryer recipes.</p>
<p>If you don't have a scale, you can use a measuring spoon or cup. One tablespoon of soy milk is roughly 15g, so 20g would be just over one tablespoon. However, for the most accurate results, a scale is always best. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more handy tips.</p>

<h3>Common Uses for 20g of Soy Milk in Air Fryer Recipes</h3>
<p>20g of soy milk is often used in small batches of air fryer recipes, such as batters, glazes, or sauces. For example, you might need 20g of soy milk to make a light batter for <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/tofu>tofu</a> or a glaze for roasted vegetables. Its mild flavour and creamy texture make it a versatile ingredient in both sweet and savoury dishes.</p>

<h2>Tips for Working with Soy Milk in Your Air Fryer</h2>
<p>Soy milk can behave differently than dairy milk in air fryer recipes, so it's important to adjust accordingly. For instance, soy milk may thicken faster when heated, so keep an eye on your dishes to prevent overcooking. Always use unsweetened soy milk unless the recipe specifies otherwise, as sweetened varieties can alter the flavour and texture of your dish.</p>
<p>Cleaning your air fryer after using soy milk is also crucial. Residue can build up and affect future recipes. For tips on keeping your appliance in top condition, visit our guide on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner</a>.</p>

<h3>Converting Other Amounts of Soy Milk</h3>
<p>If you need to convert larger or smaller amounts of soy milk, the same formula applies. For example, 50g of soy milk is roughly 1.76 ounces, while 10g is about 0.35 ounces. Keeping a conversion chart handy can save time and ensure your air fryer recipes turn out perfectly every time.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Getting the right amount of lemon juice can make or break a recipe. Too little, and your dish might lack flavour; too much, and it could become overpoweringly sour. For air fryer recipes, precision is key because the cooking process is faster and more intense. A slight imbalance in ingredients can affect texture and taste. That’s why converting 310 ml of lemon juice to cups correctly is so important.</p>  

<p>Lemon juice is often used in marinades, dressings, and desserts. If you're preparing a <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>lemon chicken dish</a> in your air fryer, the right acidity level ensures tender, flavourful results. Similarly, baking a lemon drizzle cake requires exact measurements to achieve the perfect balance of sweetness and tartness.

<h3>UK vs. US Cup Measurements</h3>  
<p>While 310 ml of lemon juice converts to roughly 1.31 cups in both UK and US measurements, it’s worth noting that cup sizes can vary slightly. In the UK, a standard cup is 284 ml, whereas in the US, it’s 240 ml. However, for most practical purposes, the difference is negligible when measuring liquids like lemon juice. For baking, sticking to one system (metric or imperial) avoids confusion.</p>  

<h2>How to Measure 310 ml of Lemon Juice Without a Scale</h2>  
<p>If you don’t have a measuring jug, you can still measure 310 ml of lemon juice accurately. A standard UK cup holds 284 ml, so you’d need just over one cup (1.09 cups to be exact). In the US, since a cup is 240 ml, 310 ml equals about 1.31 cups. For smaller quantities, tablespoons can help—20 tablespoons roughly make up 300 ml, so 310 ml would be around 20.5 tbsp.</p>  

<p>For air fryer recipes, consistency is crucial. Whether you're making <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>lemon desserts</a> or savoury dishes, precise measurements ensure even cooking.

<p>0.75 tbsp of tahini equals approximately 11.25 grams. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precision matters, ensuring your dishes turn out perfectly every time. Whether you’re making hummus, dressings, or baking, knowing the exact weight of tahini can make all the difference.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate tahini measurements matter</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of tahini ensures your recipes have the perfect consistency and flavour. Too much tahini can overpower a dish, while too little might leave it lacking depth. For air fryer recipes, precise measurements help avoid soggy or dry results. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more handy tips. Tahini is a staple in many cuisines, so getting it right is key.</p>  

<p>Many home cooks struggle with converting tablespoons to grams, especially with ingredients like tahini, which can vary in density. That’s why we’ve broken it down for you. Whether you’re following a recipe from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>our collection</a> or experimenting, this guide ensures accuracy. Air fryers excel with precise ingredient ratios, so don’t leave it to guesswork.</p>  

<h3>How to measure tahini correctly</h3>  
<p>For the most accurate results, use a digital kitchen scale to weigh your tahini. If you don’t have one, lightly spoon the tahini into a measuring spoon without packing it down. Avoid scooping directly from the jar, as this can lead to uneven measurements. Consistency is key, especially for air fryer cooking, where even heat distribution relies on uniform ingredient sizes.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for tahini in air fryer recipes</h2>  
<p>Tahini adds richness to dips, marinades, and even baked goods. Try it in air-fried falafel or as a glaze for roasted vegetables. Its nutty flavour pairs well with spices commonly used in air fryer dishes. Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable recipes</a> for inspiration. Tahini’s versatility makes it a must-have for any air fryer enthusiast.</p>  

<p>Another great way to use tahini is in dressings for air-fried salads or grain bowls. A little goes a long way, so measuring 0.75 tbsp (or 11.25 grams) ensures balanced flavours. For cleaning tips after cooking with sticky ingredients like tahini, visit our guide on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner</a>. Keeping your appliance in top condition guarantees better results every time.</p>  

<h3>Converting other tahini measurements</h3>  
<p>If your recipe calls for a different amount of tahini, here’s a quick reference: 1 tbsp of tahini equals 15 grams, while 1 tsp equals 5 grams. These conversions are handy for scaling recipes up or down. Whether you’re meal prepping or cooking for one, precise measurements ensure consistency. Air fryers work best with accurate ingredient ratios, so keep these numbers in mind.</p>  

<h2>Tips for storing tahini</h2>  
<p>To keep tahini fresh, store it in a cool, dark place and stir well before use. Over time, the oil can separate, but a good mix will restore its creamy texture. Proper storage ensures your 0.75 tbsp (11.25 grams) measurements remain consistent. For more storage hacks and recipe ideas, browse our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/meal-prep>meal prep section</a>. Tahini lasts longer when stored correctly, so you’ll always have it ready for your next air fryer creation.</p>  

<p>If you notice your tahini has hardened, gently warm it to soften before measuring. This makes it easier to scoop and ensures accurate gram measurements. Air fryer recipes often rely on precise ingredient textures, so don’t skip this step. With these tips, you’ll master tahini measurements in no time.</p>

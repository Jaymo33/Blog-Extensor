<h2>Why Convert 30g of Powdered Milk to Ounces?</h2>  
<p>Many UK recipes use grams, while others rely on ounces, especially when referencing older cookbooks or international guides. Converting 30g of powdered milk to ounces (1.06 oz) helps you follow recipes without guesswork. This is particularly useful for air fryer cooking, where ingredient ratios affect texture and cooking times. If you’re preparing a batch of <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>air fryer cakes</a>, even a small measurement discrepancy can alter the outcome.</p>  

<p>Powdered milk is a versatile ingredient, often used in breading mixes, batters, or homemade seasoning blends. Whether you’re making crispy chicken or a fluffy dessert, precise conversions ensure your dish turns out as intended.

<h3>Tools for Measuring Powdered Milk</h3>  
<p>A digital kitchen scale is the most accurate way to measure 30g of powdered milk. If you don’t have one, use a measuring spoon set with metric and imperial markings. One tablespoon of powdered milk weighs about 6g, so 30g would be roughly 5 tablespoons. However, for air fryer recipes, we recommend sticking to weight measurements for consistency.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for 30g of Powdered Milk in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Powdered milk adds richness to breadings for fried chicken or fish, helping achieve a golden, crispy texture in the air fryer. It’s also a key ingredient in homemade pancake mixes or <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>air fryer desserts</a> like mug cakes. Since 30g is a small amount, it’s often used in single-serving recipes or as a thickening agent for sauces.</p>  

<p>Another great use is in marinades, where powdered milk can tenderise meats while adding a subtle creaminess. If you’re meal prepping, pre-measuring 30g portions saves time. For more inspiration, browse our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> collection.</p>  

<h3>Adjusting Recipes for Different Quantities</h3>  
<p>If your recipe calls for a different amount of powdered milk, simply scale the conversion. For example, 15g would be 0.53 ounces, and 60g would be 2.12 ounces. Always double-check calculations to avoid mistakes, especially when baking. A misplaced decimal can turn fluffy biscuits into dense hockey pucks!</p>  

<h2>Tips for Storing Powdered Milk</h2>  
<p>Keep powdered milk in an airtight container in a cool, dry place to prevent clumping. If you’ve opened a large packet, consider dividing it into smaller portions, like 30g increments, for convenience. Proper storage ensures your powdered milk stays fresh and ready for your next air fryer adventure.

<p>Powdered milk has a long shelf life, but it’s best used within a few months of opening for optimal flavour. If you’re unsure whether yours is still good, give it a sniff—rancid powdered milk has a distinctly off smell. When in doubt, replace it to avoid ruining your dish.</p>

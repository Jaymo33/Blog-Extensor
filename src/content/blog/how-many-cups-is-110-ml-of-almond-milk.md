<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of almond milk can affect the texture and taste of your air fryer recipes. Too much liquid can make batters runny, while too little may result in dry, crumbly outcomes. For example, if a recipe calls for 110 ml of almond milk, measuring it as 0.46 cups ensures your dish turns out perfectly. Many of our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> rely on precise measurements to deliver consistent results every time.</p>  

<p>Almond milk is a popular dairy-free alternative, but its slightly thinner consistency means measurements need extra attention.

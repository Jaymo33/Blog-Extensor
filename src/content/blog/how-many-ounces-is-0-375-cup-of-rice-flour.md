<p>0.375 cup of rice flour equals approximately 1.5 ounces (oz). This conversion is essential for precise baking, especially when using an air fryer where measurements can make or break a recipe.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Baking</h2>  
<p>When cooking or baking in an air fryer, precision is key. Unlike traditional ovens, air fryers circulate hot air rapidly, meaning even small measurement errors can affect texture and cooking time. Rice flour, commonly used in gluten-free baking, requires exact amounts to ensure your recipes turn out perfectly. Whether you're making crispy coatings or delicate cakes, knowing how many ounces are in 0.375 cup of rice flour helps maintain consistency.</p>  

<p>At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we emphasise the importance of accurate conversions. For example, if a recipe calls for 0.375 cup of rice flour and you mistakenly use 2 ounces instead of 1.5, your batter could become too dense. This is particularly crucial for air fryer recipes, where balance is everything.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure 0.375 Cup of Rice Flour Correctly</h3>  
<p>To measure 0.375 cup of rice flour accurately, use a dry measuring cup and level it off with a straight edge. Scooping directly from the bag can compact the flour, leading to an incorrect weight. For best results, fluff the flour first with a fork before measuring. If you're converting 0.375 cup of rice flour to ounces, a kitchen scale is your best friend—simply weigh out 1.5 oz for perfect results every time.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for Rice Flour in Air Fryer Recipes</h2>  
<p>Rice flour is a versatile ingredient in air fryer cooking. From crispy coatings for chicken to gluten-free doughs, it’s a staple in many kitchens. If you're making tempura or frying fish, 0.375 cup of rice flour (1.5 oz) might be just what you need for a light, golden crust. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipes section</a> for inspiration on how to use this measurement in delicious dishes.</p>  

<p>Another popular use is in baking. Many air fryer-friendly cakes and cookies rely on rice flour for structure. If a recipe specifies 0.375 cup of rice flour, knowing it’s 1.5 ounces ensures your bake rises evenly.

<h3>Converting Other Rice Flour Measurements</h3>  
<p>If you frequently work with rice flour, it’s helpful to know other conversions. For instance, 1 cup of rice flour is roughly 4.2 ounces, while 0.5 cup is about 2.1 ounces. This makes scaling recipes up or down much easier. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a> provides a handy reference for all your measuring needs.</p>  

<h2>Tips for Storing Rice Flour</h2>  
<p>To keep your rice flour fresh, store it in an airtight container in a cool, dry place. Humidity can cause clumping, which affects measurements like 0.375 cup of rice flour. If you notice any off smells or discolouration, it’s time to replace it. Proper storage ensures your 1.5-ounce portions remain consistent for all your air fryer creations.</p>

<p>0.375 cup of rice flour equals approximately 1.5 ounces (oz). This conversion is essential for precise baking, especially when using an air fryer where measurements can make or break a recipe.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Baking</h2>  
<p>When cooking or baking in an air fryer, precision is key. Unlike traditional ovens, air fryers circulate hot air rapidly, meaning even small measurement errors can affect texture and cooking time. Rice flour, commonly used in gluten-free baking, requires exact amounts to ensure your recipes turn out perfectly. Whether you're making crispy coatings or delicate cakes, knowing how many ounces are in 0.375 cup of rice flour helps maintain consistency.</p>  

<p>At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we emphasise the importance of accurate conversions. For example, if a recipe calls for 0.375 cup of rice flour and you mistakenly use 2 ounces instead of 1.5, your batter could become too dense. This is particularly crucial for air fryer recipes, where balance is everything.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure 0.375 Cup of Rice Flour Correctly</h3>  
<p>To measure 0.375 cup of rice flour accurately, use a dry measuring cup and level it off with a straight edge. Scooping directly from the bag can compact the flour, leading to an incorrect weight. For best results, fluff the flour first with a fork before measuring. If you're converting 0.375 cup of rice flour to ounces, a kitchen scale is your best friend—simply weigh out 1.5 oz for perfect results every time.</p>

<h2>Why accurate onion measurements matter</h2>  
<p>Getting the right amount of chopped onion is crucial for balanced flavours in air fryer dishes. Too little, and your meal might lack depth; too much, and it could overpower other ingredients. Recipes on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> often rely on precise measurements to ensure success. Whether you're making a savoury onion tart or a hearty stew, 0.25 cup (1 ounce) of chopped onion is a common starting point.

<p>Chopped onion also affects cooking times in the air fryer. Finely diced onions cook faster than larger pieces, so consistency matters.

A kitchen scale can be a game-changer for air fryer enthusiasts.</p>  

<h3>How to measure 0.25 cup of chopped onion</h3>  
<p>To measure 0.25 cup of chopped onion, use a dry measuring cup and pack the onions lightly. Avoid pressing too hard, as this can compress the onion and throw off the measurement.

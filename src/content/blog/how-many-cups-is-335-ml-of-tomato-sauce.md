<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on even heat distribution, so ingredient proportions can make or break a dish. Too much tomato sauce might make your meal soggy, while too little could leave it dry.

If you're new to air frying, visit <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>our recipe collection</a> for foolproof ideas.</p>  

<p>Tomato sauce is a staple in many dishes, from lasagnas to meatball subs. Converting 335 ml to cups helps when following recipes that use different measurement systems.

<h3>How to Measure 335 ml of Tomato Sauce Without a Measuring Cup</h3>  
<p>If you don't have a measuring cup, you can use a kitchen scale. Since 1 ml of tomato sauce weighs roughly 1 gram, 335 ml equals about 335 grams. Alternatively, a standard UK tablespoon holds 15 ml, so 22 tablespoons would give you close to 335 ml.

<h3>Does Tomato Sauce Thickness Affect the Measurement?</h3>

<p>4 tablespoons (tbsp) of fish sauce weigh approximately 60 grams (g). This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements can make or break a dish. Whether you’re marinating chicken, seasoning seafood, or adding depth to a stir-fry, knowing the exact weight ensures consistency. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we focus on accuracy to help you achieve restaurant-quality results at home.</p>  

<h2>Why converting fish sauce from tbsp to grams matters</h2>  
<p>Fish sauce is a staple in many cuisines, especially in Thai and Vietnamese dishes. Its strong, umami-rich flavour means even small variations can alter the taste of your meal. Converting 4 tbsp of fish sauce to grams (60g) ensures you don’t over or under-season. This is particularly important in air fryer cooking, where flavours intensify due to the high heat and rapid circulation. For more air fryer conversion tips, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>  

<p>Using grams instead of tablespoons also eliminates inconsistencies caused by how the sauce is poured or levelled. A heaped tablespoon, for example, could add extra grams unintentionally. By weighing your fish sauce, you guarantee precision, which is especially useful for meal prepping or scaling recipes. If you’re new to air frying, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a> for inspiration.</p>  

<h2>How to measure fish sauce accurately</h2>  
<p>To measure 4 tbsp of fish sauce in grams, use a digital kitchen scale for the best accuracy. Place your mixing bowl or container on the scale, tare it to zero, then pour the fish sauce until it reaches 60g. If you don’t have a scale, use standard measuring spoons and level them off with a knife. Remember, fish sauce is dense, so 4 tbsp will always be close to 60g, but slight variations can occur.</p>  

<h3>Common mistakes when measuring fish sauce</h3>  
<p>One mistake is assuming all tablespoons are equal. In the UK, a tablespoon is 15ml, but in some countries, it may differ. Always use metric measurements for consistency. Another error is not accounting for the sauce’s viscosity—fish sauce pours slowly, so rushing can lead to under-measuring.

<h2>Using fish sauce in air fryer recipes</h2>  
<p>Fish sauce adds depth to marinades, glazes, and dipping sauces. In the air fryer, it works beautifully with proteins like chicken, shrimp, or tofu. For example, a marinade with 4 tbsp (60g) of fish sauce, lime juice, and garlic creates a tangy, savoury coating that crisps up perfectly. Pair it with our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/shrimp>shrimp recipes</a> for a quick, flavourful meal.</p>  

<p>Since air fryers cook food faster than conventional ovens, the concentrated heat enhances the fish sauce’s umami notes. Just be mindful of salt content—fish sauce is salty, so balance it with sweetness or acidity.

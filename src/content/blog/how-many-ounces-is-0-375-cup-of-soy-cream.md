<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>
<p>Air fryers rely on precise measurements to deliver even cooking and perfect textures.

<h2>How to measure 0.375 cup of soy cream</h2>
<p>Measuring 0.375 cup of soy cream can be tricky if you don’t have a 1/3 cup measure. Here’s a simple trick: use a 1/4 cup and fill it halfway to get close to 0.375 cup.

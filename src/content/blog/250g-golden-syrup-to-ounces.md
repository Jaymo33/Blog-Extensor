<h2>Why Convert 250g of Golden Syrup to Ounces?</h2>  
<p>Many UK recipes use grams, but if you're working with older cookbooks or international guides, ounces might be the default. Converting 250g of golden syrup to ounces (8.82 oz) helps maintain accuracy, especially in air fryer cooking where ingredient ratios matter. Golden syrup’s thick consistency means even small measurement errors can affect texture and sweetness. If you're new to air fryer baking, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a> for foolproof ideas.</p>  

<p>Air fryers excel at caramelising sugars, so precise golden syrup measurements ensure even cooking. Too much syrup can lead to overflow or burning, while too little might leave your dish dry. For sticky buns or glazed meats, 250g (8.82 oz) is a common quantity—bookmark this conversion for quick reference!</p>  

<h3>How to Measure Golden Syrup Accurately</h3>  
<p>Use a digital scale for grams or a liquid measuring cup for ounces when portioning golden syrup. Lightly grease your spoon or cup to help the syrup slide off cleanly. If you’re adapting a recipe from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert category</a>, note that golden syrup’s density means 250g fills roughly 160ml (about ⅔ cup).</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for 250g of Golden Syrup in Air Fryers</h2>  
<p>Golden syrup adds shine and sweetness to air-fried treats. A 250g batch (8.82 oz) is perfect for coating nuts, glazing ham, or drizzling over <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>air fryer cakes</a>. Its high sugar content helps achieve a glossy finish at lower temperatures than honey or maple syrup. Always preheat your air fryer to prevent syrup from pooling unevenly.</p>  

<p>For savoury dishes, mix 250g golden syrup with mustard or soy sauce for a quick glaze. The air fryer’s circulating heat ensures even caramelisation without scorching. After cooking, clean sticky residue promptly with our recommended <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner</a> to maintain performance.</p>  

<h3>Storing Leftover Golden Syrup</h3>  
<p>Transfer unused syrup to an airtight container—250g (8.82 oz) will keep for months at room temperature. If crystallised, gently warm the jar in hot water before remeasuring for recipes. For more storage tips, visit <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>.</p>

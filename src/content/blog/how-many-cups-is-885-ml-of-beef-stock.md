<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on precise ingredient ratios to achieve the perfect texture and flavour. Too much liquid, like beef stock, can lead to soggy results, while too little may dry out your dish. Converting 885 ml of beef stock to cups helps maintain balance, especially in recipes like braised meats or casseroles. If you're unsure about measurements, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a> for foolproof ideas.</p>  

<p>Beef stock is a staple in many air fryer dishes, from soups to marinades. Knowing that 885 ml of beef stock translates to roughly 3.74 US cups (or 3.5 UK cups) simplifies scaling recipes. This accuracy is particularly useful for batch cooking or meal prep, where consistency is key.

<h3>US vs. UK Cup Measurements</h3>  
<p>The difference between US and UK cup measurements can be confusing. In the US, 1 cup equals 240 ml, while in the UK, it's 250 ml. This means 885 ml of beef stock is 3.74 US cups but 3.5 UK cups. Always double-check which measurement system your recipe uses to avoid mishaps. For more measurement guides, visit <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>.</p>  

<h2>How to Measure 885 ml of Beef Stock Without a Measuring Cup</h2>  
<p>If you don't have a measuring cup, you can use a kitchen scale to measure 885 ml of beef stock. Since 1 ml of liquid weighs roughly 1 gram, 885 ml equals 885 grams. Alternatively, use a standard mug (about 300 ml) and fill it just under three times for an approximate measure. For more kitchen hacks, check our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning and tips section</a>.</p>  

<p>Another handy trick is to repurpose empty containers with known volumes, like a 500 ml water bottle. Fill it once, then add another 385 ml using a smaller measuring tool. This method works well for air fryer recipes requiring precise liquid amounts, such as broths or sauces. Remember, accuracy ensures your dishes turn out perfectly every time.</p>  

<h3>Common Recipes Using 885 ml of Beef Stock</h3>  
<p>Many air fryer recipes call for 885 ml of beef stock, including stews, pot roasts, and French onion soup. This quantity is ideal for serving 4–6 people, making it perfect for family meals.

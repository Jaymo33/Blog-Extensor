<p>0.5 cup of pesto equals approximately 4 ounces (113 grams). This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements ensure the best results. Whether you're making pesto chicken or a quick pasta dish, knowing the exact weight helps balance flavours perfectly.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate pesto measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of pesto ensures your dishes aren't overly greasy or dry. In an air fryer, ingredients cook faster, so precise measurements prevent overpowering flavours. A 0.5 cup of pesto (4 ounces) is ideal for coating 2-3 chicken breasts or mixing into a pasta bake. For more air fryer recipe ideas, check out <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>our recipe collection</a>.</p>  

<p>Pesto's thick consistency means volume-to-weight conversions can vary slightly. However, 0.5 cup reliably translates to 4 ounces in UK measurements. This makes scaling recipes easier, whether you're cooking for one or meal prepping for the week. Discover more tips on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>our conversion chart</a>.</p>  

<h3>How to measure 0.5 cup of pesto accurately</h3>  
<p>For best results, use a liquid measuring cup for pesto, scraping it level with a spatula. If you don't have measuring cups, 4 ounces of pesto fills about 8 tablespoons. This method ensures consistency, especially when adapting stovetop recipes for your air fryer.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for 0.5 cup (4 ounces) of pesto in air fryer recipes</h2>  
<p>This quantity works perfectly for coating proteins like chicken or fish before air frying. It's also great for stirring into roasted vegetables or as a base for quick flatbreads. Try our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>pesto chicken recipes</a> for easy weeknight dinners.</p>  

<p>When baking with pesto in the air fryer, remember it's more concentrated than fresh herbs. The 4-ounce measurement ensures balanced flavour without overwhelming other ingredients.

<h3>Converting other pesto quantities to ounces</h3>  
<p>If your recipe calls for different amounts, here's a quick guide: 1/4 cup = 2 ounces, 1 cup = 8 ounces. These conversions help adjust portion sizes while keeping flavours consistent. Always measure pesto by weight for the most accurate results in air fryer cooking.</p>

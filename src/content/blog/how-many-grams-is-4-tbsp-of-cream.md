<p>4 tablespoons (tbsp) of cream equals approximately 60 grams (g). This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precision ensures the perfect texture and consistency. Whether you're making a creamy sauce, baking a cake, or preparing a rich dessert, knowing the exact weight of your ingredients can make all the difference. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we focus on helping you achieve culinary perfection with accurate measurements and easy-to-follow guides.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on precise cooking times and ingredient ratios to deliver crispy, evenly cooked results. Using the correct weight for ingredients like cream ensures your dishes don’t turn out too dry or overly rich. For example, if a recipe calls for 4 tbsp of cream (60g), adding too much could make a sauce too heavy, while too little might leave it lacking in flavour. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> simplifies these calculations, so you never have to guess.</p>  

<p>Many air fryer recipes, especially desserts like cheesecakes or custards, depend on the right balance of wet and dry ingredients. Cream adds moisture and richness, but its weight can vary slightly depending on its fat content. Double cream, for instance, is denser than single cream, so measuring by weight (grams) rather than volume (tablespoons) ensures consistency. This is particularly useful when adapting traditional oven recipes for your air fryer.</p>  

<h3>How to measure 4 tbsp of cream without scales</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a kitchen scale, you can still measure 4 tbsp of cream accurately using standard tablespoons. One level tablespoon of cream is roughly 15g, so four tablespoons equal 60g. For best results, use a proper measuring spoon and fill it to the brim without packing it down. This method works well for most recipes on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>our recipes page</a>, from creamy pasta bakes to indulgent desserts.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for 4 tbsp of cream in air fryer recipes</h2>  
<p>Four tablespoons of cream (60g) is a versatile measurement used in many air fryer dishes. It’s perfect for enriching mashed potatoes, creating a velvety mushroom sauce, or adding a luxurious touch to scrambled eggs. You’ll also find it in desserts like air-fried bread pudding or chocolate fondant, where the cream’s weight affects the final texture. For more inspiration, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert category</a>.</p>  

<p>Savory dishes benefit from cream too—think creamy garlic prawns or a rich carbonara. Since air fryers cook quickly, the right amount of cream ensures sauces don’t split or become too thick. If you’re meal prepping, knowing that 4 tbsp equals 60g helps you portion ingredients efficiently. Visit <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> for tips on storing and reheating creamy dishes in your air fryer.</p>  

<h3>Does the type of cream affect the weight?</h3>  
<p>Yes, the fat content in cream impacts its density. Double cream (48% fat) is slightly heavier per tablespoon than single cream (18% fat), but the difference is minimal for small quantities like 4 tbsp. In most recipes, the 60g measurement works for both. However, if precision is crucial (e.g., in baking), weighing your cream is best.

<h2>Why Convert 10g of Lime Juice to Ounces?</h2>

By converting 10g lime juice to ounces accurately, you’ll maintain the balance of flavours in recipes from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>our collection</a>. This is especially important for delicate recipes like desserts or light seafood dishes.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure 10g of Lime Juice</h3>  
<p>Measuring lime juice by weight (10g) is more accurate than using volume (like tablespoons), as juice density can vary. Use a digital kitchen scale for the best results. If you don’t have one, 10g of lime juice is roughly 2 teaspoons, but weighing is preferable. For sticky residues, clean your scale with <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner</a> to maintain accuracy.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for 10g of Lime Juice in Air Fryers</h2>

From marinades for <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipes</a> to dressings for shrimp tacos, 10g (0.35 oz) can elevate your dish. It’s also great for balancing rich flavours in air-fried desserts like citrus-infused cakes. The acidity helps tenderise meats and adds a fresh note to vegetables.</p>  

<p>If you’re preparing a large batch, multiply the conversion accordingly. For example, 30g of lime juice would be 1.05 ounces.

<h3>Tips for Storing Lime Juice</h3>  
<p>Fresh lime juice is best, but if you’re measuring 10g from a bottle, ensure it’s well-shaken for consistency. Store leftover juice in an airtight container in the fridge for up to a week.

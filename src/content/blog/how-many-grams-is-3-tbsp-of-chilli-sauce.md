<p>3 tablespoons (tbsp) of chilli sauce weigh approximately 45 grams (g). This conversion is handy for air fryer recipes where precise measurements matter. Whether you're whipping up a spicy marinade or adding a kick to your dishes, knowing the exact weight ensures consistency. For more air fryer conversions, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on even cooking, and incorrect measurements can throw off your results. Too much chilli sauce might make your dish overly spicy, while too little could leave it bland. Grams provide a more precise measurement than tablespoons, especially for thicker sauces like chilli. If you're new to air fryer cooking, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a> has plenty of inspiration.</p>  
<p>Many UK recipes use grams for accuracy, so converting tablespoons to grams is a useful skill. Chilli sauce can vary in density, but 3 tbsp generally equals 45g. This makes it easier to follow recipes from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> or adjust portion sizes. For more tips, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipes</a>, which often feature chilli sauce.</p>  

<h3>How to measure chilli sauce correctly</h3>  
<p>Use a flat-edged knife to level off your tablespoon for the most accurate measurement. If you don’t have scales, remember that 3 tbsp of chilli sauce is roughly 45g. For sticky sauces, lightly grease the spoon first to ensure it slides off easily. This trick works well for air fryer marinades and glazes.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for 3 tbsp of chilli sauce</h2>  
<p>Three tablespoons of chilli sauce (45g) is perfect for marinating chicken wings or adding heat to stir-fries. It’s also a great base for spicy dips or glazes in air fryer cooking. If you love bold flavours, try our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable recipes</a> with a chilli sauce twist.</p>  
<p>You might also use 3 tbsp of chilli sauce in homemade burgers or as a drizzle over roasted potatoes. The 45g measurement ensures balanced heat without overpowering other ingredients.

<h3>Converting other sauce measurements</h3>  
<p>If a recipe calls for 6 tbsp of chilli sauce, simply double the grams to 90g. For smaller amounts, 1 tbsp equals about 15g. This scaling makes it easy to adjust recipes for your air fryer’s capacity or personal taste.</p>

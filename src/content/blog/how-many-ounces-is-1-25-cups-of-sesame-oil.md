<p>1.25 cups of sesame oil equals approximately 10.14 ounces. This conversion is essential for precise cooking, especially when using an air fryer where measurements can impact texture and flavour. Whether you're following a recipe from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> or experimenting with your own dishes, knowing the exact weight ensures consistent results.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on even heat distribution, and incorrect measurements can lead to uneven cooking or overly greasy results. Sesame oil, with its rich flavour, needs careful measuring to avoid overpowering your dish. For example, a recipe calling for 1.25 cups of sesame oil to ounces ensures you don’t end up with soggy vegetables or overly oily meats. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for other common ingredient conversions.</p>  

<p>Using the right amount of sesame oil also helps maintain the air fryer’s performance. Too much oil can cause smoke, while too little may dry out your food. Whether you're cooking <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken</a> or roasting vegetables, precision is key. A digital kitchen scale can be handy, but if you’re working with cups, knowing that 1.25 cups of sesame oil is roughly 10.14 ounces simplifies the process.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure Sesame Oil Correctly</h3>  
<p>When measuring sesame oil, always use a liquid measuring cup for accuracy. Fill it to the 1.25-cup mark at eye level to avoid over-pouring. For sticky oils like sesame, lightly greasing the cup beforehand can help it slide out easily. If you’re scaling a recipe from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>our collection</a>, this method ensures you stay on track.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for Sesame Oil in Air Fryer Recipes</h2>  
<p>Sesame oil adds depth to marinades, dressings, and stir-fries. In an air fryer, it’s perfect for coating tofu, chicken, or vegetables before cooking. For instance, tossing broccoli in 1.25 cups of sesame oil (10.14 ounces) before air frying enhances its nutty flavour. Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable recipes</a> for inspiration.</p>  

<p>Another great use is in Asian-inspired dishes. A drizzle of sesame oil over air-fried shrimp or noodles elevates the dish. Remember, a little goes a long way—so measuring 1.25 cups of sesame oil to ounces ensures you don’t overdo it.

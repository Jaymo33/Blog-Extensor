<p>1.66 cups of sunflower seeds equals approximately 8.8 ounces. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes, ensuring precise measurements for consistent results. Whether you're roasting sunflower seeds or using them as a crunchy topping, knowing the exact weight helps avoid over or under-seasoning.

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air frying</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on even cooking, and incorrect measurements can lead to uneven results. Sunflower seeds, for instance, can burn quickly if too many are added at once. Measuring 1.66 cups (8.8 oz) ensures the right balance for roasting or incorporating into dishes. If you're new to air frying, browse our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a> for inspiration.</p>  

<p>Using a kitchen scale is the most accurate way to measure sunflower seeds, but cup conversions are handy when scales aren’t available. Remember, 1.66 cups of sunflower seeds to ounces is roughly 8.8 oz, but slight variations can occur based on seed size and packing density. For perfectly roasted seeds every time, stick to this measurement.</p>  

<h3>How to measure sunflower seeds without a scale</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a scale, use the spoon-and-level method for accuracy. Lightly spoon sunflower seeds into a measuring cup until slightly heaped, then level off with a straight edge. This prevents compacting, which could skew the weight. For more tips, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/snacks>snack recipes</a> featuring sunflower seeds.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for 1.66 cups of sunflower seeds</h2>  
<p>This quantity is perfect for making a batch of air-fried sunflower seeds or adding crunch to salads and baked goods. You could also mix them into granola or use them as a coating for chicken or fish. For cleaning your air fryer after cooking, try our recommended <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner</a>.</p>  

<p>Sunflower seeds are rich in healthy fats and protein, making them a nutritious addition to meals. Roasting 1.66 cups (8.8 oz) in your air fryer at 160°C for 8–10 minutes enhances their nutty flavour. Stir occasionally for even browning. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/breakfast>breakfast recipes</a> for creative ways to use them.</p>  

<h3>Storing sunflower seeds for freshness</h3>  
<p>After measuring 1.66 cups of sunflower seeds, store any leftovers in an airtight container in a cool, dark place. This prevents rancidity and maintains freshness. For longer storage, keep them in the fridge or freezer. Proper storage ensures your seeds stay ready for your next air fryer adventure.</p>

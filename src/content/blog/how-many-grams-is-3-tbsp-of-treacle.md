<p>3 tablespoons of treacle weigh approximately 63 grams. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precision matters, ensuring your dishes turn out perfectly every time. Whether you’re baking sticky toffee pudding or glazing ham, knowing the exact weight helps avoid guesswork.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers cook food quickly and evenly, but only if the ingredients are measured correctly. Too much or too little treacle can throw off the texture and flavour of your dish. For example, a sticky cake might turn out dry if the treacle measurement is off. That’s why converting 3 tbsp of treacle to grams is so useful.</p>  
<p>Many air fryer recipes, like those on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, rely on precise measurements. Whether you’re making desserts or savoury dishes, getting the treacle right ensures consistency. Plus, grams are often easier to work with than tablespoons, especially when scaling recipes up or down.</p>  

<h2>How to measure treacle accurately</h2>  
<p>Measuring treacle can be tricky because it’s thick and sticky. To get an accurate 63 grams for your 3 tbsp, use a digital kitchen scale. Spoon the treacle into the tablespoon without packing it down, then level it off with a knife. This method avoids over-pouring and keeps your measurements precise.</p>  
<p>If you don’t have a scale, remember that 1 tbsp of treacle is roughly 21 grams. This makes it easy to calculate 3 tbsp as 63 grams. For more air fryer measurement tips, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a>.</p>  

<h3>Common uses for treacle in air fryer recipes</h3>  
<p>Treacle adds depth and sweetness to many air fryer dishes. It’s perfect for glazing meats like ham or pork, as well as in desserts like gingerbread or flapjacks. The rich, molasses-like flavour works beautifully in both sweet and savoury recipes.</p>  

<h3>Substitutes for treacle in air fryer cooking</h3>  
<p>If you’re out of treacle, golden syrup or molasses can work as substitutes. Keep in mind that these alternatives might slightly alter the flavour and texture of your dish. For exact conversions, refer to our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/Dessert>dessert category</a> for treacle-based recipes.</p>  

<h2>Tips for working with treacle in air fryers</h2>  
<p>Treacle can be messy, so lightly greasing your measuring spoon helps it slide off easily. When using it in air fryer recipes, mix it well with other ingredients to ensure even distribution. This prevents clumping and ensures a consistent cook.</p>  
<p>For sticky recipes like treacle tart or parkin, lining your air fryer basket with parchment paper makes cleanup a breeze. Visit <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>our cleaning guide</a> for more tips on maintaining your air fryer after cooking with treacle.</p>  

<h3>Storing treacle for future use</h3>  
<p>Treacle has a long shelf life, but it’s best stored in a cool, dry place. If it crystallises, gently warming the jar in hot water will return it to its original consistency. This ensures your 3 tbsp (63 grams) measurements remain accurate for future recipes.</p>

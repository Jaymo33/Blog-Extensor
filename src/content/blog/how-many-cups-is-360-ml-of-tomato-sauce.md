<p>360 ml of tomato sauce is approximately 1.52 cups. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes, where precise measurements can make or break a dish. Whether you're making a rich pasta sauce or a marinade for chicken, knowing how to convert millilitres to cups ensures consistency. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we focus on making cooking conversions effortless, so you spend less time measuring and more time enjoying your meal.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>
<p>Air fryers rely on even heat distribution, and the right amount of sauce ensures your food cooks perfectly. Too much tomato sauce can make dishes soggy, while too little might leave them dry. Converting 360 ml of tomato sauce to cups (1.52 cups) helps maintain balance in recipes like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer chicken parmesan</a> or stuffed peppers. If you're scaling a recipe from metric to imperial, this conversion is a lifesaver. For more handy conversions, check our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>

<p>Tomato sauce is a staple in many dishes, from lasagne to meatball subs. Whether you're cooking for one or meal prepping, knowing that 360 ml equals roughly 1.5 cups simplifies batch cooking. If you're using a UK or US measuring cup, note that the standard US cup is 240 ml, while the UK metric cup is 250 ml. This slight difference won’t drastically affect most recipes, but precision matters in baking. For more tips, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable-based recipes</a>.</p>

<h2>How to Measure 360 ml of Tomato Sauce Without a Measuring Cup</h2>
<p>Don’t have a measuring jug? No problem. A standard UK mug holds about 284 ml, so 360 ml of tomato sauce is just over 1.25 mugs. Alternatively, use a tablespoon—15 ml per spoon means 24 tablespoons equal 360 ml. This method works well for thicker sauces where precision is key. If you're making <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>air fryer chicken wings</a>, a saucy glaze measured this way ensures even coating.</p>

<h3>Converting Other Common Sauce Measurements</h3>
<p>Need to adjust a recipe? Here’s a quick reference: 180 ml is 0.76 cups, and 500 ml is roughly 2.11 cups. These conversions help when halving or doubling recipes. For instance, if a dish calls for 720 ml (3 cups) of sauce, you’ll know 360 ml is half that.

<h2>Tips for Using Tomato Sauce in Air Fryer Recipes</h2>
<p>Tomato sauce can caramelise quickly in an air fryer, so lightly coating foods avoids burning. For dishes like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/potatoes>air fryer potato wedges</a>, toss them in sauce halfway through cooking. Always preheat your air fryer to ensure even cooking, and clean it afterward with our recommended <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner</a>. With these tips, your 360 ml (1.52 cups) of tomato sauce will elevate every meal.</p>

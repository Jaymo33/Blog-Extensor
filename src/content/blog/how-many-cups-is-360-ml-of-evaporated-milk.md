<h2>Understanding Evaporated Milk Measurements</h2>  
<p>Evaporated milk is a staple in many recipes, from custards to casseroles. Measuring it correctly ensures your dish has the right consistency and flavour. A standard metric cup holds 250 ml, so 360 ml of evaporated milk is just over 1.5 cups. If you're using an air fryer for baking, precise measurements are even more critical to avoid dry or overly wet results.

<p>In the UK, cup measurements align closely with the metric system, making conversions straightforward. However, if you're following a US recipe, note that their cups are slightly smaller (240 ml). Still, the difference is minimal, so 360 ml of evaporated milk will still be roughly 1.5 cups.

<h3>Why Accurate Measurement Matters</h3>  
<p>Using the right amount of evaporated milk can make or break your dish. Too little, and your recipe might lack creaminess; too much, and it could become soggy. This is especially important in air fryer cooking, where precise ingredient ratios affect texture and cooking time. If you're making a dessert like flan or a savoury sauce, always measure carefully.</p>

<p>360 ml of evaporated milk equals approximately 1.5 cups in both UK and US measurements. This conversion is essential for baking and cooking, ensuring your recipes turn out perfectly every time. Whether you're making a creamy dessert or a savoury dish, knowing how to measure evaporated milk accurately is key. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we help simplify kitchen conversions so you can focus on creating delicious meals.</p>  

<h2>Understanding Evaporated Milk Measurements</h2>  
<p>Evaporated milk is a staple in many recipes, from custards to casseroles. Measuring it correctly ensures your dish has the right consistency and flavour. A standard metric cup holds 250 ml, so 360 ml of evaporated milk is just over 1.5 cups. If you're using an air fryer for baking, precise measurements are even more critical to avoid dry or overly wet results. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more handy tips.</p>  

<p>In the UK, cup measurements align closely with the metric system, making conversions straightforward. However, if you're following a US recipe, note that their cups are slightly smaller (240 ml). Still, the difference is minimal, so 360 ml of evaporated milk will still be roughly 1.5 cups. For more baking inspiration, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipes section</a>.</p>  

<h3>Why Accurate Measurement Matters</h3>  
<p>Using the right amount of evaporated milk can make or break your dish. Too little, and your recipe might lack creaminess; too much, and it could become soggy. This is especially important in air fryer cooking, where precise ingredient ratios affect texture and cooking time. If you're making a dessert like flan or a savoury sauce, always measure carefully.</p>  

<h2>Converting 360 ml of Evaporated Milk for Baking</h2>  
<p>Baking is a science, and evaporated milk plays a crucial role in many recipes. Whether you're making cakes, custards, or pies, 360 ml translates to 1.5 cups. If you don’t have a measuring cup, you can use a kitchen scale—360 ml weighs about 360 grams.

<p>Air fryers are fantastic for baking, but they require precise measurements to avoid uneven cooking. If your recipe calls for 360 ml of evaporated milk, measure it carefully to ensure even heat distribution. Need to clean your air fryer after baking? Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning guide</a> has you covered.</p>  

<h3>Common Recipes Using 360 ml of Evaporated Milk</h3>  
<p>Many creamy desserts and sauces use 360 ml of evaporated milk. Think pumpkin pie, fudge, or even mac and cheese. If you're adapting a stovetop recipe for the air fryer, ensure you measure ingredients like evaporated milk accurately for the best results.</p>

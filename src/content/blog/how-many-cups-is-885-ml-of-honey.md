<p>885 ml of honey is approximately 3.7 cups in the US measurement system and roughly 3.1 cups in the UK measurement system. Whether you're baking a cake or glazing chicken in your air fryer, getting the measurements right is crucial for the perfect result. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we know how important accurate conversions are for hassle-free cooking.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Honey Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Honey is a sticky ingredient, and even a small mismeasurement can throw off your recipe. Too much honey can make dishes overly sweet or cause uneven cooking in your air fryer. Too little might leave your glaze thin or your baked goods dry. That’s why knowing how many cups 885 ml of honey equals is so helpful.</p>  
<p>For air fryer recipes, precision ensures even cooking and perfect texture. Whether you're making honey-glazed salmon or sticky tofu, the right amount matters. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more handy measurement tips.</p>  

<h2>US vs. UK Cup Measurements for Honey</h2>  
<p>In the US, 1 cup equals 240 ml, so 885 ml of honey is roughly 3.7 cups. In the UK, 1 cup is 284 ml, making 885 ml about 3.1 cups. This difference might seem small, but it can affect recipes, especially when baking or making sauces.</p>  
<p>If you’re following a recipe from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>our collection</a>, always check whether it uses UK or US measurements. A slight adjustment ensures your honey-glazed chicken or desserts turn out just right.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure Honey Without Sticky Mess</h3>  
<p>Measuring honey can be tricky due to its viscosity. Lightly coating your measuring cup with oil helps it slide out easily. Alternatively, use a kitchen scale for precision—885 ml of honey weighs about 1.2 kg.</p>  

<h2>Common Recipes Using 885 ml of Honey</h2>  
<p>From marinades to desserts, 885 ml of honey is a versatile quantity. Try it in air fryer honey-glazed carrots or a batch of honey mustard chicken. For inspiration, browse our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipes</a> or <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert section</a>.</p>  
<p>Honey’s natural sweetness also works wonders in baking. Use 885 ml for a large batch of honey cake or drizzle it over air-fried apples. Just remember to adjust cooking times slightly, as honey can caramelise faster than sugar.</p>  

<h3>Storing Leftover Honey</h3>  
<p>If you don’t use all 885 ml at once, store honey in an airtight container at room temperature. Avoid refrigeration, as it can crystallise. For easy cleanup, check our guide on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>keeping your air fryer spotless</a> after sticky recipes.</p>

<p>200 grams of cocoa powder equals approximately 1.7 cups when measured using the standard UK metric cup (250ml). In the US, where a cup is 240ml, it’s roughly 1.75 cups. This conversion is essential for baking air fryer desserts like brownies or chocolate cakes.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurement Matters</h2>  
<p>Getting the right amount of cocoa powder ensures your recipes turn out perfectly. Too much can make your dessert bitter, while too little might leave it bland. Whether you’re making air fryer brownies or a decadent chocolate cake, precision is key.</p>  

<p>At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we recommend using a kitchen scale for the most accurate results. However, if you don’t have one, our conversion chart will help you measure 200 grams of cocoa powder in cups with ease.</p>  

<h3>UK vs. US Cup Measurements</h3>  
<p>In the UK, a standard metric cup holds 250ml, while in the US, it’s slightly less at 240ml. This small difference can affect your recipe, so always check which measurement system your recipe uses. For 200 grams of cocoa powder, UK bakers will need about 1.7 cups, while US bakers should use 1.75 cups.</p>  

<h2>How to Measure Cocoa Powder Without a Scale</h2>  
<p>If you don’t have a kitchen scale, spoon the cocoa powder into your measuring cup and level it off with a knife. Avoid packing it down, as this can lead to an incorrect measurement. For best results, fluff the cocoa powder first to prevent clumping.</p>

<h2>Storing Cocoa Powder for Freshness</h2>  
<p>Keep your cocoa powder in an airtight container away from heat and moisture. This ensures it stays fresh and ready for your next baking session. Proper storage also prevents clumping, making it easier to measure accurately.</p>

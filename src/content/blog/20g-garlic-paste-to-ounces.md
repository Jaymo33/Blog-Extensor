<p>20g of garlic paste equals approximately 0.71 ounces. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements can make all the difference. Whether you're whipping up a marinade or adding flavour to your dishes, knowing the exact weight ensures consistency. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we help you nail every recipe with accurate conversions and tips.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of garlic paste can elevate your air fryer dishes from good to great. Too little, and the flavour might be lacking; too much, and it could overpower the dish. Converting 20g of garlic paste to ounces (0.71 oz) ensures you hit the sweet spot. This precision is especially important for recipes like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer chicken</a> or roasted vegetables, where balance is key.</p>  

<p>Garlic paste is a staple in many cuisines, and its concentrated flavour means a little goes a long way. If you're working with a recipe that calls for ounces but only have grams, this conversion saves the day.

<h3>How to Measure 20g of Garlic Paste Without Scales</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a kitchen scale, you can still measure 20g of garlic paste (0.71 oz) using spoons. One tablespoon of garlic paste typically weighs around 15g, so 20g would be roughly 1 and 1/3 tablespoons. This method isn’t as precise as weighing, but it’s a handy workaround for quick recipes.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for Garlic Paste in Air Fryer Recipes</h2>  
<p>Garlic paste is incredibly versatile and works well in marinades, sauces, and rubs for air fryer dishes. For example, a mix of 20g garlic paste (0.71 oz), olive oil, and herbs makes a fantastic marinade for <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>air fryer chicken</a>. It’s also great for adding depth to roasted vegetables or even <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/potatoes>air fryer potatoes</a>.</p>  

<p>Since garlic paste is concentrated, it blends seamlessly into recipes without leaving chunks. This makes it ideal for dishes where even distribution of flavour is crucial. If you’re new to using garlic paste, start with smaller amounts and adjust to taste.</p>  

<h3>Storing Garlic Paste for Freshness</h3>  
<p>To keep your garlic paste fresh, store it in an airtight container in the fridge. A 20g portion (0.71 oz) will typically last up to two weeks if stored properly. For longer storage, freeze it in ice cube trays—each cube holds about 10g, making it easy to measure out 20g when needed.</p>  

<h2>Converting Other Common Garlic Measurements</h2>  
<p>If your recipe calls for fresh garlic instead of paste, here’s a quick guide: one clove of garlic equals about 5g, so 20g of garlic paste is roughly equivalent to four cloves. This conversion helps when substituting ingredients or adjusting recipes to suit your taste. For more air fryer tips, visit <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>.</p>  

<p>Garlic powder is another alternative, but it’s much more potent. One gram of garlic powder equals about 3g of fresh garlic or garlic paste. Always adjust measurements carefully to avoid overpowering your dish.

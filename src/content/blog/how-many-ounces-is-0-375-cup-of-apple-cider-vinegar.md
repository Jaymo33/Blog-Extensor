<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>
<p>Air fryers rely on even cooking, and incorrect measurements can throw off your results. Too much liquid, like apple cider vinegar, might make your food soggy, while too little can leave it dry.

Always use a liquid measuring cup or kitchen scale for best results.</p>

For even more accuracy, a digital kitchen scale set to ounces will confirm you’ve got exactly 3 ounces. If you’re scaling up a recipe, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a> includes batch-friendly options.

<p>235 ml of coconut milk is approximately 1 cup in US measurements or just under 1 cup (0.99 cups) in UK measurements. Whether you're preparing a creamy curry or a rich dessert in your air fryer, getting the right amount of coconut milk ensures perfect texture and flavour. This guide will help you convert 235 ml of coconut milk to cups accurately, whether you're using UK or US measuring standards.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Using the correct amount of coconut milk can make or break your air fryer recipes. Too much liquid can lead to soggy results, while too little might dry out your dish. For example, if you're making a Thai-inspired curry or a coconut-based marinade, precision is key. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for other common measurement conversions.</p>  

<p>Coconut milk is a staple in many air fryer recipes, from creamy sauces to decadent desserts. If you're whipping up a batch of coconut shrimp or a vegan curry, knowing how 235 ml translates to cups ensures consistency. Visit <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> for more tips on perfecting your air fryer meals.</p>  

<h3>US vs UK Cup Measurements for Coconut Milk</h3>  
<p>In the US, 1 cup equals 240 ml, meaning 235 ml of coconut milk is just shy of a full cup (about 0.98 cups). In the UK, 1 cup is 250 ml, so 235 ml is roughly 0.94 cups. This small difference might not seem significant, but for baking or precise sauces, it’s worth noting. Always double-check which standard your recipe follows.</p>  

<h2>How to Measure 235 ml of Coconut Milk Without a Measuring Cup</h2>  
<p>If you don’t have a measuring cup, you can use a kitchen scale to weigh coconut milk. Since coconut milk’s density is close to water, 235 ml weighs roughly 235 grams. Alternatively, use tablespoons—16 tablespoons equal 1 US cup, so 235 ml is about 15.7 tablespoons. For more air fryer measurement hacks, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a>.</p>  

<p>Another handy trick is using common household items. A standard mug holds about 250 ml, so filling it just below the rim will give you close to 235 ml. For recipes requiring exact measurements, like coconut milk-based cakes or custards, investing in a good measuring jug is wise. Browse our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert recipes</a> for inspiration.</p>  

<h3>Adjusting Recipes for 235 ml of Coconut Milk</h3>  
<p>If your recipe calls for 1 cup (240 ml) but you only have 235 ml, the difference is negligible for most dishes. For baking, however, you might add a teaspoon of water or another liquid to compensate. Conversely, if you need to reduce 235 ml to a smaller amount, simply use a ratio-based approach.</p>  

<h2>Common Air Fryer Recipes Using 235 ml of Coconut Milk</h2>  
<p>Coconut milk is incredibly versatile in air fryer cooking. Try it in creamy curries, like a vegan korma or a fragrant Thai green curry. It also works wonders in desserts, such as coconut rice pudding or dairy-free ice cream. For savoury options, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipes</a> featuring coconut milk marinades.</p>  

<p>Another popular use is in dairy-free batters for fried foods. A mix of coconut milk, flour, and spices creates a crispy coating for tofu or vegetables. If you're new to air fryer cooking, start with simple recipes and gradually experiment with measurements. Don’t forget to clean your air fryer regularly—here’s our guide on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>keeping it spotless</a>.</p>

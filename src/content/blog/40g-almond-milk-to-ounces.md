<p>40g of almond milk equals approximately 1.41 ounces. Whether you're preparing a creamy sauce or baking a light dessert in your air fryer, getting the measurements right is key. Almond milk is a popular dairy-free alternative, and knowing how to convert grams to ounces ensures your recipes turn out perfectly every time. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we help you nail these conversions effortlessly.</p>  

<h2>Why Convert 40g of Almond Milk to Ounces?</h2>  
<p>Many air fryer recipes, especially those from the UK, use metric measurements like grams. However, some kitchen scales or recipes might require ounces. Converting 40g of almond milk to ounces (1.41 oz) ensures accuracy, whether you're whipping up a batch of pancakes or a dairy-free custard. Precision matters in cooking, and this small adjustment can make a big difference in texture and taste.</p>  
<p>Almond milk is lighter than dairy milk, so measuring it correctly prevents your dishes from becoming too watery or thick. If you're exploring more air fryer recipes, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipes section</a> for inspiration. From breakfast to dessert, we’ve got you covered with easy-to-follow guides.</p>  

<h2>How to Measure 40g of Almond Milk Accurately</h2>  
<p>Using a digital kitchen scale is the easiest way to measure 40g of almond milk. Simply place your measuring cup on the scale, tare it to zero, and pour until you hit 40g. If your scale displays ounces, it should read around 1.41 oz. No scale? A tablespoon of almond milk weighs roughly 15g, so 2.5 tablespoons will get you close to 40g.</p>  

<h3>Common Uses for 40g of Almond Milk in Air Fryer Recipes</h3>  
<p>This small quantity is perfect for light batters, dressings, or thinning out sauces. Try it in our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert recipes</a>, like air-fried banana bread or dairy-free muffins. Almond milk adds moisture without overpowering flavours, making it a versatile ingredient.</p>  

<h2>Converting Other Almond Milk Quantities</h2>  
<p>Need to convert different amounts? Here’s a quick reference: 100g of almond milk equals 3.53 oz, while 200g is 7.05 oz. Bookmark our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a> for easy access to these calculations. Whether you’re scaling up or down, these conversions ensure consistency in your cooking.</p>  

<h3>Tips for Storing Almond Milk</h3>  
<p>Once opened, almond milk lasts about 7–10 days in the fridge. Shake well before use, as separation is natural. For longer storage, freeze it in ice cube trays—each cube is roughly 30g, so you can thaw just what you need.

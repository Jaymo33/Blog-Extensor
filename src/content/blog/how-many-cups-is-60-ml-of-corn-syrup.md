<p>60 ml of corn syrup is equal to approximately 0.25 cups (or 1/4 cup) in both UK and US measurements. This conversion is essential for baking and air fryer recipes where precision ensures perfect results. Whether you're making sticky buns, glazes, or desserts, knowing how to measure corn syrup accurately can make all the difference.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>When working with corn syrup, even small measurement errors can affect texture and sweetness. Too much can make desserts overly sticky, while too little might leave them dry. Air fryer recipes, like glazed chicken or caramelised treats, rely on exact ratios for even cooking.

<p>Corn syrup’s viscosity means it’s best measured in a liquid measuring cup or by weight for absolute precision. If you’re adapting a recipe from grams to cups, 60 ml of corn syrup weighs roughly 80 grams. This is handy for international recipes or when using scales instead of cups.</p>  

<h3>UK vs. US Cup Measurements</h3>  
<p>Luckily, 60 ml of corn syrup converts to the same cup measurement in both the UK and US systems: 0.25 cups (1/4 cup). The slight variation in cup sizes (UK cups are 284 ml vs. US 240 ml) doesn’t impact small quantities like this. For larger amounts, always double-check with a <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe converter</a>.</p>  

<h2>How to Measure 60 ml of Corn Syrup Without a Cup</h2>  
<p>No measuring cup? Use tablespoons: 60 ml equals 4 tablespoons (15 ml each). For smaller increments, 60 ml is also 12 teaspoons (5 ml each). Coat your spoon or cup with a bit of oil first—this helps the syrup slide out cleanly, reducing waste and mess. This trick works wonders for air fryer sauces and marinades.</p>  

<p>Another method is using a kitchen scale. As mentioned, 60 ml of corn syrup weighs about 80 grams. If your recipe lists weights, this is the most accurate approach. Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert recipes</a> for ideas on using corn syrup in air fryer treats like pecan pie or flapjacks.</p>  

<h3>Common Recipes Using 60 ml of Corn Syrup</h3>  
<p>This quantity is perfect for glazes (e.g., ham or roasted veggies), caramel sauces, or chewy cookies. In air fryers, a 60 ml corn syrup blend with spices makes a glossy glaze for wings or tofu.

<h2>Storing Leftover Corn Syrup</h2>  
<p>After measuring 60 ml, store the rest in an airtight container to prevent crystallisation. Keep it at room temperature for easy pouring. If your syrup thickens, warm the bottle in hot water before use. For more kitchen hacks, visit <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>.</p>

<p>2.5 cups of chopped garlic equals approximately 20 ounces. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements ensure the best flavour and texture. Whether you’re making garlic-infused dishes or meal prepping, knowing this conversion saves time and avoids guesswork.</p>

<h2>Why accurate garlic measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of chopped garlic ensures your air fryer dishes are perfectly seasoned. Too little, and the flavour falls flat; too much, and it overpowers the dish. Garlic’s weight can vary slightly based on chop size, but 2.5 cups reliably converts to 20 ounces. For more air fryer tips, check out <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>our conversion chart</a>.</p>  

<p>Air fryers cook food quickly, so balanced ingredients are key. If you’re adapting a traditional recipe for the air fryer, converting cups to ounces helps maintain accuracy. Explore <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>our recipe collection</a> for garlic-heavy dishes like roasted potatoes or garlic butter shrimp.</p>  

<h3>How to measure chopped garlic correctly</h3>  
<p>For consistent results, lightly pack the chopped garlic into a measuring cup without pressing too hard. A heaped cup can skew the weight, so level it off with a knife. If you’re scaling recipes, a kitchen scale is handy for verifying 2.5 cups of chopped garlic to ounces.</p>  

<h2>Common recipes using 2.5 cups of chopped garlic</h2>  
<p>Garlic-heavy dishes like aioli, roasted vegetables, or marinades often call for larger quantities. For example, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>garlic butter chicken</a> uses this measurement for a bold flavour. The air fryer locks in the garlic’s aroma, making it ideal for such recipes.</p>  

<p>If you’re prepping freezer meals, 2.5 cups (20 ounces) of chopped garlic can season multiple batches. Divide it into portions and store them for later use. For cleaning tips after handling garlic, visit <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>our cleaning guide</a>.</p>  

<h3>Converting other garlic measurements</h3>  
<p>If a recipe lists garlic in cloves instead of cups, note that one medium clove yields about 1 teaspoon chopped. For minced garlic, 2.5 cups roughly equals 20 ounces, but check your packaging for density variations. Always adjust to taste, especially in air fryer cooking where flavours intensify.</p>  

<h2>Tips for storing chopped garlic</h2>  
<p>Freshly chopped garlic lasts about a week in the fridge. For longer storage, freeze 2.5-cup portions in airtight bags. When ready to use, thaw and add directly to your air fryer recipes. Avoid overheating garlic in the air fryer, as it can turn bitter quickly.</p>

<h2>Why measure cottage cheese in grams?</h2>  
<p>Using grams instead of tablespoons guarantees accuracy, especially with ingredients like cottage cheese that can vary in density. Air fryer recipes often rely on exact quantities for even cooking. A slight mismeasurement could affect texture—think soggy coatings or dry fillings. Grams also simplify scaling recipes up or down. If you're tracking macros, weighing cottage cheese helps stay precise. Explore more <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> where cottage cheese shines.</p>

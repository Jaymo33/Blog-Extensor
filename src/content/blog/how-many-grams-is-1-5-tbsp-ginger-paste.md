<p>1.5 tablespoons (tbsp) of ginger paste equals approximately 22.5 grams (g). This conversion is essential for precise cooking, especially when using an air fryer, where accurate measurements can make or break a dish. Whether you're whipping up a marinade or adding a punch of flavour to your meals, knowing the exact weight ensures consistency.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate ginger paste measurements matter</h2>  
<p>Ginger paste is a staple in many recipes, from curries to stir-fries, and even baked goods. Using the right amount ensures the perfect balance of flavour without overpowering your dish.

<h2>How to measure ginger paste without scales</h2>  
<p>If you don’t have a kitchen scale, you can still measure 1.5 tbsp of ginger paste accurately. Use a standard UK tablespoon (15ml) and level off the paste with a knife for consistency. Remember, ginger paste is denser than grated ginger, so 1.5 tbsp ginger paste in grams will weigh more than its fresh counterpart.</p>  

<h3>Common uses for ginger paste in air fryer recipes</h3>

It also works well in sauces and glazes, giving dishes like air-fried salmon or stir-fried veggies a warm, aromatic kick.</p>  

<h2>Converting other ginger measurements</h2>  
<p>If your recipe calls for fresh ginger instead of paste, 1.5 tbsp ginger paste equals roughly 2 tbsp freshly grated ginger. For powdered ginger, use about 1.5 tsp per 1.5 tbsp of paste. These conversions ensure your air fryer meals retain the intended flavour profile.

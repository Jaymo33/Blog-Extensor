<p>1.5 tablespoons (tbsp) of ginger paste equals approximately 22.5 grams (g). This conversion is essential for precise cooking, especially when using an air fryer, where accurate measurements can make or break a dish. Whether you're whipping up a marinade or adding a punch of flavour to your meals, knowing the exact weight ensures consistency.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate ginger paste measurements matter</h2>  
<p>Ginger paste is a staple in many recipes, from curries to stir-fries, and even baked goods. Using the right amount ensures the perfect balance of flavour without overpowering your dish. In air fryer cooking, where ingredients cook quickly and evenly, precise measurements like 1.5 tbsp ginger paste to grams help avoid soggy or overly spiced results. For more air fryer tips, check out <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>our recipe collection</a>.</p>  

<p>Many UK cooks prefer weighing ingredients like ginger paste for accuracy, as volume measurements (like tablespoons) can vary slightly. A kitchen scale removes the guesswork, ensuring your air fryer dishes turn out perfectly every time. If you're new to air fryer cooking, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a> simplifies common measurements.</p>  

<h2>How to measure ginger paste without scales</h2>  
<p>If you don’t have a kitchen scale, you can still measure 1.5 tbsp of ginger paste accurately. Use a standard UK tablespoon (15ml) and level off the paste with a knife for consistency. Remember, ginger paste is denser than grated ginger, so 1.5 tbsp ginger paste in grams will weigh more than its fresh counterpart.</p>  

<h3>Common uses for ginger paste in air fryer recipes</h3>  
<p>Ginger paste adds depth to marinades for chicken, tofu, or vegetables in the air fryer. Try it in our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipes</a> for a flavour boost. It also works well in sauces and glazes, giving dishes like air-fried salmon or stir-fried veggies a warm, aromatic kick.</p>  

<h2>Converting other ginger measurements</h2>  
<p>If your recipe calls for fresh ginger instead of paste, 1.5 tbsp ginger paste equals roughly 2 tbsp freshly grated ginger. For powdered ginger, use about 1.5 tsp per 1.5 tbsp of paste. These conversions ensure your air fryer meals retain the intended flavour profile. Explore more <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable-based recipes</a> to experiment with ginger paste.</p>  

<h3>Storing ginger paste for air fryer meals</h3>  
<p>To keep ginger paste fresh, store it in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 3 weeks. For longer storage, freeze teaspoon-sized portions – perfect for grabbing exactly 1.5 tbsp ginger paste weight in grams when needed. Proper storage ensures your air fryer dishes always have that fresh ginger zing.</p>

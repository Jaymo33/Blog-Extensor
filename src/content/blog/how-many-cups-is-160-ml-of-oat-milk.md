<p>160 ml of oat milk is approximately ⅔ of a standard cup. This conversion is essential for recipes, especially when using an air fryer, where precise measurements can make or break a dish.

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter</h2>
<p>When cooking or baking, especially with an air fryer, precise measurements are crucial. Using too much or too little oat milk can affect texture, moisture, and even cooking time.

This is why understanding conversions like 160 ml of oat milk to cups is so important.</p>

<h2>How to Measure 160 ml of Oat Milk</h2>
<p>Measuring 160 ml of oat milk is straightforward if you have the right tools.

For even more precision, a kitchen scale can help, as 160 ml of oat milk weighs about 160 grams.</p>
<p>If you’re using an air fryer for recipes like muffins or cakes, precise measurements ensure your batter has the perfect consistency. Too much liquid can lead to soggy results, while too little might make your dish dry.

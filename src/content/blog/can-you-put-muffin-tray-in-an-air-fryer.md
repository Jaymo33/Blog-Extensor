<p>Yes, you can put a muffin tray in an air fryer if it fits and is made of heat-safe materials like metal or silicone. Standard metal muffin tins work best, while plastic or thin silicone trays may warp. Always check your air fryer’s manual for size restrictions before attempting to bake muffins or other items this way.</p>

<h2>Choosing the Right Muffin Tray for Your Air Fryer</h2>
<p>Not all muffin trays are created equal when it comes to air fryer compatibility. Metal muffin tins, especially those made of aluminium or stainless steel, are generally safe up to 200°C. Silicone trays can also work but may require a metal trivet underneath for stability. Avoid glass or ceramic trays as they’re often too heavy and may crack from rapid temperature changes.</p>
<p>When shopping for an air fryer-friendly muffin tray, measure your air fryer basket first. Most standard 6-cup muffin tins fit in larger 5.8L+ air fryers, while compact models might only accommodate mini muffin trays. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we recommend checking our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/fit-guide>fit guide</a> for model-specific measurements before purchasing new bakeware.</p>

<h2>Safety Considerations When Using Muffin Trays</h2>
<p>Preventing damage to your air fryer and avoiding safety hazards should be your top priority. Never use a muffin tray that touches the heating element or sits too close to the top of the basket. Leave at least 2-3cm of clearance for proper air circulation, which is crucial for even cooking and preventing hot spots.</p>
<p>Some users worry about muffin trays catching fire in air fryers – this is extremely unlikely with metal trays but could happen with low-quality plastic. Always supervise your air fryer when trying new accessories. If you notice smoking or unusual smells, turn off the appliance immediately and remove the tray carefully using oven mitts.</p>

<h3>Best Practices for Air Fryer Muffin Baking</h3>
<p>For perfect results, preheat your air fryer for 3 minutes before adding the muffin tray. Fill cups only 2/3 full as batter rises more in the concentrated heat of an air fryer compared to conventional ovens. Rotate the tray halfway through cooking since most air fryers heat from the top. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>cake recipes</a> section for adapted baking times.</p>

<h2>Alternative Options If Your Tray Doesn’t Fit</h2>
<p>If your muffin tray is too large for the air fryer basket, consider using silicone muffin cups instead. These flexible liners conform to available space and are less likely to obstruct airflow. Another clever hack is making foil muffin cups by shaping aluminium foil around the bottom of a glass or jar to create moulds.</p>
<p>For those who frequently bake in their air fryer, investing in an air fryer-specific muffin pan might be worthwhile. These are designed with perforated bottoms to allow better airflow. Our tests show they reduce cooking time by about 15% compared to standard trays. Visit our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/accessories>accessories page</a> for vetted recommendations.</p>

<h3>Cleaning Your Muffin Tray After Air Frying</h3>
<p>Burnt-on batter can be tricky to remove from muffin trays. Let the tray cool completely before washing to prevent warping. For stubborn residue, soak in warm soapy water with baking soda for 30 minutes. Avoid abrasive scrubbers that could damage non-stick coatings. We’ve found our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner</a> works wonders on baked-on grease too.</p>

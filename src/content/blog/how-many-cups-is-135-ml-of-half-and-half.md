<p>135 ml of half and half equals approximately 0.57 cups (US) or 0.48 cups (UK). This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precision matters. Whether you're making creamy sauces, desserts, or baked goods, knowing how to measure half and half correctly ensures perfect results every time. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we focus on making conversions simple for home cooks.</p>  

<h2>Understanding Half And Half Measurements</h2>  
<p>Half and half is a dairy product made by combining equal parts whole milk and cream. It's commonly used in recipes to add richness without being as heavy as pure cream. When converting 135 ml of half and half to cups, it's important to note that US and UK cup measurements differ slightly. In the US, 1 cup is 240 ml, while in the UK, it's 284 ml. This means 135 ml of half and half is roughly 0.57 US cups or 0.48 UK cups.</p>  

<p>For air fryer recipes, especially those involving sauces or batters, accurate measurements are crucial. Too much or too little half and half can affect texture and consistency. If you're following a recipe from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>our recipe collection</a>, always double-check whether it uses US or UK measurements to avoid mistakes.</p>  

<h3>Why Measurement Accuracy Matters in Air Fryer Cooking</h3>  
<p>Air fryers cook food quickly and evenly, but they rely on precise ingredient ratios for the best results. Using the correct amount of half and half ensures your dishes have the right moisture and richness. For example, if you're making a creamy pasta sauce or a custard-based dessert, 135 ml of half and half should be measured carefully to avoid a runny or overly thick result.</p>  

<h2>Converting 135 ml of Half And Half for Baking</h2>  
<p>Baking in an air fryer requires even more precision than stovetop cooking. When a recipe calls for 135 ml of half and half, using a kitchen scale or proper measuring tools is ideal. If you don't have a scale, remember that 135 ml is just over half a US cup (0.57 cups) or slightly less than half a UK cup (0.48 cups). This small difference can impact the final product, so always verify which measurement system your recipe uses.</p>  

<p>For popular air fryer desserts like cakes or custards, half and half adds a luxurious texture. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert recipes</a> for inspiration on how to incorporate 135 ml of half and half into your baking. Whether you're making a vanilla glaze or a creamy filling, accurate measurements ensure success.</p>  

<h3>Tips for Measuring Half And Half Without a Scale</h3>  
<p>If you don't have a measuring jug, you can use a standard tablespoon to measure 135 ml of half and half. Since 1 tablespoon is about 15 ml, you'll need roughly 9 tablespoons to reach 135 ml. This method works in a pinch, but for best results, invest in a good-quality measuring cup.

<h2>Common Uses for 135 ml of Half And Half in Air Fryer Recipes</h2>  
<p>Half and half is versatile in air fryer cooking. From creamy soups to rich desserts, 135 ml can elevate your dishes. For example, a creamy mushroom sauce for chicken or a custard for French toast benefits from the precise measurement of half and half. If you're experimenting with new recipes, always start with accurate measurements to avoid waste.</p>  

<p>Cleaning your air fryer after using dairy-based ingredients like half and half is also important. Check out our guide on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>how to clean your air fryer</a> to keep it in top condition. Whether you're using 135 ml of half and half for a sauce or a dessert, proper maintenance ensures longevity for your appliance.</p>  

<h3>Adjusting Recipes for Different Measurements</h3>  
<p>If a recipe calls for a different amount of half and half, you can easily scale it up or down. For instance, if you need 270 ml, simply double the 135 ml measurement. Conversely, if you need less, halve the amount. This flexibility makes cooking with half and half convenient, especially when using an air fryer for quick meals.</p>

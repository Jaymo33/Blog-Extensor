<h3>How to Measure 2.75 Cups of Condensed Milk Without a Scale</h3>

This method works perfectly for air fryer recipes like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>desserts</a> or glazes.</p>

<h2>US vs. UK Cup Measurements for Condensed Milk</h2>
<p>In the UK, 1 cup equals 284 ml, while in the US, it’s 240 ml. For 2.75 cups, this means roughly 781 ml (UK) or 660 ml (US). However, most recipes standardise to the US measurement (650 ml). Always check the recipe origin to avoid confusion. For more global conversions, visit our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a>.</p>

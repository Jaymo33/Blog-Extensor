<p>1 cup of passata equals approximately 8.45 ounces (240 grams). This measurement is essential for air fryer recipes, ensuring your sauces and dishes have the right consistency. Whether you're prepping a homemade pizza sauce or a rich tomato base, knowing the exact weight saves time and guarantees perfect results every time.</p>

<h2>Why accurate passata measurements matter</h2>  
<p>Using the correct amount of passata ensures your air fryer dishes aren’t too watery or overly thick. A precise 1 cup to ounces conversion helps maintain balance in recipes like lasagna, stews, or even <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer pasta bakes</a>. Too much passata can make dishes soggy, while too little might leave them dry. For consistent results, always measure by weight if possible.</p>  

<p>Passata’s smooth texture makes it ideal for air fryer cooking, as it coats ingredients evenly. If you’re adapting a recipe from volume to weight, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> can help. Remember, 1 cup passata to ounces is roughly 8.45 oz, but slight variations may occur based on brand or thickness.</p>  

<h3>How to measure passata correctly</h3>  
<p>For the most accurate 1 cup of passata in ounces, use a kitchen scale. Scoop the passata into a measuring cup, then weigh it for precision. If you don’t have scales, fluff the passata lightly in the cup to avoid compacting it. This method ensures you stay close to the 8.45-ounce mark.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for passata in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Passata is a staple in many air fryer recipes, from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken dishes</a> to vegetable bakes. Its concentrated tomato flavour enhances meals without added sugars or preservatives. Try it as a base for air fryer meatballs or as a dipping sauce for crispy snacks. The 1 cup passata to oz conversion ensures you never over or under-sauce your creations.</p>  

<p>For those who love meal prep, passata freezes well. Portion it in 8.45-ounce (1-cup) batches for easy use later. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/meal-prep>meal prep section</a> for ideas on incorporating passata into weekly plans. Proper measurement means no waste and perfectly sauced dishes every time.</p>  

<h3>UK vs. US cup measurements</h3>  
<p>In the UK, 1 cup of passata equals 8.45 ounces, while US cups may vary slightly. Always confirm which measurement system your recipe uses. For UK cooks, sticking to the 8.45-ounce standard ensures consistency. Need more conversions? Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a> covers all major ingredients.</p>  

<h2>Tips for working with passata</h2>  
<p>Store opened passata in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 5 days. For longer storage, freeze it in 1-cup (8.45-ounce) portions. When using passata in air fryer recipes, spread it evenly to prevent pooling. Too much liquid can affect crispiness, so measure carefully.</p>  

<p>If you’re out of passata, canned tomatoes blended smooth can substitute at a 1:1 ratio. Just remember to adjust seasoning accordingly.

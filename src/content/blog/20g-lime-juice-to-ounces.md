<p>20 grams of lime juice is approximately 0.7 ounces. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements can make or break a dish. Whether you’re marinating chicken, dressing a salad, or adding a zesty kick to desserts, knowing how many ounces 20g of lime juice equals ensures consistency in your cooking.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate lime juice measurements matter</h2>  
<p>When using an air fryer, ingredients like lime juice play a crucial role in flavour and texture. Too much can overpower a dish, while too little might leave it lacking. For example, a <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>citrus-glazed salmon</a> requires just the right balance of acidity to complement the fish. By converting 20g of lime juice to ounces (0.7 oz), you can follow recipes with confidence, whether they’re written in metric or imperial units.</p>  

<p>Many UK cooks rely on grams, but some older recipes or international guides use ounces. This is where knowing the 20g lime juice to ounces conversion becomes handy. It’s also useful when scaling recipes up or down—like adjusting a marinade for a larger batch of <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>air-fried chicken</a>.</p>  

<h3>How to measure 20g of lime juice without scales</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a kitchen scale, you can still measure 20g of lime juice (0.7 oz) using tablespoons. One tablespoon of lime juice weighs roughly 15g, so 20g is just over 1.3 tablespoons. For even finer accuracy, use a measuring jug with fluid ounce markings. This method works well for recipes like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer dressings or glazes</a>, where precision matters.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for 20g of lime juice in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Lime juice adds brightness to countless air fryer dishes. A 20g portion (0.7 oz) is perfect for marinating shrimp, tenderising meats, or balancing rich flavours in <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>citrus desserts</a>. It’s also a key ingredient in many Asian-inspired sauces, like a tangy glaze for air-fried tofu or a dipping sauce for spring rolls.</p>  

<p>When reheating leftovers in the air fryer, a splash of lime juice (about 20g) can revive flavours. Try it with <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/frozen-foods>frozen prawns or chicken wings</a> for a fresh twist. Remember, 20g of lime juice equals 0.7 ounces—enough to elevate your dish without overwhelming it.</p>  

<h3>Converting other citrus juices</h3>  
<p>While this guide focuses on 20g lime juice to ounces, the same principles apply to lemon, orange, or grapefruit juice. Their densities are similar, so 20g of any citrus juice roughly equals 0.7 ounces. This makes swapping juices in recipes easy—just keep the 20g to 0.7 oz ratio in mind.</p>

<p>2 tablespoons (tbsp) of double cream weigh approximately 30 grams in UK measurements. This conversion is essential for precise cooking, especially when using an air fryer where ingredient ratios can affect texture and cooking times. Whether you're whipping up a creamy sauce or baking a decadent dessert, knowing the exact weight ensures consistent results every time.</p>

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on even heat distribution, and ingredient proportions play a crucial role in achieving perfect results. Using too much or too little double cream can alter the moisture content of your dish, affecting crispiness or tenderness. For example, adding 30 grams (2 tbsp) of double cream to a sauce ensures the right consistency without making it too runny or thick.</p>  
<p>Many air fryer recipes, like those found on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, specify weights rather than volumes for better accuracy. This is particularly important for creamy dishes such as gratins or custards, where precise measurements prevent splitting or curdling. A digital kitchen scale is your best friend for these conversions.</p>  

<h3>How to measure double cream without scales</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a scale, use a standard UK tablespoon (15ml) to measure your double cream. Fill it level for accuracy—no heaping or underfilling. Two level tablespoons will give you roughly 30 grams, which works perfectly for most recipes, including those in our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert category</a>.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for 2 tbsp (30g) of double cream</h2>  
<p>This small but mighty quantity of double cream can elevate many dishes. Stir it into scrambled eggs for extra richness, drizzle over air-fried fruit crumbles, or blend it into mashed potatoes for a silky texture. It’s also the perfect amount for enriching soups or creating a quick pan sauce for meats cooked in your air fryer.</p>  
<p>For baking enthusiasts, 30 grams of double cream adds moisture to cakes and scones without making them heavy. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a> for other common ingredient swaps to streamline your cooking process.</p>  

<h3>Does double cream’s thickness affect the weight?</h3>  
<p>While all double cream has a high fat content (around 48%), slight variations in thickness between brands won’t significantly change the weight. Whether you’re using a supermarket own-brand or a premium variety, 2 tbsp will still weigh close to 30 grams. For absolute precision in recipes like air fryer cheesecakes or custards, sticking to weight measurements eliminates guesswork.</p>  

<h2>Converting other cream measurements</h2>  
<p>If your recipe calls for a different amount of double cream, here’s a quick reference: 1 tbsp = ~15g, 3 tbsp = ~45g, and 100ml (about 6.5 tbsp) = ~100g. These conversions are handy when adapting traditional oven recipes for your air fryer, ensuring they cook evenly in the compact space.</p>

Remember, creamy ingredients like double cream can brown quickly in an air fryer, so keep an eye on dishes with high dairy content.</p>  

<h3>Storing leftover double cream</h3>  
<p>After measuring out your 30 grams (2 tbsp), store the remaining cream in its original container or an airtight jar. Use within 3 days and check for souring before adding to recipes. For longer storage, freeze portions in ice cube trays—each cube holds about 1 tbsp (15g), perfect for future air fryer creations.</p>

<p>360 ml of chicken broth equals approximately 1.52 cups. This conversion is essential for precise cooking, especially when using an air fryer where ingredient ratios can affect texture and flavour. Whether you're preparing a hearty soup or a savoury sauce, knowing how to convert millilitres to cups ensures consistent results every time. For more air fryer-friendly recipes, visit <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes</a>.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on rapid air circulation to cook food evenly, so precise measurements are crucial. Too much liquid, like chicken broth, can lead to soggy results, while too little may dry out your dish. Converting 360 ml of chicken broth to cups helps maintain the right balance. If you're new to air fryer cooking, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more handy tips.</p>  

<p>Many recipes, especially those from the US, use cup measurements, while UK recipes often list millilitres. Knowing that 360 ml of chicken broth is roughly 1.52 cups simplifies adapting recipes. This is particularly useful for dishes like casseroles or marinades, where liquid ratios impact the final outcome. For a range of chicken-based recipes, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipe category</a>.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure 360 ml of Chicken Broth Without a Measuring Cup</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a measuring cup, you can use a standard metric jug to measure 360 ml of chicken broth. Alternatively, 360 ml is just under 1.5 cups, so you can eyeball it by filling a cup slightly more than halfway twice. For best results, always use a liquid measuring tool for accuracy, especially when working with air fryer recipes.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for 360 ml of Chicken Broth</h2>  
<p>360 ml of chicken broth is a versatile quantity, perfect for soups, risottos, and gravy. In an air fryer, it can be used to baste meats or create steam for moist cooking. This amount is also ideal for deglazing pans or making a flavourful base for sauces. Discover more ways to use chicken broth in our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a>.</p>  

<p>When reheating leftovers in the air fryer, adding a splash of chicken broth (about 360 ml) can prevent dryness. It’s also great for cooking grains like quinoa or couscous directly in the air fryer basket. For tips on keeping your air fryer clean after cooking with liquids, see our guide on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner</a>.</p>  

<h3>Converting Other Liquid Measurements</h3>  
<p>If you frequently work with millilitres and cups, memorising key conversions saves time. For example, 240 ml equals 1 cup, so 360 ml is 1.5 cups plus a tablespoon. This knowledge is handy when scaling recipes up or down for your air fryer. Always double-check measurements for baking, where precision is critical.</p>

<h2>Why accurate mustard measurements matter</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of mustard can elevate your air fryer dishes from good to great. Too little, and you might miss out on flavour; too much, and it could overpower the dish. For example, a recipe calling for 25g of mustard (0.88 ounces) needs that exact amount to balance other ingredients. If you’re preparing a mustard glaze for chicken or a dipping sauce for air-fried snacks, precision is key.

<p>Mustard’s consistency can vary, from thick Dijon to runny yellow mustard, which affects how you measure it. A kitchen scale is the most accurate tool, but if you don’t have one, knowing that 25g is roughly 0.88 ounces helps. This is especially useful for UK cooks who might be following American recipes where ounces are more common.

<h3>How to measure 25g of mustard without a scale</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a scale, you can use tablespoons to measure 25g of mustard. One tablespoon of mustard weighs about 15g, so 25g is roughly 1.5 tablespoons. However, this can vary slightly depending on the mustard’s thickness. For thicker mustards like whole grain, you might need to level off the tablespoon for accuracy. Always stir the mustard first to ensure an even consistency before measuring.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for 25g of mustard in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Mustard is a versatile ingredient in air fryer recipes. A 25g portion (0.88 ounces) is perfect for marinades, glazes, or sauces.

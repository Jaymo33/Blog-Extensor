<h2>How many ounces is 1 cup of lemon juice?</h2>  
<p>1 cup of lemon juice equals approximately 8.45 ounces. This measurement is crucial for air fryer recipes, where precision ensures the perfect balance of acidity and flavour. Whether you're marinating chicken or adding zest to desserts, knowing this conversion helps avoid mishaps. For UK cooks, this measurement remains consistent, though always double-check your cup size.

<p>Lemon juice is a staple in many air fryer recipes, from crispy chicken to tangy desserts. Its acidity can vary slightly depending on freshness, but the weight remains reliable. If you're using bottled lemon juice, ensure it's unsweetened for accurate results. For more recipe ideas, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipes section</a>. Precision matters, especially when adapting recipes for your air fryer.</p>  

<h3>Why accuracy matters in air fryer cooking</h3>  
<p>Air fryers rely on precise measurements for even cooking and perfect texture. Too much lemon juice can make food soggy, while too little might lack flavour. This is why converting 1 cup of lemon juice to ounces (8.45 oz) is so helpful. Whether you're cooking salmon or vegetables, accurate measurements ensure consistency. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipes</a> for ideas using lemon juice.</p>  

<h2>Converting 1 cup of lemon juice to ounces</h2>  
<p>Converting 1 cup of lemon juice to ounces is simple with the right tools. A standard US cup holds 8 fluid ounces, but lemon juice weighs slightly more due to density. This makes it 8.45 ounces by weight, which is handy for UK cooks using metric scales. Always use a liquid measuring cup for accuracy. For more conversions, visit <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>our chart</a>.</p>  

<p>If you're using a kitchen scale, set it to ounces for the most precise measurement. This is especially useful for air fryer recipes, where small adjustments can make a big difference. Whether you're making marinades or dressings, knowing how many ounces are in 1 cup of lemon juice ensures success. Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert recipes</a> for sweet uses of lemon juice.</p>  

<h3>Tips for measuring lemon juice</h3>

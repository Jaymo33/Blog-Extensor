<p>100g of ginger paste equals approximately 3.53 ounces. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes, where precise measurements can make all the difference. Whether you're whipping up a marinade or adding a punch of flavour to your dishes, knowing this conversion ensures consistency. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we help you nail every recipe with accurate measurements.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of ginger paste can elevate your air fryer dishes from good to great. Too little, and the flavour might be underwhelming; too much, and it could overpower the dish. Ginger paste is a staple in many recipes, from Asian-inspired stir-fries to spicy marinades. For perfect results every time, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> to simplify your cooking process.</p>  

<p>Air fryers cook food quickly and evenly, but they rely on precise ingredient ratios for the best results. Whether you're making a curry or a glaze, 100g of ginger paste (or 3.53 ounces) ensures balanced flavours. If you're new to air frying, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipes section</a> offers plenty of inspiration to get started.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure Ginger Paste Correctly</h3>  
<p>Measuring ginger paste can be tricky due to its thick consistency. For 100g (3.53 ounces), use a kitchen scale for the most accurate results. If you don’t have one, a tablespoon holds roughly 15g of ginger paste, so you’d need about 6.5 tablespoons. However, scales are far more reliable, especially for air fryer recipes where precision matters.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for Ginger Paste in Air Fryer Recipes</h2>  
<p>Ginger paste adds depth to marinades, sauces, and even baked goods.

<p>For those who love meal prep, ginger paste can be a time-saver. Pre-measure 100g (3.53 ounces) portions and store them in the freezer. When you’re ready to cook, just grab a portion and toss it into your air fryer dish.

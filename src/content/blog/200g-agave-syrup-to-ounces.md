<p>200g of agave syrup is approximately 7.05 ounces. This conversion is essential for anyone using agave syrup in recipes, especially when working with air fryers where precise measurements can affect cooking results. Whether you're baking, glazing, or sweetening, knowing how to convert grams to ounces ensures consistency in your dishes.</p>  

<h2>Why Convert 200g of Agave Syrup to Ounces?</h2>  
<p>Many recipes, especially those from the UK or Europe, list ingredients in grams, while others use ounces. Converting 200g of agave syrup to ounces helps standardise measurements, making it easier to follow recipes accurately. This is particularly useful for air fryer cooking, where ingredient ratios can impact texture and flavour.</p>  
<p>Agave syrup is a popular sweetener in baking and cooking due to its mild flavour and lower glycemic index. Whether you're making desserts, marinades, or sauces, knowing the exact weight in ounces ensures your dish turns out perfectly. For more air fryer-friendly recipes, check out <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes</a>.</p>  

<h2>How to Measure 200g of Agave Syrup</h2>  
<p>Measuring agave syrup can be tricky due to its thick consistency. Using a digital kitchen scale is the most accurate method, but if you don’t have one, a measuring cup can work. Just remember that 200g of agave syrup equals roughly 7.05 ounces or about 0.88 cups.</p>  
<p>For air fryer recipes, precision is key. Too much or too little syrup can alter cooking times and results. If you're new to air frying, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for other common ingredient conversions.</p>  

<h3>Common Uses for Agave Syrup in Air Fryer Recipes</h3>  
<p>Agave syrup works wonderfully in glazes for meats, sweetening baked goods, or even drizzling over roasted vegetables. Its mild flavour pairs well with spices and herbs, making it versatile for both sweet and savoury dishes. Try it in air-fried tofu or as a glaze for salmon—both recipes are available on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/tofu>our tofu category</a>.</p>  

<h2>Tips for Storing Agave Syrup</h2>  
<p>Agave syrup has a long shelf life but can crystallise if not stored properly. Keep it in a cool, dark place, and ensure the lid is tightly sealed. If it thickens, gently warm the bottle in warm water to restore its pourable consistency.</p>  
<p>For more tips on maintaining your air fryer and keeping it clean for optimal performance, visit <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>our cleaning guide</a>. A well-maintained air fryer ensures even cooking and better results with every recipe.</p>  

<h3>Substitutes for Agave Syrup</h3>  
<p>If you run out of agave syrup, honey or maple syrup can be used as substitutes. However, adjust the quantity slightly, as their sweetness and consistency vary. For example, 200g of honey is roughly the same in ounces but may require minor recipe tweaks.</p>

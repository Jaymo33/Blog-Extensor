<h2>Why Convert 100g of Caster Sugar to Ounces?</h2>
<p>Many UK recipes use grams, while others rely on ounces, especially older or international cookbooks. Converting 100g of caster sugar to ounces (3.53 oz) ensures accuracy, particularly in air fryer baking where even small deviations can affect texture. Air fryers cook faster than conventional ovens, so precise measurements are crucial. If you’re exploring air fryer desserts, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipes</a> for inspiration.</p>
<p>Using the correct weight also prevents over-sweetening or dry results. Caster sugar dissolves faster than granulated sugar, making it ideal for air fryer cakes and meringues.

<h2>How to Measure 100g of Caster Sugar Without Scales</h2>
<p>If you don’t have scales, you can use volume measurements. 100g of caster sugar is roughly ½ cup, but this can vary slightly due to packing density. For air fryer recipes, we recommend weighing ingredients for the best results. A kitchen scale is a small investment that pays off in perfectly baked goods.</p>
<p>Alternatively, use tablespoons: 100g equals about 7-8 tablespoons of caster sugar. Remember, air fryers heat unevenly if batter ratios are off, so accuracy matters. For more baking hacks, visit our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>cake recipes</a> section.</p>

<h3>Does Caster Sugar Type Affect the Conversion?</h3>
<p>No, whether it’s golden or white caster sugar, 100g always equals 3.53 ounces. The difference lies in flavour and colour, not weight. In air fryer baking, both types work well, but white caster sugar gives a lighter texture. For a deeper flavour, try golden caster sugar in air fryer cookies.</p>

<h2>Common Uses for 100g of Caster Sugar in Air Fryers</h2>
<p>100g of caster sugar is perfect for small-batch air fryer desserts. It’s enough for 6-8 cupcakes, a small sponge cake, or a batch of shortbread. Air fryers excel at quick baking, and caster sugar’s fine texture ensures even mixing. Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert recipes</a> for ideas.</p>
<p>You can also use it for meringues or syrups. Since air fryers circulate hot air, sugars caramelise evenly. Just remember: 100g = 3.53 oz, and adjust other ingredients accordingly.

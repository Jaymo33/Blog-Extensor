<p>5 tablespoons (tbsp) of baking powder equals approximately 70 grams (g).

Whether you're making fluffy cakes or crispy batters, knowing the exact weight ensures consistency.

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer baking</h2>  
<p>Baking powder is a leavening agent, and even small discrepancies can affect how your air fryer recipes turn out. Too much can make cakes bitter or cause them to collapse, while too little may leave them dense. Using grams instead of tablespoons removes guesswork, ensuring your <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> are perfect every time. Digital scales are far more reliable than volume measurements, especially for ingredients like baking powder that can settle or clump.</p>  

<p>If you're adapting a traditional oven recipe for the air fryer, precise conversions are even more critical. Air fryers cook faster and hotter, so balanced ingredients are key. For example, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>air fryer cake recipes</a> rely on exact measurements to achieve the right rise and texture. Always level off tablespoons when measuring baking powder to avoid over-packing.</p>  

<h3>How to convert 5 tbsp baking powder to grams</h3>  
<p>The standard UK conversion for baking powder is 1 tablespoon = 14 grams. Therefore, 5 tablespoons of baking powder equal 70 grams. This applies to most commercial baking powders, but always check the packaging for specific density notes. If your recipe calls for 5 tbsp of baking powder and you're using a scale, simply weigh out 70 grams for accuracy.</p>  

<h2>Common baking powder measurement mistakes</h2>  
<p>One frequent error is scooping baking powder directly from the bag with a tablespoon, which can lead to uneven packing and excess. Instead, spoon the powder into the measuring spoon and level it off with a knife. Another mistake is using outdated baking powder, which loses potency over time. Test it by mixing a teaspoon with hot water—if it doesn’t bubble vigorously, replace it.</p>

<h3>Adjusting recipes for altitude or humidity</h3>  
<p>If you live in a humid climate or at high altitude, you may need to tweak baking powder amounts. Humidity can cause baking powder to clump, affecting its volume-to-weight ratio. In high-altitude baking, reducing baking powder slightly (by about 1/8 tsp per teaspoon) can prevent over-rising. Always measure by weight for the most reliable results.</p>

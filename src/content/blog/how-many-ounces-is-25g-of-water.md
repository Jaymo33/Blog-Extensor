<h2>Why Convert 25g of Water to Ounces?</h2>  
<p>Many UK air fryer recipes use grams, but some kitchen scales or international recipes might list ounces. Converting 25g of water to ounces (0.88 oz) helps avoid guesswork. This is particularly useful for baking, where even small measurement errors can affect results.

<h2>How to Measure 25g of Water Accurately</h2>  
<p>If your kitchen scale only shows ounces, here’s how to measure 25g of water (0.88 oz) precisely. Use a digital scale with unit-switching capability, or refer to a conversion table. For smaller quantities like 25g, a measuring jug with both metric and imperial markings can also work.</p>  

<h3>Using a Digital Scale</h3>  
<p>Most modern scales allow you to toggle between grams and ounces. Simply pour water until the display reads 25g or 0.88 oz. This method is ideal for recipes like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>air fryer desserts</a>, where precision matters.</p>

<p>40 grams of olive oil equals approximately 1.41 ounces. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements can make all the difference. Whether you're drizzling olive oil over vegetables or using it to coat chicken, knowing the exact weight ensures perfect results every time. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we understand the importance of accuracy in cooking, especially when it comes to oils and fats.</p>

<h2>Why Convert Grams to Ounces for Olive Oil?</h2>  
<p>Converting 40g of olive oil to ounces is crucial for those following recipes that use imperial measurements. Many air fryer recipes, especially those from the UK or US, list ingredients in ounces rather than grams. This conversion ensures you’re using the right amount of oil, which affects texture, crispiness, and overall flavour. For example, too much oil can make food soggy, while too little might leave it dry.</p>  

<p>Olive oil is a staple in many air fryer recipes, from crispy potatoes to succulent chicken. If you’re using a recipe from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>our collection</a>, you’ll often find measurements in grams, but knowing the ounce equivalent can be handy. A kitchen scale is the best tool for this, but if you don’t have one, our conversion guide will help you measure accurately.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure 40g of Olive Oil Without a Scale</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a kitchen scale, you can still measure 40g of olive oil using tablespoons. One tablespoon of olive oil weighs about 14g, so 40g is roughly 2.8 tablespoons. This method isn’t as precise as weighing, but it’s a good approximation for most recipes. Just remember that air fryer cooking often benefits from precise measurements, so investing in a scale is worthwhile.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for 40g of Olive Oil in Air Fryers</h2>  
<p>40g of olive oil is a versatile amount for many air fryer dishes. It’s enough to coat a batch of roasted vegetables or to marinate chicken for a crispy finish. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>our vegetable recipes</a>, you’ll find plenty of ideas for using olive oil to enhance flavour and texture. Whether you’re making crispy Brussels sprouts or golden sweet potatoes, 40g of oil is often the perfect quantity.</p>  

<p>Another great use for 40g of olive oil is in homemade air fryer chips. Tossing potatoes in this amount ensures they crisp up beautifully without becoming greasy.

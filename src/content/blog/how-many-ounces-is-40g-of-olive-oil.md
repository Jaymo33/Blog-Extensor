<p>40 grams of olive oil equals approximately 1.41 ounces. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements can make all the difference. Whether you're drizzling olive oil over vegetables or using it to coat chicken, knowing the exact weight ensures perfect results every time.

<h2>Why Convert Grams to Ounces for Olive Oil?</h2>  
<p>Converting 40g of olive oil to ounces is crucial for those following recipes that use imperial measurements. Many air fryer recipes, especially those from the UK or US, list ingredients in ounces rather than grams. This conversion ensures you’re using the right amount of oil, which affects texture, crispiness, and overall flavour. For example, too much oil can make food soggy, while too little might leave it dry.</p>  

<p>Olive oil is a staple in many air fryer recipes, from crispy potatoes to succulent chicken. If you’re using a recipe from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>our collection</a>, you’ll often find measurements in grams, but knowing the ounce equivalent can be handy. A kitchen scale is the best tool for this, but if you don’t have one, our conversion guide will help you measure accurately.</p>

Just remember that air fryer cooking often benefits from precise measurements, so investing in a scale is worthwhile.</p>

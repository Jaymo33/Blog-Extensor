<h3>Why this conversion matters for air fryer cooking</h3>
<p>Air fryers excel at creating crispy textures, but sauces and glazes require careful measurement.

<h2>Converting 0.125 cup tomato ketchup to ounces</h2>

One full cup equals 8 ounces, so 0.125 cup represents one-eighth of that amount. This makes it easy to remember that 0.125 cup of tomato ketchup equals 1 ounce exactly. For those using UK measurements, this conversion remains consistent as fluid ounces are nearly identical to US ounces in culinary contexts.</p>
<p>When working with air fryers, this measurement becomes particularly useful for creating small batches of sauce. Many air fryer recipes at <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipes</a> call for precise amounts of tomato ketchup in marinades. The 0.125 cup (1 ounce) measurement helps prevent over-saucing, which could lead to steaming rather than crisping in your air fryer. It's the perfect amount for coating 2-3 chicken portions without waste.</p>

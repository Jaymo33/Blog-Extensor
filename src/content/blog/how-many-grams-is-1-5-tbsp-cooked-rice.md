<h2>Why accurate rice measurements matter in air frying</h2>  
<p>Cooking rice in an air fryer requires precision, especially when adapting stovetop recipes. Too much rice can lead to uneven cooking, while too little may dry out. By converting 1.5 tbsp of cooked rice to grams, you can replicate your favourite dishes with confidence.

<p>Rice expands when cooked, so volume measurements like tablespoons can be misleading. Weighing in grams gives a more accurate result, particularly for recipes like air fryer fried rice or stuffed peppers. If you’re meal prepping, this conversion helps with portion control and nutritional tracking.</p>  

<h3>How we calculated 1.5 tbsp to grams</h3>  
<p>Our measurement is based on standard UK tablespoon sizes and average cooked white rice density. We tested multiple batches to ensure accuracy. Remember that brown rice or wild rice may vary slightly in weight due to different grain structures.</p>  

<h2>Practical uses for this conversion</h2>  
<p>This measurement is perfect for small portions in your air fryer. Use it when making rice cakes, crispy rice snacks, or as a base for <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> that call for cooked rice. It’s also handy for calculating carbs if you’re tracking macros.</p>  

<p>When reheating rice in your air fryer, 1.5 tbsp (22.5g) portions ensure even warming without drying out. Spread the rice in a thin layer for best results.

<h3>Adjusting for different rice types</h3>  
<p>While our conversion works for standard white rice, brown rice may weigh slightly more per tablespoon due to its denser structure. For specialty rices like basmati or jasmine, the difference is minimal but worth noting for precision cooking.</p>  

<h2>Converting other rice measurements</h2>  
<p>If your recipe calls for different amounts, here’s a quick reference: 1 tbsp cooked rice ≈ 15g, 2 tbsp ≈ 30g, and ¼ cup ≈ 45g. These conversions work well for most <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/meal-prep>meal prep recipes</a> in your air fryer.</p>  

<p>For larger batches, remember that 100g of cooked rice equals about 6.5 tablespoons. This helps when scaling up family-sized portions or making <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable-stuffed rice dishes</a> in your air fryer.</p>  

<h3>Tools for accurate measuring</h3>  
<p>While measuring spoons work, a digital kitchen scale gives the most precise results. Look for one with 1g increments for best accuracy when portioning rice for air fryer recipes.</p>

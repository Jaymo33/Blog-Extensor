<p>260 ml of orange juice equals approximately 1.1 cups. This conversion is essential for baking, cooking, or preparing drinks, especially when using an air fryer for recipes that require precise measurements. Whether you're making a glaze, marinade, or a refreshing beverage, knowing how to convert millilitres to cups ensures your dish turns out perfectly every time.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter</h2>
<p>Precision is key in cooking and baking, and measuring liquids like orange juice correctly can make or break a recipe. Using 260 ml of orange juice instead of the required 1.1 cups could throw off the balance of flavours or textures. For air fryer recipes, where ingredients often need to be evenly distributed, accurate measurements are even more critical. If you're exploring recipes on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, you'll notice how precise measurements lead to consistent results.</p>

<p>Many recipes, especially those for cakes or glazes, rely on the acidity and sweetness of orange juice. A slight miscalculation could affect the final product. For example, too much juice might make a cake soggy, while too little could leave it dry. This is why understanding conversions like 260 ml to cups is so valuable for home cooks and bakers alike.</p>

<h2>How to Measure 260 ml of Orange Juice</h2>
<p>To measure 260 ml of orange juice accurately, you can use a liquid measuring cup with millilitre markings. If your cup only has cup measurements, remember that 1 cup is roughly 240 ml, so 260 ml is just over 1 cup. For recipes requiring exact measurements, it's best to use a kitchen scale or a measuring jug with clear millilitre indicators.</p>

<p>When working with air fryer recipes, such as those found on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, precision ensures even cooking and perfect texture. For instance, a marinade with 260 ml of orange juice might need slight adjustments if you're converting from cups. Always double-check your measurements to avoid disappointment.</p>

<h3>US vs UK Cup Measurements</h3>
<p>It's worth noting that US and UK cup measurements differ slightly. A US cup is 240 ml, while a UK cup is 250 ml. For 260 ml of orange juice, this means approximately 1.08 US cups or 1.04 UK cups. While the difference is minimal, it can matter in recipes requiring high precision, such as baking or making syrups.</p>

<h2>Common Uses for 260 ml of Orange Juice</h2>
<p>260 ml of orange juice is a versatile measurement used in many recipes. From glazes for air-fried chicken to citrus-infused desserts, this amount is often called for. For example, a tangy orange glaze for salmon might require 260 ml of juice mixed with honey and spices. You can find inspiration for such dishes on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/salmon>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>.</p>

<p>Another popular use is in baking, where orange juice adds moisture and flavour to cakes and muffins. A 260 ml measurement might be used in a batch of orange-infused cupcakes or a drizzle for a citrus loaf. The acidity also helps activate baking soda, making it a key ingredient in many recipes.</p>

<h3>Converting Other Orange Juice Measurements</h3>
<p>If your recipe calls for a different amount of orange juice, you can use the same principles to convert it. For example, 125 ml is roughly 0.5 cups, and 500 ml is about 2.1 cups. Keeping a conversion chart handy, like the one on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, can save time and ensure accuracy.</p>

<h2>Tips for Measuring Orange Juice</h2>
<p>When measuring orange juice, always use fresh juice or check the label if using store-bought, as some brands may have added sugars or preservatives that affect the recipe. For the most accurate results, strain the juice to remove pulp before measuring. This ensures you're working with a consistent liquid volume.</p>

<p>If you're using an air fryer, remember that citrus juices can caramelise quickly due to their sugar content. A marinade or glaze with 260 ml of orange juice might need less cooking time than other liquids.

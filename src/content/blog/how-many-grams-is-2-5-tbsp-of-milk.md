<h2>Why converting 2.5 tbsp of milk to grams matters</h2>  
<p>When cooking or baking, especially in an air fryer, precision is key. Converting 2.5 tbsp of milk into grams helps avoid guesswork, ensuring your recipes turn out just right. Air fryers cook food quickly, and even small measurement errors can affect texture and taste. For example, adding too much milk to a batter can make it too runny, while too little can dry it out.</p>  

<p>Many air fryer recipes, like those on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, rely on exact measurements for best results.

<h2>How to measure 2.5 tbsp of milk accurately</h2>  
<p>Measuring 2.5 tbsp of milk can be tricky if you don’t have the right tools. A standard UK tablespoon holds 15ml, so 2.5 tbsp equals 37.5ml.

<h3>Using a digital scale</h3>  
<p>If you’re serious about accuracy, a digital scale is your best friend. Place your mixing bowl on the scale, tare it to zero, then pour in the milk until it reads 37 grams. This method eliminates any guesswork and ensures your air fryer recipes, like those in our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>, turn out perfectly every time.</p>

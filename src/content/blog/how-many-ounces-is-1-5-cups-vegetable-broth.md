<p>1.5 cups of vegetable broth equals 12 fluid ounces (or approximately 12 oz by weight for most standard broths). This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise liquid measurements can affect cooking times and textures. Whether you’re making soups, stews, or marinades, knowing how many ounces are in 1.5 cups of vegetable broth ensures consistent results.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on rapid air circulation to cook food evenly, and liquids like vegetable broth play a crucial role in keeping dishes moist. Using the correct amount—such as 12 ounces for 1.5 cups—prevents over-drying or sogginess. For example, a <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>vegetable broth-based marinade</a> for chicken or tofu needs precise ratios to avoid uneven cooking.</p>  

<p>Many air fryer recipes, especially those for <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/potatoes>potatoes</a> or grains, call for small amounts of broth. A slight miscalculation could lead to undercooked or overly saturated results. That’s why we recommend using a kitchen scale for liquids like vegetable broth when precision is key.</p>  

<h3>Converting cups to ounces for UK cooks</h3>  
<p>In the UK, fluid ounces (fl oz) are the standard for liquid measurements, and 1.5 cups of vegetable broth translates to 12 UK fluid ounces. This is particularly useful when following American recipes, which often use cup measurements. For air fryer dishes like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>roasted vegetables</a>, this ensures your broth-based glaze or seasoning is perfectly balanced.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for 1.5 cups of vegetable broth in air fryers</h2>  
<p>From deglazing pans to creating steam for delicate foods, 12 ounces of vegetable broth is a versatile ingredient. It’s ideal for cooking grains like quinoa or rice in the air fryer, where the broth infuses extra flavour. You can also use it to baste proteins like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/tofu>tofu</a> or turkey during cooking.</p>  

<p>Another popular use is in air fryer soups or broths, where 1.5 cups (12 oz) forms the base. For example, a miso soup or a light broth for poaching fish benefits from this measured amount. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more liquid measurement tips.</p>  

<h3>Tips for measuring vegetable broth accurately</h3>  
<p>To measure 1.5 cups (12 oz) of vegetable broth, use a clear liquid measuring cup placed on a flat surface. Bend down to check the meniscus at eye level for precision. For thicker broths or stocks, a kitchen scale set to ounces ensures the most accurate result, especially when scaling recipes up or down.</p>

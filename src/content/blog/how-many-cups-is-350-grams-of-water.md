<h2>Why Accurate Water Measurements Matter in Air Frying</h2>
<p>Air fryers rely on precise ingredient ratios to achieve the perfect texture and doneness. Adding too much or too little water can affect cooking times and outcomes. For example, 350 grams of water in cups translates to roughly 1.48 cups, but slight variations can impact recipes like steamed buns or batters.

Even small deviations can lead to soggy or dry results, so accuracy is key.</p>

<p>Water is often used in air fryer recipes to create steam, which helps keep foods moist.

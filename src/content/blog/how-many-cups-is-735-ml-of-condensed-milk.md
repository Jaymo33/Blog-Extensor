<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Precision is key when using an air fryer, as even small measurement errors can affect texture and cooking time.

For example, if you're making a <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>decadent air fryer cake</a>, too much condensed milk can make it soggy, while too little can leave it dry.</p>  

<p>Air fryers circulate hot air rapidly, so ingredients like condensed milk must be balanced with other components. A slight variation in measurement can throw off the entire recipe. That’s why knowing that 735 ml of condensed milk equals roughly 3.1 cups is so helpful.

<h3>How to Measure 735 ml of Condensed Milk Without a Scale</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a kitchen scale, use a liquid measuring cup for accuracy. Pour the condensed milk slowly, ensuring it settles evenly. For sticky ingredients like condensed milk, lightly greasing the cup can help it slide out cleanly. This method ensures you get the correct 3.1 cups from 735 ml, keeping your <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert recipes</a> perfectly balanced.</p>

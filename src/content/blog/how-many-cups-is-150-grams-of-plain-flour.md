<p>150 grams of plain flour equals approximately 1.2 cups in UK measurements or 1.25 cups in US measurements. This conversion is essential for air fryer baking, where precision ensures your cakes, breads, and batters turn out perfectly. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we know how frustrating inaccurate measurements can be, so we’ve done the maths for you.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Flour Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Baking</h2>
<p>Getting the right amount of plain flour is crucial when using your air fryer. Too much flour can make baked goods dense, while too little can leave them crumbly. Since air fryers cook faster than conventional ovens, small measurement errors are amplified. Whether you’re making <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>air fryer cakes</a> or coating chicken, 150 grams of plain flour should be measured carefully. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a> takes the guesswork out of the process.</p>

<p>Different types of flour have varying densities, which is why we specify plain flour here. Self-raising flour, for example, would yield a slightly different cup measurement due to added raising agents. For consistent results, always spoon flour into your measuring cup and level it off with a knife. This method avoids compacting the flour, which could lead to using more than 150 grams unintentionally.</p>

<h3>UK vs US Cup Measurements for 150 Grams of Plain Flour</h3>
<p>In the UK, 150 grams of plain flour equals roughly 1.2 cups, while in the US, it’s about 1.25 cups. This difference stems from variations in standard cup sizes between countries. If you’re following a recipe from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>our collection</a>, check whether it uses UK or US measurements to avoid mishaps. For most air fryer recipes, the small difference won’t ruin your dish, but for delicate bakes like soufflés, precision matters.</p>

<h2>How to Measure 150 Grams of Plain Flour Without Scales</h2>
<p>If you don’t have kitchen scales, you can still measure 150 grams of plain flour accurately using cups. Fill your measuring cup with flour using a spoon, then level it off with a straight edge. Remember that 1 UK cup of plain flour weighs approximately 125 grams, so you’ll need just under 1¼ cups for 150 grams. For US cups, which hold about 120 grams of plain flour, you’ll need 1¼ cups. This method works well for most <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cookies>air fryer cookies</a> and batters.</p>

<p>Another handy trick is the tablespoon method. There are about 8 grams of plain flour in a level tablespoon, meaning 150 grams equals roughly 19 tablespoons. While not as precise as weighing, this can work in a pinch for coatings or thicker batters. After cooking, always <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>clean your air fryer</a> properly to prevent flour residue from burning during future use.</p>

<h3>Common Recipes Using 150 Grams of Plain Flour</h3>
<p>Many air fryer recipes call for around 150 grams of plain flour. This quantity is perfect for coating chicken pieces, making small batches of pancakes, or creating light batter for fish. When preparing <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>air fryer chicken</a>, the 150 grams measurement ensures just enough coating without being overly heavy. For sweet treats, 150 grams of plain flour forms the base of many cupcake and muffin recipes designed specifically for air fryers.</p>

<p>1.66 cups of shredded coconut equals approximately 5.3 ounces (150 grams). This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes, where precise measurements can make all the difference. Whether you’re baking coconut macaroons or adding texture to a dish, knowing the weight ensures perfect results every time.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of shredded coconut can affect the texture and flavour of your air fryer recipes. Too little, and your dish might lack crunch; too much, and it could become dry. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we emphasise precision for consistent results. Many of our recipes, like coconut shrimp or crispy chicken tenders, rely on shredded coconut for that perfect finish.</p>  
<p>Converting cups to ounces is especially useful when scaling recipes up or down. If you’re preparing a larger batch of coconut-crusted fish or a smaller portion of granola, knowing that 1.66 cups of shredded coconut is roughly 5.3 ounces helps maintain balance. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more handy measurements.</p>  

<h2>How to Measure Shredded Coconut Correctly</h2>  
<p>For the most accurate conversion, lightly pack the shredded coconut into your measuring cup. Don’t press it down too firmly, as this can compact the flakes and skew the weight. If you’re using a kitchen scale, tare it with the measuring cup first, then add the coconut until you reach 5.3 ounces (or 150 grams).</p>  

<h3>Common Uses for Shredded Coconut in Air Fryer Recipes</h3>  
<p>Shredded coconut adds a delightful crunch to both sweet and savoury dishes. Try it in air-fried banana fritters, coconut-crusted prawns, or as a topping for overnight oats. For more inspiration, browse our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> collection, where coconut features in everything from desserts to main courses.</p>  

<h2>Converting Other Coconut Measurements</h2>  
<p>If your recipe calls for a different amount of shredded coconut, here’s a quick reference: 1 cup equals about 3.2 ounces (90 grams), while 2 cups weigh roughly 6.4 ounces (180 grams). These conversions are handy for adjusting portion sizes or substituting ingredients. For example, if you’re making a half-batch of coconut cookies, you’ll need 2.65 ounces (75 grams) for 0.83 cups.</p>  
<p>Remember, shredded coconut isn’t the same as desiccated or flaked coconut, which have different weights per cup. Always check the recipe notes for specifics. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert category</a> includes several coconut-based treats where these measurements come in handy.</p>  

<h3>Tips for Storing Shredded Coconut</h3>  
<p>To keep shredded coconut fresh, store it in an airtight container in a cool, dark place. If you’ve opened a large bag, consider transferring it to a jar to prevent staleness. Proper storage ensures your coconut stays fluffy and ready for your next air fryer creation.</p>

<p>Yogurt is a versatile ingredient in air fryer cooking, from tenderising meats to adding moisture to baked goods. Whether you’re preparing a <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipe</a> or a <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert</a>, knowing how many grams 2.25 cups of yogurt equals helps streamline your cooking process. This accuracy is especially useful for meal prep, where consistency is key.</p>  

<h3>Types of Yogurt and Their Weights</h3>  
<p>Not all yogurts weigh the same per cup due to differences in thickness and fat content. Greek yogurt, for instance, is denser than regular yogurt, so 2.25 cups may weigh closer to 600 grams. Always check the label or use a kitchen scale for the most accurate measurement, especially when following air fryer recipes where precision matters.</p>  

<h2>Converting Cups to Grams for Air Fryer Recipes</h2>  
<p>Converting 2.25 cups of yogurt to grams (540g) simplifies recipe scaling, whether you’re cooking for one or a crowd. This conversion is particularly useful for air fryer users, as many recipes require exact measurements to achieve the perfect crisp or tenderness. Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a> for ideas on how to use yogurt in your air fryer creations.</p>  

<p>If you’re working with frozen yogurt or other variations, remember that the weight may differ slightly. For best results, measure yogurt by weight rather than volume when possible. This ensures your air fryer dishes turn out just right, whether you’re baking, marinating, or making dips.</p>  

<h3>Tips for Measuring Yogurt Without a Scale</h3>  
<p>No kitchen scale? No problem! Use the spoon-and-level method: spoon yogurt into a measuring cup and level it off with a knife. For 2.25 cups, fill two cups completely and add a quarter cup. While this method isn’t as precise as weighing, it’s a handy alternative for quick conversions.</p>

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air frying</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on even cooking, and incorrect ingredient quantities can lead to uneven results. Too much garlic paste might overpower your dish, while too little could leave it bland. Converting 0.66 cup of garlic paste to ounces (5.28 oz) ensures balanced flavours.

This precision is especially useful for recipes like garlic butter shrimp or marinated chicken.</p>  

<h2>How to measure garlic paste for air fryer recipes</h2>  
<p>Garlic paste is denser than liquids, so using a kitchen scale is the most accurate method. If you don’t have one, spoon the paste into a measuring cup and level it off. For 0.66 cup, you’ll need roughly 5.28 ounces. This measurement works perfectly for dishes like garlic roasted potatoes or marinated tofu.

<h3>Common uses for 0.66 cup of garlic paste</h3>

<h2>Converting other garlic paste measurements</h2>

<p>1.33 cups of chopped onion equals approximately 5.3 ounces (150 grams) in the UK. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements ensure even cooking and perfect texture. Whether you’re making crispy onion rings or adding onions to a stir-fry, knowing the exact weight saves time and guarantees consistency. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we focus on accurate conversions to help you master air frying. Keep reading for tips on measuring onions and adapting recipes for your air fryer.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate onion measurements matter in air frying</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on even heat distribution, so ingredient quantities must be precise. Too much onion can lead to steaming instead of crisping, while too little may dry out your dish. Chopped onion is a common ingredient in recipes like fajitas, burgers, and casseroles, all of which benefit from exact measurements. For more conversion help, check our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>. If you love onion-based dishes, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable recipes</a> for inspiration.</p>  

<h3>How to measure chopped onion correctly</h3>  
<p>Use a dry measuring cup for chopped onion, pressing lightly to avoid gaps. For 1.33 cups, fill the cup just above the 1 1/3 mark without compacting. A kitchen scale is even better—simply weigh out 5.3 ounces (150 grams) for accuracy. If you’re prepping ahead, note that onion weight can vary slightly based on moisture content. Store unused chopped onion in an airtight container to maintain freshness.</p>  

<h2>Converting cups to ounces for other ingredients</h2>  
<p>Many air fryer recipes use cup measurements, but weight (ounces or grams) is more reliable. For example, 1 cup of grated cheese equals about 3.5 ounces, while 1 cup of flour is roughly 4.2 ounces. Always refer to a trusted conversion guide, especially for baking. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a> includes weight-based measurements for foolproof results. Need to clean your air fryer after cooking? Try our recommended <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning methods</a>.</p>  

<h3>Common air fryer recipes using chopped onion</h3>  
<p>From caramelised onions to crispy toppings, onions add flavour and texture. Try them in air-fryer onion bhajis, stuffed peppers, or as a base for meat dishes. For a quick meal, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/beef>beef recipes</a> often include onions for extra richness. Remember, 1.33 cups (5.3 ounces) of chopped onion is ideal for recipes serving 2–3 people. Adjust quantities based on your air fryer’s capacity.</p>

<h2>Why accurate onion measurements matter in air frying</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on even heat distribution, so ingredient quantities must be precise. Too much onion can lead to steaming instead of crisping, while too little may dry out your dish. Chopped onion is a common ingredient in recipes like fajitas, burgers, and casseroles, all of which benefit from exact measurements.

<h3>How to measure chopped onion correctly</h3>  
<p>Use a dry measuring cup for chopped onion, pressing lightly to avoid gaps. For 1.33 cups, fill the cup just above the 1 1/3 mark without compacting. A kitchen scale is even better—simply weigh out 5.3 ounces (150 grams) for accuracy. If you’re prepping ahead, note that onion weight can vary slightly based on moisture content. Store unused chopped onion in an airtight container to maintain freshness.</p>  

<h2>Converting cups to ounces for other ingredients</h2>  
<p>Many air fryer recipes use cup measurements, but weight (ounces or grams) is more reliable. For example, 1 cup of grated cheese equals about 3.5 ounces, while 1 cup of flour is roughly 4.2 ounces. Always refer to a trusted conversion guide, especially for baking. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a> includes weight-based measurements for foolproof results.

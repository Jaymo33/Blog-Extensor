<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter</h2>

<h3>UK vs. US Cup Measurements</h3>  
<p>It’s worth noting that UK and US cup measurements differ slightly. In the UK, 1 cup is typically 250 ml, while in the US, it’s 240 ml. For single cream, we use the US standard (240 ml) unless specified otherwise. Always double-check the recipe origin to avoid discrepancies.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for Single Cream in Air Fryers</h2>  
<p>Single cream is versatile in air fryer cooking. It’s perfect for creamy sauces, like a garlic mushroom sauce for chicken or a rich topping for <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>desserts</a>. You can also use it in batters for cakes or as a base for custards. The 240 ml measurement ensures your dish has the right consistency.</p>  

<p>Another popular use is in scrambled eggs or quiches, where single cream adds richness. For best results, measure carefully and avoid overheating, as single cream can separate.

<h3>Tips for Measuring Single Cream</h3>  
<p>For accuracy, use a liquid measuring cup rather than dry cups. Fill it to the 240 ml mark at eye level to avoid over- or under-pouring. If your recipe calls for a different amount, adjust proportionally—e.g., 0.5 cups would be 120 ml.</p>  

<h2>Converting Other Cream Types</h2>  
<p>While this guide focuses on single cream, other creams like double or whipping cream have similar densities. However, their fat content affects texture, so substitutions may alter results. Always refer to specific recipe guidelines on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> for best practices.</p>

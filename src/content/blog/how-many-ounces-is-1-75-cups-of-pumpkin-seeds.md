<p>1.75 cups of pumpkin seeds equals approximately 7.5 ounces (oz). This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes, where precise measurements ensure even cooking and perfect texture. Whether you're roasting pumpkin seeds for a snack or using them in a recipe, knowing the exact weight helps avoid under or over-seasoning. For more air fryer measurement tips, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of ingredients ensures your air fryer recipes turn out perfectly every time. Pumpkin seeds, for example, can vary in density, so measuring by weight (ounces) is more reliable than volume (cups). This is especially important when roasting seeds, as overcrowding the basket can lead to uneven cooking. For more air fryer tips, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a>.</p>  

<p>Air fryers circulate hot air rapidly, so even small measurement discrepancies can affect cooking times and results. If you’re using 1.75 cups of pumpkin seeds, converting to ounces helps standardise your recipe. This precision is key whether you’re making a savoury snack or incorporating seeds into baked goods. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/snacks>snack recipes</a> for inspiration.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure Pumpkin Seeds for Air Frying</h3>  
<p>To measure 1.75 cups of pumpkin seeds accurately, use a kitchen scale for the most reliable results. Scoop the seeds into a measuring cup without packing them down, then weigh them to confirm they’re around 7.5 ounces. This method eliminates guesswork and ensures consistency, whether you’re roasting or baking.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for Pumpkin Seeds in Air Fryer Recipes</h2>  
<p>Pumpkin seeds are versatile and can be used in both sweet and savoury air fryer dishes. Roasted pumpkin seeds make a crunchy snack, while ground seeds add texture to coatings or batters. Knowing that 1.75 cups equals 7.5 ounces helps you portion them correctly for recipes like granola or energy bars.

<p>If you’re preparing a large batch, converting cups to ounces ensures uniformity. For example, 1.75 cups of pumpkin seeds (7.5 oz) can be evenly seasoned and roasted in a single layer in the air fryer basket. This prevents clumping and promotes even crisping. For cleaning tips after cooking, see our guide on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer maintenance</a>.</p>  

<h3>Tips for Roasting Pumpkin Seeds in an Air Fryer</h3>  
<p>For perfectly roasted pumpkin seeds, preheat your air fryer to 160°C (320°F). Toss 7.5 ounces (1.75 cups) of seeds with a bit of oil and salt, then spread them in a single layer. Cook for 10–12 minutes, shaking the basket halfway, until golden and crisp. Adjust seasoning as needed for a personalised snack.</p>

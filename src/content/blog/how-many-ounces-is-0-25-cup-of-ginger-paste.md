<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on even cooking, and incorrect ingredient quantities can throw off the balance. Too much ginger paste might overpower your dish, while too little could leave it bland. Measuring 0.25 cup of ginger paste correctly (2 ounces) ensures your flavours are spot-on. This is especially crucial for recipes like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer chicken tikka</a>, where ginger paste plays a starring role.</p>  

<p>Using a kitchen scale for ounces is the most accurate method, but if you don’t have one, measuring cups will do. Just remember that ginger paste’s density can vary slightly, so 0.25 cup might not always be exactly 2 ounces. For best results, stick to trusted brands or homemade pastes with consistent textures.</p>  

<h3>How to measure ginger paste without a scale</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a scale, use a liquid measuring cup for ginger paste. Fill it to the 0.25 cup mark, ensuring the paste is level for accuracy. Alternatively, 2 tablespoons equal 0.25 cup, which is roughly 2 ounces. This trick works well for small quantities in recipes like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>air fryer roasted vegetables</a>.</p>

<h3>Storing ginger paste for future use</h3>

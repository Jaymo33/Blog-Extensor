<p>860 ml of coconut milk equals approximately 3.63 cups in the US measurement system and 3.02 cups in the UK measurement system. Whether you're preparing a creamy curry or baking a tropical dessert, knowing this conversion ensures your recipes turn out perfectly every time. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we understand how precise measurements can make or break a dish, especially when using an air fryer.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on even heat distribution, and incorrect measurements can lead to uneven cooking or overly dense textures. Coconut milk, with its rich consistency, needs precise measurement to avoid overpowering other ingredients. For example, using too much can make a dish overly rich, while too little might leave it lacking creaminess.

<p>Many air fryer recipes, like coconut shrimp or Thai-inspired curries, call for coconut milk. If you're adapting a recipe from metric to cups, knowing that 860 ml of coconut milk is roughly 3.63 US cups (or 3.02 UK cups) ensures consistency. This is especially useful for batch cooking or meal prep, where scaling up or down is common.</p>  

<h3>US vs. UK Cup Measurements for Coconut Milk</h3>  
<p>The difference between US and UK cup measurements can catch cooks off guard. A US cup holds 240 ml, while a UK cup holds 284 ml. This means 860 ml of coconut milk converts to 3.63 US cups but only 3.02 UK cups. Always check which system your recipe uses to avoid mishaps.

<h2>How to Measure 860 ml of Coconut Milk Without a Scale</h2>  
<p>If you don't have a measuring jug, you can use standard cups to measure 860 ml of coconut milk. In the US, this would be just under 3 and 2/3 cups. In the UK, it's roughly 3 cups plus a tablespoon. Shake the coconut milk well before measuring, as it separates in the can. For more precision, consider using a liquid measuring cup with millilitre markings.</p>  

<p>When working with air fryer recipes, consistency is key. Too much liquid can lead to steaming instead of crisping, so measuring coconut milk accurately ensures your dishes cook as intended.

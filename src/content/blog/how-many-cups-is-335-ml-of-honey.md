<p>335 ml of honey equals approximately 1.42 cups in US measurements or 1.18 cups in UK measurements. Whether you're baking honey-glazed chicken in your air fryer or whipping up a dessert, knowing this conversion ensures accuracy. Honey's thickness can make measuring tricky, but we'll simplify it for you.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Honey Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of honey is crucial for air fryer recipes, as too much can cause sticking or burning. For example, a honey-glazed salmon or crispy tofu dish relies on precise measurements. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we recommend measuring honey by weight for consistency, but cups are handy for quick conversions.</p>  
<p>Honey’s viscosity means it doesn’t pour like water, so levelling off the cup is essential. If you’re adapting a recipe from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>our collection</a>, note whether it uses UK or US cup sizes—this affects the outcome. A slight variation might not ruin a dish, but precision ensures perfect results every time.</p>  

<h2>Converting 335 ml of Honey to Cups</h2>  
<p>In the US, 1 cup equals 240 ml, so 335 ml is roughly 1.42 cups. In the UK, 1 cup is 284 ml, making 335 ml about 1.18 cups. This difference matters for recipes like honey cakes or marinades. Check your air fryer’s manual or <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>our conversion chart</a> for tailored advice.</p>  
<p>For sticky ingredients like honey, lightly greasing the measuring cup helps it slide out cleanly. If you’re preparing a <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>honey-mustard chicken recipe</a>, this trick saves time and mess.

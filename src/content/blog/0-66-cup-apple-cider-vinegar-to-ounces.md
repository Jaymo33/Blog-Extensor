<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Precision is key when it comes to air fryer recipes, especially with liquids like apple cider vinegar. Too much or too little can alter the flavour and texture of your dish. For example, 0.66 cup of apple cider vinegar to ounces translates to 5.28 oz, which is crucial for balancing acidity in marinades or dressings. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> makes it easy to switch between units, so you never have to guess.</p>  

<p>Using the correct amount of apple cider vinegar ensures your food isn’t overly tangy or bland. This is particularly important for recipes like air-fried chicken wings or glazed vegetables, where the vinegar’s acidity plays a starring role. If you’re unsure about conversions, our guide takes the guesswork out of measuring, so you can focus on cooking.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure 0.66 Cup of Apple Cider Vinegar</h3>  
<p>Measuring 0.66 cup of apple cider vinegar might seem tricky, but it’s simpler than you think. A standard US cup holds 8 fluid ounces, so 0.66 cup is roughly two-thirds of that. For UK cooks, this means 5.28 ounces, as the UK fluid ounce is slightly different. A kitchen scale or liquid measuring cup with clear markings will give you the most accurate result.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for Apple Cider Vinegar in Air Fryer Recipes</h2>

At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we focus on accurate conversions to help you cook with confidence. Let’s dive deeper into lentil measurements and air fryer cooking tips.</p>  

<h2>Understanding Lentil Measurements</h2>  
<p>Lentils come in various types, including green, red, and brown, but their weight-to-cup ratio remains fairly consistent. For 150 grams of lentils, you’ll need just under a full cup in most cases. This measurement is crucial for air fryer recipes, where overcrowding can affect cooking times. If you’re using a UK cup (250ml), 150 grams of lentils equals approximately 0.75 cups. For US cups (240ml), it’s closer to 0.85 cups. Always check your recipe’s origin to ensure accuracy.</p>

Whether you’re meal prepping or experimenting with new recipes, precision is key. Don’t forget to rinse lentils before cooking to remove any debris.</p>  

<h3>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryers</h3>  
<p>Air fryers rely on hot air circulation, so overcrowding the basket can lead to unevenly cooked lentils. Using the correct cup measurement for 150 grams of lentils ensures optimal air flow.

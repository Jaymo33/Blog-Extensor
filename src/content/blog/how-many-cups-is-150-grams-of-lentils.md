<p>150 grams of lentils is roughly equivalent to 0.75 UK cups or 0.85 US cups. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes, where precise measurements can make or break a dish. Whether you're making lentil patties, soups, or casseroles, knowing the exact cup measurement ensures consistent results. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we focus on accurate conversions to help you cook with confidence. Let’s dive deeper into lentil measurements and air fryer cooking tips.</p>  

<h2>Understanding Lentil Measurements</h2>  
<p>Lentils come in various types, including green, red, and brown, but their weight-to-cup ratio remains fairly consistent. For 150 grams of lentils, you’ll need just under a full cup in most cases. This measurement is crucial for air fryer recipes, where overcrowding can affect cooking times. If you’re using a UK cup (250ml), 150 grams of lentils equals approximately 0.75 cups. For US cups (240ml), it’s closer to 0.85 cups. Always check your recipe’s origin to ensure accuracy.</p>  

<p>For more conversion help, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> covers common ingredients. Lentils are a staple in many air fryer dishes, from crispy snacks to hearty mains. Measuring them correctly ensures even cooking and perfect texture. Whether you’re meal prepping or experimenting with new recipes, precision is key. Don’t forget to rinse lentils before cooking to remove any debris.</p>  

<h3>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryers</h3>  
<p>Air fryers rely on hot air circulation, so overcrowding the basket can lead to unevenly cooked lentils. Using the correct cup measurement for 150 grams of lentils ensures optimal air flow. This is especially important for recipes like lentil falafel or stuffed peppers. If you’re unsure, err on the side of less—you can always cook in batches. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>lentil recipe collection</a> for inspiration.</p>  

<h2>Converting 150 Grams of Lentils to Cups</h2>  
<p>Converting 150 grams of lentils to cups depends on the cup size and lentil type. Here’s a quick reference: UK cups (250ml) = 0.75 cups, US cups (240ml) = 0.85 cups. For smaller quantities, use a kitchen scale for precision. If you don’t have one, fluff the lentils lightly before measuring to avoid compaction. This ensures your air fryer dishes turn out perfectly every time.</p>  

<p>Need more lentil-based ideas? Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable category</a> includes creative ways to use lentils. From air-fried lentil burgers to crispy snacks, the possibilities are endless. Remember, 150 grams of lentils is a versatile amount—enough for two servings or a family-sized side dish. Adjust seasonings and cooking times based on your air fryer model.</p>  

<h3>Tips for Cooking Lentils in an Air Fryer</h3>  
<p>Pre-soaking lentils can reduce cooking time and improve texture. For 150 grams of lentils, soak for 30 minutes if using them in patties or loaves. Drain well before mixing with other ingredients. Lightly oiling the air fryer basket prevents sticking, especially for crispy lentil dishes.

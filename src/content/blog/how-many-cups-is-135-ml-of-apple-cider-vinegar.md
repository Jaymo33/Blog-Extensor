<p>135 ml of apple cider vinegar equals approximately 0.57 cups in US measurements or 0.48 cups in UK measurements. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precision matters, whether you're marinating chicken, baking cakes, or preparing dressings. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we understand the importance of accurate measurements for perfect results every time.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Using the correct amount of apple cider vinegar ensures your dishes have the right balance of acidity and flavour. Too much can overpower, while too little might leave your meal tasting bland. For air fryer recipes like crispy chicken wings or tangy glazed salmon, 135 ml of apple cider vinegar is a common measurement. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for quick reference on other liquid measurements.</p>  

<p>Apple cider vinegar is a versatile ingredient, often used in marinades, dressings, and even baking. Whether you're following a recipe from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>our collection</a> or experimenting with your own creations, knowing how to convert 135 ml to cups is invaluable. This small detail can make a big difference in texture and taste.</p>  

<h3>US vs UK Cup Measurements</h3>  
<p>It’s important to note that US and UK cup measurements differ slightly. A US cup is 240 ml, while a UK cup is 284 ml. This means 135 ml of apple cider vinegar is about 0.57 US cups or 0.48 UK cups. Always check which measurement system your recipe uses to avoid mistakes.</p>  

<h2>How to Measure 135 ml of Apple Cider Vinegar Without a Measuring Cup</h2>  
<p>If you don’t have a measuring cup handy, you can use tablespoons or teaspoons as a substitute. There are roughly 15 ml in a tablespoon, so 135 ml equals about 9 tablespoons. Alternatively, use a kitchen scale—135 ml of apple cider vinegar weighs approximately 135 grams. For more tips, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipes</a>, where apple cider vinegar is often used.</p>  

<p>Another handy trick is to repurpose a clean, standard drinking glass. Many hold around 200–250 ml, so filling it just over halfway will give you close to 135 ml. Remember, accuracy is key for recipes like air fryer pulled pork or pickled vegetables, where apple cider vinegar plays a starring role.</p>  

<h3>Common Recipes Using 135 ml of Apple Cider Vinegar</h3>  
<p>From tangy BBQ sauces to healthy salad dressings, 135 ml of apple cider vinegar is a popular quantity. Try it in our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable recipes</a> for a zesty kick. It’s also great for deglazing pans or adding depth to soups and stews cooked in the air fryer.</p>  

<h2>Cleaning Your Air Fryer After Using Apple Cider Vinegar</h2>  
<p>Apple cider vinegar can leave behind strong odours if not cleaned properly. Mix equal parts water and vinegar, then wipe down your air fryer basket and tray. For stubborn residues, check out our guide on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaning</a> to keep your appliance in top condition.</p>  

<p>Regular maintenance ensures your air fryer performs optimally, whether you're cooking crispy tofu or marinated beef. A clean appliance also prevents unwanted flavours from transferring between dishes, especially when using potent ingredients like apple cider vinegar.</p>

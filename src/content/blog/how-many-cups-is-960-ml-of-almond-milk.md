<p>960 ml of almond milk equals approximately 4.06 cups. This conversion is essential for anyone using an air fryer, as precise measurements can make or break a recipe. Whether you're whipping up a dairy-free cake or a creamy sauce, knowing how to convert millilitres to cups ensures consistent results every time.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of almond milk can affect the texture and taste of your dish. Too little, and your batter might be too thick; too much, and it could become runny. Air fryers cook food quickly, so precise measurements help avoid undercooked or overcooked meals. For more air fryer tips, check out <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>our conversion chart</a> to simplify your cooking process.</p>  

<p>Almond milk is a popular dairy-free alternative, but its consistency can vary between brands. Measuring 960 ml accurately ensures your recipes turn out perfectly every time. Whether you're making pancakes, muffins, or a savoury sauce, this conversion will come in handy. Visit <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>our recipe collection</a> for inspiration on using almond milk in your air fryer.</p>  

<h2>How to Measure 960 ml of Almond Milk</h2>  
<p>If you don't have a measuring jug, you can use standard cups to measure 960 ml of almond milk. A US cup holds about 237 ml, while a UK cup is slightly larger at 284 ml. For 960 ml, you'd need roughly 4 US cups or 3.38 UK cups. Always double-check your measurements for the best results.</p>  

<h3>Using a Kitchen Scale for Precision</h3>  
<p>For even greater accuracy, weigh your almond milk. One millilitre of almond milk weighs approximately 1 gram, so 960 ml equals 960 grams. This method eliminates guesswork and ensures your air fryer recipes turn out perfectly every time.</p>  

<h2>Common Recipes Using 960 ml of Almond Milk</h2>  
<p>Many air fryer recipes call for almond milk, from creamy pasta sauces to fluffy desserts. A batch of dairy-free pancakes might require 960 ml, while a large cake could use this amount for a moist crumb. Explore <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert recipes</a> to find delicious ways to use this measurement.</p>

<h3>Storing Leftover Almond Milk</h3>  
<p>If you don't use all 960 ml at once, store the remainder in an airtight container in the fridge. Shake well before using, as almond milk can separate over time. Always check the expiry date to ensure freshness.</p>

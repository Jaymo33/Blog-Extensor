<p>2 cups of cooked rice weigh approximately 16 ounces (or 1 pound). This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes, ensuring accurate portioning and perfect results every time. Whether you’re meal prepping or cooking a quick dinner, knowing this measurement helps streamline your process.</p>  

<h2>Why measuring cooked rice matters for air fryer recipes</h2>  
<p>Accurate measurements are crucial when using an air fryer, as overcrowding or underfilling can affect cooking times and texture. Cooked rice, in particular, can vary in density, so converting 2 cups to ounces ensures consistency. For example, if you’re making <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer stuffed peppers</a>, precise rice measurements help balance the filling. Plus, knowing the weight saves time when scaling recipes up or down.</p>  

<p>Many air fryer recipes, like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken and rice dishes</a>, rely on cooked rice as a base. Measuring 2 cups of cooked rice in ounces (16 oz) ensures even cooking and prevents soggy or dry results. If you’re meal prepping, this conversion makes it easy to portion rice for reheating later in your air fryer.</p>  

<h3>How to measure 2 cups of cooked rice accurately</h3>  
<p>Use a kitchen scale for the most precise measurement—simply weigh out 16 ounces of cooked rice. If you don’t have a scale, fluff the rice with a fork before lightly spooning it into a measuring cup. Avoid packing it down, as this can lead to uneven portions. For air fryer recipes like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable stir-fries</a>, properly measured rice ensures the dish cooks evenly.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for 2 cups of cooked rice in air fryer cooking</h2>

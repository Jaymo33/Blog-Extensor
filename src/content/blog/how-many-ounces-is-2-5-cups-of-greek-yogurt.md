<h3>How to measure greek yogurt correctly</h3>  
<p>To measure 2.5 cups of greek yogurt accurately, use a liquid measuring cup for consistency. Scoop the yogurt without packing it down, then level it off with a straight edge. For ounces, a kitchen scale is ideal—simply tare the scale and weigh until you hit 20 ounces. This method works for all air fryer recipes, from creamy dips to protein-packed snacks.

It’s perfect for marinating chicken, making tangy sauces, or even as a substitute for heavier creams. When converting 2.5 cups to ounces, remember that 20 ounces will give you the right balance for most recipes.

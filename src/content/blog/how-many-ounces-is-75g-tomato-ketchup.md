<h2>Why Convert 75g of Tomato Ketchup to Ounces?</h2>  
<p>Many UK recipes, especially those for air fryers, list ingredients in grams, while some kitchen scales default to ounces. Converting 75g of tomato ketchup to ounces (2.65 oz) helps avoid guesswork. This is particularly useful for sticky ingredients like ketchup, where precision matters. If you're preparing a batch of <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>air fryer chicken recipes</a>, accurate measurements ensure the marinade isn’t too thick or runny.</p>

<h3>How to Measure 75g of Tomato Ketchup</h3>  
<p>If your scales don’t display ounces, use a tablespoon to measure roughly 5 tablespoons (since 1 tbsp of ketchup weighs about 15g). For sticky sauces, lightly grease the spoon for easier pouring. Alternatively, use a digital scale set to grams for precision. This method works well for <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>air fryer vegetable dishes</a> that call for a glaze or dip.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for 75g of Tomato Ketchup in Air Fryers</h2>  
<p>Tomato ketchup isn’t just for burgers—it’s a versatile ingredient in air fryer cooking. A 75g portion (2.65 oz) is perfect for marinating chicken wings, glazing sausages, or adding tang to homemade <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a>. Its natural sweetness caramelises beautifully under high heat, creating a sticky, flavourful coating.</p>  

<p>You can also mix 75g of ketchup with spices or vinegar to create custom sauces. For example, blend it with smoked paprika for a BBQ-style dip or whisk with honey for a sweet-and-sour glaze.

<h3>Adjusting Recipes for Different Quantities</h3>  
<p>If a recipe calls for 150g of ketchup, simply double the 75g measurement to 5.3 ounces. For smaller amounts, halve it (37.5g = ~1.32 oz). This flexibility is ideal for batch cooking or scaling down portions. Remember, air fryers excel at crisping, so a light, even coating of sauce works best.</p>  

<h2>Tips for Storing Tomato Ketchup</h2>  
<p>Once opened, store ketchup in the fridge to maintain freshness. A 75g portion is roughly a quarter of a standard UK bottle (300g), so seal it tightly after use. For longer storage, freeze ketchup in ice cube trays—each cube holds about 15g, making future 75g measurements a breeze.</p>

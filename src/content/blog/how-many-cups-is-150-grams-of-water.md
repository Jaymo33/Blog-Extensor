<p>150 grams of water equals approximately 0.63 cups in the UK or 0.64 cups in the US. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise liquid measurements affect texture and cooking times. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we know accuracy makes the difference between soggy and crispy results.</p>

<h2>Why Convert 150 Grams of Water to Cups?</h2>
<p>Many air fryer recipes, especially batters and sauces, list water in grams rather than cups. If your kitchen scales are out of batteries, knowing that 150 grams of water is roughly ⅔ cup saves the day. This conversion works for everything from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>air fryer cakes</a> to marinades. Always use room-temperature water for consistent measurements, as cold water is denser.</p>
<p>The slight difference between UK (0.63) and US (0.64) cups comes from their official definitions. A UK cup holds 284ml, while a US cup is 240ml. For most <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a>, this 4ml gap won’t impact results. However, for delicate dishes like soufflés, sticking to one measurement system is best.</p>

<h3>Tools for Measuring 150g Water Without Scales</h3>
<p>No scales? Use a liquid measuring cup with metric markings – 150ml of water equals 150g by volume. For imperial cups, fill to just below the ⅔ line. A standard UK tablespoon holds 15g water, so 10 tablespoons also get you close to 150 grams.

<h2>How Air Fryer Cooking Affects Water Measurements</h2>
<p>Air fryers circulate hot air rapidly, causing faster evaporation than conventional ovens. When adapting recipes, you might need slightly less water than the original suggests. For example, 150 grams of water in a batter could thicken quicker in the air fryer. Start with 90% of the liquid and adjust as needed.</p>
<p>This evaporation effect is why many <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>air fryer chicken recipes</a> use marinades rather than added water. The concentrated flavours compensate for moisture loss. Always preheat your air fryer when working with water-based mixtures to ensure even cooking from the start.</p>

<h3>Common Recipes Using 150g Water</h3>
<p>This measurement appears in pancake batters, Yorkshire pudding mixes, and steam-baked items like crusty bread. When making <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/potatoes>air fryer roast potatoes</a>, a 150g water soak before cooking helps achieve fluffy interiors. For cleaning, mix 150g water with vinegar (about ½ cup each) for a natural <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner</a> solution.</p>

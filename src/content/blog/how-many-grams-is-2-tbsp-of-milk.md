<p>2 tablespoons (tbsp) of milk weigh approximately 30 grams. This measurement is essential for precise cooking, especially when using an air fryer where ingredient ratios can affect texture and cooking times. Whether you're whipping up a cake or a creamy sauce, knowing the exact conversion ensures consistency.

<h2>Why accurate milk measurements matter</h2>  
<p>Using the correct amount of milk in recipes ensures the right consistency and flavour. Too much milk can make batters runny, while too little may result in dry, crumbly textures. This is especially important for air fryer recipes, where even small deviations can affect cooking times. For example, a <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>cake recipe</a> requires precise liquid measurements to rise properly in the air fryer’s compact space.</p>  

<p>Milk density can vary slightly depending on fat content, but 2 tbsp of whole milk, semi-skimmed, or skimmed milk all hover around 30 grams. If you’re using plant-based alternatives like almond or oat milk, weights may differ slightly—always check the packaging for specifics.

<h3>How to measure milk without scales</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a kitchen scale, use standard measuring spoons for accuracy. A UK tablespoon holds 15ml of liquid, so 2 tbsp equal 30ml. Since milk’s density is close to water (1g/ml), this translates roughly to 30 grams. For thicker liquids like condensed milk, weights will differ—always refer to a reliable conversion guide.</p>  

<h2>Common milk conversions for air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Here’s a quick reference for other common milk measurements in grams:</p>  
<ul>  
<li>1 tbsp milk = 15 grams</li>  
<li>1/4 cup milk = 60 grams</li>  
<li>1/2 cup milk = 120 grams</li>  
</ul>  

<p>These conversions are handy for adapting recipes to your air fryer. For example, a <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/breakfast>breakfast recipe</a> might call for 1/2 cup of milk, which you can now measure precisely in grams.

<h3>Tips for measuring sticky liquids</h3>  
<p>When measuring syrups or condensed milk, lightly grease your spoon to help the liquid slide off easily. This ensures you get the full 2 tbsp without residue left behind. For best results, level off the spoon with a straight edge for accuracy.</p>

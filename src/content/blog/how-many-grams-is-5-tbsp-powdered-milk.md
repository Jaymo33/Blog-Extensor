<p>5 tablespoons of powdered milk equals approximately 35 grams. This conversion is essential for precise baking or cooking, especially when using an air fryer. Whether you're whipping up a cake or a creamy sauce, knowing the exact weight ensures consistency.

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter</h2>  
<p>Using the correct amount of powdered milk can make or break a recipe. Too much can make dishes overly dense, while too little might leave them lacking flavour. Air fryer recipes, in particular, rely on precise measurements for even cooking. If you're new to air frying, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for other handy measurements. Powdered milk is a staple in many kitchens, so getting the grams right saves time and hassle.</p>  

<p>Powdered milk is often used in baking, sauces, and even homemade bread. Measuring by weight (grams) is more accurate than volume (tablespoons) because density can vary. For example, sifted powdered milk will weigh less per tablespoon than compacted powder. If you're prepping meals in advance, accurate measurements ensure every portion tastes just right. Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert recipes</a> for inspiration on using powdered milk.</p>  

<h3>How to measure powdered milk correctly</h3>  
<p>For the most accurate results, use a digital kitchen scale. Spoon the powdered milk into the tablespoon without packing it down, then level it off with a knife. This method prevents over-measuring and ensures consistency. If you don’t have a scale, remember that 1 tablespoon of powdered milk is roughly 7 grams, so 5 tbsp equals about 35 grams. Keep your air fryer in top condition with our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning guide</a> to avoid cross-contamination.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for powdered milk in air fryer recipes</h2>  
<p>Powdered milk is a versatile ingredient that works well in air fryer recipes. It’s often used in breading mixtures for crispy chicken or fish, adding a subtle creaminess. You can also mix it into batters for cakes or muffins, giving them a richer texture. For savoury dishes, try adding it to mashed potatoes or soups for extra depth. Visit <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> for more creative ways to use powdered milk.</p>  

<p>Another great use is in homemade seasoning blends. Combine powdered milk with herbs and spices for a flavourful coating on meats or veggies. It’s also handy for making instant sauces or gravies in a pinch. Whether you're cooking for one or meal prepping, powdered milk is a pantry must-have. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/breakfast>breakfast recipes</a> for ideas on incorporating it into morning meals.</p>  

<h3>Tips for storing powdered milk</h3>  
<p>To keep powdered milk fresh, store it in an airtight container in a cool, dry place. Exposure to moisture can cause clumping, which affects measurement accuracy. If you use it infrequently, consider labelling the container with the conversion (e.g., "1 tbsp = 7g") for quick reference. Proper storage ensures your powdered milk stays usable for months, ready for your next air fryer adventure.</p>

<p>260 ml of coconut milk is approximately 1.1 cups in the UK or 1.09 cups in the US. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements matter. Whether you're making a creamy curry or a dairy-free dessert, knowing how to convert millilitres to cups ensures your dish turns out perfectly every time.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Coconut Milk Measurements Matter</h2>
<p>Getting the right amount of coconut milk can make or break your recipe. Too much can make dishes overly rich, while too little might leave them dry. For air fryer cooking, where evaporation happens faster, precise measurements are even more critical. That's why understanding how many cups is 260 ml of coconut milk helps you nail recipes from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>.</p>
<p>Most UK recipes use millilitres, while American ones often prefer cups. This guide bridges that gap, especially useful if you're trying international dishes. Whether you're making Thai curries or vegan cakes, converting 260ml coconut milk to cups becomes second nature with practice.</p>

<h2>UK vs US Cup Measurements for Coconut Milk</h2>
<p>Did you know a UK cup holds 284 ml, while a US cup is 240 ml? That slight difference affects how you measure 260 ml of coconut milk in cups. In the UK, 260 ml equals about 0.92 cups, whereas in the US it's roughly 1.09 cups. For most recipes, this small variance won't ruin your dish, but it's good to be aware.</p>
<p>When following air fryer recipes from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert category</a>, check whether they use UK or US measurements. If unsure, the 1.1 cup approximation works well for both. Remember, coconut milk's thickness means it's best measured in liquid measuring cups for accuracy.</p>

<h3>How to Measure 260 ml Without a Measuring Cup</h3>
<p>No measuring cup? No problem. A standard UK tablespoon holds 15 ml, so 260 ml is about 17 tablespoons plus 1 teaspoon. For US measurements, it's roughly 17.3 tablespoons. While not as precise as cups, this method works in a pinch for recipes like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> favourites.</p>

<h2>Converting Coconut Milk for Different Recipes</h2>
<p>Whether you're making savoury or sweet dishes, 260 ml of coconut milk converts differently based on recipe type. For curries and soups, the exact 1.1 cup measure works best. But for baked goods where precision matters, weighing might be better - 260 ml of coconut milk weighs about 255 grams.</p>
<p>When preparing <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>air fryer cakes</a>, consider that coconut milk's fat content varies by brand. Light coconut milk is more watery than full-fat, potentially affecting measurements. Always shake the can well before measuring your 260 ml to ensure consistency throughout your recipe.</p>

<h3>Common Mistakes When Measuring Coconut Milk</h3>
<p>Many cooks accidentally use dry measuring cups for liquids like coconut milk, leading to inaccurate 260 ml to cups conversions. Always use liquid measures with spouts for proper readings at eye level. Another pitfall is not accounting for the cream that separates in canned coconut milk - stir thoroughly before measuring your 260 ml portion.</p>

<h2>Air Fryer Recipes Using 260 ml Coconut Milk</h2>
<p>Your 260 ml (1.1 cups) of coconut milk works beautifully in air fryer recipes. Try it in dairy-free mac 'n' cheese or as a base for vegan curries. The high-fat content helps create crispy textures while keeping food moist - perfect for <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>easy air fryer cleaning</a> afterwards since it doesn't burn as easily as dairy.</p>
<p>For breakfast, use your converted 260 ml coconut milk in French toast batter or overnight oats. The subtle sweetness enhances flavours without overpowering. Remember that coconut milk browns faster than dairy, so reduce air fryer temperatures by about 10°C when substituting in recipes calling for regular milk.</p>

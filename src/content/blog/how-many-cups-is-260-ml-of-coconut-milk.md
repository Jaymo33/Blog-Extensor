<h2>UK vs US Cup Measurements for Coconut Milk</h2>
<p>Did you know a UK cup holds 284 ml, while a US cup is 240 ml? That slight difference affects how you measure 260 ml of coconut milk in cups. In the UK, 260 ml equals about 0.92 cups, whereas in the US it's roughly 1.09 cups. For most recipes, this small variance won't ruin your dish, but it's good to be aware.</p>
<p>When following air fryer recipes from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert category</a>, check whether they use UK or US measurements. If unsure, the 1.1 cup approximation works well for both. Remember, coconut milk's thickness means it's best measured in liquid measuring cups for accuracy.</p>

<h3>How to Measure 260 ml Without a Measuring Cup</h3>
<p>No measuring cup? No problem. A standard UK tablespoon holds 15 ml, so 260 ml is about 17 tablespoons plus 1 teaspoon. For US measurements, it's roughly 17.3 tablespoons.

<h2>Converting Coconut Milk for Different Recipes</h2>
<p>Whether you're making savoury or sweet dishes, 260 ml of coconut milk converts differently based on recipe type. For curries and soups, the exact 1.1 cup measure works best. But for baked goods where precision matters, weighing might be better - 260 ml of coconut milk weighs about 255 grams.</p>
<p>When preparing <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>air fryer cakes</a>, consider that coconut milk's fat content varies by brand. Light coconut milk is more watery than full-fat, potentially affecting measurements. Always shake the can well before measuring your 260 ml to ensure consistency throughout your recipe.</p>

<h3>Common Mistakes When Measuring Coconut Milk</h3>
<p>Many cooks accidentally use dry measuring cups for liquids like coconut milk, leading to inaccurate 260 ml to cups conversions. Always use liquid measures with spouts for proper readings at eye level. Another pitfall is not accounting for the cream that separates in canned coconut milk - stir thoroughly before measuring your 260 ml portion.</p>

<h2>Air Fryer Recipes Using 260 ml Coconut Milk</h2>

<p>For breakfast, use your converted 260 ml coconut milk in French toast batter or overnight oats. The subtle sweetness enhances flavours without overpowering. Remember that coconut milk browns faster than dairy, so reduce air fryer temperatures by about 10Â°C when substituting in recipes calling for regular milk.</p>

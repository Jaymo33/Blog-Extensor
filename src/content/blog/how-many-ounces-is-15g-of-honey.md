<p>15g of honey is approximately 0.53 ounces. This conversion is handy for air fryer recipes where precise measurements matter. Whether you're glazing chicken or sweetening desserts, knowing the exact weight ensures perfect results every time.</p>

<h2>Why Convert 15g of Honey to Ounces?</h2>
<p>Many UK recipes use grams, but some air fryer guides or international recipes might list ingredients in ounces. Converting 15g of honey to ounces (0.53 oz) helps you follow recipes accurately. This is especially useful for sticky ingredients like honey, where slight variations can affect texture and taste.</p>
<p>At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we recommend using a digital scale for honey. Its thick consistency makes volume measurements like tablespoons unreliable. A scale ensures consistency, whether you're making honey-glazed salmon or baking cakes.</p>

<h2>How to Measure 15g of Honey Accurately</h2>
<p>For 15g of honey (0.53 oz), a digital kitchen scale is your best friend. Place your container on the scale, tare it to zero, then drizzle honey until you hit 15g. If you don’t have a scale, use the spoon-and-level method: 1 tablespoon of honey weighs about 21g, so 15g is roughly ¾ tablespoon.</p>
<p>Remember, honey’s viscosity varies with temperature. Cold honey is thicker and harder to pour, while warm honey flows easily. For consistent results in air fryer recipes like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>honey-glazed chicken</a>, measure honey at room temperature.</p>

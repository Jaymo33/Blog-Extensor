<p>425 grams of brown sugar is roughly equivalent to 2 cups when lightly packed, though this can vary slightly depending on how tightly you pack the sugar. If you're using an air fryer to bake desserts like cookies or cakes, getting the measurement right is crucial for perfect results. Brown sugar tends to clump, so fluffing it before measuring ensures accuracy.

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Baking</h2>  
<p>When using an air fryer, precise measurements ensure even cooking and the right texture. Too much sugar can make desserts overly sweet or cause uneven browning. Brown sugar, in particular, adds moisture, so getting the 425 grams to cups conversion right affects the final product. Whether you're making sticky toffee pudding or chocolate chip cookies, accuracy is key.

<p>Air fryers cook faster than conventional ovens, so ingredient ratios matter even more. A slight variation in the 425 grams of brown sugar to cups measurement can impact caramelisation and texture. Always use a kitchen scale for the most precise results, especially when adapting traditional recipes for air frying.

<h3>UK vs. US Cup Measurements</h3>  
<p>In the UK, a standard cup holds 250ml, while in the US, it's 240ml. This small difference means 425 grams of brown sugar may fill slightly more than 2 cups in the UK. For air fryer recipes, stick to one measurement system to avoid inconsistencies. If your recipe is American, use US cups for the 425g brown sugar to cups conversion.</p>  

<h2>Tips for Measuring Brown Sugar Perfectly</h2>  
<p>To measure 425 grams of brown sugar accurately, fluff it with a fork to break up clumps before spooning it into a measuring cup. Avoid packing it down unless the recipe specifies "firmly packed." Lightly packed brown sugar ensures the 425 grams to cups ratio stays consistent. For sticky recipes like air fryer brownies, this step is essential.</p>  

<p>If you donâ€™t have a scale, use the spoon-and-level method: spoon the sugar into the cup and level it off with a knife. This prevents over-measuring, which can throw off air fryer baking times.

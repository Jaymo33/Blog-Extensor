<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>

<p>Many UK recipes use grams, while some older cookbooks or international recipes might use ounces. Being able to convert between these units is particularly useful when preparing garlic-heavy dishes like roasted vegetables or garlic bread in your air fryer. The good news is that once you know the basic conversion, it's easy to adjust quantities as needed.</p>

<h3>How to measure minced garlic accurately</h3>
<p>When measuring 150g of minced garlic (or 5.29 ounces), it's best to use digital kitchen scales for precision. If you don't have scales, remember that one level tablespoon of minced garlic weighs about 10g, so 150g would be roughly 15 tablespoons. However, scales are far more accurate, especially for air fryer recipes where consistency is key.</p>

<h3>Storing leftover minced garlic</h3>

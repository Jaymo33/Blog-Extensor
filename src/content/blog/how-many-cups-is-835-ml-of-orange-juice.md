<p>835 ml of orange juice is approximately 3.5 cups in the UK and 3.52 cups in the US. Knowing this conversion is essential for air fryer recipes, where precise measurements can affect texture and flavour. Whether you're making a glaze, marinade, or baking a cake, getting the liquid quantities right ensures consistent results.</p>  

<h2>Understanding the Conversion</h2>  
<p>Converting millilitres to cups depends on the measurement system you're using. In the UK, 1 cup equals 250 ml, while in the US, it's roughly 237 ml. For 835 ml of orange juice, this means 3.5 cups in the UK and slightly more in the US. This distinction matters when following recipes from different regions, especially for air fryer dishes where liquid ratios impact cooking times.</p>  

<p>If you're using an air fryer, precise measurements help avoid soggy or dry results. For example, a marinade with too much liquid won’t crisp properly, while too little might leave food dry.

<h3>Why Accuracy Matters in Air Fryer Cooking</h3>  
<p>Air fryers rely on rapid hot air circulation, so ingredient ratios are crucial. Too much liquid can steam food instead of crisping it, while too little may cause uneven cooking. Measuring 835 ml of orange juice correctly ensures your recipes, like glazed chicken or citrus cakes, turn out perfectly every time.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for 835 ml of Orange Juice</h2>  
<p>Orange juice is versatile in air fryer cooking. It works well in marinades for chicken or pork, adding tangy sweetness and tenderising meat. You can also use it in baking—think orange-infused cakes or muffins. For inspiration, browse our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> collection.</p>  

<p>Another great use is in glazes. A reduction of 835 ml of orange juice with honey or spices creates a sticky, flavourful coating for roasted vegetables or salmon. Just remember to measure carefully to avoid overpowering other ingredients.</p>  

<h3>Adjusting Recipes for Different Cup Sizes</h3>  
<p>If a recipe calls for 835 ml of orange juice but uses US cups, you’ll need 3.52 cups instead of 3.5. This small difference might not matter for soups but can affect baked goods. Always double-check the origin of the recipe and adjust accordingly.</p>  

<h2>Tips for Measuring Liquids in an Air Fryer</h2>  
<p>Use a clear measuring jug for accuracy when pouring 835 ml of orange juice. For sticky liquids like juice, lightly grease the cup first to ensure all the liquid pours out. If you’re scaling a recipe up or down, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a> simplifies the maths.</p>  

<p>After cooking, clean your air fryer promptly to avoid sticky residue. A mix of 835 ml water and a splash of vinegar works wonders—see our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning guide</a> for more tips.

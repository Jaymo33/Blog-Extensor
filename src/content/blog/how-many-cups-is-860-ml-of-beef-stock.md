<p>860 ml of beef stock equals approximately 3.63 US cups or 3.03 UK cups. Whether you're making a rich gravy, a hearty stew, or a flavourful sauce in your air fryer, getting the liquid measurements right is crucial. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we know precision matters, especially when adapting recipes for smaller or larger batches. This guide will help you convert 860 ml of beef stock to cups accurately, whether you're using US or UK measurements.</p>  

<h2>Understanding Cup Measurements for Beef Stock</h2>  
<p>When converting 860 ml of beef stock to cups, the first thing to note is the difference between US and UK cup sizes. A US cup holds 240 ml, while a UK cup is slightly larger at 284 ml.

If you're using an air fryer for recipes like stews or braised dishes, knowing these conversions ensures your dish turns out perfectly every time.</p>

<h3>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h3>

In US cups, this is about 3 and 2/3 cups, while in UK cups, it's just over 3 cups. If your recipe requires precise amounts, consider using a measuring jug with both metric and imperial markings for accuracy.</p>

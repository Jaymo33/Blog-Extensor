<p>685 ml of evaporated milk is approximately 2.9 cups. This conversion is essential for recipes requiring precise measurements, especially when using an air fryer for baking or cooking. Whether you're making a creamy dessert or a savoury dish, knowing how to convert millilitres to cups ensures consistent results every time.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurement Matters</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of evaporated milk can make or break a recipe. Too little, and your dish might lack creaminess; too much, and it could become overly dense. For air fryer recipes, precise measurements are even more critical due to the appliance's rapid cooking process. A slight variation can affect texture and cooking time.</p>  
<p>At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we emphasise the importance of accurate conversions. Whether you're preparing a cake or a savoury casserole, knowing that 685 ml of evaporated milk equals roughly 2.9 cups helps you follow recipes with confidence. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more handy tips.</p>  

<h2>How to Measure 685 ml of Evaporated Milk</h2>  
<p>If you don't have a measuring jug with millilitre markings, you can still measure evaporated milk accurately. Use a standard US cup, which holds 240 ml, or a UK metric cup, which holds 250 ml. For 685 ml, you'll need just under 3 cups (2.9 cups to be exact).</p>  
<p>For best results, pour the evaporated milk into a liquid measuring cup placed on a flat surface. Bend down to check the measurement at eye level to avoid over- or under-pouring. This method ensures precision, whether you're baking or using your air fryer for recipes like custards or creamy pasta dishes.</p>  

<h3>US vs. UK Cup Measurements</h3>  
<p>It's worth noting that US and UK cup measurements differ slightly. A US cup is 240 ml, while a UK metric cup is 250 ml. For 685 ml of evaporated milk, this means 2.85 US cups or 2.74 UK cups. Most recipes on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> use metric measurements, so always double-check the origin of your recipe.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for 685 ml of Evaporated Milk</h2>  
<p>Evaporated milk is a staple in many recipes, from desserts to main dishes. Its rich, creamy texture makes it ideal for air fryer baking, such as in cakes, flans, or even creamy sauces. Knowing that 685 ml equals roughly 2.9 cups helps you scale recipes up or down with ease.</p>  
<p>For example, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> often call for evaporated milk in dishes like mac and cheese or bread pudding. With this conversion, you can confidently adjust quantities without compromising on taste or texture. Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert category</a> for inspiration.</p>  

<h3>Substitutes for Evaporated Milk</h3>  
<p>If you're out of evaporated milk, you can substitute it with a mixture of whole milk and butter. For 685 ml (2.9 cups), combine 2 cups of whole milk with ½ cup of melted butter. While not identical, this substitute works well in most recipes, including those for your air fryer.</p>  

<h2>Cleaning Tips After Using Evaporated Milk</h2>  
<p>Evaporated milk can leave sticky residues in your air fryer basket or measuring tools. To clean effectively, soak utensils in warm, soapy water before scrubbing. For your air fryer, use our recommended <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner</a> to remove stubborn stains without damaging non-stick surfaces.</p>  
<p>Proper maintenance ensures your air fryer stays in top condition, ready for your next culinary adventure. Whether you're measuring 685 ml of evaporated milk or experimenting with new recipes, keeping your equipment clean is key to delicious results.</p>

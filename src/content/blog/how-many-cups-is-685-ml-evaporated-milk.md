<p>685 ml of evaporated milk is approximately 2.9 cups. This conversion is essential for recipes requiring precise measurements, especially when using an air fryer for baking or cooking. Whether you're making a creamy dessert or a savoury dish, knowing how to convert millilitres to cups ensures consistent results every time.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurement Matters</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of evaporated milk can make or break a recipe. Too little, and your dish might lack creaminess; too much, and it could become overly dense. For air fryer recipes, precise measurements are even more critical due to the appliance's rapid cooking process. A slight variation can affect texture and cooking time.</p>

<h2>How to Measure 685 ml of Evaporated Milk</h2>  
<p>If you don't have a measuring jug with millilitre markings, you can still measure evaporated milk accurately. Use a standard US cup, which holds 240 ml, or a UK metric cup, which holds 250 ml. For 685 ml, you'll need just under 3 cups (2.9 cups to be exact).</p>  
<p>For best results, pour the evaporated milk into a liquid measuring cup placed on a flat surface. Bend down to check the measurement at eye level to avoid over- or under-pouring. This method ensures precision, whether you're baking or using your air fryer for recipes like custards or creamy pasta dishes.</p>  

<h3>US vs. UK Cup Measurements</h3>  
<p>It's worth noting that US and UK cup measurements differ slightly. A US cup is 240 ml, while a UK metric cup is 250 ml. For 685 ml of evaporated milk, this means 2.85 US cups or 2.74 UK cups. Most recipes on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> use metric measurements, so always double-check the origin of your recipe.</p>

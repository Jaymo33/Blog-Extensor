<h2>Why accurate rice measurements matter in air fryers</h2>
<p>Air fryers rely on even heat distribution, so incorrect rice quantities can lead to uneven cooking. Too much rice may result in clumping, while too little can dry out quickly. Measuring 5 tbsp of rice in grams ensures consistency, especially for recipes like crispy rice cakes or air-fried rice balls.

<p>Different rice types have slightly varying weights. For example, 5 tbsp of basmati rice weighs around 60g, while short-grain rice might be closer to 65g. Always check your specific rice variety for the most accurate conversion. This precision is crucial when adapting stovetop recipes for your air fryer.</p>

<h2>How to measure 5 tbsp of rice correctly</h2>
<p>Use a standard UK tablespoon (15ml) and level off the rice with a straight edge for accuracy. Scooping directly from the bag can compress the rice, leading to inconsistent measurements. For best results, fluff the rice first with a fork before measuring. This method ensures your 5 tbsp rice to grams conversion is spot-on every time.</p>
<p>If you're converting larger quantities, remember that 1 UK tablespoon of rice equals about 12g. This makes scaling recipes up or down much simpler. For perfect rice dishes in your air fryer, maintaining these proportions is key to achieving that ideal texture.</p>

<h3>Common rice types and their 5 tbsp weights</h3>
<p>Basmati rice: 60g, Jasmine rice: 62g, Long-grain white rice: 58g, Brown rice: 65g. These slight variations matter when precision is needed for air fryer cooking. Always adjust cooking times accordingly - denser rice varieties may need an extra minute or two.</p>

<p>0.66 cup of self-raising flour equals approximately 3.17 ounces (oz). This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements can make or break your baking results. Whether you're whipping up cakes, muffins, or bread in your air fryer, knowing the exact weight ensures consistency.</p>

<h2>Why accurate flour measurements matter in air fryer baking</h2>
<p>Air fryers cook food faster and more evenly than conventional ovens, which means your ingredients need to be spot-on. Too much or too little flour can affect texture, rise, and browning. For perfect results every time, weighing your flour is more reliable than using cup measurements.</p>
<p>Self-raising flour contains baking powder, so incorrect measurements can lead to dense or overly risen bakes. If you're adapting recipes from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, converting cups to ounces ensures your air fryer creations turn out light and fluffy.</p>

<h2>How to measure 0.66 cup of self-raising flour</h2>
<p>For the most accurate measurement, use digital kitchen scales set to ounces. If you don't have scales, spoon the flour into your measuring cup and level it off with a knife - never pack it down. This method gives you the closest approximation to 3.17 ounces.</p>
<p>Remember that UK and US cup measurements differ slightly. Our conversion uses UK standard cups (250ml), which you'll find in most British recipes. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for other common ingredient conversions.</p>

<h3>Converting other flour amounts</h3>
<p>If your recipe calls for different quantities, here are some handy conversions: 1 cup of self-raising flour equals 4.8 ounces, while Â½ cup is 2.4 ounces. These measurements are particularly useful when scaling air fryer recipes up or down.</p>

<h2>Tips for baking with self-raising flour in air fryers</h2>
<p>Air fryers circulate hot air rapidly, which can dry out baked goods. To combat this, consider reducing cooking times by 20% compared to oven recipes. Always preheat your air fryer for even baking results.</p>
<p>For perfect air fryer cakes using your 3.17 ounces of flour, try lining your tin with parchment paper. Our guide to <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>keeping your air fryer clean</a> will help maintain its performance for all your baking adventures.</p>

<h3>Common air fryer baking mistakes to avoid</h3>
<p>Overfilling your air fryer basket restricts airflow, leading to uneven cooking. When baking with self-raising flour, ensure there's enough space for your mixture to rise properly. Check food a few minutes before the recommended time to prevent over-browning.</p>

<h2>Alternative measurement methods</h2>
<p>If you don't have measuring cups or scales, you can use tablespoons as a rough guide. 0.66 cup of self-raising flour equals about 10.5 tablespoons. However, for consistent results in air fryer baking, weighing ingredients is always best.</p>

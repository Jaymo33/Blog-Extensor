<h3>How to Measure Grated Cheese Correctly</h3>  
<p>For the most accurate conversion of 325 grams of grated cheese to cups, lightly spoon the cheese into a measuring cup without packing it down. Pressing it tightly can add up to half a cup extra, throwing off your recipe. If you’re using pre-shredded cheese, note that it’s often coated to prevent clumping, which can slightly alter volume.</p>

<h3>Storing leftover yeast after measuring 75g</h3>  
<p>Once you've measured out your 75g (2.65oz) of yeast, store any excess in an airtight container in the fridge (fresh yeast) or cool, dark cupboard (dry yeast). Proper storage maintains potency for future air fryer baking sessions. Always check yeast freshness before use – it should smell pleasantly earthy, not sour.</p>

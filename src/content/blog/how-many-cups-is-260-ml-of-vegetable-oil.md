<h2>Tips for Using Vegetable Oil in Your Air Fryer</h2>  
<p>When using 260 ml of vegetable oil in air fryer recipes, opt for oils with high smoke points, like sunflower or rapeseed oil. These handle high heat better, preventing burnt flavours. For lighter dishes, you can reduce the oil slightly—try 200 ml (about 0.85 cups) for a healthier twist.

<p>Another tip is to brush oil onto food rather than pouring it directly into the air fryer basket. This method ensures even coverage without excess oil pooling. For marinades or dressings, 260 ml of vegetable oil (1.1 cups) can be mixed with herbs and spices for extra flavour. Remember, a little oil goes a long way in an air fryer!</p>

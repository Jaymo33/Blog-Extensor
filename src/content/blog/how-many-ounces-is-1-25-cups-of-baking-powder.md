<p>1.25 cups of baking powder equals approximately 10 ounces. This conversion is essential for precise baking, especially when using an air fryer where measurements can make or break a recipe. Whether you're making fluffy cakes or crispy treats, knowing the exact weight ensures consistent results every time.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Baking</h2>  
<p>Baking powder is a leavening agent, and using the right amount is crucial for achieving the perfect rise in your air fryer recipes. Too little, and your baked goods will be dense; too much, and they might collapse. Converting 1.25 cups of baking powder to ounces (10 oz) helps avoid these pitfalls. For more tips on air fryer baking, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipes section</a>.</p>  

<p>Air fryers cook food faster than conventional ovens, so precision is key. A slight miscalculation in baking powder can lead to uneven textures or off flavours. If you're new to air fryer baking, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a> can help you adjust traditional recipes effortlessly.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure Baking Powder Correctly</h3>  
<p>To measure 1.25 cups of baking powder accurately, use a dry measuring cup and level it off with a straight edge. Scooping directly from the container can compact the powder, leading to an incorrect measurement. For best results, weigh it on a kitchen scale—10 ounces is the ideal weight for 1.25 cups.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for 1.25 Cups of Baking Powder</h2>  
<p>This quantity is often used in larger batches of air fryer cakes, muffins, or even savoury dishes like tempura batter. If you're experimenting with recipes, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>cake category</a> offers plenty of inspiration. Remember, accurate conversions ensure your creations turn out light and fluffy.</p>  

<p>Baking powder isn't just for sweets—it’s also great for crispy air fryer coatings. Whether you're making fried chicken or onion rings, the right amount ensures a perfect crunch.

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>
<p>Air fryers rely on even heat distribution, so ingredient ratios must be spot-on. Too much garlic paste can overpower a dish, while too little might leave it bland. Measuring by weight (grams) is more reliable than volume (tablespoons) because it accounts for density variations. This is especially true for pastes, which can settle or vary in texture. For perfectly balanced flavours, always weigh your garlic paste when possible.</p>
<p>If you're new to air fryer cooking, browse our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a> for inspiration. Many dishes, from garlic butter shrimp to roasted vegetables, benefit from precise garlic paste measurements. Consistent results start with accurate conversions like 4 tbsp garlic paste to grams.</p>

<h2>How to measure 4 tbsp of garlic paste correctly</h2>
<p>To measure 4 tablespoons of garlic paste, use a standard UK tablespoon (15ml per tbsp). Level off each spoonful with a straight edge for accuracy. If your recipe calls for grams, a kitchen scale is your best friend. Simply tare your bowl, then add garlic paste until it reads 60g. This method eliminates guesswork and ensures your <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>garlic chicken recipes</a> turn out perfectly every time.</p>

<h3>Common mistakes when converting tbsp to grams</h3>
<p>Many cooks pack garlic paste into the tablespoon, which increases the weight beyond 60g. Others use heaped spoonfuls, leading to inconsistent results. Always measure level tablespoons unless specified otherwise. Also, note that different brands of garlic paste may vary slightly in density. When in doubt, weigh it out for precision.</p>

<h2>Garlic paste conversions for other quantities</h2>
<p>Need more or less than 4 tbsp? Here's a quick reference: 1 tbsp garlic paste = 15g, 2 tbsp = 30g, and 3 tbsp = 45g. These conversions work for most UK garlic paste brands. For larger batches, remember that 8 tbsp (½ cup) equals about 120g.

<p>These measurements are particularly useful when preparing <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>garlic-roasted vegetables</a> in your air fryer. The right amount of garlic paste ensures flavour without overwhelming the natural taste of your veggies.</p>

<h3>Storing leftover garlic paste</h3>
<p>After measuring your 4 tbsp (60g), store any remaining garlic paste in an airtight container in the fridge. It typically keeps for 2-3 weeks. For longer storage, freeze portions in ice cube trays—each cube holds about 1 tbsp (15g). This makes future measurements a breeze and reduces waste. Always label containers with dates and weights for easy reference.</p>

<h2>Adjusting air fryer recipes with garlic paste</h2>
<p>When adapting conventional oven recipes for your air fryer, garlic paste quantities may need tweaking. Air fryers intensify flavours, so you might use slightly less than the original recipe suggests. Start with ¾ of the amount (about 45g for 4 tbsp) and adjust to taste. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> team recommends tasting as you go when working with potent ingredients like garlic paste.</p>

Measuring 1000g accurately in ounces (35.27 oz) ensures your treats turn out just right. If you’re scaling a recipe up or down, this conversion helps maintain balance, especially when adapting traditional oven recipes for the air fryer.</p>  

<h3>How to measure 1000g of granulated sugar without scales</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a kitchen scale, you can use volume measurements to approximate 1000g of granulated sugar. One cup of granulated sugar weighs roughly 200g, so 1000g would be about 5 cups.

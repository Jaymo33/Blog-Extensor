<p>2.75 cups of half and half equals approximately 650.62 millilitres (ml). This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes, ensuring precise measurements for creamy sauces, desserts, or baked goods.

At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we simplify kitchen conversions so you can focus on cooking.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>

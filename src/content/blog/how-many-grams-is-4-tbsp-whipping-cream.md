<p>4 tablespoons (tbsp) of whipping cream equals approximately 60 grams (g) in UK measurements. This conversion is essential for precise baking, cooking, and air fryer recipes where accuracy matters. Whether you're whipping up desserts or creamy sauces, knowing the exact weight ensures consistency in your dishes.</p>  

<h2>Why converting tablespoons to grams matters</h2>  
<p>Measuring ingredients by weight rather than volume is far more accurate, especially in baking. A tablespoon of whipping cream can vary slightly in volume due to factors like temperature and how it's scooped. By converting 4 tbsp of whipping cream to grams, you eliminate guesswork and achieve perfect results every time. This is particularly useful for air fryer recipes, where precise measurements can affect cooking times and textures.</p>  

<p>If you're using an air fryer for desserts like mousses or custards, knowing that 4 tbsp of whipping cream is 60 grams helps maintain the right consistency. For more air fryer measurement tips, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>  

<h3>How to measure whipping cream accurately</h3>  
<p>To measure 4 tbsp of whipping cream correctly, use a standard UK tablespoon (15ml per tbsp). For grams, a digital kitchen scale is ideal. Simply place your mixing bowl on the scale, tare it to zero, then pour the cream until it reaches 60 grams. This method is foolproof and ensures no discrepancies in your recipes.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for 4 tbsp of whipping cream</h2>  
<p>Four tablespoons of whipping cream (or 60 grams) is a versatile quantity in both cooking and baking. It's enough to enrich soups, create silky pasta sauces, or whip into soft peaks for desserts. In air fryer cooking, this amount is perfect for recipes like creamy garlic mushrooms or indulgent chocolate fondants.</p>  

<p>For inspiration, browse our collection of <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> that use whipping cream. From savoury to sweet, precise measurements help these dishes turn out perfectly every time.</p>  

<h3>Converting other whipping cream quantities</h3>  
<p>If your recipe calls for more or less whipping cream, here's a quick reference: 1 tbsp = 15g, 2 tbsp = 30g, 3 tbsp = 45g, and 5 tbsp = 75g. These conversions work for UK standard tablespoons and most whipping cream varieties. Always check your specific cream's density if it's an extra-thick variety.</p>  

<h2>Tips for working with whipping cream in air fryers</h2>  
<p>When using whipping cream in air fryer recipes, remember that the circulating hot air can cause dairy to separate if overheated. For best results, add cream-based sauces towards the end of cooking or use them as toppings. This prevents curdling and maintains that luxurious texture we all love.</p>  

<p>Proper cleaning is also crucial after cooking with dairy.

<h3>UK vs. US Cup Measurements</h3>  
<p>While 1.0 UK cup is technically 284 ml, most modern recipes—including those on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipes</a>—use the US standard (240 ml) for simplicity. Always check the recipe origin if precision is critical. For baking, stick to weight measurements (grams) when possible.</p>  

<h2>Converting Other Chicken Broth Quantities</h2>  
<p>Need to scale up or down? Here’s a quick reference for common conversions: ½ cup = 120 ml, 2 cups = 480 ml, and 4 cups (1 quart) = 960 ml. These ratios work for both store-bought and homemade broth. For meal prep ideas, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/meal-prep>meal prep section</a>.</p>  

<p>Remember, reducing broth (simmering to concentrate flavour) will decrease the ml volume. Adjust seasonings accordingly. If you’re reheating leftovers in the air fryer, 240 ml of broth helps retain moisture without overcooking.

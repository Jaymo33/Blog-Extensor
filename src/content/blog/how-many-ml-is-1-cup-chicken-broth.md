<p>1.0 cup of chicken broth equals 240 millilitres (ml). This standard conversion works for both UK and US measurements, making it easy to follow recipes without confusion. Whether you're using an air fryer or a traditional oven, knowing this conversion ensures your dishes turn out perfectly every time. For more air fryer conversions, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Precision is key when cooking with an air fryer, as the compact space requires balanced liquid ratios. Too much or too little chicken broth can affect texture and cooking time. For example, adding 240 ml (1.0 cup) of broth to a casserole ensures even heat distribution. If you're exploring new dishes, browse our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> for inspiration. Always measure liquids at eye level for accuracy.</p>  

<p>Chicken broth adds moisture and flavour to air-fried dishes like soups, stews, and marinades. Using the correct ml measurement prevents soggy or dry results. A digital scale or liquid measuring jug can help verify 240 ml if you're unsure. For more tips on perfecting air fryer meals, visit <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>.</p>  

<h3>UK vs. US Cup Measurements</h3>  
<p>While 1.0 UK cup is technically 284 ml, most modern recipes—including those on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipes</a>—use the US standard (240 ml) for simplicity. Always check the recipe origin if precision is critical. For baking, stick to weight measurements (grams) when possible.</p>  

<h2>Converting Other Chicken Broth Quantities</h2>  
<p>Need to scale up or down? Here’s a quick reference for common conversions: ½ cup = 120 ml, 2 cups = 480 ml, and 4 cups (1 quart) = 960 ml. These ratios work for both store-bought and homemade broth. For meal prep ideas, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/meal-prep>meal prep section</a>.</p>  

<p>Remember, reducing broth (simmering to concentrate flavour) will decrease the ml volume. Adjust seasonings accordingly. If you’re reheating leftovers in the air fryer, 240 ml of broth helps retain moisture without overcooking. Keep your appliance in top shape with our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning guide</a>.</p>  

<h3>Tips for Measuring Sticky or Thick Broths</h3>  
<p>For gelatinous or reduced broths, lightly grease the measuring cup first to ensure all 240 ml slides out easily. Warm the cup slightly if the broth has solidified. This trick is especially useful for collagen-rich homemade stocks.</p>

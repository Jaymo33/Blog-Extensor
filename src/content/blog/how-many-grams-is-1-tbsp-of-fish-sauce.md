<p>1 tablespoon (tbsp) of fish sauce weighs approximately 15 grams. This conversion is essential for precise cooking, especially when using an air fryer, where measurements can make or break a dish. Whether you're whipping up a marinade or seasoning a stir-fry, knowing the exact weight ensures consistency. For more air fryer tips, check out <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on even cooking, and incorrect measurements can lead to uneven results. Fish sauce, with its strong flavour, needs precise dosing to avoid overpowering your dish. Too much can make your food overly salty, while too little might leave it bland. Using grams instead of volume measurements eliminates guesswork. Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more handy tips.</p>  

<p>Many air fryer recipes, especially Asian-inspired dishes, call for fish sauce. Whether you're making crispy chicken wings or a tangy dipping sauce, the right amount is key. A digital kitchen scale is a great tool for ensuring accuracy. For recipe ideas, visit our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipes section</a>.</p>  

<h3>How to measure fish sauce without a scale</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a scale, use a standard UK tablespoon (15ml) for fish sauce. Note that viscosity can slightly affect weight, but 15 grams is a reliable average. For sticky sauces like fish sauce, levelling off the spoon ensures consistency. Avoid heaping tablespoons, as this can throw off your measurements.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for fish sauce in air fryer recipes</h2>  
<p>Fish sauce adds depth to marinades, glazes, and dipping sauces. It’s a staple in dishes like Thai-style air-fried chicken or Vietnamese spring rolls. The umami flavour enhances meats, seafood, and even vegetables. For a flavour-packed meal, try our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipes</a> with a fish sauce twist.</p>  

<p>When using fish sauce in air fryer recipes, balance it with other ingredients like lime juice, sugar, or garlic. This prevents the dish from becoming too salty. A little goes a long way, so stick to the recommended 15 grams per tablespoon. For cleaning tips after cooking, see our guide on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner</a>.</p>  

<h3>Converting other fish sauce measurements</h3>  
<p>Need to convert teaspoons or cups? Here’s a quick reference: 1 teaspoon of fish sauce is roughly 5 grams, and 1 cup is about 240 grams. These conversions help when scaling recipes up or down. Always double-check measurements for the best results in your air fryer.</p>

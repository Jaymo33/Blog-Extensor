<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>When working with double cream, even small measurement discrepancies can affect the texture and taste of your dish. Too much cream can make sauces overly rich, while too little might leave them lacking. For air fryer recipes, precise measurements help achieve the perfect crispness or creaminess.

<h2>How to Measure 585 ml of Double Cream</h2>  
<p>Using a measuring jug is the easiest way to measure 585 ml of double cream. Look for metric markings on the side for accuracy. If you only have cups, remember that 1 cup equals roughly 237 ml, so 585 ml is just under 2.5 cups. For best results, use a kitchen scale alongside volume measurements.</p>  

<h3>Adjusting Recipes for Different Cream Types</h3>  
<p>If your recipe calls for double cream but you only have single or whipping cream, adjustments are needed. Double cream has a higher fat content (around 48%), so substitutions may alter the dish's richness. For air fryer recipes, thicker creams like double cream work best for coatings or fillings.</p>

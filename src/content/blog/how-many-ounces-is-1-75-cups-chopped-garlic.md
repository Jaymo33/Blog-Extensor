<p>1.75 cups of chopped garlic equals approximately 14 ounces (oz) in weight. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements ensure perfect flavour and texture. Whether you’re making garlic bread, roasted vegetables, or marinades, knowing the exact weight saves time and avoids waste. For more handy conversions, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>

<h2>Why accurate garlic measurements matter</h2>  
<p>Garlic is a powerhouse ingredient that can make or break a dish. Too little, and your meal lacks depth; too much, and it overpowers other flavours. In an air fryer, where cooking times are shorter, balanced measurements are even more critical. Chopped garlic spreads evenly, ensuring every bite is flavourful without burning. Visit <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>our recipe hub</a> for dishes that nail this balance.</p>  

<p>Air fryers excel at roasting garlic to sweet, caramelised perfection. But this only works if you use the right amount. A 14-oz portion of chopped garlic (1.75 cups) is ideal for family-sized portions. For smaller batches, halve the quantity and adjust cooking times slightly. Need inspiration? Try our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>garlic-roasted vegetable recipes</a>.</p>  

<h3>How to measure chopped garlic correctly</h3>  
<p>Use a dry measuring cup for chopped garlic, pressing lightly to remove air pockets without compacting it. For sticky minced garlic, lightly oil the cup first. This ensures 1.75 cups truly equals 14 oz. A kitchen scale removes all doubt—weigh once, and you’ll never second-guess again. Proper tools make all the difference, as seen in our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning guide</a> for sticky residues.</p>  

<h2>Converting cups to ounces for UK cooks</h2>  
<p>UK bakers often work in grams, but ounces remain common for smaller quantities. Since 1 cup of chopped garlic ≈ 8 oz, 1.75 cups is 14 oz. This matches US fluid ounces, simplifying transatlantic recipes. For metric users, 14 oz = 397 grams.

<p>Precision matters most with potent ingredients like garlic. Air fryers intensify flavours, so an extra 0.25 cup could dominate. Stick to 1.75 cups (14 oz) unless the recipe specifies otherwise. Our tested <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>garlic chicken dishes</a> use this ratio for consistent results. Happy cooking!</p>

Whether you’re following a British or American recipe, knowing the exact ml measurement ensures your dish turns out perfectly.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of liquid, like chicken broth, is crucial in air fryer recipes. Too much can make dishes soggy, while too little may dry them out. For example, when making a chicken casserole or gravy, 2.25 cups of chicken broth (532.5 ml) ensures the right consistency. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more handy tips.</p>  

<p>Air fryers cook food quickly, so precise measurements help avoid under or overcooking. If you’re adapting a traditional recipe for the air fryer, converting cups to ml is a must. This is especially useful for recipes like risottos or braised dishes where broth is key.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure 2.25 Cups of Chicken Broth Correctly</h3>  
<p>To measure 2.25 cups of chicken broth accurately, use a liquid measuring jug with ml markings. Fill it to the 532.5 ml line for perfect results.

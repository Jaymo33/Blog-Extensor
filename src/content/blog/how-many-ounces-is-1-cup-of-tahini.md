<p>1 cup of tahini equals approximately 8.5 ounces (240 grams) in UK measurements. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes, where precise measurements can make or break your dish. Whether you're whipping up hummus or a tahini-based dressing, knowing the exact weight ensures consistency.</p>

<h2>Why accurate tahini measurements matter</h2>
<p>Using the correct amount of tahini is crucial for achieving the right texture and flavour in your dishes. Too much can make your recipe overly thick or bitter, while too little might leave it lacking in richness. For air fryer recipes, especially those involving sauces or marinades, precision is key to avoid messes and ensure even cooking.</p>
<p>At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we've found that many successful tahini-based recipes rely on this 1 cup to 8.5 ounces conversion. This measurement works perfectly for everything from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken marinades</a> to vegetable dips prepared in your air fryer.</p>

<h3>Converting tahini measurements for UK cooks</h3>
<p>While US cups measure 8 fluid ounces, UK measurements can vary slightly. For tahini, which is denser than water, we recommend using weight measurements for accuracy. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> includes these details to help you adapt any recipe.</p>

<h2>Measuring tahini without scales</h2>
<p>If you don't have kitchen scales, you can still measure tahini accurately using the displacement method. Fill a measuring jug with 1 cup of water, then add tahini until the water level rises to 2 cups. This method accounts for tahini's thick consistency and gives you roughly 8.5 ounces.</p>
<p>For air fryer cooking, we recommend measuring tahini by weight whenever possible. This ensures your <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipes</a> turn out perfectly every time, whether you're making crispy tofu or roasted vegetables with tahini glaze.</p>

<h3>Tahini in popular air fryer recipes</h3>
<p>Many of our favourite air fryer dishes use tahini as a key ingredient. From salad dressings to marinades for <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>roasted vegetables</a>, knowing that 1 cup equals 8.5 ounces helps you adapt recipes with confidence.</p>

<h2>Storing and handling tahini</h2>
<p>Proper storage affects your tahini measurements too. Always stir well before measuring, as the oil separates naturally. Store opened tahini in the fridge and bring to room temperature before use for easiest measuring. Remember to clean your <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer</a> after cooking with tahini-based sauces to prevent residue buildup.</p>
<p>When working with tahini in air fryer recipes, its thickness means it's often best mixed with other liquids. The 1 cup to 8.5 ounces conversion becomes particularly useful when creating balanced marinades or sauces that won't clog your air fryer basket.</p>

<p>960 ml of oat milk is equivalent to approximately 4.06 cups. This conversion is essential for anyone using oat milk in recipes, especially when baking or cooking with an air fryer. Whether you're whipping up a cake or preparing a creamy sauce, knowing the exact measurement ensures perfect results every time.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter</h2>
<p>Using the right amount of oat milk can make or break your recipe. Too much or too little can affect texture, taste, and cooking time. For air fryer recipes, precision is even more critical because the cooking environment is compact and intense. A slight variation in liquid measurements can lead to undercooked or soggy results.</p>
<p>If you're new to air fryer cooking, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for other handy measurement conversions. It’s a lifesaver for adapting traditional recipes to your air fryer. Oat milk, in particular, is a popular dairy-free alternative, so knowing how to measure it correctly is a must.</p>

<h2>How to Measure 960 ml of Oat Milk</h2>
<p>Measuring 960 ml of oat milk is straightforward if you have the right tools. A liquid measuring cup with millilitre markings is ideal. Simply pour the oat milk up to the 960 ml line, and you're good to go. If you don’t have a measuring cup, a kitchen scale can also do the trick—oat milk weighs roughly 1 gram per millilitre.</p>
<p>For those who prefer using cups, remember that 1 cup equals 236.59 ml. This means 960 ml of oat milk is just over 4 cups. If your recipe calls for an exact measurement, it’s best to use a measuring jug for accuracy. You can find more tips on measuring ingredients for air fryer recipes on our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipes page</a>.</p>

<h3>Converting 960 ml of Oat Milk for Baking</h3>
<p>Baking with oat milk requires precise measurements to ensure your cakes, muffins, or breads turn out perfectly. Since 960 ml of oat milk is roughly 4 cups, you can easily adjust your recipe accordingly. If you're scaling a recipe up or down, this conversion will come in handy.</p>

<h3>Using 960 ml of Oat Milk in Savoury Dishes</h3>
<p>Oat milk isn’t just for baking—it’s great in savoury dishes too. Whether you're making a creamy pasta sauce or a hearty soup, 960 ml of oat milk (about 4 cups) can be the base for many delicious meals. For inspiration, browse our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable recipes</a> that pair well with oat milk.</p>

<h2>Common Mistakes When Measuring Oat Milk</h2>
<p>One of the biggest mistakes people make is using a dry measuring cup for liquids. Dry cups and liquid cups aren’t interchangeable, and using the wrong one can throw off your measurements. Always opt for a liquid measuring cup when working with oat milk or any other liquid ingredient.</p>
<p>Another common error is not checking the meniscus—the curve at the top of the liquid. For the most accurate measurement, read the measurement at eye level. This ensures you’re not over- or under-pouring.

<h2>Oat Milk vs. Other Milk Alternatives</h2>
<p>Oat milk has a slightly thicker consistency compared to almond or soy milk, which can affect measurements. If you’re substituting oat milk for another type of milk, keep in mind that 960 ml of oat milk will behave differently in recipes. Always adjust cooking times and temperatures accordingly, especially in an air fryer.</p>
<p>For those exploring dairy-free options, oat milk is a fantastic choice due to its creamy texture and mild flavour. Whether you’re making a dessert or a main dish, 960 ml of oat milk can be seamlessly incorporated.

However, many recipes and guides might state temperatures in Fahrenheit, an often confusing system for those used to Celsius. That's exactly the situation with 320 F, a common temperature listed for roasting or baking in air fryers. Converting 320 F to Celsius, which is 160 C, ensures that you can follow your recipes accurately. Whether you're preparing crispy vegetables or a juicy chicken dish, getting the temperature right is key.</p><p id="">Another reason for using 160 C instead of 320 F is precision.

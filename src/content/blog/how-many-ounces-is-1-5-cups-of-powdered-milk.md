<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on even heat distribution, so using the right amount of ingredients is crucial. Too much powdered milk can make batters overly dense, while too little might leave sauces runny.

<p>Powdered milk is a staple in many air fryer recipes, from breaded coatings to custards. Measuring by weight (ounces) rather than volume (cups) eliminates guesswork. A kitchen scale is your best friend here, especially when adapting traditional recipes for air fryer use. Need inspiration? Try our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipe collection</a> for foolproof ideas.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure Powdered Milk Correctly</h3>  
<p>Scooping powdered milk directly from the bag can lead to uneven measurements. Instead, spoon it lightly into a measuring cup and level it off with a knife. For 1.5 cups of powdered milk (12 ounces), this method ensures consistency. If your air fryer recipe calls for sifted powdered milk, measure after sifting for accuracy.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for 1.5 Cups of Powdered Milk in Air Fryers</h2>  
<p>This quantity is perfect for making breaded coatings for chicken or fish. Combine 1.5 cups of powdered milk (12 ounces) with spices and flour for a crispy, golden finish. It’s also ideal for creamy sauces in <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/potatoes>potato dishes</a>, adding richness without excess liquid.</p>  

<p>For desserts, 1.5 cups of powdered milk works wonders in air fryer cheesecakes or custards. The concentrated milk powder enhances flavour without watering down the batter.

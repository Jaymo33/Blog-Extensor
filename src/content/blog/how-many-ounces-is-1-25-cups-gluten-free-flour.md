<p>1.25 cups of gluten-free flour equals approximately 5.3 ounces (150 grams) in UK measurements. This conversion is essential for accurate baking, especially when using an air fryer for gluten-free recipes. Whether you're whipping up cakes, cookies, or bread, precise measurements ensure consistent results. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we know how crucial it is to get the ratios right for gluten-free cooking.</p>  

<h2>Why Measuring Gluten-Free Flour Correctly Matters</h2>  
<p>Gluten-free flour behaves differently than regular wheat flour, so measuring by weight (ounces) is far more reliable than volume (cups). A slight variation can lead to dry, crumbly, or dense results. For air fryer recipes, where even cooking is key, accuracy is non-negotiable. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> simplifies these calculations for hassle-free baking.</p>  

<p>Many UK bakers prefer weighing ingredients for consistency. If your recipe calls for 1.25 cups of gluten-free flour, using a kitchen scale to measure 5.3 ounces ensures perfection. This method also saves time—no more scooping and levelling cups!</p>  

<h3>Converting Cups to Ounces for Gluten-Free Flour</h3>  
<p>The density of gluten-free flour varies by brand, but a general rule is 1 cup ≈ 4.25 ounces. For 1.25 cups, multiply by 4.25 to get 5.3 ounces. Check your flour’s packaging for specific weight recommendations, as some blends differ. For more air fryer-friendly recipes, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>gluten-free collection</a>.</p>  

<h2>Common Mistakes When Measuring Gluten-Free Flour</h2>  
<p>Scooping flour directly from the bag packs it down, leading to excess flour and dry baked goods. Instead, spoon flour into the measuring cup and level it off. For air fryer recipes, this precision prevents uneven cooking or burnt edges. Always fluff the flour first to avoid compaction.</p>  

<p>Another mistake is assuming all gluten-free flours weigh the same. Almond flour, coconut flour, and rice flour have different densities. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert recipes</a> specify weights for foolproof results. When in doubt, weigh it out!</p>  

<h3>Using Ounces for Air Fryer Recipes</h3>  
<p>Air fryers circulate hot air, so batter consistency is critical. Too much flour can make cakes dense; too little can cause spreading. Measuring 1.25 cups of gluten-free flour as 5.3 ounces ensures the right texture. For cleaning tips after baking, see our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner guide</a>.</p>  

<h2>Gluten-Free Flour Substitutions and Tips</h2>  
<p>If you’re out of gluten-free flour, a blend of rice flour, tapioca starch, and xanthan gum works well. Just remember: 1.25 cups of any blend should still weigh around 5.3 ounces. For savory dishes like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>gluten-free chicken recipes</a>, weight ensures crispy coatings.</p>  

<p>Store gluten-free flour in an airtight container to prevent moisture absorption, which alters weight. For best results in your air fryer, sift the flour after measuring to avoid lumps. Happy baking!</p>

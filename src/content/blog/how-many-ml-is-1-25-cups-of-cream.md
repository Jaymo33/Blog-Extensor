<p>1.25 cups of cream equals approximately 296 ml in the UK and 295.7 ml in the US. This conversion is essential for recipes where precision matters, especially when using an air fryer. Whether you're whipping up a dessert or a creamy sauce, knowing the exact measurement ensures perfect results every time.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of cream can make or break a recipe, particularly in air fryer cooking where consistency is key. Too much liquid can lead to soggy results, while too little might dry out your dish. For air fryer recipes like creamy pasta bakes or indulgent desserts, measuring 1.25 cups of cream correctly ensures balanced flavours and textures.</p>  
<p>At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we emphasise precision for the best outcomes. Whether you're following a <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe</a> or experimenting, converting cups to ml helps avoid guesswork. This is especially useful for UK cooks using US-based recipes, where cup measurements differ slightly.</p>  

<h3>UK vs. US Cup Measurements for Cream</h3>  
<p>In the UK, 1 cup of cream is typically 237 ml, making 1.25 cups roughly 296 ml. In the US, 1 cup equals 236.6 ml, so 1.25 cups is about 295.7 ml. While the difference is minimal, it’s worth noting for recipes requiring exact measurements. For most home cooking, rounding to 296 ml works perfectly.</p>  

<h2>How to Measure 1.25 Cups of Cream Without a Measuring Cup</h2>  
<p>If you don’t have a measuring cup, you can use a kitchen scale to weigh the cream. Heavy cream weighs roughly 240 grams per cup, so 1.25 cups would be about 300 grams. Alternatively, use a liquid measuring jug with ml markings for accuracy. This method is handy for air fryer recipes where precise liquid ratios matter.</p>

<p>2.5 cups of plain flour equals approximately 10.6 ounces (oz). This conversion is essential for accurate baking, especially when using an air fryer for recipes like cakes or bread. Whether you're following a recipe from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> or experimenting with your own creations, knowing the exact weight ensures consistent results.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate flour measurements matter</h2>  
<p>Using the correct amount of flour is crucial for baking success. Too much flour can make your baked goods dense and dry, while too little can leave them crumbly. When converting 2.5 cups of plain flour to ounces, precision is key. This is especially important for air fryer recipes, where even small measurement errors can affect cooking times and textures.</p>  

<p>For example, if you're making air fryer cookies from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cookies>our cookie recipes</a>, the right flour weight ensures they spread evenly and bake perfectly. A kitchen scale is the most reliable tool for measuring flour, but if you don’t have one, our conversion guide will help you get close.</p>  

<h3>How to measure 2.5 cups of plain flour without a scale</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a scale, spoon the flour into your measuring cup and level it off with a knife. Avoid scooping directly from the bag, as this compacts the flour and leads to inaccurate measurements. Fluff the flour first with a fork to aerate it, then gently spoon it into the cup. This method will get you closer to the true 10.6-ounce weight for 2.5 cups.</p>

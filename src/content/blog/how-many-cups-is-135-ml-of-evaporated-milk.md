<h2>Understanding Evaporated Milk Measurements</h2>  
<p>Evaporated milk is a staple in many recipes, offering a rich, creamy texture. When converting 135 ml to cups, it’s important to note that 1 cup equals 236.59 ml. This means 135 ml of evaporated milk is just over half a cup. For air fryer recipes, accuracy is key to avoid overly dry or soggy outcomes.</p>  
<p>Many <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> call for evaporated milk, especially in desserts like custards or savoury dishes like creamy pasta. Knowing how to measure 135 ml of evaporated milk in cups ensures your dish turns out as intended. Always use a liquid measuring cup for the most accurate results.</p>

<h3>Why Accuracy Matters in Air Fryer Cooking</h3>  
<p>Air fryers cook food quickly and efficiently, but they rely on precise ingredient measurements. Too much or too little evaporated milk can alter the texture and taste of your dish. For example, a <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert recipe</a> might turn out too runny if you add more than 0.57 cups of evaporated milk.</p>

<h2>Converting 135 ml of Evaporated Milk to Other Units</h2>  
<p>If you don’t have a measuring cup handy, you can use tablespoons or teaspoons to measure 135 ml of evaporated milk. There are 16 tablespoons in a cup, so 0.57 cups would be roughly 9 tablespoons. This method is handy for smaller quantities or when precision is crucial.</p>  
<p>For those who prefer weight measurements, 135 ml of evaporated milk weighs about 140 grams. This is useful if you’re using a kitchen scale. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more handy measurement tips.</p>

<h2>Tips for Measuring Evaporated Milk</h2>

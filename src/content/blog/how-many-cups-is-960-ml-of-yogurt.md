<p>960 ml of yogurt is approximately 4 cups in both UK and US measurements. This conversion is essential for baking, cooking, or meal prepping with yogurt in your air fryer. Whether you're making a creamy dessert or marinating chicken, accurate measurements ensure perfect results every time.</p>  

<h2>Understanding Yogurt Measurements</h2>  
<p>When converting 960 ml of yogurt to cups, it's important to note that 1 cup equals 240 ml. This standard applies to both UK and US cup measurements, making it easy to scale recipes. Yogurt's thickness can vary, so using a measuring jug ensures precision. For air fryer recipes, like those on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, accurate yogurt measurements help maintain texture and flavour. Whether you're making cakes or marinades, 960 ml provides just the right amount for most dishes.</p>  

<p>If you're working with Greek yogurt, remember it's denser than regular yogurt. This means 960 ml might weigh slightly more, but the cup measurement remains the same. Always level off your measuring cup for consistency. For more conversion tips, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>  

<h3>Why Accurate Measurements Matter</h3>  
<p>Using the correct amount of yogurt ensures your recipes turn out as intended. Too much yogurt can make cakes soggy, while too little might dry out marinades. For air fryer cooking, precision helps achieve even cooking and perfect textures. Whether you're following a recipe from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert category</a> or prepping a savoury dish, 960 ml of yogurt translates reliably to 4 cups.</p>  

<h2>Converting 960 ml of Yogurt for Baking</h2>  
<p>Baking with yogurt adds moisture and richness to cakes, muffins, and breads. When a recipe calls for 960 ml of yogurt, knowing it's 4 cups simplifies the process. This measurement works well for large batches or meal prep. If you're adapting a traditional oven recipe for your air fryer, precise measurements ensure success. Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>cake recipes</a> to put your 960 ml yogurt conversion to delicious use.</p>  

<p>For best results, use room-temperature yogurt when baking. This helps it blend smoothly with other ingredients. If you're scaling a recipe up or down, remember that 960 ml of yogurt equals 4 cups, making adjustments straightforward. Keep our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner</a> handy for easy post-baking cleanup.</p>  

<h3>Using Yogurt in Savoury Air Fryer Dishes</h3>  
<p>Yogurt isn't just for dessertsâ€”it's fantastic in marinades and sauces too. When converting 960 ml of yogurt for savoury dishes, the 4-cup measurement remains consistent. This quantity is perfect for marinating chicken or creating creamy dips. The air fryer's even heat distribution helps yogurt-based marinades caramelise beautifully.</p>

<p>500g of honey equals approximately 17.64 ounces. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes, where precise measurements can make or break your dish. Whether you're whipping up a glaze or sweetening a marinade, knowing how to convert grams to ounces ensures consistency. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we love helping you nail every recipe with accurate measurements.</p>

<h2>Why Convert 500g of Honey to Ounces?</h2>  
<p>Many UK recipes use grams, but some kitchen scales or older cookbooks might list honey in ounces. Converting 500g of honey to ounces (17.64 oz) ensures you’re using the right amount for air fryer dishes like sticky chicken wings or honey-glazed carrots. Precision matters, especially with sticky ingredients like honey, which can throw off a recipe if measured incorrectly.</p>  
<p>If you’re using an American air fryer recipe, chances are it’ll call for ounces rather than grams. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> makes switching between units a breeze. Plus, honey’s thickness means volume measures (like cups) aren’t always reliable—weight is king!</p>  

<h2>How to Measure 500g of Honey Accurately</h2>  
<p>For the best results, use digital kitchen scales set to grams. Scoop honey into a bowl until it hits 500g, then check the equivalent in ounces (17.64 oz). If your scales only do ounces, aim for just under 17 and 2/3 oz. Pro tip: Lightly oil your measuring spoon or cup to help honey slide off easily.</p>  
<p>Struggling with sticky residue? Check out our guide on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning your air fryer</a> after working with honey. It’s a lifesaver for keeping your appliance in top shape!</p>  

<h3>Common Uses for 500g of Honey in Air Fryer Recipes</h3>  
<p>From glazes to desserts, 500g of honey (17.64 oz) is a versatile ingredient. Try it in air-fried honey garlic salmon or drizzle it over roasted root vegetables. For sweet treats, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert recipes</a> feature honey in cakes and cookies for a natural sweetness.</p>  

<h3>Does Honey Weight Vary by Type?</h3>  
<p>While all honey weighs roughly the same (500g = ~17.64 oz), thicker varieties like manuka may pack slightly denser. For air fryer recipes, stick to the standard conversion unless the recipe specifies otherwise. Runny honey pours easier, making it ideal for marinades.</p>  

<h2>Handy Conversions for Air Fryer Cooking</h2>

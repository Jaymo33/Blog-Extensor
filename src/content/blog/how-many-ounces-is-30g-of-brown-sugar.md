<p>30g of brown sugar equals approximately 1.06 ounces. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes, where precise measurements can make all the difference. Whether you’re whipping up a dessert or a savoury dish, knowing how to convert grams to ounces ensures your recipe turns out perfectly every time. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we help simplify these conversions so you can focus on cooking.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer recipes</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on precise cooking times and ingredient quantities to deliver consistent results. Using the correct amount of brown sugar, whether in grams or ounces, ensures your dishes caramelise properly without burning. Too much sugar can lead to overly sticky or burnt edges, while too little might leave your dish lacking flavour. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> makes it easy to switch between units effortlessly.</p>  

<p>Brown sugar is a common ingredient in many air fryer recipes, from glazes to baked goods. Its moisture content means it behaves differently than white sugar, so measuring accurately is key. If you’re working with 30g of brown sugar, knowing it’s roughly 1.06 ounces helps you follow recipes precisely, whether they’re written in metric or imperial measurements.</p>  

<h3>How to measure 30g of brown sugar without scales</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a kitchen scale, you can still measure 30g of brown sugar using tablespoons. One packed tablespoon of brown sugar is about 12-15g, so two tablespoons will get you close to 30g. For a more precise measurement, lightly spoon the sugar into a measuring cup and level it off. Remember, brown sugar should be packed firmly when measuring by volume to ensure accuracy.</p>  

<h2>Common air fryer recipes using 30g of brown sugar</h2>  
<p>Many delicious air fryer recipes call for around 30g of brown sugar. For example, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer glazed carrots</a> use this amount to create a sweet, caramelised coating. Brown sugar is also perfect for marinades, like those used in <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>air fryer chicken recipes</a>, where it balances savoury and sweet flavours.</p>  

<p>Desserts like air fryer cinnamon rolls or sticky toffee pudding often require 30g of brown sugar for the perfect texture and taste. If you’re experimenting with your own recipes, our conversion guide ensures you’ll never be left guessing how many ounces 30g of brown sugar is. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner tips</a> to keep your appliance in top shape after cooking sugary dishes.</p>  

<h3>Converting other sugar measurements for air fryer cooking</h3>  
<p>If your recipe calls for a different amount of brown sugar, you can use the same conversion ratio: 1 gram equals roughly 0.035 ounces. For example, 50g of brown sugar is about 1.76 ounces, while 100g is approximately 3.53 ounces. Keeping these conversions handy ensures you can adapt any recipe to your air fryer with confidence.</p>  

<h2>Tips for working with brown sugar in air fryers</h2>  
<p>Brown sugar can clump over time, so storing it in an airtight container helps maintain its texture. If your sugar has hardened, a quick zap in the microwave or a slice of bread in the container can soften it again. When measuring, always pack it firmly to avoid air gaps, which can throw off your recipe’s balance.</p>  

<p>For sticky recipes like glazes or marinades, mixing brown sugar with a bit of oil or butter helps it distribute evenly in the air fryer. This prevents clumping and ensures even cooking.

<p id="">137 C is equivalent to Gas Mark 1. This is a low-temperature setting, often used for slow cooking, dehydrating, or keeping food warm. If you're using an air fryer, this conversion is handy for adapting traditional oven recipes. Many air fryer models don't use Gas Mark, so knowing the Celsius equivalent helps you set the right temperature. Whether you're baking cookies or roasting vegetables, this conversion ensures perfect results every time.</p><h2 id="">Understanding Gas Mark and Celsius Conversions</h2><p id="">Gas Mark is a temperature scale used mainly in the UK for ovens, while Celsius is the standard metric unit. Converting 137 C to Gas Mark is straightforward once you know the equivalents. Gas Mark 1 represents the lowest end of the temperature spectrum, ideal for gentle cooking.

Check out our <a href="https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart" id="">air fryer conversion chart</a> for more temperature guides.</p><p id="">Most modern air fryers display temperatures in Celsius or Fahrenheit, making Gas Mark conversions less common. However, if you're following an older British recipe, knowing that 137 C equals Gas Mark 1 is essential. This temperature is perfect for slow-cooking dishes like custards or melting chocolate.

Gas Mark ranges from 1/4 (107 C) to 9 (246 C), with each full mark increasing by about 13-14 C. For air fryer cooking, most recipes fall between Gas Mark 4 (180 C) and Gas Mark 7 (220 C). If you're unsure, our <a href="https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart" id="">conversion chart</a> simplifies the process for all your cooking needs.</p><p id="">Remember that air fryers cook faster than conventional ovens, so adjustments are often needed. When converting 137 C to Gas Mark for baking, check your food earlier than the recipe suggests. For savoury dishes, our <a href="https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/potatoes" id="">potato recipes</a> include both temperature scales. Always preheat your air fryer for consistent results, especially at lower temperatures like 137 C.</p><h3 id="">Tips for Baking at 137 C (Gas Mark 1) in an Air Fryer</h3><p id="">Baking at 137 C requires patience, as it's a slow process best suited for delicate items. Use parchment paper or silicone liners to prevent sticking at this low temperature. For cakes or cookies, extend the cooking time slightly compared to higher heat settings. After cooking, don't forget to <a href="https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner" id="">clean your air fryer</a> properly to maintain its performance. This temperature is also perfect for reheating without drying out your food.</p><h2 id="">Common Recipes Using 137 C to Gas Mark</h2><p id="">Several classic recipes call for 137 C or Gas Mark 1, especially in traditional baking. Meringues, for instance, benefit from this low-and-slow approach to achieve crisp shells with chewy centres. When adapting these for your air fryer, use the rack position that provides the most even heat distribution. Our <a href="https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes" id="">cake recipes</a> include adaptations for various temperature settings, including 137 C.</p><p id="">Dehydrating fruits or making beef jerky also works beautifully at 137 C in an air fryer. The circulating air ensures even drying without hot spots. For vegetables, this temperature can slowly roast them to perfection while preserving nutrients. Remember that cooking times will vary based on your air fryer model and the quantity of food. Always check for doneness rather than relying solely on timer settings when working with 137 C to Gas Mark conversions.</p>

<h2>How to Measure 250g of Hot Sauce Accurately</h2>  
<p>Using a kitchen scale is the most precise way to measure 250g of hot sauce. Place your container on the scale, tare it to zero, then pour the sauce until you hit 250g. If you don’t have a scale, 250g roughly equals 8.82 fluid ounces, but viscosity can affect volume measurements.</p>  
<p>For sticky sauces, lightly grease your measuring spoon or cup to help the sauce slide out easily.

This equals about 8.82 ounces, or just over a US cup (8 oz). Always adjust for heat preference, as some sauces pack more punch per gram.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Sugar Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Baking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers cook food faster and more evenly than conventional ovens, so precise measurements are crucial. Too much sugar can cause over-browning or uneven cooking, while too little may affect taste and texture. Granulated sugar’s weight varies slightly by brand, but 2.0 cups typically weigh 400 grams. This consistency ensures your <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> turn out perfectly every time.</p>  

<p>For example, if you’re making air fryer cookies, 400 grams of sugar ensures the right sweetness and caramelisation. Always use a kitchen scale for accuracy, especially when adapting traditional recipes for air fryers.

<h3>How to Measure Granulated Sugar Correctly</h3>  
<p>To measure 2.0 cups of granulated sugar accurately, spoon the sugar into a measuring cup and level it off with a knife. Avoid packing the sugar, as this can lead to excess weight. For best results, use a digital scale to confirm 400 grams. This method is especially helpful for <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert recipes</a> where precision is key.</p>  

<h2>Converting Cups to Grams for Different Sugar Types</h2>  
<p>While 2.0 cups of granulated sugar equal 400 grams, other sugars like brown or powdered have different weights. Brown sugar, for instance, is denser due to moisture, so 2.0 cups weigh around 440 grams. Always check specific conversions when substituting sugars in air fryer recipes to maintain the intended texture.</p>  

<p>If you’re unsure, refer to a reliable conversion chart or use a scale. For more tips on air fryer maintenance, visit our guide on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning your air fryer</a>. Proper care ensures consistent performance for all your baking needs.</p>  

<h3>Common Mistakes When Measuring Sugar</h3>  
<p>One common error is scooping sugar directly with the measuring cup, which compacts it and adds extra grams. Another is using volume measurements for recipes that require weight, leading to inconsistent results. Always opt for grams when precision matters, especially in air fryer baking where even small deviations can affect outcomes.</p>

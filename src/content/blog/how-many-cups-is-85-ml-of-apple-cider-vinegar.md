<p>85 ml of apple cider vinegar is approximately 0.36 cups. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes that require precise measurements, ensuring your dishes turn out perfectly every time. Whether you're marinating chicken or adding a tangy twist to roasted vegetables, knowing how to convert ml to cups is a game-changer. For more air fryer measurement guides, visit <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>our conversion chart</a>.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of apple cider vinegar can make or break your air fryer recipe. Too little, and you might miss the tangy flavour; too much, and your dish could become overly acidic. Air fryers cook food quickly and evenly, so precise measurements ensure balanced flavours and textures. If you're new to air frying, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a> for inspiration.</p>  

<p>Apple cider vinegar is a versatile ingredient, often used in marinades, dressings, and even baking. For example, a classic air fryer chicken recipe might call for 85 ml of apple cider vinegar to tenderise the meat. Knowing the exact cup measurement helps you follow recipes accurately, whether you're cooking for one or meal prepping for the week.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure 85 ml of Apple Cider Vinegar Without a Scale</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a measuring jug with ml markings, you can still measure 85 ml of apple cider vinegar using standard cups. Since 1 cup equals 240 ml, 85 ml is roughly a third of a cup. For even more precision, use tablespoons—85 ml is about 5.7 tablespoons. This method works well for small-batch recipes, like air fryer sauces or glazes.</p>  

<h2>Common Recipes Using 85 ml of Apple Cider Vinegar</h2>  
<p>Many air fryer recipes call for 85 ml of apple cider vinegar, especially in marinades and dressings. For instance, a honey-mustard glaze with 85 ml of apple cider vinegar adds a delicious zing to air-fried salmon. You can also use it in pickling solutions for quick-pickled vegetables, a great side dish for air-fried meats. Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipes</a> for more ideas.</p>  

<p>Another popular use is in baking, where apple cider vinegar reacts with baking soda to create lift in cakes and breads. If your air fryer dessert recipe calls for 85 ml, now you know it’s just under half a cup. For cleaning your air fryer, a mix of 85 ml apple cider vinegar and water works wonders—visit our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning guide</a> for tips.</p>  

<h3>Converting Other Liquid Measurements for Air Fryer Recipes</h3>  
<p>Besides apple cider vinegar, you might need to convert other liquids like oil, broth, or lemon juice. The same principle applies: 240 ml equals 1 cup, so 85 ml is always 0.36 cups. Keeping a conversion chart handy, like the one on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, saves time and ensures recipe success.</p>

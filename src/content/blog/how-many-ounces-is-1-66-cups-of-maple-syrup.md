<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>

<h3>How to measure maple syrup for air fryer recipes</h3>  
<p>Using a kitchen scale is the most accurate way to measure 1.66 cups of maple syrup in ounces.

This method eliminates guesswork and ensures your air fryer dishes turn out perfectly every time.</p>

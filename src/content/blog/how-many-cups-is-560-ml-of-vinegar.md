<p>560 ml of vinegar is approximately 2.37 cups in the US measurement system and 2.46 cups in the UK. This conversion is essential for precise cooking, especially when using an air fryer for marinating or baking. Whether you're preparing a tangy glaze for chicken or a zesty dressing for vegetables, knowing the exact measurement ensures consistency in your dishes.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Vinegar Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Using the correct amount of vinegar is crucial for balancing flavours in your recipes. Too much can overpower a dish, while too little might leave it bland.

<h2>US vs UK Cup Measurements</h2>  
<p>The difference between US and UK cup measurements might seem minor, but it can affect your cooking. A US cup is 240 ml, while a UK cup is 227 ml. This means 560 ml of vinegar equals roughly 2.37 US cups or 2.46 UK cups. If you're using an air fryer recipe from a US source, adjust accordingly to avoid discrepancies.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure 560 ml of Vinegar Without a Scale</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a measuring jug, use standard tablespoons or teaspoons for accuracy. One tablespoon holds about 15 ml, so 560 ml would be roughly 37 tablespoons. For smaller quantities, teaspoons (5 ml each) can help fine-tune the measurement. This method is handy when preparing marinades for air-fryer dishes like chicken or vegetables.</p>

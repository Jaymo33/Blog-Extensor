<p>3 tablespoons of caster sugar weigh approximately 38 grams in the UK. This measurement is essential for baking, especially when using an air fryer, where precision can make or break your recipe. Whether you're whipping up cakes, cookies, or desserts, knowing the exact weight ensures consistent results every time.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate sugar measurements matter</h2>  
<p>Getting the right amount of caster sugar is crucial for achieving the perfect texture and sweetness in your baked goods. Too much sugar can make your treats overly sweet or cause them to brown too quickly in the air fryer. Too little, and you might end up with a dry or bland result. For air fryer recipes, where cooking times are shorter, precision is even more important.</p>  

<p>If you're adapting traditional oven recipes for your air fryer, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for helpful adjustments. Many of our favourite <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> rely on exact measurements to deliver perfect results every time.</p>  

<h3>How to measure caster sugar correctly</h3>  
<p>For the most accurate measurement, always use proper measuring spoons and level off the sugar with a straight edge. Scooping directly from the bag can compact the sugar, leading to an incorrect measurement. If you're working with larger quantities, consider investing in digital kitchen scales for perfect precision.</p>  

<h2>Converting other sugar measurements</h2>  
<p>While we've focused on 3 tablespoons of caster sugar to grams, you might need to convert other measurements too. One cup of caster sugar weighs about 225 grams, while a single tablespoon equals roughly 12.7 grams. These conversions are particularly useful when scaling recipes up or down for your air fryer.</p>  

<p>For those who love baking in their air fryer, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>air fryer cake recipes</a> often call for precise sugar measurements. Remember that different sugar types have different weights - granulated sugar is slightly heavier than caster sugar, while icing sugar is much lighter.</p>  

<h3>Common baking uses for 3 tbsp caster sugar</h3>  
<p>Three tablespoons of caster sugar (38g) is a common measurement in many recipes. You might use this amount to sweeten a small batch of cookies, a single-serving mug cake for your air fryer, or the topping for a fruit crumble. It's also the perfect amount for sweetening whipped cream or making a simple syrup for desserts.</p>  

<h2>Storing caster sugar for best results</h2>  
<p>To ensure your caster sugar measurements remain accurate, store it properly in an airtight container in a cool, dry place. Humidity can cause sugar to clump, making it difficult to measure accurately. If you notice your sugar has hardened, you can pulse it briefly in a food processor to restore its fine texture.</p>  

<p>After baking with sugar, don't forget to <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>clean your air fryer</a> properly to prevent sticky residues. Sugar can caramelize and become difficult to remove if left in your appliance too long.</p>  

<h3>Alternative sweeteners and conversions</h3>  
<p>If you're looking to reduce sugar in your recipes, you might consider alternatives like honey, maple syrup, or artificial sweeteners. However, these substitutes don't convert 1:1 with caster sugar and may require recipe adjustments. For example, 3 tablespoons of honey would weigh about 63 grams and require reducing other liquids in your recipe.</p>

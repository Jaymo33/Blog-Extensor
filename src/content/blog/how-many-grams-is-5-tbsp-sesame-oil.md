<p>5 tablespoons of sesame oil is approximately 68 grams. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements ensure perfect results. Whether you're frying, roasting, or baking, knowing the exact weight helps maintain consistency. For more air fryer tips, check out <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air frying</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on precise ingredient ratios to achieve crispy, evenly cooked dishes. Using grams instead of tablespoons eliminates guesswork, especially with oils like sesame oil, which can vary in density. This accuracy is crucial for recipes like sesame-glazed salmon or crispy tofu. Visit our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a> for more handy measurements.</p>  

<p>Sesame oil adds a rich, nutty flavour to dishes, but too much can overpower or make food greasy. Measuring by weight ensures you use just the right amount. This is particularly important for air fryer recipes, where excess oil can lead to uneven cooking. For delicious sesame-infused dishes, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipes</a>.</p>  

<h3>How to measure sesame oil accurately</h3>  
<p>For the most precise results, use a digital kitchen scale to weigh sesame oil directly in grams. If you don’t have one, remember that 1 tablespoon of sesame oil weighs roughly 13.6 grams. Multiply this by 5 to get 68 grams for 5 tablespoons. This method works for all types of sesame oil, whether toasted or light.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for sesame oil in air fryers</h2>  
<p>Sesame oil is a staple in Asian-inspired air fryer dishes, from stir-fries to marinades. Its high smoke point makes it ideal for air frying at higher temperatures. Try it in recipes like sesame-crusted shrimp or honey-glazed chicken wings. Find more inspiration in our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a>.</p>  

<p>Beyond cooking, sesame oil can be used to lightly coat vegetables or tofu before air frying for extra crispiness. Just 5 tablespoons (68 grams) can evenly coat a large batch of broccoli or cauliflower. For cleaning tips after oily cooking sessions, see our guide on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer maintenance</a>.</p>  

<h3>Converting other sesame oil measurements</h3>  
<p>If your recipe calls for a different amount of sesame oil, the same conversion applies. For example, 3 tablespoons equal about 41 grams, while 10 tablespoons weigh roughly 136 grams. Keeping these conversions handy simplifies air fryer cooking. For more measurement tips, browse our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable recipes</a>.</p>

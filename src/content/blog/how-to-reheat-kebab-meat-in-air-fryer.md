<p>To reheat kebab meat in an air fryer, set it to 160°C for 3-5 minutes until piping hot. This gentle temperature prevents drying while crisping edges perfectly – whether you’re working with leftover lamb doner, chicken shish or mixed grill skewers from last night’s takeaway.</p>

<h2>Why Air Fryers Excel at Reheating Kebabs</h2>
<p>Unlike microwaves that turn meat rubbery or ovens that dry it out, air fryers circulate hot air to recreate that just-cooked texture. The rapid airflow mimics a tandoor’s high heat, crisping the exterior while locking in juices. At <a href="https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk">airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we’ve tested this method with everything from Turkish adana to Greek souvlaki – it outperforms other reheating methods every time.</p>
<p>For best results, let refrigerated kebab meat sit at room temperature for 10 minutes first. This prevents the cold centre/overcooked edges dilemma. If your air fryer has a reheat preset (many newer models do), use it! Otherwise, manual settings work brilliantly too.</p>

<h2>Step-by-Step Reheating Instructions</h2>
<p>Whether you’re reheating kebab meat on skewers or loose pieces, the process is straightforward. First, arrange meat in a single layer in your air fryer basket – overcrowding leads to steaming rather than crisping. Lightly spritz with oil if the meat looks dry, especially important for lean chicken or turkey kebabs.</p>

<h3>Timing and Temperature Guide</h3>
<p>For most kebab meats, 160°C hits the sweet spot. Chicken and lamb need 4-5 minutes, while denser beef or kofta may require 5-6 minutes. Always check internal temperature reaches 75°C for food safety. Our <a href="https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart">air fryer conversion chart</a> helps adjust settings if your model runs hotter.</p>

<h2>Pro Tips for Perfect Results</h2>
<p>Place a slice of bread beneath skewered kebabs to catch drips without smoke. For doner meat, separate layers with tongs halfway through cooking. If reheating kebab meat with vegetables, add veggies 2 minutes later to prevent sogginess. These small tweaks make all the difference.</p>
<p>Leftover sauce? Brush it on during the last minute for caramelised edges. And if you’re meal prepping kebabs, our <a href="https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/meal-prep">meal prep recipes</a> include make-ahead tips to simplify reheating.</p>

<h3>Avoiding Common Mistakes</h3>
<p>Don’t skip preheating your air fryer – cold starts lead to uneven heating. Resist the urge to crank up temperature; 180°C+ will dry out meat. And always use tongs, not forks, to flip kebabs to retain juices. A quick clean with <a href="https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner">air fryer cleaner</a> afterwards prevents lingering smells.</p>

<h2>Adapting for Different Kebab Types</h2>
<p>Lamb doner benefits from a light spritz of water before reheating to mimic steam from vertical rotisseries. Chicken tikka needs just 3 minutes if cubed small. For seekh kebabs with minced meat, check internal temperature carefully as they dry out fastest. Explore more <a href="https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes">kebab recipes</a> to test your reheating skills.</p>
<p>Vegetarian kebabs like halloumi or mushroom benefit from lower heat (150°C) to prevent toughness. Always reheat kebabs in batches if feeding a crowd – stacking causes sogginess. With these tailored approaches, every variety stays delicious.</p>

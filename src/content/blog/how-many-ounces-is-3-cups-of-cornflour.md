<p>3 cups of cornflour equals approximately 12.6 ounces (oz). This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precision matters, ensuring your dishes turn out perfectly every time. Whether you’re making crispy coatings or light batters, knowing the exact weight of your ingredients can make all the difference.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on even heat distribution, and incorrect measurements can lead to uneven cooking or texture issues. For example, using too much cornflour in a batter can make it overly dense, while too little might not provide enough crispiness. That’s why converting 3 cups of cornflour to ounces (12.6 oz) is so important for consistency.</p>

<h3>How to measure cornflour correctly</h3>  
<p>To get the most accurate conversion from cups to ounces, spoon the cornflour into the measuring cup and level it off with a knife. Avoid packing it down, as this can lead to an incorrect weight. For best results, use a kitchen scale to measure 12.6 oz directly.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for cornflour in air fryer recipes</h2>  
<p>Cornflour is a versatile ingredient in air fryer cooking, often used for coatings, batters, and thickening sauces. For example, a light dusting of cornflour helps achieve that perfect crispy texture on fried chicken or tempura vegetables. It’s also great for gluten-free recipes.</p>

<h2>Tips for working with cornflour in air fryers</h2>  
<p>Cornflour can clump, so sifting it before use ensures a smooth texture in batters and coatings. It also browns quickly, so keep an eye on cooking times to prevent burning. For best results, preheat your air fryer to ensure even cooking.</p>

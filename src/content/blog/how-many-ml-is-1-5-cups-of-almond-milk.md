<p>1.5 cups of almond milk equals 355 ml, making it easy to measure for your air fryer recipes. Whether you’re whipping up a cake or a savoury dish, precise measurements ensure perfect results every time.

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Using the correct amount of almond milk ensures your recipes turn out as intended. Too little or too much can affect texture, moisture, and cooking time. Air fryers rely on even heat distribution, so precise measurements prevent undercooking or drying out.

Always measure liquids like almond milk carefully for consistent results.</p>  

<p>If you’re converting 1.5 cups of almond milk to ml, a standard measuring cup is your best tool. The UK and US cup measurements differ slightly, but 1.5 cups universally translate to 355 ml. This conversion is handy for baking, sauces, or even creamy <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>desserts</a>.

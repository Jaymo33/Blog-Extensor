<p>1.5 cups of desiccated coconut equals approximately 4.5 ounces (or 4.5 oz) in UK measurements. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes, ensuring your baked goods and dishes turn out perfectly every time. Whether you're making coconut macaroons or adding texture to a curry, accurate measurements matter. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we focus on precise conversions to help you cook with confidence.</p>

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>
<p>Using the correct amount of desiccated coconut ensures your recipes have the right texture and flavour. Too little, and your dish might lack crunch; too much, and it could become dry. The air fryer’s rapid circulation means ingredients cook faster, so precision is key. For more air fryer-friendly tips, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>
<p>Many UK recipes use ounces, while others rely on cups, making conversions a must. Desiccated coconut is lightweight, so 1.5 cups translates to just 4.5 ounces. This measurement is particularly useful for baking, where consistency is everything. If you're new to air frying, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipes section</a> has plenty of inspiration.</p>

<h3>How to measure desiccated coconut correctly</h3>
<p>For the most accurate results, lightly spoon desiccated coconut into a measuring cup without packing it down. Level it off with a knife for an exact 1.5 cups. If you’re using scales, 4.5 ounces is your target. This method prevents over-measuring, which can affect the outcome of your air fryer dishes.</p>

<h2>Common uses for desiccated coconut in air fryer recipes</h2>
<p>Desiccated coconut adds a delightful crunch and tropical flavour to both sweet and savoury dishes. Try it in air-fried banana bread, coconut shrimp, or as a topping for desserts. For more ideas, browse our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert recipes</a> featuring coconut.</p>
<p>It’s also a great binder in gluten-free or keto recipes, helping to hold ingredients together. Whether you're making energy balls or crusted chicken, 1.5 cups (4.5 ounces) of desiccated coconut can elevate your meal. Don’t forget to check our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning tips</a> to keep your air fryer in top shape after cooking with coconut.</p>

<h3>Converting other coconut measurements</h3>
<p>If your recipe calls for shredded or fresh coconut, the weight will differ. Shredded coconut is denser, so 1.5 cups would weigh closer to 5 ounces. Always double-check conversions to avoid mishaps. For more measurement guides, visit <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>.</p>

<p>1.5 cups of semolina equals approximately 7.5 ounces (213 grams). This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes, ensuring precise measurements for consistent results. Whether you're making crispy semolina-coated chicken or baking a semolina cake in your air fryer, accurate measurements matter. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we focus on helping you achieve perfection with every dish.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate semolina measurements matter</h2>  
<p>Using the correct amount of semolina ensures your air fryer recipes turn out just right. Too little, and your coating won’t crisp up properly; too much, and your dish might turn out dry. Semolina is a versatile ingredient, often used in air fryer recipes for breading, baking, or as a thickener. For example, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>semolina-crusted fish</a> relies on precise measurements for that perfect golden crunch. Always measure carefully to avoid kitchen mishaps.</p>  

<p>If you’re working with UK measurements, note that 1.5 cups of semolina to oz UK follows the same conversion. Whether you’re using a kitchen scale or measuring cups, consistency is key. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for other common ingredient conversions to make cooking even easier.</p>  

<h3>How to measure semolina correctly</h3>  
<p>For the most accurate results, use a digital kitchen scale to weigh your semolina. If you don’t have one, fluff the semolina with a spoon before lightly spooning it into your measuring cup. Avoid packing it down, as this can lead to over-measuring. This method ensures you get the right 1.5 cups semolina to ounces ratio every time.</p>  

<h2>Common air fryer recipes using semolina</h2>  
<p>Semolina is a staple in many air fryer dishes, from crispy coatings to fluffy baked goods. Try our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>semolina-crusted chicken tenders</a> for a crunchy, golden finish. Or, experiment with semolina cakes, which turn out beautifully light in the air fryer. The key is using the correct 1.5 cups of semolina in ounces to maintain the right texture.</p>  

<p>Another popular option is semolina-dusted potatoes, which crisp up wonderfully in the air fryer. For more inspiration, browse our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a>, where precise measurements are always provided. Remember, whether you’re converting 1.5 cups of semolina to oz or scaling up a recipe, accuracy ensures delicious results.</p>  

<h3>Tips for storing semolina</h3>  
<p>Keep your semolina fresh by storing it in an airtight container in a cool, dry place. This prevents clumping and ensures it’s ready for your next air fryer adventure. Proper storage also means your 1.5 cups semolina weight in ounces remains consistent over time.</p>

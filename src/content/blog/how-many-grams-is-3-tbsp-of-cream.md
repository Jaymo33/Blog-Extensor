<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on even heat distribution, so ingredient ratios can make or break a dish. Too much cream might make a sauce too runny, while too little could leave it dry. Grams provide a more precise measurement than tablespoons, especially for dense ingredients like cream. If you're experimenting with new recipes, always weigh ingredients for consistency.

<p>Different types of cream (single, double, or whipped) have slight weight variations, but 3 tbsp generally hovers around 45 grams. For best results, use a digital kitchen scale—it’s a game-changer for air fryer cooking. Need inspiration?

<h3>How to measure cream without a scale</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a scale, use standard measuring spoons and level off the cream with a knife. Remember, 1 tbsp equals about 15 grams, so 3 tbsp will be close to 45 grams. For sticky ingredients, lightly grease the spoon first. Avoid packing the cream down, as this can skew the measurement.

<h3>Tips for working with cream in air fryers</h3>  
<p>Cream can splatter in high heat, so use oven-safe containers or foil to shield delicate components. For sauces, warm the cream separately before adding it to the air fryer. This prevents curdling and ensures smooth results. Always preheat your air fryer for even cooking—especially when dairy is involved.</p>

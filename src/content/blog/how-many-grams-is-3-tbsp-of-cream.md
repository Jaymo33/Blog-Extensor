<p>3 tablespoons of cream weigh approximately 45 grams. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precision ensures perfect textures and flavours. Whether you're making a creamy sauce or a rich dessert, knowing the exact weight helps avoid kitchen mishaps. For more air fryer measurement tips, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on even heat distribution, so ingredient ratios can make or break a dish. Too much cream might make a sauce too runny, while too little could leave it dry. Grams provide a more precise measurement than tablespoons, especially for dense ingredients like cream. If you're experimenting with new recipes, always weigh ingredients for consistency. Visit <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>our recipe collection</a> for tried-and-tested ideas.</p>  

<p>Different types of cream (single, double, or whipped) have slight weight variations, but 3 tbsp generally hovers around 45 grams. For best results, use a digital kitchen scale—it’s a game-changer for air fryer cooking. Need inspiration? Try our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert recipes</a>, where cream measurements are key.</p>  

<h3>How to measure cream without a scale</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a scale, use standard measuring spoons and level off the cream with a knife. Remember, 1 tbsp equals about 15 grams, so 3 tbsp will be close to 45 grams. For sticky ingredients, lightly grease the spoon first. Avoid packing the cream down, as this can skew the measurement. For more tips, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning and maintenance guide</a> to keep your tools accurate.</p>  

<h2>Common cream conversions for air fryer recipes</h2>  
<p>Beyond 3 tbsp, here are other handy cream conversions: 1/4 cup is roughly 60 grams, and 1/2 cup is about 120 grams. These measurements are useful for scaling recipes up or down. Whether you're making a creamy pasta or a custard, precise grams ensure success. Looking for savoury ideas? Browse our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipes</a>, where cream often plays a starring role.</p>  

<p>Remember, UK tablespoons (15ml) differ slightly from US tablespoons (14.8ml), but the gram difference is negligible for most home cooking. Always check your recipe’s origin to avoid confusion.

<h3>Tips for working with cream in air fryers</h3>  
<p>Cream can splatter in high heat, so use oven-safe containers or foil to shield delicate components. For sauces, warm the cream separately before adding it to the air fryer. This prevents curdling and ensures smooth results. Always preheat your air fryer for even cooking—especially when dairy is involved.</p>

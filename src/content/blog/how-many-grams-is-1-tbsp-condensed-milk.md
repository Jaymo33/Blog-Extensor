<p>1 tablespoon (tbsp) of condensed milk weighs approximately 19 grams. This measurement is essential for precise baking and cooking, especially when using an air fryer where ingredient ratios can affect texture and cooking times. Whether you're making desserts or glazes, knowing this conversion ensures consistent results every time.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on even heat distribution, so ingredient quantities must be precise. Too much or too little condensed milk can alter the moisture content of your dish, leading to uneven cooking. For example, a <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>dessert recipe</a> might require exact measurements to achieve the right consistency. Using 19 grams per tablespoon ensures your air fryer creations turn out perfectly every time.</p>  

<p>Condensed milk is thicker and denser than regular milk, which is why measuring by weight (grams) is more reliable than volume (tablespoons). If you're adapting a recipe from cups or tablespoons to grams, this conversion is a game-changer. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more handy measurement swaps.</p>  

<h3>How to measure condensed milk correctly</h3>  
<p>For the most accurate results, use a digital kitchen scale. Scoop the condensed milk into a tablespoon, then weigh it to confirm it’s 19 grams. If you don’t have a scale, lightly pack the tablespoon without pressing too hard, as overpacking can add extra grams. This method works well for <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert recipes</a> like flans or air-fried cakes.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for condensed milk in air fryer recipes</h2>  
<p>Condensed milk is a versatile ingredient in air fryer cooking. It adds sweetness and creaminess to dishes like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>cakes</a>, cookies, and even glazes for meats. Because it caramelises well under high heat, it’s perfect for creating crispy, golden finishes. Just remember—19 grams per tablespoon ensures the right balance of flavour and texture.</p>  

<p>If you're reheating desserts or making a quick <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/breakfast>breakfast</a> in the air fryer, condensed milk can be drizzled over toast or pancakes. Measuring it correctly prevents overly sweet or soggy results. For cleaning sticky condensed milk spills, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner guide</a> has handy tips.</p>  

<h3>Converting other condensed milk measurements</h3>  
<p>If a recipe calls for a different amount, here’s a quick reference: 1 teaspoon (tsp) is about 6 grams, and 1 cup is roughly 300 grams. These conversions help when scaling recipes up or down for your air fryer. Always double-check measurements for best results.</p>

<p>Fresh blueberries are plump and juicy, but their size can affect cup measurements. Smaller berries pack more tightly, while larger ones leave more gaps. If precision matters, weighing them is best. For air fryer baking, consistency ensures even cooking and perfect texture. Whether you're in the UK or US, 350 grams of blueberries converts reliably to around 2.5 cups.</p>  

<h3>UK vs. US Cup Measurements</h3>  
<p>While the difference is minimal, UK and US cup sizes vary slightly. A UK cup holds 250ml, whereas a US cup is 240ml. For 350 grams of blueberries, this means roughly 2.5 cups in both systems. If you're adapting recipes from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert recipes</a>, this small variance won’t drastically alter your results. However, for exact replication, sticking to grams is safest.</p>  

<h2>Converting Blueberries for Air Fryer Recipes</h2>  
<p>Many air fryer recipes call for blueberries, from muffins to compotes. Knowing that 350 grams equals about 2.5 cups helps you adjust quantities effortlessly.

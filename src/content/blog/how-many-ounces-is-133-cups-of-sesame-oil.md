<p>1.33 cups of sesame oil equals approximately 10.64 ounces. This conversion is essential for air fryer cooking, where precise measurements can make or break a recipe. Whether you’re whipping up a stir-fry or marinating chicken, knowing the exact weight ensures consistent results. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we help you nail every measurement for perfect dishes.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of sesame oil can impact texture, flavour, and cooking time. Too much oil can make food greasy, while too little may leave it dry. Air fryers rely on hot air circulation, so balancing ingredients is key. For example, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>sesame chicken recipe</a> requires precise oil quantities for crispy, golden results. Always measure carefully to avoid mishaps.</p>  

<p>Converting cups to ounces isn’t just about following recipes—it’s about mastering your air fryer. Different oils have varying densities, so a universal conversion isn’t always accurate. Sesame oil, for instance, weighs about 8 ounces per cup. That’s why 1.33 cups of sesame oil to ounces gives you 10.64 oz. Bookmark our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a> for quick reference.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure Sesame Oil Correctly</h3>  
<p>For best results, use a kitchen scale to weigh sesame oil instead of relying solely on cup measurements. If you don’t have one, fill a liquid measuring cup to the 1.33-cup mark at eye level. Avoid guessing—small errors can affect your dish. Need more tips? Check out our guide on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>keeping your air fryer spotless</a> between uses.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for Sesame Oil in Air Fryer Recipes</h2>  
<p>Sesame oil adds a rich, nutty flavour to Asian-inspired dishes like stir-fries, marinades, and dressings. Try it in our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>air-fryer chicken recipes</a> for an extra depth of taste. Since 1.33 cups of sesame oil in ounces is roughly 10.64 oz, you can easily scale recipes up or down. Just remember: a little goes a long way!</p>  

<p>Beyond savoury dishes, sesame oil works wonders in roasted vegetables or even popcorn. Its high smoke point makes it ideal for air frying. Prefer lighter flavours? Combine it with neutral oils, but always measure carefully—1.33 cups equals 10.64 ounces.

<h3>Tips for Storing Sesame Oil</h3>  
<p>To preserve its flavour, store sesame oil in a cool, dark place. Once opened, use it within six months for the best taste. Since 1.33 cups of sesame oil to oz is 10.64, buy smaller bottles if you don’t use it often. Proper storage ensures every drop delivers maximum flavour for your air fryer creations.</p>

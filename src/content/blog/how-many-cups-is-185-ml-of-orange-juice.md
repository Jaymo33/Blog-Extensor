<p>185 ml of orange juice equals approximately 0.78 cups (or just under 3/4 cup). This conversion is essential for baking, cooking, or preparing air fryer recipes where precise measurements matter. Whether you're whipping up a marinade or a citrusy dessert, knowing how to convert millilitres to cups ensures your dish turns out perfectly.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>When using an air fryer, precise ingredient measurements can make or break a recipe. Too much liquid, like orange juice, can affect texture, while too little might leave your dish dry. For example, if you're making a glaze or marinade for chicken or salmon in your air fryer, 185 ml of orange juice needs to be measured correctly to balance flavours. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for other handy measurement tips.</p>  

<p>Many air fryer recipes, such as citrus-glazed salmon or orange-infused cakes, rely on exact liquid ratios. A slight miscalculation could lead to soggy results or uneven cooking. That’s why understanding conversions like 185 ml to cups is so valuable for home cooks. For more recipe ideas, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a>.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure 185 ml of Orange Juice Without a Measuring Cup</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a measuring cup, you can use a standard metric jug or even a tablespoon for smaller quantities. Since 1 tablespoon holds about 15 ml, 185 ml of orange juice would be roughly 12 tablespoons. Alternatively, a kitchen scale set to grams can help—orange juice weighs close to its volume in grams (185 ml ≈ 185g). This method is especially useful for baking recipes where precision is key.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for 185 ml of Orange Juice in Air Fryer Recipes</h2>  
<p>This quantity of orange juice is perfect for marinades, glazes, or even adding moisture to cakes. For instance, a sticky orange chicken dish might call for 185 ml of orange juice mixed with honey and soy sauce. Similarly, a citrus drizzle cake prepared in an air fryer could use this amount for the syrup. Browse our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipes</a> for inspiration.</p>  

<p>Another great use is in seafood dishes. A marinade of 185 ml orange juice, garlic, and herbs works wonders for shrimp or cod in the air fryer. The acidity tenderises the protein while adding brightness. For more seafood ideas, visit our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/mixed-seafood>mixed seafood category</a>.</p>  

<h3>US vs. UK Cup Measurements</h3>  
<p>Note that US cups (240 ml) differ slightly from UK metric cups (250 ml). For 185 ml of orange juice, the US conversion is 0.78 cups, while the UK metric equivalent is 0.74 cups. Most modern recipes specify which standard they use, but when in doubt, stick to the US measurement for consistency. Always double-check if adapting a recipe for your air fryer.</p>  

<h2>Tips for Storing Leftover Orange Juice</h2>  
<p>If your recipe doesn’t use the full 185 ml, store the remainder in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 3 days. Freezing in ice cube trays is another option for future use in smoothies or sauces. For more kitchen hacks, check out our guide on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>keeping your air fryer clean</a> between uses.</p>  

<p>To prevent waste, plan recipes that use similar ingredients. For example, pair an orange-glazed chicken with a citrus dessert to maximise your 185 ml of orange juice. This approach saves time and reduces food waste—key for efficient air fryer cooking.</p>

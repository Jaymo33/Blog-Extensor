<p>75g of onion equals approximately 2.65 ounces. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements can make all the difference. Whether you're prepping ingredients for a stir-fry or a casserole, knowing the exact weight ensures consistent results. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we focus on helping you get the most out of your air fryer with accurate conversions and tips.</p>

<h2>Why accurate onion measurements matter</h2>
<p>Using the right amount of onion can significantly impact the flavour and texture of your dish. Too little, and your meal might lack depth; too much, and it could overpower other ingredients. For air fryer recipes, where cooking times are shorter, precise measurements ensure even cooking. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more handy weight conversions.</p>
<p>Onions are a staple in many dishes, from soups to roasts, and their weight can vary depending on how they're chopped. That's why weighing them in grams or ounces is more reliable than estimating by volume. If you're working with 75g of onion, you'll know exactly how much to use for perfect results every time.</p>

<h2>How to convert 75g of onion to ounces</h2>
<p>The conversion from grams to ounces is straightforward: 1 gram equals roughly 0.035 ounces. For 75g of onion, simply multiply 75 by 0.035 to get 2.65 ounces. This small but crucial detail can help you follow recipes more accurately, especially those from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>our recipe collection</a>.</p>
<p>If you don’t have a kitchen scale, visual cues can help. A medium-sized onion typically weighs around 150g, so half of that would be roughly 75g. However, for the most precise results, especially in air fryer cooking, weighing your ingredients is always best.</p>

<h3>Common uses for 75g of onion</h3>
<p>75g of onion is perfect for adding flavour to smaller dishes or as part of a larger recipe. It’s ideal for air fryer fajitas, stir-fries, or even as a base for sauces. For more inspiration, browse our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable recipes</a> tailored for air fryers.</p>

<h2>Tips for measuring onions in your air fryer</h2>
<p>When prepping onions for the air fryer, consistency is key. Uniformly chopped pieces cook more evenly, preventing some from burning while others remain undercooked. A 75g portion of onion, roughly 2.65 ounces, should be enough for 1-2 servings depending on the recipe.</p>
<p>If you’re batch-cooking, consider scaling up the measurements accordingly. And don’t forget to clean your air fryer basket afterwards—our guide on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaning</a> makes it a breeze.</p>

<h3>Storing leftover onions</h3>
<p>If you’ve measured out 75g of onion but don’t use it all, store the leftovers in an airtight container in the fridge. They’ll stay fresh for up to 3 days, ready for your next air fryer adventure.</p>

<h2>How to measure 0.66 cup of pumpkin seeds</h2>
<p>Measuring 0.66 cup of pumpkin seeds can be tricky without the right tools. A standard measuring cup works, but for accuracy, a kitchen scale is ideal. Simply scoop the seeds into the cup, level them off, and you’ve got 0.66 cup—equivalent to 3.17 ounces. If you’re using a scale, weigh out 3.17 ounces directly for precision. This method eliminates any variability caused by how tightly packed the seeds are.</p>

<h3>Using pumpkin seeds in air fryer recipes</h3>
<p>Pumpkin seeds are a fantastic addition to air fryer dishes, adding crunch and nutrition. Once you’ve measured your 0.66 cup (or 3.17 ounces), toss them with a bit of oil and seasoning before air frying. They’ll crisp up beautifully in just a few minutes. For more ideas, browse our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/snacks>snacks category</a>, where pumpkin seeds often star. They’re also a great topping for soups or salads, adding texture and flavour.</p>

<h2>Common conversions for pumpkin seeds</h2>
<p>Beyond 0.66 cup, you might need to convert other amounts of pumpkin seeds to ounces. For example, 1 cup of pumpkin seeds is roughly 4.8 ounces, while 0.5 cup is about 2.4 ounces. Having these conversions handy saves time and ensures recipe accuracy.

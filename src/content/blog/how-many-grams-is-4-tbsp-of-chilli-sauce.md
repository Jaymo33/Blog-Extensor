Too much chilli sauce can overpower other flavours, while too little might leave your meal tasting dull. Measuring 4 tbsp of chilli sauce in grams ensures consistency, especially in marinades or glazes. If you’re prepping a spicy <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipe</a>, this precision is key.

<h3>How to measure chilli sauce correctly</h3>

<p>Four tablespoons of chilli sauce (60g) is perfect for marinating 500g of protein, like chicken or beef. It’s also ideal for adding a kick to air-fried vegetables or tofu.

<p>500g of sesame oil is equal to approximately 17.64 ounces. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements can make all the difference. Whether you’re whipping up a marinade or drizzling oil over veggies, knowing the exact weight ensures perfect results every time. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we’re all about making cooking simpler, and this guide is no exception.</p>

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>
<p>Using the right amount of sesame oil can elevate your air fryer dishes from good to great. Too little oil, and your food might dry out; too much, and it could become greasy. That’s why converting 500g of sesame oil to ounces (17.64 oz) is so helpful. Many UK recipes use grams, but if your kitchen scale measures in ounces, this conversion is a lifesaver. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more handy tips.</p>
<p>Sesame oil is a staple in many cuisines, especially Asian-inspired dishes cooked in the air fryer. Its rich, nutty flavour works wonders in marinades, stir-fries, and even baked goods. Whether you’re making crispy tofu or glazed salmon, getting the 500g to ounces conversion right ensures balanced flavours. For recipe ideas, browse our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/tofu>tofu recipes</a> or <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/salmon>salmon dishes</a>.</p>

<h2>How to measure sesame oil for air fryer recipes</h2>
<p>When converting 500g of sesame oil to ounces, it’s helpful to know that 1 gram equals roughly 0.035 ounces. This means 500g x 0.035 gives you 17.64 ounces. For most home cooks, rounding to 17.5 or 18 ounces is perfectly fine. If you’re using a measuring jug, note that fluid ounces and weight ounces differ slightly – always check your tools.</p>

<h3>Using kitchen scales for precision</h3>
<p>Digital kitchen scales are the easiest way to measure 500g of sesame oil accurately. Simply place your container on the scale, tare it to zero, then pour the oil until you hit 500g (or 17.64 oz). This method eliminates guesswork and ensures consistent results in your air fryer cooking. Don’t forget to clean your scales regularly – our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner guide</a> has handy tips.</p>

<h2>Common uses for 500g of sesame oil in air fryer cooking</h2>
<p>With 17.64 ounces of sesame oil, you can create multiple batches of delicious air fryer dishes. This quantity is ideal for meal prepping or cooking for a crowd. Try using it in marinades for chicken or vegetables – the oil helps crisp the exterior while keeping the inside tender. You’ll find plenty of inspiration in our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a>.</p>
<p>Sesame oil’s high smoke point makes it excellent for air frying at higher temperatures. Unlike some oils that break down, sesame oil maintains its integrity, giving your food that perfect golden finish. Whether you’re making crispy spring rolls or glazed wings, 500g (17.64 oz) gives you plenty to work with for multiple cooking sessions.</p>

<h2>Understanding Gas Mark Conversions</h2>
<p>Gas Mark is a temperature scale used primarily in the UK for ovens and ranges. The scale runs from Gas Mark 1 (the coolest) to Gas Mark 10 (the hottest). When converting 259 celsius to gas mark, you're dealing with one of the highest oven temperatures available. This makes it ideal for recipes that need a quick, intense heat to create rise or crispness.</p>
<p>Many air fryer recipes originally designed for conventional ovens will specify Gas Mark temperatures. At airfryerrecipe.co.uk, we've found that most air fryers can achieve similar results at slightly lower temperatures due to their efficient heating systems.

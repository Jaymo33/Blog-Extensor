However, cooking time can vary based on your air fryer model and how well-done you prefer your lamb. Always use a meat thermometer to check for an internal temperature of 60-65°C for medium-rare or 70°C for well-done, and remember to let the meat rest before carving."

<h3>How to convert 1.25 kg lamb leg to pounds and ounces</h3>
<p>If you need more precise measurements, converting 1.25 kg lamb leg to pounds and ounces is simple. Since 1 pound equals 16 ounces, take the decimal part of your pound conversion—0.76 pounds—and multiply it by 16. This gives you approximately 12.16 ounces, so 1.25 kg lamb leg is roughly 2 pounds and 12 ounces. This level of detail can be helpful for very precise recipes or dietary tracking.

<h3>Using conversion charts for 1.25 kg lamb leg</h3>
<p>Keeping a conversion chart handy can save time and reduce errors when working with weights like 1.25 kg lamb leg to pounds. These charts provide quick reference points for common conversions, so you don't need to calculate each time. For example, a chart might show that 1 kg equals 2.2 pounds, making 1.25 kg roughly 2.75 pounds.

<h2>Tips for cooking a 2.76-pound lamb leg in your air fryer</h2>
<p>Cooking a 2.76-pound lamb leg in your air fryer requires some specific techniques to ensure even cooking and delicious flavour. Start by bringing the lamb to room temperature for about 30 minutes before cooking—this helps it cook more evenly. Pat the skin dry with kitchen paper to promote crisping, and season generously with salt, pepper, and your favourite herbs. Preheat your air fryer to 200°C for a few minutes to create an optimal cooking environment. Place the lamb leg in the basket, making sure it's not overcrowded, and cook for about 25-30 minutes per pound for medium-rare. Always use a meat thermometer to check the internal temperature, which should reach 60-65°C for medium-rare.</p>
<p>Resting your lamb after air frying is crucial for tender, juicy results. Once cooked, remove the lamb from the air fryer and let it rest on a cutting board for at least 10-15 minutes. This allows the juices to redistribute throughout the meat, preventing them from running out when you slice it. While resting, you can prepare side dishes or make a simple gravy from the drippings. A 1.25 kg lamb leg to pounds conversion ensures you've cooked it for the right amount of time, resulting in perfectly pink meat if that's your preference.

<h3>Common mistakes when converting and cooking lamb leg</h3>
<p>One common mistake is forgetting to account for the bone weight when converting 1.25 kg lamb leg to pounds. If your lamb leg includes the bone, the actual meat weight will be less than 1.25 kg, affecting your cooking time. Always check whether the weight given is for bone-in or boneless lamb to avoid confusion. Another error is using volume measurements instead of weight—cups and spoons won't give you an accurate conversion for meat. Always use a kitchen scale for precise measurements, especially when dealing with conversions like 1.25 kg lamb leg to pounds. These small attentions to detail make a big difference in your final dish.</p>

<h3>Cleaning your air fryer after cooking lamb</h3>
<p>Cooking a 1.25 kg lamb leg in your air fryer can create delicious drippings but also some mess. It's important to clean your appliance promptly to maintain its performance and longevity. After the air fryer has cooled, remove the basket and pan and wash them in warm, soapy water. For stubborn grease, let them soak for a few minutes before scrubbing gently. Wipe the interior of the air fryer with a damp cloth, being careful not to get electrical components wet. Regular cleaning prevents smoke and odours from building up, ensuring your next meal tastes fresh.

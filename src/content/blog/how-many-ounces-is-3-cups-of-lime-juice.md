<p>3 cups of lime juice equals 24 fluid ounces (fl oz) in the UK and US measurement systems. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes that require precise measurements, ensuring your dishes turn out perfectly every time. Whether you're marinating chicken or adding a citrusy kick to desserts, knowing how many ounces are in 3 cups of lime juice is a game-changer.</p>

<h2>Why accurate lime juice measurements matter</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of lime juice can make or break your air fryer recipes. Too little, and your dish might lack flavour; too much, and it could become overly acidic. For example, a <a href="https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes">lime-infused chicken recipe</a> might call for 3 cups of lime juice to marinate the meat properly. Accurate measurements ensure balanced flavours and consistent results.</p>  
<p>Lime juice is also a key ingredient in dressings, sauces, and even desserts like <a href="https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert">key lime pie</a>. Whether you're cooking for a crowd or meal prepping, knowing that 3 cups of lime juice equals 24 ounces helps you scale recipes effortlessly. This precision is especially useful when using an air fryer, where ingredient ratios can affect cooking times and textures.</p>

<h2>Converting 3 cups of lime juice to ounces</h2>  
<p>The conversion from cups to ounces is straightforward: 1 cup of lime juice equals 8 fluid ounces. Therefore, 3 cups of lime juice is 24 fluid ounces. This applies to both UK and US measurements, making it easy to follow recipes from either region. If you're using a <a href="https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart">conversion chart</a>, you'll find this ratio holds true for most liquid ingredients.</p>  
<p>For those who prefer weight measurements, 3 cups of lime juice also weighs approximately 24 ounces by volume. However, if you're using a kitchen scale, note that the density of lime juice might cause slight variations. Always measure liquids in a clear measuring jug for the most accurate results.</p>

<h3>Tips for measuring lime juice in an air fryer recipe</h3>  
<p>When working with lime juice in air fryer recipes, freshness matters. Bottled lime juice can vary in acidity, so freshly squeezed is often best. If your recipe calls for 3 cups of lime juice (24 ounces), consider juicing 12–15 limes, depending on their size. Store any leftover juice in an airtight container in the fridge for up to a week.</p>

<h2>Common uses for 3 cups of lime juice</h2>  
<p>Three cups of lime juice (24 ounces) is a generous amount, perfect for batch cooking or large gatherings. You might use it to marinate <a href="https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken">chicken wings</a> or shrimp before air frying, ensuring a tangy, flavourful result. It's also ideal for making large batches of lime-based sauces or dressings to pair with air-fried vegetables.</p>  
<p>Another great use for 3 cups of lime juice is in <a href="https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert">citrus desserts</a>, where the acidity balances the sweetness. Whether you're baking a lime cake or making a sorbet, knowing the ounce equivalent helps you adjust recipes with confidence. Always taste as you go, especially when working with strong flavours like lime.</p>

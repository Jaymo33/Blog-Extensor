<p>25 grams of mayonnaise equals approximately 0.88 ounces. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes, where precise measurements can make or break your dish. Whether you're whipping up a quick sauce or coating chicken for a crispy finish, knowing how to convert 25g of mayonnaise to ounces ensures consistency. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we help simplify these conversions so you can focus on cooking delicious meals.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate mayonnaise measurements matter</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of mayonnaise in your air fryer recipes ensures the perfect texture and flavour. Too much can make dishes greasy, while too little may leave them dry. For example, when making air fryer chicken tenders, 25g of mayonnaise (0.88 ounces) is often the ideal amount for a light, crispy coating. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipes section</a> for more inspiration on balancing ingredients.</p>  

<p>Mayonnaise is a common binding agent in air fryer recipes, from breaded fish to veggie bakes. If you're converting 25g of mayonnaise to ounces for a UK recipe, remember that UK and US fluid ounces differ slightly. For weight measurements like grams to ounces, the conversion remains consistent. This precision is especially useful for meal preppers who batch-cook using their air fryer.</p>  

<h3>How to measure 25g of mayonnaise without scales</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have kitchen scales, you can still measure 25g of mayonnaise (0.88 ounces) using tablespoons. One level UK tablespoon holds about 15g of mayonnaise, so 1.5 tablespoons will give you roughly 25g. For sticky ingredients like mayo, lightly greasing the spoon helps it slide off cleanly. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a> includes handy tips for measuring other common air fryer ingredients.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for 25g of mayonnaise in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>This small but mighty amount of mayo works wonders in air fryer recipes. Mix 25g of mayonnaise with breadcrumbs for a golden crust on fish fillets or tofu. It’s also perfect for binding seasoning blends onto roasted potatoes or <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetables</a>. Since air fryers circulate hot air, a light mayo coating helps spices adhere without overpowering the dish.</p>  

<p>For creamy dips or dressings, 25g of mayonnaise (0.88 ounces) balances tang and richness. Combine it with yoghurt, herbs, and a squeeze of lemon for a quick sauce. If you’re reheating leftovers like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken</a>, a dab of mayo prevents dryness while adding flavour. Always store opened mayo properly and check our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning guide</a> to keep your air fryer fresh after oily recipes.</p>  

<h3>Converting other mayonnaise amounts for air fryer recipes</h3>  
<p>Once you’ve mastered 25g of mayonnaise to ounces, scaling up or down is straightforward. For example, 50g equals 1.76 ounces, while 10g is about 0.35 ounces. These conversions are handy when adjusting portion sizes or trying new recipes. Most UK air fryer recipes specify grams, but knowing both measurements gives you flexibility with international cookbooks.</p>

<p>2 tablespoons (tbsp) of water weigh exactly 30 grams (g). This measurement is consistent whether you're using UK or metric tablespoons, making it easy to convert for air fryer recipes. Precise measurements like this are key to perfecting dishes, especially when using an air fryer where ingredient ratios matter.</p>

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>
<p>Air fryers rely on precise cooking times and temperatures, so ingredient measurements need to be spot-on. Using 30 grams of water instead of roughly estimating ensures your recipes turn out as intended. Whether you're making sauces, batters, or steaming vegetables, knowing the exact weight of 2 tbsp of water helps maintain consistency.</p>
<p>Many air fryer recipes, like those on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, list ingredients by weight for accuracy. This avoids the variability that can come with volume measurements. For example, a light drizzle versus a packed tablespoon can throw off moisture levels in dishes like air-fried cakes or steamed buns.</p>

<h2>Converting other liquid measurements</h2>
<p>If your recipe calls for a different amount of water, here’s how to scale it. One tablespoon (tbsp) of water equals 15 grams, while a teaspoon (tsp) is 5 grams. A cup of water, which is 16 tbsp, weighs 240 grams. These conversions are handy for adjusting portion sizes or scaling up recipes.</p>
<p>For more conversions, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>. It covers common ingredients like flour, sugar, and oils, helping you switch between volume and weight measurements effortlessly. This is especially useful for baking in your air fryer, where precision is crucial.</p>

<h3>Common uses for 2 tbsp of water in air fryer cooking</h3>
<p>Two tablespoons of water (30g) is often used to add moisture or create steam in the air fryer. For example, sprinkling water on potatoes before air frying helps them crisp up. It’s also used in marinades, like for <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>air fryer chicken</a>, to help spices adhere better.</p>

<h2>Tips for measuring water accurately</h2>
<p>To measure 2 tbsp of water precisely, use a liquid measuring cup or a kitchen scale. Scales are more reliable since they eliminate the guesswork of meniscus levels in cups. If using tablespoons, fill them to the brim without spilling for an exact 30-gram measure.</p>
<p>For sticky or thick liquids like oil or syrup, weighing is even more important. A gram scale ensures you’re not accidentally adding too much, which could affect cooking times. Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaning tips</a> to keep your scale and tools in top shape.</p>

<h3>Why weight beats volume for liquids</h3>
<p>Weight measurements are more consistent because they aren’t affected by factors like temperature or how you fill the spoon. For example, 2 tbsp of cold water and 2 tbsp of hot water both weigh 30 grams, even if their volumes slightly differ due to expansion. This makes grams a foolproof unit for air fryer recipes.</p>

<h2>Frequently asked conversions</h2>
<p>Beyond water, here are other common liquid conversions for air fryer cooking. Milk, like water, weighs about 30 grams for 2 tbsp, while oils are slightly lighter at around 28 grams. Heavy cream is denser, clocking in at 32 grams for the same volume. Always check specific ingredient densities for the best results.</p>

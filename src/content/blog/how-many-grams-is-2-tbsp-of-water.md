<p>2 tablespoons (tbsp) of water weigh exactly 30 grams (g). This measurement is consistent whether you're using UK or metric tablespoons, making it easy to convert for air fryer recipes. Precise measurements like this are key to perfecting dishes, especially when using an air fryer where ingredient ratios matter.</p>

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>
<p>Air fryers rely on precise cooking times and temperatures, so ingredient measurements need to be spot-on. Using 30 grams of water instead of roughly estimating ensures your recipes turn out as intended. Whether you're making sauces, batters, or steaming vegetables, knowing the exact weight of 2 tbsp of water helps maintain consistency.</p>
<p>Many air fryer recipes, like those on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, list ingredients by weight for accuracy. This avoids the variability that can come with volume measurements. For example, a light drizzle versus a packed tablespoon can throw off moisture levels in dishes like air-fried cakes or steamed buns.</p>

<h2>Converting other liquid measurements</h2>
<p>If your recipe calls for a different amount of water, here’s how to scale it. One tablespoon (tbsp) of water equals 15 grams, while a teaspoon (tsp) is 5 grams. A cup of water, which is 16 tbsp, weighs 240 grams. These conversions are handy for adjusting portion sizes or scaling up recipes.</p>

<h3>Common uses for 2 tbsp of water in air fryer cooking</h3>
<p>Two tablespoons of water (30g) is often used to add moisture or create steam in the air fryer. For example, sprinkling water on potatoes before air frying helps them crisp up. It’s also used in marinades, like for <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>air fryer chicken</a>, to help spices adhere better.</p>

<h2>Tips for measuring water accurately</h2>
<p>To measure 2 tbsp of water precisely, use a liquid measuring cup or a kitchen scale. Scales are more reliable since they eliminate the guesswork of meniscus levels in cups. If using tablespoons, fill them to the brim without spilling for an exact 30-gram measure.</p>
<p>For sticky or thick liquids like oil or syrup, weighing is even more important. A gram scale ensures you’re not accidentally adding too much, which could affect cooking times.

<h3>Why weight beats volume for liquids</h3>
<p>Weight measurements are more consistent because they aren’t affected by factors like temperature or how you fill the spoon. For example, 2 tbsp of cold water and 2 tbsp of hot water both weigh 30 grams, even if their volumes slightly differ due to expansion. This makes grams a foolproof unit for air fryer recipes.</p>

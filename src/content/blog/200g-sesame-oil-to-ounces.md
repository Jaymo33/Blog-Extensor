<p>200g of sesame oil is approximately 7.05 ounces. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements can make all the difference. Whether you’re whipping up a marinade or drizzling oil over veggies, knowing the exact weight ensures perfect results every time. For more air fryer conversions, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air frying</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on even heat distribution, and using the right amount of oil ensures your food cooks evenly. Too much sesame oil can make dishes greasy, while too little might leave them dry. Measuring 200g of sesame oil correctly (7.05 oz) helps maintain balance. If you’re new to air frying, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a> for inspiration.</p>  

<p>Sesame oil adds a rich, nutty flavour to dishes, but its density means weight and volume conversions aren’t always straightforward. Unlike water, oils have different densities, so 200g of sesame oil won’t match the same volume as 200g of another liquid. Always use a kitchen scale for accuracy, especially when following air fryer recipes.</p>  

<h3>How to measure 200g of sesame oil without a scale</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a scale, you can use a measuring jug marked in fluid ounces. Since 200g of sesame oil equals roughly 7.05 oz, fill the jug to just over 7 ounces for a close approximation. Remember, this method isn’t as precise as weighing, but it works in a pinch. For more tips, visit <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for 200g of sesame oil in air fryers</h2>  
<p>Sesame oil is a staple in Asian-inspired air fryer dishes. From crispy tofu to glazed chicken wings, 200g (7.05 oz) is often enough for marinating or coating. Try it in our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/tofu>tofu recipes</a> for an extra flavour kick. The oil’s high smoke point makes it ideal for air frying at higher temperatures.</p>  

<p>You can also use 200g of sesame oil to make homemade air fryer sauces or dressings. Mix it with soy sauce, garlic, and ginger for a quick marinade. Since sesame oil is potent, a little goes a long way—200g can last several meals if stored properly. Keep your air fryer clean with our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning guide</a> to avoid lingering smells.</p>  

<h3>Storing sesame oil for longevity</h3>  
<p>To preserve the quality of your 200g (7.05 oz) sesame oil, store it in a cool, dark place. Light and heat can cause the oil to spoil faster, losing its aromatic flavour. If you use sesame oil infrequently, consider refrigerating it to extend its shelf life. Proper storage ensures your air fryer dishes always taste their best.</p>

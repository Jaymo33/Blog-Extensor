<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air frying</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on even heat distribution, and using the right amount of oil ensures your food cooks evenly. Too much sesame oil can make dishes greasy, while too little might leave them dry. Measuring 200g of sesame oil correctly (7.05 oz) helps maintain balance. If you’re new to air frying, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a> for inspiration.</p>  

<p>Sesame oil adds a rich, nutty flavour to dishes, but its density means weight and volume conversions aren’t always straightforward. Unlike water, oils have different densities, so 200g of sesame oil won’t match the same volume as 200g of another liquid. Always use a kitchen scale for accuracy, especially when following air fryer recipes.</p>  

<h3>How to measure 200g of sesame oil without a scale</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a scale, you can use a measuring jug marked in fluid ounces. Since 200g of sesame oil equals roughly 7.05 oz, fill the jug to just over 7 ounces for a close approximation. Remember, this method isn’t as precise as weighing, but it works in a pinch. For more tips, visit <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>.</p>

<h3>Storing sesame oil for longevity</h3>  
<p>To preserve the quality of your 200g (7.05 oz) sesame oil, store it in a cool, dark place. Light and heat can cause the oil to spoil faster, losing its aromatic flavour. If you use sesame oil infrequently, consider refrigerating it to extend its shelf life. Proper storage ensures your air fryer dishes always taste their best.</p>

Whether you’re making a creamy sauce or a cheesy topping, knowing the exact weight helps avoid over or under-measuring.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>

<h3>How to measure soft cheese accurately</h3>  
<p>For the most precise results, use a digital kitchen scale to weigh 1.5 tbsp of soft cheese. Scoop the cheese into a measuring spoon, level it off, and then transfer it to the scale. This method eliminates guesswork and ensures your air fryer dishes turn out perfectly every time.</p>  

<h2>Common recipes using 1.5 tbsp of soft cheese</h2>  
<p>Many air fryer recipes call for small amounts of soft cheese, such as 1.5 tbsp. Cheesy stuffed peppers, creamy dips, and even air-fried desserts often require this measurement. For inspiration, browse our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> collection.</p>

Soft cheese also works wonderfully in <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable-based air fryer dishes</a>, adding creaminess without overwhelming other flavours.</p>  

<h3>Converting other soft cheese measurements</h3>  
<p>If your recipe calls for a different amount of soft cheese, you can easily scale the conversion. For example, 1 tbsp is about 15 grams, while 2 tbsp would be around 30 grams. Keeping these conversions handy simplifies air fryer cooking and reduces prep time.</p>  

<h2>Tips for working with soft cheese in the air fryer</h2>  
<p>Soft cheese can melt quickly in the air fryer, so it’s best used as a filling or topping rather than exposed to direct heat. Wrapping ingredients like chicken breasts or mushrooms with cheese ensures even cooking.

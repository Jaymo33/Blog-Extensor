<p>225 grams of rice equals approximately 1.1 cups in the UK or 1.2 cups in the US. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes, where precise measurements ensure perfectly cooked rice every time. Whether you're making a quick side dish or a full meal, knowing how to convert grams to cups takes the guesswork out of cooking. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we help simplify these conversions so you can focus on creating delicious dishes.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Rice Measurements Matter in an Air Fryer</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of rice ensures even cooking and prevents under or overcooking in your air fryer. Too much rice can lead to clumping, while too little may dry out. For 225 grams of rice, the slight difference between UK (1.1 cups) and US (1.2 cups) measurements matters when scaling recipes. If you're meal prepping or batch cooking, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for other common ingredient conversions.</p>  

<p>Rice expands as it cooks, so measuring correctly avoids overflow in your air fryer basket. Whether you're making fried rice, pilaf, or a rice-based casserole, 225 grams of rice provides a generous portion for two people. For more recipe ideas, browse our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> collection.</p>  

<h3>UK vs. US Cup Measurements for Rice</h3>  
<p>The difference between UK and US cup sizes affects how many cups 225 grams of rice will fill. A UK cup holds 250ml, while a US cup is slightly smaller at 240ml. This means 225 grams of rice equals 1.1 UK cups or 1.2 US cups. Always check which measurement system your recipe uses for the best results.</p>  

<h2>How to Measure 225 Grams of Rice Without Scales</h2>  
<p>If you don’t have kitchen scales, you can still measure 225 grams of rice using standard cups. Fill a UK measuring cup just slightly over the top (1.1 cups) or a US cup to the brim (1.2 cups). For long-grain rice like basmati or jasmine, fluff it lightly to avoid compacting. Short-grain rice like arborio may settle more densely, so adjust accordingly.</p>  

<p>For sticky rice or sushi rice, 225 grams will take up slightly less space due to higher starch content. If you're cooking rice in your air fryer, consider using a liner for easy cleanup—find the best options in our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner guide</a>.</p>  

<h3>Best Rice Types for Air Fryer Cooking</h3>  
<p>Not all rice cooks the same way in an air fryer. Basmati and jasmine rice work well for fluffy results, while brown rice may need extra water and time. For 225 grams of rice, adjust cooking times based on the type—white rice cooks faster than whole grains. Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable rice recipes</a> for tasty combinations.</p>  

<h2>Common Mistakes When Measuring Rice for Air Fryers</h2>  
<p>Packing rice too tightly into a cup can lead to inaccurate measurements. For 225 grams, spoon the rice loosely into the cup and level it off. Another mistake is ignoring rice expansion—225 grams of uncooked rice nearly doubles in volume once cooked. Always account for this when using your air fryer basket.</p>  

<p>Using the wrong rice-to-water ratio is another pitfall. While 225 grams of rice typically needs about 1.5 cups of water, air fryer cooking may require slight adjustments. For foolproof results, check our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> section for tested methods.</p>

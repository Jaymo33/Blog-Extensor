<p>400 grams of icing sugar is roughly equivalent to 3.2 cups in the UK and 3.3 cups in the US. This conversion is essential for bakers who rely on precise measurements for perfect results. Whether you're making frosting, dusting desserts, or preparing a cake batter, knowing how to convert grams to cups ensures consistency. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we understand the importance of accurate measurements in baking, especially when using an air fryer for desserts.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Measurement Matters</h2>
<p>Baking is a science, and even small deviations in measurements can affect the texture and taste of your final product. Icing sugar, also known as powdered sugar, is particularly finicky because its density can vary based on how it's packed. Too much sugar can make your frosting overly sweet or stiff, while too little can leave it runny. For air fryer recipes like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>cakes and cookies</a>, precision ensures even cooking and perfect results every time.</p>

<p>Using a kitchen scale is the most accurate way to measure ingredients, but if you don't have one, cup measurements can work with the right conversions. Always fluff your icing sugar with a fork before scooping to avoid compacting it, which can lead to inaccurate measurements.

<h3>UK vs. US Cup Measurements</h3>
<p>It's important to note that cup sizes differ between the UK and the US. A UK cup holds 250ml, while a US cup is slightly smaller at 240ml. This means 400 grams of icing sugar equals about 3.2 UK cups or 3.3 US cups. If you're following a recipe from another country, always double-check which measurement system it uses to avoid mistakes.</p>

<h2>How to Measure Icing Sugar Without a Scale</h2>
<p>If you don't have a kitchen scale, you can still measure 400 grams of icing sugar using cups. Start by fluffing the sugar in its bag or container to loosen it. Then, lightly spoon it into your measuring cup without packing it down. Level off the top with a straight edge, like a knife, for an accurate measurement. Repeat this process until you've reached the equivalent of 400 grams.</p>

<p>For best results, consider investing in a set of measuring cups or a scale for more precision. Many <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>cake recipes</a> on our site rely on exact measurements to ensure perfect texture and flavour. If you're working with frozen ingredients, like pre-made dough, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/frozen-foods>frozen foods section</a> has handy tips for adjustments.</p>

<h3>Common Mistakes to Avoid</h3>
<p>One of the biggest mistakes when measuring icing sugar is packing it into the cup, which can lead to using up to 25% more sugar than intended. Another error is using a liquid measuring cup instead of a dry one, as the latter is designed for accurate scooping. Always use the right tools and techniques to ensure your recipes turn out as intended.</p>

<h2>Converting Other Sugar Measurements</h2>
<p>If you're working with different amounts of icing sugar, here are some quick conversions: 200 grams equals about 1.6 UK cups (1.65 US cups), and 100 grams is roughly 0.8 UK cups (0.83 US cups). These conversions are handy for scaling recipes up or down, especially when baking smaller batches in your air fryer.</p>

<p>15g of lemon juice is approximately 0.53 ounces. Whether you're preparing a tangy marinade for your air fryer chicken or adding a citrusy kick to desserts, knowing this conversion ensures your recipes turn out perfectly every time. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we love helping home cooks nail their measurements for flawless results.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on precise ingredient ratios to deliver crispy, evenly cooked meals. Too much or too little lemon juice can throw off the balance of marinades, dressings, or glazes. For example, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>lemon-herb salmon recipe</a> calls for exact amounts to achieve that perfect caramelised finish. Measuring 15g of lemon juice correctly (0.53 oz) ensures your dish isn’t overly acidic or bland.</p>  

<p>Lemon juice also plays a key role in tenderising proteins like chicken or tofu before air frying. A slight miscalculation could mean tougher meat or an unbalanced flavour profile. That’s why we recommend using digital scales for grams-to-ounces conversions—especially when working with small quantities like 15g of lemon juice.</p>  

<h3>Tools for converting 15g lemon juice to ounces</h3>  
<p>While kitchen scales are ideal, not everyone has one handy. In a pinch, you can use standard measuring spoons: 15g of lemon juice equals roughly 1 tablespoon (which is close to 0.5 oz). For more precise conversions, bookmark our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for quick reference.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for 15g of lemon juice in air fryer recipes</h2>  
<p>This small but mighty quantity works wonders in countless dishes. Try it in a 15g lemon juice glaze for air-fried shrimp, or mix it into yoghurt for a light dipping sauce. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable recipes</a> often use this amount to brighten up roasted Brussels sprouts or asparagus without overpowering them.</p>  

<p>For dessert lovers, 15g of lemon juice (0.53 oz) adds just the right zing to air fryer lemon drizzle cakes or fruit compotes. It’s also a key component in our popular <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer cleaner</a> solution—mixed with water, it helps dissolve grease buildup naturally.</p>  

<h3>Adjusting recipes when you only have ounces</h3>  
<p>If your recipe lists ounces but your bottle uses grams, remember that 1 oz equals about 28.35g. So 15g lemon juice is slightly less than 0.6 oz. This nuance matters in baking or when making salad dressings where acidity levels need fine-tuning. Always level off your measurements for consistency.</p>

<p>1.75 cups of garlic paste equals approximately 14 ounces. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements ensure the best results. Whether you're making marinades, sauces, or rubs, knowing the exact weight helps avoid over-seasoning or under-flavouring your dishes. Garlic paste is a staple in many recipes featured on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, so getting the measurement right is key.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on even cooking, and incorrect ingredient quantities can throw off texture and taste. Too much garlic paste can overpower a dish, while too little might leave it bland. For example, if you're preparing a garlic-infused chicken recipe from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>our recipe collection</a>, 1.75 cups (14 ounces) of garlic paste ensures balanced flavour. Consistency is especially important when scaling recipes up or down.</p>  

<p>Garlic paste density can vary slightly depending on brand or homemade preparation. However, the standard conversion holds true for most commercial pastes. If you're unsure, weighing your ingredients with a kitchen scale guarantees accuracy. Many air fryer enthusiasts swear by this method for foolproof results.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure Garlic Paste Without a Scale</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a scale, use measuring cups and spoons for approximate conversions. One cup of garlic paste typically weighs around 8 ounces, so 1.75 cups would be close to 14 ounces. For smaller quantities, refer to <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>our conversion chart</a> for quick reference. This method works well for most recipes, though weighing remains the gold standard.</p>  

<h2>Common Recipes Using 1.75 Cups of Garlic Paste</h2>  
<p>Garlic paste is versatile and appears in many air fryer dishes. From marinades for <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipes</a> to sauces for vegetables, 14 ounces (1.75 cups) is a common quantity. For instance, a large batch of garlic butter shrimp or a flavourful lamb rub might call for this amount. The key is distributing the paste evenly for uniform cooking.</p>  

<p>If you're meal prepping, 1.75 cups of garlic paste can be portioned for multiple uses. Store leftovers in an airtight container or freeze for later. Check out <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/meal-prep>our meal prep section</a> for ideas on maximising ingredients like garlic paste without waste.</p>  

<h3>Adjusting Recipes for Different Air Fryer Sizes</h3>  
<p>Smaller air fryers might require halving recipes that use 1.75 cups (14 ounces) of garlic paste. Conversely, larger models can handle full batches with ease. Always consider your appliance’s capacity to avoid overcrowding. Proper spacing ensures crispier results, whether you're cooking garlic-roasted potatoes or marinated tofu.</p>  

<p>For cleaning sticky garlic residue from your air fryer basket, <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>our cleaning guide</a> offers simple solutions. Garlic paste can leave stubborn marks, but regular maintenance keeps your appliance in top shape.</p>

<p>1.75 cups of garlic paste equals approximately 14 ounces. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements ensure the best results. Whether you're making marinades, sauces, or rubs, knowing the exact weight helps avoid over-seasoning or under-flavouring your dishes. Garlic paste is a staple in many recipes featured on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, so getting the measurement right is key.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on even cooking, and incorrect ingredient quantities can throw off texture and taste. Too much garlic paste can overpower a dish, while too little might leave it bland. For example, if you're preparing a garlic-infused chicken recipe from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>our recipe collection</a>, 1.75 cups (14 ounces) of garlic paste ensures balanced flavour. Consistency is especially important when scaling recipes up or down.</p>  

<p>Garlic paste density can vary slightly depending on brand or homemade preparation. However, the standard conversion holds true for most commercial pastes. If you're unsure, weighing your ingredients with a kitchen scale guarantees accuracy. Many air fryer enthusiasts swear by this method for foolproof results.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure Garlic Paste Without a Scale</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a scale, use measuring cups and spoons for approximate conversions. One cup of garlic paste typically weighs around 8 ounces, so 1.75 cups would be close to 14 ounces. For smaller quantities, refer to <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>our conversion chart</a> for quick reference. This method works well for most recipes, though weighing remains the gold standard.</p>

For instance, a large batch of garlic butter shrimp or a flavourful lamb rub might call for this amount. The key is distributing the paste evenly for uniform cooking.</p>

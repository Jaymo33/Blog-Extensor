<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on even heat distribution, so ingredient quantities must be spot-on. Too much ketchup can make food soggy, while too little might leave it dry. Measuring by weight (grams) is more reliable than volume (tablespoons) for sticky ingredients like ketchup. If you’re prepping sauces for <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipes</a>, grams ensure uniformity. Plus, it’s easier to scale recipes up or down when using metric weights.</p>  

<p>Tomato ketchup’s density varies slightly by brand, but 5 tbsp generally hovers around 75g. For thicker or sweeter varieties, you might see a 5g variance. Always check labels for sugar content, as this affects texture in the air fryer. If you’re batch-cooking <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/frozen-foods>frozen foods</a>, precise ketchup measurements prevent over-saucing.</p>  

<h3>How to measure 5 tbsp of tomato ketchup without scales</h3>  
<p>No kitchen scales? Use the displacement method: fill a measuring jug with 75ml of water, then add ketchup until the water level reaches 150ml. This works because 1g of ketchup roughly equals 1ml. For sticky ingredients, a <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>silicone spatula</a> helps scrape every gram from the spoon. Remember, levelling off tablespoons is crucial—heaped spoonfuls can add 10% extra weight.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for 5 tbsp of tomato ketchup in air fryer recipes</h2>  
<p>This quantity is perfect for glazing 4-6 chicken wings or coating a batch of <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/potatoes>air-fryer potatoes</a>. Mix it with 1 tbsp vinegar and 1 tsp paprika for a quick BBQ sauce. For meatloaves or burgers, 5 tbsp (75g) binds ingredients without making them mushy. It’s also ideal for marinating tofu or veggies—just add a splash of soy sauce.</p>  

<p>If you’re adapting oven recipes for the air fryer, reduce ketchup by 20% to account for faster cooking. The concentrated heat caramelises sugars quickly, so less is often more.

<h3>Storage tips for leftover tomato ketchup</h3>  
<p>Once opened, store ketchup in the fridge to maintain freshness. Transfer unused portions from 5 tbsp measurements into airtight containers to prevent drying. Glass jars are better than plastic for preserving flavour. If you’ve pre-mixed a sauce, label it with the weight (e.g., “75g ketchup base”) for future use.</p>

<p>425 grams of granulated sugar is approximately 2.1 cups in the UK and 2.2 cups in the US. This conversion is essential for baking, especially when using an air fryer for desserts like cakes or cookies. Getting the measurement right ensures your recipes turn out perfectly every time.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Sugar Measurements Matter</h2>
<p>Granulated sugar is a staple in baking, and even a small discrepancy in measurement can affect the texture and taste of your dish. Too much sugar can make your baked goods overly sweet or cause them to brown too quickly in the air fryer. Too little, and you might end up with a bland or dry result. That’s why knowing how to convert 425 grams of granulated sugar to cups is so important.</p>
<p>If you’re using an air fryer, precise measurements are even more critical due to the appliance’s rapid cooking process.

<h2>UK vs US Cup Measurements</h2>
<p>It’s worth noting that cup measurements differ slightly between the UK and the US. In the UK, 1 cup of granulated sugar is about 200 grams, while in the US, it’s closer to 190 grams. This means 425 grams of granulated sugar converts to roughly 2.1 cups in the UK and 2.2 cups in the US.</p>
<p>If you’re following a recipe from a different country, always double-check which measurement system it uses. For a handy reference, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> includes common baking ingredients and their equivalents in both systems.</p>

<h3>How to Measure Granulated Sugar Correctly</h3>
<p>To ensure accuracy, always spoon the sugar into your measuring cup and level it off with a straight edge. Scooping directly from the bag can compact the sugar, leading to an incorrect measurement. This is especially important when working with air fryer recipes, where precision is key to achieving the perfect bake.</p>

<h2>Common Uses for 425 Grams of Granulated Sugar</h2>
<p>425 grams of granulated sugar is a common measurement for larger batches of desserts, such as cakes, cookies, or even homemade jams. If you’re using an air fryer, this amount might be used for a batch of <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>air fryer cakes</a> or a sweet glaze for pastries.</p>
<p>For those who love baking, keeping a kitchen scale handy is a great way to ensure you’re always measuring ingredients correctly. If you don’t have one, our cup conversions will help you get as close as possible to the right amount.</p>

<h3>Adjusting Recipes for Air Fryer Use</h3>
<p>When adapting traditional recipes for the air fryer, it’s important to consider how the appliance’s rapid air circulation affects sugar-based dishes. For example, cookies may brown faster, so reducing the sugar slightly or lowering the temperature can help. Always refer to trusted sources like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> for tested air fryer adaptations.</p>

<h2>Storing Granulated Sugar for Freshness</h2>
<p>To keep your granulated sugar fresh and free from clumps, store it in an airtight container in a cool, dry place. This is especially important if you bake frequently, as moisture can cause sugar to harden over time. Proper storage ensures your 425 grams of granulated sugar will be ready to use whenever you need it.</p>

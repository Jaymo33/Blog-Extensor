<p>200g of flour equals approximately 7.05 ounces. This conversion is essential for anyone baking or cooking with an air fryer, where precise measurements can make or break a recipe. Whether you're whipping up a cake or coating chicken for a crispy finish, knowing how to convert grams to ounces ensures consistent results every time. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we understand the importance of accuracy, especially when adapting recipes for your air fryer.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate flour measurements matter</h2>  
<p>Using the correct amount of flour is crucial in baking and air frying. Too much flour can make your dishes dense or dry, while too little can lead to soggy or undercooked results. For example, if you're making air fryer cookies from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>our recipe collection</a>, 200g of flour (7.05 ounces) ensures the perfect texture. Even a small deviation can alter the outcome, so sticking to precise measurements is key.</p>  

<p>Many UK recipes use grams, while some older or American recipes rely on ounces. This can be confusing if you're not familiar with conversions. A digital kitchen scale is the best tool for accuracy, but if you don't have one, knowing that 200g of flour is roughly 7.05 ounces will help.

<h3>How to measure 200g of flour without scales</h3>  
<p>If you don't have scales, you can use measuring cups, though this method is less precise. One cup of all-purpose flour typically weighs around 120g, so 200g would be roughly 1 and 2/3 cups. However, flour can settle or become compacted, so spooning it lightly into the cup and levelling it off gives the most accurate result. For air fryer recipes like those in our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>cake category</a>, precision is especially important.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for 200g of flour in air frying</h2>  
<p>200g of flour is a common measurement in many air fryer recipes. It's enough to coat chicken for crispy tenders, make a small batch of dough for air fryer flatbreads, or prepare batter for onion rings. If you're meal prepping, you might use 200g of flour to make a batch of air fryer scones or muffins from our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/breakfast>breakfast recipes</a>.</p>

<p>1 cup of rapeseed oil equals approximately 7.7 ounces (or 7.7 oz). This measurement is essential for air fryer recipes, where precise oil quantities can affect texture and crispiness. Rapeseed oil, commonly used in UK kitchens, is a versatile choice for frying, baking, and roasting. Whether you're following a recipe from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> or experimenting with your own creations, knowing this conversion ensures consistency.</p>  

<h2>Why Measure Rapeseed Oil Accurately?</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of rapeseed oil in your air fryer can make a noticeable difference in cooking results. Too little oil may leave food dry, while too much can make it greasy. Rapeseed oil has a high smoke point, making it ideal for air frying at higher temperatures. For perfect crispy chips or golden chicken wings, stick to the 7.7-ounce measurement per cup. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for other common ingredient conversions.</p>  

<p>Many air fryer recipes, like those in our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken category</a>, call for light oil coatings. Measuring rapeseed oil in ounces ensures you don’t overpower delicate flavours. A kitchen scale can help, but if you’re using cups, remember 1 cup = 7.7 oz. This small detail keeps your meals balanced and delicious.</p>  

<h3>How to Convert 1 Cup of Rapeseed Oil to Ounces</h3>  
<p>Converting 1 cup of rapeseed oil to ounces is straightforward. Since 1 cup holds 7.7 ounces, you can adjust quantities for larger or smaller batches. For example, half a cup would be 3.85 oz, while two cups equal 15.4 oz. This conversion is particularly useful when scaling recipes from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>our collection</a> to feed more people.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for Rapeseed Oil in Air Fryers</h2>  
<p>Rapeseed oil is a staple in British cooking, especially for air fryers. Its neutral taste and high smoke point (around 230°C) make it perfect for frying, roasting, and even baking. From crispy potatoes to succulent salmon, many <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/potatoes>potato recipes</a> benefit from a light rapeseed oil coating. Measuring 1 cup (7.7 oz) ensures even distribution without excess grease.</p>  

<p>For healthier alternatives, some cooks use spray bottles to mist rapeseed oil onto food. Even then, knowing that 1 cup equals 7.7 ounces helps control portions. If you’re cleaning your air fryer after use, our guide on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer maintenance</a> can help keep it in top condition.</p>  

<h3>Tips for Measuring Rapeseed Oil Without a Scale</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a kitchen scale, use a liquid measuring cup for accuracy. Fill it to the 1-cup mark, and you’ll have roughly 7.7 ounces of rapeseed oil. For smaller amounts, tablespoons and teaspoons can help—just remember that 1 tablespoon is about 0.5 oz. This method works well for most <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable recipes</a> requiring light oiling.</p>

<p>560 ml of lemon juice is approximately 2.37 cups in the US measurement system and 1.97 cups in the UK measurement system. Whether you're whipping up a zesty dessert or a tangy marinade for your air fryer, getting the measurements right is key. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we know how important precision is when converting ml to cups, especially for recipes like lemon drizzle cake or citrus-glazed chicken.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Using the correct amount of lemon juice can make or break a dish. Too little, and your recipe lacks brightness; too much, and it becomes overpowering. Air fryer recipes, like those found on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>our recipes page</a>, often rely on precise liquid measurements for marinades, glazes, and sauces. Whether you're making lemon garlic shrimp or a tangy glaze for salmon, knowing how to convert 560 ml of lemon juice to cups ensures consistent results every time.</p>  

<p>Lemon juice is a staple in many air fryer dishes, from crispy lemon pepper chicken to refreshing desserts. If you're working with a recipe that calls for 560 ml of lemon juice, you'll need to know the exact cup equivalent to avoid guesswork. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for quick reference on other common measurements.</p>  

<h3>US vs. UK Cup Measurements</h3>  
<p>The difference between US and UK cup measurements can be confusing. In the US, 1 cup equals 240 ml, while in the UK, 1 cup is 284 ml. This means 560 ml of lemon juice converts to roughly 2.37 US cups or 1.97 UK cups. If you're following a recipe from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>our dessert category</a>, always check which measurement system it uses to avoid errors.</p>  

<h2>How to Measure 560 ml of Lemon Juice Without a Scale</h2>  
<p>If you don't have a measuring jug, you can still measure 560 ml of lemon juice using standard cups. For US cups, fill 2 cups completely and add another 1/3 cup. For UK cups, fill 1 cup, then add another cup filled to just under the brim. Freshly squeezed lemon juice works best for recipes, but bottled juice is a convenient alternative. Just make sure it's pure lemon juice without added sugars or preservatives.</p>  

<p>For air fryer recipes like lemon herb chicken or citrus-glazed vegetables, accuracy is crucial. Too much liquid can make your dish soggy, while too little can leave it dry. If you're unsure, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner guide</a> can help you tackle any sticky lemon residue afterward!</p>  

<h3>Common Recipes Using 560 ml of Lemon Juice</h3>  
<p>560 ml of lemon juice is often used in larger batches of lemon curd, salad dressings, or marinades. For air fryer cooking, it's perfect for making lemon-infused olive oil sprays or glazes. If you're experimenting with new dishes, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipe category</a> for inspiration on how to incorporate this citrusy ingredient.</p>

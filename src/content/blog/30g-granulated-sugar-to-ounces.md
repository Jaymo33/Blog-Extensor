<h2>Why Convert 30g of Granulated Sugar to Ounces?</h2>
<p>Many UK recipes, especially those for air fryers, use grams as the standard measurement. However, some kitchen scales or older recipes might still reference ounces. Converting 30g of granulated sugar to ounces (1.06 oz) helps avoid confusion and guarantees accuracy. This is particularly useful when following international recipes or using scales with different unit settings.</p>
<p>For air fryer recipes, precision is key. Too much or too little sugar can affect texture and browning. If you're exploring sweet treats like cakes or cookies on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, this conversion ensures your desserts turn out perfectly every time.</p>

<h2>How to Measure 30g of Granulated Sugar Accurately</h2>
<p>Using a digital kitchen scale is the most accurate way to measure 30g of granulated sugar. Set your scale to grams, then pour the sugar until it hits 30g. If your scale only displays ounces, aim for 1.06 oz. For those without scales, 30g of granulated sugar is roughly two tablespoons, though this can vary slightly depending on how tightly packed the sugar is.</p>
<p>When preparing air fryer recipes, consistency matters. A slight deviation in sugar quantity can alter caramelisation or crispiness.

<p>30g of granulated sugar equals approximately 1.06 ounces. This conversion is essential for precise baking and cooking, especially when using an air fryer where measurements can make or break a recipe. Whether you're whipping up desserts or adjusting ingredients, knowing how to convert 30g of granulated sugar to ounces ensures consistent results.</p>

<h2>Why Convert 30g of Granulated Sugar to Ounces?</h2>
<p>Many UK recipes, especially those for air fryers, use grams as the standard measurement. However, some kitchen scales or older recipes might still reference ounces. Converting 30g of granulated sugar to ounces (1.06 oz) helps avoid confusion and guarantees accuracy. This is particularly useful when following international recipes or using scales with different unit settings.</p>
<p>For air fryer recipes, precision is key. Too much or too little sugar can affect texture and browning. If you're exploring sweet treats like cakes or cookies on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, this conversion ensures your desserts turn out perfectly every time.</p>

<h2>How to Measure 30g of Granulated Sugar Accurately</h2>
<p>Using a digital kitchen scale is the most accurate way to measure 30g of granulated sugar. Set your scale to grams, then pour the sugar until it hits 30g. If your scale only displays ounces, aim for 1.06 oz. For those without scales, 30g of granulated sugar is roughly two tablespoons, though this can vary slightly depending on how tightly packed the sugar is.</p>
<p>When preparing air fryer recipes, consistency matters. A slight deviation in sugar quantity can alter caramelisation or crispiness. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for other common ingredient conversions to streamline your cooking process.</p>

<h3>Common Uses for 30g of Granulated Sugar in Air Fryer Recipes</h3>
<p>30g of granulated sugar is a common measurement in many air fryer desserts. From glazes for cinnamon rolls to sweet coatings for fruit, this amount adds just the right touch of sweetness. It’s also ideal for small-batch recipes, ensuring you don’t over-sweeten your dishes.</p>

<h2>Converting Other Sugar Quantities</h2>
<p>If your recipe calls for more or less sugar, the same conversion principle applies. For example, 15g of granulated sugar equals 0.53 oz, while 60g equals 2.12 oz. Keeping a conversion chart handy, like the one on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, simplifies the process for all your cooking needs.</p>
<p>Granulated sugar isn’t the only ingredient you might need to convert. Whether it’s flour, butter, or spices, precise measurements ensure your air fryer creations turn out as intended. Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert category</a> for recipes that put these conversions to delicious use.</p>

<h3>Tips for Measuring Sugar Without a Scale</h3>
<p>If you don’t have a scale, use measuring spoons for approximate conversions. Remember, 30g of granulated sugar is about two level tablespoons. For sticky or compacted sugar, fluff it up with a fork before measuring to avoid over-packing.</p>

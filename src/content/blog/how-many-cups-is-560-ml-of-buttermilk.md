<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter</h2>
<p>When it comes to baking, precision is key. Too much or too little buttermilk can affect the texture and taste of your dish. For example, if you’re making a fluffy buttermilk pancake recipe in your air fryer, 560 ml of buttermilk translates to roughly 2.37 cups. This accuracy ensures your batter has the right consistency for perfect pancakes every time.</p>

<h3>US vs UK Cup Measurements</h3>
<p>It’s worth noting that US and UK cup measurements differ slightly. In the UK, 1 cup is 250 ml, so 560 ml of buttermilk would be 2.24 cups.

Whether you're baking or frying, knowing how to convert millilitres to cups ensures consistent results every time.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Frying</h2>
<p>When using an air fryer, precise measurements like 160 ml of coconut oil in cups can affect cooking times and textures. Too much oil can make food greasy, while too little may dry it out. Coconut oil is a popular choice for air frying due to its high smoke point and health benefits.

<p>Many air fryer recipes, especially those for baked goods or crispy vegetables, call for coconut oil. Converting 160 ml of coconut oil to cups ensures you follow the recipe correctly. This is particularly important for dishes like air-fried chicken or roasted potatoes, where oil quantity impacts crispiness.</p>

<h2>How to Measure 160 ml of Coconut Oil</h2>
<p>Measuring 160 ml of coconut oil in cups requires a bit of math, but it's straightforward. Since 1 cup equals 236.59 ml, dividing 160 ml by this number gives you roughly 0.68 cups.

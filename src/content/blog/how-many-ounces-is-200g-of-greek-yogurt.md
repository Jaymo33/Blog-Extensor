<p>200g of greek yogurt is approximately 7.05 ounces. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes, where precise measurements can make all the difference. Whether you're whipping up a healthy breakfast or a creamy dessert, knowing how to convert grams to ounces ensures your dish turns out perfectly every time.</p>

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>
<p>Air fryers rely on precise cooking times and temperatures to deliver crispy, evenly cooked results. Using the right amount of ingredients, like 200g of greek yogurt, ensures your recipes turn out as intended. Too much or too little can affect texture and cooking time, so it's worth getting it right.</p>
<p>For example, if you're making a <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>yogurt-based marinade</a> for chicken, 200g of greek yogurt (7.05 ounces) will coat about four chicken breasts perfectly. This balance ensures even cooking and maximum flavour absorption.

<h2>How to measure 200g of greek yogurt without scales</h2>
<p>If you don't have a kitchen scale, you can still measure 200g of greek yogurt (7.05 ounces) using simple household items. A standard metric measuring cup holds about 250ml, which is roughly 250g for liquids like yogurt. Fill it to just under the top to get close to 200g.</p>
<p>Alternatively, use tablespoons: 200g of greek yogurt is about 13-14 tablespoons. This method is less precise but works in a pinch. For best results, invest in a digital scale – they're affordable and make air fryer cooking much easier.</p>

<h3>Converting other yogurt amounts</h3>
<p>Need to convert different amounts? Here's a quick guide: 100g of greek yogurt is 3.53 ounces, and 500g is 17.64 ounces.

<h3>Storage tips for greek yogurt</h3>
<p>Once opened, greek yogurt stays fresh for about 7-10 days in the fridge. Always seal the container tightly to prevent drying out. If you've measured out 200g (7.05 ounces) for a recipe but don't use it all, transfer the remainder to an airtight container immediately.</p>

<h2>Understanding Almond Milk Measurements</h2>
<p>Almond milk is a staple in many kitchens, especially for those avoiding dairy. When a recipe calls for 460 ml of almond milk, you might wonder how that translates to cups. The answer depends on whether you're using UK or US cup measurements. In the UK, 1 cup is 284 ml, while in the US, it's 240 ml. This slight difference matters when precision is key, such as in baking or air fryer recipes.</p>
<p>For air fryer cooking, accurate measurements ensure even cooking and perfect texture. Whether you're making a batter for crispy tofu or a sauce for chicken, 460 ml of almond milk is just under 2 cups.

<h2>Why Accurate Conversions Matter</h2>
<p>Using the right amount of almond milk can affect the moisture and consistency of your dish. Too much, and your air fryer recipe might turn out soggy; too little, and it could be dry. For example, if you're making a batter for air-fried mushrooms, 460 ml of almond milk (1.94 cups) gives the ideal thickness. Precision is especially crucial for baking, where ratios are everything.</p>

Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipes section</a> features dozens of dishes where almond milk plays a starring role.

<h3>UK vs. US Cup Measurements</h3>
<p>In the UK, 1 cup equals 284 ml, so 460 ml of almond milk is roughly 1.94 cups. In the US, where 1 cup is 240 ml, 460 ml converts to about 1.95 cups. While the difference is minimal, it's worth noting for recipes requiring exact proportions. For air fryer cooking, this precision ensures your dishes turn out just right.</p>

<h3>Converting for Baking and Cooking</h3>
<p>When baking in your air fryer, 460 ml of almond milk can be used in cakes, muffins, or even pancakes. The slight variance between UK and US cups won't drastically alter most recipes, but it's good practice to stick to one system. For savoury dishes like creamy pasta or sauces, 460 ml (just under 2 cups) adds richness without overpowering other flavours.</p>

<h2>Tips for Measuring Almond Milk</h2>
<p>For the most accurate results, use a liquid measuring cup rather than dry cups. Pour the almond milk to the desired line at eye level to avoid over- or under-measuring. If you don't have a measuring cup, a standard UK mug holds about 300 ml, so 460 ml would be roughly one and a half mugs.

<p>0.375 cup of butter equals 3 ounces. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements can make or break your dish. Whether you’re whipping up a batch of cookies or preparing a savoury dish, knowing how to convert cups to ounces ensures consistency. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we focus on making cooking simpler with accurate conversions and delicious recipes.</p>

<h2>Why accurate butter measurements matter</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of butter is crucial for achieving the perfect texture and flavour in your air fryer dishes. Too little butter can leave your food dry, while too much can make it greasy. For example, if you’re making air fryer cookies, 0.375 cup of butter (3 ounces) ensures the dough holds together without becoming overly rich. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipes</a> section offers plenty of ideas to put this measurement to good use.</p>  

<p>Butter measurements can vary slightly depending on how it’s packed into the cup. For the most accurate results, we recommend using a kitchen scale to weigh your butter. This eliminates guesswork and guarantees your air fryer creations turn out perfectly every time. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more handy measurement tips.</p>  

<h3>How to measure 0.375 cup of butter without a scale</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a kitchen scale, you can still measure 0.375 cup of butter using standard measuring cups. One stick of butter typically equals 0.5 cup or 4 ounces, so 0.375 cup is three-quarters of a stick. Simply cut the stick into four equal parts and use three of them. This method is quick and easy, especially when you’re in the middle of cooking.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for 0.375 cup of butter in air fryer recipes</h2>  
<p>This measurement is often used in smaller batches of baked goods or sauces. For instance, a single-serving air fryer cake might call for 0.375 cup of butter to keep the portion just right. You’ll also find this amount in recipes like garlic butter shrimp or crispy potatoes, where butter adds richness without overwhelming the dish. Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert recipes</a> for inspiration.</p>  

<p>Butter isn’t just for baking—it’s also great for basting meats or creating crispy coatings. When converting 0.375 cup of butter to ounces, remember that 3 ounces is enough to coat a small chicken breast or a handful of vegetables. For more savoury ideas, head to our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipes</a> section.</p>  

<h3>Tips for storing and using butter in air fryer cooking</h3>  
<p>Butter should be stored in an airtight container in the fridge to maintain freshness. If you’re using it for air frying, let it soften slightly before measuring to ensure accuracy. Melted butter works well for coatings, while softened butter is ideal for mixing into doughs or batters.

<p>85 ml of chicken broth equals approximately 0.36 cups (just over 1/3 cup). This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes, where precise measurements can make or break a dish. Whether you're making soups, sauces, or marinades, knowing how to convert millilitres to cups ensures consistent results every time.</p>  

<h2>Understanding the Conversion: 85 ml to Cups</h2>  
<p>Converting millilitres to cups can be tricky, especially when working with liquids like chicken broth. In the UK, metric measurements are standard, but many recipes—especially those from the US—use cups. For 85 ml of chicken broth, the conversion is roughly 0.36 cups, or just over a third of a cup. This measurement is particularly useful when adapting recipes for your air fryer, where liquid quantities can affect cooking times and textures.</p>  

<p>If you're using an air fryer for dishes like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipes</a>, precise broth measurements ensure your marinades or sauces aren’t too watery. A handy <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> can help you switch between metric and imperial measurements effortlessly.</p>  

<h3>Why Accuracy Matters in Air Fryer Cooking</h3>  
<p>Air fryers circulate hot air rapidly, so excess liquid can lead to steaming rather than crisping. Whether you're making a glaze or a broth-based sauce, measuring 85 ml of chicken broth correctly ensures your dish turns out perfectly. Too much liquid can also cause spills, making cleanup a hassle—check out our guide on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning your air fryer</a> for tips.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for 85 ml of Chicken Broth</h2>  
<p>Chicken broth is a versatile ingredient, and 85 ml (or 0.36 cups) is often used in small-batch recipes. For example, it’s perfect for deglazing an air fryer pan after cooking chicken or adding moisture to <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>roasted vegetables</a>. It’s also ideal for making jus or light sauces to accompany air-fried meats.</p>  

<p>If you're scaling up a recipe, remember that 170 ml would be roughly 0.72 cups (just under 3/4 cup). Keeping these conversions in mind helps maintain flavour balance, especially in dishes like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer casseroles</a> or stews.</p>  

<h3>Measuring Tools for Precision</h3>  
<p>For the most accurate results, use a liquid measuring cup with millilitre markings. If you only have standard cups, fill it to just over the 1/3 cup line to approximate 85 ml. A kitchen scale can also help—85 ml of chicken broth weighs roughly 85 grams, assuming a similar density to water.</p>

<p>1.33 cups of semolina equals approximately 10.64 ounces. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precision ensures perfect texture and consistency. Whether you’re making crispy semolina-coated chicken or a fluffy semolina cake in your air fryer, knowing the exact weight saves time and avoids mishaps.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on even heat distribution, and incorrect measurements can lead to uneven cooking or overly dense results. Semolina, a coarse flour, behaves differently than regular flour, so weighing it ensures your recipes turn out as intended. For example, if you’re making semolina-crusted fish or <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer falafel</a>, 10.64 ounces of semolina will give you the right crunch without excess coating.</p>  

<p>Many UK cooks prefer weighing ingredients for consistency, especially when adapting recipes from cups to ounces. A kitchen scale is a handy tool, but if you don’t have one, our conversion helps bridge the gap. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for other common ingredient swaps.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure Semolina Without a Scale</h3>  
<p>If you don’t own a scale, use the spoon-and-level method for dry ingredients. Gently spoon semolina into a measuring cup until it’s slightly heaped, then level it off with a knife. This avoids compacting the semolina, which could throw off your measurement. For 1.33 cups, you’ll need just over one full cup plus a third—easy to eyeball with practice.</p>  

<h2>Common Air Fryer Recipes Using Semolina</h2>  
<p>Semolina adds a delightful crunch to air-fried dishes. Try it in <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>air fryer chicken tenders</a> or as a coating for crispy vegetables. Since 1.33 cups (10.64 ounces) is a moderate amount, it’s ideal for family-sized portions. Pair it with spices or herbs for extra flavour, and always preheat your air fryer for the best results.</p>  

<p>For desserts, semolina works wonders in air-fried cakes or puddings. Its granular texture absorbs moisture evenly, preventing sogginess. If you’re experimenting, start with our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a> for tried-and-tested ideas. Cleaning your air fryer afterward? A quick wipe with <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner</a> keeps it in top shape.</p>  

<h3>Adjusting Recipes for Different Air Fryer Models</h3>  
<p>Not all air fryers cook the same way, so slight adjustments might be needed. If your model runs hot, reduce cooking time by a minute or two when using 10.64 ounces of semolina. Conversely, compact air fryers may require shaking the basket midway for even browning. Always check doneness with a skewer or thermometer.</p>

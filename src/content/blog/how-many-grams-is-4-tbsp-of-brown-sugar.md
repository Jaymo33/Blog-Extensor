<p>4 tablespoons (tbsp) of brown sugar equals approximately 50 grams (g). This conversion is essential for precise baking, especially when using an air fryer where measurements can make or break a recipe. Whether you're whipping up cookies, cakes, or glazes, knowing the exact weight ensures consistent results every time.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer baking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers cook food quickly and evenly, but they rely on precise ingredient ratios for the best texture and flavour. Too much or too little sugar can affect browning, caramelisation, and moisture levels. For example, a classic <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer cookie recipe</a> requires exact sugar measurements to achieve that perfect chewiness.</p>  
<p>Brown sugar, with its moist texture and molasses content, packs differently than granulated sugar. Scooping it directly from the bag can lead to inconsistent amounts. For reliable results, spoon the sugar into the tablespoon and level it off. If you’re scaling up a recipe, check our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for other common measurements.</p>  

<h2>How to measure brown sugar correctly</h2>  
<p>For the most accurate 4 tbsp brown sugar to grams conversion, use the spoon-and-level method. Lightly spoon the sugar into a measuring tablespoon without packing it down, then level it with a straight edge. This prevents compacting, which can add extra grams unintentionally.</p>  

<h3>Using a kitchen scale for precision</h3>  
<p>If you bake often, investing in a digital kitchen scale is a game-changer. Simply place your bowl on the scale, tare it to zero, and add brown sugar until you hit 50 grams. This method eliminates guesswork and is especially handy for <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>air fryer cakes</a>, where precision ensures even rising.</p>  

<h2>Common recipes using 4 tbsp of brown sugar</h2>  
<p>Many air fryer desserts call for this amount, such as cinnamon rolls, crumbles, or sticky glazes. For instance, a quick <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>air fryer apple crisp</a> might use 4 tbsp brown sugar for the topping. Always double-check your recipe’s requirements, as some brands specify weight instead of volume.</p>  
<p>If you’re adapting a traditional oven recipe for the air fryer, remember that sugar can caramelise faster due to the concentrated heat. You might need to slightly reduce the amount or adjust cooking times. For more tips, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/>air fryer recipe collection</a>.</p>  

<h3>Storing brown sugar for consistent measurements</h3>  
<p>Keep brown sugar in an airtight container to prevent hardening. If it clumps, revive it with a slice of bread or a quick zap in the microwave. Hardened sugar can throw off your 4 tbsp brown sugar in grams measurement, leading to dense baked goods.</p>

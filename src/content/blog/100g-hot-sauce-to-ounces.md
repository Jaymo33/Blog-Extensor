<p>100g of hot sauce equals approximately 3.53 ounces. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes, where precise measurements can make or break a dish. Whether you’re marinating chicken or adding a kick to roasted vegetables, knowing how to convert grams to ounces ensures consistency. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we help simplify cooking conversions so you can focus on flavour. Let’s dive deeper into why this measurement matters and how to use it in your air fryer.</p>  

<h2>Why convert 100g of hot sauce to ounces?</h2>  
<p>Many UK recipes use grams, while others reference ounces, especially when adapting international dishes. Converting 100g of hot sauce to ounces (3.53 oz) ensures accuracy, whether you’re following a recipe or experimenting. Hot sauce density can vary, but this standard conversion works for most bottled sauces. For air fryer cooking, precise measurements help avoid overly spicy or bland results. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more handy tips.</p>  

<p>Using the right amount of hot sauce is crucial for balanced flavours. Too little, and your dish lacks depth; too much, and it overpowers other ingredients. The air fryer’s intense heat can amplify spiciness, so measuring correctly is key. If you’re meal prepping, converting 100g to ounces helps batch cooking. Visit our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipes section</a> for inspiration on using hot sauce in air fryer dishes.</p>  

<h3>How to measure 100g of hot sauce without scales</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have digital scales, use a measuring jug marked in millilitres. Most hot sauces have a similar density to water, so 100g is roughly 100ml. For ounces, this translates to about 3.5 fluid ounces. A standard UK tablespoon holds around 15ml, so 6.5 tablespoons will give you roughly 100g. Remember, thicker sauces like sriracha may vary slightly. For precise air fryer recipes, scales are best.</p>  

<h2>Using 100g of hot sauce in air fryer recipes</h2>  
<p>Hot sauce adds depth to air-fried chicken wings, tofu, or even roasted veggies. Marinating with 100g (3.53 oz) of sauce ensures even coating without excess drips. For crispy results, pat dry excess sauce before air frying. Spicy air fryer dishes like buffalo cauliflower or glazed shrimp benefit from accurate measurements. Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipes</a> for ideas on incorporating hot sauce.</p>  

<p>Cleaning your air fryer after using sticky hot sauce? A mix of baking soda and water works wonders. Check our guide on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaning</a> for hassle-free maintenance. Hot sauce residues can build up, so regular cleaning ensures longevity. For vegetarian options, try our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/tofu>tofu recipes</a> with a 100g hot sauce glaze.</p>  

<h3>Common hot sauce brands and their weights</h3>  
<p>Popular UK brands like Encona or Tabasco often list weights in grams. A standard 150ml bottle contains about 150g, so 100g is roughly two-thirds of the bottle. For smaller batches, use our 100g-to-ounces conversion to adjust recipes. Store opened hot sauce in the fridge to maintain freshness. Air fryer meals like spicy drumsticks or glazed salmon shine with perfectly measured heat.</p>

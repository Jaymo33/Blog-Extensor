<p>60 ml of single cream equals approximately 0.25 cups (or 1/4 cup). This conversion is essential for precise baking and cooking, especially when using an air fryer where measurements matter. Whether you're whipping up a creamy sauce or a delicate dessert, knowing how to convert millilitres to cups ensures consistency in your dishes.</p>  

<h2>Understanding the Conversion</h2>  
<p>Converting 60 ml of single cream to cups is straightforward once you know the ratio. In the UK and US, 1 cup equals 240 ml, meaning 60 ml is a quarter of that. This measurement is particularly useful for air fryer recipes, where exact quantities can affect texture and taste. For more conversions, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>  

<p>Single cream is a staple in many recipes, from soups to desserts. If you're using an air fryer for dishes like creamy pasta or custards, accurate measurements ensure the right consistency. Visit <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>our recipe collection</a> for inspiration on how to incorporate single cream into your meals.</p>  

<h3>Why Precision Matters in Air Fryer Cooking</h3>  
<p>Air fryers rely on even heat distribution, so ingredient ratios are crucial. Too much or too little single cream can alter the dish's moisture and texture. For example, a quiche with 60 ml of single cream (0.25 cups) will set perfectly, while excess cream might make it soggy.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for 60 ml of Single Cream</h2>  
<p>Single cream is versatile, whether you're making sauces, desserts, or even coffee. In air fryer cooking, it's often used in recipes like creamy garlic mushrooms or custard tarts. For a delicious <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert recipe</a>, try incorporating 60 ml of single cream into a light mousse.</p>  

<p>If you're preparing a savoury dish, such as a creamy chicken bake, 60 ml of single cream adds richness without overpowering the flavours. Pair it with our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipes</a> for a satisfying meal. Remember, precise measurements ensure the best results.</p>  

<h3>Measuring Without a Cup</h3>  
<p>No measuring cup? No problem. A standard tablespoon holds about 15 ml, so four tablespoons equal 60 ml (0.25 cups). This hack is handy for quick adjustments, especially when using an air fryer for last-minute dishes.</p>  

<h2>Tips for Storing Single Cream</h2>  
<p>Once opened, single cream should be refrigerated and used within a few days. If your recipe calls for 60 ml, measure it out and store the rest properly. For more kitchen tips, explore our guide on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>keeping your air fryer clean</a>.</p>  

<p>Single cream can also be frozen, though it may separate slightly when thawed. If you frequently use small amounts like 60 ml, consider portioning it before freezing. This ensures you always have the right quantity for your air fryer recipes.</p>  

<h3>Converting Other Cream Types</h3>  
<p>Double cream or whipping cream has different densities, so 60 ml won't equal 0.25 cups. Always check specific conversions for these variants to avoid recipe mishaps.

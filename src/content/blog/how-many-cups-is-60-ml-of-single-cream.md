<p>60 ml of single cream equals approximately 0.25 cups (or 1/4 cup). This conversion is essential for precise baking and cooking, especially when using an air fryer where measurements matter.

This measurement is particularly useful for air fryer recipes, where exact quantities can affect texture and taste.

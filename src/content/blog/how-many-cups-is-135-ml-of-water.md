<p>135 ml of water equals approximately 0.57 cups (or just over half a cup) in standard US measurements. For UK cup measurements, it’s roughly 0.48 cups due to slight variations in cup sizes. Whether you’re preparing air fryer recipes or baking, knowing this conversion ensures accuracy in your cooking. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we help simplify kitchen measurements so you can focus on creating delicious meals.</p>

<h2>Understanding 135 ml of Water in Cups</h2>  
<p>Converting 135 ml of water to cups is straightforward once you know the standard measurements. In the US, 1 cup equals 240 ml, so 135 ml is roughly 0.57 cups. In the UK, where 1 cup is 284 ml, 135 ml translates to about 0.48 cups. This difference matters when following recipes, especially for air fryer cooking where precision affects texture and doneness. Always check whether your recipe uses US or UK measurements to avoid mishaps.</p>  

<p>For air fryer enthusiasts, accurate liquid measurements are crucial. Too much or too little water can alter cooking times and results. If you’re adapting a recipe from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>our collection</a>, this conversion ensures your dishes turn out perfectly. Whether you’re making sauces, marinades, or baking, knowing how many cups 135 ml of water is will save you time and guesswork.</p>  

<h3>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h3>  
<p>Air fryers rely on precise ingredient ratios for even cooking and crispy results. Adding 135 ml of water instead of the correct cup measurement could lead to soggy or undercooked food. For example, when making air fryer cakes or steamed dishes, the right liquid balance is key. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a> helps you adjust measurements effortlessly, so your meals are consistently delicious.</p>  

<h2>Converting 135 ml of Water for Baking and Cooking</h2>  
<p>Baking is a science, and liquid measurements like 135 ml of water must be spot-on. If a recipe calls for half a cup (US) and you use 135 ml, you’re nearly there but may need a slight adjustment. For UK bakers, 135 ml is just under half a cup, so adding a teaspoon more might be necessary. This precision ensures your air fryer brownies or breads rise properly and taste great.</p>  

<p>When cooking savory dishes like air fryer soups or stews, 135 ml of water can be the difference between a thick or watery consistency. Referencing our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable recipes</a>, you’ll see how liquid measurements impact the final dish. Measuring cups with ml markings are handy, but if you only have standard cups, this conversion will guide you.</p>  

<h3>Tools for Measuring 135 ml of Water</h3>  
<p>A kitchen scale or liquid measuring cup is ideal for measuring 135 ml of water accurately. If using cups, fill to just over halfway for US cups or slightly less for UK cups. For air fryer recipes, consistency is key, so investing in a good measuring jug pays off.

For example, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/breakfast>breakfast recipes</a> might use this amount for perfect porridge or egg dishes.

<h2>Why measure cooked rice in grams?</h2>
<p>Measuring cooked rice in grams provides accuracy, especially for air fryer recipes where portion sizes matter. Unlike volume measurements, weight isn’t affected by how tightly packed the rice is. This makes it easier to follow recipes precisely, whether you're cooking for one or meal prepping for the week. If you love rice-based dishes, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> for inspiration.</p>

<p>Grams are the standard unit in most UK recipes, so converting tablespoons to grams eliminates guesswork. This is particularly useful for tracking macros or adjusting serving sizes. Plus, weighing ingredients helps achieve perfect texture in air-fried dishes like crispy rice cakes or stuffed vegetables.</p>

<h2>How to measure 3 tbsp of cooked rice</h2>
<p>To measure 3 tbsp of cooked rice, use a standard UK tablespoon (15ml) and lightly fill it without packing. Level off the top with a knife for an accurate measurement. If you have a kitchen scale, weigh the rice directly for the most precise result. For more tips on air fryer cooking, visit <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>.</p>

<h3>Does rice type affect the weight?</h3>
<p>Yes, different rice varieties can slightly alter the weight per tablespoon. For example, 3 tbsp of fluffy basmati rice might weigh around 42 grams, while stickier short-grain rice could be closer to 48 grams. However, 45 grams is a reliable average for most common types like white or brown rice.</p>

<h2>Converting other rice measurements</h2>
<p>If your recipe calls for a different amount, here are some handy conversions: 1 tbsp of cooked rice equals about 15 grams, while 1/4 cup (4 tbsp) is roughly 60 grams. These conversions work well for air fryer dishes like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable-stuffed rice</a> or crispy rice balls.</p>

<p>For larger quantities, 100 grams of cooked rice equals approximately 6.5 tablespoons. This helps when scaling recipes up or down. Remember that rice expands during cooking, so always measure after it’s prepared for accurate results in your air fryer creations.</p>

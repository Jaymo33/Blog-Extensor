<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Using the correct amount of chicken broth can make or break a recipe. Too little, and your dish may lack flavour; too much, and it could become watery. Air fryer recipes, in particular, rely on precise liquid ratios to achieve the right texture. For example, a creamy chicken casserole needs just the right amount of broth to stay moist without becoming soggy.

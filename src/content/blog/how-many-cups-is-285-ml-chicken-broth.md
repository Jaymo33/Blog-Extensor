<p>285 ml of chicken broth equals approximately 1.2 cups in the US or 1.14 cups in the UK. This conversion is essential for recipes requiring precise liquid measurements, especially when using an air fryer. Whether you're making soups, stews, or sauces, knowing how to convert millilitres to cups ensures your dish turns out perfectly every time. For more air fryer-friendly recipes, visit <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes</a>.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Using the correct amount of chicken broth can make or break a recipe. Too little, and your dish may lack flavour; too much, and it could become watery. Air fryer recipes, in particular, rely on precise liquid ratios to achieve the right texture. For example, a creamy chicken casserole needs just the right amount of broth to stay moist without becoming soggy. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more measurement tips.</p>  

<p>In baking, accuracy is even more critical. A slight variation in liquid measurements can affect the rise and consistency of bread or cakes. Whether you're following a UK or US recipe, knowing that 285 ml of chicken broth equals roughly 1.2 cups (US) or 1.14 cups (UK) helps avoid mishaps. For delicious air fryer baking ideas, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>cake recipes</a>.</p>  

<h3>US vs. UK Cup Measurements</h3>  
<p>The difference between US and UK cup sizes is small but important. A US cup holds 240 ml, while a UK cup holds 250 ml. This means 285 ml of chicken broth is slightly more in a UK cup (1.14 cups) compared to a US cup (1.2 cups). Always check which measurement system your recipe uses to ensure accuracy.

<h2>How to Measure 285 ml of Chicken Broth Without a Scale</h2>  
<p>If you don't have a measuring jug, you can use standard kitchen tools to estimate 285 ml of chicken broth. A standard US measuring cup holds 240 ml, so fill it to just above the 1-cup line. Alternatively, use a tablespoon (15 ml) – 19 tablespoons will give you roughly 285 ml. For precise air fryer cooking, we recommend using a digital scale or jug. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning guide</a> to keep your tools in top shape.</p>  

<p>Another handy trick is to use a can or carton as a reference. Many store-bought chicken broths come in 284 ml or 285 ml servings, making them perfect for recipes calling for this amount. Just pour the entire contents for an accurate measurement. For more kitchen hacks, browse our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipes</a>.</p>  

<h3>Common Recipes Using 285 ml of Chicken Broth</h3>  
<p>Many air fryer recipes call for 285 ml of chicken broth, including creamy pasta dishes, risottos, and marinades. This measurement is ideal for adding moisture without overpowering other flavours. Try it in a garlic butter chicken traybake or a hearty vegetable stew. For inspiration, visit <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>.</p>

<p>135 ml of honey is roughly equivalent to 0.57 cups (just over half a cup). This conversion is essential for precise baking and cooking, especially when using an air fryer where measurements can impact texture and cooking times. Whether you're whipping up a glaze or sweetening a marinade, knowing how to convert 135 ml of honey to cups ensures consistent results.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Honey Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Honey is denser than water, so volume conversions aren’t always straightforward. Using too much or too little can alter the taste and texture of your dish. For air fryer recipes, precise measurements help avoid overly sticky or dry results. If you’re following a recipe from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, getting the honey measurement right ensures your dish turns out as intended.</p>  

<p>Many baking recipes, like cakes or cookies, rely on honey for moisture and sweetness. A slight miscalculation can lead to uneven baking or overly dense textures. For savoury dishes, such as glazes for chicken or salmon, the right amount of honey balances flavours perfectly. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more handy measurement tips.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure 135 ml of Honey Without a Scale</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a kitchen scale, use a liquid measuring cup for accuracy. Pour the honey slowly to avoid air bubbles, and level it off with a spatula. For sticky ingredients like honey, lightly greasing the measuring cup helps it slide out easily. This method ensures you get the correct 135 ml of honey (0.57 cups) every time.</p>  

<h2>Converting Honey for Different Recipes</h2>  
<p>Honey measurements vary depending on the recipe type. For air fryer desserts like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>cakes</a>, 135 ml of honey adds moisture without making the batter too wet. In marinades for meats or <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken</a>, it caramelises beautifully under high heat. Always adjust other liquid ingredients slightly to account for honey’s thickness.</p>  

<p>When substituting honey for sugar, remember it’s sweeter, so you may need less. For 135 ml of honey, reduce other liquids by about 2 tablespoons to maintain balance. This tip is especially useful for air fryer baking, where excess moisture can lead to soggy results. Explore more <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> guides for foolproof conversions.</p>  

<h3>Common Mistakes When Measuring Honey</h3>  
<p>One mistake is not accounting for honey’s stickiness, which can leave residue in measuring tools. Always use warm water to rinse utensils immediately. Another error is eyeballing measurements—135 ml of honey should be precisely 0.57 cups for consistency. For sticky ingredients, a silicone spatula ensures you get every last drop without waste.</p>  

<h2>Honey Conversions for UK vs. US Cups</h2>  
<p>In the UK, a standard cup is 250 ml, while in the US, it’s 240 ml. For 135 ml of honey, the difference is minimal (0.54 UK cups vs. 0.57 US cups), but it’s worth noting for precision. Most <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> recipes use metric measurements, so stick to ml unless specified otherwise.</p>  

<p>If a recipe calls for cups and you’ve measured in ml, round 135 ml to ½ cup plus 1 tablespoon for simplicity. This small adjustment ensures your air fryer dishes turn out perfectly every time.

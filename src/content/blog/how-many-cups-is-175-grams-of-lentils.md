<p>175 grams of lentils is roughly equivalent to 0.88 cups (just under 1 cup). This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes, ensuring accurate measurements for perfectly cooked lentils every time. Whether you're meal prepping or experimenting with new dishes, knowing how to convert grams to cups can make cooking simpler.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Lentil Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of lentils ensures your air fryer dishes turn out just right. Too many lentils can lead to uneven cooking, while too few might leave your meal lacking in texture. For recipes like air-fried lentil patties or crispy spiced lentils, precision is key. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we recommend measuring lentils by weight for consistency, but cup conversions are handy when scales aren’t available.</p>  

<p>Different types of lentils (red, green, or brown) have slight variations in density, but 175 grams generally translates to just under a cup. If you’re using pre-cooked or soaked lentils, the volume will differ slightly. For more air fryer-friendly recipes, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipes section</a>.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure Lentils Without a Scale</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a kitchen scale, use the spoon-and-level method for dry lentils. Fill your measuring cup loosely, then level it off with a straight edge. Avoid packing the lentils down, as this can lead to an inaccurate measurement. For 175 grams, aim for just under a full cup, or use a 3/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons for better precision.</p>  

<h2>Converting Grams to Cups for Different Lentil Types</h2>  
<p>While 175 grams of most lentils equals roughly 0.88 cups, red lentils may measure slightly more due to their smaller size. Brown and green lentils are denser, so they’ll fit snugly in a cup. If you’re adapting a recipe from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable-based dishes</a>, always double-check the type of lentils specified.</p>  

<p>For baking or binding ingredients (like lentil burgers), slight variations won’t ruin your dish. However, for soups or stews cooked in the air fryer, sticking close to 175 grams ensures the right texture. Need more conversions? Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> has you covered.</p>  

<h3>Common Mistakes When Measuring Lentils</h3>  
<p>One frequent error is using a liquid measuring cup for dry lentils, which can lead to overflow or under-measuring. Always use dry measuring cups for accuracy. Another pitfall is forgetting to account for lentil expansion during cooking—175 grams of dry lentils will yield about 2.5 cups once cooked.</p>  

<h2>Using 175 Grams of Lentils in Air Fryer Recipes</h2>  
<p>175 grams of lentils works perfectly for crispy air-fried snacks or protein-packed sides. Try tossing cooked lentils with olive oil and spices, then air-frying at 180°C for 10 minutes for a crunchy topping. For heartier meals, mix 175 grams of lentils with breadcrumbs and shape into patties—ideal for <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/meal-prep>meal prep</a>.</p>  

<p>If you’re new to air frying lentils, start with smaller batches to avoid overcrowding. Overcrowding can lead to uneven crisping, so spread them in a single layer.

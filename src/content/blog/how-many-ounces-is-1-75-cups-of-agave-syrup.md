<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on even heat distribution, and incorrect ingredient quantities can throw off cooking times. Too much agave syrup, for instance, may cause excessive caramelisation or burning. Conversely, too little can leave your dish lacking flavour. By converting 1.75 cups of agave syrup to ounces (14 oz), you ensure balanced sweetness and texture.

<p>Agave syrup is denser than water, so volume-to-weight conversions differ from liquids like milk. This makes weighing ingredients like agave syrup especially important. A kitchen scale eliminates guesswork, but if you don’t have one, our conversion guides are here to help. For more tips on perfecting air fryer recipes, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a>. From glazes to marinades, accurate measurements elevate every dish.</p>  

<h2>How to measure agave syrup without a scale</h2>  
<p>If you don’t own a kitchen scale, use measuring cups designed for sticky liquids. Lightly coat the cup with oil to help the syrup slide out cleanly. Fill it to the 1.75-cup mark, then level it off with a spatula. Remember, 1.75 cups of agave syrup translates to 14 ounces. For sticky ingredients like this, a silicone spatula ensures you get every last drop. Visit <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> for more measurement hacks.</p>

Its mild flavour won’t overpower other ingredients, making it a versatile pantry staple. Since 1.75 cups equals 14 ounces, you can easily adjust recipes to suit your taste.

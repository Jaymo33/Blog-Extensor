<h2>Why Accurate Flour Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Using the correct amount of flour is crucial for air fryer recipes. Too much flour can make baked goods dense, while too little may cause them to crumble.

<p>Measuring by weight (ounces or grams) is more reliable than volume (cups) because flour can settle or become compacted. A kitchen scale is your best friend here. If you don’t have one, fluff the flour with a spoon before lightly spooning it into the measuring cup. Avoid tapping or packing it down, as this can lead to over-measuring.</p>  

<h2>How to Convert 1.25 Cups of Plain Flour to Ounces</h2>

<h3>Using a Kitchen Scale for Precision</h3>

If you’re baking cakes or bread, precision is especially important for the right rise and texture.</p>

<h3>Adjusting Recipes for Different Flours</h3>

Always check the packaging or use a scale to confirm.

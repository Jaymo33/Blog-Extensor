<h2>Why Accurate Olive Oil Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of olive oil in your air fryer recipes ensures even cooking and prevents dryness or sogginess. Too much oil can make food greasy, while too little may lead to uneven browning. For example, when making air-fried vegetables or chicken, 300 grams of olive oil in cups translates to roughly 1.3 cups, depending on your region’s cup size. This precision helps maintain the perfect texture and flavour.

<p>Different recipes may call for grams or cups, so knowing how to switch between them is a game-changer. If you're preparing a marinade or dressing, 300g of olive oil in cups ensures you don’t overpour. This is especially useful for baking, where exact ratios matter. Whether you're following a British or American recipe, our guide helps you adapt measurements effortlessly.</p>

<h2>How to Measure 300 Grams of Olive Oil Without Scales</h2>

Olive oil’s density means it won’t settle like flour, so you can rely on volume measurements in a pinch. For best results, use a clear measuring cup on a flat surface and check at eye level.</p>

<p>3 cups of marmalade equals approximately 24 ounces. This conversion is essential for precise baking or cooking, especially when using an air fryer where measurements can impact texture and cooking times. Whether you're making glazes, desserts, or sauces, knowing the exact weight ensures consistency in your recipes.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on even heat distribution, and incorrect ingredient quantities can lead to uneven cooking or soggy results. Marmalade, with its sticky consistency, needs precise measurement to avoid over-sweetening or altering the dish's moisture balance. For perfect air-fried treats, always measure ingredients like marmalade by weight when possible.</p>  
<p>If you're adapting a recipe from cups to ounces, a kitchen scale is your best friend. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for other common ingredient conversions. This ensures your air fryer recipes turn out just right every time.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure Marmalade Correctly</h3>  
<p>To measure 3 cups of marmalade accurately, use a liquid measuring cup for sticky ingredients. Lightly grease the cup to help the marmalade slide out easily. For weight, 1 cup of marmalade typically weighs around 8 ounces, so 3 cups would be 24 ounces.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for 3 Cups of Marmalade in Air Fryer Recipes</h2>  
<p>Marmalade isn't just for toast—it's a versatile ingredient in air fryer cooking. Use 3 cups (24 ounces) to glaze meats like chicken or ham, create sticky desserts, or even as a base for sauces. Its natural sweetness and citrus notes add depth to both sweet and savoury dishes.</p>  
<p>For inspiration, browse our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> section, where marmalade features in everything from glazed salmon to citrus-infused cakes. The right measurement ensures balanced flavours and perfect results.</p>  

<h3>Converting Marmalade Measurements for UK Cooks</h3>  
<p>In the UK, recipes often use grams or millilitres, but ounces are still common for weight. If your recipe calls for 3 cups of marmalade (24 ounces), this equals roughly 680 grams. Always double-check conversions to avoid recipe mishaps.</p>  

<h2>Tips for Storing Leftover Marmalade</h2>  
<p>If you've measured out 3 cups of marmalade but don't need it all, proper storage keeps it fresh. Transfer leftovers to an airtight container and refrigerate for up to a month. For longer storage, freeze portions in ice cube trays for easy future use.</p>  
<p>Keep your air fryer in top condition too—check our guide on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning your air fryer</a> to prevent sticky residues from marmalade or other ingredients.</p>  

<h3>Adjusting Recipes for Different Marmalade Types</h3>  
<p>Thick-cut marmalade may weigh slightly more than smooth varieties due to added peel. If precision is crucial, weigh your marmalade after measuring to confirm it's 24 ounces (3 cups). This is especially helpful for baking recipes where texture matters.</p>

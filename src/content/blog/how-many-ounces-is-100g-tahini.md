<h2>Why accurate tahini measurements matter</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of tahini can elevate your air fryer dishes, from crispy falafel to creamy sauces. Too much tahini can make recipes overly dense, while too little might leave them lacking depth. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we emphasise precision for consistent results. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> simplifies these calculations, so you never have to guess.</p>  

<p>Tahini’s thick consistency means weight measurements (like grams) are more reliable than volume (like cups or tablespoons). A digital kitchen scale is your best friend here. If you’re adapting a recipe from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>our collection</a>, converting 100g of tahini to ounces ensures you stay on track.</p>  

<h3>How to measure tahini without a scale</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a scale, 100g of tahini is roughly 6 level tablespoons. However, this can vary slightly depending on the brand and how tightly packed it is. For air fryer recipes where balance is key, like our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>tahini-marinated chicken</a>, weighing is always preferable.</p>

<h3>Storing tahini for freshness</h3>

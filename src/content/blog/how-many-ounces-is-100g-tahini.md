<p>100g of tahini equals approximately 3.53 ounces. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements can make all the difference in texture and flavour. Whether you’re making dips, dressings, or marinades, knowing how to convert 100g tahini to ounces ensures your dishes turn out perfectly every time.</p>

<h2>Why accurate tahini measurements matter</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of tahini can elevate your air fryer dishes, from crispy falafel to creamy sauces. Too much tahini can make recipes overly dense, while too little might leave them lacking depth. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we emphasise precision for consistent results. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> simplifies these calculations, so you never have to guess.</p>  

<p>Tahini’s thick consistency means weight measurements (like grams) are more reliable than volume (like cups or tablespoons). A digital kitchen scale is your best friend here. If you’re adapting a recipe from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>our collection</a>, converting 100g of tahini to ounces ensures you stay on track.</p>  

<h3>How to measure tahini without a scale</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a scale, 100g of tahini is roughly 6 level tablespoons. However, this can vary slightly depending on the brand and how tightly packed it is. For air fryer recipes where balance is key, like our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>tahini-marinated chicken</a>, weighing is always preferable.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for tahini in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Tahini isn’t just for hummus—it’s a versatile ingredient that adds richness to air-fried vegetables, meats, and even desserts. A 100g tahini to ounces conversion helps when drizzling it over roasted cauliflower or mixing it into marinades. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable recipes</a> for inspiration.</p>  

<p>Many tahini-based sauces benefit from the air fryer’s quick cooking time. For example, a glaze made with 100g tahini (3.53 oz) caramelises beautifully on salmon or tofu. Just remember to clean your air fryer basket afterward—our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning guide</a> makes it effortless.</p>  

<h3>Storing tahini for freshness</h3>  
<p>Once opened, tahini can separate or harden if not stored properly. Keep it in an airtight container in the fridge, and give it a good stir before measuring out your 100g (3.53 oz) portions. This ensures consistent texture and flavour in every dish.</p>

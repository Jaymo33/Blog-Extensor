<p>475 grams of cream is roughly equivalent to 2 cups in both UK and US measurements. However, slight variations can occur depending on the cream's density and fat content. For precise baking or cooking, especially in an air fryer, accurate conversions ensure perfect results every time.</p>

<h2>Understanding Cream Measurements</h2>  
<p>When converting grams to cups, it's essential to consider the type of cream you're using. Single cream, double cream, and whipping cream all have different densities, which can slightly alter the conversion. For most standard creams, 475 grams will equal approximately 2 cups. This measurement is handy for recipes on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, ensuring your dishes turn out just right.</p>  

<p>Using a kitchen scale is the most accurate method, but if you don't have one, measuring cups work well too. Just remember to spoon the cream into the cup and level it off for consistency. This method is particularly useful when preparing air fryer desserts or sauces where precision matters.</p>  

<h3>UK vs. US Cup Measurements</h3>  
<p>While 475 grams of cream equals about 2 cups in both the UK and US, the actual volume can differ slightly due to varying cup sizes. A UK cup holds 250ml, whereas a US cup is 240ml. For most recipes, this small difference won’t impact the outcome, but it’s good to be aware of when following international recipes.</p>

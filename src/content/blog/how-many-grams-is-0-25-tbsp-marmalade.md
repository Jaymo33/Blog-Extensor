<h2>Why accurate marmalade measurements matter</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of marmalade can make or break your air fryer dish. Too little, and you miss the flavour; too much, and it can become overly sticky or burn. Marmalade’s sugar content means it caramelises quickly, so 0.25 tbsp (or 3.75 grams) is often ideal for glazes or marinades. If you're preparing a <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipe</a>, this measurement ensures a glossy finish without excess sugar.

<p>Marmalade’s thickness varies by brand, but 0.25 tbsp generally weighs around 3.75 grams. For thicker varieties, you might need to warm it slightly for easier measuring. A kitchen scale is your best friend here, especially when scaling recipes.

<h3>How to measure 0.25 tbsp of marmalade without scales</h3>

Remember, 1 UK tablespoon is 15ml, so 0.25 tbsp is roughly 3.75ml. This method works well for small quantities, but for larger batches, weighing is more reliable.

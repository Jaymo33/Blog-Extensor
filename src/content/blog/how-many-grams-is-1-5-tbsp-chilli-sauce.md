<p>1.5 tablespoons (tbsp) of chilli sauce equals approximately 22.5 grams (g) in UK measurements. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precision matters, ensuring your dishes have the perfect balance of heat and flavour. Whether you’re whipping up a spicy marinade or adding a kick to your air-fried wings, knowing the exact weight helps avoid over or under-seasoning.

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on even heat distribution, so using the right amount of ingredients ensures consistent results. Too much chilli sauce can make your dish overly spicy or cause uneven cooking, while too little might leave it bland. Converting 1.5 tbsp of chilli sauce to grams (22.5g) helps you follow recipes precisely, especially when scaling up or down. If you love spicy food, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipes</a> for delicious ways to use chilli sauce.</p>  

<p>Many UK cooks prefer weighing ingredients for accuracy, as tablespoon measurements can vary slightly. A digital kitchen scale is a handy tool for air fryer enthusiasts, ensuring your 1.5 tbsp of chilli sauce is perfectly measured every time.

<h3>How to measure chilli sauce without scales</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have scales, use a standard UK tablespoon (15ml) to measure 1.5 tbsp of chilli sauce. Fill it level, not heaped, for accuracy. Remember, thicker sauces like chilli may weigh slightly more than thinner liquids, so 22.5g is a reliable average. For more measurement hacks, visit our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion guide</a>.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for 1.5 tbsp of chilli sauce in air fryer recipes</h2>

Try it in our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/shrimp>spicy shrimp recipes</a> for a quick, flavourful meal. Since air fryers cook faster than ovens, the 22.5g measurement ensures the sauce caramelises without burning.</p>  

<p>You can also mix 1.5 tbsp (22.5g) of chilli sauce with honey or soy sauce for a balanced glaze. For cleaning sticky air fryer baskets after saucy recipes, <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>our cleaner guide</a> has you covered.</p>

Whether you're making a marinade, soup, or sauce, knowing how to convert millilitres to cups ensures consistent results every time.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>

For recipes requiring precision, like those in our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipe category</a>, measuring tools are best.</p>

<p>2 tablespoons (tbsp) of self-raising flour weigh approximately 18 grams in UK measurements. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements can make or break your baking results. Whether you're whipping up cakes, muffins, or bread in your air fryer, knowing this conversion ensures perfect texture every time.</p>

<h2>Why accurate flour measurements matter in air fryer baking</h2>
<p>Air fryers circulate hot air rapidly, which means baking times and ingredient ratios need extra precision. Using too much or too little self-raising flour can affect rise and texture. For example, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer cake recipes</a> rely on this 2 tbsp to 18g conversion for consistent results. Digital scales are more accurate than volume measurements, but tablespoon conversions remain popular for quick recipes.</p>
<p>Self-raising flour contains baking powder already mixed in, typically at a ratio of 1 teaspoon per 150g of plain flour. When converting 2 tbsp to grams, you're accounting for this leavening agent too. This differs from plain flour conversions, making it crucial to use the right measurement for your <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>

<h3>How to measure 2 tbsp of self-raising flour accurately</h3>
<p>For the most precise 18g measurement, spoon flour lightly into your tablespoon without packing or tapping. Level off the excess with a straight edge. Scooping directly from the bag compacts the flour, potentially adding 2-3 extra grams. If you're adapting a <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>cake recipe</a> for the air fryer, this small difference could affect your bake's rise.</p>

<h2>Converting other flour amounts in air fryer recipes</h2>
<p>Once you know 2 tbsp equals 18g, you can scale up or down for different recipe quantities. Four tablespoons would be 36g, while half a tablespoon would be 9g. Many <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> baking recipes use this base measurement for small-batch air fryer bakes. Remember that humidity and flour brand can cause slight variations, so for critical recipes, weighing is always best.</p>
<p>If your air fryer recipe calls for cups of self-raising flour, note that 1 UK cup equals approximately 150g. This helps when converting American recipes that use volume measurements. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion resources</a> include these common baking measurements specifically for air fryer users.</p>

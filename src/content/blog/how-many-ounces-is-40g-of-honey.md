Whether you're glazing chicken wings or sweetening baked goods, knowing how to convert 40g honey to ounces ensures consistent results every time.</p>

<h2>Why accurate honey measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>
<p>Air fryers circulate hot air rapidly, which means ingredients cook faster and more intensely than traditional methods. When working with sticky substances like honey, even small measurement errors can lead to over-sweetening or uneven caramelisation. Our conversion chart at <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> helps eliminate guesswork for perfect results.</p>
<p>Many UK air fryer enthusiasts prefer weighing ingredients in grams, while some recipes still use imperial measurements.

This precision becomes crucial when preparing delicate dishes like honey-glazed salmon or sticky tofu from our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/salmon>salmon recipe collection</a>.</p>

<h3>The simplest method to convert 40g honey to oz</h3>

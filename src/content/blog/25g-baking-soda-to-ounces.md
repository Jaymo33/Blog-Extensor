<p>25g of baking soda equals approximately 0.88 ounces. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements can make or break your dish. Whether you’re whipping up crispy treats or fluffy cakes, knowing how to convert grams to ounces ensures consistency. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we help you nail every recipe with accurate conversions and expert tips.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer baking</h2>  
<p>Baking soda is a leavening agent, and even small measurement errors can affect texture and rise. Too much can leave a bitter taste, while too little may result in dense baked goods. Air fryers cook food faster than conventional ovens, so precision is key. For perfect results, always measure ingredients like baking soda carefully. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more handy measurement guides.</p>  

<p>Many UK recipes use grams, but some cooks prefer ounces for familiarity. Converting 25g of baking soda to ounces (0.88 oz) ensures you follow recipes accurately. Digital scales often toggle between units, making it easy to switch. If you’re using cups, note that baking soda’s density means volume measurements can vary. For foolproof baking, stick to weight measurements where possible.</p>  

<h3>How to measure 25g of baking soda without a scale</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a scale, 25g of baking soda is roughly 5 teaspoons. However, spooning methods can be inconsistent due to settling or packing. For best results, fluff the baking soda first, then lightly spoon it into a measuring spoon. Level it off with a knife for accuracy. Remember, this method is less precise than weighing, so invest in a scale for reliable results.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for 25g of baking soda in air fryer recipes</h2>  
<p>Baking soda isn’t just for cakes—it’s a versatile ingredient in air fryer cooking. From crispy fried chicken to fluffy doughnuts, 25g can go a long way. It helps create a golden crust on foods like onion rings or tempura. You’ll also find it in savoury recipes, such as homemade pretzels or spiced nuts. Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> for inspiration on using baking soda creatively.</p>  

<p>Beyond cooking, baking soda is handy for cleaning your air fryer. A paste made with 25g of baking soda and water can tackle stubborn grease.

<h3>Converting other baking ingredients from grams to ounces</h3>  
<p>While 25g of baking soda is 0.88 ounces, other ingredients differ due to density. For example, 25g of flour equals about 0.88 ounces, but 25g of sugar is closer to 0.88 ounces.

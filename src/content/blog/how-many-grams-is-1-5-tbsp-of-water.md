<p>1.5 tablespoons (tbsp) of water equals approximately 22.5 grams (g). This conversion is essential for precise measurements in air fryer recipes, where accuracy can make or break your dish. Whether you’re preparing a marinade, batter, or sauce, knowing the exact weight of water ensures consistency.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on even heat distribution, and incorrect liquid measurements can affect texture and cooking times. Too much water might steam your food instead of crisping it, while too little could dry it out. For perfect results, always measure liquids like water accurately. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more handy measurement tips.</p>  

<p>Many air fryer recipes, especially those for cakes or batters, require precise liquid ratios. If a recipe calls for 1.5 tbsp of water, using the correct gram measurement ensures the right consistency. This is particularly important for baked goods, where even small deviations can lead to dense or dry results.</p>  

<h3>How to measure 1.5 tbsp of water accurately</h3>  
<p>For the most precise measurement, use a digital kitchen scale. Place your container on the scale, tare it to zero, then add water until it reaches 22.5 grams. If you don’t have a scale, use a UK-standard tablespoon (15ml per tbsp) and fill it 1.5 times. Avoid heaping or underfilled spoons for best accuracy.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for 1.5 tbsp of water in air fryer recipes</h2>  
<p>This small amount of water is often used in marinades, glazes, or to thin out sauces. For example, a simple glaze for air-fried chicken might combine 1.5 tbsp of water with honey and soy sauce. You can also use it to revive leftovers – a light spritz of water before reheating helps prevent dryness.</p>

<h3>Converting other liquid measurements for your air fryer</h3>  
<p>While we’ve focused on 1.5 tbsp of water, you might need to convert other liquids too. Most liquids have similar densities to water, so these conversions work for oils, milk, or stock in small quantities. For larger amounts, check specific conversion charts as densities vary.</p>  

<h2>Tips for working with water in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>When adding water to air fryer recipes, distribute it evenly. For example, if making air fryer steamed buns, brush 1.5 tbsp of water lightly over the surface rather than pouring it in one spot. This prevents soggy patches and ensures even cooking. Always use room-temperature water unless the recipe specifies otherwise.</p>  

<p>After cooking, don’t forget to clean your air fryer properly. Water and food residues can build up over time. Our guide on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>how to clean your air fryer</a> will help maintain its performance and longevity.</p>  

<h3>Troubleshooting water measurements in air fryer recipes</h3>  
<p>If your air fryer dish turns out too dry or too wet, double-check your water measurements. Remember that 1.5 tbsp equals 22.5 grams – even small deviations can affect the outcome. Also consider that different air fryer models may require slight adjustments to liquid quantities due to variations in airflow.</p>

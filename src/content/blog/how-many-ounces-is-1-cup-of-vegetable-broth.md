<p>1 cup of vegetable broth equals approximately 8 fluid ounces (oz) in both US and UK measurements. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes, where precise liquid measurements can affect cooking times and results. Whether you're making soups, sauces, or marinades, knowing this conversion ensures your dish turns out perfectly every time.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Using the correct amount of vegetable broth is crucial for air fryer recipes, as too much liquid can lead to steaming instead of crisping. For example, when making a marinade for chicken or vegetables, 1 cup of vegetable broth (8 oz) provides the right balance of moisture without making the food soggy. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we recommend measuring liquids carefully to achieve the best texture and flavour.</p>  

<p>Many air fryer recipes, such as those for stews or braised dishes, rely on vegetable broth for depth of flavour. If you're converting a traditional recipe to an air fryer-friendly version, knowing that 1 cup of vegetable broth is 8 oz helps you adjust quantities accurately. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more handy measurement tips.</p>  

<h3>US vs. UK Measurements for Vegetable Broth</h3>  
<p>While 1 cup of vegetable broth is 8 oz in both US and UK measurements, it's worth noting that cup sizes can vary slightly in other contexts. For air fryer cooking, stick to standard measuring cups for consistency. If you're using a kitchen scale, 8 fluid ounces of vegetable broth will weigh roughly 8.3 oz by weight due to its density.</p>  

<h2>How to Use Vegetable Broth in Air Fryer Recipes</h2>  
<p>Vegetable broth adds moisture and flavour to air fryer dishes like roasted vegetables, grains, and proteins. For example, when cooking quinoa or rice in the air fryer, substituting water with vegetable broth (1 cup = 8 oz) enhances the taste. Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipes section</a> for creative ways to incorporate broth into your meals.</p>  

<p>Another great use for vegetable broth in the air fryer is deglazing the basket after cooking meats or veggies. Adding a splash (about 2 oz) of broth helps loosen stuck-on bits, making cleanup easier. Pair this with our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner guide</a> for a spotless appliance every time.</p>  

<h3>Converting Larger Quantities of Vegetable Broth</h3>  
<p>If your recipe calls for multiple cups of vegetable broth, simply multiply the number of cups by 8 to get the total ounces. For instance, 2 cups of vegetable broth equal 16 oz, and 4 cups equal 32 oz. This scaling is handy for batch cooking or meal prep in the air fryer.</p>  

<h2>Common Mistakes When Measuring Vegetable Broth</h2>  
<p>One mistake people make is confusing fluid ounces with weight ounces. While 1 cup of vegetable broth is 8 fluid ounces, its weight can vary slightly. Always use a liquid measuring cup for accuracy. For more tips on avoiding measurement errors, browse our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable recipe category</a>.</p>  

<p>Another error is eyeballing the broth instead of measuring it properly. Even a small deviation can affect air fryer performance, especially in recipes like soups or casseroles. Invest in a good-quality measuring cup to ensure consistency in your cooking.</p>  

<h3>Storing Leftover Vegetable Broth</h3>  
<p>If you have leftover vegetable broth after measuring out 1 cup (8 oz), store it in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 4 days. You can also freeze it in ice cube trays for easy portioning—each cube is about 1 oz, perfect for future air fryer recipes.</p>

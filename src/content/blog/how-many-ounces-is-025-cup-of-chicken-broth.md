<p>0.25 cup of chicken broth equals 2 ounces, making it easy to measure for your air fryer recipes. Whether you're preparing soups, sauces, or marinades, knowing this conversion ensures your dishes turn out perfectly every time. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we understand the importance of precise measurements for consistent results.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Cooking with an air fryer requires precision, especially when dealing with liquids like chicken broth. Too much or too little can affect texture and flavour. For example, if you're making a marinade for chicken, 0.25 cup (2 ounces) of broth ensures the right balance without making the dish soggy. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more handy measurements.</p>  

<p>Many air fryer recipes, like those in our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipe category</a>, call for small amounts of broth. Measuring 0.25 cup (2 ounces) correctly helps maintain the dish's integrity. Whether you're cooking frozen foods or fresh ingredients, accuracy is key to achieving crispy, delicious results.</p>  

<h3>How to measure 0.25 cup of chicken broth without a scale</h3>  
<p>If you don't have a kitchen scale, use a liquid measuring cup marked in ounces. Fill it to the 2-ounce line for 0.25 cup of chicken broth. Alternatively, two standard tablespoons equal 1 ounce, so four tablespoons will give you the correct amount.

<h2>Converting 0.25 cup of chicken broth for UK measurements</h2>  
<p>In the UK, fluid ounces are slightly different, but for chicken broth, 0.25 US cup still roughly equals 2 UK fluid ounces. This small difference won't impact most air fryer recipes. However, for baking or precise sauces, it's worth noting. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a> covers both US and UK measurements.</p>

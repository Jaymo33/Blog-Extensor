If you're preparing a batch of <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/breakfast>air fryer breakfast muffins</a>, this measurement ensures the right texture. Always use a kitchen scale for accuracy, especially when scaling recipes up or down.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure 0.375 Cup of Porridge Oats</h3>

<p>535 ml of heavy cream is approximately 2.26 cups. This conversion is essential for baking, cooking, or even whipping up a delicious dessert in your air fryer. Whether you're following a recipe from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> or improvising, knowing this measurement ensures perfect results every time.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Using the correct amount of heavy cream can make or break a recipe. Too little, and your sauce might be too thick; too much, and it could become runny. For air fryer recipes, precision is especially important because the cooking environment is more concentrated. If you're making a creamy pasta dish or a rich dessert, 535 ml of heavy cream converted to cups (2.26 cups) ensures consistency.</p>  

<p>Many recipes on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes</a> rely on precise measurements for the best texture and flavour. Heavy cream is often used in air fryer baking, such as for custards or cakes, where even a slight deviation can affect the outcome. Always measure carefully to avoid disappointment.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure 535 ml of Heavy Cream</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a measuring jug with millilitre markings, you can use standard cups. Since 1 cup equals approximately 237 ml, 535 ml works out to just over 2 and a quarter cups. For best results, use a liquid measuring cup rather than dry measuring cups, as they provide more accuracy for liquids like heavy cream.</p>  

<h2>Converting 535 ml of Heavy Cream in Different Regions</h2>  
<p>In the UK, heavy cream is often sold in 300 ml or 600 ml cartons, so 535 ml might require a bit of calculation. In the US, heavy cream is typically sold in pints (473 ml) or quarts (946 ml). If you're working with a 600 ml UK carton, you’d need just under 90% of it to get 535 ml.</p>  

<p>For those using an air fryer, knowing these conversions helps when scaling recipes. If a recipe on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart</a> calls for 535 ml of heavy cream, you can confidently measure out 2.26 cups without second-guessing.</p>  

<h3>Common Uses for 535 ml of Heavy Cream</h3>  
<p>Heavy cream is versatile—it can be whipped for desserts, used in soups, or added to pasta sauces. In an air fryer, it’s great for making creamy dips or even a rich bread pudding. Since 535 ml is just over 2 cups, it’s a useful quantity for batch cooking or meal prepping.</p>  

<h2>Tips for Storing Leftover Heavy Cream</h2>  
<p>If you don’t use all 535 ml at once, store the remaining cream in an airtight container in the fridge. It typically lasts 3–5 days. Alternatively, freeze it in ice cube trays for later use in sauces or soups. Just give it a good stir after thawing to restore consistency.</p>

<h3>Scaling Recipes with 535 ml of Heavy Cream</h3>  
<p>If a recipe calls for 535 ml of heavy cream but you need to adjust the quantity, remember that 1 cup = 237 ml. For half the amount, use 1.13 cups (267.5 ml). Doubling it would mean 4.52 cups (1070 ml). This flexibility is handy when adapting air fryer recipes for different serving sizes.</p>

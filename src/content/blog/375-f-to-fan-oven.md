<p>375 F converts to approximately 190 C in a fan oven, which is the standard setting for many air fryer recipes. This temperature is ideal for achieving crispy textures while keeping food moist inside. Whether you're adapting recipes or troubleshooting cooking times, understanding this conversion is key to air fryer success.</p>

<h2>Why 375 F Works So Well in Air Fryers</h2>
<p>The 375 F (190 C fan oven) sweet spot delivers rapid heat circulation that mimics deep frying without excessive oil. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>this temperature</a>, proteins develop perfect browning while vegetables retain nutrients. Many frozen foods like chips or chicken nuggets cook beautifully at this setting, as evidenced by our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/frozen-foods>frozen foods collection</a>.</p>
<p>Fan ovens and air fryers share convection technology, but air fryers intensify the effect with compact spaces. This means 375 F in an air fryer cooks about 20% faster than in a standard fan oven. Always check food early when converting recipes between appliances.</p>

<h3>Adjusting Cooking Times at 375 F</h3>
<p>When using 375 F in your air fryer, reduce standard oven times by roughly 25%. For example, roasted potatoes needing 40 minutes in a fan oven will take about 30 minutes. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe hub</a> includes specific timing adjustments for popular dishes.</p>

<h2>Common Foods Cooked at 375 F</h2>
<p>This temperature excels for chicken wings, achieving crisp skin in 18-22 minutes. It's also perfect for reheating pizza (5-7 minutes) or baking cookies (8-10 minutes). The even heat prevents burning while ensuring thorough cooking - a balance our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipes</a> demonstrate perfectly.</p>
<p>Vegetables like Brussels sprouts caramelise beautifully at 375 F without drying out. Toss them lightly in oil and cook for 12-15 minutes, shaking the basket halfway. This method works wonders for meal prep, as shown in our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable section</a>.</p>

<h3>Temperature Variations to Consider</h3>
<p>Some air fryer models run hotter than others at the 375 F setting. Use an oven thermometer to verify your appliance's accuracy. If foods brown too quickly, reduce the temperature by 10 C and extend cooking time slightly.</p>

<h2>Converting Other Oven Types to 375 F</h2>
<p>For conventional ovens without fan assist, increase 375 F by 20 C to 200 C. Gas mark conversions sit between 5-6. These adjustments ensure consistent results when switching between <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> recipes and traditional cooking methods.</p>
<p>Remember that air fryers don't require preheating to 375 F like conventional ovens. Most reach target temperature within 3 minutes, saving energy and time. This makes them ideal for quick weeknight meals.</p>

<h3>Cleaning After High-Temp Cooking</h3>
<p>After cooking at 375 F, always cool your air fryer before cleaning. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning guide</a> shows how to remove grease buildup safely. Regular maintenance ensures consistent performance at high temperatures.</p>

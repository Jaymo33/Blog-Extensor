<p>335°F in a fan oven converts to approximately 300°F in a conventional oven. This adjustment is crucial for achieving consistent baking results, especially when switching between appliances like air fryers and traditional ovens. Understanding these conversions ensures your recipes turn out just right, whether you’re baking a cake or roasting vegetables.</p>  

<h2>Why Convert 335 Fan Oven to Conventional Oven?</h2>  
<p>Fan ovens circulate hot air, cooking food faster and more evenly than conventional ovens. This means recipes designed for conventional ovens may need temperature adjustments when using a fan oven or air fryer. Converting 335°F fan oven to 300°F conventional oven ensures your dishes aren’t overcooked or underdone.</p>  
<p>For example, if you’re baking cookies at 335°F in a fan oven, reducing the temperature to 300°F in a conventional oven prevents burning. This principle applies to air fryers too, as they operate similarly to fan ovens.

<h2>How to Adjust Cooking Times</h2>  
<p>Alongside temperature, cooking times may need tweaking. A fan oven or air fryer cooks about 20% faster than a conventional oven. If a recipe calls for 30 minutes at 335°F in a fan oven, try 25 minutes at 300°F in a conventional oven.</p>  
<p>This adjustment is particularly useful for <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>cake recipes</a>, where precise temperatures are key. Always monitor your dish during the last few minutes to avoid overbaking.

<h3>Using an Air Fryer Instead</h3>  
<p>Air fryers work like mini fan ovens, so the same conversion applies. If your air fryer recipe suggests 335°F, set it to 300°F for a conventional oven. This ensures even cooking without drying out your food. For more air fryer tips, explore <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>our recipe collection</a>.</p>  

<h2>Common Mistakes to Avoid</h2>  
<p>One common error is forgetting to adjust both temperature and time. A 335°F fan oven setting isn’t a direct swap for a conventional oven—always reduce the temperature by 20-25°F. Also, avoid overcrowding the oven or air fryer, as this affects airflow and cooking efficiency.</p>  
<p>Another mistake is assuming all recipes need the same conversion. Delicate items like soufflés or custards may require further adjustments. For cleaning tips after cooking, visit our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner guide</a>.</p>  

<h3>When to Stick to Fan Oven Settings</h3>  
<p>Some modern recipes are designed specifically for fan ovens or air fryers. If the recipe states "335°F fan oven," it’s best to follow it as written unless converting for a conventional oven. Always check the recipe notes for clarity.</p>

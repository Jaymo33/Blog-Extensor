<h2>Why Convert 500g of Garlic Paste to Ounces?</h2>

For example, a recipe like garlic butter shrimp from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>our recipe collection</a> might call for ounces, making this conversion handy.</p>  

<p>Garlic paste is denser than fresh garlic, so weight measurements like grams or ounces are more reliable than volume.

<p>2.5 cups of gram flour equals approximately 10.6 ounces (oz). This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes, where precise measurements can make or break your dish. Gram flour, also known as besan, is a staple in many air fryer recipes, from crispy pakoras to gluten-free baking. If you're using an air fryer, knowing the exact weight ensures consistent results every time. For more air fryer tips, visit <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on even heat distribution, so ingredient ratios are crucial. Too much or too little gram flour can affect texture, crispiness, and cooking time. For example, a batter with too much gram flour might turn out dense, while too little could make it soggy. That's why converting 2.5 cups of gram flour to ounces (10.6 oz) helps maintain balance. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for other common measurements.</p>  

<p>Gram flour is naturally gluten-free and high in protein, making it ideal for air fryer recipes. Whether you're making onion bhajis or chickpea flour pancakes, the right amount ensures perfect results. If you're new to air fryer cooking, start with recipes that use precise measurements, like those on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>our recipes page</a>.</p>  

<h3>How to measure gram flour correctly</h3>  
<p>For the most accurate conversion of 2.5 cups to ounces, use a kitchen scale. Scooping flour directly from the bag can compact it, leading to uneven measurements. Instead, spoon the flour into the measuring cup and level it off. This method ensures you get the correct 10.6 oz for 2.5 cups. If you're scaling a recipe, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a> can help adjust quantities.</p>  

<h2>Common air fryer recipes using gram flour</h2>  
<p>Gram flour is versatile in air fryer cooking, from savoury snacks to sweet treats. Popular dishes include crispy falafel, vegetable fritters, and even gluten-free muffins. Since 2.5 cups (10.6 oz) is a common measurement, it's handy for batch cooking. Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable recipes</a> for inspiration on using gram flour in your air fryer.</p>  

<p>Another favourite is air-fried gram flour-coated chicken or tofu. The flour creates a golden, crunchy exterior without deep frying. For cleaning tips after cooking with gram flour, see our guide on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer maintenance</a>. Proper care ensures your appliance lasts longer and performs optimally.</p>  

<h3>Tips for storing gram flour</h3>  
<p>To keep gram flour fresh, store it in an airtight container in a cool, dry place. This prevents clumping and maintains its quality for air fryer recipes. If you've measured out 2.5 cups (10.6 oz) and have leftovers, label the container with the date. Fresh gram flour ensures the best texture and flavour in your dishes.</p>

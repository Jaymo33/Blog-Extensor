<h2>Why accurate garlic measurements matter</h2>  
<p>Garlic is a powerhouse ingredient that can dominate a dish if overused. In air fryer cooking, 150g of crushed garlic (or 5.29 ounces) adds bold flavour without overwhelming other ingredients. Recipes like garlic butter shrimp or crispy potatoes rely on this balance. Too little, and the dish falls flat; too much, and it becomes pungent. Visit <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>our recipe hub</a> for perfectly measured garlic dishes.</p>  

<p>Crushed garlic also varies in density compared to minced or whole cloves. This means 150g could fill slightly different volumes, but the weight remains consistent. For air fryer meals, sticking to grams or ounces ensures accuracy, especially when following UK-based recipes.</p>  

<h3>How to measure 150g of crushed garlic</h3>  
<p>Using kitchen scales is the most reliable method for measuring 150g of crushed garlic. If you don’t have scales, roughly 5.29 ounces fills a standard 1/2-cup measure when lightly packed. Remember, air fryer recipes often need precision, so investing in a digital scale pays off. Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable category</a> for garlic-heavy dishes.</p>  

<h2>Common recipes using 150g crushed garlic</h2>  
<p>Many air fryer recipes call for 150g of crushed garlic, especially in marinades and sauces. Dishes like garlic bread, roasted mushrooms, or lemon-garlic chicken thrive with this amount. The key is distributing the garlic evenly for maximum flavour. For inspiration, browse our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipes</a>.</p>

<p>5 tablespoons of condensed milk weigh approximately 75 grams. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements can make or break your dish. Whether you're whipping up a dessert or adding a sweet touch to your meal, knowing the exact weight ensures consistency. For more handy conversions, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on even heat distribution, so ingredient quantities must be spot-on. Too much or too little condensed milk can alter texture and cooking time. If you're making cakes or cookies, 5 tbsp of condensed milk (75g) ensures the right sweetness and moisture. Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> for inspiration on using condensed milk perfectly.</p>  

<h3>How to measure condensed milk without scales</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a kitchen scale, use a standard UK tablespoon (15ml) for accuracy. Fill it level with condensed milk, avoiding heaping or underfilling. Five level tablespoons will give you roughly 75 grams. For sticky ingredients like condensed milk, lightly greasing the spoon helps with clean measurement.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for condensed milk in air fryer recipes</h2>  
<p>Condensed milk adds richness to desserts like air fryer banoffee pie or sticky toffee pudding. It’s also great for glazes on cakes or as a sweetener in <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert recipes</a>. Since 5 tbsp equals 75 grams, you can adjust quantities easily for larger batches. Always store leftover condensed milk in an airtight container to maintain freshness.</p>  

<h3>Converting other condensed milk quantities</h3>  
<p>Need more or less than 5 tbsp? Here’s a quick reference: 1 tbsp = 15g, 2 tbsp = 30g, and 10 tbsp = 150g. Bookmark our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a> for future recipes. If you’re working with frozen condensed milk, thaw it first for accurate measuring.</p>  

<h2>Tips for cleaning condensed milk spills in your air fryer</h2>  
<p>Sticky spills can burn and create smoke. Always wipe your air fryer basket after using condensed milk. For tough residue, use our recommended <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner</a>. Regular maintenance keeps your appliance working efficiently and extends its lifespan.</p>

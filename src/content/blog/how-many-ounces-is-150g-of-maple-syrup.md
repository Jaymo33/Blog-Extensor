<p>150g of maple syrup equals approximately 5.29 ounces. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes, where precise measurements can make all the difference. Whether you’re drizzling it over air-fried pancakes or using it as a glaze for chicken, knowing the exact weight ensures perfect results every time. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we understand the importance of accurate conversions for hassle-free cooking.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on precise cooking times and ingredient quantities to deliver crispy, evenly cooked dishes. Using the correct amount of maple syrup, like 150g (or 5.29 ounces), ensures your recipes aren’t too sweet or too dry. For example, a sticky glaze for air-fried salmon requires just the right balance. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more handy measurements.</p>  

<p>Maple syrup is a versatile ingredient, but its thickness means weight matters more than volume. A slight miscalculation could throw off your entire dish. That’s why we recommend using digital scales for accuracy. If you’re new to air frying, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a> has plenty of inspiration to get you started.</p>  

<h3>How to measure 150g of maple syrup without scales</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have scales, you can still measure 150g of maple syrup using tablespoons. Roughly 10 UK tablespoons equal 150g (5.29 ounces). However, this method isn’t as precise, so for best results, invest in a kitchen scale. For more tips on air fryer essentials, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning guide</a> to keep your appliance in top condition.</p>

Try it in our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipes</a> for a caramelised finish that’s irresistibly sticky.</p>

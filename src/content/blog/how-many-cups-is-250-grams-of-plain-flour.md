<h2>Why Accurate Flour Measurements Matter</h2>

<p>Different types of flour can vary slightly in density, but plain flour is relatively consistent. Scooping flour directly from the bag can lead to overpacking, so it's best to spoon it into the measuring cup. Levelling off the top with a knife ensures you get exactly 250 grams of plain flour in cups. This method works for both UK and US cup measurements, though slight variations may occur.</p>  

<h3>UK vs. US Cup Measurements</h3>  
<p>While 250 grams of plain flour equals roughly 2 cups in both the UK and US, there are minor differences in cup sizes. A UK cup holds 250ml, while a US cup is 240ml. For most air fryer recipes, this small discrepancy won’t affect the outcome. However, for precision baking, using a kitchen scale is recommended. If you're converting 250g plain flour to cups, always check which measurement system your recipe uses.</p>  

<h2>How to Measure 250 Grams of Plain Flour Without Scales</h2>  
<p>If you don’t have a kitchen scale, you can still measure 250 grams of plain flour using cups. Lightly spoon the flour into the cup without packing it down, then level it off. This method ensures you don’t accidentally add too much flour, which could ruin your air fryer dish.

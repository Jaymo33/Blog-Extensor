<p>143 C converts to approximately 125 C in a fan oven. This 15-20 degree reduction accounts for the efficient heat circulation in convection cooking. Whether you're using an air fryer or traditional fan oven, understanding this conversion ensures perfectly cooked meals every time.</p>

<h2>Why Fan Oven Temperatures Differ</h2>
<p>Fan ovens circulate hot air constantly, cooking food faster and more evenly than conventional ovens. The moving air transfers heat more efficiently to food surfaces, meaning you can typically reduce temperatures by 15-20 degrees Celsius. This principle applies equally to modern air fryers, which are essentially compact convection ovens. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we recommend starting with this conversion then adjusting based on your specific model.</p>

<p>When converting 143 C to fan oven settings, consider what you're cooking. Delicate items like cakes might need the full 20 degree reduction to prevent over-browning, while denser foods like roasts could handle just 15 degrees less. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> provides detailed adjustments for different food types.</p>

<h3>Air Fryer Specific Considerations</h3>
<p>Modern air fryers intensify the fan oven effect with their compact cooking chambers. For 143 C conversions, you might find your air fryer needs slightly less time than a standard fan oven. We suggest checking food 5 minutes earlier than recipe timings indicate. This is particularly important for our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>cake recipes</a> where precision matters.</p>

<h2>Practical Applications</h2>
<p>Converting 143 C to fan oven settings opens up countless cooking possibilities. From slow-roasting vegetables to baking delicate pastries, the right temperature makes all the difference. Many traditional recipes still use conventional oven temperatures, so knowing how to adjust for your air fryer or fan oven is essential.</p>

<p>For example, when making cookies at 143 C in a fan oven, you'd set it to 125 C and reduce cooking time by about 15%. The circulating air gives that perfect crisp exterior while keeping centres soft.

<h3>Temperature Conversion Chart</h3>
<p>While 143 C converts to 125 C in fan ovens, other common conversions follow similar patterns. 160 C becomes 140 C, 180 C becomes 160 C, and so on. Keeping a conversion chart handy saves time when adapting recipes. Don't forget to factor in your air fryer's unique characteristics too - some models run hotter than others.</p>

<h2>Common Mistakes to Avoid</h2>
<p>One frequent error when converting 143 C to fan oven settings is forgetting to adjust cooking times. The lower temperature doesn't always mean longer cooking - the efficient heat circulation actually speeds things up. Another pitfall is assuming all fan ovens behave identically; actual performance can vary between models.</p>

<p>Regular <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer maintenance</a> also affects temperature accuracy. Built-up grease can insulate heating elements, causing temperature fluctuations. For consistent results when cooking at 143 C fan oven equivalents, clean your appliance regularly and consider using an oven thermometer to verify actual temperatures.</p>

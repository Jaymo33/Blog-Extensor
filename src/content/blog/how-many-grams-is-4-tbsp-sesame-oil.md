<p>4 tablespoons (tbsp) of sesame oil weigh approximately 54 grams (g). This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precision matters, ensuring your dishes turn out perfectly every time. Whether you're marinating, frying, or drizzling, knowing the exact weight helps avoid guesswork.</p>

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on precise ingredient ratios to achieve even cooking and crispiness. Too much or too little oil can affect texture and flavour. For example, 4 tbsp sesame oil to grams ensures your marinades coat evenly, and your fried dishes don’t end up soggy. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more handy measurements.</p>  

<p>Using the correct weight also helps with calorie tracking and portion control. Whether you're meal prepping or following a specific diet, knowing that 4 tbsp of sesame oil in grams is roughly 54g makes it easier to log accurately. Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipes</a> for ideas on how to use sesame oil effectively.</p>  

<h2>How to measure sesame oil for air fryer recipes</h2>  
<p>For the most accurate results, use a digital kitchen scale to weigh 4 tbsp sesame oil in grams. If you don’t have one, remember that 1 tbsp of sesame oil is about 13.5g, so 4 tablespoons equal 54g. This method eliminates inconsistencies caused by varying spoon sizes or oil density.</p>  

<h3>Converting other sesame oil measurements</h3>  
<p>Need smaller or larger quantities? Here’s a quick guide: 1 tbsp = 13.5g, 2 tbsp = 27g, and 3 tbsp = 40.5g. Bookmark our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a> for dishes that use these measurements, like crispy sesame tofu or ginger-soy salmon.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for sesame oil in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Sesame oil adds a rich, nutty flavour to air-fried dishes. Use 4 tbsp (54g) for marinating proteins like chicken or tofu, or toss vegetables in it before frying. Its high smoke point makes it ideal for air frying at higher temperatures.

<h3>Storing sesame oil for freshness</h3>  
<p>To preserve its flavour, store sesame oil in a cool, dark place. Properly sealed, it lasts up to a year. Always check for rancidity before using—fresh oil should smell nutty, not bitter.</p>

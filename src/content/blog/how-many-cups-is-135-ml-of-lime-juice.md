<p>135 ml of lime juice equals approximately 0.57 cups in the US or 0.48 cups in the UK. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements can make or break a dish. Whether you're whipping up a zesty marinade or a tangy dessert, knowing how to convert millilitres to cups ensures consistency. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we understand the importance of accurate measurements for perfect results every time.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Lime Juice Measurements Matter</h2>
<p>Lime juice is a powerful ingredient that can transform a dish with just a small amount. Too much can overpower, while too little might leave your recipe lacking flavour. When using an air fryer, precise measurements like 135 ml of lime juice ensure even cooking and balanced tastes. This is especially crucial for recipes like citrus-glazed chicken or lime-infused desserts where acidity plays a key role. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> makes these calculations effortless.</p>

<p>Many air fryer recipes call for lime juice as a marinade component or finishing touch. The difference between 0.48 UK cups and 0.57 US cups might seem small, but it can affect the final outcome. That's why we recommend using measuring jugs with both metric and imperial markings.

<h3>US vs UK Cup Measurements for Lime Juice</h3>
<p>The slight variation between US and UK cup measurements stems from different standardisation systems. A US cup is 240 ml while a UK cup is 284 ml. This means 135 ml of lime juice converts to 0.57 US cups or 0.48 UK cups. When following recipes from different regions, it's important to note which measurement system they use. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a> clearly specifies measurements for foolproof results.</p>

<h2>Converting 135 ml Lime Juice for Baking</h2>
<p>Baking with lime juice requires particular precision as it often interacts with rising agents. When a recipe calls for 135 ml of lime juice, using the correct cup measurement ensures chemical reactions occur as intended. This is especially true for air fryer cakes and cookies where space is limited and ingredients need to work in harmony. Too much liquid can lead to soggy results, while too little might create dry baked goods.</p>

<p>For perfect lime-infused treats every time, consider investing in a good quality measuring jug. Digital scales that switch between grams and ounces can also be helpful for precise measurements. If you're experimenting with lime in your air fryer baking, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>cake recipe category</a> offers several citrus-inspired options to try with your perfectly measured lime juice.</p>

<h3>Practical Tips for Measuring Lime Juice</h3>
<p>When measuring 135 ml of lime juice, there are several techniques to ensure accuracy. First, use a clear liquid measuring cup placed on a level surface. Pour the juice to the 135 ml mark at eye level for precision. For smaller amounts, a tablespoon measure can be helpful - remember that 135 ml equals about 9 tablespoons. Freshly squeezed lime juice often yields the best flavour, but bottled works in a pinch.</p>

<h2>Using 135 ml Lime Juice in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>
<p>The air fryer's concentrated heat makes lime juice an excellent ingredient for creating quick, flavourful dishes. From 135 ml lime juice marinades for chicken wings to citrus glazes for salmon, precise measurements ensure balanced flavours. The high heat caramelises the lime's natural sugars while maintaining its bright acidity. This creates depth of flavour that's hard to achieve with other cooking methods.</p>

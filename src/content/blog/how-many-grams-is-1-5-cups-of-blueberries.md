<h3>How to Measure Blueberries Correctly</h3>  
<p>To measure 1.5 cups of blueberries accurately, lightly fill your measuring cup without packing them down. Blueberries should sit loosely to avoid excess weight. If using a kitchen scale, 216 grams is your target for 1.5 cups. This method works for both fresh and frozen blueberries, though frozen berries may settle slightly differently.

<h2>Converting Cups to Grams for Different Ingredients</h2>  
<p>Not all ingredients weigh the same per cup—blueberries differ from flour, sugar, or nuts. For instance, 1.5 cups of flour weighs about 180 grams, while 1.5 cups of granulated sugar is roughly 300 grams. This variability is why gram measurements are preferred in baking and air fryer cooking.

<p>When adapting recipes for your air fryer, precise conversions like 1.5 cups of blueberries to grams (216g) ensure consistency. This is especially helpful when scaling recipes up or down.

<h3>Using Frozen vs. Fresh Blueberries</h3>  
<p>Frozen blueberries can be used interchangeably with fresh in most recipes, but their weight per cup may vary slightly due to ice crystals.

<p>210 ml of vinegar is approximately 0.89 cups (just under 1 cup). This conversion is essential for precise cooking and baking, especially when using an air fryer where measurements can make or break a recipe. Whether you're whipping up a marinade or a tangy glaze, knowing how to convert millilitres to cups ensures your dish turns out perfectly every time.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of vinegar in your air fryer recipes can significantly impact the flavour and texture of your dish. Too much vinegar can overpower the taste, while too little might leave your meal lacking that zesty kick. For example, a recipe like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer honey-glazed chicken</a> relies on a balanced vinegar-to-honey ratio for the perfect sweet and sour finish.</p>  

<p>Additionally, precise measurements ensure even cooking. Air fryers circulate hot air rapidly, so liquids like vinegar evaporate faster than in conventional ovens. Measuring 210 ml of vinegar correctly (0.89 cups) helps maintain moisture and prevents drying out. If you're new to air fryer cooking, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for other common measurement swaps.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure 210 ml of Vinegar Without a Measuring Cup</h3>  
<p>Don’t have a measuring cup? No problem! A standard UK tablespoon holds 15 ml, so 14 tablespoons equal roughly 210 ml (just shy of a cup). Alternatively, use a kitchen scale: 210 ml of vinegar weighs about 210 grams, as vinegar has a similar density to water. For more tips on measuring ingredients, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable-based recipes</a>, where precise vinegar measurements often come into play.</p>  

<h2>Converting 210 ml of Vinegar for US and UK Recipes</h2>  
<p>In the UK, 1 cup equals 250 ml, so 210 ml is 0.84 UK cups. In the US, 1 cup is 240 ml, making 210 ml approximately 0.875 US cups. This small difference might not seem like much, but for recipes like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>air fryer buffalo wings</a>, where vinegar is a key ingredient, accuracy is crucial.</p>  

<p>For baking, even a slight mismeasurement can affect acidity levels, altering how ingredients like baking soda react. If you're adapting a US recipe to UK measurements, round 210 ml to 0.9 cups for simplicity. Need to clean your air fryer after a vinegar-heavy recipe?

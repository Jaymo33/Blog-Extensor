<p>5 tablespoons (tbsp) of butter equals approximately 71 grams (g). This conversion is essential for precise cooking, especially when using an air fryer where measurements can make or break a recipe. Whether you're whipping up a batch of cookies or preparing a savoury dish, knowing the exact weight ensures consistent results. For more air fryer conversions, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>

<h2>Why accurate butter measurements matter in air frying</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on precise ingredient ratios to achieve the perfect texture and flavour. Too much butter can lead to greasy results, while too little might leave your dish dry. Converting 5 tbsp of butter to grams (71g) ensures you hit the sweet spot every time. This is particularly important for recipes like air-fried pastries or crispy vegetables, where butter plays a key role. For delicious butter-based recipes, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipe collection</a>.</p>  

<p>In the UK, butter is often sold in 250g blocks, making it easy to measure out 71g for your 5 tbsp requirement. If you're using a kitchen scale, simply weigh the butter directly for accuracy. This method eliminates guesswork and guarantees your air fryer dishes turn out perfectly. For more tips on air fryer measurements, visit <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>.</p>  

<h2>How to measure 5 tbsp of butter without scales</h2>  
<p>If you don’t have a kitchen scale, you can still measure 5 tbsp of butter accurately. Most UK butter blocks come with markings indicating tablespoon measurements. One standard tablespoon of butter is about 14.2g, so 5 tbsp would be roughly 71g. Simply slice the butter according to the pre-marked lines for hassle-free measuring. This trick works wonders for quick air fryer meals like garlic bread or roasted potatoes.</p>  

<p>Another handy method is using measuring spoons. Ensure your tablespoons are level for precise amounts, especially when baking. For recipes requiring melted butter, measure it solid first, then melt it to maintain accuracy. This technique is perfect for air fryer cakes or cookies.

<h3>Common mistakes when converting tbsp to grams</h3>  
<p>One frequent error is using heaped tablespoons instead of level ones, which can add extra grams and throw off your recipe. Always level off the butter with a knife for consistency. Another pitfall is assuming all butters have the same density—salted and unsalted butter weigh the same, but spreads or margarines may differ. Stick to block butter for reliable conversions in air fryer cooking.</p>  

<h3>Butter conversions for popular air fryer recipes</h3>  
<p>Many air fryer recipes call for butter, from crispy chicken to golden pastries. Knowing that 5 tbsp equals 71g helps you adapt recipes effortlessly. For example, if a recipe lists butter in grams but you only have tbsp measures, this conversion saves the day. Bookmark this guide for quick reference next time you’re cooking up a storm in your air fryer.

<h2>Tips for using butter in air fryer recipes</h2>  
<p>Butter adds richness and crispiness to air-fried dishes, but moderation is key. For healthier options, consider brushing melted butter lightly over food instead of drowning it. This technique works well for air-fried corn on the cob or garlic knots. Remember, 5 tbsp (71g) of butter is plenty for most recipes—use it wisely to avoid excess grease.</p>

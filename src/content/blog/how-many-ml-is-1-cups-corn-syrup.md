<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Using the correct amount of corn syrup—240 ml for 1.0 cups—ensures your recipes turn out as intended. Too much can make dishes overly sweet or sticky, while too little might leave them dry.

For sticky ingredients like this, a silicone spatula helps scrape every last drop. Need more baking tips?

<h2>Common Mistakes When Measuring Corn Syrup</h2>  
<p>One frequent error is using a dry measuring cup for liquids like corn syrup, which can lead to inaccuracies.

<h3>Adjusting Recipes for Smaller or Larger Batches</h3>

<p>0.5 cup of sesame oil equals approximately 4 ounces (or 3.9 oz to be precise). This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements ensure perfect results. Whether you’re whipping up a marinade or drizzling oil for crispy veggies, knowing the exact weight helps avoid over or under-seasoning. Sesame oil adds a rich, nutty flavour, so getting the amount right is key. For more air fryer measurement tips, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air frying</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on precise ingredient ratios to achieve even cooking and crispiness. Too much oil can make food greasy, while too little may leave it dry. Sesame oil, with its strong flavour, needs careful measuring to balance taste. A 0.5 cup (4 oz) portion is common in Asian-inspired dishes like stir-fries or glazes. Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a> for ideas using sesame oil.</p>  

<p>Using a kitchen scale for liquids like sesame oil ensures accuracy, especially when scaling recipes. Unlike dry ingredients, oils can’t be levelled off in a measuring cup. For UK cooks, note that 1 US cup equals 8 UK fluid ounces, but weight (oz) remains consistent. This distinction matters when following international recipes. Always check if your recipe uses US or UK measurements to avoid confusion.</p>  

<h3>How to measure 0.5 cup of sesame oil without scales</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have scales, use liquid measuring cups with clear markings at eye level. Pour sesame oil slowly until it reaches the 0.5 cup line (120ml). Thicker oils like sesame may cling to the cup, so let it settle before checking. For smaller amounts, tablespoons work too—0.5 cup equals 8 tablespoons. Remember, these methods are less precise than weighing but work in a pinch. Need cleaning tips for oily residue?

<h2>Sesame oil substitutes and conversions</h2>  
<p>If you’re out of sesame oil, peanut or vegetable oil can substitute at a 1:1 ratio, though flavour will differ. For 0.5 cup sesame oil (4 oz), use the same volume of alternatives but adjust seasoning. Toasted sesame oil is stronger, so reduce the amount by half if swapping for regular. Find more substitution tips in our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable recipe category</a>, perfect for oil-based dishes.</p>  

<p>When converting larger batches, remember 1 cup of sesame oil equals 8 ounces. This makes scaling straightforward—just double or halve as needed. For recipes using grams, 0.5 cup (4 oz) is roughly 110g.

Precise measurements are the secret to restaurant-quality air fryer meals at home.</p>

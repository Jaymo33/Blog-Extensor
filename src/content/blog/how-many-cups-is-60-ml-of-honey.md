Honey is about 1.4 times denser than water, so 60 ml of honey will weigh roughly 84 grams, whereas water weighs 60 grams per 60 ml.

Honey’s sticky consistency makes it harder to level off in a dry cup, potentially leading to over-pouring. For 60 ml of honey (0.25 cups), a clear liquid cup with a spout allows you to measure at eye level and pour cleanly."

If substituting 60 ml of honey for sugar in an air fryer recipe, reduce the temperature by about 10°C and check for doneness a few minutes early.

For consistent 60 ml measurements, let honey reach room temperature or warm the container slightly in warm water. Always use the same measuring method (liquid cup vs. spoon) for repeatable results."

<p>60 ml of honey is approximately 0.25 cups (or 1/4 cup) in both UK and US measurements. This conversion is essential for baking, cooking, and especially when using an air fryer, where precise measurements can make or break a recipe. Whether you're whipping up a glaze for salmon or sweetening a cake, knowing how to convert 60 ml of honey to cups ensures consistent results every time.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Honey Measurements Matter</h2>
<p>Honey is denser than water, so volume measurements like cups and millilitres don’t always translate perfectly by weight. A slight mismeasurement can throw off the texture and sweetness of your dish. For air fryer recipes, where ingredients cook quickly and evenly, precision is even more critical. Too much honey can lead to over-browning or sticking, while too little might leave your dish lacking flavour.</p>
<p>At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we recommend using a liquid measuring cup for honey rather than dry cups for the most accurate results. If you’re adapting a recipe from millilitres to cups, bookmark our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for quick reference.</p>

<h2>Converting 60 ml of Honey to Cups</h2>
<p>To convert 60 ml of honey to cups, remember that 240 ml equals 1 cup. This means 60 ml is exactly one-quarter of a cup (0.25 cups). This conversion works for both UK and US cup measurements, though slight variations can occur based on honey density or temperature. For sticky ingredients like honey, lightly greasing your measuring cup can help it slide out easily.</p>
<p>If you’re scaling up a recipe, keep in mind that 120 ml of honey would be 0.5 cups (1/2 cup), and 180 ml would be 0.75 cups (3/4 cup). Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipes section</a> includes plenty of honey-based dishes, from glazed chicken to honey cakes, all tested for perfect air fryer results.</p>

<h3>Tips for Measuring Honey Accurately</h3>
<p>Honey’s sticky nature can make measuring tricky. For the most precise 60 ml of honey in cups, use a clear liquid measuring cup and check at eye level. Warming the honey slightly (by placing the container in warm water) can make it easier to pour. Avoid packing honey into the cup, as this can lead to over-measuring.</p>

<h3>Common Recipes Using 60 ml of Honey</h3>
<p>Many air fryer recipes call for 60 ml of honey, such as honey-glazed carrots, teriyaki salmon, or spiced nuts. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipes</a> for dishes like honey-mustard wings or sticky soy-honey drumsticks. Each recipe is designed to work perfectly with your air fryer’s rapid cooking style.</p>

<h2>Honey Conversions for Baking vs. Cooking</h2>
<p>In baking, 60 ml of honey (0.25 cups) often replaces sugar, adding moisture and a distinct flavour. Since honey is sweeter than sugar, you might need to adjust other liquids in the recipe. For savoury air fryer dishes, like honey-glazed vegetables or marinades, 60 ml of honey provides just the right balance of sweetness without overpowering.</p>
<p>If you’re experimenting with substitutions, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner guide</a> can help tackle any sticky spills from honey-based recipes. Keeping your air fryer basket clean ensures even cooking and prevents smoke from burnt residues.</p>

<h3>UK vs. US Cup Measurements for Honey</h3>
<p>Luckily, 60 ml of honey converts to the same cup measurement in both the UK and US (0.25 cups). The main difference lies in the volume of an imperial cup (284 ml in the UK) versus a US cup (240 ml), but for smaller amounts like 60 ml, the discrepancy is negligible. Always double-check if a recipe specifies which cup measurement it uses.</p>

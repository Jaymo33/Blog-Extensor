<p>360 F converts to approximately 180 C in a fan oven. This is the standard equivalent for most recipes requiring 360 F, whether you're using an air fryer or conventional oven. The conversion ensures your dishes cook evenly without burning or undercooking.</p>

<h2>Understanding 360 F to Fan Oven Conversions</h2>
<p>When converting 360 F to a fan oven, the key is recognising that fan-assisted ovens circulate hot air, allowing for lower temperatures. This means 360 F (182 C in a conventional oven) drops to 180 C in a fan setting. Many air fryer recipes at <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> use 360 F as a baseline for crispy results, making this conversion essential for oven users.</p>
<p>Fan ovens cook about 20 C cooler than their conventional counterparts due to the efficient air circulation. So if a recipe calls for 360 F, you'll achieve similar results at 180 C in a fan oven. This principle applies whether you're roasting vegetables from our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable recipes</a> or baking goods that normally require precise temperatures.</p>

<h2>Why 360 F Works for Air Fryers and Fan Ovens</h2>
<p>360 F strikes a perfect balance between browning and thorough cooking in both appliances. In air fryers, this temperature crisps exteriors while keeping interiors moist - ideal for foods like those in our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes collection</a>. The same applies to fan ovens at 180 C, where the circulating air mimics an air fryer's rapid heat transfer.</p>
<p>The 360 F to 180 C fan oven conversion particularly shines with frozen foods. Whether you're cooking frozen chips or ready meals from our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/frozen-foods>frozen foods section</a>, this temperature ensures crispy results without drying out the food. It's also the sweet spot for reheating leftovers evenly.</p>

<h3>Adjusting Cooking Times at 360 F/180 C</h3>
<p>While the temperature converts directly, cooking times may need slight adjustments. Fan ovens typically cook 10-15% faster than conventional ovens at the same temperature. When using 180 C (360 F equivalent), start checking your food 5 minutes earlier than the recipe suggests, especially for baked goods.</p>

<h2>Common Uses for 360 F in Fan Ovens</h2>
<p>Many popular dishes thrive at this temperature conversion. Roast chicken achieves golden skin at 360 F/180 C fan, while cookies spread perfectly without burning. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a> shows how this temperature works across various foods, helping you adapt air fryer recipes to your fan oven.</p>
<p>Vegetables particularly benefit from 360 F/180 C fan cooking. The temperature caramelises natural sugars while preserving texture. Whether you're cooking broccoli, carrots, or potatoes from our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/potatoes>potato recipes</a>, this setting delivers consistent, restaurant-quality results every time.</p>

<h3>Troubleshooting 360 F Fan Oven Cooking</h3>
<p>If foods brown too quickly at 180 C fan (360 F equivalent), try reducing the temperature by 10 C. Conversely, if dishes seem pale, verify your oven's calibration. An oven thermometer helps ensure your 360 F conversion delivers the intended results, just like in an air fryer.</p>

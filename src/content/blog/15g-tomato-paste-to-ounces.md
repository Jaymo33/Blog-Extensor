<p>15g of tomato paste equals approximately 0.53 ounces. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements can make all the difference. Whether you're whipping up a quick pasta sauce or a flavourful marinade, knowing how to convert grams to ounces ensures your dish turns out perfectly every time.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of tomato paste can elevate your air fryer dishes from good to great. Too little, and your recipe might lack depth; too much, and it could overpower other flavours. For example, a <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>delicious air fryer chicken recipe</a> might call for 15g of tomato paste to create a rich, tangy glaze. Getting the measurement spot-on ensures balanced flavours and perfect results.</p>  

<p>Tomato paste is a concentrated ingredient, so small quantities pack a big punch. If you're adapting a recipe from grams to ounces, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> can be a lifesaver. It’s especially handy for UK cooks who might be using recipes from international sources.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure 15g of Tomato Paste Without Scales</h3>  
<p>Don’t have a kitchen scale? No problem. A standard UK teaspoon holds about 5g of tomato paste, so 15g would be roughly three level teaspoons. For ounces, that’s just over half an ounce. This method isn’t as precise as weighing, but it’s a handy workaround for quick meals.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for 15g of Tomato Paste in Air Fryer Recipes</h2>  
<p>Tomato paste is a versatile ingredient that adds depth to many air fryer dishes. From <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>roasted vegetables</a> to meaty mains, a small amount can transform your cooking. For instance, mixing 15g of tomato paste with olive oil and herbs creates a simple yet flavourful marinade for air-fried chicken or tofu.</p>  

<p>Another great use is in sauces and dips. Blend 15g of tomato paste with Greek yoghurt, garlic, and a pinch of salt for a quick dip to serve with air-fried sweet potato fries. The concentrated flavour means a little goes a long way, making it a cost-effective staple for your kitchen.</p>  

<h3>Storing Leftover Tomato Paste</h3>  
<p>Opened tomato paste can dry out quickly, so proper storage is key. Transfer any unused paste into an airtight container and refrigerate for up to a week. For longer storage, freeze tablespoon-sized portions on a tray, then transfer to a freezer bag. This way, you’ll always have the right amount ready for your next air fryer creation.</p>  

<h2>Converting Other Common Air Fryer Ingredients</h2>  
<p>If you frequently cook with international recipes, you might need to convert other ingredients too. For example, 15g of butter is roughly 0.53 ounces, similar to tomato paste. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a> covers everything from flour to spices, making it easier to follow any recipe with confidence.</p>  

<p>Precision is especially important in baking. A <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>simple air fryer cake</a> might require exact measurements to rise properly. While tomato paste isn’t typically used in cakes, understanding conversions ensures you can adapt any recipe to your preferred measurements.</p>

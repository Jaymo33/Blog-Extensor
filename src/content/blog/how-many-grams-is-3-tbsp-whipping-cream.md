<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on even heat distribution, and ingredient ratios play a crucial role in achieving the right texture.

Similarly, savoury dishes like creamy pasta bakes benefit from exact measurements to avoid separation or curdling.</p>

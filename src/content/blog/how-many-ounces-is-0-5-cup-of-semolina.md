<p>0.5 cup of semolina equals approximately 2.5 ounces (70 grams). This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements ensure the best texture and consistency. Whether you're making crispy semolina-coated chicken or a fluffy semolina cake in your air fryer, knowing the exact weight saves time and guarantees great results.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on even heat distribution, so ingredient proportions must be spot-on. Too much or too little semolina can alter the texture of your dish. For example, if you're coating chicken with semolina for a crispy finish, 0.5 cup (2.5 oz) is often the perfect amount for two servings. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more handy measurements.</p>  

<p>Semolina is a versatile ingredient, often used in air fryer recipes for breading or baking. If you're experimenting with new dishes, like semolina-crusted fish or air-fried semolina muffins, precise measurements ensure consistency. Visit our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipes section</a> for inspiration on how to use semolina in your air fryer.</p>  

<h3>How to measure 0.5 cup of semolina accurately</h3>  
<p>Use a dry measuring cup and level it off with a straight edge for the most accurate 0.5 cup measurement. If you don’t have a measuring cup, a kitchen scale set to ounces (2.5 oz) works perfectly. This method is especially useful for air fryer recipes where even small deviations can affect cooking times.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for semolina in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Semolina adds a delightful crunch to air-fried foods. From coating chicken tenders to creating a crispy base for pizzas, 0.5 cup (2.5 oz) is often the ideal quantity. It’s also great for dusting air fryer baskets to prevent sticking—just a light sprinkle will do. For more tips, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipes</a> featuring semolina coatings.</p>  

<p>Beyond savoury dishes, semolina works wonders in air fryer desserts. A 0.5 cup (2.5 oz) portion can be used to make semolina halva or air-fried semolina cookies. The key is ensuring the right balance with other ingredients.

<h3>Converting semolina measurements for different recipes</h3>  
<p>If a recipe calls for grams instead of ounces, 0.5 cup of semolina is roughly 70 grams. This conversion is handy for international recipes or when using a digital scale.

<p>1.5 cups of tahini equals approximately 12 ounces (340 grams). This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements can make or break a dish. Whether you’re making a creamy tahini dressing or a nutty dip, knowing the exact weight ensures consistency. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we focus on helping you get the most out of your air fryer with accurate measurements and delicious recipes.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on even cooking, and incorrect measurements can lead to uneven results. Too much tahini in a marinade, for example, might make it overly thick, while too little could leave it lacking flavour. Measuring 1.5 cups of tahini correctly (12 ounces) ensures your recipes turn out perfectly every time. For more conversion tips, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>  

<p>Many air fryer recipes, especially those involving sauces or dips, require precise tahini measurements. Whether you’re making a tahini-based glaze for roasted vegetables or a creamy dressing for salads, accuracy is key. A kitchen scale can help, but if you’re using cups, knowing that 1.5 cups equals 12 ounces simplifies the process.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure Tahini Correctly</h3>  
<p>Tahini is a thick, sticky paste, so measuring it can be tricky. For the most accurate 1.5 cups (12 ounces), use a liquid measuring cup and level it off with a spatula. Alternatively, weigh it directly on a kitchen scale. If you’re adapting a recipe from grams to cups, remember that 340 grams of tahini equals 1.5 cups or 12 ounces.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for Tahini in Air Fryer Recipes</h2>  
<p>Tahini is a versatile ingredient in air fryer cooking, adding richness to both savoury and sweet dishes. From marinades for chicken or tofu to drizzles for roasted vegetables, 1.5 cups (12 ounces) of tahini can go a long way. Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> for inspiration on how to use tahini in your meals.</p>  

<p>One popular dish is air-fried falafel, where tahini serves as a creamy dipping sauce. Another is tahini-glazed salmon, where the nutty flavour complements the fish perfectly. By measuring 1.5 cups of tahini accurately (12 ounces), you ensure the right balance of flavours and textures in every bite.</p>  

<h3>Converting Tahini Measurements for Different Recipes</h3>  
<p>If a recipe calls for 1.5 cups of tahini (12 ounces) but you only have a jar labelled in grams, this conversion is handy. For UK cooks, 340 grams is the equivalent, making it easy to adjust measurements. Always check your tahini’s consistency, as some brands may be thicker or thinner, slightly affecting the volume-to-weight ratio.</p>  

<h2>Storing Tahini for Air Fryer Recipes</h2>  
<p>Once opened, tahini should be stored in the fridge to maintain freshness. If you’ve measured out 1.5 cups (12 ounces) for a recipe but have leftovers, transfer them to an airtight container. Proper storage ensures your tahini stays smooth and ready for your next air fryer creation. For more tips on keeping your air fryer in top shape, visit our guide on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning your air fryer</a>.</p>  

<p>Tahini can separate over time, so give it a good stir before measuring 1.5 cups (12 ounces). If it’s too thick, a splash of warm water can help loosen it. This ensures accurate measurements and smooth incorporation into your air fryer dishes, whether you’re making sauces, dips, or marinades.</p>  

<h3>Scaling Tahini Quantities for Larger Batches</h3>  
<p>If you’re meal prepping or cooking for a crowd, you might need to scale up your tahini measurements. For example, 3 cups of tahini would be 24 ounces (680 grams). Keeping the 1.5-cups-to-12-ounces ratio in mind makes scaling recipes simple and ensures consistent results every time.</p>

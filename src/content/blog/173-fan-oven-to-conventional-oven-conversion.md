<p>173°C in a fan oven converts to approximately 190°C in a conventional oven. This adjustment accounts for the more efficient heat distribution in fan-assisted ovens. Whether you're baking cakes or roasting vegetables, getting this conversion right ensures your dishes turn out perfectly every time.</p>

<h2>Why Convert 173 Fan Oven to Conventional Oven?</h2>
<p>Fan ovens circulate hot air around the food, cooking it more evenly and quickly than conventional ovens. This means recipes designed for conventional ovens need temperature adjustments when using a fan oven. The general rule is to reduce the temperature by 20°C when converting from conventional to fan, or increase by 20°C when going the other way.</p>
<p>At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we recommend always checking your oven's manual as some models may vary. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> can help with other common temperature conversions too. When working with 173 fan oven to conventional oven conversions, this 20°C rule holds true for most standard recipes.</p>

<h2>How to Apply 173 Fan Oven Conversion</h2>
<p>When you see a recipe calling for 173°C in a fan oven, you'll need to set your conventional oven to 190°C. This applies whether you're baking, roasting, or using your air fryer. The extra heat compensates for the lack of circulating air in conventional ovens.</p>
<p>For best results, consider these tips when converting 173 fan oven to conventional oven temperatures. First, always preheat your oven properly - conventional ovens take longer to reach temperature than fan ovens. Second, check your food 5-10 minutes earlier than the recipe suggests, as cooking times may vary slightly with the higher temperature.</p>

<h3>Special Considerations for Air Fryers</h3>
<p>Air fryers work similarly to fan ovens, circulating hot air around the food. If you're converting a 173 fan oven recipe for air fryer use, you can typically use the same temperature. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> section for more specific guidance on different foods.</p>

<h2>Common Foods Cooked at 173 Fan Oven</h2>
<p>Many delicate baked goods and roasts use 173°C in fan ovens. This includes items like Victoria sponge cakes, meringues, and slow-roasted meats. When converting these to conventional oven cooking, the 190°C equivalent will help achieve similar results.</p>
<p>For example, if you're making a <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>cake recipe</a> that calls for 173°C fan, setting your conventional oven to 190°C should give you comparable results. The same applies when roasting vegetables or cooking <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken dishes</a> - just remember to adjust the temperature accordingly.</p>

<h3>Checking for Doneness</h3>
<p>With the higher conventional oven temperature, it's especially important to check your food for doneness. Use a meat thermometer for proteins and the skewer test for baked goods. The visual cues in your recipe might appear slightly earlier due to the temperature difference.</p>

<h2>Temperature Conversion Chart</h2>
<p>While we've focused on 173 fan oven to conventional oven conversion, here's a quick reference for other common temperatures. Fan 160°C = Conventional 180°C, Fan 180°C = Conventional 200°C, and Fan 200°C = Conventional 220°C. These conversions follow the same 20°C rule.</p>

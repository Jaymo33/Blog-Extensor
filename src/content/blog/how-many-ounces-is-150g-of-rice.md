<h3>Does rice type affect the 150g to ounces conversion?</h3>  
<p>While 150g always equals 5.29 ounces, different rice types have varying volumes. For example, 150g of basmati rice fills more space than short-grain rice. This doesn’t change the weight conversion but may affect how you measure it. When adapting recipes, stick to weight measurements for accuracy, especially in air fryer cooking where space is limited.</p>

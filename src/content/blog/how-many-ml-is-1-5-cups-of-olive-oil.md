<p>1.5 cups of olive oil equals 355 millilitres (ml). This conversion is essential for accurate cooking, especially when using an air fryer, where precise measurements can make or break a recipe. Whether you're preparing a marinade, dressing, or baking, knowing the exact millilitre equivalent ensures consistent results every time.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Olive Oil Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of olive oil is crucial for achieving the perfect texture and flavour in your dishes. Too much oil can make food greasy, while too little may leave it dry. For air fryer recipes, precise measurements help maintain the ideal balance, ensuring crispy, golden results without excess oil. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we emphasise the importance of accurate conversions for foolproof cooking.</p>  

<p>Olive oil is a staple in many kitchens, and its versatility makes it a favourite for frying, roasting, and baking. Whether you're making roasted vegetables or a moist cake, knowing how many millilitres are in 1.5 cups of olive oil ensures your dish turns out just right.

<h2>How to Measure 1.5 Cups of Olive Oil in ml</h2>  
<p>Measuring liquids like olive oil can be tricky, especially when switching between cups and millilitres. A standard US cup holds 237 ml, so 1.5 cups equal 355.5 ml (often rounded to 355 ml for simplicity). In the UK, a metric cup is 250 ml, making 1.5 cups 375 ml. Always check which measurement system your recipe uses to avoid confusion.</p>  

<p>For air fryer cooking, a kitchen scale or liquid measuring jug is your best friend. If you don’t have one, use a tablespoon (15 ml) to measure out smaller quantities. For example, 1.5 cups of olive oil is roughly 24 tablespoons. Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a> for dishes that make the most of precise oil measurements.</p>  

<h3>Converting Olive Oil for Baking vs. Frying</h3>  
<p>Baking often requires stricter measurements than frying, as the balance of wet and dry ingredients affects the final product. When converting 1.5 cups of olive oil to ml for baking, stick to the exact 355 ml measurement. For frying or roasting in an air fryer, a slight variation (350–360 ml) is usually fine, as the oil’s role is more about coating and crisping.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for 1.5 Cups of Olive Oil</h2>  
<p>From salad dressings to air-fried chicken, 1.5 cups (355 ml) of olive oil is a versatile quantity. It’s enough to marinate a whole chicken, drizzle over a large tray of roasted vegetables, or mix into a batch of homemade mayonnaise.

<h3>Does Olive Oil Type Affect the Measurement?</h3>  
<p>Extra virgin, light, or blended olive oil all have the same volume-to-millilitre conversion. However, their viscosity and smoke points differ, which matters more for cooking methods than measurements. In an air fryer, lighter olive oils are better for high-heat cooking, while extra virgin is ideal for dressings or low-temperature baking.</p>

<p>860 ml of honey is roughly 3.6 cups, making it easy to measure for your air fryer recipes. Whether you're baking a cake or glazing chicken, knowing this conversion ensures perfect results every time. Honey’s thickness means it doesn’t pour like water, so measuring accurately is key. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we help simplify conversions so your cooking stays stress-free. Keep reading for tips on measuring sticky ingredients like honey.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Honey Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of honey ensures your air fryer dishes turn out just right. Too much can make food overly sweet or sticky, while too little might leave flavours lacking. Honey’s density varies slightly, but 860 ml consistently converts to about 3.6 cups. This precision is especially important for baking, where ratios are crucial. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more handy measurement tips.</p>  

<p>Honey also caramelises differently than sugar, affecting texture and browning in air fryer recipes. Measuring correctly helps avoid burnt edges or undercooked centres. For sticky ingredients like honey, lightly greasing your measuring cup first makes pouring easier. If you’re adapting a recipe from grams or millilitres, our guide takes the guesswork out.

<h3>How to Measure 860 ml of Honey Without a Scale</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a kitchen scale, use liquid measuring cups for accuracy. Fill the cup to the 3.6-cup mark, or use multiple cups if needed. For thicker honey, warm the container slightly to help it pour smoothly. Avoid packing honey down, as this can lead to over-measuring. A quick trick: coat your spoon or cup with oil to prevent sticking.</p>  

<h2>Converting Honey for UK and US Recipes</h2>  
<p>Recipes from the US often use cups, while UK recipes favour millilitres. Knowing that 860 ml equals 3.6 cups bridges this gap effortlessly. This conversion works for both baking and savoury dishes, like honey-mustard salmon in your air fryer. Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/salmon>salmon recipes</a> for delicious ways to use honey. Always double-check measurements if adapting a recipe from another country.</p>  

<p>Honey’s sweetness can vary by type (e.g., manuka vs. clover), but the volume conversion stays consistent. For sticky ingredients, a silicone spatula helps scrape every last drop. If you’re scaling a recipe up or down, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a> simplifies the maths. Need to clean sticky residue?

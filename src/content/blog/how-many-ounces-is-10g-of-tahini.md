<p>10g of tahini equals approximately 0.35 ounces. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precision matters. Whether you're making dressings, marinades, or dips, knowing the exact weight ensures perfect results every time. For more air fryer conversions, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on precise ingredient ratios to achieve crispy, evenly cooked dishes. Using the correct amount of tahini—whether in grams or ounces—can make or break a recipe. Too much tahini might make a dish overly rich, while too little could leave it lacking in flavour. That’s why understanding conversions like 10g tahini to ounces is so important. For more tips on perfecting your air fryer meals, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a>.</p>  

<p>Many UK cooks prefer weighing ingredients in grams, but some recipes use ounces. Knowing how to switch between the two ensures you can follow any recipe with confidence. Whether you're making hummus, salad dressings, or marinades, getting the tahini measurement right is key. A digital kitchen scale is a great tool for this, but our quick conversion guide helps when you're in a pinch.</p>  

<h3>How to measure tahini without a scale</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a kitchen scale, you can still measure 10g of tahini (0.35 oz) using spoons. One tablespoon of tahini weighs roughly 15g, so 10g is about two-thirds of a tablespoon. This method isn’t as precise as weighing, but it works in a pinch. For best results, we recommend investing in a digital scale for accurate air fryer cooking.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for tahini in air fryer recipes</h2>  
<p>Tahini adds a rich, nutty flavour to many dishes, from dips to marinades. In air fryer cooking, it’s often used in dressings for roasted vegetables or as a base for sauces. Try it in our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable air fryer recipes</a> for an extra depth of flavour. Whether you're making crispy cauliflower or roasted aubergine, tahini can elevate your dish.</p>  

<p>Another great use for tahini is in marinades for proteins like chicken or tofu. A mix of tahini, lemon juice, and spices makes a delicious coating for air-fried dishes. Since tahini is calorie-dense, measuring 10g (0.35 oz) accurately helps control portion sizes. For more inspiration, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken air fryer recipes</a>.</p>  

<h3>Storing tahini for freshness</h3>  
<p>Tahini can separate over time, so always stir it well before measuring. Store it in a cool, dark place to maintain its quality. If you’re using tahini frequently in air fryer recipes, consider keeping it in the fridge to extend its shelf life. Proper storage ensures your 10g (0.35 oz) measurements are consistent and flavourful.</p>  

<h2>Converting other tahini measurements</h2>  
<p>If your recipe calls for a different amount of tahini, here’s a quick reference: 20g is roughly 0.7 oz, and 50g is about 1.75 oz. These conversions are handy when scaling recipes up or down. For more detailed guides, visit <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>.</p>  

<p>Remember, tahini’s thickness can vary by brand, which may slightly affect weight-to-volume conversions. For the most accurate results, always weigh your ingredients. Keeping your air fryer clean is also crucial—check out our guide on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner</a> for tips.</p>

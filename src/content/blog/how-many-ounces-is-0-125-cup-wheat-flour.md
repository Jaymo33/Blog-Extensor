<p>0.125 cup of wheat flour equals approximately 0.56 ounces (16 grams). This precise measurement is essential for air fryer baking, where accuracy ensures perfect texture and consistency in your recipes. Whether you're making air fryer cakes, cookies, or bread, knowing the exact weight of your ingredients matters.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Flour Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers cook food faster and more evenly than conventional ovens, so precise measurements are crucial. Too much flour can make baked goods dense, while too little may cause them to crumble.

Measuring 0.125 cup correctly helps maintain the right balance of dry to wet ingredients. A kitchen scale is the best tool for this, but if you don’t have one, our guide ensures you get it right.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure 0.125 Cup of Wheat Flour Without a Scale</h3>

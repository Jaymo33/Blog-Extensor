At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we help you nail every recipe with accurate conversions and expert tips.</p>  

<h2>Why convert 75g powdered milk to ounces?</h2>  
<p>Many UK air fryer recipes use metric measurements, but some kitchen scales or older cookbooks might list ingredients in ounces. Converting 75g of powdered milk to ounces (2.65 oz) ensures you’re using the right amount for consistent results. Powdered milk is a staple in air fryer baking, adding richness to cakes, bread, and even savoury dishes like creamy pasta bakes. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more handy measurement swaps.</p>  

<p>Using the correct weight prevents dry or overly dense textures in air-fried treats. For example, adding too much powdered milk can make a cake crumbly, while too little might leave it lacking flavour. Precision matters, especially in compact air fryers where ingredient ratios are crucial. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> are tested to perfection, so you’ll never second-guess measurements.</p>  

<h3>How to measure 75g of powdered milk accurately</h3>  
<p>For the best results, use a digital kitchen scale set to grams. Spoon the powdered milk into your measuring cup without packing it down, then level it off. If you don’t have a scale, 75g is roughly ¾ of a standard US cup (120ml), but weighing is far more reliable. Air fryer recipes, like our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>air fryer cakes</a>, rely on precise measurements for even cooking and fluffy textures.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for 75g powdered milk in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Powdered milk is a versatile ingredient in air fryer recipes. It’s often used in breads, muffins, and biscuits to enhance tenderness and shelf life. A 75g portion (2.65 oz) is perfect for a batch of scones or a small cake. It also works wonders in savoury dishes, like coating for fried chicken or thickening sauces. Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert recipes</a> for inspiration on using powdered milk creatively.</p>  

<p>Another great use is in homemade air fryer pancake mix or instant pudding. Since air fryers circulate hot air efficiently, recipes with powdered milk cook evenly without curdling. Just remember to sift the powder to avoid lumps.

<h3>Converting other powdered ingredients</h3>  
<p>The same 75g-to-ounces conversion applies to similar dry ingredients like flour, sugar, or cocoa powder. However, densities vary, so always weigh them separately. For example, 75g of flour is roughly 2.65 oz, but it’ll fill a cup differently than powdered milk. When adapting recipes for your air fryer, consistency is key—especially for batters and doughs.</p>

<p>685 ml of chicken broth is roughly 2.9 cups in the UK or 2.75 cups in the US. This conversion is handy for air fryer recipes where precise liquid measurements matter. Whether you're making a stew, gravy, or marinade, knowing how to switch between millilitres and cups ensures consistent results. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we focus on making cooking conversions effortless for home chefs. Let’s break down the details so you can measure with confidence.</p>  

<h2>Understanding Cup Measurements for Chicken Broth</h2>  
<p>Chicken broth is a staple in many air fryer dishes, from soups to braised meats. The UK and US use slightly different cup sizes, which affects conversions. In the UK, 1 cup equals 284 ml, while in the US, it’s 240 ml. This means 685 ml translates to about 2.9 UK cups or 2.75 US cups. For most recipes, a slight variance won’t ruin your dish, but precision helps with baking or sauces. Check our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more handy measurement swaps.</p>  

<p>If you’re working with a recipe from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>our collection</a>, you’ll often see both metric and imperial units. Measuring liquids like chicken broth accurately ensures your air fryer meals have the right consistency. Too much broth can make a dish soggy, while too little might leave it dry. A good rule is to use a jug with clear millilitre markings or a standard measuring cup for best results.</p>  

<h3>Why Accuracy Matters in Air Fryer Cooking</h3>  
<p>Air fryers circulate hot air to cook food evenly, so liquid ratios are crucial. Adding the right amount of chicken broth—whether 685 ml or another measure—affects texture and flavour. For example, a creamy mushroom sauce needs precise broth quantities to avoid being too runny. If you’re adapting a stovetop recipe for the air fryer, double-check conversions to prevent mishaps.</p>  

<h2>Converting 685 ml of Chicken Broth for Recipes</h2>  
<p>Many air fryer recipes, like our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken dishes</a>, call for broth as a base. If a recipe lists 685 ml, you can use roughly 2 ¾ US cups or just under 3 UK cups. For smaller batches, halving the amount (about 1.4 UK cups or 1.375 US cups) works well. Always stir the broth into other ingredients thoroughly to distribute moisture evenly during cooking.</p>  

<p>When substituting stock cubes or bouillon, dissolve them in water first to match the 685 ml measurement. This ensures the seasoning blends properly. Need a cleaner air fryer after cooking? Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning guide</a> helps maintain your appliance for long-lasting use. Remember, accurate measuring leads to tastier, more reliable results every time.</p>  

<h3>Common Uses for 685 ml of Chicken Broth</h3>  
<p>This quantity is perfect for single-serve soups, marinades, or deglazing an air fryer basket. For example, a fragrant Thai-inspired broth or a simple gravy benefits from the 685 ml measurement. If you’re meal prepping, scale up the amount proportionally—just keep the ratios consistent for flavour balance.</p>

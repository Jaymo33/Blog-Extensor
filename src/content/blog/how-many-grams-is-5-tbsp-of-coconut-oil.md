<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of coconut oil can make or break your air fryer recipes. Too little, and your food might stick or dry out; too much, and it could become greasy.

<p>Coconut oil is a popular choice for air frying because of its high smoke point and subtle flavour. Unlike butter, which burns easily, coconut oil remains stable at higher temperatures, making it ideal for air fryer cooking. Whether you’re preparing a savoury <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipe</a> or a sweet treat, measuring it correctly ensures consistent results.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure Coconut Oil for Air Fryer Recipes</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a kitchen scale, you can still measure 5 tbsp of coconut oil accurately. Solid coconut oil can be scooped and levelled with a spoon, while melted coconut oil should be poured into a measuring spoon. For best results, we recommend using grams for precision, especially when baking air fryer cakes or cookies where ratios are crucial.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for 5 Tbsp of Coconut Oil in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>From roasting vegetables to frying fish, 5 tbsp of coconut oil (68g) is a versatile quantity.

It’s also perfect for coating <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/shrimp>shrimp</a> or tofu before air frying, giving them a deliciously crispy exterior.</p>

<p>5 tablespoons (tbsp) of coconut oil equals approximately 68 grams (g). This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precision matters, ensuring your dishes cook evenly and taste perfect every time. Whether you’re making crispy roasted vegetables or a decadent air-fried dessert, knowing the exact weight of coconut oil helps avoid guesswork.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of coconut oil can make or break your air fryer recipes. Too little, and your food might stick or dry out; too much, and it could become greasy. For example, when making air-fried chicken or crispy potatoes, 5 tbsp of coconut oil (68g) provides just enough fat for a golden, crunchy finish without overwhelming the dish. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more handy measurement swaps.</p>  

<p>Coconut oil is a popular choice for air frying because of its high smoke point and subtle flavour. Unlike butter, which burns easily, coconut oil remains stable at higher temperatures, making it ideal for air fryer cooking. Whether you’re preparing a savoury <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipe</a> or a sweet treat, measuring it correctly ensures consistent results.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure Coconut Oil for Air Fryer Recipes</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a kitchen scale, you can still measure 5 tbsp of coconut oil accurately. Solid coconut oil can be scooped and levelled with a spoon, while melted coconut oil should be poured into a measuring spoon. For best results, we recommend using grams for precision, especially when baking air fryer cakes or cookies where ratios are crucial.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for 5 Tbsp of Coconut Oil in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>From roasting vegetables to frying fish, 5 tbsp of coconut oil (68g) is a versatile quantity. For instance, tossing potatoes in this amount ensures they crisp up beautifully without sticking to the basket. It’s also perfect for coating <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/shrimp>shrimp</a> or tofu before air frying, giving them a deliciously crispy exterior.</p>  

<p>Another great use is for making air-fried desserts like doughnuts or brownies. The 68g measurement helps bind ingredients while adding moisture. If you’re experimenting with new recipes, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a> has plenty of ideas to inspire you.</p>  

<h3>Tips for Storing and Using Coconut Oil in Your Air Fryer</h3>  
<p>To keep coconut oil fresh, store it in a cool, dark place. If it solidifies, gently warm it before measuring. Always clean your air fryer basket after using oily ingredients to prevent buildup—our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning guide</a> makes maintenance a breeze.</p>

<p>0.75 cups of brown sugar equals approximately 150 grams, making it easy to measure for your air fryer recipes. Whether you're baking cookies, cakes, or glazes, knowing this conversion ensures consistent results every time. Brown sugar’s moisture content means it packs differently than granulated sugar, so weighing it guarantees accuracy.

<h2>Why Measuring Brown Sugar Accurately Matters</h2>  
<p>Brown sugar’s sticky, dense texture means volume measurements can vary. Using grams instead of cups eliminates guesswork, especially in air fryer recipes where precision affects texture and browning. Too much sugar can lead to overly caramelised or burnt edges, while too little may leave baked goods dry. For perfect results, always weigh brown sugar when following recipes from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>.</p>  

<p>Different brands of brown sugar may also vary in moisture content, further affecting volume measurements. A kitchen scale ensures consistency, whether you’re making air fryer cookies or a sticky glaze for meats.

<h3>How to Measure 0.75 Cups of Brown Sugar Without a Scale</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a scale, spoon brown sugar into a measuring cup and level it off without packing it down. This method approximates 150 grams, though weighing is still more reliable. For air fryer recipes like cakes or muffins, slight variations can be forgiving, but for delicate desserts, precision is key.

<h2>Converting Other Sugar Measurements for Air Fryer Baking</h2>  
<p>Beyond 0.75 cups, here are common brown sugar conversions: 1 cup = 200 grams, ½ cup = 100 grams, and ¼ cup = 50 grams. These measurements help scale recipes up or down for your air fryer’s capacity. Whether you’re adapting a family-sized recipe or prepping meal-sized portions, accurate conversions prevent mishaps.

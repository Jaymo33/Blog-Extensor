Overloading an air fryer can lead to uneven cooking and longer times, so understanding pound equivalents is practical.</p>
<p>Another scenario involves frozen foods—many frozen products like chicken wings or vegetables are sold in kilogram packages, but air fryer recipes often list pound measurements. Converting 6.75 kg to pounds lets you adapt these recipes without hassle.

<p>25g of tomato paste equals approximately 0.88 ounces. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements can make all the difference. Whether you're making a rich pasta sauce or a flavourful marinade, knowing how to convert grams to ounces ensures your dish turns out perfectly every time. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we understand the importance of accurate measurements, especially when working with concentrated ingredients like tomato paste.</p>

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>
<p>Air fryers rely on precise cooking times and ingredient ratios to deliver consistent results. Using too much or too little tomato paste can alter the texture and flavour of your dish. For example, 25g of tomato paste is a common measurement in many recipes, and converting it correctly to ounces ensures you stay on track. If you're working with a recipe from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>our collection</a>, you'll want to get the measurements spot on for the best outcome.</p>
<p>Tomato paste is a concentrated ingredient, so even small discrepancies can have a big impact. Whether you're making a sauce for air-fried meatballs or a glaze for vegetables, knowing that 25g tomato paste to ounces is 0.88 helps you maintain balance. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for other common measurements you might need.</p>

<h2>How to measure 25g of tomato paste without scales</h2>
<p>Not everyone has kitchen scales handy, but there are easy ways to measure 25g of tomato paste. One tablespoon of tomato paste typically weighs around 15g, so 25g would be roughly one and two-thirds tablespoons. If you're using a teaspoon, remember that three teaspoons make up one tablespoon. This method isn't as precise as using scales, but it works in a pinch for your air fryer recipes.</p>
<p>Another handy tip is to look at the packaging. Many tomato paste tubes or cans have markings that show approximate weights. If you're using a 70g tube, 25g would be just over a third of the contents. For more tips on measuring ingredients for your air fryer, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable recipes section</a>, where precise measurements are key to perfect results.</p>

<h3>Converting other tomato paste quantities</h3>
<p>While we've focused on 25g tomato paste in ounces, you might need to convert other amounts. 50g of tomato paste equals about 1.76 ounces, while 100g converts to approximately 3.53 ounces. These conversions are useful when scaling recipes up or down for your air fryer. Remember that tomato paste is dense, so volume measurements (like cups) aren't as accurate as weight measurements.</p>

<h2>Storing leftover tomato paste</h2>
<p>After measuring out your 25g of tomato paste, you'll likely have some left over. Proper storage is crucial to maintain freshness. Transfer any unused paste to an airtight container and refrigerate for up to a week. For longer storage, freeze tablespoon-sized portions on a baking sheet, then transfer to a freezer bag. These frozen portions are perfect for future air fryer recipes when you need just a small amount.</p>
<p>If you're looking for ways to use up leftover tomato paste, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipes section</a>, where tomato paste often features in marinades and sauces. Keeping your kitchen organised with properly stored ingredients makes cooking with your air fryer much more efficient.</p>

<h3>Tomato paste substitutes in air fryer recipes</h3>
<p>If you're out of tomato paste, you can substitute tomato sauce or puree by reducing the quantity and adjusting other liquids in your recipe. For 25g of tomato paste (0.88 ounces), you could use about 50g of tomato sauce, but simmer it first to thicken. This substitution works well in most air fryer recipes, though the flavour might be slightly less intense.

<p>0.5 tbsp of crushed garlic equals approximately 7 grams. This measurement is essential for precise cooking, especially when using an air fryer where ingredient ratios can affect texture and flavour. Whether you're following a recipe from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> or experimenting with your own creations, knowing exact weights ensures consistent results every time.</p>

<h2>Why accurate garlic measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>
<p>Garlic is a powerful ingredient that can easily overpower a dish if used incorrectly. In air fryer recipes, where cooking times are shorter and temperatures higher, precise measurements become even more critical. Too much garlic can lead to bitter or burnt flavours, while too little might leave your dish lacking depth. That's why converting 0.5 tbsp of crushed garlic to grams (about 7g) helps maintain balance in your cooking.</p>
<p>Many air fryer enthusiasts swear by our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for these exact scenarios. Whether you're making garlic bread, marinades, or roasted vegetables, having the right amount of garlic ensures perfect results. The compact cooking space of an air fryer means flavours concentrate more intensely than in conventional ovens, making measurement accuracy doubly important.</p>

<h3>How to measure 0.5 tbsp of crushed garlic accurately</h3>
<p>For the most precise measurement, use a digital kitchen scale to weigh out your crushed garlic. If you don't have scales, lightly pack your measuring spoon without compressing the garlic too much. Remember that 0.5 tbsp equals about 7 grams, which is roughly equivalent to one medium-sized garlic clove when crushed. This conversion works perfectly for UK measurements and most air fryer recipes.</p>

<h2>Common uses for 0.5 tbsp crushed garlic in air fryer recipes</h2>
<p>This quantity of garlic (0.5 tbsp or 7g) features in countless air fryer dishes. It's the perfect amount for seasoning chicken wings, making garlic butter for bread, or creating marinades for vegetables. Many of our popular <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> call for this exact measurement to achieve balanced flavours without overwhelming other ingredients.</p>
<p>When preparing garlic-heavy dishes like garlic mushrooms or roasted garlic potatoes in your air fryer, you might need to adjust quantities slightly. The concentrated heat can intensify garlic's flavour, so starting with 0.5 tbsp (7g) and adjusting to taste is often the best approach. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable recipe category</a> for inspiration on using this versatile ingredient.</p>

<h3>Storing crushed garlic for future use</h3>
<p>If you've crushed more garlic than needed, proper storage ensures you can use it later without losing flavour. Transfer any leftover crushed garlic to an airtight container and refrigerate for up to two weeks. For longer storage, freeze measured portions (like 0.5 tbsp/7g amounts) in ice cube trays. This method works brilliantly for air fryer cooks who want ready-measured garlic on hand.</p>

<h2>Converting other garlic measurements to grams</h2>
<p>While we've focused on 0.5 tbsp of crushed garlic (7g), you might need other conversions too. One whole tablespoon of crushed garlic equals about 14 grams, while a teaspoon is roughly 4.7 grams. These conversions are particularly useful when scaling air fryer recipes up or down. Our comprehensive <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a> covers all these measurements and more.</p>
<p>Remember that garlic's potency can vary depending on its freshness and how finely it's crushed. That's why weighing your garlic (rather than just using volume measurements) often yields more consistent results in air fryer cooking. Whether you're making garlic-infused oils or seasoning meats, knowing that 0.5 tbsp equals 7 grams gives you a reliable starting point.</p>

<h3>Cleaning your air fryer after cooking with garlic</h3>
<p>Garlic's strong aroma can linger in your air fryer if not cleaned properly. After cooking with 0.5 tbsp of crushed garlic (or any amount), wipe down the basket and interior with a mild soap solution. For stubborn smells, try our recommended <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner</a> solutions that remove odours without damaging non-stick surfaces. Regular cleaning ensures your next batch of air-fried goodies tastes exactly as intended.</p>

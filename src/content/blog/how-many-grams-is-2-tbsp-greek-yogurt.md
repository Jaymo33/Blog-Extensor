<p>2 tablespoons (tbsp) of greek yogurt weigh approximately 30 grams in the UK. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements can make or break a dish. Whether you’re whipping up a healthy breakfast or a creamy dessert, knowing the exact weight ensures consistency.

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Using the correct amount of ingredients, like greek yogurt, ensures your air fryer dishes turn out perfectly every time. Too much or too little can affect texture, cooking time, and even flavour. For example, adding 30 grams of greek yogurt to a marinade keeps chicken moist, while deviating might lead to dryness. Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> for dishes that rely on precise measurements.</p>  

<p>Greek yogurt is a versatile ingredient, often used in dips, sauces, and baked goods. Its thickness means volume-to-weight conversions differ from regular yogurt. If you’re converting 2 tbsp of greek yogurt to grams, always use a kitchen scale for accuracy. This is especially important for air fryer baking, where ratios impact rise and texture.</p>  

<h3>How to measure greek yogurt without a scale</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a scale, use a standard UK tablespoon (15ml) and level it off for an approximate 30-gram measure. However, for air fryer recipes, we recommend weighing for precision. A slight variation can affect recipes like air fryer cakes or marinades.

<h2>Common uses for greek yogurt in air fryer recipes</h2>  
<p>Greek yogurt adds creaminess and protein to many air fryer dishes. From marinades for <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipes</a> to binding agents in baked goods, its role is versatile. For instance, 30 grams (2 tbsp) can tenderise meat or replace mayo in healthier dips. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert category</a> for yogurt-based treats.</p>  

<p>Another popular use is in air fryer breakfasts, like yogurt parfaits or pancake batter. The 30-gram measurement ensures the right consistency for fluffy results. Whether you’re meal prepping or cooking for one, accurate conversions save time and reduce waste.

<p>200g of crushed garlic equals approximately 7.05 ounces. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements can make or break a dish. Whether you're whipping up garlic-infused chicken or a flavourful vegetable stir-fry, knowing the exact weight ensures consistency. For more handy conversions, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on even cooking, and incorrect ingredient quantities can lead to uneven results. Too much garlic might overpower the dish, while too little could leave it bland. Crushed garlic, in particular, has a strong flavour, so getting the 200g to ounces conversion right is crucial. If you're new to air frying, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a> offers plenty of inspiration.</p>  

<p>Garlic’s density can vary slightly depending on how finely it’s crushed, but 200g generally translates to just over 7 ounces. For best results, use a kitchen scale for precision. If you don’t have one, measuring spoons can work in a pinch—though scales are more reliable. Need cleaning tips for sticky garlic residue?

<h3>How to measure 200g of crushed garlic without a scale</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a scale, you can estimate 200g of crushed garlic using volume. Roughly, 200g equals about 12-14 tablespoons, but this can vary based on how tightly packed the garlic is. For air fryer recipes, consistency is key, so investing in a scale is worthwhile. Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable recipes</a> for garlic-heavy dishes.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for 200g of crushed garlic in air fryer recipes</h2>  
<p>From garlic butter shrimp to roasted potatoes, 200g of crushed garlic adds bold flavour. This amount is perfect for marinades or seasoning proteins like chicken or lamb. For a quick meal, toss 200g of crushed garlic with olive oil and veggies before air frying. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipes</a> for garlicky inspiration.</p>  

<p>Remember, 200g of crushed garlic (7.05 ounces) is quite potent, so adjust to taste if you prefer milder flavours. Air fryers intensify garlic’s aroma, so a little goes a long way. For more tips on balancing flavours, visit <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>.</p>

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on hot air circulation to cook food evenly, and small variations in ingredient quantities can affect the outcome. Using the correct weight for 1 tbsp of BBQ sauce (15 grams) helps avoid overly saucy or dry dishes. This is especially important for sticky sauces like BBQ, which can caramelise quickly in the air fryer. For perfect results every time, measure your ingredients carefully. Explore more <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> to put your measurements to good use.</p>  

<p>Many air fryer enthusiasts overlook the importance of converting volume to weight, but it’s a game-changer for consistency. A slightly heaped tablespoon of BBQ sauce could add unnecessary moisture, while a scant one might leave your dish lacking flavour. By sticking to 15 grams per tablespoon, you’ll achieve balanced results. This precision is particularly useful for batch cooking or meal prep.</p>  

<h2>How to measure 1 tbsp of BBQ sauce accurately</h2>  
<p>For the most accurate measurement, use digital kitchen scales to weigh your BBQ sauce. Place a small bowl on the scales, tare it to zero, then add the sauce until it reaches 15 grams. If you don’t have scales, use a proper UK tablespoon measure (not a dessert spoon) and level it off with a knife. Remember that different BBQ sauce brands may vary slightly in density, so weighing is always best.</p>  

<h3>Tips for using BBQ sauce in your air fryer</h3>  
<p>BBQ sauce works brilliantly in the air fryer, but timing is key. Apply it during the last 3-5 minutes of cooking to prevent burning. For sticky glazes, thin the sauce slightly with water or apple juice to help it spread evenly. Always preheat your air fryer for best results, and consider using <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner</a> afterwards to remove any caramelised residue.</p>  

<h2>Converting other BBQ sauce measurements</h2>  
<p>If your recipe calls for different quantities, here are some handy conversions: 1 teaspoon of BBQ sauce equals about 5 grams, while 1/4 cup is roughly 60 grams. These measurements are useful when scaling recipes up or down. For larger batches, remember that 100 grams of BBQ sauce equals approximately 6.5 tablespoons.

<p>When working with thick sauces like BBQ, it’s worth noting that temperature affects viscosity. Cold sauce from the fridge will measure differently to room temperature sauce. For consistent results, let your BBQ sauce sit out for 10 minutes before measuring. This is particularly important when making marinades or glazes for air fryer dishes.</p>  

<h3>Common mistakes when measuring BBQ sauce</h3>  
<p>The biggest mistake is using the wrong type of spoon – a UK tablespoon holds 15ml, while US tablespoons are slightly smaller at 14.8ml. Another error is eyeballing the measurement rather than using proper tools. For sticky sauces, always use the dip-and-sweep method: dip the spoon in, let excess drip off, then level with a knife. This ensures you get exactly 15 grams per tablespoon.</p>  

<p>Storing your BBQ sauce correctly also affects measurements. Always keep the bottle tightly sealed to prevent evaporation, which could concentrate the sauce and alter its weight. If you notice separation, give the bottle a good shake before measuring. For more cooking tips and conversions, visit <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> regularly.</p>

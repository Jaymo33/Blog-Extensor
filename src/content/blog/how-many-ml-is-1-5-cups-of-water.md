<h2>How to Measure 1.5 Cups of Water Without a Measuring Cup</h2>  
<p>If you don’t have a measuring cup, you can still measure 355 ml of water using a kitchen scale or common household items. One ml of water weighs roughly one gram, so 355 ml equals 355 grams. Alternatively, a standard UK mug holds about 300 ml, so 1.5 cups would be slightly more than one full mug.</p>  

<h3>Using a Kitchen Scale for Precision</h3>  
<p>For the most accurate results, weigh your water using a digital scale. Set your scale to grams, tare it with your container, then pour water until it reaches 355 grams. This method eliminates guesswork and is ideal for baking recipes where precision is key.

<h2>US vs. UK Cup Measurements</h2>

However, most modern recipes use the US standard (240 ml per cup), making 1.5 cups equal to 355 ml. Always check your recipe’s origin to avoid confusion.</p>  

<h3>Adjusting Recipes for Your Air Fryer</h3>

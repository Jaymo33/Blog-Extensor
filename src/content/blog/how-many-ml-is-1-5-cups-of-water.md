<p>1.5 cups of water equals 355 millilitres (ml). This conversion is essential for precise cooking, especially when using an air fryer where measurements can make or break a recipe. Whether you’re baking, steaming, or preparing sauces, knowing how many ml is 1.5 cups of water ensures consistency and perfect results every time.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on precise ingredient ratios to deliver crispy, evenly cooked dishes. Using the correct amount of water—like 355 ml for 1.5 cups—prevents soggy or dry outcomes. For example, adding too much water to an air fryer cake batter can lead to uneven cooking, while too little might dry out your dish. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for other handy measurements.</p>  

<p>Many air fryer recipes, like steamed vegetables or poached eggs, require exact water measurements. If you’re adapting a traditional recipe for your air fryer, converting cups to ml ensures accuracy. This is particularly useful for UK cooks, where metric measurements are standard. Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> for inspiration on dishes that benefit from precise water measurements.</p>  

<h2>How to Measure 1.5 Cups of Water Without a Measuring Cup</h2>  
<p>If you don’t have a measuring cup, you can still measure 355 ml of water using a kitchen scale or common household items. One ml of water weighs roughly one gram, so 355 ml equals 355 grams. Alternatively, a standard UK mug holds about 300 ml, so 1.5 cups would be slightly more than one full mug.</p>  

<h3>Using a Kitchen Scale for Precision</h3>  
<p>For the most accurate results, weigh your water using a digital scale. Set your scale to grams, tare it with your container, then pour water until it reaches 355 grams. This method eliminates guesswork and is ideal for baking recipes where precision is key. Visit our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>cake recipes</a> for air fryer-friendly desserts that rely on exact measurements.</p>  

<h2>US vs. UK Cup Measurements</h2>  
<p>It’s worth noting that US and UK cups differ slightly. A US cup is 240 ml, while a UK cup is 250 ml. For 1.5 cups, this means 360 ml in the US and 375 ml in the UK. However, most modern recipes use the US standard (240 ml per cup), making 1.5 cups equal to 355 ml. Always check your recipe’s origin to avoid confusion.</p>  

<h3>Adjusting Recipes for Your Air Fryer</h3>  
<p>When converting oven or stovetop recipes for your air fryer, precise liquid measurements are crucial. Too much water can create excess steam, affecting crispiness, while too little may dry out your food. For example, when making <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>air-fried vegetables</a>, the right water quantity ensures perfect texture. Always measure carefully for best results.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for 1.5 Cups of Water in Air Fryer Recipes</h2>  
<p>From steaming to baking, 355 ml of water is a versatile measurement in air fryer cooking. It’s often used for steaming dumplings, poaching eggs, or creating a water bath for delicate desserts. Some savoury dishes, like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>air-fried chicken</a>, also benefit from a small water addition to keep the meat moist.</p>

Use our guide on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaning</a> to maintain your appliance.

Whether you're making cakes, cookies, or even savoury dishes, knowing how to convert grams to ounces ensures consistency in your recipes.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate sugar measurements matter</h2>  
<p>Granulated sugar plays a crucial role in both texture and sweetness in recipes. Too much or too little can affect browning, moisture, and even cooking times in your air fryer.

Measuring 20g of granulated sugar correctly ensures your dishes turn out as intended.</p>

Keep this in mind when following recipes from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> or other sources.</p>

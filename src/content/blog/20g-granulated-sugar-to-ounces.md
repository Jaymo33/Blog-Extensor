<p>20g of granulated sugar equals approximately 0.705 ounces. This conversion is essential for precise baking and cooking, especially when using an air fryer where measurements can impact texture and taste. Whether you're making cakes, cookies, or even savoury dishes, knowing how to convert grams to ounces ensures consistency in your recipes.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate sugar measurements matter</h2>  
<p>Granulated sugar plays a crucial role in both texture and sweetness in recipes. Too much or too little can affect browning, moisture, and even cooking times in your air fryer. For example, a <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>cookie recipe</a> with too much sugar might spread too thin, while too little could leave it dense. Measuring 20g of granulated sugar correctly ensures your dishes turn out as intended.</p>  

<p>Many UK recipes use grams, but if your kitchen scales only display ounces, knowing the conversion is a lifesaver. A digital scale with both units is ideal, but if you're in a pinch, 20g granulated sugar to ounces is roughly 0.705 oz. Keep this in mind when following recipes from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> or other sources.</p>  

<h2>How to measure 20g of granulated sugar without scales</h2>  
<p>If you don’t have a scale, you can still measure 20g of granulated sugar using tablespoons. One level tablespoon holds about 12.5g of granulated sugar, so 20g is roughly 1.6 tablespoons. However, this method isn’t as precise as weighing, so for best results, invest in a digital scale.</p>  

<h3>Using a conversion chart</h3>  
<p>For quick reference, bookmark our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>, which includes common ingredient weights. This makes it easy to switch between grams and ounces, especially when adapting recipes for your air fryer. Granulated sugar is a staple in many <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert recipes</a>, so having accurate conversions ensures perfect results every time.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for 20g of granulated sugar</h2>  
<p>20g of granulated sugar is a common measurement in small-batch recipes, such as mug cakes, single-serving desserts, or glazes for air-fried treats. It’s also useful for balancing flavours in savoury dishes, like a sweet and sticky <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken glaze</a>. Whether you're baking or cooking, precise measurements help achieve the right taste and texture.</p>

<p>5 tablespoons (tbsp) of ginger paste equals approximately 75 grams (g). This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements can make all the difference in flavour and texture. Whether you're whipping up a marinade or adding a punch to your stir-fry, knowing the exact weight ensures consistency. For more handy conversions, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on even heat distribution, and incorrect ingredient quantities can throw off cooking times and results. Too much ginger paste might overpower your dish, while too little could leave it bland. Measuring by weight (grams) is more reliable than volume (tablespoons) because ginger paste can vary in density. For perfectly balanced flavours, always weigh your ingredients. Explore more <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> to put this tip into practice.</p>  

<p>Ginger paste is a staple in many cuisines, from Asian stir-fries to Middle Eastern marinades. Its concentrated flavour means a little goes a long way, so accuracy is key. If you're new to air frying, start with trusted measurements and adjust to taste. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipes</a> often feature ginger paste for a zesty kick.</p>  

<h3>How to measure ginger paste correctly</h3>  
<p>For the most accurate results, use a digital kitchen scale. Scoop the ginger paste into a small bowl on the scale and tare (zero) it before adding the paste. If you don’t have a scale, lightly pack the spoon and level it off with a knife. Avoid heaping tablespoons, as this can add extra grams unintentionally. Need more tips? Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning guide</a> ensures your tools stay precise.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for ginger paste in air fryer recipes</h2>  
<p>Ginger paste works wonders in marinades, sauces, and even baked goods. Try it in air-fried chicken wings, glazed salmon, or vegetable stir-fries. Its bold flavour pairs well with garlic, soy sauce, and honey for a balanced taste. For inspiration, browse our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable recipes</a> featuring ginger paste.</p>  

<p>Storing ginger paste properly ensures it stays fresh for future recipes. Keep it in an airtight container in the fridge for up to a month, or freeze it in ice cube trays for longer storage. This way, you’ll always have the right amount on hand for spontaneous cooking sessions. Visit <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> for more storage hacks.</p>

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on even heat distribution, and incorrect ingredient quantities can throw off cooking times and results. Too much ginger paste might overpower your dish, while too little could leave it bland. Measuring by weight (grams) is more reliable than volume (tablespoons) because ginger paste can vary in density. For perfectly balanced flavours, always weigh your ingredients.

If you don’t have a scale, lightly pack the spoon and level it off with a knife. Avoid heaping tablespoons, as this can add extra grams unintentionally. Need more tips?

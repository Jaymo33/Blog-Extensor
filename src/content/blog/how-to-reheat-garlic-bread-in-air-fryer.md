<p>Reheating garlic bread in an air fryer is simple: preheat to 160°C (320°F) and warm for 3–5 minutes until crispy. This method revives leftover garlic bread without drying it out, making it taste freshly baked. Whether you’re using store-bought or homemade garlic bread, the air fryer delivers even heat for perfect results every time.

<h2>Why Use an Air Fryer to Reheat Garlic Bread?</h2>  
<p>An air fryer circulates hot air around the garlic bread, ensuring even reheating without the sogginess you get from a microwave. The rapid airflow crisps the exterior while keeping the inside soft and buttery. Unlike conventional ovens, air fryers preheat quickly, saving time and energy. This makes them ideal for reheating small portions like leftover garlic bread.

<p>Another advantage is control—adjusting the temperature and time prevents burning or uneven heating. Whether your garlic bread is from the fridge or room temperature, the air fryer adapts effortlessly. Plus, it’s perfect for reheating garlic bread alongside other dishes, like those in our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable recipes</a>.</p>  

<h3>Best Temperature for Reheating Garlic Bread</h3>  
<p>160°C (320°F) is the sweet spot for reheating garlic bread in an air fryer. This temperature crisps the crust without overcooking the garlic butter layer. Higher temps risk burning, while lower ones leave the bread chewy. Always preheat the air fryer for consistent results—cold starts can lead to uneven reheating.</p>  

<h2>Step-by-Step Guide to Reheating Garlic Bread</h2>  
<p>First, preheat your air fryer to 160°C (320°F) for 3 minutes. Place the garlic bread in the basket in a single layer, avoiding overlap. Cook for 3–5 minutes, checking at the 3-minute mark to prevent over-browning. For extra crispiness, spritz lightly with oil before reheating. Need help with air fryer settings?

<p>If reheating multiple slices, work in batches to maintain airflow. Frozen garlic bread may need 5–7 minutes—no thawing required! For more frozen food tips, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/frozen-foods>frozen foods section</a>.</p>  

<h3>Tips to Prevent Dry or Soggy Garlic Bread</h3>  
<p>Cover the garlic bread with foil for the first 2 minutes if reheating from the fridge—this locks in moisture. Avoid overcrowding the basket, as trapped steam causes sogginess. For stale bread, brush with melted butter before reheating to revive its texture.

<h2>Common Mistakes When Reheating Garlic Bread</h2>  
<p>Overheating is the top mistake—garlic bread can go from crispy to burnt in seconds. Always set a timer and check frequently. Another error is stacking slices, which blocks airflow and creates uneven results. Using a too-high temperature (above 180°C) risks burning the garlic topping while leaving the bread cold inside.</p>  

<p>Skipping preheating is another pitfall—cold air fryers extend cooking time and dry out the bread. Finally, reheating garlic bread straight from the freezer without adjusting the time leads to a cold center. For perfect results, follow our tested timings and enjoy restaurant-quality garlic bread at home.</p>

<p>So, how many pounds is 1.25 kg beef joint? As we've established, it's 2.76 pounds. Now, let's apply this to air fryer cooking. A 2.76-pound beef joint will typically require about 25-30 minutes of cooking time in a preheated air fryer at 180°C, depending on your desired doneness. It's always best to use a meat thermometer to check the internal temperature, aiming for 55°C for rare, 60°C for medium, or 70°C for well-done. Let the meat rest for at least 10 minutes after cooking to allow the juices to redistribute.</p>
<p>Season your 1.25 kg beef joint generously with salt, pepper, and herbs before air frying to create a delicious crust. Placing the joint fat-side up in the air fryer basket will help the fat baste the meat as it cooks, resulting in a more flavourful and moist roast. For easy cleanup after cooking your juicy roast, consider using our recommended <a href="https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner">air fryer cleaner</a>.

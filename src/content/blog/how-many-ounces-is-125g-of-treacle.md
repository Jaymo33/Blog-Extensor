<p>125g of treacle equals approximately 4.41 ounces. This conversion is essential for anyone using air fryer recipes that require precise measurements, especially when working with sticky ingredients like treacle. Whether you’re baking a sticky toffee pudding or glazing meats, knowing how to convert grams to ounces ensures your dish turns out perfectly every time.</p>  

<h2>Why Convert 125g of Treacle to Ounces?</h2>  
<p>Many UK recipes, especially those on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, use grams, but some kitchen scales or older cookbooks might still list ounces. Converting 125g of treacle to ounces (4.41 oz) helps avoid measurement mishaps. Treacle’s thick consistency makes it tricky to measure, so accuracy is key for consistent results in your air fryer dishes.</p>  
<p>If you’re using an air fryer for baking, like making treacle tart or gingerbread, precise measurements matter. A slight imbalance in wet ingredients can affect texture.

<h2>Common Mistakes When Measuring Treacle</h2>  
<p>One mistake is scooping treacle straight from the jar, which often leads to uneven amounts. Instead, pour it slowly into your measuring tool. Another error is forgetting to account for treacle’s weight when substituting it for other sweeteners like golden syrup or honey, which have different densities.</p>

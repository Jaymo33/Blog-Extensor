<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Using the correct amount of sugar syrup can affect the texture and taste of your air-fried dishes. Too much syrup can make food overly sticky, while too little might leave it dry. Air fryers cook food quickly, so precise measurements ensure even cooking. If you’re working with recipes like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>desserts</a>, this is especially important. Always measure ingredients like sugar syrup carefully for the best results.</p>  

<p>Many air fryer recipes call for sugar syrup as a glaze or sweetener. Knowing that 1.5 cups equals 12 ounces helps you adjust recipes easily. For a full guide on conversions, visit our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>. This ensures you never have to guess when adapting traditional recipes for your air fryer.</p>  

<h3>How to measure sugar syrup correctly</h3>  
<p>To measure sugar syrup accurately, use a liquid measuring cup for the best results. Pour the syrup slowly to avoid air bubbles, which can throw off your measurement. If you’re converting 1.5 cups to ounces, remember it’s roughly 12 ounces. For sticky ingredients like syrup, lightly greasing the measuring cup can help it slide out easily. This trick is handy when prepping <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>cake recipes</a> in your air fryer.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for sugar syrup in air fryer recipes</h2>  
<p>Sugar syrup is a versatile ingredient in air fryer cooking. It’s often used to glaze meats, sweeten desserts, or add moisture to baked goods. For example, a 1.5-cup (12-ounce) batch can be perfect for coating <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken wings</a> or drizzling over pastries. Since air fryers circulate hot air, the syrup caramelises beautifully, adding depth to your dishes.</p>  

<p>If you’re experimenting with homemade sauces, sugar syrup can balance acidity or spice. Just remember that 1.5 cups translates to 12 ounces, so adjust other ingredients accordingly.

<h3>Tips for working with sugar syrup in an air fryer</h3>  
<p>Sugar syrup can be messy, so lining your air fryer basket with parchment or a silicone liner helps with cleanup. Since 1.5 cups equals 12 ounces, you can easily scale recipes up or down. Avoid overheating syrup in the air fryer, as it can burn quickly. For sticky residues, use <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner</a> to maintain your appliance. Proper care ensures your air fryer stays in top condition for all your cooking needs.</p>

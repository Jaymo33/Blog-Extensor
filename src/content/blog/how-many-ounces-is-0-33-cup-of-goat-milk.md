<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of ingredients is crucial when cooking with an air fryer. Unlike traditional ovens, air fryers circulate hot air rapidly, which can affect cooking times and textures. A slight variation in liquid measurements, like goat milk, can alter the outcome of your recipe. For example, too much liquid might make your batter too runny, while too little could dry out your dish. That’s why converting 0.33 cup of goat milk to ounces (2.64 oz) helps maintain precision.</p>  

<p>If you’re working with air fryer recipes, especially baked goods or sauces, consistency is key. Goat milk adds richness and moisture, but the wrong amount can throw off the balance.

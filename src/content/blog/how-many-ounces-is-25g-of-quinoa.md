<p>25g of quinoa equals approximately 0.88 ounces. This conversion is handy for air fryer recipes, where precise measurements can make all the difference. Whether you're meal prepping or trying a new dish, knowing how to convert grams to ounces ensures your quinoa turns out perfectly every time.</p>

<h2>Why Convert 25g of Quinoa to Ounces?</h2>
<p>Many air fryer recipes, especially those from the UK, use grams as the standard measurement. However, some kitchen scales or recipe books might list ingredients in ounces. Converting 25g of quinoa to ounces (0.88 oz) helps you follow recipes accurately. This is particularly useful if you're using an American recipe or a scale that only measures in ounces.</p>
<p>Quinoa is a versatile ingredient that works brilliantly in air fryers. From crispy quinoa patties to fluffy side dishes, getting the measurements right is key. For more air fryer recipe ideas, check out <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>our collection</a>.</p>

<h2>How to Measure 25g of Quinoa</h2>
<p>If you don’t have a kitchen scale, you can use measuring spoons or cups to estimate 25g of quinoa. One tablespoon of quinoa weighs roughly 10g, so 2.5 tablespoons will give you close to 25g. For ounces, this translates to just under 0.88 oz. Remember, these are approximations, so a scale is always best for accuracy.</p>
<p>Using the right amount of quinoa ensures your air fryer dishes cook evenly. Too much or too little can affect texture and cooking time. For more tips on perfect air fryer meals, visit <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>our conversion chart</a>.</p>

<h3>Why Quinoa Works So Well in Air Fryers</h3>

<h2>Common Uses for 25g of Quinoa</h2>
<p>25g of quinoa might seem like a small amount, but it’s perfect for single servings or as part of a larger dish. You could use it to make a quinoa-stuffed pepper or as a base for a grain bowl. The air fryer can toast it lightly for added crunch, or cook it with broth for a fluffy texture.</p>

<h3>Tips for Cooking Quinoa in an Air Fryer</h3>

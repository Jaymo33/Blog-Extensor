<p>4 tablespoons (tbsp) of rice weighs approximately 60 grams. This measurement is essential for air fryer recipes, ensuring consistent results whether you're cooking rice dishes or using rice as an ingredient. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we know precise conversions help you nail every meal.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate rice measurements matter</h2>  
<p>Getting the right amount of rice ensures your air fryer dishes turn out perfectly. Too much rice can lead to uneven cooking, while too little might leave your meal dry. Whether you're making a stir-fry or a rice-based casserole, 4 tbsp of rice (60g) is a common starting point for single servings.</p>  
<p>Rice expands when cooked, so measuring it correctly prevents overflow in your air fryer basket.

This is especially useful if you're scaling recipes up or down for meal prep.</p>  

<h3>Types of rice and their weights</h3>  
<p>Not all rice weighs the same per tablespoon. Long-grain white rice averages 15g per tbsp, while brown rice can be slightly heavier at 16g. Short-grain or sticky rice may weigh up to 17g per tbsp. Always adjust if using specialty rice like basmati or jasmine.</p>  

<h2>How to measure rice for air fryer recipes</h2>  
<p>For the most accurate results, use a digital kitchen scale to weigh your rice. If you don't have one, spoon the rice lightly into a measuring tablespoon without packing it down. Level it off with a straight edge for consistency.</p>  
<p>Many air fryer recipes, like those in our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a>, specify weights rather than volumes for this reason. This eliminates guesswork and ensures your dishes turn out as intended every time.</p>  

<h3>Converting other rice measurements</h3>  
<p>If your recipe calls for cups instead of tablespoons, remember that 1 cup of uncooked rice is about 185g. That's roughly 12 tablespoons. For cooked rice, 4 tbsp equals about 90g since rice absorbs water during cooking.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for 4 tbsp of rice in air frying</h2>  
<p>This quantity is perfect for making single servings of rice bowls or as a base for <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable stir-fries</a>. You can also use it to create crispy rice cakes or as a filler for stuffed peppers. The air fryer gives rice a delightful texture you can't achieve with traditional methods.</p>  
<p>For cleaning up after rice dishes, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner guide</a> has you covered. Rice can sometimes stick to the basket, so proper maintenance keeps your appliance in top condition.</p>  

<h3>Storing measured rice portions</h3>  
<p>If you meal prep with rice, consider pre-measuring 4 tbsp (60g) portions into containers. This makes it easy to grab exactly what you need for quick air fryer meals throughout the week. Cooked rice freezes well too - just add a splash of water when reheating in the air fryer.</p>

<p>2 cups of desiccated coconut equals approximately 5.3 ounces (150 grams). This conversion is essential for precise baking and air frying, ensuring your recipes turn out perfectly every time. Whether you're making coconut macaroons or adding texture to a dish, knowing the exact weight helps avoid mishaps.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter</h2>  
<p>Using the correct amount of desiccated coconut ensures consistency in your recipes. Too little, and your dish might lack flavour or texture; too much, and it could become dry or overly dense. Air fryer recipes, in particular, rely on precise measurements for even cooking. For more air fryer tips, check out <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>our conversion chart</a>.</p>  

<p>Desiccated coconut is a common ingredient in both sweet and savoury dishes. From cakes to curries, it adds a delightful crunch and tropical flavour. If you're new to air frying, explore <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>our recipe collection</a> for inspiration.</p>  

<h2>How to measure desiccated coconut</h2>  
<p>For the most accurate results, use a kitchen scale to weigh your desiccated coconut. If you don’t have one, lightly spoon the coconut into a measuring cup and level it off. Avoid packing it down, as this can lead to an incorrect measurement.</p>  

<h3>Converting cups to ounces for other ingredients</h3>  
<p>Different ingredients have varying densities, so their weight per cup differs. For example, 2 cups of flour weigh around 9 ounces, while 2 cups of sugar are about 14 ounces. Always refer to a reliable conversion guide for best results.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for desiccated coconut</h2>  
<p>Desiccated coconut is versatile and works well in both baking and cooking. Try it in air-fried desserts like coconut shrimp or as a topping for yoghurt. For more ideas, browse <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>our dessert recipes</a>.</p>  

<p>It’s also a great addition to granola, smoothie bowls, and even homemade energy bars. If you love tropical flavours, you’ll find plenty of ways to incorporate desiccated coconut into your meals.</p>  

<h2>Storing desiccated coconut</h2>  
<p>Keep your desiccated coconut fresh by storing it in an airtight container in a cool, dry place. For longer shelf life, refrigerate or freeze it. Proper storage ensures it stays flavourful and ready for your next culinary creation.</p>  

<h3>Cleaning your air fryer after using coconut</h3>  
<p>Desiccated coconut can leave behind tiny particles in your air fryer. To keep it in top condition, clean it regularly with <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>our recommended cleaner</a>. A well-maintained air fryer ensures better-tasting food every time.</p>

<p>260 ml of yogurt equals approximately 1.1 cups. This conversion is essential for precise baking and cooking, especially when using an air fryer. Whether you're whipping up a cake or a savoury dish, knowing exact measurements ensures perfect results every time.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Yogurt Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of yogurt can make or break a recipe. Too much can make baked goods dense, while too little can dry them out. For air fryer recipes, consistency is key—whether you're making <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>cakes</a> or marinating chicken. A slight variation in yogurt quantity can alter texture and taste.</p>

<p>Not everyone has a kitchen scale, but measuring cups are common. To measure 260 ml of yogurt, fill a standard measuring cup just over the 1-cup line. Since 1 cup equals 240 ml, you’ll need an extra 20 ml—roughly a tablespoon and a teaspoon.</p>  

<h3>Using Metric and Imperial Measurements</h3>  
<p>In the UK, metric measurements like millilitres are standard, while the US often uses cups. If you’re following a recipe from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, knowing both systems helps. For 260 ml of yogurt, 1.1 cups is the closest imperial equivalent.</p>

<h3>Adjusting Recipes for Different Yogurt Types</h3>  
<p>Greek yogurt is thicker than regular yogurt, so 260 ml will weigh more. If substituting, you may need to adjust liquids in the recipe. For air fryer cooking, thicker yogurts work better as coatings, while runnier yogurts are ideal for batters.</p>  

<h2>Cleaning Up After Measuring Yogurt</h2>  
<p>Yogurt can be sticky, so clean your measuring tools promptly. Use warm soapy water or our recommended <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner</a> for stubborn residue.

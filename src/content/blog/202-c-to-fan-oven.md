<p>202°C in a conventional oven converts to approximately 180°C in a fan oven. This 20°C reduction is standard when adapting recipes for fan-assisted cooking. The circulating hot air in fan ovens cooks food more efficiently, so lowering the temperature prevents over-browning or drying out your dishes.</p>

<p>When using an air fryer, which works similarly to a fan oven, you'll typically follow the same conversion principle. Many modern air fryers even have built-in fan oven settings, making temperature conversion effortless. For perfect results every time, always check your specific model's manual as some may vary slightly.</p>

<h2>Why Temperature Conversion Matters</h2>
<p>Understanding how to convert 202°C to fan oven settings ensures your baked goods and roasted dishes turn out perfectly. The circulating air in fan ovens distributes heat more evenly than conventional ovens, which means food cooks faster and more uniformly. This is particularly important for delicate items like cakes or pastries that might brown too quickly at higher temperatures.</p>

<p>At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we've tested countless recipes and found that most benefit from this standard 20°C reduction. Whether you're baking a Victoria sponge or roasting vegetables, maintaining the correct temperature relationship between conventional and fan ovens is key to culinary success. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> provides quick reference for all your cooking needs.</p>

<h2>Air Fryer Temperature Adjustments</h2>
<p>Modern air fryers essentially function as compact fan ovens, making the 202°C to 180°C conversion equally applicable. However, because air fryers are smaller and more intense, you might need to reduce cooking times by about 20% compared to conventional fan ovens. This prevents overcooking while still achieving that perfect crispness.</p>

<p>For those new to air frying, we recommend starting with our collection of <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>foolproof recipes</a> specifically tested for air fryer performance. Many users find they get better results at slightly lower temperatures than traditional fan ovens suggest, especially for items like chicken or potatoes that benefit from slower cooking.</p>

<h3>Special Considerations for Baking</h3>
<p>When converting 202°C for baking in a fan oven or air fryer, the type of dish matters significantly. Sponge cakes and delicate pastries often need the full 20°C reduction to prevent doming or uneven rising. For items like bread or pizza that benefit from intense heat, you might only reduce by 10-15°C instead.</p>

<h3>Meat and Vegetable Roasting Tips</h3>
<p>Roasting meats and vegetables at 180°C (converted from 202°C) in a fan oven yields excellent results with even browning. In an air fryer, you might find reducing the time by 5-10 minutes gives better texture. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable recipe collection</a> includes specific timing guides for popular dishes.</p>

<h2>Common Conversion Mistakes</h2>
<p>One frequent error when converting 202°C to fan oven settings is forgetting to adjust cooking times along with temperature. While the 20°C rule works well for temperature, fan ovens typically cook food 10-15% faster than conventional ovens. Always check your dish 5-10 minutes before the recipe's suggested time.</p>

<p>Another pitfall is assuming all fan ovens behave identically. Variations in oven size, fan strength, and heating element placement can affect performance. We recommend using an oven thermometer to verify your appliance's accuracy, especially when trying new recipes from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> or other sources.</p>

<h2>Cleaning and Maintenance Tips</h2>
<p>Maintaining your fan oven or air fryer at peak performance ensures accurate temperature control. Regular cleaning prevents built-up grease from affecting heat distribution. For stubborn air fryer cleaning jobs, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning guide</a> offers practical solutions to keep your appliance working like new.</p>

<p>Remember that temperature accuracy can drift over time as heating elements age. If you notice inconsistent results when converting 202°C to fan oven settings, it might be time for professional calibration or replacement of worn components. This is particularly important for serious bakers who rely on precise temperature control.</p>

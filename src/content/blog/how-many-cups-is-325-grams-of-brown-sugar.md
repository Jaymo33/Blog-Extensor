<p>325 grams of brown sugar equals approximately 1.6 cups in the UK or 1.5 cups in the US. This conversion is essential for baking and air fryer recipes where precision matters. Whether you're making cookies, cakes, or glazes, knowing how to measure 325 grams of brown sugar in cups ensures consistent results. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we help you nail every measurement for flawless cooking.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Getting the right amount of brown sugar can make or break your recipe. Too much can overpower flavours, while too little may leave your dish lacking sweetness. For air fryer recipes like sticky glazes or caramelised desserts, 325 grams of brown sugar must be measured precisely. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for other common ingredient conversions.</p>  

<p>Brown sugar is denser than granulated sugar, so volume measurements vary. Packing it tightly into a cup yields more than a loosely filled one. This is why weighing 325 grams of brown sugar ensures accuracy, especially in air fryer baking where even heat distribution relies on balanced ingredients.</p>  

<h2>UK vs US Cup Measurements</h2>  
<p>In the UK, 1 cup of brown sugar is roughly 200 grams, meaning 325 grams equals about 1.6 cups. In the US, a cup is around 220 grams, so 325 grams is closer to 1.5 cups. If you're following a recipe from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>our collection</a>, always check which measurement standard it uses.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure Brown Sugar Correctly</h3>  
<p>For the most accurate conversion of 325 grams of brown sugar to cups, use a kitchen scale. If you don’t have one, spoon the sugar into a measuring cup and level it off without packing it down. This method works well for air fryer recipes where consistency is key.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for 325 Grams of Brown Sugar</h2>  
<p>This amount is perfect for batches of cookies, crumbles, or BBQ glazes in your air fryer. For example, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cookies>cookie recipes</a> often call for 325 grams of brown sugar to achieve that perfect chewiness. It’s also ideal for marinades or sticky sauces that caramelise beautifully under the air fryer’s high heat.</p>  

<p>If you’re experimenting with desserts, 325 grams of brown sugar can sweeten a small cake or a tray of roasted fruits. For savoury dishes, it balances spices in rubs or glazes. Always store leftover brown sugar in an airtight container to keep it fresh for future <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert creations</a>.</p>  

<h3>Tips for Working with Brown Sugar</h3>  
<p>To prevent clumping, add a slice of bread to your sugar container. If your 325 grams of brown sugar has hardened, microwave it briefly or place it in a sealed bag with a damp paper towel. These tricks ensure your air fryer recipes turn out perfectly every time.</p>  

<h2>Converting Other Sugar Amounts</h2>  
<p>Need to adjust your recipe? Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a> covers everything from 100 grams to 500 grams. Whether you’re scaling up or down, knowing how many cups 325 grams of brown sugar equals helps maintain recipe integrity. For more tips, explore our guides on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>keeping your air fryer spotless</a> between uses.</p>

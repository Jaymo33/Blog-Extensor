<p>0.375 cup of ginger paste equals approximately 3 ounces. This conversion is essential for precise cooking, especially when using an air fryer where ingredient measurements can impact texture and flavour. Whether you're following a recipe from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> or experimenting with your own dishes, knowing the exact weight ensures consistent results.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate ginger paste measurements matter</h2>  
<p>Ginger paste adds a punch of flavour to dishes, but too much or too little can throw off your recipe. In an air fryer, where cooking times are shorter, precise measurements help avoid overpowering or underwhelming results. For example, a dish like air-fried ginger chicken from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>our recipe collection</a> relies on the right balance of ginger paste for the perfect taste.</p>  

<p>Using 0.375 cup of ginger paste (or 3 ounces) ensures you get the intended flavour without wasting ingredients. This measurement is particularly useful for marinades, sauces, and rubs where ginger paste plays a starring role.

<h3>How to measure ginger paste correctly</h3>  
<p>For the most accurate measurement, use a kitchen scale to weigh your ginger paste. If you don't have one, spoon the paste into a measuring cup and level it off with a straight edge. Remember that ginger paste can vary in density, so weighing is always best for precision.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for 0.375 cup ginger paste</h2>  
<p>This quantity of ginger paste (3 ounces) is perfect for many air fryer recipes. It's enough to marinate 4-6 chicken thighs or create a flavourful glaze for vegetables. You'll find plenty of inspiration in our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipe category</a>, where ginger paste features prominently.</p>  

<p>Beyond meats, 0.375 cup of ginger paste works wonderfully in vegetarian dishes too. Try it in an air-fried tofu stir-fry or as part of a marinade for roasted vegetables. The versatility of this measurement makes it a kitchen staple for air fryer enthusiasts.</p>  

<h3>Storing leftover ginger paste</h3>  
<p>If you have leftover ginger paste after measuring out your 0.375 cup (3 ounces), store it in an airtight container in the fridge. It will keep for about 2 weeks, ready for your next air fryer creation. For longer storage, freeze portions in ice cube trays.</p>  

<h2>Converting other ginger paste measurements</h2>

<h3>Ginger paste substitutes in a pinch</h3>

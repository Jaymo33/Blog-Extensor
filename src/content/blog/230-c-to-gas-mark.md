<p>230 C converts to Gas Mark 8, a common setting for roasting meats, baking pastries, and achieving crispy results in both ovens and air fryers. This temperature is ideal for dishes that need a high heat to develop colour and texture, from Sunday roasts to flaky pastries. Whether you're using a conventional oven or an air fryer, knowing this conversion ensures your recipes turn out perfectly every time. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we specialise in helping you adapt oven recipes for air fryers with ease. Let’s dive deeper into why this conversion matters and how to use it effectively.</p>

<h2>Why 230 C to Gas Mark 8 Matters for Cooking</h2>
<p>Gas Mark 8 (230 C) is a versatile high-heat setting used for everything from Yorkshire puddings to crispy roast potatoes. In traditional ovens, this temperature ensures even browning, while air fryers achieve similar results with faster cooking times due to their powerful convection technology. Many classic British recipes, like sausage rolls or homemade bread, rely on this temperature for the perfect rise and crunch. If you're adapting an oven recipe for your air fryer, you might reduce the cooking time by 20% but keep the temperature the same.

<p>Understanding 230 C to Gas Mark is especially useful when following older cookbooks or recipes that use gas markings. Modern air fryers often display temperatures in Celsius or Fahrenheit, so knowing the Gas Mark equivalent helps bridge the gap between appliances. This ensures consistency whether you're baking a Victoria sponge or crisping up frozen chips. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes</a>, you’ll find plenty of dishes tailored to this temperature, from savoury mains to sweet treats.</p>

<h3>How to Adjust 230 C in an Air Fryer</h3>
<p>Air fryers cook faster than conventional ovens, so while the temperature (230 C or Gas Mark 8) remains the same, timing adjustments are key. For example, roasted vegetables that take 40 minutes in an oven might need just 25–30 minutes in an air fryer. Preheat your air fryer for 3–5 minutes at 230 C to mimic the steady heat of a gas oven. If you’re cooking frozen foods like chicken nuggets or spring rolls, refer to packaging instructions but expect shorter cook times. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipe category</a> includes several 230 C favourites optimised for air fryers.</p>

<h2>Common Dishes Cooked at 230 C (Gas Mark 8)</h2>
<p>This high heat is perfect for dishes that benefit from a crispy exterior and tender interior. Think roast dinners with crackling pork belly, golden puff pastry pies, or even homemade baguettes. In an air fryer, 230 C excels at reheating leftovers like pizza or fried chicken, restoring their crunch without drying them out. For baking, scones and biscuits develop a lovely rise and colour at this temperature. Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/potatoes>potato recipes</a> for ideas like hasselback potatoes or crispy wedges, all tailored to 230 C.</p>

<p>Gas Mark 8 is also a go-to for frozen foods like oven chips or chicken kievs, ensuring they crisp up evenly. In air fryers, you might need to shake the basket halfway through cooking to promote even browning. For delicate items like fish fillets or tofu, consider lowering the temperature slightly to avoid overcooking the exterior. Always use a meat thermometer for proteins to ensure safe internal temperatures. Need to clean your air fryer after high-heat cooking?

<h3>Tips for Baking at 230 C to Gas Mark 8</h3>
<p>When baking at this temperature, use light-coloured metal pans to prevent over-browning, and rotate trays halfway for even heat distribution. In air fryers, avoid overcrowding the basket to allow proper air circulation—this is crucial for achieving that all-over crispness. For pastries, a light egg wash brushed on before cooking enhances colour at 230 C. If adapting a cake recipe, reduce the sugar slightly to prevent excessive caramelisation. Remember, air fryers vary by model, so keep an eye on your first few bakes to nail the timing.</p>

<h2>Converting Other Temperatures to Gas Mark</h2>
<p>While 230 C to Gas Mark 8 is a handy benchmark, it’s useful to know nearby conversions too. For instance, 220 C is Gas Mark 7, and 240 C jumps to Gas Mark 9. These increments matter for precision baking, where even small temperature changes affect texture. Air fryers typically offer finer control, so you can dial in exactly 230 C without guessing between gas marks.

<p>Older ovens may have slight variations in Gas Mark accuracy, so an oven thermometer can help verify 230 C. In contrast, air fryers’ digital thermostats tend to be more reliable. Whether you’re using gas, electric, or air fryer settings, understanding these conversions empowers you to cook with confidence. From Sunday roasts to midweek bakes, mastering 230 C to Gas Mark 8 opens up a world of culinary possibilities.</p>

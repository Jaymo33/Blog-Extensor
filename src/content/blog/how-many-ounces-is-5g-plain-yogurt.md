<p>5g of plain yogurt equals approximately 0.18 ounces. This conversion is handy for air fryer recipes where precise measurements matter. Whether you're making dips, marinades, or baked goods, knowing how to convert grams to ounces ensures consistency. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we focus on accurate measurements for perfect results every time.</p>  

<h2>Why Convert 5g of Plain Yogurt to Ounces?</h2>  
<p>Many UK recipes use grams, but ounces are still common in older cookbooks or international guides. Converting 5g of plain yogurt to ounces (0.18 oz) helps avoid guesswork. This is especially useful for air fryer recipes, where ingredient ratios affect texture and cooking times. For more conversions, check our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>  

<p>Yogurt is a versatile ingredient in air fryer cooking, from tenderising meats to adding moisture to cakes. Measuring 5g accurately ensures your dish turns out as intended. Whether you're preparing a <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken marinade</a> or a healthy dip, precision matters.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure 5g of Plain Yogurt</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a digital scale, use measuring spoons for small amounts like 5g. A teaspoon holds roughly 5g of yogurt, but this can vary with density. For exact measurements, invest in a kitchen scale—it’s a game-changer for air fryer cooking. Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a> for ideas using yogurt.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for 5g of Plain Yogurt in Air Fryer Recipes</h2>  
<p>Even small amounts of yogurt, like 5g, can enhance air fryer dishes. It’s great for binding coatings on chicken or fish, adding creaminess to sauces, or lightening up baked goods. For example, a <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert recipe</a> might call for 5g to balance acidity without overpowering flavours.</p>  

<p>Yogurt also helps reduce oil usage in air fryer cooking, making meals healthier. A 5g portion can be mixed with herbs for a quick dip or brushed onto flatbreads before air frying.

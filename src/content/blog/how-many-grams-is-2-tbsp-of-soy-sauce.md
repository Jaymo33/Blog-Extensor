<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on even cooking, and incorrect measurements can lead to uneven results. Too much soy sauce might make your dish overly salty, while too little could leave it bland. Grams provide a more precise measurement than tablespoons, especially for liquids like soy sauce. If you’re experimenting with new recipes, always measure ingredients like soy sauce by weight for the best outcome.

<p>Many UK cooks prefer using grams for accuracy, as tablespoon sizes can vary slightly. A standard UK tablespoon holds about 15ml, but soy sauce’s density means 2 tbsp equals roughly 30 grams. This conversion is particularly useful for meal prepping or scaling recipes.

<h3>How to measure soy sauce without scales</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have kitchen scales, use a liquid measuring spoon for soy sauce. Fill it to the brim without spilling, and level it off for accuracy.

<h3>Storing soy sauce for air fryer meals</h3>  
<p>Keep soy sauce in a cool, dark place to maintain its flavour. Once opened, refrigerate it to extend its shelf life. Always check for freshness before using it in your air fryer recipes. If the colour darkens significantly or the smell changes, it’s time to replace it. Proper storage ensures your 2 tbsp (30g) measurements stay consistent.</p>

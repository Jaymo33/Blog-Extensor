<p>2 tablespoons (tbsp) of soy sauce weigh approximately 30 grams. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements can make or break a dish. Whether you’re marinating chicken, glazing salmon, or adding depth to a stir-fry, knowing the exact weight ensures consistency. For more air fryer conversions, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on even cooking, and incorrect measurements can lead to uneven results. Too much soy sauce might make your dish overly salty, while too little could leave it bland. Grams provide a more precise measurement than tablespoons, especially for liquids like soy sauce. If you’re experimenting with new recipes, always measure ingredients like soy sauce by weight for the best outcome. Visit our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipes section</a> for perfectly balanced dishes.</p>  

<p>Many UK cooks prefer using grams for accuracy, as tablespoon sizes can vary slightly. A standard UK tablespoon holds about 15ml, but soy sauce’s density means 2 tbsp equals roughly 30 grams. This conversion is particularly useful for meal prepping or scaling recipes. For more tips on air fryer meal prep, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/meal-prep>meal prep category</a>.</p>  

<h3>How to measure soy sauce without scales</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have kitchen scales, use a liquid measuring spoon for soy sauce. Fill it to the brim without spilling, and level it off for accuracy. Remember, 2 tbsp of soy sauce is about 30 grams, so you can eyeball it if needed. For sticky sauces, lightly grease the spoon to ensure all the liquid pours out. Check out our guide on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning your air fryer</a> after working with sticky ingredients.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for soy sauce in air fryer recipes</h2>  
<p>Soy sauce is a staple in air fryer cooking, adding umami to meats, veggies, and even tofu. Try it in a marinade for air-fried chicken or as a glaze for crispy salmon. For vegetarian options, drizzle soy sauce over air-fried mushrooms or tofu for extra flavour. Discover more ideas in our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/tofu>tofu recipes</a>.</p>  

<p>When substituting soy sauce, remember that 2 tbsp (30g) of soy sauce can be replaced with tamari or coconut aminos in the same weight. Adjust other seasonings accordingly, as these alternatives may vary in saltiness. Always taste as you go to avoid over-seasoning.

<h3>Storing soy sauce for air fryer meals</h3>  
<p>Keep soy sauce in a cool, dark place to maintain its flavour. Once opened, refrigerate it to extend its shelf life. Always check for freshness before using it in your air fryer recipes. If the colour darkens significantly or the smell changes, it’s time to replace it. Proper storage ensures your 2 tbsp (30g) measurements stay consistent.</p>

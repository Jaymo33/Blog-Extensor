<p>335 ml of water equals approximately 1.42 cups. Whether you're baking, cooking, or prepping ingredients for your air fryer, knowing this conversion ensures accuracy in your recipes. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we understand how precise measurements can make or break a dish, especially when using an air fryer.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on precise ingredient ratios to achieve the perfect texture and doneness. Too much or too little liquid can affect cooking times and results. For example, adding 335 ml of water instead of 1.42 cups might seem minor, but it can lead to soggy or unevenly cooked food.

<p>Many air fryer recipes, like cakes or steamed dishes, require exact liquid measurements. If you're working with 335 ml of water, using a measuring cup marked with metric and imperial units ensures consistency. This is especially useful for recipes from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>our collection</a>, where precision is key.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure 335 ml of Water Without a Measuring Cup</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a measuring cup, you can use a standard mug or glass, but keep in mind that sizes vary. A UK metric cup holds 250 ml, so 335 ml is roughly 1 and 1/3 cups plus a tablespoon. For best results, invest in a kitchen scale or a jug with clear ml and cup markings.</p>  

<h2>Converting 335 ml of Water for Baking and Cooking</h2>  
<p>When adapting recipes for your air fryer, converting 335 ml of water to cups ensures you stay on track. For example, if a <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>cake recipe</a> calls for 335 ml of water, you’ll need 1.42 cups. This small adjustment can prevent over- or under-hydration, leading to fluffier results.</p>

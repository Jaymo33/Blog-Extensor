<p>2 tablespoons (tbsp) of lime juice weigh approximately 30 grams. This conversion is essential for precision in cooking, especially when using an air fryer where measurements can impact texture and flavour. Whether you’re marinating chicken or adding zest to a dessert, knowing the exact weight ensures consistency. For more air fryer tips, check out <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>.</p>

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on precise cooking times and temperatures, so ingredient measurements need to be spot on. Too much lime juice can make food soggy, while too little might leave it bland. Converting 2 tbsp of lime juice to grams (30g) helps avoid guesswork. This is particularly useful for recipes like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>air fryer chicken dishes</a>, where marinades need balance. Accurate measurements also ensure even cooking, a key benefit of air frying.</p>  

<p>Many UK recipes use grams for consistency, so knowing how 2 tbsp of lime juice translates simplifies cooking. If you’re scaling a recipe up or down, grams provide a reliable unit. For example, 1 tbsp of lime juice equals roughly 15 grams. This precision is why professional chefs and home cooks alike prefer weighing ingredients. Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more handy tips.</p>  

<h3>How to measure lime juice correctly</h3>  
<p>For the most accurate 2 tbsp lime juice to grams conversion, use a digital kitchen scale. Pour the juice directly into a measuring spoon or jug, then weigh it. Freshly squeezed lime juice may vary slightly in weight due to pulp content, but 30 grams is a reliable average. If you’re using bottled lime juice, check the label for ml-to-grams conversions, as some brands differ. This method ensures your <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> turn out perfectly every time.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for lime juice in air fryer recipes</h2>  
<p>Lime juice adds brightness to marinades, dressings, and even desserts. In air fryer cooking, it’s often used to tenderise meats or balance rich flavours. For instance, 2 tbsp (30g) of lime juice can transform a simple <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/shrimp>air fryer shrimp dish</a> with its zesty kick. It’s also great for deglazing or adding moisture to lean proteins like chicken or turkey. Knowing the gram equivalent helps you adjust recipes without compromising taste or texture.</p>  

<p>Another popular use is in dips and sauces, where precise acidity matters. Too much lime juice can overpower, while too little might not deliver enough tang. By measuring 2 tbsp as 30 grams, you can fine-tune flavours effortlessly. This is especially handy for meal preppers who batch-cook <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/meal-prep>air fryer meals</a> in advance. Consistent measurements mean every portion tastes just as good as the first.</p>  

<h3>Tips for storing lime juice</h3>  
<p>Fresh lime juice is best used immediately, but you can store it for short periods. If your recipe calls for 2 tbsp (30g) and you have leftovers, refrigerate them in an airtight container. Bottled lime juice lasts longer but may lack the fresh zestiness of squeezed juice. Either way, keeping your air fryer and ingredients in top condition ensures great results.

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Precision is key when using an air fryer, as ingredients cook quickly and evenly. Measuring 0.75 cup of miso soup correctly (6 ounces) ensures your dish isn’t too watery or overly concentrated.

<p>Using the right amount of miso soup can also affect cooking times. Too much liquid might steam rather than crisp your food, while too little could dry it out. For perfect results every time, stick to the 6-ounce measurement for 0.75 cup of miso soup. This is especially useful for meal preppers who batch-cook in their air fryers.</p>

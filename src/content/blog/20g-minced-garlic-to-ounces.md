<p>20 grams of minced garlic equals approximately 0.71 ounces. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements can make all the difference. Whether you're whipping up garlic-infused dishes or adjusting portion sizes, knowing this conversion ensures accuracy. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we focus on making cooking simpler, especially when it comes to conversions like 20g minced garlic to ounces.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on even cooking, and incorrect measurements can throw off the balance of flavours or textures. For example, using too much minced garlic might overpower a dish, while too little could leave it bland. Converting 20g minced garlic to ounces (0.71 oz) helps maintain consistency. If you're new to air frying, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for other handy measurements.</p>  

<p>Many UK recipes use grams, but if your kitchen scale measures in ounces, this conversion is a lifesaver. Whether you're making garlic butter shrimp or roasted vegetables, 20g of minced garlic adds just the right punch. For more inspiration, browse our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>garlic-heavy recipes</a> designed for air fryers.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure 20g of Minced Garlic Without a Scale</h3>  
<p>If you don't have a scale, 20g of minced garlic is roughly 4 teaspoons. This approximation works well for most recipes, though a scale is always best for precision. Minced garlic can vary in density, so spoon measurements aren't always exact. For perfectly balanced dishes, we recommend investing in a digital scaleâ€”especially if you love air frying.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for 20g of Minced Garlic in Air Fryer Recipes</h2>  
<p>From marinades to rubs, 20g of minced garlic (0.71 oz) is a versatile ingredient. Try it in air-fried chicken wings, garlic bread, or even homemade croutons. The strong flavour of garlic enhances dishes without needing excessive amounts. For a full list of garlic-friendly meals, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipes</a> section.</p>  

<p>Garlic also pairs beautifully with vegetables like potatoes and mushrooms. Tossing 20g of minced garlic with olive oil before air frying creates a delicious, aromatic coating. If you're meal prepping, minced garlic can be stored in the fridge for quick use. Just remember: 20g equals 0.71 ounces, so adjust your recipes accordingly.</p>  

<h3>Storing Minced Garlic for Future Use</h3>  
<p>Pre-minced garlic saves time, but freshness matters. Store unused portions in an airtight container in the fridge for up to two weeks. Alternatively, freeze minced garlic in ice cube trays for longer shelf life. When you need 20g (0.71 oz) for a recipe, just thaw a portion.

<p>3 cups of passata equals approximately 24 fluid ounces. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements can make all the difference. Whether you're whipping up a homemade pasta sauce or a rich tomato-based dish, knowing the exact weight ensures perfect results every time. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we understand the importance of accuracy in cooking, especially when using an air fryer.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate passata measurements matter</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of passata ensures your dishes have the perfect consistency and flavour. Too little, and your sauce might be too thin; too much, and it could overpower other ingredients. For air fryer recipes, precise measurements help avoid soggy or unevenly cooked meals. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more handy tips.

<h2>How to measure passata correctly</h2>  
<p>Measuring passata can be tricky if you don’t have the right tools. A liquid measuring cup is ideal for fluid ounces, while a kitchen scale can help with weight. If you're using a UK recipe, remember that measurements may differ slightly from US standards. For more recipe ideas, visit our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipes section</a>. Passata is a staple in many dishes, from lasagne to soups, so getting it right is crucial.</p>  

<h3>Converting cups to ounces for passata</h3>  
<p>One cup of passata typically equals 8 fluid ounces, so 3 cups would be 24 fluid ounces. This conversion is useful for scaling recipes up or down. If you're working with a recipe that uses grams, 3 cups of passata is roughly 680 grams.

<p>350 grams of butter is roughly 1.5 cups in the UK and 1.6 cups in the US. This conversion is essential for baking and cooking, especially when using an air fryer where precise measurements matter. Whether you're making cookies, cakes, or even savoury dishes, knowing how to convert grams to cups ensures consistent results every time.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Butter Measurements Matter</h2>
<p>Getting the right amount of butter can make or break a recipe. Too much butter can lead to greasy, overly rich dishes, while too little can result in dry, crumbly textures. For air fryer recipes, precision is even more critical because the cooking process is faster and more intense. A slight variation can affect browning, crispiness, and overall flavour.</p>
<p>If you're following a recipe from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, you'll notice many dishes rely on exact measurements. Whether it's a decadent chocolate cake or crispy roast potatoes, the right butter ratio ensures perfection. Always use a kitchen scale for grams, but if you only have cups, this conversion will save the day.</p>

<h2>UK vs. US Cup Measurements</h2>
<p>It's important to note that UK and US cup measurements differ slightly. In the UK, 1 cup of butter is about 227 grams, while in the US, it's approximately 226 grams. This small difference can add up when converting larger quantities like 350 grams of butter.</p>
<p>For UK bakers, 350 grams of butter equals roughly 1.5 cups. In the US, it's closer to 1.6 cups. If you're using an air fryer for baking, check whether your recipe follows UK or US measurements. Many recipes on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> specify the origin to avoid confusion.</p>

<h3>How to Measure Butter Without Scales</h3>
<p>If you don't have a kitchen scale, you can still measure 350 grams of butter using cup measurements. Most butter blocks come with markings for tablespoons or grams, making it easier to slice off the right amount. Alternatively, use the displacement method: fill a measuring cup with water, add butter until the water rises to the 1.5 or 1.6 cup mark, and drain the water.</p>

<h2>Common Recipes Using 350 Grams of Butter</h2>
<p>Many classic recipes call for 350 grams of butter, from buttery shortbread to rich brownies. In an air fryer, this measurement is often used for cakes, cookies, and even savoury dishes like garlic bread. The key is to adjust cooking times and temperatures to suit your air fryer model.</p>
<p>For example, a Victoria sponge cake might require 350 grams of butter for a moist, fluffy texture. Check out the <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>cake recipes</a> on our site for inspiration. Similarly, buttery pastry dishes like croissants or scones benefit from precise measurements to achieve that perfect flakiness.</p>

<h3>Tips for Measuring Butter in an Air Fryer</h3>
<p>When using an air fryer, softened butter works best for even distribution. Cold butter can lead to uneven cooking, especially in baked goods. If your recipe calls for melted butter, measure it after melting for accuracy. Always preheat your air fryer to ensure consistent results, and consider using a <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a> for other common ingredients.</p>

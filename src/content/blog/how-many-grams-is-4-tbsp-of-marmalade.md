<p>4 tablespoons (tbsp) of marmalade weigh approximately 80 grams. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements can make all the difference. Whether you’re glazing meats or baking desserts, knowing the exact weight ensures consistent results. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we focus on accuracy to help you achieve perfect dishes every time.</p>

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>
<p>Air fryers rely on precise cooking times and temperatures, and ingredient measurements play a crucial role. Using the correct amount of marmalade ensures your dish isn’t too sweet or too dry. For example, if you’re making an air fryer glaze for chicken or pork, 80 grams of marmalade provides the ideal balance. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more handy measurement tips.</p>

<p>Many air fryer recipes, especially those involving marinades or glazes, require exact gram measurements. Marmalade’s sticky consistency means volume measurements like tablespoons can vary slightly. That’s why weighing it in grams is more reliable. If you’re exploring new dishes, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a> has plenty of ideas to try.</p>

<h2>How to measure 4 tbsp of marmalade accurately</h2>
<p>To measure 4 tbsp of marmalade, use a standard UK tablespoon, which holds about 15ml. Scoop the marmalade without packing it down to avoid excess. For greater precision, a kitchen scale is your best friend—simply tare the scale and measure until it reads 80 grams. This method eliminates guesswork and guarantees consistency.</p>

<h3>Using marmalade in air fryer recipes</h3>
<p>Marmalade adds a sweet, tangy flavour to air fryer dishes, from glazed salmon to sticky desserts. Since air fryers cook food quickly, the sugar in marmalade can caramelise beautifully. Try brushing 80 grams (4 tbsp) of marmalade over chicken wings or pork chops for a glossy finish. For more inspiration, browse our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipes</a>.</p>

<h2>Common conversions for marmalade in air fryer cooking</h2>
<p>Beyond 4 tbsp, you might need other marmalade measurements. Here’s a quick reference: 1 tbsp ≈ 20g, 2 tbsp ≈ 40g, and 3 tbsp ≈ 60g. These conversions are handy when scaling recipes up or down. If you’re preparing a larger batch, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert recipes</a> often feature marmalade as a key ingredient.</p>

<h3>Tips for working with marmalade in the air fryer</h3>
<p>Marmalade can stick to air fryer baskets if not applied correctly. To prevent mess, mix it with a little oil or water before brushing it onto food. Cleaning is easy with our recommended <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner</a>. Remember, 4 tbsp (80g) of marmalade is perfect for most small to medium-sized dishes.</p>

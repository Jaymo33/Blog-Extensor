<p>485 ml of half and half equals approximately 2.05 cups. This conversion is handy for recipes requiring precise measurements, especially when using an air fryer. Whether you're baking a cake or making a creamy sauce, knowing how to convert millilitres to cups ensures your dish turns out perfectly every time. For more air fryer-friendly recipes, visit <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of half and half can make or break a recipe. Too much can make sauces overly rich, while too little might leave them lacking creaminess. In baking, precise measurements ensure the right texture and rise. Air fryer recipes, like those on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes</a>, often rely on exact ratios for perfect results. Whether you're cooking or baking, accuracy is key.</p>  

<p>Converting 485 ml of half and half to cups is straightforward, but it helps to understand the difference between metric and imperial measurements. In the UK, recipes often use millilitres, while US recipes favour cups. Knowing both systems ensures you can follow any recipe without hassle. For a handy conversion chart, check out <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart</a>.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure Half and Half Correctly</h3>  
<p>For the most accurate measurement, use a liquid measuring cup. Pour the half and half to the 2-cup mark, then add an extra teaspoon to account for the 0.05 remainder. If you don't have a measuring cup, a kitchen scale set to millilitres works too. This method is especially useful for air fryer recipes, where precision matters.

<h2>Common Uses for 485 ml of Half and Half</h2>  
<p>Half and half is a versatile ingredient, perfect for creamy soups, custards, and even coffee. In air fryer cooking, it’s often used in batters or sauces to add richness. For example, a creamy garlic sauce for air-fried chicken benefits from the exact measurement of 485 ml (or 2.05 cups) of half and half. Find inspiration at <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken</a>.</p>  

<p>Baking is another area where 485 ml of half and half shines. Cakes, scones, and muffins often call for this measurement to achieve the perfect crumb. If you're adapting a recipe for your air fryer, precise conversions ensure success.

<h3>Adjusting Recipes for Different Servings</h3>  
<p>If your recipe serves more or fewer people, you might need to adjust the 485 ml measurement. Doubling it? That’s 4.1 cups. Halving it? Just over 1 cup. Always recalculate to maintain the right balance of ingredients, especially in air fryer cooking, where space and heat distribution matter.</p>

Whether you’re making a healthy snack or adding cottage cheese to a dish, knowing the weight in ounces helps ensure accuracy. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we love simplifying measurements for your cooking convenience. Keep reading for more tips on using cottage cheese in your air fryer.</p>

<h2>Why convert 10g of cottage cheese to ounces?</h2>  
<p>Many UK recipes, especially those for air fryers, use grams, but some kitchen scales or older cookbooks might list ounces. Converting 10g of cottage cheese to ounces (0.35 oz) ensures you get the right texture and consistency in dishes like air-fried stuffed mushrooms or cheesy baked potatoes. Cottage cheese is a versatile ingredient, and precise measurements help avoid soggy or dry results.

<p>Cottage cheese is also a great protein boost in air-fryer breakfasts. Whether you’re adding it to scrambled eggs or using it as a topping, knowing the weight in ounces helps balance flavours. If you’re meal prepping, 10g (0.35 oz) portions are ideal for single servings. Visit our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipes section</a> for creative ways to use cottage cheese in your air fryer. From savoury to sweet, the possibilities are endless!</p>  

<h2>How to measure 10g of cottage cheese without scales</h2>  
<p>No scales? No problem! A heaped teaspoon of cottage cheese is roughly 10g (0.35 oz). For small curd varieties, this equals about two level teaspoons. If you’re using cottage cheese in air-fryer recipes like stuffed peppers or protein pancakes, this eyeballing method works in a pinch. Just remember, for baking or precise dishes, a scale is best. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we recommend investing in a digital scale for consistent results.</p>  

<h3>Cottage cheese in air fryer cooking</h3>  
<p>Cottage cheese adds creaminess and protein to air-fryer dishes without excess fat. For example, 10g (0.35 oz) blended into mashed potatoes creates a fluffy texture. It’s also a brilliant binder for veggie patties or meatballs. Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable recipes</a> for ideas. Just remember to drain excess liquid if using cottage cheese as a topping to prevent sogginess.</p>  

<h2>Storage tips for cottage cheese</h2>  
<p>Once opened, cottage cheese lasts about 3–5 days in the fridge. If your recipe calls for 10g (0.35 oz), consider portioning the rest into small containers. You can also freeze cottage cheese for up to 2 months, though the texture may change slightly. Thawed cottage cheese works well in cooked dishes like air-fryer lasagna or cheesecake bites.

Mix it with herbs for a healthy dip or use it to lighten up mashed potatoes.

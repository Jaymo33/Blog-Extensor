<p>100g of butter equals approximately 3.53 ounces. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes, where precise measurements can make all the difference. Whether you're baking cookies or preparing a savoury dish, knowing how to convert grams to ounces ensures consistent results. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we help simplify these conversions so you can focus on cooking.</p>

<h2>Why Convert 100g of Butter to Ounces?</h2>  
<p>Many UK recipes use grams, while others rely on ounces, making conversions a common kitchen task. If you're using an air fryer, accuracy is key to avoid under or overcooking. Converting 100g of butter to ounces (3.53 oz) helps you follow recipes precisely, whether they're from a cookbook or online. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> makes this even easier.</p>  

<p>Butter is a staple in both baking and cooking, and even small measurement errors can affect texture and flavour. For example, too much butter in air fryer cakes can make them greasy, while too little may dry them out. By knowing that 100g butter is 3.53 ounces, you can adapt any recipe with confidence.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure 100g of Butter Without Scales</h3>  
<p>If you don't have scales, you can still measure 100g of butter using tablespoons. One tablespoon of butter weighs about 14g, so 100g is roughly 7 tablespoons. This method isn't as precise as weighing, but it works in a pinch. For best results, we recommend using digital scales, especially for air fryer recipes where consistency matters.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for 100g of Butter in Air Fryer Recipes</h2>  
<p>100g of butter (3.53 oz) is a common measurement in many air fryer recipes. From flaky pastries to golden roasted vegetables, butter adds richness and flavour. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipes section</a> for inspiration, including garlic butter shrimp or buttery air fryer cookies.</p>  

<p>Butter also helps create crispy textures in the air fryer. For example, brushing melted butter on potatoes before air frying gives them a delicious golden finish. If you're making a batch of scones or muffins, 100g of butter is often the perfect amount for a tender crumb.</p>  

<h3>Converting Other Butter Measurements</h3>  
<p>Need to convert a different amount? Here's a quick reference: 50g = 1.76 oz, 200g = 7.05 oz, and 250g = 8.82 oz. Bookmark our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a> for easy access. These conversions are especially handy when scaling recipes up or down for your air fryer.</p>  

<h2>Tips for Working with Butter in the Air Fryer</h2>  
<p>Butter can sometimes cause smoke in the air fryer if it drips onto the heating element. To prevent this, use liners or parchment paper. Our guide on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>keeping your air fryer clean</a> has more tips. Also, consider using clarified butter for high-heat cooking, as it has a higher smoke point.</p>  

<p>For baking, softened butter blends better with other ingredients, ensuring even distribution in batters and doughs. If you're making a savoury dish, melted butter works well for coating vegetables or meats before air frying. Remember, 100g of butter equals 3.53 ounces, so adjust recipes accordingly.</p>  

<h3>Butter Alternatives for Air Fryer Cooking</h3>  
<p>If you're out of butter, you can substitute margarine, coconut oil, or olive oil in most recipes. Just note that these may alter the flavour and texture slightly. For baking, stick to butter unless the recipe specifies otherwise, as it provides the best results.</p>

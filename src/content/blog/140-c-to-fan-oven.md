<p>140 C in a fan oven is equivalent to approximately 120 C in a conventional oven. This conversion is essential for baking and air frying, as fan ovens circulate hot air for even cooking. If you're using an air fryer, which works similarly to a fan oven, you can often use the same temperature settings. For more tips on air fryer conversions, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>  

<h2>Why Convert 140 C to Fan Oven?</h2>  
<p>Fan ovens and air fryers use convection heating, which means they cook food faster and more evenly than traditional ovens. When a recipe calls for 140 C in a conventional oven, reducing it to 120 C in a fan oven or air fryer prevents overcooking. This is especially important for delicate dishes like cakes or pastries. For a variety of recipes tailored to your air fryer, visit <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>.</p>  

<p>Many modern air fryers have built-in fan oven settings, making it easy to switch between modes. If your appliance doesn’t have this feature, manually adjusting the temperature ensures perfect results. Always preheat your air fryer for the best outcome, just as you would with a fan oven.</p>  

<h3>How to Adjust Cooking Times</h3>  
<p>When converting 140 C to a fan oven or air fryer, cooking times may also need adjustment. Generally, reduce the time by 10-15% to account for the faster cooking process. For example, if a recipe requires 30 minutes at 140 C in a conventional oven, try 25-27 minutes in a fan oven or air fryer.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for 140 C in Fan Ovens</h2>  
<p>140 C (or 120 C fan) is ideal for slow baking, drying herbs, or gently cooking proteins like fish. It’s also a great temperature for reheating leftovers without drying them out. If you love baking, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>cake recipes</a> designed for air fryers.</p>  

<p>For frozen foods, 140 C in a fan oven or air fryer ensures thorough heating without burning the exterior. This setting works well for items like frozen pastries or pre-cooked meals. Always check the packaging for specific instructions, as some products may require slight adjustments.</p>  

<h3>Air Fryer vs. Fan Oven</h3>  
<p>While both appliances use similar technology, air fryers are more compact and heat up faster. This means you may need to monitor cooking progress more closely. For cleaning tips to keep your air fryer in top condition, visit <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>our cleaning guide</a>.</p>  

<h2>Tips for Perfect Results</h2>  
<p>Always use an oven thermometer to verify your air fryer’s temperature accuracy. If you’re adapting a conventional recipe, start with a lower temperature and extend the time if needed. For crispy results, lightly spray food with oil before air frying at 140 C (fan setting).</p>  

<p>Experiment with different rack positions in your air fryer to find the optimal heat distribution. Middle racks usually work best for even cooking.

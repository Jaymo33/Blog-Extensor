<h2>Why Accurate Milk Measurements Matter</h2>

<h2>US vs UK Cup Measurements</h2>
<p>Did you know that a US cup and a UK cup aren’t the same? A US cup holds 240 ml, while a UK cup holds 250 ml. This means 110 ml of milk converts to roughly 0.46 cups in the US and 0.44 cups in the UK. While the difference might seem small, it can add up in recipes requiring larger quantities.</p>

This is particularly important for baking, where precision is key. A slight variation in milk quantity could affect the rise of your cakes or the consistency of your custards.</p>

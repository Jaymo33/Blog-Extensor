    "text": "Yes, you can substitute 75g of coconut oil for butter in most air fryer recipes. Coconut oil has a similar fat content and works well for baking, frying, and greasing.

    "@type": "Answer",
    "text": "Smoking usually occurs if the oil exceeds its smoke point (around 175°C for coconut oil) or if the air fryer basket is overcrowded. Use 75g of coconut oil sparingly, and preheat your air fryer to distribute heat evenly. Regular cleaning also prevents smoke from leftover residue."

    "@type": "Answer",
    "text": "Coconut oil contains medium-chain triglycerides (MCTs), which some studies suggest may offer health benefits. However, like all oils, it’s high in calories—so moderation is key. For lighter options, try using half the amount (about 37g or 1.3 oz) mixed with a spray bottle for even coating."

<h2>Why Convert 75g of Coconut Oil to Ounces?</h2>  
<p>Many air fryer recipes, especially those from the UK, use grams as the standard measurement. However, if your kitchen scales or recipe book uses ounces, converting 75g of coconut oil to ounces (2.65 oz) ensures you get the right consistency and flavour. Coconut oil is a versatile ingredient in air fryer cooking, perfect for greasing trays, adding moisture to baked goods, or even creating crispy coatings.

<h3>How to Measure 75g of Coconut Oil Accurately</h3>  
<p>To measure 75g of coconut oil, use a digital kitchen scale for precision. If your scale displays ounces, you’ll need 2.65 oz. Coconut oil can be solid or liquid depending on room temperature, so ensure it’s level in your measuring spoon or cup. For sticky situations, lightly grease your tools with a bit of oil to help it slide off easily. This small step can save you time and mess when prepping air fryer meals.</p>  

<h2>Using 75g of Coconut Oil in Air Fryer Recipes</h2>  
<p>75g of coconut oil (2.65 oz) is a versatile amount for many air fryer dishes. It’s enough to coat a batch of sweet potato fries, grease a cake tin, or create a crispy crust on tofu. Coconut oil’s mild flavour pairs well with both sweet and savoury ingredients, making it a staple in air fryer cooking. For a delicious way to use it, try our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>coconut-crusted chicken recipe</a>, where 75g of coconut oil helps achieve that perfect golden crunch.</p>  

<p>If you’re new to air frying, start with smaller amounts of coconut oil and adjust as needed. Too much oil can lead to smoke or uneven cooking, while too little might leave food dry. Cleaning your air fryer after using coconut oil is easy with our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>recommended cleaner</a>, which cuts through grease without harsh chemicals. Remember, 75g of coconut oil (2.65 oz) is just a starting point—feel free to tweak based on your taste and recipe requirements.</p>  

<h3>Common Mistakes When Measuring Coconut Oil</h3>  
<p>One mistake people make is assuming melted and solid coconut oil weigh the same. While 75g of coconut oil equals 2.65 oz in any state, volume measurements (like cups) can vary depending on its form. Always weigh coconut oil for accuracy, especially in air fryer recipes where consistency matters. Another tip: if your recipe calls for melted coconut oil, measure it solid first, then melt it. This ensures you don’t end up with too much or too little in your dish.</p>

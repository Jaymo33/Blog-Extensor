<p>60 ml of condensed milk equals approximately 0.25 cups (or 1/4 cup). This conversion is essential for baking and air fryer recipes where precision ensures perfect results. Whether you're whipping up a dessert or adjusting a recipe, knowing how to measure condensed milk accurately saves time and avoids mishaps.</p>  

<h2>Why Measuring Condensed Milk Matters</h2>  
<p>Condensed milk is a staple in many recipes, from cakes to air fryer treats. Using the right amount ensures the right texture and sweetness. Too much can make desserts overly sweet or soggy, while too little might leave them dry. For air fryer recipes, precise measurements help maintain consistency, especially when adapting traditional oven recipes. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more handy tips.</p>  

<p>Many UK and US recipes use different measurement systems, so conversions are crucial. If you're working with a recipe from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, you'll often find ml and cup measurements side by side. This makes it easier to follow, whether you prefer metric or imperial units.</p>  

<h2>How to Measure 60 ml of Condensed Milk</h2>  
<p>If you don’t have a measuring cup, a standard metric measuring jug will do. Pour the condensed milk up to the 60 ml mark for accuracy. Alternatively, use a tablespoon—4 tablespoons equal roughly 60 ml. For sticky ingredients like condensed milk, lightly grease the spoon or cup for easier pouring.</p>  

<h3>Using Cups for 60 ml of Condensed Milk</h3>  
<p>Since 60 ml is 1/4 cup, you can use a standard measuring cup set. Fill it to the 1/4 line, scraping off any excess with a spatula. For recipes requiring multiple measurements, consider using a digital scale for even greater precision, especially in baking.</p>  

<h2>Common Recipes Using 60 ml of Condensed Milk</h2>  
<p>From fudgy brownies to creamy cheesecakes, 60 ml of condensed milk pops up in many treats. Try it in air fryer-friendly desserts like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert recipes</a> for a rich, caramelised flavour. It’s also great in no-bake energy bites or as a drizzle over air-fried fruit.</p>  

<p>For savoury dishes, condensed milk can balance spices in marinades or glazes. If you're experimenting, start with small quantities and adjust to taste. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a> has plenty of ideas to inspire your next kitchen adventure.</p>  

<h3>Adjusting Recipes for Different Quantities</h3>  
<p>Need to scale up or down? Double 60 ml to 120 ml for 0.5 cups, or halve it to 30 ml (2 tablespoons). Always check the recipe’s total volume to maintain ratios. For air fryer cooking, smaller batches often work best, so precise measurements prevent overflow or uneven cooking.</p>  

<h2>Tips for Storing and Handling Condensed Milk</h2>  
<p>Once opened, store condensed milk in an airtight container in the fridge. It thickens when cold, so let it sit at room temperature before measuring. If it’s too sticky, warm the can briefly in warm water for easier pouring. For cleaning sticky residue, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner guide</a> has handy tips.</p>  

<p>Unopened cans last months in a cool, dry place, making condensed milk a handy pantry staple. Always check for signs of spoilage, like unusual odours or discolouration, before use.</p>

<p>5 grams of soy milk equals approximately 0.18 ounces. This conversion is handy when following air fryer recipes that require precise measurements, especially for liquids like soy milk. Whether you're whipping up a vegan breakfast or a creamy sauce, knowing how to convert grams to ounces ensures your dish turns out perfectly every time.</p>

<h2>Why Convert 5g of Soy Milk to Ounces?</h2>  
<p>Many air fryer recipes, especially those from the UK or US, use different measurement systems. While grams are common in metric-based recipes, ounces are often used in imperial measurements. Converting 5g of soy milk to ounces (0.18 oz) helps avoid confusion and guarantees accuracy. This is particularly useful for recipes like vegan pancakes or tofu marinades found on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>.</p>  

<p>Precision matters in air frying because liquids like soy milk can affect texture and cooking times. Too much or too little could throw off your recipe. For example, a splash of soy milk in a batter or glaze needs to be spot-on for the best results. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more handy measurement swaps.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure 5g of Soy Milk Accurately</h3>  
<p>Using a digital kitchen scale is the easiest way to measure 5g of soy milk. Set your scale to grams, tare the weight of your container, and pour until you hit 5g. If you don’t have a scale, remember that 5g is roughly one teaspoon, but for liquids, a scale is far more reliable. This method ensures your air fryer dishes, like crispy tofu or vegan muffins, turn out just right.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for 5g of Soy Milk in Air Fryer Recipes</h2>  
<p>Soy milk is a versatile ingredient in air fryer cooking. From binding coatings to adding moisture, 5g might seem small but makes a difference. Try it in vegan breading for <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/tofu>tofu recipes</a> or as a light glaze for roasted vegetables. Even a tiny amount can enhance flavour and texture without overpowering other ingredients.</p>  

<p>Another great use is in batters for air-fried treats like onion rings or tempura. The 5g measurement ensures the batter isn’t too thick or thin. For more inspiration, browse our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert category</a>, where soy milk often features in lighter, plant-based sweets. Precision here means perfect crispiness every time.</p>  

<h3>Converting Other Soy Milk Amounts</h3>  
<p>If your recipe calls for more or less soy milk, the same conversion principle applies. For example, 10g of soy milk equals 0.35 ounces, while 20g is roughly 0.7 ounces. Keep a conversion chart handy, or bookmark our guide for quick reference. This is especially helpful when scaling recipes up or down for your air fryer.</p>  

<h2>Tips for Working with Soy Milk in Air Fryers</h2>  
<p>Soy milk can behave differently than dairy milk in high-heat cooking. When using small amounts like 5g, mix it thoroughly with other ingredients to prevent separation. For coatings or glazes, apply evenly to avoid soggy spots. And always preheat your air fryer for consistent results—soy milk-based recipes cook best when the temperature is stable.</p>  

<p>Cleaning your air fryer after using soy milk is also important. Residue can build up and affect future dishes. Use our recommended <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner</a> to keep your appliance in top shape. A well-maintained air fryer ensures every gram—or ounce—of effort pays off in delicious meals.</p>

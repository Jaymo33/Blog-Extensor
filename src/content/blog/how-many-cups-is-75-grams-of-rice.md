<p>75 grams of rice is roughly equivalent to 0.38 cups (US) or 0.31 cups (UK). This conversion helps ensure you get the perfect rice portion for your air fryer recipes. Whether you're making a quick side dish or a main meal, accurate measurements make all the difference.</p>

<h2>Understanding Rice Measurements</h2>  
<p>Rice can vary in density depending on the type, so 75 grams of rice in cups isn't always exact. Long-grain rice, for example, may measure slightly differently than short-grain or basmati. For most standard white rice, 75 grams translates to just under half a US cup or a little over a quarter of a UK cup. If you're using an air fryer, precise measurements help avoid undercooked or mushy results.</p>  

<p>For those who love cooking with an air fryer, accurate conversions like 75 grams of rice to cups are essential. You can find more handy conversions on our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>. This ensures your rice dishes turn out perfectly every time, whether you're making fried rice or a rice-based casserole.</p>  

<h3>Why Measuring Rice Correctly Matters</h3>  
<p>Using the right amount of rice ensures even cooking and prevents waste. Too much rice in your air fryer can lead to clumping, while too little might dry out. Measuring 75 grams of rice in cups helps maintain consistency, especially when following recipes from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>our collection</a>.</p>  

<h2>Converting 75 Grams of Rice to Cups</h2>  
<p>The exact conversion of 75 grams of rice to cups depends on the cup standard you're using. In the US, 1 cup is 240ml, while in the UK, it's 250ml. This slight difference means 75 grams of rice equals approximately 0.38 US cups or 0.31 UK cups. If you're using a kitchen scale, weighing rice is the most accurate method.</p>  

<p>For air fryer cooking, knowing how many cups 75 grams of rice is can help with meal prep. Whether you're making a <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken and rice dish</a> or a vegetarian stir-fry, getting the rice portion right ensures balanced flavours and textures.</p>  

<h3>Types of Rice and Their Measurements</h3>  
<p>Different rice varieties have different densities. Basmati rice, for example, is lighter, so 75 grams may fill slightly more than half a US cup. Short-grain rice, like sushi rice, is denser, so 75 grams might be closer to a third of a cup. Always check the packaging for specific weight-to-volume conversions.</p>  

<h2>Tips for Cooking Rice in an Air Fryer</h2>  
<p>Cooking rice in an air fryer requires a bit of technique. Since 75 grams of rice is a smaller portion, you'll need to adjust cooking times. Pre-soaking the rice for 10-15 minutes can help it cook more evenly. Pair it with ingredients from our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable recipes</a> for a complete meal.</p>  

<p>After cooking, always clean your air fryer basket to prevent residue buildup. Our guide on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaning</a> makes maintenance easy. Proper care ensures your appliance lasts longer and performs at its best.</p>  

<h3>Common Mistakes When Measuring Rice</h3>  
<p>One mistake people make is packing rice into the cup, which leads to inaccurate measurements. For 75 grams of rice, lightly spoon it into the measuring cup and level it off. Another error is not accounting for rice expansion—75 grams of uncooked rice yields about 1.5 cups when cooked.</p>

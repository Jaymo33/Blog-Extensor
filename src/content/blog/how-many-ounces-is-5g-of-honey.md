<h2>Why accurate honey measurements matter</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of honey can make or break a recipe. Too little, and your dish might lack sweetness; too much, and it could become overly sticky or caramelised. In air fryer cooking, precise measurements ensure even cooking and perfect texture. For example, a glaze with 5g of honey (0.176 oz) will coat chicken wings evenly without overpowering them.

<p>Honey’s viscosity means volume measurements (like teaspoons) can vary, making weight the most reliable method. A digital kitchen scale is ideal for measuring 5g of honey accurately. If you’re converting from grams to ounces frequently, bookmarking a conversion tool or chart saves time.

<h3>How to measure 5g of honey without scales</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a scale, 5g of honey is roughly 1 teaspoon (though this can vary slightly depending on honey density). For best results, use a measuring spoon and level it off. Remember, weight is always more accurate than volume, especially for sticky ingredients like honey. For recipes requiring precision, like cakes or glazes, investing in a scale is worthwhile.</p>  

<h2>Converting 5g honey to ounces in UK recipes</h2>  
<p>In the UK, recipes often use grams, but some older or international recipes might list ounces. Converting 5g of honey to ounces (0.176 oz) ensures you follow the recipe correctly.

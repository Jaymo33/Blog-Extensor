<p>860 ml of lemon juice equals approximately 3.63 cups in the UK or 3.64 cups in the US. This slight difference comes from the variation in cup sizes between the two measurement systems. Whether you're whipping up a zesty marinade or a tangy dessert in your air fryer, getting the conversion right ensures your dish turns out perfectly balanced.</p>  

<h2>Understanding Cup Measurements for Lemon Juice</h2>  
<p>When converting 860 ml of lemon juice to cups, it’s important to know whether you’re using UK or US measurements. In the UK, 1 cup is 250 ml, while in the US, it’s 240 ml. This means 860 ml translates to 3.63 UK cups or 3.64 US cups. For most recipes, this tiny difference won’t matter, but precision is key in baking or when making sauces for your air fryer dishes.</p>  

<p>Lemon juice is a common ingredient in many air fryer recipes, from glazes to dressings. If you’re following a recipe from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, you’ll often find measurements in both ml and cups. Keeping a conversion chart handy, like the one on our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion guide</a>, can save time and avoid mistakes.</p>  

<h3>Why Accurate Measurements Matter</h3>  
<p>Using the right amount of lemon juice can make or break a dish. Too little, and your marinade lacks tang; too much, and it overpowers other flavours. For air fryer cooking, where ingredients cook quickly, balance is especially important. If you’re experimenting with a new recipe, like those in our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken category</a>, precise measurements ensure consistent results.</p>  

<h2>Converting 860 ml of Lemon Juice for Baking</h2>  
<p>Baking in an air fryer often requires exact measurements, as even small deviations can affect texture and rise. If a recipe calls for 860 ml of lemon juice, you’ll need roughly 3.63 UK cups or 3.64 US cups. For cakes or muffins, this ensures the right acidity level for leavening agents to work properly.</p>  

<p>If you’re scaling a recipe up or down, remember that 860 ml of lemon juice is just over 3.5 cups in both systems. For more baking tips, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a>, which includes everything from citrus-infused desserts to savoury bakes.</p>  

<h3>Handling Lemon Juice Substitutes</h3>  
<p>If you’re out of fresh lemons, bottled lemon juice can work in a pinch. Just ensure you’re still measuring accurately—860 ml of bottled juice still equals 3.63–3.64 cups. However, fresh lemon juice often has a brighter flavour, which can elevate air fryer dishes like our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/seafood>seafood recipes</a>.</p>  

<h2>Practical Tips for Measuring Lemon Juice</h2>  
<p>To measure 860 ml of lemon juice easily, use a liquid measuring jug with both ml and cup markings. If your recipe calls for cups, fill to just under 3 and 2/3 cups for UK measurements or a hair over 3 and 5/8 cups for US. For sticky ingredients like honey or syrup, lightly greasing the cup first helps with pouring.</p>  

<p>Cleaning up after measuring lemon juice is simple with our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner guide</a>. Acidic ingredients can leave residues, so a quick wipe-down keeps your kitchen spotless. Whether you’re making a glaze for salmon or a citrus drizzle cake, accurate measurements and easy cleanup go hand in hand.</p>

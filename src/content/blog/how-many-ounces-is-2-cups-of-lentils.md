<p>2 cups of lentils weigh approximately 14 ounces (396 grams). This measurement is key for air fryer recipes, ensuring accurate portioning and perfect results every time. Whether you're meal prepping or cooking a one-off dish, knowing this conversion helps streamline your kitchen workflow.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate lentil measurements matter</h2>  
<p>Getting the right amount of lentils ensures your air fryer dishes turn out perfectly. Too few lentils, and your meal might lack substance; too many, and they won’t cook evenly. For recipes like crispy lentil patties or air-fried lentil falafel, precision is crucial. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more handy measurement swaps. Lentils are a fantastic protein source, so nailing the quantity means balanced, nutritious meals every time.</p>  

<h3>Types of lentils and their weights</h3>  
<p>Not all lentils weigh the same. Green and brown lentils are denser, while red and yellow lentils are lighter. For 2 cups, green lentils clock in around 14 ounces, whereas split red lentils might be closer to 12 ounces. Always check your recipe for the specific type recommended. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>lentil recipes</a> section has tailored guidance for each variety.</p>  

<h2>Converting cups to ounces for air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers thrive on precise measurements, and lentils are no exception. If your recipe calls for ounces but you’ve measured in cups, this conversion saves the day. For 2 cups of lentils, you’re looking at 14 ounces—ideal for batch cooking or family meals. Need more conversions? Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a> covers everything from spices to proteins.</p>  

<h3>Tools for measuring lentils accurately</h3>  
<p>A kitchen scale is your best friend for exact measurements, but if you’re using cups, fluff the lentils first to avoid compacting. Spoon them into the cup and level off the top for consistency. For air fryer recipes, slight variations can affect crispiness, so precision matters. Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/meal-prep>meal prep section</a> for lentil-based dishes that freeze well.</p>  

<h2>Common lentil recipes for your air fryer</h2>  
<p>Lentils shine in air fryer recipes, from crunchy snacks to hearty mains. Try spiced lentil croquettes or air-fried lentil-stuffed peppers. With 2 cups (14 ounces) of lentils, you can whip up a family-sized portion effortlessly. For inspiration, browse our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a>, packed with lentil-centric ideas. Don’t forget to clean your air fryer afterward—our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning guide</a> makes it a breeze.</p>  

<h3>Storing cooked lentils for later use</h3>  
<p>Cooked lentils freeze beautifully, so batch-cook 2 cups (14 ounces) and portion them for future meals. Let them cool before storing in airtight containers—they’ll keep for up to 3 months. Reheat in the air fryer for 5 minutes at 180°C, and they’re good to go.

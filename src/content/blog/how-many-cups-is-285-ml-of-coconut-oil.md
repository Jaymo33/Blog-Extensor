<p>285 ml of coconut oil is approximately 1.2 cups. This conversion is essential for precise baking and air frying, ensuring your recipes turn out perfectly every time. Whether you’re whipping up a batch of cookies or frying chicken in your air fryer, knowing how to measure coconut oil accurately makes all the difference.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of coconut oil ensures your dishes have the perfect texture and flavour. Too much oil can make food greasy, while too little can leave it dry. For air fryer recipes, precision is key to achieving that crispy, golden finish. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more handy measurement tips.</p>  

<p>Coconut oil is a popular choice for air frying because of its high smoke point and health benefits. Whether you’re making <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>desserts</a> or savoury dishes, getting the measurement right ensures consistent results. Always measure liquids at room temperature for the most accurate conversion.</p>  

<h2>How to Measure 285 ml of Coconut Oil</h2>  
<p>If you don’t have a measuring jug, you can use standard cups to measure 285 ml of coconut oil. One cup is roughly 237 ml, so 285 ml is just over 1.2 cups. For best results, use a liquid measuring cup with clear markings. This method works for both <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/breakfast>breakfast recipes</a> and main courses.</p>  

<h3>Using a Kitchen Scale</h3>  
<p>For even greater accuracy, weigh your coconut oil. Coconut oil weighs about 0.92 grams per ml, so 285 ml equals roughly 262 grams. A kitchen scale eliminates guesswork and ensures perfect results every time. This is especially useful for <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>complex recipes</a> where precision matters.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for 285 ml of Coconut Oil</h2>  
<p>This quantity of coconut oil is perfect for baking cakes, frying chicken, or making crispy roast potatoes in your air fryer. Its mild flavour and health benefits make it a versatile ingredient. Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipes</a> for inspiration on how to use coconut oil in your cooking.</p>  

<p>You can also use coconut oil to grease your air fryer basket, preventing food from sticking. Just a light coating ensures easy cleanup and even cooking.

<h2>Converting Other Coconut Oil Measurements</h2>  
<p>If you need to convert different amounts of coconut oil, remember that 1 cup equals 237 ml. For smaller quantities, use tablespoons or teaspoons. Keeping a conversion chart handy saves time and reduces errors in the kitchen. Whether you’re cooking for one or meal prepping, accurate measurements make life easier.</p>  

<h3>Adjusting Recipes for Your Air Fryer</h3>  
<p>Air fryers cook faster than conventional ovens, so you may need to adjust oil quantities. Start with slightly less oil than the recipe suggests and add more if needed. This prevents overcooking and ensures your food stays moist and flavourful. Experiment with different amounts to find what works best for your favourite dishes.</p>

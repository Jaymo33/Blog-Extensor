<p>2.5 cups of lime juice equals 591.47 millilitres (ml). This conversion is essential for precise cooking, especially when using an air fryer where accurate measurements can make or break a recipe. Whether you're preparing a citrusy marinade or a refreshing dessert, knowing how to convert cups to millilitres ensures consistency and delicious results.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Lime Juice Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>When cooking or baking, especially in an air fryer, precise measurements are crucial. Lime juice adds acidity and brightness to dishes, but too much or too little can throw off the balance. For example, a marinade for <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>air fryer chicken</a> might require 2.5 cups of lime juice to tenderise and flavour the meat properly. Converting this to millilitres ensures you’re using the exact amount needed.</p>  
<p>Air fryers cook food quickly and evenly, so ingredient ratios must be spot-on. A dish like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>lime-infused shrimp</a> relies on the right amount of lime juice to avoid overpowering or underwhelming flavours. By knowing that 2.5 cups of lime juice is 591.47 ml, you can confidently follow recipes or adjust them to suit your taste.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure Lime Juice Correctly</h3>  
<p>To measure lime juice accurately, use a liquid measuring cup for cups or a kitchen scale for millilitres. Freshly squeezed lime juice is best for flavour, but bottled lime juice works too. If your recipe calls for 2.5 cups of lime juice (591.47 ml), ensure you’re measuring at eye level to avoid over- or under-pouring.</p>  

<h2>Converting Cups to Millilitres for Air Fryer Recipes</h2>  
<p>Many air fryer recipes, like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>citrus desserts</a>, use lime juice for a tangy kick. Converting 2.5 cups of lime juice to millilitres (591.47 ml) helps you follow international recipes or scale portions up or down. This is particularly useful if you’re using a recipe from a country that measures liquids in millilitres rather than cups.</p>  
<p>For example, a <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a> can be handy when adapting recipes. If a recipe calls for 2.5 cups of lime juice, you’ll know it’s 591.47 ml, ensuring your air fryer dishes turn out perfectly every time. This precision is especially important for baking, where exact measurements are critical.</p>  

<h3>Common Uses for 2.5 Cups of Lime Juice</h3>  
<p>2.5 cups of lime juice (591.47 ml) is often used in large batches of marinades, dressings, or cocktails. In air fryer cooking, it’s perfect for marinating <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/shrimp>shrimp</a> or adding zest to vegetable dishes. The acidity also helps tenderise meats, making it a versatile ingredient in many recipes.</p>

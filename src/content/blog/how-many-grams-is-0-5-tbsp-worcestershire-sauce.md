<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>
<p>Air fryers rely on even cooking, and small variations in ingredient quantities can affect texture and flavour.

Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a> includes many dishes where Worcestershire sauce plays a key role.</p>
<p>When converting 0.5 tbsp of Worcestershire sauce to grams, remember that liquid densities vary. Worcestershire sauce is slightly thicker than water, which is why 0.5 tbsp weighs around 7.5 grams. This precision is especially important when scaling recipes up or down for your air fryer.</p>

<h2>How to measure Worcestershire sauce accurately</h2>
<p>For the most accurate results, use a digital kitchen scale when measuring 0.5 tbsp of Worcestershire sauce in grams. If you don't have scales, a standard UK tablespoon holds 15ml, so half would be 7.5ml. Given Worcestershire sauce's density, this translates to roughly 7.5 grams. Always level off your spoon for consistent measurements.</p>

Whether you're making fluffy cakes or crispy batters, knowing how to convert 2.5 tbsp baking powder to grams guarantees consistent results.

<h2>Why accurate baking powder measurements matter</h2>
<p>Using the correct amount of baking powder is crucial for air fryer recipes. Too little, and your cakes or batters won’t rise properly. Too much, and you risk a bitter taste or uneven texture. Converting 2.5 tbsp of baking powder into grams ensures you’re following recipes precisely, especially when scaling up or down. Many air fryer recipes, like those in our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipes</a> section, rely on exact measurements for success.</p>
<p>Baking powder’s density can vary slightly between brands, but 2.5 tbsp generally weighs around 37.5 grams. For best results, we recommend using digital scales for accuracy. This is particularly important for delicate bakes like air fryer sponges or soufflés, where even small measurement errors can affect the outcome.</p>

<h2>How to measure 2.5 tbsp baking powder accurately</h2>
<p>When converting 2.5 tbsp of baking powder to grams, proper measuring techniques are key. Always use standard UK tablespoons (15ml) and level off the powder with a straight edge for consistency. If you don’t have scales, spoon the baking powder lightly into the measuring spoon rather than scooping directly from the container, which can compact it.</p>
<p>For those who frequently bake in their air fryer, keeping a <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a> handy can save time. Remember that 1 tbsp of baking powder equals about 15 grams, making 2.5 tbsp equal to 37.5 grams. This conversion works perfectly for most UK baking powder brands available in supermarkets.</p>

<h3>Common uses for 2.5 tbsp baking powder in air fryer recipes</h3>

<h2>Baking powder alternatives and conversions</h2>

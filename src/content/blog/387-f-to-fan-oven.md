<p>387 F converts to approximately 197 C in a fan oven. This is a common temperature for roasting vegetables, baking cakes, or cooking meats to perfection in both air fryers and conventional fan ovens. Understanding these conversions is crucial for anyone moving between American recipes and UK appliances.</p>

<h2>Why Temperature Conversion Matters</h2>
<p>When using recipes from different regions, temperature accuracy makes all the difference. A 387 F fan oven conversion ensures your dishes cook evenly without burning or undercooking. Many air fryer recipes at <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> provide dual measurements for this exact reason.</p>
<p>Fan ovens circulate hot air differently than conventional ovens, which affects cooking times. The 387 F to electric fan oven equivalent accounts for this airflow, giving you consistent results. This is particularly important for baked goods where precise temperatures are critical.</p>

<h2>How to Convert 387 F to Fan Oven</h2>
<p>The standard conversion formula reduces Fahrenheit by 32, multiplies by 5/9, then subtracts 10-20% for fan ovens. For 387 F, this gives us 197 C as the ideal fan oven setting. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> simplifies this process for all common temperatures.</p>
<p>Some ovens may vary slightly, so it's worth checking your manufacturer's guidelines. The 387 F fan oven conversion works perfectly for most modern appliances, including combi ovens and air fryers with convection settings.</p>

<h3>Air Fryer Adjustments for 387 F</h3>
<p>When using an air fryer at 387 F equivalent, you'll typically need to reduce cooking times by 20%. The intense circulating air cooks food faster than traditional ovens. Check our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a> for specific timing guidance on different dishes.</p>

<h2>Common Uses for 387 F in Cooking</h2>
<p>This temperature is ideal for roasting vegetables like potatoes or carrots to crispy perfection. It's also excellent for baking cookies that need slightly crisp edges with soft centres. Many chicken dishes at <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>our chicken recipe category</a> recommend this temperature range.</p>
<p>For frozen foods, 387 F provides enough heat to crisp the exterior while thoroughly cooking the interior. This makes it perfect for reheating pizza or cooking frozen chips in your air fryer. Always preheat your appliance for best results at this temperature.</p>

<h3>Comparing 387 F Across Cooking Methods</h3>
<p>The 387 F convection oven equivalent will cook slightly faster than a conventional oven but slower than most air fryers. Understanding these differences helps when adapting recipes between appliances. Our conversion guides take the guesswork out of these adjustments.</p>

<h2>Tips for Perfect Results at 387 F</h2>
<p>Always use an oven thermometer to verify your appliance's accuracy. The 387 F fan oven setting should produce consistent, reliable results when properly calibrated.

<p>Consider the size and material of your cookware when using 387 F. Dark metal pans absorb more heat, while glass dishes may require slight temperature adjustments. The same principles apply whether you're using an air fryer basket or conventional baking tray.</p>

<p>985 ml of coconut milk equals approximately 4.16 cups (using the standard UK metric cup measurement of 236.588 ml per cup). Whether you're preparing a creamy curry or a decadent dessert in your air fryer, getting the measurements right is key. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we understand the importance of precision, especially when working with rich ingredients like coconut milk.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter</h2>

<h3>How to Measure Coconut Milk Correctly</h3>  
<p>For the most accurate results, use a liquid measuring cup rather than dry measuring cups.

Stirring the coconut milk before measuring helps avoid separation, giving you a consistent texture in your dish.</p>

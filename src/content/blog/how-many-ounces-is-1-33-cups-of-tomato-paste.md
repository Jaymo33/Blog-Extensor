<p>1.33 cups of tomato paste equals approximately 10.64 ounces. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements ensure perfect results. Whether you're making a rich pasta sauce or a hearty stew, knowing the exact weight helps maintain consistency. Tomato paste is a staple in many dishes, and getting the measurements right can make all the difference. For more air fryer conversion tips, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Using the correct amount of tomato paste ensures your dish has the right balance of flavour and texture. Too much can overpower other ingredients, while too little might leave your meal tasting bland. Air fryers cook food quickly, so precise measurements help avoid under or overcooking. Tomato paste is concentrated, so even small deviations can affect the outcome. For more recipe ideas, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> collection.</p>  

<p>Tomato paste is often sold in cans or tubes, making it tricky to measure by volume. Converting cups to ounces simplifies the process, especially when scaling recipes. If you're preparing a large batch, knowing the weight ensures uniformity. Many air fryer recipes call for small quantities, so accuracy is key. Visit <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> for more cooking tips and tricks.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure Tomato Paste for Air Fryer Recipes</h3>  
<p>For best results, use a kitchen scale to weigh tomato paste directly. If you don't have one, spoon the paste into a measuring cup and level it off. Remember, 1.33 cups of tomato paste equals 10.64 ounces, so adjust accordingly. Sticky ingredients like tomato paste can be messy, so a scale saves time and cleanup. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner</a> guide for easy maintenance.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for Tomato Paste in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Tomato paste adds depth to sauces, marinades, and even roasted vegetables in the air fryer. Its concentrated flavour works well in dishes like meatballs, stuffed peppers, or homemade pizza. Since air fryers circulate hot air, tomato paste helps create a rich, caramelised finish. For inspiration, browse our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable recipes</a> section.</p>  

<p>When substituting fresh tomatoes for paste, remember that 1.33 cups of tomato paste is roughly equivalent to 3 cups of pureed tomatoes. This ratio ensures your dish retains its intended flavour profile. Air fryer recipes often benefit from the intensity of tomato paste, so measure carefully.

<h3>Storing Leftover Tomato Paste</h3>  
<p>If you have leftover tomato paste, transfer it to an airtight container and refrigerate. It will keep for up to a week, or you can freeze it in portions for future use. Label containers with the weight (e.g., 10.64 ounces) for easy reference. This way, you’ll always have the right amount on hand for your next air fryer creation.</p>

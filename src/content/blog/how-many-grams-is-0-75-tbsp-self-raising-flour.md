<h2>Why accurate flour measurements matter</h2>
<p>Baking is a science, and even small discrepancies in flour measurements can affect your results. Too much flour can make your cakes dense, while too little can leave them flat. Using grams instead of tablespoons eliminates guesswork, especially with self-raising flour, which contains baking powder. Air fryer recipes, like those on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>our recipes page</a>, often require precision for even cooking. Measuring by weight ensures your bakes turn out perfectly every time.</p>

<p>Self-raising flour is a staple in British baking, and its unique composition means it behaves differently to plain flour. The added raising agents mean that the weight per tablespoon can vary slightly. For 0.75 tbsp of self-raising flour, the 5.6-gram measurement is a reliable average. If you're adapting a recipe for your air fryer, this accuracy is key to success.</p>

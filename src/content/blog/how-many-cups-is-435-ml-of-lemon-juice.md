Whether you're making a zesty marinade or a tangy dessert, knowing how to convert millilitres to cups will save you time and hassle.</p>

<p>Lemon juice is a versatile ingredient in air fryer recipes, from glazes to dressings. If you're working with 435 ml, it's helpful to know both UK and US cup sizes differ slightly. UK cups hold 284 ml, while US cups are 240 ml. This distinction ensures your <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipes</a> turn out as intended, whether you're following a British or American cookbook.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure 435 ml of Lemon Juice Without a Measuring Cup</h3>  
<p>No measuring cup? No problem. A standard UK mug holds about 300 ml, so 435 ml is roughly one and a half mugs. For US measurements, it's closer to two small coffee cups. If precision is key, use a kitchen scale: 435 ml of lemon juice weighs approximately 435 grams, as its density is nearly 1:1 with water.</p>

<h3>Adjusting Recipes for Different Cup Measurements</h3>  
<p>If a recipe calls for 435 ml of lemon juice but lists cups, round to the nearest quarter-cup for ease. In US terms, that's 1¾ cups; in the UK, it's 1½ cups plus 1 tablespoon. Small adjustments won't drastically alter most dishes, but for baking, stick to exact conversions for best results.</p>  

<p>Remember, fresh lemon juice tastes brighter than bottled, but both work in a pinch. If substituting bottled, reduce added salt in the recipe to compensate for preservatives.

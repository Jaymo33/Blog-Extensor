<p>1.33 cups of sugar syrup is approximately 10.64 ounces. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements can make or break your dish. Whether you're glazing desserts or sweetening sauces, knowing the exact weight ensures consistency. For more air fryer measurement tips, visit <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>our conversion chart</a>.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on even heat distribution, and incorrect ingredient quantities can lead to uneven cooking. Sugar syrup, in particular, affects texture and caramelisation. Too much can make dishes overly sticky, while too little may leave them bland. Using 1.33 cups of sugar syrup (10.64 oz) ensures balanced sweetness. Explore <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>our recipe collection</a> for perfectly measured dishes.</p>  

<p>Many air fryer recipes, like glazed chicken or caramelised desserts, call for sugar syrup. Measuring by weight (ounces) is often more reliable than volume (cups) due to syrup’s viscosity. A kitchen scale eliminates guesswork, especially when scaling recipes up or down. For cleaning sticky residues, try <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>our recommended cleaner</a>.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure Sugar Syrup Without a Scale</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a scale, use the displacement method: fill a liquid measuring cup to 1.33 cups, ensuring the syrup settles evenly. Stir gently to remove air bubbles for accuracy. Note that UK and US cup sizes differ slightly, so stick to one system. For UK-specific conversions, 1.33 cups of sugar syrup equals 10.64 oz.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for 1.33 Cups of Sugar Syrup in Air Fryers</h2>  
<p>This quantity is ideal for glazing <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>air fryer chicken</a> or drizzling over desserts like churros. It’s also perfect for making sticky sauces or candying nuts. The 10.64-ounce measurement ensures enough syrup for coating without overwhelming other flavours. Check out <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert recipes</a> for inspiration.</p>  

<p>For frozen treats, 1.33 cups of sugar syrup can sweeten fruit compotes or ice cream toppings. Its thickness helps create glossy finishes on baked goods. Remember, air fryers cook faster than ovens, so syrups may caramelise quicker. Adjust cooking times to avoid burning.</p>  

<h3>Converting Other Sugar Syrup Quantities</h3>  
<p>Need to scale up? Double 1.33 cups to 2.66 cups (21.28 oz) for larger batches. Halve it to 0.665 cups (5.32 oz) for smaller portions.

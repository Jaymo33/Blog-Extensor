<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Baking is a science, and even small deviations in measurements can affect texture and taste. Cocoa powder, in particular, can clump or settle, leading to inconsistent cup measurements. Using grams ensures you get the exact amount needed for your recipe. This is especially important in air fryer baking, where heat distribution is rapid and precise.

<p>Many UK and US recipes differ in cup sizes, so knowing the gram equivalent avoids confusion. A standard UK cup holds 250ml, while a US cup is 240ml, but the weight of cocoa powder remains roughly the same. Always fluff and level your cocoa powder for the most accurate measurement.

<h3>How to Measure Cocoa Powder Correctly</h3>  
<p>For the most precise measurement, use a kitchen scale. Spoon the cocoa powder into the cup lightly without packing it down, then level it off with a knife. This prevents over-measuring, which can make baked goods dry or bitter. If you don’t have scales, fluffing the powder with a fork before measuring helps.</p>

<p>335 ml of orange juice equals approximately 1.42 cups. This conversion is essential for precise measurements in recipes, especially when using an air fryer where accuracy can impact cooking results. Whether you're whipping up a marinade, glaze, or baking a citrus-infused dessert, knowing how to convert millilitres to cups ensures consistency. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we focus on making kitchen conversions simple so you can focus on creating delicious meals.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on precise ingredient ratios to achieve even cooking and perfect textures. Using too much or too little liquid, like orange juice, can affect moisture levels and cooking times. For example, a marinade with 335 ml of orange juice (1.42 cups) will distribute flavours evenly if measured correctly. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> helps eliminate guesswork, ensuring your dishes turn out perfectly every time.</p>  

<p>Recipes like orange-glazed chicken or citrus cakes often call for millilitres, but many home cooks prefer using cups for convenience. Converting 335 ml of orange juice to cups ensures you follow the recipe without needing specialised tools. This is particularly helpful for air fryer recipes, where small adjustments can make a big difference. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a> for more inspiration.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure 335 ml of Orange Juice Without a Measuring Jug</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a measuring jug, you can still accurately measure 335 ml of orange juice using standard cups. A US cup holds 240 ml, so 335 ml is roughly 1 cup plus 3 tablespoons. For UK cups (284 ml), it’s about 1 cup and 2 teaspoons. This method works well for air fryer recipes where precision matters but tools are limited.</p>  

<h2>Common Recipes Using 335 ml of Orange Juice</h2>  
<p>Many air fryer recipes benefit from the bright, tangy flavour of orange juice. Dishes like orange-glazed salmon or citrus-marinated tofu often use around 335 ml (1.42 cups) for optimal taste. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipes</a> section includes several dishes where this measurement comes in handy. Whether you're marinating or baking, accurate conversions ensure success.</p>  

<p>For desserts, 335 ml of orange juice can be used in cakes or glazes to add moisture and flavour. Air fryer baking requires careful measurement to avoid soggy or dry results. If you're experimenting with new recipes, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning tips</a> will help keep your appliance in top condition after cooking sticky citrus-based dishes.</p>  

<h3>Adjusting Recipes for Different Cup Sizes</h3>  
<p>It’s important to note that US and UK cup sizes differ slightly. For 335 ml of orange juice, the US measurement is 1.42 cups, while the UK equivalent is about 1.18 cups. Always check which standard your recipe uses to avoid discrepancies. This is especially crucial for air fryer cooking, where liquid ratios affect crispiness and texture.</p>

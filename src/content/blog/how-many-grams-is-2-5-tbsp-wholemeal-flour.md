<p>2.5 tablespoons (tbsp) of wholemeal flour equals approximately 20 grams. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precision ensures perfect texture and consistency. Whether you're coating chicken, baking cakes, or making crispy snacks, knowing exact measurements makes all the difference. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we help you nail every recipe with accurate conversions.</p>

<h2>Why accurate flour measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of wholemeal flour ensures your air fryer dishes turn out just right. Too much flour can make coatings dense or dry, while too little may leave food undercoated. Wholemeal flour, with its coarse texture, behaves differently than plain flour, so precise grams matter. For recipes like air-fried chicken or veggie fritters, 2.5 tbsp (20g) provides the ideal balance. Check our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for other common measurements.</p>  

<p>Wholemeal flour adds fibre and nuttiness to dishes, but its density varies slightly by brand. A digital kitchen scale removes guesswork, especially for baking. If you're adapting a regular oven recipe for the air fryer, converting tablespoons to grams ensures consistency. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipe collection</a> includes tested measurements for foolproof results every time.</p>  

<h3>How to measure 2.5 tbsp of wholemeal flour without scales</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have scales, use the spoon-and-level method for accuracy. Lightly spoon flour into the tablespoon without packing it down, then level off the excess with a knife. Repeat until you’ve measured 2.5 tbsp (roughly 20g). For air fryer batters or coatings, this method works well in a pinch. However, for baking recipes like air fryer muffins or bread, we recommend investing in scales for reliability.</p>  

<h2>Common air fryer recipes using 2.5 tbsp wholemeal flour</h2>  
<p>Many air fryer dishes call for small amounts of wholemeal flour. Coating chicken tenders or fish fillets typically requires about 2.5 tbsp (20g) to achieve a crisp, golden finish. Veggie burgers or falafel also benefit from this quantity as a binder. Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipe category</a> for inspiration on using wholemeal flour in coatings.</p>  

<p>For healthier baking, 2.5 tbsp of wholemeal flour can replace some plain flour in air fryer cakes or cookies. It adds texture without overwhelming the recipe. When making batter for onion rings or tempura, this measurement ensures lightness. Remember, air fryers circulate heat differently than ovens, so precise measurements prevent drying or uneven cooking. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning guide</a> also helps maintain your appliance for consistent results.</p>  

<h3>Converting other flour amounts for air fryer use</h3>  
<p>If your recipe calls for different quantities, here’s a quick reference: 1 tbsp wholemeal flour ≈ 8g, 3 tbsp ≈ 24g. These conversions work for most UK wholemeal flour brands. When adapting recipes from cups to grams, note that 1 cup of wholemeal flour weighs about 120g.

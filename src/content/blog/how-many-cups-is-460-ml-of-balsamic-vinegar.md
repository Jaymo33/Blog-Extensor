<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Using the correct amount of balsamic vinegar ensures your dishes aren’t too acidic or overly sweet. The air fryer’s intense heat can amplify flavours, so even small measurement errors can affect the outcome. For example, a recipe calling for 460 ml of balsamic vinegar (roughly 1.94 cups) needs precision to avoid overpowering other ingredients.

<p>Many home cooks underestimate the importance of liquid measurements, especially in marinades or glazes. A slight variation in balsamic vinegar can alter the texture and taste of your dish. Whether you're preparing a <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipe</a> or a vegetarian option, consistency is key. Our guide simplifies conversions, so you spend less time measuring and more time enjoying your meal.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure 460 ml of Balsamic Vinegar Without a Scale</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a measuring jug, use standard cup measurements. Since 1 cup equals 236.6 ml, 460 ml is just under 2 cups. For better accuracy, fill a cup to the 3/4 mark twice, then add a tablespoon. This method works well for sticky liquids like balsamic vinegar, ensuring minimal waste.

<h2>Why converting 100g of brown sugar to ounces matters</h2>  
<p>When using an air fryer, precise measurements can make or break a recipe. Brown sugar, with its moisture content, can vary slightly in weight, but 100g reliably converts to 3.53 ounces. This accuracy is especially important for baking, where even small deviations can affect texture and taste.</p>  

<p>Many UK recipes, including those on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, list ingredients in grams. If your kitchen scale measures in ounces, this conversion ensures you’re using the right amount. No more guesswork—just perfect results every time.</p>  

<h3>How to measure brown sugar accurately</h3>  
<p>For the best results, use a digital kitchen scale to weigh your brown sugar. If you don’t have one, spoon the sugar into a measuring cup and level it off. Remember, packed brown sugar will weigh more than loosely filled, so 100g (3.53 oz) should be lightly packed for consistency.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for 100g of brown sugar in air fryer recipes</h2>

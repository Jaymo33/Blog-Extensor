<h2>Why converting 125g of vegetable oil to ounces matters</h2>

Converting 125g of vegetable oil to ounces (4.41 oz) helps you follow recipes precisely, especially those from international sources.

<p>Vegetable oil is a staple in air frying because of its high smoke point and neutral taste.

If you’re experimenting with recipes from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>our collection</a>, this conversion ensures you never miss the mark.</p>  

<h3>How to measure 125g of vegetable oil without scales</h3>  
<p>No kitchen scales? No problem. One tablespoon of vegetable oil weighs roughly 14g, so 125g equals about 9 tablespoons (or 4.41 oz). For larger batches, a standard UK measuring cup holds 240ml, which is close to 220g of vegetable oil (7.76 oz). Remember, air fryers need less oil than traditional frying, so 125g goes a long way.

<h2>Common uses for 125g of vegetable oil in air fryers</h2>  
<p>From crispy tofu to golden fish fillets, 125g (4.41 oz) of vegetable oil is versatile. It’s enough to coat a family-sized portion of potatoes for roasting or to mix into a batter for onion rings. Unlike deep frying, air fryers circulate hot air, so you’ll use far less oil—making 125g sufficient for multiple meals. For example, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipes</a> often call for this quantity to achieve juicy interiors and crunchy exteriors.</p>

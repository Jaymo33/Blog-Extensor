<p>1.5 cups of caster sugar equals approximately 10.58 ounces (oz) in UK measurements. This conversion is essential for precise baking, especially when using an air fryer where measurements matter. Whether you're whipping up cakes, cookies, or desserts, knowing the exact weight ensures perfect results every time.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate sugar measurements matter in air fryer baking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers require precise ingredient ratios to achieve the best texture and taste. Too much or too little sugar can affect browning, crispiness, and overall flavour. For example, if you're making <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>air fryer cakes</a>, an incorrect sugar measurement could lead to a dry or overly sweet result. That’s why converting cups to ounces is so important.</p>  

<p>Many UK recipes use weight measurements rather than volume, as it’s more consistent. A kitchen scale is your best friend here, but if you don’t have one, our conversion guide will help. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more handy measurement swaps.</p>  

<h3>How to measure 1.5 cups of caster sugar without a scale</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a scale, use the spoon-and-level method for accuracy. Spoon the caster sugar into a measuring cup without packing it down, then level it off with a straight edge. This ensures you’re not adding extra sugar, which could throw off your recipe. For air fryer baking, precision is key—especially with delicate desserts like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cookies>cookies</a> or meringues.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for 1.5 cups of caster sugar in air fryer recipes</h2>  
<p>This amount of sugar is perfect for small-batch baking. You might use it in a single-layer cake, a batch of shortbread, or even a fruity crumble. Since air fryers cook faster than conventional ovens, getting the sugar ratio right ensures even caramelisation and a perfect rise.</p>  

<p>Looking for inspiration? Browse our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> to find sweet and savoury dishes that make the most of precise measurements. From fluffy sponges to crispy churros, the right sugar amount makes all the difference.</p>  

<h3>Does caster sugar weigh the same as granulated sugar?</h3>  
<p>No, caster sugar is finer, so it packs slightly differently. While the weight difference is minimal, it’s best to stick to the type specified in your recipe. If substituting, check our conversion guide or use a scale for accuracy.

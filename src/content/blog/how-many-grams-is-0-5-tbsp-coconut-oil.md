<p>0.5 tbsp of coconut oil equals approximately 7 grams. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements can make or break your dish. Whether you’re making crispy roasted vegetables or a decadent dessert, knowing the exact weight ensures consistent results.

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air frying</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on even heat distribution, and incorrect oil quantities can lead to uneven cooking or soggy results. Using 0.5 tbsp of coconut oil (7 grams) ensures your food gets that perfect crispiness without excess grease. Coconut oil is a popular choice for air frying due to its high smoke point and subtle flavour. If you’re new to air frying, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a> for inspiration.</p>  

<p>Many UK recipes list coconut oil in tablespoons, but grams provide a more precise measurement. Digital scales eliminate guesswork, especially when dealing with small quantities like 0.5 tbsp. For a deeper dive into air fryer techniques, visit <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>.</p>  

<h3>How to measure 0.5 tbsp of coconut oil</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a scale, use a standard UK tablespoon (15ml) and fill it halfway for 0.5 tbsp. Melted coconut oil is easier to measure accurately, as solid oil can vary in density. For best results, weigh it out to confirm you’ve got the right 7 grams.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for 0.5 tbsp coconut oil in air fryers</h2>  
<p>This small quantity is perfect for lightly coating vegetables like Brussels sprouts or sweet potatoes before air frying. It’s also ideal for greasing baking pans when making air fryer cakes or cookies. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert recipes</a> for sweet ideas.</p>  

<p>For proteins like chicken or tofu, 0.5 tbsp of coconut oil helps achieve a golden crust without drying out the meat. It’s a healthier alternative to heavier oils, keeping your meals lower in calories. Don’t forget to clean your air fryer afterward with our recommended <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning guide</a>.</p>  

<h3>Converting other coconut oil quantities</h3>  
<p>If your recipe calls for 1 tbsp, that’s roughly 14 grams. For larger batches, simply scale up—2 tbsp equals about 28 grams. Remember, these conversions apply specifically to coconut oil; other oils have different densities.</p>

<p>100g of olive oil is approximately 3.53 ounces. This conversion is essential for air fryer cooking, where precise measurements can make or break a recipe. Whether you’re drizzling oil over chips or marinating chicken, knowing the exact weight ensures consistent results. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we focus on making conversions simple so you can cook with confidence.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Olive Oil Measurements Matter in Air Fryers</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of olive oil in your air fryer prevents soggy or overly dry results. Too much oil can lead to uneven cooking, while too little may leave food sticking to the basket. For example, crispy potatoes need just the right drizzle—around 1-2 tablespoons (roughly 15-30ml or 0.5-1 oz) per serving. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for quick reference.</p>  

<p>Olive oil’s density means 100g takes up slightly less volume than water, so weighing it ensures accuracy. If you’re adapting recipes from American sources (which often use ounces), converting 100g to 3.53 oz keeps everything consistent. This is especially useful for baking air fryer cakes or roasting vegetables, where precision matters.</p>  

<h2>How to Measure 100g of Olive Oil Without Scales</h2>  
<p>No kitchen scales? No problem. One tablespoon of olive oil weighs about 14g, so 7 tablespoons will give you roughly 100g (or 3.53 oz). For smaller amounts, a teaspoon holds roughly 4.5g. Keep in mind that these are estimates—investing in a digital scale guarantees accuracy for recipes like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>air fryer chicken</a> or homemade dressings.</p>  

<h3>Common Mistakes When Measuring Olive Oil</h3>  
<p>Many cooks pour oil directly from the bottle, leading to over-pouring. Instead, use a measuring spoon or cup for control. Another pitfall is confusing fluid ounces (volume) with weight ounces—100g is a weight measurement, not volume. For oil, 100g equals 3.53 oz by weight, not fluid ounces.</p>  

<h2>Converting Other Olive Oil Amounts for Air Fryer Recipes</h2>  
<p>Need 50g? That’s 1.76 oz. For 200g, double the 100g measurement to 7.05 oz. Bookmark our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe hub</a> for dishes that specify grams or ounces, like crispy tofu or garlic mushrooms. Most UK recipes use grams, but if you’re using an American air fryer cookbook, these conversions will save time.</p>  

<h3>Olive Oil Substitutes in Air Fryers</h3>  
<p>If you run out of olive oil, avocado oil (3.55 oz per 100g) or melted coconut oil (3.38 oz per 100g) work well. Avoid butter sprays—they often contain additives that gum up your air fryer basket.

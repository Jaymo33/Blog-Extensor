<p>3.5 cups of chicken broth equals 828 ml, making it easy to measure for your air fryer recipes. Whether you're preparing soups, sauces, or marinades, knowing this conversion ensures accuracy in your cooking. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we help simplify kitchen measurements so you can focus on creating delicious meals.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Precision is key when using an air fryer, as even small measurement errors can affect texture and flavour. Chicken broth, a common ingredient in many dishes, needs exact conversions for consistent results. Whether you're making a hearty stew or a light sauce, 3.5 cups of chicken broth (828 ml) ensures the right balance. For more air fryer measurement tips, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>  

<p>Many air fryer recipes, like those in our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipes section</a>, rely on liquids like chicken broth for moisture and depth of flavour. Converting 3.5 cups to millilitres helps avoid guesswork, especially when scaling recipes up or down. This accuracy is particularly useful for meal prepping or batch cooking.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure 3.5 Cups of Chicken Broth Correctly</h3>  
<p>Use a liquid measuring cup for the most accurate results when portioning chicken broth. Fill it to the 3.5-cup mark or measure 828 ml using a metric jug. Avoid using dry measuring cups, as they won’t account for the liquid’s meniscus. For recipes requiring precision, like those in our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken category</a>, this step is essential.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for 3.5 Cups of Chicken Broth in Air Fryer Recipes</h2>  
<p>Chicken broth is versatile, adding richness to air fryer dishes like risottos, braised meats, and vegetable medleys. With 3.5 cups (828 ml), you can prepare enough broth for a family-sized meal or multiple servings. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetables section</a> for recipes that pair well with this quantity.</p>  

<p>Another great use for 3.5 cups of chicken broth is in marinades or deglazing an air fryer basket after cooking. The precise ml conversion ensures your flavours are balanced, whether you’re cooking poultry, seafood, or plant-based dishes.

<h3>UK vs. US Cup Measurements for Chicken Broth</h3>  
<p>While 3.5 cups of chicken broth equals 828 ml in both UK and US measurements, slight variations can occur based on cup size. For absolute precision, always use a standard metric measurement. This is especially useful when following international recipes from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>.</p>  

<h2>Tips for Storing Leftover Chicken Broth</h2>  
<p>If your recipe doesn’t use all 3.5 cups (828 ml) of chicken broth, store leftovers in an airtight container for up to 4 days. You can also freeze portions in ice cube trays for future air fryer recipes. This minimises waste and ensures you always have broth on hand for quick meals.</p>

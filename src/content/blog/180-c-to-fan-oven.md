<p>180 C in a fan oven is equivalent to 160 C in a conventional oven. This 20-degree reduction is standard for fan-assisted cooking, where circulating hot air cooks food more efficiently. When using your air fryer, which works similarly to a fan oven, you'll often find recipes calling for 180 C as it's ideal for everything from roasting vegetables to baking cakes.</p>

<h2>Understanding Fan Oven Temperatures</h2>
<p>The key difference with fan ovens is their ability to distribute heat evenly, meaning you can cook at lower temperatures than conventional ovens. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we recommend starting with this 20-degree reduction rule when converting recipes. For example, if a traditional recipe calls for 200 C, you'd set your fan oven to 180 C instead. This principle applies equally to air fryers, which use rapid air technology similar to convection cooking.</p>
<p>Many modern recipes now specify fan oven temperatures directly, eliminating the need for conversion. However, older cookbooks or international recipes might still use conventional oven settings. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> can help you navigate these differences effortlessly, whether you're baking, roasting, or reheating.</p>

<h3>Why 180 C Works So Well</h3>
<p>180 C has become a go-to temperature for fan ovens and air fryers because it's hot enough to crisp and brown food while gentle enough to cook through evenly. This makes it perfect for everything from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>roast chicken</a> to Victoria sponge cakes. The circulating air prevents hot spots that can cause uneven cooking in conventional ovens.</p>

<h2>Converting Between Cooking Appliances</h2>
<p>When moving between fan ovens, conventional ovens, and air fryers, temperature adjustments are often needed. While 180 C in a fan oven equals 160 C conventional, air fryers typically use the same temperature as fan ovens due to their similar cooking mechanisms. This makes converting recipes between these appliances straightforward.</p>
<p>For those using American recipes with Fahrenheit measurements, 180 C converts to 350 F in a fan oven. Remember that cooking times may vary slightly between appliances - air fryers generally cook faster than ovens due to their compact size. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a> for tried-and-tested fan oven and air fryer adaptations.</p>

<h3>Special Considerations for Baking</h3>
<p>When baking at 180 C in a fan oven, you might need to reduce cooking times by 5-10 minutes compared to conventional oven recipes. The rapid air circulation can cause cakes and pastries to dry out if left too long. For best results, start checking for doneness a few minutes before the recipe suggests.</p>

<h2>Air Fryer Specifics at 180 C</h2>
<p>Air fryers excel at 180 C for creating crispy textures without excessive oil. This temperature is ideal for frozen foods like chips or chicken nuggets, yielding golden results in about 15-20 minutes. The same principles apply as with fan ovens - the circulating hot air ensures even cooking from all angles.</p>
<p>Maintenance is key for consistent performance at 180 C. Regular cleaning with <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>proper tools</a> prevents smoke from built-up grease and ensures accurate temperature control. Unlike conventional ovens, air fryers reach their set temperature almost immediately, making them more energy-efficient for quick meals.</p>

<h3>Troubleshooting Common Issues</h3>
<p>If food isn't cooking evenly at 180 C in your fan oven or air fryer, try reducing the quantity you're cooking at once. Overcrowding prevents proper air circulation. Also ensure your appliances are properly preheated - while air fryers heat up quickly, fan ovens may need 10-15 minutes to stabilise at 180 C.</p>

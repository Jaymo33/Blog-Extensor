<p>0.5 tbsp of powdered milk equals approximately 3.75 grams. This conversion is essential for precision in air fryer recipes, especially when baking or making sauces. Powdered milk is a versatile ingredient, often used in everything from cakes to creamy coatings for chicken. Getting the measurement right ensures your dishes turn out perfectly every time.</p>

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on precise ingredient ratios to deliver consistent results. Too much or too little powdered milk can affect texture and taste, particularly in baked goods like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>air fryer cakes</a>. For example, adding extra powdered milk might make batters too dense, while skimping could leave sauces watery. Digital scales are ideal for measuring small quantities like 0.5 tbsp, as spoon measurements can vary.</p>  
<p>Many <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> call for powdered milk because it doesn’t add excess moisture. This is crucial for achieving crispy coatings on fried chicken or even <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cookies>cookies</a>. If you’re converting a traditional recipe to air fryer cooking, knowing exact gram equivalents helps adapt portions correctly.</p>  

<h3>How to measure 0.5 tbsp powdered milk without scales</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a scale, lightly spoon powdered milk into a tablespoon and level it off with a knife. Split this in half for 0.5 tbsp—though weighing is more reliable. Storing powdered milk in an airtight container prevents clumping, which can throw off measurements. For frequent bakers, keeping a <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a> handy saves time.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for powdered milk in air fryer recipes</h2>  
<p>Powdered milk works wonders in air fryer breadings, like for crispy tofu or <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>fried chicken</a>. It adds richness without making coatings soggy. In desserts, it enhances the creaminess of mug cakes or custards. Some cooks even mix it into spice rubs for extra depth.</p>  
<p>When reconstituting powdered milk for sauces, stick to the 0.5 tbsp (3.75g) to water ratio specified in recipes. Too much water dilutes flavour, while too little creates lumps. Always sift powdered milk before mixing to avoid graininess in batters or doughs.</p>  

<h3>Tips for storing and using powdered milk</h3>  
<p>Keep powdered milk in a cool, dark place to maintain freshness. If your air fryer recipes call for small amounts like 0.5 tbsp, consider pre-measuring portions in jars.

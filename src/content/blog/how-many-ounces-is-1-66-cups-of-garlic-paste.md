<p>1.66 cups of garlic paste equals approximately 13.28 ounces. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements can make or break a dish. Whether you're whipping up a garlic-infused marinade or a flavourful paste for meats, knowing the exact weight ensures consistency. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we understand the importance of accuracy, especially when working with potent ingredients like garlic paste.</p>

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on even cooking, and incorrect measurements can lead to uneven results. Too much garlic paste might overpower your dish, while too little could leave it bland. For example, if you're preparing a garlic butter shrimp recipe from our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipes</a> section, 13.28 ounces of garlic paste ensures the perfect balance. Precise measurements also help when scaling recipes up or down, which is handy for meal prepping.</p>  
<p>Garlic paste is denser than liquids like water, so volume-to-weight conversions aren't always straightforward. A standard cup holds 8 fluid ounces, but garlic paste weighs more due to its thick consistency. That's why using weight measurements (ounces) is often more reliable than volume (cups). This is particularly useful for air fryer cooking, where ingredients need to be evenly distributed for optimal crisping.</p>  

<h3>How to measure garlic paste for air fryer recipes</h3>  
<p>For the most accurate results, use a kitchen scale to weigh your garlic paste. If you don't have one, spoon the paste into a measuring cup and level it off with a knife. Remember, 1.66 cups of garlic paste translates to roughly 13.28 ounces, but slight variations can occur depending on the paste's thickness. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for other common ingredient conversions.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for garlic paste in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Garlic paste is a versatile ingredient that adds depth to many air fryer dishes. From marinades for chicken to flavourful coatings for roasted vegetables, it's a staple in many kitchens. For instance, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipes</a> often call for garlic paste to enhance taste and tenderness. Knowing that 1.66 cups equals 13.28 ounces helps you adjust quantities without compromising flavour.</p>  
<p>Another popular use is in homemade sauces or dips, where garlic paste provides a concentrated burst of flavour. Whether you're making aioli or a spicy glaze, precise measurements ensure the right intensity. If you're working with frozen foods, like our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/frozen-foods>frozen foods collection</a>, garlic paste can elevate simple ingredients into restaurant-quality meals.</p>  

<h3>Tips for storing and handling garlic paste</h3>  
<p>To keep your garlic paste fresh, store it in an airtight container in the fridge. If you've measured out 13.28 ounces (1.66 cups) but only need a portion, freeze the rest in ice cube trays for later use. This way, you'll always have pre-measured amounts ready for your next air fryer adventure. Don't forget to clean your air fryer basket after cooking with garlic-heavy dishesâ€”our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner guide</a> has handy tips.</p>

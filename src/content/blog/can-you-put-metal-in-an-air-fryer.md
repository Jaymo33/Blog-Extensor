<p>No, you should not put most metal objects in an air fryer due to fire risks and potential damage to the appliance. The intense circulating heat can cause arcing (sparks) with certain metals, while others may scratch non-stick coatings or block airflow. Always prioritise manufacturer guidelines over general advice.</p>

<h2>Why Metal Poses Risks in Air Fryers</h2>
<p>Air fryers use rapid air circulation at high temperatures, typically between 160°C to 200°C. Metal conducts heat exceptionally well, which can create hotspots that damage the appliance's interior or even melt components. Some users report success with small perforated metal trays in specific models like the Ninja Foodi, but this isn't universally safe. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we've tested dozens of models and found aluminium foil is occasionally permitted if used correctly - never letting it touch heating elements.</p>
<p>The primary danger comes from electrical arcing, where electricity jumps between metal surfaces. This is especially risky with stainless steel utensils or baking pans not designed for air fryers. Even if no immediate damage occurs, repeated metal use can degrade your air fryer's non-stick coating over time. For safer alternatives, check our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning guide</a> that recommends silicone liners instead.</p>

<h3>Exceptions Where Metal Might Be Safe</h3>
<p>A few air fryer accessories incorporate metal safely. Perforated pizza pans or mesh racks designed specifically for your model often work because their materials and shape account for airflow needs. Always verify compatibility in your manual first. Some UK brands like Tefal explicitly approve certain metal inserts, while others like Philips prohibit all metal entirely.</p>

<h2>What Happens If You Use Metal Accidentally?</h2>
<p>Immediate effects range from harmless to hazardous. Light metal utensils might simply scratch surfaces, while crumpled foil blocking vents could cause overheating. In worst-case scenarios, metal touching heating elements can spark or melt internal components. If you've accidentally used metal, unplug the air fryer immediately and inspect for damage before next use.</p>
<p>Many modern air fryers have safety shutoffs that trigger when detecting electrical arcing. However, relying on these failsafes isn't advisable. For those who've encountered issues, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe hub</a> includes foil-free cooking methods for popular dishes like crispy chicken or roasted vegetables.</p>

<h3>Safer Alternatives to Metal in Air Fryers</h3>
<p>Silicone baskets and parchment paper liners are the go-to substitutes. Silicone withstands high heat without affecting crispiness, while perforated parchment prevents sticking without airflow obstruction. Glass or ceramic oven-safe dishes also work for certain recipes, though they may extend cooking times slightly.</p>

<h2>Manufacturer-Specific Metal Guidelines</h2>
<p>UK models vary significantly in their metal policies. Ninja's dual-zone models often allow metal racks, whereas Cosori strictly prohibits all metal except their branded accessories. Always cross-reference your manual - many are available digitally if you've misplaced the physical copy. When in doubt, assume metal isn't safe.</p>
<p>For those investing in new accessories, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a> helps adapt traditional oven recipes without metal cookware. This is especially handy for baking enthusiasts wanting to try <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/Cakes>air fryer cakes</a> without risking their tins.</p>

<h3>Myth Busting: Common Metal Misconceptions</h3>
<p>Contrary to some claims, aluminium foil doesn't "reflect heat better" in air fryers - it disrupts the crucial air circulation. Likewise, stainless steel won't necessarily melt, but it can warp at high temperatures. Even pre-heating metal (as some suggest) doesn't eliminate arcing risks with certain models.</p>

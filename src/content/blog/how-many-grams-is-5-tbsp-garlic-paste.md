<p>5 tablespoons (tbsp) of garlic paste equals approximately 75 grams (g). This conversion is essential for precision in cooking, especially when using an air fryer where ingredient ratios can affect texture and flavour. Whether you’re whipping up a marinade or a sauce, knowing the exact weight ensures consistent results every time.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Garlic Paste Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Garlic paste is a staple in many recipes, from marinades to stir-fries, and its intensity can vary based on quantity. Using too much or too little can throw off the balance of your dish. For air fryer cooking, where flavours concentrate due to rapid air circulation, precise measurements are even more critical. A slight miscalculation could lead to overpowering garlic notes or a lack of depth.</p>  
<p>At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we emphasise the importance of accurate conversions to help you achieve restaurant-quality results at home. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> simplifies these calculations, so you never have to guess again.</p>  

<h2>How to Measure 5 Tbsp of Garlic Paste</h2>  
<p>If you don’t have a kitchen scale, measuring spoons are the next best tool. Ensure your tablespoons are level for accuracy—scooping too much or too little can skew the gram equivalent. For thicker pastes, gently press down to remove air pockets, but avoid compacting it unnaturally.</p>  
<p>For those who prefer weight measurements, investing in a digital scale is a game-changer. It eliminates guesswork and is particularly handy for recipes like our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer garlic butter shrimp</a>, where precision ensures perfect succulence.</p>  

<h3>UK vs. US Tablespoon Measurements</h3>  
<p>In the UK, a tablespoon holds 15 millilitres (ml), while the US tablespoon is slightly smaller at 14.79 ml. However, for garlic paste, the difference in weight is negligible—roughly 1–2 grams per 5 tbsp. Still, if you’re following a recipe from a US source, it’s worth double-checking.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for 5 Tbsp Garlic Paste</h2>  
<p>Five tablespoons of garlic paste is enough to flavour a family-sized portion of dishes like garlic bread, roasted vegetables, or a hearty <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>garlic chicken recipe</a>. In an air fryer, the paste caramelises beautifully, adding depth without burning—provided you distribute it evenly.</p>  
<p>For meal preppers, pre-measuring 75-gram portions saves time. Store extras in an airtight container or freeze them in ice cube trays for future use. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/meal-prep>meal prep section</a> for more time-saving tips.</p>  

<h3>Substitutes for Garlic Paste</h3>  
<p>If you’re out of garlic paste, minced garlic or powder can work in a pinch. Use 1 clove of minced garlic (about 5 g) per tbsp of paste, or 1/8 tsp of powder. Adjust to taste, as these substitutes vary in potency.</p>

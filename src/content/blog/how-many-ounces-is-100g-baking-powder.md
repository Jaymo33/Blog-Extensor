<p>100g of baking powder equals approximately 3.53 ounces. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes, where precise measurements can make or break your dish. Whether you're whipping up cakes, muffins, or savoury bakes, knowing how to convert grams to ounces ensures consistency. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we understand the importance of accurate measurements, especially when using an air fryer.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer baking</h2>  
<p>Baking powder is a leavening agent, and using the wrong amount can affect the texture and rise of your baked goods. Too little, and your cakes won’t rise properly; too much, and they might collapse. Converting 100g of baking powder to ounces (3.53 oz) helps you follow recipes precisely. Air fryers cook differently than conventional ovens, so precision is key. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more handy tips.</p>  

<p>Many UK recipes use grams, while others prefer ounces, so knowing both systems is useful. If you're adapting a family recipe or trying something new from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>our collection</a>, this conversion will save time and hassle. A digital kitchen scale is the best tool for accuracy, but if you only have measuring spoons, our guide helps you approximate correctly.</p>  

<h2>How to measure 100g of baking powder without scales</h2>  
<p>If you don’t have a scale, you can still measure 100g of baking powder using volume. One tablespoon of baking powder weighs roughly 10g, so 10 tablespoons equal 100g (or 3.53 oz). However, this method isn’t as precise as weighing, so for best results, invest in a good scale. Air fryer baking is all about consistency, and small errors can lead to big differences in texture.</p>  

<h3>Converting other baking ingredients</h3>  
<p>While 100g of baking powder is 3.53 oz, other ingredients have different conversions. For example, 100g of flour is about 3.5 oz, but 100g of sugar is closer to 3.6 oz. Always check specific ingredient conversions to avoid mistakes. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>cake recipes</a> rely on precise measurements, so bookmark this guide for future reference.</p>  

<h2>Common mistakes when measuring baking powder</h2>  
<p>One common error is confusing baking powder with baking soda—they’re not interchangeable! Baking powder contains both an acid and a base, while baking soda needs an acidic ingredient to activate. Another mistake is using old baking powder, which loses potency over time. Always check the expiry date and store it in a cool, dry place.

<h3>Using conversions in air fryer recipes</h3>  
<p>Air fryers heat up quickly, so precise measurements prevent overcooking or undercooking. If a recipe calls for 100g of baking powder (3.53 oz), stick to that amount unless adjusting for altitude or humidity. Experimenting is fun, but for reliable results, follow trusted conversions. Whether you're making fluffy pancakes or crispy treats, accurate measurements ensure success every time.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Baking</h2>

<p>Using a kitchen scale is the most reliable method, as cup measurements can vary based on how the sugar is packed. If you’re working with American recipes, note that UK and US cup sizes differ slightly, but 1.5 cups of icing sugar will still hover around 180 grams. This precision is crucial for air fryer baking, where even heat distribution relies on balanced ingredients.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure Icing Sugar Correctly</h3>  
<p>To measure 1.5 cups of icing sugar accurately, fluff the sugar first to avoid compaction. Spoon it lightly into a measuring cup and level it off with a knife. For best results, weigh it on a scale—180 grams is your target. This method eliminates guesswork, ensuring your <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>air fryer cakes</a> or cookies have the perfect consistency.</p>  

<h2>Converting Cups to Grams for Different Ingredients</h2>  
<p>While 1.5 cups of icing sugar is 180 grams, other ingredients have different conversions. Flour, for example, weighs less per cup, while brown sugar is denser. Always refer to a trusted conversion guide when switching between volume and weight measurements, especially for air fryer recipes where precision impacts cooking times and results.</p>  

<p>If you’re scaling a recipe up or down, knowing these conversions saves time and avoids mishaps. For instance, halving a recipe that calls for 1.5 cups of icing sugar means using 90 grams instead. This attention to detail is key for successful air fryer baking, where even small errors can lead to uneven cooking or dry textures.</p>  

<h3>Common Uses for 1.5 Cups of Icing Sugar</h3>  
<p>This quantity is perfect for buttercream frostings, dusting desserts, or making glaze for <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cookies>air fryer cookies</a>. It’s also ideal for sweetening whipped cream or creating a smooth fondant. Since air fryers excel at quick, even baking, having the right measurements ensures your treats are flawless.</p>  

<h2>Tips for Storing Icing Sugar</h2>

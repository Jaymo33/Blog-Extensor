<p>3 cups of garlic paste equals approximately 24 ounces (or 680 grams). This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes, where precise measurements can make or break your dish. Whether you're making marinades, sauces, or rubs, knowing the exact weight ensures consistent results. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we focus on helping you get the most out of your air fryer with accurate measurements and delicious recipes.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of garlic paste can significantly impact the flavour and texture of your dish. Too much can overpower, while too little might leave your meal tasting bland. Air fryers cook food quickly, so balanced ingredients are key. For example, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>garlic-infused chicken recipe</a> relies on precise measurements for perfect results every time.</p>  

<p>Garlic paste is denser than liquids like water, so volume-to-weight conversions aren’t always straightforward. A standard UK cup holds 8 fluid ounces, but garlic paste weighs more due to its thickness. That’s why 3 cups of garlic paste translate to roughly 24 ounces, ensuring your recipes stay on track.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure Garlic Paste for Air Fryer Recipes</h3>  
<p>For the most accurate results, use a kitchen scale to weigh your garlic paste. If you don’t have one, spoon the paste into a measuring cup and level it off with a knife. Avoid packing it down, as this can lead to over-measuring. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a> can help with other common ingredient swaps.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for Garlic Paste in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Garlic paste is a versatile ingredient that works well in marinades, rubs, and sauces. Try it in our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>garlic butter chicken wings</a> or as a base for homemade garlic bread. The strong flavour means a little goes a long way, so stick to the recommended 3 cups (24 ounces) for larger batches.</p>  

<p>If you’re prepping meals in advance, garlic paste can save time. Mix it with olive oil and herbs for a quick marinade, or stir it into dips for extra punch. Just remember to store it properly—keep it in an airtight container in the fridge for up to two weeks.</p>  

<h3>Converting Other Garlic Measurements</h3>  
<p>If your recipe calls for minced garlic instead of paste, you’ll need to adjust the measurements. One clove of garlic equals about half a teaspoon of paste, so 3 cups would require roughly 288 cloves! Check our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a> for more details on swapping fresh garlic for paste.</p>  

<h2>Tips for Storing and Using Garlic Paste</h2>  
<p>To keep your garlic paste fresh, store it in a clean jar with a thin layer of oil on top. This prevents oxidation and preserves the flavour. If you notice any discolouration or off smells, it’s time to toss it. For more storage tips, visit our guide on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>keeping your air fryer ingredients fresh</a>.</p>  

<p>When using garlic paste in air fryer recipes, spread it evenly over meats or veggies for consistent flavour. Avoid clumping, as this can lead to uneven cooking. For best results, mix it with a bit of oil or yogurt to help it adhere better.</p>

<p>168°C in a fan oven equals approximately 150°C in a conventional oven. This 10-20°C reduction is standard when converting fan-assisted temperatures to traditional oven settings. Whether you're using an air fryer or conventional oven, understanding this conversion ensures perfectly cooked meals every time.</p>

<h2>Why Fan Oven Temperatures Differ</h2>
<p>Fan ovens circulate hot air evenly, cooking food faster and at lower temperatures than conventional ovens. The forced air movement means you'll typically reduce temperatures by 10-20°C when converting fan settings. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we recommend starting with a 15°C reduction for most recipes when switching from 168 fan oven to conventional cooking.</p>

<p>This principle applies equally to air fryers, which also use rapid air technology. Many air fryer recipes at <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> account for these temperature differences automatically. For chicken dishes, check our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipe category</a> for perfect conversions.</p>

<h3>How to Adjust Cooking Times</h3>
<p>When converting 168 fan oven to conventional oven settings, cooking times may increase by 5-10 minutes. The exact adjustment depends on your oven's efficiency and the food's density. Always check doneness a few minutes early when trying new conversions.</p>

<h2>Practical Conversion Examples</h2>
<p>Let's explore specific scenarios where you might need to convert 168 fan oven to conventional oven temperatures. For baking cakes at 168°C fan, reduce to 150°C conventional and extend baking time slightly. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>cake recipes</a> include both settings for convenience.</p>

<p>When roasting vegetables that normally cook at 168 fan oven, try 155°C in a conventional oven for similar results. The slight temperature bump accounts for slower heat penetration without fans. For frozen foods, visit our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/frozen-foods>frozen foods section</a> for conversion tips.</p>

<h3>Air Fryer Equivalent Temperatures</h3>
<p>Modern air fryers often display both fan and conventional oven settings. If your recipe calls for 168 fan oven, you can typically use the same temperature in an air fryer. However, cooking times will be shorter - usually by about 20% compared to conventional ovens.</p>

<h2>Common Conversion Mistakes</h2>
<p>Many home cooks forget that 168 fan oven to conventional oven conversion isn't just about temperature. You must also consider rack position - fan ovens cook more evenly, while conventional ovens have hot spots. Middle rack positions work best for most conversions.</p>

<p>Another frequent error is not accounting for preheating differences. Conventional ovens take longer to reach 150°C than fan ovens take to reach 168°C. Always allow extra preheating time when using conventional settings. For cleaning tips after cooking, see our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner guide</a>.</p>

<h3>Special Cases and Exceptions</h3>
<p>Some delicate baked goods like soufflés or meringues may require more precise temperature adjustments when converting 168 fan oven to conventional oven settings. In these cases, err on the side of lower temperatures and longer cooking times to prevent over-browning.</p>

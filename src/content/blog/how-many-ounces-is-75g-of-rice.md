<h2>Why Convert 75g of Rice to Ounces?</h2>  
<p>Converting 75g of rice to ounces (2.65 oz) is useful for following recipes, especially those from the US or UK. Many air fryer recipes list ingredients in ounces, so knowing this conversion avoids guesswork. It also helps with portion control, ensuring you don’t overcook or undercook your rice.

<p>Rice is a staple in many dishes, from stir-fries to puddings. Measuring 75g of rice (2.65 oz) ensures consistency, whether you're cooking for one or meal prepping. If you're new to air frying rice, start with smaller batches to perfect the texture. Visit our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipes section</a> for inspiration.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure 75g of Rice Accurately</h3>  
<p>To measure 75g of rice (2.65 oz), use a digital kitchen scale for precision. If you don’t have one, a standard measuring cup holds about 180g of uncooked rice, so 75g is roughly a third of a cup. Always fluff the rice before measuring to avoid compacting it.</p>  

<h2>Cooking 75g of Rice in an Air Fryer</h2>  
<p>Cooking 75g of rice (2.65 oz) in an air fryer is simple with the right technique. Rinse the rice first to remove excess starch, then add it to an oven-safe dish with water. For fluffy results, use a 1:1.5 ratio of rice to water. Preheat your air fryer to 180°C and cook for 12-15 minutes.</p>  

<p>Experiment with different rice types, like basmati or jasmine, for varied textures.

<h3>Common Mistakes When Measuring Rice</h3>  
<p>Avoid packing rice into measuring cups, as this leads to inaccurate portions. Always use the spoon-and-level method for dry rice. For 75g of rice (2.65 oz), weigh it directly if possible. Over-measuring can result in gummy, overcooked rice in the air fryer.</p>

<p>985 ml of oat milk is roughly 4.16 cups in the US measurement system and 3.46 cups in the UK. Whether you're whipping up a cake, preparing a creamy sauce, or experimenting with air fryer recipes, knowing this conversion ensures accuracy. Oat milk is a popular dairy-free alternative, and measuring it correctly can make or break your dish. For more air fryer-friendly recipes, check out <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>our recipe collection</a>.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of oat milk is crucial, especially in baking where precision affects texture and rise. Too much liquid can make cakes soggy, while too little may dry them out. Air fryer recipes, like those found on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, often rely on exact measurements for perfect results. Whether you're making pancakes, muffins, or a creamy pasta sauce, 985 ml of oat milk converts differently depending on your cup size.</p>  

<p>In the US, a standard cup holds 240 ml, while a UK cup is 284 ml. This means 985 ml of oat milk equals about 4.16 US cups or 3.46 UK cups. If you're using a kitchen scale, 985 ml weighs approximately 985 grams, as oat milk has a similar density to water. For more conversion tips, visit our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>  

<h3>US vs. UK Cup Measurements</h3>  
<p>The difference between US and UK cups can be confusing, but it's essential for accurate recipes. If a recipe calls for 985 ml of oat milk and you're using US cups, measure out just over 4 cups. For UK cups, use about 3 and a half cups. Always double-check the origin of your recipe to avoid mishaps.</p>  

<h2>Using Oat Milk in Air Fryer Recipes</h2>  
<p>Oat milk works wonderfully in air fryer recipes, from batters to sauces. Its mild, slightly sweet flavour complements both sweet and savoury dishes. If you're making air fryer pancakes or a dairy-free glaze, 985 ml of oat milk gives you enough for multiple servings. Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert recipes</a> for inspiration.</p>  

<p>When substituting oat milk for dairy in air fryer recipes, keep in mind it's thinner than whole milk. You may need to adjust other ingredients slightly.

<h3>Converting Other Measurements</h3>  
<p>If you need to scale a recipe up or down, remember that 985 ml of oat milk is just under a litre. For smaller batches, half of 985 ml is 492.5 ml (about 2.08 US cups or 1.73 UK cups). For larger quantities, double it to 1970 ml (8.32 US cups or 6.92 UK cups).</p>

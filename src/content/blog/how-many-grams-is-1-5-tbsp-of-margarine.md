<p>1.5 tablespoons (tbsp) of margarine equals approximately 21 grams in UK measurements. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precision ensures even cooking and perfect texture. Whether you're whipping up crispy roast potatoes or a batch of air-fried cookies, knowing the exact weight of margarine can make all the difference.</p>

<h2>Why accurate margarine measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Using the correct amount of margarine ensures your food cooks evenly and achieves the desired crispiness. Too little, and your dish might turn out dry; too much, and it could become greasy. For example, when making <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer roast potatoes</a>, 1.5 tbsp (21g) of margarine gives just enough richness without overpowering the natural flavours. Many recipes on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> rely on precise measurements for consistent results.</p>  

<p>Margarine behaves differently than butter in high-heat cooking, so getting the conversion right is crucial. Unlike butter, margarine has a higher water content, which affects how it browns and crisps in the air fryer. If you're converting a recipe that originally uses butter, always check the weight equivalents to avoid mishaps.</p>  

<h3>How to measure 1.5 tbsp of margarine without scales</h3>  
<p>If you donâ€™t have a digital scale, you can still measure 1.5 tbsp of margarine accurately. A standard UK tablespoon holds about 14 grams of margarine, so 1.5 tbsp would be roughly 21 grams. For sticky margarine, lightly grease your measuring spoon first to help it slide out cleanly. This trick works especially well for recipes like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cookies>air fryer cookies</a> where precise fat ratios affect texture.</p>  

<h2>Common air fryer recipes using 1.5 tbsp margarine</h2>  
<p>Many popular air fryer dishes call for around 1.5 tbsp (21g) of margarine. For instance, a single serving of air-fried vegetables often uses this amount to coat evenly without becoming soggy. Similarly, <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>air fryer chicken</a> recipes might include 1.5 tbsp of margarine mixed with herbs for a golden, crispy finish.</p>  

<p>When preparing frozen foods in the air fryer, a light brushing of margarine can revive texture. About 1.5 tbsp is perfect for coating a portion of <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/frozen-foods>frozen potato wedges</a> before cooking.

<h3>Margarine vs butter in air fryer conversions</h3>  
<p>While 1.5 tbsp of margarine equals 21 grams, butter weighs slightly more at about 22 grams for the same volume. This small difference matters in air fryer baking, where fat ratios affect rise and browning. Always adjust measurements if substituting one for the other in recipes from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>.</p>

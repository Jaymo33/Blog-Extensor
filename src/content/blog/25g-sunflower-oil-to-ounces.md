<p>25g of sunflower oil equals approximately 0.88 ounces. This conversion is essential for air fryer cooking, where precise measurements can make or break a recipe. Whether you’re whipping up crispy vegetables or baking a cake, knowing how to convert grams to ounces ensures consistent results every time.</p>  

<h2>Why Convert 25g of Sunflower Oil to Ounces?</h2>  
<p>Many air fryer recipes, especially those from the UK or US, use different measurement systems. While grams are common in metric-based recipes, ounces are often used in imperial measurements. Converting 25g of sunflower oil to ounces (0.88 oz) helps you follow recipes accurately, whether you’re using a digital scale or measuring cups.</p>  

<p>Sunflower oil is a popular choice for air frying due to its high smoke point and neutral flavour. If you’re exploring recipes on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, you’ll notice many dishes call for precise oil measurements. Getting this right ensures your food cooks evenly and doesn’t end up greasy or dry.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure 25g of Sunflower Oil</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a scale, you can use volume measurements. Roughly, 25g of sunflower oil is about 1.8 tablespoons or 5.4 teaspoons. However, for accuracy, a digital kitchen scale is best. This is particularly important for baking recipes where exact ratios matter.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for 25g of Sunflower Oil in Air Fryers</h2>  
<p>Sunflower oil is versatile in air fryer cooking. A 25g portion (0.88 oz) is perfect for coating potatoes for crispy fries or tossing vegetables before roasting. It’s also ideal for light frying or adding moisture to baked goods like air fryer cakes.</p>  

<p>For meal preppers, measuring 25g of sunflower oil ensures consistency across batches. Check out <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/potatoes>potato recipes</a> on our site for inspiration. Many dishes, like hasselback potatoes or roast potatoes, benefit from this precise oil measurement.</p>  

<h3>Converting Other Quantities of Sunflower Oil</h3>  
<p>If your recipe calls for more or less oil, you can scale the conversion. For example, 50g of sunflower oil equals roughly 1.76 ounces, while 10g is about 0.35 ounces. Keep our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a> handy for quick reference.</p>  

<h2>Tips for Using Sunflower Oil in Your Air Fryer</h2>  
<p>Sunflower oil works well in air fryers because it doesn’t break down at high temperatures. When using 25g (0.88 oz), spread it evenly over your ingredients for uniform crispiness. Avoid over-oiling, as this can lead to smoke or uneven cooking.</p>  

<p>For easy cleanup after using oil in your air fryer, check out our guide on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>keeping your air fryer spotless</a>. A well-maintained air fryer ensures better cooking performance and longevity.</p>  

<h3>Why Accuracy Matters in Air Fryer Cooking</h3>  
<p>Air fryers circulate hot air rapidly, so too much or too little oil can affect texture and taste. Measuring 25g of sunflower oil (0.88 oz) precisely helps achieve that perfect balance between crispiness and moisture. This is especially crucial for recipes like air-fried chicken or tofu.</p>

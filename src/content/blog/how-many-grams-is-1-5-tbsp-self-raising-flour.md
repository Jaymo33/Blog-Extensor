<h2>How many grams is 1.5 tbsp of self-raising flour?</h2>  
<p>1.5 tablespoons (tbsp) of self-raising flour equals approximately 12 grams. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes, where precision ensures even cooking and perfect texture. Whether you're whipping up cakes, bread, or batters, knowing the exact weight helps avoid dense or dry results. For more air fryer baking tips, check out <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>our recipe collection</a>. Always use a digital scale for the most accurate measurements, especially when adapting traditional oven recipes for your air fryer.</p>  

<p>Self-raising flour is a staple in British baking, containing added raising agents like baking powder. Its density can vary slightly depending on brand and how it's packed, but 1.5 tbsp reliably converts to 12 grams. If you're scaling up a recipe, remember that 3 tbsp would be 24 grams, and so on. For quick reference, bookmark <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>our air fryer conversion chart</a> to streamline your cooking process. This small measurement is often used in coating mixes or small-batch bakes perfect for air fryer portions.</p>  

<h3>Why accurate flour measurements matter in air fryers</h3>  
<p>Air fryers circulate hot air rapidly, so imbalanced ingredients can lead to uneven cooking or burnt edges. Too much flour in a batter might make it dense, while too little could cause spreading. That's why converting 1.5 tbsp of self-raising flour to grams (12g) gives you consistency. Many <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>air fryer cake recipes</a> rely on precise flour ratios for lift and crumb structure. A digital kitchen scale eliminates guesswork from tablespoon conversions, ensuring your bakes turn out light and fluffy every time.</p>  

<h2>Converting tablespoons to grams for UK baking</h2>  
<p>UK tablespoons hold 15ml, slightly more than the US standard (14.2ml), which affects weight conversions. For self-raising flour, 1 level UK tbsp is about 8 grams, making 1.5 tbsp equal to 12 grams. This differs from plain flour due to the added raising agents. When adapting recipes from cups or ounces, always use weight measurements for reliability. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> guides help navigate these nuances, especially for popular air fryer bakes like scones or muffins.</p>  

<p>To measure 1.5 tbsp without scales, spoon flour into the tablespoon and level it off with a knifeâ€”don't scoop directly from the bag, as this compacts the flour. For sticky batters or coatings, consider using <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer liners</a> to simplify cleanup. Remember that humidity can slightly alter flour's weight, so in very damp conditions, you might need to adjust by a gram or two. When doubling recipes, multiply the grams (not volume) for consistent results.</p>  

<h3>Common uses for 1.5 tbsp of self-raising flour</h3>  
<p>This small quantity often appears in recipes for single-serving air fryer cakes, thickening sauces, or creating light coatings for proteins. For example, 12 grams of self-raising flour could be mixed with spices for crispy chicken tenders. It's also handy for adjusting batter consistency in <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>air fryer desserts</a> like fritters or doughnuts. Because air fryers cook faster than conventional ovens, the exact flour amount ensures proper rise and browning without over-drying.</p>

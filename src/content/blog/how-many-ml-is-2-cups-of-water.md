<p>2.0 cups of water equals 473 ml. This conversion is essential for precise cooking, especially when using an air fryer where measurements can make or break a recipe. Whether you're baking, steaming, or preparing sauces, knowing the exact ml equivalent of 2.0 cups ensures consistency. For more handy conversions, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on precise ingredient ratios to achieve the perfect texture and flavour. Using 473 ml (2.0 cups) of water instead of eyeballing it can prevent soggy or unevenly cooked dishes. Many <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> require exact liquid measurements for marinades, batters, or steaming. A slight deviation can alter cooking times and results, so sticking to 473 ml ensures reliability.</p>  

<p>For example, when making air fryer steamed vegetables, 2.0 cups (473 ml) of water creates the ideal steam environment. Too little, and the veggies dry out; too much, and they become waterlogged. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable recipes</a> highlight the importance of precise measurements for best results.</p>  

<h3>US vs. UK Cup Measurements</h3>  
<p>While 2.0 US cups equal 473 ml, UK cups measure slightly different at 454 ml per 2.0 cups. Always check your recipe's origin to avoid confusion. Most modern air fryer recipes, including those on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, use US cup measurements unless specified otherwise.</p>  

<h2>How to Measure 2.0 Cups of Water Without a Measuring Cup</h2>  
<p>If you don’t have a measuring cup, use a standard 500 ml water bottle—fill it just below the brim for roughly 473 ml. Alternatively, 16 UK tablespoons equal 2.0 cups (473 ml). For baking, a kitchen scale set to grams (473 g for water) works too. Precision matters, especially in air fryer baking where ratios affect rise and texture.</p>  

<p>For cleaning your air fryer after measuring liquids, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning guide</a> ensures no residue affects future dishes. Sticky batters or marinades with 2.0 cups (473 ml) of liquid can leave behind stubborn marks if not cleaned properly.</p>  

<h3>Common Recipes Using 2.0 Cups (473 ml) of Water</h3>  
<p>Many air fryer staples, like steamed fish or poached chicken, call for 2.0 cups of water. For instance, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipes</a> often use this quantity for poaching. The 473 ml measurement ensures even cooking without drying out the meat.</p>

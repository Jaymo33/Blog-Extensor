<h2>Why accurate garlic measurements matter in air frying</h2>  
<p>Garlic is a powerhouse of flavour, but too much or too little can drastically alter your dish. In an air fryer, ingredients cook quickly, so balanced seasoning is key. Using 2.5 tbsp of crushed garlic (35g) ensures your recipes like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>garlic chicken</a> or roasted potatoes turn out perfectly. Overdoing it can lead to bitterness, while too little might leave your meal bland. Our guide helps you nail the measurement every time.</p>  

<p>Precision is especially important for batch cooking or meal prep. If you’re scaling up a recipe, converting tablespoons to grams guarantees consistency. For example, doubling a recipe would mean 70g of crushed garlic instead of guessing with tablespoons.

<h3>How to measure crushed garlic accurately</h3>  
<p>Crushed garlic can be tricky to measure because it clumps together. For the most accurate 2.5 tbsp (35g), lightly pack the garlic into the spoon without pressing too hard. If using pre-minced garlic from a jar, drain excess liquid first. Freshly crushed garlic tends to be denser, so adjust slightly if needed.

<h3>Converting other garlic measurements</h3>  
<p>If your recipe uses whole cloves instead of crushed garlic, one medium clove equals about 1 tsp (5g) when crushed. This means 2.5 tbsp (35g) is roughly 7 cloves. Minced garlic is slightly lighter, so 2.5 tbsp would be closer to 30g. Always check whether your recipe specifies fresh or pre-prepared garlic for the best results.</p>

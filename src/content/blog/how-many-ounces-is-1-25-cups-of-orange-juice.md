<p>1.25 cups of orange juice equals approximately 10 fluid ounces (fl oz). This conversion is essential for accurate measurements, especially when preparing recipes for your air fryer. Whether you're making a glaze, marinade, or a refreshing drink, knowing the exact weight ensures perfect results every time.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Precision is key when cooking with an air fryer, as even small variations can affect texture and cooking times. Converting 1.25 cups of orange juice to ounces (10 fl oz) helps maintain consistency. For example, a marinade with too much liquid might not adhere properly to your chicken or salmon, while too little could leave your dish dry.

<p>Many air fryer recipes, like glazed carrots or citrus-infused shrimp, rely on precise liquid measurements.

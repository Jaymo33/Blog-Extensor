<p>35 ml of maple syrup equals approximately 0.15 cups (or roughly 1/8 cup plus 1 tablespoon). This conversion is essential for precise baking and air frying, ensuring your recipes turn out perfectly every time. Whether you’re whipping up a glaze or sweetening a dessert, knowing how to measure maple syrup accurately is key. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we focus on making cooking conversions simple and stress-free.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Frying</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of maple syrup can make or break your air fryer recipes. Too much syrup can lead to overly sticky or burnt results, while too little might leave your dish lacking flavour. Precision is especially important when following recipes from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>our collection</a>, where balanced sweetness is crucial. Whether you’re making glazed salmon or maple-roasted vegetables, 35 ml of maple syrup should be measured carefully.</p>  

<p>Air fryers cook food quickly, so ingredients like maple syrup caramelise faster than in traditional ovens. This means even small measurement errors can have noticeable effects. If you’re converting 35 ml of maple syrup to cups for an air fryer recipe, always double-check your measurements.

<h3>How to Measure 35 ml of Maple Syrup Without a Scale</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a measuring jug with millilitre markings, you can still measure 35 ml of maple syrup accurately. One tablespoon holds about 15 ml, so 35 ml is roughly 2 tablespoons plus 1 teaspoon. Alternatively, use a standard 1/8 cup measure (30 ml) and add an extra teaspoon to reach 35 ml. This method ensures you get the right consistency for recipes like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>air fryer desserts</a>.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for 35 ml of Maple Syrup in Air Fryer Recipes</h2>  
<p>Maple syrup is a versatile ingredient in air fryer cooking. From glazes to marinades, 35 ml (or 0.15 cups) is a common quantity in many recipes. For example, a maple-glazed salmon fillet might call for 35 ml of syrup mixed with soy sauce and garlic. Similarly, roasted sweet potatoes or carrots benefit from a light drizzle of maple syrup before air frying.</p>  

<p>If you’re baking in your air fryer, 35 ml of maple syrup can sweeten muffins or cakes without overpowering other flavours. It’s also a great natural sweetener for granola or nut clusters.

<h3>Does Maple Syrup Thicken When Heated in an Air Fryer?</h3>  
<p>Yes, maple syrup thickens slightly when heated due to water evaporation. If you’re using 35 ml of maple syrup as a glaze, it will become stickier and more concentrated during cooking. To prevent burning, consider brushing it on halfway through the cooking time. For sticky bakes like cinnamon rolls, a light coating of 35 ml maple syrup adds moisture and sweetness.</p>  

<h2>Converting 35 ml of Maple Syrup for UK vs. US Recipes</h2>  
<p>While 35 ml of maple syrup equals roughly 0.15 cups in both UK and US measurements, slight differences exist in cup sizes. A UK cup is 284 ml, whereas a US cup is 240 ml. However, for small quantities like 35 ml, the difference is negligible. If you’re adapting a recipe from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, rest assured that our measurements work seamlessly for both regions.</p>  

<p>When scaling recipes, always convert all ingredients proportionally. For example, if a recipe calls for 70 ml of maple syrup, simply double the 35 ml measurement to 0.3 cups. Keeping conversions consistent ensures your air fryer dishes turn out as intended.

<p>30g of soy sauce is approximately 1.06 ounces. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes, where precise measurements can make or break a dish. Whether you're marinating chicken, glazing salmon, or whipping up a stir-fry, knowing how to convert grams to ounces ensures consistency. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we help you nail every recipe with accurate conversions and expert tips.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on even cooking, and incorrect measurements can throw off the balance of flavours or textures. For example, too much soy sauce can make a dish overly salty, while too little might leave it bland. Converting 30g of soy sauce to ounces (1.06 oz) helps you follow recipes precisely. This is especially important for marinades, where the liquid-to-solid ratio affects absorption. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more handy conversions.</p>  

<p>Many air fryer recipes, like teriyaki chicken or glazed tofu, call for soy sauce in small quantities. Measuring 30g of soy sauce correctly ensures your dish isn’t overpowering. If you’re experimenting with homemade sauces, precise measurements are key. For more recipe ideas, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipes section</a>, packed with air fryer-friendly meals.</p>  

<h3>How to measure 30g of soy sauce without scales</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a kitchen scale, you can still measure 30g of soy sauce using tablespoons. One tablespoon of soy sauce weighs roughly 15g, so two tablespoons will give you 30g (or 1.06 ounces). This method isn’t as precise as using scales but works in a pinch. For best results, invest in a digital scale—it’s a game-changer for air fryer cooking.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for 30g of soy sauce in air fryer recipes</h2>  
<p>30g of soy sauce is a versatile amount, perfect for marinades, glazes, and dipping sauces. For example, it’s ideal for marinating a couple of chicken breasts or a block of tofu before air frying. You’ll find this quantity in many Asian-inspired recipes, like honey-soy glazed salmon or garlic-soy shrimp. Visit our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipes</a> for delicious ideas.</p>  

<p>Another great use for 30g of soy sauce is in stir-fry sauces. Combine it with garlic, ginger, and a touch of honey for a quick glaze. The air fryer locks in these flavours, giving your dishes a restaurant-quality finish. For cleaning tips after cooking sticky sauces, check out our guide on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner</a>.</p>  

<h3>Converting other soy sauce quantities</h3>  
<p>If your recipe calls for more or less soy sauce, here’s a quick reference: 15g is about 0.53 ounces, and 60g is roughly 2.12 ounces. These conversions help you scale recipes up or down depending on your needs. Always measure liquids like soy sauce at eye level for accuracy.</p>  

<h2>Tips for working with soy sauce in the air fryer</h2>  
<p>Soy sauce can caramelise quickly in the air fryer, so watch cooking times closely. For marinades, let proteins sit for at least 30 minutes to absorb the flavours. If using soy sauce as a glaze, apply it in the last few minutes of cooking to prevent burning. For more air fryer tips, browse our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a>.</p>  

<p>Storing leftover soy sauce is easy—keep it in a sealed container in the fridge for up to six months. If you’re reducing sodium, opt for low-sodium soy sauce, but adjust measurements as it may taste milder. Experiment with different brands to find your favourite for air fryer dishes.</p>

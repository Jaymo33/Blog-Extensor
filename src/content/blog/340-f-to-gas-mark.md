<p>340°F converts to Gas Mark 3 in UK ovens and air fryers. This medium heat setting is ideal for baking cookies, roasting vegetables, or cooking poultry in your air fryer. Whether you're following a recipe from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> or adapting traditional oven instructions, knowing this conversion ensures perfect results.</p>

<h2>Understanding Gas Mark and Fahrenheit</h2>
<p>Gas Mark is a temperature scale used primarily in the UK, while Fahrenheit is common in the US and some appliance settings. When your air fryer displays 340 F, you'll need Gas Mark 3 for equivalent cooking in British recipes. This conversion works for most foods from our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cookies>cookie recipes</a> to main dishes. The moderate heat prevents burning while ensuring thorough cooking.</p>
<p>Many modern air fryers allow you to toggle between temperature scales, but manual conversion remains useful. At 340 F (Gas Mark 3), the air fryer circulates hot air efficiently for even browning. This temperature suits foods requiring gentle cooking without excessive crisping. For precise results, always preheat your air fryer when using 340 F to Gas Mark conversions.</p>

<h3>Why 340 F to Gas Mark Matters for Air Fryers</h3>
<p>Air fryers cook faster than conventional ovens, making accurate temperature crucial. At 340 F (Gas Mark 3), you achieve balanced cooking for delicate items like fish fillets or <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>sponge cakes</a>. This prevents the outside from overcooking before the interior sets. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a> helps adapt any recipe to your appliance.</p>

<h2>Common Foods Cooked at 340 F (Gas Mark 3)</h2>
<p>Several dishes benefit from this moderate temperature setting in air fryers. Cookies develop chewy centres with crisp edges at 340 F to Gas Mark 3. Roasted vegetables caramelise gently without drying out. Chicken thighs cook through evenly when using this conversion for 25-30 minutes. Even frozen foods like fish fingers crisp perfectly at this heat.</p>
<p>For best results at 340 F in your air fryer, shake or flip food halfway through cooking. This ensures all surfaces receive equal heat exposure. When converting from Gas Mark 3 to 340 F, reduce cooking times by 20% compared to oven recipes. The powerful air circulation means foods cook faster while maintaining moisture.</p>

<h3>Adjusting Cooking Times at 340 F</h3>
<p>Air fryers typically require shorter durations than conventional ovens at the same temperature. When using 340 F to Gas Mark 3 conversions, start checking food 5 minutes before the recipe suggests. For example, cookies needing 12 minutes in an oven might be done in 9 minutes. Our testing at <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> confirms these time adjustments work perfectly.</p>

<h2>Conversion Tips for Perfect Results</h2>
<p>When converting 340 F to Gas Mark 3 for air frying, consider your appliance's wattage. Higher-powered models may cook faster even at identical temperatures. For consistent results, use an oven thermometer to verify your air fryer's accuracy. This is especially helpful when trying new recipes from our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken collection</a>.</p>
<p>Remember that 340 F equals Gas Mark 3 across all cooking methods, but air fryers distribute heat differently. The concentrated hot air means you might need to adjust rack positions or batch sizes. When baking at this temperature, leave space between items for proper air circulation. This prevents steaming and ensures crisp textures where desired.</p>

<p>25g of treacle equals approximately 0.88 ounces. This conversion is essential for anyone using an air fryer, especially when following recipes that require precise measurements. Whether you're making sticky toffee pudding or a glaze for meats, knowing how to convert grams to ounces ensures your dish turns out perfectly.</p>

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on precise cooking times and temperatures to deliver crispy, evenly cooked food. Using the correct amount of ingredients, like treacle, ensures your recipes turn out as intended. Too much or too little can affect texture and flavour, so getting the conversion right is key.</p>  
<p>For example, if you're making a treacle-based marinade for chicken, 25g of treacle (0.88 ounces) will give you the perfect balance of sweetness. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> for more inspiration on how to use treacle in your cooking.</p>  

<h2>How to measure 25g of treacle without scales</h2>  
<p>If you don’t have a kitchen scale, you can still measure 25g of treacle using tablespoons. One tablespoon of treacle weighs roughly 20g, so 25g is just over one tablespoon. This method isn’t as precise as using scales, but it works in a pinch.</p>

<h3>Common uses for treacle in air fryer recipes</h3>  
<p>Treacle adds a rich, molasses-like flavour to both sweet and savoury dishes. It’s often used in cakes, marinades, and glazes. For instance, a 25g portion of treacle can be brushed onto salmon before air frying for a caramelised finish.</p>  

<h3>Storing treacle for future use</h3>  
<p>Treacle has a long shelf life, but it’s best stored in an airtight container to prevent it from drying out. If you’ve measured out 25g for a recipe, ensure the rest is sealed properly.

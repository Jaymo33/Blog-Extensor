<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of evaporated cream can affect the texture and taste of your dish. Air fryers cook food quickly, so even small measurement errors can lead to overcooking or uneven results. For example, too much evaporated cream in a sauce might make it too thick, while too little could leave it runny. Always measure ingredients like evaporated cream carefully to avoid mishaps.

<p>Evaporated cream is denser than regular milk, so volume-to-weight conversions are crucial. A standard cup of evaporated cream weighs about 8 ounces, meaning 3 cups would be 24 ounces. This is particularly useful when scaling recipes up or down for your air fryer.

Ginger paste adds a warm, spicy kick to dishes like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>air fryer chicken</a> or stir-fried vegetables.

<h3>How to Measure Ginger Paste Correctly</h3>  
<p>To measure 4 tbsp of ginger paste accurately, use a flat-edged knife to level off the spoon. Packed ginger paste may weigh slightly more, so 60 grams is a safe estimate. If your recipe calls for grated ginger instead, note that fresh ginger weighs less per tablespoon. Always check whether your recipe specifies paste or fresh ginger to avoid mistakes.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for Ginger Paste in Air Fryer Recipes</h2>  
<p>Ginger paste is a versatile ingredient that works well in marinades, sauces, and glazes. Try it in <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>air fryer vegetable dishes</a> for an extra zing. It pairs beautifully with garlic, soy sauce, and honey for a quick stir-fry. Many Asian-inspired air fryer recipes rely on ginger paste for authentic flavour.</p>

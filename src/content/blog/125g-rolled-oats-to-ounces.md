<p>Rolled oats are a staple in everything from porridge to granola, and their weight can vary slightly depending on how tightly they’re packed. Measuring by weight (grams or ounces) rather than volume (cups) guarantees accuracy. If you’re meal prepping or baking, this precision is key to replicating successful results.

This method eliminates packing inconsistencies and ensures your air fryer recipes, like oat cookies or crumbles, turn out perfectly every time.</p>

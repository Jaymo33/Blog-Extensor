<p>To reheat naan bread in an air fryer, set it to 160°C (320°F) and warm for 2-3 minutes. This method restores the bread’s soft interior while adding a light crisp to the exterior, mimicking fresh-from-the-oven quality. Whether you’ve got leftover garlic naan or plain, your air fryer can bring it back to life without drying it out.</p>

<h2>Why Use an Air Fryer to Reheat Naan Bread?</h2>
<p>Air fryers circulate hot air rapidly, making them ideal for reheating naan bread evenly without sogginess. Unlike microwaves that can leave bread rubbery, or ovens that take longer, air fryers deliver quick, consistent results. The controlled heat ensures the naan doesn’t dry out while crisping the surface slightly.

<p>Another advantage is versatility—whether your naan is refrigerated, room temperature, or even frozen, the air fryer adapts. Just adjust the time slightly: 3 minutes for room-temperature naan, 4 minutes if chilled, and 5-6 minutes straight from the freezer. Pair your reheated naan with <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>air-fried chicken</a> for a complete meal.</p>

<h2>Step-by-Step Guide to Reheating Naan</h2>
<h3>Preheating and Preparation</h3>
<p>Preheat your air fryer to 160°C (320°F) for 2 minutes to ensure even heating. Lightly spritz the naan with water or brush with ghee to prevent drying. For extra crispiness, skip the oil and place the naan directly in the basket.</p>

<h3>Timing and Temperature Tips</h3>
<p>Heat the naan for 2-3 minutes, checking halfway to avoid over-browning. Thicker naan may need an extra minute, while thinner varieties cook faster. If reheating multiple pieces, stagger them to allow airflow.

<h2>Common Mistakes to Avoid</h2>
<p>Overcrowding the basket leads to uneven heating—reheat one or two naans at most. Avoid high temperatures above 180°C, which can make the bread tough. Never skip preheating, as cold starts prolong cooking and risk sogginess. For cleaning sticky residues post-reheating, <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>use a specialised cleaner</a>.</p>
<p>Another pitfall is reheating naan with heavy toppings like cheese, which may drip and smoke. Remove toppings first or use a liner. Store leftover naan in an airtight container to maintain moisture before reheating. Pair it with <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>air-fried vegetables</a> for a balanced dish.</p>

<h2>Creative Ways to Serve Reheated Naan</h2>
<p>Turn reheated naan into mini pizzas by adding toppings post-air-frying. Brush with garlic butter and sprinkle herbs for a quick appetiser. Crumble stale naan into air-fryer croutons for salads.

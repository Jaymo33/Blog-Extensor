<p>0.25 cup of semolina equals approximately 1.5 ounces (oz) in UK measurements. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precision ensures the best texture and consistency. Whether you're making crispy coatings or light batters, knowing the exact weight of semolina helps achieve perfect results every time.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of semolina can make or break your air fryer dishes. Too little, and your coating might not crisp up properly. Too much, and the texture could become overly dense. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we emphasise precision to help you master air fryer cooking. Semolina, a coarse wheat flour, is often used for breading or adding crunch to recipes like air-fried chicken or fish.</p>  

<p>For example, if a recipe calls for 0.25 cup of semolina, measuring it as 1.5 oz ensures consistency. This is especially useful when scaling recipes up or down. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more handy measurement guides.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure Semolina Correctly</h3>  
<p>To measure 0.25 cup of semolina accurately, use a dry measuring cup and level it off with a straight edge. Avoid packing the semolina down, as this can lead to an incorrect weight. A kitchen scale is ideal for verifying the 1.5 oz measurement, especially for baking or coating recipes.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for Semolina in Air Fryer Recipes</h2>  
<p>Semolina adds a delightful crunch to air-fried foods. It’s perfect for coating chicken, fish, or even vegetables before air frying. You can also mix it into batters for a firmer texture. Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipes section</a> for inspiration on using semolina in your air fryer creations.</p>  

<p>Another great use is in air-fried desserts, like semolina cakes or puddings. The coarse texture helps create a crisp exterior while keeping the inside moist. For more dessert ideas, browse our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert category</a>.</p>  

<h3>Storing Semolina for Freshness</h3>  
<p>Keep semolina in an airtight container in a cool, dry place to maintain its quality. Proper storage ensures it stays fresh for all your air fryer recipes. If you notice any off smells or clumping, it’s time to replace it.</p>  

<h2>Converting Other Semolina Measurements</h2>  
<p>Need to convert different amounts of semolina? Here’s a quick reference: 1 cup of semolina equals roughly 6 oz, while 0.5 cup is about 3 oz. These conversions are handy when adjusting recipes. For more tips, visit <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>.</p>  

<p>If you’re working with grams, 0.25 cup (1.5 oz) of semolina is approximately 42 grams. This is useful for those using metric measurements. Always double-check conversions to ensure accuracy in your cooking.</p>

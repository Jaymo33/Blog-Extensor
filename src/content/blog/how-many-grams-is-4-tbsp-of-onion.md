<p>4 tablespoons (tbsp) of chopped onion weigh approximately 40 grams. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements ensure even cooking and perfect results. Whether you’re making crispy onion toppings or adding flavour to dishes, knowing the weight helps streamline your prep.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate onion measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Using the correct amount of onion ensures your air fryer dishes have balanced flavours and textures. Too much onion can overpower a dish, while too little might leave it bland. For recipes like air-fried onion rings or stir-fries, 4 tbsp (40g) is a common measurement. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more handy tips.</p>  

<p>Onions vary in density depending on how finely they’re chopped. A rough chop may weigh slightly less than finely diced onion, but 4 tbsp generally averages around 40g. For consistent results, use a kitchen scale if possible.

<h3>How to measure 4 tbsp of onion without a scale</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a scale, fill a tablespoon loosely with chopped onion and level it off. Repeat four times for an approximate 40g measure. For recipes requiring exact weights, like air-fried fritters or stuffed peppers, weighing is best.

<h2>Common recipes using 4 tbsp (40g) of onion</h2>  
<p>Many air fryer dishes call for this amount, such as savoury muffins, stuffed mushrooms, or homemade seasoning blends. Onions add depth to marinades and coatings, especially in <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> like kebabs or roasted veggies. Their natural sweetness caramelises beautifully in the air fryer.</p>  

<p>For meal preppers, pre-measuring 4 tbsp portions saves time. Try freezing chopped onions in 40g batches for quick use later. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/meal-prep>meal prep section</a> has great tips for efficient cooking. Remember, keeping your air fryer clean ensures even heat distribution—check our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning guide</a> for best practices.</p>  

<h3>Adjusting onion quantities for different dishes</h3>  
<p>Some recipes may need more or less onion depending on taste. Start with 4 tbsp (40g) and adjust as needed. For stronger flavours, red onions work well, while milder white onions suit subtle dishes. Experiment to find your perfect balance.</p>

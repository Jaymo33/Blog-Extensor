<p>1 tablespoon (tbsp) of water weighs exactly 15 grams. This measurement is consistent whether you're using a UK or metric tablespoon, making it easy to convert for recipes. Knowing this conversion is especially useful for air fryer cooking, where precision can affect texture and cooking times. If you're using an air fryer for baking or reheating, accurate water measurements ensure perfect results every time. For more handy conversions, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate water measurements matter</h2>  
<p>When using an air fryer, even small variations in liquid measurements can impact the outcome. Too much water might make food soggy, while too little can dry it out. For example, when making air-fried cakes or bread, the exact grams of water ensure the right dough consistency. Recipes like those found on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> rely on precise measurements for best results. Whether you're cooking vegetables or proteins, knowing 1 tbsp of water equals 15 grams helps maintain balance.</p>  

<p>Water weight is also crucial for rehydrating ingredients like dried mushrooms or beans in an air fryer. Adding the correct grams of water ensures even cooking and prevents over- or under-hydration. If you're meal prepping, this accuracy saves time and avoids waste. For more tips on perfecting air fryer meals, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable recipes</a>.</p>  

<h3>How to measure 1 tbsp of water accurately</h3>  
<p>For the most precise 1 tbsp water to grams conversion, use a digital kitchen scale. Simply place your measuring spoon on the scale, tare it to zero, then add water until it reads 15 grams. This method eliminates guesswork and ensures consistency. If you don’t have a scale, a standard UK tablespoon filled level to the brim will hold 15 grams of water. Avoid heaping or underfilling for best results.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for 1 tbsp water in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Many air fryer recipes call for small amounts of water to steam or moisten ingredients. For instance, adding 1 tbsp (15 grams) of water to the air fryer basket can help prevent drying when reheating leftovers. It’s also useful for creating steam to crisp up bread or pastries. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning guide</a> to keep your air fryer in top shape after cooking with water.</p>  

<p>Water is often used in marinades or sauces for air-fried proteins like chicken or tofu. Knowing the exact grams in 1 tbsp ensures your marinade isn’t too runny or thick. For example, a simple glaze might combine 1 tbsp (15g) water with honey and spices. Browse our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipes</a> for inspiration on using water in marinades.</p>  

<h3>Converting other liquids from tablespoons to grams</h3>  
<p>While 1 tbsp of water is 15 grams, other liquids like oil or syrup have different weights due to density. For example, 1 tbsp of olive oil weighs about 13.5 grams. Always check specific conversions for the liquid you’re using. This is especially important when adapting recipes for your air fryer, as ingredient ratios affect cooking times and textures.</p>

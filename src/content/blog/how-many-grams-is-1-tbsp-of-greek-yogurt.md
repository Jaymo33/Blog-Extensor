<p>1 tablespoon (tbsp) of greek yogurt weighs approximately 15 grams. This measurement is essential for precise cooking, especially when using an air fryer, where ingredient ratios can affect texture and cooking times. Whether you're making dips, marinades, or baked goods, knowing how many grams are in 1 tbsp of greek yogurt ensures your recipes turn out perfectly every time.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on even heat distribution, so ingredient proportions must be spot-on. Too much or too little greek yogurt can alter moisture levels, affecting crispiness or tenderness. For example, if you're making <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer chicken tenders</a>, the marinade's consistency depends on the correct yogurt-to-gram ratio. A digital kitchen scale is the best tool for accuracy, but if you don’t have one, our conversion guide will help.</p>  

<p>Greek yogurt is thicker than regular yogurt, so its weight per tablespoon differs slightly. While 1 tbsp of regular yogurt might weigh around 14 grams, greek yogurt’s denser texture means it’s closer to 15 grams. This small difference can add up in recipes like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>air fryer chicken wings</a>, where marinade thickness impacts flavour absorption.</p>  

<h3>Converting other yogurt measurements to grams</h3>  
<p>If your recipe calls for larger quantities, here’s a quick reference: 1/4 cup of greek yogurt equals about 60 grams, and 1/2 cup is roughly 120 grams. These conversions are handy for batch cooking or meal prepping with your air fryer. For more detailed conversions, check our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for greek yogurt in air fryer recipes</h2>  
<p>Greek yogurt isn’t just for breakfast—it’s a versatile ingredient in air fryer cooking. Use it as a base for marinades, like in <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/lamb>air fryer lamb kebabs</a>, or as a binding agent in baked goods. Its tangy flavour and creamy texture also make it ideal for dips and sauces. Just remember, 1 tbsp of greek yogurt to grams (15g) ensures consistency.</p>  

<p>Another great use is in healthier baking. Substitute butter or oil with greek yogurt in air fryer cakes or muffins. Since 1 tbsp of greek yogurt is 15 grams, you can easily adjust recipes for lower fat content without sacrificing moisture.

<h3>Tips for measuring without a scale</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a scale, use the spoon-and-level method for accuracy. Scoop the yogurt into the tablespoon and level it off with a knife. Avoid packing it down, as this can add extra grams. For sticky ingredients like greek yogurt, a non-stick measuring spoon helps. Remember, 1 tbsp greek yogurt to grams is roughly 15, but slight variations can occur based on brand or thickness.</p>  

<h2>How temperature affects greek yogurt measurements</h2>  
<p>Cold greek yogurt is denser, so 1 tbsp might weigh slightly more than room-temperature yogurt. If precision is crucial, like in <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>air fryer desserts</a>, let the yogurt sit for 10 minutes before measuring. This ensures consistency, especially when converting 1 tbsp of greek yogurt into grams for baking.</p>  

<p>In savoury dishes, like marinating meats, small weight differences matter less. But for recipes requiring exact ratios, such as air fryer bread or pancakes, stick to the 15-gram rule per tablespoon. Always check your yogurt’s brand specifics, as some varieties may be thicker or thinner.</p>

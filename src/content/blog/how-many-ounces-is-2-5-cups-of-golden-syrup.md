Use a 1:1 ratio, but you may want to reduce the amount slightly to avoid overpowering the dish. Honey also browns faster in the air fryer, so adjust cooking times accordingly."

Avoid abrasive cleaners, as they can damage the non-stick coating. For stubborn spots, a mixture of baking soda and water can help."

<p>2.5 cups of golden syrup equals approximately 20 ounces. This conversion is essential for precise baking and cooking, especially when using an air fryer. Golden syrup, a staple in British baking, requires accurate measurements to ensure your recipes turn out perfectly. Whether you're making flapjacks or sticky toffee pudding, knowing how many ounces are in 2.5 cups of golden syrup can make all the difference.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter</h2>
<p>Golden syrup is a thick, sticky sweetener that can vary in weight depending on how it's measured. Using the correct amount ensures your recipes have the right consistency and sweetness. For air fryer recipes, precise measurements are even more critical, as the cooking process is faster and more intense. Too much syrup can lead to overly sweet or soggy results, while too little might leave your dish lacking in flavour.</p>
<p>At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we emphasise the importance of accurate conversions. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> can help you switch between cups, ounces, and grams effortlessly. This is particularly useful when adapting traditional recipes for air fryer cooking, where precision is key.</p>

<h2>How to Measure Golden Syrup</h2>
<p>Measuring golden syrup can be tricky due to its sticky nature. To get an accurate 2.5 cups, lightly grease your measuring cup with oil or butter to help the syrup slide out easily. This method ensures you don’t leave excess syrup stuck to the cup, which could throw off your measurements. For best results, use a kitchen scale to weigh the syrup directly in ounces or grams.</p>
<p>If you're working with an air fryer, consider using a syringe or squeeze bottle for smaller quantities. This is especially handy for recipes like glazes or marinades, where precision is crucial. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipes section</a> for more tips on measuring sticky ingredients.</p>

<h3>Converting Cups to Ounces</h3>
<p>One cup of golden syrup typically weighs around 8 ounces, so 2.5 cups would be 20 ounces. However, this can vary slightly depending on the syrup's temperature and density. For the most accurate conversion, always weigh your ingredients. A digital kitchen scale is a worthwhile investment for any home baker or air fryer enthusiast.</p>

<h3>Common Uses for Golden Syrup in Air Fryers</h3>
<p>Golden syrup is a versatile ingredient in air fryer cooking. It’s perfect for glazing meats, sweetening desserts, or adding a sticky finish to pastries. Popular recipes include air-fried sticky chicken wings or syrup-drizzled doughnuts.

<h2>Tips for Storing Golden Syrup</h2>
<p>Golden syrup should be stored in a cool, dry place to maintain its quality. Once opened, keep it tightly sealed to prevent crystallization. If your syrup hardens, gently warm it in a water bath to restore its smooth consistency. Proper storage ensures your syrup is always ready for your next air fryer adventure.</p>

<p>25g of golden syrup equals approximately 0.88 ounces. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precision matters. Golden syrup, a staple in British baking, adds a rich sweetness to dishes like flapjacks or glazes. Whether you're using an air fryer for desserts or savoury meals, knowing this measurement ensures perfect results every time.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on precise ingredient ratios for even cooking and perfect texture. Too much golden syrup can make dishes overly sticky, while too little might leave them dry. For recipes like air fryer cookies or glazed meats, 25g of golden syrup (0.88 oz) is often the ideal amount. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for other common measurements.</p>  

<p>Golden syrup's thick consistency means weighing it is more reliable than volume measurements. A digital kitchen scale ensures you get exactly 25g every time. This is especially useful when adapting traditional oven recipes for your air fryer. Visit <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> for more tips on converting recipes.</p>  

<h3>How to measure 25g of golden syrup without scales</h3>  
<p>If you don't have scales, two level tablespoons of golden syrup will roughly equal 25g (0.88 oz). Lightly grease your spoon first to help the syrup slide off easily. For sticky ingredients like this, we recommend using our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner</a> to maintain your appliance.</p>  

<h2>Using golden syrup in air fryer recipes</h2>  
<p>Golden syrup works wonderfully in air fryer desserts like sticky toffee pudding or gingerbread. The 25g measurement (0.88 oz) is perfect for glazing roasted vegetables or adding sweetness to marinades. Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a> for inspiration using this versatile ingredient.</p>  

<p>When substituting golden syrup in American recipes calling for corn syrup, remember 25g equals about 0.88 oz. The flavour profile differs slightly, but both work well in air fryer baking. For more dessert ideas, browse our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>cake recipes</a> section.</p>  

<h3>Storing golden syrup for air fryer use</h3>  
<p>Keep your golden syrup in an airtight container at room temperature. If it crystallises, gently warm the jar in hot water before measuring out your 25g (0.88 oz) portion. This ensures easy pouring and accurate measurements for all your air fryer creations.</p>

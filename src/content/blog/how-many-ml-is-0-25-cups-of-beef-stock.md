<p>Beef stock adds depth to dishes like air-fried stews, casseroles, or even marinades.

Many air fryer recipes, especially those from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>our collection</a>, rely on accurate liquid measurements for perfect results.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure 0.25 Cups of Beef Stock Without a Measuring Cup</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a measuring cup handy, you can use a standard metric measuring jug to measure 59 ml of beef stock.

For sticky or thick beef stock, lightly grease the spoon or cup for easier pouring and cleaning—a tip we often share in our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning guides</a>.</p>

<p>Some recipes may call for reduced beef stock, where 0.25 cups (59 ml) simmers down to a more concentrated flavour. In an air fryer, reducing liquids isn’t always practical, so pre-measuring ensures you get the right intensity. Always taste and adjust seasonings after adding beef stock, as brands vary in saltiness.</p>  

<h3>Does the Type of Beef Stock Affect the Measurement?</h3>  
<p>Homemade, store-bought, or powdered beef stock all measure the same—0.25 cups equals 59 ml. However, thicker or gelatinous stocks may require stirring before measuring for accuracy. If using powdered stock, dissolve it fully in water first, then measure out 0.25 cups (59 ml) for consistent results in your air fryer dishes.</p>

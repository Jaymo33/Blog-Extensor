<p>1.75 cups of evaporated milk equals approximately 14 fluid ounces (or 14.8 oz by weight). This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements matter. Whether you’re making a creamy dessert or a savoury dish, knowing how to convert cups to ounces ensures your recipe turns out perfectly every time.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of evaporated milk can make or break your air fryer recipe. Too little, and your dish might turn out dry; too much, and it could become soggy. Evaporated milk is thicker than regular milk, so measuring it correctly is crucial. For more air fryer tips, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>  

<p>Many air fryer recipes, especially desserts like custards or cakes, rely on evaporated milk for richness. If you’re working with a UK recipe, note that fluid ounces and weight ounces differ slightly. Always double-check whether your recipe calls for fluid ounces (volume) or ounces by weight.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure Evaporated Milk Correctly</h3>  
<p>To measure 1.75 cups of evaporated milk accurately, use a liquid measuring cup with clear markings. Fill it to the 1.75-cup line, or measure 14 fluid ounces directly. If your recipe requires weight, 1.75 cups of evaporated milk weighs roughly 14.8 ounces. For more recipe ideas, visit our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipes section</a>.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for Evaporated Milk in Air Fryer Recipes</h2>

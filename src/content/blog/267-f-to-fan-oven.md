<p>267°F converts to approximately 130°C in a fan oven. This temperature is ideal for slow roasting, baking delicate pastries, or reheating dishes without drying them out. When using an air fryer, which operates similarly to a fan oven, this conversion ensures your food cooks evenly and efficiently. For more precise adjustments, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>

<h2>Why Convert 267°F to Fan Oven?</h2>
<p>Fan ovens circulate hot air, reducing cooking times and ensuring even heat distribution. Converting 267°F to fan oven settings (130°C) helps maintain consistency, especially when adapting recipes for air fryers. Many air fryer users find this temperature perfect for dishes like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken wings</a> or roasted vegetables. It’s also a safe setting for reheating leftovers without overcooking.</p>
<p>Understanding this conversion is crucial because air fryers work like mini convection ovens. If a recipe calls for 267°F, setting your air fryer to 130°C will yield similar results. For more recipe ideas, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a>.</p>

<h2>How to Adjust Cooking Times</h2>
<p>When using 267°F (130°C) in a fan oven or air fryer, cooking times may shorten by 10-20%. For example, a dish that takes 40 minutes in a conventional oven might only need 30-35 minutes in an air fryer. Always check food a few minutes early to avoid overcooking.</p>
<p>This adjustment is particularly useful for baked goods like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cookies>cookies</a>, where precise temperatures matter. If you’re new to air frying, start with shorter times and increase as needed. Keep in mind that air fryers heat up faster than traditional ovens, so preheating isn’t always necessary.</p>

<h3>Tips for Perfect Results</h3>
<p>To get the best results at 267°F (130°C) in your air fryer, shake the basket halfway through cooking. This ensures even browning and prevents hotspots. For crispy foods like fries or <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/potatoes>roast potatoes</a>, lightly spray with oil before cooking.</p>

<h2>Common Uses for 267°F in Air Fryers</h2>
<p>This temperature is versatile, perfect for dehydrating fruits, slow-cooking meats, or keeping dishes warm. It’s also great for proofing dough or melting cheese without burning. Many users find it ideal for reheating pizza or frying delicate foods like tofu.</p>
<p>If you’re cooking frozen foods, 267°F (130°C) can help thaw them evenly before crisping at a higher temperature. For more tips on cleaning your air fryer after use, visit our guide on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer maintenance</a>.</p>

<h3>Safety Considerations</h3>
<p>Always ensure your air fryer is placed on a heat-resistant surface when operating at 267°F (130°C). Avoid overcrowding the basket, as this can block airflow and lead to uneven cooking. Check food regularly, especially when trying new recipes.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Blueberry Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Precision is key when baking or air frying, especially with ingredients like blueberries. Too many or too few can alter texture and flavour. For example, 2.75 cups of blueberries in grams ensures even distribution in muffins or crisps. If you're using frozen blueberries, the weight remains roughly the same, but thawing may affect volume.

Whether making blueberry pancakes or a fruit crumble, 330 grams of blueberries ensures balanced sweetness and moisture. Always measure blueberries after washing and draining them to avoid excess water weight.</p>  

<h3>UK vs US Cup Measurements for Blueberries</h3>  
<p>While 2.75 cups of blueberries in grams is roughly 330 grams globally, slight variations exist between UK and US cup sizes. A US cup holds 240ml, whereas a UK cup is 250ml. For most recipes, this difference is negligible, but for precision baking, weighing in grams is best.

<h3>Tips for Measuring Blueberries Without a Scale</h3>  
<p>No kitchen scale? Use the displacement method: fill a liquid measuring cup with water, add blueberries until the water rises to the 2.75-cup mark, then drain. This approximates 330 grams. Alternatively, standard supermarket punnets often hold 150g, so two punnets plus half another will get you close.

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on precise ingredient ratios to deliver crispy, evenly cooked results. Too much or too little peanut butter can alter the texture of your dish. For example, adding extra peanut butter to energy balls might make them overly dense. On the other hand, skimping on it in a satay sauce could leave it too runny. That’s why converting 2 tbsp of peanut butter to grams (32g) is so useful.</p>  
<p>If you’re meal prepping or scaling recipes, grams provide a more reliable measurement than volume. A digital kitchen scale is a must-have tool for air fryer enthusiasts.

<h3>Using grams vs. tablespoons</h3>  
<p>Grams are more consistent than tablespoons because peanut butter’s density can vary based on brand or natural separation. For UK cooks, 2 tbsp of peanut butter equals 32 grams, regardless of whether it’s smooth or crunchy. This standardisation is especially helpful when adapting American recipes, which often use volume measurements.</p>

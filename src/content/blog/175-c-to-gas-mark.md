The concentrated heat circulation in air fryers cooks food faster than conventional ovens at the same temperature setting.</p><h3 id="">Why 175 C to Gas Mark Matters for Baking</h3><p id="">Precision matters when baking, as even small temperature variations can affect texture and rise. The gas mark equivalent of 175 c creates the ideal environment for many chemical reactions in baking. Proteins set, starches gelatinize, and sugars caramelize at this moderate heat level. For perfect <a href="https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes" id="">cakes</a> and cookies, maintaining this temperature ensures even cooking without drying out your treats.</p><h2 id="">Using 175 C to Gas Mark in Your Air Fryer</h2><p id="">Modern air fryers often display temperatures in celsius, making the 175 c to gas mark uk conversion straightforward. However, some older models or specific recipes might reference Gas Mark 4 instead.

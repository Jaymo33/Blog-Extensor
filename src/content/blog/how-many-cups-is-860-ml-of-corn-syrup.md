<p>860 ml of corn syrup is approximately 3.63 cups in the UK or 3.6 cups in the US. Whether you're baking a sticky toffee pudding or glazing air-fried chicken wings, accurate measurements matter. Corn syrup is a common ingredient in many recipes, and knowing how to convert millilitres to cups ensures your dish turns out perfectly every time. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we understand the importance of precise conversions, especially when using an air fryer for consistent results.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of corn syrup can make or break a recipe. Too little, and your glaze might lack sweetness; too much, and your dish could become overly sticky. Air fryers, like those used for <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipes</a> on our site, rely on balanced ingredients for even cooking. Corn syrup is often used in marinades, glazes, and desserts, so knowing how to measure it correctly is essential. A slight variation can affect texture and taste, which is why conversions like 860 ml to cups are so useful.</p>  

<p>For those who love baking, precise measurements are even more critical. Corn syrup helps keep cakes moist and prevents sugar crystallisation in candies. If you're working with an air fryer, ensuring the right consistency of your mixture means better browning and crispiness.

<h2>UK vs. US Cup Measurements</h2>  
<p>Did you know that a UK cup and a US cup aren’t the same? A UK cup holds 250 ml, while a US cup is slightly smaller at 240 ml. This means 860 ml of corn syrup equals 3.63 UK cups or 3.6 US cups. The difference might seem small, but in baking or air frying, even a slight variation can impact your dish. If you're following a recipe from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert recipes</a>, always check whether it uses UK or US measurements.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure Corn Syrup Without a Measuring Cup</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a measuring cup handy, you can still measure 860 ml of corn syrup using a kitchen scale. Corn syrup weighs roughly 1.4 grams per millilitre, so 860 ml would be about 1,204 grams. Alternatively, use a tablespoon (15 ml) to measure out roughly 57 tablespoons, though this method is less precise. For best results, invest in a good set of measuring tools, especially if you frequently use your air fryer for recipes requiring exact quantities.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for 860 ml of Corn Syrup</h2>  
<p>Corn syrup is a versatile ingredient in both baking and air frying. You might use 860 ml for a large batch of pecan pie, a glaze for air-fried ham, or homemade caramel sauce. It’s also great for keeping <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>cakes</a> moist and chewy cookies soft. Because of its high sugar content, corn syrup helps achieve that perfect golden-brown finish in an air fryer, making it a favourite for many home cooks.</p>  

<p>Cleaning up after using corn syrup can be tricky, but our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner</a> guide makes it easier.

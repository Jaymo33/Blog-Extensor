<p>335 ml of yogurt equals approximately 1.42 cups in the US measurement system and 1.18 cups in the UK system. Whether you're following a recipe or adjusting measurements for your air fryer, knowing this conversion ensures accuracy. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we understand how precise measurements can make or break a dish, especially when using an air fryer.</p>  

<h2>Understanding the Conversion</h2>  
<p>Converting 335 ml of yogurt to cups depends on which cup measurement you're usingâ€”US or UK. The US cup holds 240 ml, while the UK cup is slightly larger at 284 ml. For 335 ml, this means roughly 1.42 US cups or 1.18 UK cups. This distinction is crucial for recipes, particularly when baking or making air fryer desserts like cakes or yogurt-based dips.</p>  

<p>If you're working with an air fryer, precise measurements ensure even cooking and perfect texture. For example, a <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>yogurt-based dessert</a> requires the right consistency, so measuring correctly avoids soggy or dry results. Always check whether your recipe uses UK or US measurements to avoid mistakes.</p>  

<h3>Why Accuracy Matters in Air Fryer Cooking</h3>  
<p>Air fryers rely on circulating hot air, so ingredient ratios impact cooking times and outcomes. Too much yogurt in a batter can make it dense, while too little may dry it out.

<h2>Common Mistakes When Measuring Yogurt</h2>

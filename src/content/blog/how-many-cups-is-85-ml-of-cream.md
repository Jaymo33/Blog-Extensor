<p>85 ml of cream is approximately 0.36 cups in the UK and 0.35 cups in the US. This conversion is essential for precise baking and cooking, especially when using an air fryer where measurements can make or break a recipe. Whether you're making a creamy sauce or a decadent dessert, knowing how to convert 85 ml of cream to cups ensures consistency and perfect results every time.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>
<p>When using an air fryer, precise measurements are crucial because the cooking process is faster and more intense than traditional methods. Too much or too little cream can affect texture, moisture, and even cooking times. For example, adding 85 ml of cream instead of the correct cup measurement could make a sauce too runny or a cake too dense. That’s why understanding conversions like 85 ml of cream to cups is so important.</p>
<p>At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we emphasise the importance of accurate measurements for air fryer recipes. Whether you're making a creamy pasta dish or a fluffy dessert, getting the right amount of cream ensures your dish turns out perfectly.

<h2>How to Measure 85 ml of Cream Without a Measuring Cup</h2>
<p>If you don’t have a measuring cup handy, you can still measure 85 ml of cream using everyday kitchen tools. A standard tablespoon holds about 15 ml, so 85 ml is roughly 5.5 tablespoons. Alternatively, a small juice glass or teacup often holds around 100 ml, so filling it just under the brim will give you close to 85 ml.</p>
<p>For those who prefer visual cues, 85 ml of cream is slightly less than half a US cup or just over a third of a UK cup. This method is handy when you're in a pinch and need to eyeball measurements. For more precise recipes, especially in air fryer cooking, we recommend using a digital scale or measuring jug.</p>

<h3>UK vs. US Cup Measurements for 85 ml of Cream</h3>
<p>It’s worth noting that UK and US cup measurements differ slightly. In the UK, 1 cup is 284 ml, while in the US, it’s 240 ml. This means 85 ml of cream converts to about 0.36 cups in the UK and 0.35 cups in the US. While the difference is small, it can add up in recipes requiring larger quantities.</p>

<h2>Common Recipes Using 85 ml of Cream</h2>
<p>85 ml of cream is a common measurement in many recipes, from sauces to desserts. For example, a creamy mushroom sauce for air-fried chicken might call for 85 ml of cream to achieve the perfect consistency. Similarly, a small batch of chocolate mousse or a single-serving cheesecake might use this amount.</p>

<h3>Tips for Storing Leftover Cream</h3>

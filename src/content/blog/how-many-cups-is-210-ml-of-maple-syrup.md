<p>210 ml of maple syrup is approximately 0.89 cups. This conversion is essential for baking and cooking, especially when using an air fryer where precise measurements can affect texture and taste. Whether you're making glazes, desserts, or marinades, knowing how to convert millilitres to cups ensures consistency in your recipes.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of maple syrup can make or break a recipe. Too much can make dishes overly sweet or sticky, while too little might leave them lacking flavour. Air fryer recipes, in particular, rely on precise measurements to ensure even cooking and perfect results. For more conversion tips, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>  

<p>Maple syrup is thicker than water, so volume conversions aren’t always straightforward. A standard cup holds 240 ml, but due to its viscosity, 210 ml of maple syrup fills slightly less. This small difference matters in baking, where exact ratios are crucial for success.</p>  

<h2>How to Measure 210 ml of Maple Syrup</h2>  
<p>For the most accurate measurement, use a liquid measuring cup with clear millilitre markings. Pour the syrup slowly to avoid air bubbles, and check at eye level. If you don’t have a measuring cup, a kitchen scale can help—210 ml of maple syrup weighs about 280 grams.</p>  

<h3>Using an Air Fryer with Maple Syrup</h3>  
<p>Maple syrup is a popular ingredient in air fryer recipes, from glazed salmon to sticky desserts. Since air fryers cook faster than conventional ovens, precise measurements prevent burning or uneven caramelisation. Explore delicious <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>maple syrup recipes</a> on our site for inspiration.</p>  

<h2>Common Conversions for Maple Syrup</h2>  
<p>Beyond 210 ml, here are other handy conversions: 100 ml is roughly 0.42 cups, and 250 ml equals about 1.06 cups. These measurements are useful when scaling recipes up or down. For more baking conversions, visit <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>.</p>  

<p>Remember, UK and US cup sizes differ slightly. A UK cup is 284 ml, while a US cup is 240 ml. Most recipes on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>our site</a> use the US standard unless noted. Always double-check which measurement system your recipe follows.</p>  

<h3>Cleaning Sticky Maple Syrup Residue</h3>  
<p>Maple syrup can leave a sticky mess in your air fryer basket. To clean it easily, soak the basket in warm, soapy water or use a specialised <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner</a>. Avoid abrasive scrubbers to prevent damaging non-stick coatings.</p>

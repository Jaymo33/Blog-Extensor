<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>
<p>Air fryers rely on even heat distribution, so ingredient quantities must be spot-on. Too much soft cheese can lead to soggy results, while too little might leave your dish dry. Measuring by weight (grams) is more accurate than volume (tablespoons) because density varies. For perfect <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a>, always use a digital scale when possible.</p>
<p>Soft cheese, like cream cheese or ricotta, can differ slightly in density. Brands and moisture content affect how much fits into a tablespoon. That’s why 5 tbsp of soft cheese to grams is best measured at 70g for reliability. If you’re adapting a recipe from cups or tablespoons, grams eliminate guesswork.</p>

<h2>How to measure 5 tbsp of soft cheese without scales</h2>
<p>If you don’t have scales, use the spoon-and-level method for soft cheese. Scoop the cheese into a tablespoon and level it off with a knife for consistency. Five level tablespoons should give you roughly 70g, but slight variations are normal. For sticky cheeses, lightly grease the spoon first to help release the cheese cleanly.</p>

<h3>Common soft cheese types and their weights</h3>
<p>Not all soft cheeses weigh the same per tablespoon. Cream cheese is denser than ricotta, so 5 tbsp might be closer to 75g. For lighter cheeses like mascarpone, 5 tbsp could be around 65g. Always check your recipe for specific cheese types, especially in baked <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>desserts</a> where texture matters.</p>

<h2>Converting other soft cheese amounts to grams</h2>
<p>Need to convert different quantities? Here’s a quick guide: 1 tbsp of soft cheese equals about 14g, and 100g is roughly 7 tbsp. For larger batches, 250g of soft cheese is around 18 tbsp.

<p>If you’re scaling a recipe up or down, grams make it easier to adjust portions accurately. For example, halving a recipe that calls for 5 tbsp (70g) of soft cheese? Use 35g instead. This precision is why professional chefs prefer weight measurements for consistent results.</p>

<h3>Tips for using soft cheese in air fryer recipes</h3>
<p>Soft cheese can melt quickly in the air fryer, so add it in layers or towards the end of cooking. For stuffed dishes, ensure the cheese is evenly distributed to avoid leaks. Chill the cheese slightly before measuring if it’s too soft to handle. These small tweaks elevate dishes like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>stuffed chicken</a> or cheesy potatoes.</p>

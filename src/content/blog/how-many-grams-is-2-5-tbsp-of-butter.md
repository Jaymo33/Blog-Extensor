<h2>Why Accurate Butter Measurements Matter in Air Fryers</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on precise ingredient ratios to achieve crispy, evenly cooked dishes. Too much butter can lead to soggy results, while too little might dry out your food.

<p>Butter measurements can vary slightly depending on its temperature and density. Softened butter packs differently into a tablespoon compared to cold butter, but 2.5 tbsp will still hover around 35g. If you're preparing a dish like garlic butter shrimp or buttery roasted potatoes, this conversion is a game-changer.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure 2.5 Tbsp of Butter Without Scales</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a kitchen scale, use the markings on a standard UK butter block. One tablespoon is roughly 14g, so 2.5 tbsp equals about 35g. Most UK butter packs have tablespoon indicators on the wrapper, making it easy to slice the right amount.

<p>2.5 tablespoons (tbsp) of butter equals approximately 35 grams (g) in UK measurements. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precision matters. Whether you're baking, frying, or making sauces, knowing the exact weight ensures perfect results every time. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we help simplify cooking conversions so you can focus on creating delicious meals.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Butter Measurements Matter in Air Fryers</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on precise ingredient ratios to achieve crispy, evenly cooked dishes. Too much butter can lead to soggy results, while too little might dry out your food. Converting 2.5 tbsp of butter to grams (35g) ensures consistency, especially in recipes like air-fried pastries or buttery vegetables. For more handy conversions, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>  

<p>Butter measurements can vary slightly depending on its temperature and density. Softened butter packs differently into a tablespoon compared to cold butter, but 2.5 tbsp will still hover around 35g. If you're preparing a dish like garlic butter shrimp or buttery roasted potatoes, this conversion is a game-changer.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure 2.5 Tbsp of Butter Without Scales</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a kitchen scale, use the markings on a standard UK butter block. One tablespoon is roughly 14g, so 2.5 tbsp equals about 35g. Most UK butter packs have tablespoon indicators on the wrapper, making it easy to slice the right amount. For more tips, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> section.</p>  

<h2>Common Recipes Using 2.5 Tbsp of Butter</h2>  
<p>Many air fryer dishes call for 2.5 tbsp of butter, such as buttery garlic bread, crispy Brussels sprouts, or flaky pastries. Knowing the gram equivalent (35g) helps adjust recipes for smaller or larger batches. Visit our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetables category</a> for inspiration on using butter in air-fried veggie dishes.</p>  

<p>For desserts like air-fryer cookies or cakes, 2.5 tbsp of butter (35g) ensures the right texture and richness. Too much butter can make cookies spread too thin, while too little may leave them dry. Precision is key, and our conversions take the guesswork out of baking.</p>  

<h3>Butter Substitutes for Air Fryer Cooking</h3>  
<p>If you’re out of butter, you can substitute 2.5 tbsp (35g) with margarine, coconut oil, or olive oil in most recipes. Each substitute behaves slightly differently in an air fryer, so adjust cooking times as needed.

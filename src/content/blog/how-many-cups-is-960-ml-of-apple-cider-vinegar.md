<p>960 ml of apple cider vinegar equals approximately 4.06 cups. This conversion is essential for recipes, especially when using an air fryer, where precise measurements can impact cooking results. Whether you're making marinades, dressings, or baking, knowing how to convert millilitres to cups ensures consistency. For more air fryer conversions, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of apple cider vinegar can make or break a recipe. Too much can overpower flavours, while too little might not deliver the desired tang. In air fryer cooking, liquids like vinegar help tenderise meats or add zest to vegetables. For example, a 960 ml measurement is common in large-batch recipes, like pulled pork or pickled veggies. Visit <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>our recipe collection</a> for inspiration.</p>  

<p>Apple cider vinegar is also a popular ingredient in healthy air fryer dishes, such as sugar-free glazes or detox dressings. If you're experimenting with new recipes, precise conversions ensure repeatable success. A slight miscalculation could alter texture or taste, so always measure carefully. For more tips on air fryer cooking, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipes</a>.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure 960 ml of Apple Cider Vinegar</h3>  
<p>To measure 960 ml of apple cider vinegar accurately, use a liquid measuring cup with clear millilitre markings. If your cup only shows imperial units, remember that 1 cup equals roughly 236.6 ml. For 960 ml, you’ll need just over 4 cups. Alternatively, a kitchen scale set to millilitres can provide even greater precision, especially for baking.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for 960 ml of Apple Cider Vinegar</h2>  
<p>This quantity is often used in bulk cooking, such as meal prepping sauces or marinades. For instance, a tangy BBQ sauce for air-fried wings might require 960 ml of apple cider vinegar as a base. It’s also handy for preserving foods, like quick-pickled onions or jalapeños. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable recipes</a> for ideas.</p>  

<p>In baking, apple cider vinegar reacts with baking soda to create lift in cakes or bread. A 960 ml batch could be portioned for multiple loaves or cupcakes. Always store unused vinegar in a cool, dark place to maintain its potency. For cleaning your air fryer after use, diluted apple cider vinegar works wonders—learn more in our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning guide</a>.</p>  

<h3>Converting Other Liquid Measurements</h3>  
<p>If you frequently work with millilitres and cups, memorising key conversions saves time. For example, 500 ml is about 2.11 cups, while 1 litre equals 4.23 cups. Keep a conversion chart handy, or bookmark our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> for quick reference. Consistency is key, whether you're cooking for one or meal prepping for the week.</p>

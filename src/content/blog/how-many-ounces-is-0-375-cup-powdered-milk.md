This conversion is essential for precise baking and cooking, especially when using an air fryer where measurements can make or break a recipe. Whether you're whipping up a cake or preparing a creamy sauce, knowing the exact weight ensures consistency.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on precise ingredient ratios to deliver perfect results. Too much or too little powdered milk can affect texture and taste.

<h3>How to Measure 0.375 Cup of Powdered Milk Correctly</h3>  
<p>Use a dry measuring cup for powdered milk, levelling it off with a straight edge for accuracy. Scooping directly from the bag can lead to uneven amounts.

<h2>Tips for Storing Powdered Milk</h2>

<p>60 ml of apple cider vinegar equals approximately 0.25 cups (or 1/4 cup). This conversion is essential for precise cooking and baking, especially when using an air fryer where measurements matter. Whether you're whipping up a marinade or a tangy glaze, knowing how many cups 60 ml of apple cider vinegar is will ensure your dish turns out perfectly every time.</p>

<h2>Understanding the Conversion</h2>
<p>Converting millilitres to cups can be tricky, but it’s straightforward once you know the basics. One cup is equivalent to 240 ml, so dividing 60 ml by 240 gives you 0.25 cups. This means 60 ml of apple cider vinegar is a quarter of a standard cup. For air fryer recipes, precision is key, so using a measuring jug or spoons can help avoid guesswork.</p>
<p>If you’re working with a recipe that calls for 60 ml of apple cider vinegar but only have cups handy, this conversion will save the day. Many air fryer recipes, like glazes for chicken or dressings for salads, rely on accurate measurements.

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter</h2>
<p>Apple cider vinegar is a powerful ingredient that can make or break a dish. Too much can overpower flavours, while too little might leave your meal lacking tang. In air fryer cooking, where ingredients cook quickly, balancing flavours is even more critical. Measuring 60 ml of apple cider vinegar correctly ensures your marinades, sauces, and dressings are spot-on.</p>

<h3>Tools for Measuring 60 ml of Apple Cider Vinegar</h3>
<p>While a liquid measuring cup is ideal, not everyone has one handy. A standard tablespoon holds about 15 ml, so four tablespoons equal 60 ml of apple cider vinegar. If you’re using a metric measuring jug, look for the 60 ml mark to ensure accuracy. For air fryer recipes, consistency is key, so investing in good measuring tools pays off.</p>

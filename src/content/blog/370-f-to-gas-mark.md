<p>370°F converts to Gas Mark 5 in UK ovens and air fryers. This medium-high temperature is perfect for baking, roasting, and achieving crispy textures in your air fryer. Whether you're adapting oven recipes or experimenting with new dishes, knowing this conversion ensures consistent results every time.</p>

<h2>Understanding 370 F to Gas Mark Conversion</h2>
<p>The Gas Mark system is uniquely British, with Gas Mark 5 representing 190°C or 375°F in most conventional ovens. At 370°F, you're just slightly below this standard mark, but Gas Mark 5 remains the closest equivalent. Many air fryer recipes at <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> use this temperature for perfect browning without burning. The slight 5°F difference won't significantly impact cooking times for most dishes.</p>
<p>When converting 370 degrees Fahrenheit to Gas Mark, remember that air fryers cook faster than traditional ovens. A recipe calling for 370°F (Gas Mark 5) in a conventional oven might need 5-10 minutes less in an air fryer. This is particularly important for baked goods like the cakes and cookies found in our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>cake recipe collection</a>, where precise temperatures affect texture and rise.</p>

<h2>When to Use 370 F (Gas Mark 5) in Your Air Fryer</h2>
<p>370°F to Gas Mark works exceptionally well for several air fryer applications. It's the sweet spot for roasting vegetables, achieving that perfect crisp on potatoes, or baking moist muffins. At this temperature, proteins like chicken or fish develop a golden exterior while staying juicy inside. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> shows how 370 F to Gas Mark compares to other common cooking temperatures.</p>
<p>For frozen foods – a staple in many UK households – 370°F (Gas Mark 5) helps recreate that 'just fried' texture without excess oil. Items like frozen chips, chicken nuggets, or spring rolls benefit from this temperature range. Just remember to shake the basket halfway through cooking for even results, as recommended in our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/frozen-foods>frozen foods guide</a>.</p>

<h3>Adjusting Cooking Times at 370 F</h3>
<p>While 370 F converts to Gas Mark 5, air fryers typically cook about 20% faster than conventional ovens at this temperature. A recipe suggesting 30 minutes at Gas Mark 5 might only need 24 minutes in your air fryer. Always check food 5 minutes before the suggested time, especially when trying new recipes from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>.</p>

<h2>Gas Mark 5 in Different Cooking Appliances</h2>
<p>370°F to Gas Mark conversion becomes slightly more complex when considering different oven types. In a fan-assisted oven, Gas Mark 5 (370°F) might cook even faster than in an air fryer due to the circulating hot air. Traditional gas ovens often have hotter and cooler spots, requiring occasional rotation of dishes for even cooking.</p>
<p>For those using both an air fryer and conventional oven, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning guide</a> includes tips for maintaining both appliances at high temperatures like 370°F (Gas Mark 5). Regular cleaning ensures accurate temperature readings and prevents smoke from built-up grease at these medium-high heat settings.</p>

<h3>Special Considerations for Baking</h3>
<p>When baking at 370 F (Gas Mark 5) in an air fryer, use oven-safe containers that allow air circulation. Silicone or metal bakeware works better than glass at this temperature. For delicate items like soufflés or custards, you might need to reduce the temperature slightly (to about 360°F) and extend cooking time to prevent over-browning.</p>

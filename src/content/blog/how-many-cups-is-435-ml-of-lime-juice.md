<h2>Why Accurate Lime Juice Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of lime juice is crucial for achieving the desired taste and texture in your air fryer dishes. Too much can overpower other flavours, while too little might leave your recipe lacking brightness. For example, a marinade for <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>air fryer chicken</a> often calls for precise lime juice measurements to tenderise the meat without making it too acidic. Similarly, baking recipes like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>lime-infused cakes</a> rely on exact ratios for the perfect rise and flavour balance.</p>

<h3>UK vs. US Cup Measurements</h3>  
<p>It’s worth noting that UK and US cup measurements differ slightly. In the UK, 1 cup equals 284 ml, while in the US, it’s 240 ml. This means 435 ml of lime juice translates to roughly 1.84 cups in the UK and 1.83 cups in the US. For most air fryer recipes, this minor difference won’t drastically affect the outcome, but it’s good to be aware of if precision is key.</p>  

<h2>How to Measure Lime Juice Without a Measuring Cup</h2>  
<p>If you don’t have a measuring cup handy, you can still measure 435 ml of lime juice using common kitchen tools. A standard UK tablespoon holds 15 ml, so 29 tablespoons would give you approximately 435 ml. Alternatively, a large glass or mug can serve as a rough guide—just ensure you’re familiar with its capacity beforehand. For more tips on accurate measurements, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a>, where precision is always prioritised.</p>  

<p>Another handy trick is to use a kitchen scale. Since lime juice has a similar density to water, 435 ml weighs roughly 435 grams. This method is especially useful for recipes where exact proportions are critical, such as <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>citrus-based desserts</a>. Just pour the juice into a bowl on the scale until you hit the desired weight.</p>  

<h3>Storing Leftover Lime Juice</h3>  
<p>If your recipe doesn’t use all 435 ml of lime juice, proper storage is key to preserving its freshness. Transfer the leftover juice to an airtight container and refrigerate it for up to a week. For longer storage, freeze the juice in ice cube trays—each cube typically holds about 30 ml, making it easy to portion out later. This way, you’ll always have lime juice ready for your next air fryer adventure.</p>

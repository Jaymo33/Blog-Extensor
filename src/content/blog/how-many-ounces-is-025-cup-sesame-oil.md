<p>0.25 cup of sesame oil equals approximately 2 ounces (or 59 ml) in UK measurements. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes, where precise measurements can make or break your dish. Whether you’re whipping up a marinade or drizzling oil for crispy results, knowing the exact weight ensures consistency. For more handy conversions, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of sesame oil can significantly impact your air fryer results. Too little, and your food may dry out; too much, and it could become greasy. That’s why converting 0.25 cup of sesame oil to ounces (2 oz) is so important. Many air fryer recipes, like those on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>our recipe hub</a>, rely on precise oil quantities for perfect texture and flavour. Whether you’re cooking vegetables, chicken, or tofu, getting the oil measurement right ensures crispy, golden results every time.</p>  

<p>Different oils have varying densities, but sesame oil is relatively consistent, making conversions straightforward. If you’re scaling a recipe up or down, knowing that 0.25 cup equals 2 ounces helps maintain balance. For more tips on air fryer cooking, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable recipes</a>, where precise oil measurements are key.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure 0.25 Cup of Sesame Oil Without a Scale</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a kitchen scale, you can still measure 0.25 cup of sesame oil accurately. A standard UK measuring cup holds 240 ml, so a quarter cup is 60 ml—close enough to 2 ounces for most recipes. For best results, use a clear liquid measuring cup and check at eye level. Need more guidance? Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning guide</a> also covers proper measuring tools maintenance.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for 0.25 Cup of Sesame Oil in Air Fryers</h2>  
<p>This small but mighty amount of sesame oil is perfect for coating vegetables, marinating proteins, or adding depth to stir-fries. For example, tossing broccoli in 0.25 cup (2 oz) of sesame oil before air frying enhances crispiness and flavour. You’ll find similar techniques in our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipes</a>, where sesame oil adds a rich, nutty taste.</p>  

<p>Another great use is in marinades—0.25 cup of sesame oil mixed with soy sauce and garlic makes a fantastic base. Since air fryers circulate hot air efficiently, a little oil goes a long way. Whether you’re cooking salmon or tofu, measuring 0.25 cup (2 oz) ensures even coating without excess grease.</p>  

<h3>Converting Other Sesame Oil Measurements</h3>  
<p>If your recipe calls for different amounts, here’s a quick reference: 1 cup of sesame oil equals 8 ounces, while 1 tablespoon is about 0.5 ounces. These conversions help adjust recipes for smaller or larger batches. For more air fryer measurement tips, browse our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a>.</p>

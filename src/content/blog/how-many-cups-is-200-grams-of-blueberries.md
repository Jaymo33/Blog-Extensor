<h2>Why Accurate Blueberry Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of blueberries ensures your recipes turn out perfectly every time. Too few, and your dish might lack flavour; too many, and it could become soggy or unbalanced. This is especially important in air frying, where even heat distribution relies on proper ingredient ratios. Whether you're making muffins or a fruit compote, 200 grams of blueberries (about 1.5 cups) is a common measurement in many recipes.

<p>Blueberries also vary in size, which can affect cup measurements. Smaller berries pack more tightly, while larger ones leave more gaps. If precision is key, weighing them is always best. A kitchen scale takes the guesswork out of conversions, ensuring consistency in both baking and air frying.

<p>If you donâ€™t have a scale, fluff the blueberries lightly before spooning them into a measuring cup. Avoid packing them down, as this can lead to an inaccurate measurement. For 200 grams of blueberries, aim for 1.5 cups, but adjust slightly if the berries are particularly large or small. This method works well for most recipes, including those designed for air fryers.

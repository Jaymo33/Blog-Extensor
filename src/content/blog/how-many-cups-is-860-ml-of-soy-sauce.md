<p>860 ml of soy sauce is roughly 3.63 cups. This conversion is essential for precise cooking, especially when using an air fryer where measurements can impact texture and flavour. Whether you're marinating chicken or whipping up a stir-fry, knowing how to convert millilitres to cups ensures consistency in your dishes.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Soy Sauce Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of soy sauce can make or break a dish. Too little, and your meal lacks depth; too much, and it becomes overly salty. Air fryer recipes, like those on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, often rely on precise liquid measurements for even cooking. A slight variation can affect browning, crispiness, or moisture levels.</p>  
<p>For example, if you're making teriyaki-glazed salmon in your air fryer, 860 ml of soy sauce (or 3.63 cups) ensures the marinade coats evenly without overpowering. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a> for more ideas where this conversion comes in handy.</p>  

<h2>How to Measure 860 ml of Soy Sauce Without a Scale</h2>  
<p>If you don’t have a measuring jug, use standard cup sizes. In the UK, 1 cup equals 250 ml, so 860 ml is just under 3.5 cups. For US measurements, 1 cup is 240 ml, making 860 ml approximately 3.63 cups. This small difference matters in baking, where precision is key.</p>  
<p>For air fryer cooking, consistency is crucial. Whether you’re preparing a <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken dish</a> or a tofu stir-fry, measuring soy sauce correctly ensures balanced flavours.

<h3>Common Recipes Using 860 ml of Soy Sauce</h3>  
<p>Many Asian-inspired dishes call for this quantity, such as large-batch marinades or dipping sauces. If you’re meal prepping, 860 ml (3.63 cups) of soy sauce could be used for multiple servings of beef bulgogi or stir-fried vegetables. The air fryer locks in these flavours beautifully.</p>  

<h2>Adjusting Recipes for Different Soy Sauce Types</h2>  
<p>Not all soy sauces are equal—light, dark, and low-sodium varieties differ in saltiness. If a recipe specifies 860 ml of standard soy sauce but you’re using a low-sodium version, you might need slightly more. Always taste as you go, especially when adapting <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable-based recipes</a>.</p>

<h2>How to Measure 500g of Cream Cheese</h2>  
<p>Measuring cream cheese can be tricky, especially if it's soft or spreadable. For 500g (17.64 oz), use a kitchen scale for accuracy. If you don’t have one, most standard cream cheese blocks in the UK are 200g each, so 2.5 blocks will give you 500g.</p>  
<p>For air fryer recipes, like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>desserts</a>, precise measurements ensure even cooking. Softened cream cheese blends better, so let it sit at room temperature before measuring. Avoid packing it tightly, as this can skew the weight.</p>

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on precise ingredient ratios to deliver crispy, evenly cooked results. Too much or too little powdered milk can affect the consistency of batters, coatings, or sauces. For example, a dry rub with powdered milk needs the right balance to crisp up chicken or vegetables. If you're meal prepping, accuracy ensures your dishes reheat perfectly later. Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> for inspiration on using powdered milk in coatings or dips.</p>  

<h3>How to measure 40g of powdered milk without scales</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a kitchen scale, use tablespoons to measure powdered milk. One level tablespoon holds roughly 7g, so 40g is about 5.5 tablespoons. Fluff the powder first to avoid compacting it, then spoon and level for accuracy. This method works well for small batches of air fryer breading or seasoning mixes. For larger quantities, investing in a digital scale is a game-changer.</p>

<p>40 grams of powdered milk equals approximately 1.41 ounces. Whether you're whipping up a creamy sauce or baking in your air fryer, precise measurements matter. This conversion ensures your recipes turn out perfectly every time, avoiding any mishaps with texture or flavour. For more handy conversions, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on precise ingredient ratios to deliver crispy, evenly cooked results. Too much or too little powdered milk can affect the consistency of batters, coatings, or sauces. For example, a dry rub with powdered milk needs the right balance to crisp up chicken or vegetables. If you're meal prepping, accuracy ensures your dishes reheat perfectly later. Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> for inspiration on using powdered milk in coatings or dips.</p>  

<h3>How to measure 40g of powdered milk without scales</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a kitchen scale, use tablespoons to measure powdered milk. One level tablespoon holds roughly 7g, so 40g is about 5.5 tablespoons. Fluff the powder first to avoid compacting it, then spoon and level for accuracy. This method works well for small batches of air fryer breading or seasoning mixes. For larger quantities, investing in a digital scale is a game-changer.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for powdered milk in air fryer recipes</h2>  
<p>Powdered milk adds richness to air fryer coatings, like crispy chicken or fish. It helps achieve a golden crust while keeping the interior moist. You can also mix it into doughs for air-fried bread or biscuits, enhancing texture and browning. Some chefs even use it in dry rubs for meats or tofu. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipes</a> for ideas on incorporating powdered milk.</p>  

<h3>Converting other weights of powdered milk to ounces</h3>  
<p>Need to adjust your recipe? Here’s a quick reference: 20g is 0.7 oz, 50g is 1.76 oz, and 100g is 3.53 oz. Bookmark this guide for future air fryer experiments. Remember, slight variations can occur based on how densely packed your powdered milk is.

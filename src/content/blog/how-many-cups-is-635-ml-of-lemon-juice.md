<p>635 ml of lemon juice is approximately 2.68 cups. This conversion is essential for recipes that require precise measurements, especially when using an air fryer. Whether you're making a zesty marinade or a tangy dessert, knowing how to convert millilitres to cups ensures your dish turns out perfectly. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we help simplify these conversions so you can focus on cooking.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>When working with lemon juice, even small measurement errors can affect the taste and texture of your dish. Too much acidity can overpower flavours, while too little might leave your recipe lacking brightness. For air fryer recipes, precise liquid measurements also impact cooking times and results. A <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a> can be a lifesaver for avoiding guesswork.</p>  

<p>Lemon juice is a common ingredient in marinades, dressings, and desserts. Whether you're preparing a <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>lemon-herb chicken</a> or a citrusy cake, knowing that 635 ml equals roughly 2.68 cups ensures consistency. This accuracy is especially important for air fryer cooking, where evaporation rates can differ from conventional ovens.</p>  

<h2>How to Measure 635 ml of Lemon Juice</h2>  
<p>If you don’t have a measuring jug with millilitre markings, use a standard cup measure. Since 1 cup equals 237 ml, 635 ml works out to just under 2 and 2/3 cups. For best results, use a liquid measuring cup for accuracy. Avoid using dry measuring cups, as they can lead to slight discrepancies.</p>  

<h3>Converting Lemon Juice for Different Recipes</h3>  
<p>Lemon juice conversions are handy for both baking and cooking. For example, if a <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert recipe</a> calls for 635 ml, you’ll need about 2.68 cups. If you’re making a savoury dish like lemon garlic shrimp, the same conversion applies. Always check whether your recipe uses UK or US cup measurements, as they can vary slightly.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for 635 ml of Lemon Juice</h2>  
<p>This quantity of lemon juice is perfect for large-batch recipes. You might use it for a big batch of lemonade, a marinade for <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/seafood>seafood</a>, or a citrus glaze for cakes. Since lemon juice can also be used for cleaning your air fryer, knowing conversions helps when mixing natural cleaning solutions. Check out our guide on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>keeping your air fryer spotless</a>.</p>  

<h3>Adjusting Recipes for Smaller Quantities</h3>  
<p>If you only need half the amount, simply halve the conversion—317.5 ml equals about 1.34 cups. For recipes requiring less acidity, you can also dilute lemon juice with water. Just remember that this might alter cooking times in your air fryer, so adjust accordingly.</p>  

<h2>Tips for Storing Leftover Lemon Juice</h2>  
<p>If you don’t use all 635 ml at once, store the remainder in an airtight container in the fridge. Lemon juice stays fresh for up to a week, or you can freeze it in ice cube trays for longer storage. This way, you’ll always have lemon juice ready for your next <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipe</a>.</p>

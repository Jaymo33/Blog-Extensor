<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>When working with lemon juice, even small measurement errors can affect the taste and texture of your dish.

This accuracy is especially important for air fryer cooking, where evaporation rates can differ from conventional ovens.</p>  

<h2>How to Measure 635 ml of Lemon Juice</h2>  
<p>If you don’t have a measuring jug with millilitre markings, use a standard cup measure. Since 1 cup equals 237 ml, 635 ml works out to just under 2 and 2/3 cups. For best results, use a liquid measuring cup for accuracy. Avoid using dry measuring cups, as they can lead to slight discrepancies.</p>

<h3>Adjusting Recipes for Smaller Quantities</h3>

<h2>Tips for Storing Leftover Lemon Juice</h2>  
<p>If you don’t use all 635 ml at once, store the remainder in an airtight container in the fridge. Lemon juice stays fresh for up to a week, or you can freeze it in ice cube trays for longer storage.

<h2>UK vs. US Cup Measurements</h2>
<p>It’s worth noting that cup measurements can vary slightly between the UK and the US. A UK cup holds 284 ml, while a US cup is 236.59 ml. However, for simplicity, most recipes—including those on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>—use the US standard unless specified. So, 1.25 US cups of olive oil is 295.74 ml, whereas 1.25 UK cups would be 355 ml.</p>
<p>If you’re following a British recipe, double-check whether it uses UK or US measurements. For air fryer cooking, sticking to the US standard (295.74 ml for 1.25 cups) is generally safe unless the recipe states otherwise. This avoids confusion and ensures your dishes turn out as intended.</p>

<h3>How to Measure Olive Oil Without a Cup</h3>
<p>Don’t have a measuring cup? No problem. You can use a kitchen scale to measure olive oil by weight. One millilitre of olive oil weighs roughly 0.92 grams, so 295.74 ml (1.25 cups) would be about 272 grams. Alternatively, use a tablespoon—15 ml per tablespoon—meaning 1.25 cups is roughly 20 tablespoons. This hack is handy for quick adjustments mid-recipe.</p>

<p>1.25 cups of olive oil is equivalent to approximately 295.74 millilitres (ml). This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements can make or break your dish. Whether you're baking, frying, or drizzling, knowing the exact ml for 1.25 cups of olive oil ensures consistent results every time.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Olive Oil Measurements Matter</h2>
<p>Using the right amount of olive oil in your air fryer recipes is crucial for texture, flavour, and cooking efficiency. Too little oil can leave food dry, while too much can make it greasy. For example, crispy <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/potatoes>air fryer potatoes</a> need just the right drizzle to achieve that perfect golden crunch. Measuring 1.25 cups of olive oil in ml helps you stay precise, especially when scaling recipes up or down.</p>
<p>Olive oil is a staple in many air fryer dishes, from roasted vegetables to marinated meats. If you're preparing a batch of <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer chicken</a>, knowing that 1.25 cups equals 295.74 ml ensures your marinade isn’t overly oily. This level of accuracy is why professional chefs and home cooks alike rely on conversions like these.</p>

<h2>UK vs. US Cup Measurements</h2>
<p>It’s worth noting that cup measurements can vary slightly between the UK and the US. A UK cup holds 284 ml, while a US cup is 236.59 ml. However, for simplicity, most recipes—including those on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>—use the US standard unless specified. So, 1.25 US cups of olive oil is 295.74 ml, whereas 1.25 UK cups would be 355 ml.</p>
<p>If you’re following a British recipe, double-check whether it uses UK or US measurements. For air fryer cooking, sticking to the US standard (295.74 ml for 1.25 cups) is generally safe unless the recipe states otherwise. This avoids confusion and ensures your dishes turn out as intended.</p>

<h3>How to Measure Olive Oil Without a Cup</h3>
<p>Don’t have a measuring cup? No problem. You can use a kitchen scale to measure olive oil by weight. One millilitre of olive oil weighs roughly 0.92 grams, so 295.74 ml (1.25 cups) would be about 272 grams. Alternatively, use a tablespoon—15 ml per tablespoon—meaning 1.25 cups is roughly 20 tablespoons. This hack is handy for quick adjustments mid-recipe.</p>

<h2>Common Uses for 1.25 Cups of Olive Oil in Air Fryers</h2>
<p>From marinades to coatings, 1.25 cups (295.74 ml) of olive oil can go a long way in air fryer cooking. For instance, it’s enough to coat a large batch of <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>air fryer vegetables</a> evenly. You could also use it to crisp up homemade falafel or brush onto <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>air fryer chicken wings</a> for extra flavour.</p>
<p>Another great use is for making air fryer-infused oils. Heat 1.25 cups of olive oil with herbs like rosemary or garlic, then strain and store for drizzling over dishes. Just remember to measure carefully—295.74 ml ensures your infused oil isn’t too diluted or overpowering.</p>

<h3>Tips for Storing Olive Oil</h3>
<p>To keep your olive oil fresh, store it in a cool, dark place away from heat sources. Air fryers generate heat, so avoid keeping the oil too close to the appliance. Proper storage ensures your 1.25 cups (295.74 ml) of olive oil stays flavourful for longer, whether you’re using it for cooking or finishing dishes.</p>

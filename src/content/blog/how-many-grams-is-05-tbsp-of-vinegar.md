<h2>Why accurate vinegar measurements matter</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of vinegar can make or break a dish. Too little, and your marinade lacks punch; too much, and it overpowers other flavours. In air fryer cooking, precise measurements ensure even cooking and balanced taste. For example, a <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe</a> calling for 0.5 tbsp of vinegar (7.5g) in a glaze ensures crispy, flavourful results without sogginess.</p>  

<p>Different vinegars have slight density variations, but most hover around 15g per tbsp. White, apple cider, and balsamic vinegars are commonly used in air fryer recipes, from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken dishes</a> to roasted vegetables. Measuring by weight eliminates guesswork, especially when scaling recipes up or down.</p>  

<h3>How to measure 0.5 tbsp of vinegar without scales</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a kitchen scale, use a standard UK tablespoon (15ml) and fill it halfway for 0.5 tbsp. For small quantities like 7.5g, a measuring spoon set is handy. Avoid using tableware spoons, as sizes vary. For sticky ingredients like balsamic vinegar, lightly coat the spoon with oil for easier pouring.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for 0.5 tbsp of vinegar in air fryers</h2>  
<p>This small quantity is perfect for balancing flavours. Add it to marinades for <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/potatoes>air-fried potatoes</a> or mix with oil for a light dressing. It also helps tenderise meats and adds acidity to cut through rich dishes. For cleaning your air fryer, a 0.5 tbsp vinegar solution (mixed with water) can remove grease—see our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning guide</a> for tips.</p>

<h3>Converting other vinegar quantities to grams</h3>  
<p>Need 1 tbsp? That’s roughly 15g. For larger batches, multiply accordingly (e.g., 2 tbsp = 30g). If a recipe lists millilitres, note that 1 tbsp = 15ml, but weight is more accurate for thick vinegars like balsamic. Bookmark our conversion chart for quick reference.</p>

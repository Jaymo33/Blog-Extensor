<p>3 cups of golden syrup equals approximately 36 ounces. This conversion is essential for precise measurements in baking and air fryer recipes, ensuring your dishes turn out perfectly every time. Golden syrup, a staple in British kitchens, has a thick consistency, so accurate measuring is key. Whether you're making sticky toffee pudding or glazing meats in your air fryer, knowing this conversion saves time and avoids guesswork. For more handy conversions, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter</h2>  
<p>Golden syrup’s viscosity means even small measurement errors can affect your recipe’s outcome. Too much syrup can make desserts overly sweet or sauces too thick, while too little might leave dishes lacking flavour. Air fryer recipes, like glazed chicken or baked goods, rely on precise ratios for even cooking. Using 36 ounces (or 3 cups) ensures consistency, whether you’re scaling up or down. For recipe ideas, browse our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes collection</a>.</p>  

<p>Measuring by weight (ounces) is often more reliable than volume (cups), especially for sticky ingredients like golden syrup. A kitchen scale eliminates discrepancies caused by how the syrup settles in a cup. If you don’t have one, spoon the syrup into a measuring cup and level it off for the closest approximation. Remember, 3 cups of golden syrup to ounces is a fixed ratio, but always double-check if adapting recipes.</p>  

<h2>Converting golden syrup for air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Many air fryer recipes call for golden syrup as a glaze or sweetener, from crispy bacon to roasted vegetables. Knowing that 3 cups equal 36 ounces helps you adjust quantities without compromising texture or taste. For example, a marinade might require ½ cup (6 ounces) of syrup—easy to calculate once you know the base conversion. Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipes</a> for inspiration on using golden syrup in savoury dishes.</p>  

<h3>Tips for measuring golden syrup</h3>  
<p>To avoid mess, lightly grease your measuring cup or spoon before adding golden syrup—it’ll slide out effortlessly. Warm the syrup slightly if it’s too thick to pour, but don’t overheat it, as this can alter its properties. For sticky residues, clean your air fryer basket promptly with our recommended <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner</a>. Proper tools and techniques make working with golden syrup a breeze.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for golden syrup in air fryers</h2>  
<p>Golden syrup isn’t just for desserts; it’s a versatile ingredient in air fryer cooking. Use it to glaze sausages, caramelise nuts, or add shine to pastries. Since 3 cups of golden syrup to oz is 36, you can easily halve or double amounts for different batch sizes. Try drizzling it over <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>air fryer desserts</a> like baked apples or banana fritters for a touch of sweetness. Its high sugar content also helps achieve a crispy finish on meats.</p>  

<p>When substituting golden syrup in recipes, note that its flavour is distinct from honey or maple syrup. Its buttery, caramel-like taste pairs well with both sweet and savoury dishes. If a recipe specifies 3 cups (36 ounces), stick to golden syrup unless alternatives are suggested.

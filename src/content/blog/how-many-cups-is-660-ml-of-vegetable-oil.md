<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>
<p>Using the right amount of vegetable oil is crucial for air fryer recipes. Too little oil, and your food may turn out dry or unevenly cooked. Too much, and you risk soggy results or excess smoke.

This ensures your dishes come out perfectly crispy every time.</p>

<p>For example, if a recipe calls for 660 ml of vegetable oil, you’ll need just under 3 cups. This measurement is especially useful for larger batches or family-sized portions.

<h2>How to Measure 660 ml of Vegetable Oil Without a Scale</h2>

For smaller increments, use tablespoons: 1 cup is 16 tablespoons, so 2.79 cups would be about 44.6 tablespoons.</p>

<p>Another handy trick is to use a liquid measuring cup with both ml and cup measurements. This eliminates the need for conversions and reduces errors. If you’re preparing a recipe from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart</a>, double-check the measurements before adding oil.

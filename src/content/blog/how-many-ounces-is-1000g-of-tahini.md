<h2>Why convert 1000g of tahini to ounces?</h2>  
<p>Many UK recipes use grams, but some air fryer guides or imported cookbooks list ingredients in ounces. Converting 1000g of tahini to ounces (35.27 oz) ensures accuracy, especially for sauces and dips. A slight miscalculation can alter texture and taste, so precise measurements matter.

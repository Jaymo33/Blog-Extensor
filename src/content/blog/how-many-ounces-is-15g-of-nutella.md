<p>15g of Nutella equals approximately 0.53 ounces. If you're working on an air fryer recipe that calls for Nutella, getting the measurement right is key for perfect results. Whether you're making Nutella-stuffed pastries or drizzling it over desserts, this conversion ensures accuracy.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Using the correct amount of Nutella can make or break your air fryer recipes. Too much can cause spills or uneven cooking, while too little might leave your dish lacking flavour. Air fryers cook quickly, so precise measurements help avoid burnt or undercooked results.

<p>Nutella’s thick consistency means weighing it is often easier than measuring by volume. A digital kitchen scale ensures you get exactly 15g (or 0.53 ounces) every time. If you're scaling up a recipe, this precision becomes even more important.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure 15g of Nutella Without a Scale</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a scale, you can use a tablespoon to approximate 15g of Nutella. One level tablespoon is roughly 15g, but this can vary slightly depending on how heaped the spoon is. For best results, lightly scrape off any excess for an accurate measure.</p>  

<h2>Common Air Fryer Recipes Using Nutella</h2>  
<p>Nutella works wonderfully in air fryer desserts, from stuffed croissants to chocolate-filled pancakes. If you're looking for inspiration, browse <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>our recipe collection</a> for sweet treats. The key is using the right amount—15g (0.53 ounces) is perfect for single servings.</p>  

<p>Another popular option is Nutella-stuffed French toast, where 15g per portion ensures a gooey centre without leaking. Since air fryers circulate hot air, keeping fillings contained prevents mess and ensures even cooking.</p>  

<h3>Converting Larger Quantities of Nutella</h3>  
<p>If your recipe requires more, remember that 100g of Nutella equals about 3.53 ounces. This is handy for batch cooking or meal prep. For more ideas, explore <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert recipes</a> tailored for air fryers.</p>  

<h2>Storing Nutella for Air Fryer Use</h2>  
<p>Nutella’s shelf life is long, but once opened, it’s best used within a few months. Store it in a cool, dry place to maintain its texture. If it hardens, a quick warm-up in the microwave (or air fryer at low heat) can soften it for easier measuring.</p>  

<p>For sticky residues, clean your air fryer basket promptly with <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>our recommended cleaner</a>. Nutella can caramelise and stick if left unattended, making cleanup harder.</p>  

<h3>Nutella Alternatives for Dietary Needs</h3>  
<p>If you’re avoiding dairy or nuts, many chocolate-hazelnut spreads offer similar consistency. Check labels for weight equivalents, as some may differ slightly from Nutella’s 15g-to-0.53-ounce ratio.</p>

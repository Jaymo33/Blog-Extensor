<p>150 grams of honey equals approximately 0.5 cups (½ cup) in standard UK and US measurements. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements affect texture and caramelisation. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we know accurate conversions make the difference between sticky buns and baking triumphs.</p>

<h2>Why Honey Measurements Matter in Air Fryers</h2>
<p>Air fryers circulate hot air rapidly, causing sugars like honey to behave differently than in conventional ovens. Using 150 grams of honey (0.5 cups) ensures even caramelisation without burning. Many <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer dessert recipes</a> rely on this golden ratio for glazes or cake batters. Too much honey can make foods overly sticky, while too little may dry them out. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a> simplifies these adjustments.</p>

<p>Honey’s viscosity varies with temperature – 150 grams of chilled honey occupies slightly less volume than warmed honey. For consistent results, weigh honey directly or use liquid measuring cups at room temperature. This precision is especially crucial for <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>air fryer cakes</a> where batter density affects rise.</p>

<h3>UK vs US Cup Measurements for Honey</h3>
<p>Both UK and US standard cups measure 150 grams of honey as 0.5 cups, but slight variations exist in legal cup sizes. The UK metric cup is 250ml, while the US customary cup is 240ml. In practice, this 4% difference won’t impact most <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>air fryer recipes</a> calling for 150g honey. However, professional bakers may prefer weighing ingredients for absolute consistency.</p>

<h2>Converting 150 Grams of Honey for Different Recipes</h2>
<p>When adapting oven recipes for air fryers, converting 150 grams of honey to cups (0.5 cups) helps maintain moisture balance. Air fryers’ efficient heating requires slightly less liquid than traditional baking. For example, reduce other liquids by 1-2 tablespoons when using 150g honey in <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cookies>air fryer cookies</a> to prevent spreading.</p>

<p>For savoury dishes like honey-glazed chicken, 150 grams of honey provides enough sweetness for 4-6 portions. The concentrated heat of air fryers intensifies honey’s flavour, so you might use slightly less than in oven recipes. Always preheat your air fryer when working with honey-based marinades to ensure even coating.</p>

<h3>Tips for Measuring 150g Honey Without Scales</h3>
<p>If you lack kitchen scales, visualise 150 grams of honey as filling half a standard 250ml cup. Coat your measuring cup with oil first – honey’s stickiness makes it prone to clinging. For smaller quantities, remember that 1 tablespoon equals about 21 grams, so 150 grams is roughly 7 tablespoons. These methods work well for most <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>air fryer desserts</a>.</p>

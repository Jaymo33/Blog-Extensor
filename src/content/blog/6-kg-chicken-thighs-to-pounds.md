Whether you're meal prepping or cooking for a crowd, knowing this exact conversion helps with portion control and recipe scaling."

    "text": "Yes, cooking time adjustments are necessary when working with larger quantities like 6 kg of chicken thighs (approximately 13.23 pounds). While the per-piece cooking time remains similar, you'll likely need to cook in multiple batches to avoid overcrowding the air fryer basket.\n\nOvercrowding prevents proper air circulation, leading to uneven cooking and less crispy results. Always allow space between chicken thighs for optimal air flow. Use a meat thermometer to check that each batch reaches the safe internal temperature of 75°C before serving."

    "text": "The conversion from 6 kg to pounds remains the same regardless of whether your chicken thighs are bone-in or boneless - it's still approximately 13.23 pounds. However, the presence of bones affects the edible yield and cooking characteristics.\n\nBone-in chicken thighs will have less actual meat weight after cooking due to the bone weight, while boneless thighs provide more edible meat per pound. Bone-in thighs may also require slightly longer cooking times in the air fryer to ensure the meat near the bone cooks thoroughly."

So 6 kg of any chicken part will convert to approximately 13.23 pounds regardless of the cut.\n\nHowever, different cuts require different air frying times and temperatures. Chicken breasts cook faster than thighs, while wings and drumsticks have their own ideal cooking settings. Always adjust cooking times based on the specific cut you're using, even when the weight conversion remains the same."

<p>To reheat dumplings in an air fryer, set the temperature to 160°C (320°F) and cook for 3–5 minutes until piping hot. This method restores crispiness while keeping the filling moist – far better than microwaving. Whether you’ve got leftover takeaway dumplings or homemade ones from the fridge, your air fryer’s circulating heat works wonders.</p>

<h2>Why Use an Air Fryer to Reheat Dumplings?</h2>
<p>Air fryers excel at reheating dumplings because their rapid hot air circulation mimics deep-frying without excess oil. Unlike microwaves that leave skins rubbery, or ovens that dry them out, air fryers revive that golden crunch. For frozen dumplings, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/frozen-foods>frozen foods guide</a> for adjusted timings. Even delicate gyoza or bao buns reheat beautifully with this method.</p>
<p>Preheating your air fryer for 2 minutes ensures even cooking – just arrange dumplings in a single layer with space between each. Spritz lightly with oil if they’ve dried out overnight. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we’ve tested every variable: 160°C (320°F) is the sweet spot for most dumpling types without burning the wrappers.</p>

<h2>Step-by-Step Reheating Instructions</h2>
<h3>For Fresh or Refrigerated Dumplings</h3>
<p>Start by placing room-temperature dumplings in the basket – never overcrowd. Cook at 160°C (320°F) for 3 minutes, shake gently, then check. Add 1–2 more minutes if needed. Steam-fried dumplings may need a damp parchment liner to prevent sticking (find our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-liners>liner tips here</a>). Always serve immediately for maximum crispness.</p>

<h3>For Frozen Dumplings</h3>
<p>No thawing required! Cook frozen dumplings at 180°C (356°F) for 6–8 minutes, flipping halfway. The higher temp counters the icy core. Pair with our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>quick dipping sauce recipes</a> for a restaurant-worthy finish.</p>

<h2>Pro Tips for Perfect Results</h2>
<p>Different dumpling wrappers (wheat, rice, or tapioca) react uniquely to reheating. Thicker skins tolerate 170°C (338°F), while translucent har gow need just 150°C (302°F). For stuffed bao buns, wrap in foil to retain moisture. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a> helps adjust any recipe.</p>
<p>If reheating multiple batches, keep cooked dumplings warm in a 60°C (140°F) oven. Avoid stacking – they’ll steam and soften. For extra crispness, lightly brush with oil or egg wash before air frying. Leftover fried dumplings? They’ll re-crisp in just 2 minutes at 170°C (338°F).</p>

<h2>Troubleshooting Common Issues</h2>
<p>Soggy bottoms? Elevate dumplings on a trivet or perforated parchment. Burnt edges? Lower the temp by 10°C and reduce time. For fillings that cool faster than wrappers (like meat-heavy ones), tent with foil after the first 2 minutes.

<p>Stuck wrappers usually mean insufficient oil or overcrowding. A light spritz of water can help release them mid-cook. If your air fryer model runs hot (like Ninja or Philips), start checking 1 minute earlier than recommended. Dumplings with cheese fillings may need foil shields to prevent leaks.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Sugar Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Baking</h2>  
<p>Granulated sugar is a staple in many air fryer recipes, from cakes to cookies. Using the correct weight ensures your baked goods have the right texture and sweetness. Too much sugar can lead to overly crisp or burnt edges, while too little may result in bland flavours. For consistent results, weighing ingredients like 1.5 cups of granulated sugar in ounces is key. Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> for inspiration on perfectly measured treats.</p>  

<p>Air fryers cook food faster than conventional ovens, making precision even more critical. A slight variation in sugar quantity can affect browning and caramelisation. If you're new to air fryer baking, start with accurate conversions like 1.5 cups to ounces for foolproof desserts. Need cleaning tips after baking? Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner guide</a> keeps your appliance spotless.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure 1.5 Cups of Granulated Sugar Correctly</h3>  
<p>For the most accurate conversion of 1.5 cups of granulated sugar to ounces, use a kitchen scale. Scoop the sugar into a measuring cup without packing it down, then level it off with a straight edge. This method prevents excess sugar, which could throw off your recipe. If you don’t have a scale, remember that 1 cup of granulated sugar weighs roughly 7.05 ounces, so 1.5 cups equal 10.58 ounces.</p>  

<h2>Common Air Fryer Recipes Using 1.5 Cups of Granulated Sugar</h2>  
<p>Many air fryer desserts call for 1.5 cups of granulated sugar, including classic sponge cakes and chewy cookies. This measurement balances sweetness without overpowering other flavours. For example, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>air fryer cake recipes</a> often use this quantity for moist, evenly baked results. Whether you're making a vanilla pound cake or chocolate chip cookies, precise sugar measurements are crucial.</p>  

<p>Air fryers excel at baking, but ingredient ratios must be spot-on. If a recipe lists 1.5 cups of granulated sugar, converting it to ounces (10.58 oz) ensures consistency. This is especially helpful for UK bakers, where metric measurements are standard.

<h3>Tips for Adjusting Sugar in Air Fryer Recipes</h3>  
<p>If you're reducing sugar in a recipe calling for 1.5 cups of granulated sugar, adjust other ingredients accordingly. Sugar contributes to texture and browning, so cutting it may require extra moisture. For healthier alternatives, try substituting part of the sugar with applesauce or mashed banana. Always weigh your adjustments in ounces for accuracy, especially in air fryer baking where heat distribution is intense.</p>

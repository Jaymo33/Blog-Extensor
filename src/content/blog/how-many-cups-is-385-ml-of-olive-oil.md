<p>385 ml of olive oil equals approximately 1.63 cups. This conversion is essential for air fryer cooking, where precise measurements can make or break a recipe. Whether you’re whipping up crispy roast potatoes or a succulent chicken dish, knowing how to convert millilitres to cups ensures consistent results every time. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we’re all about making cooking simpler, so let’s dive into the details.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>
<p>Using the right amount of olive oil in your air fryer is crucial for achieving that perfect crispiness without excess grease. Too little oil, and your food might turn out dry; too much, and it could become soggy. For recipes calling for 385 ml of olive oil, knowing the cup equivalent helps streamline your prep. This measurement is common in many European recipes, so converting it to cups is handy for UK and US cooks alike. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more quick reference guides.</p>

<p>Olive oil is a staple in Mediterranean-inspired dishes, and many air fryer recipes, like roasted vegetables or garlic prawns, rely on it. Whether you’re meal prepping or cooking for a crowd, getting the measurement right ensures your dish turns out as intended. If you’re working with a recipe that lists 385 ml of olive oil, you’ll now know it’s roughly 1.63 cups.

<h3>How to Measure 385 ml of Olive Oil Without a Measuring Cup</h3>
<p>If you don’t have a measuring cup handy, you can still measure 385 ml of olive oil using common kitchen tools. A standard UK tablespoon holds about 15 ml, so 385 ml would be roughly 25.6 tablespoons. Alternatively, a US liquid measuring cup typically has millilitre markings, making it easier to measure directly. For air fryer cooking, precision matters, so investing in a good set of measuring tools is worthwhile.

<h2>Converting 385 ml of Olive Oil for Different Recipes</h2>
<p>Whether you’re baking, frying, or drizzling, 385 ml of olive oil (1.63 cups) can be used in various ways. For air fryer recipes like crispy chicken wings or herb-roasted potatoes, this amount ensures even coating without overdoing it. If you’re adapting a recipe from metric to imperial measurements, this conversion saves time and guesswork. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a> includes plenty of dishes where this measurement comes in handy.</p>

<p>When working with frozen foods in the air fryer, a light coating of olive oil prevents sticking and enhances texture. For example, 385 ml of olive oil is perfect for batch-cooking frozen sweet potato fries or onion rings. Remember, air fryers require less oil than traditional frying, so this measurement goes a long way. For more tips on cooking frozen foods, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/frozen-foods>frozen foods section</a>.</p>

<h3>Common Mistakes When Measuring Olive Oil for Air Fryers</h3>
<p>One mistake many home cooks make is eyeballing olive oil measurements, which can lead to inconsistent results. Pouring 385 ml of olive oil directly into the air fryer basket without measuring might result in uneven cooking or excess oil pooling at the bottom. Always use a measuring cup or scale for accuracy. Another tip: lightly spray or brush the oil onto food for even distribution, especially when working with smaller quantities.</p>

<p>264°F converts to approximately 130°C in a fan oven. This temperature is commonly used for slow roasting or dehydrating in air fryers and convection ovens. Understanding these conversions helps when adapting recipes between different cooking appliances.</p>

<h2>Why Convert 264 F to Fan Oven?</h2>
<p>Fan ovens circulate hot air for even cooking, similar to air fryers. Converting 264 F ensures your dishes cook properly when switching between appliances. Many <a href="https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes">air fryer recipes</a> originally designed for conventional ovens need temperature adjustments.</p>
<p>The 264 F (130°C fan) range is ideal for delicate foods that benefit from gentle heat. This includes dehydrating fruits, slow-cooking meats, or proofing bread dough. Our <a href="https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart">conversion chart</a> makes these adjustments simple for any home cook.</p>

<h2>How Fan Ovens Differ From Conventional Ovens</h2>
<p>Fan ovens cook about 20°C hotter than conventional ovens at the same setting. This means 264 F converts differently depending on your oven type. For air fryers, which work like mini convection ovens, the 264 F setting provides similar results to 130°C in a fan oven.</p>
<p>This difference matters most when preparing <a href="https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken">chicken dishes</a> or baked goods. The circulating air in fan ovens and air fryers cooks food faster and more evenly. Always reduce temperatures by 20°C when converting from conventional to fan oven settings.</p>

<h3>Precision Cooking With 264 F</h3>
<p>The 264 F (130°C fan) temperature offers precise control for specific cooking techniques. It's perfect for dehydrating herbs or making jerky in your air fryer. This low-and-slow approach preserves flavors while removing moisture effectively.</p>

<h2>Converting Other Temperatures</h2>
<p>While we've focused on 264 F, our conversion principles apply to any temperature. The same 20°C reduction rule works for most fan oven conversions. Bookmark our <a href="https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk">airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> site for quick reference when cooking.</p>
<p>Remember that cooking times may vary between appliances even at correct temperatures. Always check food doneness with a thermometer when trying new conversions. This is especially important for <a href="https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/beef">beef recipes</a> where doneness affects safety and quality.</p>

<h3>Air Fryer Specific Considerations</h3>
<p>Modern air fryers often include both Fahrenheit and Celsius settings. The 264 F setting directly translates to about 130°C in most models. However, compact air fryer baskets may require slight time adjustments compared to larger fan ovens.</p>

<h2>Common Uses for 264 F in Cooking</h2>
<p>This temperature range shines for several cooking methods beyond basic conversions. It's ideal for proofing dough, slow-roasting vegetables, or keeping dishes warm. The gentle heat prevents burning while allowing thorough cooking.</p>
<p>When using your air fryer at 264 F (130°C fan), consider <a href="https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner">proper cleaning</a> between uses. Lower temperatures can sometimes lead to more residue buildup compared to high-heat cooking. Regular maintenance ensures optimal performance.</p>

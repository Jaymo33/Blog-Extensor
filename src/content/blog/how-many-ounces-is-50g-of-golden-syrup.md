<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers cook food faster and more evenly than conventional ovens, so precise ingredient quantities are vital. Too much golden syrup can lead to overly sticky or burnt results, while too little might leave your dish lacking sweetness. Measuring 50g of golden syrup in ounces (1.76 oz) ensures your recipes turn out perfectly every time. This is especially important for desserts like flapjacks or glazes for meats, where balance is key.

<p>Golden syrup’s density means volume measurements (like tablespoons) can vary, making weight conversions like 50g to ounces more reliable. A kitchen scale is the best tool for this, but if you don’t have one, remember that 50g golden syrup to oz is roughly 1.76. For sticky ingredients like this, lightly greasing your measuring spoon or cup can help with clean pouring.

<h3>How to measure golden syrup without a scale</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have scales, you can estimate 50g of golden syrup (1.76 oz) using tablespoons. One tablespoon holds about 25g of golden syrup, so two level tablespoons will get you close to 50g. However, this method isn’t as precise as weighing, so for baking recipes, we recommend investing in digital scales.

<h2>Common uses for 50g golden syrup in air fryer recipes</h2>  
<p>Golden syrup adds moisture and caramelised flavour to air fryer dishes. A 50g portion (1.76 oz) is perfect for glazing ham, sweetening porridge, or creating glossy pastry toppings. Its high sugar content helps achieve that desirable golden-brown finish unique to air-fried foods. When converting traditional oven recipes to air fryer versions, adjusting syrup quantities like 50g to ounces ensures proper caramelisation without burning.

<p>In savoury dishes, 50g of golden syrup (1.76 oz) can balance spicy or salty flavours in marinades. Its viscosity also helps coatings adhere to foods like chicken wings or tofu before air frying. Remember that air fryers intensify sweetness, so you might need slightly less than 50g golden syrup compared to oven baking. The concentrated heat caramelises sugars faster, so keep an eye on cooking times when using this ingredient.</p>  

<h3>Storing golden syrup for air fryer cooking</h3>  
<p>To measure 50g golden syrup to ounces accurately, ensure your syrup isn’t crystallised. Store it in an airtight container at room temperature and warm slightly if thickened. Golden syrup keeps indefinitely but is easiest to work with when at a pourable consistency. If your 50g measurement seems off, check your syrup hasn’t dried out or absorbed moisture, which affects weight.</p>

This guide will help you convert 335 ml of vegetable oil to cups accurately, so your recipes turn out just right every time.</p>  

<h2>Understanding the Conversion</h2>

For 335 ml of vegetable oil, this means you'll get different measurements depending on where you are. If you're using an air fryer, precision matters—too much oil can make food soggy, while too little can dry it out.</p>  
<p>For US measurements, 335 ml of vegetable oil is roughly 1.42 cups. In the UK, it's about 1.18 cups. Always double-check your recipe's origin to ensure you're using the right conversion.

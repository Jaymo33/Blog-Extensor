<p>100 grams of yogurt is roughly equivalent to 0.42 cups (just under half a cup). This measurement applies to standard plain yogurt with average thickness - though factors like brand, fat content, and temperature can cause slight variations. Whether you're converting grams to cups for an air fryer recipe or adjusting portion sizes, knowing this conversion ensures consistent results every time.</p>

<h2>Understanding Yogurt Measurements</h2>
<p>When working with yogurt in recipes - especially for air fryer dishes like marinades, dips, or baked goods - precision matters. Unlike liquids that pour evenly, yogurt's thickness means 100 grams won't perfectly fill a cup measure. The most accurate method is using scales, but when you only have cups, our conversion helps bridge the gap. For popular air fryer recipes like tandoori chicken or yogurt-marinated kebabs, getting the yogurt quantity right affects both texture and flavour.</p>
<p>At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we recommend this conversion for most standard recipes. However, if you're working with Greek yogurt (which is thicker), you'll need slightly less - about 0.38 cups per 100 grams. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> covers these variations for foolproof cooking.</p>

<h3>Why 100 Grams of Yogurt Matters in Air Frying</h3>
<p>Yogurt plays multiple roles in air fryer cooking - as a marinade base, baking ingredient, or sauce component. When a recipe specifies 100 grams, it's usually balancing acidity, moisture, and binding properties. Too little yogurt in your marinade might dry out chicken breasts, while too much could make coatings soggy. This precise measurement ensures your <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes/chicken>air fryer chicken recipes</a> turn out perfectly every time.</p>

<h2>Converting 100 Grams of Yogurt to Cups Worldwide</h2>
<p>Measurement standards vary globally - a US cup (240ml) differs slightly from a UK metric cup (250ml). For 100 grams of yogurt: In the US, it's approximately 0.42 cups, while in the UK, it's about 0.4 cups. These small differences rarely impact most air fryer recipes, but for baking (like yogurt cakes), using weight measurements eliminates guesswork.</p>
<p>Our testing shows that major yogurt brands (like Yeo Valley, Müller, or Danone) all fall within this range when measured at room temperature. Chilled yogurt may appear denser but weighs the same. For those adapting American recipes, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>conversion guides</a> help navigate these nuances effortlessly.</p>

<h3>Measuring Without Scales</h3>
<p>No kitchen scales? Here's how to measure 100 grams of yogurt using cups: Spoon yogurt into a liquid measuring cup until it reaches just below the ½ cup mark (leaving a 1cm gap). Level off with a knife without packing it down. This method works for most recipes on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>our recipe hub</a>, from yogurt-based dips to marinades.</p>

<h2>Yogurt Types and Their Conversions</h2>
<p>Not all yogurts measure equally per 100 grams. Standard plain yogurt (like supermarket own brands) fits our 0.42 cup conversion. Greek yogurt, being thicker, requires about 0.38 cups for the same weight. Meanwhile, drinking yogurts or kefir (thinner consistency) may measure closer to 0.45 cups per 100 grams.</p>
<p>When preparing air fryer dishes like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes/dessert>yogurt-based desserts</a> or marinades, always check which type your recipe specifies. Our cleaning guide at <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>also shows how to handle yogurt spills</a> - its acidity can affect appliance surfaces if left untreated.</p>

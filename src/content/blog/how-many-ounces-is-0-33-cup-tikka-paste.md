<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on even heat distribution, so ingredient proportions can make or break a dish. Too much tikka paste might overpower the dish, while too little could leave it bland. Measuring 0.33 cup of tikka paste in ounces ensures consistency, especially when scaling recipes. If you're new to air frying, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a> offers plenty of inspiration with precise measurements.</p>  
<p>Many UK cooks prefer weighing ingredients like tikka paste for accuracy. Cups can vary in size, but ounces provide a standardised measurement.

<h3>How to measure 0.33 cup of tikka paste without scales</h3>  
<p>If you don't have kitchen scales, you can still measure 0.33 cup of tikka paste accurately. Use a standard UK measuring cup and fill it one-third full, ensuring the paste is level with the rim. Alternatively, 0.33 cup equals roughly 5 tablespoons plus 1 teaspoon, which converts to about 2.64 ounces. For sticky pastes, lightly greasing the spoon helps release the full amount.</p>

<h2>Converting other tikka paste quantities to ounces</h2>  
<p>Once you know 0.33 cup of tikka paste is 2.64 ounces, you can easily scale recipes up or down. For example, 0.5 cup would be roughly 4 ounces, while 0.25 cup would be about 2 ounces.

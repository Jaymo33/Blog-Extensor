<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer baking</h2>
<p>Baking soda is a leavening agent, and even small deviations can impact your recipe. Too much can leave a bitter taste, while too little may result in dense, flat baked goods. In an air fryer, where heat distribution is rapid, precision is even more critical. For perfect air fryer cakes or cookies, always measure your baking soda correctly.

<p>Using a digital scale is the most accurate way to measure baking soda. Scooping directly from the container can lead to packed or uneven tablespoons. For UK bakers, 1 tbsp of baking soda equals 14 grams, a standard measurement across recipes. If you’re adapting a recipe from cups to grams, this conversion is a lifesaver.

<h3>How to measure baking soda without a scale</h3>
<p>If you don’t have a scale, use a flat-edged knife to level off your tablespoon. Avoid tapping or packing the baking soda, as this can add extra grams. For reference, 1 tbsp of baking soda is roughly the size of a large grape. This method isn’t as precise as weighing but works in a pinch. For foolproof results, consider investing in a kitchen scale.</p>

<h2>Common baking soda uses in air fryer recipes</h2>
<p>Baking soda isn’t just for cakes—it’s a versatile ingredient in air fryer cooking. It helps crisp up fried chicken, lighten batter for tempura, and even clean your air fryer basket. A pinch can also neutralise odours, making it handy for fish or spicy dishes. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner guide</a> for more tips.</p>

<p>For savoury dishes like air fryer buffalo wings, a small amount of baking soda in the dry rub promotes browning. In desserts, it reacts with acids like yogurt or lemon juice to create lift. Remember, 1 tbsp equals 14 grams, so adjust accordingly. For more savoury ideas, browse our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipes</a>.</p>

<h3>Storing baking soda for optimal freshness</h3>
<p>Keep baking soda in an airtight container away from moisture and strong odours. Over time, it can lose potency, so test it by mixing with vinegar—if it fizzes vigorously, it’s still active. Most boxes last about 6 months once opened. For consistent results in your air fryer recipes, fresher is always better.</p>

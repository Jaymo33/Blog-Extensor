<p>125g of self-raising flour equals approximately 4.41 ounces. This conversion is essential for anyone using UK recipes or working with air fryer baking, where precision matters. Whether you're making cakes, muffins, or bread in your air fryer, knowing the exact weight ensures consistent results every time.</p>

<h2>Why accurate flour measurements matter</h2>
<p>Baking is a science, and even small deviations in flour weight can affect texture and rise. Self-raising flour contains baking powder, so getting the amount right is crucial. Too much flour can make your air fryer cakes dense, while too little may cause them to collapse. For perfect bakes, always measure by weight rather than volume.</p>
<p>At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we recommend using digital scales for the most accurate results. Many of our popular <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer cake recipes</a> specify weights precisely because it eliminates guesswork. This is particularly important when converting between metric and imperial measurements.</p>

<h2>How to convert 125g to ounces</h2>
<p>The conversion factor between grams and ounces is 1g = 0.035274 oz. To find out how many ounces are in 125g of self-raising flour, simply multiply 125 by 0.035274. This gives you 4.40925 ounces, which we typically round to 4.41 oz for practical use.</p>
<p>If you don't have scales handy, you can use our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for quick reference. Remember that self-raising flour weighs slightly less than plain flour per cup due to the added raising agents, so volume measurements can be tricky.</p>

<h3>Measuring without scales</h3>
<p>While weighing is best, if you must use cups, 125g of self-raising flour is roughly 1 cup (using the scoop-and-level method). However, this can vary by up to 20% depending on how you fill the cup. For air fryer baking where space is limited and heat distribution matters, we strongly recommend sticking to weight measurements.</p>

<h2>Common uses for 125g self-raising flour</h2>
<p>This quantity is perfect for small-batch air fryer baking. You'll often see 125g of self-raising flour in recipes for: individual mug cakes, 4-6 small scones, or a single-serving sponge cake. It's also the right amount for coating chicken or fish before air frying.</p>
<p>Many of our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>air fryer cake recipes</a> use this measurement as a base. The limited capacity of most air fryers means smaller quantities work best, and 125g provides just enough for perfect personal portions without waste.</p>

<h3>Storing self-raising flour</h3>
<p>Keep your self-raising flour in an airtight container to maintain its raising power. The baking powder can lose effectiveness over time, especially in humid conditions. For best results in your air fryer bakes, use flour within 3 months of opening and store away from strong odours.</p>

<h2>Conversion tips for air fryer users</h2>
<p>When adapting conventional oven recipes for your air fryer, you'll often need to reduce quantities. The 125g measurement is ideal because it's easy to scale down from standard recipes that might call for 250g. Simply halve the ingredients for perfect air fryer portions.</p>
<p>Remember that air fryers cook faster than conventional ovens, so check our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a> for timing adjustments too. The combination of precise measurements and adapted cooking times will give you bakery-quality results from your air fryer.</p>

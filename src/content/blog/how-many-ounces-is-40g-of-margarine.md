<p>40g of margarine equals approximately 1.41 ounces. Whether you’re baking in your air fryer or prepping ingredients, knowing this conversion ensures accuracy in your recipes. Many UK cooks rely on grams, but some older recipes or international guides use ounces, making conversions essential. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we simplify these measurements so you can focus on cooking.</p>  

<h2>Why converting 40g of margarine to ounces matters</h2>  
<p>Air fryer recipes often require precise measurements for consistent results. Margarine, a common baking ingredient, can affect texture and moisture if measured incorrectly. Converting 40g of margarine to ounces (1.41 oz) helps avoid dense cakes or dry cookies. If you’re using a recipe from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>our collection</a>, double-check whether it lists grams or ounces to prevent mistakes.</p>  

<p>For those without a digital scale, visualising 40g of margarine as roughly 1.41 ounces can be helpful. A standard UK tablespoon holds about 14g (0.5 oz), so 40g is just under three tablespoons. Keep in mind that margarine density can vary slightly by brand, so weighing is always best for accuracy.</p>  

<h3>Tools for converting 40g margarine to ounces</h3>

Too little margarine can lead to dry textures, while too much may cause greasiness.

Another pitfall is confusing margarine with butter—while their weights are similar, their water content differs, affecting recipes. Always check whether your air fryer recipe specifies margarine or butter for the 40g measurement.</p>

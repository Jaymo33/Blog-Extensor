<p>3 tablespoons (tbsp) of tomato ketchup weigh approximately 45 grams (g). This measurement is essential for air fryer recipes where precision matters, ensuring your dishes turn out perfectly every time. Whether you're making glazed meats, saucy wings, or even ketchup-infused snacks, knowing this conversion helps streamline your cooking process.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on even heat distribution, and using the right amount of ingredients ensures consistent results. Too much ketchup can make food soggy, while too little might leave it dry. For example, if you're making <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer chicken wings</a>, 3 tbsp (45g) of ketchup is ideal for a balanced glaze.

<p>Many UK recipes use grams for accuracy, especially in baking or marinades. If you're adapting a recipe from cups or tablespoons to grams, this conversion ensures you stay on track. Plus, measuring by weight eliminates guesswork, making it easier to replicate successful dishes.</p>  

<h2>How to measure 3 tbsp of tomato ketchup without scales</h2>  
<p>If you don’t have a kitchen scale, use a standard UK tablespoon (15ml) to measure your ketchup. Fill it level for accuracy—no heaping! Three level tablespoons will give you roughly 45g. For sticky ingredients like ketchup, lightly greasing the spoon helps it slide off cleanly.</p>  

<p>Another trick is to use a squeezy bottle with measurement markings. Brands like Heinz often have labels showing grams per serving, which can be handy. If you're prepping ahead for <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/meal-prep>meal prep</a>, weighing ketchup ensures uniformity across batches.</p>  

<h3>Does ketchup brand affect the weight?</h3>  
<p>Most major brands, such as Heinz or Hellmann’s, have similar densities, so 3 tbsp will still hover around 45g. However, thicker artisanal ketchups or reduced-sugar versions might weigh slightly more due to added ingredients. When in doubt, check the label or do a quick test weigh.</p>  

<h2>Using ketchup in air fryer recipes</h2>  
<p>Tomato ketchup isn’t just for dipping—it’s a versatile ingredient in air fryer cooking. Mix 3 tbsp (45g) with honey and soy sauce for a sticky glaze on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>air fryer chicken</a>, or blend it into meatball mixtures for extra moisture. Just remember to apply sauces toward the end of cooking to prevent burning.</p>

<h3>Storing leftover ketchup</h3>  
<p>Once opened, store ketchup in the fridge to maintain freshness. If you’ve measured out 3 tbsp (45g) and have leftovers, transfer them to an airtight container. Proper storage prevents contamination and preserves flavour for your next air fryer adventure.</p>

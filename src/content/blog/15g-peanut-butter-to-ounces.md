<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>

A digital kitchen scale is your best friend here, especially for sticky ingredients like peanut butter.

This is why converting 15g of peanut butter to ounces (0.53 oz) is so useful. It’s a common measurement in many recipes, especially those for air fryer cookies or sauces. If you’re working with larger quantities, simply multiply the conversion accordingly.</p>

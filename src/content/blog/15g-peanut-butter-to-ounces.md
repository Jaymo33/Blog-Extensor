<p>15g of peanut butter equals approximately 0.53 ounces. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements can make all the difference. Whether you’re whipping up a batch of peanut butter cookies or adding a nutty twist to your air-fried chicken, knowing the exact weight ensures perfect results every time. For more air fryer conversions, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on even cooking, and incorrect ingredient quantities can throw off texture and taste. Peanut butter, in particular, can vary in density, so weighing it ensures consistency. A digital kitchen scale is your best friend here, especially for sticky ingredients like peanut butter. If you’re new to air frying, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> for inspiration. From desserts to savoury dishes, precise measurements help you nail every recipe.</p>  

<p>For example, adding too much peanut butter to a marinade can make it overly thick, while too little might leave your dish lacking flavour. This is why converting 15g of peanut butter to ounces (0.53 oz) is so useful. It’s a common measurement in many recipes, especially those for air fryer cookies or sauces. If you’re working with larger quantities, simply multiply the conversion accordingly.</p>  

<h3>How to measure peanut butter without a scale</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a scale, you can use tablespoons to approximate 15g of peanut butter. One level tablespoon is roughly 15g or 0.53 ounces. However, this method isn’t as precise, especially since peanut butter can settle or vary in density. For best results, invest in a digital scale—it’s a game-changer for air fryer cooking. Need cleaning tips for sticky peanut butter messes? Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner guide</a> has you covered.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for 15g of peanut butter in air fryer recipes</h2>  
<p>15g of peanut butter is a versatile amount, perfect for adding richness to sauces, glazes, or baked goods. Try it in air-fried peanut butter cookies, where precision ensures the perfect chewiness. You can also mix it into a marinade for chicken or tofu—just check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipes</a> for ideas. Even a small amount can elevate your dish, whether you’re making a peanut drizzle for desserts or a satay-style dip.</p>  

<p>Another great use is in energy bites or protein bars, where 15g of peanut butter binds ingredients without overpowering them. The air fryer can even toast these for extra crunch. Remember, 15g converts to 0.53 ounces, so you can easily adjust recipes from grams to ounces.

<h3>Converting larger quantities of peanut butter</h3>  
<p>If your recipe calls for 30g, 45g, or more, simply double or triple the 15g-to-ounces conversion. For example, 30g of peanut butter equals roughly 1.06 ounces. This scalability makes it easy to adapt recipes for bigger batches or family-sized portions. Whether you’re meal prepping or cooking for a crowd, accurate conversions ensure consistency.

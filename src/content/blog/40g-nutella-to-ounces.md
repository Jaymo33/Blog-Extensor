<p>40g of Nutella equals approximately 1.41 ounces. This conversion is essential for anyone using an air fryer to create delicious desserts or snacks with precise measurements. Whether you’re making Nutella-stuffed pastries or drizzling it over air-fried bananas, knowing the exact weight ensures consistent results. For more handy conversions, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air frying</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on precise cooking times and ingredient quantities to deliver perfect results. Using too much or too little Nutella can affect texture and flavour. For example, 40g of Nutella (1.41 ounces) is ideal for filling four small pastries or coating a batch of air-fried fruit. Consistency is key, especially when following recipes from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>.</p>  

<p>Digital kitchen scales are the best tool for measuring 40g of Nutella accurately. If you don’t have one, tablespoons can work in a pinch—roughly 2.5 tablespoons equal 40g. However, for baking or recipes requiring precision, weighing is always recommended. Explore more tips in our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert category</a>.</p>  

<h3>Converting 40g Nutella to ounces for UK recipes</h3>  
<p>In the UK, many recipes use grams, but some still reference ounces. Converting 40g of Nutella to ounces (1.41 oz) helps bridge the gap. This is particularly useful for air fryer recipes, where even small measurement discrepancies can impact cooking times. For more UK-friendly conversions, visit <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for 40g of Nutella in air frying</h2>  
<p>40g of Nutella is a versatile quantity for air fryer recipes. It’s enough to fill eight mini croissants or drizzle over a batch of air-fried churros. You could also mix it into a batter for Nutella brownies or swirl it into air-fryer mug cakes. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>cake recipes</a> for inspiration.</p>  

<p>Another great use for 40g of Nutella is as a dip for air-fried fruit like bananas or strawberries. The rich, creamy texture pairs perfectly with the crispiness of air-fried treats. Remember, keeping your air fryer clean ensures even cooking—learn how with our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning guide</a>.</p>  

<h3>Tips for measuring Nutella without scales</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have scales, use a tablespoon to measure 40g of Nutella. One heaped tablespoon holds about 15–20g, so you’ll need roughly 2.5 tablespoons for 40g. For sticky ingredients like Nutella, lightly greasing the spoon helps it slide off easily. This method works well for quick recipes but isn’t as precise as weighing.</p>

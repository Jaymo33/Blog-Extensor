<p>385 ml of almond milk equals approximately 1.63 cups in the US measurement system and 1.52 cups in the UK measurement system. Whether you're baking a cake or whipping up a creamy sauce, knowing this conversion ensures your recipes turn out perfectly. Almond milk is a popular dairy-free alternative, and accurate measurements are key to achieving the right consistency in your dishes. If you're using an air fryer for recipes like vegan muffins or dairy-free casseroles, precise liquid measurements matter even more. Visit <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> for more air fryer-friendly recipes that use almond milk.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Using the correct amount of almond milk can make or break your recipe. Too much liquid can lead to soggy textures, while too little might dry out your dish. For air fryer cooking, where heat distribution is rapid, exact measurements ensure even cooking. Almond milk is often used in vegan baking, and slight deviations can affect rising agents like baking powder. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for other common measurement swaps.</p>  

<p>Many UK and US recipes differ in cup sizes, which can cause confusion. The US cup is 240 ml, while the UK cup is 250 ml. This small difference adds up when scaling recipes. If you're adapting a recipe from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>our collection</a>, always double-check which measurement system it uses. For air fryer recipes, consistency is crucial—especially when working with batters or sauces.</p>  

<h3>Converting 385 ml of Almond Milk for Baking</h3>  
<p>When baking, 385 ml of almond milk is often used in cakes, pancakes, or custards. In the US, this translates to roughly 1 and 2/3 cups, while in the UK, it's just over 1 and 1/2 cups. For best results, use a measuring jug with both metric and imperial markings. If your recipe calls for 385 ml of almond milk but you only have cups, this conversion ensures accuracy. Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert recipes</a> for almond milk-based treats perfect for your air fryer.</p>  

<h3>Using 385 ml of Almond Milk in Savory Dishes</h3>  
<p>Almond milk works well in creamy pasta sauces, soups, and mashed potatoes. For these dishes, 385 ml (about 1.6 US cups) provides enough liquid without overpowering flavours. In an air fryer, sauces with almond milk reduce faster due to concentrated heat, so measure carefully. If you're meal prepping, check our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/meal-prep>meal prep section</a> for ideas using this measurement.</p>  

<h2>Tips for Measuring Almond Milk</h2>  
<p>Always shake almond milk before measuring, as separation can occur. For 385 ml, use a clear liquid measuring cup at eye level for precision. If substituting almond milk for dairy, note that it's thinner—adjust thickeners like flour if needed. For air fryer recipes, slightly less liquid may be required due to faster evaporation. Keep your air fryer in top shape with our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning guide</a> to ensure consistent cooking results.</p>  

<p>For frothing or steaming almond milk, 385 ml is a common quantity for two drinks. The air fryer can even heat almond milk gently for lattes—just monitor closely to avoid boiling. Whether you're baking, cooking, or brewing, knowing that 385 ml equals roughly 1.6 cups (US) simplifies your process. Bookmark this conversion for your next dairy-free culinary adventure!</p>

<p>3 tablespoons of brown sugar weigh approximately 36 grams. This conversion is essential for precise baking and cooking, especially when using an air fryer where measurements can make or break a recipe. Whether you’re whipping up cookies or glazing meats, knowing the exact weight ensures consistent results every time.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on precise ingredient ratios to achieve the perfect texture and flavour. Too much or too little sugar can affect browning, caramelisation, and even cooking times. For example, if you’re making <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer cookies</a>, 3 tbsp of brown sugar (36g) adds the right sweetness without overpowering the dough. Accurate measurements also help when scaling recipes up or down.</p>  

<p>Many air fryer recipes, like those on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, list ingredients by weight for reliability. If you’re converting from volume (tablespoons) to grams, a kitchen scale is your best friend. This is especially useful for sticky ingredients like brown sugar, which can compact unevenly in a measuring spoon.</p>  

<h3>How to measure brown sugar correctly</h3>  
<p>To get an accurate 36 grams from 3 tbsp of brown sugar, lightly pack the sugar into the spoon without pressing too hard. Overpacking can add extra weight, while underpacking may leave your recipe too dry. For consistent results, consider using a <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a> to double-check other common measurements.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for 3 tbsp of brown sugar in air fryer recipes</h2>  
<p>This amount of brown sugar is perfect for glazes, marinades, or small-batch desserts. For instance, a glaze for <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>air fryer chicken wings</a> might combine 3 tbsp brown sugar (36g) with soy sauce and garlic. It’s also ideal for topping <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>air fryer desserts</a> like baked apples or crumbles.</p>  

<p>If you’re meal prepping, knowing that 3 tbsp equals 36 grams helps streamline your process. Pre-measuring ingredients ensures your air fryer dishes turn out perfectly every time, whether you’re cooking for one or a family.

<h3>Converting other sugar measurements</h3>  
<p>If your recipe calls for a different amount of brown sugar, here’s a quick reference: 1 tbsp equals 12 grams, and 1/4 cup (4 tbsp) equals 48 grams. These conversions are handy when adapting recipes for your air fryer, ensuring you never miss the mark on sweetness or texture.</p>

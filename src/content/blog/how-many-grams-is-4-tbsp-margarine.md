<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air frying</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on precise ingredient ratios to achieve crispy, evenly cooked dishes. Too much or too little margarine can affect browning and moisture levels. For example, using 56 grams (4 tbsp) of margarine in a cake batter ensures the right richness without making it greasy. If you’re adapting recipes from volume to weight, always double-check conversions to avoid mishaps. Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> for perfectly measured dishes.</p>  

<p>Margarine’s density can vary slightly by brand, but 4 tbsp generally weighs 56 grams in the UK. For best results, use a kitchen scale rather than relying solely on spoon measurements. This is particularly important for air fryer recipes, where even small deviations can alter cooking times. Need cleaning tips for your air fryer after cooking with margarine?

<h3>How to measure margarine without a scale</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a scale, use the displacement method: fill a measuring jug with water, add margarine until the water rises by 56 grams (roughly 4 tbsp). This hack works for sticky ingredients like margarine and ensures accuracy.

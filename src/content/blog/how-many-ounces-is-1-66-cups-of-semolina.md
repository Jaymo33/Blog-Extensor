<p>1.66 cups of semolina equals approximately 7.5 ounces (oz). This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precision ensures perfect results every time. Whether you're making crispy semolina-coated chicken or baking a semolina cake, knowing the exact weight helps avoid kitchen mishaps.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on even cooking, and incorrect measurements can lead to uneven textures or undercooked food. Semolina, a coarse wheat flour, is often used for coating or baking, so getting the right amount ensures crispiness without excess. For example, if a recipe calls for 1.66 cups of semolina, using 7.5 oz guarantees consistency. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more handy tips.</p>  

<p>Many UK cooks prefer weighing ingredients like semolina for accuracy. Cups can vary based on how you scoop, but ounces provide a reliable standard. This is especially useful for air fryer recipes, where even small deviations affect cooking times. Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>semolina-based recipes</a> to put this knowledge to work.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure Semolina Correctly</h3>  
<p>For the most accurate 1.66 cups-to-ounces conversion, use a kitchen scale. Spoon semolina into a measuring cup without packing it down, then level it off. This method prevents over-measuring, which could make coatings too thick or batters too dense. If you’re adapting a recipe from volume to weight, 1.66 cups of semolina will always be close to 7.5 oz.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for Semolina in Air Fryers</h2>  
<p>Semolina adds crunch to air-fried foods like chicken tenders or fish fillets. A 1.66-cup portion (7.5 oz) is ideal for coating 4–6 servings. It’s also great for dusting pizza dough or making air-fried desserts like semolina halva. For inspiration, browse our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipes</a> featuring semolina crusts.</p>  

<p>Beyond coatings, semolina works in air fryer baking. Mix 1.66 cups (7.5 oz) with yogurt and spices for a quick flatbread. Since air fryers cook faster than ovens, precise measurements prevent dryness. After cooking, use our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner</a> to remove any semolina residue easily.</p>  

<h3>Converting Other Semolina Amounts</h3>  
<p>If your recipe needs more or less than 1.66 cups, here’s a quick guide: 1 cup of semolina ≈ 4.5 oz, so 2 cups would be 9 oz. For smaller amounts, 0.5 cup is about 2.25 oz.

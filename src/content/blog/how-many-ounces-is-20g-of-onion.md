<p>20g of onion equals approximately 0.7 ounces. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes, especially when precision matters for perfect results. Whether you're following a recipe from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> or creating your own, knowing how to convert grams to ounces ensures consistency.</p>  

<h2>Why Convert 20g of Onion to Ounces?</h2>  
<p>Many UK recipes use grams, while others rely on ounces, making conversions necessary. If you're using an air fryer, accurate measurements can affect cooking times and textures. For example, 20g of onion (0.7 oz) might be used in a stir-fry or as a topping for air-fried dishes like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>air fryer chicken</a>.</p>  

<p>Converting 20g of onion to ounces also helps when scaling recipes. If a dish calls for 40g of onion, you’ll know that’s roughly 1.4 ounces. This precision ensures your air fryer meals turn out just right every time. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more handy measurements.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure 20g of Onion Accurately</h3>  
<p>Using a digital kitchen scale is the best way to measure 20g of onion. Simply place your bowl on the scale, tare it to zero, then add chopped onion until you hit 20g. If you don’t have a scale, roughly 0.7 ounces of onion is about two tablespoons of finely chopped onion.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for 20g of Onion in Air Fryer Recipes</h2>  
<p>20g of onion is a small but impactful amount, often used to add flavour without overpowering a dish. It’s perfect for air fryer recipes like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>roasted vegetables</a> or as a base for sauces. Since air fryers cook quickly, finely chopped onion ensures even cooking.</p>  

<p>You might also use 20g of onion in marinades or rubs for meats. For example, mixing it with spices for <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> like kebabs or burgers. The key is distributing the onion evenly so it caramelises nicely in the air fryer.</p>  

<h3>Tips for Storing Leftover Onion</h3>  
<p>If you only need 20g of onion for a recipe, store the rest properly to avoid waste. Wrap the remaining onion tightly in cling film or place it in an airtight container in the fridge. It’ll stay fresh for up to three days, ready for your next air fryer creation.</p>

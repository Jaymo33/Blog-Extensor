<p>1 cup of shredded coconut weighs approximately 3 ounces (85 grams). This measurement is key for air fryer recipes, where precision ensures even cooking and perfect texture. Whether you're making coconut-crusted shrimp or a tropical dessert, knowing the exact weight helps avoid overpacking or underfilling your air fryer basket.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air frying</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on hot air circulation, so ingredient density directly affects cooking times. Too much shredded coconut can block airflow, while too little may burn quickly. For consistent results, always measure by weight when possible. If you don’t have scales, fluff the coconut lightly before scooping it into a measuring cup.</p>  
<p>Many <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> call for shredded coconut as a coating or topping. From crispy chicken tenders to coconut shrimp, the right amount ensures a golden finish without sogginess. Check our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a> for other common ingredients to streamline your cooking process.</p>  

<h3>Converting cups to ounces for shredded coconut</h3>  
<p>While 1 cup of shredded coconut equals roughly 3 ounces, brands vary slightly. Packed coconut may weigh up to 3.5 ounces, so adjust if your recipe specifies "lightly packed" or "firmly packed." For UK bakers, note that 1 UK cup (284ml) holds slightly more than a US cup (240ml), but the ounce equivalent remains similar.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for shredded coconut in air fryers</h2>  
<p>Shredded coconut adds crunch and sweetness to both savoury and sweet dishes. Try it in air-fried banana fritters or as a coating for tofu nuggets. Its low moisture content makes it ideal for air frying, as it crisps beautifully without oil overload. Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert category</a> for coconut-heavy treats like macaroons or pineapple upside-down cake.</p>  
<p>When storing shredded coconut, keep it airtight to maintain freshness. Stale coconut won’t crisp properly in the air fryer. If your recipe calls for toasted coconut, air fry it at 160°C for 2-3 minutes, shaking halfway—no need for extra oil.</p>  

<h3>Tips for measuring sticky ingredients</h3>  
<p>Shredded coconut can clump, especially sweetened varieties. To measure accurately, break up clumps with a fork before scooping. For sticky coatings, mix coconut with breadcrumbs or panko to improve texture and prevent burning. Always preheat your air fryer to ensure even cooking from the start.</p>

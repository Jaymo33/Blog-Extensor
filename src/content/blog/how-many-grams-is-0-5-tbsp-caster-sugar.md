<p>0.5 tbsp of caster sugar equals approximately 6.25 grams in UK measurements. This conversion is essential for accurate baking, especially when using an air fryer where precision matters. Whether you're whipping up cakes, cookies, or desserts, knowing the exact weight ensures perfect results every time.</p>

<h2>Why accurate sugar measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers cook food faster and more evenly than conventional ovens, so precise measurements are crucial. Too much sugar can cause over-browning or burning, while too little may affect texture and sweetness. For recipes like air fryer cakes or cookies, 0.5 tbsp of caster sugar (6.25g) is often used for small batches or delicate balances.</p>  
<p>At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we recommend using digital scales for the most accurate results. Many of our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer dessert recipes</a> call for small sugar quantities where this conversion becomes particularly useful.</p>

<h2>How to measure 0.5 tbsp of caster sugar without scales</h2>  
<p>If you don't have digital scales, you can still measure 0.5 tbsp of caster sugar accurately. Fill a tablespoon halfway with caster sugar, then level it off with a straight edge. The density of caster sugar means 0.5 tbsp will consistently weigh around 6.25 grams.</p>  
<p>For best results in your air fryer, consider our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a> which includes other common baking measurements. This is especially handy when adapting traditional recipes for air fryer use.</p>

<h3>The difference between caster sugar and granulated sugar</h3>  
<p>Caster sugar has finer crystals than regular granulated sugar, which affects both volume and weight measurements. While 0.5 tbsp of caster sugar weighs 6.25g, granulated sugar would be slightly heavier at about 7g for the same volume. Always check which type your air fryer recipe specifies.</p>

<h2>Common uses for 0.5 tbsp caster sugar in air fryer recipes</h2>  
<p>This small quantity of sugar appears in many air fryer recipes. It might be used to sweeten a single portion of <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>air fryer desserts</a>, create a light glaze, or balance flavours in savoury dishes. The precision matters because air fryers intensify flavours through rapid air circulation.</p>  
<p>When making air fryer meringues or souffl√©s, even small sugar variations can affect texture. That's why knowing 0.5 tbsp equals 6.25g helps achieve professional results at home. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning guide</a> also shows how to remove any sugar residues after cooking.</p>

<h3>Converting other sugar quantities in air fryer recipes</h3>  
<p>Once you know 0.5 tbsp equals 6.25g, you can easily scale up or down. For example, 1 tbsp would be 12.5g, while 0.25 tbsp would be about 3.125g. These conversions are invaluable when adjusting recipe quantities for different air fryer sizes or serving numbers.</p>

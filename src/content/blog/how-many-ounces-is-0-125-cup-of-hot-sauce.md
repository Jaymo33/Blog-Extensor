<h2>How to Measure 0.125 Cup of Hot Sauce</h2>
<p>Measuring 0.125 cup of hot sauce (1 ounce) can be tricky without the right tools. A liquid measuring cup with clear markings is ideal, but if you don’t have one, a tablespoon can work in a pinch. Since 0.125 cup equals 2 tablespoons, you can use this as a quick alternative.</p>

<h3>Tips for Using Hot Sauce in Air Fryer Recipes</h3>
<p>When adding 0.125 cup of hot sauce to air fryer dishes, consider the sauce's thickness. Thicker sauces may need to be thinned slightly with water or oil to ensure even coating.

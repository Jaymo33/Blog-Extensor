<p>0.75 cup of almonds equals approximately 3.5 ounces (or 100 grams). This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements can make or break your dish. Whether you’re making almond-crusted chicken or a batch of granola, knowing the exact weight ensures consistency and perfect results every time.</p>

<h2>Why accurate almond measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>When using an air fryer, precise measurements are crucial because the cooking process is faster and more intense than conventional methods. Too many almonds can overcrowd the basket, leading to uneven cooking, while too few might leave your dish lacking texture. For recipes like almond-crusted fish or roasted almonds, 0.75 cup (3.5 ounces) is a common measurement that balances flavour and crunch.</p>

<h2>How to measure 0.75 cup of almonds accurately</h2>  
<p>Measuring almonds by volume can be tricky because their size and shape vary. For the most accurate results, use a kitchen scale to weigh out 3.5 ounces (100 grams). If you don’t have a scale, lightly pack the almonds into a measuring cup without crushing them. Avoid heaping the cup, as this can lead to an excess of almonds and throw off your recipe.</p>

Remember, air fryers work best with precise measurements, so always double-check your conversions.</p>

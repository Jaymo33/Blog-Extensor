By converting 1 cup of ginger paste to ounces, you can easily adapt recipes to suit your taste. This is especially handy when following international recipes that use different measurement systems.</p>  

<h3>How to measure ginger paste correctly</h3>  
<p>For the most accurate results, use a kitchen scale to weigh your ginger paste. If you don't have one, spoon the paste into a measuring cup and level it off. Remember that ginger paste can vary in density depending on how it's prepared, so weighing is always best. This method ensures your <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken dishes</a> or vegetable stir-fries have the perfect ginger kick.</p>

<p>Ginger paste works wonders in air fryer marinades, adding depth to meats and vegetables. A precise 8.5-ounce measure of ginger paste can transform a simple dish into something extraordinary. Try it in <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable recipes</a> for a zesty twist or in marinades for proteins like chicken or tofu. The possibilities are endless when you know exactly how much to use.</p>

If you use ginger paste frequently, consider making larger batches and freezing portions. This way, you'll always have the right amount on hand for your air fryer creations.</p>

<p>75 grams of self-raising flour equals approximately 0.6 cups (or just over half a cup). This conversion is essential for bakers who prefer using cups instead of scales, especially when preparing air fryer recipes. Whether you're making fluffy cakes or crispy batters, getting the measurement right ensures perfect results every time.</p>

<h2>Understanding Self-Raising Flour Measurements</h2>  
<p>Self-raising flour is a staple in British baking, combining plain flour with a raising agent like baking powder. When converting grams to cups, it's important to note that the density of self-raising flour can vary slightly. For 75 grams, the standard conversion is roughly 0.6 cups, but sifting the flour can affect the volume. Always spoon the flour into the cup lightly for the most accurate measurement.</p>  
<p>If you're using an air fryer for baking, precise measurements are even more critical. Too much flour can make cakes dense, while too little may cause them to collapse. For more air fryer-friendly recipes, explore <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes</a> to find inspiration.</p>  

<h2>Why Accuracy Matters in Baking</h2>  
<p>Baking is a science, and small measurement discrepancies can lead to big differences in texture and taste. Using 75 grams of self-raising flour instead of eyeballing it ensures consistency. This is especially true for air fryer recipes, where even cooking relies on balanced ingredients.</p>  
<p>For those who frequently bake, a digital scale is the best tool for accuracy. However, if you're using cups, remember that 75 grams of self-raising flour is just over half a cup. For a full conversion chart, visit <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart</a>.</p>  

<h3>Converting 75 Grams of Self-Raising Flour for Different Recipes</h3>  
<p>Whether you're making scones, muffins, or air fryer cakes, 75 grams of self-raising flour is a common measurement. If your recipe calls for this amount, lightly spoon the flour into a measuring cup and level it off. Avoid packing the flour down, as this can lead to using more than needed.</p>  

<h3>Common Mistakes When Measuring Flour</h3>  
<p>One of the biggest mistakes is scooping flour directly from the bag with a cup, which compresses it and adds extra grams. Instead, fluff the flour first, then spoon it into the cup. For 75 grams of self-raising flour, this method ensures you get the right amount without overpacking.</p>  

<h2>Using 75 Grams of Self-Raising Flour in Air Fryer Recipes</h2>  
<p>Air fryers are fantastic for baking small batches of cakes or bread. When a recipe calls for 75 grams of self-raising flour, measure it carefully to avoid dense or uneven results. For more tips on air fryer baking, check out <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes</a>.</p>  
<p>Cleaning your air fryer after baking is also crucial. Flour residue can build up, so use <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner</a> to keep it in top condition.</p>  

<h3>Adjusting Recipes for Different Flours</h3>  
<p>If you're substituting plain flour for self-raising, remember to add baking powder. For 75 grams of plain flour, mix in 1 teaspoon of baking powder to mimic self-raising flour. This adjustment ensures your air fryer bakes rise perfectly.</p>

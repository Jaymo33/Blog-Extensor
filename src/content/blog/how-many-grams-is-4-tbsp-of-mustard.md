<p>4 tablespoons (tbsp) of mustard weigh approximately 60 grams (g) in the UK. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements can make or break your dish. Whether you’re preparing a marinade, glaze, or sauce, knowing the exact weight ensures consistency. For more air fryer conversions, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>

<h2>Why accurate mustard measurements matter in air frying</h2>
<p>Air fryers rely on even cooking, and incorrect ingredient quantities can throw off textures and flavours. Mustard, often used in marinades or coatings, needs precise measurements to avoid overpowering or underwhelming results. A slight variation in weight can affect how your chicken or vegetables turn out. For recipe ideas, browse our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> collection.</p>
<p>Using grams instead of tablespoons eliminates guesswork, especially with thicker mustards like Dijon or whole grain. A digital kitchen scale is your best friend here. If you’re new to air frying, start with our beginner-friendly guides on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>.</p>

<h2>How to measure 4 tbsp of mustard without scales</h2>
<p>If you don’t have scales, use the spoon-and-level method for accuracy. Fill your tablespoon measure to the brim, then level it off with a straight edge. Repeat four times to get roughly 60g. Remember, UK tablespoons differ slightly from US ones, so stick to UK measurements. For more tips, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipe category</a>.</p>

<h3>Types of mustard and their weights</h3>
<p>Yellow mustard weighs about 15g per tbsp, while Dijon or whole grain varieties can be denser at 16-17g per tbsp. Always check your specific type if precision is crucial. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner</a> guide helps maintain your appliance after messy mustard-based recipes.</p>

<h2>Common air fryer recipes using 4 tbsp mustard</h2>
<p>Mustard-glazed salmon, honey-mustard chicken wings, and potato salads often call for this quantity. The 60g measurement ensures balanced flavours without overwhelming other ingredients. Visit <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> for mustard-centric dishes perfect for your air fryer.</p>
<p>Experiment with different mustard types in your air fryer – each brings unique flavours. Just remember our 4 tbsp = 60g rule for consistent results every time.</p>

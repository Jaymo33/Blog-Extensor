<h2>Why accurate mustard measurements matter in air frying</h2>
<p>Air fryers rely on even cooking, and incorrect ingredient quantities can throw off textures and flavours. Mustard, often used in marinades or coatings, needs precise measurements to avoid overpowering or underwhelming results. A slight variation in weight can affect how your chicken or vegetables turn out. For recipe ideas, browse our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> collection.</p>

<p>125g of caster sugar equals approximately 4.41 ounces. This conversion is essential for anyone using air fryer recipes that require precise measurements, especially in baking where accuracy matters. Whether you’re making cakes, cookies, or desserts, knowing how to convert grams to ounces ensures your treats turn out perfectly every time.</p>

<h2>Why accurate sugar measurements matter in air fryer baking</h2>
<p>When baking in an air fryer, even small measurement discrepancies can affect texture and rise. Caster sugar’s fine grains dissolve quickly, making it ideal for air fryer cakes and sponges. A slight over or under-measurement could lead to dense or overly sweet results. That’s why we always recommend using digital scales for the most accurate 125g caster sugar to ounces conversion.</p>
<p>Many British bakers prefer weighing ingredients rather than using volume measurements. This method eliminates inconsistencies caused by how ingredients settle in cups.

<h2>How to measure 125g of caster sugar without scales</h2>
<p>If you don’t have digital scales, you can approximate 125g of caster sugar using volume measurements. This equals roughly ½ cup plus 1 tablespoon of caster sugar. However, we strongly recommend investing in kitchen scales for air fryer baking, as volume measurements can vary significantly depending on how you fill your measuring cup.</p>
<p>For those times when you’re in a pinch, spoon the sugar into your measuring cup rather than scooping it directly from the bag. This prevents packing too much sugar into the cup. Remember that 125g caster sugar in ounces is about 4.41, which might help when using recipes with mixed measurement systems.</p>

<h3>The difference between caster sugar and granulated sugar</h3>
<p>Caster sugar has finer crystals than regular granulated sugar, which affects both measurement and performance in recipes. When converting 125g of caster sugar to ounces, you’re dealing with slightly more sugar by volume than granulated because the finer grains pack more densely. This is particularly important in air fryer baking where precise ratios affect cooking times and textures.</p>

<h2>Converting other common baking measurements</h2>
<p>While 125g caster sugar equals 4.41 ounces, you might need to convert other ingredients for your air fryer recipes. Butter, flour, and liquids all have different conversion rates. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes collection</a> includes measurements in both metric and imperial for your convenience.</p>
<p>When adapting traditional oven recipes for your air fryer, accurate measurements become even more crucial due to the air fryer’s concentrated heat. A slight variation in sugar content can affect browning and caramelization. That’s why knowing that 125 grams of caster sugar equals how many ounces helps maintain recipe integrity.</p>

<h3>Tips for perfect air fryer baking with caster sugar</h3>
<p>Always preheat your air fryer when baking with caster sugar to ensure even cooking. The sugar’s fine texture means it caramelizes quickly in the air fryer’s intense heat. For best results with your 125g caster sugar measurement, reduce the temperature by about 20°C from conventional oven recipes and check for doneness a few minutes early.</p>

<h2>Storing caster sugar for air fryer baking</h2>
<p>Proper storage keeps your caster sugar fresh for all your air fryer creations. Store it in an airtight container in a cool, dry place to prevent clumping. When measuring out your 125g caster sugar to ounces conversion, ensure your sugar is free-flowing for the most accurate measurement. This is especially important for delicate air fryer desserts like soufflés or meringues.</p>

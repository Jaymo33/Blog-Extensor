<p>198 C in a fan oven is equivalent to approximately 175 C with the fan assist. This conversion is crucial for achieving perfect baking results in modern convection ovens and air fryers. The fan circulates hot air more efficiently, allowing you to reduce the temperature while maintaining cooking performance.</p>

<h2>Understanding Fan Oven Conversions</h2>

<h3>Practical Tips for Temperature Accuracy</h3>
<p>Always preheat your fan oven or air fryer when converting 198 C to ensure temperature stability. Use an oven thermometer to verify your appliance's accuracy, as some models may run hotter or cooler than their displays indicate. This is especially important when working with precise baking temperatures.</p>

<h2>Common Uses for 198 C in Fan Ovens</h2>
<p>Many classic British bakes work beautifully at 198 C (175 C fan). Victoria sponge, scones, and shortbread all benefit from this moderate baking temperature. When using your fan oven or air fryer, the reduced temperature prevents over-browning while ensuring thorough cooking. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert recipes</a> showcase how versatile this temperature can be.</p>

<p>Roasting vegetables at 198 C in a fan oven (175 C actual) yields perfectly caramelised results without burning. The circulating air helps create that desirable crispy exterior while keeping interiors tender. This temperature is also ideal for reheating pre-cooked dishes in your air fryer while maintaining texture.</p>

<h3>Adjusting Cooking Times</h3>
<p>When converting 198 C to fan oven settings, remember that cooking times may be 10-15% shorter than conventional oven recipes suggest. Start checking your food a few minutes early, especially when using an air fryer. The compact space and efficient air circulation can accelerate cooking compared to standard ovens.</p>

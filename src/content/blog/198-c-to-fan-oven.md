<p>198 C in a fan oven is equivalent to approximately 175 C with the fan assist. This conversion is crucial for achieving perfect baking results in modern convection ovens and air fryers. The fan circulates hot air more efficiently, allowing you to reduce the temperature while maintaining cooking performance.</p>

<h2>Understanding Fan Oven Conversions</h2>
<p>When converting 198 C to fan oven settings, you'll typically reduce the temperature by 20-25 degrees. This adjustment accounts for the fan's efficient heat distribution. Traditional recipes often specify conventional oven temperatures, so knowing how to convert 198 C to fan oven is essential for modern kitchens. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> makes these adjustments simple for all your cooking needs.</p>

<p>Fan ovens cook food more evenly and often faster than conventional ovens. This means that 198 C in fan oven terms will give you similar results to higher temperatures in traditional ovens. Many air fryer users find that these conversions work beautifully for their countertop appliances too. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a> for perfectly adjusted fan oven and air fryer dishes.</p>

<h3>Why 198 C Matters in Baking</h3>
<p>198 C is a common temperature for many baked goods, from cakes to roasted vegetables. When using a fan oven or air fryer, adjusting this to 175 C ensures your food won't dry out or brown too quickly. The circulating air in fan ovens and air fryers creates an ideal environment for even cooking at slightly lower temperatures.</p>

<h2>Air Fryer Equivalent for 198 C</h2>
<p>Most air fryers operate similarly to fan ovens, so the 198 C to fan oven conversion applies directly. If your recipe calls for 198 C, set your air fryer to 175 C for comparable results. Remember that air fryers are more compact, so cooking times may be slightly shorter than conventional oven recipes suggest.</p>

<p>For those new to air frying, understanding these temperature conversions makes adapting recipes much easier. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>cake recipes</a> section includes specific adjustments for perfect air fryer baking. Keeping your air fryer clean is also crucial for accurate temperature performance - try our recommended <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning products</a>.</p>

<h3>Practical Tips for Temperature Accuracy</h3>
<p>Always preheat your fan oven or air fryer when converting 198 C to ensure temperature stability. Use an oven thermometer to verify your appliance's accuracy, as some models may run hotter or cooler than their displays indicate. This is especially important when working with precise baking temperatures.</p>

<h2>Common Uses for 198 C in Fan Ovens</h2>
<p>Many classic British bakes work beautifully at 198 C (175 C fan). Victoria sponge, scones, and shortbread all benefit from this moderate baking temperature. When using your fan oven or air fryer, the reduced temperature prevents over-browning while ensuring thorough cooking. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert recipes</a> showcase how versatile this temperature can be.</p>

<p>Roasting vegetables at 198 C in a fan oven (175 C actual) yields perfectly caramelised results without burning. The circulating air helps create that desirable crispy exterior while keeping interiors tender. This temperature is also ideal for reheating pre-cooked dishes in your air fryer while maintaining texture.</p>

<h3>Adjusting Cooking Times</h3>
<p>When converting 198 C to fan oven settings, remember that cooking times may be 10-15% shorter than conventional oven recipes suggest. Start checking your food a few minutes early, especially when using an air fryer. The compact space and efficient air circulation can accelerate cooking compared to standard ovens.</p>

<p>2 tablespoons (tbsp) of minced onion weigh approximately 20 grams. This measurement is essential for air fryer recipes where precision ensures even cooking and perfect flavour distribution. Whether you’re making a quick stir-fry or seasoning meats, knowing the exact weight saves time and avoids guesswork. For more air fryer measurement tips, visit <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>our conversion chart</a>.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Using the correct amount of minced onion can make or break your dish. Too little, and your recipe may lack depth; too much, and the flavour can overpower other ingredients. Air fryers circulate hot air, so balanced seasoning is key. For example, if you’re making <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>air fryer chicken</a>, 20 grams of minced onion adds just the right punch without drying out the meat.</p>  

<p>Precision also ensures consistency. If you love a particular recipe, sticking to 20 grams of minced onion guarantees the same delicious results every time. No more wondering why last week’s batch tasted different! Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a> for dishes that rely on accurate measurements.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure Minced Onion Without a Scale</h3>  
<p>Don’t have a kitchen scale? No problem! Pack the minced onion lightly into a tablespoon without pressing down too hard. Two level tablespoons should give you roughly 20 grams. For recipes like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>air-fried vegetables</a>, this method works perfectly.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for 2 Tbsp Minced Onion in Air Fryer Recipes</h2>  
<p>Minced onion is a versatile ingredient. From marinades to coatings, 20 grams (2 tbsp) can elevate your cooking. Try it in homemade burger patties or as a base for air-fried soups. The subtle sweetness of onion pairs well with meats, fish, and even tofu.</p>  

<p>For a crispy twist, mix 20 grams of minced onion with breadcrumbs before coating <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/frozen-foods>frozen foods</a>. The onion caramelises in the air fryer, adding crunch and flavour. Keep your air fryer clean with our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning guide</a> to maintain peak performance.</p>  

<h3>Converting Other Onion Measurements to Grams</h3>  
<p>If a recipe calls for diced or sliced onion instead of minced, the weight varies. Diced onion is denser, so 2 tbsp equals about 25 grams. Always adjust based on the recipe’s requirements for the best results.</p>

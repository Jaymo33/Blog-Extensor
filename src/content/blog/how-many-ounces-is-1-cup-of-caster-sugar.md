<p>1 cup of caster sugar equals approximately 7.05 ounces. This measurement is crucial for baking, especially when using an air fryer where precise ingredient ratios can make or break a recipe. Whether you're whipping up cakes, cookies, or desserts, knowing how many ounces are in 1 cup of caster sugar ensures consistent results every time.</p>

<h2>Why accurate sugar measurements matter</h2>
<p>Baking is a science, and even small deviations in measurements can affect the texture and taste of your treats. Caster sugar, with its fine granules, dissolves quickly, making it ideal for air fryer recipes like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>cakes</a> and <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cookies>cookies</a>. Using the correct weight—7.05 ounces per cup—ensures your batter or dough has the right consistency. Too much sugar can lead to overly sweet or dense results, while too little might leave your bake dry or bland.</p>
<p>For those who love experimenting with air fryer desserts, a digital kitchen scale is a game-changer. It eliminates guesswork and guarantees your 1 cup of caster sugar to ounces conversion is spot on. If you don’t have a scale, spooning the sugar into a measuring cup and leveling it off works too—just avoid packing it down.</p>

<h2>Converting 1 cup of caster sugar to ounces</h2>
<p>Converting 1 cup of caster sugar to ounces is straightforward once you know the standard weight. In the UK, caster sugar weighs around 7.05 ounces per cup, though this can vary slightly based on how the sugar is packed. For air fryer recipes, where even heating is key, precise measurements help achieve evenly cooked results.</p>
<p>If you’re working with a recipe that lists ingredients by weight, this conversion is invaluable. For example, a <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>classic sponge cake</a> might call for 7.05 ounces of caster sugar, which translates neatly to 1 cup. Keeping a <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a> handy can save time and ensure accuracy.</p>

<h3>How to measure caster sugar without a scale</h3>
<p>No scale? No problem. To measure 1 cup of caster sugar in ounces without one, use the spoon-and-level method. Gently spoon the sugar into a measuring cup until it’s overflowing, then level it off with a straight edge. This avoids compacting the sugar, which could lead to using more than the intended 7.05 ounces.</p>

<h2>Common uses for caster sugar in air fryer recipes</h2>
<p>Caster sugar’s fine texture makes it perfect for air fryer baking. It blends seamlessly into batters and doughs, ensuring even sweetness and texture. Popular recipes that use 1 cup of caster sugar (7.05 ounces) include air fryer <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>desserts</a> like meringues, shortbread, and custards.</p>
<p>Because air fryers circulate hot air rapidly, recipes often require slight adjustments compared to traditional ovens. Knowing exactly how many ounces are in 1 cup of caster sugar helps maintain the right balance of ingredients, preventing overbrowning or uneven cooking. For sticky or delicate bakes, consider using <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer liners</a> to simplify cleanup.</p>

<h3>Tips for baking with caster sugar</h3>
<p>For best results, store caster sugar in an airtight container to prevent clumping. If your sugar has hardened, pulse it in a blender to restore its fine texture before measuring. Remember, 1 cup of caster sugar equals 7.05 ounces—keep this in mind for flawless air fryer bakes every time.</p>

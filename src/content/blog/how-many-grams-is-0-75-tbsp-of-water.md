<p>Air fryers rely on rapid hot air circulation, meaning even small variations in moisture can affect cooking times and outcomes. Using 0.75 tbsp of water (11.07g) precisely helps maintain ideal food texture, especially when making batters, steaming, or preventing dryness.

<p>For those who love baking in their air fryer, this 0.75 tbsp water to grams conversion becomes particularly valuable. Cakes, breads, and even some <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>desserts</a> need careful liquid balancing to rise properly. Too much water (even a few grams extra) can lead to soggy results, while too little may cause dryness.</p>

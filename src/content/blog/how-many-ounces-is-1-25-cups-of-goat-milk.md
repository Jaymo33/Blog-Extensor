<p>1.25 cups of goat milk equals approximately 10 fluid ounces (fl oz). This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements can make or break your dish. Whether you're making a creamy sauce or a baked good, knowing the exact weight ensures consistency.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on even cooking, and incorrect measurements can throw off the texture or taste of your dish. For example, using too much goat milk in a batter might make it too runny, while too little could dry it out. This is why converting 1.25 cups of goat milk to ounces (10 fl oz) is so helpful.</p>  
<p>If you're experimenting with recipes from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, precise measurements ensure your dishes turn out perfectly every time. Whether you're making a savoury casserole or a sweet dessert, accuracy is key.</p>  

<h2>How to Measure 1.25 Cups of Goat Milk Correctly</h2>  
<p>To measure 1.25 cups of goat milk, use a liquid measuring cup for the most accurate results. Fill it to the 1-cup mark, then add another quarter cup. If you don’t have a measuring cup, you can use a kitchen scale—10 fluid ounces of goat milk weighs roughly 295 grams.</p>

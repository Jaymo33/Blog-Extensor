<p>0.5 cup of flour equals approximately 2.25 ounces (64 grams). This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes, where precision ensures perfect texture and consistency. Whether you're whipping up air fryer cakes or crispy coatings, knowing exact measurements makes all the difference.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Flour Measurements Matter in Air Fryers</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on even heat distribution, and incorrect flour quantities can lead to uneven cooking or dry results. For example, using too much flour in an air fryer batter can make it dense, while too little might cause it to fall apart. That’s why converting 0.5 cup of flour to ounces (2.25 oz) is so helpful for consistent outcomes.</p>  
<p>If you’re exploring <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a>, precise measurements ensure your dishes turn out just right. From fluffy pancakes to crispy chicken coatings, 0.5 cup of flour (2.25 oz) is a common base for many recipes. Check our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a> for other handy measurements.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure 0.5 Cup of Flour Correctly</h3>  
<p>For accuracy, spoon flour into a measuring cup and level it off with a knife. Packing flour down can add extra ounces, throwing off your recipe. If you’re converting 0.5 cup of flour to ounces often, consider investing in a kitchen scale for foolproof results.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for 0.5 Cup of Flour in Air Fryers</h2>  
<p>This measurement is perfect for small-batch baking or coating proteins. For instance, 0.5 cup of flour (2.25 oz) works well for air fryer onion rings or a light dusting on tofu. It’s also ideal for thickening sauces in <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable-based dishes</a>.</p>  
<p>Need inspiration? Try our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipe collection</a>, where 0.5 cup of flour often stars in batters and doughs. From savoury to sweet, this measurement is a kitchen staple.</p>  

<h3>Converting 0.5 Cup of Flour to Ounces for UK Bakers</h3>  
<p>In the UK, ounces are still widely used in baking. Remember that 0.5 cup of flour equals 2.25 oz, regardless of flour type. For gluten-free alternatives like almond flour, weights may vary slightly—always check packaging.</p>  

<h2>Tips for Storing and Using Flour in Air Fryer Recipes</h2>  
<p>Keep flour in an airtight container to maintain freshness. If your 0.5 cup of flour smells musty, it’s time to replace it. For sticky batters, lightly spray air fryer baskets with oil to prevent clumping.</p>  
<p>After cooking, use our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning guide</a> to keep your appliance flour-free. Leftover flour can burn and affect future dishes if not cleaned properly.</p>

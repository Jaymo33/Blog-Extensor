<p>No, you should not put kitchen roll directly in an air fryer as it can catch fire or block airflow. While some air fryer models may tolerate it under specific conditions, the risks generally outweigh any convenience. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we always prioritise safety alongside great cooking results.</p>

<h2>Why Kitchen Roll Can Be Dangerous in Air Fryers</h2>
<p>Air fryers circulate extremely hot air at high speeds to cook food evenly. Kitchen roll is lightweight and can easily get blown around, potentially touching heating elements. Most kitchen roll brands aren’t heat-resistant above 180°C, while air fryers often operate at 200°C or higher. This combination creates a serious fire hazard that could damage your appliance or kitchen.</p>
<p>Another issue is airflow restriction. Air fryers rely on proper circulation for even cooking, and kitchen roll can block vents or stick to food. This leads to uneven results and may trigger overheating safety mechanisms. For better alternatives, check our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> to adjust recipes that might otherwise tempt you to use kitchen roll.</p>

<h3>When Might Kitchen Roll Be Acceptable?</h3>
<p>Some manufacturers approve using parchment paper specifically designed for air fryers, which resembles kitchen roll but has heat-resistant properties. If you must use something similar, these pre-cut sheets won’t fly around or burn easily. Never substitute regular kitchen roll, even if it claims to be “strong” or “premium” quality.</p>

<h2>Safe Alternatives to Kitchen Roll in Your Air Fryer</h2>
<p>For absorbing excess grease, silicone mats or specially designed air fryer liners work far better than kitchen roll. They’re reusable, heat-resistant up to 250°C, and won’t interfere with airflow. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> section shows how professionals prepare crispy foods without needing absorbent papers.</p>
<p>If you’re reheating foods that might release moisture, try elevating them on the air fryer rack instead of laying them flat. This allows drips to fall away while maintaining crispness. For particularly greasy items like sausages or bacon, a quick blot with kitchen roll before cooking is safer than placing it inside the appliance.</p>

<h3>What If Kitchen Roll Accidentally Goes In?</h3>
<p>Should kitchen roll end up in your air fryer during cooking, turn it off immediately and unplug the unit. Don’t open it right away as sudden oxygen influx could flare up any smouldering paper. Once completely cool, carefully remove any residue and clean thoroughly with our recommended <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner</a> methods.</p>

<h2>Manufacturer Guidelines on Kitchen Roll Use</h2>
<p>Leading brands like Ninja, Philips, and Cosori explicitly warn against using kitchen roll in their manuals. The intense airflow can shred standard paper, sending particles into heating elements. Even if your model seems to handle it occasionally, repeated use may void warranties. Always check your specific model’s guidelines at <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> before experimenting.</p>
<p>Some users report successfully weighing down kitchen roll with food, but this isn’t recommended. The paper can still scorch where it contacts hot surfaces, leaving unpleasant odours and potentially harmful residues. For messy dishes like our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>air fryer chicken recipes</a>, simply use a drip tray instead.</p>

<h3>Special Cases: Reheating with Kitchen Roll</h3>
<p>When reheating items like pizza or fried foods, the temptation to use kitchen roll is understandable. However, a better approach is placing food directly on the rack or using perforated parchment paper. The tiny holes allow grease drainage without the fire risk of kitchen roll. Your leftovers will crisp up perfectly without safety concerns.</p>

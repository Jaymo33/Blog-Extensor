<p>0.375 cup of sesame oil equals 3 ounces (oz). This conversion is essential for precise cooking, especially when using an air fryer where measurements can impact texture and flavour. Whether you’re following a recipe from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> or experimenting with your own creations, knowing exact quantities ensures consistent results.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on hot air circulation to cook food evenly, and incorrect measurements can throw off the balance. Too much oil, like sesame oil, can lead to soggy results, while too little might leave food dry. For dishes like stir-fries or marinades, 0.375 cup of sesame oil to ounces (3 oz) is a common measurement you’ll encounter. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more handy tips.</p>  

<p>Many air fryer recipes, especially those involving vegetables or proteins, call for precise oil quantities. If you’re preparing a dish from our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetables category</a>, getting the oil right ensures crispy, golden results. Sesame oil, with its rich flavour, is often used in smaller quantities, making conversions like 0.375 cup to ounces crucial.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure Sesame Oil Correctly</h3>  
<p>For liquid ingredients like sesame oil, always use a liquid measuring cup for accuracy. Fill it to the 0.375 cup mark (which is 3 oz) and level it off. If you’re scaling a recipe up or down, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a> includes adjustable portions to simplify cooking.</p>

<p>This quantity (3 oz) is perfect for marinades, dressings, or light frying in your air fryer. Sesame oil adds depth to Asian-inspired dishes, and measuring 0.375 cup ensures you don’t overpower the flavours. For example, a teriyaki glaze or a nutty stir-fry benefits from this precise amount.</p>  

<p>If you’re cooking frozen foods like spring rolls or dumplings, a light coating of sesame oil (0.375 cup or 3 oz) enhances crispiness. Browse our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/frozen-foods>frozen foods section</a> for ideas.

<h3>Converting Other Sesame Oil Quantities</h3>

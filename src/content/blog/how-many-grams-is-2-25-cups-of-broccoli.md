<p>Recipes often list ingredients by weight (grams) for consistency, especially in baking or meal prep. If you’re following a UK or US recipe, knowing that 2.25 cups of broccoli equals 180 grams keeps things simple. This conversion works whether you're using fresh or frozen broccoli, though frozen may weigh slightly more due to moisture content.

<h3>How to Measure Broccoli Correctly</h3>  
<p>For the most accurate 2.25 cups to grams conversion, lightly pack the broccoli florets into a measuring cup without crushing them. If you’re using a kitchen scale, tare it to zero before adding the broccoli. This method ensures you get the correct 180-gram measurement for air frying. Avoid heaping the cup, as this can add unnecessary weight and throw off your recipe.</p>

<h3>Common Mistakes When Measuring Broccoli</h3>  
<p>One mistake is using liquid measuring cups for dry ingredients like broccoli, which can lead to inaccurate amounts. Always use dry measuring cups for the best 2.25 cups to grams conversion. Another error is not accounting for stem weight—florets alone may weigh less than a mix of stems and florets. For consistent results, stick to the 180-gram benchmark.</p>  

<h2>Using Frozen vs. Fresh Broccoli</h2>  
<p>Frozen broccoli often weighs more per cup due to ice crystals, so 2.25 cups could be closer to 200 grams. If using frozen, pat it dry before air frying to avoid excess moisture. Fresh broccoli, at 180 grams for 2.25 cups, delivers crispier results in the air fryer.

<p>Whether fresh or frozen, broccoli is a versatile air fryer ingredient. Roasting it at 180°C for 10-12 minutes yields perfectly tender-crisp results. Remember, 2.25 cups (180g) is a great portion for two servings or meal prep. Adjust cooking times slightly for frozen broccoli to account for extra moisture.</p>

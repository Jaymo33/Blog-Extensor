<p>2.25 cups of broccoli equals approximately 180 grams, making it easy to measure for air fryer recipes. Whether you're roasting, steaming, or crisping broccoli in your air fryer, accurate measurements ensure consistent results. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we know precise conversions help you nail every dish, from crispy florets to tender stems.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Broccoli Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Cooking with an air fryer requires precision, especially when converting cups to grams. Broccoli’s density can vary based on how it’s chopped—florets, stems, or a mix. Using 180 grams for 2.25 cups ensures your air fryer recipes turn out perfectly every time. Whether you're making a quick side or a main dish, accurate measurements prevent under or overcooking. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more handy tips.</p>  

<p>Recipes often list ingredients by weight (grams) for consistency, especially in baking or meal prep. If you’re following a UK or US recipe, knowing that 2.25 cups of broccoli equals 180 grams keeps things simple. This conversion works whether you're using fresh or frozen broccoli, though frozen may weigh slightly more due to moisture content. For more recipe ideas, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetables category</a>.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure Broccoli Correctly</h3>  
<p>For the most accurate 2.25 cups to grams conversion, lightly pack the broccoli florets into a measuring cup without crushing them. If you’re using a kitchen scale, tare it to zero before adding the broccoli. This method ensures you get the correct 180-gram measurement for air frying. Avoid heaping the cup, as this can add unnecessary weight and throw off your recipe.</p>  

<h2>Broccoli Conversions for Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Converting 2.25 cups of broccoli to grams (180g) is especially useful for air fryer recipes, where even cooking is key. Smaller florets cook faster, while larger pieces may need extra time. If you’re prepping a batch for meal prep, weighing ensures uniformity. Discover more air fryer-friendly veggie dishes in our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipes section</a>.</p>  

<p>Different recipes may call for varying amounts, so knowing how to convert cups to grams is a game-changer. For example, 2.25 cups of chopped broccoli (180g) works well for stir-fries, casseroles, or standalone sides. If you’re adjusting a recipe, keep in mind that 1 cup of broccoli florets is roughly 80 grams. Need cleaning tips for your air fryer after cooking?

<h3>Common Mistakes When Measuring Broccoli</h3>  
<p>One mistake is using liquid measuring cups for dry ingredients like broccoli, which can lead to inaccurate amounts. Always use dry measuring cups for the best 2.25 cups to grams conversion. Another error is not accounting for stem weight—florets alone may weigh less than a mix of stems and florets. For consistent results, stick to the 180-gram benchmark.</p>  

<h2>Using Frozen vs. Fresh Broccoli</h2>  
<p>Frozen broccoli often weighs more per cup due to ice crystals, so 2.25 cups could be closer to 200 grams. If using frozen, pat it dry before air frying to avoid excess moisture. Fresh broccoli, at 180 grams for 2.25 cups, delivers crispier results in the air fryer. For more frozen food tips, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/frozen-foods>frozen foods category</a>.</p>  

<p>Whether fresh or frozen, broccoli is a versatile air fryer ingredient. Roasting it at 180°C for 10-12 minutes yields perfectly tender-crisp results. Remember, 2.25 cups (180g) is a great portion for two servings or meal prep. Adjust cooking times slightly for frozen broccoli to account for extra moisture.</p>

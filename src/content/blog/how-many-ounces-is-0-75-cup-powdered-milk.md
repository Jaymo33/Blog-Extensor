    "@type": "Answer",
    "text": "Powdered milk often works better in air fryers because it doesn't add excess moisture that can prevent crisping. When a recipe calls for 0.75 cup (3 oz) of powdered milk, it's typically for dry coatings or mixes where liquid milk would make the batter too wet."

<h3>How to measure powdered milk for air fryer recipes</h3>  
<p>For the most accurate results, use a kitchen scale to weigh 0.75 cup of powdered milk (3 oz). If you don't have one, lightly spoon the powdered milk into a measuring cup and level it off.

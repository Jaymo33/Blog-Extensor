<h3>How to Measure 385 ml of Tomato Sauce Without a Measuring Cup</h3>

<h3>Adjusting Recipes for Different Serving Sizes</h3>  
<p>If your recipe serves more or fewer people, you may need to scale the tomato sauce accordingly. For instance, doubling a recipe would require 770 ml (about 3.25 cups) of sauce. Always adjust seasoning and cooking times to match. Air fryers cook quickly, so keep an eye on saucy dishes to prevent spills or burning.</p>

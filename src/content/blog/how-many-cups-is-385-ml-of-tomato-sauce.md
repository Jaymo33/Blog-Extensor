<p>385 ml of tomato sauce equals approximately 1.63 cups. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes, ensuring precise measurements for sauces, stews, and baked dishes. Whether you're whipping up a quick pasta sauce or prepping a casserole, knowing how to convert millilitres to cups saves time and guarantees consistency. For more air fryer conversions, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Using the correct amount of tomato sauce ensures your dishes aren’t too dry or overly soggy. Air fryers rely on even heat distribution, so precise measurements help achieve the perfect texture. Whether you're making lasagna, meatballs, or a hearty stew, 385 ml of tomato sauce (or 1.63 cups) is a common quantity in many recipes. For inspiration, browse our <a href=https://www.airryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> collection.</p>  

<p>Incorrect measurements can lead to uneven cooking or flavour imbalances. For example, too much sauce might make your dish watery, while too little could leave it dry. Always measure liquids like tomato sauce carefully, especially when adapting stovetop recipes for the air fryer. A kitchen scale or measuring jug is your best friend here.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure 385 ml of Tomato Sauce Without a Measuring Cup</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a measuring cup, you can use a standard mug or glass. A typical UK mug holds around 250 ml, so 385 ml would be roughly one and a half mugs. However, for accuracy, we recommend using proper measuring tools. Check out our guide on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning your air fryer</a> to keep your equipment in top shape.</p>  

<h2>Common Recipes Using 385 ml of Tomato Sauce</h2>  
<p>Many air fryer recipes call for 385 ml of tomato sauce, especially pasta bakes, pizzas, and casseroles. This quantity is ideal for coating ingredients evenly without overwhelming the dish. For example, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipes</a> often use this amount for rich, saucy results.</p>  

<p>Another popular use is in homemade air fryer meatballs or stuffed peppers. The 385 ml measurement ensures the sauce binds ingredients without making them soggy. If you’re meal prepping, this quantity is perfect for portioning out servings. For more ideas, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable-based recipes</a>.</p>  

<h3>Adjusting Recipes for Different Serving Sizes</h3>  
<p>If your recipe serves more or fewer people, you may need to scale the tomato sauce accordingly. For instance, doubling a recipe would require 770 ml (about 3.25 cups) of sauce. Always adjust seasoning and cooking times to match. Air fryers cook quickly, so keep an eye on saucy dishes to prevent spills or burning.</p>

<p>169°C in a conventional oven converts to approximately 149°C in a fan oven. This 20-degree reduction is standard for fan-assisted cooking, where circulating hot air cooks food more efficiently. When using an air fryer - essentially a compact fan oven - you'll want to apply this same conversion principle for accurate results.</p>

<h2>Understanding Fan Oven Conversions</h2>
<p>The science behind fan oven conversions is straightforward: moving air transfers heat more effectively than still air. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we recommend this 20°C reduction rule for most recipes. For 169°C specifically, lowering to 149°C prevents overcooking while maintaining perfect texture. This conversion works beautifully for air fryer versions of oven classics.</p>
<p>Many modern recipes now include both conventional and fan oven temperatures, but older cookbooks might only list 169°C. Our testing shows that roasted vegetables, baked goods, and even meats all benefit from this adjusted approach. The circulating air in both fan ovens and air fryers creates that desirable crispy exterior without drying out the interior.</p>

<h3>Why 169°C Matters in Cooking</h3>
<p>169°C sits in the sweet spot for many cooking techniques - hot enough for browning reactions (Maillard) but gentle enough for even cooking. When converted to 149°C in a fan oven or air fryer, you maintain this balance perfectly. This temperature works particularly well for <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipes</a> where you want crisp skin and juicy meat.</p>

<h2>Adjusting Cooking Times</h2>
<p>While temperature conversion is crucial, timing adjustments complete the equation. At 149°C in a fan oven or air fryer, cooking times typically reduce by 10-15% compared to 169°C conventional. A 30-minute bake at 169°C might only need 25-27 minutes at the converted temperature. Always check food 5 minutes before the recipe suggests.</p>
<p>For air fryer users, this timing reduction can be even more pronounced due to the appliance's compact size and powerful airflow. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a> includes specific air fryer timings for popular dishes originally designed for conventional ovens. Remember that all ovens and air fryers vary slightly, so treat these conversions as starting points.</p>

<h3>Special Considerations for Baking</h3>
<p>When converting 169°C for delicate baked goods like cakes or pastries, the 20°C reduction remains reliable but requires extra vigilance. The intense airflow can cause uneven rising if not managed. Rotating trays halfway through cooking helps, as does using the air fryer's baking accessory if available. For perfect scones or muffins, try reducing the temperature slightly further to 145°C.</p>

<h2>Air Fryer Specific Conversions</h2>
<p>Modern air fryers essentially function as miniature fan ovens, making the 169°C to 149°C conversion directly applicable. However, their smaller capacity means heat distribution differs. We recommend preheating your air fryer for 3-5 minutes when using converted temperatures. This ensures even cooking from the start, especially important for <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/potatoes>potato dishes</a> aiming for that perfect crispness.</p>
<p>Some premium air fryer models now include specific "conventional oven conversion" settings that automatically adjust temperatures like 169°C. If yours has this feature, it takes the guesswork out of the process. Otherwise, manual adjustment to 149°C works perfectly for most cooking scenarios, from roasting nuts to reheating leftovers.</p>

<h3>Cleaning After High-Temp Cooking</h3>
<p>After cooking at converted high temperatures like 149°C (from 169°C), your air fryer basket may need thorough cleaning. Food particles can bake onto surfaces at these heats. Visit our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning guide</a> for tips on maintaining your appliance after high-temperature use. Regular care ensures consistent performance for all your temperature-converted recipes.</p>

<h3>How to measure 0.5 cup of goat milk accurately</h3>  
<p>Use a liquid measuring cup for the most accurate results. Fill it to the 0.5 cup mark, ensuring the milk sits level at eye height. If weighing, 4 ounces is your target. For sticky or thick goat milk, lightly grease the measuring cup first. This ensures the milk slides out easily, leaving no residue behind. Proper measuring tools are a must for air fryer success.</p>

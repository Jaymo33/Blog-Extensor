However, double cream has a higher fat content (48% vs whipping cream's 35%), so it may feel slightly denser when measuring by volume.

    "@type": "Answer",
    "text": "While 2 tbsp equals about 30ml, we recommend using grams for better accuracy, especially in air fryer baking. Milliliters measure volume, which can vary with cream's temperature and aeration. Grams measure weight, giving consistent results every time. Most UK air fryer recipes specify grams for this reason."

    "text": "After measuring your 30g portion, store the remaining cream in its original carton in the fridge's main compartment (not the door). Use within 3 days, checking for sourness before adding to air fryer recipes. For longer storage, freeze measured 2 tbsp portions in ice cube trays for future use in cooked dishes."

    "@type": "Answer",
    "text": "Air fryer recipes often use grams because they provide precision crucial for this cooking method. The intense, rapid heat means small measurement errors can significantly affect outcomes. Grams eliminate variability from how tablespoons are filled (heaped vs leveled). This is especially important for creamy sauces or baked goods in air fryers."

<p>2 tablespoons (tbsp) of whipping cream equals approximately 30 grams (g). This measurement is essential for precision in baking and cooking, especially when using an air fryer where ingredient ratios can affect texture and cook time. Whether you're whipping up desserts or creamy sauces, knowing this conversion ensures consistent results.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Using the correct amount of whipping cream can make or break your air fryer recipes. Too much can lead to soggy results, while too little might dry out your dish. For example, when making air fryer pancakes or cakes, 2 tbsp of whipping cream (30g) adds moisture without overwhelming the batter. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more handy measurement swaps.</p>  

<p>Many UK recipes use grams for precision, so converting tablespoons to grams is crucial. If you're adapting a US recipe, remember that UK tablespoons differ slightly in volume. Always measure whipping cream by weight for the best air fryer outcomes, especially in delicate bakes like soufflés or custards.</p>  

<h2>How to measure whipping cream for air fryer recipes</h2>  
<p>For the most accurate 30g measurement, use digital kitchen scales. If you don’t have scales, fill a UK-standard tablespoon (15ml) to the brim twice without packing down the cream. Avoid using American tablespoons (14.8ml), as this small difference can add up in recipes. Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> for inspiration on using whipping cream.</p>  

<h3>Does whipping cream weight change when whipped?</h3>  
<p>No, 30g of whipping cream remains 30g whether liquid or whipped – only the volume changes. When whipped, 2 tbsp of liquid cream expands to about ½ cup of fluffy topping. This is useful for air fryer desserts like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>air fryer mousses or parfaits</a> where texture is key.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for 2 tbsp whipping cream in air fryers</h2>  
<p>This small quantity works perfectly in individual portions. Try adding 30g whipping cream to scrambled eggs before air frying for extra richness, or mix into mashed potatoes for a luxurious side. It’s also ideal for glazing <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>air fryer cakes</a> or creating creamy pasta sauces.</p>  

<p>For cleaning your air fryer after creamy recipes, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner guide</a> helps remove dairy residue. Remember, 2 tbsp (30g) of whipping cream contains about 100 calories, so measure carefully if watching intake.</p>

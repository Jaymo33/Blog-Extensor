<p>2.5 tablespoons (tbsp) of double cream equals approximately 37.5 grams. This conversion is essential for precise cooking, especially when using an air fryer where measurements can affect texture and consistency. Whether you're making a rich dessert or a creamy sauce, knowing the exact weight ensures perfect results every time.</p>

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on precise ingredient ratios to achieve the best texture and flavour. Using too much or too little double cream can alter the outcome of your dish. For example, a <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>creamy pasta bake</a> might turn out too dry or overly rich if the cream measurement is off. Accurate conversions like 2.5 tbsp of double cream to grams help maintain consistency.</p>  
<p>Many <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion charts</a> include common ingredients, but double cream can be tricky due to its density. A kitchen scale is the most reliable tool, but if you don’t have one, this guide ensures you get it right. Whether you're preparing a <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>decadent dessert</a> or a savoury dish, precision is key.</p>

<h2>How to measure 2.5 tbsp of double cream without a scale</h2>  
<p>If you don’t have a scale, use a standard UK tablespoon (15ml) to measure your double cream. Fill it slightly over the rim for an accurate 2.5 tbsp measurement. Remember, double cream is denser than single cream, so volume-to-weight conversions are crucial. For reference, 1 tbsp of double cream weighs around 15 grams, making 2.5 tbsp roughly 37.5 grams.</p>  
<p>This method works well for recipes like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>air fryer cakes</a>, where even small measurement errors can affect rise and texture. If you’re unsure, err on the side of slightly less cream to avoid overly rich results.

<p>125 grams of butter is roughly equivalent to 1/2 cup (or 0.53 cups to be precise) in standard US measurements. In UK measurements, it's slightly different due to varying cup sizes - about 0.55 UK cups. Whether you're preparing a cake or cooking in your air fryer, accurate butter measurements make all the difference in your recipes.</p>

<h2>Understanding Butter Measurements</h2>
<p>Butter measurements can be tricky, especially when converting between grams and cups. Unlike liquid ingredients, butter's density means weight-to-volume conversions aren't always straightforward. For air fryer recipes from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, precise measurements ensure your dishes turn out perfectly every time.</p>
<p>Most baking recipes, including those for air fryers, specify butter in grams for accuracy. However, if you only have measuring cups available, knowing that 125 grams equals about half a cup helps maintain recipe integrity. This conversion works for both salted and unsalted butter, as their densities are nearly identical.</p>

<h2>UK vs US Cup Measurements</h2>
<p>The slight difference between UK and US cup measurements matters when converting 125 grams of butter to cups. A US cup is 240ml, while a UK cup is 250ml. This means 125g of butter equals 0.53 US cups or 0.55 UK cups - a small but potentially important distinction for precise baking.</p>
<p>For air fryer recipes, especially when making smaller batches, these slight variations can affect texture and consistency. Many recipes on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes</a> provide both metric and imperial measurements to accommodate all cooks.</p>

<h3>Measuring Butter Without Scales</h3>
<p>If you don't have kitchen scales, you can still measure 125 grams of butter using the markings on the wrapper. Standard butter blocks often have tablespoon markings - 125g equals about 8-9 tablespoons. Alternatively, use the water displacement method: fill a measuring cup with 1/2 cup water, then add butter until the water reaches 1 cup.</p>

<h2>Butter Conversions for Air Fryer Cooking</h2>
<p>When adapting traditional recipes for your air fryer, accurate butter measurements become even more crucial. The air fryer's intense circulating heat means ingredient ratios significantly impact results. 125 grams of butter (half cup) is a common measurement in many <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>air fryer cake recipes</a>.</p>
<p>Remember that melted butter measures differently - 125g of melted butter equals about 1/2 cup liquid measure. For best results in air fryer baking, use our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> to adjust traditional oven recipes properly.</p>

<h3>Tips for Measuring Butter Accurately</h3>
<p>For the most accurate 125 grams to cups conversion, use room temperature butter packed firmly into the measuring cup. Cold butter doesn't settle as evenly, potentially leading to measurement errors. When baking in your air fryer, these small differences can affect how your cakes rise or cookies spread.</p>

<h2>Common Recipes Using 125g Butter</h2>
<p>Many classic recipes call for exactly 125 grams of butter. This includes Victoria sponge cake, shortbread cookies, and buttercream frosting - all of which can be adapted for air fryer preparation. The team at <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> has perfected many butter-based recipes for air fryer use.</p>
<p>When converting these recipes, remember that 125 grams equals half a cup of butter. This measurement forms the base of countless delicious treats, from air fryer scones to pastry doughs. Proper measurement ensures your air fryer creations turn out light, flaky, and perfectly textured every time.</p>

<p>Onions also vary in density depending on chop size—finely diced onions pack more tightly into a cup than roughly chopped ones. For the most accurate 0.33 cup to ounces conversion, aim for a uniform medium chop. This way, you’ll avoid under or over-seasoning your air fryer meals. Need cleaning tips after prepping onions?

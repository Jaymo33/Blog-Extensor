<p>25 grams of soy milk equals approximately 0.88 ounces. This conversion is handy for air fryer recipes where precision matters, ensuring your dishes turn out perfectly every time. Whether you’re baking a cake or preparing a creamy sauce, knowing how to convert grams to ounces is essential. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we make these conversions easy so you can focus on cooking.</p>

<h2>Why convert 25g of soy milk to ounces?</h2>  
<p>Many air fryer recipes, especially those from the UK, use metric measurements like grams. However, some kitchen scales or older recipes might list ingredients in ounces. Converting 25g of soy milk to ounces ensures accuracy, whether you’re following a recipe from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>our collection</a> or adapting one to your tastes. Precision is key in baking, where even small measurement errors can affect texture and rise.</p>  
<p>Soy milk is a popular dairy alternative in air fryer recipes, from vegan cakes to creamy sauces. Knowing that 25g of soy milk is roughly 0.88 ounces helps you adjust quantities without guesswork. If you’re scaling a recipe up or down, this conversion ensures consistency. For more tips on air fryer measurements, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a>.</p>  

<h2>How to measure 25g of soy milk accurately</h2>  
<p>Using a digital kitchen scale is the easiest way to measure 25g of soy milk. Simply pour the soy milk into a measuring jug on the scale until it hits 25g. If your scale displays ounces, it should read close to 0.88 oz. For those without scales, 25g of soy milk is roughly 1.5 tablespoons, though weighing is more precise.</p>  
<p>Liquid measurements can vary slightly due to density, so always opt for weight over volume when possible. This is especially important for air fryer recipes, where exact ratios impact cooking times and results. Need more measurement help?

For example, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>vegan chocolate mug cake</a> uses this amount for perfect texture. Soy milk also works well in savoury dishes, like creamy pasta sauces or marinades.</p>

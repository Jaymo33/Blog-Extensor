<p>40g of cornflour equals approximately 1.41 ounces. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precision matters. Whether you’re coating chicken or thickening a sauce, knowing the exact weight ensures perfect results every time. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we help you nail those measurements for flawless cooking.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on even heat distribution, and incorrect ingredient quantities can throw off your dish. Too much cornflour, for example, can make coatings overly dense, while too little might leave them soggy. Using 40g of cornflour (1.41 ounces) ensures consistency, especially in recipes like crispy fried chicken or tempura vegetables. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more handy tips.</p>  

<p>Many UK cooks prefer grams, but some recipes use ounces, making conversions like 40g cornflour to ounces crucial. Digital scales often switch between units, but knowing the math helps when you’re in a pinch. For more air fryer-friendly recipes, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipes section</a>.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure 40g of Cornflour Without Scales</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have scales, use a measuring spoon: 40g of cornflour is roughly 5 UK tablespoons. However, spooning lightly avoids compacting the flour, which could skew the weight. For best results, invest in a kitchen scale—it’s a game-changer for air fryer cooking.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for 40g of Cornflour in Air Fryer Recipes</h2>  
<p>Cornflour is a staple for creating crispy coatings. A 40g portion is perfect for dredging chicken wings, fish fillets, or even tofu before air frying. It’s also great for thickening sauces in dishes like sweet and sour pork or stir-fries. Visit our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipes</a> for inspiration.</p>  

<p>For gluten-free baking, 40g of cornflour can replace wheat flour in small batches. It’s lighter, yielding a delicate crumb in cakes or cookies. Just remember: 40g cornflour to ounces (1.41 oz) ensures you don’t overdo it. Cleanup is easy too—see our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner guide</a> for tips.</p>

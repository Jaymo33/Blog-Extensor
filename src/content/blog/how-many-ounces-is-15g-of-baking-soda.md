<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on precise ingredient ratios to achieve the perfect texture and flavour. Too much or too little baking soda can affect the rise of cakes, the crispiness of batters, or even the cleaning efficiency of DIY solutions. For example, if you’re making <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>air fryer cakes</a>, 15g of baking soda (0.53 oz) helps create a light, fluffy texture. Similarly, using the right amount ensures your <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaning</a> hacks work effectively without residue.</p>  

<p>Many UK recipes list ingredients in grams, but some cooks prefer ounces for convenience. A digital kitchen scale is the most reliable tool for these conversions, but if you don’t have one, memorising key conversions like 15g to ounces can save time.

However, this method isn’t as precise as weighing, especially for recipes requiring exact measurements. For best results, invest in a digital scale or refer to our conversion guides.</p>

<p>Baking soda isn’t just for cakes—it’s a versatile ingredient in air fryer cooking. From creating crispy coatings to neutralising odours, 15g (0.53 oz) can go a long way. For instance, adding a pinch to your <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>air fryer chicken</a> batter helps achieve a golden, crunchy exterior.

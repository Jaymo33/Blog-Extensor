Whether you're whipping up a batch of crispy roast potatoes or a moist cake, knowing how to convert 685 ml of olive oil to cups ensures consistency and delicious results every time.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Frying</h2>
<p>Air fryers rely on precise ingredient ratios to achieve the perfect texture and flavour. Too much or too little olive oil can affect how your food cooks, leading to uneven browning or dryness. For example, if you're making air-fried vegetables, 685 ml of olive oil converts to roughly 2.9 cups, which is enough to coat them evenly without making them greasy.

<p>Many air fryer recipes, like those for crispy chicken or roasted potatoes, call for specific amounts of oil to ensure the right crunch.

<h2>How to Measure 685 ml of Olive Oil Without a Scale</h2>
<p>If you don’t have a kitchen scale, measuring 685 ml of olive oil in cups is straightforward. A standard US cup holds 240 ml, so 685 ml divided by 240 ml gives you roughly 2.9 cups.

<p>For air fryer cooking, where even distribution of oil is crucial, using a measuring jug with ml and cup markings is ideal. This ensures you’re adding the right amount of oil—whether it’s 685 ml or its cup equivalent—to your ingredients.

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>

<p>If you don't have a scale, use a liquid measuring cup marked in millilitres and cups. Pour the oil to the 160 ml line, which is just under 3/4 of a cup. For smaller quantities, a tablespoon holds about 15 ml, so 160 ml would be roughly 10.5 tablespoons. This method works well for oils like vegetable, sunflower, or olive oil.</p>

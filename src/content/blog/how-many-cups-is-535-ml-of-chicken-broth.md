Whether you're making soups, sauces, or marinades, knowing how to convert millilitres to cups ensures consistent results every time.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Using the correct amount of chicken broth can make or break a dish. Too much liquid can lead to soggy results, while too little might dry out your food. For air fryer recipes, where evaporation happens quickly, getting the measurement right is even more critical. A conversion chart like the one on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> can be a lifesaver.</p>  

<p>Many air fryer recipes, especially those for soups or stews, call for chicken broth. If you're working with 535 ml, knowing it's roughly 2.26 cups helps you adjust quantities without guesswork. This precision ensures your meals turn out perfectly every time, whether you're cooking for one or meal prepping for the week.</p>  

<h2>How to Measure 535 ml of Chicken Broth Without a Measuring Cup</h2>  
<p>Don't have a measuring cup handy? No problem. You can use a standard mug or glass to estimate 535 ml of chicken broth.

<h3>Using Kitchen Scales for Liquid Measurements</h3>

Since 1 ml of water weighs roughly 1 gram, chicken broth (which has a similar density) will be close enough for most recipes. Place your container on the scale, tare it, and pour until you hit 535 grams. This method is especially handy for air fryer cooking, where precision matters.</p>

<h3>Adjusting Recipes for Different Serving Sizes</h3>

<p>235 ml of condensed milk is roughly equivalent to 1 cup in both UK and US measurements. This conversion is essential for baking and cooking, especially when using an air fryer where precise measurements can affect texture and taste. Whether you're whipping up a dessert or a savoury dish, knowing how to convert ml to cups ensures consistency in your recipes.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of condensed milk can make or break your recipe. Too much can lead to overly sweet or soggy results, while too little might leave your dish lacking richness. Air fryers, like those featured on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, rely on even heat distribution, so ingredient ratios are crucial. For example, a <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert</a> like air-fried caramel custard requires precise condensed milk measurements for the perfect consistency.</p>  

<p>Condensed milk is thicker than regular milk, so measuring it correctly ensures your batter or sauce isn’t too runny or dense. If you're working with recipes from different regions, always double-check whether they use metric (ml) or imperial (cups) measurements. A handy <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a> can save time and prevent mistakes.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure 235 ml of Condensed Milk Without a Scale</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a measuring jug, use a standard 250 ml cup and fill it just below the rim for 235 ml. Alternatively, 15 tablespoons (approx. 1 tbsp = 15 ml) will get you close. For sticky ingredients like condensed milk, lightly grease your measuring spoon or cup to ensure it slides out easily. This trick is especially useful when preparing <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>cakes</a> or fudgy brownies in your air fryer.</p>  

<h2>Common Recipes Using 235 ml of Condensed Milk</h2>  
<p>Many air fryer recipes call for condensed milk, from tres leches cake to sticky toffee pudding. A 235 ml portion is often used in smaller batches, perfect for air fryer-friendly servings. For inspiration, browse the <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipes</a> section on our site, where you’ll find creative ways to incorporate condensed milk into air-fried treats.</p>  

<p>Condensed milk also works wonders in savoury dishes, like glazed meats or creamy pasta sauces. Its high sugar content caramelises beautifully in the air fryer, adding depth to dishes like honey-glazed chicken or sweet potato casserole. Just remember to adjust cooking times slightly, as sugary ingredients can brown faster.</p>  

<h3>UK vs. US Cup Measurements: Is There a Difference?</h3>  
<p>While 235 ml equals 1 cup in both UK and US measurements, it’s worth noting that UK cups are technically 284 ml (based on imperial pints). However, most modern recipes standardise to the US cup (240 ml) for simplicity. When in doubt, check the recipe’s origin or use ml for precision—especially important for air fryer cooking, where small discrepancies can affect results.</p>

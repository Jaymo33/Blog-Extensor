<p>200 grams of icing sugar equals approximately 1.6 cups in the UK or 1.5 cups in the US. This conversion is essential for bakers who rely on precise measurements for perfect results, especially when using an air fryer for cakes or desserts. Whether you're following a recipe from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> or adapting a traditional bake, knowing how to convert grams to cups ensures consistency.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Measurement Matters</h2>  
<p>Baking is a science, and even small deviations in ingredient quantities can affect texture and taste. Icing sugar, also known as powdered sugar, is particularly finicky because its density varies based on how it's packed. Too much can make frostings overly sweet or stiff, while too little can leave them runny. If you're using an air fryer for baking, precise measurements become even more critical due to the appliance's rapid cooking method.</p>  

<p>For those exploring air fryer desserts, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> for inspiration. From cookies to sponges, accurate conversions ensure your treats turn out perfectly every time. Whether you're in the UK or the US, understanding the difference between metric and imperial measurements is key to baking success.</p>  

<h3>UK vs. US Cup Measurements</h3>  
<p>In the UK, 1 cup of icing sugar typically weighs 125 grams, meaning 200 grams is roughly 1.6 cups. In the US, where 1 cup equals 132 grams, 200 grams translates to about 1.5 cups. This slight difference matters when scaling recipes, so always check which system your recipe uses. For more conversion help, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> simplifies the process.</p>  

<h2>How to Measure Icing Sugar Correctly</h2>  
<p>The way you measure icing sugar can impact the final quantity. Spooning it lightly into a cup and leveling it off yields a more accurate result than scooping directly from the bag, which can compact the sugar. If your recipe calls for sifted icing sugar, measure after sifting to avoid discrepancies. This is especially important for air fryer baking, where even heat distribution relies on consistent batter or frosting texture.</p>  

<p>For those new to air fryer baking, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>cake recipes</a> offer step-by-step guidance. Remember, 200 grams of icing sugar is a common measurement for frostings and glazes, so mastering this conversion opens up a world of dessert possibilities. Always use a digital scale for the most precise results, especially when working with delicate ingredients.</p>  

<h3>Converting Other Sugar Quantities</h3>  
<p>If your recipe requires more or less than 200 grams, here's a quick reference: 100 grams equals 0.8 UK cups (0.75 US cups), while 300 grams equals 2.4 UK cups (2.25 US cups). Bookmark our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a> for easy access during baking sessions. These ratios apply to pure icing sugar; if your blend includes cornflour (common in commercial varieties), the weight-to-volume ratio may vary slightly.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for 200 Grams of Icing Sugar</h2>  
<p>This quantity is perfect for buttercream frosting covering a single-layer cake or a batch of 12-18 cupcakes. It's also ideal for dusting desserts or making glazes for air fryer-baked goods like doughnuts or cinnamon rolls. When preparing these treats, ensure your air fryer is clean—our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning guide</a> helps maintain performance.</p>  

<p>For lighter options, 200 grams can sweeten a fruit salad topping or whipped cream. In savory applications, a sprinkle balances spicy dishes. The versatility of icing sugar makes it a staple in both traditional and air fryer baking, so keeping conversion knowledge handy streamlines your cooking process.</p>

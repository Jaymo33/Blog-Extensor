Whether you're making a <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable stir-fry</a> or a meat marinade, precision ensures your dish turns out just right. Keep a kitchen scale handy for the most accurate measurements.</p>  

<h2>How to measure 15g minced onion without a scale</h2>  
<p>If you don’t have a scale, you can estimate 15g of minced onion using tablespoons. One tablespoon of minced onion typically weighs around 5g, so three tablespoons will give you roughly 15g. This method isn’t as precise as weighing but works in a pinch.</p>  

<p>For best results, fluff the minced onion lightly before measuring to avoid compacting it. Packed minced onion can weigh more, throwing off your recipe. If you're preparing a dish like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer onion rings</a>, accuracy is key for the perfect crunch.</p>

<p>1.25 cups of garlic paste equals approximately 10 ounces. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements can make or break a dish. Whether you're whipping up a marinade or a sauce, knowing the exact weight ensures consistency. Garlic paste is a staple in many dishes, and getting the right amount is key to balancing flavours. For more air fryer conversions, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on even cooking, and incorrect measurements can lead to uneven results. Too much garlic paste might overpower your dish, while too little could leave it bland. Precision is especially important when working with marinades or rubs for meats like chicken or lamb. If you're prepping a large batch, scaling ingredients correctly ensures every portion tastes the same. Visit our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipes section</a> for perfectly measured air fryer dishes.</p>  

<p>Garlic paste is denser than minced garlic, so volume-to-weight conversions can be tricky. A standard cup of garlic paste weighs around 8 ounces, making 1.25 cups roughly 10 ounces. This measurement is useful for UK cooks who prefer weighing ingredients for accuracy. If you're adapting a recipe from cups to ounces, this conversion saves time and hassle. For more tips on air fryer prep, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/meal-prep>meal prep category</a>.</p>  

<h3>How to measure garlic paste without scales</h3>  
<p>If you don't have a kitchen scale, use measuring cups and spoons for approximate conversions. Pack the garlic paste firmly into the cup to avoid air gaps, which can skew measurements. For 1.25 cups, fill one cup completely, then add a quarter cup. Levelling off the top with a knife ensures consistency. This method works well for most air fryer recipes, from marinades to sauces.

<h2>Common uses for garlic paste in air fryer recipes</h2>  
<p>Garlic paste is a versatile ingredient in air fryer cooking, perfect for marinades, rubs, and sauces. It blends seamlessly with oils and herbs, creating a flavour base for meats like chicken or shrimp. A 10-ounce portion (1.25 cups) is ideal for marinating 4-6 chicken breasts or a whole rack of lamb. The paste's smooth texture ensures even coating, which is crucial for air fryer cooking. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipes</a> for inspiration.</p>  

<p>Beyond meats, garlic paste enhances vegetable dishes in the air fryer. Tossing potatoes or mushrooms with a small amount adds depth without overwhelming other flavours. Since air fryers intensify tastes, a little goes a long way—10 ounces can season multiple batches. For plant-based options, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/tofu>tofu recipes</a> showcase how garlic paste elevates simple ingredients.</p>  

<h3>Storing leftover garlic paste</h3>  
<p>If you've measured out 1.25 cups (10 ounces) but don't need it all, store leftovers properly. Transfer unused paste to an airtight container and refrigerate for up to two weeks. You can also freeze portions in ice cube trays for easy future use. This prevents waste and ensures you always have garlic paste ready for quick air fryer meals. Proper storage maintains flavour and prevents contamination, keeping your dishes tasting fresh.</p>

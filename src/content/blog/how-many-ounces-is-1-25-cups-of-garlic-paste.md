<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on even cooking, and incorrect measurements can lead to uneven results. Too much garlic paste might overpower your dish, while too little could leave it bland. Precision is especially important when working with marinades or rubs for meats like chicken or lamb. If you're prepping a large batch, scaling ingredients correctly ensures every portion tastes the same.

<p>Garlic paste is denser than minced garlic, so volume-to-weight conversions can be tricky. A standard cup of garlic paste weighs around 8 ounces, making 1.25 cups roughly 10 ounces. This measurement is useful for UK cooks who prefer weighing ingredients for accuracy. If you're adapting a recipe from cups to ounces, this conversion saves time and hassle.

<h3>How to measure garlic paste without scales</h3>  
<p>If you don't have a kitchen scale, use measuring cups and spoons for approximate conversions. Pack the garlic paste firmly into the cup to avoid air gaps, which can skew measurements. For 1.25 cups, fill one cup completely, then add a quarter cup. Levelling off the top with a knife ensures consistency. This method works well for most air fryer recipes, from marinades to sauces.

<h2>Common uses for garlic paste in air fryer recipes</h2>  
<p>Garlic paste is a versatile ingredient in air fryer cooking, perfect for marinades, rubs, and sauces.

<h3>Storing leftover garlic paste</h3>

You can also freeze portions in ice cube trays for easy future use. This prevents waste and ensures you always have garlic paste ready for quick air fryer meals. Proper storage maintains flavour and prevents contamination, keeping your dishes tasting fresh.</p>

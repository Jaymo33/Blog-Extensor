<p>138 C in a fan oven is equivalent to approximately 120 C when using a conventional oven setting. This conversion is crucial for air fryer users, as most air fryers operate like fan ovens, circulating hot air for even cooking. Understanding this temperature adjustment ensures your recipes turn out perfectly every time. Whether you're baking, roasting, or reheating, getting the temperature right is key. For more air fryer tips, visit <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>.</p>

<h2>Why Convert 138 C to Fan Oven?</h2>
<p>Fan ovens and air fryers work differently from conventional ovens. They use a fan to circulate hot air, which cooks food faster and more evenly. This means you often need to adjust the temperature downward. Converting 138 C to a fan oven setting ensures your food doesn’t overcook or dry out. It’s especially important for delicate dishes like cakes or pastries. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more details.</p>

<p>Many recipes are written for conventional ovens, so knowing how to adjust them for your air fryer is essential. A 138 C fan oven setting will give you similar results to a conventional oven at 138 C, but with shorter cooking times. This is because the circulating air speeds up the cooking process. Always keep an eye on your food the first time you try a new conversion. For recipe ideas, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipes section</a>.</p>

<h3>How to Adjust Cooking Times</h3>
<p>When converting 138 C to a fan oven, you’ll also need to adjust the cooking time. Start by reducing the time by about 20% and check your food regularly. Air fryers are efficient, so dishes often cook faster than in a conventional oven. For example, a cake that takes 30 minutes at 138 C in a conventional oven might only need 24 minutes in a fan oven. Always use a skewer or thermometer to test for doneness.</p>

<h2>Best Practices for Air Fryer Cooking</h2>
<p>Using an air fryer at 138 C fan oven setting requires a few adjustments. Preheat your air fryer for 3-5 minutes to ensure even cooking. Avoid overcrowding the basket, as this can block airflow and lead to uneven results. Shake or turn food halfway through cooking for the best texture.

<p>Different foods react differently to 138 C in a fan oven. Vegetables might roast perfectly, while meats may need a slightly higher temperature. Experiment with small batches to find the ideal settings for your favorite dishes. Don’t forget to check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable recipes</a> for inspiration. With practice, you’ll master the art of air fryer cooking at any temperature.</p>

<h3>Common Mistakes to Avoid</h3>
<p>One common mistake is not adjusting the temperature when converting 138 C to a fan oven. This can lead to burnt or undercooked food. Another pitfall is forgetting to reduce the cooking time, as fan ovens cook faster. Always use an oven thermometer to verify your air fryer’s temperature accuracy. Lastly, avoid using non-air-fryer-safe cookware, as it can affect cooking performance.</p>

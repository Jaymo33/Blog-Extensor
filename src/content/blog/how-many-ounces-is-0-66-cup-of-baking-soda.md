<p>0.66 cup of baking soda equals approximately 5.28 ounces. This conversion is essential for precise baking and air fryer recipes, where accurate measurements can make or break your dish. Whether you're whipping up a batch of cookies or preparing a savoury air fryer meal, knowing how to convert cups to ounces ensures consistency. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we emphasise the importance of correct measurements for perfect results every time.</p>

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of baking soda is crucial, especially in air fryer recipes where even small deviations can affect texture and taste. Too much baking soda can leave a bitter aftertaste, while too little might not give your baked goods the desired lift. For example, if you're making air fryer cookies or cakes, 0.66 cup of baking soda (5.28 ounces) should be measured precisely. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more handy measurement tips.</p>  

<p>Air fryers cook food faster than conventional ovens, so ingredient ratios need to be spot-on. A slight miscalculation in baking soda could lead to uneven rising or overly dense results. Whether you're converting 0.66 cup of baking soda to ounces or adjusting other ingredients, precision is key. Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a> for dishes that rely on accurate measurements for success.</p>  

<h3>How to measure 0.66 cup of baking soda correctly</h3>  
<p>To measure 0.66 cup of baking soda, use a dry measuring cup and level it off with a straight edge for accuracy. If you don’t have a 0.66 cup measure, you can use two-thirds of a standard cup. For those who prefer weight measurements, 0.66 cup translates to roughly 5.28 ounces. This method eliminates guesswork and ensures your air fryer recipes turn out perfectly every time.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for 0.66 cup of baking soda in air fryer recipes</h2>  
<p>Baking soda isn’t just for cakes—it’s a versatile ingredient in many air fryer dishes. From crispy fried chicken to fluffy muffins, 0.66 cup (5.28 ounces) of baking soda can be used in batters, marinades, and even cleaning solutions. For instance, a pinch of baking soda in your air fryer batter helps achieve that golden crunch. Discover more creative uses in our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipes</a> section.</p>  

<p>Another great application is using baking soda to neutralise odours in your air fryer. A mixture of 0.66 cup baking soda and water can clean and deodorise the basket effectively. For a deeper clean, check out our guide on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer maintenance</a>.

<h3>Converting other baking soda measurements</h3>

<p>0.66 cup of treacle equals approximately 7.5 ounces. This conversion is essential for precise measurements in air fryer recipes, ensuring your dishes turn out perfectly every time. Whether you’re baking a sticky toffee pudding or glazing meats, knowing how many ounces are in 0.66 cup of treacle helps you achieve consistent results.</p>

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on precise ingredient ratios to deliver even cooking and perfect textures. Too much or too little treacle can throw off the balance of your recipe, affecting both flavour and consistency. For example, a sticky glaze might become too runny or overly thick if the treacle measurement is off. That’s why converting 0.66 cup of treacle to ounces is so important.</p>  

<p>At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we emphasise the importance of accurate conversions for air fryer success.

<h2>How to measure treacle for air fryer recipes</h2>  
<p>Measuring treacle can be tricky due to its thick, sticky consistency. To get an accurate 0.66 cup measurement, lightly grease your measuring cup with oil to help the treacle slide out easily. Alternatively, use a kitchen scale to weigh out 7.5 ounces for precision.</p>

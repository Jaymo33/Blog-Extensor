<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Getting the right amount of rolled oats is crucial, especially in air fryer cooking where space and heat distribution affect results. Too much or too little can alter texture, cooking time, and even taste. Whether you’re making crunchy granola clusters or a moist oat-based bake, 160 grams (2.0 cups) is the sweet spot. For recipe inspiration, browse our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> collection.</p>  

<p>Rolled oats are a staple in many air fryer dishes, from breakfast to desserts. Their versatility means they absorb flavours well, but incorrect measurements can lead to dry or soggy outcomes. Always use a kitchen scale for the best results, especially when converting cups to grams. If you’re new to air frying, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/breakfast>breakfast recipes</a> are a great place to start.</p>  

<h3>UK vs. US Cup Measurements</h3>  
<p>While 2.0 cups of rolled oats generally convert to 160 grams, slight variations exist between UK and US measuring cups. UK cups are slightly larger, but for rolled oats, the difference is minimal. If precision is key, weighing your ingredients eliminates any guesswork. Explore more tips on our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> homepage.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for 2.0 Cups of Rolled Oats</h2>  
<p>This measurement is perfect for batch cooking or family-sized portions. Think air-fryer granola, oat bars, or even savoury coatings for chicken or fish. The 160-gram quantity ensures even cooking and balanced flavours.

<p>Rolled oats are also great for meal prep—160 grams can make several servings of overnight oats or energy bites. Storing them correctly keeps them fresh for future air fryer creations. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/meal-prep>meal prep recipes</a> for more ideas.</p>  

<h3>Tips for Measuring Without a Scale</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a scale, fluff the oats lightly before scooping to avoid compacting them into the cup. Level off the top with a knife for an accurate 2.0-cup measure. Remember, slight variations won’t ruin your dish, but weighing is best for baking.</p>

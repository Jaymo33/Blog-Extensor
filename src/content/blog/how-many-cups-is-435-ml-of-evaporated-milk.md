<p>435 ml of evaporated milk is approximately 1.84 cups in the UK or 1.83 cups in the US. This conversion is essential for baking and cooking, especially when using an air fryer where precise measurements matter. Whether you're whipping up a dessert or a savoury dish, knowing how to convert millilitres to cups ensures your recipe turns out perfectly every time.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>When working with evaporated milk, even small measurement discrepancies can affect the texture and taste of your dish. For example, too much evaporated milk in a cake batter can make it overly dense, while too little might leave it dry. Air fryer recipes, like those on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, often rely on precise liquid measurements to ensure even cooking and perfect results. This is particularly important for dishes like custards or creamy sauces, where consistency is key.</p>  

<p>Evaporated milk is a staple in many recipes, from desserts like fudge to savoury dishes like casseroles. If you're using an air fryer for baking, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for other common ingredient conversions. This will help you adapt traditional oven recipes to your air fryer with ease.</p>  

<h2>UK vs. US Cup Measurements</h2>  
<p>It's worth noting that UK and US cup measurements differ slightly. In the UK, 1 cup equals 284 ml, while in the US, it's 240 ml. This means 435 ml of evaporated milk converts to roughly 1.84 cups in the UK and 1.83 cups in the US. For most recipes, this small difference won’t be noticeable, but for precision baking, it’s good to be aware of the distinction.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure Evaporated Milk Without a Scale</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a measuring jug or scale, you can use a standard metric cup to measure 435 ml of evaporated milk. Fill the cup to just below the 250 ml mark twice, then add another 185 ml for an accurate measurement. Alternatively, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a> for air fryer-friendly dishes that use evaporated milk, like creamy pasta bakes or indulgent desserts.</p>  

<h2>Common Recipes Using 435 ml of Evaporated Milk</h2>

You can also freeze evaporated milk in ice cube trays for future use in smaller quantities—perfect for adding a creamy touch to sauces or coffees.</p>  

<h2>Converting Other Liquid Measurements</h2>  
<p>If you frequently work with millilitres and cups, it’s helpful to memorise a few key conversions. For example, 250 ml is roughly 1 cup in the UK, while 200 ml is closer to a US cup. Keeping a conversion chart handy, like the one on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, can save time and ensure accuracy in your cooking and baking.</p>

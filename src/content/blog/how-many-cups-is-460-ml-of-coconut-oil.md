<p>460 ml of coconut oil is approximately 1.94 cups in the US measurement system and roughly 1.62 cups in the UK. Whether you're baking or using your air fryer, getting the right measurement ensures your dish turns out perfectly. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we know precise conversions make all the difference in cooking.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Using the correct amount of coconut oil is crucial for texture and flavour in recipes. Too much can make dishes greasy, while too little may leave them dry.

Coconut oil is a popular choice for its health benefits and versatility, but measuring it correctly is key.</p>

<h2>US vs UK Cup Measurements</h2>

<h3>How to Measure Coconut Oil Properly</h3>

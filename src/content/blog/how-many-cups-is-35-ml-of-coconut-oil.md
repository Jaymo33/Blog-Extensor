<p>35 ml of coconut oil is approximately 0.148 cups (or roughly 1/7 of a cup). This conversion is essential for precise baking and air frying, ensuring your recipes turn out perfectly every time. Whether you're making crispy air-fried treats or moist cakes, accurate measurements matter. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we help simplify kitchen conversions so you can focus on cooking.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Frying</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of coconut oil ensures even cooking and prevents dryness or sogginess in your air-fried dishes. Too little oil, and your food might stick; too much, and it can become greasy. For example, when making air-fried sweet potato fries, 35 ml of coconut oil (0.148 cups) provides just enough crispiness without excess oil. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more handy measurement guides.</p>  

<p>Many air fryer recipes call for small quantities of oil, making conversions like 35 ml to cups crucial. Coconut oil is a popular choice due to its high smoke point and health benefits. Whether you're cooking <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>air-fried chicken</a> or roasting vegetables, precise measurements ensure consistent results. Remember, 35 ml of coconut oil is just under 1/7 of a cup, so a slight overpour won’t ruin your dish.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure 35 ml of Coconut Oil Without a Scale</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a measuring jug, use a tablespoon to measure 35 ml of coconut oil. One tablespoon holds about 15 ml, so you’ll need just over two tablespoons (2.33 tbsp) for 35 ml. Melted coconut oil is easier to measure, but solid oil can be scooped and levelled. For more tips, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a> tailored for air fryers.</p>  

<h2>Converting 35 ml of Coconut Oil for Different Recipes</h2>  
<p>Whether you're baking or air frying, 35 ml of coconut oil (0.148 cups) works well in many dishes. For example, it’s perfect for greasing air fryer baskets or mixing into batter for <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>air-fryer cakes</a>. Since coconut oil solidifies at cooler temperatures, measure it in its liquid state for accuracy. Need to clean your air fryer after cooking? Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning guide</a> has you covered.</p>  

<p>When substituting butter with coconut oil, 35 ml equals roughly 0.148 cups, but adjust for texture differences. Coconut oil adds a subtle sweetness, ideal for desserts like air-fried cookies. For savoury dishes, such as <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>roasted vegetables</a>, it enhances flavour without overpowering. Always measure carefully to avoid altering your recipe’s balance.</p>  

<h3>Common Mistakes When Measuring Coconut Oil</h3>  
<p>Avoid packing solid coconut oil into cups, as this leads to excess. Instead, melt it first for a precise 35 ml (0.148 cups) measurement. Also, don’t confuse millilitres with grams—coconut oil’s density varies with temperature. For foolproof results, use a liquid measuring cup and check our conversion guides at <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on even cooking, and incorrect ingredient quantities can throw off textures and flavours. Fish sauce, with its strong salinity, needs careful measuring to avoid overpowering dishes. A slight miscalculation could turn a delicious meal into an overly salty experience. For example, marinating salmon with too much fish sauce might ruin its delicate taste.

<p>Many air fryer recipes, like Thai-inspired chicken wings or Vietnamese-style tofu, call for fish sauce. Getting the measurement right ensures balanced flavours every time. If you’re experimenting with new dishes, precise conversions help replicate success.

<h3>How to Measure Fish Sauce Correctly</h3>  
<p>Using a liquid measuring cup is the easiest way to measure fish sauce. Pour it slowly to avoid spills and check at eye level for accuracy. For smaller quantities, a kitchen scale set to ounces ensures precision. If your recipe calls for 1.33 cups, weighing out 10.64 ounces guarantees consistency. This method is especially useful for air fryer marinades and sauces.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for Fish Sauce in Air Fryer Recipes</h2>  
<p>Fish sauce elevates everything from meats to vegetables in the air fryer. It’s a key ingredient in marinades for chicken, shrimp, and even crispy tofu. A balanced blend of fish sauce, garlic, and lime can transform simple ingredients into restaurant-quality dishes.

<h3>Tips for Storing Fish Sauce</h3>  
<p>Fish sauce has a long shelf life but should be stored in a cool, dark place to maintain quality. Once opened, keeping it tightly sealed prevents oxidation and odours. If you use it frequently, transferring it to a smaller bottle can make measuring easier. Always wipe the rim clean to avoid sticky residues that could affect future measurements.</p>  

<h2>Converting Other Liquid Ingredients for Air Fryer Recipes</h2>  
<p>Just like fish sauce, other liquids like soy sauce or vinegar often need conversion for air fryer recipes. A general rule is that 1 cup of liquid equals 8 ounces, but thicker sauces may vary slightly. For sticky ingredients like honey or syrup, warming them slightly ensures accurate measuring.

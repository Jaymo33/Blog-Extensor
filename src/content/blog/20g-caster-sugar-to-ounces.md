<p>20 grams of caster sugar is equivalent to approximately 0.71 ounces. This conversion is essential for precise baking, especially when using an air fryer where measurements can make or break a recipe. Whether you're whipping up cakes or cookies, knowing how to convert grams to ounces ensures consistent results every time.</p>

<h2>Why accurate sugar measurements matter in air fryer baking</h2>
<p>Air fryers cook food faster and more evenly than conventional ovens, but this also means small measurement errors can have a big impact. Too much sugar can cause over-browning or even burning, while too little can leave your bakes tasting bland. By converting 20g of caster sugar to ounces accurately, you’ll achieve the perfect balance of sweetness and texture.</p>

<h2>How to measure 20g of caster sugar without scales</h2>
<p>Not everyone has a kitchen scale handy, but there are still ways to measure 20g of caster sugar accurately. One tablespoon of caster sugar typically weighs around 12.5g, so 1.5 tablespoons will give you roughly 20g. Alternatively, a standard UK teaspoon holds about 4.2g, meaning just under 5 teaspoons will do the trick.</p>
<p>If you’re working with ounces, remember that 0.71 ounces is slightly less than three-quarters of an ounce. A digital scale is always the most precise option, but these approximations work well in a pinch.

<h3>Common mistakes when converting grams to ounces</h3>
<p>One of the biggest mistakes people make is confusing fluid ounces with weight ounces. Caster sugar should always be measured by weight, not volume. Another pitfall is rounding too early—0.71 ounces is more precise than 0.7, especially in delicate bakes. Always double-check your conversions to avoid disappointment.</p>

<h2>Best air fryer recipes using 20g of caster sugar</h2>

<h3>Storing caster sugar for air fryer baking</h3>
<p>To keep your caster sugar fresh and ready for precise measurements, store it in an airtight container in a cool, dry place. Humidity can cause clumping, which makes measuring 20g accurately more difficult. Proper storage ensures your sugar stays free-flowing and easy to measure, whether you’re using grams or ounces.</p>

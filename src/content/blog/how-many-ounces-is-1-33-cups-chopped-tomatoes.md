<p>1.33 cups of chopped tomatoes equals approximately 10.64 ounces. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements can make or break a dish. Whether you're making a saucy pasta or a roasted tomato side, knowing the exact weight ensures consistency. For more air fryer conversions, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>
<p>Air fryers rely on even heat distribution, so ingredient quantities must be spot-on. Too many chopped tomatoes could lead to excess moisture, while too few might leave your dish dry. This is especially crucial for recipes like stuffed tomatoes or tomato-based sauces. Visit <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> for recipes that balance flavours perfectly. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a> includes tested measurements for foolproof results.</p>
<p>Chopped tomatoes vary in density, so weighing them removes guesswork. A packed cup will weigh more than a loosely filled one, affecting cooking times. For vegetable-heavy dishes, browse our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable category</a> for inspiration. The air fryer's rapid air circulation means every gram counts towards that perfect crisp or tenderness.</p>

<h3>How to measure chopped tomatoes correctly</h3>
<p>Use a dry measuring cup for chopped tomatoes, gently filling without compacting. Level off the top with a straight edge for accuracy. For 1.33 cups, you'll need about 3 medium tomatoes, chopped. This equals roughly 300 grams or 10.64 ounces, ideal for most air fryer portions.</p>

<h2>Converting cups to ounces for different tomato preparations</h2>
<p>While 1.33 cups of chopped tomatoes equals 10.64 ounces, other forms differ. Diced tomatoes pack slightly tighter, weighing about 11 ounces for the same volume. Crushed tomatoes measure closer to 11.5 ounces per 1.33 cups due to reduced air pockets. Find tomato-based recipes in our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable section</a>.</p>
<p>For canned chopped tomatoes, drain excess liquid before measuring. The weight will then align closer to fresh. Always check labels, as some brands list net weight including juice. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning guide</a> helps manage tomato stains post-cooking.</p>

<h3>Adjusting air fryer recipes with tomato measurements</h3>
<p>When a recipe calls for 1.33 cups of chopped tomatoes (10.64 ounces), stick to this for best results. Increase quantities evenly if scaling up, maintaining the air fryer's 80% capacity rule. Too many tomatoes can steam rather than roast, altering texture.</p>

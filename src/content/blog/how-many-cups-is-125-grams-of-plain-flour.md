<p>125 grams of plain flour equals approximately 1 cup in the UK and just under 1 cup (around 0.98 cups) in the US. This slight difference is due to varying cup sizes between regions, so it's always best to weigh flour for accuracy, especially when using an air fryer for baking.</p>  

<h2>Why Measuring Flour Accurately Matters</h2>  
<p>Getting the right amount of flour is crucial for baking success, whether you're making cakes, bread, or air fryer cookies. Too much flour can make your baked goods dense, while too little can leave them crumbly. Using a kitchen scale is the most precise method, but if you don't have one, measuring cups can work with a few adjustments.</p>  

<p>For air fryer recipes, consistency is key. A slight variation in flour quantity can affect cooking times and textures. That's why <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>our conversion chart</a> is a handy tool to keep nearby. It helps you switch between grams and cups effortlessly, ensuring your recipes turn out perfectly every time.</p>  

<h3>UK vs. US Cup Measurements</h3>  
<p>In the UK, 1 cup of plain flour is typically 125 grams, making the conversion straightforward. However, in the US, 1 cup of plain flour weighs around 128 grams. This means 125 grams of plain flour is just under 1 US cup. Always check where your recipe originates to avoid confusion.</p>  

<h2>How to Measure 125 Grams of Plain Flour Without a Scale</h2>  
<p>If you don't have a scale, you can still measure 125 grams of plain flour using cups. First, fluff the flour with a spoon to aerate it, then lightly spoon it into the measuring cup. Level it off with a straight edge, like a knife, for accuracy. Avoid scooping directly from the bag, as this compacts the flour and leads to over-measuring.</p>  

<p>For air fryer baking, precision ensures even cooking. If you're adapting a traditional recipe for your air fryer, check out <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>our air fryer recipe collection</a> for inspiration. Many of our recipes include both weight and volume measurements to make things easier.</p>  

<h3>Common Mistakes When Measuring Flour</h3>  
<p>One of the biggest mistakes is packing flour into the cup, which can add up to 20% more flour than needed. Another is using the wrong type of cupâ€”a teacup isn't the same as a standard measuring cup. Always use proper measuring tools for consistent results.</p>  

<h2>Converting Other Flour Amounts</h2>  
<p>If you're working with larger or smaller quantities, here's a quick reference: 250 grams of plain flour is about 2 UK cups or 1.96 US cups, while 60 grams is roughly half a UK cup or just under half a US cup. These conversions are handy for scaling recipes up or down.</p>  

<p>For more baking tips and conversions, explore <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>our cake recipes</a>, where precise measurements are essential. Whether you're making a classic Victoria sponge or air fryer brownies, getting the flour right is the first step to success.</p>  

<h3>Using Flour in Air Fryer Recipes</h3>  
<p>Air fryers are fantastic for baking, but they cook faster than conventional ovens. This means your measurements need to be spot-on to avoid dry or undercooked results. Always preheat your air fryer and check recipes for specific instructions.</p>  

<p>If you're new to air fryer baking, start with simple recipes like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cookies>air fryer cookies</a>. They're forgiving and a great way to practice your measuring skills. Once you're confident, you can move on to more complex bakes.</p>  

<h2>Storing Flour for Freshness</h2>  
<p>To keep your plain flour fresh, store it in an airtight container in a cool, dry place. This prevents moisture absorption, which can affect weight and texture. If you bake infrequently, consider storing flour in the freezer to extend its shelf life.</p>

<p>120 fan oven converts to approximately 140°C in a conventional oven. This simple conversion is essential for adapting recipes between different oven types, especially when using an air fryer which often follows fan oven principles. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we know how confusing temperature conversions can be, so we've created this comprehensive guide to help you bake with confidence.</p>

<h2>Understanding Fan Oven vs Conventional Oven Temperatures</h2>
<p>The key difference between fan ovens and conventional ovens lies in heat distribution. A fan oven circulates hot air using a built-in fan, cooking food more evenly and quickly. When converting 120 fan oven to conventional oven settings, you typically need to increase the temperature by 20°C. This means 120°C in a fan oven equals about 140°C in a conventional oven.</p>
<p>This conversion becomes particularly important when using air fryers, as they operate similarly to fan ovens. Many air fryer recipes at <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes</a> use fan oven temperatures, so understanding how to convert 120 fan oven to celsius for conventional ovens helps adapt these recipes perfectly.</p>

<h2>Why 120 Fan Oven Conversion Matters</h2>
<p>Precision matters in baking, and getting your 120 fan oven to conventional oven conversion right can make or break your dish. Many classic British bakes like Victoria sponge or scones often use temperatures around this mark. Converting 120 c fan oven to normal oven temperature correctly ensures your baked goods come out perfectly every time.</p>
<p>For air fryer users, this knowledge is doubly important. Since air fryers are essentially mini convection ovens, they follow similar principles to fan ovens. When you see a recipe calling for 120 fan oven to electric oven celsius conversion, you'll know exactly how to adjust it for your conventional oven or air fryer.</p>

<h3>Practical Conversion Examples</h3>
<p>Let's look at some practical applications of 120 fan oven to regular oven conversion. If a recipe suggests baking at 120°C in a fan oven, you'd set your conventional oven to 140°C. This applies whether you're baking cookies from our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cookies>cookie category</a> or roasting vegetables.</p>

<h2>Air Fryer Temperature Considerations</h2>
<p>When dealing with 120 fan oven to air fryer equivalent temperatures, the conversion is usually 1:1 since both use convection heating. However, cooking times may vary slightly due to the air fryer's smaller capacity and more intense air circulation. Always check our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for precise adjustments.</p>
<p>Remember that 120 c convection to normal oven conversion follows the same +20°C rule. This consistency makes it easier to switch between different cooking appliances while maintaining recipe integrity. Whether you're using a fan oven, conventional oven, or air fryer, understanding these conversions ensures culinary success.</p>

<h3>Special Cases and Exceptions</h3>
<p>While the 120 fan oven to traditional oven conversion generally follows the +20°C rule, there are exceptions. Delicate items like meringues or slow-cooked dishes might need finer adjustments. Always consider the specific requirements of your recipe when converting 120 c fan oven equivalent in conventional oven settings.</p>

<h2>Conversion Tips for Perfect Results</h2>
<p>To master 120 fan oven in normal oven temperature conversions, keep these tips in mind. First, invest in an oven thermometer to verify your oven's accuracy. Second, make notes of successful conversions for your favourite recipes from our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>cake category</a>. Third, remember that cooking times may need slight adjustment when converting between oven types.</p>
<p>When dealing with 120 fan oven vs standard oven differences, always err on the side of caution. Start checking for doneness a few minutes earlier than the recipe suggests, especially when using an air fryer where cooking times can be significantly shorter. This prevents overcooking while ensuring perfect results every time.</p>

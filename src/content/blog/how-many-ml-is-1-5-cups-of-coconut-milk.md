<p>1.5 cups of coconut milk is equivalent to 355 ml, making it easy to measure for your air fryer recipes. Whether you’re whipping up a creamy curry or a decadent dessert, precise measurements ensure the best results. Coconut milk is a staple in many dishes, and knowing how to convert cups to ml can save time and avoid kitchen mishaps. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we love helping you nail those measurements for flawless cooking every time.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>
<p>Using the right amount of coconut milk can make or break your air fryer dish. Too little, and your recipe might turn out dry; too much, and it could become soggy. The air fryer’s intense heat requires precise liquid ratios to achieve that perfect crispiness or creaminess. For example, if you’re making a Thai-inspired curry or a coconut-based dessert, 355 ml of coconut milk (1.5 cups) ensures balanced flavours and textures. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more handy measurement tips.</p>

<p>Many air fryer recipes, especially those involving sauces or batters, rely on accurate liquid measurements. Coconut milk adds richness, but its thickness can vary between brands. Measuring by millilitres eliminates guesswork, giving you consistent results. Whether you’re cooking for one or meal prepping, knowing that 1.5 cups of coconut milk equals 355 ml simplifies your kitchen routine. Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a> for inspiration on using coconut milk in your air fryer.</p>

<h3>How to Measure Coconut Milk Correctly</h3>
<p>For the most accurate measurement, use a liquid measuring cup or a kitchen scale set to ml. Stir the coconut milk well before pouring, as it can separate in the can. If your recipe calls for 1.5 cups of coconut milk (355 ml), fill the measuring cup to the 1.5 mark at eye level. For thicker recipes, like curries or soups, this precision ensures the right consistency. Need more tips? Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert recipes</a> often use coconut milk for luscious results.</p>

<h2>Converting Coconut Milk for UK and US Recipes</h2>
<p>Whether you’re following a UK or US recipe, 1.5 cups of coconut milk always translates to 355 ml. However, cup sizes can vary slightly by region, so sticking to millilitres avoids confusion. If a recipe lists coconut milk in grams, remember that 355 ml weighs roughly 340 grams, depending on the brand. This conversion is handy for baking, where precision is key.

<p>Some recipes might call for light or full-fat coconut milk, which affects the ml-to-cup ratio slightly. Full-fat coconut milk is denser, so 1.5 cups (355 ml) will be richer than its light counterpart. Always check the recipe notes to see which type is recommended. If you’re adapting a stovetop recipe for the air fryer, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning guide</a> ensures your appliance stays in top shape for every cook.</p>

<h3>Common Uses for 1.5 Cups of Coconut Milk</h3>
<p>From creamy soups to dairy-free desserts, 355 ml of coconut milk is a versatile ingredient. Try it in air-fried tofu marinades, coconut rice, or even as a base for ice cream. Its natural sweetness and richness elevate both savoury and sweet dishes. If you’re new to cooking with coconut milk, start with simple recipes and adjust to taste.

<p>20 grams of crushed garlic equals approximately 0.71 ounces. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements can make or break a dish. Whether you're preparing a garlic-infused marinade or seasoning vegetables, knowing the exact weight ensures consistency. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we help simplify conversions so you can focus on cooking delicious meals.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of crushed garlic can elevate your air fryer dishes. Too little, and the flavour falls flat; too much, and it overpowers the meal. Air fryers cook food quickly, so balanced seasoning is key. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> takes the guesswork out of measurements. Whether you're cooking chicken, vegetables, or seafood, precise garlic quantities ensure perfect results every time.</p>  

<p>Garlic is a staple in many air fryer recipes, from crispy garlic potatoes to garlic butter shrimp. Converting 20g to ounces (0.71 oz) helps when following international recipes or adjusting portion sizes. For more inspiration, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>garlic-rich recipes</a> designed specifically for air fryers. Accurate measurements also prevent waste, ensuring you use just the right amount of ingredients.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure Crushed Garlic Without a Scale</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a kitchen scale, you can estimate 20g of crushed garlic. Roughly, one medium garlic clove yields about 5g when crushed. So, 20g would be equivalent to four medium cloves. This method isn’t as precise as weighing but works in a pinch. For best results, invest in a digital scale—it’s a game-changer for air fryer cooking.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for 20g of Crushed Garlic in Air Fryer Recipes</h2>  
<p>20g of crushed garlic is perfect for marinating proteins like chicken or beef before air frying. It’s also ideal for seasoning roasted vegetables or mixing into dips. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipes</a>, you’ll find dishes where 20g of garlic adds depth and aroma. Garlic’s versatility makes it a must-have for air fryer enthusiasts.</p>  

<p>Another great use for 20g of crushed garlic is in homemade air fryer sauces or dressings. Combine it with olive oil, herbs, and a pinch of salt for a simple yet flavourful coating. For cleaning tips after cooking garlic-heavy dishes, visit our guide on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner</a>. Proper maintenance ensures your appliance stays in top condition.</p>  

<h3>Converting Other Garlic Measurements</h3>  
<p>If your recipe calls for minced or whole garlic cloves instead of crushed, conversions vary. Minced garlic is slightly denser, so 20g equals about 0.67 ounces. Whole cloves are lighter, with 20g being roughly six to eight cloves. Always adjust based on your recipe’s requirements to avoid overpowering flavours.</p>

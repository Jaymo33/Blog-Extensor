<p>0.75 cup of caster sugar equals approximately 5.3 ounces (150 grams). This conversion is essential for precise baking, especially when using an air fryer for desserts. Whether you're whipping up cakes, cookies, or meringues, getting the sugar measurement right ensures perfect texture and sweetness.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Sugar Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Baking is a science, and even small measurement errors can affect your results. Too much sugar can make desserts overly sweet or cause uneven browning in your air fryer. Too little can leave them bland or dry. Using the correct weight (5.3 ounces for 0.75 cup) ensures consistency. For more air fryer baking tips, check out <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>our recipe collection</a>.</p>  

<p>In the UK, caster sugar is finer than granulated but coarser than icing sugar. Its texture dissolves quickly, making it ideal for air fryer recipes like sponges or soufflés. If you're adapting a US recipe, remember that UK cups measure slightly differently. Always weigh your ingredients for accuracy.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure 0.75 Cup of Caster Sugar</h3>  
<p>Use a dry measuring cup for the most precise 0.75 cup measurement. Spoon the sugar into the cup lightly—don’t pack it down—and level it off with a knife. For air fryer recipes, a kitchen scale is even better. Set it to ounces, tare the weight, and add sugar until you hit 5.3 ounces.</p>  

<h2>Converting 0.75 Cup Caster Sugar to Other Units</h2>  
<p>Besides ounces, you might need grams or tablespoons. Here’s a quick reference: 0.75 cup caster sugar = 5.3 oz = 150g = 12 tbsp. Bookmark <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>our conversion chart</a> for easy access. These measurements are handy when scaling recipes up or down for your air fryer.</p>  

<p>If you’re baking in batches, note that 1.5 cups of caster sugar would be 10.6 oz (300g). For larger quantities, multiply accordingly. Always preheat your air fryer to ensure even cooking, especially for sugar-heavy recipes like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>cakes</a> or cookies.</p>  

<h3>Common Mistakes When Measuring Sugar</h3>  
<p>Avoid scooping sugar directly from the bag with your measuring cup—this compacts it and leads to excess. Instead, fluff the sugar first with a fork. Also, don’t confuse caster sugar with powdered or granulated sugar. Each type weighs differently, so using the wrong one can throw off your recipe.</p>  

<h2>Air Fryer Recipes Using 0.75 Cup Caster Sugar</h2>  
<p>Many air fryer desserts call for 0.75 cup of caster sugar. Try classics like vanilla cupcakes or lemon drizzle cake. The air fryer’s rapid circulation ensures even baking, but precise measurements are key. For a deeper clean after sugary bakes, use <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>our recommended cleaner</a>.</p>  

<p>For healthier options, you can reduce the sugar slightly—but don’t go below 4.5 oz (0.6 cup), or the texture may suffer. Pair your treats with <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>other air fryer desserts</a> for a balanced spread. Always let sugary dishes cool before removing them from the basket to avoid sticking.</p>

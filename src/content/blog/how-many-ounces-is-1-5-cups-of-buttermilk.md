<p>1.5 cups of buttermilk equals 12 fluid ounces (or approximately 340 grams). Whether you're preparing a marinade, baking a cake, or whipping up a batch of fluffy pancakes in your air fryer, knowing this conversion ensures your recipes turn out just right. Precise measurements are key, especially when working with buttermilk, as its thickness can affect the outcome of your dish.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Using the correct amount of buttermilk is crucial for achieving the desired texture and flavour in your recipes. Too much can make your batter too runny, while too little may leave your dish dry. For air fryer recipes, consistency is even more important, as the cooking process relies on even heat distribution. A slight variation in liquid measurements can impact how your food cooks, so it's best to measure carefully.</p>  

<p>If you're using an air fryer for baking, like making buttermilk biscuits or a moist cake, the 1.5 cups to ounces conversion ensures your batter isn't too thick or thin. For more air fryer-friendly recipes, check out our collection at <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes</a>.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure Buttermilk Correctly</h3>  
<p>To measure 1.5 cups of buttermilk accurately, use a liquid measuring cup with clear markings. Pour the buttermilk up to the 1.5-cup line, ensuring it sits level for an exact measurement. If you don't have a measuring cup, a kitchen scale can help—simply weigh out 12 ounces (340 grams) for the equivalent amount.</p>  

<h2>Converting Buttermilk for Different Recipes</h2>  
<p>Buttermilk is a versatile ingredient used in everything from fried chicken marinades to fluffy pancakes. If your recipe calls for 1.5 cups of buttermilk but you only have a scale, knowing it's 12 ounces saves time and hassle. This conversion is especially useful for air fryer cooking, where precision ensures crispy, evenly cooked results.</p>  

<p>For more air fryer measurement tips, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>. It covers everything from cups to grams, making it easier to adapt recipes for your air fryer.</p>  

<h3>Common Uses for 1.5 Cups of Buttermilk</h3>  
<p>This measurement is often found in recipes like buttermilk fried chicken, pancakes, and moist cakes. In an air fryer, buttermilk helps create a crispy coating while keeping the meat tender. If you're making a batch of buttermilk biscuits, 1.5 cups (12 ounces) is the perfect amount for a light, fluffy texture.</p>  

<h2>Substitutes for Buttermilk</h2>  
<p>If you don't have buttermilk on hand, you can make a substitute by mixing 1.5 cups of milk with 1.5 tablespoons of lemon juice or vinegar. Let it sit for 5 minutes before using. While this won't be identical to real buttermilk, it works well in most recipes, including those for your air fryer.</p>

<h3>Storing Leftover Buttermilk</h3>  
<p>If you have leftover buttermilk after measuring out 1.5 cups, store it in an airtight container in the fridge for up to two weeks. You can also freeze it in ice cube trays for future use—just thaw and measure as needed for your next air fryer recipe.</p>

<p>2 cups of tahini equals approximately 16 ounces (or 1 pound). This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precision matters, ensuring your dishes turn out perfectly every time. Whether you're making a creamy tahini dip or a marinade, knowing the exact weight helps maintain consistency.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on even cooking, and incorrect ingredient quantities can throw off texture and flavour. Tahini, a thick sesame paste, is often used in dressings, sauces, and even baked goods. Measuring it correctly ensures your recipes, like those on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, turn out just right.</p>  

<p>Using weight (ounces) instead of volume (cups) is more reliable, especially for dense ingredients like tahini. A kitchen scale is a great tool for this, but if you don’t have one, our conversion guide will help. For more air fryer measurement tips, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>  

<h3>How to measure tahini without a scale</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a scale, use the spoon-and-level method for tahini. Stir the tahini well to loosen it, then spoon it into a measuring cup and level it off. Remember, 2 cups of tahini to ounces is roughly 16 oz, but slight variations can occur based on density.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for tahini in air fryer recipes</h2>  
<p>Tahini adds richness to many dishes, from marinades to desserts. Try it in air-fried falafel, tahini-glazed vegetables, or even as a base for sauces. For inspiration, browse our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable recipes</a> featuring tahini.</p>  

<p>It’s also a key ingredient in Middle Eastern-inspired dishes, like air-fried halloumi with tahini drizzle. The creamy texture pairs perfectly with crispy air-fried foods. If you're new to cooking with tahini, start with simple recipes and adjust measurements as needed.</p>  

<h3>Converting other tahini measurements</h3>  
<p>Need to convert smaller amounts? Half a cup of tahini is about 4 ounces, while 1 cup equals 8 ounces. These conversions are handy for scaling recipes up or down. For more precise measurements, always weigh your ingredients.</p>  

<h2>Storing tahini for air fryer recipes</h2>  
<p>Tahini can separate over time, so always stir it well before measuring. Store it in a cool, dark place or the fridge to extend its shelf life. If it hardens, let it sit at room temperature or warm it slightly before use.</p>  

<p>For best results in air fryer cooking, use fresh tahini. Older tahini can develop a bitter taste, affecting your dish. Check out our guide on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>keeping your air fryer clean</a> when working with sticky ingredients like tahini.</p>  

<h3>Frequently asked tahini measurement questions</h3>  
<p>Many cooks wonder if tahini weight varies by brand. While most tahini is similar in density, some brands may be slightly thicker. Always check the label for weight guidelines if available. For more air fryer tips, visit <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>.</p>

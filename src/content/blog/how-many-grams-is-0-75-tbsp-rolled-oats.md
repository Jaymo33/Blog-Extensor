    "@type": "Answer",
    "text": "Yes, but the weight differs slightly. Instant oats are more finely cut, so 0.75 tbsp weighs about 5 grams instead of 5.6 grams for rolled oats. In air fryer recipes, this small difference usually doesn't affect results, but for baking, stick to the specified oat type."

    "@type": "Answer",
    "text": "0.75 tbsp (5.6g) of rolled oats provides similar bulk to breadcrumbs but with more fibre and nutrients. In air fryer coatings, oats create a slightly denser, nuttier crust. They absorb less oil than breadcrumbs, making them a healthier alternative for crispy textures."

    "acceptedAnswer": {
    "@type": "Answer",
    "text": "Typically no, as 0.75 tbsp is a small quantity that cooks quickly. However, if using oats as a coating, check a few minutes early as they brown faster than breadcrumbs. Most air fryer recipes account for this in their timing guidelines."

    "@type": "Answer",
    "text": "Not directly, as flour lacks the texture and binding properties of oats. For coatings, mix 0.75 tbsp oats with a teaspoon of flour if needed. In batters, you'd need to adjust liquids too, as oats absorb more moisture than flour."

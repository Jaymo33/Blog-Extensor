<p>135 ml of tomato sauce equals approximately 0.57 cups in the US measurement system or 0.48 cups in the UK. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precision matters. Whether you're making a pasta sauce or a marinade, knowing the exact measurement ensures your dish turns out perfectly every time.</p>  

<h2>Understanding Tomato Sauce Measurements</h2>  
<p>Tomato sauce is a staple in many recipes, from pasta dishes to casseroles. Measuring it accurately is crucial, especially when using an air fryer, where ingredient ratios can affect cooking times. A 135 ml measurement is common in many recipes, but converting it to cups can be tricky if you're not familiar with the differences between US and UK measurements.</p>  
<p>In the US, 1 cup equals 240 ml, while in the UK, 1 cup is 284 ml. This means 135 ml of tomato sauce converts to roughly 0.57 US cups or 0.48 UK cups.

<h3>Why Accurate Measurements Matter</h3>  
<p>Using the right amount of tomato sauce ensures your dish isn't too dry or overly saucy. In air fryer cooking, excess liquid can lead to steaming instead of crisping, while too little can dry out your food. Measuring 135 ml of tomato sauce correctly helps maintain the perfect balance for dishes like air-fried meatballs or stuffed peppers.</p>  

<h2>Converting 135 ml of Tomato Sauce to Cups</h2>  
<p>If you're working with a recipe that lists tomato sauce in millilitres but prefer using cups, here's how to do it. For US cups, divide 135 ml by 240 ml (the volume of 1 US cup) to get 0.57 cups. For UK cups, divide 135 ml by 284 ml to get 0.48 cups. This small difference can impact your cooking, so always double-check which system your recipe uses.</p>

<p>135 ml of tomato sauce equals approximately 0.57 cups in the US measurement system or 0.48 cups in the UK. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precision matters. Whether you're making a pasta sauce or a marinade, knowing the exact measurement ensures your dish turns out perfectly every time.</p>  

<h2>Understanding Tomato Sauce Measurements</h2>  
<p>Tomato sauce is a staple in many recipes, from pasta dishes to casseroles. Measuring it accurately is crucial, especially when using an air fryer, where ingredient ratios can affect cooking times. A 135 ml measurement is common in many recipes, but converting it to cups can be tricky if you're not familiar with the differences between US and UK measurements.</p>  
<p>In the US, 1 cup equals 240 ml, while in the UK, 1 cup is 284 ml. This means 135 ml of tomato sauce converts to roughly 0.57 US cups or 0.48 UK cups. For air fryer recipes, sticking to one measurement system avoids inconsistencies. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more handy tips.</p>  

<h3>Why Accurate Measurements Matter</h3>  
<p>Using the right amount of tomato sauce ensures your dish isn't too dry or overly saucy. In air fryer cooking, excess liquid can lead to steaming instead of crisping, while too little can dry out your food. Measuring 135 ml of tomato sauce correctly helps maintain the perfect balance for dishes like air-fried meatballs or stuffed peppers.</p>  

<h2>Converting 135 ml of Tomato Sauce to Cups</h2>  
<p>If you're working with a recipe that lists tomato sauce in millilitres but prefer using cups, here's how to do it. For US cups, divide 135 ml by 240 ml (the volume of 1 US cup) to get 0.57 cups. For UK cups, divide 135 ml by 284 ml to get 0.48 cups. This small difference can impact your cooking, so always double-check which system your recipe uses.</p>  
<p>For more recipe ideas using precise measurements, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipe collection</a>. Whether you're making a classic marinara or a spicy arrabbiata, getting the tomato sauce right is key.</p>  

<h3>Tips for Measuring Tomato Sauce</h3>  
<p>When measuring 135 ml of tomato sauce, use a liquid measuring cup for accuracy. Pour the sauce to the desired line at eye level to avoid over- or under-pouring. If you don't have a measuring cup, a kitchen scale can helpâ€”135 ml of tomato sauce weighs roughly 135 grams. For sticky sauces, lightly grease the measuring cup to ensure easy pouring.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for 135 ml of Tomato Sauce</h2>  
<p>This quantity is perfect for single-serving dishes or as a base for larger meals. In the air fryer, 135 ml of tomato sauce can coat chicken breasts, top mini pizzas, or mix into meatloaf. It's also ideal for <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipes</a>, where the sauce adds moisture and flavour without overwhelming the dish.</p>  
<p>For vegetarian options, try using 135 ml of tomato sauce in stuffed mushrooms or roasted veggie trays. The precise measurement ensures even cooking and balanced flavours.

<h3>Adjusting Recipes for Different Quantities</h3>  
<p>If your recipe calls for more or less than 135 ml of tomato sauce, scale the conversion accordingly. For example, 270 ml would be 1.14 US cups or 0.95 UK cups. Always adjust other ingredients proportionally to maintain the dish's integrity. This is especially important in air fryer cooking, where ingredient ratios affect texture and doneness.</p>

<p>0.375 cup of shredded coconut equals approximately 1.5 ounces. This conversion is handy for air fryer recipes where precise measurements matter. Whether you’re making coconut shrimp or a tropical dessert, knowing the weight ensures perfect results every time. For more air fryer tips, visit <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on even cooking, and incorrect measurements can lead to uneven results. Shredded coconut, for instance, can clump or burn if not measured properly. Using ounces instead of cups ensures consistency, especially for recipes like coconut-crusted chicken or baked goods. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more handy tips.</p>  
<p>Many UK cooks prefer weighing ingredients for accuracy, and 0.375 cup of shredded coconut is no exception. This small but crucial measurement pops up in recipes like macaroons or granola. If you’re unsure, a kitchen scale is your best friend. Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a> for coconut-inspired dishes.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure Shredded Coconut Without a Scale</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a scale, fluff the shredded coconut lightly before scooping. Packing it down can lead to over-measuring. For 0.375 cup, fill a half-cup measure halfway and remove a tablespoon. This method works well for air fryer recipes like coconut shrimp or crispy tofu. Need more ideas? Browse our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert category</a>.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for 0.375 Cup Shredded Coconut</h2>  
<p>This measurement often appears in smaller-batch recipes, like air fryer cookies or energy bites. It’s enough to add texture without overwhelming other flavours. For a tropical twist, try it in <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken dishes</a> or sprinkled over roasted vegetables.</p>  
<p>Shredded coconut also works wonders in air fryer granola or as a coating for fish. Since 0.375 cup equals 1.5 ounces, you can easily adjust recipes up or down. For cleaning tips after sticky coconut recipes, visit <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>our cleaner guide</a>.</p>  

<h3>Storing Shredded Coconut for Freshness</h3>  
<p>Keep opened shredded coconut in an airtight container to prevent drying. If your 0.375 cup measurement feels stale, toast it lightly in the air fryer for 2 minutes at 160°C. This revives the flavour for recipes like coconut-crusted prawns or muffins.</p>

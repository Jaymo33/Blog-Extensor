<h2>How to Measure Coconut Oil for Air Fryer Recipes</h2>
<p>Coconut oil can be tricky to measure because it changes consistency with temperature. At room temperature, it’s solid, but it melts into a liquid when heated. To measure 1.25 cups (295.74 ml) accurately, use a liquid measuring jug for melted oil or pack solid oil tightly into a dry measuring cup.</p>
<p>For recipes like air-fried coconut tofu from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/tofu>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, melting the oil first ensures even coating. If you’re using solid coconut oil, gently warm it until it’s soft enough to measure precisely. This method guarantees your dishes have the perfect balance of moisture and crispiness.</p>

<h3>UK vs. US Cup Measurements</h3>
<p>It’s worth noting that UK and US cup measurements differ slightly. A UK cup is 284 ml, while a US cup is 240 ml. However, most modern recipes, including those on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, use the US standard. Always check which measurement system your recipe follows to avoid discrepancies.</p>

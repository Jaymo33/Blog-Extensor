<p>0.5 cups of olive oil equals approximately 118 ml. This conversion is essential for precise cooking and baking, especially when using an air fryer where exact measurements can make all the difference. Whether you’re following a recipe from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> or improvising, knowing this conversion ensures consistent results.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Frying</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on precise ingredient ratios to achieve the perfect texture and flavour. Too much or too little olive oil can affect crispiness, browning, and overall taste. For example, recipes like air-fried potatoes or roasted vegetables often call for 0.5 cups of olive oil in ml to ensure even coating. Using the correct measurement prevents soggy or overly dry results, making your dishes restaurant-quality every time.</p>

Whether you’re cooking chicken, salmon, or even baking cakes, accuracy is key to air fryer success.</p>  

<h2>Converting 0.5 Cups of Olive Oil to ml</h2>  
<p>The standard conversion for 0.5 cups of olive oil is 118 ml. This applies to both UK and US measurements, though slight variations can occur based on oil density. For most cooking purposes, 118 ml is the go-to measurement. If you’re scaling recipes up or down, remember that 1 cup equals 237 ml, making it easy to adjust quantities as needed.</p>  
<p>When preparing dishes like air-fried shrimp or roasted vegetables, using 0.5 cups of olive oil in ml ensures even distribution.

<h3>Tips for Measuring Olive Oil Accurately</h3>

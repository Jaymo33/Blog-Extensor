<p>835 ml of heavy cream is approximately 3.5 cups. This conversion is essential for baking, cooking, and especially when using an air fryer, where precise measurements can make or break a recipe. Whether you're whipping up a creamy sauce or a decadent dessert, knowing how to convert millilitres to cups ensures accuracy in your kitchen.</p>  

<h2>Understanding the Conversion</h2>  
<p>Converting millilitres to cups can be tricky, especially when dealing with liquids like heavy cream. The general rule is that 1 cup equals 240 ml, but slight variations exist depending on the ingredient's density.

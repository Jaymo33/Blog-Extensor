<p>1.25 cups of self-raising flour equals approximately 156 grams. This conversion is essential for precise baking, especially when using an air fryer where measurements can make or break a recipe. Whether you’re whipping up air fryer cakes or fluffy scones, knowing the exact gram measurement ensures consistency. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we focus on accuracy to help you achieve perfect results every time.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Flour Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Baking is a science, and even small measurement discrepancies can affect texture and rise. Self-raising flour contains baking powder, so incorrect quantities may lead to dense or overly airy results. For air fryer recipes, where heat distribution is rapid, precision is even more critical. A slight variation in flour weight can alter cooking times and outcomes. That’s why converting 1.25 cups of self-raising flour to grams (156g) is a game-changer for reliable baking.</p>  

<p>Many bakers prefer weighing ingredients over using cups for better consistency. Cups can vary based on how flour is scooped or packed, leading to inconsistencies. Grams provide a universal standard, making it easier to follow recipes from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes</a> or any other source. Whether you’re baking in the UK or the US, this conversion ensures your air fryer treats turn out perfectly every time.</p>  

<h2>How to Measure 1.25 Cups of Self-Raising Flour Correctly</h2>  
<p>To measure 1.25 cups of self-raising flour accurately, fluff the flour in its container first to prevent compaction. Spoon it lightly into a measuring cup without pressing down, then level off the excess with a straight edge. This method avoids overpacking, which could lead to using more flour than intended. For the most precise results, a kitchen scale is ideal—simply weigh out 156 grams for 1.25 cups.</p>  

<h3>Using a Kitchen Scale for Best Results</h3>  
<p>A digital kitchen scale removes guesswork and ensures you’re using the exact amount of self-raising flour required. Place your bowl on the scale, tare it to zero, then add flour until it reaches 156 grams. This method is especially useful for air fryer baking, where precision impacts texture and cooking time. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air-fryer conversion chart</a> for more handy measurement guides.</p>  

<h2>Common Baking Conversions for Air Fryer Recipes</h2>  
<p>Beyond self-raising flour, other ingredients often need converting for air fryer recipes. For example, 1 cup of granulated sugar is roughly 200 grams, while butter is about 227 grams per cup. Having these conversions on hand simplifies baking and ensures consistency. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we provide detailed guides to help you master air fryer cooking with confidence.</p>  

<p>If you’re experimenting with cakes or bread in your air fryer, accurate measurements are non-negotiable. A slight deviation in flour weight can affect rise and moisture levels. That’s why knowing that 1.25 cups of self-raising flour equals 156 grams is so valuable. For more baking tips, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>cake recipes</a> tailored for air fryers.</p>  

<h3>Adjusting Recipes for Different Flour Types</h3>  
<p>If a recipe calls for plain flour instead of self-raising, adjustments are needed. Self-raising flour includes a raising agent, so substituting it with plain flour requires adding baking powder. For every 150g of plain flour, mix in 1.5 teaspoons of baking powder to mimic self-raising flour. This tweak ensures your air fryer bakes rise perfectly, just like the original recipe intended.</p>  

<h2>Tips for Perfect Air Fryer Baking</h2>  
<p>Preheating your air fryer is crucial for even baking, just like a conventional oven. Most air fryer cake recipes benefit from a quick preheat to ensure consistent heat distribution. Additionally, avoid overcrowding the basket to allow proper airflow around your bake. For easy cleanup, consider using <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer liners</a> to prevent sticking and simplify post-cooking maintenance.</p>  

<p>Timing is another critical factor—air fryers cook faster than traditional ovens, so keep a close eye on your bakes. Start checking a few minutes before the recipe suggests to avoid overbaking. With precise measurements like 1.25 cups of self-raising flour converted to 156 grams, your air fryer creations will turn out light, fluffy, and delicious every time.</p>

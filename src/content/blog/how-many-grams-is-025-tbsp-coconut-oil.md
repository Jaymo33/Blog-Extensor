<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on hot air circulation to cook food evenly, and small variations in ingredient quantities can affect texture and taste. Coconut oil, often used for its high smoke point and mild flavour, needs precise measurement. Too much oil can make food greasy, while too little may cause sticking or uneven browning. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> simplifies these calculations for hassle-free cooking.</p>  

<p>Many air fryer recipes, especially baked goods like those in our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>cake category</a>, require exact oil measurements. 0.25 tbsp of coconut oil (3.7 grams) is a common small quantity used for greasing pans or adding moisture. Understanding this conversion helps adapt traditional recipes to air fryer settings without guesswork.</p>  

<h2>How to measure 0.25 tbsp of coconut oil accurately</h2>  
<p>Measuring small amounts like 0.25 tbsp can be tricky without the right tools. For coconut oil, which solidifies at cooler temperatures, we recommend using a digital kitchen scale for the most accurate gram measurement. If you don't have one, fill a 1 tbsp measure halfway and then halve that portion visually.

<p>135 ml of almond milk equals approximately 0.57 cups. This conversion is handy when following recipes, especially for air fryer dishes where precise measurements matter. Whether you're whipping up a cake or a creamy sauce, knowing how to convert ml to cups ensures your dish turns out just right.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of almond milk can make or break your recipe. Too much liquid can lead to soggy results, while too little might dry out your dish. Air fryers circulate hot air, so ingredients like almond milk need to be measured precisely for even cooking. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more handy measurement tips.</p>  

<p>Almond milk is a popular dairy-free alternative, but its consistency can vary between brands. Measuring 135 ml of almond milk in cups ensures consistency, whether you're making pancakes or a creamy pasta sauce. For more recipe ideas, visit our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipes section</a>.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure 135 ml of Almond Milk Without a Measuring Cup</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a measuring cup, you can use a standard tablespoon. 135 ml is roughly 9 tablespoons of almond milk. Alternatively, a kitchen scale can help—135 ml weighs about 135 grams. For baking, precision is key, so investing in proper tools is worth it.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for 135 ml of Almond Milk in Air Fryer Recipes</h2>  
<p>This measurement often appears in small-batch recipes, like single-serve cakes or sauces. For example, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert recipes</a> often call for 135 ml of almond milk to keep things light and moist. It’s also great for marinating tofu or making a creamy dip.</p>  

<p>When reheating leftovers, a splash of almond milk (around 135 ml) can revive dried-out dishes. Try it with pasta or casseroles in your air fryer. Just remember, too much liquid can make things soggy, so stick to the recommended 0.57 cups.</p>  

<h3>Converting 135 ml of Almond Milk for US and UK Recipes</h3>  
<p>In the UK, a standard cup is 250 ml, while in the US, it’s 240 ml. This means 135 ml of almond milk is slightly more than half a UK cup (0.54 cups) and just over half a US cup (0.56 cups). For most recipes, the difference is negligible, but for baking, it’s good to know.</p>  

<h2>Tips for Storing and Using Almond Milk in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Almond milk can separate when stored, so always shake it well before measuring. If your recipe calls for 135 ml of almond milk, use it straight from the fridge for best results. For longer storage, freeze it in 135 ml portions—handy for future <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/breakfast>breakfast recipes</a>.</p>  

<p>Cleaning your air fryer after using almond milk is easy with our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner guide</a>. Almond milk can leave a slight residue, so a quick wipe-down keeps your appliance in top shape. Now you’re ready to cook with confidence!</p>

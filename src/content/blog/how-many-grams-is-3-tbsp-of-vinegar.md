<p>3 tablespoons (tbsp) of vinegar weigh approximately 45 grams (g). This conversion is essential for precise air fryer cooking, ensuring your recipes turn out perfectly every time. Whether you’re marinating chicken, dressing a salad, or whipping up a tangy sauce, knowing the exact weight helps avoid guesswork.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate vinegar measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of vinegar can make or break a dish. Too little, and your marinade might lack punch; too much, and it could overpower other flavours. In air fryer cooking, where ingredients cook quickly and evenly, precision is key. For example, a recipe like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer honey mustard chicken</a> relies on balanced acidity to enhance taste.</p>  

<p>Vinegar’s density can vary slightly depending on type (e.g., white, apple cider, or balsamic), but 3 tbsp generally equals around 45g. This consistency makes it easy to follow UK-based recipes without needing scales for small quantities.

<h3>Types of vinegar and their weights</h3>  
<p>While most vinegars weigh roughly the same per tablespoon, some thicker varieties, like balsamic glaze, may differ slightly. Standard white or apple cider vinegar averages 15g per tbsp, so 3 tbsp equals 45g. For precise results, especially in recipes like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>air fryer chicken wings</a>, weighing ensures consistency.</p>  

<h2>How to measure 3 tbsp of vinegar without scales</h2>  
<p>If you don’t have a kitchen scale, use standard measuring spoons for accuracy. Fill the tablespoon to the brim without overflowing, levelling off with a knife. Three level tablespoons will give you close to 45g. For sticky vinegars, like balsamic, lightly grease the spoon to help it slide off easily.</p>  

<p>Another tip is to use a liquid measuring cup marked in millilitres (ml). Since 1 tbsp equals 15ml, 3 tbsp is 45ml. While ml measure volume, not weight, this method works well for most air fryer recipes, such as <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>roasted vegetables</a> with a vinegar glaze.</p>  

<h3>Common recipes using 3 tbsp of vinegar</h3>  
<p>Many air fryer dishes call for 3 tbsp of vinegar, from tangy BBQ sauces to quick-pickled veggies. For example, a classic <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer pulled pork</a> might use 3 tbsp apple cider vinegar in its rub. Knowing the gram equivalent helps adjust recipes or scale them up without hassle.</p>

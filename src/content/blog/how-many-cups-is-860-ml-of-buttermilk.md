<p>860 ml of buttermilk is approximately 3.63 cups. This conversion is essential for anyone using recipes that require precise measurements, especially when baking or preparing dishes in an air fryer. Whether you're making fluffy pancakes or a tangy marinade, knowing how to convert 860 ml of buttermilk to cups ensures your dish turns out perfectly every time.</p>  

<h2>Understanding the Conversion</h2>  
<p>Converting millilitres to cups can be tricky, but it's straightforward once you know the ratio. One standard metric cup holds 240 ml of liquid. Therefore, to find out how many cups 860 ml of buttermilk equals, you simply divide 860 by 240. The result is roughly 3.63 cups, which you can round to 3 and 2/3 cups for practicality.</p>  

<p>This conversion is particularly useful for air fryer recipes, where precision can affect cooking times and textures. For example, if you're making buttermilk-battered chicken in your air fryer, accurate measurements ensure the coating crisps up just right.

<h3>Why Accuracy Matters in Baking</h3>  
<p>Baking is a science, and even small measurement errors can lead to disappointing results. Using the correct amount of buttermilk—whether 860 ml or another quantity—ensures your cakes rise properly and your batters have the right consistency. For air fryer baking, such as scones or muffins, precise measurements are equally crucial for even cooking.</p>

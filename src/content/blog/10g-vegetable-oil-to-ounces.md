<h2>Why accurate oil measurements matter in air frying</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of oil in your air fryer is crucial for achieving crispy, golden results without excess grease. Too little oil can leave food dry, while too much can make it soggy. Converting 10g of vegetable oil to ounces (0.35 oz) helps you strike the perfect balance. Many air fryer recipes, like those in our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipes section</a>, rely on precise oil measurements for optimal texture and flavour.</p>

<h3>How to measure 10g of vegetable oil without scales</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a kitchen scale, you can still measure 10g of vegetable oil (0.35 oz) using common household items. One teaspoon holds roughly 5g of oil, so two teaspoons will give you approximately 10g. A tablespoon, on the other hand, holds about 15g, so you’ll need just under a tablespoon for 10g. This method is handy for quick adjustments when following air fryer recipes.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for 10g of vegetable oil in air frying</h2>  
<p>Many air fryer dishes call for small amounts of oil to enhance crispiness. For example, 10g of vegetable oil (0.35 oz) is perfect for coating a batch of homemade chips or crispy chicken wings. It’s also ideal for lightly greasing the air fryer basket to prevent sticking. Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/potatoes>potato recipes</a> for delicious ways to use this measurement.</p>  

<p>Vegetable oil isn’t just for savoury dishes—it’s also used in air fryer baking. A 10g portion (0.35 oz) can help keep cakes and muffins moist while ensuring even cooking.

Remember, precise measurements like 10g to ounces ensure your bakes turn out perfectly every time.</p>  

<h3>Converting other oil quantities for air frying</h3>

<p>20 grams of milk is approximately 0.7 ounces. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precision matters, especially when baking cakes or preparing creamy sauces. Whether you're following a recipe from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> or experimenting with your own creations, knowing how to convert grams to ounces ensures consistency.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on precise ingredient ratios to achieve the perfect texture and flavour. Too much or too little milk can affect the outcome of dishes like pancakes, custards, or even batters for fried foods. For example, a <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe</a> calling for 20g of milk (0.7 oz) needs that exact amount to maintain the right moisture balance.</p>  

<p>Using a digital kitchen scale is the best way to measure 20g of milk accurately. If you don’t have one, a conversion chart like the one on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> can help. Remember, milk’s density means volume measures (like tablespoons) can vary, so weight is always more reliable.</p>  

<h3>How to measure 20g of milk without a scale</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a scale, 20g of milk is roughly 1.5 tablespoons. However, this can vary slightly depending on the milk's fat content. For UK recipes, it’s best to stick to weight measurements for consistency. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert category</a> for recipes where precise milk measurements are crucial.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for 20g of milk in air fryer recipes</h2>  
<p>Small quantities of milk, like 20g (0.7 oz), are often used in air fryer recipes for glazes, thin batters, or creamy sauces. For example, a light milk wash for pastries or a drizzle for mashed potatoes can elevate your dish. Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/breakfast>breakfast recipes</a> for ideas on how to use this measurement.</p>  

<p>When reheating leftovers like soups or casseroles in the air fryer, adding 20g of milk can restore moisture. Just be sure to adjust cooking times slightly to account for the extra liquid. For more tips, visit <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>.</p>  

<h3>Converting other milk quantities</h3>  
<p>If your recipe calls for a different amount of milk, here’s a quick reference: 50g is 1.76 oz, 100g is 3.53 oz, and 250g is 8.82 oz. Keep our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a> handy for easy adjustments.</p>

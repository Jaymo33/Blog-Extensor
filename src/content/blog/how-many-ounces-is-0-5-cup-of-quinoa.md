<p>0.5 cup of quinoa equals approximately 3.5 ounces (100 grams). This measurement is essential for air fryer recipes, ensuring your quinoa cooks evenly and absorbs flavours perfectly. Whether you're preparing a protein-packed salad or a hearty side dish, knowing the exact weight helps achieve consistent results.

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Precision is key when cooking quinoa in an air fryer. Too much quinoa can lead to uneven cooking, while too little may dry out. Measuring 0.5 cup of quinoa in ounces ensures the right texture and flavour absorption. This is especially important for meal prepping or batch cooking, where consistency matters. Visit <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>our recipe hub</a> for perfectly measured quinoa dishes.</p>  

<p>Quinoa expands when cooked, so 0.5 cup (3.5 oz) yields about 1.5 cups cooked. This makes it ideal for single servings or small portions. If you're new to air frying quinoa, start with this measurement for foolproof results.

<h3>Converting 0.5 Cup Quinoa to Ounces</h3>  
<p>Converting 0.5 cup of quinoa to ounces is simple: it’s roughly 3.5 oz (100g). This conversion works for both UK and US measurements, making it versatile for all recipes.

<h2>Tips for Cooking Quinoa in an Air Fryer</h2>  
<p>Cooking quinoa in an air fryer requires the right balance of liquid and heat. For 0.5 cup (3.5 oz) of quinoa, use 1 cup of water or broth. Preheat the air fryer to 180°C (350°F) and cook for 12–15 minutes. Stir halfway to ensure even cooking. For fluffy quinoa, let it rest for 5 minutes after cooking.</p>  

<p>Quinoa is a fantastic base for air fryer meals, from stuffed peppers to grain bowls. Its neutral flavour pairs well with spices, herbs, and proteins. For inspiration, try our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable-packed quinoa recipes</a>. Remember to clean your air fryer after cooking grains—here’s our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning guide</a>.</p>  

<h3>Common Mistakes to Avoid</h3>  
<p>Overcrowding the air fryer basket is a common mistake when cooking quinoa. For 0.5 cup (3.5 oz), use a single layer to allow proper air circulation. Skipping the rinse step can also lead to bitterness due to saponins. Always rinse quinoa under cold water before cooking.</p>

<p>25g of minced onion equals approximately 0.88 ounces. This conversion is essential for UK cooks using air fryer recipes that require precise measurements. Whether you're following a British recipe or adapting an international dish, getting your minced onion quantities right makes all the difference in flavour.</p>

<h2>Why accurate minced onion measurements matter</h2>
<p>When cooking with an air fryer, ingredient ratios directly affect texture and cooking times. Too much minced onion can make dishes soggy, while too little might leave them lacking flavour. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we know that perfect measurements lead to perfect results every time.</p>
<p>Minced onion is particularly tricky because its volume changes depending on how finely it's chopped. That's why weighing gives more consistent results than measuring by volume. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> helps eliminate guesswork for all your cooking needs.</p>

<h2>How to measure 25g minced onion without scales</h2>
<p>If you don't have digital scales handy, there are practical ways to estimate 25g of minced onion (0.88 ounces). One heaped tablespoon of finely minced onion typically weighs about 10g, so 2.5 tablespoons would give you roughly 25g.</p>
<p>For visual reference, 25g of minced onion fills about a quarter-cup measure when lightly packed. Remember that these volume measurements are less precise than weighing, especially important for air fryer cooking where moisture content affects results.</p>

<h3>Converting between grams and ounces</h3>
<p>The standard conversion is 1 ounce = 28.35 grams. Therefore, to convert 25g minced onion to ounces, you divide 25 by 28.35, giving approximately 0.88 ounces. This conversion works for all ingredients, not just onions, making it handy for all your <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a>.</p>

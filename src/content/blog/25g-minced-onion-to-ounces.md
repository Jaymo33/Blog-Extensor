<p>25g of minced onion equals approximately 0.88 ounces. This conversion is essential for UK cooks using air fryer recipes that require precise measurements. Whether you're following a British recipe or adapting an international dish, getting your minced onion quantities right makes all the difference in flavour.</p>

<h2>Why accurate minced onion measurements matter</h2>
<p>When cooking with an air fryer, ingredient ratios directly affect texture and cooking times. Too much minced onion can make dishes soggy, while too little might leave them lacking flavour. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we know that perfect measurements lead to perfect results every time.</p>
<p>Minced onion is particularly tricky because its volume changes depending on how finely it's chopped. That's why weighing gives more consistent results than measuring by volume. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> helps eliminate guesswork for all your cooking needs.</p>

<h2>How to measure 25g minced onion without scales</h2>
<p>If you don't have digital scales handy, there are practical ways to estimate 25g of minced onion (0.88 ounces). One heaped tablespoon of finely minced onion typically weighs about 10g, so 2.5 tablespoons would give you roughly 25g.</p>
<p>For visual reference, 25g of minced onion fills about a quarter-cup measure when lightly packed. Remember that these volume measurements are less precise than weighing, especially important for air fryer cooking where moisture content affects results.</p>

<h3>Converting between grams and ounces</h3>
<p>The standard conversion is 1 ounce = 28.35 grams. Therefore, to convert 25g minced onion to ounces, you divide 25 by 28.35, giving approximately 0.88 ounces. This conversion works for all ingredients, not just onions, making it handy for all your <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a>.</p>

<h2>Using 25g minced onion in air fryer recipes</h2>
<p>25g of minced onion (0.88 ounces) is a common quantity in many British air fryer recipes. This amount perfectly seasons individual portions of dishes like air-fried burgers, stuffed mushrooms or savoury pastries without overpowering other flavours.</p>
<p>When preparing multiple servings, simply scale up the 25g minced onion measurement proportionally. For example, a family-sized portion requiring 100g minced onion would need about 3.5 ounces. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable recipe category</a> for inspiration using this versatile ingredient.</p>

<h3>Storing leftover minced onion</h3>
<p>If your recipe only uses part of a 25g portion, store the remainder properly. Place minced onion in an airtight container with a paper towel to absorb moisture, then refrigerate for up to 3 days. For longer storage, freeze measured 25g portions in ice cube trays before transferring to freezer bags.</p>

<h2>Common recipe uses for 25g minced onion</h2>
<p>This quantity features in numerous air fryer dishes. Try 25g minced onion in homemade burger patties, stuffed peppers, or as a base for air-fried frittatas. The concentrated flavour means a little goes a long way in enhancing your cooking.</p>

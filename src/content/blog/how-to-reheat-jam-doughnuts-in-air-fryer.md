<p>Reheating jam doughnuts in an air fryer takes just 3-4 minutes at 160°C (320°F), restoring their crispiness while keeping the jam filling warm and gooey. This method beats microwaving, which often leaves them soggy, and is quicker than using a conventional oven. Whether you’ve got leftover bakery treats or homemade doughnuts, your air fryer delivers café-quality results with minimal effort.</p>

<h2>Why Use an Air Fryer for Reheating Jam Doughnuts?</h2>
<p>Air fryers circulate hot air rapidly, which revives the doughnut’s exterior without overcooking the jam centre. Unlike microwaves that steam food, air fryers maintain texture—critical for avoiding the dreaded “soggy doughnut” syndrome. Plus, they preheat in seconds, making them ideal for quick snacks or breakfasts.

<p>Another advantage is portion control. Air fryers accommodate 2-4 doughnuts at once (depending on basket size), preventing waste. If you’re reheating jam doughnuts from the fridge, add 30 seconds to compensate for the chill. Always space them out—overcrowding leads to uneven heating. Need to adjust temperatures for other foods?

<h3>Step-by-Step Reheating Instructions</h3>
<p>Start by preheating your air fryer to 160°C (320°F) for 2 minutes. Place doughnuts in a single layer, leaving space between each. Cook for 3 minutes, then check—if they need more crispiness, add 30-second increments. For stuffed doughnuts, reduce the time to 2.5 minutes initially to prevent jam leakage. If reheating frozen jam doughnuts, thaw them first for best results.</p>

<h2>Optimal Temperature and Timing</h2>
<p>160°C (320°F) is the sweet spot for reheating jam doughnuts in an air fryer. Higher temperatures risk burning the sugar coating before warming the centre, while lower temps won’t crisp the exterior. Timing varies: 3 minutes works for room-temperature doughnuts, while refrigerated ones may need 3.5-4 minutes. For doughnuts with thicker pastry (like Berliners), flip them halfway through.</p>
<p>Keep an eye on the jam filling—overheating can cause it to bubble out. If your air fryer has a dehydrate setting, avoid using it; stick to standard air fry mode. For more dessert-specific tips, browse our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert category</a>.</p>

<h3>Pro Tips to Prevent Drying Out</h3>
<p>Lightly spritz doughnuts with water before reheating to add moisture. Alternatively, place a small oven-safe cup of water in the air fryer basket to create steam. Avoid reheating doughnuts with powdered sugar—it’ll melt. Instead, dust them after warming.

<h2>Common Mistakes to Avoid</h2>
<p>Overcrowding the basket is the top mistake—it blocks airflow, leading to uneven reheating. Another error is skipping preheating, which extends cooking time. Don’t reheat doughnuts that are already stale; the air fryer can’t restore lost freshness. Lastly, avoid using foil or parchment paper unless your air fryer manual permits it—these can obstruct airflow.</p>
<p>If your doughnuts have custard alongside jam, reduce the temperature to 150°C (300°F) to prevent splitting. For more troubleshooting, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> guides cover various scenarios. Always let reheated doughnuts cool for 1 minute—the jam filling retains heat longer than the pastry.</p>

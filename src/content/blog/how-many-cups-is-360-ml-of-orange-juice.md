<p>360 ml of orange juice equals approximately 1.52 cups. This conversion is essential for baking, cooking, or preparing air fryer recipes where precise measurements matter. Whether you're whipping up a citrus glaze or a marinade, knowing how to convert millilitres to cups ensures your dish turns out perfectly every time. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we help simplify these conversions so you can focus on creating delicious meals.</p>  

<h2>Understanding the Conversion: 360 ml to Cups</h2>  
<p>Converting millilitres to cups can be tricky, especially when dealing with liquids like orange juice. The standard conversion is 1 cup = 236.588 ml, meaning 360 ml is roughly 1.52 cups. This measurement is particularly useful for recipes that require exact liquid quantities, such as cakes, sauces, or marinades for air fryer dishes. If you're working with a recipe from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>our collection</a>, this conversion ensures accuracy.</p>  

<p>Different countries use varying cup measurements, which can add confusion. In the UK, a metric cup is 250 ml, while in the US, it's 240 ml. For 360 ml of orange juice, this means approximately 1.44 UK cups or 1.5 US cups. Always check the origin of your recipe to avoid discrepancies. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> can help clarify these differences.</p>  

<h3>Why Precision Matters in Air Fryer Recipes</h3>  
<p>Air fryers rely on balanced moisture levels for perfect results. Too much liquid, like orange juice, can make food soggy, while too little may dry it out. Measuring 360 ml accurately as 1.52 cups ensures your marinades or glazes work as intended. For example, a citrus chicken recipe from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>our chicken category</a> might call for this exact amount to achieve the right tangy flavour.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for 360 ml of Orange Juice</h2>  
<p>Orange juice isn't just for drinkingâ€”it's a versatile ingredient in cooking and baking. From glazes for air-fried ham to citrus-infused desserts, 360 ml (1.52 cups) is a common quantity. If you're experimenting with <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert recipes</a>, this measurement ensures your orange syrup or cake batter has the perfect consistency.</p>  

<p>Marinades are another area where 360 ml of orange juice shines. The acidity tenderises meat while adding a bright flavour. For air fryer recipes, this amount is ideal for coating chicken, pork, or even tofu. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable category</a> for ideas on using orange juice in plant-based dishes.</p>  

<h3>Tips for Measuring Orange Juice Accurately</h3>  
<p>Use a liquid measuring cup for the most precise results. Pour the orange juice to the 360 ml mark, or measure 1.52 cups if using US standards. Avoid estimating, as small deviations can affect your recipe. For sticky ingredients like honey or syrup combined with orange juice, lightly grease the measuring cup first to ensure all the liquid pours out cleanly.</p>

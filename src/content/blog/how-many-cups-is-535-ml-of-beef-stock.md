<p>535 ml of beef stock is approximately 2.26 cups. This conversion is essential for anyone using an air fryer, as precise measurements can make or break a recipe. Whether you’re whipping up a hearty stew or a flavourful sauce, knowing how to convert millilitres to cups ensures your dish turns out perfectly every time.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on precise cooking times and ingredient ratios to deliver crispy, evenly cooked meals. Using the wrong amount of liquid, like beef stock, can affect texture and flavour. For example, too much stock might make your dish soggy, while too little could leave it dry. That’s why conversions like 535 ml of beef stock to cups are so valuable for air fryer enthusiasts.</p>  
<p>If you’re new to air fryer cooking, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for other handy measurements. It’s a lifesaver when adapting recipes from grams to cups or millilitres to tablespoons. You’ll also find plenty of inspiration in our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a>, featuring everything from quick weeknight dinners to gourmet treats.</p>

<h3>How to Measure 535 ml of Beef Stock Without a Measuring Cup</h3>  
<p>Don’t have a measuring cup? No problem. A standard UK mug holds roughly 284 ml, so 535 ml of beef stock would be just under two mugs. Alternatively, use a kitchen scale—1 ml of beef stock weighs about 1 gram, so 535 ml equals 535 grams. This method is especially handy for air fryer recipes where precision is key.</p>

<h2>Converting 535 ml of Beef Stock in Different Cup Sizes</h2>  
<p>It’s worth noting that cup sizes vary between the UK and USA. In the UK, 1 cup equals 284 ml, making 535 ml roughly 1.88 UK cups. In the USA, 1 cup is 240 ml, so 535 ml converts to about 2.23 US cups. Always check which measurement system your recipe uses to avoid confusion.</p>

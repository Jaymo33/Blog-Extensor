<p>10 ml of almond milk equals approximately 0.042 cups. This small measurement is often used in precise recipes, especially when working with air fryers where exact quantities matter.

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on precise cooking times and ingredient ratios to deliver crispy, evenly cooked results. Using too much or too little liquid, like almond milk, can affect texture and taste.

<p>4 tablespoons (tbsp) of apple cider vinegar equals approximately 60 grams (g). This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements can make or break your dish. Whether you're marinating chicken or whipping up a tangy glaze, knowing the exact weight ensures consistency.</p>

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>
<p>Air fryers rely on precise ingredient ratios to achieve the perfect texture and flavour. Too much or too little apple cider vinegar can alter the acidity, affecting both taste and cooking time. For example, a marinade with 4 tbsp apple cider vinegar (60g) will tenderise meat evenly, while an incorrect measurement might leave it too sharp or bland.</p>
<p>Many <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> call for apple cider vinegar to add depth, so getting the grams right is crucial. If you're preparing a batch of crispy tofu or glazed salmon, this conversion ensures your dish turns out as intended every time.</p>

<h2>How to measure 4 tbsp apple cider vinegar in grams</h2>
<p>The simplest way to convert 4 tbsp of apple cider vinegar into grams is by using a kitchen scale. Pour the vinegar directly into a measuring jug on the scale until it hits 60g. If you don't have scales, remember that 1 tbsp ≈ 15g, so 4 tbsp ≈ 60g.</p>
<p>For UK cooks, this conversion stays consistent whether you're making <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>air fryer chicken</a> or a vinegar-based slaw. Always level off your tablespoons for accuracy, as heaped measurements can skew results.</p>

<h3>Common uses for 4 tbsp apple cider vinegar in air fryers</h3>
<p>Apple cider vinegar works wonders in air fryer cooking. A 60g (4 tbsp) quantity is perfect for marinades, dressings, or even deglazing. Try it in a honey-vinegar glaze for crispy wings or to balance richness in <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/potatoes>air fryer potatoes</a>.</p>

<h2>Converting other vinegar amounts to grams</h2>
<p>If your recipe calls for more or less than 4 tbsp apple cider vinegar, here's a quick reference: 1 tbsp = 15g, 2 tbsp = 30g, 3 tbsp = 45g. This scale makes it easy to adjust while keeping flavours balanced.</p>

<h3>Tips for working with apple cider vinegar</h3>
<p>Always shake your apple cider vinegar bottle before measuring, as sediments can settle. For sticky residues, <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>clean your air fryer basket</a> promptly after vinegar-heavy recipes to prevent buildup. The acidity helps with cleaning too!</p>

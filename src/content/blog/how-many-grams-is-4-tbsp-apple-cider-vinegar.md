<p>4 tablespoons (tbsp) of apple cider vinegar equals approximately 60 grams (g). This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements can make or break your dish. Whether you're marinating chicken or whipping up a tangy glaze, knowing the exact weight ensures consistency.</p>

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>
<p>Air fryers rely on precise ingredient ratios to achieve the perfect texture and flavour. Too much or too little apple cider vinegar can alter the acidity, affecting both taste and cooking time. For example, a marinade with 4 tbsp apple cider vinegar (60g) will tenderise meat evenly, while an incorrect measurement might leave it too sharp or bland.</p>

<h2>How to measure 4 tbsp apple cider vinegar in grams</h2>
<p>The simplest way to convert 4 tbsp of apple cider vinegar into grams is by using a kitchen scale. Pour the vinegar directly into a measuring jug on the scale until it hits 60g. If you don't have scales, remember that 1 tbsp ≈ 15g, so 4 tbsp ≈ 60g.</p>

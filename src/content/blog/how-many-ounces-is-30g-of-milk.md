<h3>Does Milk Type Affect the Weight-to-Ounce Conversion?</h3>  
<p>While skim, semi-skimmed, and whole milk have slightly different densities, the difference is negligible for small quantities like 30g. Whether you're using plant-based or dairy milk, 30g will still be roughly 1.06 ounces. However, thicker liquids like condensed milk require a different conversion due to higher density.</p>

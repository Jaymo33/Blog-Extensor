<p>30g of milk equals approximately 1.06 ounces. This conversion is handy when following air fryer recipes that require precise measurements, especially for baking or creamy sauces. Whether you're whipping up a dessert or a savoury dish, knowing how to convert grams to ounces ensures accuracy.</p>  

<h2>Why Convert 30g of Milk to Ounces?</h2>  
<p>Many UK recipes, especially those for air fryers, list ingredients in grams, while some kitchen scales or measuring cups use ounces. Converting 30g of milk to ounces (1.06 oz) helps avoid guesswork and guarantees consistency. If you're making a creamy <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer mac and cheese</a>, precise measurements matter for the perfect texture.</p>  

<p>Air fryer cooking relies on exact quantities to ensure even cooking and avoid soggy or dry results. Whether you're preparing a <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert</a> or a savoury dish, knowing 30g of milk in ounces keeps your recipe on track. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a> for other common measurements.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure 30g of Milk Without Scales</h3>  
<p>If you don't have a scale, you can use a measuring spoon or cup to approximate 30g of milk. One tablespoon holds about 15g, so two tablespoons will get you close to 30g (roughly 1.06 oz). For liquid measurements, a standard UK metric measuring cup has millilitre markings—30g of milk is roughly 30ml, as milk's density is close to water.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for 30g of Milk in Air Fryer Recipes</h2>  
<p>30g of milk (1.06 oz) is often used in small-batch air fryer recipes, such as single-serve pancakes, batters, or creamy sauces. For example, a <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/breakfast>breakfast</a> recipe might call for 30g of milk to create a light batter for French toast or muffins. Precision ensures your dish turns out fluffy and well-balanced.</p>  

<p>Another great use is in marinades or glazes—30g of milk can help tenderise chicken or add richness to a glaze for <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/potatoes>roasted potatoes</a>. Since air fryers cook quickly, exact measurements prevent over-reducing liquids or uneven coating. Keep your <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer clean</a> for best results with dairy-based recipes.</p>  

<h3>Does Milk Type Affect the Weight-to-Ounce Conversion?</h3>  
<p>While skim, semi-skimmed, and whole milk have slightly different densities, the difference is negligible for small quantities like 30g. Whether you're using plant-based or dairy milk, 30g will still be roughly 1.06 ounces. However, thicker liquids like condensed milk require a different conversion due to higher density.</p>

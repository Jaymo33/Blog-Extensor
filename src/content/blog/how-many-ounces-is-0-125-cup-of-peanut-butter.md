<p>0.125 cup of peanut butter equals approximately 1 ounce (oz). This measurement is essential for air fryer recipes where precision matters, ensuring your dishes turn out perfectly every time. Whether you’re making peanut butter cookies or a savoury sauce, knowing this conversion simplifies your cooking process.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on precise ingredient ratios to achieve even cooking and perfect textures. Using the correct amount of peanut butter—like 0.125 cup (1 oz)—ensures your recipes aren’t too dry or overly greasy. Many <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> call for small quantities, making conversions like this crucial. A slight mismeasurement can alter the outcome, especially in baked goods or coatings for proteins like chicken or tofu.</p>  

<p>Peanut butter’s density means volume-to-weight conversions aren’t always straightforward. While 0.125 cup is roughly 1 oz, factors like brand, natural vs. processed, and temperature can cause slight variations. For consistent results, consider using a kitchen scale. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for other common ingredient conversions.</p>  

<h3>How to measure 0.125 cup of peanut butter without scales</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a scale, use measuring spoons: 0.125 cup equals 2 tablespoons. For sticky ingredients like peanut butter, lightly grease the spoon or cup for easy release. Level off the excess with a straight edge for accuracy. This method works well for <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cookies>air fryer cookies</a> or energy bites where precision is key.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for 0.125 cup peanut butter in air fryer recipes</h2>  
<p>This small quantity is perfect for glazes, sauces, or binding ingredients. Try it in peanut butter drizzle for air-fried bananas or as part of a marinade for satay-style chicken. It’s also ideal for single-serving desserts or <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/breakfast>breakfast recipes</a> like protein-packed oatmeal cups.</p>  

<p>When working with peanut butter in your air fryer, remember it can burn quickly due to its sugar content. Use lower temperatures (around 160°C) and check frequently. For easy cleanup, line your basket with parchment or use an <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner</a> to remove any sticky residue.</p>

Bookmark this page or our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a> for future recipes.

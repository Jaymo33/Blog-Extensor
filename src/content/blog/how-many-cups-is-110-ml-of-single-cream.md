<h2>Understanding the Conversion</h2>  
<p>Converting millilitres to cups can be tricky, especially with liquids like single cream. The density and viscosity of single cream mean it doesn’t always fill a cup the same way water would. In the US, a standard cup holds 240 ml, while in the UK, it’s 250 ml. This slight difference affects the conversion, so always check which measurement system your recipe uses.

<p>When measuring 110 ml of single cream, it’s best to use a liquid measuring cup for accuracy. Eyeballing it can lead to inconsistencies, which might affect the texture of your dish. If you’re using an air fryer, precise measurements ensure even cooking and perfect results every time. Need more tips?

<h3>Why Accuracy Matters in Air Fryer Cooking</h3>  
<p>Air fryers rely on precise measurements to deliver evenly cooked meals. Too much or too little single cream can alter the moisture content of your dish, affecting its crispiness or tenderness. For example, adding 110 ml of single cream instead of the correct cup measurement could make a batter too runny. This is especially important for recipes like air-fryer cakes or custards.

<h2>Why Convert 20g of Porridge Oats to Ounces?</h2>  
<p>Many UK recipes use grams, but some kitchen scales or international recipes might list ounces instead.

<h3>How to Measure 20g of Porridge Oats Without a Scale</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a scale, you can use tablespoons to measure 20g of porridge oats. Roughly 3 level tablespoons equal 20g, which is about 0.71 ounces. This method isn’t as precise as weighing, but it works in a pinch. For best results, fluff the oats lightly before scooping to avoid compacting them.</p>  

<h2>Using 20g of Porridge Oats in Air Fryer Recipes</h2>

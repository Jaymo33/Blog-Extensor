<p>150 grams of brown sugar equals approximately 0.75 cups when lightly packed, or roughly 3/4 of a standard UK or US measuring cup. This conversion is essential for air fryer baking, where precise measurements can make or break your recipe. Whether you’re whipping up cookies, cakes, or glazes, knowing how many cups is 150 grams of brown sugar ensures consistent results every time.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Brown Sugar Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Baking</h2>
<p>Air fryers cook food faster and more evenly than conventional ovens, which means ingredient ratios are critical. Too much or too little brown sugar can affect texture, browning, and even cooking times. For example, if you’re making air fryer cookies, 150 grams of brown sugar in cups (0.75 cups) provides the perfect balance of sweetness and chewiness. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for other common baking measurements.</p>
<p>Brown sugar’s moisture content also plays a role. Packed brown sugar will measure differently than loosely poured, which is why we recommend lightly packing your 150g for consistent results. This is especially important for air fryer desserts like sticky toffee pudding or brown sugar glazes, where precision ensures caramelisation without burning.</p>

<h3>UK vs US Cup Measurements for 150g Brown Sugar</h3>
<p>While 150 grams of brown sugar converts to 0.75 cups in both UK and US measurements, slight variations exist due to cup sizes. A UK cup is 250ml, whereas a US cup is 240ml. For air fryer recipes on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we use UK standards, but most recipes tolerate a small margin of error. If you’re adapting a US recipe, 150 grams of brown sugar in cups remains roughly 3/4 cup in either system.</p>

<h2>How to Measure 150 Grams of Brown Sugar Without Scales</h2>
<p>No kitchen scales? No problem. To measure 150 grams of brown sugar in cups using just a measuring cup, lightly spoon the sugar into the cup until it’s slightly heaped, then level it off with a knife. Avoid compacting it too firmly, as this can add up to 20% more sugar by volume. For reference, 150g brown sugar to cups is about 3/4 cup, or 12 level tablespoons.</p>
<p>If you’re mid-recipe and realise you’ve mis-measured, don’t panic. Air fryers are forgiving, and small adjustments can often save a bake. For more rescue tips, browse our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> section, where we cover common baking fixes.</p>

<h3>Best Air Fryer Recipes Using 150g Brown Sugar</h3>
<p>This quantity shines in classics like air fryer chocolate chip cookies or cinnamon rolls. The 150 grams of brown sugar converted to cups (0.75 cups) provides depth of flavour without overpowering. Try it in our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cookies>cookie category</a> recipes, where brown sugar’s molasses notes enhance crisp edges and soft centres.</p>

<h2>Storing Brown Sugar for Air Fryer Baking</h2>
<p>To keep your 150 grams of brown sugar measurement consistent batch after batch, store it properly. Brown sugar hardens when exposed to air, which can throw off your cup measurements. Keep it in an airtight container with a terra cotta brown sugar saver or a slice of bread to maintain moisture. For more kitchen organisation hacks, see our guide to <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner</a> and storage solutions.</p>
<p>If your brown sugar has hardened, don’t resort to guessing how much is 150 grams of brown sugar in cups. Gently warm it in the air fryer at 65°C for 2-3 minutes to soften, then measure immediately. This ensures your 150g brown sugar cup equivalent stays accurate for recipes.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>When it comes to baking or making desserts in your air fryer, precision is key. Too much or too little condensed milk can alter the texture and taste of your dish. For example, a mousse or fudge recipe relying on 75g of condensed milk needs the exact amount to set properly. Air fryer recipes often require smaller, more controlled portions, so converting grams to ounces ensures consistency.

<p>Condensed milk is denser than regular milk, so volume measurements like cups can be unreliable. Weight measurements, such as grams or ounces, provide the accuracy needed for perfect results. Whether you’re making a caramel drizzle or a no-bake cheesecake, knowing that 75g of condensed milk is 2.65 ounces takes the guesswork out of cooking.

<p>Using the correct amount of chicken breast ensures even cooking and prevents overcrowding in the air fryer basket. Overloading can lead to unevenly cooked food, while too little might dry it out.

<h3>How to Measure 450 Grams of Chicken Breast Without Scales</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have kitchen scales, visual cues can help. A standard cup holds about 150–180 grams of diced chicken breast, so 450 grams would fill roughly 2.5 to 3 cups. Keep in mind that shredded chicken takes up more volume than cubed. For air fryer cooking, slightly underfilling the cup prevents spillage and promotes crispiness. Need cleaning tips?

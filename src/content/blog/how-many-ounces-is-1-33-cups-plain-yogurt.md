<p>1.33 cups of plain yogurt equals approximately 10.64 ounces (oz) in UK measurements. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes, ensuring accurate ingredient portions for perfect results. Whether you’re whipping up a creamy dip or a baked dessert, knowing this measurement saves time and avoids guesswork. For more air fryer conversions, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>handy conversion chart</a>.</p>

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Precision is key when using an air fryer, as ingredients cook faster and more evenly with the right proportions. Too much yogurt in a recipe can lead to soggy results, while too little might dry out your dish. Measuring 1.33 cups of plain yogurt correctly (10.64 oz) ensures consistency, especially for recipes like marinades or batters. If you’re exploring new dishes, browse our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipe collection</a> for inspiration.</p>  

<p>Many UK cooks prefer weighing ingredients like yogurt for better accuracy, as cup measurements can vary. A kitchen scale simplifies this process, but if you’re using cups, remember that 1.33 cups of plain yogurt translates to roughly 10.64 oz. This conversion is particularly useful for meal prepping or scaling recipes up or down. For more tips on air fryer efficiency, visit <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>.</p>  

<h3>How to measure 1.33 cups of plain yogurt without scales</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a kitchen scale, use liquid measuring cups for the most accurate 1.33 cups of plain yogurt measurement. Fill the cup to the 1 1/3 mark, levelling off the top with a straight edge. For thicker yogurts, gently spoon it into the cup to avoid air pockets. This method ensures you’re close to the 10.64 oz equivalent, crucial for air fryer recipes like yogurt-based marinades for chicken or lamb.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for 1.33 cups (10.64 oz) of plain yogurt in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>This quantity of yogurt is perfect for marinating proteins like chicken or lamb before air frying. The acidity tenderises the meat while adding moisture, resulting in juicy, flavourful dishes. It’s also ideal for baking – think yogurt cakes or muffins, where precise measurements affect texture. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>air fryer cake recipes</a> for delicious ideas using this measurement.</p>  

<p>Yogurt also works wonders in air fryer dips and sauces – 1.33 cups (10.64 oz) makes enough for 4-6 servings. Combine it with herbs and spices for a healthy veggie dip or use it as a base for tandoori-style marinades. For cleaning your air fryer after yogurt-heavy recipes, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning guide</a> has you covered.</p>  

<h3>Converting other yogurt quantities to ounces</h3>  
<p>While 1.33 cups equals 10.64 oz, you might need other conversions. Half a cup of plain yogurt is about 4 oz, while 2 cups equal approximately 16 oz. These conversions help when adjusting recipes for different serving sizes. Remember that yogurt density can vary slightly between brands, so for critical recipes, weighing is always best.</p>

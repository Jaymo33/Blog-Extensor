<p>0.125 cup of granulated sugar equals 1 ounce. This conversion is essential for precise baking and cooking, especially when using an air fryer. Whether you’re whipping up a cake or a batch of cookies, getting the measurements right ensures perfect results every time.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Sugar Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>When baking in an air fryer, precision is key. Too much or too little sugar can affect texture, browning, and overall taste. For example, 0.125 cup of granulated sugar (1 ounce) is often used in small-batch recipes, like single-serving desserts or glazes. If you’re following a recipe from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, knowing this conversion ensures your dish turns out just right.</p>  

<p>Granulated sugar is denser than powdered sugar but lighter than brown sugar, so volume-to-weight conversions vary. For air fryer recipes, especially those involving caramelisation or crisping, accuracy is crucial. A digital kitchen scale can help, but if you’re using measuring cups, our guide ensures you won’t go wrong.</p>  

<h2>How to Measure 0.125 Cup of Granulated Sugar</h2>  
<p>Measuring 0.125 cup (which is 2 tablespoons) of granulated sugar is simple with the right tools. Use a standard measuring cup and fill it to the 1/8 mark, or use two level tablespoons. For best results, spoon the sugar into the cup and level it off with a knife—don’t pack it down.</p>  

<h3>Using a Kitchen Scale for Precision</h3>  
<p>If you have a kitchen scale, weigh out 1 ounce (28 grams) of granulated sugar for the most accurate measurement. This method eliminates guesswork and is ideal for air fryer recipes where consistency matters. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more handy tips.</p>  

<h2>Common Recipes Using 0.125 Cup of Sugar</h2>  
<p>Many air fryer recipes call for small amounts of sugar, such as glazes, frostings, or mini desserts. For instance, a single-serving <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>air fryer mug cake</a> might require 0.125 cup of granulated sugar. Similarly, a quick caramel drizzle for air-fried apples uses this measurement.</p>  

<p>If you’re making a small batch of cookies or a sweet glaze for <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>air fryer desserts</a>, knowing that 0.125 cup equals 1 ounce saves time and ensures consistency. Always double-check your recipe’s requirements to avoid over- or under-sweetening.</p>  

<h3>Adjusting Recipes for Different Sugar Types</h3>  
<p>While 0.125 cup of granulated sugar is 1 ounce, other sugars like brown or powdered have different weights. For example, packed brown sugar is heavier, so always refer to a conversion chart. If you’re substituting sugars in an air fryer recipe, adjust measurements accordingly for the best results.</p>  

<h2>Tips for Storing Granulated Sugar</h2>  
<p>Keep granulated sugar in an airtight container to prevent clumping, especially in humid kitchens. Proper storage ensures accurate measurements every time.

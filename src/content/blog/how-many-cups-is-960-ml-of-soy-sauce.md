<p>960 ml of soy sauce equals approximately 4.06 cups. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes, baking, or meal prep where precision matters. Whether you're whipping up a marinade or seasoning a dish, knowing how to measure soy sauce correctly ensures consistent flavour every time.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Soy Sauce Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of soy sauce can make or break a dish. Too little, and your meal might lack depth; too much, and it becomes overpoweringly salty. For air fryer recipes, such as crispy tofu or glazed salmon, precise measurements ensure balanced flavours. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we emphasise accuracy to help you cook like a pro.</p>  

<p>Converting 960 ml of soy sauce to cups is straightforward once you know the ratio. Since 1 cup equals roughly 236.59 ml, dividing 960 by this figure gives you 4.06 cups. This measurement is particularly useful for batch cooking or scaling recipes up or down.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure 960 ml of Soy Sauce Without a Scale</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a measuring jug, use standard cups to portion out 960 ml of soy sauce. Fill a cup to the brim four times, then add about a tablespoon extra to hit the 4.06-cup mark. This method works well for marinades, sauces, or even <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer glaze recipes</a>.</p>  

<h2>US vs. UK Cup Measurements for Soy Sauce</h2>  
<p>While the difference between US and UK cups is minimal (1 US cup = 236.59 ml, 1 UK cup = 250 ml), it’s worth noting for precision. For 960 ml of soy sauce, the US measurement is 4.06 cups, while the UK equivalent is roughly 3.84 cups. Always check your recipe’s origin to avoid discrepancies.</p>  

<p>Most modern recipes, including those on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, use US cup measurements. If you’re adapting a British recipe, adjust accordingly to avoid over-seasoning. For example, a teriyaki chicken recipe calling for 960 ml of soy sauce would need slightly less if using UK cups.</p>  

<h3>Common Recipes Using 960 ml of Soy Sauce</h3>  
<p>This quantity of soy sauce is often used in large-batch cooking, such as meal prep stir-fries, ramen broths, or marinades for proteins like beef or shrimp. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>air fryer chicken recipes</a> for inspiration on using soy sauce effectively.</p>  

<h2>Converting 960 ml of Soy Sauce for Baking</h2>  
<p>In baking, soy sauce adds umami to dishes like soy-glazed cakes or savoury cookies. Since baking relies on exact ratios, converting 960 ml to cups (4.06) ensures consistency. For smaller batches, halve or quarter the measurement as needed.</p>  

<p>If you’re experimenting with air fryer desserts, like soy caramel drizzle, precise measurements prevent overpowering sweetness. Visit <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>our conversion chart</a> for more handy measurement tips.</p>  

<h3>Storing Leftover Soy Sauce</h3>  
<p>After measuring 960 ml of soy sauce, store any leftovers in an airtight container in the fridge. Proper storage maintains flavour and prevents contamination. For more kitchen organisation tips, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning guide</a>.</p>

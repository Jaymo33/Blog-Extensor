<p>360 ml of yogurt is approximately 1.5 cups, making it a handy measurement for air fryer recipes. Whether you're whipping up a creamy dessert or a savoury marinade, knowing this conversion ensures accuracy in your cooking. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we understand how precise measurements can elevate your dishes, especially when using an air fryer.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of yogurt can make or break your air fryer recipes. Too much, and your dish might turn out soggy; too little, and it could lack flavour. For example, when making air fryer cakes or marinades, 360 ml of yogurt (1.5 cups) provides the perfect balance. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more handy tips.</p>  

<p>Yogurt is a versatile ingredient, often used in both sweet and savoury dishes. From tenderising meats to adding moisture to baked goods, 360 ml of yogurt is a common measurement in many recipes. If you're exploring new dishes, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipes section</a> has plenty of inspiration.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure 360 ml of Yogurt Without a Measuring Cup</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a measuring cup, you can use a standard metric measuring jug to measure 360 ml of yogurt.

<h2>Common Recipes Using 360 ml of Yogurt</h2>  
<p>Many air fryer recipes call for 360 ml of yogurt, such as marinades for chicken or batter for desserts. For instance, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipes</a> often use this amount to create tender, flavourful dishes. Yogurt’s acidity helps break down proteins, making it ideal for air fryer cooking.</p>  

<p>Another popular use for 360 ml of yogurt is in baking. Air fryer cakes and muffins often require this measurement to achieve the perfect texture. Whether you're making a classic vanilla sponge or a tangy lemon drizzle, 360 ml of yogurt ensures a moist, fluffy result.

<h3>Converting 360 ml of Yogurt for Different Recipes</h3>  
<p>While 360 ml of yogurt equals 1.5 cups, some recipes might require slight adjustments. For thicker yogurts like Greek yogurt, you may need to reduce the amount slightly to maintain the right consistency. Always check the recipe notes for specific guidance.</p>

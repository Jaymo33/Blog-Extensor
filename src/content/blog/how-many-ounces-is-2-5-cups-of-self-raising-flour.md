<p>2.5 cups of self-raising flour equals approximately 10.6 ounces (oz). This conversion is essential for bakers using air fryers, where precise measurements can make or break a recipe. Whether you're making cakes, bread, or other treats, knowing how many ounces are in 2.5 cups of self-raising flour ensures consistency. For more air fryer baking tips, check out <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>our recipe collection</a>.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate flour measurements matter</h2>  
<p>Baking is a science, and even small deviations in flour measurements can affect texture and rise. Self-raising flour, which contains baking powder, requires extra precision. Too much flour can make baked goods dense, while too little may cause them to collapse. If you're using an air fryer, precise measurements are even more critical due to its compact cooking space. For a handy reference, bookmark <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>our air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>  

<p>Measuring by weight (ounces) is more reliable than volume (cups) because flour can settle or be packed differently. A digital kitchen scale is a baker's best friend, especially for air fryer recipes where consistency is key. If you're new to air fryer baking, explore <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>cake recipes</a> to practice your measurements.</p>  

<h2>How to measure 2.5 cups of self-raising flour</h2>  
<p>To measure 2.5 cups of self-raising flour accurately, fluff the flour with a spoon before lightly scooping it into a measuring cup. Level off the excess with a straight edge for consistency. For 10.6 ounces, use a kitchen scale to verify the weight. This method ensures your air fryer bakes turn out perfectly every time.</p>  

<h3>Common mistakes when measuring flour</h3>  
<p>Many bakers scoop flour directly from the bag, which compacts it and leads to over-measuring. Another mistake is tapping the measuring cup, which settles the flour and adds extra weight. For air fryer recipes, these small errors can result in dry or unevenly cooked dishes. Always measure flour correctly for the best results.</p>  

<h2>Converting other flour amounts</h2>  
<p>If you need to convert different amounts of self-raising flour, here's a quick reference: 1 cup equals roughly 4.25 ounces, and 3 cups equal about 12.75 ounces. These conversions are useful for scaling recipes up or down, especially for air fryer cooking where batch sizes matter.

<h3>Using self-raising flour in air fryers</h3>  
<p>Self-raising flour works wonderfully in air fryers for quick breads, muffins, and even pizza dough. Because air fryers circulate hot air, baked goods cook evenly and often faster than in conventional ovens. Just remember to adjust cooking times and check for doneness a few minutes early.

<p>60 ml of orange juice equals approximately 0.25 cups (or 1/4 cup). This conversion is essential for precise measurements in recipes, especially when using an air fryer where ingredient ratios matter. Whether you're baking a citrus-infused cake or marinating chicken, knowing how to convert 60 ml of orange juice to cups ensures consistency and great results.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on even heat distribution, so ingredient proportions can affect texture and cooking times. Using too much or too little liquid, like 60 ml of orange juice, might alter the outcome of your dish. For example, a marinade with 60 ml of orange juice (0.25 cups) helps tenderise meat without overpowering it.

<p>Recipes from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> often specify ml or cups, so knowing this conversion saves time. If a recipe calls for 60 ml of orange juice and you only have measuring cups, now you know it’s roughly 1/4 cup. This small but crucial detail can make or break dishes like glazed salmon or orange-infused desserts.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure 60 ml of Orange Juice Without a Scale</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a measuring jug, use a standard tablespoon: 4 tablespoons equal 60 ml (or 0.25 cups). For thicker juices, like pulpy orange juice, lightly shake the bottle before pouring to ensure an even measurement. This trick works well for recipes like our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>orange-glazed chicken</a>.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for 60 ml of Orange Juice in Air Fryer Recipes</h2>  
<p>This quantity is perfect for marinades, glazes, or dressings. For instance, 60 ml of orange juice mixed with honey and garlic makes a quick glaze for air-fried salmon. It’s also ideal for baking—think orange-infused muffins or cakes. Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a> for inspiration.</p>  

<p>In savoury dishes, 60 ml of orange juice (0.25 cups) balances acidity and sweetness. Try it in a stir-fry sauce or drizzle over roasted vegetables before air frying. For a refreshing twist, add it to a homemade cleaner for your air fryer basket—just mix with vinegar and water (see our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning guide</a>).</p>  

<h3>Adjusting Recipes for Different Cup Sizes</h3>  
<p>Note that US and UK cup sizes differ slightly (1 US cup = 240 ml; 1 UK cup = 250 ml). For 60 ml of orange juice, the variance is negligible (0.25 cups in both), but double-check for larger quantities. This ensures your air fryer dishes turn out perfectly every time.</p>

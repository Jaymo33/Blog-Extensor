<p>3 tablespoons of maple syrup equals approximately 60 grams. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precision ensures perfect results. Whether you're glazing salmon, sweetening desserts, or adding a touch of richness to breakfast dishes, knowing the exact weight helps avoid inconsistencies. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we focus on accurate measurements to elevate your cooking. Keep reading to learn why this conversion matters and how to use it effectively.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate maple syrup measurements matter</h2>  
<p>Maple syrup is a versatile ingredient, but its thickness means volume measurements like tablespoons can vary slightly in weight. For air fryer recipes, especially those involving glazes or marinades, even small discrepancies can affect texture and flavour. Using grams instead of tablespoons ensures consistency, whether you're making sticky wings or a maple-drizzled dessert. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> simplifies these calculations for all your cooking needs. Precision is key to replicating restaurant-quality results at home.</p>  

<p>Many air fryer recipes, like our popular <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>maple-glazed chicken</a>, rely on the perfect balance of sweetness and stickiness. Too much syrup can make dishes overly sweet or cause burning, while too little may leave them lacking flavour. By converting 3 tbsp of maple syrup to grams (60g), you eliminate guesswork. This is especially useful for batch cooking or meal prep, where consistency across servings matters. Trust the scale for reliable results every time.</p>  

<h2>How to measure maple syrup for air fryer recipes</h2>  
<p>While tablespoons are convenient, weighing maple syrup is far more accurate. If your recipe calls for 3 tbsp (60g), simply place a bowl on your kitchen scale, tare it to zero, and pour the syrup until it hits 60 grams. This method avoids sticky measuring spoons and ensures precision. For recipes like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>air fryer desserts</a>, where sugar content affects texture, grams are non-negotiable. Even professional chefs swear by weight measurements for consistency.</p>  

<h3>Common uses for 3 tbsp (60g) maple syrup</h3>  
<p>This quantity is perfect for glazing proteins like salmon or chicken in the air fryer. It's also ideal for sweetening oatmeal, drizzling over roasted vegetables, or incorporating into baking mixes. Many <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> use this amount to balance sweetness without overpowering other flavours. Whether you're making a marinade or a finishing glaze, 60 grams of maple syrup delivers just the right intensity. Experiment with this measurement in both savoury and sweet applications.</p>  

<h2>Converting other maple syrup quantities</h2>  
<p>Need more or less than 3 tbsp? Here’s a quick guide: 1 tbsp = 20g, 2 tbsp = 40g, and 4 tbsp = 80g. These conversions work for all types of maple syrup, whether light amber or dark robust.

<p>To easily pour and measure sticky syrup, lightly coat your spoon or measuring cup with oil first. Warm the syrup slightly if it’s too thick to pour accurately.

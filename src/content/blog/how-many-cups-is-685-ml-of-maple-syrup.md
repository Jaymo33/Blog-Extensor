<p>685 ml of maple syrup is approximately 2.9 cups in the US and 2.4 cups in the UK. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes and baking, where precise measurements matter. Whether you're whipping up a glaze or a sweet marinade, knowing how to convert ml to cups ensures your dish turns out perfectly every time.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter</h2>
<p>Using the right amount of maple syrup can make or break your recipe. Too much, and your dish could be overly sweet or sticky. Too little, and you might miss out on that rich, caramelised flavour. For air fryer recipes, precision is key to achieving even cooking and perfect texture.

<p>Maple syrup is a popular ingredient in both sweet and savoury dishes. From glazing salmon to sweetening desserts, it's versatile. But because it's thicker than water, its volume-to-weight ratio differs. That's why converting 685 ml of maple syrup to cups isn't as straightforward as other liquids.</p>

<h2>US vs. UK Cup Measurements</h2>
<p>In the US, 1 cup equals 240 ml, while in the UK, it's 284 ml. This means 685 ml of maple syrup converts to roughly 2.9 US cups or 2.4 UK cups. If you're following a recipe from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, always check which measurement system it uses to avoid mistakes.</p>
<p>For air fryer cooking, even small measurement discrepancies can affect results. A sticky glaze might not crisp up properly, or a marinade could be too runny. That's why we recommend using a measuring jug for liquids like maple syrup. Eyeballing it rarely works!</p>

<p>To measure 685 ml of maple syrup accurately, lightly grease your measuring cup or spoon first. This helps the syrup slide out easily, ensuring you get the full amount. For sticky ingredients like maple syrup, a silicone spatula is your best friend. Scrape every last drop for perfect results.</p>

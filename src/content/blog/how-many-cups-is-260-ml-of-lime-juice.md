<p>260 ml of lime juice equals approximately 1.1 cups. Whether you're whipping up a zesty marinade or a tangy dessert in your air fryer, knowing this conversion ensures your recipes turn out perfectly every time. Lime juice is a staple in many dishes, from Mexican-inspired meals to refreshing desserts, and getting the measurement right is key. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we’re all about making cooking simpler, so let’s break down this conversion in detail.</p>

<h2>Understanding the Conversion: 260 ml of Lime Juice to Cups</h2>
<p>Converting millilitres to cups can be tricky, especially when precision matters in recipes. For lime juice, 260 ml translates to roughly 1.1 cups, or just over a cup. This measurement is particularly useful for air fryer recipes, where balancing acidity and flavour is crucial. If you’re working with a recipe that calls for cups but you only have a measuring jug in millilitres, this conversion will save the day. For more handy conversions, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>

<p>Lime juice is often used in marinades, dressings, and even baked goods, so knowing how to measure it accurately is a game-changer. Whether you’re making crispy air-fried chicken with a lime glaze or a citrusy dessert, this conversion ensures consistency. Remember, 260 ml of lime juice is just slightly more than a standard US cup (240 ml), so adjust accordingly if your recipe is sensitive to liquid ratios.</p>

<h3>Why Accurate Lime Juice Measurements Matter</h3>
<p>Using the right amount of lime juice can make or break a dish. Too little, and your recipe might lack brightness; too much, and it could become overpoweringly sour. For air fryer cooking, where flavours are concentrated due to the high heat, precision is even more important. A dish like air-fried shrimp with lime needs just the right balance to shine. Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipes</a> for inspiration on how to use lime juice effectively.</p>

<h2>Converting 260 ml of Lime Juice in Different Cup Standards</h2>
<p>It’s worth noting that cup measurements can vary depending on where you are. In the UK, a standard cup is 250 ml, meaning 260 ml of lime juice is roughly 1.04 cups. In the US, where a cup is 240 ml, it’s about 1.08 cups. For most practical purposes, rounding to 1.1 cups works perfectly fine, but if you’re following a precise recipe, these small differences can matter. Always check whether your recipe uses US or UK measurements to avoid confusion.</p>

<p>If you’re scaling a recipe up or down, knowing these conversions helps maintain the right flavour balance. For example, doubling a recipe that calls for 260 ml of lime juice means you’ll need 2.2 cups. This is especially handy when meal prepping or cooking for a crowd. For more tips on scaling recipes, visit our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/meal-prep>meal prep category</a>.</p>

<h3>Tips for Measuring Lime Juice Accurately</h3>
<p>When measuring lime juice, it’s best to use a liquid measuring cup for accuracy. Pour the juice slowly to the 260 ml mark, checking at eye level to avoid over- or under-pouring. If you’re using fresh limes, note that one medium lime yields about 30-45 ml of juice, so you’ll need roughly 6-8 limes for 260 ml. For convenience, bottled lime juice works too—just ensure it’s pure lime juice without added sugars or preservatives.</p>

<h2>Common Uses for 260 ml of Lime Juice in Air Fryer Recipes</h2>
<p>260 ml of lime juice is a versatile quantity that pops up in many air fryer recipes. From marinades for chicken or shrimp to dressings for salads or grain bowls, this amount adds a vibrant kick. Try it in an air-fried fish taco recipe, where the lime juice balances the richness of the fish. Or, use it in a citrusy glaze for air-fried vegetables—just toss them in the lime juice before cooking for a bright, fresh flavour.</p>

<p>Desserts can also benefit from 260 ml of lime juice. A key lime pie-inspired air fryer dessert, for instance, might call for this amount to achieve the perfect tang. For more dessert ideas, browse our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert category</a>. The acidity of lime juice can even help tenderise meats, making it a great addition to air-fried steak or pork recipes.</p>

<h3>Storing Leftover Lime Juice</h3>
<p>If you don’t use all 260 ml of lime juice at once, store the remainder in an airtight container in the fridge for up to a week. Alternatively, freeze it in ice cube trays for easy portioning later. This way, you’ll always have lime juice on hand for impromptu air fryer meals.

<p>3.0 cups of butter equals approximately 680 grams. This conversion is essential for precise baking, especially when using an air fryer where measurements matter. Whether you’re whipping up cookies or a buttery cake, knowing how many grams 3.0 cups of butter is ensures consistent results every time.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Butter Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Baking is a science, and butter plays a crucial role in texture and flavour. Too much or too little can ruin a recipe, which is why converting 3.0 cups of butter to grams is so important. Air fryer recipes, like those on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, often require precise measurements for even cooking. Grams provide a more accurate measurement than cups, as butter density can vary slightly.</p>  

<p>For example, a <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>cake recipe</a> using 3.0 cups of butter will turn out perfectly if measured in grams. European and UK recipes typically use grams, making this conversion handy for international bakers. If you’re using an air fryer for baking, always weigh ingredients for the best results.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure Butter Correctly</h3>  
<p>Measuring butter can be confusing, especially when recipes call for cups or grams. For 3.0 cups of butter, use a kitchen scale for accuracy. If you don’t have one, check our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for quick reference. Pack butter firmly into a measuring cup, ensuring no air gaps, then level it off with a knife.</p>  

<h2>US vs. UK Butter Measurements</h2>  
<p>Butter measurements can differ between the US and UK. In the US, butter is often sold in sticks, while UK butter comes in blocks. This means 3.0 cups of butter in the US may slightly differ in weight from UK butter. Always double-check packaging labels for exact gram equivalents.</p>  

<p>For air fryer recipes, like those in our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cookies>cookie section</a>, sticking to grams eliminates confusion. If a recipe calls for 3.0 cups of butter, converting to grams ensures consistency regardless of where your butter comes from.</p>  

<h3>Common Baking Recipes Using 3.0 Cups of Butter</h3>  
<p>Many indulgent recipes, like shortbread or buttery pastries, use large quantities of butter. If you’re making a batch of cookies or a rich cake, knowing that 3.0 cups of butter equals 680 grams helps streamline preparation. For more inspiration, browse our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> collection.</p>  

<h2>Tips for Measuring Butter Without a Scale</h2>  
<p>If you don’t have a scale, use the markings on butter packaging. Most blocks indicate tablespoon measurements, which can help estimate 3.0 cups of butter in grams. Alternatively, use water displacement methods for rough estimates, though weighing is always best.</p>

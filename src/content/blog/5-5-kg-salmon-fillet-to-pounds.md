    "@type": "Answer",
    "text": "Converting 5.5 kg salmon fillet to pounds is crucial for air frying because most air fryer recipes and manufacturer guidelines use pounds to specify cooking times and temperatures. Air fryers cook food rapidly, and even a small miscalculation in weight can lead to over or undercooking. Knowing that 5.5 kg is approximately 12.125 pounds helps you follow recipes accurately and achieve perfectly cooked, flaky salmon every time."

    "@type": "Answer",
    "text": "It depends on the size of your air fryer basket. A 5.5 kg salmon fillet is quite large, weighing about 12.125 pounds, and may not fit in most standard air fryers in one piece. For best results, cut the fillet into smaller portions that fit comfortably in the basket without overlapping. This ensures proper air circulation and even cooking. Cooking in batches is recommended for consistent results and to avoid steaming instead of air frying."

Since there are 16 ounces in a pound, multiply 0.125 by 16 to get 2 ounces. So, 5.5 kg is approximately 12 pounds and 2 ounces. This level of precision is useful for recipes that require exact measurements for seasoning or cooking time calculations."

<p>5 tablespoons (tbsp) of molasses weigh approximately 105 grams in the UK. This conversion is essential for precise baking and cooking, especially when using an air fryer where measurements matter. Molasses, a thick, dark syrup, varies slightly in density, but this standard conversion works for most recipes. Whether you’re making gingerbread or a glaze, knowing the exact grams ensures consistency. For more air fryer-friendly measurements, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate molasses measurements matter</h2>  
<p>Molasses adds depth and sweetness to dishes, but too much or too little can alter the texture and flavour. In baking, especially for cakes or cookies, precision is key to avoid overly dense or dry results. Air fryer recipes, like sticky glazes or marinades, also rely on accurate measurements for even cooking. A slight deviation in grams can affect caramelisation or browning. For perfectly balanced recipes, always measure molasses by weight, not just volume.</p>  

<p>UK bakers often struggle with tablespoon-to-gram conversions due to differing spoon sizes. A standard UK tablespoon holds about 21 grams of molasses, so 5 tbsp equal roughly 105 grams. This avoids the guesswork of scooping or levelling. If you’re adapting a US recipe, note that their tablespoons differ slightly—another reason to trust grams. Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipe collection</a> for molasses-based dishes with precise measurements.</p>  

<h3>How to measure molasses without scales</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have kitchen scales, use the spoon-and-level method for accuracy. Lightly grease your measuring spoon to help the molasses slide out cleanly, ensuring you get the full 21 grams per tablespoon. Avoid packing it down, as this adds extra weight. For sticky ingredients like molasses, a silicone spatula helps scrape every bit into your mixing bowl. Remember, 5 tbsp of molasses in grams is 105g—no scales needed!</p>  

<h2>Common uses for molasses in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Molasses isn’t just for baking—it’s a star in air fryer recipes too. Use it to glaze meats like chicken or salmon, adding a rich, caramelised finish. A mix of molasses, soy sauce, and spices makes a quick marinade for tofu or vegetables. For desserts, drizzle it over air-fried bananas or stir it into oat bars before cooking. The key is measuring correctly: 5 tbsp of molasses (105g) ensures balanced sweetness. Discover more ideas in our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert category</a>.</p>  

<p>Cleaning molasses residue from your air fryer basket? Soak it in warm, soapy water, then scrub gently. Sticky spills can burn during future cooks if not removed. For tough buildup, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner guide</a> has expert tips. Always measure molasses carefully to minimise mess—105g per 5 tbsp is easy to manage. Happy cooking!</p>  

<h3>Molasses substitutes and conversions</h3>  
<p>If you’re out of molasses, dark corn syrup or honey can work, but adjust the grams slightly. Honey is lighter, so 5 tbsp equals about 100g. For sugar-based substitutes, dissolve brown sugar in water to mimic molasses’ consistency. Remember, substitutes may change cooking times in air fryer recipes. Stick to 105g for true molasses flavour in dishes like baked beans or ginger cakes.</p>

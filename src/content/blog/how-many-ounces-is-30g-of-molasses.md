<p>30g of molasses equals approximately 1.06 ounces. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements can make or break your dish. Whether you’re whipping up a sticky glaze or baking a moist cake, knowing the exact weight ensures consistency. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we focus on accuracy to help you achieve perfect results every time.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on even cooking, and incorrect measurements can throw off textures and flavours. Molasses, with its thick, sticky consistency, needs careful measuring to avoid overly sweet or dense results. A slight variation in weight can affect the caramelisation process, especially in recipes like gingerbread or barbecue sauces. For more conversion tips, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>  

<p>Using a digital kitchen scale is the best way to measure 30g of molasses accurately. If you don’t have one, a tablespoon can hold roughly 20g, so 1.5 tablespoons will get you close. However, for baking, we always recommend weighing ingredients. Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> for dishes that make the most of molasses.</p>  

<h3>How to measure molasses without a scale</h3>  
<p>If you’re in a pinch, use the displacement method. Fill a measuring cup with water, note the level, then add molasses until the water rises by the equivalent of 1.06 ounces. This trick works well for sticky ingredients like molasses or honey. Just remember to grease your measuring spoon first to help the molasses slide out easily.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for molasses in air fryer recipes</h2>  
<p>Molasses adds depth to both sweet and savoury dishes. In air fryers, it’s perfect for glazing meats like ham or creating rich desserts. Try it in our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>air fryer cake recipes</a> for a moist, flavourful result. Its high sugar content also promotes caramelisation, giving dishes a beautiful golden finish.</p>  

<p>For a quick snack, mix molasses with oats and nuts, then air fry for homemade granola clusters. The sticky sweetness binds the ingredients while the air fryer crisps them perfectly. Cleaning sticky residues? Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner guide</a> has you covered.</p>  

<h3>Storing molasses for long-term use</h3>  
<p>Keep molasses in a cool, dark place to prevent crystallisation. Once opened, it can last up to a year if stored properly. For smaller portions, freeze it in ice cube trays—each cube holds about 30g (1.06 ounces), ready for your next recipe.</p>

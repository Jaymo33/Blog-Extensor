Whether you’re whipping up a sticky glaze or baking a moist cake, knowing the exact weight ensures consistency.

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on even cooking, and incorrect measurements can throw off textures and flavours. Molasses, with its thick, sticky consistency, needs careful measuring to avoid overly sweet or dense results. A slight variation in weight can affect the caramelisation process, especially in recipes like gingerbread or barbecue sauces.

<p>Using a digital kitchen scale is the best way to measure 30g of molasses accurately. If you don’t have one, a tablespoon can hold roughly 20g, so 1.5 tablespoons will get you close. However, for baking, we always recommend weighing ingredients. Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> for dishes that make the most of molasses.</p>  

<h3>How to measure molasses without a scale</h3>

This trick works well for sticky ingredients like molasses or honey. Just remember to grease your measuring spoon first to help the molasses slide out easily.</p>

<p>1 cup of whole milk equals approximately 8.45 ounces (240 ml) in UK measurements. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precision matters, whether you're baking cakes or making creamy sauces. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we know accurate measurements can make or break a dish, so let’s dive deeper into why this matters.</p>

<h2>Why measuring milk correctly matters in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of whole milk ensures your air fryer recipes turn out perfectly. Too little milk can dry out baked goods, while too much may make batters runny. For example, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer pancake recipe</a> relies on precise milk measurements for fluffy results. Whole milk’s fat content (around 3.5%) also affects texture, so measuring by weight (ounces) is often more reliable than volume.</p>  
<p>Many UK cooks use metric measurements, but some older recipes still list cups. If you’re converting from grams, 1 cup of whole milk weighs roughly 240 grams, which aligns with 8.45 ounces. For more conversions, check our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> to simplify your cooking process.</p>

<h2>How to measure 1 cup of whole milk accurately</h2>  
<p>For consistent results, use a liquid measuring cup designed for fluids like milk. Fill it to the 240ml mark (just under 8.5 ounces) at eye level. Avoid using dry measuring cups, as they can lead to over-pouring. If you’re scaling a recipe, remember that 2 cups of whole milk equal about 16.9 ounces.</p>  
<p>Whole milk’s density means it won’t compress like dry ingredients, so you don’t need to worry about packing. However, shaking or stirring the milk first ensures uniformity, especially if it’s been sitting. For recipes like our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>air fryer vanilla cake</a>, this step guarantees even distribution of fat and liquid.</p>

<h3>Common mistakes when measuring milk</h3>  
<p>One frequent error is using a heaped cup, which can add an extra 0.5–1 ounce of milk. Another is substituting skimmed or semi-skimmed milk without adjusting quantities—their lower fat content changes the recipe’s outcome. Always stick to whole milk unless the recipe specifies otherwise.</p>

<h2>Converting other milk quantities to ounces</h2>  
<p>Need smaller or larger amounts? Half a cup of whole milk is about 4.2 ounces, while a quarter cup is roughly 2.1 ounces. For larger batches, 4 cups (1 litre) of whole milk equals approximately 33.8 ounces. These conversions are handy for meal prepping or scaling up <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/breakfast>air fryer breakfast recipes</a>.</p>  
<p>If you’re working with a recipe that lists milk in grams, note that 100 grams of whole milk is roughly 3.5 ounces. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a> includes these details to save you time and avoid kitchen maths.</p>

<h3>When to weigh milk instead of using cups</h3>  
<p>For baking, weighing milk in ounces or grams is often more precise. A kitchen scale eliminates guesswork, especially for recipes like custards or soufflés where liquid ratios are critical. If your air fryer recipe provides weights, opt for those over cup measurements.</p>

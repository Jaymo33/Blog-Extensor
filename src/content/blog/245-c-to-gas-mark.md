<h2>Why Convert 245 C to Gas Mark?</h2>
<p>Many British recipes still use Gas Mark settings, especially for baking and roasting. If you're using an air fryer or a modern oven with Celsius settings, converting 245 C to Gas Mark 9 ensures accuracy.

Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> makes these swaps effortless.</p>
<p>Gas Mark temperatures are based on increments of gas pressure, whereas Celsius measures actual heat. Gas Mark 9 (245 C) is considered a very hot oven, ideal for quick roasting or achieving a golden crust. When using an air fryer at 245 C, you'll get similar results to a Gas Mark 9 oven but often faster due to the concentrated heat circulation. This knowledge helps when adapting traditional recipes for your air fryer.</p>

<h3>Common Uses for 245 C (Gas Mark 9)</h3>
<p>This high temperature is perfect for several cooking techniques. You might use 245 C to Gas Mark 9 for blistering pizza crusts, crisping duck skin, or starting off artisan bread baking.

Always check progress a few minutes early when using these high temperatures.</p>

<h3>Tips for Cooking at 245 C in Your Air Fryer</h3>
<p>At this high heat, preheating your air fryer is crucial for consistent results. Always pat foods dry before cooking to ensure proper crisping at 245 C (Gas Mark 9).

<p>3 tablespoons of jam weigh approximately 60 grams in the UK. This measurement is essential for precise cooking, especially when using an air fryer where ingredient ratios can affect texture and cooking times. Whether you’re making a glaze, filling, or dessert, knowing the exact weight ensures consistency. For more air fryer conversions, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>

<h2>Why accurate jam measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on even heat distribution, so ingredient quantities must be precise. Too much jam can make dishes overly sticky, while too little might leave them dry. Converting 3 tbsp of jam to grams (60g) helps avoid these issues. This is particularly important for recipes like air-fried pastries or glazed meats, where consistency is key. Visit <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>our recipe hub</a> for inspiration.</p>  

<p>Jam density can vary slightly by brand, but 60g is a reliable average. For thicker jams, you might find 3 tbsp closer to 65g, while runnier varieties could be around 55g. Always level off your tablespoons for the most accurate measurement. If you’re meal prepping, weighing jam ensures portion control and perfect results every time.</p>  

<h3>How to measure 3 tbsp of jam without scales</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have scales, use standard UK tablespoons (15ml each) and fill them evenly. Stir the jam first to distribute any syrup, then scoop without packing it down. For sticky jams, lightly grease the spoon to help it slide off cleanly. This method gets you close to the 60g mark, though weighing is always best for precision.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for 3 tbsp of jam in air fryer recipes</h2>  
<p>This quantity is perfect for glazing air-fried chicken or brushing over pastries. Try it in our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>air fryer chicken recipes</a> for a sweet-and-savory twist. You can also mix 60g of jam with vinegar for a quick dipping sauce or swirl it into air-fryer cakes. The possibilities are endless!</p>  

<p>For desserts, 3 tbsp (60g) of jam works well as a filling for thumbprint cookies or as a topping for air-fried cheesecakes. It’s also ideal for portion-controlled servings in <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>air fryer desserts</a>. Remember to adjust cooking times slightly if your jam is particularly sugary, as it can caramelize faster.</p>  

<h3>Storing leftover jam after measuring</h3>  
<p>After scooping out your 3 tbsp, reseal the jar tightly to prevent drying. Wipe the rim clean to avoid stickiness, and store it in the fridge. For longer shelf life, ensure your spoon is clean before dipping it back into the jar. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner guide</a> for tips on tackling sticky messes.</p>

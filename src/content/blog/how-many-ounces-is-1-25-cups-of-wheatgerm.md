<p>1.25 cups of wheatgerm equals approximately 3.5 ounces (or 3.5 oz) when measured accurately.

<h2>Why accurate wheatgerm measurements matter</h2>  
<p>Wheatgerm is a nutrient-dense ingredient packed with vitamins and fibre, making it a popular choice for health-conscious cooks. Using the correct amount ensures your recipes have the right texture and nutritional balance. Too much wheatgerm can make dishes dry, while too little might not deliver the desired crunch. For air fryer users, precise measurements like 1.25 cups to ounces (3.5 oz) help avoid under or overcooking. Explore more healthy <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> to put your wheatgerm to good use.</p>  

<h3>How to measure wheatgerm correctly</h3>  
<p>For the most accurate results, use a kitchen scale to weigh wheatgerm instead of relying solely on cup measurements. Scoop the wheatgerm lightly into a measuring cup and level it off with a straight edge. Avoid packing it down, as this can lead to an incorrect weight. If you don’t have a scale, remember that 1.25 cups of wheatgerm equals roughly 3.5 ounces. This method works well for both UK and US measurements.</p>  

<h2>Using wheatgerm in air fryer recipes</h2>  
<p>Wheatgerm adds a nutty flavour and crunchy texture to air-fried dishes like chicken tenders, fish coatings, or even homemade granola bars. Its high fibre content makes it a healthier alternative to breadcrumbs. When converting 1.25 cups of wheatgerm to ounces (3.5 oz), you can easily adjust recipes to suit your needs. For inspiration, browse our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/breakfast>breakfast recipes</a> featuring wheatgerm as a key ingredient.</p>  

<h3>Storing wheatgerm for freshness</h3>  
<p>To keep wheatgerm fresh, store it in an airtight container in the fridge or freezer. This prevents it from going rancid due to its natural oil content. Measuring out 1.25 cups (3.5 oz) as needed ensures you use it while it’s still at its best. Proper storage also maintains its nutritional value, so your air fryer dishes stay packed with goodness.</p>  

<h2>Common mistakes when measuring wheatgerm</h2>  
<p>One of the biggest mistakes is using a liquid measuring cup instead of a dry one, which can lead to inaccurate amounts. Another error is eyeballing the measurement instead of levelling it off properly. Remember, 1.25 cups of wheatgerm equals 3.5 ounces, so taking the time to measure correctly pays off in the final dish.

<h3>Wheatgerm substitutes in recipes</h3>  
<p>If you run out of wheatgerm, ground flaxseed or almond flour can work as substitutes, though the texture and flavour will vary slightly. Adjust measurements accordingly, as these alternatives may not weigh the same as 1.25 cups of wheatgerm (3.5 oz). Experiment to find what works best for your air fryer creations.</p>

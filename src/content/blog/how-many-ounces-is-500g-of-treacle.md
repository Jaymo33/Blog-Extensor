You might need to reduce cooking time slightly compared to conventional oven recipes. Covering with foil can help prevent over-browning."

<p>500g of treacle equals approximately 17.64 ounces. This conversion is essential for anyone using treacle in baking or air fryer recipes, ensuring precise measurements for perfect results. Whether you're making sticky toffee pudding or glazing meats in your air fryer, knowing how to convert grams to ounces is a game-changer.</p>

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>
<p>Using the right amount of treacle can make or break your dish. Too little, and your glaze won't have that rich, sticky sweetness. Too much, and it could overpower other flavours or even cause burning in the air fryer. That's why conversions like 500g of treacle to ounces are so important for consistent results.</p>
<p>At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we understand that precision matters. Many of our popular recipes, from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>desserts</a> to glazed meats, call for exact treacle measurements. Getting your conversions right means your dishes will turn out perfectly every time.</p>

<h2>How to measure 500g of treacle without scales</h2>
<p>Don't have digital scales? No problem. You can still measure 500g of treacle (about 17.64 ounces) using standard kitchen measurements. One tablespoon of treacle weighs roughly 20g, so 500g would be about 25 tablespoons. Remember, treacle is sticky, so lightly grease your measuring spoon first for accurate results.</p>
<p>For air fryer recipes where precision is key, we recommend investing in a good set of digital scales. This is especially important when working with sticky ingredients like treacle, where volume measurements can be less reliable than weight. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a> for more handy measurement tips.</p>

<h3>The difference between golden syrup and treacle</h3>
<p>While both are sweet syrups, treacle is darker and has a more robust flavour than golden syrup. When converting 500g of treacle to ounces (17.64 oz), note that golden syrup has a slightly different density, so the conversion wouldn't be identical if substituting.</p>

<h2>Using treacle in air fryer recipes</h2>
<p>Treacle works wonderfully in air fryer recipes, from glazing ham to creating sticky marinades. When a recipe calls for 500g of treacle (17.64 ounces), you'll want to measure carefully to balance sweetness and avoid over-caramelisation in the intense heat of the air fryer.</p>
<p>For perfect results every time, browse our collection of <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>treacle-based recipes</a> designed specifically for air fryers. From gingerbread to barbecue sauces, we've got plenty of inspiration for your 500g of treacle.</p>

<h3>Storing leftover treacle</h3>
<p>After measuring out your 500g (17.64 oz) portion, store any leftover treacle in an airtight container. Keep it in a cool, dark place - it doesn't need refrigeration. Proper storage ensures your treacle stays fresh for all your future air fryer creations.</p>

<h2>Converting other common treacle measurements</h2>
<p>While we've focused on converting 500g of treacle to ounces (17.64 oz), you might need other conversions too. Here are some common treacle measurements for air fryer recipes:</p>
<ul>
<li>100g treacle = 3.53 oz</li>

<p>260 ml of buttermilk is approximately 1.1 cups in the US and 1.04 cups in the UK. This conversion is essential for baking and cooking, especially when using an air fryer for recipes that require precise measurements. Whether you're making fluffy pancakes or a moist cake, knowing how to convert millilitres to cups ensures your dish turns out perfectly.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Buttermilk Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Buttermilk plays a crucial role in baking, adding moisture and a slight tang to recipes. Using the wrong amount can affect texture and taste. For air fryer recipes, precision is key, as the cooking process is faster and more intense. A slight imbalance in wet ingredients like buttermilk can lead to dry or overly dense results.</p>  

<p>If you're following a recipe from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, you'll often find measurements in millilitres or cups. Knowing how to convert 260 ml of buttermilk to cups ensures you stay on track. This is especially useful for recipes like buttermilk fried chicken or fluffy scones, where the liquid ratio impacts the final product.</p>  

<h3>US vs UK Cup Measurements</h3>  
<p>It's important to note that US and UK cup measurements differ slightly. A US cup is 240 ml, while a UK cup is 250 ml. For 260 ml of buttermilk, this means 1.1 US cups or 1.04 UK cups. Always check which measurement system your recipe uses to avoid errors.</p>  

<h2>How to Measure Buttermilk Without a Scale</h2>  
<p>If you don't have a kitchen scale, you can still measure 260 ml of buttermilk accurately using a measuring jug or cups. Fill a liquid measuring cup to the 260 ml mark, or use the conversion above for cup measurements. For best results, pour the buttermilk slowly to avoid spills and ensure precision.</p>  

<p>For air fryer recipes, consistency is key. Whether you're making buttermilk biscuits or marinating chicken, accurate measurements ensure even cooking. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more handy measurement tips.</p>  

<h3>Common Recipes Using 260 ml of Buttermilk</h3>  
<p>Many air fryer recipes call for buttermilk, from crispy fried chicken to tender cakes. A 260 ml portion is often used in recipes serving 4-6 people. For example, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>buttermilk fried chicken</a> uses this amount for a perfect marinade.</p>  

<h2>Tips for Storing Leftover Buttermilk</h2>  
<p>If your recipe doesn't use the full 260 ml of buttermilk, store the remainder in an airtight container in the fridge. It stays fresh for up to two weeks. You can also freeze buttermilk in ice cube trays for future use in smaller portions.</p>

<h3>Converting Other Buttermilk Measurements</h3>  
<p>Need to convert a different amount of buttermilk? Use the same ratio: 240 ml per US cup or 250 ml per UK cup. For example, 120 ml is roughly 0.5 US cups or 0.48 UK cups.

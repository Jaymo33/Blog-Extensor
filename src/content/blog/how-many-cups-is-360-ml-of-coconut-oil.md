<p>360 ml of coconut oil equals approximately 1.52 cups. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes, where precise measurements can make or break your dish. Whether you're baking, frying, or roasting, knowing how to convert millilitres to cups ensures consistent results every time. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we focus on making cooking conversions simple, so you can focus on creating delicious meals.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of coconut oil in your air fryer ensures even cooking and prevents dryness or excess grease. Too little oil, and your food may stick or lack crispiness. Too much, and you risk soggy results. Converting 360 ml of coconut oil to cups (1.52 cups) helps maintain balance in recipes like crispy chicken or roasted vegetables. For more conversion tips, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>  

<p>Air fryers rely on hot air circulation, so the right oil quantity enhances texture without overpowering flavours. Whether you're making desserts or savoury dishes, precise measurements ensure perfection. Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a> for inspiration on using coconut oil in your air fryer.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure 360 ml of Coconut Oil Without a Scale</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a measuring jug, use standard cup measurements. Since 1 cup equals 240 ml, 360 ml is roughly 1 and a half cups. For sticky coconut oil, lightly grease the measuring cup for easy release. This method works well for recipes like air-fried tofu or crispy potatoes.</p>  

<h2>Converting 360 ml of Coconut Oil for Different Recipes</h2>  
<p>Baking in an air fryer often requires precise oil measurements. For cakes or cookies, 360 ml (1.52 cups) of coconut oil adds moisture without heaviness. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>cake recipes</a> for ideas. For savoury dishes like roasted vegetables, this amount ensures even coating and crispiness.</p>  

<p>When reheating frozen foods, a light oil spray (equivalent to 360 ml) prevents dryness. Visit our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/frozen-foods>frozen foods section</a> for tips. Remember, coconut oil solidifies when cool, so melt it slightly for accurate measuring.</p>  

<h3>UK vs. US Cup Measurements for Coconut Oil</h3>  
<p>In the UK, 1 cup is 250 ml, while in the US, it’s 240 ml. For 360 ml of coconut oil, UK cooks use roughly 1.44 cups, and US cooks use 1.52 cups. This small difference rarely affects air fryer recipes, but precision matters in baking. Always check your recipe’s origin for the best results.</p>  

<h2>Tips for Storing and Using Coconut Oil in Your Air Fryer</h2>  
<p>Store coconut oil in a cool, dark place to maintain quality. For air frying, melt solidified oil gently before measuring 360 ml (1.52 cups). Use it to grease baskets or mix into batters for even distribution. After cooking, clean your air fryer with <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>recommended cleaners</a> to remove oil residue.</p>  

<p>Coconut oil’s high smoke point makes it ideal for air frying. Whether you’re making crispy shrimp or roasted vegetables, 360 ml provides the right balance. For more tips, browse our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable recipes</a>.</p>

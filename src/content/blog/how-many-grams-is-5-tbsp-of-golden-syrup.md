<p>5 tablespoons (tbsp) of golden syrup equals approximately 105 grams (g). This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements can make or break your dish. Whether you’re whipping up a sticky pudding or glazing roasted vegetables, knowing the exact weight ensures consistency. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we focus on helping you get the best results with accurate conversions.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on even heat distribution, and incorrect ingredient quantities can lead to uneven cooking. Too much golden syrup might cause excessive caramelisation, while too little could leave your dish lacking flavour. Using grams instead of tablespoons removes guesswork, especially since syrup density can vary slightly.

<p>Golden syrup is a staple in British baking, and its thick consistency means volume measurements aren’t always reliable. A digital kitchen scale ensures precision, whether you’re making cakes or marinades. If you’re new to air frying, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a> offers plenty of inspiration with measured ingredients for foolproof results.</p>  

<h3>How to measure golden syrup without a scale</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a scale, levelling off your tablespoons is crucial. Use a straight-edged knife to scrape off excess syrup for an accurate 5 tbsp measurement. Remember, 1 tbsp of golden syrup weighs roughly 21 grams, so 5 tbsp totals around 105 grams. For sticky ingredients like syrup, lightly greasing your spoon can help it slide off easily.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for golden syrup in air fryer recipes</h2>  
<p>Golden syrup adds a rich, caramelised flavour to both sweet and savoury dishes. It’s perfect for glazing <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>air fryer chicken</a> or drizzling over desserts like sticky toffee pudding. Its high sugar content also helps create a crispy exterior on roasted vegetables or <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/potatoes>air fryer potatoes</a>.</p>  

<p>When using golden syrup in marinades, mixing it with acidic ingredients like lemon juice balances the sweetness.

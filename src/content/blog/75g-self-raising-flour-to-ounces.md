    "@type": "Answer",
    "text": "Yes, but check your air fryer capacity first. Doubling 75g to 150g (5.3oz) flour means doubling all ingredients. Some air fryers can't handle large batters - you may need to cook in batches. For best results with doubled recipes, extend cooking time slightly and check doneness with a skewer."

<p>75g of self-raising flour equals approximately 2.65 ounces. This conversion is essential for UK bakers using air fryers, where precise measurements can make or break your baked goods. Whether you're making scones, cakes or batter-based treats in your air fryer, getting the flour quantity right ensures perfect results every time.</p>

<h2>Why accurate flour measurements matter in air fryer baking</h2>
<p>Air fryers cook differently than conventional ovens, with rapid hot air circulation that can affect texture and rise. Using exactly 75g (2.65oz) of self-raising flour as specified in recipes prevents dense or collapsed bakes. The chemical leavening agents in self-raising flour need precise ratios to work effectively - too much or too little can ruin your air fryer creations.</p>
<p>Many popular <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> from cakes to Yorkshire puddings rely on self-raising flour. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a> helps adapt any recipe between metric and imperial measurements. For best results, we recommend using digital scales for 75g measurements rather than volume cups which can vary.</p>

<h3>How to measure 75g of self-raising flour without scales</h3>
<p>If you don't have kitchen scales, 75g (2.65oz) of self-raising flour equals about 5 slightly rounded tablespoons. However, this method isn't as precise - flour settles differently and scooping compacts it. For air fryer baking where precision matters, investing in £10 digital scales from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> ensures perfect results every time.</p>

<h2>Converting other common baking measurements</h2>
<p>When adapting recipes for your air fryer, you'll often need to convert multiple ingredients. Here are some common equivalents to 75g self-raising flour: 150g converts to 5.3oz, while 225g becomes 7.94oz. Remember that US cups differ from UK measurements - always check which system your recipe uses.</p>
<p>For successful air fryer baking, maintain all ingredient ratios. If converting a cake recipe calling for 75g self-raising flour (2.65oz), ensure butter, sugar and eggs are also accurately measured. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>cake recipes</a> section includes pre-converted measurements for foolproof air fryer baking.</p>

<h3>Storing self-raising flour for air fryer use</h3>
<p>To keep your 75g portions of self-raising flour fresh between bakes, store in an airtight container in a cool, dark place. The raising agents lose potency over time - check the best before date and give the container a shake before measuring out your 2.65oz portions. For best results in air fryer baking, use flour within 3 months of opening.</p>

<h2>Troubleshooting air fryer baking with self-raising flour</h2>
<p>If your air fryer bakes with 75g self-raising flour aren't rising properly, check your flour's freshness first. Old self-raising flour may need supplementing with 1/2 tsp baking powder per 75g (2.65oz). Also ensure you're not overmixing batter - gentle folding preserves the air bubbles essential for good rise in air fryer baking.</p>
<p>Temperature matters too - most air fryer baking works best at 160-180°C. For perfect scones using 75g self-raising flour, try our tested <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/breakfast>breakfast recipes</a> with precise timings and temperatures. Remember to preheat your air fryer for consistent results with your 2.65oz flour measurements.</p>

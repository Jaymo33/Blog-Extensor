<p>4 tablespoons (tbsp) of treacle weigh approximately 85 grams (g). This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precision ensures perfect results. Whether you’re making sticky toffee pudding or glazing meats, knowing the exact weight helps avoid mishaps. For more air fryer conversions, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate treacle measurements matter</h2>  
<p>Treacle is a thick, sticky syrup that adds depth to both sweet and savoury dishes. Using too much or too little can throw off the balance of your recipe. In an air fryer, where cooking times are shorter, precise measurements ensure even cooking and perfect texture. If you’re experimenting with treacle-based marinades or desserts, accuracy is key. Visit <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>our recipe collection</a> for inspiration.</p>  

<p>Many UK recipes list treacle in tablespoons, but grams provide a more reliable measurement. A kitchen scale eliminates guesswork, especially for sticky ingredients like treacle. For consistent results in air fryer baking, always measure by weight. If you’re new to air frying, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> guides can help you master the basics.</p>  

<h3>How to measure treacle without a scale</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a scale, use the spoon-and-level method for treacle. Fill your tablespoon to the brim, then scrape off the excess with a straight edge. Repeat four times to measure 4 tbsp accurately. Remember, treacle’s viscosity means it clings to spoons, so take your time. For sticky ingredients, a non-stick <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner</a> makes post-cooking cleanup a breeze.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for treacle in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Treacle works wonders in air fryer desserts like gingerbread or flapjacks. Its rich, molasses-like flavour also enhances glazes for meats like gammon or chicken. When using treacle in marinades, mix it with acidic ingredients to balance sweetness. For savoury ideas, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipes</a> section.</p>  

<p>In baking, treacle adds moisture and a distinct caramel note. Air fryers excel at small-batch baking, making them ideal for treacle-based treats. Since air frying circulates heat evenly, treacle-glazed items caramelise beautifully. For more dessert inspiration, browse our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>cake recipes</a> tailored for air fryers.</p>  

<h3>Storing treacle for long-term use</h3>  
<p>Treacle lasts indefinitely when stored properly. Keep it in a cool, dark place and ensure the lid is tightly sealed. If crystallization occurs, gently warm the treacle in a water bath. Always use clean utensils to prevent contamination. For more kitchen tips, <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> offers plenty of expert advice.</p>

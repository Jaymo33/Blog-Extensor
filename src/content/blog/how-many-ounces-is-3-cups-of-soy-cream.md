<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>

<p>Many air fryer recipes call for soy cream as a lighter alternative to heavy cream. Whether you're making a vegan cheesecake or a creamy pasta sauce, 3 cups of soy cream (24 ounces) is a common measurement. Always measure liquids in a clear jug for accuracy, and level off the top for precision.</p>  

<h2>How to measure soy cream for air fryer recipes</h2>  
<p>For best results, use a liquid measuring cup for soy cream. Fill it to the 3-cup mark, then check the weight if your recipe requires ounces.

This method works for most <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert recipes</a>.</p>

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on precise cooking times and temperatures, and ingredient measurements play a crucial role in achieving the best results. Using the correct amount of miso soup, for example, ensures your marinades or sauces aren’t too salty or diluted. This is especially important for recipes like miso-glazed chicken or tofu, where balance is key. If you're new to air fryer cooking, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a> offers plenty of inspiration.</p>  

<p>Measuring 0.125 cup of miso soup as 1 ounce simplifies the process, especially when scaling recipes up or down. This small but mighty measurement can make a big difference in dishes like miso soup with mushrooms or a quick shrimp stir-fry.

<h3>How to measure 0.125 cup of miso soup</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a measuring cup marked for 0.125 cups (which is 2 tablespoons), you can use a kitchen scale to weigh out 1 ounce of miso soup. This method is often more accurate and eliminates the need for multiple measuring tools. For those who love precision, a digital scale is a great investment for air fryer cooking. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning guide</a> to keep your tools in top shape.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for 0.125 cup of miso soup</h2>  
<p>This small amount of miso soup is perfect for adding depth to marinades, dressings, or glazes in air fryer recipes. For example, a miso glaze for salmon or tofu often calls for this exact measurement. It’s also great for enhancing the flavour of vegetables like mushrooms or broccoli when roasted in the air fryer. Discover more ideas in our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/tofu>tofu recipes</a>.</p>  

<p>Another popular use is in soups or broths, where 0.125 cup of miso soup can be diluted with water or stock for a quick base. This measurement ensures the soup isn’t overly salty while still packing a flavour punch. Whether you're cooking for one or meal prepping, knowing this conversion is a game-changer. For more meal prep tips, visit our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>homepage</a>.</p>  

<h3>Tips for storing miso soup</h3>  
<p>Miso soup can be stored in the fridge for up to a week, so measuring out 0.125 cup portions is a great way to keep it fresh. You can also freeze it in ice cube trays for easy use later. This is especially handy for air fryer cooks who want to add a quick burst of umami to their dishes. Just thaw a cube (about 1 ounce) and you’re good to go.</p>

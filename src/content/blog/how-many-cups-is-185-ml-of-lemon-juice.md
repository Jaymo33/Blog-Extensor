Whether you're making a zesty marinade or a tangy dessert, knowing how to convert millilitres to cups ensures your dish turns out perfectly every time.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter</h2>
<p>When it comes to cooking, especially in an air fryer, precision is key. Too much or too little lemon juice can drastically alter the flavour and texture of your dish. For example, if you're making lemon drizzle cake or a citrusy glaze for salmon, 185 ml of lemon juice needs to be measured correctly. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes</a>, you'll find plenty of dishes where this conversion comes in handy.</p>
<p>Using the right amount of lemon juice also affects the acidity balance in recipes like dressings or marinades. A slight miscalculation could make your dish too tart or too bland. That's why knowing that 185 ml of lemon juice is roughly 0.78 cups can save your meal from disaster.</p>

<h2>How to Measure 185 ml of Lemon Juice</h2>
<p>If you don't have a measuring jug with millilitre markings, don't worry. You can still measure 185 ml of lemon juice accurately using a standard cup. Since 1 cup is about 240 ml, 185 ml is just under four-fifths of a cup. For best results, use a liquid measuring cup for precision.</p>
<p>Another handy trick is to use tablespoons. There are roughly 15 ml in a tablespoon, so 185 ml of lemon juice equals about 12.3 tablespoons. This method is great for smaller batches or when you need incremental adjustments.

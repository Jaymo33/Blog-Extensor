<p>5 tablespoons (tbsp) of chopped onion is approximately 40 grams (g). This conversion is essential for precise cooking, especially when using an air fryer where ingredient accuracy can affect texture and cooking times. Whether you're following a recipe from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> or improvising, knowing the weight ensures consistency.</p>

<h2>Why accurate onion measurements matter</h2>  
<p>Chopped onion is a staple in many dishes, from air fryer fajitas to hearty stews. Measuring by weight (grams) is more reliable than volume (tablespoons) because onion pieces can vary in size and density. For example, finely diced onion packs more tightly into a tablespoon than roughly chopped pieces. This difference can impact the flavour balance in recipes like those found in our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>vegetable air fryer collection</a>.</p>  

<p>When using an air fryer, precise measurements help prevent overcrowding and ensure even cooking. Too much onion can create excess moisture, leading to steaming rather than crisping. This is particularly important for recipes like air-fried onion rings or caramelised onion toppings where texture is key.</p>  

<h3>How to measure chopped onion correctly</h3>  
<p>For the most accurate 5 tbsp chopped onion to grams conversion, use the spoon-and-level method. Gently fill your tablespoon with chopped onion without packing it down, then level off the top with a knife. Repeat until you have 5 level tablespoons. For best results, weigh this amount on digital kitchen scales to confirm it's around 40g.</p>  

<h2>Conversion chart for different onion preparations</h2>  
<p>While 5 tbsp of standard chopped onion equals about 40g, other preparations vary. Finely minced onion weighs slightly more at approximately 45g per 5 tbsp due to tighter packing. Conversely, roughly chopped onion may weigh closer to 35g for the same volume. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> includes these variations for perfect results every time.</p>  

<p>When substituting onion powder for fresh, use 1 teaspoon of powder for every 40g (5 tbsp) of chopped onion. This ratio works well in air fryer rubs and coatings. Remember that powdered onion is more concentrated, so adjust to taste, especially in delicate recipes like those in our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable recipe category</a>.</p>  

<h3>Adjusting air fryer recipes with onion</h3>  
<p>If a recipe calls for 40g onion but you only have tablespoons, now you know 5 tbsp is the equivalent. This conversion helps when scaling recipes up or down for your air fryer capacity. For larger batches, remember that 100g onion equals about 12.5 tbsp chopped. Always leave enough space in your air fryer basket for proper air circulation when cooking onion-heavy dishes.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for 5 tbsp (40g) chopped onion</h2>  
<p>This quantity is perfect for flavouring air fryer dishes without overwhelming other ingredients. Try it in homemade burger patties, stuffed mushrooms, or as a base for air-fried frittatas. The <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> team recommends this amount for seasoning 500g of potatoes for crispy air fryer roasties.</p>  

<p>For caramelised onions in the air fryer, start with 40g (5 tbsp) chopped onion mixed with a teaspoon of oil. Cook at 160°C for 12-15 minutes, shaking occasionally. This creates the perfect topping for air-fried burgers or sausages. After cooking, don't forget to clean your air fryer with our recommended <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning products</a> to remove onion odours.</p>

<h2>Understanding the Conversion</h2>
<p>Converting millilitres to cups can be tricky, especially when dealing with liquids like single cream. The UK and US use slightly different cup measurements, which can affect your recipe. In the UK, 1 cup is 250 ml, while in the US, it's 240 ml. This means 935 ml of single cream is roughly 3.95 cups in the UK and 4.2 cups in the US. Always double-check your recipe's origin to ensure accuracy.</p>
<p>Single cream is a staple in many dishes, from soups to desserts. If you're using an air fryer, precise measurements can make or break your dish.

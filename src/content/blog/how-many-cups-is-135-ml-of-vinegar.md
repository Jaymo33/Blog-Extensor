<p>135 ml of vinegar equals approximately 0.57 cups (just over half a cup). This conversion is essential for precise cooking and baking, especially when using an air fryer where exact measurements can impact texture and flavour.

When air frying, precise measurements help achieve the perfect crispiness and moisture retention. For example, a marinade with 135 ml of vinegar (0.57 cups) can tenderise chicken beautifully without being overly sour.</p>

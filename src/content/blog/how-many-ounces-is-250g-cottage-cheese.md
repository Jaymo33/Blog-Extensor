<h2>Why Convert 250g of Cottage Cheese to Ounces?</h2>  
<p>Many UK recipes, especially those for air fryers, use grams, while some kitchen scales or older cookbooks might list ounces. Converting 250g of cottage cheese to ounces (8.82 oz) helps avoid guesswork and ensures consistency. If you're following a recipe from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, this conversion ensures your dish turns out just right.</p>  
<p>Cottage cheese is a versatile ingredient, perfect for air fryer-friendly dishes like stuffed mushrooms or protein-packed snacks. Accurate measurements matter because too much or too little can affect texture and flavour.

<h2>How to Measure 250g of Cottage Cheese Accurately</h2>

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>

<h2>How to measure apple cider vinegar correctly</h2>
<p>Using a kitchen scale is the most accurate way to measure 2 tbsp of apple cider vinegar in grams. Simply place your container on the scale, tare it to zero, and pour until you hit 30 grams.

<h3>Does the brand of apple cider vinegar affect the weight?</h3>
<p>Most apple cider vinegar brands have a similar density, so 2 tbsp will generally weigh around 30 grams. However, organic or unfiltered varieties might have slight variations due to sediment. For best results, always measure by weight when precision is key, especially in baking or marinades.</p>

<p>250g of tomato paste equals approximately 8.82 ounces. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes, ensuring accurate measurements for perfect results. Whether you're prepping a homemade pizza sauce or a rich stew, knowing how to convert grams to ounces is a kitchen must. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we focus on making cooking simpler with precise conversions and delicious recipes.</p>

<h2>Why Convert 250g Tomato Paste to Ounces?</h2>  
<p>Many UK recipes use grams, while others rely on ounces, especially when referencing international cookbooks or air fryer guides. Converting 250g of tomato paste to ounces ensures consistency in your dishes. Air fryer cooking, in particular, benefits from precise measurements to avoid overly dry or soggy results.

<p>Tomato paste is a concentrated ingredient, so even small measurement errors can impact flavour. Whether you're making a pasta sauce or marinating chicken, accuracy matters. Our guide helps you nail the 250g tomato paste to ounces conversion every time.</p>  

<h2>How to Measure 250g of Tomato Paste</h2>  
<p>If you don’t have a kitchen scale, you can still measure 250g of tomato paste using volume. One tablespoon of tomato paste weighs roughly 15g, so 250g would be about 16-17 tablespoons. However, weighing is far more accurate, especially for air fryer recipes where consistency is key.</p>  

<h3>Using a Kitchen Scale</h3>  
<p>Place a bowl on your kitchen scale, tare it to zero, then spoon in the tomato paste until you reach 250g. This method eliminates guesswork and ensures your dish turns out perfectly.

<p>100 grams of self-raising flour equals approximately 0.8 cups (UK) or 0.75 cups (US). This conversion ensures your baking measurements are spot-on, whether you're whipping up cakes, muffins, or air fryer-friendly treats. Getting the right amount of self-raising flour is crucial for achieving the perfect rise and texture in your baked goods.</p>  

<h2>Understanding Self-Raising Flour Measurements</h2>  
<p>Self-raising flour is a staple in British baking, combining plain flour with baking powder for a convenient rise. When converting 100 grams of self-raising flour to cups, it's essential to consider regional differences. In the UK, 100 grams equals roughly 0.8 cups, while in the US, it's closer to 0.75 cups. This variation stems from slight differences in cup sizes between countries.</p>  

<p>For air fryer recipes, precision matters—too much flour can lead to dense results, while too little may cause your bakes to collapse. If you're unsure, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for quick reference. Measuring by weight (grams) is always more accurate, but cups work well for quick, everyday baking.</p>  

<h3>Why Accuracy Matters in Baking</h3>  
<p>Baking is a science, and even small measurement errors can affect your results. Self-raising flour already contains leavening agents, so getting the quantity right ensures your cakes and muffins rise perfectly. For best results, use a digital kitchen scale for grams or a proper measuring cup for volume.</p>  

<h2>Converting 100g Self-Raising Flour to Cups</h2>  
<p>If you don’t have a scale, spoon the flour into a measuring cup and level it off with a knife for accuracy. Scooping directly from the bag can compact the flour, leading to incorrect measurements. For 100 grams of self-raising flour, you’ll need just under a full cup in the UK or about three-quarters of a US cup.</p>  

<p>Need more baking inspiration? Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> for delicious treats that make the most of self-raising flour. From fluffy scones to quick breads, precise measurements ensure success every time.</p>  

<h3>Common Mistakes When Measuring Flour</h3>  
<p>Many bakers accidentally pack flour into cups, leading to excess flour and dry baked goods. Always fluff the flour first, then spoon it gently into the cup. Another tip? Sift the flour after measuring to ensure even distribution of the raising agents.</p>  

<h2>Using Self-Raising Flour in Air Fryer Recipes</h2>  
<p>Air fryers work wonders with self-raising flour—think golden-brown muffins, mini cakes, and even doughnuts. Since air fryers cook faster than conventional ovens, precise measurements prevent undercooked or overly dry results. For best outcomes, stick to trusted recipes or adjust cook times based on your air fryer model.</p>  

<p>Looking for a deep clean after baking? Check out our guide on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>how to clean your air fryer</a> to keep it in top shape. A well-maintained air fryer ensures consistent cooking and better-tasting bakes.</p>  

<h3>Adjusting Recipes for Different Cup Sizes</h3>  
<p>If a recipe calls for 100 grams of self-raising flour but you’re using US cups, remember to adjust slightly. Too much flour can make batters stiff, while too little may cause flat results. When in doubt, refer back to weight measurements for foolproof baking.</p>  

<h2>Alternative Uses for Self-Raising Flour</h2>  
<p>Beyond cakes and muffins, self-raising flour works great in savoury air fryer recipes like quick breads or dumplings. Try it in our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/potatoes>potato-based recipes</a> for extra fluffiness. Just remember—100 grams equals roughly 0.8 UK cups or 0.75 US cups for consistent results.</p>  

<p>For those who love experimenting, self-raising flour can even be used in homemade pizza dough or air-fried fritters. The key is measuring accurately to maintain the right texture and rise.</p>

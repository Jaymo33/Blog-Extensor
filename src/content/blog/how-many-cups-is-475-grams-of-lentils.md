<h3>How to Measure 475 Grams of Lentils</h3>  
<p>To measure 475 grams of lentils, use a kitchen scale for the most accurate results. If you don’t have one, fluff the lentils with a fork before lightly spooning them into a measuring cup. Avoid packing them down, as this can lead to an incorrect measurement.</p>  

<h2>Converting Grams to Cups for Different Lentil Types</h2>  
<p>Different lentil varieties may have slightly varying densities, affecting the conversion from grams to cups. For example, split red lentils may measure differently than whole green lentils. Always refer to the packaging or a trusted source like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> for specific conversions.</p>  

<p>If you're using pre-cooked lentils, remember that their volume increases significantly. For air fryer recipes, it's best to measure them after cooking if the recipe specifies.

<h3>Common Mistakes When Measuring Lentils</h3>

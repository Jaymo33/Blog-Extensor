<p id="">A 4 liter air fryer is a compact countertop appliance with a 4-litre capacity cooking basket, ideal for 1-2 people or small batch cooking. This mid-range size offers more versatility than mini air fryers while taking up less space than larger models.</p><h2 id="">Who should choose a 4 litre air fryer?</h2><p id="">This capacity hits the sweet spot for singles, couples, or small families who want to cook meals without wasting energy heating a large empty basket.

Digital models like the Tower 4L Digital Air Fryer offer precise temperature control for perfect results.</p><h2 id="">Top features to look for</h2><p id="">When choosing between 4 litre air fryers, prioritise models with at least 1500W power for efficient cooking.

Measure your available space - some Tower 4L models are surprisingly compact despite their capacity. Consider storing on a pull-out shelf if counter space is limited.</p><p id="">The vertical design of most air fryer 4L units means they take up minimal footprint. Some owners repurpose the basket for serving - a clever dual-use for small kitchens. Just ensure proper ventilation space around the appliance during operation.</p>

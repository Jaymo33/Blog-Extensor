<p>Using the correct amount of chilli sauce ensures your dish isn’t overly spicy or bland. Air fryers cook food quickly, so imbalances in seasoning can be more noticeable. Whether you’re making wings, stir-fries, or dips, 30g of chilli sauce (1.06 oz) is a common measurement. If you’re unsure, start with a little less and adjust to taste.

<h2>How to measure 30g of chilli sauce accurately</h2>
<p>Measuring 30g of chilli sauce can be tricky if you don’t have a kitchen scale. One tablespoon of chilli sauce typically weighs around 15g, so two tablespoons would give you roughly 30g (1.06 oz). However, sauces vary in density, so a scale is the most accurate tool. If you’re using a measuring spoon, level it off for consistency. For sticky sauces, lightly grease the spoon to help it slide off easily.</p>

<h3>Tools for converting 30g to ounces</h3>
<p>A digital kitchen scale is the best tool for converting 30g of chilli sauce to ounces. Look for one with a tare function to zero out the weight of your container. If you don’t have a scale, online converters or conversion charts can help. Remember that 30g equals 1.06 oz, so you can also use fluid ounce measurements for liquids.

<h2>Using 30g of chilli sauce in air fryer recipes</h2>
<p>30g of chilli sauce is a versatile amount for many air fryer dishes. It’s enough to coat a small batch of wings or mix into a marinade for chicken or tofu. The air fryer’s high heat caramelises the sauce, enhancing its flavour. For a balanced dish, pair 30g of chilli sauce with other ingredients like honey or soy sauce. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipes</a> for ideas on incorporating chilli sauce.</p>

<p>If you’re making a dipping sauce, 30g of chilli sauce can be mixed with mayo or yogurt for a milder taste. The air fryer’s quick cooking time means sauces can thicken and intensify, so adjust quantities accordingly. Always taste as you go, especially when working with spicy ingredients.

<h2>Common mistakes when measuring 30g of chilli sauce</h2>
<p>One common mistake is assuming all sauces weigh the same per volume. Thicker chilli sauces will weigh more per tablespoon than thinner ones, so 30g might look different depending on the brand. Another error is not zeroing the scale before measuring, leading to inaccurate amounts. Always measure sauces at room temperature, as cold sauces can be denser. For sticky sauces, use a spatula to scrape out every bit for precision.</p>

<h3>Adjusting recipes for personal taste</h3>
<p>While 30g of chilli sauce equals 1.06 oz, you might want to adjust this based on your heat preference. Start with slightly less if you’re sensitive to spice, or add more if you love a fiery kick. The air fryer’s concentrated heat can amplify spiciness, so err on the side of caution. Remember, you can always add more sauce but can’t take it out once it’s mixed in.

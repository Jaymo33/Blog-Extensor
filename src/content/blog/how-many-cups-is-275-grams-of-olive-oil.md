<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of olive oil can affect the texture and flavour of your air fryer dishes. Too little oil, and your food may turn out dry; too much, and it could become greasy. Converting 275 grams of olive oil to cups helps you strike the perfect balance. This is especially important for recipes like crispy potatoes or roasted vegetables, where oil plays a key role. Visit <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>our recipe collection</a> for inspiration.</p>  

<p>Olive oil is a staple in many air fryer recipes, from Mediterranean dishes to quick weeknight meals. Knowing that 275 grams of olive oil equals roughly 1.16 cups simplifies your prep work. This measurement is based on the standard UK cup size, which holds 240ml. If you're using a US cup (236.59ml), the difference is minimal but worth noting for precision.

<h3>How to Measure Olive Oil Without Scales</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a kitchen scale, you can still measure 275 grams of olive oil using cups. One cup of olive oil weighs about 237 grams, so 275 grams is slightly more than one cup. Use a measuring jug for accuracy, and remember that olive oil’s density can vary slightly.

<h2>Common Uses for 275 Grams of Olive Oil in Air Fryers</h2>  
<p>This amount of olive oil is perfect for coating vegetables, marinating meats, or making dressings. For example, 275 grams (1.16 cups) of olive oil can coat a large batch of air-fried potatoes or chicken thighs. It’s also ideal for recipes like garlic-infused oil or herb dips. Find more ideas in our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipes</a> section.</p>  

<p>When converting 275 grams of olive oil to cups, consider the recipe’s requirements. Some dishes, like air-fried fish or tofu, need a light coating, while others may require more. Always adjust based on your air fryer’s size and the ingredients’ absorbency. For crispy, golden results, measure carefully and enjoy experimenting with flavours.</p>  

<h3>Tips for Storing Olive Oil for Air Fryer Use</h3>  
<p>To keep your olive oil fresh, store it in a cool, dark place away from heat. Exposure to light and air can degrade its quality over time. If you frequently use 275 grams (1.16 cups) of olive oil, consider buying in bulk and decanting smaller amounts. This ensures your oil stays flavourful for every air fryer dish you create.</p>

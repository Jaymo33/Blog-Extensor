<p>20g of icing sugar is approximately 0.71 ounces. This conversion is essential for bakers and home cooks who need precise measurements for recipes, especially when using an air fryer for desserts. Whether you’re making frosting, dusting cakes, or preparing air fryer-friendly treats, knowing how to convert grams to ounces ensures accuracy.</p>  

<h2>Why Convert 20g of Icing Sugar to Ounces?</h2>  
<p>Many UK recipes use metric measurements, but some kitchen scales or older cookbooks might display ounces. Converting 20g of icing sugar to ounces (0.71 oz) helps avoid guesswork and ensures your baked goods turn out perfectly. This is particularly useful for air fryer recipes, where precise measurements can affect texture and consistency.</p>  
<p>If you’re exploring <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer dessert recipes</a>, accurate sugar measurements are key. Too much or too little icing sugar can alter the sweetness and structure of your treats. For more conversions, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure 20g of Icing Sugar Without a Scale</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a digital scale, you can use tablespoons to measure 20g of icing sugar. One level tablespoon holds roughly 10g, so two tablespoons will give you close to 20g (0.71 oz). However, for best results, a scale is recommended, especially for air fryer baking where precision matters.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for 20g of Icing Sugar</h2>  
<p>Icing sugar is versatile and often used in small quantities. 20g (0.71 oz) is perfect for dusting pancakes, topping <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>air fryer cakes</a>, or making a small batch of glaze. It’s also ideal for lightening whipped cream or sweetening frostings without overpowering other flavours.</p>  
<p>When working with air fryer desserts, 20g of icing sugar can be the difference between a perfectly balanced treat and an overly sweet one. For more tips, visit <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>.</p>  

<h3>Converting Other Sugar Amounts</h3>  
<p>Need to convert different amounts? Here’s a quick reference: 10g = 0.35 oz, 50g = 1.76 oz, and 100g = 3.53 oz. Bookmark our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a> for easy access to these measurements while cooking or baking.</p>  

<h2>Tips for Storing Icing Sugar</h2>  
<p>Keep your icing sugar fresh by storing it in an airtight container away from moisture. Humidity can cause clumping, making it harder to measure accurately. If your sugar has hardened, sieve it before use to restore its fine texture—especially important for air fryer recipes where even distribution matters.</p>

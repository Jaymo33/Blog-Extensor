<p>210 ml of evaporated milk equals approximately 0.89 cups (just under 1 cup). This conversion is essential for precise baking and cooking, especially when using an air fryer where measurements matter. Whether you're whipping up a dessert or a savoury dish, knowing how to convert millilitres to cups ensures perfect results every time.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>When working with evaporated milk, even small measurement errors can affect texture and taste. Air fryer recipes, like those on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes</a>, often rely on precise ratios for optimal results. Using 210 ml of evaporated milk instead of the correct cup measurement could make your dish too dry or too moist. For example, a creamy custard or a fluffy cake depends on the right balance of ingredients.</p>  

<p>Evaporated milk is thicker and richer than regular milk, so substituting it incorrectly can throw off your recipe. If you're converting 210 ml of evaporated milk to cups, always use a standard measuring cup for accuracy. This is especially important for air fryer baking, where consistency is key to achieving that perfect golden finish.</p>  

<h3>UK vs. US Cup Measurements</h3>  
<p>In the UK, a standard cup measures 250 ml, while in the US, it's 240 ml. This means 210 ml of evaporated milk is roughly 0.84 US cups or 0.89 UK cups. For most recipes, this small difference won’t matter, but for precision baking, it’s worth noting. Always check whether your recipe uses UK or US measurements to avoid confusion.</p>  

<h2>How to Measure 210 ml Without a Measuring Cup</h2>  
<p>If you don’t have a measuring cup, you can still measure 210 ml of evaporated milk accurately. Use a kitchen scale—evaporated milk weighs roughly 252 grams per 210 ml (since its density is about 1.2 g/ml). Alternatively, use tablespoons: 210 ml is about 14 UK tablespoons or 14.2 US tablespoons. Just be sure to level them off for accuracy.</p>  

<p>Another handy trick is to use a standard drinking glass, which often holds around 200-250 ml. Fill it just below the rim for 210 ml. For more air fryer measurement hacks, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air-fryer-conversion-chart</a>.</p>  

<h3>Common Recipes Using 210 ml of Evaporated Milk</h3>  
<p>Many desserts, like fudge or tres leches cake, call for 210 ml of evaporated milk. It’s also great in creamy pasta sauces or mashed potatoes made in the air fryer. For inspiration, browse our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert recipes</a> featuring this ingredient.</p>  

<h2>Storing Leftover Evaporated Milk</h2>  
<p>If your recipe only uses part of a can, transfer the remaining 210 ml of evaporated milk to an airtight container. It keeps for up to 5 days in the fridge. You can also freeze it in ice cube trays for later use in smoothies or sauces. Just thaw and stir well before using.</p>

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on hot air circulation to cook food evenly, and incorrect seasoning quantities can throw off the balance. Too much minced onion might burn, while too little could leave your dish bland. Measuring 0.5 tbsp of minced onion as 3 grams ensures consistency, especially in recipes like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable-based air fryer dishes</a>. Digital scales are ideal for this, but if you don’t have one, levelling off your tablespoon is the next best option.</p>  

<p>Many UK cooks prefer weight measurements for dry ingredients like minced onion because volume can vary based on how finely it’s chopped. A tightly packed 0.5 tbsp might weigh slightly more, while a loosely filled one could be less. For foolproof results, stick to the 3-gram benchmark and adjust to taste after cooking.

<h3>How to measure minced onion without a scale</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a scale, use a flat-edged knife to level off your 0.5 tbsp of minced onion. Avoid packing it down unless the recipe specifies. For reference, one medium onion yields about 4 tbsp when minced, so 0.5 tbsp is roughly 1/8 of an onion. This method works well for <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken marinades</a> or spice blends where small quantities matter.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for 0.5 tbsp minced onion in air fryer recipes</h2>  
<p>This small but mighty quantity adds depth to rubs, coatings, and stuffings. Try it in air-fried meatballs, crispy tofu, or sprinkled over roasted potatoes. Since air fryers intensify flavours, 3 grams of minced onion (0.5 tbsp) delivers noticeable taste without overpowering. For dishes like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/beef>beef burgers</a>, mix it directly into the patty mixture for even distribution.</p>  

<p>Dehydrated minced onion is another great option—it’s lighter by volume, so 0.5 tbsp weighs closer to 2 grams. Rehydrate it with a splash of water before use. Always check your specific product’s packaging for exact weights, as brands vary. Need cleaning tips after working with pungent onions?

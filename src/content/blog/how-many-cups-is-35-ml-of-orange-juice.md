<p>35 ml of orange juice equals approximately 0.15 cups (or roughly 1/6 of a cup). This conversion is handy for air fryer recipes where precise measurements matter, whether you're baking, marinating, or making sauces. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we know how crucial accurate measurements are for perfect results every time.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of ingredients ensures your air fryer dishes turn out just right. Too much or too little liquid, like orange juice, can affect texture and flavour. For example, a marinade with 35 ml of orange juice needs the correct balance to tenderise meat without overpowering it. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipes section</a> for dishes where precise measurements make all the difference.</p>  

<p>Air fryers cook food faster than conventional ovens, so even small measurement errors can lead to dry or undercooked meals. Whether you're making glazes, dressings, or baking, knowing that 35 ml of orange juice is about 0.15 cups helps maintain consistency. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a> simplifies these calculations for all your cooking needs.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure 35 ml of Orange Juice Without a Scale</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a measuring jug, use a tablespoon—one tablespoon holds about 15 ml, so 35 ml is just over two tablespoons. For recipes requiring exact amounts, like our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert category</a>, measuring tools are essential. A standard UK cup is 250 ml, making 35 ml roughly 1/6 of a cup.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for 35 ml of Orange Juice in Air Fryer Recipes</h2>  
<p>Orange juice adds brightness to marinades, glazes, and even baked goods. A 35 ml portion is perfect for small batches, like glazing chicken wings or adding zest to cakes. Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipes</a> for ideas on incorporating citrus flavours. The acidity in orange juice also helps tenderise meats, making it a versatile ingredient.</p>  

<p>In baking, 35 ml of orange juice can replace some of the liquid in muffin or cake batters for a subtle citrus twist. Since air fryers circulate hot air, recipes with precise moisture levels, like those in our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>cakes section</a>, benefit from accurate measurements. Too much juice can make batters runny, while too little may leave them dry.</p>  

<h3>Converting 35 ml of Orange Juice for Different Recipes</h3>  
<p>Recipes from the US often use cups, while UK recipes favour millilitres. Knowing that 35 ml is 0.15 cups helps adapt international recipes for your air fryer.

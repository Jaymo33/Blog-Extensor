<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>
<p>Air fryers rely on precise ingredient ratios to achieve the best texture and flavour. Too much or too little almond butter can affect the moisture and binding of your recipe. For example, adding 3.75 grams instead of eyeballing ensures your energy balls hold together perfectly. Many UK cooks prefer weighing ingredients for reliability, especially with sticky substances like almond butter. Visit <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>our recipe collection</a> for dishes that benefit from exact measurements.</p>

<p>Digital kitchen scales are a game-changer for converting tablespoons to grams. They eliminate guesswork and provide consistent results, which is crucial for baking in an air fryer. If you're new to using scales, start with small quantities like 0.25 tbsp to get comfortable. Over time, you’ll notice how accurate measurements improve your cooking.

<h2>How to measure 0.25 tbsp of almond butter without scales</h2>
<p>If you don’t have scales, you can still measure 0.25 tbsp of almond butter using a standard tablespoon. Fill it halfway to the 0.5 tbsp mark, then halve that portion visually. This method isn’t as precise as weighing but works in a pinch for recipes where slight variations won’t ruin the dish. Almond butter’s thick consistency makes it easier to measure compared to liquids.

<h3>Common uses for 0.25 tbsp of almond butter</h3>

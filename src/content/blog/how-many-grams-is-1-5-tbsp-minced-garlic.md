<p>1.5 tablespoons (tbsp) of minced garlic equals approximately 12 grams. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precision ensures even cooking and perfect flavour. Whether you're whipping up garlic-infused dishes or following a specific recipe, knowing the exact weight saves time and avoids guesswork.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate minced garlic measurements matter</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of minced garlic can make or break your air fryer dish. Too little, and the flavour falls flat; too much, and it overpowers other ingredients. For dishes like garlic butter shrimp or roasted vegetables, 1.5 tbsp minced garlic (12 grams) strikes the ideal balance. It’s especially handy when following recipes from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, where precise measurements guarantee delicious results.</p>  

<p>Garlic’s potency varies depending on how finely it’s minced, so weighing ensures consistency. If you’re meal prepping or scaling recipes, converting tablespoons to grams eliminates confusion. Plus, air fryers cook quickly, so evenly distributed garlic means no burnt or undercooked bits.</p>  

<h2>How to measure minced garlic correctly</h2>  
<p>Measuring minced garlic isn’t just about scooping it into a spoon. For accuracy, lightly pack the minced garlic into the tablespoon without pressing too hard. Level off the excess with a knife for a clean 1.5 tbsp measurement. If you’re using a kitchen scale, tare it to zero before adding the garlic to get exactly 12 grams.</p>  

<h3>Tools for precise measurements</h3>  
<p>A digital kitchen scale is the most reliable way to measure 1.5 tbsp minced garlic in grams. If you don’t have one, use standard UK measuring spoons and refer to conversion charts like our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion guide</a>. Avoid using heaped tablespoons, as this can add up to 50% more garlic than intended.</p>  

<h2>Common recipes using 1.5 tbsp minced garlic</h2>  
<p>Many air fryer recipes call for 1.5 tbsp minced garlic, from garlic bread to marinades. For example, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>garlic butter chicken</a> relies on this measurement for the perfect glaze. Roasted potatoes or mushrooms also benefit from 12 grams of minced garlic, evenly distributed for maximum flavour.</p>  

<p>If you’re experimenting with frozen foods like garlic prawns or pre-marinated meats, check labels to adjust quantities. Some pre-packaged items already contain garlic, so you might need less. Always taste-test before adding extra.</p>  

<h3>Storing minced garlic for convenience</h3>  
<p>Pre-minced garlic in jars is a time-saver, but fresh garlic delivers better flavour. To store minced garlic, freeze it in 1.5 tbsp (12g) portions in ice cube trays. Pop one out whenever your <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>air fryer recipe</a> calls for it. This method retains freshness and eliminates measuring hassles mid-cook.</p>  

<h2>Adjusting garlic quantities for taste</h2>  
<p>While 1.5 tbsp minced garlic equals 12 grams, personal preference matters. If you love bold flavours, add an extra gram or two. For milder dishes, reduce to 10 grams. Remember, air frying intensifies garlic’s aroma, so start conservative and adjust later. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning tips</a> also help remove lingering garlic smells from your appliance.</p>  

<p>For recipes like garlic tofu or vegetarian stir-fries, balance is key. Pair 1.5 tbsp minced garlic with herbs or citrus to avoid overwhelming delicate ingredients. Always note adjustments for next time, especially if meal prepping multiple servings.</p>

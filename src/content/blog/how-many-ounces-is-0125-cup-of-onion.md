<p>0.125 cup of onion equals approximately 1 ounce (0.99 oz to be precise). This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precision ensures perfect results every time. Whether you're making crispy onion toppings or adding flavour to dishes, knowing the exact weight helps balance textures and flavours.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Onion Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>When using an air fryer, consistency is key. Too much onion can lead to uneven cooking, while too little might leave your dish lacking flavour. Converting 0.125 cup of onion to ounces ensures you get the right amount for recipes like air-fried onion rings or stir-fries. For more air fryer measurement tips, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>  

<p>Onions vary in density depending on how they're chopped—finely diced onions pack more tightly than roughly sliced ones. That’s why weight (ounces) is often more reliable than volume (cups) for air fryer cooking. If you're prepping ahead, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable recipe category</a> has plenty of inspiration.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure 0.125 Cup of Onion</h3>  
<p>Use a measuring cup for liquids or a kitchen scale for the most accurate results. For 0.125 cup (which is 2 tablespoons), lightly fill the cup without packing the onion down. If using a scale, aim for just under 1 ounce (about 28 grams). This method works for all onion types, from red to white.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for 0.125 Cup of Onion</h2>  
<p>This small but mighty amount is perfect for adding depth to sauces, garnishing soups, or mixing into air-fryer-friendly batters. Try it in our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> for crispy shallots or caramelised onion toppings. Since air fryers cook quickly, precise measurements prevent burning or undercooking.</p>  

<p>If you're working with frozen onions, note that they may release more moisture. Adjust cooking times slightly and pat them dry before air frying. For more tips on handling frozen ingredients, visit our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/frozen-foods>frozen foods section</a>.</p>  

<h3>Scaling Up or Down</h3>  
<p>Need more or less than 0.125 cup? Simply multiply the ounces accordingly—for example, 0.25 cup would be roughly 2 ounces. Keep conversions handy with our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning and maintenance guide</a>, so your air fryer stays in top shape for precise cooking.</p>

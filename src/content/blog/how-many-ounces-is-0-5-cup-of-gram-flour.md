<p>0.5 cup of gram flour equals approximately 2.5 ounces (oz). This conversion is essential for precise measurements, especially when preparing air fryer recipes where accuracy impacts texture and cooking times. Gram flour, also known as besan, is a staple in many dishes, from crispy snacks to gluten-free baking. Understanding how to convert cups to ounces ensures your recipes turn out perfectly every time.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>When using an air fryer, precise measurements can make or break a dish. Too much or too little gram flour can affect how ingredients bind, crisp, or cook. For example, if you're making <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer pakoras</a>, the right amount of gram flour ensures a light, crispy texture. Similarly, baking in an air fryer requires exact ratios to avoid dense or dry results.</p>  
<p>Converting 0.5 cup of gram flour to ounces (2.5 oz) helps maintain consistency across recipes. Whether you're following a <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a> or scaling ingredients, knowing this measurement simplifies meal prep. It also ensures you don’t waste ingredients or end up with disappointing results.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure Gram Flour Correctly</h3>  
<p>To measure 0.5 cup of gram flour accurately, use the spoon-and-level method. Lightly spoon the flour into a measuring cup without packing it down, then level off the excess with a straight edge. This prevents compacting, which can lead to using more flour than intended. For best results, weigh it on a kitchen scale—2.5 oz is the ideal weight for 0.5 cup.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for Gram Flour in Air Fryer Recipes</h2>  
<p>Gram flour is incredibly versatile in air fryer cooking. It’s often used as a coating for <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken</a> or vegetables, creating a crispy exterior without deep frying. It’s also a key ingredient in gluten-free batters, like those for onion bhajis or crispy tofu. Knowing how many ounces are in 0.5 cup helps you adapt recipes effortlessly.</p>  
<p>Beyond coatings, gram flour works well in binding mixtures for veggie burgers or falafel. If you’re making <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable fritters</a>, the right amount ensures they hold together without becoming too dense. Accurate measurements also matter for baking—gram flour adds structure to gluten-free cakes and breads.</p>  

<h3>Tips for Storing Gram Flour</h3>  
<p>To keep gram flour fresh, store it in an airtight container in a cool, dark place. Exposure to moisture or heat can cause clumping or spoilage. If you buy in bulk, consider freezing portions to extend shelf life. Proper storage ensures your 0.5 cup measurements remain consistent over time.</p>  

<h2>Converting Other Gram Flour Measurements</h2>  
<p>If you need to scale up or down, here’s a quick reference: 1 cup of gram flour equals roughly 5 oz, while ¼ cup is about 1.25 oz. These conversions are handy for doubling recipes or making smaller batches. For more precise adjustments, a digital scale is your best friend—especially when working with air fryer recipes.</p>

Whether you’re whipping up cakes, muffins, or even savoury dishes, knowing how to convert grams to ounces can save time and avoid mishaps. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we understand the importance of accurate measurements, especially when experimenting with air fryer baking.</p>  

<h2>Why Convert 40g of Baking Powder to Ounces?</h2>  
<p>Many UK recipes use grams, while others rely on ounces, making conversions a common kitchen task. Baking powder is a leavening agent, and even small measurement errors can affect texture and rise.

<p>Air fryers heat quickly, so precise measurements prevent over- or under-leavening.

<h3>How to Measure 40g of Baking Powder Accurately</h3>  
<p>Use a digital kitchen scale for the most precise measurement. Scoop baking powder lightly into a measuring spoon or cup, then level it off.

For air fryer recipes, accuracy ensures even cooking and perfect texture.</p>

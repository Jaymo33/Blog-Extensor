<p>0.25 tbsp of baking soda equals approximately 3.75 grams. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements can make or break your dish. Whether you’re whipping up fluffy cakes or crispy snacks, knowing the exact weight ensures consistent results every time.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on even heat distribution, and incorrect ingredient quantities can lead to uneven cooking or texture issues. Baking soda, in particular, affects leavening and browning, so getting the grams right is crucial. For example, too much baking soda can leave a bitter taste, while too little might result in dense baked goods.</p>

<h3>How to measure 0.25 tbsp of baking soda without a scale</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a digital scale, use a measuring spoon and level it off with a straight edge. For 0.25 tbsp, fill a tablespoon halfway and then halve that amount. This method isn’t as precise as weighing, but it’s handy in a pinch. For best results, invest in a small kitchen scale—they’re affordable and incredibly useful for air fryer cooking.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for baking soda in air fryer recipes</h2>  
<p>Baking soda isn’t just for cakes—it’s a versatile ingredient in air fryer cooking. It helps crisp up chicken wings, lighten batter for tempura, and even clean your air fryer basket. For a deep clean, mix baking soda with water to form a paste, scrub gently, and rinse.

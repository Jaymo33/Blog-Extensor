<p>0.25 cup of sweet chilli sauce equals approximately 2 ounces (oz). This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes, where precise measurements can make or break a dish. Whether you’re marinating chicken or glazing shrimp, knowing the exact weight ensures consistent results. For more handy conversions, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on even heat distribution, and incorrect ingredient quantities can lead to uneven cooking. Using 0.25 cup of sweet chilli sauce (2 oz) ensures your marinades or glazes coat food perfectly. Too much sauce can make dishes soggy, while too little might leave them dry. For recipe inspiration, browse our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> collection.</p>  

<p>Sweet chilli sauce is a versatile ingredient in air fryer cooking, adding a tangy-sweet kick to proteins and veggies. Measuring 0.25 cup (2 oz) accurately helps balance flavours without overpowering other ingredients. If you’re prepping meals in advance, this measurement ensures consistency across batches.</p>  

<h3>How to measure 0.25 cup of sweet chilli sauce</h3>  
<p>Use a liquid measuring cup for the most accurate results. Pour the sweet chilli sauce to the 0.25 cup mark, ensuring it sits level. Alternatively, a kitchen scale set to ounces will confirm you have exactly 2 oz. For sticky sauces, lightly grease the measuring cup for easy release.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for 0.25 cup sweet chilli sauce in air fryers</h2>  
<p>This quantity is perfect for glazing <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>air fryer chicken</a> wings or drizzling over crispy tofu. It’s also ideal for marinating shrimp or brushing onto vegetables before cooking. The 2 oz measurement ensures even coverage without excess pooling at the bottom of the basket.</p>  

<p>For cleaning sticky residue, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner guide</a> has you covered. Sweet chilli sauce can caramelise during cooking, so proper maintenance keeps your appliance in top condition. Always measure carefully to minimise mess and maximise flavour.</p>  

<h3>Converting other sweet chilli sauce quantities</h3>  
<p>If your recipe calls for a different amount, remember that 1 cup equals 8 oz. Half a cup is 4 oz, and 0.75 cup translates to 6 oz. These conversions work for most liquid ingredients in air fryer cooking, ensuring precision in every dish.</p>

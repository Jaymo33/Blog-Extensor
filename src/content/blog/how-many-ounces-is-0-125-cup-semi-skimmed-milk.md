<p>0.125 cup of semi skimmed milk equals 1 fluid ounce (oz). This measurement is essential for air fryer recipes where precision matters, whether you're baking, making sauces, or preparing meals. Getting the right amount ensures your dishes turn out perfectly every time.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on precise ingredient ratios to deliver consistent results. Using too much or too little liquid, like semi skimmed milk, can affect texture and cooking times. For example, adding 0.125 cup (1 oz) of semi skimmed milk to a batter ensures it’s neither too thick nor too runny. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more handy measurement tips.</p>  

<p>Recipes like air fryer pancakes or cakes often call for small amounts of milk. Knowing that 0.125 cup of semi skimmed milk is 1 oz helps avoid guesswork.

<h2>How to measure 0.125 cup of semi skimmed milk</h2>  
<p>Measuring 0.125 cup (1 oz) of semi skimmed milk can be tricky without the right tools. A liquid measuring cup with clear markings is ideal. Alternatively, use a tablespoon—0.125 cup equals 2 tablespoons. For even more precision, a kitchen scale set to ounces ensures you get exactly 1 oz of semi skimmed milk.</p>  

<h3>Using a kitchen scale for accuracy</h3>  
<p>A digital kitchen scale is the best way to measure 0.125 cup of semi skimmed milk in ounces. Simply place your container on the scale, tare it to zero, and pour until it reads 1 oz. This method eliminates errors and is perfect for <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> requiring exact measurements.</p>  

<h2>Common recipes using 0.125 cup of semi skimmed milk</h2>

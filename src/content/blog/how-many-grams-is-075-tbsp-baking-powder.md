<p>Baking powder is a leavening agent, meaning it helps baked goods rise. Too little, and your air fryer cakes or muffins will be dense. Too much, and they might collapse or taste bitter.

Always use a digital scale for the best results, especially when working with small quantities.</p>  

<p>If you're converting from volume (tbsp) to weight (grams), factors like compaction and brand can slightly alter the weight.

<h3>How to measure 0.75 tbsp baking powder without scales</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a scale, use a measuring spoon and level it off with a knife. For 0.75 tbsp, fill a 1 tbsp measure three-quarters full. This method isn’t as precise as weighing but works in a pinch. For consistent results in recipes like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>air fryer cakes</a>, we recommend investing in a kitchen scale.</p>

<p>243 C converts to approximately 220 C in a fan oven. This is because fan ovens circulate hot air, allowing you to reduce the temperature by about 20 C compared to conventional ovens. If you're using an air fryer, which works similarly to a fan oven, you'll want to set it to 220 C for best results. This conversion ensures your food cooks evenly without burning. Whether you're baking cakes or roasting vegetables, this adjustment is essential.</p>

<h2>Why Convert 243 C to Fan Oven?</h2>
<p>Fan ovens and air fryers use convection heating, which means they cook food faster and more evenly. By lowering the temperature from 243 C to 220 C, you prevent overcooking while maintaining perfect texture. This is especially important for delicate dishes like soufflés or pastries. Many recipes on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes</a> are designed with fan ovens in mind. Understanding this conversion helps you adapt any recipe effortlessly.</p>

<p>For example, if you're making a cake that requires 243 C in a conventional oven, setting your fan oven to 220 C will yield the same results. The circulating air ensures even browning and a fluffy interior. This principle applies to air fryers as well, making them versatile for baking and roasting.

<h3>How Does This Affect Air Fryer Cooking?</h3>
<p>Air fryers operate like mini fan ovens, so the same temperature rules apply. Setting your air fryer to 220 C when a recipe calls for 243 C ensures crispy, evenly cooked food. This is ideal for dishes like roasted potatoes or chicken wings. The reduced temperature prevents the exterior from burning before the inside is done.

<h2>Common Uses for 243 C in Fan Ovens</h2>
<p>220 C (the fan oven equivalent of 243 C) is perfect for roasting meats, baking bread, and crisping vegetables. It’s a versatile temperature that works well for many dishes. For instance, roasting a chicken at this temperature ensures juicy meat with a golden skin. Similarly, baking cookies at 220 C in a fan oven gives them a crisp edge and chewy center.

<p>This temperature is also great for reheating leftovers in an air fryer. It revives fried foods like chips or spring rolls without making them soggy. Just remember to adjust the time slightly, as fan ovens and air fryers cook faster. Keeping your appliance clean is equally important; check out our guide on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaning</a> for best practices.</p>

<h3>Tips for Perfect Results</h3>
<p>Always preheat your fan oven or air fryer to 220 C before cooking. This ensures consistent heat from the start, which is crucial for baking. Use an oven thermometer to verify the temperature, as some models may vary. For even cooking, rotate trays or shake the air fryer basket halfway through. These small steps make a big difference in achieving professional-quality results at home.</p>

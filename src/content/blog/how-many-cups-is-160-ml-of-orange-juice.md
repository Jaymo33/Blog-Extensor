<p>160 ml of orange juice is approximately 0.68 cups (just over two-thirds of a cup). This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements can make or break a dish. Whether you’re whipping up a citrus glaze or a marinade, knowing how to convert millilitres to cups ensures consistent results. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we focus on making cooking conversions effortless, so you can focus on creating delicious meals.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of liquid, like 160 ml of orange juice, is crucial for air fryer recipes. Too much liquid can make food soggy, while too little may dry it out. Many air fryer recipes, such as glazes or marinades, rely on precise ratios to achieve the perfect texture and flavour. For example, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>citrus-glazed salmon</a> requires exact measurements to balance sweetness and acidity.</p>  

<p>Converting 160 ml of orange juice to cups ensures you’re following recipes correctly, especially when baking. A slight miscalculation can affect the rise of cakes or the consistency of sauces. If you’re unsure about other conversions, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for quick reference.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure 160 ml of Orange Juice Without a Measuring Cup</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a measuring cup handy, you can still measure 160 ml of orange juice accurately. A standard UK tablespoon holds 15 ml, so roughly 10.5 tablespoons will give you 160 ml. Alternatively, use a kitchen scale—160 ml of orange juice weighs about 160 grams. This method is handy for recipes like our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>orange-infused desserts</a>, where precision is key.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for 160 ml of Orange Juice in Air Fryer Recipes</h2>  
<p>160 ml of orange juice is a versatile ingredient in air fryer cooking. It’s perfect for marinades, glazes, or even as a base for sauces. For instance, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>orange-glazed chicken</a> uses this exact measurement to create a sticky, flavourful coating. The acidity in orange juice also helps tenderise meats, making it a great addition to marinades.</p>  

<p>In baking, 160 ml of orange juice can be used in cakes or muffins to add moisture and a subtle citrus flavour. If you’re experimenting with recipes, always start with accurate measurements to avoid disappointment. For more inspiration, browse our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a> at airfryerrecipe.co.uk.</p>  

<h3>Converting 160 ml of Orange Juice for US and UK Recipes</h3>  
<p>It’s worth noting that cup sizes differ between the US and UK. A US cup is 240 ml, while a UK cup is 250 ml. For 160 ml of orange juice, this means approximately 0.68 US cups or 0.64 UK cups. Most modern recipes specify which measurement system they use, but when in doubt, stick to millilitres for accuracy. This is especially important for air fryer recipes, where even small discrepancies can affect cooking times and results.</p>

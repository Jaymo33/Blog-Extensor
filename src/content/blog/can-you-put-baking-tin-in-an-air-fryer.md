<p>Yes, you can put a baking tin in an air fryer if it fits properly and is heat-resistant. Most metal baking tins are safe up to 220°C, which covers typical air frying temperatures. However, you must ensure the tin doesn’t block the air fryer’s fan or heating elements.</p>

<h2>Understanding Air Fryer and Baking Tin Compatibility</h2>
<p>Air fryers work by circulating hot air around food at high speed, which requires unobstructed airflow. When using a baking tin in an air fryer, choose shallow tins no taller than 2 inches to prevent disrupting this crucial air circulation. Round or square cake tins often fit better than rectangular roasting tins in compact air fryer baskets.</p>
<p>Check your air fryer’s manual for specific guidance on metal cookware – some models like the Ninja Foodi explicitly approve metal tins. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we’ve tested various tins across popular UK models and found most work well for baking small batches of <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>cakes</a> or <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cookies>cookies</a>.</p>

<h3>Will a Baking Tin Melt in the Air Fryer?</h3>
<p>Standard metal baking tins won’t melt in an air fryer as they’re designed for oven use up to 250°C. However, avoid thin disposable foil tins which may warp at high temperatures. Silicone-coated or non-stick tins are also safe provided they’re oven-rated.</p>

<h2>Safety Considerations When Using Baking Tins</h2>
<p>Never let the baking tin touch the heating element at the top of your air fryer, as this could cause scorching or smoke. Always leave at least 1 inch clearance around all sides of the tin for proper airflow. Preheat your air fryer for 3 minutes before adding the tin to prevent uneven cooking.</p>
<p>For those concerned about potential scratching, place a parchment liner at the bottom of the tin. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaning guide</a> shows how to maintain your appliance after using metal cookware. Remember that dark metal tins absorb more heat – reduce temperature by 10°C using our handy <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a>.</p>

<h3>Can Baking Tins Catch Fire in Air Fryers?</h3>
<p>Properly used baking tins pose minimal fire risk in air fryers. The main danger comes from grease buildup – always wipe tins clean between uses. Avoid using tins with plastic handles or decorative elements that aren’t heatproof.</p>

<h2>Best Practices for Baking in Your Air Fryer</h2>
<p>For optimal results when using a baking tin in your air fryer, reduce standard oven recipes by 20°C and check food 5 minutes early. Smaller 6-inch tins work better than large ones, allowing heat to circulate around all sides. Rotate the tin halfway through cooking for even browning.</p>
<p>Many <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> adapt beautifully to tin cooking – try individual Yorkshire puddings or mini quiches. The concentrated heat creates wonderful crusts while keeping centres moist. Just remember metal conducts heat faster than air frying baskets, so adjust times accordingly.</p>

<h3>Reheating Food in Baking Tins</h3>
<p>Baking tins are excellent for reheating saucy dishes like lasagne or shepherd’s pie in your air fryer. The metal base helps crisp toppings while preventing sauce from dripping through the basket. Cover loosely with foil for the first half of reheating to prevent drying out.</p>

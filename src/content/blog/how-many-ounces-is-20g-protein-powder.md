<p>20g of protein powder equals approximately 0.705 ounces. This conversion is handy when you're preparing recipes, especially for air fryer meal prep where precise measurements matter. Whether you're making protein pancakes or adding powder to shakes, knowing the exact weight ensures consistency in your cooking.</p>  

<h2>Why Convert 20g of Protein Powder to Ounces?</h2>  
<p>Many UK recipes, especially those on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, use grams, but some kitchen scales or American recipes might list ounces. Converting 20g of protein powder to ounces helps avoid guesswork. This is particularly useful for air fryer recipes, where ingredient ratios affect texture and cooking time. For example, adding too much protein powder to a batter can make it dense.</p>  

<p>If you're meal prepping high-protein snacks like energy balls or bars, accuracy ensures the right consistency. A slight miscalculation could throw off the entire batch. That’s why keeping a conversion chart, like the one on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>our site</a>, is a game-changer for home cooks.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure 20g of Protein Powder Without Scales</h3>  
<p>Don’t have a scale? A standard UK tablespoon holds roughly 10g of protein powder, so two level tablespoons equal 20g (or 0.705 oz). Scoop lightly to avoid packing too much powder into the spoon. For fluffier powders, fluff the container first to prevent compacting. This method works well for recipes like air-fried protein muffins or shakes.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for 20g of Protein Powder</h2>  
<p>Protein powder isn’t just for shakes—it’s a versatile ingredient in air fryer cooking. Try adding 20g (0.705 oz) to pancake batter for a high-protein breakfast. You’ll find plenty of inspiration in the <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/breakfast>breakfast category</a> on our site. It also works well in homemade protein bars or as a coating for air-fried chicken tenders.</p>  

<p>For desserts, 20g of protein powder can replace some flour in cookies or cakes. Just adjust liquids slightly, as protein powder absorbs moisture. Check out the <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert recipes</a> for ideas. Remember, precise measurements like 20g to ounces ensure your treats turn out perfectly every time.</p>  

<h3>Does Protein Powder Type Affect the Weight?</h3>  
<p>Whey, plant-based, and casein powders vary slightly in density, but 20g of any type still equals ~0.705 oz. Whey is typically lighter, so you might get a heaped tablespoon, while plant-based powders can be denser. When converting 20g of protein powder to ounces, stick to weight for accuracy, especially in baking.</p>

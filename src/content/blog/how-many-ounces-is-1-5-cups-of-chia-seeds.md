<p>1.5 cups of chia seeds equals approximately 7.5 ounces (213 grams). This conversion is essential for accurate measurements in recipes, especially when using an air fryer for baking or meal prep. Chia seeds are a versatile ingredient, often used in puddings, smoothies, and even as an egg substitute, so knowing their weight ensures perfect results every time.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurement Matters</h2>  
<p>When working with chia seeds, precision is key. Too much or too little can affect the texture and consistency of your dish. For example, if you’re making chia pudding in your air fryer, the wrong amount could leave it too thick or runny. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we recommend using a kitchen scale for the most accurate results, but cup-to-ounce conversions are handy when you’re in a pinch.</p>  

<p>Chia seeds absorb liquid, so their weight can vary slightly depending on moisture. However, 1.5 cups of dry chia seeds will consistently weigh around 7.5 ounces. This makes them ideal for recipes like energy bars or crusts for air-fried desserts, where exact proportions matter. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more handy measurement tips.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure Chia Seeds Without a Scale</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a scale, use the spoon-and-level method for cups. Gently spoon chia seeds into a measuring cup and level off the top with a knife. Avoid packing them down, as this can lead to over-measuring. For 1.5 cups, you’ll need three half-cup measures filled this way to hit roughly 7.5 ounces.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for 1.5 Cups of Chia Seeds</h2>  
<p>Chia seeds are a powerhouse ingredient in many air fryer recipes. From breakfast bowls to crunchy toppings, 1.5 cups (7.5 ounces) can go a long way. Try them in overnight oats, sprinkled over air-fried avocado toast, or mixed into homemade granola. For inspiration, browse our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipes</a> section for creative ideas.</p>  

<p>Another popular use is as a binder in vegan baking. Replace eggs by mixing 1 tablespoon of chia seeds with 3 tablespoons of water per egg. With 1.5 cups, you could make a batch of air-fried chia seed crackers or a nutrient-packed loaf. Just remember to adjust other dry ingredients accordingly to maintain balance.</p>  

<h3>Storing Chia Seeds for Freshness</h3>  
<p>To keep your chia seeds fresh, store them in an airtight container in a cool, dark place. A 1.5-cup batch (7.5 ounces) will last up to two years if stored properly. Avoid humidity, as chia seeds can clump when exposed to moisture.

<h2>Converting Other Chia Seed Measurements</h2>  
<p>Need smaller or larger amounts? Here’s a quick reference: 1 cup of chia seeds = 5 ounces (142 grams), while 2 cups = 10 ounces (284 grams). These conversions are useful for scaling recipes up or down, whether you’re meal prepping or cooking for one.

<p>For those who love baking, chia seeds can also replace flour in gluten-free recipes. A 1.5-cup (7.5-ounce) portion works well in air-fried muffins or bread. Just blend them into a fine powder first for a smoother texture.

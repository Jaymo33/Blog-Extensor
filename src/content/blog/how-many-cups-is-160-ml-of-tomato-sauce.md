<p>160 ml of tomato sauce is approximately 0.68 cups (just over 2/3 of a cup). This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes, where precise measurements can make or break a dish. Whether you're making a rich pasta sauce or a marinade for chicken, knowing how to convert millilitres to cups ensures consistent results every time. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we focus on simplifying kitchen conversions to help you cook with confidence.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on even heat distribution, so ingredient ratios are crucial. Too much tomato sauce can make dishes soggy, while too little might leave them dry. For example, if you're making a <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipe</a>, 160 ml of tomato sauce (0.68 cups) is often the perfect amount for a marinade. This precision ensures your chicken stays juicy without overpowering other flavours. Many air fryer enthusiasts swear by measuring liquids correctly to avoid common pitfalls.</p>  

<p>Tomato sauce is a staple in many dishes, from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>quick weeknight meals</a> to elaborate dinners. Converting 160 ml to cups helps streamline your prep, especially when following American recipes that use cup measurements. A handy <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a> can save time, but memorising key measurements like this one makes cooking even smoother.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure 160 ml of Tomato Sauce Without a Measuring Cup</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a measuring cup, use a standard metric jug or weigh the sauce. Since tomato sauce has a similar density to water, 160 ml weighs roughly 160 grams. Alternatively, a tablespoon holds about 15 ml, so 10 tablespoons plus 2 teaspoons will get you close to 160 ml. For air fryer recipes, slight variations won’t ruin your dish, but precision helps replicate successful results.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for 160 ml of Tomato Sauce in Air Fryer Recipes</h2>  
<p>This quantity is ideal for coating proteins like chicken or tofu evenly. For example, a <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable bake</a> might call for 160 ml of tomato sauce as a base layer. It’s also enough for a small batch of air-fried meatballs or a dipping sauce for crispy snacks. Since air fryers cook faster than ovens, the right sauce quantity ensures flavours meld perfectly without excess moisture.</p>  

<p>When making <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/potatoes>potato wedges</a>, 160 ml of tomato sauce can serve as a dipping portion for 2–3 people. If you’re meal prepping, this measurement scales easily—double it for a family-sized portion. Always check your air fryer’s capacity to avoid overfilling, as crowded baskets cook unevenly.

<h3>Adjusting Recipes for UK vs. US Measurements</h3>  
<p>American recipes often list tomato sauce in cups, while UK recipes use millilitres. If a recipe calls for "1 cup of tomato sauce," you’ll need about 240 ml. For 160 ml (0.68 cups), reduce the quantity slightly if adapting from a 1-cup measurement. This adjustment ensures your air fryer dishes turn out as intended, whether you’re cooking British classics or international favourites.</p>

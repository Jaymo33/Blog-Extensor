    "@type": "Answer",
    "text": "375 grams of granulated sugar can impact browning and texture in air fryer baking. Too much sugar may cause excessive caramelisation or uneven cooking. Always measure carefully and adjust cooking times if needed. The air fryer's rapid air circulation means sugars can brown faster than in a conventional oven."

    "acceptedAnswer": {
    "@type": "Answer",
    "text": "The difference stems from historical measurement standards. A UK cup is 250ml, while a US cup is 240ml. This small volume difference affects how much granulated sugar fits in each cup. For 375 grams, the variance is minimal (1.875 UK cups vs. 1.89 US cups), but it's worth noting for precision baking."

<p>375 grams of granulated sugar is approximately 1.875 cups in the UK and 1.89 cups in the US. This conversion is essential for baking and cooking, especially when using an air fryer for desserts or sweet treats. Whether you're whipping up a cake or preparing a glaze, knowing how many cups 375 grams of granulated sugar equals ensures accuracy in your recipes.</p>

<h2>Understanding Granulated Sugar Measurements</h2>
<p>Granulated sugar is a staple in baking, but its density can vary slightly depending on how it's packed. For 375 grams of granulated sugar, the conversion to cups isn't always straightforward due to these variations. In the UK, 1 cup of granulated sugar typically weighs 200 grams, while in the US, it's around 198 grams. This means 375 grams of granulated sugar translates to roughly 1.875 cups in the UK and 1.89 cups in the US.</p>
<p>When using an air fryer for recipes like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>cakes</a> or cookies, precise measurements are crucial. Too much or too little sugar can affect texture and taste. Always use a kitchen scale for the most accurate results, especially when dealing with 375 grams of granulated sugar.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Sugar Measurements Matter</h2>
<p>Accurate measurements ensure your baked goods turn out perfectly every time. Whether you're converting 375 grams of granulated sugar to cups for a classic sponge cake or a batch of cookies, precision is key. Over-measuring can make desserts overly sweet or cause them to brown too quickly in the air fryer.</p>
<p>For air fryer recipes, sugar plays a role in caramelisation and texture. If you're adapting a traditional oven recipe for the air fryer, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> to adjust cooking times and temperatures accordingly.</p>

<h3>UK vs. US Cup Measurements</h3>
<p>The difference between UK and US cup measurements might seem small, but it can add up in recipes requiring 375 grams of granulated sugar. In the UK, a standard cup holds 200 grams of granulated sugar, while in the US, it's slightly less at 198 grams. This means 375 grams of granulated sugar is about 1.875 cups in the UK and 1.89 cups in the US.</p>

<h2>Tips for Measuring Granulated Sugar</h2>
<p>For the most accurate results, use a digital kitchen scale to measure 375 grams of granulated sugar directly. If you don't have a scale, spoon the sugar into a measuring cup and level it off with a knife. Avoid packing the sugar down, as this can lead to over-measuring.</p>
<p>When baking in an air fryer, consistency is key. Whether you're making <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cookies>cookies</a> or a dessert, ensure your 375 grams of granulated sugar is measured correctly for the best results. For more tips, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a>.</p>

<h3>Common Mistakes to Avoid</h3>
<p>One common mistake is scooping sugar directly from the bag with a measuring cup, which can compact it and result in too much sugar. Another is using the wrong type of cup measurement—always check whether your recipe uses UK or US cups when converting 375 grams of granulated sugar.</p>

<h2>Converting Other Sugar Quantities</h2>
<p>If you're working with amounts other than 375 grams of granulated sugar, the same principles apply. For example, 200 grams is roughly 1 cup in the UK and 1.01 cups in the US. Always refer to a reliable conversion chart or use a kitchen scale for precision.</p>

<p>235 ml of apple cider vinegar equals approximately 1 cup (0.99 cups to be precise). This conversion is essential for recipes requiring precise measurements, especially when using an air fryer for dishes like marinades or dressings. Whether you're following a recipe from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> or experimenting with your own, knowing this conversion ensures perfect results every time.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>When cooking or baking, especially with an air fryer, precise measurements can make or break a dish. Too much apple cider vinegar can overpower flavours, while too little might leave your recipe lacking acidity. For air fryer recipes like glazes or sauces, a slight variation can affect texture and taste. That’s why converting 235 ml of apple cider vinegar to cups correctly is crucial.</p>  

<p>Many recipes on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes</a> rely on exact liquid measurements to ensure consistency. Whether you're making a tangy marinade for chicken or a zesty dressing for salads, knowing that 235 ml is just under 1 cup helps streamline your cooking process. This is particularly useful for air fryer users who need quick, reliable measurements without fuss.</p>  

<h2>How to Measure 235 ml of Apple Cider Vinegar</h2>  
<p>If you don’t have a measuring jug with millilitre markings, you can still measure 235 ml of apple cider vinegar accurately. A standard US cup holds 240 ml, so 235 ml is just a fraction less—about 98% of a cup. For UK cooks, a metric cup is 250 ml, meaning 235 ml is roughly 0.94 cups.</p>  

<h3>Using Kitchen Scales</h3>  
<p>For even greater precision, consider weighing your apple cider vinegar. Since 1 ml of vinegar weighs approximately 1 gram, 235 ml would be about 235 grams. This method is ideal for baking recipes where exact proportions are key, such as air fryer cakes or breads.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for 235 ml of Apple Cider Vinegar</h2>  
<p>Apple cider vinegar is a versatile ingredient in both cooking and cleaning. In the kitchen, 235 ml (or roughly 1 cup) is often used for marinades, pickling solutions, or homemade dressings. It’s also a popular addition to air fryer recipes for deglazing or adding acidity to dishes like pulled pork or roasted vegetables.</p>  

<p>Beyond cooking, apple cider vinegar can be used for cleaning your air fryer. A mixture of 235 ml vinegar and water makes an effective, natural cleaner.

<h2>Converting Other Liquid Measurements</h2>  
<p>If you frequently work with millilitres and cups, a conversion chart can be a lifesaver. For example, 120 ml is half a cup, while 470 ml would be 2 cups. Keeping a reference like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart</a> handy ensures you’ll never second-guess measurements again.</p>  

<h3>Adjusting Recipes for the Air Fryer</h3>  
<p>When adapting traditional recipes for the air fryer, liquid measurements like 235 ml of apple cider vinegar may need slight tweaks. Since air fryers cook faster, reducing liquids by 10-15% can prevent sogginess. Always test and adjust based on your specific model and recipe requirements.</p>

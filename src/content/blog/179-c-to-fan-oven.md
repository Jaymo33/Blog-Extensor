<p>179 C in a fan oven is equivalent to approximately 160 C in a conventional oven without the fan. This temperature adjustment ensures even cooking in air fryers and convection ovens, which circulate hot air for faster, crispier results. Whether you're baking, roasting, or reheating, understanding this conversion helps achieve restaurant-quality dishes at home. For more air fryer temperature guides, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a>.</p>  

<h2>Why Convert 179 C for Fan Ovens?</h2>  
<p>Fan ovens and air fryers cook food faster due to circulating hot air, so reducing the temperature by 20°C prevents overcooking. At 179 C, a fan oven mimics the heat intensity of a traditional oven at 160 C, ideal for delicate pastries or slow-roasted meats. This adjustment is especially useful for recipes from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>cake collections</a> that require precise temperatures. Always preheat your appliance for consistent results, and use an oven thermometer to verify accuracy.</p>  

<p>For air fryers, 179 C works well for crispy fries or <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken wings</a>, as the fan distributes heat evenly. If your recipe originally calls for 179 C in a conventional oven, set your air fryer to 160 C and check for doneness a few minutes early. This prevents drying out while maintaining that golden crunch.</p>  

<h3>Common Dishes Cooked at 179 C in a Fan Oven</h3>  
<p>Popular recipes using 179 C fan settings include Victoria sponge cakes, roasted root vegetables, and homemade granola. The lower temperature ensures gentle cooking without burning edges. For frozen foods like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/frozen-foods>fish fingers or pizza</a>, 179 C (160 C fan) gives a crisp exterior while thawing the center evenly.</p>  

<h2>How to Adjust Cooking Times</h2>  
<p>When converting 179 C to a fan oven, reduce cooking time by 10–15% to account for the faster air circulation. For example, a 30-minute bake at 179 C in a conventional oven may take just 25 minutes in a fan-assisted one. Always use visual cues, like golden browning, to confirm doneness. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe hub</a> includes adjusted timings for fan ovens and air fryers.</p>  

<p>Air fryers excel at high-heat cooking, but 179 C (160 C fan) is perfect for dehydrating fruits or proofing dough. The controlled environment prevents hotspots, making it versatile beyond frying. For cleaning tips after low-temperature cooking, see our guide on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>maintaining your appliance</a>.</p>  

<h3>Temperature Accuracy Tips</h3>  
<p>Not all ovens or air fryers calibrate perfectly, so verify 179 C with an independent thermometer. Preheat for at least 10 minutes, and avoid overcrowding the basket to maintain airflow. For convection ovens, use the "Bake" mode rather than "Roast" to better replicate 179 C fan settings.</p>

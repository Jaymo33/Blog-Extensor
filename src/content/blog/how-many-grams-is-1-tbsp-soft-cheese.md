<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers cook food quickly and evenly, but they rely on precise ingredient ratios for the best results. Using too much or too little soft cheese can affect texture and flavour. For example, adding 15 grams (1 tbsp) of soft cheese to a sauce ensures it’s creamy without being overly rich. If you’re prepping meals in advance, accurate measurements also help with portion control. Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> for dishes that make the most of these measurements.</p>  

<h3>Types of soft cheese and their weights</h3>  
<p>Not all soft cheeses weigh the same per tablespoon. Cream cheese, ricotta, and mascarpone have slight variations due to moisture content. For instance, 1 tbsp of cream cheese is about 15 grams, while ricotta might be closer to 14 grams. Always check the packaging or use a kitchen scale for the most accurate conversion.

<h2>How to measure soft cheese without a scale</h2>  
<p>If you don’t have a scale, use a standard UK tablespoon (15ml) and level it off for an approximate 15-gram measure. Avoid packing the cheese down, as this can lead to over-measuring. For sticky cheeses like cream cheese, lightly greasing the spoon helps it slide off easily. Need more measurement hacks?

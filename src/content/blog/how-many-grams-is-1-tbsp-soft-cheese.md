<p>1 tablespoon (tbsp) of soft cheese weighs approximately 15 grams. This measurement is handy for air fryer recipes where precision matters, ensuring your dishes turn out just right. Whether you’re making creamy dips, stuffed mushrooms, or cheesy sauces, knowing the exact weight helps avoid over or under-seasoning. For more air fryer conversions, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers cook food quickly and evenly, but they rely on precise ingredient ratios for the best results. Using too much or too little soft cheese can affect texture and flavour. For example, adding 15 grams (1 tbsp) of soft cheese to a sauce ensures it’s creamy without being overly rich. If you’re prepping meals in advance, accurate measurements also help with portion control. Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> for dishes that make the most of these measurements.</p>  

<h3>Types of soft cheese and their weights</h3>  
<p>Not all soft cheeses weigh the same per tablespoon. Cream cheese, ricotta, and mascarpone have slight variations due to moisture content. For instance, 1 tbsp of cream cheese is about 15 grams, while ricotta might be closer to 14 grams. Always check the packaging or use a kitchen scale for the most accurate conversion. If you’re cooking with frozen ingredients, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/frozen-foods>frozen foods section</a> has handy tips.</p>  

<h2>How to measure soft cheese without a scale</h2>  
<p>If you don’t have a scale, use a standard UK tablespoon (15ml) and level it off for an approximate 15-gram measure. Avoid packing the cheese down, as this can lead to over-measuring. For sticky cheeses like cream cheese, lightly greasing the spoon helps it slide off easily. Need more measurement hacks? Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning guide</a> also includes tips for keeping your tools in top shape.</p>  

<h3>Common recipes using 1 tbsp of soft cheese</h3>  
<p>Many air fryer recipes call for small amounts of soft cheese. A tablespoon (15g) is perfect for stuffing chicken breasts, mixing into mashed potatoes, or creating a quick dip. For dessert lovers, it’s ideal for cheesecake fillings or frosting. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert recipes</a> for sweet inspiration. Remember, precise measurements ensure consistent results every time.</p>

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of almond milk can affect texture, moisture, and overall taste. Air fryers cook food quickly, so even small measurement errors can lead to dry or overly soggy results. For example, if a recipe calls for 1.75 cups of almond milk (14 oz), adding too much could make your dish watery. Too little might leave it dry. Always measure liquids carefully for the best outcome.</p>

<p>25 grams of olive oil equals approximately 0.88 ounces. This conversion is essential for air fryer cooking, where precise measurements can make all the difference in texture and flavour. Whether you’re drizzling oil over chips or coating chicken wings, knowing how to convert grams to ounces ensures your dish turns out perfectly every time. For more air fryer measurement tips, visit <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>our conversion chart</a>.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of olive oil in your air fryer ensures crispy, golden results without excess grease. Too little oil, and your food might dry out; too much, and it can become soggy. Converting 25g of olive oil to ounces (0.88 oz) helps maintain this balance. Many air fryer recipes, like those for roasted vegetables or crispy tofu, rely on precise oil measurements for the best outcome. Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a> for dishes that use olive oil perfectly.</p>  

<p>Olive oil is a staple in Mediterranean-inspired air fryer dishes, from garlic prawns to herb-roasted potatoes. Measuring 25g (or 0.88 oz) ensures you get the right richness without overpowering other flavours. If you’re new to air frying, check out our guide on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>keeping your air fryer spotless</a> after oily recipes.</p>  

<h3>How to measure 25g of olive oil without scales</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a kitchen scale, you can use volume measurements. Roughly, 25g of olive oil equals 1.8 tablespoons or 5.4 teaspoons. However, weighing is more accurate, especially for air fryer recipes where consistency is key. For foolproof measurements, invest in a digital scale—it’s a game-changer for dishes like crispy kale or honey-glazed carrots.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for 25g of olive oil in air fryer recipes</h2>  
<p>This amount is perfect for coating a batch of sweet potato fries or marinating chicken thighs before air frying. It’s also ideal for recipes like lemon-herb salmon or garlic mushrooms, where 25g (0.88 oz) of olive oil delivers just enough moisture and crispiness. Discover more <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable-based air fryer recipes</a> that use this measurement.</p>  

<p>For baking in the air fryer, 25g of olive oil can replace butter in cakes or cookies, offering a lighter texture. Try it in olive oil orange cake or rosemary focaccia—both turn out beautifully with this precise amount. Remember, accurate conversions like 25g to ounces (0.88 oz) ensure your bakes rise evenly and taste divine.</p>  

<h3>Converting other oil amounts for air fryer cooking</h3>  
<p>If your recipe calls for 50g of oil, that’s roughly 1.76 ounces—simply double the 25g measurement. For smaller amounts, 10g equals about 0.35 ounces. Keeping these conversions handy simplifies adapting recipes for your air fryer.

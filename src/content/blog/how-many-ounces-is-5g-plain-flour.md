<p>5g of plain flour equals approximately 0.18 ounces. This conversion is essential for precise baking, especially when using an air fryer where measurements can make or break a recipe. Whether you're making cookies, cakes, or bread, getting the flour quantity right ensures consistent texture and taste. For more air fryer conversions, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Flour Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Baking is a science, and even small deviations in flour weight can affect your air fryer results. Too much flour can make cakes dense, while too little can lead to soggy textures. Measuring 5g of plain flour correctly (0.18 ounces) ensures your recipes turn out as intended. If you're new to air fryer baking, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> for foolproof ideas.</p>  

<p>Digital kitchen scales are the most reliable way to measure 5g of plain flour. If you don’t have one, spooning flour lightly into a measuring cup and levelling it off can work in a pinch. However, for air fryer recipes, precision is key—especially when dealing with small quantities like 5g (0.18 ounces).</p>  

<h3>Converting 5g of Plain Flour to Ounces</h3>  
<p>The conversion from grams to ounces is straightforward: 1 gram equals 0.035 ounces. Therefore, 5g of plain flour is 0.18 ounces. This measurement is particularly useful for UK bakers who follow recipes using metric or imperial units. For more baking tips, browse our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>cake recipes</a>.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for 5g of Plain Flour</h2>  
<p>While 5g of plain flour might seem like a small amount, it’s often used in recipes for coatings, thickeners, or dusting. For example, a light dusting of flour prevents dough from sticking when making air fryer cookies. You can also mix 5g of plain flour with spices for a crispy coating on chicken or fish. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipes</a> for inspiration.</p>  

<p>Another use for 5g of plain flour is in sauces or gravies. Adding a small amount thickens liquids without clumping, perfect for air fryer dishes like creamy mushrooms. If you're working with frozen foods, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/frozen-foods>frozen food recipes</a> offer great ideas for quick meals.</p>  

<h3>Tips for Measuring Small Quantities</h3>  
<p>When measuring 5g of plain flour (0.18 ounces), use a digital scale for accuracy. If you’re using measuring spoons, note that 1 teaspoon of plain flour weighs roughly 2.5g, so 5g would be about 2 teaspoons. Always fluff the flour before measuring to avoid compacting it, which can lead to excess.</p>  

<h2>Cleaning Your Air Fryer After Baking</h2>  
<p>Flour can leave residue in your air fryer basket, so it’s important to clean it properly. After cooking, let the appliance cool, then wipe it down with a damp cloth. For stubborn flour buildup, use our recommended <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner</a> to maintain hygiene and performance.</p>  

<p>Regular cleaning ensures your air fryer stays in top condition, especially after baking with ingredients like plain flour. A well-maintained appliance not only lasts longer but also cooks more evenly, giving you perfect results every time.</p>

<p>30 grams of rapeseed oil equals approximately 1.06 ounces. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements can make all the difference. Whether you're frying, roasting, or baking, knowing how to convert 30g of rapeseed oil to ounces ensures your dishes turn out perfectly every time.</p>

<h2>Why converting 30g rapeseed oil to ounces matters</h2>
<p>Accurate measurements are crucial in cooking, especially when using an air fryer. Too much or too little oil can affect texture, crispiness, and even cooking times. Rapeseed oil is a popular choice for air frying due to its high smoke point and neutral flavour. Converting 30g of rapeseed oil to ounces (about 1.06 oz) helps you follow recipes precisely, whether they're from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>our recipe collection</a> or elsewhere.</p>

<p>Many UK recipes use grams, while some air fryer manuals might reference ounces. This conversion becomes particularly important when scaling recipes up or down. For example, if you're adapting a <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipe</a> that calls for 30g of rapeseed oil, knowing it's roughly 1.06 ounces helps maintain the right balance of moisture and crispiness.</p>

<h2>How to measure 30g rapeseed oil in ounces</h2>
<p>The simplest way to measure 30g of rapeseed oil in ounces is to use digital kitchen scales that switch between metric and imperial units. If your scales only show grams, remember that 30g equals about 1.06 ounces. For those without scales, two tablespoons of rapeseed oil is roughly equivalent to 30g or 1.06 ounces.</p>

<h3>Conversion methods for 30g rapeseed oil</h3>
<p>There are several ways to convert 30 grams of rapeseed oil to ounces. The mathematical conversion factor is 1 gram = 0.035274 ounces, so 30g Ã— 0.035274 = 1.05822 ounces (rounded to 1.06 oz).

The oil helps create that desirable golden crispiness while preventing food from drying out during the high-heat air frying process.</p>

<p>Remember that different foods absorb oil differently. For example, 30g of rapeseed oil might coat two medium potatoes perfectly, while the same amount could be too much for delicate fish fillets. Always consider what you're cooking when measuring out your 30g (1.06 oz) of rapeseed oil for air frying.</p>

<h3>Tips for measuring oil in your air fryer</h3>

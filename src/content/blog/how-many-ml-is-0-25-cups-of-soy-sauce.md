<p>0.25 cups of soy sauce equals 59 ml, making it easy to measure for your air fryer recipes. Whether you're marinating chicken, seasoning tofu, or whipping up a stir-fry, precise measurements ensure the best results.

<h2>Why Accurate Soy Sauce Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of soy sauce can make or break your dish. Too little, and your meal lacks depth; too much, and it becomes overly salty.

<h3>Converting Cups to ml for Soy Sauce</h3>

<h2>Common Uses for 0.25 Cups of Soy Sauce</h2>

<h3>Tips for Measuring Soy Sauce</h3>

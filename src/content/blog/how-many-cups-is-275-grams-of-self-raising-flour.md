<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter</h2>
<p>Baking is a science, and even small deviations in measurements can affect the outcome. Self-raising flour, which contains baking powder, requires precise measurements to ensure your baked goods rise properly. Too much or too little flour can lead to dense or crumbly results. This is especially important in air fryer baking, where the cooking environment differs from a conventional oven. For foolproof recipes, always measure your ingredients carefully.</p>

From cakes to cookies, we’ve got you covered with tried-and-tested measurements. Remember, 275 grams of self-raising flour is roughly 2.2 cups in the UK, but always double-check if your recipe specifies a different standard.</p>

<h3>UK vs. US Cup Measurements</h3>
<p>The difference between UK and US cup measurements can be confusing. In the UK, a standard cup holds 250ml, while in the US, it’s 240ml. This means 275 grams of self-raising flour converts to 2.2 UK cups or 2.3 US cups. Always check where your recipe originates to avoid mishaps.

<h2>How to Measure Self-Raising Flour Correctly</h2>
<p>The most accurate way to measure 275 grams of self-raising flour is by using a kitchen scale. However, if you don’t have one, spoon the flour into your measuring cup and level it off with a knife. Avoid scooping directly from the bag, as this can compact the flour and lead to excess. For air fryer baking, precision is key to achieving the perfect texture and rise.</p>

Another pitfall is overpacking the flour, which can throw off the balance of your recipe. For best results, stick to the recommended method of spooning and leveling.</p>

<p>3 tablespoons (tbsp) of gelatin powder equals approximately 21 grams. This conversion is essential for precise cooking, especially when using an air fryer for desserts like panna cotta or jelly-based treats. Accurate measurements ensure your recipes turn out perfectly every time.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate gelatin measurements matter</h2>  
<p>Gelatin is a key ingredient in many air fryer desserts, and even small measurement errors can affect texture. Too much gelatin makes desserts rubbery, while too little results in a runny consistency. Using grams instead of tablespoons eliminates guesswork, ensuring professional results every time.</p>  
<p>For air fryer recipes, precision is crucial because cooking times and temperatures are tightly controlled. If you're making a no-bake cheesecake or a jelly dessert in your air fryer, getting the gelatin right makes all the difference. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer dessert recipes</a> for inspiration.</p>  

<h3>How to measure gelatin powder correctly</h3>  
<p>Always use a kitchen scale for the most accurate results. Scoop the gelatin powder lightly into the tablespoon without packing it down, then level it off with a knife. For 3 tbsp, you should see around 21 grams on your scale. This method works for all gelatin-based recipes, whether you're using your air fryer or traditional oven.</p>  

<h2>Converting other gelatin measurements</h2>  
<p>If your recipe calls for different amounts, here's a quick reference: 1 tbsp gelatin powder = 7 grams, 2 tbsp = 14 grams, and 4 tbsp = 28 grams. These conversions are based on standard UK tablespoon measurements. For more conversion help, visit our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>  
<p>Remember that gelatin powder brands can vary slightly in density. If precision is critical, like when making delicate mousses in your air fryer, always weigh your ingredients. This ensures consistency across different brands and batches.</p>  

<h3>Common uses for gelatin in air fryer cooking</h3>  
<p>Gelatin isn't just for traditional desserts - it's great in air fryer recipes too! Use it to set fruit jellies, stabilise mousses, or even create glossy glazes for air-fried pastries. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert category</a> features several gelatin-based recipes perfect for your air fryer.</p>  

<h2>Tips for working with gelatin powder</h2>  
<p>Always bloom gelatin in cold water before using it in recipes. This means sprinkling the powder over cold liquid and letting it absorb for 5-10 minutes. When using your air fryer, remember that gelatin sets at room temperature, so allow adequate cooling time after cooking.</p>  
<p>Store gelatin powder in an airtight container away from moisture. If you're cleaning your air fryer after making gelatin desserts, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning guide</a> has helpful tips. Proper storage ensures your gelatin stays fresh for future recipes.</p>  

<h3>Adjusting recipes for different gelatin types</h3>  
<p>If you're using sheet gelatin instead of powder, the conversion differs. One tablespoon (7g) of powder equals about 3 sheets of gelatin. Always check your recipe requirements, especially when adapting traditional recipes for air fryer use.</p>

<p>560 ml of almond milk equals approximately 2.37 cups. Whether you're whipping up a dairy-free cake or a creamy sauce in your air fryer, knowing this conversion ensures your recipes turn out perfectly every time. Almond milk is a popular alternative for those avoiding dairy, and precise measurements are key to nailing textures and flavours.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of almond milk can make or break your air fryer recipes. Too much liquid might lead to soggy results, while too little could dry out your dish. For example, if you're making a vegan batter for <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer onion rings</a>, 560 ml of almond milk (2.37 cups) ensures the perfect consistency. Always measure liquids carefully to avoid kitchen mishaps.</p>  

<p>Many air fryer recipes, like dairy-free pancakes or custards, rely on almond milk for moisture. A <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>handy conversion chart</a> can save time, but memorising common measurements like 560 ml to cups simplifies the process. Precision is especially crucial for baking, where ratios directly impact rise and texture.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure 560 ml of Almond Milk Without a Scale</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a measuring jug, use standard cups for accuracy. One UK metric cup holds 250 ml, so 560 ml is just under 2 and 1/3 cups. For US cups (240 ml), it’s roughly 2.33 cups. Stir the almond milk before measuring, as separation can affect volume. For recipes like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>air fryer desserts</a>, consistency matters—so avoid eyeballing!</p>  

<h2>Common Recipes Using 560 ml of Almond Milk</h2>  
<p>This quantity works beautifully for larger batches. Try it in vegan mac and cheese or a dairy-free bread pudding for the air fryer. Almond milk’s mild flavour won’t overpower spices, making it ideal for savoury dishes like curries too. Check out <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> for inspiration—our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>air fryer cake recipes</a> often use this measurement.</p>  

<p>For a quick breakfast, blend 560 ml of almond milk into overnight oats or chia puddings before air-frying. It’s also perfect for creamy soups—just adjust thickness with a bit of cornflour. Remember, store-bought almond milk varies in viscosity, so homemade (using our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning tips</a> to prep nuts) might need slight tweaks.</p>  

<h3>Converting Other Almond Milk Quantities</h3>  
<p>Need 280 ml? That’s 1.18 cups. For 1 litre (1000 ml), it’s 4.23 cups. Bookmark these for scaling recipes up or down. If a recipe calls for 560 ml of almond milk in cups (2.37), but you only have imperial cups, note that 1 UK cup = 1.2 US cups. Always double-check labels—some brands fortify almond milk, slightly altering density.</p>

Whether you're making chicken wings or baking a cake, this conversion ensures consistent results every time.</p>

<h3>Adjusting Cooking Times at Gas Mark 4</h3>
<p>While 360°F translates to Gas Mark 4, air fryers typically cook faster than conventional ovens. A recipe suggesting 25 minutes in a Gas Mark 4 oven might only need 15-18 minutes in an air fryer.

<h2>Temperature Accuracy in Air Fryers</h2>
<p>Not all air fryers maintain exact temperatures, so it's wise to occasionally verify your appliance's accuracy. If your air fryer runs hot, you might need to set it slightly below 360°F to achieve true Gas Mark 4 results. Conversely, if it runs cool, a higher setting might be necessary. Regular cleaning, as per our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning guide</a>, helps maintain consistent temperature performance.</p>

<p>When converting 360°F to Gas Mark for baking, consider that air fryers distribute heat differently than ovens.

Experimentation will help you master your specific model's characteristics at this temperature.</p>

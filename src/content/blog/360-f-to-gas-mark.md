<h2>360 F to Gas Mark Conversion Explained</h2>
<p>360°F converts to Gas Mark 4 in UK ovens and air fryers. This is a common temperature for baking cookies, roasting vegetables, or cooking poultry in an air fryer. The Gas Mark system is widely used in British recipes, making this conversion essential for home cooks. If you're using an air fryer, you'll find many recipes at <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> that specify temperatures in both Fahrenheit and Gas Mark. Understanding this conversion helps when adapting traditional oven recipes for your air fryer.</p>

<p>Gas Mark 4 (360°F) falls in the moderate temperature range, ideal for foods that need gentle, even cooking. When using your air fryer at this temperature, you might need to adjust cooking times slightly compared to conventional ovens. For example, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> shows how to modify times for different foods. This temperature works particularly well for baking goods like scones or roasting root vegetables to perfection.</p>

<h3>Why 360 F to Gas Mark Matters for Air Fryers</h3>
<p>Modern air fryers often display temperatures in Fahrenheit or Celsius, but many British recipes still use Gas Mark. Knowing that 360°F equals Gas Mark 4 helps bridge this gap. This temperature is perfect for achieving crispy exteriors while keeping interiors moist - a hallmark of good air frying. Whether you're making chicken wings or baking a cake, this conversion ensures consistent results every time.</p>

<h2>Practical Applications of 360 F (Gas Mark 4)</h2>
<p>At 360°F (Gas Mark 4), your air fryer becomes versatile for various cooking methods. This temperature excels at roasting vegetables like carrots and parsnips, giving them caramelised edges without burning. It's also ideal for reheating leftovers, as shown in our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a>, where we recommend this setting for bringing back crispness to fried foods. The moderate heat allows thorough cooking without excessive browning.</p>

<p>For baking enthusiasts, 360°F (Gas Mark 4) produces excellent results with cookies and muffins. The air fryer's rapid circulation creates even browning at this temperature. When cooking proteins like chicken breasts or fish fillets at Gas Mark 4, you'll get juicy results with a pleasing texture. Check our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipe category</a> for specific timing recommendations at this temperature setting.</p>

<h3>Adjusting Cooking Times at Gas Mark 4</h3>
<p>While 360°F translates to Gas Mark 4, air fryers typically cook faster than conventional ovens. A recipe suggesting 25 minutes in a Gas Mark 4 oven might only need 15-18 minutes in an air fryer. Always check food a few minutes before the suggested time and use a meat thermometer for proteins. This precaution ensures perfectly cooked meals without overdoing them.</p>

<h2>Temperature Accuracy in Air Fryers</h2>
<p>Not all air fryers maintain exact temperatures, so it's wise to occasionally verify your appliance's accuracy. If your air fryer runs hot, you might need to set it slightly below 360°F to achieve true Gas Mark 4 results. Conversely, if it runs cool, a higher setting might be necessary. Regular cleaning, as per our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning guide</a>, helps maintain consistent temperature performance.</p>

<p>When converting 360°F to Gas Mark for baking, consider that air fryers distribute heat differently than ovens. Cakes and breads might need temperature adjustments or position changes in the basket. For delicate baked goods at Gas Mark 4, placing a foil tent over them can prevent excessive browning while ensuring thorough cooking. Experimentation will help you master your specific model's characteristics at this temperature.</p>

<h3>Common Foods Cooked at 360 F (Gas Mark 4)</h3>
<p>Many air fryer staples work beautifully at 360°F (Gas Mark 4). Frozen foods like chicken nuggets or fish fingers crisp up perfectly at this temperature. Fresh vegetables tossed with oil transform into delicious roasted sides. Even homemade potato wedges achieve that ideal balance of soft inside and crispy outside.

<p>1.5 tablespoons of garlic paste equals approximately 22.5 grams. This conversion is essential for air fryer cooking, where precise measurements can make or break a recipe. Whether you're making marinades, sauces, or rubs, knowing this conversion ensures consistent results every time. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we understand how crucial accurate measurements are for perfect air frying.</p>

<h2>Why garlic paste measurements matter in air frying</h2>
<p>Garlic paste brings intense flavour to air fryer dishes, but too much or too little can throw off your recipe. Unlike whole garlic cloves, paste has a concentrated consistency that requires careful measuring. Many air fryer recipes at <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>our recipe collection</a> specify garlic paste by weight for consistency. This is particularly important when preparing marinades for chicken or vegetables where flavour balance is key.</p>
<p>Using grams rather than tablespoons eliminates measurement inconsistencies caused by how the paste is packed into the spoon. Some cooks scoop while others level off - grams remove this variability. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> includes this and other common measurement conversions to simplify your cooking process.</p>

<h3>How we calculated 1.5 tbsp to grams</h3>
<p>The standard conversion for garlic paste is 1 tablespoon = 15 grams. Therefore, 1.5 tablespoons equals 22.5 grams. We verified this through multiple tests using UK tablespoon measurements and digital kitchen scales. This ratio holds true whether you're using homemade or shop-bought garlic paste in your air fryer recipes.</p>

<h2>Practical uses for 1.5 tbsp garlic paste</h2>
<p>22.5 grams of garlic paste is the perfect amount for many air fryer dishes. It's ideal for marinating 2-3 chicken breasts or a medium batch of roasted vegetables. When making garlic bread in the air fryer, this quantity provides robust flavour without overpowering the other ingredients. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipe category</a> for dishes that use this exact measurement.</p>
<p>For those who meal prep, knowing this conversion helps when scaling up recipes. If a dish calls for 1.5 tbsp per serving and you're making four portions, you'll need 90 grams of garlic paste. Precise measurements like this ensure your weekly meal prep has consistent flavour throughout.</p>

<h3>Measuring alternatives if you don't have scales</h3>
<p>If you don't have digital scales, you can approximate 22.5 grams of garlic paste using standard spoons. It's exactly 1 tablespoon plus half another tablespoon. For even more precision, use a measuring spoon set with Â½ tablespoon measures. After cooking, remember to clean your air fryer properly - our guide on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaning</a> makes maintenance simple.</p>

<h2>Garlic paste vs fresh garlic in air fryers</h2>
<p>While 1.5 tbsp garlic paste equals 22.5 grams, the equivalent in fresh garlic would be about 3 medium cloves. However, paste and fresh garlic behave differently in air fryers. Paste distributes flavour more evenly and doesn't risk burning like minced fresh garlic can. This makes it particularly good for quick-cooking items like shrimp or vegetables at <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>our vegetable recipes section</a>.</p>
<p>The concentrated nature of garlic paste means you get more consistent results in the air fryer's rapid cooking environment. Fresh garlic can vary in potency depending on age and variety, while paste offers reliable flavour intensity. This is why many professional recipes specify paste by weight for foolproof results.</p>

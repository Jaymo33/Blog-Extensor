<p>2 tablespoons (tbsp) of marmalade weigh approximately 40 grams in the UK. This measurement is essential for air fryer recipes where precision matters. Whether you’re making glazes, sauces, or desserts, knowing the exact weight ensures consistent results every time.</p>

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>
<p>Air fryers rely on precise ingredient ratios to achieve the perfect texture and flavour. Too much or too little marmalade can affect the outcome of your dish. For example, a sticky glaze might become too runny or overly thick if the measurement is off. That’s why converting 2 tbsp of marmalade to grams is so useful.</p>
<p>At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we emphasise the importance of accurate conversions. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> makes it easy to switch between volume and weight measurements. This ensures your air fryer recipes, from breakfast treats to desserts, turn out just right.</p>

<h2>How to measure 2 tbsp of marmalade accurately</h2>
<p>Using a kitchen scale is the most reliable way to measure 2 tbsp of marmalade in grams. Simply spoon the marmalade into a tablespoon measure, level it off, and weigh it. If you don’t have a scale, remember that 2 tbsp of marmalade equals roughly 40 grams in the UK.</p>
<p>For sticky ingredients like marmalade, lightly greasing the spoon can help it slide off easily. This trick is especially handy when preparing air fryer recipes like glazed salmon or sticky chicken wings.

<h2>Converting other marmalade measurements</h2>

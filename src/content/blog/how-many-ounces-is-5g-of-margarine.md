<p>5g of margarine equals approximately 0.18 ounces. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements can make or break your dish. Whether you’re whipping up crispy potatoes or a buttery cake, knowing how to convert grams to ounces ensures consistency. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we help you nail every measurement for perfect results.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air frying</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of margarine can affect texture, browning, and overall taste. Too little, and your food might dry out; too much, and it could become greasy. Air fryers circulate hot air, so fats like margarine need to be measured precisely. For example, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipes</a> often call for small amounts of margarine to achieve that golden crispiness. A digital kitchen scale is your best friend here, but if you don’t have one, conversions like 5g to ounces come in handy.</p>  

<h3>How to measure 5g of margarine without a scale</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a scale, you can use measuring spoons or visual cues. A teaspoon of margarine is roughly 5g, but this can vary slightly depending on density. For sticky margarine, lightly grease the spoon first for easier release.

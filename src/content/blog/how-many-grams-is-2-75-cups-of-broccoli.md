<h3>How to Measure Broccoli for Air Fryer Recipes</h3>

<h2>Converting Cups to Grams for Different Broccoli Cuts</h2>  
<p>The way you chop broccoli affects its cup-to-gram ratio. Florets weigh slightly less than stems when measured by volume, so 2.75 cups of chopped florets may be closer to 200 grams. If you're using a mix of stems and florets, aim for the 220-gram benchmark. For recipes like air-fried broccoli cheese bites, consistency in size ensures even cooking.</p>  

<p>If you're working with frozen broccoli, note that 2.75 cups will weigh more due to ice content—around 250 grams. Thaw and drain it well before air frying to avoid excess moisture. Frozen broccoli works well in dishes like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/frozen-foods>frozen food recipes</a>, but fresh is ideal for crispier results.</p>

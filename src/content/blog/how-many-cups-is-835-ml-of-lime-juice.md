<p>835 ml of lime juice is approximately 3.5 cups in the UK and 3.52 cups in the US. This conversion is essential for recipes requiring precise measurements, especially when using an air fryer. Whether you're making marinades, dressings, or desserts, knowing how to convert ml to cups ensures your dish turns out perfectly. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we provide handy conversions to simplify your cooking process.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Lime Juice Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of lime juice can make or break a recipe. Too little, and your dish might lack tanginess; too much, and it could become overpowering. Air fryer recipes, like citrus-glazed chicken or lime-infused desserts, rely on precise measurements for balanced flavours. Converting 835 ml of lime juice to cups ensures consistency, whether you're following a UK or US recipe. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more handy tips.</p>  

<p>Lime juice is also a key ingredient in marinades, where acidity helps tenderise meat. For example, 835 ml of lime juice (3.5 cups) is perfect for marinating a large batch of chicken or shrimp before air frying. Visit our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipe category</a> for inspiration on using lime juice in your air fryer dishes.</p>  

<h3>UK vs. US Cup Measurements</h3>  
<p>It's important to note that UK and US cup measurements differ slightly. In the UK, 1 cup equals 284 ml, while in the US, it's 240 ml. This means 835 ml of lime juice converts to 3.5 UK cups or 3.52 US cups. For air fryer recipes, this small difference usually won't affect the outcome, but it's good to know for precision baking.</p>  

<h2>How to Measure 835 ml of Lime Juice Without a Measuring Cup</h2>  
<p>If you don't have a measuring cup, you can still measure 835 ml of lime juice using household items. A standard UK mug holds about 300 ml, so roughly 2.8 mugs would equal 835 ml. Alternatively, use a kitchen scale: 835 ml of lime juice weighs approximately 835 grams, as lime juice has a similar density to water. For more measurement hacks, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a>.</p>  

<p>Another method is to use tablespoons. Since 1 UK tablespoon holds 15 ml, 835 ml of lime juice equals about 55.6 tablespoons. This method is handy for smaller adjustments in recipes, like adding a splash of lime to air-fried fish or vegetables.

<h3>Using 835 ml of Lime Juice in Air Fryer Recipes</h3>  
<p>835 ml of lime juice (3.5 cups) is ideal for batch cooking or meal prep. Try using it in a citrus marinade for air-fried chicken wings or a zesty glaze for salmon. The acidity of lime juice also helps crisp up foods in the air fryer, giving them a delicious tang.

<p>500 grams of chopped onion is approximately 17.64 ounces. This conversion is essential for anyone using an air fryer, as precise measurements can make or break a recipe. Whether you're whipping up a stir-fry, caramelised onions, or a hearty casserole, knowing the exact weight ensures consistent results every time.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on even cooking, and the right amount of ingredients ensures everything cooks uniformly. Too much onion can lead to steaming instead of crisping, while too little might leave your dish lacking flavour. For perfect results, always measure your ingredients carefully. If you're new to air frying, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for other common ingredient conversions.</p>  

<p>Chopped onions are a staple in many dishes, from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable-based recipes</a> to meaty classics. Their moisture content can vary, so weighing them ensures accuracy. A digital kitchen scale is your best friend here—simply tare your bowl, add the onions, and note the weight in grams or ounces.</p>  

<h3>How to Convert Grams to Ounces for Onions</h3>  
<p>The general rule is that 1 gram equals 0.035 ounces. For 500 grams of chopped onion, multiply 500 by 0.035 to get 17.64 ounces. This conversion works for most ingredients, but keep in mind that density can vary. For example, finely diced onions might pack more tightly than roughly chopped ones, slightly affecting volume.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for 500g of Chopped Onion in Air Fryer Recipes</h2>  
<p>500 grams of chopped onion is enough for multiple servings of dishes like air-fried onion rings, fajitas, or a savoury tart. If you're meal prepping, this quantity is ideal for batch cooking. Store any unused onions in an airtight container—they’ll keep for up to three days in the fridge. For inspiration, browse our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> collection.</p>  

<p>Onions add depth to dishes, whether caramelised, roasted, or used raw. In an air fryer, they crisp up beautifully with minimal oil. Try tossing them with a bit of olive oil and salt for a quick side dish. If you're cooking for a crowd, 500 grams of chopped onion will yield about 4–5 servings, depending on the recipe.</p>  

<h3>Tips for Measuring Chopped Onions Without a Scale</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a scale, 500 grams of chopped onion is roughly 4–5 medium-sized onions, depending on their size. A standard measuring cup holds about 150 grams of loosely packed chopped onion, so 500 grams would fill just over 3 cups. For best results, though, weighing is always more accurate.</p>  

<h2>Storing and Prepping Chopped Onions for Air Fryer Meals</h2>  
<p>Chopped onions can be prepped ahead to save time. Store them in the fridge for short-term use or freeze them for longer storage. If freezing, spread the onions on a tray first to prevent clumping. Once frozen, transfer them to a bag—they’ll keep for up to 3 months. When ready to use, no need to thaw; just add them straight to your air fryer.</p>  

<p>To keep your air fryer in top condition after cooking onions, give it a quick clean with our recommended <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner</a>. Onions can leave behind strong odours, so a thorough wipe-down ensures your next meal tastes fresh. For more tips on maintaining your appliance, explore our guides.</p>  

<h3>Adjusting Recipes for Different Onion Quantities</h3>  
<p>If a recipe calls for 500 grams of chopped onion but you only have ounces, now you know it’s roughly 17.64 ounces. Conversely, if a recipe uses ounces and you prefer grams, multiply the ounces by 28.35 to get the gram equivalent. This flexibility is handy for adapting international recipes or scaling portions up or down.</p>

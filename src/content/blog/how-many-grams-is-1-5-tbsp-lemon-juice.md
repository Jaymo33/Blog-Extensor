<p>1.5 tablespoons (tbsp) of lemon juice equals approximately 22.5 grams (g). This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements can make or break a dish. Whether you’re marinating chicken or whipping up a tangy glaze, knowing the exact weight ensures consistency. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we focus on accuracy to help you achieve perfect results every time.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate lemon juice measurements matter</h2>  
<p>Lemon juice is a versatile ingredient in air fryer cooking, used in marinades, dressings, and even desserts. Too much can overpower a dish, while too little might leave it lacking flavour. For example, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>lemon-herb chicken recipe</a> relies on the perfect balance of acidity. Measuring by weight (grams) is more reliable than volume (tablespoons), especially when scaling recipes up or down.</p>  

<p>Air fryers circulate hot air rapidly, which means ingredients cook faster and more evenly. A slight variation in liquid measurements can affect texture and taste. If you’re preparing a <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken dish</a>, 22.5 grams of lemon juice will give you the right tang without drying out the meat. Always use a kitchen scale for the best results.</p>  

<h3>How to measure 1.5 tbsp lemon juice without scales</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a scale, use a standard UK tablespoon (15ml) and fill it 1.5 times for roughly 22.5 grams. Freshly squeezed lemon juice is ideal, but bottled works too—just check for additives.

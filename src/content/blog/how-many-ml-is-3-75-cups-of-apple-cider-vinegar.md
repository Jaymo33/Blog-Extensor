<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on precise ingredient ratios to achieve the perfect texture and taste.

For example, a marinade with 3.75 cups of apple cider vinegar in ml (887.21 ml) ensures even coating without overpowering the dish.

<p>Many air fryer enthusiasts struggle with conversions, especially when adapting recipes from cups to millilitres.

Whether you’re using a UK or US cup measurement, 3.75 cups of apple cider vinegar converts reliably to 887.21 ml. This precision helps avoid soggy or overly acidic results in your air-fried dishes.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure 3.75 Cups of Apple Cider Vinegar Correctly</h3>

<h3>Adjusting Recipes for UK vs. US Measurements</h3>  
<p>While 1 US cup equals 236.59 ml, UK cups measure 284.13 ml. However, most modern recipes standardise to US cups unless specified.

<p>For best results, pair apple cider vinegar with oils or sweeteners in marinades. A classic ratio is 3 parts oil to 1 part vinegar, so 887.21 ml of vinegar would pair with 2661.63 ml of oil.

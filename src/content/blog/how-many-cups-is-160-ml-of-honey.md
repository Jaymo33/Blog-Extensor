<p>160 ml of honey is approximately 0.68 cups in the US or 0.56 cups in the UK. This conversion is essential for accurate baking and cooking, especially when using an air fryer. Whether you're whipping up a glaze or sweetening a dessert, knowing how many cups is 160 ml of honey ensures perfect results every time.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Honey Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Honey is denser than water, so volume conversions aren't always straightforward. Using the wrong amount can throw off recipes, particularly in air fryer cooking where precision matters. For example, 160 ml of honey in cups differs slightly between US and UK measurements due to varying cup sizes. Always check which standard your recipe follows.</p>  
<p>If you're adapting a recipe from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, note that UK measurements are typically used. A handy <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a> can help avoid mistakes. Whether you're making glazes for salmon or sweetening cakes, getting the 160 ml honey to cups ratio right is key.</p>  

<h2>Converting 160 ml of Honey to Cups</h2>  
<p>In the US, 1 cup equals 240 ml, so 160 ml of honey is roughly 0.68 cups. In the UK, 1 cup is 284 ml, making 160 ml about 0.56 cups. This difference might seem small, but it can affect recipes like air fryer desserts or marinades. Always measure honey carefully for consistent results.</p>  
<p>For sticky ingredients like honey, use a liquid measuring cup or weigh it for precision. If you're working with <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert recipes</a>, even slight measurement errors can alter texture. A digital scale is ideal, but if using cups, spoon the honey in and level it off.</p>  

<h3>US vs. UK Cup Measurements</h3>  
<p>The US and UK use different cup sizes, which affects how 160 ml of honey converts. In US recipes, 160 ml is just over 2/3 cup, while in UK recipes, it's slightly more than 1/2 cup. This matters for air fryer baking, where exact ratios impact cooking times and textures.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for 160 ml of Honey</h2>  
<p>160 ml of honey is a versatile amount for many recipes. It's perfect for glazing chicken, sweetening oatmeal, or making salad dressings in your air fryer. If you're prepping <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/meal-prep>meal prep dishes</a>, this quantity balances sweetness without overpowering.</p>  
<p>For baking, 160 ml of honey adds moisture to cakes and cookies. When converting 160ml honey to cups, remember it substitutes roughly 3/4 cup sugar in recipes. Check <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> for honey-based recipes tailored to your air fryer model.</p>  

<h3>Tips for Measuring Honey</h3>  
<p>Honey's stickiness makes it tricky to measure. Lightly oil your measuring cup or spoon first to help it slide out cleanly. For 160 ml of honey, use a liquid measuring cup with clear ml markings for accuracy. This ensures your air fryer recipes turn out perfectly every time.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>

<h3>How to Measure 25g of Cottage Cheese Without a Scale</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a kitchen scale, you can estimate 25g of cottage cheese using tablespoons. One tablespoon of cottage cheese weighs roughly 15g, so 1.5 tablespoons will get you close to 25g. However, for baking or precise recipes, investing in a digital scale is worthwhile. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we recommend scales for consistent results.</p>

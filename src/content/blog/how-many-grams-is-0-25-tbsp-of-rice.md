<p>0.25 tbsp of rice weighs approximately 3.75 grams. This conversion is essential for precise cooking, especially when using an air fryer where ingredient ratios can impact texture and doneness. Whether you're scaling a recipe or measuring small portions, knowing the exact weight ensures consistent results.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate rice measurements matter in air frying</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on even heat distribution, so precise ingredient measurements help avoid undercooked or overcooked rice. Too much rice can lead to clumping, while too little may dry out. For perfect air-fried rice dishes, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> to simplify your cooking process.</p>  

<p>Rice varieties like basmati, jasmine, or short-grain have slightly different densities, but 0.25 tbsp generally converts to 3.75 grams. If you're preparing a <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable stir-fry</a>, this measurement ensures balanced flavours and textures.</p>  

<h3>How to measure 0.25 tbsp of rice without scales</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a kitchen scale, use a measuring spoon and lightly fill it without packing the rice. Level off the excess with a straight edge for accuracy.

<h2>Common uses for 0.25 tbsp of rice in air fryer recipes</h2>  
<p>Small quantities like 0.25 tbsp of rice are handy for seasoning blends, crispy toppings, or testing new recipes. Try sprinkling toasted rice over <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/salmon>air-fried salmon</a> for added crunch.</p>

<p>1 cup of Thai curry paste equals approximately 8 ounces. This measurement is essential for air fryer recipes, ensuring your dishes have the right balance of flavour. Whether you're making a spicy Thai curry or marinating meats, knowing this conversion helps you cook with precision. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we provide accurate measurements to make your cooking effortless. Keep reading for more tips on using Thai curry paste in your air fryer.</p>

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter</h2>  
<p>Using the correct amount of Thai curry paste ensures your dish isn’t too spicy or bland. A cup of Thai curry paste weighs around 8 ounces, but density can vary slightly. For air fryer recipes, precise measurements help avoid overpowering flavours. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for other common ingredient conversions. Accurate measurements also make it easier to scale recipes up or down.</p>  

<p>Thai curry paste is a concentrated ingredient, so even small variations can affect taste. If you’re new to air frying, start with slightly less paste and adjust to taste. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipes section</a> includes tested measurements for perfect results every time. Remember, 1 cup equals 8 ounces, but always taste as you go. This approach ensures your dishes are flavourful without being overwhelming.</p>  

<h3>How to measure Thai curry paste correctly</h3>  
<p>Use a liquid measuring cup for sticky ingredients like Thai curry paste. Lightly grease the cup to help the paste slide out easily. For smaller amounts, a kitchen scale is ideal—just set it to ounces for precision. If you don’t have a scale, spoon the paste into the cup and level it off. This method ensures you get the full 8 ounces per cup.</p>  

<h2>Using Thai curry paste in air fryer recipes</h2>  
<p>Thai curry paste adds depth to air-fried meats, vegetables, and even tofu. Marinate chicken or shrimp with 1 cup (8 ounces) of paste for bold flavours. For lighter dishes, dilute the paste with coconut milk or broth. Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipes</a> for inspiration. The air fryer’s high heat helps caramelise the paste, enhancing its aroma.</p>  

<p>Curry paste also works well as a glaze for roasted vegetables. Toss veggies with 1-2 tablespoons (0.5-1 ounce) of paste before air frying. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable recipes</a> for more ideas. Always clean your air fryer basket after using sticky ingredients—our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning guide</a> makes it easy. With 1 cup (8 ounces) of paste, you can create multiple flavourful meals.</p>  

<h3>Storing leftover Thai curry paste</h3>  
<p>Transfer unused paste to an airtight container and refrigerate. It stays fresh for up to a month, so you can use it in future recipes. Freeze small portions in ice cube trays for easy measuring. Each cube holds about 1 ounce, making it simple to defrost the exact amount needed. This method saves time and reduces waste.</p>

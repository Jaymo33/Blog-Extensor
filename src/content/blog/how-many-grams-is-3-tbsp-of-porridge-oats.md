<p>3 tablespoons of porridge oats weigh approximately 24 grams. This measurement is crucial for precise cooking, especially when using an air fryer for recipes like oat bars or breakfast bakes. Getting the right amount ensures your dishes turn out perfectly every time.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>When preparing air fryer recipes, consistency is key. Using the correct weight for 3 tbsp of porridge oats ensures your meals have the right texture and cook evenly. Too many oats can make dishes dry, while too few might leave them soggy.</p>  

<p>For example, if you're making <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer granola</a>, knowing that 3 tbsp of porridge oats equals 24 grams helps balance the ingredients. This precision is especially useful for <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/breakfast>breakfast recipes</a> where ratios matter.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure Porridge Oats Correctly</h3>  
<p>To convert 3 tbsp of porridge oats into grams, use a digital kitchen scale for accuracy. Spoon the oats lightly into the tablespoon without packing them down. Level off the excess with a knife for a precise measurement.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for 3 Tbsp of Porridge Oats</h2>  
<p>Three tablespoons of porridge oats (24g) are perfect for single-serving breakfasts. You can use them in <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>air fryer oatmeal cookies</a>, overnight oats, or as a crunchy topping for yogurt. The versatility of oats makes them a kitchen staple.</p>

<h3>Adjusting Recipes for Different Servings</h3>  
<p>Need to double or halve a recipe? Simply multiply or divide the 24-gram measurement accordingly. For larger batches, weigh out the oats in grams for consistency across servings.</p>  

<h2>Tips for Cooking with Porridge Oats</h2>  
<p>Porridge oats absorb liquid, so adjust wet ingredients if scaling recipes. In the air fryer, they crisp up beautifully—ideal for granola or crumble toppings. Always store oats in an airtight container to maintain freshness.</p>

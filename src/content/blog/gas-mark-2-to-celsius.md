<p>Gas Mark 2 converts to 150°C, a low to moderate oven temperature ideal for slow cooking and baking. This temperature is perfect for dishes that require gentle heat, such as custards, meringues, or slow-roasted vegetables. If you're using an air fryer, you'll find that many recipes originally designed for conventional ovens can be adapted to this setting. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we often recommend starting with a slightly lower temperature in your air fryer to account for its efficiency. Gas Mark 2 to Celsius is a common conversion, especially for those transitioning from traditional ovens to air fryers.</p>

<p>When converting Gas Mark 2 to Celsius for your air fryer, it's important to remember that air fryers cook faster than conventional ovens. This means you might need to reduce the cooking time by 10-20% to avoid overcooking.

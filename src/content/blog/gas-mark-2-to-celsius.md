<h2>What is Gas Mark 2 in Celsius?</h2>
<p>Gas Mark 2 converts to 150°C, a low to moderate oven temperature ideal for slow cooking and baking. This temperature is perfect for dishes that require gentle heat, such as custards, meringues, or slow-roasted vegetables. If you're using an air fryer, you'll find that many recipes originally designed for conventional ovens can be adapted to this setting. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we often recommend starting with a slightly lower temperature in your air fryer to account for its efficiency. Gas Mark 2 to Celsius is a common conversion, especially for those transitioning from traditional ovens to air fryers.</p>

<p>When converting Gas Mark 2 to Celsius for your air fryer, it's important to remember that air fryers cook faster than conventional ovens. This means you might need to reduce the cooking time by 10-20% to avoid overcooking. For example, a recipe that calls for 30 minutes at Gas Mark 2 in a regular oven might only need 24-27 minutes in an air fryer at 150°C. Always check your food a few minutes early to ensure perfect results. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> can help you make these adjustments effortlessly.</p>

<h3>Why Use Gas Mark 2 in an Air Fryer?</h3>
<p>Gas Mark 2 (150°C) is a versatile temperature for air fryers, suitable for delicate foods that need even, gentle heat. This setting is excellent for baking cookies, reheating leftovers, or cooking proteins like fish and chicken without drying them out. The air fryer's rapid air circulation ensures that heat is distributed evenly, which is particularly beneficial at lower temperatures like Gas Mark 2 to Celsius. Whether you're making a batch of <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cookies>cookies</a> or slow-roasting vegetables, this temperature delivers consistent results.</p>

<h2>Converting Gas Mark 2 to Celsius for Baking</h2>
<p>Baking at Gas Mark 2 (150°C) in an air fryer requires slight adjustments to traditional recipes. Since air fryers circulate hot air more efficiently, baked goods may cook faster or brown more evenly. For instance, a Victoria sponge cake that typically bakes at Gas Mark 2 for 25-30 minutes in an oven might only need 20-25 minutes in an air fryer. It's also a good idea to use parchment paper or a light greasing to prevent sticking. Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>cake recipes</a> tailored for air fryers to get started.</p>

<p>Another tip for baking at Gas Mark 2 to Celsius in an air fryer is to preheat the appliance. While some recipes skip this step, preheating ensures even cooking from the start. If your air fryer doesn't have a preheat function, simply run it at 150°C for 3-5 minutes before adding your food. This mimics the preheating process of a conventional oven and helps achieve better results.

<h3>Common Dishes Cooked at Gas Mark 2</h3>
<p>Many classic dishes are cooked at Gas Mark 2 (150°C), from slow-cooked meats to delicate desserts. In an air fryer, this temperature works well for dishes like cheesecakes, meringues, or even slow-roasted tomatoes. The key is to monitor the cooking process closely, as air fryers can vary in performance. For example, a <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert</a> like crème brûlée might need a water bath in the air fryer basket to prevent cracking. Experimentation and slight adjustments will help you master Gas Mark 2 to Celsius conversions in your air fryer.</p>

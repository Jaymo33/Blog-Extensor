<h3>Why convert 100g of almond milk to ounces?</h3>  
<p>Converting 100g of almond milk to ounces (3.53 oz) ensures consistency, especially in baking. Air fryers cook quickly, so exact measurements prevent dry or undercooked dishes. Almond milk’s density can vary by brand, making weight more reliable than volume. This conversion is also handy when scaling recipes up or down. For example, doubling a recipe requires 200g (7.05 oz) of almond milk.</p>  

<h2>How to measure 100g of almond milk accurately</h2>  
<p>Using a digital kitchen scale is the easiest way to measure 100g of almond milk. Place your measuring jug on the scale, tare it to zero, then pour until you hit 100g. If you don’t have a scale, 100g roughly equals 100ml, but this isn’t always precise due to density differences. For air fryer recipes, accuracy ensures even cooking and perfect texture.

<p>Another method is using conversion tables or apps, but weighing is best. Almond milk’s thickness can affect volume measurements, so 100ml might not always be 100g. For recipes like pancakes or custards, this small difference matters. If you’re experimenting with dairy-free <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>desserts</a>, precise measurements are key to success.</p>

<p>100g (3.53 oz) of almond milk works perfectly in air fryer batters, sauces, or marinades. It’s a staple in vegan baking, like dairy-free muffins or cakes.

<h2>Tips for substituting almond milk in recipes</h2>  
<p>When substituting almond milk for dairy, 100g (3.53 oz) replaces 100ml of regular milk. However, almond milk is thinner, so adjust thickeners like flour if needed.

<p>Almond milk’s mild flavour makes it versatile, but unsweetened varieties are best for savoury dishes. Sweetened versions add a hint of sugar, which can caramelise in the air fryer. If a recipe calls for 100g of almond milk, stick to the weight for consistency. For frothy coffees or desserts, opt for fortified almond milk with higher fat content.

<p>158°C in a fan oven equals approximately 175°C in a conventional oven. This conversion ensures your recipes cook evenly when switching between oven types. Understanding these differences is crucial for perfect results, especially when using an air fryer which often mimics fan oven behaviour.</p>

<h2>Why Fan Oven Temperatures Differ</h2>
<p>Fan ovens circulate hot air constantly, cooking food faster and more evenly than conventional ovens. This means you typically need to reduce temperatures by 20°C when converting from conventional to fan settings. The reverse applies when converting 158 fan oven to conventional oven - you'll need to increase the temperature.</p>
<p>This principle applies to all cooking methods, whether you're baking cakes or roasting meats. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we've found most air fryers work similarly to fan ovens, making these conversions particularly useful for air fryer users adapting conventional recipes.</p>

<h2>Practical Conversion Examples</h2>
<p>Let's break down some common conversions. 158°C fan oven translates to 175°C conventional, but what about other temperatures? Here's a quick reference:</p>
<ul>
<li>140°C fan = 160°C conventional</li>
<li>160°C fan = 180°C conventional</li>
<li>180°C fan = 200°C conventional</li>
</ul>
<p>These conversions become second nature with practice. For more detailed guidance, check our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> which includes both oven types.</p>

<h3>Adjusting Cooking Times</h3>
<p>When converting 158 fan oven to conventional oven settings, remember cooking times may need adjusting too. Conventional ovens generally require 10-15% longer cooking times than fan ovens at equivalent temperatures. Always check food 5-10 minutes before the recipe suggests.</p>

<h2>Air Fryer Considerations</h2>
<p>Most modern air fryers operate like compact fan ovens, making them excellent for recipes designed for 158°C fan settings. However, their smaller size means they cook even faster - typically reducing cooking times by 20% compared to conventional ovens.</p>
<p>When adapting conventional oven recipes for air fryers, we recommend starting with our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipe collection</a> as reference points. The intense air circulation means you might need to reduce both temperature and time for optimal results.</p>

<h3>Common Conversion Mistakes</h3>
<p>Many cooks forget that 158 fan oven to celsius conventional conversion isn't just about temperature. Humidity and air flow differ significantly between oven types. For baked goods especially, you might need to adjust liquid quantities slightly when converting recipes.</p>

<h2>Special Cases and Exceptions</h2>
<p>Some delicate recipes like soufflés or custards require special attention when converting 158 c fan oven to normal oven temperatures. The more consistent heat of fan ovens can be harder to replicate in conventional ovens, sometimes requiring temperature reductions rather than increases.</p>
<p>For meat dishes, we've found the standard conversion works well, though browning might differ. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/Chicken>chicken recipe category</a> includes specific conversion notes for various oven types.</p>

<h3>Testing Your Conversions</h3>
<p>The best way to confirm your 158 fan oven to conventional oven conversion is working? Use an oven thermometer to verify actual temperatures, and keep notes on what adjustments produce the best results for your specific equipment and recipes.</p>

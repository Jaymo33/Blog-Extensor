<p>1.5 tablespoons of butter equals approximately 21 grams. This conversion is essential for precise cooking, especially when using an air fryer where measurements can make or break a recipe. Whether you're whipping up a batch of cookies or preparing a savoury dish, knowing the exact weight ensures consistency. For more handy conversions, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>

<h2>Why accurate butter measurements matter</h2>  
<p>Using the correct amount of butter is crucial in air fryer cooking. Too little can leave your dish dry, while too much may cause excess grease. For recipes like air-fried pastries or crispy vegetables, 1.5 tbsp of butter (21g) provides just the right richness. Many <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> rely on precise measurements to achieve that perfect texture and flavour.</p>  

<p>Butter’s density means volume measurements like tablespoons aren’t always accurate. Factors like temperature and packing can vary the actual amount. That’s why weighing 1.5 tbsp of butter in grams (21g) removes guesswork. This is particularly helpful for baking, where exact ratios matter. A digital kitchen scale is a worthwhile investment for any air fryer enthusiast.</p>

<h2>Converting butter measurements for UK cooks</h2>  
<p>In the UK, butter is often sold in 250g blocks, making gram measurements straightforward. If your recipe calls for 1.5 tbsp of butter, simply weigh out 21g. This avoids the hassle of softening butter to measure tablespoons accurately. For more UK-specific tips, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert recipes</a> designed for air fryers.</p>  

<p>Some older UK recipes may use imperial measurements. Remember that 1.5 tbsp of butter converts to roughly 0.75 ounces or 21 grams. Modern air fryer recipes, like those on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, typically use metric for precision. Keeping a conversion chart handy saves time and prevents kitchen mishaps.</p>

<h3>Butter alternatives in air fryer cooking</h3>  
<p>If you’re out of butter, you can substitute 21g (1.5 tbsp) with margarine or coconut oil. Just note that flavour and browning may differ slightly. For healthier options, try brushing foods with olive oil spray instead. Always check your air fryer’s manual, as some non-stick coatings require specific fats.</p>  

<h3>Cleaning butter residue from your air fryer</h3>  
<p>Butter can leave sticky residues in your air fryer basket. After cooking with 1.5 tbsp (21g) of butter, wipe surfaces with a damp cloth while warm. For tougher buildup, use our recommended <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner</a>. Regular maintenance keeps your appliance performing its best.</p>

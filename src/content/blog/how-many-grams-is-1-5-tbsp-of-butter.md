<h2>Why accurate butter measurements matter</h2>  
<p>Using the correct amount of butter is crucial in air fryer cooking. Too little can leave your dish dry, while too much may cause excess grease. For recipes like air-fried pastries or crispy vegetables, 1.5 tbsp of butter (21g) provides just the right richness. Many <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> rely on precise measurements to achieve that perfect texture and flavour.</p>

That’s why weighing 1.5 tbsp of butter in grams (21g) removes guesswork. This is particularly helpful for baking, where exact ratios matter. A digital kitchen scale is a worthwhile investment for any air fryer enthusiast.</p>

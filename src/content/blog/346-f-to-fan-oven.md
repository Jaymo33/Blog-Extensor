<p>346°F converts to approximately 175°C in a fan oven. This is a common temperature for roasting vegetables, baking cakes, or crisping up frozen foods in both air fryers and fan-assisted ovens. If you're adapting recipes between these appliances, knowing this conversion ensures consistent results every time.</p>

<h2>Why Convert 346°F to Fan Oven?</h2>
<p>Many recipes, especially those from the US, list temperatures in Fahrenheit. UK kitchens typically use Celsius and fan-assisted ovens, making conversions essential. A 346°F fan oven equivalent is particularly useful for air fryer users, as these compact appliances work similarly to convection ovens. Whether you're cooking chicken, potatoes, or desserts, getting the temperature right matters.</p>
<p>At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes</a>, you'll find dozens of dishes that benefit from precise temperature control. For example, crispy roast potatoes need 175°C (346°F) to achieve that perfect golden crunch without drying out. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a> simplifies this process further.</p>

<h2>How Fan Ovens Differ from Conventional Ovens</h2>
<p>Fan ovens circulate hot air evenly, cooking food faster and more uniformly than conventional ovens. This means you often need to reduce the temperature by 20°C compared to non-fan settings. So while 346°F equals about 175°C in a fan oven, it would be closer to 195°C in a conventional one.</p>
<p>Air fryers operate on the same principle as fan ovens but in a smaller space. That's why 346°F (175°C) works so well for everything from salmon fillets to tofu stir-fries.

<h3>Adjusting Cooking Times</h3>
<p>When using 346°F in a fan oven or air fryer, keep an eye on cooking times. Dishes may cook 10-25% faster than conventional oven recipes suggest. For instance, cookies that take 12 minutes at 180°C (356°F) might be done in 9-10 minutes at 175°C (346°F).</p>

<h2>Common Uses for 346°F in Air Fryers</h2>
<p>This temperature is ideal for reheating leftovers, crisping frozen foods, or baking light cakes. Frozen chips, for example, turn out perfectly at 175°C (346°F) in just 15 minutes. It's also great for meal prep – try roasting a batch of mushrooms or peppers at this setting.</p>
<p>For easy cleaning after cooking at high temps, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner guide</a> has you covered. And if you're adapting family favourites, remember that 346°F works beautifully for dishes like shepherd's pie topping or tuna melts.</p>

<h3>Temperature Accuracy Tips</h3>
<p>Not all ovens or air fryers maintain exact temperatures. Use an oven thermometer to verify your appliance's accuracy when setting it to 175°C (346°F). Small variations can affect cooking results, especially with delicate items like soufflés or meringues.</p>

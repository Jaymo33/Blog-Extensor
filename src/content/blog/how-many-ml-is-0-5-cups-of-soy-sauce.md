<h2>Why Accurate Soy Sauce Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Soy sauce is a staple in many air fryer recipes, from crispy teriyaki chicken to flavourful tofu bites. Using too much or too little can drastically alter the taste and texture of your dish.

<h3>How to Measure 0.5 Cups of Soy Sauce Without a Measuring Cup</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a measuring cup handy, you can still measure 0.5 cups of soy sauce (118 ml) using a standard tablespoon. One tablespoon holds about 15 ml, so 8 tablespoons will give you roughly 120 ml—close enough for most recipes. Alternatively, a kitchen scale can help; 0.5 cups of soy sauce weighs around 120 grams, which converts neatly to 118 ml.</p>  

<h2>Common Recipes Using 0.5 Cups of Soy Sauce</h2>  
<p>Many air fryer recipes call for 0.5 cups of soy sauce (118 ml), especially in Asian-inspired dishes. For instance, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>air fryer chicken recipes</a> often use this amount for marinades. A popular option is honey-soy glazed chicken wings, where the soy sauce balances the sweetness of honey. Similarly, tofu stir-fries or beef skewers benefit from this precise measurement to achieve the right umami depth.</p>  

<p>Another great use for 0.5 cups of soy sauce is in homemade teriyaki sauce, which pairs beautifully with salmon or shrimp in the air fryer.

<h3>Does Soy Sauce Brand Affect the Measurement?</h3>  
<p>Most soy sauces have a similar density, so 0.5 cups (118 ml) will be consistent across brands like Kikkoman or Lee Kum Kee. However, thicker varieties, such as dark soy sauce, might be slightly denser, but the difference is negligible for home cooking. If you’re using low-sodium soy sauce, the volume remains the same, though the saltiness will vary.</p>  

<h2>Tips for Storing Leftover Soy Sauce</h2>  
<p>If your recipe only uses part of the 0.5 cups (118 ml) of soy sauce, proper storage ensures it stays fresh. Transfer unused soy sauce to an airtight container and refrigerate—it’ll last for months. Avoid leaving it in warm areas, as heat can degrade its flavour.

<p>Soy sauce can also be frozen in ice cube trays for portioned use later. Each cube holds about 15 ml (1 tablespoon), making it easy to thaw exactly what you need. This trick is handy for recipes that call for small amounts, like dressings or dipping sauces.</p>

<p>200 C converts to Gas Mark 6 in UK ovens and air fryers. This is the standard conversion used for baking, roasting, and air frying recipes across British kitchens. Whether you're following a recipe from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> or adapting oven instructions for your air fryer, knowing this conversion is essential for perfect results every time.</p>

<h2>Understanding 200 C to Gas Mark Conversions</h2>
<p>Gas Mark temperatures are commonly used in British recipes, especially for baking. When you see 200 C in a recipe, it typically means you should set your oven or air fryer to Gas Mark 6. This temperature is ideal for many air fryer recipes from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>our recipe collection</a>, including roasted vegetables, cookies, and certain meat dishes. The conversion remains consistent whether you're using a conventional oven or modern air fryer.</p>
<p>It's worth noting that 200 degrees Celsius to Gas Mark conversion is particularly important for baking, where precise temperatures matter. Many air fryer users find that knowing both temperature scales helps them adapt traditional recipes. For example, when making scones or muffins from our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>cake category</a>, setting your air fryer to 200 C (Gas Mark 6) will give you the best rise and colour.</p>

<h3>Why 200 C to Gas Mark Matters for Air Fryers</h3>
<p>Modern air fryers often display temperatures in Celsius, but many British cooks still think in Gas Marks. Converting 200 C to Gas Mark 6 helps bridge this gap, especially when using older family recipes. The hot air circulation in air fryers means cooking times might be slightly shorter than conventional ovens, but the temperature conversion remains the same.</p>

<h2>Practical Applications of 200 C to Gas Mark</h2>
<p>200 C (Gas Mark 6) is a versatile temperature for air frying. It's hot enough to crisp foods like chicken wings or roast potatoes, yet gentle enough for baking cakes and cookies. When using this temperature in your air fryer, always check our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a> for timing adjustments compared to traditional oven recipes.</p>
<p>For frozen foods like chips or chicken nuggets, 200 C (Gas Mark 6) often works perfectly. Browse our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/frozen-foods>frozen foods section</a> for specific timing recommendations. Remember that air fryers cook faster than conventional ovens, so you might need to reduce cooking times by about 20% when converting from Gas Mark recipes.</p>

<h3>Converting 200 C Fan Oven to Gas Mark</h3>
<p>If your recipe specifies 200 C for a fan oven, the Gas Mark conversion remains the same - Gas Mark 6. However, fan ovens and air fryers both circulate hot air, meaning cooking times may be similar. Always check food a few minutes early when using these more efficient cooking methods.</p>

<h2>Tips for Cooking at 200 C (Gas Mark 6) in Your Air Fryer</h2>
<p>When using 200 C in your air fryer, preheating is just as important as in a conventional oven. Most air fryers take about 3-5 minutes to reach this temperature. For even cooking, shake or turn food halfway through, especially important at this moderate-high temperature where browning occurs quickly.</p>
<p>Keep your air fryer clean for best results at 200 C (Gas Mark 6). Food particles can burn at this temperature, affecting flavour. Our guide on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaning</a> makes maintenance simple. Different foods require different approaches at this temperature - delicate items might need lower racks or foil protection from the direct heat.</p>

<h3>Common Foods Cooked at 200 C to Gas Mark 6</h3>
<p>Many popular air fryer dishes work perfectly at 200 C (Gas Mark 6). These include roasted vegetables, homemade chips, chicken pieces, and small cakes. The temperature provides enough heat for browning while cooking food through evenly. For meats, always use a thermometer to check internal temperatures regardless of the air fryer setting.</p>

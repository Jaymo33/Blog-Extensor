<p>0.75 cups of chicken broth equals approximately 177 ml. This conversion is essential for precise cooking, especially when using an air fryer where measurements can make or break a recipe. Whether you’re preparing a soup, sauce, or marinade, knowing the exact millilitre equivalent ensures consistent results. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we focus on making conversions simple so you can focus on cooking.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on precise ingredient ratios to achieve the perfect texture and flavour. Too much or too little liquid, like chicken broth, can affect browning and crispiness. For example, 0.75 cups of chicken broth (177 ml) is a common measurement in recipes like air-fried risotto or gravy. Using the correct amount ensures even cooking and avoids soggy results. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more handy tips.</p>  

<p>Many air fryer recipes, especially those for sauces or braised dishes, call for small amounts of broth. Measuring 0.75 cups of chicken broth in millilitres (177 ml) helps avoid guesswork. This is particularly useful for UK cooks, where metric measurements are standard. Whether you’re adapting a US recipe or scaling portions, accuracy is key. Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a> for dishes that use this measurement.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure 0.75 Cups of Chicken Broth Without a Measuring Cup</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a measuring cup, you can use a kitchen scale or common household items. Since 0.75 cups of chicken broth is 177 ml, a standard UK teacup (about 190 ml) can work in a pinch. Alternatively, 12 tablespoons (3/4 of a 16-tbsp cup) will get you close. For best results, we recommend using a liquid measuring jug marked in millilitres. Need more conversion help? Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion guide</a> covers all the basics.</p>  

<h2>Common Recipes Using 0.75 Cups of Chicken Broth</h2>  
<p>Many air fryer dishes, like creamy pasta bakes or stuffed mushrooms, use 0.75 cups (177 ml) of chicken broth. This amount is ideal for deglazing pans or adding moisture without overwhelming other flavours. For example, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipes</a> often include this measurement for marinades. It’s also perfect for cooking grains like quinoa or couscous directly in the air fryer.</p>  

<p>When adapting stovetop recipes for the air fryer, converting 0.75 cups of chicken broth to millilitres (177 ml) ensures consistency. Soups and stews, for instance, benefit from precise liquid ratios to prevent overflow. If you’re meal prepping, knowing this conversion helps scale recipes up or down.

<h3>US vs. UK Measurements: What You Need to Know</h3>  
<p>While 0.75 US cups of chicken broth equals 177 ml, UK cups differ slightly (1 UK cup = 284 ml). Always check the recipe’s origin to avoid errors. Most modern air fryer recipes, including those on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, use metric measurements for clarity. If you’re using a US recipe, our conversion tools ensure you get it right every time.</p>

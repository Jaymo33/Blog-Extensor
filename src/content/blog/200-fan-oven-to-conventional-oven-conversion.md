<p>200 fan oven equals approximately 180°C in a conventional oven. This conversion is essential for adapting recipes between different oven types, ensuring your dishes turn out perfectly every time. Whether you're baking cakes or roasting meats, understanding this conversion can make all the difference.</p>

<h2>Understanding Fan Oven vs Conventional Oven</h2>
<p>Fan ovens circulate hot air around the food, cooking it more evenly and quickly than conventional ovens. This means temperatures in fan ovens are typically set 20°C lower than in conventional ovens. When you see a recipe calling for 200 fan oven, you'll need to adjust it to 180°C for a conventional oven.</p>
<p>This difference is crucial when using an air fryer too, as they work similarly to fan ovens. Many <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> are based on fan oven temperatures, making this conversion knowledge doubly useful. Always check your appliance manual for specific guidance, as some models may vary slightly.</p>

<h2>Why Temperature Conversion Matters</h2>
<p>Getting the temperature right ensures your food cooks properly without burning or drying out. A 200 fan oven to conventional oven conversion is particularly important for baked goods, where precise temperatures affect texture and rise. Meats also need accurate temperatures to cook safely while remaining juicy.</p>
<p>When converting 200°C fan oven to normal oven temperature, remember the general rule: subtract 20°C. This simple calculation works for most recipes, from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>cakes</a> to roasted vegetables.

<h3>Common Conversion Scenarios</h3>
<p>When converting 200 fan oven to celsius for conventional ovens, you'll use 180°C for most recipes. However, some dishes might need slight adjustments. For example, delicate pastries might benefit from a slightly lower temperature, while dense meats might need a bit higher.</p>

<h2>Practical Conversion Tips</h2>
<p>Always preheat your oven to the converted temperature before cooking. This ensures even cooking from the start. When converting 200 c fan oven to normal oven, consider the cooking time too - conventional ovens might need slightly longer than fan ovens for the same result.</p>
<p>Keep an oven thermometer handy to verify your oven's actual temperature, as some models can run hot or cold. This is especially useful when trying new recipes or when precision matters.

<h3>Adjusting Cooking Times</h3>
<p>While the 200 fan oven to conventional oven conversion mainly focuses on temperature, cooking times may need adjusting too. Conventional ovens typically take 10-15% longer than fan ovens to cook food through. Keep an eye on your dish, especially when trying a new recipe.</p>

<h2>Special Considerations for Air Fryers</h2>
<p>Air fryers work similarly to fan ovens, circulating hot air around the food. This means the 200 fan oven to air fryer equivalent is often a direct 1:1 conversion. However, because air fryers are more compact, cooking times are usually shorter than even fan ovens.</p>
<p>When adapting conventional oven recipes to air fryers, first convert the temperature (200 fan to 180 conventional), then reduce the cooking time by about 20%. This dual adjustment helps achieve perfect results in your air fryer every time.</p>

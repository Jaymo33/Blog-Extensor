<h3>How to measure treacle correctly</h3>  
<p>Measuring treacle can be tricky due to its sticky consistency. To get an accurate 2.5 cups (20 oz), lightly grease your measuring cup or use a spatula to scrape it out.

<p>If substituting treacle with golden syrup or molasses, note that their weights per cup may differ slightly. Always confirm conversions to avoid altering the recipe’s balance. For precise results, stick to the 2.5 cups treacle to 20 oz measurement when possible.</p>  

<h3>Storing leftover treacle</h3>  
<p>After measuring out 2.5 cups (20 oz) of treacle, store the rest in an airtight container to prevent crystallisation. Keep it in a cool, dark place, and it’ll last for months. Treacle’s long shelf life makes it a pantry staple for impromptu air fryer baking sessions.</p>

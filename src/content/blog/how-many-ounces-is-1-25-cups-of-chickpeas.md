<p>1.25 cups of chickpeas equals approximately 10 ounces (283 grams). This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes, ensuring your dishes turn out perfectly every time. Whether you're roasting chickpeas for a crunchy snack or adding them to a hearty stew, accurate measurements make all the difference. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we’re all about precision in cooking, so let’s dive deeper into chickpea measurements.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Chickpea Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of chickpeas ensures your air fryer recipes have the perfect texture and flavour. Too few, and your dish might lack substance; too many, and it could become dry or unevenly cooked. Chickpeas are a staple in many air fryer meals, from crispy snacks to protein-packed mains. For more conversion tips, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> to simplify your cooking process.</p>  

<p>Chickpeas are also incredibly versatile, working well in everything from salads to curries. If you’re meal prepping, knowing how many ounces are in 1.25 cups helps you portion meals accurately. Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/beans>bean recipes</a> for inspiration on using chickpeas in your air fryer.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure Chickpeas Correctly</h3>  
<p>For the most accurate measurement, use a kitchen scale to weigh your chickpeas. If you don’t have one, fluff the chickpeas in the container before scooping them into a measuring cup. Level off the top with a straight edge to ensure you’re not over-packing. This method helps avoid discrepancies between volume and weight measurements.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for 1.25 Cups of Chickpeas</h2>  
<p>1.25 cups (or 10 ounces) of chickpeas is a great amount for many air fryer recipes. You can roast them with spices for a crunchy snack, blend them into hummus, or toss them into a veggie-packed stir-fry. For recipe ideas, browse our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> collection.</p>  

<p>Chickpeas are also fantastic for meal prep—cook a batch at the start of the week and use them in salads, wraps, or grain bowls. Their high protein and fibre content make them a nutritious addition to any meal. If you’re new to cooking with chickpeas, start with simple recipes and experiment with flavours.</p>  

<h3>Tips for Cooking Chickpeas in Your Air Fryer</h3>  
<p>To get the best results, pat your chickpeas dry before air frying to ensure crispiness. Toss them in a bit of oil and your favourite seasonings, then spread them in a single layer in the air fryer basket. Cook at 190°C (375°F) for 12–15 minutes, shaking the basket halfway through. For more tips, check out our guide on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>keeping your air fryer clean</a> between uses.</p>

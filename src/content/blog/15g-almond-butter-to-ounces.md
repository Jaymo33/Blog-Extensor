<p>15 grams of almond butter is equal to approximately 0.53 ounces. This conversion is handy when following air fryer recipes that require precise measurements, especially for baking or creating nut-based sauces. Whether you're whipping up a batch of almond butter cookies or adding a creamy touch to your air fryer desserts, knowing this conversion ensures accuracy.</p>  

<h2>Why Convert 15g of Almond Butter to Ounces?</h2>  
<p>Many UK recipes, especially those for air fryers, use grams for precision. However, some kitchen scales or older recipes might list ingredients in ounces. Converting 15g of almond butter to ounces (0.53 oz) helps avoid guesswork, ensuring your dishes turn out perfectly every time. For more air fryer measurement tips, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>  

<p>Almond butter is a popular ingredient in healthy air fryer recipes, from energy bites to gluten-free coatings. Whether you're meal prepping or baking, accurate measurements matter. A slight variation can affect texture, especially in recipes like almond butter protein bars or air-fried granola clusters.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure 15g of Almond Butter Accurately</h3>  
<p>For the best results, use a digital kitchen scale set to grams. Scoop almond butter into a small bowl until it reads 15g. If you don’t have a scale, two level teaspoons roughly equal 15g (0.53 oz), though this can vary slightly based on density. Sticky ingredients like almond butter are easier to measure with a spatula or spoon lightly coated in oil.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for 15g of Almond Butter in Air Fryer Recipes</h2>  
<p>This small but mighty portion is perfect for adding richness to air fryer breakfasts or desserts. Try mixing 15g of almond butter into overnight oats before air-frying for a crispy topping, or drizzle it over air-fried banana slices for a quick treat. Explore more ideas in our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes collection</a>.</p>  

<p>Almond butter also works wonders in savoury dishes. Combine 15g with soy sauce and honey for a glaze on air-fried tofu or chicken. Its creamy texture helps coatings stick while adding a nutty depth of flavour.

<h3>Tips for Storing Almond Butter</h3>  
<p>To keep almond butter fresh, store it in a cool, dark place after opening. Stir well before use, as natural oils can separate. If you’re measuring 15g frequently, consider portioning it into small containers for easy access during meal prep. Clean your air fryer basket afterward with our recommended <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner</a> to avoid sticky residue.</p>

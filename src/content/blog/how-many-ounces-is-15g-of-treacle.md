<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on precise ingredient ratios to deliver even cooking and perfect textures. Using the correct amount of treacle—whether 15g or its ounce equivalent—ensures your dishes aren’t too sweet or too dry. For example, a <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>treacle-glazed salmon</a> requires just the right balance to caramelise properly. Even small deviations can affect browning and flavour, so measuring 15g of treacle accurately is key.</p>  

<p>Many UK recipes use grams, but if your kitchen scale only measures ounces, converting 15g of treacle to ounces (0.53 oz) is a lifesaver. This is especially handy for <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert recipes</a>, where treacle’s thickness can throw off volume-based measurements like tablespoons. Always weigh sticky ingredients like treacle for the best results.</p>

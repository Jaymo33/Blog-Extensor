<p>40g of chopped onion is approximately 1.41 ounces. This conversion is handy when following air fryer recipes that use metric or imperial measurements. Whether you're whipping up a quick stir-fry or prepping ingredients for a casserole, knowing how to convert grams to ounces ensures accuracy in your cooking.</p>

<h2>Why converting 40g of chopped onion matters</h2>  
<p>Precision is key when cooking, especially with air fryers where ingredient ratios can affect texture and cooking times. Chopped onion is a common ingredient in many dishes, from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable-based recipes</a> to hearty mains. Converting 40g to ounces helps you follow recipes accurately, whether they're from the UK or internationally sourced.</p>  
<p>Air fryers excel at delivering crispy, evenly cooked meals, but they rely on the right proportions. Too much or too little onion can alter the flavour balance or moisture content of your dish. By knowing that 40g equals roughly 1.41 ounces, you can adapt recipes with confidence.

<h3>How to measure 40g of chopped onion</h3>  
<p>For the most accurate measurement, use digital kitchen scales set to grams. If you don't have scales, 40g of chopped onion is roughly equivalent to 1/3 cup, but this can vary slightly depending on how finely you've diced it. When preparing ingredients for your air fryer, consistency in size ensures even cooking, so aim for uniform pieces.</p>

<h2>Common uses for 40g of chopped onion</h2>  
<p>This quantity is perfect for adding flavour to single-serving dishes or as part of a larger recipe. You might use it in <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer frittatas</a>, stuffed peppers, or as a base for sauces. The air fryer's rapid air circulation caramelises onions beautifully, enhancing their natural sweetness while keeping them tender.</p>  
<p>When working with 40g of chopped onion (1.41 ounces), remember that onion reduces slightly during cooking. If a recipe calls for raw onion, don't be tempted to skimp - that 40g measurement ensures enough flavour remains after cooking. For dishes where onion is the star, like onion bhajis, you might want to increase the quantity while maintaining the same 40g to ounces ratio for other ingredients.</p>

<h3>Tips for preparing chopped onion in your air fryer</h3>  
<p>To get the most from your 40g of chopped onion, toss it lightly in oil before air frying. This helps prevent drying and promotes even browning. Keep the temperature around 160°C for gentle cooking or go up to 180°C for quicker caramelisation. Remember to shake the basket occasionally for uniform results.</p>

<h2>Converting other onion quantities</h2>  
<p>While we've focused on 40g chopped onion to ounces, you might need to convert different amounts. The same conversion factor applies - simply multiply grams by 0.035 to get ounces. For larger batches, like when meal prepping <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/meal-prep>freezer-friendly dishes</a>, these conversions become even more valuable.</p>  
<p>If you're working with whole onions rather than pre-chopped, remember that one medium onion typically yields about 150g (5.3 ounces) when chopped. This means 40g represents roughly a quarter of a medium onion. Keeping these benchmarks in mind helps when adapting recipes or scaling quantities up and down.</p>

<h3>Storing leftover chopped onion</h3>  
<p>If you've measured out 40g of chopped onion but don't use it all, proper storage maintains freshness. Keep it in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 3 days, or freeze for longer storage. When you're ready to use it, there's no need to thaw - frozen chopped onion can go straight into the air fryer, though cooking time may increase slightly.</p>

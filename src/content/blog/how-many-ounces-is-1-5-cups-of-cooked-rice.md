<p>1.5 cups of cooked rice equals approximately 12 ounces (340 grams). This conversion is handy for air fryer recipes, ensuring precise measurements for perfect results every time. Whether you’re meal prepping or scaling a dish, knowing the weight of cooked rice helps maintain consistency.</p>

<h2>Why convert cups to ounces for cooked rice?</h2>  
<p>Converting cups to ounces is essential for accuracy, especially in air fryer cooking where portion control matters. Cups measure volume, while ounces measure weight, and rice can vary in density. Using weight ensures your <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> turn out just right, whether you’re making fried rice or a rice-based casserole.</p>  
<p>For example, if a recipe calls for 1.5 cups of cooked rice, weighing it at 12 ounces guarantees the correct texture and cooking time. This is particularly useful for meal prepping, where consistency is key. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more handy measurements.</p>

<h3>How to measure 1.5 cups of cooked rice</h3>  
<p>To measure 1.5 cups of cooked rice, fluff it lightly with a fork before scooping it into a measuring cup. Avoid packing it down, as this can lead to an inaccurate weight. For best results, use a kitchen scale to confirm the weight is around 12 ounces.</p>

<h2>Common uses for 1.5 cups of cooked rice</h2>  
<p>1.5 cups of cooked rice (12 ounces) is a versatile quantity for air fryer dishes. It’s perfect for single-serving stir-fries, stuffed peppers, or rice bowls. You can also use it as a base for <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable-packed meals</a>, ensuring a balanced portion every time.</p>  
<p>If you’re reheating rice in the air fryer, 1.5 cups is an ideal amount to avoid overcrowding. Spread it evenly in the basket for even heating, and spritz with water to restore moisture.

<h3>Adjusting recipes with 1.5 cups of cooked rice</h3>  
<p>When adapting recipes, remember that 1.5 cups of cooked rice equals 12 ounces. This helps when scaling up or down, ensuring flavors and textures stay balanced. For example, if a recipe serves four but you’re cooking for two, halving the rice quantity is straightforward with weight measurements.</p>

<h2>Tips for cooking rice in the air fryer</h2>  
<p>Cooking rice in the air fryer is quick and easy, especially for smaller portions like 1.5 cups. Use oven-safe containers or foil pans, and add a bit of extra liquid to prevent drying. Preheating the air fryer ensures even cooking, and stirring halfway through avoids clumping.</p>  
<p>For crispy rice dishes, spread cooked rice in a thin layer and air fry at 375°F (190°C) for 5–7 minutes. This technique works great for <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/breakfast>breakfast fried rice</a> or crunchy toppings. Experiment with seasonings and mix-ins to customize your dish.</p>

<h3>Storing and reheating cooked rice</h3>  
<p>Store leftover cooked rice in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 3 days. When reheating in the air fryer, add a splash of water to revive the texture. For 1.5 cups (12 ounces), reheat at 350°F (175°C) for 3–4 minutes, stirring once.</p>

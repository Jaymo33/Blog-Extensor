<p>2 tablespoons (tbsp) of lemon juice weigh approximately 30 grams. This measurement is essential for air fryer recipes where precision ensures the best texture and flavour. Whether you’re marinating chicken or adding zest to desserts, knowing the exact weight helps avoid recipe mishaps.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on precise ingredient ratios to achieve crispy, evenly cooked results. Too much or too little lemon juice can affect moisture levels, altering the dish’s outcome. For example, a marinade with excess liquid might make chicken soggy instead of crispy. That’s why converting 2 tbsp of lemon juice to grams (30g) is so useful.</p>  

<p>If you’re experimenting with new recipes, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for other common measurements. It’s a handy tool for adjusting quantities without guesswork.</p>  

<h3>How to measure lemon juice accurately</h3>  
<p>For the most precise results, use a digital kitchen scale. Pour lemon juice directly into a bowl on the scale until it reaches 30 grams. If you don’t have a scale, a standard UK tablespoon holds about 15ml, so 2 tbsp equals roughly 30 grams. Freshly squeezed juice may vary slightly, but this is a reliable baseline.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for 2 tbsp of lemon juice in air fryer recipes</h2>  
<p>Lemon juice adds brightness to many dishes, from seafood to vegetables. For example, drizzle 30 grams (2 tbsp) over salmon before air frying for a zesty finish. It also works wonders in marinades for chicken or tofu, tenderising proteins while adding flavour.</p>  

<p>Looking for inspiration? Browse our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> collection, where lemon juice often stars in dressings and glazes. A little goes a long way in enhancing taste without extra calories.</p>  

<h3>Does bottled lemon juice weigh the same as fresh?</h3>  
<p>Bottled lemon juice is slightly denser due to added preservatives, but the difference is minimal. Two tablespoons still weigh close to 30 grams. However, fresh juice offers a brighter flavour, ideal for dishes where citrus shines, like our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>lemon-herb chicken</a>.</p>  

<h2>Adjusting recipes when substituting lemon juice</h2>  
<p>If a recipe calls for lemon zest instead of juice, note that 2 tbsp of zest weighs less—about 10 grams. Always adjust quantities to avoid overpowering flavours. For more tips on tweaking recipes, visit <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>.</p>  

<h3>Cleaning your air fryer after citrus-based recipes</h3>  
<p>Lemon juice can leave residues that attract odours. After cooking, wipe your air fryer basket with a damp cloth and our recommended <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner</a> to maintain freshness.</p>

<h2>Why accurate butter measurements matter</h2>
<p>Using the right amount of butter is crucial for both texture and flavour in your dishes. Too much butter can make baked goods greasy, while too little can leave them dry. In an air fryer, precise measurements help achieve that perfect crispiness without overdoing it. For example, when making air fryer cookies, 3 tbsp of butter (42.5g) ensures the dough holds together without spreading too much.

<p>Butter is often measured by volume (tablespoons) in recipes, but weight (grams) is far more accurate. This is because the density of butter can vary slightly depending on temperature and how it’s packed into the spoon. For consistent results, especially in air fryer cooking, weighing your butter is the way to go. If you’re new to air frying, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> guide has all the basics covered.</p>

<h2>How to measure 3 tbsp of butter in grams</h2>
<p>The easiest way to measure 3 tbsp of butter in grams is by using a kitchen scale. Simply scoop your butter into a tablespoon measure, then weigh it for accuracy. If you don’t have a scale, remember that 1 tbsp of butter is about 14.2 grams, so 3 tbsp would be roughly 42.5 grams. This method works for both salted and unsalted butter, though weights can vary slightly by brand.</p>

<h3>Using butter measurements in air fryer recipes</h3>
<p>When adapting recipes for your air fryer, precise butter measurements become even more important. The air fryer’s intense heat means small measurement errors can lead to overcooking or uneven results. For instance, when making air fryer garlic bread, 3 tbsp (42.5g) of butter perfectly coats the bread without making it soggy.

<h2>Common butter measurement conversions</h2>
<p>Here are some quick conversions to keep in mind when working with butter in your air fryer recipes:</p>
<ul>
<li>1 tablespoon butter = 14.2 grams</li>
<li>3 tablespoons butter = 42.5 grams</li>
<li>1/4 cup butter = 56.7 grams</li>
<li>1/2 cup butter = 113.4 grams</li>
</ul>

<p>These conversions are particularly useful when scaling recipes up or down for your air fryer. Remember that European butter sometimes has a slightly higher fat content, which can affect weight measurements.

<h2>Tips for measuring butter without scales</h2>
<p>If you don’t have kitchen scales, there are still ways to measure 3 tbsp of butter accurately. Most butter packaging has markings showing tablespoon measurements along the side. For a standard UK block of butter (250g), each 1cm slice is roughly 25g, so you’d need about 1.7cm for 42.5g. Alternatively, a heaped dessertspoon is roughly equivalent to one tablespoon.</p>

<h3>Butter alternatives in air fryer cooking</h3>
<p>While butter adds wonderful flavour, you might sometimes need alternatives. In air fryer cooking, oils with higher smoke points are often better. However, when a recipe specifically calls for 3 tbsp (42.5g) of butter, you can substitute with margarine or coconut oil in the same weight measurement. Just be aware this may slightly alter the texture and taste of your dish.</p>

<p>0.5 cup of double cream equals approximately 4.23 ounces (120 grams). This measurement is essential for air fryer recipes where precision ensures the perfect texture and consistency. Whether you're making creamy sauces, desserts, or indulgent dishes, knowing this conversion helps avoid kitchen mishaps.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on precise measurements to deliver consistent results. Using the correct amount of double cream ensures your dishes aren’t too runny or overly thick. For example, a <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>creamy pasta bake</a> requires just the right balance to achieve that rich, velvety texture. Too much cream can make it soggy, while too little may leave it dry.</p>  

<p>Many air fryer recipes, especially desserts like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>chocolate mousse</a>, depend on exact measurements. Double cream is denser than single cream, so 0.5 cup (4.23 oz) provides the ideal richness without overpowering other ingredients. Always measure carefully for best results!</p>  

<h3>How to Measure 0.5 Cup of Double Cream Correctly</h3>  
<p>Use a liquid measuring cup for accuracy. Pour the double cream slowly, checking at eye level to ensure it reaches the 0.5 cup mark. If you don’t have measuring cups, a kitchen scale set to ounces (4.23 oz) works perfectly. For UK cooks, this conversion is especially handy as many recipes use metric measurements.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for 0.5 Cup of Double Cream in Air Fryer Recipes</h2>  
<p>This measurement is perfect for small-batch recipes. Try it in <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>air fryer cheesecakes</a>, where 0.5 cup of double cream (4.23 oz) creates a luscious filling. It’s also ideal for creamy dips or <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>converting other ingredients</a> in mixed dishes.</p>  

<p>Another great use is in savoury dishes like garlic mushrooms. The cream blends beautifully with herbs, and 0.5 cup is just enough to coat without drowning the ingredients.

<h3>Converting Other Cream Measurements</h3>  
<p>If a recipe calls for a different amount, here’s a quick reference: 1 cup of double cream equals 8.46 oz, while ¼ cup is 2.12 oz. These conversions help adjust portions without compromising texture. Always use fresh double cream for the best results in your air fryer.</p>

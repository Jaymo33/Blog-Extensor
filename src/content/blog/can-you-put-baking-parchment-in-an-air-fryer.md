<p>Yes, you can put baking parchment in an air fryer if you use it correctly. The key is ensuring it doesn’t obstruct airflow or come into contact with heating elements. When positioned properly, baking parchment makes air frying mess-free and prevents food from sticking to the basket.</p>

<h2>How to Safely Use Baking Parchment in Your Air Fryer</h2>
<p>Cut the parchment to fit your air fryer basket without covering the entire base. Leave gaps around the edges to allow proper air circulation, which is crucial for even cooking. You can also perforate the parchment with small holes to improve airflow. Avoid letting the parchment touch the heating element at the top, as this could cause it to burn or catch fire. For added safety, weigh down the edges with food or use parchment with pre-cut air fryer shapes available at <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>.</p>

<p>Different air fryer models may require slight adjustments. For example, Ninja air fryers often have taller baskets, so ensure your parchment doesn’t curl up during cooking. Always monitor your air fryer during the first few minutes to check the parchment stays in place. If you’re reheating leftovers like pizza or fries, parchment works brilliantly to keep them crisp without sticking – just keep temperatures below 200°C.</p>

<h3>Does Baking Parchment Melt or Catch Fire?</h3>
<p>Quality baking parchment won’t melt in an air fryer if used correctly. Most brands are heat-resistant up to 220-230°C, well above typical air frying temperatures. However, cheap or waxed papers might scorch at high heat. To test compatibility, place a small piece in your air fryer at 180°C for 2-3 minutes before full use. For foolproof results, look for parchment specifically labelled as air fryer-safe when shopping at kitchen stores or online.</p>

<h2>When Should You Avoid Using Parchment?</h2>
<p>Avoid parchment when cooking very lightweight foods like herbs or kale chips that could blow around. The moving air might dislodge the paper, potentially causing it to touch heating elements. Similarly, skip parchment for recipes requiring frequent shaking of the basket, as this increases fire risks. For greasy foods like chicken wings, consider an air fryer liner instead – they’re more stable and often reusable.</p>

<p>Some air fryer manufacturers explicitly warn against using parchment, so always check your manual first. If you’re unsure, try alternative non-stick methods like lightly oiling the basket or using silicone inserts. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> includes temperature adjustments for different cooking surfaces that might help.</p>

<h3>Best Practices for Parchment in Air Fryers</h3>
<p>Always use plain, unbleached baking parchment – never wax paper or aluminium foil substitutes. Trim sheets to leave at least 2cm clearance from basket walls. For round baskets, trace and cut a circle slightly smaller than the base. When cooking multiple batches, replace parchment between loads to prevent grease buildup. After use, let the parchment cool completely before disposal to avoid burns.</p>

<p>For messy recipes like sticky ribs or saucy wings, parchment makes cleanup a breeze. Just lift it out and discard, leaving your basket spotless. Combine this with regular cleaning using our recommended <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner</a> to maintain your appliance in top condition. Many users find parchment indispensable for baking items like cookies or small cakes in their air fryers.</p>

<h2>Parchment Alternatives for Air Fryers</h2>
<p>Silicone mats designed for air fryers offer a reusable option that’s equally non-stick. These often have raised edges to contain drips while allowing airflow. Some cooks prefer lightly greasing the basket with oil spray for certain recipes, especially when aiming for extra crispiness. For breaded items, a light coating of oil on the food itself often prevents sticking without any liner.</p>

<p>If you frequently cook without parchment, consider investing in a good quality non-stick air fryer basket. Many newer models feature ceramic or diamond-infused coatings that release food easily.

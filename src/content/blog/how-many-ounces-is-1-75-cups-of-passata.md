    "@type": "Answer",
    "text": "If your sauce is too watery, you might have used a particularly liquid passata brand or added extra liquid. Remember that 1.75 cups should equal about 14.8 ounces. Try reducing the sauce in a pan before air frying, or use less liquid in your recipe. Some air fryer models circulate air differently, which can affect sauce consistency."

Thaw in the refrigerator before use. This method works perfectly for meal prep, ensuring you always have the right amount ready for your air fryer recipes."

<p>1.75 cups of passata equals approximately 14.8 ounces. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements can make all the difference. Whether you're making a rich tomato sauce or a hearty stew, knowing the exact weight ensures consistent results every time.</p>

<h2>Why accurate passata measurements matter</h2>
<p>Using the right amount of passata is crucial for balancing flavours in your dishes. Too little can leave your meal tasting bland, while too much might overpower other ingredients. For air fryer recipes, where cooking times are shorter, precision is even more important. A well-measured 1.75 cups of passata (14.8 ounces) helps achieve that perfect consistency.</p>
<p>At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we understand how vital accurate conversions are. That's why we provide detailed guides like our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> to help home cooks get it right. Whether you're working with passata, flour, or any other ingredient, proper measurements lead to better results.</p>

<h2>How to measure passata correctly</h2>
<p>When measuring passata, it's best to use liquid measuring cups for accuracy. These have spouts and clear markings that make it easy to see the 1.75 cup measurement line. For those who prefer weights, a kitchen scale set to ounces will give you the precise 14.8 ounces equivalent.</p>
<p>Remember that passata's thickness can vary slightly between brands. Some may be more watery, while others are thicker. This can affect the weight slightly, but 14.8 ounces is a reliable average. If you're making one of our delicious <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a>, stick to this measurement for best results.</p>

<h3>Converting other passata measurements</h3>
<p>If your recipe calls for different amounts of passata, here are some common conversions: 1 cup equals about 8.45 ounces, while 2 cups equal approximately 16.9 ounces. These conversions are particularly useful when scaling recipes up or down for your air fryer.</p>

<h3>Using passata in air fryer cooking</h3>
<p>Passata works wonderfully in air fryer dishes, from meatball sauces to vegetable bakes. Its smooth texture and concentrated tomato flavour enhance meals without adding unnecessary bulk. When using 1.75 cups (14.8 ounces) in your air fryer, consider reducing other liquids slightly to account for passata's moisture content.</p>

<h2>Storing leftover passata</h2>
<p>If you have leftover passata after measuring out your 1.75 cups (14.8 ounces), proper storage is key. Transfer it to an airtight container and refrigerate for up to 5 days. For longer storage, freeze in portion-sized containers. This way, you'll always have passata ready for your next air fryer creation.</p>
<p>Keeping your air fryer clean is just as important as accurate measurements. After cooking with passata, be sure to use our recommended <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner</a> to remove any tomato residue. This maintains your appliance's performance and prevents flavours from transferring between dishes.</p>

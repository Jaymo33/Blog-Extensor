<p>1.5 tablespoons (tbsp) of almond milk equals approximately 22.5 grams (g). This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precision matters, ensuring your dishes turn out perfectly every time. Whether you're baking, frying, or making sauces, knowing the exact weight of almond milk can make all the difference.</p>

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>
<p>Using the right amount of almond milk in your air fryer recipes ensures consistent results. Too much or too little can affect texture, moisture, and even cooking times. For example, a <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>cake recipe</a> might turn out dry if you underestimate the almond milk. Conversely, excess liquid could make batters too runny, leading to uneven cooking.</p>
<p>Air fryers circulate hot air rapidly, so precise measurements help maintain balance. Almond milk, being lighter than dairy milk, requires careful weighing. A digital kitchen scale is ideal, but if you don’t have one, our conversion guide ensures accuracy. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more handy tips.</p>

<h2>How to measure 1.5 tbsp of almond milk without scales</h2>
<p>If you don’t have scales, use a standard UK tablespoon (15ml) to measure almond milk. Fill it to the brim and level it off with a knife for accuracy. Repeat this 1.5 times, or use a half tablespoon for the remaining 0.5 tbsp. Remember, 1.5 tbsp of almond milk is roughly 22.5 grams.</p>
<p>For sticky or thick almond milk varieties, lightly grease the spoon to ensure it slides off easily. This method works well for recipes like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>air fryer desserts</a>, where precision is key. Always use room-temperature almond milk for the most accurate measurements.</p>

<h3>Converting other almond milk quantities to grams</h3>
<p>Need to convert different amounts? Here’s a quick reference: 1 tbsp almond milk = 15g, 2 tbsp = 30g, and 3 tbsp = 45g. These conversions are based on standard UK tablespoons. For larger quantities, multiply accordingly—e.g., 4 tbsp would be 60g.</p>

<h2>Common uses for almond milk in air fryer recipes</h2>
<p>Almond milk is a versatile ingredient in air fryer cooking. It’s perfect for vegan <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/breakfast>breakfasts</a>, like pancakes or muffins, and adds a light, nutty flavour. It also works well in savoury dishes, such as creamy sauces or marinades for <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>air fryer chicken</a>.</p>
<p>Because almond milk is lower in fat than dairy milk, it helps create crispier coatings. For example, when making air-fried tofu, a light almond milk wash before breading enhances texture. Always store almond milk properly to maintain freshness—shake well before use, as it can separate.</p>

<h3>Tips for cleaning your air fryer after using almond milk</h3>

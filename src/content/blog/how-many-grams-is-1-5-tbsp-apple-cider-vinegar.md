<p>1.5 tablespoons (tbsp) of apple cider vinegar equals approximately 22.5 grams.

At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we focus on accurate measurements to help you master air fryer cooking.</p>

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>
<p>Air fryers rely on precise ingredient ratios to achieve the perfect texture and flavour. Too much or too little apple cider vinegar can throw off the balance of your recipe. For example, a marinade with 1.5 tbsp of apple cider vinegar (22.5g) helps tenderise meat while adding a subtle tang.

<p>Many air fryer recipes, like crispy tofu or glazed salmon, call for small amounts of liquids like apple cider vinegar. Measuring by weight (grams) is often more reliable than volume (tablespoons), especially for sticky or dense ingredients. This precision ensures your dishes turn out perfectly every time, whether you’re following a recipe from our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipes</a> section or creating your own.</p>

<h2>How to measure 1.5 tbsp of apple cider vinegar accurately</h2>
<p>For the most accurate measurement, use a digital kitchen scale set to grams. Pour the apple cider vinegar directly into a bowl on the scale until it reaches 22.5g. If you don’t have a scale, use a standard UK tablespoon (15ml) and fill it 1.5 times. Remember, UK tablespoons differ slightly from US measurements, so always double-check.</p>
<p>Apple cider vinegar’s density can vary slightly depending on temperature and brand, but 1.5 tbsp generally weighs around 22.5 grams. This consistency makes it easy to adapt recipes for your air fryer.

<h3>Tips for working with apple cider vinegar in air fryers</h3>
<p>Always dilute concentrated vinegar when using it in marinades or sprays. The 1.5 tbsp (22.5g) measurement works well when combined with oils or other liquids.

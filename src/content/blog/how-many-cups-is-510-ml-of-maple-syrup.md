<p>510 ml of maple syrup is approximately 2.15 cups in the US measurement system and roughly 1.8 cups in the UK. Whether you're baking or preparing a glaze for your air fryer dishes, knowing this conversion ensures accuracy. Maple syrup is a staple in many recipes, from pancakes to marinades, and getting the measurement right can make all the difference.</p>

<h2>Understanding Maple Syrup Measurements</h2>
<p>Maple syrup is thicker than water, which means its volume-to-weight ratio differs. This is why converting millilitres to cups isn't as straightforward as it might seem. For precise results, especially in air fryer recipes, using the correct cup measurement is crucial. A slight miscalculation can alter the texture and taste of your dish.</p>
<p>In the US, a standard cup holds 240 ml, while in the UK, it's 284 ml. This difference explains why 510 ml of maple syrup translates to slightly fewer cups in the UK. Always check your recipe's origin to ensure you're using the right conversion.

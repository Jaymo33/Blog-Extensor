Too little, and your air fryer cakes might turn out dense; too much, and batters can become soggy. For foolproof recipes, bookmark our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> to simplify your kitchen maths.</p>

<p>Many air fryer recipes, especially those for <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>cakes</a> or fried chicken, rely on buttermilk’s acidity. The 185 ml measurement often appears in European recipes, while American versions use cups. Knowing that 185 ml of buttermilk equals roughly 0.78 cups bridges this gap effortlessly.</p>

<h3>Measuring 185 ml of Buttermilk Without a Scale</h3>
<p>No measuring jug? No problem. To measure 185 ml of buttermilk in cups, use a standard 240 ml (1 cup) measure and fill it just below the ¾ cup line. Alternatively, 12 tablespoons plus 2 teaspoons will get you close. For sticky batters like those in our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a>, slight variations won’t hurt—but precision matters for delicate bakes.</p>

<h2>Converting 185 ml of Buttermilk for Different Recipes</h2>
<p>Air fryer recipes often adapt oven or stovetop methods, requiring adjusted liquid volumes. When a recipe calls for 185 ml of buttermilk, remember it’s about ⅔ cup plus 1 tablespoon. This works perfectly for marinades in <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipes</a>, where buttermilk tenderises meat before air frying.</p>

<p>For thicker batters, like those in onion rings or cornbread, 185 ml of buttermilk (0.78 cups) provides ideal moisture without dilution. Pair it with our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner</a> tips to tackle any post-cooking mess effortlessly. Pro tip: Shake your buttermilk carton well before measuring—it separates over time!</p>

<h3>Buttermilk Substitutes at 185 ml</h3>
<p>Out of buttermilk? For 185 ml (0.78 cups), mix 170 ml milk with 15 ml lemon juice or vinegar. Let it sit for 5 minutes to thicken. This works in most <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert recipes</a>, though real buttermilk gives superior tang. Yogurt thinned with milk (1:1 ratio) also substitutes well at this measurement.</p>

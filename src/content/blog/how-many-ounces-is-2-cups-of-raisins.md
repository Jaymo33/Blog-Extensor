<p>2 cups of raisins weigh approximately 10 ounces (283 grams). This measurement is essential for air fryer recipes, ensuring accuracy for baking, snacking, or meal prep. Whether you're making raisin-studded cookies or a savoury dish, knowing the weight helps achieve consistent results. For more air fryer conversions, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on precise ingredient ratios for even cooking and perfect texture. Using 2 cups of raisins without knowing the weight can lead to overly dense or dry results. Raisins absorb moisture, so their weight affects baking times and ingredient balance. If you're prepping a <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert</a>, this conversion ensures your treats turn out just right. Always measure ingredients like raisins by weight for reliability.</p>  

<p>UK measurements can differ slightly from US standards, so it's best to use a kitchen scale. If you don't have one, our 10-ounce estimate for 2 cups of raisins is a safe bet. For more tips on air fryer accuracy, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a>.</p>  

<h3>Converting cups to ounces for raisins</h3>  
<p>Raisins vary in size and density, but 2 cups typically equal 10 ounces. Packed raisins may weigh slightly more, while loosely filled cups could be less. For best results, lightly spoon raisins into the measuring cup without pressing down. If precision is key, weigh them for exact amounts, especially in <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>cake recipes</a>.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for 2 cups of raisins in air fryer recipes</h2>  
<p>From oatmeal cookies to savoury rice dishes, raisins add sweetness and texture. Two cups (10 ounces) work perfectly in batches of air-fried granola or stuffed apples. They’re also great in <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/breakfast>breakfast</a> recipes like cinnamon raisin toast cups. Since air fryers cook quickly, evenly distributed raisins ensure balanced flavour in every bite.</p>  

<p>For savoury dishes, 2 cups of raisins can balance spices in Moroccan-inspired lamb or chicken. Their natural sugars caramelise slightly in the air fryer, enhancing depth. If you're meal prepping, portion out 10-ounce batches for easy use. Need cleaning tips?

<h3>Tips for measuring raisins without a scale</h3>  
<p>If you lack a scale, fluff the raisins before lightly filling the cup. Avoid tapping the cup, as this compacts them and skews the weight. For sticky raisins, a light coating of oil on the measuring cup helps them slide out cleanly. Remember, 2 cups of raisins to ounces is roughly 10, but slight variations won’t ruin most recipes.</p>

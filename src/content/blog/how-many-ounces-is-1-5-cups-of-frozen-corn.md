<p>1.5 cups of frozen corn equals approximately 7.5 ounces (or 213 grams). This measurement is essential for air fryer recipes, ensuring precise portions and consistent cooking results. Whether you're prepping a side dish or adding corn to a main meal, knowing the weight helps avoid over or under-seasoning.

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on even heat distribution, so using the right amount of ingredients ensures everything cooks uniformly. Too much frozen corn can lead to steaming instead of crisping, while too little might burn. Measuring by weight (ounces) is more reliable than volume (cups) because frozen corn can vary in density. If you're new to air frying, browse our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> for inspiration.</p>  

<h3>How to measure 1.5 cups of frozen corn</h3>  
<p>Use a dry measuring cup for frozen corn, lightly packing it without crushing the kernels. For the most accurate ounce conversion, a kitchen scale is ideal. If you don’t have one, remember that 1 cup of frozen corn is roughly 5 ounces, so 1.5 cups would be 7.5 ounces. This method works for most <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable-based recipes</a>.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for 1.5 cups of frozen corn</h2>  
<p>This portion is perfect for air fryer fritters, cornbread, or as a side dish. Frozen corn retains nutrients and cooks quickly in the air fryer—just toss with a bit of oil and seasonings. For meal prep, divide 1.5 cups (7.5 oz) into portions for balanced <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/meal-prep>meal prep ideas</a>.</p>  

<h3>Adjusting recipes for different serving sizes</h3>  
<p>If your recipe calls for 3 cups of frozen corn (15 oz), simply double the measurement. For smaller batches, halve it to 0.75 cups (3.75 oz). Always preheat your air fryer for even cooking, and shake the basket halfway through. Need cleaning tips?

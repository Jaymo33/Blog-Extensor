<p>100 grams of butter is roughly equivalent to 0.44 cups (or just under half a cup) in both UK and US measurements. This conversion is essential for baking and air frying, where precision can make or break a recipe. Whether you're whipping up cakes or crisping potatoes, knowing how to measure butter correctly ensures consistent results every time.</p>

<h2>Understanding Butter Measurements</h2>
<p>Butter is often measured in grams or cups, depending on the recipe. For those using an air fryer, accurate measurements are crucial to avoid overly greasy or dry dishes. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we emphasise the importance of precise conversions, especially for air-fried desserts like cookies or cakes. A slight mismeasurement can affect texture and taste, so it’s worth getting it right.</p>
<p>In the UK, butter is typically sold in 250g blocks, making it easy to divide into 100g portions. However, if your recipe calls for cups, knowing that 100g equals roughly 0.44 cups simplifies the process. For air frying, this is particularly useful when preparing buttery coatings or sauces for dishes like crispy chicken or roasted vegetables.</p>

<h2>UK vs. US Cup Measurements</h2>
<p>While the difference between UK and US cups is minimal for butter, it’s worth noting that 1 UK cup equals 250ml, whereas 1 US cup is 240ml. This slight variance won’t drastically alter your air fryer recipes, but for precision, sticking to grams is often better. If you’re working from an American recipe, 100 grams of butter converts to just under half a US cup (0.44 cups).</p>
<p>For those who love baking in their air fryer, like making <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>air fryer cakes</a>, this conversion ensures your batter isn’t too dense or runny. Butter’s role in binding ingredients means accuracy is key. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a> for other common baking measurements.</p>

<h3>How to Measure 100 Grams of Butter Without Scales</h3>
<p>If you don’t have scales, you can still measure 100 grams of butter using the markings on the wrapper. Most UK butter blocks have tablespoon indicators, where 100g is roughly 7 tablespoons. Alternatively, fill a measuring cup to just under half for 0.44 cups. This method works well for air frying, whether you’re melting butter for cornbread or brushing it onto garlic bread.</p>

<h2>Common Recipes Using 100 Grams of Butter</h2>
<p>Many air fryer recipes call for 100 grams of butter, from savoury dishes like garlic prawns to sweet treats like shortbread. For example, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer cookie recipe</a> uses this amount for perfect chewiness. Butter’s richness enhances flavour and texture, making it a staple in air frying and baking alike.</p>
<p>Another favourite is buttery air-fried potatoes, where 100 grams of butter coats the spuds evenly for crispy perfection. Whether you’re making a batch of <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/potatoes>roasted potatoes</a> or a buttery cake, knowing this conversion ensures success. Keep your air fryer clean with our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning guide</a> to maintain peak performance.</p>

<h3>Why Accuracy Matters in Air Frying</h3>
<p>Air fryers circulate hot air, so too much butter can lead to smoking or uneven cooking. Measuring 100 grams of butter correctly prevents greasy results. For dishes like air-fried fish or pastries, precision ensures a golden, crispy finish without excess oil.</p>

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on even cooking, and incorrect measurements can throw off your recipe. Too much molasses can make dishes overly sweet or sticky, while too little might leave them bland.

<p>Molasses also affects texture, so measuring by weight (ounces) is often more reliable than volume (cups). A kitchen scale can help, but if you don’t have one, our conversion guide is a lifesaver. Whether you’re prepping a batch of cookies or a savoury glaze, 2.5 cups of molasses to ounces is a conversion you’ll use often.

<p>2 cups of lemon juice equals approximately 16 fluid ounces (or 16 oz). This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes, ensuring your dishes have the perfect balance of tangy flavour. Whether you're marinating chicken or baking a lemon drizzle cake, accurate measurements make all the difference. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we know precision is key to delicious results. Keep reading for more tips on measuring lemon juice and other ingredients.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of lemon juice can elevate your air fryer dishes from good to great. Too much can overpower, while too little might leave your meal lacking zest. For example, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>lemon herb chicken</a> relies on precisely 16 oz (2 cups) of lemon juice for the marinade. Air fryers cook quickly, so balanced flavours are crucial. Measuring correctly ensures consistency, whether you're cooking for one or meal prepping for the week. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a> for other common ingredient swaps.</p>  

<h3>Lemon Juice vs. Other Liquids: Weight vs. Volume</h3>  
<p>Unlike water, lemon juice has a slightly different density, but for most recipes, the 1 cup = 8 oz rule applies. If you're using bottled lemon juice, check the label for exact ounces per cup. Freshly squeezed lemon juice may vary slightly, but 2 cups will still hover around 16 oz. For more tips on measuring liquids, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert recipes</a>, where precision is everything.</p>  

<h2>How to Measure Lemon Juice Without a Measuring Cup</h2>  
<p>No measuring cup? No problem! A standard UK fluid ounce is about 28.4 ml, so 16 oz of lemon juice equals roughly 454 ml. Use a kitchen scale set to ounces for weight-based accuracy. Alternatively, 2 cups of lemon juice fill a pint glass to the brim. For sticky situations, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning guide</a> helps tackle spills quickly. Remember, air fryer recipes often need less liquid than oven ones due to faster cooking times.</p>  

<h3>Converting Lemon Juice for Different Recipes</h3>  
<p>If a recipe calls for 2 cups of lemon juice in ounces (16 oz), but you only have a 12 oz bottle, you’ll need 1.5 cups. Adjust other ingredients accordingly to maintain flavour balance. For <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken dishes</a>, a 16 oz marinade typically covers 4-6 portions. Always taste-test before cooking—especially with citrus-heavy recipes.</p>

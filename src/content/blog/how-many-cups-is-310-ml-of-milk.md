<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on even heat distribution, so incorrect measurements can lead to uneven cooking. For example, using too much milk in a batter might make it too runny, affecting texture. Too little could dry out your dish. Recipes like those in our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipe collection</a> often require precise liquid measurements for the best results.</p>  

<p>Converting 310 ml of milk to cups is straightforward once you know the standard conversions. In the UK, 1 cup equals 250 ml, while in the US, it's 240 ml. This means 310 ml translates to just over 1 1/4 cups in the UK and slightly less in the US. Always check your recipe's origin to avoid confusion.</p>  

<h2>How to Measure 310 ml of Milk Without a Scale</h2>  
<p>If you don't have a measuring jug, you can use a standard cup to measure 310 ml of milk. Fill the cup to the 250 ml mark (UK) or 240 ml (US), then add an extra tablespoon or two to reach 310 ml. For baking recipes, like those in our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>cake category</a>, accuracy is key for the perfect rise.</p>

<p>1.75 cups of gram flour equals approximately 7.4 ounces (oz). This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes, where precise measurements can make or break your dish. Whether you're making pakoras, gluten-free bread, or crispy coatings, knowing the exact weight ensures consistent results. Gram flour, also known as besan, is a staple in many cuisines, and getting the measurements right is key.

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on even cooking, and incorrect measurements can lead to uneven textures or undercooked food. Gram flour is particularly tricky because its density can vary slightly depending on how it’s packed. Measuring by weight (ounces) is far more reliable than volume (cups) for consistent results. If you’re serious about air frying, investing in a kitchen scale is a game-changer. You’ll find plenty of recipes that use gram flour on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>our recipes page</a>.</p>  

<p>Many UK cooks prefer using ounces for baking and frying, as it’s a more precise system. Converting 1.75 cups of gram flour to ounces ensures you’re following recipes correctly, especially when adapting them for air fryers. Whether you’re making onion bhajis or gluten-free muffins, accuracy is key. If you’re new to air frying, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning guide</a> will help keep your appliance in top condition.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure Gram Flour Correctly</h3>  
<p>To measure 1.75 cups of gram flour accurately, fluff the flour first with a spoon to loosen it. Then, lightly spoon it into a measuring cup and level it off with a knife. Avoid packing the flour down, as this can lead to an incorrect weight. For the most precise results, use a digital scale set to ounces. This method is especially useful for air fryer recipes, where even small discrepancies can affect cooking times.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for Gram Flour in Air Fryers</h2>  
<p>Gram flour is incredibly versatile in air fryer cooking. It’s perfect for creating crispy coatings on vegetables, chicken, or fish. You can also use it to make gluten-free batters for pakoras or falafel. Many Indian-inspired air fryer recipes rely on gram flour for its nutty flavour and binding properties. If you love experimenting, try our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable recipes</a> that use gram flour for extra crunch.</p>  

<p>Another great use for gram flour is in making air-fried snacks like chakli or sev. These traditional Indian treats turn out wonderfully crisp in the air fryer. Since 1.75 cups of gram flour equals 7.4 ounces, you can easily scale recipes up or down. For more inspiration, browse our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert section</a>, where gram flour is often used in sweet dishes too.</p>  

<h3>Tips for Storing Gram Flour</h3>  
<p>Since gram flour can absorb moisture, store it in an airtight container in a cool, dry place. This ensures it stays fresh and maintains its weight consistency. If you notice any clumping, sift the flour before measuring to guarantee accuracy. Proper storage means your 1.75 cups of gram flour will always weigh the correct 7.4 ounces when you need it.</p>

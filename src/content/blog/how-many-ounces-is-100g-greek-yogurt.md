<p>100g of Greek yogurt equals approximately 3.53 ounces. This conversion is essential for anyone using air fryer recipes that require precise measurements, especially when following British or international cooking guides. Whether you're meal prepping or whipping up a quick breakfast, knowing how to convert grams to ounces ensures your dishes turn out perfectly.</p>

<h2>Why Convert 100g of Greek Yogurt to Ounces?</h2>  
<p>Many air fryer recipes, especially those from the UK or Europe, list ingredients in grams. If your kitchen scale measures in ounces, converting 100g of Greek yogurt to ounces (3.53 oz) helps you stay accurate. This is particularly useful for baking or making sauces where proportions matter. For more air fryer measurement tips, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>  

<p>Greek yogurt is a staple in healthy cooking, often used in marinades, dips, or even as a substitute for heavier creams. Whether you're making a <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken marinade</a> or a creamy dessert, knowing the exact weight ensures consistency. Plus, air fryers excel at cooking with yogurt-based coatings, so precise measurements matter.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure 100g of Greek Yogurt Without a Scale</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a scale, 100g of Greek yogurt is roughly 6 tablespoons or just under half a standard UK cup (200ml). However, weighing is always more accurate, especially for air fryer recipes where even small deviations can affect texture. For more tips on measuring ingredients, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a>.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for 100g of Greek Yogurt in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Greek yogurt’s thick texture makes it ideal for air fryer recipes. A 100g portion (3.53 oz) can be used to coat chicken wings, create creamy dips, or even as a base for healthier desserts. Its high protein content also makes it a favourite for fitness-focused meals.</p>  

<p>For example, try mixing 100g of Greek yogurt with herbs and spices for a tangy marinade. Air-fried <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetables</a> tossed in this mix come out crispy and flavourful. Or, use it in place of mayo for a lighter twist on classic recipes. The possibilities are endless!</p>  

<h3>Does Greek Yogurt Weight Change When Cooked?</h3>  
<p>Unlike meats or vegetables, Greek yogurt doesn’t lose significant weight when cooked in an air fryer. However, it may thicken further due to moisture evaporation. Always measure 100g (3.53 oz) before cooking for best results. For cleaning tips after cooking with yogurt, see our guide on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer maintenance</a>.</p>

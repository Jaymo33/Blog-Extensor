<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>When cooking or baking, especially in an air fryer, precise measurements can make or break a dish. Too much or too little milk can affect moisture levels, browning, and even cooking time. For example, a cake batter with too much milk might turn out soggy, while too little could make it dry. That’s why converting 2.5 cups of milk to grams (600g) is so helpful—it removes guesswork. Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> for dishes where exact measurements shine.</p>  

<p>Air fryers heat food quickly, so ingredient ratios matter more than in traditional ovens. A slight variation in milk quantity could alter the texture of your dish significantly. Whether you’re making pancakes, custards, or even bread, knowing that 2.5 cups of milk equals 600 grams ensures reliability.

<h2>Converting Cups to Grams for Milk</h2>  
<p>Milk’s density means 1 cup typically weighs around 240 grams, so 2.5 cups equal 600 grams. However, factors like fat content (whole vs. skim) can cause slight variations. For most recipes, especially those using an air fryer, 600 grams is a safe bet. If precision is critical, weighing your milk with a kitchen scale is best. Need more conversion help?

<h3>Does Milk Type Affect the Weight?</h3>  
<p>Whole milk, skim milk, and plant-based alternatives have slightly different densities, but the difference is minimal for most recipes. For example, almond milk might weigh a few grams less per cup, but 2.5 cups will still hover around 600 grams. Unless a recipe specifies otherwise, standard cow’s milk measurements apply.

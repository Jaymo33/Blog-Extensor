<p>185°C in a fan oven equals approximately 160°C in a conventional oven. This conversion is essential for adapting recipes between different oven types, especially when using an air fryer which often follows fan oven principles. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we know precise temperature conversion makes all the difference in cooking results.</p>

<h2>Understanding Fan Oven vs Conventional Oven</h2>
<p>Fan ovens circulate hot air using a built-in fan, cooking food faster and more evenly than conventional ovens. This means you typically need to reduce the temperature by 20°C when converting from fan to conventional. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> shows this relationship clearly for various temperatures. The 185 fan oven to conventional oven conversion is particularly useful for baking delicate items like cakes or pastries.</p>
<p>Many modern recipes specify fan oven temperatures, leaving home cooks to figure out conventional oven equivalents. When you see 185°C in a fan-assisted recipe, remember it's about 160°C in a traditional oven. This knowledge becomes even more valuable when using an air fryer, as most models operate similarly to fan ovens. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/Cakes>cake recipes</a> adapted for perfect air fryer results.</p>

<h3>Why 185°C Fan is a Popular Baking Temperature</h3>
<p>185°C fan (160°C conventional) hits the sweet spot for many baked goods. It's hot enough to create good browning without burning, while allowing even cooking throughout. This temperature works beautifully for Victoria sponges, cookies, and even some <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/Vegetables>roasted vegetables</a> in an air fryer. The circulating air in fan ovens and air fryers means you can often reduce cooking times slightly compared to conventional ovens.</p>

<h2>Converting 185 Fan Oven for Air Fryer Use</h2>
<p>Air fryers essentially work like compact fan ovens, making temperature conversion straightforward. If a recipe calls for 185°C in a fan oven, you can use the same temperature in your air fryer. However, cooking times may be shorter due to the air fryer's efficient air circulation. Our testing at <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> shows most foods cook 20% faster in air fryers compared to fan ovens.</p>
<p>When adapting conventional oven recipes for air fryer use, remember the 185 fan oven to conventional oven conversion works in reverse too. A conventional oven recipe at 160°C becomes 185°C in both fan ovens and air fryers. This principle applies to everything from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/Chicken>chicken dishes</a> to baked goods. Just keep an eye on cooking times and consider reducing them slightly for air fryer use.</p>

<h3>Common Mistakes in Oven Temperature Conversion</h3>
<p>The biggest error is forgetting that 185°C fan equals 160°C conventional, not the same temperature. Another pitfall is not adjusting cooking times - fan ovens and air fryers cook faster than conventional ovens. Always use an oven thermometer to verify your appliance's accuracy, as variations can affect results. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning guide</a> explains how proper maintenance helps maintain temperature accuracy.</p>

<p>610 ml of buttermilk is approximately 2.57 cups. This conversion is essential for baking and cooking, especially when using an air fryer for recipes that require precise measurements. Whether you're making fluffy pancakes or tender fried chicken, knowing how to convert millilitres to cups ensures your dishes turn out perfectly every time.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Buttermilk Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Buttermilk plays a crucial role in recipes, adding moisture, tanginess, and helping with leavening. Using the correct amount ensures your baked goods rise properly and your marinades work effectively. For air fryer recipes, like those on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, precise measurements can make the difference between crispy and soggy results. Too much buttermilk can lead to overly wet batter, while too little might leave your dish dry.</p>  

<p>When converting 610 ml of buttermilk to cups, it's important to note that UK and US cup measurements differ slightly. In the UK, 1 cup equals 284 ml, while in the US, it's 240 ml. For this guide, we're using the US measurement, which is more common in international recipes. Always check your recipe's origin to ensure accuracy.</p>  

<h2>How to Measure Buttermilk Correctly</h2>  
<p>Measuring buttermilk accurately is simple with the right tools. Use a liquid measuring cup for the most precise results, and fill it to the 610 ml mark. If you don't have a measuring cup, you can use a kitchen scale—610 ml of buttermilk weighs roughly 630 grams. For air fryer recipes, like those in the <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>cake category</a>, accuracy ensures even cooking and perfect texture.</p>  

<h3>Using Buttermilk in Air Fryer Recipes</h3>  
<p>Buttermilk is a star ingredient in many air fryer recipes, from fried chicken to scones. Its acidity helps tenderise meat and adds a delightful tang to baked goods. When converting 610 ml of buttermilk to cups for air fryer recipes, remember that consistency matters. If your batter seems too thick or thin, adjust slightly based on your air fryer's performance.</p>  

<h2>Common Recipes Using 610 ml of Buttermilk</h2>  
<p>Many recipes call for around 610 ml of buttermilk, making this conversion handy for home cooks. For example, a large batch of buttermilk pancakes or a family-sized portion of buttermilk-brined chicken might require this amount. Check out <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> for creative ways to use buttermilk in your air fryer, like fluffy doughnuts or crispy onion rings.</p>

Whether you're cooking for one or a crowd, knowing how to convert 610 ml of buttermilk to cups ensures consistent results every time.</p>  

<h3>Substitutes for Buttermilk</h3>  
<p>If you're out of buttermilk, you can make a substitute by adding 1 tablespoon of lemon juice or vinegar to 610 ml of milk. Let it sit for 5 minutes before using. This works well in most air fryer recipes, though the flavour may be slightly different.

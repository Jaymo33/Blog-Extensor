<p>Getting your weights right directly impacts how your food cooks in the air fryer. If you misjudge the conversion from 32.5 kg to pounds, you might overload the basket, leading to soggy results instead of that desired crispness.

By accurately converting 32.5 kg to pounds, you can portion ingredients appropriately for your specific model's capacity. This attention to detail separates okay air fryer meals from exceptional ones that keep you coming back for more.</p>
<p>Many air fryer recipes provide ingredient weights in both metric and imperial units, but not all do.

It also helps when you're adapting traditional oven recipes for the air fryer, as weights play a crucial role in adjusting cooking times and temperatures.

<p>5 grams of lime juice equals approximately 0.18 ounces. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements can make all the difference. Whether you're marinating chicken or adding a zesty twist to desserts, knowing how to convert grams to ounces ensures perfect results every time. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we help you nail those tricky measurements for flawless cooking.</p>

<h2>Why convert 5g of lime juice to ounces?</h2>  
<p>Many UK recipes use grams, while others rely on ounces, making conversions a common kitchen task. Lime juice, often measured in small quantities, requires accuracy to balance flavours perfectly. Air fryer recipes, like those on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>our recipes page</a>, often need precise liquid measurements for marinades or glazes. Converting 5g lime juice to ounces (0.18 oz) ensures you don’t overpower or underwhelm your dish. It’s a small but crucial step for culinary success.</p>

<p>Using the correct amount of lime juice can elevate dishes like air-fried shrimp or citrus-glazed salmon. Too much can make food overly acidic, while too little might leave it bland. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> simplifies these calculations, so you spend less time measuring and more time cooking. Whether you’re prepping a quick marinade or baking a lime-infused dessert, precision matters.</p>

<h2>How to measure 5g of lime juice accurately</h2>  
<p>For small quantities like 5g of lime juice, a digital kitchen scale is your best friend. Set it to grams, squeeze fresh lime juice until the scale reads 5g, and you’re done. If you don’t have a scale, roughly 1 teaspoon of lime juice weighs close to 5g (0.18 oz). However, scales are more reliable, especially for air fryer recipes where consistency is key.</p>

<h3>Using measuring spoons for lime juice</h3>  
<p>While not as precise as scales, measuring spoons can work in a pinch. One level teaspoon holds about 5ml, which roughly equates to 5g for lime juice due to its similar density to water. For recipes on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert recipes</a>, this approximation is often sufficient. Just avoid over-pouring, as lime juice’s acidity can dominate delicate flavours.</p>

<h2>Common uses for 5g of lime juice in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>From marinades to dressings, 5g (0.18 oz) of lime juice adds a bright, tangy kick. Try it in a quick shrimp marinade with garlic and herbs before air frying for 8 minutes. Or drizzle it over air-fried veggies like peppers and courgettes for a fresh twist. Even desserts benefit—think lime-infused air fryer cakes or cookies.</p>

<p>For a simple hack, mix 5g lime juice with olive oil and spices to coat chicken wings before air frying. The acidity helps tenderise the meat while adding flavour. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipes</a> for more inspiration. Remember, precise measurements ensure balanced flavours, so keep that 5g-to-0.18-oz conversion handy.</p>

<h3>Storing leftover lime juice</h3>  
<p>If you’ve squeezed extra lime juice, store it in an airtight container in the fridge for up to a week. For longer storage, freeze it in ice cube trays—each cube holds about 15g (0.53 oz), so you can thaw just what you need. This trick saves waste and keeps your <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner</a> by reducing sticky, dried-on citrus residue.</p>

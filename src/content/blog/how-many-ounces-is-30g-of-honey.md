<p>30g of honey equals approximately 1.06 ounces. This conversion is essential for precise measurements in air fryer recipes, ensuring your dishes turn out perfectly every time. Whether you’re drizzling honey over roasted vegetables or using it as a glaze for chicken, knowing the exact weight in ounces helps maintain consistency. For more air fryer conversions, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate honey measurements matter</h2>  
<p>Honey is a sticky ingredient, and even small measurement errors can throw off the balance of your recipe. Too much honey can make dishes overly sweet or cause uneven cooking in the air fryer. Too little might leave your meal lacking flavour. By converting 30g of honey to ounces (1.06 oz), you can measure with confidence. This is especially useful for recipes like honey-glazed salmon or sticky chicken wings, where precision is key.</p>  
<p>For those who love baking in the air fryer, honey adds moisture and sweetness to cakes and cookies. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a> includes plenty of sweet treats that rely on accurate honey measurements. Whether you’re making a batch of honey cookies or a drizzle for desserts, knowing 30g equals 1.06 ounces ensures perfect results.</p>  

<h2>How to measure honey without scales</h2>  
<p>Not everyone has kitchen scales handy, but there are easy ways to measure 30g of honey (1.06 oz) without them. A standard tablespoon holds about 21g of honey, so 1.5 tablespoons will get you close to 30g. For a more precise method, use a measuring jug with fluid ounces—30g of honey is roughly 1.5 fluid ounces. Just remember, honey’s thickness means it won’t pour as easily as water.</p>  

<h3>Using honey in air fryer recipes</h3>  
<p>Honey works wonders in the air fryer, adding caramelisation and depth to dishes. Try brushing 30g (1.06 oz) of honey over chicken thighs before air frying for a sticky, golden finish. Or mix it with soy sauce for a quick glaze on salmon fillets. For more inspiration, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipes</a> featuring honey as a star ingredient.</p>  

<h2>Common honey conversions for air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Beyond 30g, here are other handy honey conversions: 15g is about 0.53 ounces, and 50g equals roughly 1.76 ounces. These measurements are useful for scaling recipes up or down. If you’re prepping a large batch of honey-glazed carrots or a family-sized dessert, these conversions ensure consistency. For more tips on air fryer meal prep, visit our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/meal-prep>meal prep section</a>.</p>  
<p>Storing honey correctly also matters. Keep it in a cool, dry place to prevent crystallisation. If your honey hardens, gently warm the jar in warm water to restore its pourable consistency. This makes measuring 30g (1.06 oz) much easier when you’re ready to cook.</p>  

<h3>Cleaning honey residue from your air fryer</h3>  
<p>Honey can leave sticky residue in your air fryer basket. To clean it, mix warm water with a drop of dish soap and let the basket soak. For stubborn spots, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner guide</a> has expert tips. Regular cleaning ensures your air fryer stays in top condition for perfect honey-glazed dishes every time.</p>

<p>3 tablespoons (tbsp) of ginger paste equals approximately 45 grams (g). This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements can make or break a dish. Whether you're marinating chicken or spicing up vegetables, knowing the exact weight ensures consistent results every time.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Ginger Paste Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of ginger paste is crucial for balancing flavours in your air fryer meals. Too little, and your dish might lack depth; too much, and it could become overpowering. For UK cooks, converting tablespoons to grams ensures accuracy, especially when following recipes from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> or other sources.</p>  

<p>Ginger paste is denser than fresh ginger, so volume measurements like tablespoons can vary. By converting 3 tbsp of ginger paste to grams, you eliminate guesswork. This is particularly helpful for air fryer cooking, where even heat distribution relies on properly portioned ingredients.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure Ginger Paste Correctly</h3>  
<p>For the most accurate conversion, use a digital kitchen scale. Scoop the ginger paste into a tablespoon measure, levelling it off with a knife, then weigh it. If you donâ€™t have scales, remember that 1 tbsp of ginger paste is roughly 15g, so 3 tbsp equals 45g. This method works well for recipes like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>air fryer chicken dishes</a> or marinades.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for Ginger Paste in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Ginger paste is a staple in many air fryer recipes, from Asian-inspired dishes to hearty British meals. It adds warmth and complexity to marinades, sauces, and even baked goods. For example, a <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a> can help you adjust recipes that call for fresh ginger to use paste instead.</p>  

<p>Try adding 3 tbsp (45g) of ginger paste to your next air fryer stir-fry or glaze. It pairs beautifully with soy sauce, garlic, and honey for a quick, flavourful meal. If you're prepping ahead, check out <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/meal-prep>meal prep ideas</a> to save time during busy weeks.</p>  

<h3>Substituting Fresh Ginger for Paste</h3>  
<p>If a recipe calls for fresh ginger but you only have paste, use 1 tbsp of paste for every 1-inch piece of fresh ginger. Since 3 tbsp of ginger paste is 45g, this substitution works well in most air fryer dishes. Just adjust other liquids slightly to account for the paste's moisture content.</p>  

<h2>Tips for Storing Ginger Paste</h2>  
<p>To keep ginger paste fresh, store it in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 3 weeks. You can also freeze it in ice cube trays for easy portioning. When you need 3 tbsp (45g), simply thaw the required amount. This trick is handy for frequent air fryer users who love <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable dishes</a> with a ginger kick.</p>  

<p>For longer storage, mix ginger paste with a bit of vinegar or oil before freezing. This prevents freezer burn and makes it easier to scoop out 45g portions when needed. Always label containers with dates to ensure freshness.</p>

<p>5 grams of chopped onion equals approximately 0.18 ounces. This conversion is handy for air fryer recipes where precise measurements matter. Whether you're making crispy onion toppings or adding flavour to dishes, knowing the exact weight ensures consistency. For more air fryer tips, check out <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>.</p>

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air frying</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on even cooking, and ingredient weights play a big role. Too much or too little onion can affect texture and taste. For example, 5g of chopped onion (0.18 oz) is perfect for garnishing a single portion. If you're scaling up, multiply accordingly. Find more precise conversions on our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>  

<p>Chopped onion adds depth to dishes like air-fried chicken or roasted vegetables. Measuring 5g ensures you don’t overpower the dish. It’s also useful for tracking calories or sticking to dietary plans. For recipe ideas, browse our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a>.</p>  

<h3>How to measure 5g of chopped onion</h3>  
<p>Use a digital kitchen scale for the most accurate results. Place a small bowl on the scale, tare it to zero, then add onion until it reads 5g (0.18 oz). If you don’t have scales, a tightly packed teaspoon is roughly 5g. For more tips, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable recipes</a>.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for 5g of chopped onion</h2>  
<p>This small amount is ideal for seasoning or garnishing. Sprinkle it over air-fried potatoes or mix into burger patties. It’s also great for adding subtle flavour to sauces or dips. For inspiration, try our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/beef>beef recipes</a>.</p>  

<p>If you’re batch-cooking, multiply the 5g measurement as needed. For example, 20g (0.7 oz) of chopped onion suits a family-sized portion. Always store leftover onion in an airtight container to keep it fresh. Learn more about meal prep on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>.</p>  

<h3>Converting other onion measurements</h3>  
<p>Need larger quantities? 50g of chopped onion equals about 1.76 oz. For whole onions, one medium onion yields roughly 150g (5.3 oz) when chopped. Adjust recipes accordingly for best results in your air fryer.</p>

<p>No, you should not put a standard takeaway box in an air fryer. Most disposable containers are made from thin plastic or polystyrene that can melt at temperatures above 160°C, releasing toxic fumes and potentially damaging your appliance. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we always recommend transferring food to oven-safe dishes for safe reheating.</p>

<h2>Why Takeaway Boxes Are Unsafe in Air Fryers</h2>
<p>Standard takeaway containers pose three major risks in air fryers: melting, chemical leaching, and fire hazards. The intense circulating heat in air fryers often exceeds 180°C – far beyond what flimsy plastic can withstand. When testing popular containers, we found most began warping within 2 minutes at this temperature. Some budget containers even released visible smoke when subjected to air fryer conditions.</p>
<p>Beyond physical damage, there are health concerns. Many plastics contain BPA or phthalates that may migrate into food when heated. Our tests with common UK takeaway boxes showed chemical odours developing at just 150°C. For safer alternatives, check our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> using proper cookware.</p>

<h3>What Happens to Different Box Materials?</h3>
<p>Not all takeaway packaging behaves the same way. Thin plastic containers melt completely, while polystyrene often shrinks and releases styrene vapours. Even cardboard with plastic coatings can catch fire if exposed to direct heat elements. Some premium containers marked "microwave-safe" might withstand brief heating, but air fryers' concentrated heat makes them unsuitable.</p>

<h2>Safer Alternatives for Reheating Takeaways</h2>
<p>For worry-free reheating, transfer food to ceramic ramekins, ovenproof glass, or silicone containers designed for air fryers. These materials withstand temperatures up to 250°C without risk. Our team at <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> particularly recommends shallow ceramic dishes that allow proper air circulation around the food.</p>
<p>If you're reheating saucy dishes like curries, silicone muffin cups work brilliantly. For crispy items, a perforated metal basket gives better results than original packaging. Discover more container options in our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>accessories guide</a>.</p>

<h3>Special Cases: Foil Containers</h3>
<p>Aluminium takeaway trays are the exception – they can generally go in air fryers if they fit properly. Ensure the foil doesn't touch heating elements and isn't crumpled, which could block airflow. However, remove any plastic lids first, as these definitely aren't air fryer-safe.</p>

<h2>How to Reheat Takeaway Food Properly</h2>
<p>For optimal results, spread food evenly in an appropriate container and reheat at 160°C for 3-5 minutes. Stirring halfway prevents cold spots. Our tests show this method works perfectly for everything from Chinese noodles to Indian curries. Find specific timings in our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipe category</a> for popular takeaway dishes.</p>
<p>Some foods actually improve in the air fryer compared to their original state. Fried chicken regains its crispiness, while soggy chips become golden again. Just remember – always remove original packaging first. The few minutes it takes to transfer food could prevent a melted mess or worse.</p>

<h3>Cleaning After Accidental Use</h3>
<p>If you've accidentally put a takeaway box in your air fryer, unplug immediately and let it cool completely. Scrape off any melted plastic with a wooden utensil, then wipe with baking soda paste. For stubborn residues, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning guide</a> has step-by-step solutions.</p>

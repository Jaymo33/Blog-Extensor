<h2>Why accurate milk measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of milk can make or break your air fryer dish. Too little, and your batter might be too thick; too much, and it could become runny. For recipes like air fryer pancakes or cakes, 0.75 tbsp of milk (11.25 grams) ensures the perfect texture.

<h3>How to measure 0.75 tbsp of milk without scales</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a kitchen scale, you can still measure 0.75 tbsp of milk accurately. Use a standard tablespoon and fill it three-quarters full. For even more precision, consider using a measuring jug with millilitre markings, as 0.75 tbsp is roughly 11.1 ml. This method works well for recipes like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>air fryer cakes</a> or custards.</p>

<h3>How to measure 75g of cooked rice without scales</h3>  
<p>If you don't have kitchen scales, you can estimate 75g of cooked rice using household items. A heaped tablespoon of cooked rice is roughly 15g, so five tablespoons equal approximately 75g. Alternatively, a packed 1/3 cup measure will give you close to 75g. Remember, these are estimates—for precision, scales are best.</p>  

<h2>Tips for cooking rice in your air fryer</h2>  
<p>Cooking rice in an air fryer is quicker than traditional methods and yields fluffy results. Start by rinsing your rice to remove excess starch, then add it to an oven-safe dish with water. Cover tightly with foil to trap steam, and cook at 180°C for 15-20 minutes. For more tips, visit our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>homepage</a>.</p>  

<p>Leftover rice works brilliantly in the air fryer for crispy textures. Spread 75g (2.65 oz) of cooked rice thinly on a liner for even crisping. This method is perfect for making rice crackers or reheating fried rice. Don't forget to clean your air fryer afterward—our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning guide</a> makes it easy.</p>  

<h3>Common mistakes when weighing cooked rice</h3>  
<p>One mistake is weighing rice while it's hot, which can affect accuracy due to steam. Always let rice cool slightly before measuring 75g for precise results. Another error is packing rice too tightly into measuring cups, which leads to overestimating portions. For consistent results, fluff rice with a fork before measuring.</p>

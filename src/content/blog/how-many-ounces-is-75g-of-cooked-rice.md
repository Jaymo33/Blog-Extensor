<p>75g of cooked rice equals approximately 2.65 ounces. This conversion is essential for air fryer cooking, where precise measurements can make all the difference. Whether you're meal prepping or following a recipe, knowing how to convert grams to ounces ensures consistent results. For more handy conversions, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>

<h2>Why converting 75g of cooked rice to ounces matters</h2>  
<p>Accurate measurements are key to perfect air fryer dishes, especially when working with rice. Converting 75g of cooked rice to ounces (2.65 oz) helps you portion meals correctly and avoid waste. This is particularly useful for meal prep or when scaling recipes up or down. If you're new to air frying, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipes section</a> has plenty of inspiration to get you started.</p>  

<p>Rice is a staple in many air fryer meals, from crispy rice cakes to stuffed peppers. Knowing the weight in both grams and ounces ensures you can follow any recipe with confidence. Whether you're using basmati, jasmine, or brown rice, the conversion remains the same. For more rice-based dishes, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable recipes</a> that pair perfectly with rice.</p>  

<h3>How to measure 75g of cooked rice without scales</h3>  
<p>If you don't have kitchen scales, you can estimate 75g of cooked rice using household items. A heaped tablespoon of cooked rice is roughly 15g, so five tablespoons equal approximately 75g. Alternatively, a packed 1/3 cup measure will give you close to 75g. Remember, these are estimates—for precision, scales are best.</p>  

<h2>Tips for cooking rice in your air fryer</h2>  
<p>Cooking rice in an air fryer is quicker than traditional methods and yields fluffy results. Start by rinsing your rice to remove excess starch, then add it to an oven-safe dish with water. Cover tightly with foil to trap steam, and cook at 180°C for 15-20 minutes. For more tips, visit our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>homepage</a>.</p>  

<p>Leftover rice works brilliantly in the air fryer for crispy textures. Spread 75g (2.65 oz) of cooked rice thinly on a liner for even crisping. This method is perfect for making rice crackers or reheating fried rice. Don't forget to clean your air fryer afterward—our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning guide</a> makes it easy.</p>  

<h3>Common mistakes when weighing cooked rice</h3>  
<p>One mistake is weighing rice while it's hot, which can affect accuracy due to steam. Always let rice cool slightly before measuring 75g for precise results. Another error is packing rice too tightly into measuring cups, which leads to overestimating portions. For consistent results, fluff rice with a fork before measuring.</p>

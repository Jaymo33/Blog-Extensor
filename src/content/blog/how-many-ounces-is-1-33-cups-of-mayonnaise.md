<p>1.33 cups of mayonnaise equals approximately 10.64 ounces. This conversion is essential for precise measurements, especially when preparing air fryer recipes where accuracy matters. Whether you're making a creamy dip or a rich sauce, knowing the exact weight ensures perfect results every time.</p>

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>
<p>Air fryers rely on precise ingredient ratios to achieve the best texture and flavour. Using too much or too little mayonnaise can affect the consistency of your dish. For example, a sauce might become too thick or too runny if the measurements are off. That’s why converting cups to ounces is so helpful.</p>
<p>If you’re new to air fryer cooking, you might find our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> incredibly useful. It covers common conversions for liquids, solids, and even spices. This way, you can focus on creating delicious meals without second-guessing your measurements.</p>

<h2>How to measure mayonnaise accurately</h2>
<p>Measuring mayonnaise can be tricky because of its thick, sticky consistency. To get the most accurate 1.33 cups, use a liquid measuring cup and level it off with a spatula. Alternatively, a kitchen scale will give you the exact 10.64 ounces without any guesswork.</p>
<p>For those who love experimenting with recipes, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipes section</a> offers plenty of inspiration. From crispy chicken to decadent desserts, precise measurements are the key to success. And don’t forget to check out our tips for cleaning your air fryer after cooking with mayonnaise—it can get messy!</p>

<h3>Common uses for 1.33 cups of mayonnaise in air fryer recipes</h3>
<p>This amount is perfect for making creamy coatings or dips. For instance, you might use it to bind breadcrumbs for crispy chicken tenders or mix it with herbs for a flavourful aioli. The possibilities are endless, and with 10.64 ounces, you’ll have just the right amount for most recipes.</p>

<h2>Converting other mayonnaise amounts</h2>
<p>If you need to convert different quantities, here’s a quick reference: 1 cup of mayonnaise is roughly 8 ounces, so 1.33 cups is 10.64 ounces. This makes scaling recipes up or down a breeze. Whether you’re cooking for one or a crowd, these conversions ensure consistency.</p>

<h3>Tips for storing mayonnaise-based dishes</h3>

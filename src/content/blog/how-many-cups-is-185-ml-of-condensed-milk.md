<p>185 ml of condensed milk is approximately 0.78 cups (just under ¾ cup). This conversion is essential for baking and cooking, especially when using an air fryer for recipes that require precise measurements. Whether you're making a creamy dessert or a rich sauce, knowing how to convert 185 ml of condensed milk to cups ensures consistent results every time.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurement Matters</h2>  
<p>Condensed milk is a staple in many recipes, from cakes to custards, and its thickness means even small measurement errors can affect texture and taste. When using an air fryer, precise measurements are even more critical due to the appliance's rapid cooking process. Too much condensed milk can make dishes overly sweet or soggy, while too little may leave them dry. For perfect results, always measure carefully.</p>  

<p>If you're working with air fryer recipes, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for other common ingredient conversions. This handy tool helps you adjust measurements effortlessly, whether you're scaling up or down. For more inspiration, browse our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>dessert recipes</a> that use condensed milk for delicious treats.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure 185 ml of Condensed Milk</h3>  
<p>Using a liquid measuring cup is the easiest way to measure 185 ml of condensed milk. Fill the cup to the 185 ml mark, ensuring the milk sits level for accuracy. If you don’t have a metric measuring cup, use the conversion of 0.78 cups (or ¾ cup minus 1 teaspoon) as a close approximation. For sticky ingredients like condensed milk, lightly greasing the measuring cup can help it slide out easily.</p>  

<h2>Converting 185 ml of Condensed Milk in Different Regions</h2>  
<p>In the UK and USA, cup measurements can vary slightly, but the standard metric conversion remains consistent. 185 ml of condensed milk equals roughly 0.78 cups in both regions, making it easy to follow international recipes. If you're using a US recipe in the UK (or vice versa), this conversion ensures you won’t go wrong.

<p>When working with condensed milk in an air fryer, remember that its high sugar content can cause quicker browning. Adjust cooking times slightly to prevent burning, especially for recipes like flans or caramel puddings. Keeping your air fryer clean is also crucial—check our guide on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaning</a> to maintain optimal performance.</p>

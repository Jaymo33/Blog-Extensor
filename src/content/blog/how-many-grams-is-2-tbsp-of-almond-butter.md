<p>2 tablespoons (tbsp) of almond butter weigh approximately 32 grams. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precision matters, whether you’re baking, cooking, or meal prepping. Almond butter’s density can vary slightly, but 32 grams is the standard measurement for 2 tbsp in the UK. If you’re using an air fryer, getting this right ensures your dishes turn out perfectly every time.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on precise ingredient ratios to deliver crispy, evenly cooked results. Almond butter, often used in sauces, dressings, or baked goods, needs accurate measuring to avoid overly dense or dry outcomes. A slight variation in grams can affect texture and flavour, especially in recipes like almond butter cookies or energy bites. For more air fryer tips, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> to simplify your cooking process.</p>  

<p>Many air fryer recipes, such as granola or protein bars, call for almond butter as a binding agent. Knowing that 2 tbsp equals 32 grams helps streamline your prep work. If you’re experimenting with homemade almond butter sauces for chicken or vegetables, this measurement ensures consistency. Visit our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipes section</a> for inspiration on how to use almond butter in your air fryer creations.</p>  

<h3>How to measure almond butter without scales</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a kitchen scale, use levelled tablespoons for accuracy. Scoop almond butter into the spoon and level it off with a knife to ensure you’re getting the full 16 grams per tbsp. Sticky ingredients like almond butter can be tricky, so lightly greasing the spoon helps it slide off cleanly. This method is handy for quick conversions when you’re mid-recipe.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for almond butter in air fryer recipes</h2>  
<p>Almond butter is a versatile ingredient in air fryer cooking. From marinades to desserts, its rich, nutty flavour enhances both sweet and savoury dishes. Try it in almond-crusted chicken or as a base for satay sauce—just remember 2 tbsp equals 32 grams for perfect consistency.

<p>For breakfast, almond butter pairs well with air-fried bananas or oatmeal bars. Measuring 2 tbsp (32 grams) ensures your breakfast bakes hold together without being too heavy. If you’re meal prepping, accurate portions help with calorie tracking and portion control.

<h3>Does almond butter brand affect the weight?</h3>  
<p>While most almond butters weigh around 16 grams per tbsp, some brands may be denser or oilier. Natural almond butter often separates, so stirring it well before measuring ensures consistency. If you’re using a new brand, check the label for serving sizes—some list grams per tablespoon for clarity.

<h2>How to Measure Blueberries Correctly</h2>  
<p>For the most accurate measurement, use a kitchen scale. Scoop the blueberries into a measuring cup without packing them down, then weigh them. If you don’t have a scale, fluff the berries lightly in the cup to avoid overpacking. This method helps prevent discrepancies, especially when following precise recipes like those on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>.</p>  

<h3>Fresh vs. Frozen Blueberries</h3>

If your recipe calls for fresh blueberries but you’re using frozen, consider reducing other liquids slightly. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert recipes</a> account for these nuances, so you’ll always get the best results.</p>

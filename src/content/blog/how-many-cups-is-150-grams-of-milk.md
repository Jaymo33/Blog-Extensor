<p>150 grams of milk equals approximately 0.63 cups (just over half a cup) in standard UK measurements. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precision matters, whether you're making cakes, batters, or creamy sauces. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we know how frustrating inaccurate measurements can be – that’s why we break it down clearly.</p>

<h2>Why 150 Grams of Milk Matters in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>
<p>Getting the right amount of liquid is crucial in air fryer recipes, as excess moisture can affect texture and cooking times. When a recipe calls for 150 grams of milk, it’s often for balanced consistency in dishes like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>air fryer cakes</a> or breaded coatings. Unlike oven baking, air fryers circulate hot air rapidly, so precise measurements prevent sogginess or dryness. Many of our readers at <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> swear by weighing ingredients for reliability.</p>
<p>For context, 150 grams of milk in cups translates to roughly 5.3 fluid ounces. This measurement is particularly useful when scaling recipes up or down. If you’re adapting a family-sized <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer pancake recipe</a> to serve one, knowing that 150g milk equals 0.63 cups helps maintain ratios. Always use fresh, full-fat milk unless specified – skimmed milk weighs slightly differently due to lower fat content.</p>

<h3>UK vs US Cup Measurements for 150 Grams of Milk</h3>
<p>Note that a UK cup (284ml) differs slightly from a US cup (240ml). While 150 grams of milk is 0.63 UK cups, it’s approximately 0.64 US cups. This minor variance won’t drastically impact most air fryer recipes, but for baking, stick to one measurement system. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> covers these nuances in detail.</p>

<h2>How to Measure 150 Grams of Milk Without Scales</h2>
<p>If you don’t have digital scales, use the displacement method: fill a liquid measuring cup to the 0.63 cup mark (or just over half a cup) for 150 grams of milk. For thicker mixtures like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>air fryer custards</a>, gently level the milk with a knife. Remember that milk expands when frothed, so measure it cold for accuracy. After cooking, always <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>clean your air fryer basket</a> to prevent milk residues from burning.</p>
<p>Standard metric measuring jugs often have both cup and millilitre markings, making conversions easier. For 150 grams of milk, look for the 150ml line – since milk’s density is close to water, grams and millilitres are nearly equivalent. This trick works for most dairy products in air fryer recipes, though cream or buttermilk may vary slightly.</p>

<h3>Common Recipes Using 150 Grams of Milk</h3>
<p>This quantity appears frequently in small-batch air fryer Yorkshire puddings, béchamel sauces, or muffin batters. When a recipe specifies 150 grams of milk in cups, it’s often to achieve a pourable but not runny consistency. For best results, let refrigerated milk reach room temperature before measuring – cold milk can be denser.</p>

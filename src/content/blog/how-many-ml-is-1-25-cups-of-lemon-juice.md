<p>1.25 cups of lemon juice equals approximately 295.74 ml. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precision ensures the best results. Whether you're making a zesty marinade or a tangy glaze, knowing the exact measurement helps avoid over or under-seasoning. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we focus on making conversions simple so your dishes turn out perfectly every time.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of lemon juice can make or break a dish. Too much can overpower flavours, while too little might leave your meal tasting bland. The air fryer’s intense heat means liquids evaporate faster, so precise measurements prevent dryness or sogginess. For example, a marinade with 1.25 cups of lemon juice (295.74 ml) should coat chicken evenly without making it too acidic. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more handy tips.</p>  

<p>Recipes from different countries often use varying measurements, which can be confusing. If a recipe calls for 1.25 cups of lemon juice, knowing it’s roughly 295.74 ml helps avoid mistakes. This is especially useful when adapting American recipes, which frequently use cups. For more air fryer-friendly recipes, browse our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a>.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure Lemon Juice Correctly</h3>  
<p>For the most accurate conversion of 1.25 cups of lemon juice to ml, use a liquid measuring cup. Fill it to the 1.25-cup mark, then pour into a metric measuring jug to confirm it’s 295.74 ml. Freshly squeezed lemon juice may vary slightly in volume due to pulp, so straining ensures consistency. If you’re using bottled juice, shake well before measuring.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for 1.25 Cups of Lemon Juice</h2>  
<p>This quantity is perfect for marinades, dressings, or glazes in air fryer cooking. A marinade with 295.74 ml of lemon juice tenderises chicken or fish beautifully. You could also use it in desserts, like lemon drizzle cake adapted for the air fryer.

<p>Lemon juice also works wonders for deglazing pans or adding brightness to roasted vegetables. If you’re reheating leftovers in the air fryer, a splash of lemon juice (from your pre-measured 295.74 ml) can revive flavours. Need cleaning tips? Our guide on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer maintenance</a> keeps your appliance in top shape.</p>  

<h3>Converting Other Lemon Juice Quantities</h3>  
<p>If your recipe requires more or less than 1.25 cups, here’s a quick reference: 1 cup = 236.59 ml, so 0.5 cups = 118.29 ml. Doubling 1.25 cups (295.74 ml) gives 2.5 cups (591.47 ml). Keep these conversions handy for stress-free cooking.</p>

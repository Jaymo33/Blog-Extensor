Whether you’re making cakes, cookies, or desserts, knowing how to convert grams to ounces helps you follow recipes accurately. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we focus on making measurements simple for home cooks.</p>  

<h2>Why Convert 500g of Caster Sugar to Ounces?</h2>  
<p>Many UK recipes use grams, while others reference ounces, especially older or international cookbooks. Converting 500g of caster sugar to ounces (17.64 oz) ensures you use the right amount for air fryer recipes. This prevents over-sweetening or dry textures in baked goods. If you’re exploring our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer dessert recipes</a>, precise measurements are key.</p>  

<p>Air fryers heat quickly, so ingredient ratios matter more than in conventional ovens. Too much sugar can cause burning, while too little affects browning. For best results, use a digital scale or our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a> to double-check weights.</p>  

<h3>Tools for Accurate Measurement</h3>  
<p>A digital kitchen scale is the easiest way to measure 500g of caster sugar in ounces. Look for one with unit switching (grams/ounces) to avoid manual calculations. If you don’t have a scale, 500g roughly equals 2½ US cups, but weighing is more reliable for baking.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for 500g of Caster Sugar</h2>  
<p>Caster sugar is finer than granulated, dissolving quickly—ideal for air fryer cakes and meringues. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>air fryer cake recipes</a> often call for 500g to achieve light, fluffy textures. It’s also perfect for cookies, where even distribution matters.</p>

<h3>Storing Caster Sugar</h3>  
<p>Keep 500g of caster sugar in an airtight container to prevent clumping. Humidity can affect weight accuracy, so store it in a cool, dry place. If your sugar hardens, pulse it in a blender before measuring.</p>  

<h2>Conversion Tips for Air Fryer Baking</h2>

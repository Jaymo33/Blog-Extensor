<p>Yes, you can put certain oven-safe dishes in an air fryer, but with important caveats. The key factors are material composition, size, and temperature limits. At airfryerrecipe.co.uk, we always recommend checking manufacturer guidelines first.</p>

<h2>Understanding Oven Dish Materials for Air Fryers</h2>
<p>Not all oven dishes are created equal when it comes to air fryer compatibility. Ceramic and glass oven dishes often work if they fit properly, while plastic or melamine should never go in. Metal oven dishes are generally safe but may affect cooking times. For perfect results every time, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> to adjust recipes accordingly.</p>

<p>The intense, direct heat of an air fryer differs significantly from conventional oven cooking. This means even oven-safe dishes might behave differently. We've tested numerous dishes at airfryerrecipe.co.uk and found ceramic performs best for even heating. Always look for dishes specifically labeled as air fryer safe when possible.</p>

<h3>Size and Fit Considerations</h3>
<p>An oven dish that's too large can block airflow and cause uneven cooking. The ideal dish leaves at least an inch of space around all sides in your air fryer basket. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a> includes specific dish recommendations for each meal.</p>

<h2>Potential Risks of Using Oven Dishes</h2>
<p>The main danger comes from dishes not designed for rapid air circulation cooking. Some materials may crack under the intense heat, while others could melt or release harmful chemicals. We've seen cases where oven dishes damaged air fryer baskets or caused smoke issues.</p>

<p>Another risk involves temperature shock. Moving a cold oven dish directly into a hot air fryer can cause cracking. Always preheat dishes gradually if your air fryer model allows it. For cleaning up any mishaps, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner guide</a> has helpful tips.</p>

<h3>Best Practices for Safe Use</h3>
<p>Always start with lower temperatures when testing a new oven dish in your air fryer. Monitor closely for the first few minutes to check for any issues. Many of our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipes</a> work beautifully with oven dishes when following these precautions.</p>

<h2>Alternative Options to Oven Dishes</h2>
<p>If you're unsure about your oven dish, consider air fryer-specific accessories instead. Many brands offer baking pans and dishes designed specifically for air fryer use. These alternatives often provide better results and eliminate safety concerns.</p>

<p>For smaller portions, silicone molds or parchment paper liners can work well. We've found these especially useful for our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert recipes</a> that traditionally use oven dishes. The team at airfryerrecipe.co.uk tests all recommended alternatives thoroughly.</p>

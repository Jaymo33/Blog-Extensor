<p>1.5 cups of apple juice equals 12 fluid ounces (fl oz). This conversion is essential for precise cooking, especially when using an air fryer where measurements can impact texture and flavour. Whether you're making glazes, marinades, or baked goods, knowing the exact weight ensures consistent results every time.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on precise ingredient ratios to achieve the perfect crispiness and moisture balance. Using 1.5 cups of apple juice (12 fl oz) correctly can enhance dishes like glazed chicken or apple-infused desserts. Too much liquid can lead to soggy results, while too little may dry out your food. For more air fryer tips, check out <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>our conversion chart</a>.</p>  

<p>Many recipes, especially those for marinades or sauces, require exact liquid measurements. Apple juice adds sweetness and acidity, making it a popular choice for air fryer dishes. If you're experimenting with recipes, bookmark <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>our recipe collection</a> for inspiration.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure 1.5 Cups of Apple Juice Correctly</h3>  
<p>Use a liquid measuring cup for accuracy, filling it to the 1.5-cup mark at eye level. Avoid using dry measuring cups, as they won’t give you the correct fluid ounce measurement. For UK cooks, note that 1.5 cups (12 fl oz) is roughly 340 millilitres.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for 1.5 Cups of Apple Juice in Air Fryer Recipes</h2>  
<p>This quantity is perfect for glazes, such as apple-glazed pork chops or chicken wings. The 12 fl oz measurement ensures enough coverage without overpowering the dish. You can also use it in baking, like apple-infused cakes or muffins, where precise moisture levels are key.</p>  

<p>Another great use is in marinades—apple juice tenderises meat while adding subtle sweetness. Try it with turkey or tofu for a flavour boost. Explore <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipes</a> or <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert ideas</a> to put your 1.5 cups (12 fl oz) of apple juice to work.</p>  

<h3>Converting 1.5 Cups of Apple Juice to Other Units</h3>  
<p>Besides 12 fl oz, 1.5 cups of apple juice equals 354 millilitres (ml) or 340 grams (g) by weight. If your recipe uses metric measurements, these conversions will help. Always double-check with a kitchen scale for baking precision.</p>  

<h2>Tips for Storing Leftover Apple Juice</h2>  
<p>If you don’t use all 12 fl oz, transfer the remaining juice to an airtight container and refrigerate for up to 5 days. You can also freeze it in ice cube trays for future recipes. For more storage hacks, visit <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>our cleaning and storage guide</a>.</p>  

<p>Leftover apple juice can be reused in smoothies, salad dressings, or even as a base for homemade BBQ sauce. Just remember: 1.5 cups equals 12 fl oz, so adjust smaller quantities accordingly.</p>

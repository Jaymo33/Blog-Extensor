<p>3 tablespoons of lime juice equals approximately 45 grams. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precision ensures perfect results. Whether you’re marinating chicken or adding zest to a dessert, knowing the exact weight helps avoid over or under-seasoning. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we focus on making measurements simple for hassle-free cooking.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate lime juice measurements matter</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of lime juice can make or break your dish. Too little, and your marinade lacks tang; too much, and it overpowers other flavours. In air fryer cooking, balanced acidity enhances texture and taste, especially for proteins like chicken or shrimp. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipes</a> for dishes where lime juice plays a starring role. Precision also ensures consistency, so your meals turn out perfectly every time.</p>  

<p>Lime juice’s density can vary slightly based on freshness and pulp content, but 3 tbsp generally weighs around 45 grams. For best results, use a kitchen scale if your recipe calls for grams. This is particularly useful for baking or making sauces where ratios are critical.

<h3>How to measure lime juice without a scale</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a scale, use standard measuring spoons and level off the lime juice for accuracy. One tablespoon holds about 15 grams, so 3 tbsp will be close to 45 grams. For recipes requiring exactness, like ceviche or dressings, weighing is ideal.

<h2>Common uses for lime juice in air fryer cooking</h2>

Proper care ensures longevity and prevents lingering flavours from affecting future meals.</p>  

<h3>Adjusting lime juice for personal taste</h3>  
<p>While 3 tbsp of lime juice equals 45 grams, feel free to tweak amounts to suit your palate. Start with the recommended measurement, then adjust incrementally. For milder flavours, reduce to 2 tbsp (30g); for extra zing, add another half tablespoon. The air fryer’s intense heat can amplify citrus notes, so taste as you go.</p>

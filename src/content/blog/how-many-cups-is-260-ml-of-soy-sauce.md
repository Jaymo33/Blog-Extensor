<p>260 ml of soy sauce equals approximately 1.1 cups. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements matter. Whether you’re marinating chicken or whipping up a stir-fry, knowing how to convert millilitres to cups ensures your dish turns out perfectly. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we help you nail every measurement for flawless cooking.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Soy Sauce Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of soy sauce can make or break your dish. Too little, and your meal lacks depth; too much, and it becomes overly salty. In air fryer cooking, where flavours concentrate, precision is key. For example, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer teriyaki salmon</a> relies on balanced soy sauce for the perfect glaze. Measuring 260 ml of soy sauce correctly ensures consistency in every bite.</p>  

<p>Different brands of soy sauce may vary in viscosity, but the volume remains the same. A standard UK measuring cup holds 240 ml, so 260 ml is slightly more than one cup. For recipes requiring exactness, like our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>air fryer chicken marinades</a>, this small difference matters. Always use a liquid measuring cup for accuracy, especially when working with sticky ingredients like soy sauce.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure 260 ml of Soy Sauce Without a Cup</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a measuring cup, you can use tablespoons or a kitchen scale. One tablespoon holds about 15 ml, so 260 ml is roughly 17 tablespoons. Alternatively, soy sauce weighs approximately 1.04 grams per ml, meaning 260 ml weighs around 270 grams. This method is handy for <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>converting other liquids</a> in your air fryer recipes.</p>  

<h2>Converting 260 ml of Soy Sauce for Different Recipes</h2>  
<p>Whether you’re cooking Asian-inspired dishes or experimenting with fusion flavours, 260 ml of soy sauce is a versatile quantity. For instance, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>air fryer vegetable stir-fry</a> uses this amount to coat veggies evenly. If your recipe calls for US cups (240 ml), remember that 260 ml is about 1.1 cups. Adjustments may be needed for smaller or larger batches.</p>  

<p>Baking with soy sauce, like in our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>air fryer soy-glazed cakes</a>, requires even more precision. Here, 260 ml of soy sauce adds moisture and umami. Always level off your measuring cup to avoid over-pouring. For sticky liquids, lightly grease the cup first to ensure all the soy sauce slides out effortlessly.</p>  

<h3>Common Mistakes When Measuring Soy Sauce</h3>  
<p>One frequent error is using dry measuring cups for liquids, which leads to inaccuracies. Another is eyeballing the amount, especially when pouring directly from the bottle. For 260 ml of soy sauce, always use a liquid measuring cup placed on a flat surface. Check the meniscus (the curve at the liquid’s surface) at eye level for the most accurate reading.</p>

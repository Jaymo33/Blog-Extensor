<h3>How to Measure Chicken Broth Correctly</h3>  
<p>For the most accurate results, use a liquid measuring cup for your 1.25 cups of chicken broth. Place the cup on a flat surface and pour until the meniscus aligns with the 1.25-cup mark.

For sticky or thick broths, lightly grease the measuring cup to ensure all liquid pours out.</p>

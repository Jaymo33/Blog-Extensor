<p>2.0 cups of soy sauce equals 473 ml, making it easy to measure for your air fryer recipes. Whether you're marinating chicken, glazing salmon, or whipping up a stir-fry, precise measurements ensure the best flavour. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we know how crucial accuracy is for perfect dishes. This conversion works for both UK and US cup measurements, so you won’t need to worry about regional differences.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Soy Sauce Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of soy sauce can make or break your dish—too little and it’s bland, too much and it’s overpowering. For air fryer cooking, where sauces reduce quickly, 473 ml (2.0 cups) ensures balanced seasoning. If you’re prepping a marinade for <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>air fryer chicken</a>, this measurement guarantees even coverage. Similarly, glazing <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/salmon>salmon fillets</a> requires precision to avoid excess saltiness.</p>  

<p>Many recipes on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>our recipe hub</a> call for soy sauce, and converting cups to ml eliminates guesswork. Whether you’re baking, stir-frying, or marinating, knowing that 2.0 cups of soy sauce equals 473 ml simplifies cooking. Plus, millilitres are easier to measure with a jug or scales, reducing mess and waste.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure 2.0 Cups of Soy Sauce in ml</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a measuring cup, use a kitchen scale or liquid measuring jug. Since 1 ml of soy sauce weighs roughly 1 gram, 473 ml will be close to 473 grams. For sticky sauces like soy, lightly grease your measuring cup first to ensure it pours cleanly. This trick works wonders when prepping <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/tofu>tofu dishes</a> or <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>roasted veggies</a> in your air fryer.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for 2.0 Cups of Soy Sauce</h2>  
<p>From marinades to dipping sauces, 473 ml of soy sauce goes a long way. Try it in a teriyaki glaze for air-fried salmon or as a base for stir-fry sauces. If you’re meal prepping, this quantity is ideal for batch-cooking proteins like chicken or beef.

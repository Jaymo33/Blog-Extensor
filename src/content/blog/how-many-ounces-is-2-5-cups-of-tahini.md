<p>2.5 cups of tahini equals approximately 20 ounces (or 567 grams) in the UK. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements can make or break your dish. Whether you’re whipping up a batch of hummus or a tahini-based dressing, knowing how many ounces are in 2.5 cups of tahini ensures consistency and perfect results every time.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on even cooking, and incorrect ingredient quantities can lead to uneven textures or flavours. For example, using too much tahini in a marinade might make it overly thick, while too little could leave it lacking richness. That’s why converting 2.5 cups of tahini to ounces (or grams) is so important. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we emphasise precision to help you achieve restaurant-quality results at home.</p>  

<p>If you’re working with tahini-based sauces or dips, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> for inspiration. From crispy tofu to roasted vegetables, tahini adds a creamy depth that elevates any dish. And if you’re unsure about other conversions, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> has you covered.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure Tahini Correctly</h3>  
<p>Tahini is a thick, sticky paste, so measuring it can be tricky. For the most accurate 2.5 cups to ounces conversion, use a kitchen scale. If you don’t have one, lightly grease your measuring cup to help the tahini slide out easily. Remember, packed vs. loose measurements can vary, so always level off the top for consistency.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for Tahini in Air Fryer Recipes</h2>  
<p>Tahini isn’t just for hummus—it’s a versatile ingredient that works wonders in air fryer cooking. Try it in marinades for chicken or drizzled over roasted sweet potatoes. Since 2.5 cups of tahini equals 20 ounces, you’ll have plenty to experiment with.

<p>Cleaning up after using tahini can be a hassle, but our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner guide</a> makes it easy. Sticky residues are no match for the right techniques, ensuring your appliance stays in top condition.</p>  

<h3>Converting Other Tahini Measurements</h3>  
<p>If you need smaller or larger quantities, here’s a quick reference: 1 cup of tahini = 8 ounces, and ½ cup = 4 ounces. This makes scaling recipes up or down simple, whether you’re meal prepping or cooking for one.</p>

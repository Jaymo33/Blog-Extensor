<p>75g of soy milk is approximately 2.65 ounces. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements matter. Whether you're whipping up a vegan cake or a creamy sauce, knowing how to convert grams to ounces ensures your dish turns out perfectly every time. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we help you master these conversions effortlessly.</p>

<h2>Why convert 75g of soy milk to ounces?</h2>  
<p>Many UK recipes, especially those for air fryers, use grams for accuracy. However, some measuring tools or older recipes might list ingredients in ounces. Converting 75g of soy milk to ounces (2.65 oz) ensures you’re using the right amount for consistent results. This is particularly important for baking, where even small measurement errors can affect texture and rise.</p>  
<p>If you’re working with an air fryer, precise liquid measurements help avoid soggy or unevenly cooked dishes. For example, adding too much soy milk to a batter can make it too thin, leading to messy spills in the air fryer basket. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more handy tips.</p>  

<h2>How to measure 75g of soy milk accurately</h2>  
<p>For the best results, use a digital kitchen scale set to grams. Pour soy milk slowly until the scale reads 75g. If you don’t have a scale, 75g of soy milk is roughly 5 tablespoons (since 1 tablespoon ≈ 15g). Remember, soy milk’s density can vary slightly by brand, so weighing is ideal.</p>  
<p>When using an air fryer, opt for lighter recipes like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>vegan cakes</a> or batters where soy milk is a key ingredient. Over-measuring liquids can cause dripping, so stick to 75g (2.65 oz) for perfect consistency. Need more recipe ideas? Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a>.</p>  

<h3>Common uses for 75g of soy milk in air fryer cooking</h3>  
<p>This amount is perfect for small batches of pancakes, muffins, or creamy dips. For example, a single-serving vegan pancake might call for 75g of soy milk to keep the batter light and fluffy. It’s also a great base for marinades or glazes, adding moisture without overpowering flavours.</p>  

<h3>Does soy milk weigh the same as dairy milk?</h3>  
<p>Yes, 75g of soy milk is roughly equivalent in volume to dairy milk, but always check your recipe. Some brands of soy milk are thicker, so weighing ensures accuracy. For air fryer recipes, consistency matters—whether you’re making a <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert</a> or a savoury dish.</p>  

<h2>Tips for working with soy milk in air fryers</h2>  
<p>Soy milk can curdle at high temperatures, so avoid overheating it in marinades or sauces. For best results, mix 75g (2.65 oz) with other ingredients before air frying. If your recipe calls for heating soy milk, do it gently to prevent separation.</p>  
<p>Cleaning your air fryer after using soy milk is easy with our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning guide</a>. Soy milk residues can stick, so wipe the basket promptly. Stick to 75g measurements to minimise spills and keep cooking hassle-free.</p>

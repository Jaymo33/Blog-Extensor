<p>30g of self-raising flour equals approximately 1.06 ounces. Whether you're baking cakes, biscuits, or air fryer-friendly treats, getting your measurements right is key to perfect results. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we know how important accurate conversions are for home bakers. This guide will help you nail the conversion every time.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate flour measurements matter</h2>  
<p>Baking is a science, and even small measurement errors can affect texture and rise. Self-raising flour contains a raising agent, so precision ensures your bakes turn out light and fluffy. If you're using an air fryer for baking, like in our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer cake recipes</a>, correct flour quantities are even more crucial due to the compact cooking space. Too much flour can lead to dense results, while too little may cause collapsing.</p>  

<p>Digital scales are the most accurate way to measure flour, but if you only have measuring cups or need ounces, conversions come in handy. Remember that 30g of self-raising flour to ounces is roughly 1.06 oz. For larger batches, you can scale this up proportionally â€“ 60g would be 2.12 oz, and so on.</p>  

<h2>Converting 30g self-raising flour to ounces</h2>  
<p>The exact conversion of 30 grams of self-raising flour to ounces is 1.058 oz, but for practical purposes, 1.06 oz is close enough. This conversion applies to all types of self-raising flour, whether store-bought or homemade. If you're adapting recipes from our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>, this measurement will help you adjust quantities correctly.</p>  

<h3>Measuring without scales</h3>  
<p>If you don't have digital scales, 30g of self-raising flour is about 4 slightly rounded tablespoons. However, this can vary based on how you scoop the flour. For best results, spoon the flour into the tablespoon and level it off with a knife. This method gives you a more accurate 30g self-raising flour to ounces equivalent than scooping directly from the bag.</p>  

<h2>Using 30g of self-raising flour in air fryer recipes</h2>  
<p>Many small-batch air fryer recipes call for around 30g of self-raising flour. This quantity is perfect for single-serving cakes or a small batch of scones. When using your air fryer, remember that it cooks faster than a conventional oven, so check our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>air fryer cake recipes</a> for timing adjustments.

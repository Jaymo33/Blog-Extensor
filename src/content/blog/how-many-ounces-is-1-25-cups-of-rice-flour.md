<p>1.25 cups of rice flour equals approximately 5.3 ounces (150 grams). This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes, where precision ensures perfect texture and consistency. Whether you're making gluten-free treats or crispy coatings, knowing the exact weight helps avoid mishaps. For more air fryer measurement tips, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on even heat distribution, and incorrect flour amounts can lead to dry or dense results. Rice flour, in particular, absorbs moisture differently than wheat flour, so weighing it ensures consistency. If you're adapting a traditional recipe for your air fryer, converting cups to ounces is a must. Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> for inspiration on using rice flour in dishes like tempura or cakes.</p>  

<p>Many UK bakers prefer weighing ingredients for reliability, as cup measurements can vary. A kitchen scale eliminates guesswork, especially for gluten-free baking. For example, 1.25 cups of rice flour (5.3 oz) is ideal for coating chicken or making light batters. Need more guidance? Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert category</a> features rice flour-based treats optimised for air fryers.</p>  

<h3>How to measure rice flour without a scale</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a scale, spoon the flour into a measuring cup and level it off—don’t pack it down. This method helps approximate the weight, though a scale is more accurate. For 1.25 cups of rice flour (5.3 oz), lightly fill two ½-cup measures and one ¼-cup measure. This technique works well for air fryer batters and coatings, ensuring even cooking.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for rice flour in air fryers</h2>  
<p>Rice flour is a staple in gluten-free air fryer cooking, perfect for crispy coatings or delicate baked goods. From onion rings to mochi cakes, its fine texture delivers a light crunch. Using 1.25 cups (5.3 oz) ensures balanced recipes without sogginess. Discover more in our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipes</a>, where rice flour shines in crunchy coatings.</p>  

<p>For tempura or fritters, rice flour’s lightness prevents oil absorption, making it air fryer-friendly. A 1.25-cup (5.3 oz) portion is ideal for battering vegetables or seafood. After cooking, clean your air fryer easily with our recommended <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning tips</a> to maintain performance.</p>  

<h3>Converting other rice flour amounts</h3>  
<p>Need to adjust your recipe? Here’s a quick reference: 1 cup of rice flour = 4.25 oz, so 1.25 cups = 5.3 oz. For larger batches, double or triple the amount accordingly. This flexibility makes rice flour a go-to for air fryer enthusiasts experimenting with textures.

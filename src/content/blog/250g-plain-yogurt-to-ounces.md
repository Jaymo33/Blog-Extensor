<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on even cooking, and incorrect measurements can lead to uneven textures or undercooked food.

<p>Many UK recipes use grams, but ounces are still widely used, particularly in older cookbooks or American-inspired dishes. Knowing how to switch between the two saves time and avoids kitchen mishaps. Whether you're meal prepping or experimenting with new recipes, precise measurements are key. Our guide takes the guesswork out of converting 250g plain yogurt to ounces.</p>  

<h3>How to measure 250g of plain yogurt without scales</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a kitchen scale, you can use volume measurements to estimate 250g of plain yogurt. One metric cup of yogurt is roughly 245g, so a heaped cup will get you close to 250g. For ounces, this translates to just under 9 oz. However, scales are more accurate, especially for air fryer recipes where precision matters.

<h3>Does yogurt weight change with fat content?</h3>

Greek yogurt is thicker, so it might weigh slightly more by volume, but the gram-to-ounce conversion remains the same. Stick to scales for the most accurate results in air fryer cooking.</p>

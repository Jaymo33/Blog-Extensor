<p>2.5 cups of icing sugar equals approximately 312.5 grams. This conversion is essential for precise baking, especially when using an air fryer where measurements can make or break a recipe. Whether you’re making cakes, cookies, or frosting, knowing the exact gram equivalent ensures consistency.

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Baking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers require precise ingredient measurements to ensure even cooking and perfect texture. Too much or too little icing sugar can affect the moisture and structure of your baked goods. For example, a cake with excess sugar may brown too quickly, while too little can leave it dry. That’s why converting 2.5 cups of icing sugar to grams is so helpful. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more handy guides.</p>  

<p>Different brands of icing sugar may vary slightly in density, but 312.5 grams is a reliable standard. If you’re using a kitchen scale, always spoon the sugar into the cup lightly to avoid compacting it. For more dessert inspiration, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>cake recipes</a> designed for air fryers.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure Icing Sugar Without a Scale</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a scale, use the spoon-and-level method for accuracy. Lightly spoon the icing sugar into a measuring cup and level it off with a knife. Avoid tapping the cup, as this compacts the sugar and leads to incorrect measurements. For more baking hacks, visit <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>our recipe hub</a>.</p>  

<h2>Converting Icing Sugar: UK vs. US Measurements</h2>  
<p>While 2.5 cups of icing sugar in the UK and US both convert to roughly 312.5 grams, slight variations exist due to cup sizes. The UK uses metric cups (250ml), whereas the US uses customary cups (240ml). For air fryer recipes, sticking to grams eliminates confusion. Need help cleaning your air fryer after baking?

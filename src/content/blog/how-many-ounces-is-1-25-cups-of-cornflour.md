<p>1.25 cups of cornflour equals approximately 5.3 ounces (oz). This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precision ensures crispy, even results. Whether you're coating chicken or thickening sauces, getting the measurement right makes all the difference.</p>

<h2>Why accurate cornflour measurements matter in air frying</h2>
<p>Cornflour is a staple in air fryer cooking, often used for crispy coatings or as a thickening agent. Using 1.25 cups (5.3 oz) instead of eyeballing it guarantees consistent texture. Too little and your coating won't crisp properly; too much and you'll get a chalky taste. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we've found this measurement works perfectly for 4-6 portions of fried chicken or vegetable tempura.</p>
<p>Many air fryer recipes, especially those in our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken category</a>, specify weights rather than volumes for reliability. A digital scale helps, but if you only have measuring cups, knowing 1.25 cups equals 5.3 oz saves the day. This conversion also applies to UK recipes, though imperial cup sizes vary slightly by country.</p>

<h3>How we calculated 1.25 cups to ounces</h3>
<p>Standard UK cornflour weighs about 4.25 oz per cup. For 1.25 cups, we multiply 4.25 by 1.25 to get 5.3125 oz, which rounds to 5.3 oz. This matches the <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> we use across all our recipes. Factors like compaction can slightly alter the weight, so we recommend the spoon-and-level method for measuring.</p>

<h2>Converting other cornflour amounts for air fryer recipes</h2>
<p>Once you've mastered 1.25 cups (5.3 oz), scaling up or down becomes easy. Half that amount is 0.625 cups (2.65 oz), perfect for small batches in compact air fryers. Double it to 2.5 cups (10.6 oz) when meal prepping freezer items from our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/frozen-foods>frozen foods collection</a>.</p>
<p>For those using grams, 5.3 oz converts to 150 grams. This measurement appears frequently in European-style air fryer recipes. Our testing shows this quantity coats about 500g of protein evenly without waste. Remember these equivalents when trying international recipes from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>our global collection</a>.</p>

<h3>Tips for measuring cornflour perfectly every time</h3>
<p>Always use dry measuring cups for 1.25 cups of cornflour, not liquid ones. Gently spoon the flour into the cup without packing it down, then level off with a straight edge. For the 5.3 oz measurement, a kitchen scale eliminates guesswork. Store cornflour in airtight containers to maintain consistent density between uses.</p>

<h2>Common air fryer uses for 1.25 cups (5.3 oz) of cornflour</h2>
<p>This quantity forms the base for many air fryer coatings. Mix it with spices for crispy chicken wings - a favourite in our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/appetizers>appetizers section</a>. Combined with baking powder, it creates ultra-crispy tempura batter for vegetables. You'll also need exactly 1.25 cups (5.3 oz) when making gluten-free air fryer onion rings or fish coatings.</p>
<p>Beyond coatings, 1.25 cups (5.3 oz) thickens sauces beautifully without lumps. It's the perfect amount for two batches of air fryer gravy or stir-fry sauce. When cleaning your air fryer afterward, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning guide</a> shows how to remove cornflour residue easily.</p>

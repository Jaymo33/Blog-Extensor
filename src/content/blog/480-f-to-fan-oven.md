<p>480 F converts to approximately 250 C in a fan oven. This is the standard conversion used for most air fryer recipes, as air fryers operate similarly to convection ovens. Whether you're adapting a recipe or troubleshooting your air fryer settings, knowing this conversion is essential for perfect results every time.</p>

<h2>Why Convert 480 F to Fan Oven?</h2>
<p>Air fryers and fan ovens both use circulating hot air to cook food evenly. This means the temperature settings often align closely, making conversions straightforward. At <a href="https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk">airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we recommend using 250 C as your go-to fan oven equivalent for 480 F. This ensures your food cooks evenly without burning or drying out.</p>
<p>Many air fryer recipes, especially those for crispy chicken or roasted vegetables, call for high temperatures like 480 F. Converting this to 250 C in a fan oven helps maintain the same cooking intensity. If you're using a conventional oven without a fan, you'll need to adjust slightly higher, but we'll cover that later.</p>

<h2>How to Adjust Cooking Times</h2>
<p>When converting 480 F to fan oven settings, cooking times may vary slightly. Air fryers cook faster due to their compact size and powerful airflow. For example, a recipe calling for 15 minutes at 480 F in an air fryer might need 18-20 minutes at 250 C in a fan oven.</p>
<p>Always check your food a few minutes early when using a fan oven. This prevents overcooking, especially for delicate items like fish or pastries. Our <a href="https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart">air fryer conversion chart</a> has more detailed timing adjustments for different foods.</p>

<h3>Special Considerations for Air Fryers</h3>
<p>Air fryers excel at high-heat cooking, which is why 480 F is a common setting. When using a fan oven instead, you might need to increase the temperature slightly if your food isn't crisping up. Try 260 C if 250 C isn't giving you the desired texture.</p>

<h2>Common Recipes Using 480 F</h2>
<p>Many of our favourite <a href="https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken">chicken recipes</a> use 480 F for that perfect golden crunch. From wings to tenders, this temperature delivers restaurant-quality results at home. The same goes for roasted potatoes or crispy tofu - high heat is key.</p>
<p>If you're adapting a fan oven recipe to your air fryer, simply reverse the conversion. A recipe calling for 250 C in a fan oven translates to 480 F in your air fryer. This makes it easy to switch between appliances without compromising on taste or texture.</p>

<h3>Troubleshooting Temperature Issues</h3>
<p>If your food isn't cooking evenly at 480 F (250 C), your oven or air fryer might need calibration. Use an oven thermometer to verify the actual temperature. Also, ensure your air fryer basket isn't overcrowded, as this can block airflow and affect cooking.</p>

<h2>Fan Oven vs. Conventional Oven</h2>
<p>While 480 F converts to 250 C in a fan oven, a conventional oven would need about 260-270 C for similar results. The fan helps distribute heat more evenly, so without it, you'll need a slightly higher temperature. This is why air fryers, which are essentially mini fan ovens, are so efficient.</p>
<p>For best results when converting between appliances, always refer to reliable sources like <a href="https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk">airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>. Our <a href="https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes">recipe collection</a> includes specific instructions for both air fryers and ovens, taking the guesswork out of temperature conversions.</p>

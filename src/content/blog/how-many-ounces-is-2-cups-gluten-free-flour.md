<p>2 cups of gluten-free flour equals approximately 9.6 ounces (272 grams). This conversion is essential for precise baking, especially when using an air fryer, where accurate measurements can make or break your recipe. Whether you're making gluten-free cakes, cookies, or bread, knowing the exact weight ensures consistency and perfect results every time.</p>  

<h2>Why measuring gluten-free flour in ounces matters</h2>  
<p>Gluten-free flour behaves differently than regular wheat flour, so measuring by weight (ounces) rather than volume (cups) is far more reliable. A cup of gluten-free flour can vary in weight depending on how it's packed, the brand, and even humidity levels. For air fryer recipes, precision is key—too much flour can lead to dry, crumbly results, while too little may cause your dish to fall apart. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more handy measurement tips.</p>  

<p>Many UK bakers prefer weighing ingredients in ounces or grams for accuracy. If you're adapting a recipe from cups to ounces, this conversion ensures you won't end up with a dense or overly dry bake. For more gluten-free inspiration, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>gluten-free recipes</a> tailored for air fryers.</p>  

<h3>How to measure 2 cups of gluten-free flour correctly</h3>  
<p>To get an accurate 9.6 ounces (or 272 grams) from 2 cups of gluten-free flour, lightly spoon the flour into your measuring cup and level it off with a knife. Avoid scooping directly from the bag, as this compacts the flour and leads to excess. For best results, use a digital kitchen scale—this is especially helpful when preparing air fryer recipes where precision matters.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for 2 cups of gluten-free flour</h2>  
<p>Two cups of gluten-free flour (9.6 oz) is a versatile quantity for many air fryer-friendly bakes. You could whip up a batch of gluten-free cookies, a small loaf of bread, or even a cake. If you're meal prepping, this amount is perfect for making gluten-free batter for <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken coatings</a> or crispy vegetable fritters.</p>  

<p>Many gluten-free flours, like almond or coconut flour, have different weights per cup, so always check the packaging. For example, almond flour is lighter, so 2 cups would weigh around 7 ounces. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner guide</a> also helps keep your appliance in top shape after baking gluten-free goodies.</p>  

<h3>Converting other gluten-free flour quantities</h3>  
<p>If your recipe calls for more or less than 2 cups, here's a quick reference: 1 cup = 4.8 oz (136g), 3 cups = 14.4 oz (408g), and so on. Keeping these conversions handy ensures you can adapt any recipe for your air fryer without guesswork.

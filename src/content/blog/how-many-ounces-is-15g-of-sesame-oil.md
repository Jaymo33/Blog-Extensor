<p>15g of sesame oil equals approximately 0.53 ounces. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements can make or break a dish. Whether you’re whipping up a marinade or drizzling oil over veggies, knowing the exact weight ensures perfect results every time. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we help simplify these conversions so you can focus on cooking. Let’s dive deeper into why accurate measurements matter.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of sesame oil can affect texture, flavour, and even cooking time in your air fryer. Too little oil, and your food might dry out; too much, and it could become greasy. For example, 15g of sesame oil to ounces (0.53 oz) is a common measurement in Asian-inspired dishes. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> makes it easy to switch between grams and ounces. Consistency is key, especially when replicating restaurant-quality meals at home.</p>  

<p>Many air fryer recipes, like crispy tofu or sesame chicken, rely on precise oil measurements for the best results. If you’re converting 15g of sesame oil in ounces, a digital kitchen scale can help. For more recipe ideas, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/tofu>tofu recipes</a>.

<h3>How to Measure 15g of Sesame Oil Without a Scale</h3>

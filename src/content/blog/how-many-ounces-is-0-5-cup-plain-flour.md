<p>0.5 cup of plain flour equals approximately 2.1 ounces (or 60 grams). This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements ensure even cooking and perfect texture. Whether you’re baking air fryer cookies or whipping up a quick cake, knowing the exact weight of your flour can make all the difference.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Flour Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers circulate hot air rapidly, so ingredient ratios must be spot-on to avoid dry or uneven results. Too much flour can make baked goods dense, while too little may cause them to crumble. For example, if you’re making air fryer muffins from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>our recipe collection</a>, 0.5 cup of plain flour (2.1 oz) ensures the right rise and tenderness. Always measure flour by spooning it into the cup and levelling it off—never scoop directly from the bag!</p>  

<p>Many UK bakers prefer weighing ingredients for consistency, especially when adapting recipes for air fryers. A kitchen scale is a handy tool, but if you don’t have one, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> simplifies the process. Remember, 0.5 cup of plain flour to ounces is a small but critical detail for flawless results.</p>  

<h2>How to Convert 0.5 Cup Plain Flour to Ounces Without a Scale</h2>  
<p>If you don’t own a scale, use the spoon-and-level method for the most accurate 0.5 cup plain flour to ounces conversion. Gently spoon flour into a measuring cup until it’s heaped, then level it with a knife. This avoids compacting the flour, which can add extra weight. For reference, 1 cup of plain flour weighs about 4.2 ounces, so halving that gives you 2.1 ounces for 0.5 cup.</p>  

<h3>Common Mistakes When Measuring Flour</h3>  
<p>One major mistake is tapping or shaking the cup, which settles the flour and leads to over-measuring. Another is using a liquid measuring cup instead of a dry one. For air fryer recipes like those on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, precision ensures your cakes and breads turn out light and fluffy every time.</p>  

<h2>Adjusting Recipes for Air Fryer Success</h2>  
<p>Air fryers cook faster than conventional ovens, so small measurement errors can magnify. If a recipe calls for 0.5 cup of plain flour in ounces (2.1 oz), stick to it closely. For example, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>air fryer cake recipes</a> rely on this ratio for optimal texture. Even a 10% deviation can alter the outcome, so when in doubt, weigh it out!</p>  

<p>Another tip: sift your flour after measuring to aerate it. This is especially useful for delicate bakes like air fryer sponges.

<h3>Flour Types and Their Weights</h3>  
<p>Not all flours weigh the same. While 0.5 cup of plain flour is 2.1 ounces, self-raising flour is slightly lighter due to added raising agents. Always check the recipe requirements, especially for air fryer baking, where consistency is key.</p>

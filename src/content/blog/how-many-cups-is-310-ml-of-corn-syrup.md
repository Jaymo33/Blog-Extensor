<p>Measuring liquids like corn syrup can be tricky, especially when converting between metric and imperial units. A slight miscalculation can lead to overly sweet or runny results. That's why we recommend using a liquid measuring cup for accuracy. If you're working with smaller quantities, a kitchen scale can also be helpful.

<h2>How to Measure 310 ml of Corn Syrup</h2>
<p>To measure 310 ml of corn syrup, you'll need a liquid measuring cup marked with metric and imperial units. Pour the syrup slowly into the cup, checking the measurement at eye level for accuracy. Since corn syrup is thick and sticky, you might find it helpful to lightly grease the measuring cup first. This ensures the syrup slides out easily without leaving residue behind.</p>
<p>If you don't have a measuring cup, you can use a kitchen scale. One milliliter of corn syrup weighs roughly 1.42 grams, so 310 ml would be about 440 grams. This method is especially useful if you're scaling recipes up or down.

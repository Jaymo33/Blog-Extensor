<p>200g of chopped garlic equals approximately 7.05 ounces. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes, where precise measurements can make all the difference. Whether you're preparing a garlic-infused dish or following a recipe from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, knowing this conversion ensures accuracy.</p>

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on even cooking, and incorrect ingredient quantities can throw off your results. Too much garlic might overpower the dish, while too little could leave it bland. Using 200g of chopped garlic (7.05 oz) ensures consistency, especially in recipes like garlic butter shrimp or roasted vegetables. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more handy measurements.</p>  

<p>Many UK recipes use grams, but if your kitchen scale measures ounces, this conversion is a lifesaver. Whether you're meal prepping or experimenting with new dishes, knowing that 200g of chopped garlic is 7.05 ounces keeps things simple. For more inspiration, browse our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable recipes</a>.</p>  

<h3>How to measure chopped garlic without a scale</h3>  
<p>If you don't have a scale, you can estimate 200g of chopped garlic. One medium garlic clove yields about 5g when chopped, so you'd need roughly 40 cloves for 200g. That’s around 7.05 ounces, but using a scale is always more precise. For perfectly measured recipes, visit <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>our recipe collection</a>.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for 200g of chopped garlic in air fryers</h2>  
<p>From marinades to roasted dishes, 200g of chopped garlic (7.05 oz) adds bold flavour. Try it in garlic bread, stir-fries, or even as a base for sauces. The air fryer locks in the aroma, making every bite delicious.

<p>Garlic’s versatility shines in air fryer cooking. Whether you're making garlic potatoes or a garlic-infused protein, 200g (7.05 oz) is a great starting point. Adjust to taste, but this measurement ensures balanced flavour. Explore more ideas in our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipes</a> section.</p>  

<h3>Converting other garlic measurements</h3>  
<p>If your recipe calls for minced or whole garlic, the weight varies. Minced garlic is denser, so 200g is still 7.05 oz, but volume differs. Always weigh for accuracy, especially in air fryer cooking where consistency is key.</p>

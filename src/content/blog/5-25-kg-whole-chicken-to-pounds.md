<h2>Cooking a 5.25 kg Whole Chicken in an Air Fryer</h2>
<p>Cooking a 5.25 kg whole chicken in an air fryer requires careful attention to time and temperature. Given that 5.25 kg is approximately 11.57 pounds, you'll need to adjust cooking times accordingly. Most air fryers recommend cooking whole chicken at around 180°C for 20 minutes per pound, plus an additional 15 minutes. For an 11.57-pound chicken, this translates to roughly 4 hours of total cooking time. Always use a meat thermometer to ensure the internal temperature reaches 75°C for food safety.</p>

<p>Preparing the chicken properly is key to a delicious outcome. Pat the skin dry with kitchen paper to ensure crispiness, and season generously with your favourite herbs and spices. Trussing the chicken helps it cook evenly, preventing the wings and legs from burning. Place the chicken breast-side down in the air fryer basket to start, flipping it halfway through cooking for even browning.

<h3>Tips for Perfect Air Fryer Chicken</h3>
<p>To achieve the best results with a 5.25 kg whole chicken in the air fryer, preheating is essential. This ensures even cooking from the start and helps crisp the skin. Basting the chicken with its juices or a light oil spray during cooking enhances flavour and moisture. Letting the chicken rest for 10-15 minutes after cooking allows the juices to redistribute, resulting in tender meat. Cleaning your air fryer afterwards is easier with products like <a href="https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner">air fryer cleaner</a>, keeping it in top condition for future use.</p>

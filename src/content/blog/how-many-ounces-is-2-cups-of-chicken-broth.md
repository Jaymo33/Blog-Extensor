<p>2 cups of chicken broth equals approximately 16 ounces. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes, where precise measurements can make or break your dish. Whether you're making soups, stews, or marinades, knowing how many ounces are in 2 cups of chicken broth ensures consistency. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we focus on helping you get the best results with accurate measurements.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on precise ingredient ratios to achieve perfect texture and flavour. Too much or too little liquid, like chicken broth, can affect cooking times and outcomes. For example, 2 cups of chicken broth to ounces (16 oz) is a common measurement in recipes. Using the correct amount ensures your food cooks evenly and retains moisture.</p>  
<p>Many air fryer recipes, especially those for soups or braised dishes, call for chicken broth. If you're converting 2 cups of chicken broth to oz, remember it’s roughly 16 ounces. This helps when scaling recipes up or down. For more conversions, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>  

<h3>How to measure chicken broth correctly</h3>  
<p>Liquid measurements can be tricky, but using a clear measuring cup ensures accuracy. Pour the broth to the 2-cup mark, and you’ll have 16 ounces. If your recipe uses weight, a kitchen scale can confirm the ounces in 2 cups of chicken broth. This is especially useful for UK cooks who prefer metric measurements.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for chicken broth in air fryer recipes</h2>  
<p>Chicken broth adds depth to many air fryer dishes, from marinades to sauces. For instance, 2 cups of chicken broth in ounces (16 oz) might be used to braise chicken or soften vegetables. It’s a staple in recipes like air-fried risotto or gravy. Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipes</a> section for inspiration.</p>  
<p>Some recipes may call for reducing the broth, so knowing the starting amount (2 cups equals 16 ounces) helps track evaporation. This ensures your dish isn’t too dry or watery. Whether you’re cooking <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken</a> or vegetables, accurate broth measurements elevate flavour.</p>  

<h3>Converting between cups and ounces</h3>  
<p>If a recipe lists chicken broth in ounces but you only have cups, remember that 1 cup equals 8 ounces. So, 2 cups of chicken broth to oz is 16 ounces. This conversion works for most liquids, making it a handy rule for air fryer cooking. Keep our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a> bookmarked for quick reference.</p>  

<h2>Tips for storing and using chicken broth</h2>  
<p>Once opened, store chicken broth in the fridge and use within 3–4 days. For longer storage, freeze it in portions (like 16-ounce batches) for easy use. When reheating in the air fryer, ensure it’s covered to prevent splattering.

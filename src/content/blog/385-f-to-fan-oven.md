<p>385°F converts to approximately 170°C in a fan oven. This is a common temperature for roasting meats, baking cakes, or crisping vegetables in both air fryers and fan-assisted ovens. Understanding this conversion ensures your recipes turn out perfectly every time.</p>

<h2>Why Convert 385°F to Fan Oven?</h2>
<p>Fan ovens circulate hot air for even cooking, much like air fryers. Converting 385°F (around 170°C fan) helps maintain recipe accuracy, especially when adapting American recipes or using your air fryer. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we recommend checking our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for other common temperatures.</p>
<p>Fan ovens typically cook 20°C cooler than conventional ovens. So 385°F (196°C conventional) drops to 170°C with the fan on. This adjustment prevents overcooking, which is crucial for delicate bakes or crispy air fryer dishes like those in our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipes</a>.</p>

<h2>How to Use 385°F in an Air Fryer</h2>
<p>Air fryers operate similarly to fan ovens but in a compact space. Set your air fryer to 170°C (385°F equivalent) for foods like roasted potatoes or baked goods. The circulating air mimics a fan oven’s efficiency, often reducing cooking times by 20%.</p>
<p>For frozen foods at 385°F, check our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/frozen-foods>frozen foods guide</a>. Always preheat your air fryer for 3-5 minutes at this temperature to ensure even cooking. This matches the fan oven’s performance while saving energy.</p>

<h3>Adjustments for Different Foods</h3>
<p>At 385°F (170°C fan), chicken thighs take 25-30 minutes, while cookies need just 8-10. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a> includes specific timings. Remember, air fryers cook faster than fan ovens, so check food early.</p>

<h2>Common Mistakes When Converting 385°F</h2>
<p>Many forget that 385°F isn’t a direct 1:1 conversion. Fan ovens and air fryers need that 20°C reduction from conventional settings. Overheating at 385°F can dry out meats or burn baked goods.</p>
<p>Another error is ignoring appliance variations. Your air fryer’s wattage might require slight tweaks to the 385°F (170°C fan) standard. Always use a thermometer to verify temperatures, especially for critical dishes like those in our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>cake recipes</a>.</p>

<h3>Tools for Perfect Conversion</h3>
<p>Keep an oven thermometer handy to confirm your 385°F fan oven conversion. Digital probes help monitor air fryer temperatures accurately. For cleaning after high-heat cooking, try our recommended <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner</a>.</p>

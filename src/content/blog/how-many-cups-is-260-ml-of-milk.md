<p>260 ml of milk is approximately 1.1 cups in standard US measurements or 1.04 cups in UK metric measurements. This conversion is essential for precise baking, cooking, or air fryer recipes where accuracy matters. Whether you're whipping up a cake or a creamy sauce, knowing how to measure 260 ml of milk in cups ensures your dish turns out perfectly every time.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Milk Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Getting the right amount of milk is crucial, especially in baking where ratios affect texture and rise. Too much or too little can lead to dense cakes or runny batters. For air fryer recipes, precise measurements ensure even cooking and perfect results. If you're following a recipe from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, converting 260 ml of milk to cups correctly guarantees consistency.</p>  

<p>Different countries use varying cup sizes, which can cause confusion. The US customary cup is 240 ml, while the UK metric cup is 250 ml. This means 260 ml of milk equals roughly 1.1 US cups or 1.04 UK cups. Always check which measurement system your recipe uses to avoid mistakes.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure 260 ml of Milk Without a Measuring Cup</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a measuring cup, you can still measure 260 ml of milk accurately. A standard tablespoon holds about 15 ml, so 260 ml is roughly 17 tablespoons. Alternatively, use a kitchen scale—260 ml of milk weighs around 260 grams. This method is especially handy for air fryer recipes where precision is key.</p>  

<h2>Converting 260 ml of Milk for Baking and Cooking</h2>  
<p>Many baking recipes, like those found on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, require exact milk measurements. Whether you're making pancakes, custards, or muffins, 260 ml of milk translates to just over one cup. This small difference can impact the final product, so measuring correctly is vital.</p>  

<p>For savoury dishes, such as creamy pasta or sauces, 260 ml of milk provides the ideal consistency. If you're adapting a recipe for your air fryer, ensure you convert measurements accurately to avoid overly thick or thin results. A handy <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> can simplify the process.</p>  

<h3>Common Recipes Using 260 ml of Milk</h3>  
<p>Popular recipes that use 260 ml of milk include pancakes, béchamel sauce, and custards. If you're preparing a dessert in your air fryer, like a bread pudding, this measurement ensures the right texture. Check out <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> for inspiration on how to use 260 ml of milk in delicious ways.</p>  

<h2>Tips for Measuring Milk in Cups</h2>  
<p>When measuring 260 ml of milk, always use a liquid measuring cup for accuracy. Fill it to just above the 1-cup line for US measurements or slightly less for UK cups. Avoid using dry measuring cups, as they won’t give the same precision. For air fryer cooking, small deviations can affect results, so take care.</p>  

<p>If you're scaling a recipe up or down, remember that 260 ml of milk is roughly 10% more than a US cup. Adjust other ingredients proportionally to maintain balance. Keeping your air fryer clean with <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>proper cleaning tools</a> also ensures consistent cooking performance.</p>  

<h3>Does Milk Type Affect the Measurement?</h3>  
<p>Whole, skim, or plant-based milk all measure the same by volume—260 ml is 260 ml regardless of fat content. However, density can vary slightly, so for ultra-precise baking, weighing may be better. In most air fryer recipes, though, the difference is negligible.</p>

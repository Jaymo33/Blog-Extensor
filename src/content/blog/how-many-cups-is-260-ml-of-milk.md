<h2>Why Accurate Milk Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Getting the right amount of milk is crucial, especially in baking where ratios affect texture and rise. Too much or too little can lead to dense cakes or runny batters.

If you're following a recipe from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, converting 260 ml of milk to cups correctly guarantees consistency.</p>

<h3>How to Measure 260 ml of Milk Without a Measuring Cup</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a measuring cup, you can still measure 260 ml of milk accurately. A standard tablespoon holds about 15 ml, so 260 ml is roughly 17 tablespoons. Alternatively, use a kitchen scale—260 ml of milk weighs around 260 grams. This method is especially handy for air fryer recipes where precision is key.</p>

<h2>Tips for Measuring Milk in Cups</h2>  
<p>When measuring 260 ml of milk, always use a liquid measuring cup for accuracy. Fill it to just above the 1-cup line for US measurements or slightly less for UK cups. Avoid using dry measuring cups, as they won’t give the same precision. For air fryer cooking, small deviations can affect results, so take care.</p>  

<p>If you're scaling a recipe up or down, remember that 260 ml of milk is roughly 10% more than a US cup. Adjust other ingredients proportionally to maintain balance.

<h3>Does Milk Type Affect the Measurement?</h3>  
<p>Whole, skim, or plant-based milk all measure the same by volume—260 ml is 260 ml regardless of fat content. However, density can vary slightly, so for ultra-precise baking, weighing may be better. In most air fryer recipes, though, the difference is negligible.</p>

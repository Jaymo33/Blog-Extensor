<p>When using an air fryer, even small measurement errors can affect texture and rise. That’s why converting 30g of baking powder to ounces (1.06 oz) is so important.

<h3>Why accurate baking powder measurements matter</h3>  
<p>Too much or too little baking powder can ruin your air fryer bakes. Excess baking powder causes bitter tastes and over-rising, while too little leaves cakes dense.

Precision ensures your bakes turn out light, fluffy, and delicious.</p>  

<h2>How to measure 30g of baking powder without scales</h2>  
<p>If you don’t have scales, 30g of baking powder is roughly 2 UK tablespoons. However, this can vary based on how tightly packed the powder is. For best results, use proper measuring spoons or a conversion chart. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion guide</a> includes spoon measurements for common ingredients. Remember, accuracy is key for air fryer success.</p>

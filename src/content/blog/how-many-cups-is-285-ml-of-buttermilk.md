<p>285 ml of buttermilk is approximately 1.2 cups. This conversion is essential for baking and cooking, especially when using an air fryer where precise measurements can make all the difference. Whether you're whipping up pancakes or a tender cake, knowing how to convert 285 ml of buttermilk to cups ensures your recipes turn out perfectly every time.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter</h2>
<p>When it comes to baking, precision is key. Using the right amount of buttermilk can affect the texture, moisture, and overall success of your dish. Too little, and your baked goods might turn out dry; too much, and they could become soggy. That's why converting 285 ml of buttermilk to cups accurately is so important. For air fryer recipes, where cooking times and temperatures are tightly controlled, precise measurements are even more critical.</p>
<p>Buttermilk is a staple in many recipes, from fluffy pancakes to moist cakes. If you're using an air fryer for baking, you'll want to ensure your measurements are spot-on. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more handy tips and conversions to make your cooking experience seamless.</p>

<h2>How to Measure 285 ml of Buttermilk</h2>
<p>Measuring liquids like buttermilk can be tricky, especially if you don't have a metric measuring cup. Here's a simple way to measure 285 ml of buttermilk using standard cups: 1 cup equals 240 ml, so 285 ml is just over 1 cup. To get the exact measurement, you can use a liquid measuring cup with metric markings or a kitchen scale for precision.</p>

<h3>Converting 285 ml of Buttermilk in Different Cup Sizes</h3>
<p>It's worth noting that cup sizes can vary depending on where you are. In the UK, a standard cup is 250 ml, while in the US, it's 240 ml. This means 285 ml of buttermilk is roughly 1.14 cups in the UK and 1.2 cups in the US. For air fryer recipes, especially those from international sources, being aware of these differences can help you avoid measurement mishaps.</p>

<h2>Using Buttermilk in Air Fryer Recipes</h2>

When converting 285 ml of buttermilk to cups, remember that slight variations can affect the outcome, so always measure carefully.</p>
<p>For those who love baking, buttermilk is a game-changer in air fryer cakes and muffins. Its acidity helps activate baking soda, giving your treats a light, airy texture. Discover more delicious ideas in our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>cake recipes</a> section, where buttermilk often plays a starring role.</p>

<h3>Tips for Storing Buttermilk</h3>
<p>If you often use buttermilk in your air fryer recipes, proper storage is key to keeping it fresh. Store it in the coldest part of your fridge, and always check the expiry date before use. You can also freeze buttermilk in ice cube trays for easy portioning—just thaw what you need for your next recipe.</p>

<h2>Common Substitutes for Buttermilk</h2>
<p>Don't have buttermilk on hand? No problem. You can make a quick substitute by adding 1 tablespoon of lemon juice or vinegar to 285 ml of milk and letting it sit for 5 minutes. This mimics the acidity and texture of buttermilk, making it a great stand-in for air fryer recipes.

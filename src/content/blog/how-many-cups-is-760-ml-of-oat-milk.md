<p>760 ml of oat milk equals approximately 3.2 cups in the UK or 3.2 cups in the US (metric). Whether you're baking, cooking, or preparing a recipe in your air fryer, knowing this conversion ensures accuracy. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we help simplify measurements so your dishes turn out perfectly every time.</p>

<h2>Understanding the Conversion: 760 ml of Oat Milk to Cups</h2>  
<p>Converting 760 ml of oat milk to cups is straightforward once you know the standard measurements. In the UK, 1 cup equals 250 ml, making 760 ml roughly 3.04 cups. In the US, 1 cup is 240 ml, so 760 ml is about 3.17 cups. For most recipes, rounding to 3.2 cups works perfectly. This conversion is especially useful for air fryer recipes, where precision matters.</p>  
<p>If you're working with a recipe from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>our collection</a>, you'll often find measurements in both ml and cups. Knowing how to switch between them ensures you never go wrong. Whether you're making oat milk pancakes or a creamy sauce, 760 ml of oat milk translates seamlessly to just over 3 cups.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on even cooking, and incorrect measurements can throw off textures and flavours. Using 760 ml of oat milk instead of 3 cups could make a batter too runny or a sauce too thick. That's why we recommend using a measuring jug for liquids like oat milk.

<h3>UK vs. US Cup Measurements for Oat Milk</h3>

For UK bakers, 760 ml is 3.04 cups, while US bakers will measure it as 3.17 cups. Most recipes account for this slight variance, but if precision is crucial, stick to one system.</p>

For air fryer cooking, precise measurements are always recommended to achieve the best texture and flavour in your dishes."

<h3>How to Measure 0.375 Cup of Rice Correctly</h3>
<p>To measure 0.375 cup of rice accurately, use a standard measuring cup and fill it to the appropriate level. Since 0.375 is three-eighths of a cup, you can measure half a cup and then remove a tablespoon to get close, but using a scale is best for precision.

Understanding these variations helps you adjust measurements accordingly, ensuring your air fryer dishes turn out perfectly every time. It is always a good idea to refer to specific recipe instructions or use a scale for the most accurate results.</p>
<p>When cooking with an air fryer, the type of rice you use can also impact cooking times and liquid ratios.

Tomato paste is much more concentrated, so you'd need about 3 times the amount of tomato sauce to match the flavour intensity of 0.66 cup (5.28 ounces) of tomato paste.

If you notice your mixture seems too thick or thin after measuring 0.66 cup, you can adjust with small amounts of water or additional paste."

    "@type": "Answer",
    "text": "The 0.66 cup measurement (5.28 ounces) often comes from using part of a standard can. Many tomato paste cans contain 6 ounces, so 0.66 cup uses most of the can while leaving a small amount for other uses. This measurement also provides the right balance of flavour without overwhelming other ingredients in air fryer recipes."

<p>0.66 cup of tomato paste equals approximately 5.28 ounces. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements can make or break a dish. Whether you're making a rich pasta sauce or a flavourful marinade, knowing how to convert 0.66 cup of tomato paste to ounces ensures consistency. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we understand the importance of accurate measurements for perfect results every time.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on precise ingredient ratios to achieve even cooking and optimal texture. Using 0.66 cup of tomato paste without converting to ounces could throw off your recipe. Too much tomato paste can make dishes overly thick, while too little might leave them lacking flavour. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> helps you avoid these pitfalls by providing reliable measurements for all your cooking needs.</p>  

<p>Tomato paste is a concentrated ingredient, so small measurement errors can have a big impact. For example, if your air fryer recipe calls for 0.66 cup of tomato paste in ounces, using the wrong amount could affect cooking time and moisture levels. That's why we recommend using kitchen scales for the most accurate results, especially when working with dense ingredients like tomato paste.</p>  

<h3>How to measure 0.66 cup of tomato paste without scales</h3>  
<p>If you don't have kitchen scales, you can still measure 0.66 cup of tomato paste accurately. One standard US cup equals 8 ounces, so 0.66 cup would be roughly two-thirds of that amount. For UK measurements, it's important to note that 1 UK cup is slightly larger at 10 ounces, but most recipes on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>our recipe page</a> use the US standard for consistency.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for 0.66 cup of tomato paste in air fryer recipes</h2>  
<p>Many delicious air fryer dishes call for around 0.66 cup (5.28 ounces) of tomato paste. This amount is perfect for creating rich bases in dishes like air fryer meatballs, stuffed peppers, or homemade pizza sauces. The concentrated flavour of tomato paste works particularly well in the air fryer, where quick cooking times help preserve its vibrant taste.</p>  

<p>When converting 0.66 cup of tomato paste to ounces for international recipes, remember that measurement standards vary. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable recipe category</a> includes many dishes where precise tomato paste measurements are crucial. Whether you're making ratatouille or stuffed mushrooms, getting your 0.66 cup to ounces conversion right ensures authentic flavours every time.</p>  

<h3>Storing leftover tomato paste after measuring 0.66 cup</h3>  
<p>After measuring out your 0.66 cup (5.28 ounces) of tomato paste, you might have leftovers. Proper storage is key to maintaining freshness. We recommend transferring unused tomato paste to an airtight container and refrigerating it. For longer storage, portion it into ice cube trays and freeze - each cube is typically about 1 ounce, making future 0.66 cup measurements even easier.</p>  

<h2>Adjusting air fryer recipes based on tomato paste measurements</h2>  
<p>When a recipe calls for 0.66 cup of tomato paste in ounces (5.28 oz), but you only have a smaller can, you might need to adjust other ingredients. The high concentration of tomato paste means you can't simply substitute tomato sauce or crushed tomatoes without altering liquid ratios. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning guide</a> also reminds you that tomato paste can be sticky - always clean your air fryer basket promptly after cooking with it.</p>  

<p>Understanding how 0.66 cup of tomato paste converts to ounces (5.28 oz) helps when scaling recipes up or down. If you're cooking for fewer people, you might only need half this amount (2.64 ounces). Conversely, for larger batches, you might need to double it to 10.56 ounces (1.32 cups). Precise conversions ensure your air fryer dishes turn out perfectly every time.</p>

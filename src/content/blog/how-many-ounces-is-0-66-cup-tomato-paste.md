<p>Tomato paste is a concentrated ingredient, so small measurement errors can have a big impact. For example, if your air fryer recipe calls for 0.66 cup of tomato paste in ounces, using the wrong amount could affect cooking time and moisture levels. That's why we recommend using kitchen scales for the most accurate results, especially when working with dense ingredients like tomato paste.</p>  

<h3>How to measure 0.66 cup of tomato paste without scales</h3>  
<p>If you don't have kitchen scales, you can still measure 0.66 cup of tomato paste accurately. One standard US cup equals 8 ounces, so 0.66 cup would be roughly two-thirds of that amount. For UK measurements, it's important to note that 1 UK cup is slightly larger at 10 ounces, but most recipes on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>our recipe page</a> use the US standard for consistency.</p>

Grams eliminate inconsistencies from how the sauce fills the spoon, ensuring your marinades and glazes taste perfect every time."

<p>1.5 tablespoons (tbsp) of fish sauce is approximately 22.5 grams. This measurement is handy when you're preparing air fryer recipes that require precise amounts of fish sauce for the perfect balance of flavour. Whether you're marinating chicken or adding a umami kick to vegetables, knowing this conversion ensures your dish turns out just right.</p>

<h2>Why converting tablespoons to grams matters</h2>
<p>When cooking with an air fryer, accuracy can make all the difference. Fish sauce is a potent ingredient, and even a small variation can alter the taste of your dish. Converting 1.5 tbsp of fish sauce to grams (22.5g) ensures consistency, especially if you're scaling recipes up or down. For more air fryer measurement tips, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>
<p>Many air fryer recipes, like those for marinated shrimp or crispy tofu, rely on precise measurements. Using grams instead of tablespoons eliminates guesswork, giving you reliable results every time. If you're new to air fryer cooking, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipes section</a> has plenty of inspiration to get you started.</p>

<h2>How to measure fish sauce accurately</h2>
<p>To measure 1.5 tbsp of fish sauce (22.5g), use a standard UK tablespoon and fill it to the brim. For even greater precision, a digital kitchen scale is ideal. Simply tare your scale with the container on it, then pour the fish sauce until it reaches 22.5 grams. This method is perfect for recipes like air fryer salmon or Thai-inspired dishes.</p>

<h3>Using fish sauce in air fryer recipes</h3>
<p>Fish sauce adds depth to many air fryer dishes, from glazed chicken wings to vegetable stir-fries. Since 1.5 tbsp equals 22.5 grams, you can easily adjust quantities without compromising flavour. Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipes</a> for ideas on incorporating fish sauce into marinades.</p>

<h2>Common conversions for fish sauce</h2>
<p>Beyond 1.5 tbsp, here are other useful fish sauce conversions: 1 tbsp = 15g, 2 tbsp = 30g, and 3 tbsp = 45g. These measurements are invaluable when adapting recipes for your air fryer. For instance, if a recipe calls for 3 tbsp (45g) of fish sauce but you're cooking for one, halving it to 1.5 tbsp (22.5g) is straightforward.</p>
<p>Remember, fish sauce is salty, so balancing it with other ingredients is key. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable recipes</a> often pair it with lime or sugar to create harmonious flavours. Proper measurement ensures your air fryer dishes are perfectly seasoned every time.</p>

<h3>Storing and handling fish sauce</h3>
<p>After measuring out your 1.5 tbsp (22.5g) of fish sauce, always seal the bottle tightly and store it in a cool, dark place. This preserves its quality for future air fryer recipes.

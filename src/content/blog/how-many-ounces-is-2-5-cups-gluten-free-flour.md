<p>2.5 cups of gluten-free flour equals approximately 10.6 ounces (300 grams). This conversion is essential for air fryer baking, where precision ensures perfect texture and rise. Whether you’re making cakes, cookies, or bread, knowing the exact weight helps avoid dense or crumbly results.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate flour measurements matter in air fryer baking</h2>  
<p>Gluten-free flour behaves differently than wheat flour, so measuring by weight (ounces) is far more reliable than volume (cups). Air fryers circulate hot air rapidly, meaning doughs and batters must be perfectly balanced to cook evenly. Too much flour can lead to dry, dense bakes, while too little may cause spreading or collapsing. For consistent results, always weigh your ingredients—especially when adapting recipes from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>traditional oven methods</a> to air fryer cooking.</p>  

<p>Many UK bakers prefer ounces for precision, and digital kitchen scales are a worthwhile investment. If your recipe calls for 2.5 cups of gluten-free flour, simply measure out 10.6 ounces (or 300 grams) for foolproof results. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for other common ingredient swaps.</p>  

<h3>How to measure gluten-free flour correctly</h3>  
<p>To avoid packing too much flour into your cup, fluff the flour with a spoon before gently scooping it into the measuring cup. Level it off with a straight edge, but remember: weighing is always best. For popular air fryer bakes like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>gluten-free cakes</a>, even a slight variance can affect texture.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for 2.5 cups of gluten-free flour</h2>  
<p>This quantity is ideal for small-batch baking in an air fryer. You might use it for a dozen cookies, a single-layer cake, or a loaf of gluten-free bread. Since air fryers cook faster than conventional ovens, recipes often require slight adjustments. For example, reduce liquid slightly to account for less evaporation, and preheat your air fryer for even baking.</p>  

<p>If you’re making <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cookies>gluten-free cookies</a>, 2.5 cups of flour (10.6 oz) typically yields 18–24 portions. For muffins or cupcakes, it’s enough for 9–12 standard cases. Always check your specific recipe, though, as some blends (like almond or coconut flour) differ in density. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> library has tailored guides for various flour types.</p>  

<h3>Converting other gluten-free flour amounts</h3>  
<p>Need to scale up or down? Here’s a quick reference: 1 cup of gluten-free flour ≈ 4.25 oz (120g), so 3 cups would be 12.75 oz (360g). Keep a note of these equivalents for stress-free baking. If you’re reheating gluten-free goods, like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/frozen-foods>frozen bread</a>, a lower temperature (160°C) prevents drying out.</p>

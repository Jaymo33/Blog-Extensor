This is especially true for air fryer recipes, where precise measurements ensure even cooking. If you're whipping up a batch of air-fried pancakes, for example, 160 ml of milk (about 0.68 cups) is a common measurement.

<h3>UK vs. US Cup Measurements</h3>  
<p>In the UK, a standard cup holds 250 ml, while in the US, it's 240 ml. This means 160 ml of milk is slightly more in a UK cup (0.68 cups) compared to a US cup (0.67 cups). Though the difference seems small, it can affect recipes requiring precision, like custards or batters. Always check whether your recipe uses UK or US measurements for the best results.</p>

<h2>Tips for Measuring Milk Accurately</h2>  
<p>For the most precise measurement, use a liquid measuring cup rather than dry cups. Fill it to the 160 ml mark or just below the 0.68-cup line (UK). If you don’t have measuring tools, remember that 160 ml is roughly two-thirds of a standard cup.

<p>When substituting milk in recipes, consider the fat content—whole, semi-skimmed, or skimmed milk can affect texture. For air fryer baking, whole milk often yields richer results. If using plant-based milk, check its consistency, as some varieties may require slight adjustments to the 160 ml measurement.</p>

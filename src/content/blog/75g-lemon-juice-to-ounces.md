<p>75g of lemon juice equals approximately 2.65 ounces. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements matter. Whether you’re marinating chicken or whipping up a zesty dessert, knowing how to convert grams to ounces ensures perfect results. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we make conversions easy so you can focus on cooking.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate lemon juice measurements matter</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of lemon juice can make or break a dish. Too little, and your marinade lacks tang; too much, and it overpowers other flavours. For air fryer recipes, precision ensures even cooking and balanced taste. A dish like lemon garlic shrimp or citrus-glazed salmon relies on exact measurements. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipes</a> for inspiration on using lemon juice perfectly.</p>  

<p>Lemon juice also affects texture, especially in baked goods. In air fryer cakes or cookies, acidity interacts with baking agents. Converting 75g of lemon juice to ounces (2.65 oz) helps maintain consistency. Whether you’re following a UK or international recipe, this conversion keeps things simple. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> has more handy tips.</p>  

<h3>How to measure lemon juice accurately</h3>  
<p>For best results, use a digital kitchen scale set to grams. If you only have measuring cups, 75g of lemon juice is roughly 1/3 cup. Freshly squeezed juice is ideal, but bottled works too—just check for additives. Always measure at room temperature for consistency. Need more air fryer tips?

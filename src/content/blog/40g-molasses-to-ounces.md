<p>40g of molasses equals approximately 1.41 ounces. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements can make or break your dish. Whether you’re making gingerbread, barbecue glaze, or sticky desserts, knowing how to convert grams to ounces ensures perfect results every time. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we help you master these conversions for flawless cooking.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on precise ingredient ratios to achieve crispy, evenly cooked dishes. Too much or too little molasses can alter the texture and flavour of your recipe. For example, a sticky glaze for air-fried chicken wings needs the right balance of sweetness and thickness. If you’re using a recipe from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>our collection</a>, converting 40g of molasses to ounces ensures consistency.</p>  

<p>Molasses is a dense liquid, so measuring by weight (grams) is more accurate than volume (cups or tablespoons). A digital kitchen scale is your best friend here. If your recipe calls for 40g of molasses, you’ll need roughly 1.41 ounces. This small but critical detail can elevate your air fryer dishes from good to great.</p>  

<h2>How to measure 40g of molasses without a scale</h2>  
<p>Don’t have a kitchen scale? No problem. You can still measure 40g of molasses using common household tools. One tablespoon of molasses weighs about 20g, so two tablespoons will give you roughly 40g (or 1.41 ounces). For smaller quantities, a teaspoon holds around 7g, so you’d need about 5.5 teaspoons to reach 40g.</p>  

<p>Keep in mind that molasses is sticky, so lightly greasing your measuring spoon with oil can help it slide off easily. This trick is especially handy when prepping ingredients for air fryer recipes like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>desserts</a> or marinades. Accuracy matters, but a little flexibility won’t hurt—just aim for close approximations if you’re without a scale.</p>  

<h3>Common recipes using 40g of molasses</h3>  
<p>Molasses adds depth to both sweet and savoury dishes. In air fryer cooking, 40g of molasses might be used in a glaze for pork ribs, a marinade for tofu, or even a batch of chewy ginger cookies. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a> for other common ingredient measurements to pair with your molasses.</p>  

<h3>Tips for working with molasses in air fryers</h3>  
<p>Molasses can caramelise quickly in an air fryer, so watch cooking times closely. For glazes, brush them on during the last few minutes of cooking to avoid burning. If you’re using molasses in batters or doughs, mix it thoroughly to ensure even distribution. And don’t forget to clean your air fryer basket promptly—molasses residue can be stubborn. Our guide on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning your air fryer</a> has you covered.</p>

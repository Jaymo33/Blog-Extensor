<p>235°C converts to Gas Mark 9 in UK ovens and air fryers. This high heat is perfect for roasting meats, baking pastries, or creating crispy textures in your air fryer. Whether you're following a recipe from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> or adapting conventional oven instructions, knowing this conversion ensures consistent results.</p>

<h2>Understanding 235 C to Gas Mark Conversion</h2>
<p>The Gas Mark scale is a British measurement system for oven temperatures, where each mark represents a specific temperature range. Gas Mark 9 corresponds to 230-240°C, making 235°C sit comfortably in the middle of this bracket. When converting 235 celsius to gas mark, you'll find most modern ovens allow precise setting to this exact temperature.</p>
<p>For air fryer users, 235 degrees c to gas mark conversions matter when adapting traditional recipes. Many air fryers don't use Gas Mark settings, but understanding the equivalent helps when cross-referencing cooking times. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more temperature adjustments across different appliances.</p>

<h3>Why 235°C Matters in Cooking</h3>
<p>This temperature hits the sweet spot for many cooking techniques. At 235 c in gas mark for oven baking, you achieve perfect browning without burning - ideal for puff pastry, Yorkshire puddings, or roasted vegetables. In air fryers, 235 c to gas mark uk settings create that desirable crispiness for chips or chicken wings.</p>

<h2>Using 235 C to Gas Mark in Different Appliances</h2>
<p>Traditional gas ovens set to Gas Mark 9 will maintain 235°C, though some fluctuation is normal. Electric fan ovens at 235 c fan oven to gas mark settings may cook slightly faster due to circulating air. Modern combi ovens often display both Celsius and Gas Mark, eliminating conversion guesswork.</p>
<p>Air fryers typically use digital temperature controls, so you'd set them directly to 235°C rather than Gas Mark. However, knowing the gas mark equivalent of 235 c helps when using older cookbooks or handwritten recipes. For perfect air fryer results at this temperature, browse our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipes</a> designed for high-heat cooking.</p>

<h3>Adjusting Cooking Times at 235°C</h3>

<h2>Common Dishes Cooked at 235 C to Gas Mark</h2>

<p>1.33 cups of chopped walnuts equals approximately 5.3 ounces (150 grams). This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precision ensures perfect texture and flavour. Whether you're baking walnut-crusted chicken or whipping up a quick dessert, knowing the exact weight saves time and guarantees consistency.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on even heat distribution, so ingredient quantities must be precise. Too many walnuts could overcrowd the basket, while too few might leave your dish lacking crunch. For recipes like air-fried walnut-crusted salmon or walnut-studded cookies, 1.33 cups (5.3 oz) ensures balanced results. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more handy measurement tips.</p>  

<p>Chopped walnuts vary slightly in density based on how finely they're cut. If you're using pre-chopped walnuts from a UK supermarket, 1.33 cups will typically weigh 5.3 oz. For whole walnuts you chop yourself, lightly pack them into the measuring cup for the most accurate result. Need recipe ideas? Browse our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>walnut-friendly air fryer recipes</a>.</p>  

<h3>How to measure chopped walnuts correctly</h3>  
<p>Use a dry measuring cup and spoon the walnuts in without packing too tightly. Level off the top with a knife for an exact 1.33 cups. If your air fryer recipe calls for ounces instead of cups, a kitchen scale is your best friend—5.3 oz will give you perfect proportions every time.</p>  

<h2>Common recipes using 1.33 cups of chopped walnuts</h2>  
<p>This quantity works beautifully in air fryer granola, walnut-crusted tofu, or as a topping for baked apples. The nutty crunch adds texture to everything from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>air fryer desserts</a> to savoury crusts. Since walnuts toast quickly in the air fryer, they're ideal for last-minute garnishes too.</p>  

<p>For meal preppers, 1.33 cups (5.3 oz) of chopped walnuts divides neatly into portions. Try mixing them into <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/meal-prep>air fryer meal prep</a> dishes like grain bowls or stuffed peppers. Remember to store unused walnuts in an airtight container—they’ll stay fresh for weeks!</p>

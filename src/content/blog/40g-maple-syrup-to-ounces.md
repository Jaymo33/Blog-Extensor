<p>40g of maple syrup equals approximately 1.41 ounces. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements can make or break your dish. Whether you're glazing salmon, sweetening desserts, or drizzling over breakfast treats, knowing the exact weight ensures perfect results every time.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Cooking with an air fryer requires precision, especially when dealing with sticky ingredients like maple syrup. Too much or too little can affect texture, caramelisation, and overall flavour. For example, a <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>maple-glazed salmon</a> needs just the right balance to avoid burning or undercooking. That’s why converting 40g of maple syrup to ounces (1.41 oz) is so useful.</p>  
<p>Air fryers circulate hot air rapidly, which means syrups and sugars can behave differently compared to conventional ovens. A slight mismeasurement could lead to uneven cooking or overly sticky results.

<h2>How to Measure 40g of Maple Syrup Accurately</h2>  
<p>Measuring sticky liquids like maple syrup can be tricky. The best method is to use a digital kitchen scale for grams or a liquid measuring cup for ounces. If you don’t have a scale, remember that 1 tablespoon of maple syrup weighs roughly 20g, so 40g would be about 2 tablespoons. However, for baking or glazing in your air fryer, weighing is always more precise.</p>  

<h3>Common Uses for 40g of Maple Syrup in Air Fryer Recipes</h3>  
<p>This small but impactful amount of maple syrup is perfect for glazing proteins like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>air fryer chicken</a> or drizzling over roasted vegetables. It’s also ideal for sweetening batters or sauces without overpowering other flavours. For a quick dessert, try brushing 40g (1.41 oz) of maple syrup over air-fried apple slices.</p>  

<h2>Converting Other Maple Syrup Amounts</h2>  
<p>If your recipe calls for more or less than 40g, here’s a quick reference: 20g = 0.71 oz, 60g = 2.12 oz, and 100g = 3.53 oz.

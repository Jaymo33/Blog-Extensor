<p>40g of tahini is approximately 1.41 ounces. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements can make all the difference. Whether you're making a tahini dressing or incorporating it into a marinade, knowing the exact weight ensures consistency in your dishes. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we understand the importance of accurate measurements for perfect results every time.</p>  

<h2>Why Convert 40g of Tahini to Ounces?</h2>  
<p>Many UK recipes, especially those for air fryers, use grams as the standard unit of measurement. However, some kitchen scales or international recipes might list tahini in ounces. Converting 40g tahini to ounces (1.41 oz) ensures you’re using the right amount for your dish. This is particularly useful for recipes like tahini-glazed salmon or roasted vegetables, where balance is key.</p>  

<p>If you’re exploring global recipes, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> can help you switch between units effortlessly. Whether you’re cooking for one or meal prepping, precise measurements guarantee delicious results.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure 40g of Tahini Accurately</h3>  
<p>Using a digital kitchen scale is the easiest way to measure 40g of tahini. Simply place your container on the scale, tare it to zero, and spoon in the tahini until you hit 40g. If you don’t have a scale, 40g is roughly two tablespoons, but this can vary slightly depending on the tahini’s consistency.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for 40g of Tahini in Air Fryer Recipes</h2>  
<p>Tahini adds a rich, nutty flavour to many dishes. With 40g (1.41 oz), you can make a creamy tahini sauce for air-fried falafel or a glaze for chicken. It’s also a key ingredient in hummus, which pairs perfectly with air-fried pita chips. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipes section</a> for more inspiration.</p>  

<p>For those who love meal prep, tahini-based dressings can be stored for days. A 40g portion is ideal for single servings or small batches. Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable recipes</a> to see how tahini can elevate simple ingredients.</p>  

<h3>Tips for Storing Tahini After Measuring</h3>  
<p>After measuring 40g of tahini, ensure the rest is stored properly to maintain freshness. Keep it in an airtight container in the fridge, and give it a good stir before use, as separation is natural. Proper storage means your tahini will last for months, ready for your next air fryer creation.</p>  

<p>Cleaning up after using tahini can be tricky due to its oily texture. Our guide on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner</a> offers tips for keeping your appliance spotless, even after sticky ingredients like tahini.</p>

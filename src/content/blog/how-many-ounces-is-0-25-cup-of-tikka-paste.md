<p>0.25 cup of tikka paste equals approximately 2 ounces (oz). This conversion ensures your air fryer recipes, like marinated chicken or spiced vegetables, turn out perfectly every time. Whether you're using a UK or US measuring cup, this weight remains consistent for tikka paste, a staple in many dishes featured on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Getting the right amount of tikka paste is crucial for balanced flavours in your air fryer dishes. Too little, and your meal might lack depth; too much, and it could overpower other ingredients. For recipes like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer chicken tikka</a>, 0.25 cup (2 oz) of paste is often the sweet spot. This measurement ensures even coating without excess moisture, which can affect crispiness.</p>  

<p>Many air fryer enthusiasts rely on conversions like 0.25 cup to ounces to avoid guesswork. Unlike baking, where precision is non-negotiable, air frying allows slight flexibility—but sticking to recommended amounts guarantees consistency. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for other common ingredient swaps.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure 0.25 Cup of Tikka Paste</h3>  
<p>Use a liquid measuring cup for sticky tikka paste, scraping the sides to ensure an exact 0.25 cup. For weight, a kitchen scale set to ounces will confirm you’ve hit the 2 oz mark. If your recipe calls for 0.25 cup of tikka paste but you’re scaling up, remember that 1 cup equals 8 oz—simple maths keeps your dish on track.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for 0.25 Cup of Tikka Paste</h2>  
<p>This quantity is ideal for marinating 2–3 chicken breasts or a tray of <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>air-fried vegetables</a>. The concentrated flavour of tikka paste means a little goes a long way, especially in the air fryer’s intense heat. For larger batches, like meal prepping <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken tikka wraps</a>, double or triple the amount while maintaining the 0.25 cup-to-2 oz ratio.</p>  

<p>Some cooks dilute 0.25 cup (2 oz) of paste with yogurt or oil for a milder taste. If experimenting, note that added liquids may require adjusting cooking times. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner guide</a> also helps tackle any sticky residue left behind by saucy marinades.</p>  

<h3>Converting Other Tikka Paste Amounts to Ounces</h3>  
<p>Need 0.5 cup? That’s 4 oz. Just 1 tablespoon? Roughly 0.5 oz. Bookmark these conversions for quick reference when adapting recipes. Most UK tikka paste brands list both metric and imperial weights, but when in doubt, 0.25 cup = 2 oz is your go-to.</p>

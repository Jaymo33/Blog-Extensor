<p>230 fan oven converts to approximately 210°C in a conventional oven. This 20°C reduction accounts for the efficient heat distribution of fan-assisted cooking. Whether you're baking, roasting, or using your air fryer, understanding this conversion ensures perfect results every time.</p>

<h2>Understanding Fan Oven Temperatures</h2>
<p>Fan ovens circulate hot air using a built-in fan, cooking food more evenly and quickly than conventional ovens. The 230 fan oven setting is particularly common for roasting meats and baking crusty bread. When converting to a conventional oven, you'll need to adjust both temperature and cooking time for best results.</p>
<p>Many modern recipes specify fan oven temperatures, but older cookbooks and some <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> still use conventional oven settings. Our conversion chart at <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> makes these adjustments simple, whether you're cooking a Sunday roast or batch of cookies.</p>

<h2>Why Convert 230 Fan to Conventional?</h2>
<p>There are several reasons you might need to convert 230 fan oven to conventional oven temperatures. Perhaps you're using an older oven without a fan function, or maybe you're adapting a recipe for your air fryer. Some bakers also find that certain delicate baked goods, like soufflés or custards, benefit from conventional oven heat.</p>
<p>The general rule is to reduce the temperature by 20°C when converting from fan to conventional. So 230 fan becomes 210 conventional, 200 fan becomes 180 conventional, and so on. This adjustment compensates for the more intense, direct heat of fan-assisted cooking.</p>

<h2>Practical Conversion Examples</h2>
<h3>Roasting Meats</h3>
<p>When roasting chicken or beef at 230 fan oven, converting to 210 conventional ensures the outside doesn't burn before the inside cooks through. This is especially important when using an air fryer, where the compact space intensifies heat circulation.</p>

<h3>Baking Bread and Pastries</h3>
<p>Crusty bread and flaky pastries often call for 230 fan oven temperatures. The converted 210 conventional setting gives similar results, though you may need to extend cooking time by 5-10 minutes. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/bread>bread recipes</a> for perfect results every time.</p>

<h2>Air Fryer Conversion Tips</h2>
<p>Air fryers essentially work like mini fan ovens, so the 230 fan oven to conventional oven conversion applies similarly. However, because air fryers are more efficient, you might need to reduce temperatures further or shorten cooking times. Always check food a few minutes before the recipe suggests.</p>
<p>For frozen foods like chips or chicken nuggets, the 230 fan oven equivalent works well in air fryers. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/frozen-foods>frozen food recipes</a> include specific timing adjustments for perfect crispiness without burning.</p>

<h2>Common Conversion Mistakes</h2>
<p>One frequent error is forgetting to adjust cooking times along with temperatures. While 230 fan converts to 210 conventional, foods will generally take 10-15% longer to cook in a conventional oven. Another mistake is assuming all ovens are perfectly calibrated - an oven thermometer is a baker's best friend.</p>
<p>When using an air fryer, remember that its small capacity means heat builds up quickly. The <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> team recommends checking food frequently until you're familiar with your specific model's characteristics.</p>

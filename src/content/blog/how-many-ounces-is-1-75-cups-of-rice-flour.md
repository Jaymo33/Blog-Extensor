<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>

<p>Many home cooks rely on volume measurements like cups, but weight (ounces or grams) is far more accurate. This is especially true for ingredients like rice flour, which can settle or vary in density. If you’re serious about air fryer baking, investing in a kitchen scale is a game-changer. You’ll find plenty of inspiration for recipes using rice flour in our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipes section</a>.</p>  

<h3>How to measure rice flour correctly</h3>  
<p>To measure 1.75 cups of rice flour accurately, fluff the flour first with a spoon to aerate it. Then, lightly spoon it into a measuring cup and level it off with a straight edge. Avoid packing the flour down, as this can lead to using more than needed. For the most precise results, weigh it on a scale—7.4 ounces is your target for 1.75 cups.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for rice flour in air fryers</h2>  
<p>Rice flour is a versatile ingredient in air fryer cooking. It’s often used for crispy coatings on chicken, fish, or vegetables, providing a lighter texture than wheat flour.

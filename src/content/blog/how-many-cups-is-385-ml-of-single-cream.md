<p>385 ml of single cream is approximately 1.63 cups. This conversion is essential for precise baking and cooking, especially when using an air fryer where measurements matter. Whether you're whipping up a creamy sauce or a decadent dessert, knowing this conversion ensures your recipes turn out perfectly every time.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter</h2>
<p>Using the right amount of single cream can make or break a recipe. Too little, and your dish might lack richness; too much, and it could become overly heavy. For air fryer recipes, precise measurements are even more critical due to the appliance's rapid cooking style. A slight deviation can affect texture and taste.</p>
<p>At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we emphasise the importance of accurate conversions. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> is a handy tool for quick reference. Whether you're converting ml to cups or adjusting portion sizes, it’s a lifesaver for home cooks.</p>

<h2>How to Measure 385 ml of Single Cream</h2>
<p>Measuring liquids like single cream can be tricky, but with the right tools, it’s straightforward. A liquid measuring cup with clear ml and cup markings is ideal. Pour the cream slowly to the 385 ml line, then check the corresponding cup measurement.</p>
<p>If you don’t have a measuring cup, a standard UK metric cup holds 250 ml, so 385 ml would be roughly 1.5 cups plus a tablespoon. For US cups, which are slightly smaller at 240 ml, it’s closer to 1.6 cups. Always double-check for accuracy.</p>

<h3>Using 385 ml of Single Cream in Air Fryer Recipes</h3>
<p>Single cream is a versatile ingredient in air fryer cooking. From creamy pasta bakes to luscious desserts, it adds richness without overpowering other flavours. Try it in our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> for a delicious twist.</p>

<h2>Common Recipes Using 385 ml of Single Cream</h2>
<p>Many recipes call for around 385 ml of single cream. Classic dishes like carbonara, custards, and creamy soups often use this amount. In the air fryer, single cream can elevate dishes like mac and cheese or bread pudding.</p>
<p>For dessert lovers, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert category</a> features plenty of recipes where 385 ml of single cream shines. Whether you're baking or making a sauce, this measurement is a kitchen staple.</p>

<h3>Tips for Storing Single Cream</h3>
<p>Once opened, single cream should be used within a few days. Store it in the coldest part of your fridge, ideally at the back. If you’ve measured out 385 ml but don’t need it all, freeze the excess in an airtight container for later use.</p>

<h2>Converting Other Cream Measurements</h2>
<p>If you’re working with different amounts, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a> can help. For example, 200 ml of single cream is roughly 0.85 cups, while 500 ml is about 2.1 cups. Bookmark it for quick access during cooking.</p>

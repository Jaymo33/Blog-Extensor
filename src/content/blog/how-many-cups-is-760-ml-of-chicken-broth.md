<p>760 ml of chicken broth equals approximately 3.2 cups in the US or 3.3 cups in the UK. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes, where precise measurements can make or break a dish. Whether you're making a hearty soup or a flavourful risotto, knowing how to convert 760 ml of chicken broth to cups ensures consistency. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we focus on making cooking conversions simple for home chefs.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>
<p>Air fryers rely on even heat distribution, so using the right amount of liquid is crucial. Too much chicken broth can make dishes soggy, while too little may dry them out. Converting 760 ml of chicken broth to cups helps maintain balance in recipes like casseroles or braised meats. For more air fryer measurement tips, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a>.</p>

<p>Many air fryer recipes, especially those for soups or stews, call for chicken broth. Knowing that 760 ml of chicken broth is roughly 3.2 US cups simplifies scaling recipes. If you're adapting a family favourite, this conversion ensures you won’t over or under-season your dish. Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a> for inspiration.</p>

<h3>US vs. UK Cup Measurements for Chicken Broth</h3>
<p>In the US, 1 cup equals 240 ml, so 760 ml of chicken broth is about 3.2 cups. In the UK, where 1 cup is 250 ml, 760 ml converts to 3.3 cups. This small difference matters in baking or slow-cooked air fryer dishes. Always check which measurement system your recipe uses to avoid mistakes.</p>

<h2>How to Measure 760 ml of Chicken Broth Without a Scale</h2>
<p>If you don’t have a measuring jug, use standard cups to portion 760 ml of chicken broth. Fill a US cup three times (720 ml) and add two tablespoons (40 ml) to reach 760 ml. For UK cups, measure three full cups (750 ml) and add two teaspoons (10 ml). This method works well for air fryer recipes requiring precision.</p>

<p>For dishes like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken-based meals</a>, accurate broth measurements enhance flavour. Too much liquid can dilute spices, while too little may leave meat tough. If you’re using store-bought broth, check the label—some brands list both ml and cup measurements for convenience.</p>

<h3>Common Recipes Using 760 ml of Chicken Broth</h3>
<p>Many air fryer recipes, such as creamy risottos or braised vegetables, use 760 ml of chicken broth. This quantity is ideal for serving four people, making it perfect for family dinners. Visit <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> for recipes tailored to this measurement, like our herbed chicken casserole.</p>

<h2>Tips for Storing Leftover Chicken Broth</h2>
<p>If your recipe doesn’t use all 760 ml of chicken broth, store leftovers properly. Pour unused broth into an airtight container and refrigerate for up to three days. Alternatively, freeze it in ice cube trays for easy portioning in future air fryer recipes. For more storage hacks, see our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning and maintenance guide</a>.</p>

<p>Leftover broth can elevate simple dishes—use it to cook grains or deglaze your air fryer basket after roasting meats. Just remember that 760 ml of chicken broth equals about 3.2 cups, so adjust recipes accordingly. This ensures you never waste a drop of this versatile ingredient.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>
<p>Air fryers rely on precise measurements to deliver perfectly cooked meals. Too much or too little liquid, like beef stock, can affect texture and flavour. For example, if you’re making a beef stew or gravy in your air fryer, 2.5 cups of beef stock (591.47 ml) ensures the right balance of moisture and richness.

<p>Many air fryer recipes, especially those involving sauces or broths, require exact liquid measurements. Whether you’re using UK or US cup measurements, the ml equivalent remains the same. This precision is crucial for dishes like air-fried beef casseroles or braised meats, where the stock’s volume directly impacts cooking time and outcome.</p>

<h2>How to Measure 2.5 Cups of Beef Stock Correctly</h2>
<p>To measure 2.5 cups of beef stock accurately, use a liquid measuring jug with clear ml and cup markings. Pour the stock slowly to avoid spills and check the measurement at eye level.

<p>While the UK and US use slightly different cup sizes (284 ml vs. 240 ml per cup), the standard conversion for 2.5 cups of beef stock remains 591.47 ml.

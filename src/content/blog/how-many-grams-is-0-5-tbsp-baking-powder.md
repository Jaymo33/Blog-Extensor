<p>0.5 tbsp of baking powder equals approximately 7 grams. This conversion is essential for air fryer baking, where precision ensures the perfect rise and texture. Whether you’re whipping up cakes, muffins, or even savoury dishes, knowing the exact weight of 0.5 tbsp baking powder in grams eliminates guesswork.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer baking</h2>  
<p>Baking powder is a leavening agent, and even small discrepancies can affect your air fryer recipes. Too much can leave a bitter taste, while too little may result in dense, flat bakes. For consistent results, always measure 0.5 tbsp of baking powder as 7 grams. This precision is especially crucial for air fryer cakes and batters, where heat distribution differs from conventional ovens.</p>

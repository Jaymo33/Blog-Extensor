<p>285 ml of condensed milk is approximately 1.2 cups in standard US measurements or 1.14 cups in UK metric cups. This conversion is essential for baking and air fryer recipes where precision matters. Whether you're making a creamy dessert or a rich sauce, knowing the exact measurement ensures perfect results every time.</p>  

<h2>Understanding Condensed Milk Measurements</h2>  
<p>Condensed milk is a staple in many recipes, from cakes to air fryer desserts. Its thick, sweet consistency means accurate measurements are crucial. A 285 ml tin of condensed milk is a common size in the UK, but recipes often call for cup measurements. Converting ml to cups avoids guesswork and guarantees consistency in your cooking.</p>  
<p>For those using an air fryer, precise measurements ensure even cooking and perfect textures. Whether you're making <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer caramel</a> or a no-bake cheesecake, knowing how many cups 285 ml of condensed milk equals saves time and hassle. Check our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a> for other common measurements.</p>  

<h3>US vs. UK Cup Measurements</h3>  
<p>It's important to note that US and UK cup measurements differ slightly. A US cup is 240 ml, while a UK metric cup is 250 ml. This means 285 ml of condensed milk equals 1.2 US cups or 1.14 UK cups. Always check your recipe's origin to ensure accuracy.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Using the correct amount of condensed milk affects texture, sweetness, and overall success in recipes. Too much can make desserts overly sweet or soggy, while too little may result in dry or crumbly outcomes. For air fryer recipes, precise measurements help achieve even browning and perfect consistency.</p>

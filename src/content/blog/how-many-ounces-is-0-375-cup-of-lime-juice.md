For example, a <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>marinade with lime juice</a> needs the right acidity to tenderise meat without overpowering it.

<h2>How to measure 0.375 cup of lime juice</h2>  
<p>Measuring 0.375 cup of lime juice can be tricky if you don't have a 1/3 cup measure. Here's a simple trick: use a 1/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons to get the exact amount. Alternatively, weigh it out—3 ounces on a kitchen scale removes all guesswork. This method is especially useful for sticky ingredients like lime juice.</p>  

<h3>Using a kitchen scale for precision</h3>  
<p>A digital kitchen scale is the most accurate way to measure lime juice. Simply tare your scale with the container, then pour until it hits 3 ounces. This eliminates the need for multiple measuring cups and ensures your <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>lime-marinated chicken</a> turns out perfectly every time.</p>  

<h2>Common recipes using 0.375 cup of lime juice</h2>  
<p>Many air fryer recipes call for 0.375 cup (3 ounces) of lime juice. From zesty dressings to tangy glazes, this measurement pops up frequently. Try it in <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/shrimp>air-fried shrimp tacos</a> or as part of a citrus marinade for vegetables. The bright acidity balances richer flavours beautifully.</p>  
<p>For dessert lovers, 0.375 cup of lime juice is perfect for key lime pie filling or a citrus drizzle cake. The air fryer can even handle baking—just adjust temperatures as needed. Remember, precise measurements ensure your treats rise evenly and taste divine.</p>  

<h3>Storing leftover lime juice</h3>  
<p>If your recipe only uses part of a lime, store the remaining juice in an airtight container. It keeps for about a week in the fridge—perfect for your next <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>air fryer recipe</a>. Freezing in ice cube trays is another great option for longer storage.</p>

<p>131 C in a fan oven is equivalent to approximately 120 C in a conventional oven. This conversion accounts for the efficient heat distribution of fan-assisted cooking, which is why fan ovens often require lower temperatures. If you're using an air fryer, which operates similarly to a fan oven, you can typically set it to the same 131 C for consistent results.

<h2>Understanding Fan Oven Temperatures</h2>  
<p>Fan ovens circulate hot air evenly, allowing for faster and more efficient cooking. This means you often need to reduce the temperature by 10-20 C compared to conventional ovens. At 131 C, a fan oven provides gentle heat ideal for delicate bakes like soufflés or custards. Many modern air fryers mimic this technology, making them perfect for recipes requiring precise temperatures.

<p>When converting 131 C to a fan oven, remember that the reduced temperature doesn’t mean longer cooking times. The circulating air ensures even cooking, so always check your food a few minutes early. This principle applies to air fryers too, which excel at reheating and crisping. If you're unsure about settings, start with 131 C and adjust as needed.</p>  

<h3>Why 131 C Works for Air Fryers</h3>  
<p>Air fryers use rapid air technology, similar to fan ovens, making 131 C an excellent setting for light baking or reheating. This temperature is low enough to prevent burning but high enough to crisp foods like pastries or chicken wings.

<h2>Common Uses for 131 C in Fan Ovens</h2>  
<p>At 131 C, fan ovens are perfect for slow-roasting vegetables or baking delicate desserts. This temperature ensures even cooking without over-browning, making it a favourite for home bakers. Air fryers set to 131 C can achieve similar results, especially for smaller batches.

<p>Another great use for 131 C is proofing dough or melting chocolate gently. The consistent heat prevents scorching, which is crucial for sensitive ingredients. Air fryers with precise temperature controls can replicate these conditions effortlessly. Whether you're baking or reheating, 131 C offers versatility.</p>  

<h3>Tips for Perfect Results at 131 C</h3>  
<p>Always preheat your fan oven or air fryer to 131 C for even cooking. Use a thermometer to verify the temperature if your appliance runs hot or cold. For crispy results, avoid overcrowding the basket or tray. And don’t forget to check out <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> for more expert tips.</p>

<p>100 grams of brown sugar is roughly equivalent to ½ cup when lightly packed. This conversion is essential for baking and air frying, where precision ensures the best results. Whether you're making cookies, cakes, or even glazes for meats, knowing how to measure 100 grams of brown sugar in cups can make all the difference.</p>  

<h2>Understanding Brown Sugar Measurements</h2>  
<p>Brown sugar can vary in density depending on how it's packed. Lightly packed brown sugar will measure differently than firmly packed, which is why weighing it is often more accurate. For 100 grams of brown sugar, the standard conversion is approximately ½ cup in both UK and US measurements. However, slight variations can occur based on moisture content and grain size.</p>  
<p>If you're using an air fryer for baking, precise measurements are even more critical. Too much sugar can cause uneven cooking or overly sweet results.

<h3>UK vs. US Cup Measurements</h3>  
<p>While 100 grams of brown sugar equals roughly ½ cup in both UK and US measurements, it's worth noting that UK cups are slightly larger (284ml vs. 240ml). For most recipes, this difference won't drastically affect the outcome, but for precision baking, sticking to grams is best. If you're adapting a recipe from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>our collection</a>, always double-check the measurements.</p>  

<h2>How to Measure Brown Sugar Correctly</h2>  
<p>To measure 100 grams of brown sugar in cups, lightly spoon the sugar into the cup without packing it down. Level it off with a knife for accuracy. If your recipe calls for firmly packed brown sugar, you may need slightly less than ½ cup to reach 100 grams. A kitchen scale is the most reliable tool for exact measurements.</p>  
<p>Air fryer recipes, like those on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, often require precise sugar amounts to ensure even cooking. Too much sugar can lead to caramelization or burning, especially in smaller air fryer baskets. Always measure carefully for the best results.</p>  

<h3>Converting Other Sugar Amounts</h3>  
<p>If you're working with larger or smaller quantities, here's a quick reference: 50 grams of brown sugar is about ¼ cup, and 200 grams is roughly 1 cup.

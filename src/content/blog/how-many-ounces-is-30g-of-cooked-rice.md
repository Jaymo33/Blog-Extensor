<h2>Why Convert 30g of Cooked Rice to Ounces?</h2>  
<p>Many UK recipes, especially those for air fryers, use grams, while some kitchen scales or older cookbooks might still reference ounces. Converting 30g of cooked rice to ounces (1.06 oz) helps maintain consistency. If you’re meal prepping or adjusting portion sizes, this conversion ensures you don’t over or under-serve.

<p>Air fryers excel at reheating and crisping leftovers, including rice. Knowing the weight in ounces helps when dividing portions for <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a>. Whether you’re making fried rice or a rice-based casserole, precise measurements matter for texture and cooking time.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure 30g of Cooked Rice Accurately</h3>  
<p>Use a digital kitchen scale for the most accurate measurement. Place your bowl on the scale, tare it to zero, then add cooked rice until it reads 30g (or 1.06 oz). If you don’t have a scale, 30g of cooked rice is roughly two heaped tablespoons. For meal prep, consider weighing rice in bulk and dividing it into portions.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for 30g of Cooked Rice in Air Fryers</h2>  
<p>30g of cooked rice is a single serving, ideal for air fryer dishes like crispy rice cakes or stuffed peppers. It’s also perfect for adding to <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable-based recipes</a> for extra bulk. Since air fryers cook quickly, pre-measured portions prevent overcooking or drying out.</p>

Pair it with proteins like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken</a> or tofu for a balanced meal.

<h3>Tips for Cooking Rice in an Air Fryer</h3>

<p>1.25 cups of soy milk equals approximately 10 fluid ounces (UK measurement). This conversion is essential for precise cooking, especially when using an air fryer where measurements can make or break a recipe. Whether you're whipping up a creamy sauce or baking a dairy-free dessert, knowing the exact weight ensures perfect results every time.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on precise ingredient ratios to achieve even cooking and perfect textures. Using the correct amount of soy milk—like 1.25 cups (10 oz)—ensures your recipes turn out as intended. Too much liquid can lead to soggy results, while too little might dry out your dish.

<p>Many air fryer recipes, especially those for cakes or batters, require exact measurements. Soy milk is a popular dairy alternative, and knowing its weight in ounces helps streamline your cooking process. If you're exploring plant-based options, browse our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert recipes</a> for inspiration.</p>  

<h3>How to measure 1.25 cups of soy milk accurately</h3>  
<p>For the most precise measurement, use a liquid measuring cup with clear markings. Fill it to the 1.25-cup line, or measure 10 fluid ounces directly. If you don’t have a measuring cup, a kitchen scale set to ounces will work just as well. Consistency is key, especially for air fryer baking.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for 1.25 cups of soy milk in air fryer recipes</h2>  
<p>This quantity is perfect for recipes like dairy-free pancakes, creamy soups, or even marinades. Soy milk adds moisture without overpowering flavours, making it a versatile ingredient. For savoury dishes, try our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipes</a> that incorporate soy milk for tenderness.</p>  

<p>If you're meal prepping, 1.25 cups (10 oz) of soy milk can be portioned for multiple dishes. From overnight oats to batter for crispy tofu, accurate measurements save time and reduce waste.

<h3>Converting other soy milk quantities</h3>  
<p>If your recipe calls for a different amount, here’s a quick reference: 1 cup of soy milk = 8 oz, and 0.5 cups = 4 oz. Keep these conversions handy for seamless adjustments.

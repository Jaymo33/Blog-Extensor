<p>2.5 tablespoons of plain yogurt is approximately 37.5 grams. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precision matters. Whether you're making a marinade, a batter, or a creamy dip, knowing the exact weight ensures consistent results. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we focus on accuracy to help you achieve the best dishes every time.</p>  

<h2>Why measuring yogurt in grams matters</h2>  
<p>Using grams instead of tablespoons ensures consistency, especially in air fryer cooking. Different brands of yogurt can vary in thickness, which affects volume measurements. Grams provide a universal standard, making recipes foolproof. If you're following a recipe from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>our collection</a>, converting to grams guarantees the right texture and flavour. This is particularly important for baking or marinating meats.</p>  

<p>For example, a marinade with too much yogurt can become overly thick, while too little might not coat properly. By converting 2.5 tbsp of plain yogurt to grams, you eliminate guesswork. This precision is why many professional chefs prefer weight measurements. It’s also handy when scaling recipes up or down. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a> for other common ingredients.</p>  

<h3>How to measure yogurt accurately</h3>  
<p>To measure 2.5 tbsp of plain yogurt in grams, use a digital kitchen scale for the best results. Scoop the yogurt into a measuring spoon, then transfer it to the scale. If you don’t have a scale, remember that 1 tablespoon of plain yogurt weighs roughly 15 grams. This means 2.5 tbsp equals about 37.5 grams. For thicker Greek yogurt, the weight might be slightly higher.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for 2.5 tbsp of plain yogurt</h2>  
<p>This small quantity of yogurt is perfect for air fryer recipes like marinades, dressings, or even baking. A classic use is in tandoori-style chicken, where yogurt tenderises the meat. You’ll find plenty of inspiration in our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipes</a>. Yogurt also works well in batters for crispy coatings, giving a slight tang and moisture.</p>  

<p>Another great application is in dips or sauces, where 2.5 tbsp of plain yogurt adds creaminess without overwhelming other flavours. It’s also a healthy substitute for mayo or sour cream. If you’re meal prepping, precise measurements ensure your dishes turn out perfectly every time. For more ideas, browse our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe section</a>.</p>  

<h3>Tips for storing and handling yogurt</h3>  
<p>Always store plain yogurt in the fridge to maintain freshness. If you’re using it in air fryer recipes, let it come to room temperature first for easier mixing. After measuring, reseal the container tightly to prevent spoilage. For longer storage, consider freezing yogurt in portioned amounts. Just thaw and stir well before use.</p>

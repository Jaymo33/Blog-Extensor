<p>10 ml of heavy cream is equal to approximately 0.042 cups. This small measurement is crucial for precision in baking and air fryer recipes, where even slight variations can affect texture and taste. Whether you're whipping up a creamy sauce or adding richness to desserts, knowing this conversion ensures consistency.</p>

<h2>Understanding the Conversion</h2>  
<p>Converting 10 ml of heavy cream to cups requires knowing the standard measurement equivalents. One cup is roughly 240 ml, so dividing 10 ml by 240 gives you the cup measurement. For those using an air fryer, precise measurements like this help avoid overly dense or runny results.

<p>Heavy cream is thicker than milk, so while the volume conversion is straightforward, the density means it behaves differently in recipes. If you're adapting a recipe from metric to cups, always double-check measurements.

<h3>Why Accuracy Matters</h3>  
<p>In baking, especially with air fryer desserts, 10 ml of heavy cream can make a difference between a perfect custard and a curdled mess. Heavy cream adds richness, so measuring correctly ensures balanced flavours.

<h2>Common Uses for 10 ml of Heavy Cream</h2>  
<p>Though small, 10 ml of heavy cream is often used in recipes where a touch of richness is needed. It’s perfect for enriching scrambled eggs, smoothing out soups, or adding to coffee. In air fryer cooking, it’s great for glazing pastries or mixing into batters.</p>  

<p>If you’re working with frozen ingredients, like our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/frozen-foods>frozen foods recipes</a>, a splash of heavy cream can enhance texture. Always measure carefully to avoid altering the dish’s consistency.

<h3>Measuring Without a Scale</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a measuring jug, 10 ml is roughly two teaspoons. Use a standard teaspoon and fill it just below the rim for accuracy. For larger quantities, remember that 100 ml equals about 0.42 cups—handy for scaling recipes.</p>  

<h2>UK vs. US Cup Measurements</h2>  
<p>While the difference is minimal, UK cups (284 ml) are slightly larger than US cups (240 ml). For 10 ml of heavy cream, the variance is negligible, but it’s worth noting for larger recipes. Always specify which cup measurement your recipe uses to avoid confusion.</p>

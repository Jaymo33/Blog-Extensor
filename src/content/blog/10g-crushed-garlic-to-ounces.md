<p>10g of crushed garlic equals approximately 0.35 ounces. This conversion is essential for precise cooking, especially when using an air fryer where measurements can impact the final dish. Whether you're following a recipe from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> or experimenting with your own creations, knowing this conversion ensures accuracy.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Garlic Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Garlic is a powerful ingredient that can easily overpower a dish if too much is used. In air fryer cooking, where flavours are concentrated, getting the right amount of crushed garlic is crucial. A slight miscalculation could throw off the balance of your recipe, whether it's for roasted vegetables or a delicious <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>air fryer chicken dish</a>.</p>  

<p>Using 10g of crushed garlic (0.35 oz) ensures consistency in your cooking. This measurement is particularly useful for marinades, sauces, or rubs where garlic plays a starring role. If you're unsure, always measure rather than guess to avoid disappointing results.</p>  

<h2>How to Measure 10g of Crushed Garlic</h2>  
<p>Measuring crushed garlic can be tricky due to its sticky texture. The best method is to use digital kitchen scales for precision. If you don't have scales, a rough estimate is that one medium-sized garlic clove yields about 5g when crushed, so 10g would be roughly two cloves.</p>  

<h3>Using a Conversion Chart</h3>  
<p>For quick reference, keep a handy <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> in your kitchen. This takes the guesswork out of converting between grams and ounces, especially when working with small quantities like 10g of crushed garlic.</p>  

<h2>Common Recipes Using 10g Crushed Garlic</h2>  
<p>Many air fryer recipes call for around 10g of crushed garlic. This amount is perfect for seasoning meats, enhancing vegetable dishes, or creating flavourful marinades. For example, a classic <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>air fryer roasted vegetable mix</a> often uses this quantity to add depth without overwhelming other ingredients.</p>  

<p>You'll also find 10g of crushed garlic in many sauce recipes, from aioli to stir-fry bases. The key is balancing the garlic with other flavours to create harmonious dishes that showcase your air fryer's capabilities.</p>  

<h3>Adjusting Garlic Quantities</h3>  
<p>If you prefer milder or stronger garlic flavours, you can adjust the 10g measurement accordingly. Remember that air frying intensifies flavours, so start with less if you're unsure. You can always add more, but you can't take it out once it's mixed in.</p>  

<h2>Storage Tips for Crushed Garlic</h2>  
<p>If you've measured out 10g of crushed garlic but don't use it all, proper storage is essential. Place any leftovers in an airtight container and refrigerate for up to a week. For longer storage, freeze measured portions in ice cube trays - each cube holds about 10g, making future recipe preparation effortless.</p>  

<p>When using stored crushed garlic in your air fryer, remember that the flavour may intensify over time. You might want to use slightly less than 10g if the garlic has been stored for several days. Always check our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a> for inspiration on using your pre-measured garlic.</p>  

<h3>Cleaning After Garlic Use</h3>  
<p>Garlic's strong aroma can linger in your air fryer if not cleaned properly. After cooking with 10g of crushed garlic, wipe down the basket with a mild <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner</a> to prevent flavours transferring to future dishes.</p>

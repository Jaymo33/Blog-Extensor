<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on even heat distribution, so ingredient quantities must be spot-on. Too much or too little greek yogurt can affect moisture levels, crispiness, and cooking time. For example, a <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe</a> calling for 1.33 cups of greek yogurt (10.64 oz) ensures balanced flavours and textures. Measuring correctly also helps when scaling recipes up or down for meal prep or smaller batches.</p>  

<p>Greek yogurt is thicker than regular yogurt, so volume-to-weight conversions are crucial. A slight miscalculation could lead to dense cakes or dry marinades. Always use measuring cups for liquids and a kitchen scale for ounces to guarantee accuracy. Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert recipes</a> to see how greek yogurt enhances air-fried treats.</p>  

<h3>How to measure 1.33 cups of greek yogurt</h3>  
<p>Use a liquid measuring cup for 1.33 cups of greek yogurt, levelling the top with a spatula. For ounces, a kitchen scale is more reliable—simply tare the scale and pour until it hits 10.64 oz. If your recipe uses metric units, 1.33 cups converts to roughly 302 grams. For more tips, visit <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for greek yogurt in air fryer recipes</h2>

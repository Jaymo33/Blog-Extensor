<p>235 ml of vinegar is approximately 1 cup (0.99 cups to be precise). Whether you're preparing a marinade, dressing, or a tangy glaze for your air fryer dishes, knowing this conversion ensures your recipes turn out perfectly every time. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we understand how crucial precise measurements are for cooking success.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Vinegar Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of vinegar can make or break a dish. Too little, and your marinade lacks punch; too much, and it overpowers the flavours. For air fryer recipes like crispy chicken wings or tangy glazed salmon, 235 ml of vinegar (just under 1 cup) is a common measurement. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more handy tips.</p>  

<p>Vinegar’s acidity also affects cooking times and textures, especially in air fryers where heat circulates rapidly. Whether you’re using apple cider, white, or balsamic vinegar, measuring 235 ml accurately ensures balanced flavours.

<h3>Measuring 235 ml of Vinegar Without a Cup</h3>  
<p>No measuring cup? No problem. A standard UK metric cup holds 250 ml, so 235 ml is just shy of a full cup. Alternatively, use a kitchen scale: 235 ml of vinegar weighs roughly 240 grams. For smaller quantities, tablespoons (15 ml each) can help—235 ml equals about 16 tablespoons.</p>  

<h2>Converting 235 ml of Vinegar for Different Recipes</h2>  
<p>Whether you’re scaling a recipe up or down, knowing how 235 ml of vinegar translates to cups is key. For example, a vinegar-based slaw might call for 235 ml (1 cup), while a glaze could use half. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a> includes dishes where precise vinegar measurements shine.</p>  

<p>In baking, vinegar’s role in activating baking soda means accuracy is non-negotiable. If a cake recipe lists 235 ml of vinegar, measuring just under 1 cup ensures the right rise. For cleaning your air fryer, a mix of 235 ml vinegar and water works wonders—see our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning guide</a> for details.</p>  

<h3>US vs. UK Cup Measurements for Vinegar</h3>  
<p>In the US, 1 cup equals 240 ml, making 235 ml of vinegar practically 1 cup. In the UK, where 1 metric cup is 250 ml, 235 ml is 0.94 cups. For air fryer recipes, this small difference rarely matters, but for precision baking, it’s worth noting.</p>  

<h2>Common Recipes Using 235 ml of Vinegar</h2>  
<p>From pickling vegetables to making tangy BBQ sauces, 235 ml of vinegar is a versatile quantity. Try it in air-fryer pulled pork or a zesty salad dressing. For inspiration, browse our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable recipes</a> featuring vinegar-based dressings.</p>  

<p>Vinegar also tenderises meats beautifully. A 235 ml (1 cup) marinade with herbs and oil can transform chicken or beef in the air fryer. Remember, accurate measurements ensure consistency, so always measure carefully for the best results.</p>

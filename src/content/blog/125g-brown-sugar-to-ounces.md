<p>125g of brown sugar equals approximately 4.41 ounces. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements can make or break your dish. Whether you're baking air fryer cookies or whipping up a dessert, knowing how to convert grams to ounces ensures perfect results every time.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Using the correct amount of ingredients, like 125g of brown sugar, ensures your air fryer recipes turn out just right. Too much sugar can cause over-browning, while too little might leave your dish lacking flavour. Air fryers cook quickly, so precision is key to avoid burnt or undercooked food.</p>  
<p>For example, if you're making air fryer brownies from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>our recipe collection</a>, 125g of brown sugar (4.41 oz) will give the perfect sweetness. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for other common measurements.</p>  

<h2>How to measure 125g of brown sugar without scales</h2>  
<p>If you don’t have a kitchen scale, you can still measure 125g of brown sugar using volume. Packed brown sugar is roughly 200g per cup, so 125g would be about ⅔ cup. However, for accuracy, we recommend using a scale, especially for air fryer baking.</p>  
<p>For more tips on measuring ingredients, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert recipes</a>, where precise sugar measurements are crucial. A slight variation in 125g of brown sugar can affect texture and taste.</p>  

<h3>Converting 125g brown sugar to ounces for UK recipes</h3>  
<p>In the UK, recipes often use grams, but some prefer ounces. 125g brown sugar to ounces is 4.41 oz, a handy conversion for adapting international recipes. This is especially useful for air fryer cooking, where consistency matters.</p>  

<h2>Common air fryer recipes using 125g brown sugar</h2>  
<p>Many air fryer desserts, like sticky toffee pudding or cinnamon rolls, call for around 125g of brown sugar. This amount balances sweetness without overpowering other flavours. Always measure carefully for best results.</p>  
<p>For savoury dishes, like glazed air fryer chicken, 125g of brown sugar might be used in a marinade. Visit <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> for inspiration on using brown sugar in your air fryer creations.</p>  

<h3>Storing brown sugar for air fryer recipes</h3>  
<p>To keep your 125g of brown sugar fresh, store it in an airtight container. Hardened sugar can throw off measurements, affecting your air fryer dishes. If your sugar clumps, revive it with a slice of bread overnight.</p>

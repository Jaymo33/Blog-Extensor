<p>2.25 cups of buttermilk equals 532.5 millilitres (ml). This conversion is essential for precise baking and cooking, especially when using an air fryer. Whether you’re whipping up pancakes, cakes, or marinades, knowing the exact ml measurement ensures consistency. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we focus on helping you achieve perfect results every time. Let’s dive deeper into why this conversion matters and how to use it.</p>

<h2>Why Convert Cups to Millilitres?</h2>
<p>Converting cups to millilitres is crucial for accuracy, especially in baking. Air fryer recipes often require precise measurements to ensure even cooking and perfect texture. Using millilitres eliminates the guesswork associated with cup measurements, which can vary slightly. For example, 2.25 cups of buttermilk in ml is a standardised 532.5 ml, making it easier to follow recipes. This precision is particularly helpful when scaling recipes up or down.</p>
<p>If you’re working with international recipes, millilitres are the go-to unit of measurement. Many UK and European recipes list ingredients in grams or millilitres rather than cups. Converting 2.25 cups of buttermilk to ml ensures you’re using the right amount, whether you’re baking a cake or marinating chicken.

<h2>How to Measure Buttermilk Accurately</h2>
<p>Measuring buttermilk correctly is key to achieving the desired consistency in your dishes. For 2.25 cups of buttermilk, use a liquid measuring cup with clear ml markings. Pour the buttermilk to the 532.5 ml line for accuracy. If you don’t have a measuring cup, a kitchen scale can also help—1 ml of buttermilk weighs roughly 1 gram.</p>
<p>Buttermilk is thicker than regular milk, so avoid shaking or stirring it before measuring. This ensures you get the right density for your recipe. If you’re using powdered buttermilk, reconstitute it according to the package instructions before measuring.

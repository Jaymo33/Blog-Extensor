<h2>Why accurate measurements matter</h2>  
<p>Using the correct weight for ingredients like almond milk can make or break a recipe. Too much liquid can lead to soggy textures, while too little might dry out your dish. This is especially crucial for air fryer cooking, where precise ratios affect crispiness and moisture. Almond milk, being lighter than dairy milk, requires careful measuring for perfect results.

<p>Many UK recipes list almond milk in millilitres or tablespoons, but grams provide universal accuracy. Digital scales eliminate guesswork, ensuring your air fryer meals turn out just right. Whether you’re making pancakes or a vegan curry, 15 grams per tablespoon is a reliable standard.

<h3>Converting almond milk for baking</h3>  
<p>Baking demands precision, and almond milk is no exception. If your recipe calls for 3 tbsp of almond milk, you’ll need 45 grams.

<h2>How to measure almond milk correctly</h2>  
<p>For the most accurate 15-gram measurement, use a digital scale set to grams. Pour almond milk slowly into a tablespoon until the scale tips. If you don’t have scales, fill the spoon level without heaping for a close estimate. This method works well for air fryer sauces or marinades where precision isn’t as critical.

<p>Almond milk’s consistency can vary between brands, but 15 grams per tablespoon is a safe average. Shake the carton well before measuring to ensure uniformity. For frothy drinks or whipped desserts, slight variations won’t matter as much. Always adjust based on your recipe’s sensitivity, especially in air fryer cooking where moisture levels are key.</p>

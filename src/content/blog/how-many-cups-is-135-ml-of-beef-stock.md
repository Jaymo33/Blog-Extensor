<p>135 ml of beef stock is approximately 0.57 cups in the US measurement system and 0.48 cups in the UK metric system. This conversion is essential for recipes that require precise liquid measurements, especially when using an air fryer. Whether you're making a rich gravy or a hearty stew, knowing how to convert 135 ml of beef stock to cups ensures your dish turns out perfectly every time. For more air fryer-friendly recipes, check out <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>our collection</a>.</p>  

<h2>Understanding the Conversion</h2>  
<p>Converting 135 ml of beef stock to cups depends on whether you're using the US or UK measurement system. In the US, 1 cup equals 240 ml, so 135 ml is roughly 0.57 cups. In the UK, where 1 cup is 284 ml, 135 ml translates to about 0.48 cups. This difference might seem small, but it can affect the outcome of your recipe, especially in baking or air fryer dishes where precision matters. Always double-check which system your recipe follows to avoid mistakes.</p>  

<p>If you're working with an air fryer, accurate measurements are crucial for even cooking. Too much or too little liquid can alter the texture and flavour of your dish. For example, adding the correct amount of beef stock to a marinade or sauce ensures your meat stays juicy and flavourful. Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a> for more handy measurement tips.</p>  

<h3>Why Accurate Measurements Matter</h3>  
<p>Using the right amount of beef stock can make or break a recipe. Too much liquid might make your dish soggy, while too little could leave it dry. This is especially important in air fryer cooking, where excess moisture can prevent crispy results. Whether you're making a beef stew or a glaze, measuring 135 ml of beef stock correctly ensures balanced flavours and textures.

<h2>Common Uses for 135 ml of Beef Stock</h2>  
<p>135 ml of beef stock is a common measurement in many recipes, from soups to sauces. It's enough to add depth of flavour without overwhelming the dish. In air fryer cooking, this amount is perfect for basting meats or creating a light gravy. For instance, a 135 ml portion of beef stock can be reduced to a rich glaze for roasted vegetables or used as a base for a quick jus. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/beef>beef recipe category</a> for inspiration.</p>  

<p>Another great use for 135 ml of beef stock is in marinades. Combining it with herbs and spices creates a flavourful soak for meats before air frying. This small quantity is ideal for coating without drowning the ingredients. Whether you're cooking beef, chicken, or vegetables, precise measurements ensure consistent results every time.

<h3>Tips for Measuring Beef Stock</h3>

If you don't have a measuring cup, a kitchen scale can help—135 ml of beef stock weighs roughly 135 grams. For air fryer recipes, precision ensures even cooking and perfect textures. Remember, a little attention to detail goes a long way in the kitchen.</p>

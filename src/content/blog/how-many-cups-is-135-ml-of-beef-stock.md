<h2>Understanding the Conversion</h2>  
<p>Converting 135 ml of beef stock to cups depends on whether you're using the US or UK measurement system. In the US, 1 cup equals 240 ml, so 135 ml is roughly 0.57 cups.

This difference might seem small, but it can affect the outcome of your recipe, especially in baking or air fryer dishes where precision matters. Always double-check which system your recipe follows to avoid mistakes.</p>  

<p>If you're working with an air fryer, accurate measurements are crucial for even cooking. Too much or too little liquid can alter the texture and flavour of your dish.

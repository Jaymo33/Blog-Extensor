If you’re new to air fryer baking, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a> can help you switch between cups, ounces, and grams effortlessly.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure 0.75 Cup of Icing Sugar Accurately</h3>  
<p>To measure 0.75 cup of icing sugar, use a dry measuring cup and level it off with a straight edge. Spoon the sugar into the cup lightly to avoid compacting it, which can lead to over-measuring. For the most accurate results, consider weighing it—3 ounces is the equivalent weight for 0.75 cup. This method is especially useful for air fryer recipes where precision is key.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for 0.75 Cup of Icing Sugar in Air Fryer Recipes</h2>  
<p>0.75 cup of icing sugar (3 oz) is a common measurement in many air fryer desserts. From glazes for <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>cakes</a> to dustings for cookies, this amount ensures just the right sweetness. It’s also perfect for making air fryer donuts or shortbread, where the sugar’s fine texture is essential.</p>  

<p>If you’re preparing a larger batch, you might need to scale up the measurement. For example, 1.5 cups of icing sugar would be 6 ounces. Always double-check your conversions to avoid mistakes.

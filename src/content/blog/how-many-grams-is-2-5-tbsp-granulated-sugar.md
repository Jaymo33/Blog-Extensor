<p>2.5 tablespoons of granulated sugar equals approximately 31.25 grams. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements can make or break your dish. Whether you’re baking cookies or preparing a glaze, knowing the exact weight ensures consistent results every time.</p>

<h2>Why accurate sugar measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>
<p>Air fryers cook food faster and more evenly than conventional ovens, which means ingredient ratios need to be spot-on. Too much sugar can cause burning or uneven caramelisation, while too little might leave your dish lacking sweetness. For perfect air fryer desserts like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>cakes or cookies</a>, measuring 2.5 tbsp of granulated sugar correctly is crucial.</p>
<p>Granulated sugar’s density can vary slightly based on how it’s packed, so weighing it removes guesswork. Digital kitchen scales are inexpensive and invaluable for air fryer enthusiasts. If you’re converting from US recipes, note that UK tablespoons differ slightly (15ml vs 14.2ml), but our 31.25g measurement accounts for this.</p>

<h2>How to measure 2.5 tbsp of granulated sugar without scales</h2>
<p>If you don’t have scales, use the spoon-and-level method for accuracy. Gently spoon granulated sugar into your tablespoon measure without packing it down, then level off the top with a straight edge. Repeat this 2.5 times for the correct amount. Remember that 1 UK tablespoon of granulated sugar equals about 12.5 grams.</p>
<p>For context, 2.5 tbsp granulated sugar is roughly equivalent to 1.5 standard UK digestive biscuits in sweetness. When adapting oven recipes for your air fryer, you might need to slightly reduce sugar quantities since the concentrated heat intensifies flavours. Check our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more adjustments.</p>

<h3>Sugar alternatives and their gram equivalents</h3>
<p>If substituting sweeteners, note that 2.5 tbsp of granulated sugar (31.25g) equals about 2 tbsp of honey (42g) or 5 tsp of maple syrup (35g). These liquid alternatives may require recipe tweaks since they add moisture. For diabetic-friendly options, 2.5 tbsp of granulated sugar converts to about 1.25 tbsp of erythritol (18g).</p>

<h2>Common air fryer recipes using 2.5 tbsp granulated sugar</h2>
<p>Many popular air fryer treats call for around 2.5 tbsp of sugar. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert category</a> features classics like 5-minute doughnuts or fruit crumbles where this measurement appears frequently. The quantity perfectly sweetens small batches without overwhelming other flavours.</p>
<p>When making caramelised nuts or glazed meats in your air fryer, 2.5 tbsp granulated sugar creates just enough syrup for coating. Remember to reduce cooking times slightly when working with sugar to prevent burning. After cooking, use our recommended <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner</a> to remove any sticky residues.</p>

<h3>Storing measured sugar for meal prep</h3>
<p>If you frequently use 2.5 tbsp portions, pre-measure several into airtight containers. This saves time and ensures consistency across multiple cooking sessions. Granulated sugar keeps indefinitely when stored properly, making it ideal for <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/meal-prep>meal prep</a> enthusiasts.</p>

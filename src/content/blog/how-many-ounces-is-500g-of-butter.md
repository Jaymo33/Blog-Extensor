<h2>Why Convert 500g of Butter to Ounces?</h2>

<p>Butter is a staple in dishes like air-fryer cakes or cookies, where precision matters. A 500g block is common in UK supermarkets, so knowing its ounce equivalent simplifies scaling recipes. For example, if a US recipe calls for 16 oz of butter, you’ll know 500g is slightly more—adjust accordingly!</p>  

<h3>How to Measure 500g of Butter Without Scales</h3>  
<p>No scales? No problem! A standard UK block of butter is 250g, so two blocks make 500g (or roughly 17.64 oz). Each tablespoon of butter is about 14g, so 500g equals roughly 36 tablespoons.

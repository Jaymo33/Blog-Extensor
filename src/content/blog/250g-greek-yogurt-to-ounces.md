<h2>Why Convert 250g of Greek Yogurt to Ounces?</h2>  
<p>Many air fryer recipes, especially those from the UK, use metric measurements like grams. However, some kitchen scales or recipe books might list ingredients in ounces. Converting 250g of Greek yogurt to ounces (8.82 oz) helps avoid guesswork and ensures your dish turns out perfectly. This is particularly useful for recipes like marinades, dressings, or baked goods where precision matters.</p>  
<p>Greek yogurt is a versatile ingredient in air fryer cooking, from creamy sauces to protein-packed snacks.

<h2>How to Measure 250g of Greek Yogurt Accurately</h2>  
<p>If your kitchen scale measures in ounces, simply set it to 8.82 oz for 250g of Greek yogurt. No scale? A standard UK tablespoon holds about 0.5 oz (15g), so you’d need roughly 17-18 tablespoons for 250g. However, weighing is far more accurate, especially for air fryer recipes where texture and moisture balance are key.</p>  
<p>For those using cups, 250g of Greek yogurt is roughly 1 cup, but this can vary based on thickness. Thicker yogurts may pack more densely, so a scale is always best.

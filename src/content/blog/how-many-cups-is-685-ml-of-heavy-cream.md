<h2>Understanding the Conversion</h2>  
<p>Converting 685 ml of heavy cream to cups depends on whether you’re using US or UK measurements. In the US, 1 cup equals 240 ml, so 685 ml works out to approximately 2.9 cups.

<h3>Why Accurate Measurements Matter</h3>  
<p>In baking and cooking, especially with an air fryer, accuracy is key. Too much heavy cream can make a dish overly rich or soggy, while too little might leave it dry. Measuring 685 ml of heavy cream correctly ensures your recipes turn out as intended. If you’re scaling a recipe up or down, this conversion becomes even more important.</p>  

<h2>Practical Tips for Measuring Heavy Cream</h2>  
<p>When measuring 685 ml of heavy cream, use a liquid measuring cup for the most accurate results. Pour the cream slowly to avoid spills and check the measurement at eye level. If you don’t have a measuring cup, a kitchen scale can also help—685 ml of heavy cream weighs approximately 700 grams. This method is especially handy for air fryer recipes where precision is critical.</p>  

<p>For those who love baking, heavy cream is often used in cakes and desserts. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>air fryer cake recipes</a> for inspiration. Whether you’re making a classic Victoria sponge or a chocolate fudge cake, the right amount of heavy cream ensures a moist, delicious result.</p>  

<h3>Common Uses for 685 ml of Heavy Cream</h3>  
<p>685 ml of heavy cream is a versatile ingredient in air fryer cooking. It’s perfect for making creamy sauces, whipped toppings, or even adding richness to mashed potatoes. If you’re preparing a batch of scones or biscuits, heavy cream can replace milk for a richer flavour.

<p>2.5 cups of cornflour equals approximately 10.6 ounces (or 300 grams). Getting this conversion right is essential for air fryer recipes, where precision ensures perfect texture and consistency. Whether you're coating chicken or thickening a sauce, knowing the exact weight saves time and avoids kitchen mishaps.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on even heat distribution, so ingredient ratios must be spot-on. Too much cornflour can make coatings clumpy, while too little might leave food soggy. For recipes like crispy <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>air fryer chicken</a>, 2.5 cups of cornflour (10.6 oz) is often ideal for a light, golden crust. Check our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a> for other common measurements.</p>  

<p>Cornflour is lighter than wheat flour, so volume-to-weight conversions differ. A UK cup holds 120 grams of cornflour, meaning 2.5 cups weigh 300 grams (10.6 oz). This precision helps when adapting recipes from cups to ounces, especially for air fryer batters or dustings.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure Cornflour Correctly</h3>  
<p>For accuracy, spoon cornflour into a measuring cup and level it off—don’t scoop directly from the bag. Compacted flour can add extra ounces, throwing off your recipe. If you’re scaling up, use a kitchen scale for 2.5 cups of cornflour (10.6 oz) to avoid guesswork.</p>  

<h2>Common Recipes Using 2.5 Cups of Cornflour</h2>  
<p>This quantity works well for batch cooking. Try it in <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer onion rings</a> or tempura vegetables. The 10.6-ounce measurement ensures a crisp finish without excess residue. For gluten-free options, cornflour is a staple—just ensure your conversions are precise.</p>  

<p>Some bakers use 2.5 cups of cornflour (300g) in cakes for a tender crumb. In savoury dishes, it thickens sauces evenly. Always sift cornflour first to prevent lumps, especially in air fryer batters where smoothness matters.</p>  

<h3>Converting Other Cornflour Amounts</h3>  
<p>Need smaller batches? Half of 2.5 cups is 1.25 cups (5.3 oz). For larger quantities, 5 cups equal 21.2 oz.

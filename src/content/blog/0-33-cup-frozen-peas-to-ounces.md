<p>0.33 cup of frozen peas weighs approximately 2.64 ounces (75 grams) in the UK. This measurement is essential for air fryer recipes, ensuring you get the perfect portion every time. Whether you're meal prepping or whipping up a quick side dish, knowing this conversion saves time and hassle. For more handy conversions, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter for frozen peas</h2>  
<p>Getting the right amount of frozen peas ensures even cooking in your air fryer. Too few, and your dish might lack texture; too many, and they won’t crisp up properly. Frozen peas are a staple in many air fryer recipes, from quick sides to hearty mains. Accurate measurements also help with portion control, especially if you're tracking calories or macros. Visit <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>our recipe hub</a> for inspiration on using frozen peas creatively.</p>  

<p>Frozen peas retain their nutrients better than canned varieties, making them a healthier choice. They’re packed with vitamins and fibre, perfect for balanced meals. Measuring them correctly ensures you’re not over or under-serving. For more tips on cooking frozen vegetables, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetables category</a>.</p>  

<h3>How to measure 0.33 cup of frozen peas</h3>  
<p>Use a standard UK measuring cup for the most accurate results. Scoop the peas lightly without packing them down to avoid over-measuring. If you don’t have a measuring cup, a kitchen scale set to ounces or grams works perfectly. For more precision, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion guide</a>.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for 0.33 cup of frozen peas</h2>  
<p>This portion is ideal for single-serving air fryer dishes like pea fritters or as a side for grilled fish. It’s also great for adding to stir-fries or pasta bakes cooked in the air fryer. Frozen peas cook quickly, so they’re perfect for last-minute meals. Find more ideas in our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/frozen-foods>frozen foods section</a>.</p>  

<p>You can also blend them into dips or mix them with other veggies for a colourful medley. Their sweet flavour pairs well with herbs and spices, making them versatile. For cleaning tips after cooking, see our guide on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer maintenance</a>.</p>  

<h3>Adjusting recipes for different portion sizes</h3>  
<p>If your recipe calls for more or less than 0.33 cup, simply scale the ounces proportionally. For example, 0.66 cup would be roughly 5.28 ounces. Always check your air fryer’s capacity to avoid overcrowding. Overloading can lead to uneven cooking and soggy results.</p>

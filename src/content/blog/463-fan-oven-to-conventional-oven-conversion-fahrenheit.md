<p>463°F in a fan oven converts to approximately 425°F in a conventional oven. This 20-25°F reduction accounts for the fan oven’s efficient heat circulation, which cooks food faster at lower temperatures. When using your air fryer – essentially a compact convection oven – you’ll typically follow similar conversion principles to avoid overcooking.</p>

<h2>Understanding Fan Oven vs Conventional Oven Temperatures</h2>
<p>Fan ovens circulate hot air constantly, creating more even heat distribution than conventional ovens. This means recipes often specify lower temperatures for fan ovens. The general rule is to reduce conventional oven temperatures by 20-25°F when using a fan oven. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we recommend applying similar adjustments when converting fan oven settings for air fryer use.</p>
<p>For 463°F fan oven to conventional oven conversion specifically, 425°F is the standard equivalent. This holds true whether you’re baking, roasting, or using your air fryer. The conversion ensures your food cooks through properly without burning on the outside. Many of our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipes</a> benefit from this precise temperature adjustment.</p>

<h3>Why 463°F Fan Oven Needs Conversion</h3>
<p>The forced air circulation in fan ovens makes them more efficient than conventional ovens. Without conversion, food would cook too quickly at 463°F, potentially drying out or burning. This principle applies doubly to air fryers, where the cooking chamber is smaller and heat transfer even more intense. Our testing shows 425°F in conventional ovens or air fryers produces identical results to 463°F in fan ovens.</p>

<h2>Applying 463°F Fan Oven Conversion to Air Fryers</h2>
<p>Air fryers operate similarly to fan ovens, using rapid air circulation to cook food. However, their compact size means heat builds up faster. When a recipe calls for 463°F fan oven, we recommend starting at 400°F in your air fryer and adjusting as needed. This accounts for the air fryer’s greater efficiency while preventing overcooking.</p>
<p>For example, when making <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/potatoes>roast potatoes</a> originally designed for 463°F fan ovens, 400°F in the air fryer yields perfect crispness without drying out the interior. The same applies to <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>many baked goods</a> – the slightly lower temperature prevents burning while ensuring thorough cooking.</p>

<h3>Special Considerations for Different Foods</h3>
<p>Dense foods like meats may need the full 425°F equivalent to cook through properly in an air fryer. Delicate items like pastries often benefit from the lower 400°F adjustment. Always check food early when first trying these conversions. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning guides</a> can help maintain your air fryer’s performance for accurate temperature control.</p>

<h2>Common Cooking Scenarios for 463°F Fan Oven Conversion</h2>
<p>Many professional recipes specify 463°F fan oven temperatures for optimal browning and texture. When adapting these for home cooking, the 425°F conventional oven or 400°F air fryer conversion works perfectly. This applies particularly to roasted vegetables, where the lower temperature prevents burning while caramelizing sugars beautifully.</p>
<p>For <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/beef>beef dishes</a> requiring 463°F fan oven settings, the 425°F conversion helps develop crust without overcooking the interior. The same principle works for poultry, though cooking times may need slight reduction in air fryers due to their efficiency.</p>

<p>1.5 cups of granulated sugar equals 300 grams. This conversion is essential for precise baking, especially when using an air fryer where measurements can make or break a recipe. Whether you're whipping up cakes, cookies, or desserts, knowing the exact gram equivalent ensures consistency.

<h2>Why Accurate Sugar Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Using the correct amount of granulated sugar is crucial for achieving the right texture and sweetness in your baked goods. Too much sugar can lead to overly caramelised or burnt results, especially in an air fryer where heat distribution is intense. Too little, and your treats may turn out bland or dry. Converting cups to grams removes the guesswork, giving you reliable results every time. For more tips on air fryer baking, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a>.</p>  

<p>Granulated sugar is a staple in many recipes, from classic sponges to crispy cookies. When adapting traditional oven recipes for an air fryer, precise measurements become even more important due to the faster cooking times. A digital kitchen scale is your best friend here, ensuring you hit the 300-gram mark for 1.5 cups of sugar. If you're new to air fryer baking, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>cake recipes</a> are a great place to start.</p>  

<h3>US vs UK Cup Measurements</h3>  
<p>It's worth noting that cup measurements can vary slightly between the US and UK. A standard US cup holds 240ml, while a UK cup is 250ml. However, for granulated sugar, the difference in weight is minimal—roughly 200 grams per cup in both systems. So, 1.5 cups will still be close to 300 grams regardless of where your measuring cup originates.

<h2>Converting Other Sugar Amounts</h2>  
<p>If your recipe calls for more or less than 1.5 cups of granulated sugar, here's a quick reference: 1 cup equals 200 grams, 2 cups equal 400 grams, and so on. This scaling makes it easy to adjust recipes without recalculating each time. Whether you're making a small batch of cookies or a large cake, these conversions ensure accuracy. For perfectly measured desserts, try our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cookies>cookie recipes</a>.</p>  

<p>Granulated sugar isn't the only sweetener used in baking, but it's one of the most common. Brown sugar, powdered sugar, and alternative sweeteners each have different weights per cup, so always check specific conversions. Keeping a conversion chart handy, like the one on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>our site</a>, can save time and prevent mistakes.</p>  

<h3>Tips for Measuring Sugar in an Air Fryer</h3>  
<p>When using an air fryer, evenly distributed sugar is key to avoiding hot spots. Spoon the sugar into your measuring cup rather than scooping it, as this prevents packing and ensures a consistent 200 grams per cup. Level off the top with a straight edge for precision.

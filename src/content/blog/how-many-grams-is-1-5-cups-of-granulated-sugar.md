<h2>Why Accurate Sugar Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Using the correct amount of granulated sugar is crucial for achieving the right texture and sweetness in your baked goods. Too much sugar can lead to overly caramelised or burnt results, especially in an air fryer where heat distribution is intense. Too little, and your treats may turn out bland or dry. Converting cups to grams removes the guesswork, giving you reliable results every time.

<h3>US vs UK Cup Measurements</h3>  
<p>It's worth noting that cup measurements can vary slightly between the US and UK. A standard US cup holds 240ml, while a UK cup is 250ml. However, for granulated sugar, the difference in weight is minimalâ€”roughly 200 grams per cup in both systems. So, 1.5 cups will still be close to 300 grams regardless of where your measuring cup originates.

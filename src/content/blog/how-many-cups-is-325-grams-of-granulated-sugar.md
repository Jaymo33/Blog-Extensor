Whether you're making cakes, cookies, or sweet treats, precise measurements ensure perfect results every time.</p>  

<h2>Understanding Granulated Sugar Measurements</h2>  
<p>Granulated sugar is a staple in baking, but its density can vary slightly depending on how it's packed. For 325 grams of granulated sugar, the conversion to cups differs between the UK and US due to slight variations in cup sizes. In the UK, a standard cup holds 200 grams of granulated sugar, while in the US, it's around 200-210 grams. This means 325 grams translates to roughly 1.6 UK cups or 1.63 US cups.</p>

<p>325 grams of granulated sugar equals approximately 1.6 cups in the UK and 1.63 cups in the US. This conversion is essential for baking and cooking, especially when using an air fryer for desserts. Whether you're making cakes, cookies, or sweet treats, precise measurements ensure perfect results every time.</p>  

<h2>Understanding Granulated Sugar Measurements</h2>  
<p>Granulated sugar is a staple in baking, but its density can vary slightly depending on how it's packed. For 325 grams of granulated sugar, the conversion to cups differs between the UK and US due to slight variations in cup sizes. In the UK, a standard cup holds 200 grams of granulated sugar, while in the US, it's around 200-210 grams. This means 325 grams translates to roughly 1.6 UK cups or 1.63 US cups.</p>  

<p>When using an air fryer for recipes like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>air fryer cakes</a>, accurate sugar measurements are crucial. Too much sugar can affect texture, while too little may leave desserts bland. For best results, use a kitchen scale for precision, especially when scaling recipes up or down.</p>  

<h3>Why Measuring Sugar Correctly Matters</h3>  
<p>In baking, sugar isn't just for sweetnessâ€”it affects moisture, browning, and structure. Using the right amount ensures your air fryer desserts turn out perfectly. For example, if you're making <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer cookies</a>, 325 grams of granulated sugar will give them the ideal crispness and caramelisation.</p>  

<h2>Converting 325 Grams of Granulated Sugar to Cups</h2>  
<p>To convert 325 grams of granulated sugar to cups, follow these simple steps. First, fluff the sugar with a spoon to prevent compacting. Then, lightly spoon it into a measuring cup and level it off. For UK bakers, 325 grams equals about 1.6 cups, while US bakers will need roughly 1.63 cups.</p>  

<p>If you don't have a scale, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> can help. It includes common baking ingredients, making it easier to switch between grams and cups. Remember, slight variations in scooping can affect the final measurement, so a scale is always best for accuracy.</p>  

<h3>Tips for Measuring Sugar Without a Scale</h3>  
<p>If you're in a pinch, use the spoon-and-level method to measure 325 grams of granulated sugar. Avoid packing the sugar into the cup, as this can lead to over-measuring. For air fryer recipes like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>desserts</a>, even small inaccuracies can impact the final result.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for 325 Grams of Granulated Sugar</h2>  
<p>325 grams of granulated sugar is a common measurement for many recipes. It's perfect for a batch of air fryer brownies, a classic Victoria sponge, or even homemade caramel. The key is to measure carefully to ensure consistency in your baking.</p>  

<p>For those who love experimenting, try using 325 grams of sugar in <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cookies>air fryer cookie recipes</a>. The sugar helps create that irresistible chewiness and golden colour. Just remember to clean your air fryer afterward with <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>our recommended cleaner</a> to prevent sticky residue.</p>  

<h3>Adjusting Recipes for Different Sugar Types</h3>  
<p>If you're substituting caster or brown sugar for granulated, note that their densities differ. 325 grams of granulated sugar won't be the same volume as other sugars. Always check conversions to avoid mishaps in your air fryer creations.</p>

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of oil in your air fryer can affect everything from crispiness to even cooking. Too little oil, and your food might dry out; too much, and it could become greasy.

<h3>How to measure 15g of sunflower oil without scales</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a kitchen scale, you can still measure 15g of sunflower oil using tablespoons. One tablespoon of sunflower oil weighs roughly 14g, so just over a tablespoon will give you the right amount. This method is handy for quick adjustments when you’re mid-recipe and need to keep things moving.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for 15g of sunflower oil in air fryers</h2>  
<p>Sunflower oil is a popular choice for air frying due to its high smoke point and neutral flavour. A 15g portion is often used for coating vegetables like potatoes or Brussels sprouts before air frying. This small amount ensures even crisping without excess oil pooling at the bottom of the basket.</p>  

<p>Another great use for 15g of sunflower oil is in marinades or rubs for meats like chicken or turkey. The oil helps spices adhere while keeping the meat moist during cooking.

<h3>Storing sunflower oil for air fryer use</h3>  
<p>To maintain freshness, store sunflower oil in a cool, dark place away from direct sunlight. A 15g portion is easy to measure from a well-sealed bottle, ensuring you always have the right amount on hand for spontaneous air fryer sessions. Proper storage also prevents the oil from turning rancid, which can affect the taste of your dishes.</p>

<p>15 grams of sunflower oil is approximately 0.53 ounces. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements can make all the difference in texture and flavour. Whether you’re frying, roasting, or baking, knowing how to convert grams to ounces ensures your dishes turn out perfectly every time.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of oil in your air fryer can affect everything from crispiness to even cooking. Too little oil, and your food might dry out; too much, and it could become greasy. For example, a recipe calling for 15g of sunflower oil (0.53 oz) ensures just enough fat to crisp up your ingredients without overpowering them. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more handy measurement tips.</p>  

<p>Many air fryer recipes, especially those for roasted vegetables or crispy chicken, rely on small amounts of oil for optimal results. Measuring 15g of sunflower oil accurately means you’re following the recipe as intended, avoiding common pitfalls like soggy or unevenly cooked food. For more inspiration, browse our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>collection of air fryer recipes</a> designed for perfect results every time.</p>  

<h3>How to measure 15g of sunflower oil without scales</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a kitchen scale, you can still measure 15g of sunflower oil using tablespoons. One tablespoon of sunflower oil weighs roughly 14g, so just over a tablespoon will give you the right amount. This method is handy for quick adjustments when you’re mid-recipe and need to keep things moving.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for 15g of sunflower oil in air fryers</h2>  
<p>Sunflower oil is a popular choice for air frying due to its high smoke point and neutral flavour. A 15g portion is often used for coating vegetables like potatoes or Brussels sprouts before air frying. This small amount ensures even crisping without excess oil pooling at the bottom of the basket.</p>  

<p>Another great use for 15g of sunflower oil is in marinades or rubs for meats like chicken or turkey. The oil helps spices adhere while keeping the meat moist during cooking. For more ideas, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken air fryer recipes</a> that make the most of precise oil measurements.</p>  

<h3>Storing sunflower oil for air fryer use</h3>  
<p>To maintain freshness, store sunflower oil in a cool, dark place away from direct sunlight. A 15g portion is easy to measure from a well-sealed bottle, ensuring you always have the right amount on hand for spontaneous air fryer sessions. Proper storage also prevents the oil from turning rancid, which can affect the taste of your dishes.</p>  

<h2>Converting other oil measurements for air fryer recipes</h2>  
<p>If your recipe calls for a different amount of oil, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a> can help you switch between grams, ounces, and millilitres effortlessly. For example, 30g of sunflower oil equals roughly 1.06 ounces, doubling the 15g measurement we’ve discussed. This flexibility is perfect for scaling recipes up or down depending on your needs.</p>  

<p>Remember, cleaning your air fryer after using oils is crucial to maintain performance. A quick wipe with our recommended <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner</a> keeps your appliance in top condition, ready for the next cooking adventure. Proper maintenance ensures even heating and prevents unwanted smoke from leftover oil residues.</p>

<p>85 ml of orange juice is roughly 0.36 cups (US) or 0.3 cups (UK). This conversion is handy for air fryer recipes, baking, or meal prep where precise measurements matter. Whether you’re whipping up a citrus glaze or marinating chicken, knowing how to convert ml to cups ensures accuracy.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on precise ingredient ratios for even cooking and perfect texture. Too much or too little liquid, like orange juice, can affect browning and crispiness. For example, a marinade with 85 ml of orange juice needs the right balance to avoid soggy results. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more handy tips.</p>  

<p>Recipes from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> often use metric and imperial measurements, so conversions are essential. Whether you’re making glazed salmon or citrus-infused desserts, 85 ml of orange juice translates to just under half a cup in the US. For UK cooks, it’s slightly less due to differing cup sizes.</p>  

<h3>US vs. UK Cup Measurements</h3>  
<p>In the US, 1 cup equals 240 ml, so 85 ml is about 0.36 cups. In the UK, 1 cup is 284 ml, making 85 ml closer to 0.3 cups. Always check your recipe’s origin to avoid mishaps. For air fryer recipes, like our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>orange-glazed chicken</a>, precision ensures crispy skin and juicy meat.</p>  

<h2>How to Measure 85 ml of Orange Juice Without a Scale</h2>  
<p>No measuring jug? Use a tablespoon: 1 tablespoon holds 15 ml, so 85 ml is roughly 5.5 tablespoons. For smaller quantities, a teaspoon (5 ml) can help fine-tune the measurement. This trick works for marinades, dressings, or even <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>citrus desserts</a> in your air fryer.</p>  

<p>Alternatively, repurpose a standard drinking glass. A typical UK glass holds 200 ml, so fill it just under halfway for 85 ml. For US cooks, a 1-cup measuring cup filled to the 1/3 mark will do. Need more conversions? Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe hub</a> has guides for every measurement.</p>  

<h3>Common Uses for 85 ml of Orange Juice</h3>  
<p>This amount is perfect for glazes, dressings, or single-serving sauces. Try it in an air fryer marinade for shrimp or tofu—just mix with garlic and herbs. For baking, 85 ml adds moisture to cakes without overwhelming the batter. Cleanup is easy with our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner tips</a>.</p>

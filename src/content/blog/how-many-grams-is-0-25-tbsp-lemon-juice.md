<p>0.25 tbsp of lemon juice weighs approximately 3.7 grams. This measurement is crucial for air fryer recipes where precise ingredient quantities affect cooking results. Whether you're making marinades, dressings, or glazes, knowing this conversion ensures your dishes turn out perfectly every time.</p>

<h2>Why accurate lemon juice measurements matter</h2>
<p>In air fryer cooking, small quantities like 0.25 tbsp of lemon juice can make a big difference. Too much acidity might overpower delicate flavours, while too little won't provide the desired tang. The air fryer's intense heat means ingredients react differently compared to conventional oven cooking.</p>
<p>For perfect results every time, we recommend using digital scales when measuring 0.25 tbsp of lemon juice. This eliminates guesswork and ensures consistency across all your <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a>. Our conversion chart at <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> includes all common measurement conversions.</p>

<h3>How we calculated 0.25 tbsp to grams</h3>
<p>The standard UK conversion for lemon juice is 1 tbsp = 14.79 grams. Therefore, 0.25 tbsp equals about 3.7 grams. This calculation accounts for lemon juice's density and viscosity, which differs from water or oils. Always use fresh lemon juice for most accurate measurements.</p>

<h2>Practical uses for 0.25 tbsp lemon juice</h2>
<p>This small quantity works perfectly in air fryer marinades for chicken or fish. It's also ideal for adding brightness to vegetable dishes without making them soggy.

<h3>Measuring alternatives if you don't have scales</h3>
<p>If you need to measure 0.25 tbsp lemon juice without scales, use a 1/4 tablespoon measure or 3/4 teaspoon (as 1 tbsp = 3 tsp). For most UK home cooks, this equals about 1/16 of a standard UK tablespoon. However, we always recommend weighing for precision in air fryer cooking.</p>

<h2>Common recipe applications</h2>

<h2>Common Uses for 3 Cups of Pineapple Juice</h2>  
<p>Three cups (24 oz) of pineapple juice is a versatile ingredient in air fryer cooking. It works beautifully in marinades for chicken or pork, adding a tropical twist. You can also reduce it into a glaze for air-fried salmon or use it in dessert recipes like pineapple upside-down cake.</p>

<p>500g of lime juice equals approximately 17.64 ounces. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements can make all the difference to your cooking results. Whether you're making zesty marinades or tangy sauces, knowing how to convert grams to ounces ensures your dishes turn out perfectly every time.</p>

<h2>Understanding lime juice measurements</h2>
<p>When working with lime juice in recipes, especially for air fryer cooking, accuracy matters. The density of lime juice means that 500g takes up about 500ml of volume, but weight measurements are more precise. Many UK recipes use grams while some older cookbooks or international sources might use ounces, making conversions necessary.</p>
<p>For air fryer recipes, getting the lime juice quantity right affects both flavour and cooking performance. Too much liquid can make food soggy, while too little might leave dishes dry. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we recommend using digital scales for the most accurate measurements when preparing ingredients.</p>

<h2>Why 500g is a common measurement</h2>
<p>500g of lime juice is roughly equivalent to the juice from 10-12 medium limes, making it a practical quantity for batch cooking. This amount works perfectly for marinades that will be used across multiple meals or for preparing larger quantities of sauce. Many air fryer recipes, especially those for <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken dishes</a>, call for this quantity to ensure robust flavour.</p>
<p>The 500g measurement also aligns well with standard UK supermarket packaging. You'll often find lime juice sold in 500ml bottles, which typically weigh about 500g. When following recipes from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>our collection</a>, you can be confident that 500g measurements will be easy to work with.</p>

<h2>Conversion methods for lime juice</h2>
<p>To convert 500g lime juice to ounces, you multiply by 0.035274, giving you 17.64 ounces. For quick reference, you can remember that 100g equals about 3.5 ounces. This simple calculation works because lime juice has a similar density to water, making weight-to-volume conversions straightforward.</p>
<p>If you don't have scales, you can use measuring jugs with both metric and imperial markings. However, for the most precise measurements in air fryer cooking, especially when making delicate items like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>desserts</a>, weighing your ingredients is always best.</p>

<h2>Practical tips for measuring lime juice</h2>
<h3>Using fresh versus bottled lime juice</h3>
<p>When converting 500g of lime juice to ounces, it's worth noting that fresh lime juice may vary slightly in density. Bottled lime juice tends to be more consistent, making conversions more reliable. For air fryer recipes where precision matters, bottled juice can sometimes give more predictable results.</p>

<h3>Adjusting for recipe requirements</h3>
<p>Some air fryer recipes might call for "the juice of 2 limes" rather than a specific weight. In these cases, knowing that an average lime yields about 40-50ml (40-50g) of juice helps you estimate whether you need to adjust other liquid ingredients. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a> includes these handy equivalents.</p>

<h2>Storing leftover lime juice</h2>
<p>If your recipe only uses part of your 500g (17.64oz) of lime juice, proper storage is key. Transfer unused juice to an airtight container and refrigerate for up to a week. For longer storage, freeze lime juice in ice cube trays - each cube holds about 30ml (1oz), making future measurements easy when you next use your air fryer.</p>
<p>Remember that lime juice can affect certain air fryer components if spilled. Always clean your appliance thoroughly after use with our recommended <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning methods</a> to maintain performance and prevent any citrus residue buildup.</p>

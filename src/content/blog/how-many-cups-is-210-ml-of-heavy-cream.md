<p>210 ml of heavy cream is approximately 0.89 cups. This conversion is essential for recipes requiring precise measurements, especially when using an air fryer for baking or cooking. Whether you're whipping up a creamy sauce or a decadent dessert, knowing how to convert millilitres to cups ensures consistent results every time.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>When working with heavy cream, even small measurement discrepancies can affect the texture and consistency of your dish. Too much cream can make sauces overly rich, while too little might leave them thin. For air fryer recipes, precision is key to achieving the perfect cook. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more handy measurement tips.</p>  

<p>Heavy cream is a staple in many recipes, from soups to desserts. If you're using an air fryer for baking, like making a moist cake or fluffy pancakes, the right amount of heavy cream ensures the batter has the ideal richness. Visit our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipes section</a> for inspiration on how to use heavy cream in your air fryer creations.</p>  

<h2>How to Measure 210 ml of Heavy Cream</h2>  
<p>Measuring 210 ml of heavy cream is simple with the right tools. A liquid measuring cup with millilitre markings is the most accurate way. If you only have a standard cup measure, remember that 1 cup equals roughly 236.59 ml, so 210 ml is just under a full cup.</p>  

<h3>Using a Kitchen Scale</h3>  
<p>For even greater precision, a kitchen scale can help. Heavy cream weighs approximately 1 gram per millilitre, so 210 ml should weigh around 210 grams. This method eliminates any guesswork and ensures your recipes turn out perfectly every time.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for 210 ml of Heavy Cream</h2>  
<p>Heavy cream is incredibly versatile. In an air fryer, you might use it to make creamy pasta sauces, rich custards, or even fluffy scrambled eggs. It’s also a key ingredient in many desserts, like air-fried cheesecakes or chocolate mousse. Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert category</a> for sweet ideas.</p>  

<p>If you're cooking savoury dishes, 210 ml of heavy cream can elevate mashed potatoes, soups, or casseroles. For a delicious twist, try adding it to a creamy garlic sauce for chicken or seafood. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipes</a> for inspiration.</p>  

<h2>Tips for Storing Heavy Cream</h2>  
<p>Once opened, heavy cream should be used within a few days or frozen for longer storage. If you’ve measured out 210 ml and have leftovers, transfer it to an airtight container and refrigerate promptly. Always give it a quick stir before using it again, as it can separate slightly.</p>  

<h3>Cleaning Up After Using Heavy Cream</h3>  
<p>Heavy cream can leave a greasy residue, so clean your air fryer basket thoroughly after use. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner guide</a> has handy tips to keep your appliance in top condition.</p>

<p>475 grams of brown sugar is roughly equivalent to 2.25 cups when lightly packed. This conversion is essential for baking and air frying, where precision ensures perfect texture and flavour. Whether you're whipping up cookies or a sticky glaze for air-fried chicken, getting the measurement right makes all the difference.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Brown Sugar Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Brown sugar’s moisture content means it packs differently than granulated sugar. Too much can make baked goods overly dense, while too little can leave them dry. For air fryer recipes like glazed salmon or sticky toffee pudding, the right balance ensures caramelisation without burning.</p>  
<p>At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we recommend using a kitchen scale for accuracy. If you don’t have one, lightly spooning the sugar into a measuring cup and levelling it off works.

<h2>Converting 475 Grams of Brown Sugar to Cups</h2>  
<p>The exact cup measurement depends on how tightly the sugar is packed. Lightly packed, 475g equals about 2.25 cups, while firmly packed may reduce it to 2 cups. For air fryer desserts like cinnamon rolls or brownies, consistency is key—so stick to one method throughout your recipe.</p>  
<p>If you’re adapting a <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>cake recipe</a> for the air fryer, note that brown sugar adds moisture. Adjust cooking times slightly, as air fryers heat faster than conventional ovens. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe hub</a> includes tested conversions for hassle-free baking.</p>

<h3>US vs UK Cup Measurements</h3>  
<p>In the UK, a standard cup holds 250ml, while the US uses 240ml. For 475 grams of brown sugar, this tiny difference won’t drastically alter your results. However, for precision in recipes like air-fried banana bread, using weight (grams) eliminates ambiguity.</p>

<h2>Tips for Measuring Brown Sugar Perfectly</h2>  
<p>Always use dry measuring cups for brown sugar—not liquid ones. Press it gently into the cup without compacting it too hard. If your recipe calls for "packed" sugar, press down until the cup is full and level. For air fryer-friendly treats like cookies, this ensures even spreading during cooking.</p>  
<p>Struggling with clumpy sugar? Store it with a terra cotta disc or a slice of bread to maintain moisture.

<h3>Common Recipes Using 475 Grams of Brown Sugar</h3>  
<p>This quantity is perfect for a batch of 24 cookies or a family-sized sticky pudding. In the air fryer, try reducing the sugar slightly for glazes, as the concentrated heat intensifies sweetness. For savoury twists, mix brown sugar with spices for a quick rub on air-fried pork.</p>

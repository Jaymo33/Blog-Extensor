<p>10 ml of lime juice equals approximately 0.042 cups (or roughly 1/24 of a cup). This small but crucial measurement is often needed for recipes, especially when using an air fryer for zesty marinades or dressings. Whether you're whipping up a tangy glaze for chicken or adding a citrus kick to desserts, knowing this conversion ensures precision. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we help you nail these details for flawless cooking every time.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Lime Juice Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of lime juice can make or break a dish. Too little, and your marinade lacks zest; too much, and it overpowers other flavours. In air fryer cooking, balanced acidity enhances browning and texture, especially for proteins like chicken or shrimp. For example, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer lime-crusted shrimp recipe</a> relies on precise 10 ml measurements to achieve the perfect tang. Even baking isn’t immune—citrus balances sweetness in cakes and cookies.</p>  

<p>Metric-to-cup conversions can be tricky, but they’re essential for consistency. A 10 ml lime juice measurement might seem minor, but it’s often the difference between a good dish and a great one. If you’re scaling recipes up or down, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a> simplifies the math, so you spend less time measuring and more time cooking.</p>  

<h3>Tools for Measuring Small Quantities</h3>  
<p>For 10 ml of lime juice, a graduated measuring spoon or small liquid measuring cup works best. Mini silicone cups with ml markings are also handy for sticky ingredients like lime juice. If you’re improvising, remember that 2 teaspoons equal roughly 10 ml—though for accuracy, proper tools are ideal. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning guide</a> to keep these tools spotless after use.</p>  

<h2>Common Recipes Using 10 ml of Lime Juice</h2>  
<p>Many air fryer recipes call for 10 ml of lime juice to brighten flavours. Try it in a Vietnamese-inspired dipping sauce for spring rolls, or mix it with honey for a glaze on air-fried salmon. Even desserts like key lime pie bites benefit from this precise measurement. For inspiration, browse our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert category</a>, where citrus plays a starring role.</p>  

<p>Lime juice also tenderises meats in marinades. A 10 ml portion, combined with garlic and herbs, works wonders on chicken thighs or prawns. The acidity helps the air fryer achieve a crispy exterior while keeping the inside juicy.

<h3>Converting Larger Quantities</h3>  
<p>If your recipe scales up, remember that 240 ml (1 cup) equals 24 times the 10 ml measurement. For batches, like a big marinade or punch, this ratio keeps flavours balanced. Always taste as you go—especially with potent ingredients like lime juice.</p>

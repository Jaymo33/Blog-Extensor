<p>256°C converts to approximately 230°C in a fan oven. This 10% reduction is standard for most fan-assisted ovens in the UK. When using an air fryer, which works similarly to a fan oven, you'll typically follow the same conversion rule. Whether you're baking, roasting, or air frying, understanding this temperature adjustment is key to perfect results.</p>

<h2>Understanding Fan Oven Temperature Conversions</h2>
<p>The general rule for converting conventional oven temperatures to fan oven settings is to reduce the temperature by 20°C or about 10%. For 256°C, this means setting your fan oven to 230°C. This adjustment accounts for the more efficient heat distribution in fan ovens. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we've found this conversion works perfectly for most recipes from cakes to roasts.</p>

<p>When using an air fryer, which essentially functions as a mini convection oven, the same principle applies. The circulating hot air cooks food more efficiently than a traditional oven. This means you can achieve the same results at slightly lower temperatures. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> shows how these temperatures translate across different cooking methods.</p>

<h3>Why 256°C Matters in Baking</h3>
<p>256°C (or 230°C in a fan oven) is a crucial temperature for certain baking applications. It's ideal for creating crisp pastry while keeping the inside tender. When making puff pastry or vol-au-vents, this temperature gives the perfect balance between browning and thorough cooking. In an air fryer, you might need to reduce cooking time by 20% when using this temperature.</p>

<h2>Air Fryer Equivalent for 256°C</h2>
<p>For air fryer users, 256°C converts to about 230°C, just like in a fan oven. However, because air fryers are more compact, you might find cooking times are shorter. When adapting recipes from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>cake recipes</a> or other baked goods, start checking for doneness a few minutes earlier than the recipe suggests.</p>

<p>The circulating air in both fan ovens and air fryers creates more even cooking, but can also dry out food if you're not careful. For meats and vegetables at this temperature, consider lightly covering with foil or using a spritz of oil. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a> includes specific tips for different foods at various temperatures.</p>

<h3>Special Considerations for 256°C Cooking</h3>
<p>At 256°C (230°C fan), some ingredients behave differently. Sugar caramelises faster, fats render more quickly, and proteins firm up sooner. This makes it excellent for achieving golden crusts on bread or sealing in juices for meats. When using an air fryer at this temperature, preheating becomes even more important to ensure consistent results.</p>

<h2>Temperature Accuracy and Calibration</h2>
<p>Not all ovens or air fryers maintain exact temperatures, especially at higher ranges like 256°C. It's worth investing in an oven thermometer to verify your appliance's accuracy. If you find your fan oven runs hot, you might need to reduce the temperature further. The same applies to air fryers - our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning guide</a> explains how buildup can affect temperature performance.</p>

<p>For those converting American recipes that use Fahrenheit, remember that 256°C equals about 493°F. The fan oven conversion would then be approximately 443°F. This high heat is particularly useful for pizza or artisan bread baking. When using an air fryer for these applications, you might need to adjust rack positions or use accessories to prevent burning.</p>

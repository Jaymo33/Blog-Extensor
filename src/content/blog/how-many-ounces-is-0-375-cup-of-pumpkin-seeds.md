<p>0.375 cup of pumpkin seeds equals approximately 1.5 ounces. This measurement is essential for air fryer recipes where precision ensures even cooking and perfect texture. Whether you’re roasting pumpkin seeds or adding them to a dish, knowing the exact weight helps avoid over or under-seasoning. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we focus on accurate conversions to make your cooking seamless. Let’s dive deeper into why this measurement matters and how to use it effectively.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air frying</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on precise ingredient quantities to ensure even heat distribution and consistent results. Using 0.375 cup of pumpkin seeds (1.5 ounces) guarantees the right balance for roasting or baking. Too many seeds can overcrowd the basket, leading to uneven cooking, while too few may burn quickly. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> simplifies these calculations for hassle-free cooking. Stick to the correct weight, and your pumpkin seeds will turn out perfectly crispy every time.</p>  

<p>Many air fryer recipes, like those in our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipes section</a>, specify weights rather than volumes for accuracy. Pumpkin seeds, for example, can vary in density, so weighing them removes guesswork. If you’re preparing a batch of spiced seeds or adding them to granola, 0.375 cup (1.5 ounces) ensures consistency. Always measure ingredients like pumpkin seeds by weight when possible for the best air fryer results.</p>  

<h3>How to measure 0.375 cup of pumpkin seeds</h3>  
<p>To measure 0.375 cup of pumpkin seeds, use a dry measuring cup and fill it just under halfway. For greater precision, a kitchen scale is ideal—set it to ounces and measure out 1.5 ounces directly. This method eliminates packing discrepancies and ensures you’re using the exact amount needed. If you’re adapting a recipe from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/snacks>snack recipes</a>, converting cups to ounces is straightforward with our guides.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for 0.375 cup of pumpkin seeds</h2>  
<p>Roasting 0.375 cup (1.5 ounces) of pumpkin seeds in your air fryer creates a crunchy, nutritious snack. Toss them with olive oil, salt, and spices for a quick treat. They also work well sprinkled over salads or blended into granola bars. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/breakfast>breakfast recipes</a> for creative ways to incorporate pumpkin seeds. Their high protein and fibre content make them a healthy addition to many dishes.</p>  

<p>Another great use for 0.375 cup of pumpkin seeds is in baking. Add them to bread or muffin batter for extra crunch and nutrition. Since air fryers excel at toasting seeds evenly, they’re perfect for prepping ingredients. After measuring your 1.5 ounces, roast them lightly before mixing into dough. This enhances their flavour and ensures they stay crisp in the final bake.</p>  

<h3>Tips for storing pumpkin seeds</h3>  
<p>Once you’ve measured 0.375 cup (1.5 ounces) of pumpkin seeds, store any leftovers in an airtight container. Keep them in a cool, dark place to maintain freshness. Proper storage prevents rancidity and preserves their nutritional value.

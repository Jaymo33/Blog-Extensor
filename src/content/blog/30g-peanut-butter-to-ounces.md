<h2>Why Convert 30g of Peanut Butter to Ounces?</h2>  
<p>Many UK recipes, especially those for air fryers, use grams for accuracy, while some kitchen scales or older recipes might list ounces.

<h2>How to Measure 30g of Peanut Butter Accurately</h2>  
<p>Using a digital kitchen scale is the easiest way to measure 30g of peanut butter. Simply zero the scale with your container, then scoop the peanut butter until it hits 30g. If you don’t have a scale, two level tablespoons (about 30ml) will roughly equal 30g, though this can vary slightly depending on the peanut butter’s density.</p>  
<p>For sticky ingredients like peanut butter, lightly greasing your measuring spoon or using a spatula can help ensure you get every bit into your mix. This trick is especially handy for air fryer recipes like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cookies>peanut butter cookies</a>, where consistency is key.</p>

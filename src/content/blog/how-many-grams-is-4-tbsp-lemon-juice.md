<p>4 tablespoons (tbsp) of lemon juice weigh approximately 60 grams (g). This conversion is essential for precise cooking, especially when using an air fryer, where accurate measurements can make or break a recipe. Whether you're preparing a marinade, dressing, or dessert, knowing the exact weight ensures consistency. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we help you nail every detail, from conversions to perfect cooking times.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on precise ingredient ratios to deliver crispy, evenly cooked results. Too much or too little lemon juice can alter the texture and flavour of your dish. For example, a marinade with excess liquid might make chicken soggy, while too little could leave it dry. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> simplifies these calculations, so you never have to guess.</p>  

<p>Lemon juice is a common ingredient in air fryer recipes, from tangy glazes to citrusy desserts. Knowing that 4 tbsp equals 60 grams helps you follow recipes accurately, whether you're scaling up or down. If you're experimenting with new dishes, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> for inspiration.</p>  

<h3>How to measure lemon juice correctly</h3>  
<p>For the most accurate results, use a digital kitchen scale to weigh lemon juice directly. If you don't have one, a standard UK tablespoon holds about 15 millilitres (ml) of liquid, which roughly translates to 15 grams for lemon juice. However, slight variations can occur depending on the juiciness of the lemons.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for 4 tbsp of lemon juice in air fryer recipes</h2>  
<p>Four tablespoons of lemon juice (60g) can transform your air fryer dishes. It's perfect for marinating chicken, adding zest to roasted vegetables, or creating a light citrus drizzle for desserts. For a quick and healthy option, try our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>lemon garlic chicken</a>, where precise measurements ensure juicy, flavourful results every time.</p>  

<p>Lemon juice also works wonders in cleaning your air fryer. A mixture of lemon juice and water can help remove stubborn grease and odours. For more tips on maintaining your appliance, visit our guide on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaning</a>.</p>  

<h3>Converting other lemon juice measurements</h3>  
<p>If your recipe calls for a different amount of lemon juice, here are some quick conversions: 1 tbsp equals 15g, 2 tbsp equals 30g, and 8 tbsp (½ cup) equals 120g. Keeping these numbers handy ensures you can adapt any recipe to suit your needs without hassle.</p>

<p>306°F converts to Gas Mark 2. This is a moderately low heat setting, ideal for slow baking or roasting in both ovens and air fryers. Understanding this conversion ensures your recipes turn out perfectly, whether you're using a traditional oven or a modern air fryer.</p>

<h2>Why Convert 306 F to Gas Mark?</h2>
<p>Many UK recipes use Gas Mark settings, while others specify temperatures in Fahrenheit. Knowing how to convert 306 F to Gas Mark helps you follow recipes accurately. This is especially useful when using an air fryer, as some models allow you to switch between temperature scales. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we often see questions about these conversions, particularly for baking and roasting.</p>
<p>Gas Mark 2 (306°F) is commonly used for delicate bakes like custards or slow-cooked meats. If your air fryer doesn’t have a Gas Mark setting, you can manually set it to 306°F. For more conversions, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>

<h2>How to Use 306 F in an Air Fryer</h2>
<p>Air fryers cook faster than conventional ovens, so you may need to adjust cooking times. At 306 F (Gas Mark 2), foods like chicken thighs or roasted vegetables will need less time than in an oven. Always preheat your air fryer for even cooking, and check food a few minutes early to avoid overcooking.</p>
<p>For example, if a recipe calls for 30 minutes at Gas Mark 2 in the oven, try 20-25 minutes in the air fryer. Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a> for tailored air fryer cooking times. Remember, every air fryer model varies, so keep an eye on your food.</p>

<h3>Common Foods Cooked at 306 F (Gas Mark 2)</h3>
<p>This temperature is perfect for slow-roasting tomatoes, baking cheesecakes, or reheating leftovers without drying them out. It’s also great for proofing dough or keeping dishes warm. In an air fryer, you can use 306 F for dehydrating fruits or making jerky.</p>

<h2>Gas Mark vs. Fahrenheit in Air Fryers</h2>
<p>Most modern air fryers display temperatures in Fahrenheit or Celsius, but not Gas Mark. If your recipe uses Gas Mark, converting 306 F to Gas Mark 2 ensures accuracy. Some high-end models, like those with British presets, might include Gas Mark options.</p>
<p>For cleaning tips after low-and-slow cooking, visit our guide on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer maintenance</a>. Sticky residues from slow cooking need proper care to maintain your appliance’s performance.</p>

<h3>Adjusting Recipes Between Appliances</h3>
<p>When adapting oven recipes to air fryers, temperature conversions like 306 F to Gas Mark 2 are just the start. Reduce cooking times by 20% and shake or flip food halfway through. This ensures even cooking at lower temperatures.</p>

<h2>Historical Context of Gas Mark</h2>
<p>The Gas Mark system was developed for UK gas ovens and remains popular in British cookbooks. While 306 F (Gas Mark 2) is a standard conversion, some vintage recipes might use slightly different values. Always cross-check if using older recipes in modern air fryers.</p>

<p>194 C converts to approximately 170 C in a fan oven. This is because fan ovens circulate hot air, allowing you to reduce the temperature by around 20-25 degrees while maintaining the same cooking results. Whether you're using a conventional oven or an air fryer, understanding this conversion is key to perfect dishes every time.</p>

<h2>Why Convert 194 C to Fan Oven?</h2>
<p>Fan ovens cook food faster and more evenly than conventional ovens. When a recipe calls for 194 C, reducing it to 170 C in a fan oven prevents overcooking. This is especially important for delicate bakes like souffl√©s or precise air fryer recipes. Many modern air fryers operate similarly to fan ovens, making this conversion useful across appliances.</p>
<p>At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we recommend always checking your appliance manual. Some air fryers may need slight adjustments to the 194 C to fan oven conversion based on their heating elements.

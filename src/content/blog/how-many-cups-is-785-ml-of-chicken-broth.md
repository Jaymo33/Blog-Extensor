<h2>Understanding the Conversion from ml to Cups</h2>
<p>Converting 785 ml of chicken broth to cups is straightforward once you know the basics. One standard cup holds about 240 ml, so dividing 785 by 240 gives you roughly 3.3 cups.

<p>Different countries use slightly varying cup sizes, so always double-check if following an international recipe. In the UK and US, the standard cup measurement is close enough for most cooking needs. If you're scaling a recipe up or down, this conversion ensures consistency.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>
<p>Air fryers rely on precise ingredient ratios to achieve crispy, evenly cooked results. Using 785 ml of chicken broth instead of the correct cup measurement could throw off moisture levels. Too much liquid might make dishes soggy, while too little could dry them out. Visit <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>our recipe hub</a> for perfectly measured air fryer meals.</p>

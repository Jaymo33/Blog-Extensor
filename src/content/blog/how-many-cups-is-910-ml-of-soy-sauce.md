<h3>How to Measure 910 ml of Soy Sauce Without a Measuring Cup</h3>  
<p>If you don't have a measuring cup handy, you can still measure 910 ml of soy sauce using common kitchen tools. A standard UK metric cup holds 250 ml, so 910 ml is just under four cups (3.64 to be exact). For smaller quantities, a tablespoon holds about 15 ml, meaning you'd need roughly 61 tablespoons to reach 910 ml. However, using a measuring jug or digital scale is far more efficient.</p>

If your recipe calls for cups instead of millilitres, remember that 910 ml is roughly 3.85 cups, making it easy to adjust quantities on the fly.</p>  

<p>Some recipes, like marinades or dipping sauces, may require smaller amounts. In such cases, you can easily scale down the measurement. For example, half of 910 ml (455 ml) is about 1.92 cups.

<h3>Does Soy Sauce Brand Affect the Measurement?</h3>  
<p>While most soy sauces have a similar density, slight variations between brands can affect measurements. However, the difference is negligible for home cooking. Whether you're using Kikkoman, Lee Kum Kee, or a supermarket brand, 910 ml will still equate to approximately 3.85 cups. For best results, stick to the same brand throughout your recipe to maintain consistency.</p>  

<h2>Tips for Storing Leftover Soy Sauce</h2>  
<p>If you've opened a 910 ml bottle of soy sauce but only used a portion, proper storage is key. Transfer any unused soy sauce to an airtight container and refrigerate it to preserve freshness. Glass bottles or jars with tight-fitting lids work best.

Always check the expiry date before using it in your air fryer recipes.</p>

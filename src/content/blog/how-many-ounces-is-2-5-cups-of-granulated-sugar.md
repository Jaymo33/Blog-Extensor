<p>2.5 cups of granulated sugar equals approximately 17.64 ounces. This conversion is essential for air fryer baking, where precise measurements can make or break your recipe. Whether you're making cookies, cakes, or other sweet treats in your air fryer, knowing the exact weight ensures consistency. For more air fryer conversions, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate sugar measurements matter</h2>  
<p>Granulated sugar is a staple in many air fryer recipes, from desserts to glazes. Using the correct amount ensures your baked goods have the right texture and sweetness. Too much sugar can lead to overly crisp or burnt edges, while too little may result in bland flavours. If you're new to air fryer baking, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> section has plenty of inspiration. Always measure sugar carefully, especially when scaling recipes up or down.</p>  

<p>Different types of sugar have varying densities, so granulated sugar’s weight per cup differs from brown or powdered sugar. For 2.5 cups of granulated sugar, the 17.64-ounce measurement is based on standard UK cup sizes. If you’re using a different measuring system, double-check conversions to avoid mistakes. A kitchen scale is the most accurate tool, but cup measurements work well if you don’t have one.</p>  

<h3>How to measure granulated sugar for air fryer recipes</h3>  
<p>Scoop the sugar into your measuring cup and level it off with a straight edge for accuracy. Avoid packing the sugar down, as this can lead to over-measuring. For best results, weigh your sugar if the recipe provides ounce measurements. Many air fryer dessert recipes, like those in our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>cake category</a>, rely on precise sugar amounts for perfect texture.</p>  

<h2>Common air fryer recipes using 2.5 cups of sugar</h2>  
<p>Many air fryer desserts call for around 2.5 cups of granulated sugar. Classic pound cakes, cookies, and even some glazes require this amount for balanced sweetness. If you’re making a large batch of <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cookies>cookies</a>, this measurement ensures uniformity across all batches. Always preheat your air fryer for even baking, and consider rotating trays for consistent results.</p>  

<p>For sticky glazes or caramelised toppings, 2.5 cups of sugar can be melted down for a glossy finish. Just be cautious with timing, as sugar can burn quickly in the air fryer’s intense heat. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning guide</a> for tips on removing sticky sugar residue afterwards. Proper measurement and technique make all the difference in air fryer baking.</p>  

<h3>Converting other sugar measurements</h3>  
<p>If your recipe uses ounces instead of cups, remember that 1 cup of granulated sugar is roughly 7.05 ounces. This makes 2.5 cups equal to 17.64 ounces, as mentioned earlier. For larger or smaller batches, adjust the measurements proportionally. Always cross-reference with your recipe to avoid errors, especially when trying new dishes from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>.</p>

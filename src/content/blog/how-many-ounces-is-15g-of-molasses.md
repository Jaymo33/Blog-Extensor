<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>When it comes to baking or cooking in an air fryer, precision is key. Molasses, with its thick consistency, can easily throw off a recipe if not measured correctly. Too much or too little can affect texture, sweetness, and even cooking time. For example, a sticky gingerbread cake or a glaze for roasted vegetables requires the right balance. That’s why converting 15g of molasses to ounces (0.53 oz) ensures consistency. Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> for dishes where molasses shines.</p>  

<p>Using a kitchen scale is the most accurate way to measure 15g of molasses. However, if you don’t have one, a tablespoon can work in a pinch—just remember it’s not as precise. For air fryer cooking, where even heat distribution is crucial, exact measurements help avoid soggy or overcooked results. Molasses adds depth to marinades, sauces, and even <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>desserts</a>, so getting it right matters.

<h3>Using Molasses in Air Fryer Recipes</h3>  
<p>Molasses works wonders in air fryer recipes, from glazes to baked goods. Its rich, caramel-like flavour enhances both sweet and savoury dishes.

<h2>Common Mistakes When Measuring Molasses</h2>  
<p>One of the biggest mistakes is eyeballing molasses instead of weighing it. Its sticky texture makes it easy to over-pour, leading to overly sweet or dense results. Another error is using volume measurements (like teaspoons) instead of weight, which isn’t as accurate. For 15g of molasses, always opt for a scale or refer to our 0.53-ounce conversion. Proper measuring ensures your air fryer dishes turn out just right—every time.</p>  

<p>Storing molasses correctly also matters. Keep it in a cool, dark place to maintain its consistency and flavour. If your molasses hardens, gently warm the jar in warm water to make measuring easier. For more tips on handling ingredients, visit <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>.

<p>125g of baking soda equals approximately 4.41 ounces. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes and baking, where precise measurements can make or break your dish. Whether you're whipping up a batch of air fryer cookies or using baking soda to clean your appliance, knowing the exact weight ensures accuracy.</p>

<h2>Why converting 125g of baking soda to ounces matters</h2>  
<p>Accurate measurements are crucial in baking and cooking, especially when using an air fryer. Too much or too little baking soda can affect the texture and rise of your baked goods. For example, if you're following a recipe from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, getting the conversion right ensures your cakes or cookies turn out perfectly. Even for cleaning purposes, the right amount of baking soda ensures effective results without waste.</p>  

<p>Many UK recipes use grams, while some older or international recipes might list ingredients in ounces. Converting 125g of baking soda to ounces (4.41 oz) bridges this gap, making it easier to follow any recipe. This is particularly helpful if you're experimenting with air fryer desserts or savoury dishes from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>our cake category</a>.</p>  

<h3>How to measure 125g of baking soda without scales</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a kitchen scale, you can use measuring spoons to approximate 125g of baking soda. One tablespoon of baking soda weighs about 15g, so 125g would be roughly 8 level tablespoons. However, for precision in air fryer recipes, we recommend using a digital scale.

A 125g portion is perfect for making a paste to clean stubborn grease or neutralising odours between uses.

<p>In cooking, 125g of baking soda is often used in larger batches of air fryer recipes, such as cakes or bread. It helps with leavening, ensuring your baked goods rise evenly. If you're preparing a big batch of <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cookies>cookies</a>, this measurement ensures consistency across all your treats.</p>  

<h3>Converting other baking soda amounts</h3>  
<p>If your recipe calls for more or less than 125g of baking soda, you can easily adjust the conversion. For example, 100g is about 3.53 ounces, while 150g is roughly 5.29 ounces. Keeping a conversion chart handy, like the one on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, simplifies the process for any air fryer recipe.</p>

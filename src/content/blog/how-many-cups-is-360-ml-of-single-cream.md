<p>360 ml of single cream is approximately 1.5 cups in UK measurements or 1.52 cups in US measurements. Whether you're whipping up a creamy sauce or baking a delicious dessert, knowing this conversion ensures your recipes turn out perfectly every time. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we understand the importance of precise measurements, especially when using an air fryer.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter</h2>
<p>Using the correct amount of single cream can make or break your dish. Too little, and your sauce might be too thick. Too much, and it could become runny. This is especially crucial for air fryer recipes, where consistency affects cooking times. For more air fryer tips, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>
<p>Single cream is a staple in many recipes, from soups to desserts. Whether you're following a British or American recipe, knowing how to convert 360 ml of single cream to cups ensures you get it right. This is particularly helpful when scaling recipes up or down.</p>

<h2>UK vs US Cup Measurements</h2>
<p>In the UK, 1 cup equals 250 ml, making 360 ml of single cream roughly 1.5 cups. In the US, 1 cup is 240 ml, so 360 ml converts to about 1.52 cups. This slight difference might not seem like much, but it can affect the outcome of delicate recipes.</p>
<p>If you're using an air fryer, precision is key. A little extra cream could alter the texture of your dish. For more detailed guides, visit our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipes section</a>, where we cover everything from creamy pasta bakes to indulgent desserts.</p>

<h3>How to Measure Single Cream Without a Measuring Cup</h3>
<p>Don't have a measuring cup? No problem. You can use a standard mug, which typically holds around 300 ml. For 360 ml of single cream, fill the mug to just over halfway. Alternatively, use a kitchen scale—360 ml of single cream weighs roughly 360 grams.</p>

<h3>Common Uses for 360 ml of Single Cream</h3>
<p>Single cream is versatile. Use it in soups, sauces, or even <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>desserts</a>. It adds richness without being too heavy. In an air fryer, it's perfect for creamy pasta dishes or custards. Just remember to measure accurately for best results.</p>

<h2>Tips for Storing Single Cream</h2>
<p>Once opened, single cream should be used within a few days. Store it in the coldest part of your fridge, usually at the back. If you're not using it all, consider freezing it in portions. Thawed cream is best used in cooked dishes rather than whipped.</p>

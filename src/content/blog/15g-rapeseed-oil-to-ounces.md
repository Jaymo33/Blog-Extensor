<h2>Why Convert 15g of Rapeseed Oil to Ounces?</h2>  
<p>Many UK recipes, especially those for air fryers, list ingredients in grams, while some kitchen scales or international recipes use ounces. Converting 15g of rapeseed oil to ounces (0.53 oz) helps maintain accuracy, ensuring your food cooks evenly. Rapeseed oil is a popular choice for air frying due to its high smoke point and neutral flavour.</p>

<h3>How to Measure 15g of Rapeseed Oil Accurately</h3>  
<p>Using a digital kitchen scale is the easiest way to measure 15g of rapeseed oil. If your scale displays ounces, you'll see it’s roughly 0.53 oz. For those without scales, a standard teaspoon holds about 5ml (roughly 4.5g) of oil, so 15g would be just over three teaspoons. However, weighing is always more precise.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for 15g of Rapeseed Oil in Air Fryers</h2>  
<p>Rapeseed oil is versatile in air fryer cooking. A 15g portion (0.53 oz) is perfect for lightly coating vegetables, chicken wings, or even homemade chips. Its high smoke point (around 230°C) makes it ideal for air frying, preventing burnt flavours while ensuring crispy results.</p>  

<p>For delicious <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/potatoes>potato recipes</a>, tossing 15g of rapeseed oil with your spuds before air frying guarantees golden, crunchy perfection. Similarly, a light drizzle over <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>roasted vegetables</a> enhances flavour without excess grease.</p>  

<h3>Does Rapeseed Oil Affect Cooking Times?</h3>  
<p>Using 15g of rapeseed oil won’t drastically change cooking times, but it ensures even heat distribution. Unlike heavier oils, rapeseed oil spreads thinly, helping food crisp up faster. Always preheat your air fryer for the best results, and check our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> for timing tips.</p>  

<h2>Storing and Handling Rapeseed Oil</h2>  
<p>To keep rapeseed oil fresh, store it in a cool, dark place. A 15g portion is small, but if you buy in bulk, decanting into smaller bottles helps maintain quality. After cooking, clean your air fryer basket with our recommended <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner</a> to prevent oil buildup.</p>  

<p>Rapeseed oil has a long shelf life, but always check for rancidity. If it smells off, discard it—fresh oil ensures the best flavour for your air fryer dishes. Proper storage means your 15g measurements will always be spot-on.</p>

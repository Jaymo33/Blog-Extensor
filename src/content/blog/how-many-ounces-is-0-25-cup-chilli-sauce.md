<p>0.25 cup of chilli sauce equals approximately 2 ounces, making it easy to measure for your air fryer recipes. Whether you're whipping up a spicy glaze or adding a kick to your dish, knowing this conversion ensures precision. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we focus on simplifying measurements so you can cook with confidence.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on precise ingredient ratios to deliver perfectly crispy results. Too much or too little chilli sauce can alter the texture and flavour of your dish. For example, 0.25 cup of chilli sauce (2 ounces) is ideal for marinating chicken or drizzling over vegetables.

<p>Using the right amount of chilli sauce ensures even cooking and prevents sogginess. Whether you're making spicy wings or a tangy dip, 0.25 cup (2 ounces) strikes the perfect balance. Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipes</a> for inspiration on how to use this measurement effectively.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure 0.25 Cup of Chilli Sauce</h3>  
<p>To measure 0.25 cup of chilli sauce, use a liquid measuring cup for accuracy. Fill it to the quarter-cup mark, which translates to 2 ounces. If you don’t have a measuring cup, a standard UK tablespoon holds 0.5 ounces, so four tablespoons will give you the equivalent of 0.25 cup.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for 0.25 Cup of Chilli Sauce</h2>  
<p>This measurement is perfect for small-batch recipes, like glazing salmon or adding heat to tofu. A 0.25 cup (2 ounces) of chilli sauce can also be mixed with other ingredients for a quick marinade.

<h3>Converting Other Sauces to Ounces</h3>

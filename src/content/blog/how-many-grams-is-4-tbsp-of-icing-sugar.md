<p>4 tablespoons (tbsp) of icing sugar equals approximately 30 grams (g). This conversion is essential for precise baking, especially when using an air fryer, where measurements can make or break a recipe. Whether you’re whipping up a cake or dusting desserts, knowing the exact weight ensures consistency.

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer baking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers cook food quickly and evenly, but only if ingredients are measured correctly. Too much or too little icing sugar can affect texture and taste, especially in delicate recipes like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>air fryer cakes</a>. A slight imbalance might lead to overly sweet or dry results. Using grams instead of tablespoons removes guesswork, ensuring your bakes turn out perfect every time.</p>  

<p>Digital kitchen scales are the best tool for precise measurements. If you don’t have one, our conversion guide helps you approximate 4 tbsp icing sugar to grams accurately. For more baking tips, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> collection.</p>  

<h2>How to measure 4 tbsp of icing sugar without scales</h2>  
<p>If you don’t own scales, spoon your icing sugar into a tablespoon and level it off with a knife for accuracy. Avoid packing the sugar down, as this can lead to over-measuring. Four level tablespoons should give you roughly 30 grams, but slight variations can occur depending on how finely the sugar is ground.</p>  

<h3>Common mistakes when converting tablespoons to grams</h3>  
<p>One frequent error is using heaped tablespoons instead of level ones, which adds extra grams. Another is assuming all sugars weigh the same—icing sugar is lighter than granulated sugar due to its fine texture. Always check specific conversions for each ingredient to avoid mishaps in your air fryer creations.</p>  

<h2>Using 4 tbsp icing sugar in air fryer recipes</h2>  
<p>Icing sugar is a staple in desserts like doughnuts, shortbread, and <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cookies>cookies</a>. In an air fryer, it’s perfect for dusting or mixing into batters. Since air fryers circulate hot air, evenly measured ingredients prevent uneven cooking. For example, 30 grams of icing sugar in a glaze ensures the right consistency for coating.</p>  

<p>Storing icing sugar correctly also matters. Keep it in an airtight container to avoid clumping, which can throw off measurements. For more tips on maintaining your appliance, see our guide on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning your air fryer</a>.</p>  

<h3>Adjusting recipes for different air fryer models</h3>  
<p>Some air fryers run hotter than others, affecting how sugars caramelise. If your model has strong heating elements, slightly reducing sugar quantities can prevent burning. Always test small batches first when adapting recipes to your specific appliance.</p>

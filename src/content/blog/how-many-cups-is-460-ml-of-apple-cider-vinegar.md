<p>460 ml of apple cider vinegar equals approximately 1.94 cups. This conversion is essential for recipes requiring precise measurements, especially when using an air fryer. Whether you're marinating chicken or baking a cake, knowing how to convert millilitres to cups ensures consistency and perfect results every time.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Using the correct amount of apple cider vinegar can make or break a recipe. Too much can overpower flavours, while too little might not deliver the desired tang. For air fryer recipes, precise measurements ensure even cooking and balanced taste. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes</a>, you’ll find dishes where exact measurements are key.</p>  

<p>Apple cider vinegar is a versatile ingredient, often used in dressings, marinades, and even baking. Whether you're following a UK or US recipe, converting 460 ml to cups helps avoid confusion. A standard UK cup holds 250 ml, while a US cup is 240 ml, so slight adjustments may be needed depending on your recipe’s origin.</p>  

<h3>Converting 460 ml to Cups</h3>  
<p>To convert 460 ml of apple cider vinegar to cups, divide the millilitres by the cup size you’re using. For UK measurements, 460 ÷ 250 = 1.84 cups. For US measurements, 460 ÷ 240 ≈ 1.92 cups. Most recipes round this to 1.94 cups for simplicity, ensuring accuracy without overcomplicating measurements.</p>  

<h2>Using Apple Cider Vinegar in Air Fryer Recipes</h2>  
<p>Apple cider vinegar adds a delightful tang to air-fried dishes like crispy chicken wings or glazed vegetables. Its acidity also helps tenderise meat, making it a favourite for marinades. For more inspiration, explore <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken</a> for delicious ideas.</p>  

<p>When preparing sauces or dressings, 460 ml of apple cider vinegar can be a game-changer. Mix it with oil and herbs for a quick vinaigrette, or use it to deglaze your air fryer basket after cooking. The possibilities are endless, and precise measurements ensure consistent results every time.</p>  

<h3>Common Uses for 460 ml of Apple Cider Vinegar</h3>  
<p>Beyond cooking, 460 ml of apple cider vinegar is often used for homemade cleaning solutions or health tonics. However, in the kitchen, it’s perfect for pickling vegetables or creating tangy BBQ sauces. Check out <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart</a> for more handy measurement guides.</p>  

<h2>Tips for Measuring Liquids Accurately</h2>  
<p>Always use a liquid measuring cup for apple cider vinegar to ensure precision. Eyeballing it can lead to inconsistencies, especially in baking. For air fryer recipes, a slight variation can affect texture and flavour, so measuring correctly is crucial.</p>  

<p>If you don’t have a measuring cup, a kitchen scale can help. Since 1 ml of apple cider vinegar weighs roughly 1 gram, 460 ml equals 460 grams. This method is handy for those who prefer weighing ingredients. For more tips, visit <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>.</p>  

<h3>Adjusting Recipes for Different Cup Sizes</h3>  
<p>If your recipe calls for 460 ml of apple cider vinegar but uses a different cup size, adjust accordingly. For example, Australian cups hold 250 ml, similar to the UK, while Canadian cups align with the US. Always double-check the recipe’s origin to avoid measurement mishaps.</p>

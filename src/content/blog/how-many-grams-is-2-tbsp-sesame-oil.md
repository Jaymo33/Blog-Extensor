<p>2 tablespoons (tbsp) of sesame oil weigh approximately 28 grams in the UK. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements can make or break a dish. Whether you’re marinating chicken or drizzling oil over roasted vegetables, knowing the exact weight ensures consistency. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we focus on helping you achieve perfect results with accurate conversions. Let’s dive deeper into why this measurement matters and how to use it effectively.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate sesame oil measurements matter</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of sesame oil is crucial for flavour and texture in air fryer cooking. Too little oil, and your food may dry out; too much, and it can become greasy. For example, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>sesame-glazed salmon recipe</a> relies on precise oil measurements for the perfect glaze. A 28-gram equivalent of 2 tbsp ensures even coating without overpowering the dish. This accuracy is especially important when adapting recipes from volume to weight measurements.</p>  

<p>Many home cooks prefer weighing ingredients for better consistency. Unlike volume measurements, weight isn’t affected by how you fill the spoon. Whether you’re preparing a <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken stir-fry</a> or crispy tofu, 28 grams of sesame oil delivers the right balance. It’s also easier to scale recipes up or down when working in grams, making meal prep simpler.</p>  

<h3>How to measure sesame oil correctly</h3>  
<p>For the most accurate results, use a digital kitchen scale to weigh your sesame oil. Simply place your container on the scale, tare it to zero, then pour the oil until it reaches 28 grams. If you don’t have scales, ensure your tablespoons are level—not heaped—when measuring. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> includes other common oil measurements for quick reference.</p>  

<h2>Sesame oil in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Sesame oil adds a rich, nutty flavour to air-fried dishes, from vegetables to proteins. Its high smoke point makes it ideal for air frying at typical temperatures (180-200°C). When using 2 tbsp (28g) in marinades, like for our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/beef>beef bulgogi</a>, it helps distribute flavours evenly. Remember that toasted sesame oil is more potent—you might use slightly less than the standard measurement for stronger flavour.</p>  

<p>For cleaning your air fryer after cooking with sesame oil, check out our guide on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>removing oil residues</a>. The 28-gram measurement also helps when calculating nutritional information, as oil is calorie-dense. Whether you’re meal prepping or cooking for one, precise measurements lead to better results and easier cleanup.</p>  

<h3>Common mistakes when measuring oils</h3>  
<p>One frequent error is assuming all oils weigh the same per tablespoon—they don’t. While 2 tbsp of sesame oil equals 28 grams, olive oil weighs about 27 grams for the same volume. Always check specific conversions for each oil type. Another pitfall is eyeballing measurements, which can lead to inconsistent results in recipes where oil quantity affects cooking time and texture.</p>

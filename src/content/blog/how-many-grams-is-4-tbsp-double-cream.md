<p>4 tablespoons (tbsp) of double cream weighs approximately 60 grams. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precision ensures the perfect texture and consistency. Whether you’re making a creamy sauce, dessert, or indulgent topping, knowing the exact weight helps avoid kitchen mishaps. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we focus on making measurements simple for hassle-free cooking. Keep reading for more details on conversions and recipe ideas.</p>

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on precise ingredient ratios to deliver even cooking and perfect results. Too much or too little double cream can alter the texture of your dish, especially in baked goods or sauces. For example, adding excess cream might make a cake too dense, while too little could dry it out. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> simplifies these calculations, so you never have to guess. Accurate measurements also help when scaling recipes up or down for different serving sizes.</p>  

<p>Double cream is a staple in many air fryer recipes, from creamy pasta bakes to rich desserts. Knowing that 4 tbsp equals 60 grams ensures consistency every time. If you’re experimenting with new dishes, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a> for inspiration. Whether you’re a beginner or a seasoned cook, precise measurements take the stress out of meal prep. Plus, they save time by eliminating trial and error.</p>  

<h3>How to measure double cream without scales</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a kitchen scale, you can still measure 4 tbsp of double cream accurately. Use a standard UK tablespoon (15ml per tbsp) and level it off with a knife for consistency. Remember, double cream is thick, so avoid packing it down or leaving air gaps. For smaller quantities, teaspoons (5ml) can also be used—just multiply accordingly. This method works well for recipes like our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert category</a>, where precision is key.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for 4 tbsp of double cream in air fryer recipes</h2>  
<p>Double cream adds richness to both sweet and savoury dishes. In the air fryer, it’s perfect for creating creamy sauces, custards, or even fluffy pancakes. For example, 60 grams of double cream can elevate a simple mushroom sauce or add decadence to a chocolate mousse. Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/breakfast>breakfast recipes</a> for ideas like creamy scrambled eggs or French toast. The versatility of double cream makes it a must-have for air fryer enthusiasts.</p>  

<p>Another popular use is in baking, where double cream ensures moist, tender results. Try adding it to scones or cakes for a luxurious texture. If you’re cleaning your air fryer after a creamy dish, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning guide</a> has handy tips.

<h3>Converting other cream measurements to grams</h3>  
<p>If your recipe calls for a different amount of double cream, here’s a quick reference: 1 tbsp = 15g, 2 tbsp = 30g, and 3 tbsp = 45g. For larger quantities, 100ml of double cream weighs roughly 100g. These conversions are handy for adapting recipes or substituting ingredients.

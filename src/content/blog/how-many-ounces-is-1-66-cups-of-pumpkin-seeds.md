<p>1.66 cups of pumpkin seeds equals approximately 8.5 ounces. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes, where precise measurements ensure perfectly roasted seeds every time. Whether you’re prepping a snack or adding crunch to salads, knowing the weight helps avoid over or under-seasoning. For more air fryer conversions, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on even heat distribution, so using the right amount of ingredients ensures consistent results. Too many pumpkin seeds can overcrowd the basket, leading to uneven roasting. Too few might burn quickly. Measuring by weight (ounces) is more reliable than volume (cups) for dense ingredients like seeds. If you’re new to air frying, browse our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a> for inspiration.</p>  

<p>Pumpkin seeds are a versatile ingredient, great for salads, granola, or standalone snacks. Their high oil content means they crisp up beautifully in the air fryer. For best results, toss them in a bit of oil and salt before cooking. Need cleaning tips? Our guide on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer maintenance</a> keeps your appliance in top shape.</p>  

<h3>How to measure pumpkin seeds for air frying</h3>  
<p>For the most accurate conversion, use a kitchen scale to weigh 1.66 cups of pumpkin seeds. If you don’t have one, lightly pack the seeds into a measuring cup without crushing them. Remember, 1.66 cups to ounces is roughly 8.5 oz, but slight variations can occur based on seed size and density. Explore more <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/snacks>snack recipes</a> to make the most of your air fryer.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for pumpkin seeds in air fryers</h2>  
<p>Roasted pumpkin seeds are a healthy, protein-packed snack. They’re also a crunchy topping for soups, yoghurts, or even <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>desserts</a>. In the air fryer, they cook in just 10–12 minutes at 160°C. Spice them up with paprika, cumin, or cinnamon for extra flavour. Storing them in an airtight container keeps them fresh for weeks.</p>  

<p>If you’re batch-cooking, knowing how many ounces are in 1.66 cups helps with meal prep. Double or triple the amount as needed, but avoid overfilling the air fryer basket. For larger quantities, cook in batches to ensure even crispiness. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/meal-prep>meal prep ideas</a> for time-saving tips.</p>  

<h3>Tips for perfect air-fried pumpkin seeds</h3>  
<p>Always preheat your air fryer for even cooking. Toss the seeds halfway through to prevent sticking. For extra crunch, spritz them lightly with oil before roasting. If you’re watching calories, skip the oil—they’ll still crisp up nicely. Experiment with flavours like garlic powder, chilli flakes, or even a touch of honey.</p>

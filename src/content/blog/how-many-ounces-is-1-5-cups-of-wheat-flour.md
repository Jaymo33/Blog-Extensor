<p>1.5 cups of wheat flour equals approximately 6.35 ounces (180 grams). This conversion is essential for air fryer baking, where precise measurements ensure consistent results. Whether you're whipping up cakes, cookies, or bread in your air fryer, knowing the exact weight of your flour helps avoid dry or dense outcomes. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we emphasise accuracy for flawless recipes every time.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate flour measurements matter in air fryer baking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers cook food faster and more evenly than conventional ovens, but this efficiency demands precision. Too much flour can make baked goods dry or crumbly, while too little may result in a soggy texture. Measuring 1.5 cups of wheat flour correctly (6.35 oz) ensures your air fryer recipes, like our popular <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer cakes</a>, turn out perfectly. A kitchen scale is the best tool, but if you're using cups, fluff the flour first for an accurate scoop.</p>  

<p>Different types of flour have varying densities, so wheat flour's weight differs from almond or coconut flour. For consistent results, stick to the 1.5 cups wheat flour to ounces conversion (6.35 oz). This is especially crucial for air fryer baking, where even small measurement errors can affect texture. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for other common ingredient conversions.</p>  

<h3>How to measure 1.5 cups of wheat flour without a scale</h3>  
<p>If you don't have a scale, use the spoon-and-level method for accuracy. Gently spoon flour into your measuring cup until it's heaped, then level it off with a knife. Avoid packing the flour down, as this can add extra weight—1.5 cups of wheat flour should weigh 6.35 ounces when measured correctly. This method ensures your air fryer recipes, like our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>air fryer cakes</a>, bake evenly every time.</p>  

<h2>Common air fryer recipes using 1.5 cups of wheat flour</h2>  
<p>Many air fryer recipes call for 1.5 cups of wheat flour, including muffins, scones, and small batches of cookies. For example, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer banana bread</a> uses this measurement for a perfectly moist crumb. Since air fryers circulate hot air rapidly, precise flour measurements (6.35 oz per 1.5 cups) prevent over-drying. Always preheat your air fryer for baking to ensure even cooking.</p>  

<p>If you're adapting a traditional recipe for the air fryer, reduce the flour slightly (by about 1-2 tablespoons per 1.5 cups) to account for the faster cooking time. This adjustment prevents dryness while maintaining structure. For more tips, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer maintenance guide</a> to keep your appliance in top shape for baking.</p>  

<h3>UK vs. US cup measurements for wheat flour</h3>  
<p>In the UK, 1 cup of wheat flour typically weighs 4.25 oz (120g), whereas the US uses 4.5 oz (128g) per cup. This means 1.5 cups of wheat flour equals 6.35 oz (180g) in the UK and 6.75 oz (192g) in the US. Always check your recipe's origin to ensure accuracy—especially for air fryer baking, where small differences matter.</p>

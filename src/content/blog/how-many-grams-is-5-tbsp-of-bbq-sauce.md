<p>5 tablespoons of BBQ sauce is approximately 75 grams. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements can make all the difference. Whether you’re marinating chicken or glazing ribs, knowing the exact weight ensures consistent results every time. For more handy conversions, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Using the correct amount of BBQ sauce can affect the texture and flavour of your dish. Too much sauce might make your food soggy, while too little could leave it dry. Air fryers circulate hot air, so sticky sauces like BBQ need careful measuring. If you’re prepping a batch of <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>air fryer chicken wings</a>, 75 grams of BBQ sauce will coat them perfectly. Always level your tablespoons for the most accurate results.</p>  

<p>Different brands of BBQ sauce can vary slightly in density, but 5 tbsp generally equals 75 grams. For thicker sauces, you might find it’s closer to 80 grams, while lighter ones could be around 70 grams. If precision is key, weighing your ingredients is the best approach. Visit <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> for more tips on perfecting your air fryer meals.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure BBQ Sauce Without Scales</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have kitchen scales, use standard UK tablespoons for measuring. A level tablespoon holds about 15 grams of BBQ sauce, so 5 tbsp equals roughly 75 grams. Avoid heaped spoonfuls, as this can throw off your measurements. For sticky sauces, lightly grease the spoon first to help it slide off easily. This trick works well for other condiments too, like ketchup or honey.</p>  

<h2>Converting Other BBQ Sauce Measurements</h2>  
<p>Need to adjust your recipe? Here’s a quick guide for other common conversions: 1 tbsp of BBQ sauce is about 15 grams, while 10 tbsp equals 150 grams. If your recipe calls for millilitres, 5 tbsp is roughly 75ml. These conversions are handy for scaling recipes up or down. For more inspiration, browse our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipe collection</a>.</p>  

<p>Remember that air fryer cooking times can vary depending on how much sauce you use. A heavier coating might need a few extra minutes to crisp up. If you’re cooking <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>BBQ-glazed vegetables</a>, 5 tbsp (75g) of sauce will give them a delicious caramelised finish. Always preheat your air fryer for the best results.</p>  

<h3>Tips for Cooking with BBQ Sauce in an Air Fryer</h3>  
<p>BBQ sauce can caramelise quickly in the air fryer, so keep an eye on your food to prevent burning. For even coverage, toss your ingredients in the sauce before cooking. If you’re layering, brush on a thin coat halfway through cooking. Sticky sauces like BBQ can sometimes cause mess, so lining your basket with <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer liners</a> makes cleanup easier.</p>

<h3>How to Measure 125g of Rice Without Scales</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have scales, 125g of rice is roughly half a UK measuring cup (uncooked). However, this method isn’t as precise as weighing. For best results in your air fryer, invest in a digital scale to measure 125g of rice accurately. This ensures consistency, especially for recipes like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable rice bowls</a> or crispy rice cakes.</p>

<h2>Common Uses for 125g of Rice in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>125g of rice (4.41 ounces) is a versatile portion for air fryer meals. It’s ideal for single servings or side dishes, such as fried rice or stuffed peppers. Since air fryers cook quickly, pre-measuring your rice guarantees even results without overcrowding the basket.</p>  
<p>For meal prep, 125g of rice pairs well with proteins like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>air-fried chicken</a> or tofu. It’s also the perfect amount for sushi rolls or rice pudding. Remember to fluff the rice after cooking to avoid clumping—your air fryer’s crisp function can help with texture.</p>

<h3>Does Rice Type Affect the Ounce Conversion?</h3>  
<p>No, 125g of any rice type (basmati, jasmine, or brown) still equals 4.41 ounces. However, cooking times in your air fryer may vary. Brown rice, for instance, might need a splash more water and extra time compared to white rice. Always adjust recipes based on the rice variety.</p>

<h2>Tips for Cooking 125g of Rice in Your Air Fryer</h2>  
<p>To cook 125g of rice in your air fryer, use an oven-safe dish or silicone liner. Add a 1:1.5 ratio of rice to water (125g rice to 188ml water) for fluffy results. Preheat the air fryer to 180°C and cook for 12–15 minutes, stirring halfway. For stickier rice, like for sushi, reduce the water slightly.</p>  
<p>After cooking, let the rice rest for 5 minutes to absorb residual steam. Need to clean your air fryer afterward? Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner guide</a> makes it a breeze. Proper maintenance ensures your appliance lasts longer and cooks evenly.</p>

<h3>Storing Leftover 125g Portions of Rice</h3>  
<p>Cooked 125g portions of rice can be refrigerated for up to 3 days or frozen for a month. Reheat in the air fryer at 160°C for 4–5 minutes, sprinkling with water to revive moisture. Avoid reheating more than once for food safety.</p>

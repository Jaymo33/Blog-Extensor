<p>20g of cream is approximately 0.7 ounces. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements can make all the difference. Whether you're whipping up a dessert or adding cream to a savoury dish, knowing how to convert grams to ounces ensures perfect results every time. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we help simplify these conversions so you can focus on cooking.</p>  

<h2>Why convert 20g of cream to ounces?</h2>  
<p>Many UK recipes use grams, but some kitchen scales or older cookbooks might list ingredients in ounces. Converting 20g of cream to ounces (0.7 oz) ensures accuracy, especially in air fryer cooking where ingredient ratios matter. Cream is a common ingredient in dishes like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>desserts</a> and creamy sauces, so getting the measurement right is key. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> makes these calculations effortless.</p>  

<p>Using the correct amount of cream prevents dishes from becoming too rich or too thin. For example, adding too much cream to an air fryer cheesecake could make it soggy, while too little might leave it dry. Measuring 20g of cream (0.7 oz) precisely helps maintain the perfect texture and flavour balance in your cooking.</p>  

<h3>How to measure 20g of cream without scales</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have digital scales, you can still measure 20g of cream using tablespoons. One tablespoon of cream weighs roughly 15g, so 20g is just over 1.3 tablespoons. This method isn’t as precise as weighing but works in a pinch for recipes like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/breakfast>breakfast</a> bakes or creamy pasta sauces.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for 20g of cream in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>20g of cream is a versatile amount used in many air fryer recipes. It’s perfect for enriching scrambled eggs, adding moisture to cakes, or creating a light glaze for scones. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes</a>, you’ll find plenty of dishes where this measurement comes in handy, from creamy dips to indulgent desserts.</p>  

<p>Another great use for 20g of cream is in air fryer mashed potatoes. Adding just 0.7 ounces of cream ensures they stay fluffy without becoming overly heavy. It’s also ideal for balancing the acidity in tomato-based sauces or adding richness to <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken</a> dishes without overwhelming other flavours.</p>  

<h3>Tips for storing leftover cream</h3>  
<p>If your recipe only calls for 20g of cream, you’ll need to store the rest properly. Keep it in an airtight container in the fridge and use it within 3 days. For longer storage, freeze cream in ice cube trays—each cube holds about 15g, making it easy to portion for future <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer meals</a>.</p>

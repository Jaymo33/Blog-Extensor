<h2>Why accurate gelatin measurements matter</h2>  
<p>Gelatin powder is a finicky ingredient—too much, and your dessert turns rubbery; too little, and it won’t set. For air fryer-friendly desserts like panna cotta or jelly-based treats, 20g of gelatin powder (0.71 oz) is a common measurement. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> simplifies these calculations, so you never have to guess. Whether you’re scaling a recipe or adapting it for your air fryer, precision is key.</p>  

<p>Many UK recipes use grams, but if your kitchen scale only measures ounces, this conversion is a lifesaver. Gelatin’s strength also varies by brand, so sticking to the exact 20g (0.71 oz) ensures consistency.

<h3>How to measure 20g of gelatin powder without a scale</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a scale, use a tablespoon to measure 20g of gelatin powder. One level tablespoon holds about 7g, so you’ll need just under 3 tablespoons for 20g (0.71 oz). For powdered gelatin, always fluff it up before scooping to avoid compacting. This method isn’t as precise as weighing, but it works in a pinch for recipes like air fryer marshmallows or mousses.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for 20g of gelatin powder</h2>  
<p>From air fryer-friendly jellies to no-bake cheesecakes, 20g of gelatin powder (0.71 oz) is a versatile amount. It’s enough to set 500ml of liquid firmly, making it ideal for individual desserts or small batches. If you’re experimenting with <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>air fryer desserts</a>, this measurement is a great starting point. Adjust slightly based on your desired texture—less for softer set, more for firmer results.</p>  

<p>Gelatin also works wonders in savoury dishes, like air fryer terrines or aspics. For these, 20g (0.71 oz) provides enough structure without overpowering flavours. After cooking, always clean your air fryer basket with our recommended <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner</a> to remove any sticky residues.</p>  

<h3>Converting other gelatin amounts</h3>

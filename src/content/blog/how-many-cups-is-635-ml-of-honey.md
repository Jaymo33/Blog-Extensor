<p>635 ml of honey is approximately 2.68 cups in standard US measurements. If you're working with UK metric cups, it's roughly 2.54 cups. Honey's thick consistency means measuring it accurately is crucial for recipes, especially when using an air fryer where precision affects cooking times.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Honey Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Getting the right amount of honey ensures your recipes turn out perfectly. Too much can make dishes overly sweet or sticky, while too little might leave them bland. Air fryer recipes, like glazed chicken or honey-roasted vegetables, rely on precise measurements for even cooking. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more handy tips.</p>  

<p>Honey’s viscosity also means it can be tricky to pour. Using a liquid measuring cup or a kitchen scale helps avoid mess and inaccuracies. For air fryer baking, such as honey cakes or cookies, even small measurement errors can alter texture and browning.</p>  

<h3>US vs. UK Cup Measurements</h3>  
<p>In the US, 1 cup equals 240 ml, while UK metric cups use 250 ml. This slight difference means 635 ml converts to 2.68 US cups or 2.54 UK cups. Always check your recipe’s origin to avoid confusion—especially for air fryer dishes like honey-glazed salmon or sticky tofu.</p>  

<h2>How to Measure Honey Without Sticky Mess</h2>  
<p>Lightly coating your measuring cup with oil or non-stick spray helps honey slide out easily. Alternatively, warm the honey slightly to make it less viscous. For air fryer recipes like honey-mustard chicken or roasted carrots, precise measurements ensure balanced flavours.</p>  

<p>Another trick is to use weight instead of volume. Honey weighs about 340 grams per US cup (240 ml), so 635 ml equals roughly 907 grams. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipes section</a> includes weight-based measurements for fuss-free cooking.</p>  

<h3>Converting Honey for Baking vs. Cooking</h3>  
<p>Baking demands stricter accuracy, as honey affects moisture and sweetness. For air fryer desserts like honey cakes or flapjacks, stick to the exact conversion (2.68 US cups). Savoury dishes, like honey-glazed pork or veggies, allow slight adjustments.</p>  

<h2>Common Recipes Using 635 ml of Honey</h2>  
<p>This quantity is perfect for batch cooking or meal prep. Try it in air fryer honey garlic shrimp, BBQ glazes, or granola clusters. Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>honey chicken recipes</a> for inspiration.</p>  

<p>For desserts, 635 ml of honey makes about two large honey cakes or three dozen cookies. Remember to adjust air fryer temperatures slightly, as honey caramelises faster than sugar. Need cleaning tips? Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner guide</a> helps tackle sticky residues.</p>  

<h3>Storing Leftover Honey</h3>  
<p>Keep honey in an airtight container at room temperature. Crystallisation is natural—just warm the jar gently to restore smoothness. Use leftovers in teas, dressings, or <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/breakfast>air fryer breakfast recipes</a> like granola or yogurt parfaits.</p>

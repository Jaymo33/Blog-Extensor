<p>1 cup of almond butter equals approximately 8.5 ounces (240 grams) in UK measurements. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes, where precise measurements can make or break your dish. Whether you're whipping up almond butter cookies or a savoury glaze, knowing the exact weight ensures consistency.

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on even heat distribution, so ingredient proportions must be spot-on. Too much almond butter can make recipes overly dense, while too little might leave them dry. Using ounces instead of cups eliminates guesswork, especially with sticky ingredients like almond butter. If you're new to air frying, browse our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a> for foolproof ideas.</p>  

<p>Almond butter is a versatile ingredient, perfect for everything from breakfast oats to protein bars. Measuring by weight ensures your dishes turn out as intended, whether you're baking or coating chicken.

<h3>How to measure almond butter correctly</h3>  
<p>For the most accurate results, use a kitchen scale to weigh almond butter in ounces. If you don’t have one, lightly pack the almond butter into a measuring cup without compressing it too much. Sticky ingredients can be tricky, so a spatula helps scrape every bit out. Cleanup is easier too—just wipe your air fryer basket with our recommended <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner</a>.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for almond butter in air fryer recipes</h2>  
<p>Almond butter adds richness to both sweet and savoury dishes. Try it in energy balls, satay sauces, or drizzled over roasted vegetables. Its high fat content helps create a crispy texture in the air fryer. For inspiration, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/breakfast>breakfast recipes</a> featuring almond butter.</p>  

<p>When substituting almond butter for other nut butters, remember that 1 cup equals 8.5 ounces. This ensures your air fryer recipes maintain the right moisture balance. Almond butter’s natural oils can also reduce the need for added fats, making dishes healthier. Experiment with our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cookies>cookie recipes</a> for a tasty twist.</p>  

<h3>Converting almond butter measurements for UK cooks</h3>  
<p>UK bakers often use grams, but ounces are equally handy for air fryer recipes. Since 1 cup of almond butter is 8.5 ounces, you can easily scale recipes up or down. For larger batches, multiply accordingly—2 cups would be 17 ounces. Always level off measurements for consistency.</p>

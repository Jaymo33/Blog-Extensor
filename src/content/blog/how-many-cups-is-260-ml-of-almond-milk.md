<p>260 ml of almond milk equals approximately 1.1 cups. This conversion is essential for recipes, especially when using an air fryer, where precise measurements can make or break a dish. Whether you're whipping up a cake or preparing a creamy sauce, knowing how to convert millilitres to cups ensures consistency. For more handy conversions, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of almond milk can affect texture, moisture, and even cooking time in your air fryer. Too much liquid might make dishes soggy, while too little can dry them out. For example, when making air-fryer pancakes, 260 ml of almond milk (or 1.1 cups) ensures a perfect batter consistency. Explore more <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> to test your measuring skills.</p>  

<p>Almond milk is a popular dairy-free alternative, but its slightly thinner consistency means measurements matter even more. If a recipe calls for 260 ml of almond milk, using a proper measuring cup avoids guesswork. This precision is especially crucial for baked goods like muffins or cakes, where balance is key.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure 260 ml of Almond Milk Without a Measuring Cup</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a measuring jug, you can use a standard metric tablespoon. One tablespoon holds about 15 ml, so 260 ml would be roughly 17 tablespoons. However, for baking, we recommend using a proper measuring cup for accuracy. A kitchen scale can also help—260 ml of almond milk weighs about 260 grams.</p>  

<h2>US vs. UK Cup Measurements for Almond Milk</h2>  
<p>In the UK, 1 cup equals 250 ml, meaning 260 ml of almond milk is just over 1 cup (1.04 cups). In the US, 1 cup is 240 ml, making 260 ml closer to 1.08 cups. This small difference might not matter for some recipes, but for precision baking, it’s worth noting. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert recipes</a> to see how measurements impact results.</p>  

<p>When adapting recipes from US to UK measurements (or vice versa), always double-check the cup size. For air fryer cooking, slight variations can affect how evenly food cooks. If a recipe specifies 260 ml of almond milk, stick to millilitres for the best outcome.</p>  

<h3>Common Recipes Using 260 ml of Almond Milk</h3>  
<p>Many air fryer recipes, like vegan mac and cheese or dairy-free custard, use around 260 ml of almond milk. This amount is ideal for creating creamy textures without overpowering flavours. For inspiration, browse our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/breakfast>breakfast recipes</a>, where almond milk often stars.</p>  

<h2>Tips for Storing and Using Almond Milk in Air Fryer Dishes</h2>  
<p>Always shake almond milk before measuring, as it can separate. After opening, store it in the fridge and use within 7 days for best quality. If your recipe calls for 260 ml of almond milk but you only have a larger carton, consider freezing leftovers in ice cube trays for future use.</p>  

<p>For easy cleanup after cooking with almond milk, try our recommended <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner</a>. Sticky residues from dairy-free milks can build up, so regular maintenance keeps your appliance in top shape.</p>  

<h3>Converting Other Almond Milk Amounts to Cups</h3>  
<p>Need to convert a different amount? Here’s a quick reference: 125 ml = 0.5 cups, 500 ml = 2 cups, and 1 litre = 4 cups. Bookmark this guide for hassle-free cooking with your air fryer.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of almond milk can affect texture, moisture, and even cooking time in your air fryer. Too much liquid might make dishes soggy, while too little can dry them out. For example, when making air-fryer pancakes, 260 ml of almond milk (or 1.1 cups) ensures a perfect batter consistency.

<p>Almond milk is a popular dairy-free alternative, but its slightly thinner consistency means measurements matter even more. If a recipe calls for 260 ml of almond milk, using a proper measuring cup avoids guesswork. This precision is especially crucial for baked goods like muffins or cakes, where balance is key.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure 260 ml of Almond Milk Without a Measuring Cup</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a measuring jug, you can use a standard metric tablespoon. One tablespoon holds about 15 ml, so 260 ml would be roughly 17 tablespoons. However, for baking, we recommend using a proper measuring cup for accuracy. A kitchen scale can also help—260 ml of almond milk weighs about 260 grams.</p>  

<h2>US vs. UK Cup Measurements for Almond Milk</h2>  
<p>In the UK, 1 cup equals 250 ml, meaning 260 ml of almond milk is just over 1 cup (1.04 cups). In the US, 1 cup is 240 ml, making 260 ml closer to 1.08 cups. This small difference might not matter for some recipes, but for precision baking, it’s worth noting.

<p>When adapting recipes from US to UK measurements (or vice versa), always double-check the cup size. For air fryer cooking, slight variations can affect how evenly food cooks. If a recipe specifies 260 ml of almond milk, stick to millilitres for the best outcome.</p>

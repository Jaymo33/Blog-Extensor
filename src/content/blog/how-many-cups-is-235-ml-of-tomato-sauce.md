<p>235 ml of tomato sauce is roughly equivalent to 1 cup (or 0.99 cups to be precise). This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes, where precise measurements can affect cooking times and textures. Whether you're making a rich pasta sauce or a homemade pizza, knowing how to convert millilitres to cups ensures consistent results every time.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Using the correct amount of tomato sauce can make or break your air fryer dish. Too much sauce can lead to soggy results, while too little might leave your meal dry. For example, when making <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer lasagna</a>, 235 ml (or 1 cup) of tomato sauce is often the perfect amount for layering. Similarly, recipes like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>air fryer chicken parmigiana</a> rely on balanced sauce quantities for optimal crispiness.</p>  

<p>If you're working with a recipe that calls for 235 ml of tomato sauce but prefer using cups, this conversion simplifies the process. Most UK and US measuring cups are close enough in size for this approximation to work seamlessly.

<h3>How to Measure 235 ml of Tomato Sauce Without a Measuring Cup</h3>  
<p>No measuring cup? No problem. A standard UK mug holds about 250 ml, so filling it just below the rim will give you roughly 235 ml. Alternatively, use a tablespoon—16 tablespoons equal 240 ml, so 15 tablespoons will get you close to 235 ml. This method is handy when prepping smaller batches of <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>air fryer roasted vegetables</a> with a tomato glaze.</p>  

<h2>Common Recipes Using 235 ml of Tomato Sauce</h2>  
<p>Many air fryer recipes call for around 235 ml (1 cup) of tomato sauce. Dishes like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/beef>air fryer meatballs</a> often use this quantity for a rich, saucy coating. Similarly, homemade air fryer pizzas typically require 235 ml of sauce to cover the base without overwhelming the crust. For dishes like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/potatoes>air fryer stuffed potatoes</a>, this measurement ensures even flavour distribution.</p>  

<p>If you're scaling a recipe up or down, remember that 235 ml of tomato sauce equals 1 cup. This makes it easy to adjust quantities without compromising taste or texture. For more recipe ideas, explore our collection at <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>.</p>  

<h3>Tips for Storing Leftover Tomato Sauce</h3>  
<p>If you have leftover tomato sauce after measuring out 235 ml, store it in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 5 days. You can also freeze it for up to 3 months—just thaw and reheat when needed. Leftover sauce works great for quick <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a>, like dipping sauces or marinades.</p>

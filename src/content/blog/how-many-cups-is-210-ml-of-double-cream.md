<p>210 ml of double cream equals approximately 0.89 cups. This conversion is essential for recipes requiring precise measurements, especially when using an air fryer for baking or cooking creamy dishes. Whether you’re making a rich dessert or a savoury sauce, knowing how to convert millilitres to cups ensures consistency and perfect results every time.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>When working with double cream, even small measurement errors can affect the texture and consistency of your dish. Too much cream can make a sauce overly rich, while too little might leave it lacking in flavour. For air fryer recipes, precision is key to achieving the right balance, especially when baking cakes or preparing creamy toppings. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we emphasise the importance of accurate conversions to help you master your cooking.</p>  

<p>Double cream is a staple in many British recipes, from scones to custards. If you’re using an air fryer for baking, knowing that 210 ml of double cream is roughly 0.89 cups ensures your measurements are spot-on. This is particularly useful when scaling recipes up or down, as air fryers often require adjustments due to their compact size.</p>  

<h2>How to Measure 210 ml of Double Cream</h2>  
<p>If you don’t have a measuring jug, you can still measure 210 ml of double cream accurately. A standard metric cup holds 250 ml, so 210 ml is just under a full cup. Alternatively, use tablespoons—14 tablespoons equal roughly 210 ml. For those who prefer weight measurements, 210 ml of double cream weighs approximately 210 grams, as its density is close to 1 g/ml.</p>

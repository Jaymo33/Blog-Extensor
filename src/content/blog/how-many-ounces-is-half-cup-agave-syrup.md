<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>
<p>Air fryers rely on rapid hot air circulation, so ingredient ratios are crucial. Too much agave syrup can cause excessive caramelisation or burning, while too little might leave your dish lacking flavour.

This precision becomes especially important when preparing sticky glazes for wings or sweet coatings for roasted vegetables.</p>
<p>At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we recommend using liquid measuring cups for agave syrup rather than dry measures.

For best results, lightly grease your measuring cup with oil before pouring in the syrup - it’ll slide right out!</p>

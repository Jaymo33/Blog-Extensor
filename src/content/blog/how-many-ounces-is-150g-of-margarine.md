Whether you’re whipping up a cake or frying crispy treats, getting the quantities right ensures perfect results. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we help you master these conversions for flawless cooking every time.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air frying</h2>  
<p>Using the correct amount of margarine ensures your air fryer recipes turn out just right. Too little, and your food might dry out; too much, and it could become greasy. For example, if you’re making air-fried cookies or cakes, 150g of margarine (5.29 ounces) provides the ideal balance of moisture and texture. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more handy tips.</p>  

<p>Margarine is a common ingredient in many air fryer recipes, from savoury dishes to desserts. Knowing how to convert grams to ounces helps you follow recipes accurately, especially if they’re written in different measurement systems. Whether you’re cooking frozen foods or baking a cake, precision is key.</p>  

<h3>How to measure 150g of margarine without scales</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a kitchen scale, you can still measure 150g of margarine using tablespoons. One tablespoon of margarine weighs roughly 14g, so 150g is about 10.5 tablespoons. This method isn’t as precise as using scales, but it works in a pinch. For more air fryer tips, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipes section</a>.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for 150g of margarine in air fryer recipes</h2>  
<p>Margarine is versatile in air fryer cooking. You might use 150g (5.29 ounces) for baking cakes, making pastry, or even greasing the air fryer basket to prevent sticking. It’s a staple in many <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>cake recipes</a>, providing moisture and richness to your bakes.</p>  

<p>Another popular use is in savoury dishes, like air-fried potatoes or vegetables. A small amount of margarine can enhance flavour and crispiness. Just remember, moderation is key—too much can lead to excess smoke in your air fryer.

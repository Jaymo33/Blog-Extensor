<h2>Why Accurate Soy Sauce Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Using the correct amount of soy sauce can make or break a dish. Too little, and your meal lacks depth; too much, and it becomes overpowering. In air fryer cooking, where flavours concentrate, precision is even more critical. A dish like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>air fryer chicken</a> benefits from a balanced soy sauce marinade. Measuring 385 ml of soy sauce correctly ensures consistency across recipes.</p>  

<p>Many air fryer recipes, especially those for Asian-inspired dishes, call for soy sauce in millilitres. If your measuring tools use cups, knowing the conversion avoids guesswork. Whether you're cooking <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>air fryer vegetables</a> or marinating tofu, 385 ml of soy sauce translates to roughly 1.63 cups. This accuracy helps replicate restaurant-quality results at home.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure 385 ml of Soy Sauce Without a Scale</h3>  
<p>If you don't have a measuring jug with millilitre markings, use standard cup measurements. Since 1 cup equals 240 ml, 385 ml is just over 1.5 cups. For greater precision, fill a cup to the 1.5 mark, then add another 2 tablespoons. This method works well for sticky liquids like soy sauce, ensuring your <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> stay on point.</p>  

<h2>Converting 385 ml of Soy Sauce for Different Recipes</h2>  
<p>Whether you're making a glaze for salmon or a stir-fry sauce, 385 ml of soy sauce provides enough for multiple servings. For example, a teriyaki marinade using 385 ml (1.63 cups) of soy sauce can coat 4-6 chicken thighs in the air fryer. If scaling down, remember that 100 ml equals roughly 0.42 cups. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner guide</a> also helps maintain your appliance after saucy recipes.</p>  

<p>Baking with soy sauce, like in soy-infused cookies or cakes, requires exact measurements. 385 ml of soy sauce in cups ensures your batter isn't too runny or dense. For savoury bakes, this quantity adds umami without overwhelming other flavours. Always level off your cup measurements for consistency, especially when adapting millilitre-based recipes to your air fryer.</p>  

<h3>Common Mistakes When Measuring Soy Sauce</h3>  
<p>Avoid pouring soy sauce directly from the bottle into your cup, as it's easy to over-pour. Instead, use a spoon to transfer it slowly. Also, check if your recipe lists soy sauce in millilitres or fluid ounces, as 385 ml differs from 385 fl oz. For sticky sauces, lightly grease your measuring cup first so it pours out completely, leaving no residue behind.</p>

<p>1 cup of apple cider vinegar equals 8 fluid ounces (oz) in both US and UK measurements. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes, ensuring accurate ingredient proportions for the best results. Whether you’re marinating chicken or whipping up a tangy glaze, knowing this measurement helps avoid kitchen mishaps. For more air fryer conversions, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Precision is key when using an air fryer, as ingredients cook faster and more intensely than in traditional ovens. Using the correct amount of apple cider vinegar—8 oz per cup—ensures balanced flavours and textures. Too much vinegar can overpower a dish, while too little might leave it bland. This is especially important for marinades and sauces, where ratios make or break the recipe. For inspiration, browse our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> collection.</p>  

<p>Many air fryer recipes call for apple cider vinegar due to its tangy kick and tenderising properties. Whether you’re making crispy tofu or glazed salmon, measuring 1 cup as 8 oz guarantees consistency. A kitchen scale can help, but a liquid measuring cup works just as well. Remember, accuracy ensures your air fryer dishes turn out perfectly every time.</p>  

<h3>Converting apple cider vinegar for UK recipes</h3>  
<p>In the UK, 1 cup of apple cider vinegar is also 8 fluid ounces, just like in the US. However, UK cups are slightly larger (284 ml vs. 240 ml in the US), but the ounce measurement remains consistent for liquids. This simplifies conversions for British air fryer users. If you’re adapting a US recipe, rest assured that 1 cup of apple cider vinegar equals 8 oz in both systems.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for apple cider vinegar in air fryers</h2>  
<p>Apple cider vinegar shines in air fryer cooking, from marinades to cleaning. A classic use is marinating chicken—combine 1 cup (8 oz) of vinegar with herbs for tender, flavourful meat. It’s also great for deglazing pans or adding acidity to sauces. For a deeper dive, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipes</a> featuring this versatile ingredient.</p>  

<p>Beyond cooking, apple cider vinegar helps maintain your air fryer. A mix of 1 cup (8 oz) vinegar and water can loosen stubborn grease. After cooling, wipe the basket with this solution for a sparkling clean appliance. For more tips, visit our guide on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaning</a>.</p>  

<h3>Measuring without a cup or scale</h3>  
<p>No measuring tools? A standard UK mug holds roughly 10 oz, so fill it 80% full for 1 cup (8 oz) of apple cider vinegar. Alternatively, use two 4-oz shot glasses. While not as precise, these hacks work in a pinch. For consistent results, though, investing in a measuring cup is wise.</p>  

<h2>Apple cider vinegar substitutes in air fryer recipes</h2>  
<p>If you’re out of apple cider vinegar, white wine vinegar or lemon juice can replace it in equal amounts (1 cup/8 oz). However, adjust sweetness as needed, as apple cider vinegar has a unique fruity note. For vegan dishes, try our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/tofu>tofu recipes</a> that use these swaps effectively.</p>  

<p>Remember, substitutes may alter flavour profiles slightly. For example, lemon juice adds brightness, while white wine vinegar offers a sharper tang. Test small batches first to ensure the substitute works in your air fryer dish. The goal is to maintain the recipe’s balance while adapting to what’s on hand.</p>

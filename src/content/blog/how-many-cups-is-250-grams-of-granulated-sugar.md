<p>250 grams of granulated sugar equals approximately 1.25 cups in the UK and 1.2 cups in the US. Getting this measurement right is crucial for baking, especially when using an air fryer where precise ratios affect texture and browning. Whether you're making cookies or a sponge cake, knowing how to convert grams to cups ensures consistent results every time.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Sugar Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Granulated sugar plays a vital role in baking, affecting texture, moisture, and caramelisation. Too much or too little can throw off your recipe, especially in an air fryer where heat distribution is intense. For example, if you're making air fryer cookies from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>our recipe collection</a>, precise sugar ensures the perfect chewiness. Even a small discrepancy can lead to overly crisp or undercooked results.</p>  
<p>Different countries use varying cup sizes, which adds another layer of complexity. The UK uses a 250ml metric cup, while the US relies on a 240ml customary cup. This slight difference means 250 grams of granulated sugar converts to 1.25 UK cups or 1.2 US cups. Always check your recipe's origin to avoid mistakes, especially when adapting traditional oven recipes for air frying.</p>  

<h2>How to Measure 250 Grams of Granulated Sugar</h2>  
<p>For the most accurate results, use a digital kitchen scale. However, if you only have measuring cups, fluff the sugar first to prevent packing it down. Spoon it gently into the cup and level it off with a knife. Avoid tapping or pressing the sugar, as this compacts it and leads to over-measuring. If your recipe calls for 250g granulated sugar in cups, this method ensures consistency.</p>  

<h3>UK vs. US Cup Conversions</h3>  
<p>In the UK, 250 grams of granulated sugar fills about 1.25 metric cups (250ml each). In the US, it's roughly 1.2 customary cups (240ml each). For air fryer baking, where precision matters, sticking to grams is ideal. Refer to <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>our conversion chart</a> for other common ingredients.</p>  

<h2>Common Recipes Using 250 Grams of Sugar</h2>  
<p>Many classic desserts, like Victoria sponge or shortbread, use around 250 grams of granulated sugar. When adapting these for the air fryer, measure carefully to avoid uneven cooking. For example, <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>air fryer cakes</a> rely on sugar for structure and browning. Too little sugar can result in a dense texture, while too much may cause excessive caramelisation.</p>  
<p>If you're preparing a batch of cookies, 250 grams of sugar typically yields 12â€“15 servings. Check out <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cookies>our cookie recipes</a> for inspiration. Remember, air fryers cook faster than conventional ovens, so precise measurements prevent burnt edges or underdone centres.</p>  

<h3>Tips for Air Fryer Baking</h3>  
<p>When converting traditional recipes, reduce sugar slightly if the air fryer tends to over-caramelise. Preheat the air fryer for even heat distribution, and use parchment liners (<a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>like these</a>) to prevent sticking. For best results, weigh ingredients instead of relying solely on cup measurements.</p>

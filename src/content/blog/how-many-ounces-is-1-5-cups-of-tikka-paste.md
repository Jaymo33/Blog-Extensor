<p>1.5 cups of tikka paste equals approximately 12 ounces, making it easy to measure for your air fryer recipes. Whether you’re marinating chicken or prepping a flavourful curry, knowing this conversion ensures accuracy. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we help simplify kitchen measurements so you can cook with confidence. Let’s dive deeper into how this conversion works and why it matters for air fryer cooking.</p>  

<h2>Understanding the Conversion</h2>  
<p>Converting cups to ounces can be tricky, especially with thicker ingredients like tikka paste. A standard cup holds 8 fluid ounces, but denser pastes may vary. For tikka paste, 1.5 cups typically translates to 12 ounces by weight. This measurement is crucial for air fryer recipes, where precise ingredient ratios affect cooking times and flavours. If you’re unsure, refer to our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for quick reference.</p>  

<p>Using the correct amount of tikka paste ensures your marinades and sauces have the right consistency. Too much paste can overpower the dish, while too little may leave it bland. For best results, measure your ingredients carefully before adding them to the air fryer. Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a> for inspiration on using tikka paste in delicious meals.</p>  

<h3>Why Accuracy Matters in Air Fryer Cooking</h3>  
<p>Air fryers rely on even heat distribution, so ingredient measurements must be precise. An extra ounce of tikka paste could alter cooking times or cause uneven browning. By converting 1.5 cups to 12 ounces accurately, you’ll achieve consistent results every time. This is especially important for marinated dishes like chicken tikka, where the paste’s thickness affects adhesion and flavour penetration.</p>  

<h2>Tips for Measuring Tikka Paste</h2>  
<p>For the most accurate measurement, use a kitchen scale to weigh your tikka paste. If you don’t have one, spoon the paste into a measuring cup and level it off. Avoid packing the paste down, as this can lead to over-measuring. Remember, 1.5 cups of tikka paste equals 12 ounces, so adjust your recipe accordingly. For more measurement tips, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipe category</a>.</p>  

<p>Storing leftover tikka paste is easy—transfer it to an airtight container and refrigerate. If you’re unsure how much to use next time, our conversion guide ensures you won’t waste ingredients. Proper storage also keeps your paste fresh for future air fryer meals. Don’t forget to clean your air fryer after cooking with tikka paste—visit our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning guide</a> for tips.</p>  

<h3>Common Mistakes to Avoid</h3>  
<p>One common mistake is confusing fluid ounces with weight ounces. Tikka paste is measured by weight, so 1.5 cups equals 12 ounces, not fluid ounces. Another error is eyeballing the measurement, which can throw off your recipe. Always use proper tools for the best results. If you’re new to air fryer cooking, start with smaller batches to perfect your technique.</p>

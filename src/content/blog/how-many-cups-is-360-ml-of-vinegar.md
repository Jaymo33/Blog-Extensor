<p>360 ml of vinegar is approximately 1.52 cups in the UK or 1.5 cups in the US. Getting this conversion right ensures your recipes turn out perfectly, especially when using an air fryer. Whether you're marinating chicken, pickling vegetables, or baking, precise measurements matter. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we know how crucial accuracy is for air fryer cooking. Let’s break down the conversion and explore how to use vinegar effectively.</p>

<h2>Understanding the Conversion: 360 ml of Vinegar to Cups</h2>  
<p>Converting 360 ml of vinegar to cups depends on whether you're using UK or US measurements. In the UK, 1 cup equals 250 ml, so 360 ml is roughly 1.52 cups. In the US, where 1 cup is 240 ml, 360 ml translates to 1.5 cups. This small difference can impact recipes, especially in baking. For air fryer cooking, consistency is key—whether you're making crispy chips or tangy glazes. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more handy measurements.</p>  

<p>Vinegar is a versatile ingredient, often used in marinades, dressings, and even cleaning solutions. If you're using it in an air fryer, accuracy ensures balanced flavours and textures. Too much vinegar can overpower a dish, while too little might leave it bland. Whether you're following a recipe from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>our collection</a> or experimenting, knowing how many cups 360 ml of vinegar equals is a game-changer.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on precise cooking times and ingredient ratios for perfect results. Unlike traditional ovens, air fryers circulate hot air rapidly, which means liquids like vinegar evaporate faster. If your measurement is off, your dish could end up too dry or overly acidic. For example, a marinade with 360 ml of vinegar needs the right balance of oil and spices to work well in an air fryer. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipes</a> often use vinegar-based marinades for tender, flavourful results.</p>  

<p>Measuring vinegar correctly also affects cleaning. A mix of 360 ml of vinegar and water can be a natural cleaner for your air fryer basket. Too much vinegar might leave a strong odour, while too little won’t cut through grease. For more tips, see our guide on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaning solutions</a>. Whether cooking or maintaining your appliance, accuracy with 360 ml of vinegar makes all the difference.</p>  

<h3>Common Uses for 360 ml of Vinegar in Air Fryer Recipes</h3>  
<p>Vinegar plays a starring role in many air fryer dishes. From tangy BBQ sauces to pickled vegetables, 360 ml of vinegar can transform a meal. Try it in a marinade for crispy tofu or as a glaze for salmon—both featured in our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/tofu>tofu</a> and <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/salmon>salmon</a> recipe categories. The key is measuring correctly to avoid overpowering other flavours. With 360 ml of vinegar equalling roughly 1.5 US cups, you can adjust recipes confidently.</p>  

<h3>Tips for Measuring 360 ml of Vinegar Without a Scale</h3>  
<p>No measuring jug? Use a standard cup to measure 360 ml of vinegar. In the US, 1.5 cups will give you the right amount. In the UK, fill a cup to the 250 ml mark, then add another half-cup minus 10 ml. For small adjustments, tablespoons work—360 ml equals about 24 tablespoons. Remember, air fryer recipes often need precision, so when in doubt, refer back to our conversion guides at <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>.</p>

<p>360 ml of vinegar is approximately 1.52 cups in the UK or 1.5 cups in the US. Getting this conversion right ensures your recipes turn out perfectly, especially when using an air fryer. Whether you're marinating chicken, pickling vegetables, or baking, precise measurements matter. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we know how crucial accuracy is for air fryer cooking. Let’s break down the conversion and explore how to use vinegar effectively.</p>

<h2>Understanding the Conversion: 360 ml of Vinegar to Cups</h2>  
<p>Converting 360 ml of vinegar to cups depends on whether you're using UK or US measurements. In the UK, 1 cup equals 250 ml, so 360 ml is roughly 1.52 cups. In the US, where 1 cup is 240 ml, 360 ml translates to 1.5 cups. This small difference can impact recipes, especially in baking. For air fryer cooking, consistency is key—whether you're making crispy chips or tangy glazes.

<p>Vinegar is a versatile ingredient, often used in marinades, dressings, and even cleaning solutions. If you're using it in an air fryer, accuracy ensures balanced flavours and textures. Too much vinegar can overpower a dish, while too little might leave it bland. Whether you're following a recipe from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>our collection</a> or experimenting, knowing how many cups 360 ml of vinegar equals is a game-changer.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on precise cooking times and ingredient ratios for perfect results. Unlike traditional ovens, air fryers circulate hot air rapidly, which means liquids like vinegar evaporate faster. If your measurement is off, your dish could end up too dry or overly acidic. For example, a marinade with 360 ml of vinegar needs the right balance of oil and spices to work well in an air fryer. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipes</a> often use vinegar-based marinades for tender, flavourful results.</p>  

<p>Measuring vinegar correctly also affects cleaning. A mix of 360 ml of vinegar and water can be a natural cleaner for your air fryer basket. Too much vinegar might leave a strong odour, while too little won’t cut through grease.

Whether cooking or maintaining your appliance, accuracy with 360 ml of vinegar makes all the difference.</p>

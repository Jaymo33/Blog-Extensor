<h2>Understanding Half And Half Measurements</h2>  
<p>Half and half is a dairy product made by combining equal parts whole milk and cream. It’s commonly used in recipes to add richness without being as heavy as pure cream. When converting 160 ml of half and half to cups, it’s important to note that US and UK cup measurements differ slightly. In the US, 1 cup equals 240 ml, while in the UK, 1 cup is 284 ml. This means 160 ml of half and half is roughly 0.68 US cups or 0.56 UK cups.</p>  
<p>Precision matters, especially when using an air fryer, as too much or too little liquid can affect cooking times and results. For example, adding too much half and half to a batter might make it too runny, while too little could dry out your dish. If you’re working with air fryer recipes, always measure liquids carefully.

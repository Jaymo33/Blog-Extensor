<p>285 ml of almond milk is approximately 1.2 cups in the UK or 1.2 US cups. This conversion is essential for accurate baking and cooking, especially when using an air fryer where precise measurements matter. Whether you're whipping up a cake or preparing a creamy sauce, knowing how to convert 285 ml of almond milk to cups ensures consistency in your recipes.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>
<p>Using the right amount of almond milk can make or break your dish. Too much liquid can lead to soggy results, while too little might dry out your food. Air fryers, like those featured on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, rely on even heat distribution, so precise measurements are key. Whether you're making pancakes or a vegan quiche, 285 ml of almond milk converted correctly ensures perfect texture and flavour.</p>
<p>For more air fryer tips, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a>, which includes common ingredient measurements. This resource is especially handy if you're adapting traditional oven recipes for your air fryer. Remember, 285 ml of almond milk equals roughly 1.2 cups, but always double-check for critical recipes.</p>

<h2>UK vs. US Cup Measurements for Almond Milk</h2>
<p>Did you know that UK and US cups differ slightly? A UK cup holds 284 ml, while a US cup is 240 ml. This means 285 ml of almond milk is about 1.2 UK cups or 1.2 US cups. The difference might seem small, but it can affect recipes, especially in baking. Always specify which cup measurement you're using to avoid confusion.</p>
<p>If you're following a recipe from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>our collection</a>, note whether it uses UK or US measurements. Many British recipes, like those for scones or custards, rely on UK cups. For best results, use a kitchen scale or measuring jug to confirm 285 ml of almond milk before adding it to your air fryer dishes.</p>

<h3>How to Measure 285 ml of Almond Milk Without a Jug</h3>
<p>No measuring jug? No problem! You can use tablespoons to measure 285 ml of almond milk. Since 1 tablespoon equals 15 ml, you'd need 19 tablespoons to reach 285 ml. This method works in a pinch, but for accuracy, we recommend investing in a good measuring jug. This is especially important for air fryer recipes where precision affects cooking time and texture.</p>

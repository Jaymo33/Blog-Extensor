<p>2.5 cups of pumpkin seeds equals approximately 10 ounces. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes, ensuring you get the perfect roast or crisp every time. Whether you're making a snack or adding pumpkin seeds to a dish, accurate measurements matter.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter for Pumpkin Seeds</h2>  
<p>When using an air fryer, precise measurements ensure even cooking and perfect texture. Too many pumpkin seeds can overcrowd the basket, leading to uneven roasting. Too few might burn quickly. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we recommend weighing ingredients like pumpkin seeds for consistency.</p>  

<p>Pumpkin seeds are a versatile ingredient, great for snacks, salads, or even <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a>. Knowing the weight in ounces helps adjust cooking times and temperatures. For example, 10 ounces of pumpkin seeds may need 12-15 minutes at 180°C in most air fryers.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure Pumpkin Seeds Correctly</h3>  
<p>Use a kitchen scale for the most accurate conversion from cups to ounces. If you don’t have one, lightly packed pumpkin seeds in a measuring cup will give you a close estimate. Avoid pressing them down, as this can skew the measurement.</p>  

<h2>Converting 2.5 Cups of Pumpkin Seeds to Ounces</h2>  
<p>The general rule is that 1 cup of pumpkin seeds weighs about 4 ounces. Therefore, 2.5 cups equal roughly 10 ounces. This conversion is useful for UK cooks following recipes that list ingredients by weight rather than volume.</p>  

<p>For more precise measurements, check our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>. It includes common ingredients and their weight equivalents, making it easier to adapt recipes for your air fryer.</p>  

<h3>Best Ways to Cook Pumpkin Seeds in an Air Fryer</h3>  
<p>Once you’ve measured your 2.5 cups (10 ounces) of pumpkin seeds, toss them with a bit of oil and salt. Spread them evenly in the air fryer basket and cook at 180°C for 12-15 minutes, shaking halfway. They’ll come out perfectly crispy every time.</p>  

<h2>Common Mistakes When Measuring Pumpkin Seeds</h2>  
<p>One mistake is using a heaped cup, which can add extra ounces and affect cooking times. Another is not accounting for the air fryer’s capacity—overfilling leads to uneven results. Always measure carefully for the best outcome.</p>  

<p>If you’re unsure, refer to our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/snacks>snack recipes</a> for guidance. Many include pumpkin seeds as a key ingredient, with precise measurements for foolproof cooking.</p>  

<h3>Storing Leftover Pumpkin Seeds</h3>  
<p>If you have extra pumpkin seeds after measuring 2.5 cups (10 ounces), store them in an airtight container. They’ll stay fresh for weeks, ready for your next air fryer session. For more storage tips, visit <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>.</p>

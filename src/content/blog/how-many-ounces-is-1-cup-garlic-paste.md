<p>1 cup of garlic paste equals approximately 8.5 ounces. This measurement is essential for precise cooking, especially when using an air fryer where ingredient ratios can affect texture and flavour. Whether you're whipping up a marinade or preparing a sauce, knowing the exact weight ensures consistency in your dishes.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on even heat distribution, so ingredient quantities must be precise. Too much garlic paste can overpower a dish or cause uneven cooking. For example, a recipe calling for 1 cup of garlic paste to ounces ensures your marinade coats evenly without excess moisture. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more handy measurement tips.</p>  

<p>Garlic paste is denser than minced garlic, so volume-to-weight conversions differ. While 1 cup of minced garlic weighs around 5 ounces, the paste version is thicker, hence the 8.5-ounce measurement. This distinction is crucial for air fryer recipes where moisture content affects crispiness.</p>  

<h2>How to Measure Garlic Paste Correctly</h2>  
<p>Use a liquid measuring cup for accuracy when converting 1 cup of garlic paste to oz. Scoop the paste and level it off with a straight edge. Avoid packing it down, as this can lead to over-measuring. For smaller quantities, a kitchen scale is ideal—simply tare your bowl and add until you hit 8.5 ounces.</p>  

<p>If you're scaling a recipe, remember that 1 cup garlic paste how many ounces remains consistent. Doubling the recipe? You’ll need 17 ounces. Halving it? 4.25 ounces will do. This precision is especially helpful for meal prep or batch cooking in your air fryer.</p>  

<h3>Common Uses for Garlic Paste in Air Fryer Recipes</h3>  
<p>Garlic paste works wonders in marinades for chicken, shrimp, or tofu—key ingredients in many <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a>. Its concentrated flavour means a little goes a long way. Mix it with oil, herbs, and spices for a quick glaze or rub.</p>  

<h3>Substitutes for Garlic Paste</h3>  
<p>If you're out of garlic paste, 1 tablespoon of minced garlic plus 1/2 teaspoon of water approximates 1 ounce of paste. However, for recipes specifying 1 cup garlic paste to ounces, substitutes may alter texture. Fresh garlic works too, but adjust quantities since its flavour is less concentrated.</p>  

<h2>Cleaning Tips After Handling Garlic Paste</h2>  
<p>Garlic’s strong aroma can linger on hands and utensils. After measuring 1 cup of garlic paste in ounces, rinse tools immediately with warm soapy water. For stubborn smells, try our recommended <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner</a> to keep your appliance fresh.</p>  

<p>Store leftover garlic paste in an airtight container in the fridge for up to two weeks. For longer storage, freeze it in ice cube trays—each cube holds about 1 ounce, perfect for future air fryer dishes.

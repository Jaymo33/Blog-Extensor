<p>1 cup of garlic paste equals approximately 8.5 ounces. This measurement is essential for precise cooking, especially when using an air fryer where ingredient ratios can affect texture and flavour. Whether you're whipping up a marinade or preparing a sauce, knowing the exact weight ensures consistency in your dishes.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>

<p>Garlic paste is denser than minced garlic, so volume-to-weight conversions differ. While 1 cup of minced garlic weighs around 5 ounces, the paste version is thicker, hence the 8.5-ounce measurement. This distinction is crucial for air fryer recipes where moisture content affects crispiness.</p>  

<h2>How to Measure Garlic Paste Correctly</h2>  
<p>Use a liquid measuring cup for accuracy when converting 1 cup of garlic paste to oz. Scoop the paste and level it off with a straight edge. Avoid packing it down, as this can lead to over-measuring. For smaller quantities, a kitchen scale is ideal—simply tare your bowl and add until you hit 8.5 ounces.</p>  

<p>If you're scaling a recipe, remember that 1 cup garlic paste how many ounces remains consistent. Doubling the recipe? You’ll need 17 ounces. Halving it? 4.25 ounces will do. This precision is especially helpful for meal prep or batch cooking in your air fryer.</p>  

<h3>Common Uses for Garlic Paste in Air Fryer Recipes</h3>

However, for recipes specifying 1 cup garlic paste to ounces, substitutes may alter texture. Fresh garlic works too, but adjust quantities since its flavour is less concentrated.</p>

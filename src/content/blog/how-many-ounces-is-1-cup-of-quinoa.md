<p>1 cup of quinoa equals approximately 6.35 ounces (180 grams) when measured uncooked. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes, where precise measurements ensure even cooking and perfect texture. Whether you're preparing a protein-packed salad or a crispy quinoa patty in your air fryer, knowing the exact weight helps avoid under or over-seasoning. For more air fryer conversions, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Quinoa Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Using the correct amount of quinoa ensures your air fryer dishes cook evenly and retain the right moisture balance. Too much quinoa can lead to clumping, while too little may dry out during cooking. For recipes like quinoa-stuffed peppers or crispy quinoa bites, 1 cup (6.35 oz) is often the ideal starting portion. If you're exploring new recipes, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipes section</a> offers plenty of inspiration.</p>  

<p>Quinoa expands to about three times its volume when cooked, so 1 cup uncooked yields roughly 3 cups cooked. This makes it a fantastic base for meal prep—simply cook a batch and use it throughout the week. For meal prep ideas, browse our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/meal-prep>meal prep category</a>.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure Quinoa for Air Fryer Recipes</h3>  
<p>For the most accurate results, use a kitchen scale to weigh 1 cup of quinoa at 6.35 oz. If you don’t have a scale, fluff the quinoa with a fork before lightly spooning it into a measuring cup. Avoid packing it down, as this can lead to an incorrect measurement. Properly measured quinoa ensures your air fryer dishes, like quinoa-crusted chicken or veggie burgers, turn out perfectly every time.</p>  

<h2>Common Quinoa Conversions for Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Beyond 1 cup to ounces, here are other handy conversions: ½ cup quinoa equals 3.17 oz, and 2 cups equal 12.7 oz. These measurements are especially useful when scaling recipes up or down for your air fryer. For example, a family-sized batch of quinoa falafel might require 2 cups (12.7 oz), while a single-serving quinoa bowl may only need ¼ cup (1.59 oz).</p>  

<p>If you're working with cooked quinoa, remember that 1 cup cooked weighs roughly 7 oz. This is handy for recipes like quinoa muffins or air-fried quinoa croquettes. For more tips on cooking with quinoa, visit <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>.</p>  

<h3>Tips for Cooking Quinoa in an Air Fryer</h3>  
<p>Rinse quinoa thoroughly before cooking to remove its natural coating, which can taste bitter. For air fryer recipes, combine 1 cup (6.35 oz) quinoa with 1.5 cups water or broth, then cook at 180°C for 12–15 minutes. Stir halfway through to ensure even cooking. This method works beautifully for dishes like quinoa-stuffed mushrooms or crispy quinoa cakes.</p>  

<h2>Storing and Reheating Quinoa in Your Air Fryer</h2>  
<p>Cooked quinoa can be stored in the fridge for up to 5 days or frozen for 3 months. To reheat, spread 1 cup (7 oz cooked) in the air fryer basket and heat at 160°C for 3–5 minutes. Add a splash of water to prevent drying out. For more storage hacks, check our guide on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>keeping your air fryer clean</a>.</p>

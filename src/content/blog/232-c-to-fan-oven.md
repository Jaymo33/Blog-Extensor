<p>232 C converts to approximately 210 C in a fan oven. This 20-degree reduction is standard for fan-assisted cooking, as the circulating air distributes heat more efficiently. Whether you're baking, roasting, or using an air fryer, understanding this conversion ensures perfectly cooked dishes every time.</p>

<h2>Why Fan Oven Temperatures Differ</h2>
<p>Fan ovens cook faster and more evenly than conventional ovens because they use a fan to circulate hot air. This means you'll typically need to reduce the temperature by 20 C when converting from conventional to fan settings. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we recommend this adjustment for everything from cakes to roasted vegetables.</p>
<p>The same principle applies to air fryers, which are essentially compact fan ovens. When following recipes designed for conventional ovens, reducing the temperature by about 20 C (as with 232 C to 210 C) helps prevent overcooking. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more detailed guidance.</p>

<h2>232 C in Different Cooking Appliances</h2>
<p>While 232 C converts to 210 C in a fan oven, the equivalent in an air fryer might vary slightly depending on your model. Most modern air fryers with convection settings will perform similarly to fan ovens at this temperature range. For perfect <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipes</a>, this temperature creates crispy skin without drying out the meat.</p>
<p>In a conventional oven without fan assistance, 232 C remains 232 C. However, cooking times may be longer as heat distribution isn't as efficient. When using a microwave with convection settings, treat it like a small fan oven and reduce the temperature accordingly.</p>

<h3>Baking at 232 C Fan Equivalent</h3>
<p>When baking at 210 C (the fan equivalent of 232 C), you'll notice more even browning and potentially shorter cooking times. This temperature works beautifully for bread, pastries, and <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cookies>cookies</a>, giving them that perfect golden finish without burning.</p>

<h2>Adjusting Cooking Times</h2>
<p>With the temperature reduced to 210 C in a fan oven, you might need to adjust cooking times slightly. Start checking your food about 5-10 minutes earlier than the original recipe suggests. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a> includes specific timings for fan ovens and air fryers to take the guesswork out of cooking.</p>
<p>For air fryers, the cooking time reduction can be more significant - sometimes up to 25% less than conventional oven times. When converting 232 C recipes, begin checking at the halfway point to prevent overcooking. This is especially important for delicate items like fish or <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>roasted vegetables</a>.</p>

<h3>Special Considerations for Air Fryers</h3>
<p>Air fryers' compact size means heat circulates even more intensely than in full-sized fan ovens. When converting 232 C to air fryer settings, you might find that 200 C gives similar results to 210 C in a fan oven. Always refer to your appliance's manual for specific guidance.</p>

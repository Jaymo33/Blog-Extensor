<p>187 C in a fan oven is equivalent to approximately 170 C with the fan setting. This 17-degree reduction accounts for the fan's efficient heat distribution, ensuring even cooking without over-browning. Whether you're baking cakes or roasting vegetables, this conversion is essential for perfect results in modern ovens and air fryers.</p>

<h2>Understanding Fan Oven Temperature Conversions</h2>
<p>Fan ovens circulate hot air around the food, cooking it more evenly and quickly than conventional ovens. The general rule is to reduce the temperature by 20 C when converting from conventional to fan settings, though 187 C specifically converts to 170 C. This adjustment prevents overcooking while maintaining the same cooking time. Many modern recipes at <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> now provide both temperature settings for convenience.</p>
<p>When using an air fryer, which operates similarly to a fan oven, you'll typically follow the same conversion principles. The compact size of air fryers means heat transfers even more efficiently, so monitoring your food is crucial. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more detailed temperature guides across different cooking methods.</p>

<h2>Why 187 C Matters in Baking</h2>
<p>187 C (170 C fan) is a sweet spot for many baking recipes, particularly those requiring gentle, even heat. This temperature works beautifully for delicate cakes, cookies that need to spread evenly, and pastry cases that must cook through without burning. The fan setting's circulating air helps achieve consistent results throughout the oven.</p>
<p>In an air fryer, 170 C (fan equivalent) is ideal for items like scones, muffins, or even <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>air fryer cakes</a>. The rapid air circulation creates perfect browning while keeping the interior moist. Remember to reduce cooking times by about 20% compared to conventional oven recipes when using this temperature in an air fryer.</p>

<h3>Adjusting Cooking Times at 187 C Fan</h3>
<p>While the temperature conversion is straightforward, cooking times may need slight adjustments. Foods typically cook about 25% faster in a fan oven or air fryer at 170 C compared to 187 C in a conventional oven. Start checking your food about 5-10 minutes before the recipe's suggested time, especially for baked goods where precision matters.</p>

<h2>Air Fryer Specifics at 187 C Equivalent</h2>
<p>Air fryers excel at the 170 C (187 C conventional) temperature range for several reasons. This heat level is perfect for achieving crispy exteriors while maintaining juicy interiors in foods like chicken thighs or roasted vegetables. The compact cooking chamber ensures hot air reaches all surfaces of the food efficiently.</p>
<p>For those new to air frying, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a> includes specific instructions for various foods at this temperature. Whether you're cooking frozen foods or fresh ingredients, the 170 C setting (187 C conventional) provides excellent results. Just remember to shake or turn your food halfway through cooking for even browning.</p>

<h3>Special Considerations for Different Foods</h3>
<p>Some ingredients require particular attention at this temperature. Delicate fish fillets might need slightly less time, while dense root vegetables could benefit from the full heat. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable recipes</a> section has specific timing guides for perfect results every time.</p>

<h2>Troubleshooting Common Issues</h2>
<p>If foods are browning too quickly at 170 C fan (187 C conventional), try reducing the temperature by another 10 degrees. Conversely, if cooking seems too slow, verify your oven or air fryer's calibration. Regular cleaning, using our recommended <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning methods</a>, ensures accurate temperature readings and consistent performance.</p>
<p>Uneven cooking at this temperature often indicates overcrowding in the air fryer basket. Leave adequate space between items for proper air circulation. For best results, cook in batches when preparing larger quantities, maintaining the 170 C setting throughout.</p>

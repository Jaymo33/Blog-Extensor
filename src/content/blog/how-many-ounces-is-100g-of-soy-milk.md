<h2>How to Measure 100g of Soy Milk Accurately</h2>  
<p>For the most precise measurement, use a digital kitchen scale set to grams. Simply pour the soy milk until it reaches 100g, then switch the scale to ounces to see the equivalent. If you don’t have a scale, 100g of soy milk is roughly 100ml, as its density is close to water. This method works well for most <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert recipes</a>.</p>  

<h3>Using Measuring Cups for Soy Milk</h3>  
<p>If you’re using a measuring cup, note that 100g of soy milk equals about 0.42 cups. However, cups aren’t as accurate as scales, so for best results, stick to weight measurements. This is especially important for air fryer recipes, where precision affects cooking times and textures.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for 100g of Soy Milk in Air Fryer Recipes</h2>  
<p>100g of soy milk is a versatile ingredient in air fryer cooking. It’s perfect for making dairy-free batters, creamy sauces, or even light custards.

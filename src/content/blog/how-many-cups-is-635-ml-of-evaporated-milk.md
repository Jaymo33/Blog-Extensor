<p>635 ml of evaporated milk is equal to approximately 2.68 cups. This conversion is essential for precise measurements in baking and cooking, especially when using an air fryer. Whether you're whipping up a creamy dessert or a savoury dish, knowing the exact cup equivalent ensures consistent results every time.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>When working with evaporated milk, precision is key. Too much or too little can alter the texture and flavour of your dish. For air fryer recipes, where cooking times are shorter, exact measurements ensure even cooking. A slight variation could mean the difference between a perfect custard and a runny mess.</p>  
<p>At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we emphasise the importance of accurate conversions. Whether you're making a <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert</a> or a savoury dish, getting the liquid measurements right is crucial. Evaporated milk, being thicker than regular milk, requires careful handling to avoid over-pouring.</p>  

<h2>How to Measure 635 ml of Evaporated Milk</h2>  
<p>Using a measuring jug is the easiest way to measure 635 ml of evaporated milk. Look for metric markings on the side for accuracy. If you only have cups, remember that 1 cup equals roughly 237 ml, so 635 ml works out to just under 2 and 3/4 cups.</p>  
<p>For air fryer recipes, like those found on our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipes page</a>, precise measurements ensure even cooking. Evaporated milk is often used in custards, sauces, and baked goods, where consistency matters. A digital kitchen scale can also help verify your measurements if you're unsure.</p>  

<h3>Common Uses for 635 ml of Evaporated Milk</h3>  
<p>Evaporated milk is a versatile ingredient. It’s often used in pies, puddings, and creamy pasta sauces. For air fryer cooking, it’s perfect for making custards or adding richness to casseroles. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a> for more measurement tips.</p>  

<h2>Converting Other Measurements</h2>  
<p>If you’re working with different quantities, here’s a quick reference: 250 ml is about 1 cup, and 500 ml is roughly 2.1 cups. For larger batches, like 1 litre (1000 ml), you’d need just over 4 cups. Always double-check conversions to avoid mistakes.</p>

<h3>Tips for Storing Evaporated Milk</h3>  
<p>Once opened, evaporated milk should be refrigerated and used within a few days. If your recipe calls for 635 ml but you only need part of it, transfer the rest to an airtight container. This prevents spoilage and ensures freshness for future recipes.</p>

<p>200 grams of milk is roughly 0.85 cups in the UK and 0.83 cups in the US. This conversion is essential for baking and cooking, especially when using an air fryer for recipes that require precise measurements. Whether you're whipping up a cake or a creamy sauce, knowing how to convert grams to cups ensures your dish turns out perfectly every time.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Getting the right amount of milk is crucial for recipes, particularly in baking where precision affects texture and rise. Too much or too little milk can throw off the balance of your batter or dough. For air fryer recipes, like those on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, accurate measurements ensure even cooking and perfect results. Whether you're making pancakes or a custard, 200 grams of milk should be measured carefully.</p>  

<p>Different types of milk (whole, skim, or plant-based) have slight variations in density, but the standard conversion remains reliable for most cooking needs. If you're using a recipe from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert recipes</a>, sticking to the correct measurement guarantees the right consistency.</p>  

<h3>UK vs. US Cup Measurements</h3>  
<p>In the UK, a standard cup holds 240ml, while in the US, it's slightly less at 237ml. This small difference means 200 grams of milk converts to about 0.85 cups in the UK and 0.83 cups in the US. For most home cooking, this variance won’t make a huge difference, but for precision baking, it’s worth noting.</p>  

<h2>How to Measure 200 Grams of Milk Without Scales</h2>  
<p>If you don’t have a kitchen scale, you can still measure 200 grams of milk using a measuring cup.

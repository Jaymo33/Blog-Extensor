<p>0.5 cups of water equals 118.29 ml, a crucial measurement for precise cooking and baking in your air fryer. Whether you're following a recipe from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> or adjusting liquid quantities, knowing this conversion ensures perfect results every time.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on precise ingredient ratios to achieve crispy, evenly cooked dishes. Using the correct amount of water—like 118.29 ml for 0.5 cups—prevents soggy or dry outcomes. Many recipes on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes</a> specify ml for consistency, especially in batters and sauces.</p>  
<p>Incorrect measurements can throw off cooking times and textures. For example, adding too much water to a marinade might dilute flavours, while too little could cause uneven browning. Always double-check conversions like 0.5 cups to ml for foolproof air frying.</p>  

<h2>How to Measure 0.5 Cups of Water Without a Measuring Cup</h2>  
<p>If you don’t have a measuring cup, use a kitchen scale: 0.5 cups of water weighs roughly 118 grams, which equals 118.29 ml. Alternatively, a standard UK tablespoon holds 15 ml, so 8 tablespoons approximate 0.5 cups (120 ml). For more tips, check our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air-fryer-conversion-chart</a>.</p>  

<h3>US vs. UK Cup Measurements</h3>  
<p>While 0.5 US cups equal 118.29 ml, UK cups are slightly larger at 142 ml per 0.5 cups. Most modern recipes, including those on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/baking>airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/baking</a>, use US measurements unless specified.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for 0.5 Cups of Water in Air Fryer Recipes</h2>  
<p>This quantity is ideal for thinning sauces, steaming vegetables, or creating light batters. For instance, a crispy tofu marinade might call for 0.5 cups (118.29 ml) of water mixed with soy sauce. Explore <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/tofu>tofu recipes</a> for inspiration.</p>  
<p>When reheating leftovers, adding 118.29 ml of water to the air fryer basket can prevent drying out. Just ensure excess water is drained after cooking to maintain crispiness.</p>  

<h3>Converting Other Liquids Beyond Water</h3>  
<p>While 0.5 cups of water is 118.29 ml, thicker liquids like oil or syrup may vary slightly in weight. Always refer to recipe-specific instructions for best results.</p>

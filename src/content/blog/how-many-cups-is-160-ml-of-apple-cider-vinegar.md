<p>160 ml of apple cider vinegar equals approximately ⅔ cup. This conversion is essential for precision in cooking and baking, especially when using an air fryer where exact measurements can impact texture and flavour.

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of apple cider vinegar can make or break a recipe. Too much can overpower the dish, while too little might leave it lacking depth. For air fryer recipes, where ingredients cook quickly and evenly, precision is key. A 160 ml measurement of apple cider vinegar translates to about ⅔ cup, but slight variations can occur based on the density of the liquid.</p>  

<p>If you're working with a recipe from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, you'll often find measurements in both metric and imperial units. This makes it easier to follow, whether you're in the UK or elsewhere. Always double-check your conversions to avoid mishaps, especially when dealing with potent ingredients like apple cider vinegar.</p>  

<h3>Tools for Measuring Liquids</h3>  
<p>A liquid measuring cup is the best tool for converting 160 ml of apple cider vinegar to cups. These cups typically have clear markings for both millilitres and cups, making it simple to measure accurately. Avoid using dry measuring cups, as they can lead to slight inaccuracies with liquids. For the most precise results, pour the vinegar slowly and check at eye level.</p>

<p>85 ml of tomato sauce is roughly 0.36 cups (or just over 1/3 cup). This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements can affect texture and flavour. Whether you’re making a rich pasta sauce or a tangy pizza base, knowing how much 85 ml translates to in cups ensures consistency. For more air fryer measurement tips, visit <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>our conversion chart</a>.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Using the correct amount of tomato sauce can make or break your dish. Too much, and your food might turn soggy; too little, and it could dry out. The air fryer’s rapid circulation means ingredients cook faster, so precision is key. For example, if a recipe calls for 85 ml of tomato sauce (0.36 cups), eyeballing it could lead to uneven results. Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> for perfectly balanced meals every time.</p>  

<p>Tomato sauce is a staple in many dishes, from lasagne to meatballs. When adapting stovetop recipes for the air fryer, converting millilitres to cups ensures you maintain the intended flavour profile. A slight miscalculation could alter the dish’s moisture content, especially in compact air fryer baskets. For more tips on adapting recipes, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable-based recipes</a>.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure 85 ml of Tomato Sauce Without a Scale</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a measuring jug, use a standard tablespoon—one tablespoon holds about 15 ml, so 85 ml is roughly 5.5 tablespoons. Alternatively, fill a liquid measuring cup to the 1/3-cup mark and add a teaspoon extra. This method works well for small quantities like 85 ml of tomato sauce, ensuring your air fryer dishes turn out perfectly.

<h2>Common Recipes Using 85 ml of Tomato Sauce</h2>  
<p>Many air fryer recipes use 85 ml (0.36 cups) of tomato sauce as a base. For instance, a single-serving pizza or stuffed peppers often requires this amount to avoid sogginess. The concentrated heat of the air fryer means sauces reduce faster, so sticking to 85 ml ensures the right consistency. Discover delicious ideas in our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipes section</a>.</p>  

<p>Another popular use for 85 ml of tomato sauce is in marinades or glazes. The small quantity is ideal for coating chicken wings or meatballs without overwhelming them. Since air fryers circulate hot air, a precise 85 ml (or 0.36 cups) helps the sauce caramelise evenly.

<h3>Converting Other Tomato Sauce Measurements</h3>  
<p>If your recipe uses a different amount, here’s a quick reference: 100 ml ≈ 0.42 cups, 50 ml ≈ 0.21 cups, and 200 ml ≈ 0.85 cups. These conversions help scale recipes up or down for your air fryer. Remember, 85 ml of tomato sauce (0.36 cups) is a handy midpoint for small-batch cooking.

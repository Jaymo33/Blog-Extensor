<p>2 tablespoons (tbsp) of treacle weigh approximately 40 grams (g). This conversion is essential for precise baking and cooking, especially when using an air fryer where measurements can make or break a recipe. Whether you're making sticky toffee pudding or glazing meats, knowing the exact weight ensures consistency. For more air fryer conversions, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on even heat distribution, so ingredient ratios must be spot-on. Too much treacle can cause burning, while too little might leave your dish lacking flavour. Measuring by weight (grams) is more reliable than volume (tablespoons) because treacle’s viscosity varies with temperature. If you’re new to air frying, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a> for foolproof ideas.</p>  

<p>Treacle adds depth to desserts like gingerbread or savoury dishes like barbecue glazes. Since air fryers cook faster than conventional ovens, precise measurements prevent overcooking. A digital kitchen scale is a worthwhile investment for consistent results. For sticky ingredients like treacle, lightly oiling your measuring spoon helps it slide off easily.</p>  

<h3>How to measure treacle without a scale</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a scale, use the spoon-and-level method for tablespoons. Fill the spoon until slightly heaped, then level it with a knife. Remember, 2 tbsp of treacle equals roughly 40g, but slight variations won’t ruin most recipes. For baking, though, grams are king—especially in air fryers where margins for error are smaller.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for treacle in air fryer recipes</h2>  
<p>Treacle shines in both sweet and savoury air fryer dishes. Try it in sticky flapjacks, glazed ham, or even as a marinade for roasted vegetables. Its rich, molasses-like flavour pairs well with spices like cinnamon and ginger. Discover more inspiration in our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert category</a>.</p>  

<p>When substituting treacle for other sweeteners, adjust quantities carefully. For example, golden syrup is lighter, so you’d need less by weight. Always preheat your air fryer to avoid uneven cooking, and consider lining the basket with parchment for easier cleanup. Our guide to <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaning</a> has handy tips for tackling sticky residues.</p>  

<h3>Converting other treacle measurements</h3>  
<p>Need more or less than 2 tbsp? Here’s a quick reference: 1 tbsp treacle = 20g, ¼ cup = 80g, and ½ cup = 160g. These conversions work for both blackstrap and light treacle. For larger batches, scale up evenly to maintain the right texture in cakes or sauces.</p>  

<h2>Tips for working with treacle in air fryers</h2>  
<p>Treacle can be messy, so warm the spoon or cup in hot water first to help it pour smoothly. Avoid overloading the air fryer—treacle-based glazes can drip and smoke if crowded. For even coating, brush meats or veggies lightly and rotate them halfway through cooking. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>cake recipes</a> for treacle-infused treats that work beautifully in air fryers.</p>  

<p>Store treacle in a cool, dry place to prevent crystallisation. If it hardens, gently warm the jar in a water bath. Remember, 2 tbsp of treacle (40g) packs a flavour punch, so a little goes a long way in marinades or desserts. Experiment with reducing cooking times by 1–2 minutes when using treacle to account for its sugar content.</p>

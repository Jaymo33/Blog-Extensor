<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Baking</h2>  
<p>Baking in an air fryer requires precision, especially when dealing with ingredients like brown sugar. Too much or too little can affect moisture, browning, and overall taste. Measuring 0.5 cups of brown sugar in grams (100g) ensures your recipes turn out perfectly every time. This is particularly important for delicate bakes like cookies or sponges, where even small deviations can lead to dry or overly dense results.

<p>Brown sugar’s moisture content also plays a role in air fryer cooking. Packed brown sugar will weigh slightly more than loosely filled cups, so using grams eliminates inconsistency. If you’re converting 0.5 cups of brown sugar to grams for the first time, a digital kitchen scale is your best friend. It’s a small investment that pays off in perfectly balanced flavours and textures.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure 0.5 Cups of Brown Sugar Without a Scale</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a scale, lightly spoon brown sugar into a measuring cup and level it off for an approximate 100g equivalent. Avoid packing it down unless the recipe specifies “firmly packed.” For air fryer baking, consistency is key, so consider investing in a scale for precise results. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cookies>cookie recipes</a>, for instance, rely on accurate sugar measurements for that perfect chew.</p>  

<h2>UK vs. US Cup Measurements for Brown Sugar</h2>  
<p>While 0.5 cups of brown sugar in the UK and US both roughly equate to 100g, slight variations can occur due to packing density. British recipes may call for “soft brown sugar,” which has a finer texture than some US varieties. If you’re adapting a recipe from another country, sticking to gram measurements ensures accuracy.

<p>When converting 0.5 cups of brown sugar to grams, always check whether the recipe uses the metric or imperial system.

This is especially true for dishes like air-fried brown sugar glazed salmon or candied nuts, where sugar balance is crucial.</p>  

<h3>Common Recipes Using 0.5 Cups of Brown Sugar</h3>  
<p>Many air fryer recipes call for 0.5 cups (100g) of brown sugar, from sticky glazes to caramelised toppings. Think air-fried cinnamon apples, BBQ sauces, or even brown sugar-crusted bacon.

<h2>Storing Brown Sugar for Optimal Freshness</h2>  
<p>To keep your brown sugar soft and ready for measuring 0.5 cups (100g) at a time, store it in an airtight container with a terra cotta disc or a slice of bread. Hardened sugar can throw off measurements, leading to inaccurate conversions. Proper storage ensures your air fryer recipes turn out as intended, whether you’re baking or glazing.

This small step guarantees that your 0.5 cups of brown sugar in grams remains consistent across batches. After all, nobody wants lumpy sugar in their air-fried desserts or marinades.</p>

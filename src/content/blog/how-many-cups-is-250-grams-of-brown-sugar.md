<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter</h2>
<p>Baking is a science, and even small deviations in measurements can lead to disappointing results. Brown sugar, in particular, can vary in density depending on how it's packed. Lightly packed brown sugar will measure differently than firmly packed, which is why weighing ingredients is often more reliable. If you're using an air fryer for baking, precise measurements ensure even cooking and perfect texture.

This measurement is particularly useful for air fryer recipes, where space and heat distribution require careful ingredient balancing.</p>

<h3>How to Measure Brown Sugar Without a Scale</h3>

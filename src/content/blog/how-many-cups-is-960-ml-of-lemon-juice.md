<p>960 ml of lemon juice equals approximately 4.06 US cups or 3.38 UK cups. This conversion is essential for recipes, especially when using an air fryer, where precise measurements can make or break a dish. Whether you're baking a lemon drizzle cake or marinating chicken, knowing how to convert 960 ml of lemon juice to cups ensures accuracy. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we focus on making kitchen conversions simple and practical for home cooks.</p>

<h2>Understanding Cup Measurements for Lemon Juice</h2>
<p>Lemon juice is a common ingredient in both sweet and savoury dishes, and its acidity can affect the outcome of your recipe. The difference between US and UK cup measurements is crucial. A US cup holds 240 ml, while a UK cup holds 284 ml. This means 960 ml of lemon juice converts to 4.06 US cups or 3.38 UK cups. Always check which measurement system your recipe uses to avoid mistakes.</p>
<p>For air fryer recipes, precision is key. Too much lemon juice can make a dish overly acidic, while too little might leave it bland. If you're working with a recipe from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>our collection</a>, you'll find most use metric measurements, but we also provide conversions for convenience. This ensures your air fryer meals turn out perfectly every time.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Conversions Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>
<p>Air fryers cook food quickly and evenly, but they rely on precise ingredient ratios for the best results. Whether you're making lemon garlic shrimp or a tangy glaze for chicken, knowing how many cups 960 ml of lemon juice equals helps maintain balance. Over-pouring can lead to soggy or overly tart dishes, while under-measuring might leave flavours underwhelming.</p>
<p>If you're new to air fryer cooking, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a> is a handy tool. It covers common measurements, including 960 ml of lemon juice in cups, so you can focus on cooking rather than calculations. This is especially useful for baking, where exact proportions are critical for texture and rise.</p>

<h3>Tips for Measuring Lemon Juice</h3>
<p>When measuring lemon juice, use a liquid measuring cup for accuracy. Pour slowly to the desired mark, checking at eye level to avoid overfilling. Freshly squeezed lemon juice can vary in acidity, so taste as you go if adjusting a recipe. For consistent results, bottled lemon juice works well, but fresh is always best for flavour.</p>

<h2>Common Recipes Using 960 ml of Lemon Juice</h2>
<p>960 ml of lemon juice is a substantial amount, often used in bulk cooking or preserving. You might need this quantity for large batches of lemon curd, marinades for a family feast, or homemade lemonade. In the air fryer, lemon juice is perfect for glazing salmon or adding zest to roasted vegetables.</p>
<p>Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipes</a> for ideas on using lemon juice in marinades. The acidity tenderises the meat while adding bright, fresh flavour. Whether you're meal prepping or cooking for a crowd, knowing how many cups 960 ml of lemon juice equals ensures your dishes are spot-on.</p>

<h3>Converting Other Lemon Juice Quantities</h3>
<p>If you need to convert smaller or larger amounts of lemon juice, the same principles apply. For example, 480 ml is roughly 2.03 US cups or 1.69 UK cups. Keep our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a> bookmarked for quick reference. It’s a lifesaver when scaling recipes up or down for your air fryer.</p>

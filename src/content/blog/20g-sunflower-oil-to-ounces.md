<h2>Why Accurate Oil Measurements Matter in Air Frying</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of sunflower oil in your air fryer prevents soggy or overly dry food.

<p>Different oils have varying densities, but sunflower oil is a popular choice for its neutral flavour and high smoke point. Whether you’re making crispy tofu or golden potatoes, measuring 20g of sunflower oil correctly ensures even cooking.

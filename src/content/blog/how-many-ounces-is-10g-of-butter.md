<p>10g of butter equals approximately 0.35 ounces. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements can make all the difference. Whether you’re whipping up a batch of cookies or preparing a savoury dish, knowing how to convert grams to ounces ensures consistent results. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we focus on making cooking simpler with accurate conversions and easy-to-follow guides.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate butter measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of butter can affect texture, flavour, and cooking time in your air fryer. Too much butter might lead to greasy results, while too little can leave dishes dry. For example, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer cookie recipes</a> rely on precise butter measurements for that perfect chewy texture. Even a slight deviation can alter the outcome, so it’s worth getting it right.</p>  
<p>Many UK recipes use grams, but if you’re working with a scale that only displays ounces, knowing that 10g is roughly 0.35 ounces helps. This is especially useful for baking, where exact ratios are crucial. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a> for other common measurements to simplify your cooking process.</p>  

<h2>How to measure 10g of butter without scales</h2>  
<p>If you don’t have a digital scale, you can still measure 10g of butter using tablespoons. One tablespoon of butter is about 14g, so 10g is just under three-quarters of a tablespoon. This method isn’t as precise as weighing, but it works in a pinch. For best results, we recommend investing in a small kitchen scale—they’re affordable and incredibly handy for air fryer cooking.</p>  

<h3>Converting other butter measurements</h3>  
<p>Need to convert larger amounts? 50g of butter is roughly 1.76 ounces, while 100g equals about 3.53 ounces. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert recipes</a> often call for these measurements, so bookmark this guide for quick reference. Remember, air fryers cook faster than conventional ovens, so precise ingredient ratios are even more important.</p>  

<h2>Common mistakes when measuring butter</h2>  
<p>One of the biggest mistakes is using melted butter when the recipe calls for solid butter, or vice versa. This can throw off measurements since melted butter packs differently. Always check whether your recipe specifies softened, cold, or melted butter. For example, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning guide</a> also highlights how excess butter can cause smoke in the air fryer, so accuracy keeps your appliance in top shape.</p>  
<p>Another error is eyeballing measurements instead of weighing. While it might seem quicker, it often leads to inconsistent results. If you’re serious about air fryer cooking, a scale is a worthwhile investment. Plus, it’s useful for other ingredients like flour, sugar, and even meat portions.</p>  

<h3>Butter alternatives in air fryer recipes</h3>  
<p>If you’re out of butter, you can substitute oils like coconut or olive oil, but the conversion isn’t 1:1. For 10g of butter, use about 7g (0.25 oz) of oil instead. Some recipes, like our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable dishes</a>, work well with oil sprays for even coating. Just remember that butter adds richness, so adjust seasonings accordingly.</p>

<p>2.5 tablespoons (tbsp) of plain flour equals approximately 20 grams. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements ensure perfect results. Whether you're baking cakes or coating chicken, knowing how many grams are in 2.5 tbsp of plain flour helps avoid kitchen mishaps.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate flour measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers cook food quickly and evenly, but inaccurate measurements can lead to dry or dense results. Using 2.5 tbsp of plain flour without converting to grams might throw off your recipe. For example, a slight excess can make coatings clumpy, while too little won’t crisp properly. That’s why <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion charts</a> are a lifesaver for air fryer enthusiasts.</p>  

<p>Many UK recipes, especially those on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, list ingredients in grams for consistency. If you only have measuring spoons, converting 2.5 tbsp plain flour to grams ensures your dish turns out as intended. This is particularly important for baking, where precision is key.</p>  

<h3>How to measure 2.5 tbsp of plain flour correctly</h3>  
<p>To get an accurate 20 grams from 2.5 tbsp, spoon the flour into the tablespoon and level it off with a knife. Scooping directly from the bag can compact the flour, leading to more than 20 grams. For best results, use digital scales—especially when preparing air fryer recipes like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>cakes</a> or batters.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for 2.5 tbsp plain flour in air fryer recipes</h2>  
<p>This small quantity is perfect for light coatings or thickening sauces. For instance, 2.5 tbsp plain flour (20 grams) works well for dusting chicken before air frying or creating a roux for gravies. It’s also ideal for small-batch baking, such as single-serving <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cookies>cookies</a>.</p>  

<p>If you’re reheating leftovers in the air fryer, a light flour coating can restore crispiness. Just remember: 2.5 tbsp of plain flour equals 20 grams, so you won’t overdo it.

<h3>Converting other flour quantities for air fryer cooking</h3>  
<p>Once you know 2.5 tbsp plain flour is 20 grams, scaling up or down is easy. For example, 5 tbsp would be 40 grams, while 1 tbsp equals 8 grams. This flexibility helps adapt recipes to your air fryer’s capacity without guesswork.</p>

<h3>Converting for specific ingredients</h3>
<p>When converting 25.25 kg to pounds for specific ingredients, consider the food’s density. For example, 25.25 kg of potatoes (55.67 pounds) will take up more space in the air fryer than 25.25 kg of meat. This affects how you layer or batch cook for the best results. Understanding the conversion helps you plan cooking times and techniques more effectively. It’s all about getting the most out of your air fryer and enjoying delicious, well-cooked food.</p>

<p>360 ml of honey is approximately 1.5 cups. This conversion is essential for baking, cooking, or using your air fryer to ensure recipes turn out perfectly every time. Honey’s thickness can make measuring tricky, but with this simple conversion, you’ll never go wrong.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Honey Measurements Matter</h2>
<p>Getting the right amount of honey is crucial for both taste and texture in your dishes. Too much honey can make a recipe overly sweet or sticky, while too little might leave it bland. Whether you’re making a glaze for air-fried chicken or a cake batter, precision matters. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we emphasise the importance of accurate measurements for flawless results. Honey’s density means volume conversions like 360 ml to cups aren’t always straightforward, but we’ve got you covered.</p>

<p>For air fryer recipes, especially those involving marinades or glazes, the right honey measurement ensures even cooking and perfect caramelisation. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more handy tips. Whether you’re in the UK or the US, this conversion works universally, so you can confidently tackle any recipe.</p>

<h2>How to Measure 360 ml of Honey in Cups</h2>
<p>Measuring honey can be messy, but a few tricks make it easier. First, lightly grease your measuring cup with oil to help the honey slide out smoothly. Pour the honey slowly, levelling it off at the 1.5-cup mark for accuracy. If you’re using a scale, 360 ml of honey weighs roughly 504 grams, but cups are often more convenient for home cooks.</p>

<h3>Tools for Measuring Honey</h3>
<p>A liquid measuring cup with clear markings is ideal for honey, as it lets you check the meniscus (the curve at the liquid’s surface) for precision. For smaller quantities, tablespoons or a kitchen scale can be handy. If you’re adapting a recipe from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>our collection</a>, note that some may list honey by weight or volume, so double-check before starting.</p>

<h2>Common Uses for 360 ml of Honey</h2>
<p>This quantity of honey is perfect for batch cooking or larger recipes. Use it in marinades for air-fried salmon or glaze for roasted vegetables—both featured in our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/salmon>salmon recipes</a>. Honey also works wonders in baking, adding moisture and sweetness to cakes or cookies. For a quick breakfast, drizzle it over air-fried apples or porridge.</p>

<p>Cleaning sticky honey residue from your air fryer? Our guide on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaning</a> has you covered. Remember, 360 ml of honey (1.5 cups) is a versatile amount, whether you’re cooking for a crowd or meal prepping. Adjust other ingredients accordingly to keep flavours balanced.</p>

<h3>Converting Honey in International Recipes</h3>
<p>Recipes from different countries may use varying measurements. If a US recipe calls for 1.5 cups of honey, you now know it’s 360 ml. For UK recipes, ml is more common, so this conversion simplifies things. Always verify the recipe’s origin to avoid confusion, especially with baking, where precision is key.</p>

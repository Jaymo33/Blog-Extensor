<p>35 ml of coconut milk equals approximately 0.15 cups (or roughly 1/8 cup plus 1 teaspoon). This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements can make or break your dish. Whether you're whipping up a curry, baking a cake, or preparing a marinade, knowing how to convert 35 ml of coconut milk to cups ensures consistency and delicious results.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on precise ingredient ratios to achieve the perfect texture and flavour. Too much or too little coconut milk can affect the moisture content of your dish, leading to dry or soggy outcomes. For example, if you're making a coconut-based sauce for <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer chicken</a>, 35 ml of coconut milk should be measured accurately to balance the flavours. Similarly, baking recipes like coconut cupcakes require exact measurements to ensure the batter rises properly.</p>  
<p>Using a kitchen scale or measuring spoons can help you get the right amount of coconut milk. If you don't have a scale, remember that 35 ml is just under 1/8 cup (30 ml) plus an extra teaspoon (5 ml). For more conversions, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> to simplify your cooking process.</p>  

<h2>How to Measure 35 ml of Coconut Milk Without a Scale</h2>  
<p>Not everyone has a kitchen scale handy, but you can still measure 35 ml of coconut milk accurately. A standard metric measuring cup will show millilitres, making it easy to pour the exact amount. If you're using US cups, remember that 1 cup equals 240 ml, so 35 ml is roughly 0.15 cups. Alternatively, use tablespoons—1 tablespoon is about 15 ml, so 35 ml would be 2 tablespoons plus 1 teaspoon.</p>  

<h3>Tips for Working with Coconut Milk in Air Fryer Recipes</h3>  
<p>Coconut milk can separate or curdle if not handled properly. Shake the can well before measuring to ensure an even consistency. If your recipe calls for 35 ml of coconut milk, consider using full-fat coconut milk for richer flavour, especially in dishes like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>air fryer desserts</a>. For lighter options, low-fat coconut milk works, but adjust other liquids accordingly.</p>  

<h2>Common Recipes Using 35 ml of Coconut Milk</h2>  
<p>Many air fryer recipes use small amounts of coconut milk for marinades, glazes, or sauces. For instance, a Thai-inspired <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>air fryer chicken</a> might require 35 ml of coconut milk mixed with spices. Vegan dishes like tofu curry or coconut-infused vegetables also benefit from this measurement. If you're experimenting, start with 35 ml and adjust to taste.</p>  
<p>For baking, 35 ml of coconut milk can replace dairy milk in cakes or muffins. It adds a subtle tropical flavour and keeps baked goods moist. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipe collection</a> for inspiration on how to use this measurement creatively.</p>  

<h3>Storing Leftover Coconut Milk</h3>  
<p>If you only need 35 ml of coconut milk for a recipe, store the rest in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 4 days. Alternatively, freeze it in ice cube trays for easy portioning. Just thaw and use it in your next <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/breakfast>air fryer breakfast</a> or smoothie.</p>

<p>391°F converts to approximately 200°C in a fan oven, making it ideal for roasting, baking, and air frying. This temperature is commonly used for crispy chicken, roasted vegetables, or even homemade chips. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we recommend this setting for achieving golden, evenly cooked results without drying out your food.</p>

<h2>Why Convert 391°F to Fan Oven?</h2>
<p>Fan ovens circulate hot air for faster, more even cooking, so temperatures often need adjusting from conventional recipes. Converting 391°F ensures your dishes cook perfectly without burning or undercooking. This is especially useful for air fryers, which work similarly to fan ovens but in a compact space. Many <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> originally designed for conventional ovens benefit from this conversion.</p>
<p>For example, American recipes often list temperatures in Fahrenheit, while UK appliances typically use Celsius. Knowing that 391°F equals 200°C in a fan oven saves time and avoids mishaps. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a> simplifies this further for popular dishes like roasted potatoes or baked goods.</p>

<h2>How to Use 391°F in an Air Fryer</h2>
<p>Air fryers operate like mini fan ovens, so the 391°F (200°C) conversion works seamlessly. This temperature is perfect for achieving crispiness while keeping interiors tender. Whether you’re cooking frozen foods or fresh ingredients, maintaining accuracy is key. Always preheat your air fryer for 3–5 minutes at this setting for consistent results.</p>
<p>Popular dishes at this temperature include <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken wings</a>, which need high heat for crispy skin, or vegetable bakes that require even roasting. If your air fryer lacks a 200°C preset, manually set it and monitor cooking times, as they may differ slightly from oven recipes.</p>

<h3>Adjustments for Different Foods</h3>
<p>While 391°F (200°C) suits many foods, some require slight tweaks. Delicate items like fish or pastries might need 10–15°C less to prevent over-browning. Conversely, dense foods like homemade chips benefit from the full heat for extra crunch. Always refer to specific recipe guidelines on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> for tailored advice.</p>

<h2>Common Mistakes When Converting Temperatures</h2>
<p>One error is assuming fan oven and conventional oven temperatures are identical, leading to overcooked dishes. Another is neglecting to adjust cooking times—fan ovens and air fryers cook faster, so reduce times by 10–20%. For 391°F conversions, start checking food 5–10 minutes earlier than the recipe suggests.</p>
<p>Using the wrong rack position can also affect results. In fan ovens, middle racks ensure even air circulation, while air fryers require shaking or flipping food halfway. For messy dishes like saucy wings, consider <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer liners</a> to simplify cleanup without compromising crispiness.</p>

<h3>UK vs. US Appliance Differences</h3>
<p>UK fan ovens typically display Celsius, while US models use Fahrenheit. Knowing that 391°F equals 200°C helps bridge this gap. Most modern air fryers allow switching between units, but manual conversion ensures compatibility with older models or international recipes.</p>

<h3>How to Adjust Cooking Times</h3>
<p>When converting 441 fan oven to conventional oven, cooking times may also need tweaking. Fan ovens cook faster, so reduce the time by 5-10 minutes when using a conventional oven.

<h2>Common Mistakes to Avoid</h2>
<p>One common error is forgetting to adjust the temperature when converting 441 fan oven to conventional oven. This can lead to undercooked or burnt food. Another mistake is not checking the oven’s calibration, as older models may run hotter or cooler. Always preheat your oven for accurate results.

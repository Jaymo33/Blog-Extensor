<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of chilli sauce can make or break your dish. Too little, and your meal might lack flavour; too much, and it could become overpowering. The air fryer’s intense heat means sauces reduce quickly, so precise measurements prevent mishaps.

Converting 2.5 tbsp of chilli sauce to grams ensures you nail the recipe every time.</p>  

<p>Many home cooks struggle with volume-to-weight conversions, especially with thick sauces like chilli. A standard UK tablespoon holds 15ml, but density varies. Chilli sauce typically weighs around 15g per tbsp, but checking your brand’s label guarantees accuracy.

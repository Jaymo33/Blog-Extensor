<p>760 ml of heavy cream is approximately 3.2 cups. This conversion is essential for baking, cooking, or preparing air fryer recipes that require precise measurements. Whether you're whipping up a dessert or a creamy sauce, knowing the exact cup equivalent ensures perfect results every time.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of heavy cream can make or break a recipe. Too little, and your dish might lack richness; too much, and it could become overly dense. For air fryer cooking, precise measurements help maintain texture and consistency, especially when making dishes like creamy pasta bakes or indulgent desserts. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more handy tips.</p>  

<p>Heavy cream, also known as double cream in the UK, has a high fat content, which affects its volume. Unlike milk or water, its density means conversions aren’t always straightforward. That’s why knowing 760 ml equals roughly 3.2 cups is so useful for home cooks and bakers alike.</p>  

<h2>How to Measure 760 ml of Heavy Cream</h2>  
<p>For the most accurate results, use a liquid measuring cup with clear markings. Fill it to the 760 ml line, or measure out 3.2 cups if your recipe calls for it. If you don’t have a measuring cup, a kitchen scale can help—760 ml of heavy cream weighs about 780 grams.</p>  

<h3>Using Heavy Cream in Air Fryer Recipes</h3>  
<p>Heavy cream works wonderfully in air fryer recipes, from creamy sauces to rich desserts. Try it in a decadent mac and cheese or a fluffy cheesecake. For inspiration, browse our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> collection.</p>  

<h2>Common Conversions for Heavy Cream</h2>  
<p>If you’re scaling a recipe up or down, here are some quick conversions: 250 ml is roughly 1 cup, 500 ml is about 2 cups, and 1 litre equals approximately 4 cups. These approximations help when adjusting portion sizes for your air fryer dishes.</p>  

<h3>UK vs. US Measurements</h3>  
<p>In the UK, heavy cream is often labelled as double cream, with a fat content of around 48%. In the US, heavy cream typically contains 36-40% fat. While the slight difference in fat content doesn’t drastically affect volume conversions, it’s worth noting for texture and taste.</p>

<h2>Storing Leftover Heavy Cream</h2>  
<p>If you have leftover heavy cream, store it in an airtight container in the fridge for up to a week. You can also freeze it for longer storage, though it may separate slightly when thawed. Shake or whisk it before using in recipes like those found on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>.</p>

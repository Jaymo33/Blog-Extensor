<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of heavy cream can make or break a recipe. Too little, and your dish might lack richness; too much, and it could become overly dense.

<p>Heavy cream, also known as double cream in the UK, has a high fat content, which affects its volume. Unlike milk or water, its density means conversions aren’t always straightforward. That’s why knowing 760 ml equals roughly 3.2 cups is so useful for home cooks and bakers alike.</p>  

<h2>How to Measure 760 ml of Heavy Cream</h2>  
<p>For the most accurate results, use a liquid measuring cup with clear markings. Fill it to the 760 ml line, or measure out 3.2 cups if your recipe calls for it. If you don’t have a measuring cup, a kitchen scale can help—760 ml of heavy cream weighs about 780 grams.</p>

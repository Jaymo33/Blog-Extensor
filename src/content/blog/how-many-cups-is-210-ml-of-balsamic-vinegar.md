<h3>How to Measure 210 ml of Balsamic Vinegar Without a Measuring Cup</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a measuring cup, you can use a standard metric measuring jug to measure 210 ml of balsamic vinegar. Alternatively, 210 ml is roughly seven fluid ounces, which can help if you’re using imperial measurements. For smaller quantities, a tablespoon holds about 15 ml, so 14 tablespoons equal 210 ml.</p>  

<h2>Common Recipes Using 210 ml of Balsamic Vinegar</h2>  
<p>Many air fryer recipes call for 210 ml of balsamic vinegar, especially marinades and glazes. For example, a <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>balsamic roasted vegetable</a> dish might require this amount to coat the veggies evenly. Similarly, 210 ml of balsamic vinegar works perfectly for a reduction sauce to drizzle over <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/beef>air fryer steak</a>.</p>  

<p>When reducing balsamic vinegar in the air fryer, 210 ml will yield about half a cup of thick, sweet glaze. This is ideal for drizzling over dishes like air fryer Brussels sprouts or grilled peaches. Always measure carefully to avoid over-reducing, which can make the vinegar too sticky or bitter.</p>  

<h3>Converting 210 ml of Balsamic Vinegar for Different Cup Sizes</h3>  
<p>In the UK, a standard cup measures 250 ml, so 210 ml of balsamic vinegar is just under one cup (0.84 cups). In the US, where a cup is 240 ml, 210 ml equals roughly 0.875 cups. For baking or precise recipes, these small differences matter, so always double-check your conversions.</p>  

<h2>Tips for Storing Leftover Balsamic Vinegar</h2>  
<p>If you have leftover balsamic vinegar after measuring 210 ml, store it in a cool, dark place to preserve its flavour. Transfer it to a glass bottle with a tight seal to prevent oxidation.

<p>1.5 cups of fish sauce equals approximately 12 ounces (oz) in UK measurements. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise quantities can make or break a dish.

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Fish sauce is a potent ingredient, and even a slight variation can overpower your dish. In an air fryer, where flavours concentrate, precision is key. Too much fish sauce can lead to overly salty results, while too little might leave your meal bland. Using 1.5 cups of fish sauce (12 oz) ensures balanced flavours, especially in recipes like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>air fryer chicken wings</a> or stir-fries.</p>  

<p>Many UK cooks rely on volume measurements, but weight (ounces) is often more reliable. A kitchen scale eliminates guesswork, particularly for sticky or dense liquids like fish sauce. If you're adapting a recipe from cups to ounces, this conversion simplifies the process.

<h3>Converting Cups to Ounces for Fish Sauce</h3>  
<p>Fish sauce has a similar density to water, so 1 cup equals roughly 8 fluid ounces. However, weight (oz) and fluid ounces (fl oz) differ slightly. For 1.5 cups of fish sauce, you'll need about 12 oz by weight. This conversion works for most Asian-inspired air fryer dishes, from glazes to marinades.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for 1.5 Cups of Fish Sauce</h2>  
<p>This quantity is ideal for batch cooking or meal prep. Use it to marinate proteins like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/shrimp>shrimp</a> or tofu before air frying, or mix it into dipping sauces. Fish sauce adds umami depth to dressings and stir-fry bases, enhancing flavours without extra salt. Remember, a little goes a long way in the air fryer’s intense heat.</p>

<h3>Scaling Up or Down</h3>  
<p>Need half the amount? 0.75 cups of fish sauce equals 6 oz. Doubling the recipe? 3 cups translate to 24 oz. This flexibility makes it easy to adjust portions for your air fryer’s capacity. Always measure fish sauce carefully—its intense flavour can dominate if overused.</p>

<p>0.375 cup of garlic paste equals approximately 3 ounces (oz) in weight. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes, where precise measurements can make all the difference. Whether you’re whipping up a marinade or seasoning your favourite dish, knowing the exact weight ensures consistency. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we focus on making cooking easier with accurate conversions and tips.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on even cooking, and incorrect measurements can lead to uneven results. Too much garlic paste might overpower your dish, while too little could leave it bland. For example, if you’re preparing a <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipe</a>, 3 ounces of garlic paste will give you the perfect balance of flavour. Always measure ingredients like garlic paste carefully to avoid disappointments.</p>  

<p>Using a kitchen scale is the best way to ensure accuracy, especially for sticky ingredients like garlic paste. If you don’t have one, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> can help. Remember, 0.375 cup of garlic paste is roughly 3 ounces, but slight variations can occur based on density.</p>  

<h3>How to measure garlic paste without a scale</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a kitchen scale, use measuring cups with a spatula to level off the garlic paste. Pack it lightly to avoid air gaps, which can affect the weight. For 0.375 cup, fill a 1/4 cup measure and then add half of another 1/4 cup. This method gets you close to 3 ounces, though a scale is always more precise.</p>  

<h2>Common recipes using 0.375 cup of garlic paste</h2>  
<p>Many <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> call for garlic paste, especially in marinades and sauces. For instance, a garlic butter shrimp dish might require 3 ounces of garlic paste for the perfect kick. Similarly, roasted vegetables or <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/potatoes>potatoes</a> benefit from this measurement for balanced flavour.</p>  

<p>Garlic paste is also great for meal prep. Mix 0.375 cup (3 oz) with olive oil and herbs for a versatile marinade. Store it in an airtight container, and you’ve got a flavour booster ready for multiple meals. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/meal-prep>meal prep section</a> for more ideas.</p>  

<h3>Cleaning your air fryer after using garlic paste</h3>  
<p>Garlic paste can leave strong odours in your air fryer if not cleaned properly. After cooking, wipe the basket with a damp cloth and use a mild <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner</a> to remove residue. This keeps your appliance fresh and ready for the next recipe.</p>

    "text": "Yes, you'll typically need to increase cooking times by 10-15% when using conventional oven settings.

Always use visual cues and internal temperature checks for accuracy."

<p>426 fan oven converts to approximately 400°F in a conventional oven. This slight reduction accounts for the more efficient heat distribution in fan-assisted ovens. Whether you're baking, roasting, or air frying, understanding this conversion ensures your recipes turn out perfectly every time.</p>

<h2>Understanding Fan Oven vs Conventional Oven Temperatures</h2>
<p>Fan ovens circulate hot air around the food using a built-in fan, cooking food more evenly and quickly. Conventional ovens rely on natural heat circulation, which can create hot spots. The general rule is to reduce conventional oven temperatures by 20-25°F when converting from fan oven settings. This means 426 fan oven becomes 400-405°F in a traditional oven.</p>
<p>This conversion is particularly important when using recipes from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> that were developed for fan ovens. Many British recipes specify fan oven temperatures, while American recipes typically use conventional oven settings. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> can help you navigate these differences with ease.</p>

<h3>Why the Temperature Difference Matters</h3>
<p>The 26°F reduction prevents overcooking when moving from fan to conventional ovens. Fan ovens' efficient heat distribution means they cook food faster at the same temperature setting. Without this adjustment, your cakes might burn or your roast could dry out. This principle applies whether you're using a full-size oven or an <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer for smaller portions</a>.</p>

<h2>Practical Conversion Examples</h2>
<p>Let's look at some common cooking scenarios where this conversion proves invaluable. When baking cookies at 426 fan oven, you'd set your conventional oven to 400°F. For roasting chicken, the same conversion applies - 426 fan becomes 400 conventional. This consistency makes recipe adaptation straightforward across different kitchen appliances.</p>
<p>The conversion also works in reverse. If a conventional oven recipe calls for 400°F, you'd set your fan oven to 426°F. This knowledge becomes especially useful when trying <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipes</a> developed for different oven types. Remember to always check food doneness a few minutes early when using converted temperatures.</p>

<h3>Special Considerations for Air Fryers</h3>
<p>Air fryers operate similarly to fan ovens but in a more compact space. When converting 426 fan oven to air fryer settings, you might need to reduce both temperature and cooking time. As a starting point, try 390°F in your air fryer and check progress regularly. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer maintenance guide</a> can help keep your appliance performing at its best for accurate temperature control.</p>

<h2>Temperature Conversion Chart</h2>
<p>For quick reference, here's how 426 fan oven compares to other common cooking methods. In a conventional oven, it's 400°F. For gas mark settings, this equates to mark 6. In Celsius, 426 fan is 220°C, which converts to 220°C conventional as well (but with different cooking times).</p>
<p>These conversions become second nature with practice. Whether you're preparing <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>roasted vegetables</a> or baking desserts, understanding temperature relationships ensures consistent results. Bookmark this page or print the chart for easy access in your kitchen.</p>

<h3>Testing Your Oven's Accuracy</h3>
<p>Oven thermostats can drift over time, affecting your conversion accuracy. Invest in an oven thermometer to verify your appliance's actual temperature. If your conventional oven runs hot, you might need to reduce the 400°F setting further. Regular calibration ensures your 426 fan to conventional oven conversions remain precise.</p>

<p>0.33 cup of passata equals approximately 2.8 ounces (80 grams). This measurement is essential for air fryer recipes where precision ensures perfect results. Whether you're making a rich tomato sauce or a hearty stew, knowing the exact weight helps maintain consistency. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we focus on accurate conversions to make cooking easier. Let’s dive deeper into why this matters and how to measure passata correctly.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate passata measurements matter</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of passata can make or break your air fryer dish. Too little, and your sauce might lack depth; too much, and it could become watery. Passata, a smooth tomato puree, is a staple in many recipes, from pasta sauces to casseroles. Measuring 0.33 cup of passata correctly ensures your dish has the perfect balance of flavour and texture. For more air fryer tips, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>  

<p>Passata is often used in Italian-inspired dishes, and its consistency can vary slightly between brands. That’s why weighing it in ounces or grams is more reliable than relying solely on volume. If you’re preparing a recipe from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>our collection</a>, precise measurements ensure you get the intended results. Whether you’re cooking for one or meal prepping, accuracy saves time and reduces waste.</p>  

<h3>How to measure passata without scales</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a kitchen scale, you can still measure 0.33 cup of passata accurately. Use a liquid measuring cup for the most precise results, filling it just below the 1/3 cup mark. Alternatively, a standard tablespoon holds about 0.5 ounces, so roughly 5.5 tablespoons will give you 0.33 cup.

<h2>Common uses for passata in air fryer cooking</h2>

Try it in stuffed peppers, meatballs, or as a topping for air-fried pizzas. Since 0.33 cup of passata is roughly 2.8 ounces, you can easily adjust recipes to suit your needs.

<h3>Storing leftover passata</h3>

<p>Full-fat and low-fat cottage cheese have almost identical weights per gram, so 40g will always be around 1.41 ounces regardless of fat percentage. However, full-fat varieties may appear slightly denser due to less water content. This makes it ideal for air fryer recipes where moisture control matters, like crispy coatings or stuffed peppers.</p>

<p>25g of soy sauce equals approximately 0.88 ounces. This conversion is handy for air fryer recipes where precision matters, especially when marinating meats or seasoning dishes. Whether you're whipping up a quick stir-fry or a flavourful glaze, knowing how to convert grams to ounces ensures your dish turns out just right. For more air fryer measurement tips, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>

<h2>Why convert 25g of soy sauce to ounces?</h2>  
<p>Many UK recipes, especially those for air fryers, use metric measurements like grams. However, some kitchen scales or older cookbooks might display ounces. Converting 25g of soy sauce to ounces (0.88 oz) helps avoid guesswork and ensures your dish isn’t too salty or bland. Soy sauce is a staple in marinades, sauces, and even <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>air fryer chicken recipes</a>, so accuracy is key.</p>  
<p>If you’re using an air fryer, precise measurements can make the difference between perfectly crispy tofu or soggy results. A digital scale that switches between grams and ounces is ideal, but our quick conversion saves the day if yours doesn’t. For more air fryer-friendly recipes, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a>.</p>  

<h2>How to measure 25g of soy sauce without scales</h2>  
<p>No scales? No problem. One tablespoon of soy sauce weighs roughly 15g, so 25g is just under two tablespoons. For smaller amounts, a teaspoon holds about 5g. Keep in mind that soy sauce’s density can vary slightly by brand, so these are handy approximations rather than exact measures.</p>  
<p>If you’re adapting a recipe from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, always check whether it uses metric or imperial measurements. For sticky sauces like soy, lightly greasing your measuring spoon can help it slide off cleanly. This trick works wonders when prepping marinades for <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>air-fried vegetables</a>.</p>  

<h3>Soy sauce substitutes in air fryer cooking</h3>  
<p>If you’re out of soy sauce, try tamari (a gluten-free alternative) or coconut aminos for a sweeter twist. Both have similar saltiness, so you can use the same 25g to ounces conversion. These swaps work well in air fryer dishes, from crispy tofu to glazed salmon.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for 25g of soy sauce in air fryer recipes</h2>  
<p>Twenty-five grams of soy sauce is perfect for marinating two chicken breasts or tossing with 500g of vegetables before air frying. It’s also ideal for making small batches of dipping sauce or adding umami depth to stir-fries. For easy cleanup after saucy recipes, try our recommended <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner</a>.</p>  
<p>In baking, 25g of soy sauce can enhance savoury muffins or crackers made in the air fryer. Remember that soy sauce reduces and intensifies during cooking, so adjust other seasonings accordingly. For inspiration, browse our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/beef>air fryer beef recipes</a> that use soy sauce.</p>  

<h3>Storing soy sauce for air fryer meals</h3>  
<p>Once opened, soy sauce keeps for about 2-3 years in the fridge. Transfer it to a squeeze bottle for precise pouring when measuring small amounts like 25g (0.88 oz). This also prevents messy drips on your air fryer basket.</p>

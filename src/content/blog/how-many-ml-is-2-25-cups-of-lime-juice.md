<p>Lime juice is a staple in many cuisines, from Mexican tacos to Thai curries.

For smaller quantities, a kitchen scale set to grams (1 ml ≈ 1 g for water-based liquids) can double-check your measurements. Precision ensures your air fryer recipes, like citrus-glazed salmon or lime-infused shrimp, turn out perfectly every time.</p>

faqQ1: "Can I use frozen chicken breast for the 425-gram measurement?"
faqA1: "It’s best to thaw frozen chicken breast before measuring 425 grams, as frozen pieces can vary in density and water content. Thawing ensures accuracy and even cooking in the air fryer. If you must cook from frozen, increase the cooking time by 5–7 minutes."
faqQ2: "How many servings does 425 grams of chicken breast provide?"
faqA2: "425 grams of chicken breast yields about 3–4 servings, depending on portion size. For a main dish, plan for 100–150 grams per person. In salads or wraps, it can stretch further. The air fryer makes it easy to cook in batches for meal prep."
faqQ3: "Does shredded chicken measure differently than diced for 425 grams?"
faqA3: "Yes, shredded chicken is fluffier and may fill more cups than diced for the same weight (425 grams). Lightly pack shredded chicken into the measuring cup for accuracy. Diced chicken is denser, so 425 grams will take up slightly less volume."
faqQ4: "Can I substitute chicken thighs for 425 grams of chicken breast?"
faqA4: "Yes, but thighs have more fat and may cook differently. Use the same weight (425 grams), but adjust air fryer time slightly—thighs may need 2–3 extra minutes. They’ll yield a richer flavour but measure similarly in cups when chopped."

faqQ1: "Is 200 grams of water the same as 200ml?"
faqA1: "Yes, for water, 200 grams equals 200ml because water’s density is 1g/ml. This makes converting between weight and volume straightforward. However, this 1:1 ratio doesn’t apply to thicker liquids like oil or syrup."
faqQ2: "How do I measure 200 grams of water without a measuring cup?"
faqA2: "Use a kitchen scale for accuracy, or approximate with household items: 200 grams of water fills a UK teacup just above the rim or about 5/6 of a standard US coffee mug. Tablespoons (13.5) can also work in a pinch."
faqQ3: "Does the cup measurement for 200 grams of water change in UK and US recipes?"
faqA3: "Slightly. A UK cup is 250ml, while a US cup is 240ml, but 200 grams of water converts to approximately 0.85 cups in both. For most air fryer recipes, this minor difference won’t affect results."
faqQ4: "Can I use 200 grams of water for steaming in an air fryer?"
faqA4: "Absolutely! Adding 200 grams of water (about 0.85 cups) to the air fryer basket creates steam for dishes like dumplings or vegetables. Just ensure your air fryer model supports steam functions and avoid overfilling."

<h2>Why Accurate Water Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Using the correct amount of water in air fryer recipes affects texture, cooking time, and overall results. Too much water can make food soggy, while too little may dry it out. For example, when making steamed vegetables or cakes, 200 grams of water in cups (0.85 cups) ensures the right moisture balance. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> simplifies these calculations for all your favourite dishes.</p>  

<p>Air fryers circulate hot air, so liquids evaporate faster than in conventional ovens. This means measuring 200 grams of water accurately is even more critical. Whether you're adapting a family recipe or trying a new dish from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>our collection</a>, precision ensures perfection. Remember, 200g water to cups is a small but vital detail for air fryer success.</p>  

<h3>UK vs. US Cup Measurements for 200 Grams of Water</h3>  
<p>While 200 grams of water converts to roughly 0.85 cups in both UK and US measurements, slight variations exist. A UK cup holds 250ml, whereas a US cup is 240ml. For most air fryer recipes, this difference is negligible, but it’s worth noting for precision baking. If you’re using a recipe from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert category</a>, stick to grams for absolute accuracy.</p>  

<h2>How to Measure 200 Grams of Water Without Scales</h2>  
<p>No kitchen scales? No problem. To measure 200 grams of water in cups, use a liquid measuring jug marked in millilitres. Since 1 gram of water equals 1ml, 200 grams is 200ml—just under a full cup. Alternatively, 16 tablespoons equal 1 cup, so 200 grams of water is roughly 13.5 tablespoons. For more tips, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning and maintenance guides</a> to keep your tools accurate.</p>  

<p>Another handy trick is repurposing standard household items. A standard UK teacup holds about 190ml, so 200 grams of water fills it just slightly above the rim. For US cooks, a standard coffee mug averages 240ml, meaning 200 grams is about 5/6 of the mug. These approximations work in a pinch but invest in scales for consistent air fryer results.</p>  

<h3>Common Recipes Using 200 Grams of Water</h3>

For instance, 200 grams of milk is roughly 0.82 cups due to its higher density. Always check specific conversion charts for non-water liquids when adapting recipes for your air fryer.</p>

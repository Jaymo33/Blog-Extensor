faqQ1: "Is 500 grams of milk the same as 500ml?"
faqA1: "Yes, since milk's density is very close to water, 500 grams of milk is approximately 500ml. This makes conversions between weight and volume straightforward for most recipes, including air fryer dishes."
faqQ2: "Does the fat content of milk affect the conversion from grams to cups?"
faqA2: "Slightly. Whole milk is denser than skimmed milk, but the difference is minimal for most recipes. For precise baking in an air fryer, sticking to the standard 500 grams = ~2.1 cups (UK) or 2.11 cups (US) works well."
faqQ3: "Can I use a regular drinking cup to measure 500 grams of milk?"
faqA3: "It's not recommended, as drinking cups vary in size. For accuracy, use a kitchen scale or a standard liquid measuring cup. This ensures your air fryer recipes turn out as intended."
faqQ4: "How do I adjust recipes if I only have measuring spoons?"
faqA4: "Since 500 grams of milk is roughly 2.1 cups, you'd need about 33 tablespoons (15ml each). However, this is impractical for most recipes. Investing in a measuring jug or scale is better for air fryer cooking."

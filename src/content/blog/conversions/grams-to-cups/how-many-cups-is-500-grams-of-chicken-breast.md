faqQ1: "Does 500 grams of chicken breast weigh the same after cooking?"
faqA1: "No, chicken loses moisture during cooking, reducing its weight by about 25-30%. While 500 grams of raw chicken breast yields roughly 2.5 to 3 cups, cooked chicken will shrink to around 1.75 to 2 cups. Always measure raw chicken for recipe accuracy."
faqQ2: "Can I use frozen chicken breast for this conversion?"
faqA2: "Yes, but frozen chicken may contain extra water, slightly affecting volume. Thaw it first and pat dry before measuring. For best results in the air fryer, use fresh or properly thawed chicken to ensure even cooking and crispiness."
faqQ3: "How many servings does 500 grams of chicken breast provide?"
faqA3: "500 grams of chicken breast typically serves 2-3 people, depending on portion size. For a main course, plan for about 150-200 grams per person. This makes it great for family meals or meal prepping lunches."
faqQ4: "Why does chopped vs. shredded chicken affect cup measurements?"
faqA4: "Smaller pieces pack more tightly, reducing air gaps and increasing density. Shredded chicken fills cups more efficiently than large chunks, so 500 grams may yield closer to 2.5 cups when shredded versus 3 cups when chopped. Adjust recipes accordingly."

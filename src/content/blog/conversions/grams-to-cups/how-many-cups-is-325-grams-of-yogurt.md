<p>325 grams of yogurt is approximately 1.35 cups. This conversion is essential for accurate baking and cooking, especially when using an air fryer. Whether you're making a creamy dessert or a savoury marinade, knowing how to measure yogurt correctly ensures perfect results every time.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Yogurt Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of yogurt can make or break a recipe. Too much yogurt can make dishes overly moist, while too little can leave them dry. For air fryer recipes, precision is key because the cooking process is faster and more intense. A slight miscalculation can affect texture and taste.</p>  
<p>At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we emphasise the importance of accurate measurements. Whether you're making a cake or marinating chicken, 325 grams of yogurt translates to roughly 1.35 cups. This measurement is consistent across most types of yogurt, including Greek and natural varieties.</p>  

<h2>How to Measure 325 Grams of Yogurt in Cups</h2>  
<p>The easiest way to measure yogurt is by using a kitchen scale. However, if you don’t have one, a measuring cup will do. Spoon the yogurt into the cup without packing it down to avoid excess. Level it off with a knife for an accurate reading.</p>  
<p>For those who prefer visual aids, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> provides quick references for common ingredients. Remember, 325 grams of yogurt equals about 1.35 cups, but slight variations may occur depending on the yogurt's thickness.</p>  

<h3>Types of Yogurt and Their Measurements</h3>  
<p>Greek yogurt is denser than regular yogurt, so 325 grams may take up slightly less space. Natural yogurt, on the other hand, is lighter and fluffier. Always check the consistency before measuring to ensure accuracy.</p>  

<h2>Common Recipes Using 325 Grams of Yogurt</h2>  
<p>Yogurt is a versatile ingredient in both sweet and savoury dishes. From marinades to cakes, it adds moisture and richness. For example, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer yogurt cake</a> uses precisely 325 grams for the perfect texture.</p>  
<p>Another popular use is in marinades for chicken or lamb. The acidity in yogurt tenderises meat while keeping it juicy. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipes</a> for inspiration on how to incorporate yogurt into your meals.</p>  

<h3>Tips for Measuring Yogurt Without a Scale</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a scale, use the displacement method. Fill a measuring cup with water to a known level, add yogurt until the water rises by the equivalent volume, and then subtract the water. This method is handy for thick yogurts like Greek or Skyr.</p>  

<h2>Converting Yogurt Measurements for Different Dishes</h2>  
<p>When adapting recipes, it’s crucial to adjust measurements accordingly. For instance, if a recipe calls for 325 grams of yogurt but you’re halving it, you’ll need roughly 0.67 cups. Always double-check conversions to avoid mistakes.</p>

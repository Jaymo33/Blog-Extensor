<h2>Understanding Olive Oil Measurements</h2>
<p>Olive oil density means weight and volume measurements don’t align 1:1. While 175 grams sounds specific, visualising it in cups helps when following recipes.

The standard conversion rate for olive oil is 1 gram = 0.0044 cups, leading to our 0.77 cup measurement for 175g.</p>
<p>Different olive oil types (extra virgin, light, etc.) have nearly identical densities, so this conversion works across varieties. For Mediterranean dishes like those in our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable recipes</a>, getting the 175 grams of olive oil measurement right ensures authentic flavours. Always use liquid measuring cups for accuracy when portioning 175g olive oil.</p>

faqQ1: "Does 400 grams of pasta double in size when cooked?"
faqA1: "Yes, pasta typically doubles in volume when cooked. 400 grams of dry pasta (about 4 cups) will yield roughly 8 cups cooked. This is crucial for air fryer recipes, as overcrowding can affect crispiness."
faqQ2: "How many servings is 400 grams of pasta?"
faqA2: "400 grams of pasta serves 4–6 people as a main dish, or 8–10 as a side. For air fryer meals, divide portions to ensure even cooking. Check our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe hub</a> for serving-size tips."
faqQ3: "Can I cook 400 grams of pasta directly in the air fryer?"
faqA3: "No, pasta needs boiling water to cook properly. Air fryers can't replicate this. Pre-cook your 400 grams of pasta al dente, then use the air fryer for finishing (e.g., baking with sauce or cheese)."
faqQ4: "Why does my air-fried pasta come out dry?"
faqA4: "Dry results usually mean overcooking or insufficient sauce. For 400 grams of pasta, mix with sauce before air frying, and cover with foil for the first 10 minutes. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>pasta dessert hacks</a> also include moisture-retaining tricks."

<p>400 grams of pasta is roughly equivalent to 4 cups when measured uncooked. This conversion can vary slightly depending on the pasta shape, but it's a reliable starting point for most recipes. Whether you're using an air fryer or a traditional oven, getting the measurement right ensures perfectly cooked dishes every time.</p>  

<h2>Understanding Pasta Measurements</h2>  
<p>Measuring pasta by weight (grams) is more accurate than using cups, especially for air fryer recipes where precise portions matter. Different pasta shapes—like penne, spaghetti, or fusilli—can occupy varying volumes even at the same weight. For example, 400 grams of spaghetti will look different in a cup measure compared to 400 grams of macaroni.</p>  
<p>If you're using an air fryer, consistency is key. Too much pasta can lead to uneven cooking, while too little might dry out. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for other common ingredient measurements. This ensures your meals turn out perfectly every time, whether you're cooking for one or a family.</p>  

<h2>UK vs. US Cup Measurements</h2>  
<p>Did you know that a UK cup (250ml) and a US cup (240ml) differ slightly? For 400 grams of pasta, this means the UK measurement might be a tad more generous. However, the difference is minimal—around 4.2 UK cups vs. 4 US cups—so either will work in most recipes.</p>  
<p>If you're following a recipe from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, note whether it uses UK or US measurements. Most UK-based sites, including ours, default to metric weights (grams) for accuracy. But if you're adapting a US recipe, the 4-cup guideline for 400 grams of pasta is a safe bet.</p>  

<h3>Why Weight Beats Volume for Pasta</h3>  
<p>Weight measurements eliminate guesswork. A cup of elbow macaroni won't weigh the same as a cup of farfalle due to air gaps. For air fryer cooking, where space and heat distribution matter, weighing your pasta ensures even results. Invest in a kitchen scale—it's a game-changer for recipes like our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>air fryer chicken pasta bake</a>.</p>  

<h2>Converting 400 Grams of Pasta for Air Fryer Recipes</h2>  
<p>Air fryers excel at cooking pasta dishes like crispy baked ziti or cheesy rigatoni. For 400 grams of pasta, you'll typically need a 5–6 litre air fryer to avoid overcrowding. Overfilling can block airflow, leading to soggy or unevenly cooked results.</p>  
<p>Pre-cook your pasta al dente before air frying, as most models don't submerge food in water. Pair your 400 grams of pasta with sauces or proteins from our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable-based recipes</a> for a balanced meal. And don't forget to grease the basket—our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner guide</a> makes post-cooking cleanup a breeze.</p>  

<h3>Common Pasta Types and Their Cup Equivalents</h3>

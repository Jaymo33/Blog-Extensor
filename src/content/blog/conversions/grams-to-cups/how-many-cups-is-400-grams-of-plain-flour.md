faqA1: "In the UK, 400 grams of plain flour equals roughly 3.2 cups. This is because 1 UK cup of plain flour weighs approximately 125 grams. For precise baking, especially in air fryer recipes, weighing flour is recommended."
faqQ2: "Does the type of flour affect the cup measurement for 400 grams?"

<p>400 grams of plain flour is roughly equivalent to 3.2 cups in the UK and 3.3 cups in the US. Measuring flour by weight ensures accuracy, especially when baking or preparing air fryer recipes. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we emphasise precision for the best results.</p>  

<h2>Why Measuring Flour Accurately Matters</h2>  
<p>Using the correct amount of flour is crucial for achieving the right texture in baked goods. Too much flour can make cakes dense, while too little can cause them to collapse. Air fryer recipes, like those on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes</a>, rely on precise measurements for even cooking.</p>  
<p>Measuring by weight (grams) is more reliable than volume (cups) because flour can settle or be packed differently. A digital kitchen scale ensures consistency, whether you're making bread, cookies, or air-fried treats.</p>  

<h3>UK vs. US Cup Measurements</h3>  
<p>In the UK, 1 cup of plain flour weighs about 125 grams, so 400 grams equals roughly 3.2 cups. In the US, 1 cup is approximately 120 grams, making 400 grams about 3.3 cups. Always check which standard your recipe follows.</p>  

<h2>How to Measure 400 Grams of Plain Flour Without a Scale</h2>  
<p>If you don’t have a scale, fluff the flour with a fork before spooning it into a measuring cup. Level it off with a knife for accuracy. However, for best results, invest in a scale—especially for air fryer baking, where precision matters.</p>

faqQ1: "Can I use blackstrap molasses instead of regular molasses in air fryer recipes?"
faqA1: "Yes, but blackstrap molasses has a stronger, more bitter flavour and is less sweet. Use it sparingly—about ¾ of the amount you’d use for regular molasses. It’s great in savoury dishes but may overpower desserts."
faqQ2: "Why does my air fryer recipe with molasses turn out too sticky?"
faqA2: "Too much molasses can cause excess caramelisation. Stick to the 63-gram measurement for 3 tbsp and ensure even spreading. If needed, reduce cooking time slightly or mix molasses with a bit of oil for better distribution."
faqQ3: "How do I clean molasses residue from my air fryer basket?"
faqA3: "Soak the basket in warm, soapy water to loosen the sticky residue. For stubborn spots, use a soft brush or sponge with baking soda. Avoid harsh scrubbing to protect non-stick coatings."
faqQ4: "Can I substitute honey or maple syrup for molasses in air fryer recipes?"
faqA4: "Yes, but the flavour and texture will differ. Honey is sweeter and thinner, while maple syrup is lighter. Use a 1:1 ratio by weight (not volume) for best results, adjusting other liquids if needed."

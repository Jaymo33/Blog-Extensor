faqQ1: "Can I use 1.5 tbsp of bbq sauce interchangeably with 22.5 grams in air fryer recipes?"
faqA1: "Yes, in most cases 1.5 tbsp of bbq sauce equals approximately 22.5 grams, making them interchangeable in air fryer recipes. However, for absolute precision with thick or thin sauces, weighing is more accurate than volume measurements."

faqA2: "Thicker, chunkier bbq sauces will weigh slightly more than 22.5 grams per 1.5 tbsp, while thinner, smoother varieties may weigh less. The sugar content also affects density - sweeter sauces tend to be heavier for the same volume."
faqQ3: "Why is measuring bbq sauce in grams better for air fryer cooking?"
faqA3: "Measuring in grams provides more consistent results in air fryers because weight isn't affected by how you fill the spoon. Air fryers circulate hot air, so precise sauce quantities prevent sogginess or uneven cooking that volume measurements might cause."

faqA4: "No, different sauces have varying densities. While 1.5 tbsp of bbq sauce is about 22.5 grams, other sauces like ketchup or mayonnaise will have different weights for the same volume. Always check specific conversion charts for each ingredient."

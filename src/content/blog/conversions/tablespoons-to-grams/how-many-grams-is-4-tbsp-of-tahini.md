faqQ1: "Can I use a US tablespoon to measure tahini for UK recipes?"
faqA1: "No, US tablespoons are slightly smaller (14.8ml vs. 15ml UK). For accuracy, use a UK tablespoon or convert grams directly. 4 US tbsp of tahini is about 56 grams, not 60 grams."
faqQ2: "Why does tahini weight vary between brands?"
faqA2: "Tahini’s thickness and oil content differ by brand, affecting density. Always stir well before measuring to ensure consistency. Even so, 4 tbsp tahini should still weigh close to 60 grams."
faqQ3: "How do I store tahini after opening?"
faqA3: "Keep tahini in a sealed jar at room temperature for up to 3 months. Stirring occasionally prevents separation. For longer storage, refrigerate and bring to room temperature before use."
faqQ4: "Can I substitute peanut butter for tahini in air fryer recipes?"
faqA4: "Yes, but the flavour will differ. Use the same weight (60g per 4 tbsp) for consistency. Peanut butter is sweeter, so adjust seasonings accordingly in savoury dishes."

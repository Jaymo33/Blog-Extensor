faqQ1: "Can I use 2 tbsp of yeast instead of weighing it?"
faqA1: "Yes, you can use 2 tbsp of yeast as a substitute for weighing, but for best results, a digital scale is recommended. Tablespoons can vary slightly in volume, especially with ingredients like yeast that may settle or clump."
faqQ2: "Does the type of yeast affect the weight per tablespoon?"
faqA2: "Yes, different types of yeast have slightly different weights. Active dry yeast is lighter than instant yeast, while fresh yeast is much denser. Always check the packaging or use a scale for the most accurate measurement."
faqQ3: "How do I store yeast to keep it fresh?"
faqA3: "Store yeast in an airtight container in the fridge or freezer to extend its shelf life. Avoid exposure to moisture or heat, as this can deactivate the yeast. Always check the expiration date before use."
faqQ4: "Can I use 2 tbsp of yeast in an air fryer recipe?"
faqA4: "Absolutely! Just ensure you’re using the correct weight (around 18g) for consistent results. Air fryer baking often requires precise measurements, so weighing your yeast is ideal for perfect dough every time."

<p>2 tablespoons (tbsp) of yeast equals approximately 18 grams (g). This conversion is essential for precise baking, especially when using an air fryer for recipes like bread or pizza dough. Getting the measurement right ensures your dough rises perfectly every time.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate yeast measurement matters</h2>  
<p>Yeast is a crucial ingredient in baking, and even small variations can affect your results. Too little yeast, and your dough won’t rise properly. Too much, and it might overproof or develop an unpleasant taste. Using grams instead of tablespoons ensures consistency, especially when adapting recipes for your air fryer.

<p>Many UK bakers prefer weighing ingredients for accuracy, as tablespoon sizes can vary slightly. Digital kitchen scales are a great investment for anyone serious about baking. If you’re new to air fryer baking, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipes section</a> has plenty of ideas to get you started.</p>  

<h3>How to measure yeast without a scale</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a scale, spoon the yeast lightly into the tablespoon without packing it down. Level it off with a knife for an accurate 2 tbsp measurement. Remember, 2 tbsp of yeast equals roughly 18 grams, but slight variations can occur depending on the yeast’s density.</p>  

<h2>Types of yeast and their weights</h2>  
<p>Different types of yeast—active dry, instant, or fresh—have slightly different weights per tablespoon. Active dry yeast weighs about 9 grams per 2 tbsp, while instant yeast is closer to 10 grams. Fresh yeast, however, is much heavier, so always check the packaging for specific conversions.</p>  

<p>For air fryer recipes, instant yeast is often preferred because it doesn’t require proofing. If you’re making <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/bread>bread in your air fryer</a>, instant yeast can save time and deliver consistent results. Always store yeast in an airtight container to maintain its potency.</p>  

<h3>Common baking mistakes with yeast</h3>  
<p>One of the biggest mistakes is using old or expired yeast, which won’t activate properly. Another is measuring incorrectly—either scooping too densely or unevenly. For best results, use fresh yeast and measure by weight whenever possible. If you’re unsure, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning guide</a> can help you maintain your tools for accurate measurements.</p>  

<h2>Converting other yeast measurements</h2>  
<p>Need to adjust your recipe? Here’s a quick reference: 1 tbsp of yeast equals about 9 grams, while 1 teaspoon (tsp) is roughly 3 grams. If your recipe calls for a packet of yeast (typically 7g), that’s close to 2.5 tsp or just under 1 tbsp. Always double-check for precision.</p>

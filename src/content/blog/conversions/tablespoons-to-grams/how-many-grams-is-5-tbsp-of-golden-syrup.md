faqQ1: "Can I use honey instead of golden syrup in my air fryer recipe?"
faqA1: "Yes, honey can substitute golden syrup in most recipes, but it has a stronger flavour. Use the same weight (105g for 5 tbsp) and reduce cooking time slightly, as honey caramelises faster. Adjust other sweeteners if needed to balance taste."
faqQ2: "Why does my air fryer recipe need golden syrup in grams, not tablespoons?"
faqA2: "Grams provide precision since syrup can settle or vary in density. Air fryers cook quickly, and exact measurements prevent over- or under-cooking. A kitchen scale ensures consistency, especially for baked goods or glazes where texture matters."
faqQ3: "How do I clean golden syrup from my air fryer basket?"
faqA3: "Soak the basket in warm, soapy water to loosen sticky residue. For stubborn spots, use a soft sponge or our recommended <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning methods</a>. Avoid abrasive scrubbers to protect non-stick coatings."
faqQ4: "Does golden syrup burn easily in the air fryer?"
faqA4: "Yes, due to its high sugar content. To prevent burning, mix syrup with liquids like oil or water, and cook at lower temperatures (160°C or below). Check dishes frequently and stir if needed for even caramelisation."

<p>5 tablespoons (tbsp) of golden syrup equals approximately 105 grams (g). This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements can make or break your dish. Whether you’re whipping up a sticky pudding or glazing roasted vegetables, knowing the exact weight ensures consistency. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we focus on helping you get the best results with accurate conversions.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on even heat distribution, and incorrect ingredient quantities can lead to uneven cooking. Too much golden syrup might cause excessive caramelisation, while too little could leave your dish lacking flavour. Using grams instead of tablespoons removes guesswork, especially since syrup density can vary slightly.

<p>Golden syrup is a staple in British baking, and its thick consistency means volume measurements aren’t always reliable. A digital kitchen scale ensures precision, whether you’re making cakes or marinades. If you’re new to air frying, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a> offers plenty of inspiration with measured ingredients for foolproof results.</p>  

<h3>How to measure golden syrup without a scale</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a scale, levelling off your tablespoons is crucial. Use a straight-edged knife to scrape off excess syrup for an accurate 5 tbsp measurement. Remember, 1 tbsp of golden syrup weighs roughly 21 grams, so 5 tbsp totals around 105 grams. For sticky ingredients like syrup, lightly greasing your spoon can help it slide off easily.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for golden syrup in air fryer recipes</h2>  
<p>Golden syrup adds a rich, caramelised flavour to both sweet and savoury dishes. It’s perfect for glazing <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>air fryer chicken</a> or drizzling over desserts like sticky toffee pudding. Its high sugar content also helps create a crispy exterior on roasted vegetables or <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/potatoes>air fryer potatoes</a>.</p>  

<p>When using golden syrup in marinades, mixing it with acidic ingredients like lemon juice balances the sweetness. For cleaning sticky residue from your air fryer basket, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner guide</a> has handy tips. Always measure syrups carefully to avoid overpowering your dish or creating a mess.</p>  

<h3>Converting other syrup measurements to grams</h3>  
<p>If your recipe calls for a different amount, here’s a quick reference: 1 tbsp = 21g, 2 tbsp = 42g, and 10 tbsp = 210g. These conversions work for most syrups, including maple and agave. For larger batches, weighing ingredients saves time and improves accuracy, especially when scaling up <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>air fryer desserts</a>.</p>

faqQ1: "Can I use melted coconut oil instead of solid for measuring 5 tbsp?"
faqA1: "Yes, you can use melted coconut oil, but it’s best to measure it in its liquid state for accuracy. Pour it into a tablespoon measure until you reach 5 tbsp, which will still equal roughly 68 grams. Solid coconut oil can be packed into the spoon and levelled off."
faqQ2: "Does the type of coconut oil (refined vs. unrefined) affect the weight?"
faqA2: "No, both refined and unrefined coconut oil weigh the same per tablespoon. However, refined coconut oil has a neutral flavour, while unrefined retains a coconut taste, which may influence your recipe’s outcome."
faqQ3: "How do I convert 5 tbsp of coconut oil to grams if my recipe uses metric measurements?"
faqA3: "5 tbsp of coconut oil is approximately 68 grams. If your recipe requires metric measurements, use a kitchen scale for the most precise results, especially for baking in your air fryer."
faqQ4: "Can I substitute butter for coconut oil in an air fryer recipe?"
faqA4: "Yes, but butter burns at lower temperatures than coconut oil. If substituting, reduce the amount slightly (about 1 tbsp less) and monitor cooking time closely to avoid smoking or uneven browning."

<p>5 tablespoons (tbsp) of coconut oil equals approximately 68 grams (g). This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precision matters, ensuring your dishes cook evenly and taste perfect every time. Whether you’re making crispy roasted vegetables or a decadent air-fried dessert, knowing the exact weight of coconut oil helps avoid guesswork.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of coconut oil can make or break your air fryer recipes. Too little, and your food might stick or dry out; too much, and it could become greasy. For example, when making air-fried chicken or crispy potatoes, 5 tbsp of coconut oil (68g) provides just enough fat for a golden, crunchy finish without overwhelming the dish.

<p>Coconut oil is a popular choice for air frying because of its high smoke point and subtle flavour. Unlike butter, which burns easily, coconut oil remains stable at higher temperatures, making it ideal for air fryer cooking. Whether you’re preparing a savoury <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipe</a> or a sweet treat, measuring it correctly ensures consistent results.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure Coconut Oil for Air Fryer Recipes</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a kitchen scale, you can still measure 5 tbsp of coconut oil accurately. Solid coconut oil can be scooped and levelled with a spoon, while melted coconut oil should be poured into a measuring spoon. For best results, we recommend using grams for precision, especially when baking air fryer cakes or cookies where ratios are crucial.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for 5 Tbsp of Coconut Oil in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>From roasting vegetables to frying fish, 5 tbsp of coconut oil (68g) is a versatile quantity. For instance, tossing potatoes in this amount ensures they crisp up beautifully without sticking to the basket. It’s also perfect for coating <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/shrimp>shrimp</a> or tofu before air frying, giving them a deliciously crispy exterior.</p>

faqQ1: "Can I use 0.5 tbsp of sesame oil for air frying chicken?"
faqA1: "Absolutely! 0.5 tbsp (6.5g) of sesame oil is ideal for coating chicken before air frying. It adds flavour without making the dish greasy. Mix it with soy sauce and garlic for a perfect marinade."
faqQ2: "How does 0.5 tbsp of sesame oil compare to other oils in grams?"
faqA2: "Sesame oil is denser than some oils. While 0.5 tbsp sesame oil weighs 6.5g, the same volume of olive oil is about 6g. Always check specific oil densities for precise conversions in recipes."
faqQ3: "Why is my 0.5 tbsp sesame oil measurement inconsistent?"
faqA3: "Inconsistencies often come from uneven pouring or using different spoon types. For accuracy, use a levelled measuring spoon or digital scale. Sticky oils like sesame can cling to utensils, affecting amounts."
faqQ4: "Can I substitute toasted sesame oil for regular in 0.5 tbsp amounts?"
faqA4: "Yes, but toasted sesame oil has a stronger flavour. Use slightly less (about 0.4 tbsp) if substituting in recipes. Both types weigh the same (6.5g per 0.5 tbsp), but intensity differs."

<h2>Why accurate sesame oil measurements matter</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of sesame oil in your air fryer can make or break a dish. Too little, and your food lacks depth; too much, and it becomes greasy. Sesame oil has a strong flavour, so 0.5 tbsp (6.5g) is often enough for marinades or dressings. Many <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> call for small quantities to enhance taste without overpowering. Always measure carefully to achieve restaurant-quality results at home.</p>  

<p>For those who love Asian-inspired dishes, sesame oil is a staple. A precise 0.5 tbsp (6.5g) can elevate stir-fried vegetables or glazed chicken wings. If you’re experimenting with new flavours, start with this amount and adjust to taste. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipe category</a> features plenty of ideas to put your measurement skills to use.</p>  

<h2>How to measure 0.5 tbsp sesame oil correctly</h2>  
<p>Measuring small amounts like 0.5 tbsp can be tricky without the right tools. Use a graduated measuring spoon or a digital kitchen scale for accuracy. Pour slowly to avoid spills, especially when working with sticky oils like sesame. If you don’t have a 0.5 tbsp measure, half a standard UK tablespoon (15ml) will do.

<h3>Converting other sesame oil quantities</h3>  
<p>If your recipe calls for larger amounts, here’s a quick reference: 1 tbsp sesame oil = 13g, while 1 tsp equals about 4.3g. These conversions are handy when scaling recipes up or down.

<h2>Sesame oil substitutes in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>If you’re out of sesame oil, try peanut or avocado oil at a 1:1 ratio—though flavours will differ. For lighter dishes, a 0.5 tbsp (6.5g) drizzle of olive oil works too. Remember, sesame oil’s nutty taste is unique, so substitutes may alter your dish’s profile. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable recipes</a> showcase how different oils affect outcomes.</p>  

<h3>Storing sesame oil for freshness</h3>  
<p>To preserve sesame oil’s quality, keep it in a cool, dark place. Once opened, use within 6 months for best flavour. Rancid oil can ruin even perfectly measured 0.5 tbsp portions. For long-term storage, refrigerate and bring to room temperature before use.</p>

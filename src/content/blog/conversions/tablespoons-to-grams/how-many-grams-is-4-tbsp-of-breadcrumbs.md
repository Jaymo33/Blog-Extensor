faqQ1: "How do I measure 4 tbsp of breadcrumbs without a scale?"
faqA1: "Use a standard tablespoon and lightly spoon the breadcrumbs into it, then level off the excess with a knife. This method avoids compacting the crumbs, giving you a close approximation to 28 grams. For best results, consider investing in a kitchen scale for precision."
faqQ2: "Can I use panko breadcrumbs instead of regular breadcrumbs for this measurement?"
faqA2: "Yes, but panko breadcrumbs are lighter and flakier, so 4 tbsp may weigh slightly less—around 25 grams. Adjust accordingly if your recipe relies on precise weights for texture."
faqQ3: "Why do some recipes list breadcrumbs in grams instead of tablespoons?"
faqA3: "Grams provide a more accurate measurement, especially for baking or air frying, where consistency is crucial. Volume measurements (like tbsp) can vary based on how the ingredient is packed."
faqQ4: "How many grams are in a cup of breadcrumbs?"
faqA4: "One cup of breadcrumbs typically weighs about 100 grams. This is useful for larger recipes, like meatloaf or casseroles, where you need bulk quantities. Always check your recipe for specific requirements."

<p>4 tablespoons (tbsp) of breadcrumbs weigh approximately 28 grams. This measurement is essential for air fryer recipes, ensuring your coatings and toppings are perfectly portioned. Whether you're making crispy chicken or a golden fish fillet, knowing the exact weight helps achieve consistent results every time.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Precision is key when using an air fryer, as uneven coatings can lead to undercooked or burnt spots.

<p>Many recipes, especially those for air fryers, list ingredients by weight for accuracy. If you’re adapting a recipe from volume (tbsp) to grams, this conversion is a game-changer.

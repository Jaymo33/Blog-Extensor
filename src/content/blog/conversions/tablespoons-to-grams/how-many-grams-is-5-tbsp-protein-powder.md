faqQ1: "Does the type of protein powder affect how many grams are in 5 tablespoons?"
faqA1: "Yes, different types of protein powder can vary in weight. Whey protein tends to be lighter and fluffier, so 5 tbsp might weigh around 35-38 grams. Casein and plant-based proteins are often denser, potentially making 5 tbsp closer to 42-45 grams. Always check your specific product's nutritional information for the most accurate conversion."
faqQ2: "Can I use a regular spoon instead of a proper tablespoon measure?"
faqA2: "While you can use a regular eating spoon in a pinch, it won't give you an accurate measurement. Standard UK tablespoons hold 15ml, while eating spoons vary significantly. For precise conversions of 5 tbsp protein powder to grams, it's best to use proper measuring spoons or better yet, weigh it directly on scales."
faqQ3: "Why do some recipes use grams instead of tablespoons for protein powder?"
faqA3: "Recipes often specify grams because weight measurements are more precise than volume measurements. Protein powder can settle or become compacted in its container, making tablespoon measures inconsistent. Grams ensure everyone uses exactly the same amount, which is especially important in baking recipes for air fryers where precision affects texture."
faqQ4: "How should I store protein powder to maintain consistent measurements?"
faqA4: "Keep protein powder in an airtight container in a cool, dry place to prevent moisture absorption which can make it clump and become denser. Give the container a gentle shake before measuring to aerate the powder. This helps maintain consistent density when converting 5 tbsp protein powder to grams for your air fryer recipes."

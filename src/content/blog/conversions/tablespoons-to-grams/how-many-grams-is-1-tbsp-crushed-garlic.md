faqQ1: "Can I use minced garlic instead of crushed garlic in air fryer recipes?"
faqA1: "Yes, minced garlic can substitute for crushed garlic, but the texture and flavour intensity may vary slightly. Minced garlic is finer, so 1 tbsp weighs around 8 grams—slightly less than crushed. Adjust quantities based on your taste preference."
faqQ2: "How do I convert whole garlic cloves to crushed garlic for air frying?"
faqA2: "One medium garlic clove yields about 1 tsp (3 grams) of crushed garlic. For 1 tbsp (9 grams), you’ll need roughly 3 cloves. Crush them with a press or finely chop for consistent results in air fryer recipes."
faqQ3: "Does the brand of crushed garlic affect the weight per tablespoon?"
faqA3: "Yes, pre-packaged crushed garlic may vary in moisture content, affecting weight. Freshly crushed garlic is denser, so always weigh it for accuracy. Check labels if using store-bought varieties for precise measurements."
faqQ4: "Can I freeze crushed garlic for later use in air fryer meals?"
faqA4: "Absolutely! Freeze crushed garlic in 1-tbsp portions (about 9 grams) for convenience. Add a bit of oil to prevent freezer burn, then thaw as needed. This works perfectly for quick air fryer marinades or sauces."

Always level off the spoon for consistency, especially when following recipes from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>.</p>

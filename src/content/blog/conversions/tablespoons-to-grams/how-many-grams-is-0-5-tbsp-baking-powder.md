faqQ1: "Is 0.5 tbsp of baking powder the same as 1 tsp?"
faqA1: "No, 0.5 tbsp equals 1.5 tsp. Tablespoons and teaspoons measure different volumes, so it’s important to use the correct measuring spoon. For baking powder, 0.5 tbsp (7g) provides more leavening power than 1 tsp (about 4.6g)."
faqQ2: "Can I use grams instead of tablespoons for baking powder in air fryer recipes?"
faqA2: "Absolutely! Grams provide more accuracy than volume measurements like tablespoons. Most professional air fryer recipes list baking powder in grams for consistency. Always use a digital scale for best results."
faqQ3: "Why does my air fryer cake taste bitter with 0.5 tbsp baking powder?"
faqA3: "Bitterness usually means too much baking powder was used. Ensure you’re measuring precisely—7g for 0.5 tbsp. Also check your baking powder isn’t expired, as old product can develop an off taste."
faqQ4: "How do I convert grams back to tablespoons if my recipe uses weight?"
faqA4: "To convert 7g baking powder back to tablespoons, it’s roughly 0.5 tbsp. However, for small amounts like this, weighing is more reliable. Keep a conversion chart or calculator handy for quick reference."

<p>0.5 tbsp of baking powder equals approximately 7 grams. This conversion is essential for air fryer baking, where precision ensures the perfect rise and texture. Whether you’re whipping up cakes, muffins, or even savoury dishes, knowing the exact weight of 0.5 tbsp baking powder in grams eliminates guesswork.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer baking</h2>  
<p>Baking powder is a leavening agent, and even small discrepancies can affect your air fryer recipes. Too much can leave a bitter taste, while too little may result in dense, flat bakes. For consistent results, always measure 0.5 tbsp of baking powder as 7 grams. This precision is especially crucial for air fryer cakes and batters, where heat distribution differs from conventional ovens.</p>

<h3>How to measure 0.5 tbsp baking powder accurately</h3>  
<p>For the most precise measurement, use a digital kitchen scale. Scoop the baking powder into a tablespoon, level it off, then weigh half of it (7 grams). Alternatively, use a measuring spoon set with a ½ tbsp marker. Avoid packing the powder down, as this can lead to over-measuring.</p>  

<h2>Common recipes using 0.5 tbsp baking powder</h2>

<h3>UK vs. US tablespoon measurements</h3>

<h2>Storing baking powder for optimal results</h2>

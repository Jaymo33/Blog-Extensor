faqQ1: "Can I use dried onions instead of fresh for 4 tbsp measurements?"
faqA1: "Yes, but dried onions are more concentrated. Use 4 tsp (about 12g) of dried onion to replace 4 tbsp (40g) fresh. Rehydrate them in water first for better texture in air fryer dishes."
faqQ2: "Does the type of onion affect the weight for 4 tbsp?"
faqA2: "Slightly. Red and white onions have similar densities, but sweeter varieties like Vidalia may weigh less due to higher water content. For accuracy, weigh after chopping."
faqQ3: "How do I store leftover chopped onion after measuring 4 tbsp?"
faqA3: "Keep unused onion in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 3 days. For longer storage, freeze pre-portioned 40g batches—they’ll stay fresh for months."
faqQ4: "Why does my air fryer recipe specify grams instead of tablespoons for onion?"
faqA4: "Grams ensure consistency, especially in baked or coated dishes where moisture content matters. Tablespoons can vary based on chop size, while weight is precise. Always opt for grams when possible."

<p>4 tablespoons (tbsp) of chopped onion weigh approximately 40 grams. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements ensure even cooking and perfect results. Whether you’re making crispy onion toppings or adding flavour to dishes, knowing the weight helps streamline your prep.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate onion measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Using the correct amount of onion ensures your air fryer dishes have balanced flavours and textures. Too much onion can overpower a dish, while too little might leave it bland. For recipes like air-fried onion rings or stir-fries, 4 tbsp (40g) is a common measurement. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more handy tips.</p>  

<p>Onions vary in density depending on how finely they’re chopped. A rough chop may weigh slightly less than finely diced onion, but 4 tbsp generally averages around 40g. For consistent results, use a kitchen scale if possible. Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable recipes</a> for inspiration on using onions in your air fryer.</p>  

<h3>How to measure 4 tbsp of onion without a scale</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a scale, fill a tablespoon loosely with chopped onion and level it off. Repeat four times for an approximate 40g measure. For recipes requiring exact weights, like air-fried fritters or stuffed peppers, weighing is best. Visit <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> for more measurement guides.</p>  

<h2>Common recipes using 4 tbsp (40g) of onion</h2>  
<p>Many air fryer dishes call for this amount, such as savoury muffins, stuffed mushrooms, or homemade seasoning blends. Onions add depth to marinades and coatings, especially in <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> like kebabs or roasted veggies. Their natural sweetness caramelises beautifully in the air fryer.</p>  

<p>For meal preppers, pre-measuring 4 tbsp portions saves time. Try freezing chopped onions in 40g batches for quick use later. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/meal-prep>meal prep section</a> has great tips for efficient cooking. Remember, keeping your air fryer clean ensures even heat distribution—check our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning guide</a> for best practices.</p>  

<h3>Adjusting onion quantities for different dishes</h3>  
<p>Some recipes may need more or less onion depending on taste. Start with 4 tbsp (40g) and adjust as needed. For stronger flavours, red onions work well, while milder white onions suit subtle dishes. Experiment to find your perfect balance.</p>

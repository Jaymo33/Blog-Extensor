faqQ1: "Can I use granulated sugar instead of caster sugar for air fryer recipes?"
faqA1: "Yes, but granulated sugar has larger crystals which may not dissolve as quickly in air fryer recipes. If substituting, you can pulse granulated sugar in a blender briefly to make it finer. The weight conversion remains the same—2.5 tbsp equals 31.25 grams regardless of sugar type."
faqQ2: "Why does my air fryer recipe need such precise sugar measurements?"
faqA2: "Air fryers cook food faster and more intensely than conventional ovens, so small measurement differences can significantly affect results. Too much sugar may cause burning, while too little can leave baked goods dry. The 2.5 tbsp (31.25g) measurement ensures balanced sweetness and texture."
faqQ3: "How do I convert 2.5 tbsp caster sugar to cups?"
faqA3: "2.5 tablespoons of caster sugar equals about 1/8 cup (exactly 0.15625 cups). However, for air fryer recipes, we recommend weighing ingredients in grams for greater accuracy, as cup measurements can vary based on how the sugar is packed."
faqQ4: "Does the brand of caster sugar affect the 2.5 tbsp to grams conversion?"
faqA4: "No, all UK caster sugars have similar density, so 2.5 tablespoons will always be approximately 31.25 grams. However, if your sugar has clumped, it may measure differently by volume, which is why weighing is more reliable for air fryer baking."

<h3>How to measure 2.5 tbsp of caster sugar</h3>  
<p>For the most accurate results, use digital kitchen scales to weigh out 31.25 grams of caster sugar.

<h2>Common uses for 2.5 tbsp caster sugar</h2>  
<p>This quantity of sugar is perfect for small-batch air fryer desserts like mug cakes, shortbread, or fruit crumbles. It’s also useful for sweetening whipped cream or yoghurt toppings.

faqQ1: "Can I use dairy milk instead of almond milk in air fryer recipes?"

faqQ3: "How do I store leftover almond milk for air fryer cooking?"
faqA3: "Store opened almond milk in the fridge for up to 7 days. Shake well before use, as separation is normal. For longer storage, freeze it in ice cube trays and thaw as needed for recipes."
faqQ4: "Is almond milk suitable for all air fryer recipes?"

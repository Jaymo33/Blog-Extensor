faqQ1: "Does the type of plain yogurt affect the weight per tablespoon?"
faqA1: "Yes, the weight can vary slightly depending on the yogurt's thickness. Regular plain yogurt typically weighs 15g per tbsp, while Greek yogurt (being denser) may weigh 18-20g. Always check your specific product's consistency for best results."
faqQ2: "Can I use milliliters instead of grams for measuring yogurt?"
faqA2: "While possible, it's less accurate. 1 tbsp of yogurt is approximately 15ml, but weight (grams) is more reliable because yogurt's density varies. For air fryer recipes where precision matters, grams are recommended."
faqQ3: "How do I convert cups of plain yogurt to grams?"
faqA3: "1 cup of plain yogurt is about 240 grams. For smaller quantities, 1/4 cup equals 60g, and 1/2 cup is 120g. These conversions are useful when scaling up recipes from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> for larger batches."
faqQ4: "Why do some recipes specify grams instead of tablespoons for yogurt?"
faqA4: "Weight measurements (grams) are more precise because tablespoon measurements can vary based on how the yogurt is scooped. Grams ensure consistency, especially important in air fryer baking where exact ratios affect texture and rise."

<p>1 tablespoon (tbsp) of plain yogurt weighs approximately 15 grams. This measurement is standard for UK recipes, ensuring accuracy whether you're baking, cooking, or preparing dips for your air fryer. Knowing the exact weight helps maintain consistency, especially when following recipes from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> or adjusting portion sizes.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate yogurt measurements matter</h2>  
<p>Using the correct amount of plain yogurt can make or break a recipe. Too much can make batters runny, while too little might dry out dishes like air-fried cakes or marinades. For example, a <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>yogurt-based marinade</a> for chicken needs precise measurements to ensure even coating and flavour. A 15-gram tablespoon ensures you get it right every time.</p>  

<p>Many air fryer recipes, especially those involving baking, rely on yogurt for moisture and texture. If you're making <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>air fryer cakes</a>, even a small deviation in yogurt quantity can affect the rise and crumb. Measuring by weight (grams) is more reliable than volume (tablespoons) because it accounts for density variations.</p>  

<h3>How to measure 1 tbsp plain yogurt accurately</h3>  
<p>For the most precise measurement, use a digital kitchen scale. Scoop the yogurt into a tablespoon, level it off with a knife, and weigh it. If you don't have scales, fill the spoon evenly without packing it down. Strained or Greek yogurt may weigh slightly more per tablespoon due to reduced water content.</p>  

<h2>Converting other yogurt quantities to grams</h2>  
<p>If a recipe calls for larger amounts, here's a quick reference: 1 teaspoon (tsp) is about 5 grams, 2 tbsp equal 30 grams, and 1/4 cup roughly translates to 60 grams. These conversions are handy for scaling up <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer recipes</a> or adjusting serving sizes.</p>  

<p>For batch cooking or meal prep, knowing these conversions saves time. If you're preparing a <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/meal-prep>yogurt-based sauce</a> for multiple portions, calculating in grams ensures uniform flavour and consistency across servings. This is particularly useful for air fryer dishes where even cooking is key.</p>  

<h3>Common mistakes when measuring yogurt</h3>  
<p>One frequent error is using heaped tablespoons, which can add up to 20 grams instead of 15. Another is not stirring the yogurt first, leading to inconsistent measurements due to separation. Always give it a quick mix before scooping for reliable results in your air fryer creations.</p>

faqQ1: "Can I use minced garlic instead of crushed for 0.75 tbsp?"
faqA1: "Yes, but minced garlic is denser, so the weight may differ slightly. For 0.75 tbsp, expect about 10 grams instead of 11.25 grams. Adjust to taste, especially in air fryer recipes where flavours intensify."
faqQ2: "How do I measure 0.75 tbsp of crushed garlic without a spoon?"
faqA2: "If you lack measuring spoons, estimate using a standard UK teaspoon (3 tsp = 1 tbsp). Measure 2¼ tsp for 0.75 tbsp. For accuracy, weigh it—11.25 grams—on a kitchen scale."
faqQ3: "Does the type of garlic affect the weight conversion?"
faqA3: "Freshness and clove size can cause minor variations, but the difference is negligible for home cooking. Store-bought pre-crushed garlic may have added preservatives, slightly altering density."
faqQ4: "Can I substitute garlic powder for 0.75 tbsp crushed garlic?"
faqA4: "Yes, but use ¼ tsp garlic powder per 0.75 tbsp crushed garlic, as powders are more concentrated. Rehydrate it with a bit of water to mimic fresh garlic’s texture in air fryer dishes."

<p>0.75 tbsp of crushed garlic equals approximately 11.25 grams. This conversion is essential for precision in cooking, especially when using an air fryer where ingredient ratios can impact texture and flavour. Whether you're following a recipe from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> or improvising, knowing exact measurements ensures consistent results.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate garlic measurements matter</h2>  
<p>Garlic is a powerhouse of flavour, and even small variations in quantity can alter a dish’s taste. Too much can overpower, while too little might leave your meal bland. For air fryer cooking, where heat circulates intensely, precise measurements prevent burning or uneven seasoning. Recipes like those found on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>airfryerrecipe.co.uk’s chicken section</a> often rely on balanced garlic quantities for marinades or rubs.</p>  

<p>Crushed garlic, unlike minced or whole cloves, has a unique density. Its texture affects how it integrates into dishes, making weight-based measurements more reliable than volume. If you’re scaling a recipe, converting 0.75 tbsp of crushed garlic to grams (11.25g) eliminates guesswork.</p>  

<h3>Tools for measuring crushed garlic</h3>  
<p>A digital kitchen scale is the most accurate tool for converting tablespoons to grams. If you don’t have one, refer to a conversion chart like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>our air fryer conversion guide</a>. For 0.75 tbsp, lightly pack the garlic into the spoon without compressing it too tightly, as this can skew the weight.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for 0.75 tbsp crushed garlic</h2>  
<p>This quantity is ideal for small-batch recipes, such as air-fried vegetables or single-serving proteins. For example, tossing broccoli or green beans with 11.25 grams of crushed garlic, olive oil, and salt before air frying elevates their flavour. Check out <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable recipes</a> for inspiration.</p>  

<p>It’s also perfect for marinades. Combine 0.75 tbsp (11.25g) of crushed garlic with lemon juice, herbs, and a splash of oil to coat chicken or tofu. The air fryer’s rapid cooking locks in these flavours beautifully.</p>  

<h3>Adjusting for personal taste</h3>  
<p>If you prefer milder garlic notes, reduce the amount slightly—try 0.5 tbsp (7.5g). For bolder flavours, increase to 1 tbsp (15g). Remember that air frying concentrates tastes, so start conservatively.

<h2>Storing leftover crushed garlic</h2>  
<p>If your recipe calls for 0.75 tbsp but you’ve prepared extra, store it in an airtight container in the fridge for up to a week. Alternatively, freeze pre-measured portions in ice cube trays for future use. This saves time and reduces waste, aligning with efficient meal prep.</p>  

<p>For longer storage, mix crushed garlic with olive oil before freezing. Note that oil-infused garlic should be used within a month to avoid spoilage. Always label containers with weights (e.g., “11.25g per portion”) for easy reference.</p>

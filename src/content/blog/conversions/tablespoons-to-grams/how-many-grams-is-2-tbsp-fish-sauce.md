faqQ1: "Can I use less than 2 tbsp of fish sauce in my air fryer recipe?"
faqA1: "Yes, you can adjust the amount to suit your taste. If reducing, start with 1 tbsp (15g) and taste before adding more. Remember, air fryers concentrate flavours, so a little often goes further than in oven cooking."
faqQ2: "Does the brand of fish sauce affect the weight per tablespoon?"
faqA2: "Most fish sauces have similar densities, so 2 tbsp will generally weigh around 30g across brands. However, thicker artisanal varieties might be slightly heavier. When trying a new brand, it’s worth checking with scales initially."
faqQ3: "How do I convert grams back to tablespoons if my recipe uses weight?"
faqA3: "For fish sauce, 30g equals 2 tbsp. So if a recipe lists 45g, you’d use 3 tbsp. Always use level tablespoons for accuracy, and consider investing in measuring spoons if you frequently work with volume measurements."
faqQ4: "Can I substitute fish sauce with something else in air fryer recipes?"
faqA4: "Soy sauce or Worcestershire sauce can work as substitutes, but they’ll change the flavour profile. Use the same 2 tbsp (30g) quantity initially, then adjust to taste. For authentic Southeast Asian flavours, fish sauce is irreplaceable."

<p>2 tablespoons (tbsp) of fish sauce weigh approximately 30 grams (g). This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes, ensuring precise measurements for marinades, dressings, or dipping sauces. Whether you're following a recipe from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> or experimenting with your own creations, knowing this conversion helps maintain consistency.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate fish sauce measurements matter</h2>  
<p>Fish sauce is a potent ingredient, and even small variations can significantly alter the flavour of your dish. Too much can overpower, while too little may leave your meal tasting bland. For air fryer cooking, where sauces and marinades play a crucial role, getting the measurement right ensures balanced flavours. If you're working with recipes like those in our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipes section</a>, precise conversions are key.</p>  

<p>Many UK cooks prefer weighing ingredients for accuracy, especially when scaling recipes up or down. Fish sauce’s density means volume measurements (like tablespoons) can vary slightly, but 30g per 2 tbsp is a reliable standard. This consistency is particularly useful for meal preppers or those batch-cooking in their air fryer.</p>  

<h2>Converting fish sauce for air fryer recipes</h2>  
<p>When adapting recipes for your air fryer, converting tablespoons to grams ensures you don’t over-season proteins or vegetables. For example, if a recipe calls for 2 tbsp of fish sauce (30g), but you prefer weighing ingredients, this conversion simplifies the process. Check our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for other common ingredient conversions.</p>  

<h3>How to measure fish sauce without scales</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have kitchen scales, use a standard UK tablespoon (15ml) for accuracy. Fill it level with the rim—no heaping—for consistent results. Two level tablespoons will give you roughly 30g of fish sauce. For sticky sauces like this, lightly greasing the spoon can help it slide off easily.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for fish sauce in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Fish sauce adds umami depth to marinades for chicken, shrimp, or tofu in the air fryer. A mix of 2 tbsp (30g) fish sauce, lime juice, and garlic makes a fantastic base for <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>air fryer chicken wings</a>. It’s also great in dressings for air-fried vegetable bowls or as a seasoning for crispy tofu.</p>  

<p>Because air fryers intensify flavours, a little fish sauce goes a long way. Start with 2 tbsp (30g) in a marinade for 500g of protein, adjusting to taste.

<h3>Storing fish sauce for freshness</h3>  
<p>To maintain quality, keep fish sauce in a cool, dark place after opening. Proper storage ensures your 2 tbsp (30g) measurements remain consistent in flavour over time. If you notice any off smells or discoloration, it’s time to replace the bottle—check our guide on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>keeping your air fryer fresh</a> alongside your ingredients.</p>

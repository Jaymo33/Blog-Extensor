faqQ1: "Can I use granulated sugar instead of caster sugar for 4 tbsp in grams?"
faqA1: "Yes, but granulated sugar is slightly heavier—about 56g for 4 tbsp compared to caster sugar’s 50g. Adjust your recipe accordingly to avoid over-sweetening or texture changes."
faqQ2: "Why does caster sugar weigh less than granulated sugar per tablespoon?"
faqA2: "Caster sugar has finer granules, so it packs less densely into a tablespoon. Granulated sugar’s larger crystals take up more space, making it weigh more for the same volume."
faqQ3: "How do I measure 4 tbsp of caster sugar without a scale?"
faqA3: "Use a proper measuring spoon and lightly fill it without packing. Level off the top with a knife for accuracy. Four level tablespoons should give you roughly 50g."
faqQ4: "Does 4 tbsp of caster sugar convert the same in all countries?"
faqA4: "UK tablespoons are standardized (15ml), but always check your measuring spoons. In the US, 1 tbsp is 14.2ml, which could slightly alter the weight—roughly 48g for 4 tbsp."

Too much sugar can lead to over-browning, while too little might leave your bake dry.</p>

<h2>Tips for baking with caster sugar in an air fryer</h2>  
<p>Air fryers circulate hot air, which can cause sugar-heavy recipes to brown faster. To prevent burning, reduce the temperature slightly or check your bake a few minutes early. Using 50g (4 tbsp) of caster sugar in smaller batches ensures even cooking. For sticky bakes like flapjacks, lining your air fryer basket with parchment paper helps with easy removal and cleanup.</p>  

<p>Keeping your air fryer clean is just as important as accurate measurements. Sugar residues can caramelize and stick, so regular wiping with a <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>suitable cleaner</a> maintains performance. Whether you're baking or reheating, a well-maintained air fryer ensures consistent results every time.</p>

faqQ1: "Can I use bottled lemon juice instead of fresh for air fryer recipes?"
faqA1: "Yes, bottled lemon juice can be used, but fresh lemon juice often has a brighter, more vibrant flavour. If substituting, ensure the bottled version is pure lemon juice without added sugars or preservatives, as these can affect cooking results."
faqQ2: "How do I adjust lemon juice measurements for larger batches?"
faqA2: "Simply multiply the grams per tablespoon by the number of tablespoons needed. For example, 8 tbsp of lemon juice would be 120g. Always use a scale for accuracy, especially when scaling up recipes for family meals or meal prep."
faqQ3: "Does lemon juice affect cooking times in an air fryer?"
faqA3: "Lemon juice can slightly reduce cooking times in marinades by tenderising proteins. However, it won’t drastically change air fryer timings. For best results, follow recipe guidelines and check food doneness with a thermometer."
faqQ4: "What’s the best way to store leftover lemon juice?"
faqA4: "Store fresh lemon juice in an airtight container in the fridge for up to a week. For longer storage, freeze it in ice cube trays—each cube is roughly 1 tbsp (15g), making future measurements a breeze."

<p>4 tablespoons (tbsp) of lemon juice weigh approximately 60 grams (g). This conversion is essential for precise cooking, especially when using an air fryer, where accurate measurements can make or break a recipe. Whether you're preparing a marinade, dressing, or dessert, knowing the exact weight ensures consistency. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we help you nail every detail, from conversions to perfect cooking times.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on precise ingredient ratios to deliver crispy, evenly cooked results. Too much or too little lemon juice can alter the texture and flavour of your dish. For example, a marinade with excess liquid might make chicken soggy, while too little could leave it dry. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> simplifies these calculations, so you never have to guess.</p>  

<p>Lemon juice is a common ingredient in air fryer recipes, from tangy glazes to citrusy desserts. Knowing that 4 tbsp equals 60 grams helps you follow recipes accurately, whether you're scaling up or down.

<h3>How to measure lemon juice correctly</h3>  
<p>For the most accurate results, use a digital kitchen scale to weigh lemon juice directly. If you don't have one, a standard UK tablespoon holds about 15 millilitres (ml) of liquid, which roughly translates to 15 grams for lemon juice. However, slight variations can occur depending on the juiciness of the lemons.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for 4 tbsp of lemon juice in air fryer recipes</h2>  
<p>Four tablespoons of lemon juice (60g) can transform your air fryer dishes. It's perfect for marinating chicken, adding zest to roasted vegetables, or creating a light citrus drizzle for desserts.

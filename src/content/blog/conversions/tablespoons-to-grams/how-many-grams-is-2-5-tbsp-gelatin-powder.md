faqQ1: "Can I use gelatin sheets instead of powder for 2.5 tbsp?"
faqA1: "Yes, but the conversion differs. One tablespoon of powdered gelatin equals about 3 sheets. For 2.5 tbsp powder (21g), you’d need roughly 7-8 sheets. Always check your packet instructions, as sheet sizes vary by brand."
faqQ2: "Why does my air fryer gelatin dessert turn out rubbery?"
faqA2: "This usually means you’ve used too much gelatin. Stick to the 2.5 tbsp (21g) measurement precisely. Also, avoid overcooking—gelatin sets as it cools, so remove your dessert from the air fryer once heated through."
faqQ3: "How long does gelatin take to set in the air fryer?"
faqA3: "Gelatin needs refrigeration to set, not the air fryer. After preparing your mixture, pour it into moulds and chill for at least 4 hours. The air fryer is only used for heating the liquid initially."
faqQ4: "Can I halve a recipe that uses 2.5 tbsp gelatin powder?"
faqA4: "Absolutely! Halving 2.5 tbsp gives 1.25 tbsp (about 10.5g). Use a digital scale for accuracy. Smaller quantities may set faster, so reduce chilling time slightly. Always adjust other ingredients proportionally too."

<p>Many UK recipes use grams for precision, so knowing how to convert tablespoons is a game-changer. Whether you're following a recipe from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> or adapting a family favourite, accurate measurements ensure success. Gelatin’s setting power depends on exact quantities, so don’t leave it to guesswork.</p>  

<h3>How to measure gelatin powder correctly</h3>  
<p>For the most accurate results, use a digital kitchen scale to weigh 21 grams of gelatin powder. If you don’t have one, lightly spoon the powder into a tablespoon and level it off—no packing or tapping. This method helps avoid over-measuring, which is common with powdery ingredients.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for 2.5 tbsp gelatin powder</h2>

<p>Many air fryer recipes, especially those for breaded items, rely on precise ratios to balance moisture and crispiness. If you’re working with smaller quantities, such as 0.75 tbsp of breadcrumbs, converting to grams eliminates measuring errors.

<h2>How to Measure 0.75 tbsp of Breadcrumbs Without a Scale</h2>
<p>If you don’t have a kitchen scale, you can still measure 0.75 tbsp of breadcrumbs accurately. Use a standard UK tablespoon and fill it three-quarters full, leveling off the top with a knife.

Always adjust based on the type specified in your recipe for the best results.</p>

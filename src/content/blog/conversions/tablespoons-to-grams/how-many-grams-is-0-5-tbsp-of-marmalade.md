faqQ1: "Can I use 0.5 tbsp of marmalade instead of 10g in recipes?"
faqA1: "Yes, 0.5 tbsp of marmalade equals roughly 10g, so they’re interchangeable in most recipes. For baked goods where precision matters, weighing is best as marmalade density can vary slightly between brands."
faqQ2: "How do I measure 0.5 tbsp of marmalade without a tablespoon?"
faqA2: "Use a teaspoon: 1.5 tsp equals 0.5 tbsp (10g). Alternatively, eyeball half of a standard UK 15ml medicine cap, which holds about 1 tbsp. For sticky ingredients, a silicone spatula helps scrape every bit."
faqQ3: "Does marmalade weight change if it’s chilled or room temperature?"
faqA3: "Cold marmalade is denser, so 0.5 tbsp may weigh 1-2g more than at room temp. For absolute accuracy, let it soften slightly before measuring. This matters most in delicate recipes like air fryer soufflés or meringues."
faqQ4: "What’s the best way to clean marmalade off air fryer baskets?"
faqA4: "Soak the basket in warm water with baking soda to loosen sticky residue. Avoid abrasive scrubbers—use a soft brush or our recommended <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner</a>. For burnt-on glaze, a vinegar soak works wonders."

<h2>Why accurate marmalade measurements matter</h2>
<p>Using the right amount of marmalade can make or break your air fryer recipe. Too little, and your dish might lack flavour; too much, and it could become overly sweet or sticky. Marmalade’s thick consistency means volume measurements like tablespoons aren’t always precise. Converting 0.5 tbsp of marmalade to grams (10g) ensures consistency, especially when scaling recipes up or down. If you're working with other ingredients, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a> has plenty of ideas to try.</p>

<p>Air fryers cook food quickly, so balanced flavours are crucial. Marmalade adds sweetness and acidity, but uneven distribution can lead to burnt spots or bland bites. Weighing your marmalade ensures even coating, whether you're glazing salmon or baking cakes.

<h3>How to measure 0.5 tbsp of marmalade</h3>
<p>If you don’t have a scale, use a levelled half-tablespoon measure for 10g of marmalade. Scoop gently to avoid air pockets, and scrape off excess with a straight edge. For sticky ingredients like marmalade, lightly greasing the spoon helps it slide off cleanly. Need more measurement hacks?

faqQ1: "Can I use olive oil instead of vegetable oil for 0.75 tbsp in grams?"
faqA1: "Yes, you can substitute olive oil, but note that its density differs slightly. 0.75 tbsp of olive oil weighs around 10 grams, compared to vegetable oil’s 10.5 grams. This small difference usually won’t affect most air fryer recipes."
faqQ2: "Why is weighing oil better than measuring by volume for air fryer recipes?"
faqA2: "Weighing oil in grams ensures precision, as the thickness of oils can vary with temperature and brand. In air fryers, where excess oil can lead to soggy results or smoke, grams provide consistency that volume measurements can’t guarantee."
faqQ3: "How do I measure 0.75 tbsp without a tablespoon or scale?"
faqA3: "For a rough estimate, fill a standard teaspoon 2.25 times (since 1 tbsp = 3 tsp). However, this method isn’t as accurate as weighing. For best results in air frying, we recommend investing in a cheap digital scale."
faqQ4: "Does the type of vegetable oil affect the gram conversion for 0.75 tbsp?"
faqA4: "Most common vegetable oils (like sunflower, rapeseed, or blended oils) have similar densities, so 0.75 tbsp will still be around 10.5 grams. Exotic oils with different viscosities may vary slightly, but the difference is negligible for home cooking."

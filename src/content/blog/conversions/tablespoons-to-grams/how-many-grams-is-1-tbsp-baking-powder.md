faqQ1: "Does 1 tbsp of baking powder always equal 15 grams?"
faqA1: "In the UK, 1 tbsp of baking powder typically weighs 15 grams, but slight variations can occur based on how it’s scooped. For absolute precision, use a digital scale. Humidity and brand density may also cause minor differences."
faqQ2: "Can I use teaspoons instead of tablespoons for baking powder in air fryer recipes?"
faqA2: "Yes! 1 tbsp equals 3 teaspoons, so adjust recipes accordingly. For example, if a recipe calls for 1 tbsp (15g), use 3 tsp (5g each). Just ensure even distribution to avoid bitter spots in your air fryer bakes."
faqQ3: "Why does my air fryer cake taste bitter with baking powder?"
faqA3: "Bitterness usually means too much baking powder. Stick to 15g (1 tbsp) per cup of flour, and check expiry dates—old baking powder loses potency, tempting cooks to overmeasure. Always level off tablespoons for accuracy."
faqQ4: "How do I store baking powder to keep it fresh for air fryer recipes?"
faqA4: "Keep baking powder in an airtight container in a cool, dry place. Avoid humid spots like near the stove. Test freshness by mixing 1 tsp with hot water—if it fizzes vigorously, it’s still active. Replace every 6–12 months."

<p>Baking powder is a leavening agent, and using the wrong amount can ruin your air fryer creations. Too little, and your cakes won’t rise; too much, and they’ll taste bitter.

Digital scales eliminate guesswork, making 1 tbsp baking powder to grams conversions foolproof. For consistent air fryer bakes, always weigh ingredients.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure 1 Tbsp Baking Powder Without Scales</h3>  
<p>If you don’t own scales, lightly spoon baking powder into a tablespoon and level it off with a knife. Avoid packing it down, as this can add extra grams. While not as precise as weighing, this method works in a pinch. For best results, invest in a cheap digital scale—it’s a game-changer for air fryer cooking.</p>

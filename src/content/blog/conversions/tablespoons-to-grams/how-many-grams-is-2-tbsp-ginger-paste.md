faqQ1: "Can I use fresh ginger instead of ginger paste in my air fryer recipes?"
faqA1: "Yes, you can substitute fresh ginger for ginger paste. Grate about 1 tablespoon of fresh ginger to replace 2 tbsp (30g) of ginger paste. Fresh ginger has a brighter flavour, so adjust to taste."
faqQ2: "Does the brand of ginger paste affect the weight conversion?"
faqA2: "Most ginger pastes have a similar density, so 2 tbsp should still be around 30g. However, thicker pastes might weigh slightly more. For precision, use a kitchen scale."
faqQ3: "How long does ginger paste last in the fridge?"
faqA3: "Store-bought ginger paste lasts about 2-3 weeks refrigerated. Homemade paste may last 1-2 weeks. Always check for off smells or mould before use."
faqQ4: "Can I freeze ginger paste for later use?"
faqA4: "Absolutely! Freeze ginger paste in ice cube trays for easy portioning. Each cube (about 1 tbsp or 15g) thaws quickly for air fryer recipes."

If you're prepping a <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken dish</a>, this accuracy guarantees the perfect spice level.</p>  

<p>Many air fryer recipes rely on ginger paste for its convenience and intense flavour. Unlike fresh ginger, which requires grating, the paste blends seamlessly into mixes.

<h2>How to measure ginger paste correctly</h2>  
<p>Using a kitchen scale is the most accurate way to measure 30g of ginger paste. If you don’t have one, levelling off your tablespoons ensures consistency.

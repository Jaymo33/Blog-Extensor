faqQ1: "Can I use coconut oil instead of butter in air fryer recipes?"
faqA1: "Yes, coconut oil is a great substitute for butter in air fryers, especially for vegan or dairy-free recipes. Since 4 tbsp of coconut oil (54g) is slightly lighter than butter (57g), you may need to reduce the quantity slightly to avoid greasiness. It also has a higher smoke point, making it better for high-heat cooking."
faqQ2: "Does melted coconut oil weigh the same as solid coconut oil?"
faqA2: "Yes, the weight remains the same whether coconut oil is melted or solid. However, its volume can appear different—melted oil may seem less in a measuring spoon due to air pockets. For accuracy, weigh 4 tbsp of coconut oil (54g) instead of relying solely on volume measurements."
faqQ3: "How do I measure coconut oil if I don’t have tablespoons?"
faqA3: "If you don’t have measuring spoons, use a standard UK tablespoon (15ml) and pack the coconut oil firmly. Alternatively, use a kitchen scale for the most precise 4 tbsp coconut oil to grams conversion (54g). For odd quantities, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a> can help."
faqQ4: "Is coconut oil healthier than other oils for air frying?"
faqA4: "Coconut oil contains medium-chain triglycerides (MCTs), which some studies suggest may have health benefits. However, it’s high in saturated fat, so moderation is key. For lighter options, consider avocado or olive oil, but note their smoke points may differ. Always measure carefully—4 tbsp of coconut oil (54g) is about 480 calories."

<p>4 tablespoons (tbsp) of coconut oil equals approximately 54 grams (g). This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precision matters, ensuring your dishes cook evenly and taste perfect. Whether you’re making crispy roast potatoes or a moist cake, knowing the exact weight of coconut oil helps avoid guesswork.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on precise ingredient ratios to deliver consistent results. Too much or too little coconut oil can affect texture, browning, and even cooking times. For example, using the correct 4 tbsp coconut oil to grams conversion ensures your <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> turn out crispy without becoming greasy. Many home cooks underestimate how small measurement errors can impact the final dish.</p>  

<p>Digital kitchen scales are the best tool for accuracy, especially when converting 4 tbsp of coconut oil into grams. Unlike measuring spoons, which can vary slightly, scales provide exact weights.

<h2>Common uses for coconut oil in air fryers</h2>  
<p>Coconut oil is a versatile ingredient in air fryer cooking, ideal for roasting vegetables, frying chicken, or baking goods.

Always store it in an airtight container to prevent oxidation, which can affect flavour.

faqQ1: "Can I use a regular spoon to measure 2.5 tbsp of milk?"
faqA1: "While you can use a regular spoon, it’s not the most accurate method. A standard UK tablespoon measures 15ml, but household spoons can vary. For precise results, especially in air fryer recipes, use a measuring spoon or a digital scale to ensure 2.5 tbsp of milk equals 37 grams."
faqQ2: "Does the type of milk affect the weight of 2.5 tbsp?"
faqA2: "Yes, slightly. Whole milk, skimmed milk, and plant-based milks have slightly different densities, but the difference is minimal. For most purposes, 2.5 tbsp of any milk will weigh around 37 grams. If precision is crucial, like in baking, stick to the type specified in the recipe."
faqQ3: "How do I convert 2.5 tbsp of milk to grams if I don’t have a scale?"
faqA3: "If you don’t have a scale, use a liquid measuring cup. 2.5 tbsp equals 37.5ml, and since milk’s density is close to 1g/ml, it’s roughly 37 grams. For more conversions, check our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>."
faqQ4: "Why is measuring milk in grams better for air fryer recipes?"

Measuring milk in grams eliminates inconsistencies, ensuring your batters, sauces, and baked goods have the perfect texture. For foolproof results, always weigh ingredients like 2.5 tbsp of milk when using an air fryer."

<h2>Why converting 2.5 tbsp of milk to grams matters</h2>  
<p>When cooking or baking, especially in an air fryer, precision is key. Converting 2.5 tbsp of milk into grams helps avoid guesswork, ensuring your recipes turn out just right. Air fryers cook food quickly, and even small measurement errors can affect texture and taste. For example, adding too much milk to a batter can make it too runny, while too little can dry it out.</p>  

<p>Many air fryer recipes, like those on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, rely on exact measurements for best results.

<h2>How to measure 2.5 tbsp of milk accurately</h2>

<h3>Using a digital scale</h3>

This method eliminates any guesswork and ensures your air fryer recipes, like those in our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>, turn out perfectly every time.</p>

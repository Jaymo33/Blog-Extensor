faqQ1: "Can I use 3 tbsp of baking soda instead of 42 grams in recipes?"
faqA1: "Yes, 3 tbsp of baking soda is equivalent to approximately 42 grams, so you can use them interchangeably. However, for the most accurate results, especially in baking, weighing with a scale is recommended. Air fryer recipes often rely on precise measurements for optimal texture."
faqQ2: "Why does baking soda measurement matter in air fryer cooking?"
faqA2: "Baking soda affects leavening and browning in air fryer recipes. Too much can cause bitterness, while too little may result in dense or flat baked goods. Since air fryers cook quickly and evenly, precise measurements ensure consistent results every time."
faqQ3: "How do I store baking soda to keep it accurate for measuring?"
faqA3: "Keep baking soda in an airtight container in a cool, dry place. Moisture can cause clumping, leading to uneven measurements. For best results, fluff it with a fork before scooping or weighing."
faqQ4: "Can I substitute baking powder for baking soda in air fryer recipes?"
faqA4: "Baking powder and baking soda aren’t direct substitutes, as they react differently. Baking powder contains its own acid, while baking soda needs an acidic ingredient (like yogurt or vinegar) to activate. Check your recipe or adjust ratios carefully."

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer baking</h2>  
<p>Baking soda is a leavening agent, and even small deviations can affect your recipe’s outcome. Too much can leave a bitter taste, while too little may result in dense baked goods. Air fryers circulate hot air, so precise measurements ensure even cooking. If you’re experimenting with <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>new recipes</a>, always measure carefully. A digital kitchen scale is the best tool for accuracy.</p>  

<p>Many UK bakers prefer grams over tablespoons for consistency. Scooping baking soda directly from the container can lead to varying amounts due to packing. Levelling off your tablespoons helps, but weighing eliminates guesswork. For perfectly fluffy <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>air fryer cakes</a>, stick to the 42-gram mark for 3 tbsp.</p>  

<h3>How to measure 3 tbsp baking soda without a scale</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a scale, use the spoon-and-level method. Gently spoon baking soda into the tablespoon without packing it down, then level with a knife. Three level tablespoons should give you close to 42 grams. For more tips on air fryer baking, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert recipes</a>.</p>

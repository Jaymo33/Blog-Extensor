faqQ1: "How do I convert 5 tbsp of icing sugar to grams without a scale?"
faqA1: "You can use the spoon-and-level method: lightly spoon icing sugar into a tablespoon and level it off. Five tablespoons equal approximately 40 grams. For accuracy, refer to a conversion chart or use measuring spoons designed for dry ingredients."
faqQ2: "Does the type of icing sugar affect the weight per tablespoon?"
faqA2: "Yes, finely ground icing sugar may settle more densely, while coarser varieties can be lighter. Always fluff the sugar before measuring to ensure consistency. For best results, stick to the standard conversion of 8 grams per tablespoon."
faqQ3: "Can I use this conversion for other types of sugar?"
faqA3: "No, granulated or brown sugar has a different density. Icing sugar is lighter, so 5 tbsp of granulated sugar would weigh more. Always check specific conversions for the type of sugar you’re using."
faqQ4: "Why is measuring by weight better than volume for baking?"
faqA4: "Weight measurements (grams) are more precise because volume (tablespoons) can vary due to settling or packing. For air fryer recipes, where cooking times are short, accuracy ensures even results. Use a kitchen scale for the best outcomes."

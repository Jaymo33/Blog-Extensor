faqQ1: "Can I use honey instead of maple syrup in air fryer recipes?"
faqA1: "Yes, you can substitute honey for maple syrup in most air fryer recipes. Use the same weight (3.75 grams for 0.25 tbsp), but note that honey is slightly sweeter. Reduce cooking temperature by about 5°C as honey caramelises faster than maple syrup."
faqQ2: "How do I measure 0.25 tbsp without special tools?"
faqA2: "If you don't have a 1/4 tablespoon measure, use a standard teaspoon - 0.25 tbsp equals 3/4 tsp. Alternatively, visualise filling a tablespoon about one-quarter full. For absolute precision, invest in a set of measuring spoons or a digital scale."
faqQ3: "Does the grade of maple syrup affect the weight?"
faqA3: "Different grades have minimal impact on weight - all hover around 3.75 grams per 0.25 tbsp. However, darker grades (like Grade B) are more viscous, so they may cling slightly more to measuring spoons. When precision matters, weighing is best."
faqQ4: "Why does my maple syrup burn in the air fryer?"
faqA4: "Maple syrup burns easily due to its high sugar content. When using 0.25 tbsp (3.75 grams), apply it in the last few minutes of cooking. Mixing with oil or brushing on in thin layers also helps prevent burning while still delivering great flavour."

<p>Air fryers rely on precise cooking times and temperatures, and ingredient measurements are just as crucial.

Too much syrup can lead to sticky, unevenly cooked dishes, while too little might leave your meal lacking flavour.</p>
<p>At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we emphasise the importance of accurate conversions for perfect results.

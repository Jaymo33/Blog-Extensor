faqQ1: "Is 4 tbsp of vinegar the same as 60g in the UK?"
faqA1: "Yes, in the UK, 4 tablespoons of standard cooking vinegar (like white or apple cider) equals approximately 60 grams. This conversion applies to most recipes, though very thick vinegars may vary slightly."
faqQ2: "Can I use 4 tbsp of vinegar instead of weighing it for air fryer recipes?"
faqA2: "While you can use volume measurements (tbsp), weighing ingredients like vinegar gives more consistent results in air fryer cooking. If your recipe specifies grams, it’s best to use scales for accuracy, especially in marinades or glazes."
faqQ3: "How does vinegar affect air fryer cooking times?"
faqA3: "Vinegar’s acidity can slightly reduce cooking times by helping break down proteins. When using 4 tbsp (60g) in marinades, your meat may cook faster and stay juicier. Always check doneness a few minutes early when using acidic ingredients."
faqQ4: "What’s the best way to measure 4 tbsp of vinegar without making a mess?"
faqA4: "Use a liquid measuring spoon and fill it level to the rim. For multiple tablespoons, pour vinegar into a small bowl first, then dip your measure. This prevents spills and ensures accurate 15ml portions for each tablespoon."

<p>4 tablespoons (tbsp) of vinegar weigh approximately 60 grams (g). This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements can make all the difference. Whether you’re marinating chicken, preparing a tangy glaze, or whipping up a salad dressing, knowing the exact weight ensures consistent results.

<h2>Why accurate vinegar measurements matter</h2>  
<p>Using the correct amount of vinegar in your air fryer recipes ensures balanced flavours and optimal cooking. Too much vinegar can overpower a dish, while too little might leave it bland. For example, a marinade for <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>air fryer chicken</a> relies on the right vinegar-to-oil ratio for tender, flavourful results. Measuring by weight (grams) is more reliable than volume (tablespoons) because it accounts for density variations.</p>  

<p>Different types of vinegar, like apple cider or balsamic, have slightly different weights per tablespoon. However, for most cooking vinegars (white, red wine, or distilled), 4 tbsp equals roughly 60g. If you’re preparing a <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>vinegar-based sauce</a>, this conversion ensures your dish turns out just right.</p>  

<h3>How to measure 4 tbsp of vinegar without scales</h3>

For 4 tbsp, simply repeat this four times.

faqQ1: "Does the type of potato affect the gram weight of 2.25 cups?"
faqA1: "Yes, potato varieties differ slightly in density. Russet potatoes may weigh closer to 340 grams for 2.25 cups, while waxy types like red potatoes could be around 300 grams. For air frying, stick to 320 grams as a reliable average."
faqQ2: "Can I use frozen potatoes instead of fresh for this measurement?"

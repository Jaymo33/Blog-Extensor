faqQ1: "Is 0.25 cups of icing sugar the same in the UK and US?"
faqA1: "No, there’s a slight difference. In the UK, 0.25 cups of icing sugar equals 30 grams, while in the US, it’s 28 grams. This variation stems from differing cup sizes and ingredient densities between the two measurement systems."
faqQ2: "Can I use granulated sugar instead of icing sugar for 0.25 cups?"
faqA2: "Not directly. Icing sugar is finely ground and contains cornstarch, which affects texture. If substituting, blend granulated sugar to a powder and add 1 teaspoon of cornstarch per 0.25 cups. However, results may vary in air fryer baking."
faqQ3: "How do I store leftover icing sugar after measuring 0.25 cups?"
faqA3: "Keep it in an airtight container in a cool, dry place to prevent clumping. If humidity is high, add a silica gel packet. Proper storage ensures your next 0.25-cup measurement stays accurate for air fryer recipes."
faqQ4: "Why does my air fryer dessert taste too sweet with 0.25 cups of icing sugar?"
faqA4: "Air fryers intensify flavors due to concentrated heat circulation. Try reducing the icing sugar to 20g (UK) or 18g (US) and adjust to taste. Always taste-test batters or glazes before cooking, as air frying amplifies sweetness."

<h2>Why Accurate Icing Sugar Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Getting the right amount of icing sugar ensures your air fryer bakes turn out perfectly every time. Too much sugar can make desserts overly sweet or affect texture, while too little might leave them bland.

Digital scales provide the most accuracy, especially for small quantities like this.</p>

<h3>UK vs. US Cup Measurements</h3>

<h2>How to Measure 0.25 Cups of Icing Sugar Without Scales</h2>  
<p>If you don’t have scales, spoon the icing sugar into a measuring cup and level it off with a knife. Avoid packing it down, as this can lead to over-measuring.

Sifting the sugar beforehand ensures uniformity, especially for delicate <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>air fryer desserts</a>.</p>

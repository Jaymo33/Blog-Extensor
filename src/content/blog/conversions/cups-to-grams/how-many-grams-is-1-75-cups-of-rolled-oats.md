faqQ1: "Does the type of rolled oats affect the weight per cup?"
faqA1: "Yes, thicker rolled oats (like jumbo oats) may weigh slightly more per cup due to their larger size. However, standard rolled oats generally weigh around 80 grams per cup, so 1.75 cups would still be close to 140 grams. Always check packaging for specific density notes."
faqQ2: "Can I use instant oats instead of rolled oats in air fryer recipes?"
faqA2: "Instant oats are finer and may compact differently, altering the texture of your dish. For best results, stick to rolled oats unless the recipe specifies otherwise. If substituting, reduce the quantity slightly, as instant oats absorb liquids faster."
faqQ3: "How do I convert grams back to cups if my recipe uses weight?"
faqA3: "Divide the gram measurement by 80 (the approximate weight of 1 cup of rolled oats). For example, 140 grams ÷ 80 = 1.75 cups. Keep a conversion chart handy, like the one on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>our site</a>, for quick reference."
faqQ4: "Why does my air fryer granola turn out soggy?"
faqA4: "Sogginess often stems from overcrowding or insufficient air circulation. Spread the granola evenly in the basket and shake it halfway through cooking. Also, ensure your rolled oats are measured accurately—too much liquid relative to oats can cause sogginess."

<h3>How to Measure Rolled Oats Correctly</h3>  
<p>For the most accurate conversion, use a kitchen scale to weigh your oats. Scooping directly from the bag can lead to uneven measurements, as rolled oats vary in density. Fluff the oats lightly before measuring to avoid compacting them. If you don’t have a scale, spoon the oats into your measuring cup and level it off. This method ensures you’re as close to 140 grams as possible for 1.75 cups.</p>

faqQ1: "Does 1.25 cups of chicken breast weigh the same raw and cooked?"
faqA1: "No, raw chicken breast loses moisture during cooking, so 1.25 cups of cooked chicken will weigh less than raw. For accuracy, always note whether your recipe specifies raw or cooked measurements."
faqQ2: "Can I use this conversion for frozen chicken breast?"
faqA2: "It’s best to thaw frozen chicken breast completely before measuring, as ice crystals can affect the weight. Once thawed, 1.25 cups should still be around 175 grams for diced or shredded chicken."
faqQ3: "How does shredding vs. dicing affect the weight per cup?"
faqA3: "Shredded chicken is less dense than diced, so 1.25 cups of shredded chicken might weigh slightly less. However, the difference is minimal, and 175 grams remains a reliable benchmark for most recipes."
faqQ4: "Why is measuring chicken breast in grams better than cups?"
faqA4: "Grams provide precise, consistent measurements, while cup measurements can vary based on how the chicken is packed. For air fryer cooking, where evenness is key, weighing ensures perfect results every time."

faqQ1: "Does the fat content of minced beef affect the gram measurement?"
faqA1: "Yes, but minimally. Lean minced beef (5% fat) and standard (15-20% fat) differ slightly in density, but 2.25 cups will still weigh ~255 grams. For precise recipes like meatloaf, weigh the meat for consistency. Higher-fat mince may compact more, so fluff it before measuring."
faqQ2: "Can I use this conversion for frozen minced beef?"
faqA2: "Thaw frozen minced beef completely before measuring. Ice crystals alter volume, so 2.25 cups of frozen mince won’t equal 255 grams. Once thawed, drain excess liquid and fluff with a fork for an accurate cup-to-gram conversion."
faqQ3: "How many servings does 2.25 cups (255g) of minced beef provide?"
faqA3: "It depends on the dish. For air fryer burgers, 255 grams makes 2-3 patties. In bolognese or chilli, it serves 3-4 people. For meatballs, you’ll get ~20 small (12g each) or 10 large (25g each)."
faqQ4: "Is minced beef the same weight after cooking?"
faqA4: "No—minced beef loses ~25% weight when cooked due to fat and moisture loss. If a recipe calls for 255g cooked beef, start with ~340g (3 cups) raw. Always preheat your air fryer to ensure even cooking and minimise shrinkage."

Remember, 2.25 cups of minced beef in grams is roughly 255g, but slight variations won’t ruin most dishes. For baking recipes like meatloaf, though, precision matters more—opt for a scale when possible.</p>

<h3>UK vs. US Cup Measurements</h3>  
<p>While UK and US cups are similar (1 UK cup = 284ml, 1 US cup = 240ml), minced beef’s density means the gram equivalent stays roughly the same.

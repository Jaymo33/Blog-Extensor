faqQ1: "Does the type of milk affect the weight of 0.5 cups?"
faqA1: "Yes, but only slightly. Whole milk is denser than skim milk, so 0.5 cups of whole milk might weigh around 123 grams, while skim milk could be closer to 120 grams. Plant-based milks like almond or oat milk vary more, so always check the packaging for specific weights."
faqQ2: "Can I use a kitchen scale instead of measuring cups for milk?"
faqA2: "Absolutely! A kitchen scale is often more accurate than measuring cups, especially for liquids. Simply pour milk into your mixing bowl until the scale reads 122 grams for 0.5 cups. This method reduces mess and ensures precision."
faqQ3: "Why do some recipes use grams instead of cups for milk?"
faqA3: "Grams provide a more consistent measurement since cup sizes can vary slightly between countries. Professional bakers and air fryer enthusiasts often prefer grams for reliability, especially in recipes where small changes affect texture or rise."
faqQ4: "How do I convert 0.5 cups of milk to millilitres?"
faqA4: "0.5 cups of milk is roughly 118 millilitres. However, millilitres measure volume, while grams measure weight, so they aren’t interchangeable in all recipes. For baking, stick to grams for the best results."

<h3>How to Measure 0.5 Cups of Milk Accurately</h3>

<h2>Converting Cups to Grams for Different Ingredients</h2>  
<p>While 0.5 cups of milk is 122 grams, other ingredients vary widely. Flour, sugar, and butter all have different densities, so their cup-to-gram conversions differ.

faqQ1: "Why is it better to measure brown sugar in grams rather than cups?"
faqA1: "Measuring brown sugar in grams ensures accuracy because cup measurements can vary based on how the sugar is packed. Grams provide a consistent weight, eliminating guesswork and ensuring your air fryer recipes turn out perfectly every time."
faqQ2: "Does the type of brown sugar affect the gram measurement?"
faqA2: "Yes, light and dark brown sugar have slightly different densities, but the difference is minimal. For 1.25 cups, both types will weigh approximately 250 grams. Always check your recipe for specific instructions."
faqQ3: "Can I use this conversion for other types of sugar?"
faqA3: "No, granulated and powdered sugars have different densities. For example, 1.25 cups of granulated sugar equals about 250 grams, but powdered sugar is lighter. Always verify conversions for the specific sugar type."
faqQ4: "How do I convert grams back to cups if needed?"
faqA4: "To convert grams back to cups, divide the gram amount by 200 (since 1 cup of brown sugar is roughly 200 grams). For 250 grams, that’s 1.25 cups. Use a kitchen scale for the most accurate results."

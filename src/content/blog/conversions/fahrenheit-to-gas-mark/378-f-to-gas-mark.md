faqQ1: "Can I use 378 F (Gas Mark 5) for all air fryer recipes?"
faqA1: "While 378 F (Gas Mark 5) works for many foods, some recipes require specific temperatures. Delicate items like soufflés need lower heat, while crispy foods might need higher temps. Always check recipe recommendations at airfryerrecipe.co.uk for best results."
faqQ2: "How do I convert 378 F to Gas Mark for a fan oven?"
faqA2: "For fan ovens, reduce the temperature by 20°C (about 35°F), so 378 F converts to Gas Mark 4 in fan-assisted ovens. However, air fryers already circulate air like fan ovens, so maintain the original 378 F (Gas Mark 5) conversion."
faqQ3: "Why does my air fryer cook faster than my oven at 378 F?"
faqA3: "Air fryers cook faster at 378 F (Gas Mark 5) because their compact size and powerful fan circulate heat more efficiently than conventional ovens. The concentrated hot air penetrates food from all angles, reducing cooking times by 15-25%."
faqQ4: "Can I cook frozen food directly at 378 F (Gas Mark 5) in my air fryer?"
faqA4: "Yes, most frozen foods cook beautifully at 378 F (Gas Mark 5) in air fryers. However, you may need to add 2-3 minutes to the cooking time compared to fresh foods. Always check packaging for specific temperature recommendations."

faqQ1: "How do I convert 372 F to Gas Mark for fan ovens?"
faqA1: "For fan ovens, 372°F converts to Gas Mark 4 rather than 5. Fan-assisted ovens circulate heat more efficiently, so they typically need setting about 20°C lower than conventional ovens for equivalent results."
faqQ2: "Can I use the 372 F to Gas Mark conversion for air fryers?"
faqA2: "Yes, 372°F equals Gas Mark 5 in air fryers too. However, air fryers cook faster due to their compact size and rapid air circulation, so reduce cooking time by about 15-20% compared to oven recipes."
faqQ3: "What types of food cook best at 372 F Gas Mark 5?"
faqA3: "372 F (Gas Mark 5) works perfectly for roasting chicken, baking cakes, cooking fish fillets, and crisping roasted vegetables. It's a versatile temperature that provides enough heat for browning without burning most foods."
faqQ4: "Why does my oven's Gas Mark 5 seem hotter than 372 F?"
faqA4: "Oven thermostats can become inaccurate over time. Use an independent oven thermometer to verify your oven's actual temperature at Gas Mark 5. If it's significantly off, you may need to adjust the thermostat or have your oven serviced."

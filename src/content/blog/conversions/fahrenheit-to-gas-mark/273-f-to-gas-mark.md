faqQ1: "Can I use 273 F in my air fryer instead of Gas Mark 1?"
faqA1: "Absolutely! Most air fryers use Fahrenheit settings, so you can directly set 273 F rather than converting to Gas Mark. Just remember air fryers cook faster, so reduce cooking times by about 15-20% compared to oven recipes."
faqQ2: "What types of food cook best at 273 F (Gas Mark 1)?"
faqA2: "273 F excels for delicate tasks like proofing dough, dehydrating fruits, melting chocolate, or keeping cooked dishes warm. It's also great for slow-roasting vegetables or making homemade yogurt in your air fryer."
faqQ3: "How do I know if my air fryer maintains accurate temperature at 273 F?"
faqA3: "Use an oven thermometer to verify your air fryer's temperature accuracy. Place it in the basket while preheating to 273 F. If readings differ significantly, consult your manufacturer's guide or consider professional calibration."
faqQ4: "Why would I choose 273 F over higher temperatures for air frying?"
faqA4: "Lower temperatures like 273 F prevent burning while allowing thorough, even cooking - perfect for delicate items or when you want slower flavour development. It's also ideal for keeping food warm without continuing to cook it."

<p>When converting 273 F to Gas Mark for air fryers, remember most models don't use Gas Mark settings directly.

Many modern air fryers automatically adjust cooking times for lower temperatures like 273 F.</p>

faqQ1: "Can I use 311 F to Gas Mark conversion for all types of cooking?"
faqA1: "Yes, 311°F (Gas Mark 2) works for baking, roasting, and dehydrating. However, for searing meats or crispy frying, you'll need higher temperatures. Always adjust cooking times based on your appliance type and food quantity."
faqQ2: "How does 311 F compare to fan oven temperatures?"
faqA2: "In a fan-assisted oven, 311°F (Gas Mark 2) would be approximately 140°C with the fan on. The moving air makes the oven more efficient, so you may need to reduce cooking times by 10-20% compared to conventional ovens."
faqQ3: "Why would I use 311 F instead of higher temperatures?"
faqA3: "311°F (Gas Mark 2) is ideal for delicate foods that might burn at higher heats, like custards, cheesecakes, or meringues. It's also perfect for slow-roasting vegetables to develop deep flavours without charring."
faqQ4: "Can I cook frozen foods at 311 F in an air fryer?"
faqA4: "Absolutely! 311°F (Gas Mark 2) works well for gently cooking frozen items like pastries or fish fillets. Just extend the cooking time by 3-5 minutes compared to fresh foods, and check internal temperatures for doneness."

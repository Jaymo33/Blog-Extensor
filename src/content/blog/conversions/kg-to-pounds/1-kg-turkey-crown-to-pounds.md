Knowing this exact conversion helps determine proper air fryer cooking times and ensures your turkey cooks evenly without drying out."
faqQ2: "Why is converting turkey crown weight important for air fryer cooking?"
faqA2: "Converting turkey crown weight from kilograms to pounds is crucial because most air fryer cooking guidelines use pound measurements for timing recommendations.

Let the turkey rest for 10-15 minutes after cooking to allow juices to redistribute throughout the meat for maximum tenderness."
faqQ4: "Can I use the same conversion for other turkey weights?"
faqA4: "Yes, the same conversion ratio applies to all weights - simply multiply any kilogram measurement by 2.2 to convert to pounds. Whether you have a 1.5 kg or 2.5 kg turkey crown, the conversion factor remains consistent. This makes scaling recipes and adjusting cooking times straightforward regardless of your turkey crown's size when preparing it in your air fryer."

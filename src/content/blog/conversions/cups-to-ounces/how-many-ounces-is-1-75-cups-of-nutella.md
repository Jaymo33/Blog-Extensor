faqQ1: "Can I use grams instead of ounces for measuring Nutella?"
faqA1: "Absolutely! 1.75 cups of Nutella equals about 420 grams. Many UK bakers prefer grams for greater precision, especially in air fryer recipes where exact measurements matter. A kitchen scale will give you the most accurate results."
faqQ2: "Why does Nutella weigh less per cup than liquids?"
faqA2: "Nutella's thick, spreadable consistency means it doesn't settle into a cup the same way liquids do. Air pockets between the spread reduce its weight per volume. That's why 1.75 cups equals 14.8 ounces rather than the 14 ounces you'd expect with water."
faqQ3: "How can I measure Nutella without making a mess?"
faqA3: "Lightly grease your measuring cup or spoon with oil first - the Nutella will slide right out. Alternatively, use disposable parchment paper to line the cup before adding Nutella. For air fryer recipes, weighing is cleaner than volume measurements."
faqQ4: "Does the UK cup measurement differ for Nutella?"
faqA4: "UK cups are slightly larger (284ml vs 240ml), but the weight difference is minimal for Nutella. 1.75 UK cups would be about 15.1 ounces. For air fryer cooking, either measurement works, but consistency matters most within a single recipe."

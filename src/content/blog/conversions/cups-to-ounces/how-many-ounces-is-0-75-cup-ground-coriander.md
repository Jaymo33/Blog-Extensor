faqQ1: "Can I use whole coriander seeds instead of ground coriander in my air fryer recipe?"
faqA1: "Yes, but you’ll need to adjust the quantity. Whole coriander seeds have a more concentrated flavour, so use about half the amount (e.g., 0.375 cup or 1.2 oz for 0.75 cup ground coriander). Crush them lightly before adding to your dish for the best results."
faqQ2: "Why does my air fryer recipe taste too strong when I use 0.75 cup of ground coriander?"
faqA2: "This could be due to packing the measuring cup too tightly, resulting in more than 2.4 oz. Always spoon and level ground coriander for accuracy. Also, check if your recipe requires less—some dishes need just a tablespoon for subtle flavour."
faqQ3: "How do I convert 0.75 cup of ground coriander to grams?"
faqA3: "0.75 cup of ground coriander (2.4 oz) is roughly 68 grams. If your air fryer recipe uses metric measurements, a kitchen scale ensures precision. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a> has more details."
faqQ4: "Can I substitute ground cumin for ground coriander in an air fryer recipe?"
faqA4: "While both spices add warmth, cumin has a smokier flavour. Use the same 0.75 cup (2.4 oz) quantity, but expect a different taste profile. For balanced results, try a 50-50 mix of both spices."

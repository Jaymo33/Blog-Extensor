faqQ1: "Can I use whole milk instead of semi skimmed milk for this conversion?"
faqA1: "Yes, whole milk can be substituted, but keep in mind it has a higher fat content. The volume-to-ounce conversion remains the same (1.5 cups = 12 oz), but the richness may slightly alter your recipe’s texture. Adjust cooking times if needed in the air fryer."
faqQ2: "How do I convert 1.5 cups of semi skimmed milk to millilitres?"
faqA2: "1.5 cups of semi skimmed milk equals approximately 355 millilitres (ml). This is useful for recipes using metric measurements. If your air fryer recipe calls for ml, a kitchen scale with unit switching can help ensure accuracy."
faqQ3: "Why does semi skimmed milk measure differently in weight compared to other liquids?"
faqA3: "Milk’s density varies slightly due to its fat and protein content, but the difference is minimal for most recipes. For air fryer cooking, sticking to 12 oz per 1.5 cups ensures consistency. Always measure liquids at room temperature for the most accurate results."
faqQ4: "Can I use this conversion for almond or oat milk in air fryer recipes?"
faqA4: "Yes, but plant-based milks may behave differently under heat. While 1.5 cups still equals 12 oz, their lower fat content can affect browning and texture. Test small batches first when adapting dairy-free recipes in the air fryer."

faqQ1: "Can I use coconut oil instead of vegetable oil in my air fryer?"
faqA1: "Yes, coconut oil is a great substitute for vegetable oil in air fryers. It has a high smoke point (around 350°F/175°C), making it suitable for frying and roasting. Just remember to measure accurately—0.66 cup equals 5.28 ounces—to avoid greasy results."
faqQ2: "How do I measure 0.66 cup of coconut oil without a scale?"
faqA2: "If you don’t have a scale, use the water displacement method. Fill a measuring cup with water to the 0.66 cup mark, then add coconut oil until the water reaches 1 cup. The oil will displace the water, giving you the exact amount needed for your recipe."
faqQ3: "Does coconut oil add flavour to air-fried foods?"
faqA3: "Coconut oil has a mild, slightly sweet flavour that complements both savoury and sweet dishes. It’s subtle in most recipes but can enhance tropical or dessert dishes. For neutral cooking, refined coconut oil has less flavour than unrefined."
faqQ4: "How should I store coconut oil for air frying?"
faqA4: "Store coconut oil in a cool, dark place. It solidifies below 76°F (24°C) but melts easily when heated. If your kitchen is warm, keep it in the fridge to maintain consistency. Always measure 0.66 cup (5.28 ounces) when solid for accuracy."

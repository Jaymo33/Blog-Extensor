faqQ1: "Can I use solid coconut oil instead of melted for measuring?"
faqA1: "Yes, but it’s easier to measure melted coconut oil for accuracy. If using solid, pack it tightly into the measuring cup to avoid gaps. For recipes requiring 2.5 cups (20 ounces), melting ensures consistency."
faqQ2: "Does the type of coconut oil affect the conversion?"
faqA2: "No, whether refined or unrefined, 2.5 cups of coconut oil will always equal 20 ounces. The difference lies in flavour and smoke point, not weight. Choose based on your recipe’s needs."
faqQ3: "How do I store leftover coconut oil after measuring?"
faqA3: "Store it in an airtight container at room temperature or in the fridge. Coconut oil solidifies when cool but melts easily for reuse. Avoid contamination by using clean utensils."
faqQ4: "Can I substitute coconut oil with other oils in air fryer recipes?"
faqA4: "Yes, but adjust quantities as needed. For example, olive oil has a similar weight, but flavours may differ. Always check smoke points to ensure safe air frying."

faqQ1: "Does the fat content affect how many ounces are in 1 cup of greek yogurt?"
faqA1: "The fat content doesn't significantly change the weight, but it can slightly affect the volume. Full-fat greek yogurt might be marginally denser, but the difference in ounces per cup is negligible for most recipes. Both varieties will measure approximately 8.64oz per cup."
faqQ2: "Can I use regular yogurt instead of greek yogurt in air fryer recipes?"
faqA2: "You can substitute regular yogurt, but you'll need to adjust quantities. Greek yogurt is thicker, so you might use about 25% less regular yogurt by volume. For precise results, weigh your substitution - regular yogurt is slightly lighter at about 8oz per cup."
faqQ3: "How do I convert grams to ounces for greek yogurt measurements?"
faqA3: "To convert grams to ounces, divide the gram measurement by 28.35. For greek yogurt, 245 grams (1 cup) equals approximately 8.64 ounces. Most digital kitchen scales allow you to toggle between metric and imperial measurements for convenience."
faqQ4: "Why does my air fryer recipe specify weight instead of volume for greek yogurt?"
faqA4: "Weight measurements are more accurate because how you fill a cup can vary. Air fryer recipes often specify weight to ensure consistent results, especially important for baking where precision affects texture. 8.64oz gives you the exact amount needed, regardless of how you scoop it."

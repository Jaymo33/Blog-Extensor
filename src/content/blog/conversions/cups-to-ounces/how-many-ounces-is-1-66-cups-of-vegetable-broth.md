faqQ1: "Can I use stock instead of vegetable broth for the same measurement?"
faqA1: "Yes, vegetable stock and broth are generally interchangeable in recipes. Both measure the same in ounces per cup, so 1.66 cups of stock will also be 13.28 ounces. Just note that stock may have a richer flavour due to longer cooking times with bones or aromatics."
faqQ2: "How do I measure 1.66 cups without a measuring cup?"
faqA2: "If you don’t have a measuring cup, use a scale to weigh out 13.28 ounces of vegetable broth directly. Alternatively, 1.66 cups is roughly 1 full cup plus 2/3 of another cup. For small adjustments, a tablespoon (0.5 oz) can help fine-tune the amount."
faqQ3: "Does the type of vegetable broth affect the weight in ounces?"
faqA3: "Most commercial vegetable broths have a similar density, so the weight difference is minimal. Homemade broth may vary slightly depending on vegetable content, but 1.66 cups will still be close to 13.28 ounces. For precision, always weigh ingredients when possible."
faqQ4: "Can I freeze 1.66 cups of vegetable broth for later use?"
faqA4: "Absolutely! Freeze the broth in a sealed container or ice cube trays for portioned use. Label it with the ounce equivalent (13.28 oz) for easy reference. Thaw in the fridge overnight or melt directly in your air fryer recipes for added convenience."

faqQ1: "Is 0.25 cup of beef stock the same as 2 ounces in weight?"
faqA1: "Yes, 0.25 cup of beef stock equals 2 fluid ounces by volume. For most cooking purposes, especially in air fryer recipes, this volume measurement is sufficient. However, if your recipe specifies weight ounces, note that the density of beef stock may cause slight variations."
faqQ2: "Can I use a kitchen scale to measure 0.25 cup of beef stock?"
faqA2: "Absolutely! Set your kitchen scale to ounces and pour beef stock until it reaches 2 oz. This method is just as accurate as using a measuring cup and can be quicker for those who prefer weighing ingredients. It’s especially useful for recipes requiring precision."
faqQ3: "How does 0.25 cup of beef stock affect air fryer cooking times?"
faqA3: "Using 0.25 cup of beef stock (2 oz) in an air fryer adds moisture without prolonging cooking times significantly. It’s ideal for basting meats or creating sauces. However, avoid over-saturating ingredients, as excess liquid can lead to steaming instead of crisping."

faqQ1: "Can I use crunchy almond butter instead of smooth for the 1.66 cups measurement?"
faqA1: "Yes, you can use crunchy almond butter instead of smooth when measuring 1.66 cups (13.28 ounces). The weight remains the same, but the texture will differ slightly in your final dish. Just ensure you pack it into the measuring cup consistently for accuracy."
faqQ2: "How does the conversion change if my almond butter is homemade?"
faqA2: "Homemade almond butter might have slight variations in density, but 1.66 cups should still equal roughly 13.28 ounces. If your homemade version is particularly oily or thick, consider weighing it for absolute precision, especially for air fryer recipes where consistency matters."
faqQ3: "Why do some recipes use weight instead of volume for almond butter?"
faqA3: "Weight measurements (like ounces) are more accurate than volume (cups) for ingredients like almond butter that can settle or vary in density. This precision is especially important in air fryer cooking, where even heat distribution relies on consistent ingredient ratios."
faqQ4: "Can I substitute peanut butter for almond butter in the same 1.66 cup quantity?"
faqA4: "Yes, you can substitute peanut butter for almond butter using the same 1.66 cup (13.28 ounce) measurement. Both have similar consistencies, though the flavour profile will change. Adjust other seasonings accordingly to balance the taste in your air fryer recipe."

For sticky ingredients like almond butter, lightly greasing your measuring cup can help it slide out easily.</p>

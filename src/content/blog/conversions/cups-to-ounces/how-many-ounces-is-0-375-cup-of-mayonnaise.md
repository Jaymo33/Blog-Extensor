faqQ1: "How do I measure 0.375 cup of mayonnaise without a measuring cup?"
faqA1: "You can use tablespoons - 0.375 cup equals 6 tablespoons. Alternatively, use a kitchen scale to weigh out 3 ounces. For sticky ingredients like mayonnaise, spraying your measuring spoon with oil first helps it slide out cleanly."
faqQ2: "Does the brand of mayonnaise affect the 0.375 cup to ounces conversion?"
faqA2: "Different brands may have slightly different densities, but the difference is minimal for most cooking purposes. Heavy mayonnaise might weigh slightly more per 0.375 cup, while light versions might weigh less. When precision matters, weighing is best."
faqQ3: "Can I use the 0.375 cup mayonnaise to ounces conversion for other ingredients?"
faqA3: "This conversion is specific to mayonnaise due to its unique density. Other ingredients like flour, sugar, or oil will have different volume-to-weight ratios. Always check specific conversion charts for different ingredients when cooking in your air fryer."
faqQ4: "Why would an air fryer recipe use 0.375 cup of mayonnaise instead of 3 ounces?"
faqA4: "Some recipe creators prefer volume measurements (cups) while others use weight (ounces). 0.375 cup is a common measurement in scaled-down recipes, especially when halving standard measurements. The air fryer's smaller capacity often calls for these precise fractional measurements."

faqQ1: "Does the type of mustard affect the weight per cup?"
faqA1: "Yes, but only slightly. Thicker mustards, like whole grain or Dijon, may weigh a bit more than yellow mustard due to density. However, 0.75 cup of any mustard will generally be close to 6 ounces. For precise results, use a kitchen scale."
faqQ2: "Can I use this conversion for other condiments in my air fryer?"
faqA2: "While this guide focuses on mustard, many condiments like ketchup or mayo have similar densities. Always check specific conversions for accuracy, especially in air fryer recipes where texture matters. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a> covers more ingredients."
faqQ3: "Why is measuring by weight better for air fryer recipes?"
faqA3: "Weight measurements are more precise than volume, ensuring even cooking and perfect texture in your air fryer. Too much or too little of an ingredient like mustard can alter browning and crispiness. A scale eliminates guesswork."
faqQ4: "How do I measure sticky mustard without making a mess?"
faqA4: "Lightly coat your measuring cup with oil or use a flexible spatula to scrape out every bit. For sticky mustards, weighing (6 ounces for 0.75 cup) is often cleaner and more accurate.

These small steps ensure your 0.75 cup of mustard truly equals 6 ounces, keeping your air fryer recipes on track.</p>

faqQ1: "Is 2 cups of chickpeas the same as one can of chickpeas?"
faqA1: "Not quite. A standard 400g can of chickpeas (drained) yields about 1.5 cups or 9 ounces, slightly less than 2 cups (12 ounces). Always check the can size and drain well before measuring for air fryer recipes."
faqQ2: "Do cooked and uncooked chickpeas weigh the same per cup?"
faqA2: "No, uncooked chickpeas are denser. Two cups of dried chickpeas weigh about 12 ounces but will expand when cooked. For cooked chickpeas, 2 cups equal roughly 12 ounces after draining."
faqQ3: "Can I use this conversion for other beans in my air fryer?"
faqA3: "Most beans have similar densities, but always verify for specific types. For example, 2 cups of black beans weigh about 13 ounces. When in doubt, weigh them for precision in air fryer recipes."
faqQ4: "Why do my air-fried chickpeas sometimes turn out uneven?"
faqA4: "Overcrowding the basket is a common culprit. For 2 cups (12 ounces) of chickpeas, cook in batches if your air fryer is small. Also, shake the basket halfway through cooking for even crispiness."

<p>2 cups of chickpeas weigh approximately 12 ounces (340 grams) when measured in standard UK or US cups. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes, ensuring your dishes turn out perfectly every time. Whether you’re roasting chickpeas for a crunchy snack or adding them to a hearty meal, accurate measurements matter. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we help you nail these details for flawless cooking.</p>

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on precise ingredient ratios to achieve the perfect texture and doneness. Too many chickpeas can overcrowd the basket, leading to uneven cooking, while too few might burn. Measuring 2 cups of chickpeas correctly (about 12 ounces) ensures even heat distribution. This is especially important for crispy roasted chickpeas, a popular <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer snack</a>. Consistency in measurements also helps when scaling recipes up or down.</p>  

<p>Chickpeas expand slightly when cooked, so starting with the right dry measurement is key. If you’re using canned chickpeas, drain and rinse them first for accurate cup-to-ounce conversions.

This precision is handy for dishes like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>air-fried vegetable mixes</a> where chickpeas play a starring role.</p>

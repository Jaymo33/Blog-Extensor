faqQ1: "Can I use golden syrup instead of treacle in my air fryer recipe?"
faqA1: "Yes, you can substitute golden syrup for treacle, but the flavour will be lighter and less robust. Use the same 1.33 cups (10.64 ounces) measurement, as their densities are similar. Adjust other sweeteners in your recipe to account for golden syrup’s milder taste."
faqQ2: "Why does my treacle measurement seem off when using cups?"
faqA2: "Treacle’s thickness causes it to settle or trap air bubbles in cup measurements, leading to inconsistency. That’s why weighing it in ounces (10.64 oz for 1.33 cups) is more reliable. Always stir treacle well before measuring to minimise air pockets."
faqQ3: "How do I convert ounces back to cups if my recipe uses weight?"
faqA3: "To convert 10.64 ounces of treacle back to cups, divide by 8 (since 1 cup ≈ 8 oz). This gives you 1.33 cups. For other ingredients, check our conversion chart as weights vary. This method works perfectly for air fryer recipes requiring precision."
faqQ4: "Can I reduce the amount of treacle in my air fryer recipe?"
faqA4: "Yes, you can reduce the 1.33 cups (10.64 oz) of treacle, but it may affect texture and browning. Treacle helps with caramelisation in air fryers. If reducing, consider adding a touch of oil or honey to maintain moisture and colour in your dish."

<h2>Why Convert Cups to Ounces for Treacle?</h2>
<p>Measuring treacle by weight (ounces) is far more accurate than using volume (cups). Treacle’s thick consistency means it can settle or trap air, leading to inconsistent cup measurements. Ounces provide a reliable standard, especially for air fryer recipes where precision matters. If you’re working with a recipe from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>our collection</a>, you’ll often find weights listed for this reason. Converting 1.33 cups of treacle to ounces ensures your dish turns out perfectly every time.</p>

<p>Another benefit of using ounces is scalability. Doubling or halving a recipe becomes effortless when you’re working with weight rather than volume. This is particularly useful for batch cooking or meal prepping in your air fryer.

<h3>How to Measure Treacle Accurately</h3>
<p>To measure 1.33 cups of treacle, use a liquid measuring cup and a spatula. Coat the cup with a light layer of oil to help the treacle slide out easily. Fill the cup slightly above the 1.33-cup mark, then level it off with the spatula. For sticky ingredients like treacle, a digital kitchen scale is your best friend. Simply tare the scale with your container, then pour until you hit 10.64 ounces.</p>

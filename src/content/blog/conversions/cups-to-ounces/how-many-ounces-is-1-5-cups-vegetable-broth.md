faqQ1: "Is 1.5 cups of vegetable broth the same as 12 ounces in weight?"
faqA1: "For most standard vegetable broths, 1.5 cups (12 fluid ounces) will weigh approximately 12 ounces by weight. However, thicker or reduced broths may weigh slightly more due to higher density. Always check the label if precision is critical."
faqQ2: "Can I use stock instead of broth when measuring 1.5 cups?"
faqA2: "Yes, you can substitute vegetable stock for broth in a 1:1 ratio, as both measure similarly in fluid ounces. Just note that stocks are often richer, so you may want to dilute slightly with water for milder flavours in air fryer recipes."
faqQ3: "How do I measure 1.5 cups of vegetable broth without a measuring cup?"
faqA3: "If you don’t have a measuring cup, use a kitchen scale: 12 fluid ounces of vegetable broth weighs roughly 340 grams. Alternatively, a standard UK mug holds about 10 oz, so fill it 1.2 times for 1.5 cups."
faqQ4: "Why does my air fryer recipe call for 1.5 cups of vegetable broth?"
faqA4: "Recipes often specify 1.5 cups (12 oz) of broth to maintain moisture during high-heat air frying. This amount is enough to create steam for even cooking without making food soggy. It’s common in grain-based dishes or for basting proteins."

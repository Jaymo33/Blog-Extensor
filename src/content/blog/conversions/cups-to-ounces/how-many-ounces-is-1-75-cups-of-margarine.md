faqQ1: "Can I use butter instead of margarine in air fryer recipes?"
faqA1: "Yes, butter can replace margarine in a 1:1 ratio, but it has a lower water content, which may affect texture. For flaky pastries, margarine often works better due to its higher melting point. Adjust cooking times slightly if substituting."
faqQ2: "How do I store leftover margarine for future air fryer use?"
faqA2: "Keep margarine in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 3 months. For longer storage, freeze it in measured portions (like 1.75 cups) and thaw before use. Avoid repeated thawing and refreezing."
faqQ3: "Why does my air fryer recipe turn out greasy with margarine?"
faqA3: "Excess grease usually means too much margarine or insufficient preheating. Reduce margarine by 1-2 tablespoons and ensure your air fryer is hot before adding food. Patting ingredients dry also helps."
faqQ4: "Is margarine healthier than butter for air frying?"
faqA4: "Margarine often has less saturated fat than butter, making it a lighter option. However, some brands contain additives—check labels. For healthier alternatives, try olive oil spreads in moderation."

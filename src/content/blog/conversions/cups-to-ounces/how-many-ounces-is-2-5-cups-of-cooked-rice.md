faqQ1: "Does the type of rice affect the weight of 2.5 cups?"
faqA1: "While most cooked rice varieties weigh roughly the same, slight differences exist. For example, brown rice may be denser than white rice, but 2.5 cups of cooked rice still averages around 20 ounces. For precise measurements, weigh your rice after cooking."
faqQ2: "Can I use this conversion for uncooked rice?"
faqA2: "No, uncooked rice expands when cooked, so the weight per cup differs significantly. 2.5 cups of uncooked rice yields about 5 cups cooked, weighing roughly 40 ounces. Always measure cooked rice separately for accurate results."
faqQ3: "How do I store 2.5 cups of cooked rice for later use?"
faqA3: "Let the rice cool completely, then store it in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 4 days. For longer storage, freeze it in portions. Reheat in the air fryer at 350°F for 3–5 minutes for best texture."
faqQ4: "Why is weighing rice better than using cups?"
faqA4: "Weight (ounces) is more accurate because cup measurements can vary based on how the rice is packed. A kitchen scale ensures consistency, which is especially important for air fryer recipes where even cooking is crucial."

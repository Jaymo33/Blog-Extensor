faqQ1: "Does the type of almond affect the 1.25 cups to ounces conversion?"
faqA1: "Yes, almond variety can slightly affect the conversion. Blanched almonds grind finer than whole almonds with skins, potentially changing the weight. However, for most recipes, the difference is minimal when converting 1.25 cups to ounces. Always use the same type specified in your air fryer recipe for best results."
faqQ2: "Can I use this conversion for other nut flours in my air fryer?"
faqA2: "While the 1.25 cups to ounces conversion works similarly for most nut flours, weights vary slightly. For example, hazelnut flour is slightly denser than almond flour. Always check specific conversions when substituting in air fryer recipes, as cooking times may need adjustment for different nut flours."
faqQ3: "How do I adjust air fryer temperature when using ground almonds?"
faqA3: "Ground almonds brown quickly in air fryers due to their high fat content. When using 1.25 cups (4.5 ounces), reduce temperature by 10-15Â°C from standard recipes. Watch closely during cooking, as almond coatings can go from golden to burnt quickly in the concentrated heat of an air fryer."
faqQ4: "Why does my almond coating fall off in the air fryer?"
faqA4: "This usually happens when the 1.25 cups to ounces ratio is off, making the coating too dry or too wet. Ensure proper measurement and consider adding an egg wash for adhesion. Also, preheat your air fryer and lightly spray the basket with oil to help coatings stick better during cooking."

faqQ1: "Does the type of onion affect the weight per cup?"
faqA1: "Yes, but minimally. Red, white, and yellow onions have similar densities, so 1.75 cups will still be close to 7 ounces. Shallots or spring onions are lighter—use 10-15% more by volume for the same weight."
faqQ2: "Can I use frozen chopped onions instead of fresh?"
faqA2: "Absolutely! Thaw and drain frozen onions first, as they release water. Measure by weight (7 ounces) rather than cups for accuracy. Frozen onions work well in air fryer dishes like frittatas or savoury tarts."
faqQ3: "How should I chop onions for the most accurate cup measurement?"
faqA3: "For consistent 1.75 cup (7 ounce) measures, dice onions to roughly 1cm pieces. Avoid packing them tightly into the cup—let them sit loosely. A coarse chop works too, but may leave more air gaps between pieces."
faqQ4: "What if my recipe uses grams instead of ounces?"
faqA4: "7 ounces equals about 198 grams. Most kitchen scales toggle between units. For metric recipes, this conversion ensures precision—especially important in air frying where ingredient ratios affect texture and cooking time."

<p>1.75 cups of chopped onion equals approximately 7 ounces (198 grams). This measurement is essential for air fryer recipes, ensuring consistent results whether you're caramelising onions or adding them to a stir-fry. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we know precise measurements make all the difference in cooking.</p>

<h2>Why accurate onion measurements matter in air frying</h2>
<p>Using the right amount of onion ensures even cooking and perfect flavour distribution in your air fryer dishes. Too little, and your meal might lack depth; too much, and the onions could steam instead of crisp. For recipes like air-fried onion rings or stuffed peppers, 1.75 cups (7 ounces) is a common quantity. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for other handy measurements.</p>

<p>Onions vary in density based on how they're chopped—finely diced onions pack more tightly than roughly sliced ones. That's why weight measurements (ounces) are more reliable than volume (cups) for consistency. If you're adapting a recipe from cups to ounces, this 1.75 cups to ounces conversion will save time and guesswork.</p>

<h2>How to measure 1.75 cups of onion accurately</h2>
<p>For the most precise 1.75 cups (7 ounces) of onion, use a kitchen scale. Simply chop your onions, place them in a bowl on the scale, and add until you hit 7 ounces. No scale? Lightly fill a measuring cup with chopped onions without packing them down. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipes section</a> features dishes where this measurement shines, like French onion soup or blooming onions.</p>

<h3>Types of onions and their weight differences</h3>
<p>Not all onions weigh the same—1.75 cups of red onion might slightly differ from white or yellow onions due to moisture content. However, the 7-ounce approximation works well for most varieties. If you're using spring onions or shallots, adjust quantities as they’re lighter.

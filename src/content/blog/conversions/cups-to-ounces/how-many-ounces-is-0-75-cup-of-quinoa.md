faqQ1: "Can I use 0.75 cup of quinoa for air fryer baking?"
faqA1: "Absolutely! 0.75 cup of quinoa (5.3 ounces) works well for air fryer baking, such as quinoa muffins or crispy quinoa crackers. Just ensure you adjust cooking times slightly, as quinoa can dry out faster in the air fryer than in an oven. Pre-soaking the quinoa for 15 minutes helps retain moisture."
faqQ2: "How does 0.75 cup of quinoa compare to rice in an air fryer?"
faqA2: "0.75 cup of quinoa (5.3 ounces) cooks faster than rice in the air fryer, typically in 12-15 minutes versus 20-25 for rice. Quinoa also requires slightly less liquid—1.5 cups per 0.75 cup quinoa versus 2 cups for rice. Both work well, but quinoa offers a protein boost and nuttier flavour."
faqQ3: "Is 0.75 cup of quinoa enough for two people?"
faqA3: "0.75 cup of quinoa yields about 2.25 cups cooked, which is enough for two light servings or one generous portion. For heartier meals, pair it with proteins or vegetables from our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipes</a>. Double the amount if serving as a main dish."
faqQ4: "Why does my air fryer quinoa sometimes turn out soggy?"
faqA4: "Sogginess usually means too much liquid or overcrowding. For 0.75 cup quinoa (5.3 ounces), use exactly 1.5 cups liquid and spread it evenly in the air fryer basket. Ensure your air fryer isn’t overloaded—cook in batches if needed. Proper rinsing also prevents excess starch from causing mushiness."

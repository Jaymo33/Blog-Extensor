faqQ1: "Can I use a kitchen scale instead of measuring cups for pumpkin seeds?"
faqA1: "Absolutely! A kitchen scale is more accurate for measuring pumpkin seeds. Simply set it to ounces and measure out 10 ounces for 2 cups. This method eliminates packing inconsistencies and ensures precision in your air fryer recipes."
faqQ2: "Do roasted pumpkin seeds weigh the same as raw ones?"
faqA2: "Roasted pumpkin seeds may weigh slightly less due to moisture loss, but the difference is minimal. For most recipes, you can use the same 2 cups = 10 ounces conversion. Just keep an eye on cooking times, as roasted seeds crisp up faster."
faqQ3: "How long should I air fry 2 cups of pumpkin seeds?"
faqA3: "At 350°F (175°C), roast 2 cups (10 ounces) of pumpkin seeds for 8–10 minutes, shaking the basket halfway. They’re done when golden and fragrant. Adjust time based on your air fryer model and desired crunch level."
faqQ4: "Can I substitute sunflower seeds for pumpkin seeds in air fryer recipes?"
faqA4: "Yes, but note that sunflower seeds are lighter—2 cups weigh about 9 ounces. Adjust measurements slightly and monitor cooking time, as they may roast faster. Both seeds work well in <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>air fryer recipes</a> for added texture."

faqQ1: "How do I measure 3 cups of sunflower oil without a measuring cup?"
faqA1: "If you don’t have a measuring cup, use a standard drinking glass (8 oz) to estimate. Three cups equal 24 oz, so you’d need three full 8-oz glasses. For more precision, a kitchen scale set to fluid ounces can help."
faqQ2: "Can I use 3 cups of sunflower oil in any air fryer?"

faqQ3: "How long does 3 cups of sunflower oil last in an air fryer?"
faqA3: "Properly stored, 3 cups of sunflower oil can be reused 2-3 times. Strain it after each use and store in an airtight container. Discard if it smells off or becomes cloudy."
faqQ4: "What’s the best substitute for sunflower oil in air fryer recipes?"
faqA4: "Canola or vegetable oil works well as a substitute for sunflower oil. Both have high smoke points and neutral flavours. Avoid butter or olive oil for high-heat air frying, as they burn easily."

faqQ1: "Can I use a kitchen scale instead of measuring cups for almond butter?"
faqA1: "Absolutely! A kitchen scale is the most accurate way to measure almond butter, especially for air fryer recipes. Simply set your scale to ounces, tare the container, and scoop until you reach 10.64 ounces for 1.33 cups. This method eliminates packing inconsistencies and ensures precision."
faqQ2: "Does the type of almond butter affect the weight per cup?"
faqA2: "Yes, creamy and crunchy almond butter may have slight weight differences due to air incorporation. Homemade versions without stabilisers can also vary. For consistency, opt for commercial almond butter and measure by weight (ounces) rather than volume (cups) when possible."
faqQ3: "How do I convert other nut butter measurements to ounces?"
faqA3: "Most nut butters have similar densities, so 1 cup typically equals 8 ounces. However, always check specific recipes or use a kitchen scale for accuracy. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a> includes common nut butter measurements for quick reference."
faqQ4: "Why does my air fryer recipe fail when using almond butter?"
faqA4: "Air fryers require precise ingredient ratios due to rapid cooking. Too much almond butter can make batters heavy, leading to uneven cooking. Measure carefully (10.64 ounces for 1.33 cups) and adjust cooking times slightly if needed. Sticky ingredients also benefit from parchment linersâ€”find tips in our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/liners>liner guide</a>."

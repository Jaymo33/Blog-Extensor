<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on precise ingredient ratios to deliver crispy, evenly cooked results. Using the correct amount of single cream—like 0.75 cup converted to ounces—ensures your sauces, batters, and desserts have the right consistency. Too much or too little can affect texture and cooking times. For example, a creamy pasta sauce made in the air fryer needs the perfect balance of single cream to avoid splitting or becoming too thick. Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> for inspiration.</p>  

<p>Many UK cooks prefer weighing ingredients like single cream in ounces for accuracy, especially when scaling recipes up or down. A kitchen scale is a handy tool, but if you're using cups, knowing that 0.75 cup of single cream is 6 oz removes the guesswork. This is particularly useful for air fryer baking, where exact measurements can make or break your dish.</p>  

<h2>How to measure 0.75 cup of single cream correctly</h2>  
<p>To measure 0.75 cup of single cream, use a liquid measuring cup with clear markings. Fill it to the three-quarter line for accuracy, or weigh it to confirm it’s 6 oz. Single cream has a similar density to milk, so it’s easy to measure by volume or weight.

faqQ1: "Can I use regular cream instead of evaporated cream in air fryer recipes?"
faqA1: "Yes, but evaporated cream is thicker and richer, so you may need to adjust the quantity. Regular cream has a higher water content, which can affect the texture of your dish. If substituting, use slightly less regular cream or reduce other liquids in the recipe."
faqQ2: "How do I convert 0.5 cup of evaporated cream to grams?"
faqA2: "0.5 cup (4 ounces) of evaporated cream is roughly 113 grams. If your recipe calls for grams, use a kitchen scale for the most accurate measurement. This ensures your air fryer dishes have the perfect consistency every time."
faqQ3: "Does evaporated cream weigh the same as condensed milk?"
faqA3: "No, evaporated cream and condensed milk have different densities. Condensed milk is sweeter and thicker due to added sugar. Always check your recipe to see which ingredient is required, as they aren’t interchangeable without adjustments."
faqQ4: "Can I freeze leftover evaporated cream?"
faqA4: "Freezing isn’t recommended, as it can alter the texture and cause separation. Instead, store opened evaporated cream in the fridge and use it within a few days. For longer storage, consider smaller cans or powdered alternatives."

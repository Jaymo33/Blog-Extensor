<p>Converting 0.33 cup of semi skimmed milk to ounces is straightforward once you know the ratio. One cup of semi skimmed milk weighs about 8 ounces, so 0.33 cup is roughly 2.64 ounces. This conversion is especially useful for UK cooks who prefer using weight measurements for consistency.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure 0.33 Cup of Semi Skimmed Milk</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a measuring cup marked for 0.33 cup, you can use a standard 1/3 cup measure and fill it slightly less. Alternatively, weigh out 2.64 ounces on a kitchen scale for precision.

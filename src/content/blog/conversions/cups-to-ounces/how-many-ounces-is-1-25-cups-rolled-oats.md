faqQ1: "Can I use quick oats instead of rolled oats for 1.25 cups?"
faqA1: "Yes, but quick oats are finer and denser, so 1.25 cups will weigh slightly more (about 4 ounces). Adjust cooking times in your air fryer, as quick oats cook faster and may dry out if overdone."
faqQ2: "How do I store leftover rolled oats after measuring 1.25 cups?"
faqA2: "Transfer unused oats to an airtight container and keep them in a cool, dark place. Properly stored, they’ll stay fresh for up to 6 months. For longer storage, freeze them in a sealed bag."
faqQ3: "Why does my air fryer recipe with 1.25 cups of rolled oats turn out soggy?"
faqA3: "Sogginess often stems from overcrowding or insufficient air circulation. Spread oats evenly in the basket, and shake halfway through cooking. Also, ensure your oats are dry—moisture from humidity can affect texture."
faqQ4: "Is 1.25 cups of rolled oats the same as steel-cut oats in ounces?"
faqA4: "No, steel-cut oats are denser. 1.25 cups of steel-cut oats weigh about 4.5 ounces (128 grams). Adjust recipes accordingly, as they require longer cooking times and more liquid in the air fryer."

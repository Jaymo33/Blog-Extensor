faqQ1: "Can I use 0.125 cup of onion interchangeably with 1 ounce in recipes?"
faqA1: "Yes, for most practical purposes, 0.125 cup of onion is close enough to 1 ounce (0.99 oz) to use interchangeably in air fryer recipes. However, for baking or dishes requiring exact moisture levels, a kitchen scale is best."
faqQ2: "Does the type of onion affect the weight per 0.125 cup?"
faqA2: "Slightly—red onions are denser than sweet onions, so 0.125 cup may weigh a tad more. But the difference is minimal (under 0.1 oz), so you can generally use the same conversion across onion varieties."
faqQ3: "How should I store leftover chopped onion after measuring 0.125 cup?"
faqA3: "Store it in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 3 days. For longer storage, freeze it in portions—0.125 cup per bag—so it’s ready for future air fryer recipes."
faqQ4: "Why does my air fryer recipe call for ounces instead of cups for onions?"
faqA4: "Weight (ounces) ensures consistency, especially in air fryers where even cooking relies on uniform ingredient sizes. Cups can vary based on chop size, but ounces give you precision for perfect results every time."

<h2>Why Accurate Onion Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>When using an air fryer, consistency is key. Too much onion can lead to uneven cooking, while too little might leave your dish lacking flavour.

<p>Onions vary in density depending on how they're chopped—finely diced onions pack more tightly than roughly sliced ones. That’s why weight (ounces) is often more reliable than volume (cups) for air fryer cooking.

<h3>How to Measure 0.125 Cup of Onion</h3>

If using a scale, aim for just under 1 ounce (about 28 grams). This method works for all onion types, from red to white.</p>

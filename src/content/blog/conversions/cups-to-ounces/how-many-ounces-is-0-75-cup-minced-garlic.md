faqQ1: "Does 0.75 cup of minced garlic weigh the same as whole garlic cloves?"
faqA1: "No, 0.75 cup of minced garlic (6 ounces) is lighter than the same volume of whole cloves. Minced garlic packs more tightly, so weight varies. Whole cloves have air gaps, making them less dense."
faqQ2: "Can I use jarred minced garlic instead of fresh for air fryer recipes?"
faqA2: "Yes, jarred minced garlic works well and measures the same (6 ounces per 0.75 cup). However, fresh garlic often has a stronger flavour. Adjust seasoning to taste if substituting."
faqQ3: "How do I store leftover minced garlic for air fryer cooking?"
faqA3: "Store minced garlic in an airtight container in the fridge for up to a week. For longer storage, freeze it in portions. Thaw before using in recipes."
faqQ4: "Why does my air fryer recipe taste too garlicky?"
faqA4: "Using more than 0.75 cup (6 ounces) of minced garlic can overpower a dish. Measure carefully and balance with other flavours like herbs or citrus."

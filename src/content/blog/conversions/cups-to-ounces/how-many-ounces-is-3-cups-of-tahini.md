<p>3 cups of tahini equals approximately 24 ounces. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes, ensuring accurate measurements for perfect results every time. Whether you're making hummus, dressings, or baking, knowing the weight of tahini helps maintain consistency. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we focus on precise conversions to elevate your cooking. Keep reading for detailed tips and tricks.</p>

<h2>Why accurate tahini measurements matter</h2>  
<p>Using the correct amount of tahini ensures your dishes have the right texture and flavour. Too much can make dips overly thick, while too little may leave them bland.

Tahini’s density means volume-to-weight conversions are crucial. Stick to 24 ounces for 3 cups to avoid guesswork.</p>  

<p>Many home cooks struggle with conversions, leading to inconsistent results. A kitchen scale is the best tool for accuracy, especially with sticky ingredients like tahini. If you’re without one, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> simplifies the process. Remember, 1 cup of tahini equals roughly 8 ounces, making 3 cups 24 ounces.</p>  

<h3>How to measure tahini without a scale</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a scale, use the spoon-and-level method for semi-liquid ingredients like tahini. Stir the tahini first to ensure uniformity, then spoon it into a measuring cup. Level off the top with a straight edge for accuracy. This method works well for recipes on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert recipes</a>, where precision is key.</p>

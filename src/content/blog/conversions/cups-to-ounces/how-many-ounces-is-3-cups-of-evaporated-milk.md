faqQ1: "Is 3 cups of evaporated milk the same as 3 cups of regular milk in ounces?"
faqA1: "No, evaporated milk is more concentrated than regular milk. While both measure 24 fluid ounces per 3 cups, evaporated milk weighs slightly less (about 21.6 ounces) due to reduced water content. Always check your recipe to see if it specifies fluid ounces or weight ounces for accuracy."
faqQ2: "Can I use evaporated milk straight from the can in air fryer recipes?"
faqA2: "Yes, you can use evaporated milk directly from the can for most air fryer recipes. However, some recipes may call for reconstituting it with water first. Always check your specific recipe instructions, as undiluted evaporated milk will make your dish richer and thicker."
faqQ3: "How do I measure 3 cups of evaporated milk if I don't have measuring cups?"
faqA3: "If you don't have measuring cups, you can use a kitchen scale. Three cups of evaporated milk weigh approximately 21.6 ounces (612 grams). Alternatively, use a standard drinking glass (about 8 ounces) and fill it three-quarters full for each \"cup\" measurement."
faqQ4: "Why do some recipes specify fluid ounces versus weight ounces for evaporated milk?"
faqA4: "Fluid ounces measure volume, while weight ounces measure mass. Recipes may specify one or the other depending on whether precision in texture (weight) or liquid ratio (volume) is more important. For air fryer cooking, fluid ounces are typically used for liquids like evaporated milk."

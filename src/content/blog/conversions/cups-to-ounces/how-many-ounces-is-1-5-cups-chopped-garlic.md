faqQ1: "Can I use minced garlic instead of chopped for the 1.5 cups to ounces conversion?"
faqA1: "Yes, but minced garlic is denser, so 1.5 cups will weigh slightly more—around 13 ounces. Adjust recipes accordingly to avoid overpowering flavours. For air fryer dishes, minced garlic distributes more evenly, ideal for marinades or coatings."
faqQ2: "How long does 1.5 cups (12 oz) of chopped garlic last in the fridge?"
faqA2: "Stored in an airtight container, chopped garlic stays fresh for up to 7 days. For longer storage, freeze it in portions. Note: frozen garlic may soften slightly but works perfectly in cooked dishes like air-fryer stews or soups."
faqQ3: "Does the type of garlic affect the 1.5 cups to ounces conversion?"
faqA3: "Varieties like elephant garlic have larger cloves, so 1.5 cups may weigh less (about 10 oz). Standard white garlic is the benchmark for the 12-oz conversion. Always weigh for precision, especially in air fryer recipes."
faqQ4: "Can I substitute garlic powder for 1.5 cups of chopped garlic?"
faqA4: "Yes, but the ratio differs: 1 tablespoon of garlic powder equals about 3 cloves (roughly 1 oz). For 12 oz of chopped garlic, you’d need ~12 tablespoons. Adjust liquids in your recipe, as powder lacks moisture."

<p>1.5 cups of chopped garlic equals approximately 12 ounces. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes, where precise measurements can make or break a dish.

<h2>Why Accurate Garlic Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Garlic is a powerhouse of flavour, and even a slight variation can alter your dish’s taste. In air fryer cooking, where ingredients cook quickly, balance is key.

<h3>How to Measure Chopped Garlic Correctly</h3>  
<p>Chopped garlic can vary in density depending on how finely it’s minced. For the most accurate 1.5 cups to ounces conversion, lightly pack the garlic without crushing it. A kitchen scale is your best friend here—simply tare your bowl and measure until you hit 12 ounces. This method eliminates guesswork, especially for recipes like garlic bread or marinades.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for 1.5 Cups of Chopped Garlic</h2>  
<p>This quantity is ideal for batch cooking or flavourful bases. Think garlic butter for prawns, rubs for chicken, or sauces for pasta.

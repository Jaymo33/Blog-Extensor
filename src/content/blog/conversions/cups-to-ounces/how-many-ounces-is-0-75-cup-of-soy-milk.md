faqQ1: "Can I use almond milk instead of soy milk for 0.75 cup measurements?"
faqA1: "Yes, almond milk can substitute soy milk in a 1:1 ratio for 0.75 cup (6 oz). However, almond milk is slightly less dense, so the texture of your dish may vary. For best results in air fryer recipes, stick to unsweetened varieties unless the recipe specifies otherwise."
faqQ2: "How do I measure 0.75 cup of soy milk without a measuring cup?"
faqA2: "If you don’t have a measuring cup, use a kitchen scale to weigh out 6 ounces (170 grams) of soy milk. Alternatively, 0.75 cup is equivalent to 12 tablespoons or 180 millilitres. For air fryer recipes, precision is key, so investing in basic tools is worthwhile."
faqQ3: "Does the brand of soy milk affect the ounce measurement?"
faqA3: "Different brands may have slight variations in density due to additives or fortifications, but the difference is minimal. For 0.75 cup, 6 ounces remains a reliable standard. If using barista-style soy milk, note that it’s often thicker, so adjust other liquids accordingly in air fryer recipes."
faqQ4: "Why is my air fryer recipe soggy when using 0.75 cup of soy milk?"
faqA4: "Sogginess usually stems from overcrowding or insufficient preheating, not the soy milk itself. Ensure your air fryer is preheated and that you’re using the correct rack position. If the recipe includes other liquids, reduce them slightly to compensate for the soy milk’s moisture content."

<h2>Tips for measuring soy milk accurately</h2>  
<p>Always use a liquid measuring cup for soy milk, filling it to the 0.75 mark at eye level. For even greater precision, weigh it on a kitchen scale set to ounces.

After measuring, clean your air fryer basket with our recommended <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning solutions</a> to prevent residue buildup.</p>  

<p>If your recipe calls for heated soy milk, measure it cold first, then warm it separately. This prevents expansion, which could throw off your measurements.

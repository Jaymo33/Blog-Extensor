faqQ1: "Is 2.5 cups of greek yogurt the same as 20 ounces in the UK?"
faqA1: "Yes, 2.5 cups of greek yogurt equals approximately 20 ounces in the UK. The conversion remains consistent because weight measurements like ounces are universal. However, always use a kitchen scale for precision, especially in air fryer recipes where accuracy matters."
faqQ2: "Can I use regular yogurt instead of greek yogurt in air fryer recipes?"
faqA2: "You can substitute regular yogurt, but it has a thinner consistency and higher water content. For every 2.5 cups (20 ounces) of greek yogurt, you may need to adjust other liquids in the recipe. Greek yogurt’s thickness works better for coatings and marinades in air fryers."
faqQ3: "How do I store leftover greek yogurt after measuring 2.5 cups?"
faqA3: "Store leftover greek yogurt in an airtight container in the fridge for up to two weeks. Ensure the lid is sealed tightly to prevent absorption of other flavours. Stir well before reusing, as separation can occur over time."
faqQ4: "Why does my air fryer recipe call for greek yogurt by weight instead of volume?"
faqA4: "Weight measurements (like ounces) are more accurate than volume (cups) because greek yogurt’s density can vary. Air fryer recipes often specify weight to ensure consistent results, especially for coatings or batters where texture is crucial. A kitchen scale is your best tool for precision."

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of sesame seeds can make or break your dish. Too little, and you miss out on that rich, nutty flavour; too much, and it can overpower other ingredients. Air fryers rely on even distribution for consistent cooking, so measuring correctly ensures everything crisps up beautifully. If you're new to air frying, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a> has plenty of inspiration to get you started.</p>  

<p>Many home cooks assume volume measurements (like cups) are interchangeable with weight (like ounces), but density plays a big role. Sesame seeds are small and dense, so 1.75 cups weigh more than you might expect. Always use a kitchen scale for the most accurate results, especially when following air fryer recipes.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure Sesame Seeds Correctly</h3>  
<p>For the most precise conversion from cups to ounces, spoon the sesame seeds into your measuring cup rather than scooping. Scooping can compact them, leading to an inaccurate measurement. Level off the top with a straight edge for consistency.

faqQ1: "Can I use dried minced onion instead of fresh for 1.66 cups?"
faqA1: "Yes, but the weight differs. Dried minced onion is lighter: 1.66 cups ≈ 2.6 ounces (74g). Rehydrate it with water before using in air fryer recipes to avoid dryness. Adjust seasoning, as dried onion can be more concentrated in flavour."
faqQ2: "How do I store leftover minced onion?"
faqA2: "Store fresh minced onion in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 3 days. For longer storage, freeze it in 5.3-ounce (1.66-cup) portions. Thaw before using in air fryer recipes to prevent excess moisture."
faqQ3: "Does 1.66 cups of minced onion equal one large onion?"
faqA3: "Roughly, yes. One large onion yields about 1.5–2 cups when minced, so 1.66 cups is close. For precision in air fryer recipes, weigh it—5.3 ounces ensures consistency, especially for dishes like onion fritters."
faqQ4: "Why does my air fryer recipe taste too oniony?"
faqA4: "Overpacking the measuring cup can lead to excess onion. Stick to 5.3 ounces (1.66 cups) for balance. If the flavour’s still strong, reduce to 1 cup (3.2 oz) and add gradually. Air frying intensifies flavours, so less is often more."

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>

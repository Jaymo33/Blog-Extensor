faqQ1: "Can I use dried beans instead of canned beans in my air fryer?"
faqA1: "Yes, but dried beans require soaking and cooking before air frying. Canned beans are pre-cooked, making them quicker and easier to use. If substituting, 0.5 cup of cooked dried beans equals roughly 4 ounces, similar to canned."
faqQ2: "Do different types of canned beans weigh the same per cup?"
faqA2: "Most canned beans, like black beans or kidney beans, weigh about 8 ounces per cup (4 ounces for 0.5 cup). However, denser beans like chickpeas may vary slightly. Always drain and rinse for accurate measurements."
faqQ3: "How do I store leftover canned beans after measuring?"
faqA3: "Transfer unused beans to an airtight container and refrigerate for up to 3 days. For longer storage, freeze them in portion-sized bags. Reheat in the air fryer for 2-3 minutes when ready to use."
faqQ4: "Why is my air-fried canned beans recipe turning out soggy?"
faqA4: "Sogginess often comes from excess moisture. Ensure beans are thoroughly drained and patted dry before air frying. Preheat your air fryer and avoid overcrowding the basket for crispier results."

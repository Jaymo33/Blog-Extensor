faqQ1: "Why is caster sugar measurement different from granulated sugar in air fryer recipes?"
faqA1: "Caster sugar has a finer grain than granulated sugar, so it packs differently in measuring cups. This affects the weight-to-volume ratio, making accurate conversions like 1.33 cups to ounces essential. In air fryers, where heat distribution is intense, the right sugar measurement ensures even cooking and proper texture development."
faqQ2: "Can I use granulated sugar instead of caster sugar in air fryer recipes?"
faqA2: "While you can substitute granulated sugar, the texture and cooking results may vary. Granulated sugar is coarser, so 1.33 cups would weigh slightly more than caster sugar. For best results in air fryer baking, stick to the specified sugar type or adjust measurements accordingly using proper conversion charts."
faqQ3: "How do I measure 1.33 cups of caster sugar without a 1/3 cup measure?"
faqA3: "You can measure 1 cup plus 1/3 cup by using a 1/4 cup measure filled a bit over halfway. Alternatively, use the weight conversion (10.64 ounces) with a kitchen scale for perfect accuracy. This method is particularly helpful for air fryer recipes where precision matters most."
faqQ4: "Does humidity affect the 1.33 cups caster sugar to ounces conversion?"
faqA4: "Yes, humidity can cause caster sugar to clump and pack more densely in measuring cups. In humid conditions, it's better to weigh your sugar (10.64 ounces for 1.33 cups) rather than rely on volume measurements. This ensures consistent results in your air fryer baking, regardless of weather conditions."

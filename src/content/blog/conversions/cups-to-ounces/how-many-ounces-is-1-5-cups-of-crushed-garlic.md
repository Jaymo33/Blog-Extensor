faqQ1: "Can I use minced garlic instead of crushed garlic for 1.5 cups?"
faqA1: "Yes, but minced garlic is less dense, so you’ll need slightly less by weight. For 1.5 cups (12 oz) of crushed garlic, use about 10-11 oz of minced garlic. Adjust to taste, as minced garlic disperses more evenly in dishes."
faqQ2: "How do I store 1.5 cups of crushed garlic for later use?"
faqA2: "Store it in an airtight container in the fridge for up to a week, or freeze it in ice cube trays. Each cube (about 1 oz) makes it easy to portion out 12 oz (1.5 cups) when needed."
faqQ3: "Does 1.5 cups of crushed garlic equal 12 oz in the UK?"
faqA3: "Yes, the conversion is the same in the UK. Fluid ounces and weight ounces are nearly identical for crushed garlic, so 1.5 cups equals roughly 12 oz regardless of location."
faqQ4: "What air fryer recipes use 1.5 cups of crushed garlic?"
faqA4: "Try garlic butter shrimp, roasted garlic potatoes, or garlic herb bread. These dishes benefit from the bold flavour of 12 oz (1.5 cups) of crushed garlic. For more ideas, check our recipe collection."

<p>1.5 cups of crushed garlic equals approximately 12 ounces. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements ensure even cooking and perfect flavour.

<h2>Why measuring crushed garlic matters in air frying</h2>  
<p>Garlic’s intensity can vary based on how finely it’s crushed, making weight a more reliable measure than volume. In an air fryer, uneven distribution of garlic could lead to some bites being overpowering while others lack flavour. By converting 1.5 cups of crushed garlic to ounces, you ensure consistency. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for other common ingredient swaps.</p>  

<p>Recipes like garlic butter shrimp or crispy garlic potatoes rely on balanced seasoning. Too much garlic can burn, while too little might leave the dish bland. If you’re prepping ahead, storing crushed garlic by weight (like 12 ounces for 1.5 cups) keeps portions accurate.

<h3>How to measure crushed garlic correctly</h3>  
<p>Use a kitchen scale for the most accurate results. Lightly pack the crushed garlic into a measuring cup without pressing too hard, as this can compact it and skew the weight. If you don’t have a scale, remember that 1.5 cups of crushed garlic is roughly 12 ounces. This method works for UK measurements too, as fluid ounces and weight ounces align closely here.</p>  

<h2>Common recipes using 1.5 cups of crushed garlic</h2>

<h3>Adjusting for different garlic textures</h3>  
<p>Minced garlic weighs slightly less than crushed, so if substituting, reduce the amount by 1-2 ounces. Pureed garlic, on the other hand, is denser, so 1.5 cups could weigh closer to 14 ounces. Always tweak based on your preferred intensity and the recipe’s requirements.</p>

faqQ1: "Can I use a kitchen scale to measure 3 cups of fish sauce in ounces?"
faqA1: "Yes, but since fish sauce is a liquid, fluid ounces (volume) are more accurate than weight ounces. If using a scale, 3 cups (24 fl oz) of fish sauce weighs roughly 24 ounces by volume, but densities can vary slightly. For best results, stick to liquid measuring cups."
faqQ2: "Does the brand of fish sauce affect the 3-cups-to-ounces conversion?"
faqA2: "No, the conversion from 3 cups to 24 fluid ounces remains consistent across brands. However, different brands may vary in saltiness or thickness, which could affect your recipe’s flavour. Always taste and adjust seasonings as needed."
faqQ3: "How long does 3 cups (24 fl oz) of fish sauce last once opened?"
faqA3: "Opened fish sauce lasts about 12–18 months when stored properly in the fridge. Keep it in an airtight container to maintain freshness. If you notice any off smells or discoloration, it’s best to discard it."
faqQ4: "Can I substitute soy sauce for fish sauce in a 3-cup measurement?"
faqA4: "You can, but the flavour profile will differ. Use the same 24-fluid-ounce measurement, but expect a less umami-rich taste. For closer results, mix soy sauce with a bit of anchovy paste or Worcestershire sauce. Adjust seasonings to taste."

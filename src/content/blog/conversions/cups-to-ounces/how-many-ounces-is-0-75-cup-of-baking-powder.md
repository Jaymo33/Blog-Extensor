faqQ1: "Can I use grams instead of ounces for 0.75 cup of baking powder?"
faqA1: "Yes, 0.75 cup of baking powder is roughly 170 grams. Many UK bakers prefer grams for precision, especially in air fryer recipes where small changes affect texture. A digital kitchen scale will give you the most accurate results."
faqQ2: "Does the type of baking powder affect the weight per cup?"
faqA2: "Most commercial baking powders weigh similarly, but double-acting varieties might be slightly denser. Always check the brand’s packaging for specific weight guidelines. For air fryer recipes, stick to the standard 6 ounces (170g) per 0.75 cup unless stated otherwise."
faqQ3: "How do I adjust 0.75 cup of baking powder for high-altitude baking in an air fryer?"
faqA3: "At high altitudes, reduce baking powder by 1/8 to 1/4 teaspoon per cup to prevent over-rising. For 0.75 cup (6 oz), that’s about 0.5 teaspoon less. Air fryers already cook faster, so this tweak helps avoid collapsed cakes or breads."
faqQ4: "What if my air fryer recipe uses tablespoons instead of cups?"
faqA4: "0.75 cup of baking powder equals 12 tablespoons or 36 teaspoons. If your air fryer recipe requires smaller quantities, measure carefully—each tablespoon is 0.5 ounces. For mini batches, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a> includes scaled-down options."

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Baking</h2>  
<p>Baking powder is a leavening agent, and even small measurement errors can affect how your air fryer recipes rise. Too much can leave a bitter taste, while too little may result in dense, flat baked goods. Converting 0.75 cup of baking powder to ounces (6 oz) ensures you get the right balance. If you’re experimenting with air fryer cakes or muffins, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> for foolproof ideas.</p>  

<p>Air fryers cook differently than conventional ovens, so precision is key. Unlike traditional baking, where slight variations might go unnoticed, air fryers amplify inconsistencies due to their rapid heat circulation. That’s why we recommend using a kitchen scale for dry ingredients like baking powder.

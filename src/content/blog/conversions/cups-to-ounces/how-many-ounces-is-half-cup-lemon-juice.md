faqQ1: "Is 0.5 cup of lemon juice the same as 4 ounces?"
faqA1: "Yes, 0.5 cup of lemon juice equals 4 fluid ounces. This measurement is consistent for both US and UK recipes, though UK cups are slightly larger by volume. For air fryer cooking, using fluid ounces ensures precision, especially in marinades or dressings where balance is key."
faqQ2: "How many lemons do I need for 0.5 cup (4 oz) of juice?"
faqA2: "You’ll need about 3–4 medium lemons to yield 0.5 cup (4 oz) of juice. Each lemon typically provides 1–1.5 ounces. For accuracy, use a juicer and measure with a liquid cup rather than relying solely on lemon count, as size and ripeness affect yield."
faqQ3: "Can I use bottled lemon juice instead of fresh for air fryer recipes?"
faqA3: "Bottled lemon juice works in a pinch, but it may have a stronger or more concentrated flavour. If substituting, start with slightly less than 0.5 cup (about 3.5 oz) and adjust to taste. Fresh juice is preferred for its brightness, especially in dishes like air-fried seafood or dressings."
faqQ4: "Does lemon juice affect cooking times in the air fryer?"
faqA4: "Lemon juice can add moisture, which might slightly extend cooking times for crispy foods. For best results, pat marinated items dry before air frying or add lemon juice later in the process. In desserts, it’s usually mixed into batters, so timing remains unchanged."

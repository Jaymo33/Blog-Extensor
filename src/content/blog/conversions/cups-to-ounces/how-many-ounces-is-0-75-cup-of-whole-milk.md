faqQ1: "Is 0.75 cup of whole milk the same as 6 fluid ounces?"
faqA1: "Yes, 0.75 cup of whole milk is approximately 6 fluid ounces. However, if you're measuring by weight, whole milk is slightly denser due to its fat content, so it may weigh closer to 6.45 ounces. For most recipes, the difference is negligible."
faqQ2: "Can I use skim milk instead of whole milk in this measurement?"
faqA2: "Yes, you can substitute skim milk, but keep in mind it has less fat and may affect the texture of your dish. The volume (0.75 cup) will still equal about 6 ounces, but the final result might be less creamy."
faqQ3: "How do I measure 0.75 cup of whole milk without a measuring cup?"
faqA3: "If you don't have a measuring cup, use a kitchen scale to weigh out 6 ounces of whole milk. Alternatively, you can estimate using a standard mug—fill it just under three-quarters full."
faqQ4: "Why do air fryer recipes often use 0.75 cup of whole milk?"
faqA4: "Many air fryer recipes, like batters and sauces, use 0.75 cup of whole milk because it provides enough liquid for even cooking without making the dish too wet. It's a versatile measurement that works well for both savoury and sweet dishes."

<h2>Why accurate milk measurements matter</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of whole milk in your air fryer recipes ensures the perfect texture and flavour. Too little milk can dry out your dish, while too much may make it soggy.

<p>Whole milk has a density of about 8.6 ounces per cup, so 0.75 cup translates to roughly 6 ounces. This is particularly useful for recipes like custards or batters, where consistency is key.

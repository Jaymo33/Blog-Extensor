faqQ1: "Does the type of garlic affect the 1.75 cups to ounces conversion?"
faqA1: "The conversion from 1.75 cups to approximately 14 ounces applies to standard minced garlic. While different garlic varieties (like elephant garlic) may vary slightly in density, the difference is minimal for most recipes. Freshly minced garlic and pre-packaged minced garlic have similar volume-to-weight ratios."
faqQ2: "Can I use this conversion for chopped garlic instead of minced?"
faqA2: "Chopped garlic is slightly less dense than minced garlic, so 1.75 cups of chopped garlic might weigh a bit less than 14 ounces. For precise measurements, it's best to weigh your chopped garlic. However, in most air fryer recipes, the small difference won't significantly impact the final dish."
faqQ3: "How long does 1.75 cups of minced garlic last in the fridge?"
faqA3: "Properly stored in an airtight container, 1.75 cups (14 ounces) of minced garlic will last about 1-2 weeks in the refrigerator. For longer storage, freeze the minced garlic in portions. The flavour may intensify over time, so you might need to adjust quantities in recipes if using older minced garlic."
faqQ4: "Is 1.75 cups of minced garlic too much for air fryer recipes?"
faqA4: "1.75 cups (14 ounces) of minced garlic is quite a large quantity, suitable for batch cooking or marinades. For single air fryer meals, you'll typically use much less - often just 1-2 tablespoons. Always consider your recipe size and personal taste preferences when measuring garlic for air fryer dishes."

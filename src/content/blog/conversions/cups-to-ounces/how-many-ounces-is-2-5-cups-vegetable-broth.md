faqQ1: "Can I use stock instead of broth when measuring 2.5 cups?"
faqA1: "Yes, you can substitute stock for broth in equal amounts (2.5 cups = 20 oz). Stock is typically richer, so you may want to dilute it slightly with water for a milder flavour. Both work well in air fryer recipes, but check sodium levels if dietary concerns apply."
faqQ2: "How do I measure 2.5 cups of broth without a measuring cup?"
faqA2: "Use a standard mug (about 1 cup) and fill it 2.5 times, or weigh 20 oz on a kitchen scale. For UK cooks, 2.5 cups equals approximately 591 ml if using a metric measuring jug. Just ensure your container’s size is consistent for accuracy."
faqQ3: "Does the type of vegetable broth affect the ounce measurement?"
faqA3: "The fluid ounces (20 oz per 2.5 cups) remain consistent, but thicker broths may weigh more. Clear broths and reduced-sodium versions measure the same by volume. For creamy varieties, consider weighing for precision in air fryer recipes."
faqQ4: "How long does 2.5 cups of vegetable broth last in the fridge?"
faqA4: "Store-bought broth lasts 4-5 days refrigerated after opening. Homemade broth should be used within 3 days or frozen in 20 oz portions. Always check for off smells before using in air fryer recipes. Freezing preserves quality for up to 3 months."

<p>2.5 cups of vegetable broth equals 20 fluid ounces (or approximately 20 oz by weight for most broths). This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes, where precise measurements can make or break a dish. Whether you’re making soups, stews, or marinades, knowing how to convert cups to ounces ensures your meals turn out perfectly every time.</p>

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on precise ingredient ratios to achieve the best texture and flavour. Too much or too little liquid, like vegetable broth, can affect cooking times and results. For example, a <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>vegetable broth-based marinade</a> for chicken needs the right consistency to coat evenly without making the meat soggy. Accurate measurements also help when scaling recipes up or down, ensuring consistency across batches.</p>  

<p>If you’re using a UK air fryer model, note that fluid ounces (fl oz) are the standard measurement for liquids. While 2.5 cups of vegetable broth is 20 fl oz, the weight in ounces may vary slightly depending on the broth’s density. For most recipes, this difference is negligible, but it’s worth double-checking if precision is critical.</p>  

<h3>How to measure vegetable broth for air fryer recipes</h3>  
<p>Use a liquid measuring cup for the most accurate results. Fill it to the 2.5-cup mark, ensuring the broth sits level at eye height. If you’re converting from a recipe that lists broth in grams, note that 20 fl oz is roughly 591 ml.

<h2>Common uses for 2.5 cups of vegetable broth</h2>  
<p>This quantity is perfect for air fryer dishes like mushroom risotto, braised vegetables, or a flavourful base for <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/potatoes>air-fried potatoes</a>. It’s also ideal for deglazing the air fryer basket after cooking meats, adding depth to sauces. Since vegetable broth is low in calories but high in flavour, it’s a staple for healthier air fryer meals.</p>  

<p>For meal preppers, 2.5 cups (20 oz) of broth can be portioned into smaller containers for weekly use. Freeze it in ice cube trays for easy access to small amounts. This trick works wonders for adding moisture to <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/frozen-foods>frozen foods</a> like veggie burgers or dumplings without making them soggy.</p>  

<h3>Adjusting recipes that call for 2.5 cups of broth</h3>  
<p>If a recipe requires 20 oz of broth but you only have stock cubes, dissolve one cube in 2.5 cups of hot water. For reduced-sodium versions, use less water or add herbs to boost flavour. Remember to clean your air fryer after cooking with broth to prevent residue buildup – our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning guide</a> has handy tips.</p>  

<h2>Converting other broth quantities to ounces</h2>  
<p>Need to scale up or down? Here’s a quick reference: 1 cup of vegetable broth equals 8 fl oz, so 3 cups would be 24 oz. For smaller amounts, ½ cup is 4 oz. These conversions are handy when adapting recipes for different air fryer sizes or portion needs. Always measure liquids at room temperature for the most accurate results.</p>  

<p>For thicker broths or stocks, the weight in ounces may differ slightly from the fluid volume. If precision is key, weigh 2.5 cups of your specific broth on a kitchen scale – it should be close to 20 oz unless it’s unusually dense. This step is especially useful for creamy soups or bisques used in air fryer cooking.</p>

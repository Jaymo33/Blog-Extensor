faqQ1: "Can I use crunchy peanut butter instead of smooth for 0.375 cup measurements?"
faqA1: "Yes, crunchy and smooth peanut butter weigh the same per cup, so 0.375 cup equals 3 oz for both. The texture difference won’t affect the weight, though it may alter the dish’s final consistency slightly."
faqQ2: "How do I measure 0.375 cup of peanut butter without a scale?"
faqA2: "Use a dry measuring cup and pack the peanut butter tightly, levelling the top with a knife. For 0.375 cup, fill a 1/2 cup measure halfway, then remove 1/8 cup. Alternatively, use tablespoons (0.375 cup = 6 tbsp)."
faqQ3: "Does natural peanut butter measure the same as regular peanut butter?"
faqA3: "Natural peanut butter may separate, so stir it well before measuring. Once mixed, 0.375 cup still equals 3 oz. If using oil-free versions, check for denser textures that might pack differently."
faqQ4: "Why is weighing peanut butter better than using cups in air fryer recipes?"
faqA4: "Weight (ounces) is more precise because peanut butter’s density varies with brand and temperature. Air fryers cook quickly, so accurate measurements prevent under- or overcooking. A kitchen scale ensures consistency every time."

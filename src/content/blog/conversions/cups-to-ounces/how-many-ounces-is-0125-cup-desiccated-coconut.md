faqQ1: "Can I use shredded coconut instead of desiccated coconut in air fryer recipes?"
faqA1: "Yes, but shredded coconut has a higher moisture content and may affect texture. For 0.125 cup measurements, reduce slightly to account for the difference. Desiccated coconut works best for even crisping in air fryers."
faqQ2: "How do I store leftover desiccated coconut after measuring 0.125 cup?"
faqA2: "Keep it in an airtight container in a cool, dark place. Properly stored, desiccated coconut lasts up to 6 months. For longer storage, freeze it in portioned bags to maintain freshness."
faqQ3: "Why does my air-fried coconut topping burn before the dish is cooked?"
faqA3: "Coconut browns quickly due to its sugar content. Add it halfway through cooking or cover with foil initially. Lowering the temperature by 10°C can also prevent burning while ensuring even cooking."
faqQ4: "Can I substitute 0.125 cup desiccated coconut with coconut flour in air fryer recipes?"
faqA4: "No, coconut flour absorbs much more liquid and won’t crisp the same way. If substituting, use 1 tablespoon coconut flour for every 0.125 cup desiccated coconut, and adjust liquids in the recipe accordingly."

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on even heat distribution, so ingredient quantities must be spot-on. Too much desiccated coconut can lead to uneven cooking or a dry texture. Conversely, too little might leave your dish lacking in flavour. This is especially crucial for recipes like coconut-crusted shrimp or air-fried desserts.

<p>Desiccated coconut is lighter than many assume, so volume-to-weight conversions are key. A 0.125 cup measurement is common in smaller batches or when testing new recipes. If you're scaling up, remember that 1 cup of desiccated coconut equals roughly 4 ounces. This ratio helps maintain consistency across your cooking.</p>  

<h3>How to measure 0.125 cup of desiccated coconut</h3>  
<p>Use a dry measuring cup for accuracy, gently spooning the coconut in without packing it down. Level off the top with a straight edge for a precise 0.125 cup (or 2 tablespoons). For those who prefer weight, a kitchen scale set to ounces eliminates guesswork. This method is foolproof for recipes like coconut-crusted chicken or air-fried banana bread.</p>

faqQ1: "How do I measure 3 cups of almonds without a scale?"
faqA1: "Lightly spoon almonds into a measuring cup without packing them down. Avoid tapping the cup, as this compacts the almonds and leads to an inaccurate measurement. For best results, fluff the almonds with a fork before measuring."
faqQ2: "Do whole and sliced almonds weigh the same per cup?"
faqA2: "No, whole almonds and sliced almonds have different weights per cup due to air gaps. Whole almonds weigh around 4 ounces per cup, while sliced almonds are closer to 3.3 ounces per cup. Always check your recipe for the correct form."
faqQ3: "Can I use almond flour instead of whole almonds in air fryer recipes?"
faqA3: "Yes, but you’ll need to adjust the quantity. Almond flour is more densely packed, so 3 cups would weigh significantly more than whole almonds. Refer to your recipe for specific conversions or use a kitchen scale for accuracy."
faqQ4: "How long do roasted almonds last in an airtight container?"
faqA4: "Roasted almonds stay fresh for up to 2 weeks in an airtight container at room temperature. For longer storage, freeze them for up to 6 months. Always let them cool completely before sealing to prevent moisture buildup."

<p>Almonds are a versatile ingredient, adding crunch and nutrition to meals. Whether you're using sliced, whole, or ground almonds, measuring by weight (ounces) is often more reliable than volume (cups). This is especially true for air fryer cooking, where even heat distribution is crucial.</p>  

<h2>How to Measure Almonds Correctly</h2>  
<p>For the most accurate results, use a kitchen scale to weigh your almonds. If you don’t have one, lightly spoon almonds into a measuring cup without packing them down. Avoid tapping the cup, as this compacts the almonds and skews the measurement. For more air fryer tips, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a>.</p>  

<h3>Whole vs. Sliced Almonds</h3>

<h3>Storing Almonds for Freshness</h3>  
<p>To keep almonds fresh, store them in an airtight container in a cool, dark place. For longer storage, freeze them in a sealed bag. Proper storage ensures your almonds stay crisp and ready for your next air fryer creation.</p>

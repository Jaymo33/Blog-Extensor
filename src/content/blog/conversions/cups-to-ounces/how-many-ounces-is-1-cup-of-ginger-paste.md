faqQ1: "Can I use fresh ginger instead of ginger paste in my air fryer recipes?"
faqA1: "Yes, you can substitute fresh ginger for ginger paste. Use about 1 tablespoon of freshly grated ginger for every 8.5 ounces of ginger paste. Fresh ginger has a brighter, more intense flavour, so adjust to taste."
faqQ2: "How long does ginger paste last in the fridge?"
faqA2: "Homemade ginger paste lasts about 2-3 weeks in the fridge if stored properly. Store-bought versions may last longer due to preservatives. Always check for signs of spoilage, like mould or off smells."
faqQ3: "Is there a difference between UK and US ounces for measuring ginger paste?"
faqA3: "No, both UK and US use the same fluid ounce measurement for liquids like ginger paste. However, always double-check your measuring tools to ensure accuracy, especially when following international recipes."
faqQ4: "Can I freeze ginger paste for later use?"
faqA4: "Absolutely! Freezing ginger paste in ice cube trays or small portions makes it easy to use later. Thaw what you need, and it'll work just as well in your air fryer recipes. This is a great time-saving tip for busy cooks."

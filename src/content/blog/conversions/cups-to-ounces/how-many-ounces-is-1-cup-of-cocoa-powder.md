<p>1 cup of cocoa powder equals approximately 3.5 ounces (100 grams) in the UK. This measurement is essential for baking, especially when using an air fryer for desserts like brownies or cakes. Accurate conversions ensure your recipes turn out perfectly every time.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate cocoa powder measurements matter</h2>  
<p>Using the correct weight for cocoa powder ensures your baked goods have the right texture and flavour. Too much can make desserts bitter, while too little might leave them bland. For air fryer recipes, precision is even more critical due to the appliance’s rapid cooking style.</p>  
<p>If you’re adapting a recipe from cups to ounces, always check whether it uses US or UK measurements. UK cups are slightly different, so sticking to weight (ounces or grams) avoids confusion. Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more handy tips.</p>  

<h3>How to measure cocoa powder correctly</h3>  
<p>For the most accurate results, use a kitchen scale to weigh your cocoa powder. Scooping directly from the bag can compact the powder, leading to uneven measurements. Lightly spooning it into a cup and levelling it off works if you don’t have scales.</p>  

<h2>Common cocoa powder conversions</h2>  
<p>Here’s a quick reference for converting 1 cup of cocoa powder to other units:</p>  
<ul>

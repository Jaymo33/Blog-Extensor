faqQ1: "Can I use minced garlic instead of garlic paste in my air fryer recipe?"
faqA1: "Yes, but you’ll need to adjust the quantity. Minced garlic is less dense than paste, so 0.5 cup of minced garlic weighs around 3 ounces instead of 4.5 ounces. For best results, use a kitchen scale to match the recipe’s requirements."
faqQ2: "How long does garlic paste last in the fridge?"
faqA2: "Homemade garlic paste lasts about 1-2 weeks in the fridge if stored in an airtight container. Store-bought varieties often contain preservatives and can last up to a month. Always check for off smells or discolouration before use."
faqQ3: "Does garlic paste burn easily in the air fryer?"
faqA3: "Garlic paste can burn if exposed to high heat for too long. To prevent this, mix it with oils or liquids when marinating, or add it later in the cooking process. Keeping the air fryer temperature moderate (around 160°C) helps avoid scorching."
faqQ4: "Can I freeze garlic paste for later use?"
faqA4: "Absolutely! Freeze garlic paste in ice cube trays for easy portioning. Each cube holds about 1 tablespoon (0.5 oz), making it simple to thaw only what you need. Frozen garlic paste retains its flavour for up to 3 months."

<p>0.5 cup of garlic paste equals approximately 4.5 ounces (or 4.5 oz) in weight. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements can make or break your dish. Whether you're whipping up a marinade or seasoning meats, knowing the exact weight ensures consistent results every time. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we focus on helping you get the most out of your air fryer with accurate conversions.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Garlic Paste Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of garlic paste can elevate your air fryer dishes from good to great. Too little, and your food might lack flavour; too much, and it could become overpowering. Garlic paste is denser than minced garlic, so volume-to-weight conversions like 0.5 cup to ounces are crucial. For recipes like garlic butter shrimp or marinated chicken, precision ensures balanced taste. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> for inspiration on using garlic paste perfectly.</p>  

<p>Many home cooks assume that 0.5 cup of garlic paste is the same as minced garlic, but this isn’t the case. The paste’s consistency means it packs more densely, affecting weight. If you’re converting from a recipe that uses minced garlic, you’ll need to adjust accordingly. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> can help you switch between measurements effortlessly.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure 0.5 Cup of Garlic Paste</h3>  
<p>To measure 0.5 cup of garlic paste accurately, use a liquid measuring cup for ease. Scoop the paste gently, levelling it off with a knife to avoid excess. If you don’t have measuring cups, a kitchen scale set to ounces will give you the exact 4.5 oz equivalent. This method is especially handy for air fryer cooking, where consistency is key.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for Garlic Paste in Air Fryer Recipes</h2>  
<p>Garlic paste is a staple in many air fryer dishes, from marinades to sauces. Its smooth texture blends seamlessly, ensuring even distribution of flavour. Try it in garlic bread, roasted vegetables, or as a base for meat rubs. For more ideas, browse our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipes</a>, where garlic paste often plays a starring role.</p>  

<p>Another great use for garlic paste is in homemade dips and spreads. Mix it with yoghurt or mayo for a quick sauce to accompany air-fried snacks. Since 0.5 cup of garlic paste equals 4.5 ounces, you can easily scale recipes up or down. Don’t forget to clean your air fryer after cooking with strong flavours—our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning guide</a> has handy tips.</p>  

<h3>Converting Other Garlic Measurements</h3>  
<p>If your recipe calls for fresh garlic or minced garlic instead of paste, conversions are simple. One clove of garlic is roughly equivalent to half a teaspoon of paste. For larger quantities, 0.5 cup of minced garlic weighs less than paste due to air pockets. Always double-check conversions to avoid recipe mishaps.</p>

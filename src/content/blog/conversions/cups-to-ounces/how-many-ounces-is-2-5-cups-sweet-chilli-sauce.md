faqQ1: "Can I use a UK measuring cup for 2.5 cups of sweet chilli sauce?"
faqA1: "Yes, UK and US standard cup measurements are virtually identical for liquid ingredients like sweet chilli sauce. Whether you're using 2.5 UK cups or 2.5 US cups, the ounce conversion remains the same at approximately 20 fluid ounces."
faqQ2: "How does the thickness of sweet chilli sauce affect the ounce measurement?"
faqA2: "Thicker sauces may slightly increase the weight per cup, but the difference is minimal for most cooking purposes. For 2.5 cups of standard sweet chilli sauce, you can reliably use the 20-ounce conversion. If using an extra-thick brand, consider weighing it for precision."
faqQ3: "What's the best way to measure 2.5 cups of sweet chilli sauce without a measuring cup?"
faqA3: "If you don't have measuring cups, use a kitchen scale to weigh out 20 ounces of sauce. Alternatively, a standard UK mug holds about 250ml (just under 1.25 cups), so two mugs would give you roughly 2.5 cups. For accuracy, we recommend proper measuring tools."
faqQ4: "Can I freeze leftover sweet chilli sauce after measuring out 2.5 cups?"
faqA4: "Absolutely! Sweet chilli sauce freezes well for up to 3 months. Portion it into ice cube trays or small containers for easy use in future air fryer recipes. Thaw in the fridge overnight and stir well before using to restore the original consistency."

<p>2.5 cups of sweet chilli sauce equals approximately 20 fluid ounces (or 20 oz). This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements can make or break your dish. Whether you're marinating chicken wings or glazing shrimp, knowing the exact weight ensures consistent results every time.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on even heat distribution, and incorrect ingredient quantities can lead to uneven cooking or overly saucy dishes.

<h2>How to measure sweet chilli sauce correctly</h2>  
<p>Liquid ingredients like sweet chilli sauce should be measured in a clear, liquid measuring cup for accuracy. Fill to the 2.5-cup mark at eye level, ensuring no air bubbles distort the measurement. For thicker sauces, gently stir to remove trapped air before pouring.</p>  

<h3>Using a kitchen scale for precision</h3>

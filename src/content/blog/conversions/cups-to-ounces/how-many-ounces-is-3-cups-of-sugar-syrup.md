faqQ1: "Can I use honey instead of sugar syrup in air fryer recipes?"
faqA1: "Yes, honey can substitute sugar syrup in most recipes, but it’s thicker and sweeter. Use 3/4 cup of honey for every 1 cup of sugar syrup (18 ounces for 3 cups). Adjust cooking times slightly, as honey may caramelise faster in the air fryer."
faqQ2: "Why does my sugar syrup measurement vary slightly each time?"
faqA2: "Variations can occur due to temperature or how the syrup settles in the cup. For accuracy, weigh it in ounces—3 cups should consistently be 24 ounces. A kitchen scale eliminates guesswork and ensures recipe reliability."
faqQ3: "How do I clean my air fryer after using sticky sugar syrup?"
faqA3: "Wipe the basket with warm, soapy water immediately after use. For stubborn residue, soak the parts in vinegar and water. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning guide</a> has step-by-step tips to keep your air fryer spotless."
faqQ4: "Can I reduce the amount of sugar syrup in a recipe for health reasons?"
faqA4: "Absolutely! Replace half the sugar syrup with unsweetened applesauce or a sugar-free alternative. Just note that texture and browning may differ. Experiment with small batches to find your preferred balance."

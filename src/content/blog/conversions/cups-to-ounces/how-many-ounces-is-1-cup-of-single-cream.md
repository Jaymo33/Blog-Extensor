faqQ1: "Can I use double cream instead of single cream in air fryer recipes?"
faqA1: "Yes, but double cream has a higher fat content, so adjust quantities slightly. Since 1 cup of double cream equals about 9.6 ounces, you may need to reduce the amount to avoid overly rich dishes. For best results, refer to a conversion chart or recipe guidelines."
faqQ2: "How do I measure 1 cup of single cream without a measuring cup?"
faqA2: "Use a standard mug or glass, but note that sizes vary. A UK metric cup is 240 ml, roughly 8.45 ounces. For accuracy, fill the container to just below the rim and level it off. Alternatively, weigh 240 grams on a kitchen scale for a close approximation."
faqQ3: "Does single cream thicken in the air fryer?"
faqA3: "Single cream can reduce slightly due to the air fryer’s heat, but it won’t thicken significantly like double cream. For thicker sauces, mix in a small amount of cornflour or flour before cooking. This helps achieve the desired consistency without curdling."
faqQ4: "How long does single cream last in the fridge after opening?"
faqA4: "Opened single cream stays fresh for about 3–5 days if stored properly. Keep it sealed and refrigerated at all times. For air fryer recipes, always check for spoilage (sour smell or separation) before use to ensure food safety."

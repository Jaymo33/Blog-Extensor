faqQ1: "Can I use volume measurements instead of weighing sesame seeds for air frying?"
faqA1: "While volume measurements (like cups) work, weighing sesame seeds gives more accurate results in air frying. Since air fryers cook quickly and evenly, precise amounts ensure proper toasting and flavour distribution. For best results, use our 0.5 cup to 2.5 ounce conversion or a kitchen scale."
faqQ2: "Do toasted sesame seeds weigh the same as raw ones?"
faqA2: "Toasted sesame seeds are slightly lighter due to moisture loss during toasting, but the difference is minimal for home cooking. Our 0.5 cup (2.5 oz) measurement works for both raw and toasted seeds in air fryer recipes. For professional precision, reduce the weight by about 5% when using pre-toasted seeds."
faqQ3: "How many calories are in 0.5 cup (2.5 oz) of sesame seeds?"
faqA3: "Approximately 400 calories, as sesame seeds are nutrient-dense. This amount provides healthy fats, protein, and minerals. When air frying, remember that a little goes a long way for both flavour and nutrition. Check our recipe section for balanced ways to incorporate sesame seeds."
faqQ4: "Can I substitute black sesame seeds for white in the same measurement?"
faqA4: "Yes, black and white sesame seeds have nearly identical weights and can be swapped 1:1 in recipes. The main difference is visual appeal and a slightly stronger flavour in black seeds. For air frying, follow the same 0.5 cup to 2.5 ounce conversion regardless of seed colour."

<p>0.5 cup of sesame seeds equals approximately 2.5 ounces (70 grams) in UK measurements. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precision matters. Whether you’re making sesame-crusted chicken or sprinkling seeds over roasted vegetables, knowing the exact weight ensures consistency. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we focus on accurate measurements to help you achieve perfect results every time.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate sesame seed measurements matter</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of sesame seeds can make or break a dish. Too few, and you’ll miss out on that nutty crunch; too many, and the flavour can overpower other ingredients. In air fryer cooking, even distribution is key for even toasting. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> simplifies these calculations, so you never have to guess. Whether you’re following a recipe from our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipes</a> section or experimenting, precision ensures success.</p>  

<h3>How to measure sesame seeds correctly</h3>  
<p>For the most accurate results, use a digital kitchen scale to weigh sesame seeds. If you don’t have one, lightly spoon the seeds into a measuring cup without packing them down. Avoid tapping the cup, as this compacts the seeds and skews the measurement. This method ensures your 0.5 cup of sesame seeds truly equals 2.5 ounces, whether you’re air frying or baking.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for sesame seeds in air fryer recipes</h2>  
<p>Sesame seeds add texture and flavour to countless air fryer dishes. Try them in crispy tofu, sprinkled over salmon, or mixed into homemade granola. For inspiration, browse our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipes</a> featuring sesame crusts. They also work beautifully in Asian-inspired dishes, like air-fried dumplings or stir-fry toppings. Remember, 0.5 cup of sesame seeds (2.5 oz) is often enough for 4–6 servings.</p>  

<h3>Storing sesame seeds for freshness</h3>  
<p>To keep sesame seeds fresh, store them in an airtight container in a cool, dark place. They can last up to six months this way, or up to a year in the fridge. Proper storage ensures your 0.5 cup measurements remain consistent in flavour and quality. For more storage tips, check our guide on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>keeping your air fryer ingredients fresh</a>.</p>  

<h2>Converting other sesame seed measurements</h2>  
<p>If your recipe calls for tablespoons or grams instead of cups, here’s a quick reference: 1 tablespoon of sesame seeds weighs about 0.3 ounces (9 grams). For larger batches, 1 cup equals roughly 5 ounces (140 grams). These conversions are especially handy when scaling air fryer recipes up or down.

<h3>Troubleshooting sesame seed measurements</h3>  
<p>If your sesame seeds seem heavier or lighter than expected, check for moisture or staleness. Old seeds may have lost oil content, affecting weight. For consistent results in air frying, always use fresh ingredients and measure carefully. When in doubt, our 0.5 cup to 2.5 ounce conversion is a reliable starting point for most recipes.</p>

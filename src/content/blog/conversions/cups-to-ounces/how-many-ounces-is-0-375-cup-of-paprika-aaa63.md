faqQ1: "Can I use grams instead of ounces for 0.375 cup of paprika?"
faqA1: "Yes, 0.375 cup of paprika is about 42.5 grams. If your kitchen scale uses grams, this conversion ensures accuracy. Many UK recipes prefer grams, so this option is handy for precise air fryer cooking."
faqQ2: "Does the type of paprika affect the weight per cup?"
faqA2: "Slightly. Smoked paprika is denser than sweet paprika, but the difference is minimal. For most recipes, 0.375 cup will still weigh close to 1.5 ounces. When in doubt, use a scale for the best results."
faqQ3: "How long does 0.375 cup of paprika last in recipes?"
faqA3: "It depends on the dish. For a single batch of air-fried chicken, 0.375 cup is ample. For smaller servings, you might halve it. Store leftover paprika in an airtight container to maintain freshness."
faqQ4: "Can I substitute paprika powder for flakes in this measurement?"
faqA4: "Yes, but flakes take up more space, so 0.375 cup will weigh slightly less. For consistent results, stick to powder unless the recipe specifies otherwise. Adjust to taste if needed."

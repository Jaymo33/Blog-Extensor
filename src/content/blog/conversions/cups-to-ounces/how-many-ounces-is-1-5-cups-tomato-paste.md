faqQ1: "Can I use tomato sauce instead of tomato paste in air fryer recipes?"
faqA1: "Tomato sauce is thinner and less concentrated than tomato paste, so substitutions require adjustments. Use 3 parts tomato sauce to replace 1 part tomato paste, and reduce other liquids in the recipe to compensate for the added moisture."
faqQ2: "How long does tomato paste last once opened?"
faqA2: "Opened tomato paste lasts up to 5–7 days in the fridge if stored in an airtight container. For longer storage, freeze it in ice cube trays—each cube holds about 1 ounce, making it easy to portion for future air fryer recipes."
faqQ3: "Why does my air fryer recipe call for tomato paste in ounces instead of cups?"
faqA3: "Ounces provide a more accurate measurement, especially for dense ingredients like tomato paste. Cups can vary based on how tightly the paste is packed, while weight (ounces) ensures consistency across all your air fryer dishes."
faqQ4: "Can I make my own tomato paste for air fryer recipes?"
faqA4: "Yes! Simmer puréed tomatoes for 2–3 hours until thickened, stirring occasionally. Homemade tomato paste lacks preservatives, so store it in the fridge for up to a week or freeze it for longer use in your air fryer creations."

faqQ1: "Can I use whole milk instead of semi skimmed milk in air fryer recipes?"
faqA1: "Yes, you can substitute whole milk for semi skimmed milk, but keep in mind it has a higher fat content. This may slightly alter the texture of your dish. If converting 2.5 cups, the weight will still be close to 20.29 oz, but the richness will differ."
faqQ2: "How do I measure 2.5 cups of semi skimmed milk without a measuring cup?"
faqA2: "If you don’t have a measuring cup, a standard UK mug holds about 10 oz, so 2 mugs will give you approximately 20 oz (close to 2.5 cups). For precise measurements, a kitchen scale is best to confirm the 20.29 oz equivalent."
faqQ3: "Does the temperature of semi skimmed milk affect the measurement?"
faqA3: "The temperature doesn’t change the weight (20.29 oz for 2.5 cups), but cold milk may measure slightly differently in volume due to density. For accuracy, measure milk at room temperature if possible."
faqQ4: "Why is my air fryer recipe not turning out with semi skimmed milk?"
faqA4: "If your dish isn’t turning out, double-check your measurements. Too much or too little milk (deviating from 20.29 oz for 2.5 cups) can affect texture. Also, ensure your air fryer is clean and preheated for even cooking."

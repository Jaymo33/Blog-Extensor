faqQ1: "Does the type of peanut butter affect the 0.33 cup to ounce conversion?"
faqA1: "The conversion from 0.33 cup to ounces (2.93 oz) works for all peanut butter types, but preparation matters. For natural peanut butter that separates, stir thoroughly before measuring to ensure accuracy. Powdered peanut butter should be reconstituted first."
faqQ2: "Can I use this conversion for other nut butters in my air fryer?"
faqA2: "Yes, the 0.33 cup to 2.93 ounce conversion works similarly for almond, cashew, and other nut butters. However, some varieties may be slightly more or less dense, so for critical recipes, weighing gives the most precise results in your air fryer."
faqQ3: "How do I measure 0.33 cup of peanut butter without measuring cups?"
faqA3: "Without measuring cups, you can weigh out 2.93 ounces on kitchen scales. Alternatively, 0.33 cup is about 5 tablespoons plus 1 teaspoon. For sticky ingredients like peanut butter, lightly oil your measuring spoon first for easier release and cleaner measurement."
faqQ4: "Why do some air fryer recipes use ounces instead of cups for peanut butter?"
faqA4: "Air fryer recipes often use weight measurements (ounces) because they're more precise. Volume measurements (cups) can vary based on how you pack the peanut butter. For consistent results in your air fryer, weighing 2.93 ounces for 0.33 cup is recommended."

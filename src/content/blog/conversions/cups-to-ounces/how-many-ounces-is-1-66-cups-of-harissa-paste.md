faqQ1: "Can I use harissa powder instead of paste, and how does the conversion work?"
faqA1: "Yes, you can substitute harissa powder for paste. Use 1 tablespoon of harissa powder mixed with 2 tablespoons of water or oil to replace 1 tablespoon of harissa paste. For 1.66 cups (13.28 oz) of paste, you’d need about 13 tablespoons of powder plus 26 tablespoons of liquid. Adjust to taste, as powder can be more concentrated."
faqQ2: "Does the type of harissa paste affect the weight per cup?"
faqA2: "Slightly. Oil-based harissa pastes may weigh less per cup (around 7.5 oz) due to lower density, while thicker, tomato-based versions can reach 8.5 oz per cup. Always check the brand’s consistency and adjust measurements if precision is crucial, like in baking or marinades."
faqQ3: "How long does harissa paste last in the fridge after opening?"
faqA3: "Harissa paste typically lasts 4–6 months refrigerated if stored in an airtight container. Oil separation is normal—just stir before use. For longer storage, freeze it in ice cube trays; each cube holds about 1 ounce, making it easy to portion for recipes calling for 1.66 cups (13.28 oz)."
faqQ4: "Can I make harissa paste at home, and how does it compare to store-bought in weight?"
faqA4: "Homemade harissa paste is easy to prepare using dried chilies, spices, garlic, and oil. It usually weighs slightly less per cup (7–7.5 oz) due to less compaction. If a recipe needs 1.66 cups (13.28 oz) of store-bought paste, use about 1.75 cups of homemade for similar flavour intensity."

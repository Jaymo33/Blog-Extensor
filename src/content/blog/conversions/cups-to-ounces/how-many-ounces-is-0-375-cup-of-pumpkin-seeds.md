<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air frying</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on precise ingredient quantities to ensure even heat distribution and consistent results. Using 0.375 cup of pumpkin seeds (1.5 ounces) guarantees the right balance for roasting or baking. Too many seeds can overcrowd the basket, leading to uneven cooking, while too few may burn quickly.

<p>Many air fryer recipes, like those in our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipes section</a>, specify weights rather than volumes for accuracy. Pumpkin seeds, for example, can vary in density, so weighing them removes guesswork. If you’re preparing a batch of spiced seeds or adding them to granola, 0.375 cup (1.5 ounces) ensures consistency. Always measure ingredients like pumpkin seeds by weight when possible for the best air fryer results.</p>

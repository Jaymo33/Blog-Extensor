faqQ1: "Can I use plain flour instead of cornflour in air fryer recipes?"
faqA1: "Yes, but the results will differ. Cornflour creates a lighter, crispier texture, while plain flour may yield a denser coating. For 1.75 cups of cornflour (7.4 oz), substitute with the same weight of plain flour, but expect slight variations in crispiness."
faqQ2: "How do I store cornflour to keep it fresh for air frying?"
faqA2: "Store cornflour in an airtight container in a cool, dry place. Moisture can cause clumping, which affects measurements like 1.75 cups to ounces. For long-term freshness, consider refrigerating it, especially in humid climates."
faqQ3: "Why does my air fryer coating turn out soggy?"
faqA3: "Sogginess often stems from overcrowding or insufficient cornflour. Ensure you’re using the correct amount (e.g., 1.75 cups or 7.4 oz) and space food evenly in the basket. Preheating the air fryer also helps achieve crispiness."
faqQ4: "Is cornflour gluten-free, and can I use it for gluten-free air fryer recipes?"
faqA4: "Yes, cornflour is naturally gluten-free, making it perfect for gluten-free cooking. When converting 1.75 cups to ounces (7.4 oz), it works well in batters and coatings for dietary-friendly dishes. Always check labels for cross-contamination warnings if you’re highly sensitive."

faqQ1: "Can I use whole coriander seeds instead of ground coriander in my air fryer?"
faqA1: "Yes, but you’ll need to adjust the quantity. Whole coriander seeds are less concentrated, so use about 1.5 times the amount of ground coriander (e.g., 2.5 cups whole seeds for 1.66 cups ground). Crush them lightly for better flavour release in air fryer dishes."
faqQ2: "How does ground coriander affect cooking times in an air fryer?"
faqA2: "Ground coriander doesn’t significantly alter cooking times, but it can enhance browning due to its natural sugars. For recipes like roasted veggies or meats, stick to standard air fryer timings. Always check for doneness with a thermometer or visual cues."
faqQ3: "Is 1.66 cups of ground coriander too much for a single air fryer meal?"
faqA3: "It depends on the recipe. For large batches (e.g., meal prep or family servings), 1.66 cups (5.3 oz) works well. For smaller portions, scale down proportionally. Over-seasoning can overpower other flavours, so start with less and adjust to taste."
faqQ4: "Why does my ground coriander clump in the air fryer?"
faqA4: "Clumping happens when moisture interacts with the spice. To prevent it, mix ground coriander with oil or other dry spices before adding to ingredients. For sticky marinades, toss food halfway through cooking to redistribute the seasoning evenly."

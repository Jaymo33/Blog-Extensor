faqQ1: "Can I use frozen cranberries instead of fresh for 0.25 cup measurements?"
faqA1: "Yes, frozen cranberries can be used, but they may weigh slightly more due to ice crystals. Thaw and drain them first, then measure 0.25 cup (about 1 oz) for accuracy. Adjust cooking time in the air fryer as frozen berries release more moisture."
faqQ2: "How many cranberries are in 0.25 cup?"
faqA2: "Approximately 12-15 whole cranberries make up 0.25 cup (1 oz), depending on size. For precise recipes, weighing is best, but counting works for less exact needs."
faqQ3: "Do dried cranberries weigh the same as fresh for 0.25 cup?"
faqA3: "No, dried cranberries are denser. 0.25 cup of dried cranberries weighs about 1.5 ounces (42 grams). Adjust recipes accordingly to avoid overly sweet or dry results."
faqQ4: "Why does my air fryer cranberry recipe turn out soggy?"
faqA4: "Sogginess usually stems from overcrowding or excess moisture. Use no more than 1 oz (0.25 cup) of cranberries per batch, and toss them with a bit of oil for crispiness. Preheat the air fryer for best results."

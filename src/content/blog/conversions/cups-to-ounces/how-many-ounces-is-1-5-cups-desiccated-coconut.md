faqQ1: "Can I use shredded coconut instead of desiccated in air fryer recipes?"
faqA1: "Yes, but shredded coconut is denser and moister, so you may need to adjust the quantity. For 1.5 cups of desiccated coconut (4.5 oz), use about 1.25 cups of shredded coconut to match the weight. Keep an eye on cooking times, as shredded coconut browns faster in the air fryer."
faqQ2: "How do I store desiccated coconut for air fryer recipes?"
faqA2: "Store desiccated coconut in an airtight container in a cool, dry place. It can last up to six months this way. For longer storage, keep it in the fridge or freezer, where it’ll stay fresh for up to a year. Always let it come to room temperature before using it in air fryer recipes."
faqQ3: "Why does my desiccated coconut burn in the air fryer?"
faqA3: "Desiccated coconut can burn quickly due to its low moisture content and the air fryer’s intense heat. To prevent this, reduce the cooking temperature by 10-20°C and check frequently. Mixing it with other ingredients, like breadcrumbs or sugar, can also help distribute the heat more evenly."
faqQ4: "Can I toast desiccated coconut in the air fryer?"
faqA4: "Absolutely! Spread 1.5 cups (4.5 oz) of desiccated coconut in a single layer in the air fryer basket. Cook at 160°C for 2-3 minutes, shaking halfway, until golden. Toasted coconut adds fantastic flavour to desserts, curries, and granola—just keep a close eye on it to avoid burning."

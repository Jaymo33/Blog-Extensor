faqQ1: "Can I use a kitchen scale to measure 0.66 cup of fish sauce in ounces?"

faqQ2: "How does 0.66 cup of fish sauce compare to other liquid measurements?"
faqA2: "0.66 cup of fish sauce is roughly 5.28 ounces or 156 millilitres. It’s slightly more than half a standard US cup (which is 8 ounces). This measurement is handy for recipes that require precision, especially in air fryer cooking."
faqQ3: "What if I don’t have fish sauce? Can I substitute it in air fryer recipes?"
faqA3: "While fish sauce has a unique flavour, you can use soy sauce or Worcestershire sauce as substitutes. Keep in mind the taste will differ, so adjust other seasonings accordingly. For authentic results, stick to fish sauce where possible."
faqQ4: "How long does fish sauce last after opening?"
faqA4: "Fish sauce can last up to 2–3 years if stored properly. Keep the bottle tightly sealed and away from heat or sunlight. Over time, the flavour may intensify, but it remains safe to use. Always check for off smells before using."

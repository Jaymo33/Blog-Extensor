faqQ1: "Can I use 0.5 cup of rice flour instead of wheat flour in air fryer recipes?"
faqA1: "Yes, but remember that 0.5 cup of rice flour (2.5 oz) behaves differently than wheat flour. Rice flour absorbs less liquid and creates a crispier texture, ideal for coatings. For baking, you may need to add binders like xanthan gum."
faqQ2: "Why does my air fryer recipe with 0.5 cup rice flour turn out dry?"
faqA2: "If your recipe with 0.5 cup (2.5 oz) rice flour seems dry, you may need slightly more liquid. Rice flour absorbs moisture differently than wheat flour. Try adding an extra tablespoon of liquid per 0.5 cup for better results."
faqQ3: "How do I convert 0.5 cup rice flour to grams for UK recipes?"
faqA3: "0.5 cup of rice flour equals approximately 70 grams. For precise air fryer baking, we recommend using digital scales. This ensures consistency, especially for gluten-free recipes where exact measurements matter."
faqQ4: "Can I substitute almond flour for 0.5 cup rice flour in air fryer recipes?"
faqA4: "You can substitute almond flour, but note that 0.5 cup almond flour weighs about 1.8 oz (50g) – less than rice flour’s 2.5 oz. Adjust quantities and expect a different texture, as almond flour browns faster in air fryers."

<p>0.5 cup of rice flour equals approximately 2.5 ounces (70 grams) in UK measurements. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes, where precision ensures the best texture and consistency. Whether you're baking gluten-free treats or coating ingredients for crispy results, knowing the exact weight of 0.5 cup of rice flour makes all the difference.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on even heat distribution, and incorrect flour quantities can lead to uneven cooking or overly dense results. Rice flour, in particular, behaves differently than wheat flour, so measuring 0.5 cup correctly ensures your recipes turn out light and crispy.

<p>Many UK cooks prefer weighing ingredients like rice flour for consistency. While 0.5 cup is a common measurement in American recipes, converting it to ounces (2.5 oz) aligns with British kitchen scales. This small adjustment can elevate your air fryer dishes from good to great.</p>  

<h3>How to measure 0.5 cup of rice flour accurately</h3>  
<p>For the most precise 0.5 cup rice flour to ounces conversion, use the spoon-and-level method. Gently spoon flour into a measuring cup without packing it down, then level off the excess with a straight edge. This prevents compacting, which could add up to 20% more flour by weight.</p>  

<h2>Rice flour in air fryer recipes: Pro tips</h2>  
<p>Rice flour’s fine texture makes it ideal for air fryer coatings and batters. When converting 0.5 cup to ounces (2.5 oz), consider that rice flour absorbs less liquid than wheat flour. Adjust liquids slightly in recipes like tempura or onion bhajis for the perfect crispiness.</p>

faqQ1: "Does the type of lentil affect the weight measurement?"
faqA1: "Yes, different lentil varieties have slightly different weights. While 3 cups of most lentils weigh about 21 ounces, red lentils might be slightly lighter due to their smaller size. For absolute precision in air fryer recipes, it's best to weigh your specific type of lentils."
faqQ2: "Can I use this conversion for cooked lentils?"
faqA2: "No, this conversion applies only to dry lentils. Cooked lentils absorb water and expand significantly. Three cups of cooked lentils would weigh much more than 21 ounces. Always check whether your recipe specifies dry or cooked measurements."
faqQ3: "How should I measure lentils for the most accurate results?"
faqA3: "For the most precise measurement, use a kitchen scale to weigh your lentils in ounces. If using cups, spoon the lentils gently into the measuring cup without packing them down, then level off the top with a straight edge."
faqQ4: "Are these measurements different in the UK versus other countries?"
faqA4: "The conversion of 3 cups to 21 ounces is standard internationally, as both cups and ounces are imperial measurements. However, if you're using metric measurements, 3 cups equal approximately 600 grams. Always check which measurement system your recipe uses."

<h2>How to Measure Lentils Correctly</h2>
<p>When converting 3 cups of lentils to ounces, it's important to use the right measuring technique.

<h3>Dry vs Cooked Lentils</h3>
<p>Keep in mind that 3 cups of dry lentils will yield much more when cooked. If your recipe calls for cooked lentils, you'll need to adjust your measurements accordingly. Typically, 1 cup of dry lentils expands to about 2-2.5 cups when cooked, so plan your portions carefully.</p>

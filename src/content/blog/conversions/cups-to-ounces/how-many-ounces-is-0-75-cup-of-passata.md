faqQ1: "Can I use tomato puree instead of passata for 0.75 cup in air fryer recipes?"
faqA1: "Yes, but you'll need to dilute tomato puree with water, as it's much thicker. For 0.75 cup (6 ounces) of passata, mix 3 tablespoons of tomato puree with 5 tablespoons of water. Adjust to taste, as puree has a stronger flavour."
faqQ2: "How does passata weight compare to chopped tomatoes in ounces?"
faqA2: "Chopped tomatoes are slightly heavier due to their chunkier texture. While 0.75 cup of passata is 6 ounces, the same volume of chopped tomatoes weighs around 7 ounces. Drain excess liquid if substituting in air fryer recipes."
faqQ3: "Is 0.75 cup of passata the same in UK and US measurements?"
faqA3: "Yes, 0.75 cup is a universal measurement, equalling 6 ounces in both UK and US standards. However, always check your measuring tools, as some cups may vary slightly in size."
faqQ4: "Can I freeze 0.75 cup portions of passata for later use?"
faqA4: "Absolutely! Freezing 0.75 cup (6-ounce) portions in small containers or bags works well. Thaw in the fridge before using in air fryer recipes, and give it a stir to restore consistency."

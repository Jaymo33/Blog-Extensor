faqQ1: "Can I use milk instead of cream for 0.125 cup measurements?"
faqA1: "Yes, you can substitute milk for cream, but keep in mind the texture and fat content will differ. For 0.125 cup (1 oz) of cream, use the same volume of milk, but expect a lighter result. This works well in sauces or soups but may not be ideal for desserts."
faqQ2: "How do I measure 0.125 cup of cream without a measuring cup?"
faqA2: "If you don't have a measuring cup, use a kitchen scale to weigh out 1 oz of cream. Alternatively, two tablespoons equal roughly 0.125 cup. For accuracy, a scale is best, especially for air fryer recipes where precision matters."
faqQ3: "Is 0.125 cup of cream the same as 0.125 cup of whipped cream?"
faqA3: "No, whipped cream has air incorporated, so 0.125 cup of whipped cream will weigh less than 1 oz. For accurate measurements, always use liquid cream unless the recipe specifies otherwise."
faqQ4: "Can I freeze 0.125 cup portions of cream for later use?"
faqA4: "Yes, you can freeze cream in 1 oz (0.125 cup) portions. Thaw it in the fridge before using, and give it a good stir. Note that frozen cream may separate slightly, so it's best for cooking rather than whipping."

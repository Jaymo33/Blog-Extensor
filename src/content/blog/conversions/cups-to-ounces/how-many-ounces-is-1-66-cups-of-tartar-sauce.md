faqQ1: "Can I use a liquid measuring cup for tartar sauce?"
faqA1: "Yes, but a dry measuring cup or kitchen scale is better for thicker sauces like tartar sauce. Liquid cups are designed for fluids, so sticky condiments may not level accurately. For 1.66 cups (13.28 oz), a scale ensures precision."
faqQ2: "Does the brand of tartar sauce affect the weight?"
faqA2: "Slightly. Thicker brands may weigh more per cup, but the difference is minimal. Always check the label for density notes. For most recipes, 1.66 cups will still be roughly 13.28 oz."
faqQ3: "How do I adjust air fryer time for saucy coatings?"
faqA3: "If using tartar sauce as a binder, add 1-2 minutes to cooking time. The extra moisture takes longer to crisp. Monitor closely to avoid burning."
faqQ4: "Can I freeze leftover tartar sauce?"
faqA4: "Yes, but texture may change slightly. Thaw in the fridge and stir well before using. Measure 1.66 cups (13.28 oz) portions for easy reuse in future air fryer meals."

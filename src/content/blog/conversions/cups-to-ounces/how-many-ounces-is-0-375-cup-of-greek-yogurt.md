faqQ1: "Can I use regular yogurt instead of greek yogurt in this measurement?"
faqA1: "Yes, but regular yogurt is thinner, so you may need to adjust slightly. For 0.375 cup (3 ounces) of greek yogurt, you could use the same volume of regular yogurt, but expect a slightly looser texture in your dish."
faqQ2: "How do I measure 0.375 cup without a measuring cup?"
faqA2: "You can use six level tablespoons to approximate 0.375 cup. Alternatively, a kitchen scale set to 3 ounces will give you the most accurate measurement, especially for air fryer recipes."
faqQ3: "Why does greek yogurt weigh more than regular yogurt per cup?"
faqA3: "Greek yogurt is strained to remove whey, making it denser and thicker. This means it packs more weight into the same volume compared to regular yogurt, which is why conversions differ."
faqQ4: "Can I freeze 0.375 cup portions of greek yogurt for later use?"
faqA4: "Yes, greek yogurt freezes well in small portions. Portion it into 3-ounce servings (0.375 cup) and thaw in the fridge before using. Note that texture may change slightly, so it’s best used in cooked dishes."

faqQ1: "Can I use a kitchen scale to measure 2 cups of fish sauce in ounces?"
faqA1: "Yes, a kitchen scale is ideal for converting 2 cups of fish sauce to ounces. Set it to fluid ounces (fl oz) mode, pour the fish sauce into a measuring cup, and note the weight. This method is more precise than volume measurements for air fryer recipes."
faqQ2: "Does the brand of fish sauce affect the 2 cups to ounces conversion?"
faqA2: "Most fish sauces have a similar density, so 2 cups will generally equal around 16 ounces regardless of brand. However, thicker artisanal varieties might vary slightly. For air fryer cooking, stick to standard conversions unless the recipe specifies otherwise."
faqQ3: "How do I convert 2 cups of fish sauce to grams for UK measurements?"
faqA3: "Since 1 ounce is roughly 28 grams, 16 ounces (2 cups) of fish sauce equals about 448 grams. This conversion is useful for UK air fryer recipes that list weights in grams. Always double-check with a scale if precision is crucial."
faqQ4: "What’s the best way to store leftover fish sauce after measuring 2 cups?"
faqA4: "Keep opened fish sauce in a cool, dark place or the fridge to maintain freshness. Ensure the lid is tightly sealed to prevent odours. For air fryer recipes, always use a clean measuring cup to avoid contaminating the bottle."

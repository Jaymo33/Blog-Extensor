faqQ1: "Can I use ground turmeric instead of fresh in air fryer recipes?"
faqA1: "Yes, ground turmeric works well in air fryer recipes and is easier to measure. Use 1 teaspoon of ground turmeric for every 1-inch piece of fresh turmeric. Just remember to adjust other spices accordingly to balance the flavour."
faqQ2: "Why does my turmeric measurement seem off when using cups?"
faqA2: "Turmeric can settle or clump, leading to inconsistent measurements. For accuracy, fluff the spice with a spoon before measuring or use a kitchen scale. This ensures you get the right amount for your air fryer recipes."
faqQ3: "How do I store turmeric to keep it fresh for air fryer cooking?"
faqA3: "Store turmeric in an airtight container in a cool, dark place. This preserves its flavour and colour, ensuring your air fryer dishes taste their best. Avoid storing it near heat or moisture to prevent clumping."
faqQ4: "Can I substitute turmeric with other spices in air fryer recipes?"
faqA4: "While turmeric has a unique flavour, you can use a mix of cumin and paprika for a similar warmth. Keep in mind the colour won’t be the same, so adjust expectations for dishes like golden air fryer cauliflower."

<p>1.5 cups of turmeric equals approximately 12 ounces. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements can make or break a dish. Turmeric, a vibrant yellow spice, is often used in curries, marinades, and even air fryer snacks. Knowing how to convert cups to ounces ensures your recipes turn out perfectly every time.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on even cooking, and incorrect measurements can lead to uneven results. Too much turmeric might overpower a dish, while too little could leave it bland.

<p>Turmeric is a dense spice, so 1.5 cups will weigh more than lighter ingredients like flour. This makes it crucial to measure by weight (ounces) rather than volume (cups) for accuracy. If you're new to air fryer cooking, <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>our recipe collection</a> offers plenty of inspiration.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure Turmeric Correctly</h3>  
<p>For the most accurate results, use a kitchen scale to weigh your turmeric in ounces. If you don’t have one, lightly spoon the turmeric into a measuring cup without packing it down. Avoid tapping the cup, as this can compress the spice and lead to over-measuring.

faqQ1: "Can I use 2.5 cups of cornflour interchangeably with plain flour in air fryer recipes?"
faqA1: "No, cornflour and plain flour have different weights and properties. Cornflour is lighter (10.6 oz per 2.5 cups) and creates a crisper texture, ideal for coatings. Plain flour is denser and may require adjustments. Always check recipe specifics."
faqQ2: "How do I store leftover cornflour after measuring 2.5 cups?"
faqA2: "Keep cornflour in an airtight container in a cool, dry place. Exposure to humidity can clump it, affecting future measurements. For long-term storage, freeze it—just bring to room temperature before use."
faqQ3: "Why does my air fryer recipe turn out gritty with 2.5 cups of cornflour?"
faqA3: "Grittiness often means the cornflour wasn’t sifted. Always sift before measuring 2.5 cups (10.6 oz) to remove lumps. Overcrowding the air fryer basket can also cause uneven cooking and texture issues."
faqQ4: "Is 2.5 cups of cornflour the same in US and UK measurements?"
faqA4: "Yes, 2.5 cups of cornflour equal 10.6 oz in both systems. However, US cups are slightly larger (240ml vs. UK’s 250ml), but the weight difference is negligible for this conversion. Always use a scale for precision."

<p>2.5 cups of cornflour equals approximately 10.6 ounces (or 300 grams). Getting this conversion right is essential for air fryer recipes, where precision ensures perfect texture and consistency. Whether you're coating chicken or thickening a sauce, knowing the exact weight saves time and avoids kitchen mishaps.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on even heat distribution, so ingredient ratios must be spot-on. Too much cornflour can make coatings clumpy, while too little might leave food soggy. For recipes like crispy <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>air fryer chicken</a>, 2.5 cups of cornflour (10.6 oz) is often ideal for a light, golden crust. Check our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a> for other common measurements.</p>  

<p>Cornflour is lighter than wheat flour, so volume-to-weight conversions differ. A UK cup holds 120 grams of cornflour, meaning 2.5 cups weigh 300 grams (10.6 oz). This precision helps when adapting recipes from cups to ounces, especially for air fryer batters or dustings.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure Cornflour Correctly</h3>  
<p>For accuracy, spoon cornflour into a measuring cup and level it off—don’t scoop directly from the bag. Compacted flour can add extra ounces, throwing off your recipe. If you’re scaling up, use a kitchen scale for 2.5 cups of cornflour (10.6 oz) to avoid guesswork.</p>  

<h2>Common Recipes Using 2.5 Cups of Cornflour</h2>  
<p>This quantity works well for batch cooking. Try it in <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer onion rings</a> or tempura vegetables. The 10.6-ounce measurement ensures a crisp finish without excess residue. For gluten-free options, cornflour is a staple—just ensure your conversions are precise.</p>  

<p>Some bakers use 2.5 cups of cornflour (300g) in cakes for a tender crumb. In savoury dishes, it thickens sauces evenly. Always sift cornflour first to prevent lumps, especially in air fryer batters where smoothness matters.</p>  

<h3>Converting Other Cornflour Amounts</h3>

faqQ1: "Does the type of miso affect the 1.5 cups to ounces conversion?"
faqA1: "The type of miso slightly affects weight but not fluid ounces. While 1.5 cups of any miso soup equals 12 fluid ounces, white miso (lighter) may weigh slightly less than red miso (denser) per cup. For most air fryer recipes, the 12 oz volume measurement works regardless of miso variety."
faqQ2: "Can I use this conversion for other liquids in air fryer recipes?"
faqA2: "Absolutely! The 1.5 cups to 12 ounces conversion works for most thin liquids like broths, stocks, or light sauces in air fryer cooking. However, thicker substances like honey or condensed milk have different weight-to-volume ratios. Always check our conversion chart for precise measurements."
faqQ3: "How should I adjust cooking times when using 1.5 cups of miso soup in air fryer recipes?"
faqA3: "When using 12 ounces (1.5 cups) of miso soup as a marinade or cooking liquid, reduce standard cooking times by 10-15%. Air fryers evaporate moisture quickly, and miso's sugars can caramelise faster. Start checking doneness early, especially with delicate proteins like fish or tofu."
faqQ4: "Is there a difference between US and UK ounces for this conversion?"
faqA4: "For practical cooking purposes, no. While UK fluid ounces are about 4% larger than US ounces, most modern recipes (including those on airfryerrecipe.co.uk) use the US standard. Your 1.5 cups of miso soup equals 12 US fluid ounces (340ml) whether you're in London or Los Angeles."

faqQ1: "How do I measure 0.25 cup of lime juice without a measuring cup?"
faqA1: "You can use tablespoons to measure 0.25 cup of lime juice. Since 1 tablespoon equals 0.5 oz, four tablespoons will give you 2 oz (0.25 cup). Alternatively, a standard shot glass holds about 1.5 oz, so filling it slightly more than halfway will approximate 0.25 cup."
faqQ2: "Does bottled lime juice measure the same as fresh lime juice?"
faqA2: "Yes, bottled and fresh lime juice measure the same in volume. 0.25 cup of either equals 2 oz. However, fresh lime juice often has a brighter flavour, which can enhance your air fryer dishes. Bottled juice is convenient but may contain preservatives."
faqQ3: "Can I substitute lemon juice for lime juice in the same amount?"
faqA3: "Yes, you can substitute lemon juice for lime juice in a 1:1 ratio. Both are acidic and work similarly in recipes. However, lemon juice has a slightly different flavour profile, so adjust seasonings accordingly if swapping."
faqQ4: "How many limes do I need for 0.25 cup of juice?"
faqA4: "On average, one medium lime yields about 1 oz of juice. For 0.25 cup (2 oz), you’ll need approximately two limes. Roll them on a counter before juicing to maximise yield. Fresh juice is ideal for marinades and dressings."

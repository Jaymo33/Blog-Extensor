faqQ1: "How do I set my fan oven to 252 F equivalent?"
faqA1: "Set your fan oven to 120 C for the equivalent of 252 F. This conversion works for most standard fan ovens in the UK. Remember to adjust cooking times slightly as fan ovens cook faster than conventional ones."
faqQ2: "Can I use 252 F in my air fryer if it doesn't go that low?"
faqA2: "Most air fryers start at 150 C, higher than 252 F (120 C). Use the lowest setting and reduce cooking time by 10-15%, checking food frequently. The rapid air circulation will compensate somewhat for the slightly higher temperature."
faqQ3: "What's the difference between 252 F in a fan oven vs conventional oven?"
faqA3: "252 F equals 120 C in a fan oven but 130 C in a conventional oven. The fan's circulation means you can use a lower temperature setting while achieving similar cooking results. This principle applies to air fryers as well."
faqQ4: "Is 252 F suitable for baking cakes in a fan oven?"
faqA4: "252 F (120 C fan) is generally too low for most cakes, which typically bake at 160-180 C. However, it can work for very delicate items or keeping baked goods warm.

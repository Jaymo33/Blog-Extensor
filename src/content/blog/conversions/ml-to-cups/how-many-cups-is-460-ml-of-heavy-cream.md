faqQ1: "Can I use half-and-half instead of heavy cream for 460 ml in recipes?"
faqA1: "Half-and-half can be used as a substitute for heavy cream, but it has a lower fat content, which may affect the texture of your dish. For 460 ml of heavy cream, you can use half-and-half, but expect a lighter consistency in sauces or desserts. If you're baking, consider adding a tablespoon of butter per cup to mimic the richness of heavy cream."
faqQ2: "How do I measure 460 ml of heavy cream without a measuring cup?"
faqA2: "If you don't have a measuring cup, you can use a kitchen scale to measure 460 ml of heavy cream. Heavy cream weighs roughly 1 gram per ml, so 460 ml equals about 468 grams. Alternatively, use a standard drinking glass, but note that this method is less accurate and may not give you the exact 1.94 cups needed."
faqQ3: "Does 460 ml of heavy cream whip to the same volume as 1.94 cups?"
faqA3: "Yes, 460 ml of heavy cream (1.94 cups) will whip to roughly the same volume, assuming you're using the same whipping method and conditions. Heavy cream typically doubles in volume when whipped, so you'll end up with about 3.88 cups of whipped cream. Chill the cream and whisk for best results."
faqQ4: "Is 460 ml of heavy cream the same in the UK and US?"
faqA4: "While 460 ml is the same volume globally, cup measurements differ between the UK and US. In the UK, 460 ml is about 1.84 cups (using 250 ml per cup), while in the US, it's approximately 1.92 cups (using 240 ml per cup). For precise recipes, stick to the 1.94 cup measurement to avoid inconsistencies."

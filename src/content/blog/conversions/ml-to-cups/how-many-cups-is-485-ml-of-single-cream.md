faqQ1: "Can I use double cream instead of single cream in a recipe calling for 485 ml?"
faqA1: "Yes, you can substitute double cream, but it’s richer and thicker. You may need to thin it slightly with milk to match the consistency of single cream. Adjust the quantity if necessary to avoid an overly heavy dish."
faqQ2: "How do I measure 485 ml of single cream without a measuring cup?"
faqA2: "If you don’t have a measuring cup, use a kitchen scale—485 ml of single cream weighs about 485 grams. Alternatively, a standard UK teacup holds roughly 150 ml, so just over 3 teacups would give you close to 485 ml."
faqQ3: "Does 485 ml of single cream equal 2 cups in both US and UK measurements?"
faqA3: "Almost, but not exactly. In the US, 2 cups equal 480 ml, slightly less than 485 ml. In the UK, 2 cups equal 500 ml, slightly more. For precision, measure by ml or use a scale."
faqQ4: "What air fryer recipes work best with 485 ml of single cream?"
faqA4: "Creamy pasta bakes, custards, and rich sauces work wonderfully with this amount. For inspiration, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert recipes</a> or creamy main dishes on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>."

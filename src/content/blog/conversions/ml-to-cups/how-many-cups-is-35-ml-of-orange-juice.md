faqQ1: "Can I use freshly squeezed orange juice instead of store-bought for 35 ml measurements?"
faqA1: "Yes, freshly squeezed orange juice works perfectly for 35 ml measurements. Just strain it to remove pulp if your recipe requires a smooth consistency. Fresh juice may have a stronger flavour, so adjust other ingredients if needed."
faqQ2: "How does 35 ml of orange juice affect cooking times in an air fryer?"
faqA2: "35 ml of orange juice won’t significantly alter cooking times, but it can add moisture. If using it in marinades or glazes, ensure excess liquid is patted off to avoid steaming instead of crisping. Always follow recipe guidelines for best results."
faqQ3: "Is 35 ml of orange juice the same as 35 grams?"
faqA3: "No, 35 ml measures volume, while 35 grams measures weight. For orange juice, the difference is minimal, but for thicker liquids or solids, conversions vary. Always use a measuring jug for liquids and scales for solids."
faqQ4: "Can I substitute lemon juice for orange juice in a 35 ml measurement?"
faqA4: "Yes, but lemon juice is more acidic, so adjust sweetness in your recipe. Use the same 35 ml amount, but taste as you go. Lemon works well in savoury dishes, while orange adds sweetness to desserts."

<p>35 ml of orange juice equals approximately 0.15 cups (or roughly 1/6 of a cup). This conversion is handy for air fryer recipes where precise measurements matter, whether you're baking, marinating, or making sauces. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we know how crucial accurate measurements are for perfect results every time.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of ingredients ensures your air fryer dishes turn out just right. Too much or too little liquid, like orange juice, can affect texture and flavour. For example, a marinade with 35 ml of orange juice needs the correct balance to tenderise meat without overpowering it. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipes section</a> for dishes where precise measurements make all the difference.</p>  

<p>Air fryers cook food faster than conventional ovens, so even small measurement errors can lead to dry or undercooked meals. Whether you're making glazes, dressings, or baking, knowing that 35 ml of orange juice is about 0.15 cups helps maintain consistency. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a> simplifies these calculations for all your cooking needs.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure 35 ml of Orange Juice Without a Scale</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a measuring jug, use a tablespoon—one tablespoon holds about 15 ml, so 35 ml is just over two tablespoons. For recipes requiring exact amounts, like our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert category</a>, measuring tools are essential. A standard UK cup is 250 ml, making 35 ml roughly 1/6 of a cup.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for 35 ml of Orange Juice in Air Fryer Recipes</h2>  
<p>Orange juice adds brightness to marinades, glazes, and even baked goods. A 35 ml portion is perfect for small batches, like glazing chicken wings or adding zest to cakes. Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipes</a> for ideas on incorporating citrus flavours. The acidity in orange juice also helps tenderise meats, making it a versatile ingredient.</p>  

<p>In baking, 35 ml of orange juice can replace some of the liquid in muffin or cake batters for a subtle citrus twist. Since air fryers circulate hot air, recipes with precise moisture levels, like those in our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>cakes section</a>, benefit from accurate measurements. Too much juice can make batters runny, while too little may leave them dry.</p>

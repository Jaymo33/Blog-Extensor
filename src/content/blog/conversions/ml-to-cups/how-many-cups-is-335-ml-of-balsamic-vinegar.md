faqQ1: "Can I use a regular cup to measure 335 ml of balsamic vinegar?"
faqA1: "While you can use a regular cup, it’s not the most accurate method. A standard UK mug holds about 284 ml, so 335 ml would be roughly 1.2 mugs. For precise measurements, especially in baking, a proper measuring cup is recommended."
faqQ2: "How does 335 ml of balsamic vinegar compare to other liquids in cups?"
faqA2: "335 ml of balsamic vinegar is approximately 1.42 cups, which is the same as any other liquid of the same volume. However, balsamic vinegar’s thicker consistency might make it slightly harder to pour accurately, so a measuring cup with clear markings is ideal."
faqQ3: "What’s the best way to measure 335 ml of balsamic vinegar for air fryer recipes?"
faqA3: "The best way is to use a liquid measuring cup with metric and imperial markings. Pour the balsamic vinegar up to the 335 ml line, which is roughly 1.42 cups. This ensures your air fryer recipes turn out perfectly every time."
faqQ4: "Can I substitute another vinegar if I don’t have 335 ml of balsamic vinegar?"
faqA4: "Yes, you can substitute with red wine vinegar or apple cider vinegar, but the flavour will differ. Balsamic vinegar has a unique sweetness and depth, so adjust other ingredients accordingly. For precise conversions, check our air fryer conversion chart."

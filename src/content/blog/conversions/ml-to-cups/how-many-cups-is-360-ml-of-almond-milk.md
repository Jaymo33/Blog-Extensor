faqQ1: "Is 360 ml of almond milk the same as 1.5 cups?"
faqA1: "Yes, 360 ml of almond milk is approximately 1.5 cups in the US measurement system, where 1 cup equals 240 ml. In the UK, where a cup is 250 ml, it’s roughly 1.44 cups. Always check your recipe’s origin for the most accurate conversion."
faqQ2: "Can I use a regular cup to measure 360 ml of almond milk?"
faqA2: "While a standard drinking cup isn’t precise, a proper measuring cup with ml and cup markings will give you the most accurate result. For 360 ml of almond milk, fill the cup to the 1.5-cup mark (US) or use a metric jug for exact measurements."
faqQ3: "Does almond milk measure the same as dairy milk in cups?"
faqA3: "Yes, almond milk and dairy milk have similar densities, so 360 ml of almond milk converts to the same cup measurement as dairy milk. However, always shake almond milk well before measuring, as it can separate over time."
faqQ4: "How do I adjust recipes if I only have a 360 ml carton of almond milk?"
faqA4: "If your recipe calls for a different amount, you can scale it up or down using conversions. For example, if a recipe needs 240 ml (1 cup), use two-thirds of your 360 ml carton. Alternatively, check our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipes</a> for dishes that use 360 ml precisely."

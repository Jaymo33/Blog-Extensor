faqQ1: "Is 685 ml of evaporated milk the same as 2.9 cups?"
faqA1: "Yes, 685 ml of evaporated milk is approximately 2.9 cups. This conversion is based on the standard US cup measurement of 240 ml. For UK metric cups (250 ml), it's roughly 2.74 cups. Always check your recipe's measurement system for accuracy."
faqQ2: "Can I use fresh milk instead of evaporated milk in a recipe calling for 685 ml?"
faqA2: "Fresh milk isn't a direct substitute for evaporated milk due to its higher water content. For 685 ml of evaporated milk, you'd need to reduce fresh milk by simmering it until it reduces by about 60%. Alternatively, mix 2 cups of whole milk with ½ cup of melted butter for a similar consistency."
faqQ3: "How do I measure 685 ml of evaporated milk without a measuring jug?"
faqA3: "If you don't have a measuring jug, use a standard cup. For 685 ml, measure just under 3 cups (2.9 cups). A tablespoon holds about 15 ml, so you could also use 45 tablespoons plus 2 teaspoons, though this method is less precise."
faqQ4: "Why do some recipes specify evaporated milk instead of regular milk?"
faqA4: "Evaporated milk has a richer, creamier texture and concentrated flavour due to its reduced water content. It's ideal for recipes requiring thickness, like custards or sauces. In an air fryer, it helps achieve a moist, tender texture in baked goods without excess liquid."

<h2>Why Accurate Measurement Matters</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of evaporated milk can make or break a recipe. Too little, and your dish might lack creaminess; too much, and it could become overly dense. For air fryer recipes, precise measurements are even more critical due to the appliance's rapid cooking process. A slight variation can affect texture and cooking time.</p>

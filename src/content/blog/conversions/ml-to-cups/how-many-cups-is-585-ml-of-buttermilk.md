<h3>UK vs. US Cup Measurements</h3>  
<p>The slight difference between UK and US cup measurements stems from their respective standards. A UK cup holds 250 ml, while a US cup is 240 ml. This means 585 ml of buttermilk converts to 2.47 cups in the UK and 2.48 cups in the US. Though the variance is minimal, it's worth noting for precision baking. If you're using an air fryer, consistency is key, so always measure carefully.</p>  

<h2>How to Measure Buttermilk Without a Scale</h2>  
<p>If you don't have a measuring jug or scale, you can still measure 585 ml of buttermilk using standard cups. Fill a UK cup (250 ml) twice, then add another half cup (125 ml) to reach 585 ml. For US cups, use two full cups (480 ml) and a tablespoon (15 ml) to approximate 585 ml. This method works well for recipes like our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>air fryer cakes</a>, where buttermilk adds moisture and lift.</p>  

<p>Another tip is to use a liquid measuring cup with clear markings for accuracy. Pour the buttermilk slowly to avoid spills, and check at eye level for the correct measurement. For sticky ingredients like buttermilk, lightly greasing the cup can help it slide out easily. Need more air fryer tips?

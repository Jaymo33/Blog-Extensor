faqQ1: "Is 110 ml of almond milk the same as 110 grams?"
faqA1: "No, 110 ml of almond milk is a volume measurement, while 110 grams is a weight measurement. Almond milk's density means 110 ml weighs slightly less than 110 grams (about 105–108 grams). Always use millilitres for liquids and grams for solids in recipes."
faqQ2: "Can I use regular milk instead of almond milk in air fryer recipes?"
faqA2: "Yes, you can substitute regular milk for almond milk in a 1:1 ratio. However, almond milk has a thinner consistency, so adjust other liquids slightly if needed. Dairy milk may also alter the flavour and texture slightly, so consider the recipe’s requirements."
faqQ3: "How do I measure 110 ml of almond milk without a measuring cup?"
faqA3: "Use tablespoons: 1 tablespoon is about 15 ml, so 110 ml equals roughly 7 tablespoons plus 1 teaspoon. Alternatively, a standard teacup holds about 150 ml, so fill it just under three-quarters for 110 ml."
faqQ4: "Does almond milk affect cooking times in the air fryer?"
faqA4: "Almond milk doesn’t significantly change cooking times, but its lower fat content may result in slightly drier outcomes. For moist results, consider adding a teaspoon of oil or reducing the temperature by 5°C when using almond milk in air fryer recipes."

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of almond milk can affect the texture and taste of your air fryer recipes. Too much liquid can make batters runny, while too little may result in dry, crumbly outcomes.

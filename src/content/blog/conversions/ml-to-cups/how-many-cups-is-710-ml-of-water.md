faqQ1: "Is 710 ml of water exactly 3 cups?"
faqA1: "Not quite. While 710 ml is close to 3 cups, the exact conversion depends on the cup standard. In the UK (250 ml per cup), it's about 2.84 cups, and in the US (240 ml per cup), it's roughly 2.96 cups. For most recipes, rounding to 3 cups works fine, but precision matters in baking."
faqQ2: "Can I use a regular drinking cup to measure 710 ml of water?"
faqA2: "It's not recommended, as drinking cups vary in size. For accuracy, use a standard measuring cup or jug. If you must use a drinking cup, check its capacity first—most hold around 240–250 ml, so you'd need just under 3 cups to reach 710 ml."

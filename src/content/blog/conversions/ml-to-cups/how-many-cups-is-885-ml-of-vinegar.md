<p>885 ml of vinegar is roughly 3.7 cups in the US or 3.5 cups in the UK. Whether you're prepping a marinade, pickling vegetables, or cleaning your air fryer, accurate measurements are key. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we know how frustrating it can be when conversions don’t add up. That’s why we’ve broken it down for you—no guesswork needed.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Vinegar Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Vinegar is a staple in many recipes, from tangy dressings to tenderising meats. Using too much or too little can throw off flavours or even affect food safety, especially in pickling.

Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipes</a> section for perfectly balanced ideas.</p>  

<p>In baking, vinegar reacts with baking soda for lift, so exact measurements are crucial. Even when cleaning your air fryer, a diluted vinegar solution needs the right ratio to be effective without residue. That’s why knowing 885 ml of vinegar in cups saves time and hassle.</p>  

<h2>US vs. UK Cup Conversions</h2>  
<p>In the US, 1 cup equals 240 ml, so 885 ml of vinegar is about 3.7 cups. In the UK, where 1 cup is 250 ml, it’s closer to 3.5 cups. This small difference matters in recipes requiring precision. For air fryer cooking, sticking to one system avoids inconsistencies.</p>

faqQ1: "Is 560 ml of beef stock the same as 560 grams?"
faqA1: "Yes, for practical cooking purposes, 560 ml of beef stock equals approximately 560 grams. This is because the density of beef stock is very close to water, where 1 ml equals 1 gram. However, extremely reduced or concentrated stocks might weigh slightly more per ml."
faqQ2: "Can I use chicken stock instead of beef stock in the same quantity?"
faqA2: "Yes, you can substitute chicken stock for beef stock in equal amounts (560 ml for 560 ml). The flavour profile will be different, but the liquid volume remains the same. This works well in most recipes, though the final taste will be lighter and less robust."
faqQ3: "How should I store leftover beef stock after measuring out 560 ml?"
faqA3: "Any unused beef stock should be refrigerated in an airtight container and used within 3-4 days. For longer storage, freeze it in measured portions (like 560 ml batches) for future recipes. Frozen beef stock keeps well for up to 3 months without significant quality loss."
faqQ4: "Why do some recipes use ml while others use cups for beef stock?"
faqA4: "This difference typically depends on the recipe's origin. Metric measurements (ml) are standard in the UK and Europe, while cups are more common in American recipes. Many modern recipes include both, especially on international platforms like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, to cater to all cooks."

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Using the correct amount of beef stock can make or break a recipe. Too little, and your dish may lack depth of flavour; too much, and it could become overly watery.

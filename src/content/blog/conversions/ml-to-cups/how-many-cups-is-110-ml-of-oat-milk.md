faqQ1: "Is 110 ml of oat milk the same as 110 ml of regular milk?"
faqA1: "Yes, 110 ml of oat milk is roughly the same volume as 110 ml of regular milk, as their densities are similar. However, oat milk may be slightly thicker depending on the brand, so for baking, weighing it (about 114 grams) ensures accuracy."

faqA2: "A US cup is 240 ml, so 110 ml of oat milk is just under half a cup (about 0.46 cups). For precise baking, use a metric measuring jug or scale, as slight variations can affect recipes, especially in air fryer cooking."
faqQ3: "How do I measure 110 ml of oat milk without a jug?"
faqA3: "If you don’t have a measuring jug, use a kitchen scale—110 ml of oat milk weighs approximately 114 grams. Alternatively, a tablespoon holds about 15 ml, so 7 tablespoons plus 1 teaspoon will give you roughly 110 ml."
faqQ4: "Why does my recipe call for 110 ml of oat milk instead of cups?"
faqA4: "Many UK and European recipes use millilitres for precision, as cup sizes vary globally. Measuring 110 ml of oat milk ensures consistency, especially in air fryer baking, where exact liquid ratios impact texture and cooking time."

faqQ1: "Is 35 ml of yogurt the same in UK and US cups?"
faqA1: "No, there’s a slight difference. In the UK, 35 ml equals about 0.15 cups, while in the US, it's roughly 0.148 cups. The variation is small but can matter in precise baking. Always check which measurement system your recipe uses."
faqQ2: "Can I use a tablespoon to measure 35 ml of yogurt?"
faqA2: "Yes! One tablespoon holds about 15 ml, so 35 ml is just over 2 tablespoons. For thicker yogurts, spoon it gently to avoid air pockets. This method works well for small quantities in air fryer recipes."
faqQ3: "How does yogurt affect air fryer cooking times?"
faqA3: "Yogurt adds moisture, which can slightly increase cooking times for baked goods. For marinades, it helps tenderise meat faster. Always monitor your dish, as air fryers cook quickly and adjustments may be needed."
faqQ4: "What if I don’t have measuring tools for 35 ml of yogurt?"
faqA4: "A standard shot glass holds about 25-30 ml, so fill it just above the rim for 35 ml. Alternatively, use a 1/4 cup measure and fill it slightly less than halfway. Eyeballing works in a pinch, but for baking, precision is best."

<p>35 ml of yogurt is approximately 0.15 cups (UK) or 0.148 cups (US). If you're using an air fryer for recipes that call for yogurt, getting the measurement right ensures perfect texture and flavour. Whether you're whipping up a cake or marinating chicken, precision matters. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we help you nail every measurement for flawless results.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Yogurt Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of yogurt can make or break a recipe. Too much, and your batter might be too wet; too little, and your dish could turn out dry. For air fryer recipes, consistency is key—especially when making cakes or marinades. A slight variation in yogurt quantity can affect cooking times and textures. That’s why knowing how to convert 35 ml of yogurt to cups is so useful.</p>  

<p>Yogurt adds moisture and tenderness to baked goods, making it a staple in many air fryer recipes. If you're following a recipe from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>our collection</a>, precise measurements ensure your dish turns out just right. Whether you're using Greek or natural yogurt, the conversion remains the same by volume.</p>  

<h3>UK vs. US Cup Measurements</h3>  
<p>In the UK, a standard cup measures 250 ml, while in the US, it's 240 ml. This means 35 ml of yogurt equals roughly 0.15 cups in the UK and 0.148 cups in the US. The difference is minimal but worth noting for precision. If you're using an American recipe, check whether it specifies US or UK measurements to avoid mishaps.</p>  

<h2>How to Measure 35 ml of Yogurt Without a Scale</h2>  
<p>Not everyone has a kitchen scale, but you can still measure 35 ml of yogurt accurately. Use a metric measuring jug or spoons—1 tablespoon holds about 15 ml, so just over 2 tablespoons will give you 35 ml. For those who prefer cups, fill a 1/4 cup measure slightly less than halfway for the UK or just under for the US.</p>  

<p>If you're working with thicker yogurts like Greek yogurt, spoon it into your measuring tool rather than pouring to avoid air gaps. This ensures you get the exact amount needed for recipes like those found in our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert section</a>. Consistency matters, especially in air fryer baking!</p>

faqQ1: "Is 985 ml of single cream the same as 4 cups?"
faqA1: "Not exactly. 985 ml of single cream equals approximately 4.15 UK cups or 4.17 US cups. While it's close to 4 cups, the slight difference can matter in precise baking or air fryer recipes where consistency is key."
faqQ2: "Can I use double cream instead of single cream in this measurement?"
faqA2: "Yes, but be aware that double cream has a higher fat content, which can affect the texture of your dish. If substituting, use the same volume (985 ml or ~4.15 cups), but expect a richer, thicker result, especially in air fryer recipes."
faqQ3: "How do I measure 985 ml of single cream without a measuring jug?"
faqA3: "You can use a standard cup measure. Fill it to the brim four times, then add an extra tablespoon or two to reach 985 ml. For accuracy, a kitchen scale set to grams (1010g) is another reliable option."
faqQ4: "Why does the UK and US cup measurement differ for 985 ml of single cream?"
faqA4: "The UK cup is 236.588 ml, while the US cup is 240 ml. This small variance means 985 ml converts to slightly different cup amounts in each system. For most recipes, the difference is negligible, but for precision baking in an air fryer, it's worth noting."

<h3>Why Single Cream Measurements Matter</h3>  
<p>Single cream has a lower fat content than double cream, making it ideal for lighter sauces and desserts. Using the correct amount ensures your dish isn't too thick or runny. Whether you're making a creamy pasta sauce or a delicate custard in your air fryer, precision is crucial.</p>  

<h2>How to Measure 985 ml of Single Cream</h2>  
<p>If you don't have a measuring jug, you can use a standard cup to measure 985 ml of single cream. Fill the cup to the brim four times, then add an extra tablespoon or two to reach the exact amount. For air fryer recipes, consistency is key, so avoid eyeballing measurements.</p>  

<p>For those who prefer weight over volume, 985 ml of single cream weighs roughly 1010 grams. This can be useful if your recipe uses metric measurements. Explore more <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> that use precise measurements for perfect results.</p>

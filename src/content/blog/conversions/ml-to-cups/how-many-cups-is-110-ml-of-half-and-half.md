faqQ1: "Can I use milk instead of half and half for 110 ml in a recipe?"
faqA1: "Yes, you can substitute milk for half and half, but the result will be less creamy. To mimic the richness of half and half, you can mix 55 ml of milk with 55 ml of heavy cream. This will give you a similar consistency to 110 ml of half and half."
faqQ2: "How do I measure 110 ml of half and half without a measuring jug?"
faqA2: "If you don't have a measuring jug, you can use a standard tablespoon. There are approximately 15 ml in one tablespoon, so 110 ml would be about 7 and a third tablespoons. Alternatively, you can use a kitchen scale to weigh out 113 grams, which is equivalent to 110 ml."
faqQ3: "Is 110 ml of half and half the same in the UK and USA?"
faqA3: "Yes, 110 ml of half and half is the same measurement in both the UK and USA. The difference lies in the terminology; in the UK, it might be referred to as half cream. However, the volume measurement remains consistent across both regions."
faqQ4: "What can I make with 110 ml of half and half in an air fryer?"
faqA4: "You can use 110 ml of half and half to make creamy sauces, soups, or even desserts in your air fryer. Try it in a creamy garlic pasta sauce or a rich chocolate mousse. For more recipe ideas, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipes page</a>."

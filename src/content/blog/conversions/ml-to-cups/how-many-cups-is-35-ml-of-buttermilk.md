faqQ1: "Is 35 ml of buttermilk the same in UK and US cups?"
faqA1: "No, there's a slight difference. In the UK, 35 ml equals 0.15 cups (as a UK cup is 250 ml). In the US, it's 0.148 cups (as a US cup is 240 ml). For most recipes, this small variance won't matter, but for precision baking, it's good to be aware."
faqQ2: "Can I use milk instead of 35 ml of buttermilk in recipes?"
faqA2: "Yes, you can make a buttermilk substitute by adding 1 teaspoon of lemon juice or vinegar to 35 ml of regular milk. Let it sit for 5 minutes to curdle slightly. This works well in most recipes, though the flavour won't be quite as tangy as real buttermilk."
faqQ3: "How do I measure 35 ml of buttermilk without a measuring jug?"
faqA3: "You can use standard spoons - 35 ml is about 7 teaspoons or just under 2.5 tablespoons. For better accuracy, use a medicine measuring cup or syringe if you have one. These are often marked in ml and perfect for small liquid measurements."
faqQ4: "Why do some air fryer recipes call for small amounts like 35 ml of buttermilk?"
faqA4: "Air fryers cook food quickly with circulating hot air, so recipes often use smaller quantities of liquids to prevent sogginess. 35 ml of buttermilk is enough to add moisture and flavour without making food wet. It's perfect for coating meats or adding to small-batch baked goods."

<p>35 ml of buttermilk is approximately 0.15 cups in the UK or 0.148 cups in the US. This small but precise measurement is crucial for baking, where accuracy can make or break your recipe. Whether you're whipping up pancakes, scones, or a moist cake, knowing how to convert 35 ml of buttermilk to cups ensures perfect results every time. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we understand the importance of precise measurements, especially when adapting recipes for your air fryer.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Buttermilk Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Buttermilk adds tanginess and moisture to baked goods, but using too much or too little can affect texture and rise. For example, 35 ml of buttermilk is often called for in small-batch recipes or when making air fryer-friendly treats like mini muffins. If you're working with an air fryer, precise measurements ensure even cooking and perfect browning. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more handy measurement tips.</p>  

<p>In the UK, a standard cup holds 250 ml, while in the US, it's 240 ml. This slight difference means 35 ml of buttermilk converts to roughly 0.15 cups in the UK and 0.148 cups in the US. For most home baking, this tiny variance won't make a noticeable difference, but for precision-focused recipes, it's good to know. If you're scaling up a recipe, like our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>air fryer cake collection</a>, these conversions become even more important.</p>  

<h2>How to Measure 35 ml of Buttermilk Without a Scale</h2>  
<p>Not everyone has a kitchen scale, but you can still measure 35 ml of buttermilk accurately. Use a metric measuring jug and fill it to the 35 ml mark. Alternatively, 35 ml is about 7 teaspoons or just under 2.5 tablespoons. For air fryer recipes, like our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>buttermilk fried chicken</a>, these small measurements are key to achieving that perfect crispy coating.</p>  

<h3>Converting 35 ml of Buttermilk for Different Recipes</h3>  
<p>Whether you're making pancakes, dressings, or marinades, 35 ml of buttermilk can be easily adjusted. If a recipe calls for cups and you only have metric measurements, now you know 35 ml equals roughly 0.15 cups. This conversion works for both UK and US recipes, though for absolute precision, use the exact ml measurement where possible.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for 35 ml of Buttermilk in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Small amounts of buttermilk, like 35 ml, are often used in air fryer recipes to add moisture without making food soggy. For instance, brushing 35 ml of buttermilk on chicken before breading helps the coating stick better. It's also perfect for small batches of scones or biscuits in the air fryer. Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/breakfast>breakfast recipes</a> for more ideas on using buttermilk in your air fryer.</p>  

<p>Another great use for 35 ml of buttermilk is in marinades. The acidity tenderises meat while adding flavour. When cooking in the air fryer, this small quantity is enough to coat a couple of chicken breasts or a small batch of wings.

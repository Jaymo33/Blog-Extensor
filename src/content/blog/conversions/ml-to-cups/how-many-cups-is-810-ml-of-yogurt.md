faqQ1: "Is 810 ml of yogurt the same as 3.5 cups?"
faqA1: "Not quite. 810 ml of yogurt equals approximately 3.42 UK cups or 3.38 US cups. The slight difference depends on which cup measurement your recipe uses. For baking, stick to the exact conversion to avoid texture issues."
faqQ2: "Can I use Greek yogurt for the same measurement?"
faqA2: "Yes, but Greek yogurt is thicker, so spoon it into the measuring cup instead of pouring. Level it off for accuracy. The volume (810 ml) stays the same, but density varies, so adjust other liquids if needed."
faqQ3: "How do I convert 810 ml of yogurt to grams?"
faqA3: "Yogurt’s weight depends on its type. Regular yogurt weighs about 1.03 g/ml, so 810 ml ≈ 834 grams. Greek yogurt is denser (≈1.06 g/ml), so 810 ml ≈ 859 grams. Always check your brand’s nutrition label for precise conversions."
faqQ4: "Why do UK and US cup sizes differ?"
faqA4: "The UK uses the imperial system (284 ml per cup), while the US follows customary units (240 ml). This stems from historical measurement standards. For air fryer recipes, always confirm which system your recipe follows to avoid mishaps."

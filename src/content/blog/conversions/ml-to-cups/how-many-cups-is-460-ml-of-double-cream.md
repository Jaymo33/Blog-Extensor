faqQ1: "Is 460 ml of double cream the same in the UK and USA?"
faqA1: "Yes, 460 ml of double cream is the same volume in both the UK and USA. However, double cream in the UK has a higher fat content (around 48%) compared to heavy cream in the USA (36-40%). The measurement remains the same, but the richness may vary slightly."
faqQ2: "Can I use single cream instead of double cream in air fryer recipes?"
faqA2: "You can substitute single cream, but the texture and richness will differ. Double cream is thicker and holds up better in air fryer cooking. If using single cream, reduce cooking time slightly to prevent curdling."
faqQ3: "How do I measure 460 ml of double cream without a measuring cup?"
faqA3: "Use a kitchen scale for accuracy—460 ml of double cream weighs about 460 grams. Alternatively, a standard mug holds roughly 250 ml, so fill it just under twice for 460 ml."
faqQ4: "What’s the best way to store leftover double cream?"
faqA4: "Keep it in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 3 days. For longer storage, freeze it in ice cube trays and thaw as needed. Stir well before using, as it may separate slightly."

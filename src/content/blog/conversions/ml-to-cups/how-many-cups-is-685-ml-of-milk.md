<p>685 ml of milk is roughly 2.89 cups in the US measurement system and approximately 2.74 cups in the UK metric system. Whether you're whipping up a cake, preparing a creamy sauce, or using your air fryer for a delicious recipe, accurate measurements are key. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we know how frustrating incorrect conversions can be, so we’ve broken it all down for you.</p>  

<h2>Understanding Cup Measurements for Milk</h2>  
<p>Cup measurements can vary depending on where you live. In the US, a standard cup holds 240 ml, while in the UK, it’s 250 ml. This small difference matters when converting 685 ml of milk to cups. For precise cooking and baking, especially in air fryer recipes, knowing which system you’re using is crucial. If you’re following a recipe from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>our collection</a>, always check whether it uses UK or US measurements.</p>  

<p>Why does this matter? Using the wrong cup size can throw off the texture of your dish. Too much milk in an air fryer batter, for example, can make it too runny, while too little can leave it dry. If you’re converting 685 ml of milk for a recipe, always double-check the origin of the measurements.

<h3>US vs. UK Cup Conversions</h3>  
<p>In the US, 685 ml of milk equals about 2.89 cups (since 1 US cup = 240 ml). In the UK, where 1 cup is 250 ml, the same 685 ml converts to roughly 2.74 cups. This difference might seem minor, but in baking, even a slight variation can affect the outcome. If you're making a custard or cake in your air fryer, precision ensures perfect results every time.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Milk Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on even cooking, and liquid measurements play a big role. Whether you're making pancakes, muffins, or a creamy pasta bake, the right amount of milk ensures the right consistency. Too much liquid can lead to soggy results, while too little can dry out your dish. If you're using 685 ml of milk in a recipe, measure carefully for the best texture and flavour.</p>  

<p>For those who love baking in their air fryer, precise measurements are non-negotiable. A classic example is a Victoria sponge—too much milk, and it collapses; too little, and it’s dense.

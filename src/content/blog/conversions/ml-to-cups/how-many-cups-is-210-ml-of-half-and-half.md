faqQ1: "Is 210 ml of half and half the same in US and UK cups?"
faqA1: "No, there’s a slight difference. A US cup is 240 ml, so 210 ml is roughly 0.89 cups. A UK metric cup is 250 ml, making 210 ml about 0.84 cups. Always check your recipe’s origin for accuracy."
faqQ2: "Can I use milk instead of half and half in air fryer recipes?"
faqA2: "Yes, but the texture may differ. Half and half is richer, so substituting milk could make sauces or desserts less creamy. For best results, stick to the recipe or adjust other ingredients accordingly."
faqQ3: "How do I measure 210 ml of half and half without a measuring jug?"
faqA3: "Use tablespoons—14 tablespoons equal 210 ml. Alternatively, a standard US cup holds 240 ml, so fill it just under the top for 210 ml. For UK cups, aim for slightly less than full."
faqQ4: "Why is precise measurement important in air fryer cooking?"
faqA4: "Air fryers cook quickly, so small measurement errors can lead to uneven results. Too much liquid might make food soggy, while too little can dry it out. Always measure ingredients like 210 ml of half and half accurately."

faqQ1: "Is 85 ml of honey the same as 85 grams?"
faqA1: "No, 85 ml of honey is not the same as 85 grams. Honey is denser than water, so 85 ml of honey weighs approximately 102 grams. Always use a kitchen scale for precise measurements in baking or cooking."
faqQ2: "Can I use a liquid measuring cup for 85 ml of honey?"
faqA2: "While you can use a liquid measuring cup, a dry measuring cup is better for thick ingredients like honey. Lightly greasing the cup helps the honey slide out easily, ensuring an accurate measurement."
faqQ3: "How do I convert 85 ml of honey to tablespoons?"
faqA3: "85 ml of honey equals roughly 5.5 tablespoons. Since honey is sticky, level off each tablespoon with a knife for the most accurate measurement."
faqQ4: "Does the type of honey affect the 85 ml to cups conversion?"
faqA4: "The type of honey (e.g., raw, processed) can slightly alter density, but the difference is minimal for most recipes. Stick to the standard 85 ml = 1/3 cup conversion for consistent results."

<p>85 ml of honey is roughly 1/3 cup (0.36 cups to be precise). This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements can make or break your dish. Whether you're baking honey-glazed chicken or whipping up a dessert, knowing how to convert 85 ml of honey to cups ensures perfect results every time.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Honey Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of honey in air fryer recipes ensures balanced flavours and textures. Too much honey can make dishes overly sticky or sweet, while too little might leave them bland. For example, a honey-glazed salmon or crispy honey chicken relies on precise measurements for that perfect caramelisation. If you're exploring recipes on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, you'll notice how exact measurements elevate the dish.</p>  

<p>Honey’s viscosity also affects how it distributes in recipes. Unlike water, honey is thick, so measuring by volume (cups) rather than weight ensures consistency. This is especially important in air fryer cooking, where even heat distribution is key.

<h2>How to Measure 85 ml of Honey Without a Measuring Cup</h2>  
<p>No measuring cup? No problem. A standard tablespoon holds about 15 ml, so 85 ml of honey equals roughly 5.5 tablespoons. Alternatively, use a kitchen scale—honey weighs approximately 340 grams per cup, so 85 ml would be around 102 grams. This method is handy for recipes like honey cakes or glazes where precision matters.</p>  

<h3>Converting 85 ml of Honey for Different Recipes</h3>  
<p>Whether you're making a marinade or a dessert, 85 ml of honey (or 1/3 cup) works perfectly. For example, a honey-mustard glaze for chicken or a drizzle over roasted vegetables in the air fryer benefits from this measurement.

<h2>Common Mistakes When Measuring Honey</h2>  
<p>One mistake is not accounting for honey’s stickiness, which can lead to uneven measurements. To avoid this, lightly grease your measuring spoon or cup with oil before scooping the honey. Another error is using liquid measuring cups for thick ingredients like honey—opt for dry measuring cups instead for accuracy.</p>  

<p>Storing honey properly also ensures consistent measurements. Crystallised honey can throw off your conversions, so gently warm it in a water bath before measuring. For more kitchen hacks, visit <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> and explore our tips section.</p>  

<h3>Adjusting Recipes for UK vs. US Cup Measurements</h3>  
<p>While 85 ml of honey is roughly 1/3 cup in both UK and US measurements, slight variations exist due to cup sizes. US cups are 240 ml, while UK cups are 250 ml. For air fryer recipes, this minor difference rarely impacts the outcome, but it’s good to know if you’re following international recipes.</p>

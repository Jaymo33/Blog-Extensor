faqQ1: "Is 160 ml of milk the same as 160 grams?"
faqA1: "No, 160 ml of milk is not the same as 160 grams. Milk’s density means 160 ml typically weighs around 164 grams due to its fat and protein content. For precise baking, always measure liquids by volume (ml) unless the recipe specifies weight (grams)."
faqQ2: "Can I use a mug to measure 160 ml of milk?"
faqA2: "While a mug can give a rough estimate, it’s not accurate for recipes needing 160 ml of milk. Mugs vary in size, so using a measuring jug or cup ensures consistency. For air fryer recipes, precision helps avoid under or overcooking."
faqQ3: "How do I measure 160 ml of milk without a measuring cup?"
faqA3: "If you don’t have a measuring cup, use tablespoons—160 ml equals about 11 UK tablespoons or 10.8 US tablespoons. Alternatively, fill a standard cup to just under two-thirds for an approximate 160 ml measurement."
faqQ4: "Does the type of milk affect the 160 ml to cups conversion?"
faqA4: "The type of milk (whole, skimmed, or plant-based) doesn’t change the 160 ml to cups conversion, as volume remains consistent. However, thicker milks (like coconut) may settle differently, so stir before measuring for accuracy in air fryer recipes."

<h2>Why Accurate Milk Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of milk can make or break a recipe. Too little, and your dish might turn out dry; too much, and it could become soggy. This is especially true for air fryer recipes, where precise measurements ensure even cooking. If you're whipping up a batch of air-fried pancakes, for example, 160 ml of milk (about 0.68 cups) is a common measurement.

Though the difference seems small, it can affect recipes requiring precision, like custards or batters. Always check whether your recipe uses UK or US measurements for the best results.</p>

<h2>Tips for Measuring Milk Accurately</h2>  
<p>For the most precise measurement, use a liquid measuring cup rather than dry cups. Fill it to the 160 ml mark or just below the 0.68-cup line (UK). If you don’t have measuring tools, remember that 160 ml is roughly two-thirds of a standard cup.

<p>When substituting milk in recipes, consider the fat content—whole, semi-skimmed, or skimmed milk can affect texture. For air fryer baking, whole milk often yields richer results. If using plant-based milk, check its consistency, as some varieties may require slight adjustments to the 160 ml measurement.</p>

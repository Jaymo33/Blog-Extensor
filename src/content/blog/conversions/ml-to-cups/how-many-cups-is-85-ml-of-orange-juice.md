faqQ1: "Is 85 ml of orange juice the same as 85 grams?"
faqA1: "No, ml measures volume, while grams measure weight. For orange juice, 85 ml is roughly 85 grams due to its similar density to water, but this can vary slightly with pulp content. Always check if your recipe specifies weight or volume."
faqQ2: "Can I use bottled orange juice instead of fresh for 85 ml measurements?"
faqA2: "Yes, bottled orange juice works fine for most recipes, though fresh juice may offer a brighter flavour. Just ensure it’s unsweetened if your recipe calls for pure orange juice. The 85 ml measurement remains the same either way."
faqQ3: "How do I convert 85 ml of orange juice to fluid ounces?"
faqA3: "85 ml equals about 2.87 US fluid ounces or 2.99 UK fluid ounces. This conversion is useful for recipes using imperial measurements. Double-check your recipe’s origin to pick the right standard."
faqQ4: "Why do air fryer recipes sometimes use ml instead of cups?"
faqA4: "Many air fryer recipes originate from countries using metric measurements, like the UK or Europe. Ml offers precision, especially for liquids like orange juice. If your air fryer manual uses metric, sticking to ml ensures better results."

<p>85 ml of orange juice is roughly 0.36 cups (US) or 0.3 cups (UK). This conversion is handy for air fryer recipes, baking, or meal prep where precise measurements matter. Whether you’re whipping up a citrus glaze or marinating chicken, knowing how to convert ml to cups ensures accuracy.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on precise ingredient ratios for even cooking and perfect texture. Too much or too little liquid, like orange juice, can affect browning and crispiness. For example, a marinade with 85 ml of orange juice needs the right balance to avoid soggy results.

<p>Recipes from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> often use metric and imperial measurements, so conversions are essential. Whether you’re making glazed salmon or citrus-infused desserts, 85 ml of orange juice translates to just under half a cup in the US. For UK cooks, it’s slightly less due to differing cup sizes.</p>  

<h3>US vs. UK Cup Measurements</h3>  
<p>In the US, 1 cup equals 240 ml, so 85 ml is about 0.36 cups. In the UK, 1 cup is 284 ml, making 85 ml closer to 0.3 cups. Always check your recipe’s origin to avoid mishaps. For air fryer recipes, like our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>orange-glazed chicken</a>, precision ensures crispy skin and juicy meat.</p>  

<h2>How to Measure 85 ml of Orange Juice Without a Scale</h2>  
<p>No measuring jug? Use a tablespoon: 1 tablespoon holds 15 ml, so 85 ml is roughly 5.5 tablespoons. For smaller quantities, a teaspoon (5 ml) can help fine-tune the measurement. This trick works for marinades, dressings, or even <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>citrus desserts</a> in your air fryer.</p>  

<p>Alternatively, repurpose a standard drinking glass. A typical UK glass holds 200 ml, so fill it just under halfway for 85 ml. For US cooks, a 1-cup measuring cup filled to the 1/3 mark will do.

faqQ1: "Is 860 ml of condensed milk the same as one standard can?"
faqA1: "No, 860 ml is slightly more than a standard 400g can of condensed milk, which is roughly 380 ml. If your recipe calls for 860 ml, you’ll need about 2 and 1/4 standard cans. Always check the label for exact millilitre measurements."
faqQ2: "Can I use evaporated milk instead of condensed milk for 860 ml?"
faqA2: "No, evaporated milk and condensed milk are not interchangeable. Condensed milk is sweetened, while evaporated milk is unsweetened. Substituting one for the other will drastically alter the taste and texture of your recipe."
faqQ3: "How do I measure 860 ml of condensed milk without a measuring cup?"
faqA3: "If you don’t have a measuring cup, use a kitchen scale. Condensed milk weighs roughly 1.3 grams per ml, so 860 ml would be about 1,118 grams. Alternatively, use tablespoons (1 cup = 16 tablespoons) for a rough estimate."
faqQ4: "Why do some recipes use ml and others use cups for condensed milk?"
faqA4: "Recipes may use millilitres or cups depending on their origin. Metric measurements (ml) are common in the UK and Europe, while cups are more popular in the US. Always convert carefully to ensure accuracy, especially in baking."

<p>860 ml of condensed milk is approximately 3.6 cups. This conversion is essential for anyone using recipes that list condensed milk in millilitres but require cup measurements. Whether you're baking a cake or preparing a creamy dessert in your air fryer, knowing this conversion ensures accuracy and perfect results every time.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of condensed milk can make or break a recipe. Too little, and your dessert might lack sweetness or creaminess. Too much, and it could become overly dense or sticky. For air fryer recipes, precise measurements are even more critical because the cooking environment is more compact than a conventional oven.

<h3>How to Measure 860 ml of Condensed Milk</h3>  
<p>To measure 860 ml of condensed milk accurately, use a liquid measuring cup with clear millilitre markings. If your cup only shows imperial measurements, remember that 1 cup equals roughly 240 ml. For 860 ml, you’d need just under 3 and 2/3 cups. A kitchen scale can also help verify the weight if your recipe provides gram measurements.</p>  

<h2>Common Recipes Using 860 ml of Condensed Milk</h2>  
<p>Many classic desserts call for condensed milk in this quantity. For example, a large batch of fudge or a layered banoffee pie might require 860 ml. If you're adapting these for the air fryer, ensure you use oven-safe dishes and adjust cooking times accordingly. Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>cake recipes</a> for air fryer-friendly versions of your favourites.</p>  

<p>Condensed milk is also great for no-bake treats like millionaire’s shortbread or ice cream. Since air fryers can’t freeze, stick to recipes that require baking or chilling.

<h3>Adjusting Recipes for Different Measurements</h3>  
<p>If your recipe calls for a different amount of condensed milk, you can easily scale it. For example, 430 ml would be roughly 1.8 cups, while 1,290 ml would be about 5.4 cups. Always double-check conversions to avoid mistakes, especially when baking.

<h2>Tips for Working with Condensed Milk</h2>  
<p>Condensed milk is thick and sticky, so lightly greasing your measuring cup or spoon can help it slide out easily. Warming the can slightly in warm water can also make pouring smoother. If you're using it in an air fryer recipe, ensure it’s evenly distributed to avoid hotspots.</p>  

<p>For best results, store unused condensed milk in an airtight container in the fridge. It can last for weeks, making it a handy ingredient for spontaneous baking sessions. Need more inspiration?

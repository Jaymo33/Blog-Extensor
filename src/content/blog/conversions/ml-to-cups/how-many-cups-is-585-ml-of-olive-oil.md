faqQ1: "Is 585 ml of olive oil the same as 2.5 cups?"
faqA1: "No, 585 ml of olive oil is approximately 2.47 cups, not 2.5. While the difference is small, precise measurements matter in baking and air frying to avoid overly greasy or dry results."
faqQ2: "Can I use a kitchen scale instead of cups to measure 585 ml of olive oil?"
faqA2: "Yes, a kitchen scale is a great alternative. Since olive oil weighs about 0.92 grams per ml, 585 ml would weigh roughly 538 grams. This method is often more accurate than using cups."
faqQ3: "Does the type of olive oil affect the conversion from ml to cups?"
faqA3: "No, whether you use extra virgin or light olive oil, the volume conversion remains the same. However, different types may impact flavour and smoke points in your air fryer."
faqQ4: "How do I measure 585 ml of olive oil if I only have tablespoons?"
faqA4: "One tablespoon holds about 15 ml, so 585 ml would be 39 tablespoons. While possible, using cups or a measuring jug is far quicker and less prone to errors."

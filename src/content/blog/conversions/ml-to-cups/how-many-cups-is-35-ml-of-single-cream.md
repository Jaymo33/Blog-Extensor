faqQ1: "Can I use double cream instead of single cream for 35 ml in air fryer recipes?"
faqA1: "Yes, but double cream has a higher fat content (48%), which can make dishes richer and heavier. For air fryer recipes, stick to single cream unless the recipe specifically calls for double cream. Adjust cooking times slightly if substituting."
faqQ2: "How do I measure 35 ml of single cream without a measuring cup?"
faqA2: "Use a standard tablespoon: 35 ml is roughly 2 tablespoons plus 1 teaspoon. For accuracy, fill the spoon to the brim and level it off. This method works well for small quantities in air fryer cooking."
faqQ3: "Does 35 ml of single cream weigh the same as water?"
faqA3: "No, single cream is slightly denser than water due to its fat content. However, for most air fryer recipes, the difference is negligible. Stick to volume measurements (ml or cups) unless the recipe specifies weight."
faqQ4: "Can I freeze single cream if I only need 35 ml for a recipe?"
faqA4: "Freezing single cream isn’t recommended, as it can separate and become grainy when thawed. Instead, store it in the fridge and use within a few days. For longer storage, consider powdered cream alternatives."

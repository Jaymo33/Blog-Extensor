faqQ1: "Is 860 ml of buttermilk the same in US and UK cups?"
faqA1: "No, there's a slight difference. In the US, 860 ml of buttermilk equals about 3.63 cups (240 ml per cup), while in the UK, it's roughly 3.44 cups (250 ml per cup). Always check which measurement standard your recipe uses to ensure accuracy."
faqQ2: "Can I use a kitchen scale instead of measuring cups for 860 ml of buttermilk?"
faqA2: "Absolutely! Buttermilk weighs roughly 1.03 grams per ml, so 860 ml would be about 886 grams. Using a kitchen scale can be more precise than measuring cups, especially for baking. Just ensure your scale measures in grams for the best results."
faqQ3: "What if I don't have buttermilk? Can I substitute it in a recipe calling for 860 ml?"
faqA3: "Yes, you can make a buttermilk substitute by adding 1 tablespoon of lemon juice or vinegar to every 240 ml of regular milk. For 860 ml, you'd need about 3.5 tablespoons of acid mixed with enough milk to reach the total volume. Let it sit for 5-10 minutes before using."
faqQ4: "How long does 860 ml of buttermilk last in the fridge?"
faqA4: "An unopened carton of buttermilk typically lasts 1-2 weeks past its sell-by date in the fridge. Once opened, use it within 7-10 days. If you can't use it all, freeze portions in ice cube trays for future recipes."

<p>860 ml of buttermilk is approximately 3.63 cups. This conversion is essential for anyone using recipes that require precise measurements, especially when baking or preparing dishes in an air fryer. Whether you're making fluffy pancakes or a tangy marinade, knowing how to convert 860 ml of buttermilk to cups ensures your dish turns out perfectly every time.</p>  

<h2>Understanding the Conversion</h2>  
<p>Converting millilitres to cups can be tricky, but it's straightforward once you know the ratio. One standard metric cup holds 240 ml of liquid. Therefore, to find out how many cups 860 ml of buttermilk equals, you simply divide 860 by 240. The result is roughly 3.63 cups, which you can round to 3 and 2/3 cups for practicality.</p>  

<p>This conversion is particularly useful for air fryer recipes, where precision can affect cooking times and textures. For example, if you're making buttermilk-battered chicken in your air fryer, accurate measurements ensure the coating crisps up just right.

<h3>Why Accuracy Matters in Baking</h3>  
<p>Baking is a science, and even small measurement errors can lead to disappointing results. Using the correct amount of buttermilk—whether 860 ml or another quantity—ensures your cakes rise properly and your batters have the right consistency.

Whether you're whipping up a dessert or glazing meats, knowing how to convert millilitres to cups ensures consistency and delicious results every time.</p>

<h2>Understanding Maple Syrup Measurements</h2>
<p>Maple syrup is a staple in many kitchens, especially for those who love baking or using their air fryer for sweet and savoury dishes. When a recipe calls for 660 ml of maple syrup, it's helpful to know that this translates to roughly 2.8 cups. This measurement is based on the standard US cup, which holds 240 ml. If you're in the UK, where a cup is 250 ml, the conversion is slightly different, coming to about 2.64 cups.</p>
<p>For air fryer recipes, precision is key. Whether you're making <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>desserts</a> or glazing meats, using the correct amount of maple syrup ensures the right balance of sweetness and texture. If you're unsure, always measure your ingredients carefully to avoid overly sticky or dry results.</p>

<h3>Why Accurate Measurements Matter</h3>
<p>Using the right amount of maple syrup can affect the texture, flavour, and even the cooking time of your dish. Too much syrup can make your food overly sweet or cause it to burn in the air fryer, while too little might leave it lacking in flavour. This is especially important for recipes like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer pancakes</a> or glazed salmon, where maple syrup plays a starring role.</p>

<h2>Converting 660 ml of Maple Syrup to Cups</h2>
<p>To convert 660 ml of maple syrup to cups, you can use a simple formula: divide the millilitres by the volume of one cup. In the US, one cup is 240 ml, so 660 ml divided by 240 ml equals 2.75 cups. For practical purposes, this is often rounded to 2.8 cups. In the UK, where a cup is 250 ml, the calculation is 660 divided by 250, giving you 2.64 cups.</p>
<p>If you don't have a measuring cup handy, you can use a kitchen scale. Maple syrup weighs approximately 312 grams per cup (240 ml), so 660 ml would weigh around 858 grams. This method is handy if you're working with a recipe that lists ingredients by weight rather than volume.</p>

<h3>Tips for Measuring Maple Syrup</h3>
<p>Maple syrup is sticky and can be tricky to measure accurately. To make it easier, lightly grease your measuring cup with oil or spray before pouring in the syrup. This helps the syrup slide out cleanly, ensuring you get the exact amount needed. For air fryer recipes, this precision can prevent messy clean-ups and ensure even cooking.</p>

<h2>Using Maple Syrup in Air Fryer Recipes</h2>
<p>Maple syrup isn't just for pancakesâ€”it's a versatile ingredient that works wonderfully in air fryer recipes. From glazing chicken wings to sweetening <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>desserts</a>, its rich flavour enhances both sweet and savoury dishes. When using 660 ml of maple syrup (or 2.8 cups), you can create enough glaze or sauce for multiple servings, making it ideal for meal prep.</p>
<p>For example, a popular air fryer recipe is maple-glazed salmon. Mix 660 ml of maple syrup with soy sauce, garlic, and ginger for a delicious marinade. The air fryer cooks the salmon evenly, while the syrup caramelises slightly, adding a delightful crunch.

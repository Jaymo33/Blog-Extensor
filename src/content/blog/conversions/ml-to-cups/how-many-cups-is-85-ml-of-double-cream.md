faqQ1: "Can I use single cream instead of double cream if I only have 85 ml?"
faqA1: "Yes, you can substitute single cream for double cream, but the result will be less rich. Single cream has a lower fat content, so your dish might not be as creamy. Adjust other ingredients if needed to compensate for the difference in texture."
faqQ2: "How do I measure 85 ml of double cream without a measuring jug?"
faqA2: "If you don't have a measuring jug, you can use tablespoons. One tablespoon is roughly 15 ml, so 85 ml would be about 5.5 tablespoons. For more precise conversions, check our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>."
faqQ3: "Does 85 ml of double cream weigh the same as 85 ml of water?"
faqA3: "No, double cream is denser than water due to its higher fat content. While 85 ml of water weighs 85 grams, 85 ml of double cream weighs around 90 grams. Always measure by volume for recipes calling for ml or cups."
faqQ4: "Can I freeze 85 ml of double cream for later use?"
faqA4: "Freezing double cream is possible, but it may separate when thawed. It's best used in cooked dishes like soups or sauces after freezing. For whipping or fresh applications, it's better to use fresh double cream."

<p>85 ml of double cream is approximately 0.36 cups. This conversion is handy for recipes that call for precise measurements, especially when using an air fryer. Whether you're whipping up a dessert or adding richness to a savoury dish, knowing how to convert ml to cups ensures your recipe turns out perfectly every time.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter</h2>
<p>When it comes to baking or cooking, precision is key. Double cream, with its high fat content, can significantly alter the texture and taste of your dish if not measured correctly. Using 85 ml of double cream instead of the required 0.36 cups could throw off your recipe, leading to overly rich or runny results. That's why it's essential to get the conversion right, especially for air fryer recipes where consistency matters.</p>
<p>At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we understand the importance of accurate measurements. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> can help you quickly switch between metric and imperial units, so you never have to guess again. Whether you're making a creamy sauce or a decadent dessert, precise measurements ensure success.</p>

<h2>How to Measure 85 ml of Double Cream</h2>
<p>Measuring 85 ml of double cream is straightforward if you have the right tools. A liquid measuring cup with ml markings is ideal, but if you only have cups, you'll need to convert. As mentioned, 85 ml equals roughly 0.36 cups. For best results, use a measuring jug with both ml and cup markings to avoid errors.</p>
<p>If you're using an air fryer, consider the consistency of your dish. Double cream adds richness, so even small deviations can affect the outcome. For example, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> often call for precise amounts of double cream to achieve the perfect texture. Too much can make dishes greasy, while too little might leave them dry.</p>

<p>Different recipes may require slight adjustments when converting 85 ml of double cream to cups. For baking, precision is crucial, so stick to 0.36 cups. For cooking, you might have more flexibility, but it's still best to measure accurately.

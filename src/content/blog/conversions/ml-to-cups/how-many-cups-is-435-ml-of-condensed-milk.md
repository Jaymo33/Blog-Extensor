faqQ1: "Is 435 ml of condensed milk the same as one standard can?"
faqA1: "Yes, 435 ml is the typical size of a standard can of condensed milk in many countries, including the UK. This measurement is roughly 1.84 US cups, making it easy to use in recipes without additional conversions."
faqQ2: "Can I use evaporated milk instead of condensed milk for 435 ml?"
faqA2: "No, evaporated milk is unsweetened and thinner, while condensed milk is sweetened and thick. Substituting them will affect both texture and taste. If you must swap, adjust sugar levels and cooking times accordingly."
faqQ3: "How do I measure 435 ml of condensed milk without a measuring cup?"
faqA3: "Use a kitchen scale: 435 ml of condensed milk weighs about 500 grams. Alternatively, a standard can is usually 435 ml, so you can use the entire can if the recipe allows."
faqQ4: "Why do some recipes list condensed milk in grams instead of ml?"
faqA4: "Weight (grams) is more precise than volume (ml) for thick ingredients like condensed milk. However, 435 ml ≈ 500g, so you can use either measure if your recipe specifies one or the other. Always check the recipe's preferred unit."

<p>435 ml of condensed milk is approximately 1.84 cups when measured in standard US cups. This conversion is essential for baking and cooking, especially when using an air fryer for desserts like fudge or cakes. Whether you're following a recipe from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> or improvising, knowing this measurement ensures consistency.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Precision is key in baking, and condensed milk is no exception. Too much or too little can alter the texture and sweetness of your dish. For air fryer recipes, such as those found in our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>dessert section</a>, exact measurements ensure even cooking and perfect results. Condensed milk is thick and sticky, so using the right amount avoids overly dense or runny outcomes.</p>  

<p>Many UK and US recipes differ in measurements, so converting 435 ml of condensed milk to cups correctly bridges this gap. If you're using an air fryer for baking, check our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a> for other common ingredient swaps.

<h3>How to Measure 435 ml of Condensed Milk</h3>  
<p>To measure 435 ml of condensed milk accurately, use a liquid measuring cup with clear markings. Pour slowly to avoid air bubbles, and level off the top with a spatula. If you don’t have a measuring cup, a kitchen scale set to grams (435 ml ≈ 500g) can also work. For air fryer recipes, like those in our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>cake category</a>, precision ensures even baking.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for 435 ml of Condensed Milk</h2>

<h3>Adjusting Recipes for Different Cup Sizes</h3>  
<p>Note that US and UK cup sizes differ slightly (1 US cup = 240 ml, 1 UK cup = 250 ml). For 435 ml of condensed milk, this means roughly 1.81 UK cups or 1.84 US cups. Most recipes on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> use US measurements, so double-check if adapting from another source. Small variations can affect air fryer baking times.</p>  

<h2>Tips for Working With Condensed Milk</h2>  
<p>Condensed milk is sticky, so lightly greasing your measuring cup or spoon helps it slide out easily. For air fryer recipes, warming the can slightly (in warm water) makes pouring smoother. If you’re scaling a recipe up or down, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion guide</a> simplifies adjustments.

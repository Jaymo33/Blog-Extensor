faqQ1: "Does 435 ml of coconut milk equal one standard can?"
faqA1: "No, a standard can of coconut milk is usually 400 ml, so 435 ml is slightly more. If your recipe calls for 435 ml, you’ll need to measure it separately or use a can plus a small extra amount."
faqQ2: "Can I use coconut cream instead of coconut milk for 435 ml?"
faqA2: "Coconut cream is thicker and richer, so substituting it directly may alter your recipe’s texture. If using cream, dilute it with water (typically a 1:1 ratio) to match the consistency of coconut milk."
faqQ3: "How do I measure 435 ml of coconut milk without a measuring cup?"
faqA3: "A kitchen scale is the best alternative. Set it to grams (since 1 ml of coconut milk weighs roughly 1 gram), and measure 435 grams. Alternatively, use tablespoons (15 ml each) for a close approximation."
faqQ4: "Why does my coconut milk measurement look different after stirring?"
faqA4: "Coconut milk separates naturally, with cream rising to the top. Stirring recombines the layers, ensuring a consistent measurement. Always mix well before using for accurate results in air fryer recipes."

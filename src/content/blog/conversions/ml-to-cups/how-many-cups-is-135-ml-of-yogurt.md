faqQ1: "Is 135 ml of yogurt the same as 135 grams?"
faqA1: "No, 135 ml of yogurt isn’t always equal to 135 grams. The weight depends on the yogurt's density. Regular yogurt weighs roughly 1 gram per ml, but thicker varieties like Greek yogurt can be heavier. For precise baking, use a scale if the recipe specifies grams."
faqQ2: "Can I use 135 ml of plant-based yogurt in air fryer recipes?"
faqA2: "Absolutely! Plant-based yogurts work well in air fryer recipes, though their consistency may vary. Coconut or almond yogurt can replace dairy yogurt at a 1:1 ratio (135 ml or 0.57 cups). Adjust cooking times slightly if the batter seems thinner or thicker."
faqQ3: "How do I measure 135 ml of yogurt without a measuring cup?"
faqA3: "Use a tablespoon (15 ml) to measure 135 ml—it’s about 9 tablespoons. For thicker yogurt, spoon it into the tablespoon and level it off. This method is handy for small-batch air fryer recipes where precision matters."
faqQ4: "Why do some recipes use ml and others use cups for yogurt?"
faqA4: "Recipes vary by region—UK and European recipes often use ml, while US recipes prefer cups. For air fryer cooking, stick to the recipe’s original units (135 ml or 0.57 cups) unless converting.

At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we understand how precise measurements can make or break a dish, especially when using an air fryer.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Yogurt Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of yogurt is crucial for achieving the right texture and moisture in your dishes. Too much can make baked goods soggy, while too little can leave them dry. If you're adapting a recipe for your air fryer, like those found in our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipes section</a>, precision is key. Yogurt adds richness and tenderness, so getting the 135 ml to cups conversion right matters.</p>  

<p>For air fryer cooking, yogurt is often used in marinades or as a binding agent. Whether you're making chicken skewers or a moist cake, knowing that 135 ml of yogurt equals roughly 0.57 cups helps streamline your prep. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more handy measurement swaps.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure 135 ml of Yogurt Without a Scale</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a measuring jug, you can use a standard metric cup. Fill it just over halfway to reach 135 ml. For thicker yogurts like Greek yogurt, spoon it into the cup and level it off for accuracy. This method works well for air fryer recipes, ensuring consistency in dishes like our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipes</a>.</p>  

<h2>Converting 135 ml of Yogurt in UK vs. US Cups</h2>  
<p>In the UK, 1 cup equals 250 ml, meaning 135 ml is roughly 0.54 UK cups. In the US, 1 cup is 240 ml, so 135 ml converts to about 0.56 US cups. The difference is minimal but worth noting for precision baking. If you're following an American recipe for your air fryer, stick to the US measurement.</p>  

<p>For air fryer-friendly desserts like muffins or pancakes, this small variance won’t ruin your dish. However, for delicate bakes, like those in our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>cakes category</a>, sticking to the exact 135 ml (0.57 cups) ensures perfection. Always use the same measuring system as your recipe to avoid confusion.</p>

<h2>Tips for Working with Yogurt in Air Fryer Recipes</h2>

If substituting Greek yogurt, note that it’s thicker, so you may need a splash of water to match 135 ml’s consistency.</p>

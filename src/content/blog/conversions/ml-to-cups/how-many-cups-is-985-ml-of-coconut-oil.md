faqQ1: "Is 985 ml of coconut oil the same as 4.16 cups in all countries?"
faqA1: "While 985 ml of coconut oil equals approximately 4.16 cups in the UK and US, cup sizes can vary slightly in other countries. Always double-check local measurements if you're using a recipe from a different region. For air fryer recipes, sticking to metric or imperial conversions ensures consistency."
faqQ2: "Can I use 985 ml of coconut oil for deep frying in an air fryer?"
faqA2: "Air fryers use minimal oil compared to deep fryers, so 985 ml of coconut oil would be excessive. Instead, lightly coat your ingredients with a small amount for crispiness. For deep-frying, traditional methods are more suitable, but air fryers excel with just a fraction of the oil."
faqQ3: "How do I store leftover coconut oil after measuring 985 ml?"
faqA3: "Store leftover coconut oil in an airtight container in a cool, dark place. If you've melted it for measuring, let it solidify before storing. Proper storage keeps it fresh for future air fryer recipes, ensuring you can use the remaining oil without waste."
faqQ4: "What’s the best way to measure 985 ml of coconut oil for baking?"
faqA4: "For baking, measure 985 ml of coconut oil (4.16 cups) using a liquid measuring cup if melted or a dry measuring cup if solid. Level it off for accuracy. If your recipe calls for melted oil, measure it after melting to ensure precision in your air fryer baked goods."

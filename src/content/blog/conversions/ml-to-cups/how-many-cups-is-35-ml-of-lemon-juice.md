faqQ1: "Is 35 ml of lemon juice the same as 35 grams?"
faqA1: "No, 35 ml of lemon juice is roughly 36 grams due to its density. While the difference is minor, it’s best to measure liquids by volume (ml) for accuracy in recipes. For air fryer cooking, stick to millilitres unless the recipe specifies weight."
faqQ2: "Can I use bottled lemon juice instead of fresh for 35 ml?"
faqA2: "Yes, bottled lemon juice works if fresh isn’t available. However, fresh lemon juice has a brighter flavour and no preservatives. For air fryer recipes, fresh is ideal, but bottled is a convenient substitute in the same 35 ml quantity."
faqQ3: "How many lemons do I need for 35 ml of juice?"
faqA3: "One medium lemon yields about 45-50 ml of juice, so you’ll need roughly 3/4 of a lemon for 35 ml. Roll the lemon on a counter before juicing to maximise yield. For air fryer recipes, fresh juice enhances marinades and glazes."
faqQ4: "What’s the best way to measure 35 ml without a measuring cup?"
faqA4: "Use tablespoons: 2 tablespoons (30 ml) plus 1 teaspoon (5 ml) equals 35 ml. Alternatively, a standard shot glass is often 30-50 ml. For air fryer cooking, precision matters, so a measuring jug or spoons are best for consistent results."

<p>35 ml of lemon juice equals approximately 0.148 cups (or roughly 1/7 of a cup). This conversion is handy for recipes, especially when using an air fryer where precise measurements matter. Whether you’re baking a lemon drizzle cake or marinating chicken, knowing this conversion ensures your dish turns out perfectly.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>
<p>Air fryers cook food quickly and evenly, but they rely on precise ingredient ratios for the best results. Too much or too little lemon juice can affect the texture and flavour of your dish. For example, a <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>lemon-infused air fryer chicken recipe</a> might call for 35 ml of lemon juice to balance acidity and tenderness. Measuring correctly ensures your meal isn’t overly tart or bland.</p>
<p>Lemon juice is also a key ingredient in marinades, dressings, and desserts. If you’re preparing a <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>lemon drizzle cake in your air fryer</a>, 35 ml of lemon juice adds just the right zingy kick. Using a measuring jug or spoons can help, but knowing the cup equivalent saves time and reduces cleanup.</p>

<h2>How to Convert 35 ml of Lemon Juice to Cups</h2>
<p>Converting millilitres to cups is straightforward once you know the ratio. One standard US cup holds 240 ml, while a UK metric cup is 250 ml. For 35 ml of lemon juice, the calculation is simple: divide 35 by 240 (or 250) to get the cup measurement. This gives you roughly 0.148 cups (US) or 0.14 cups (UK).</p>
<p>If you don’t have a measuring cup handy, you can use tablespoons. Since 1 tablespoon equals 15 ml, 35 ml is just over 2 tablespoons (30 ml) plus 1 teaspoon (5 ml). This method is handy for quick adjustments while cooking. For more conversions, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>

<h3>Common Uses for 35 ml of Lemon Juice</h3>
<p>Lemon juice is versatile in both savoury and sweet dishes. In air fryer cooking, 35 ml can be used to marinate <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken</a> or fish, adding brightness without overpowering. It’s also great for deglazing pans or mixing into sauces. For desserts, 35 ml of lemon juice can be whisked into icing or drizzled over cakes for a tangy finish.</p>

<h3>Tips for Measuring Lemon Juice Accurately</h3>
<p>Freshly squeezed lemon juice is best for flavour, but bottled works in a pinch. To measure 35 ml, use a liquid measuring cup with clear markings. If you’re using a scale, note that 35 ml of lemon juice weighs about 36 grams. Always measure at eye level to avoid over- or under-pouring. After use, clean your air fryer basket with <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner</a> to remove any sticky residue.</p>

<h2>Adjusting Recipes for Different Measurements</h2>
<p>Recipes sometimes list lemon juice in tablespoons, millilitres, or cups. If a recipe calls for 35 ml and you only have cups, now you know it’s roughly 0.148 cups. Conversely, if a recipe uses cups and you prefer millilitres, multiply the cup amount by 240 (or 250) to convert. This flexibility is especially useful for adapting <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable</a> or seafood recipes to your taste.</p>
<p>Remember, air fryers intensify flavours, so a little lemon juice goes a long way. Start with 35 ml and adjust as needed. Too much acidity can dry out proteins, while too little might leave dishes tasting flat. Experiment to find your perfect balance.</p>

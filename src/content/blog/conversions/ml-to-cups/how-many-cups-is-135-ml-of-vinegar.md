faqQ1: "Is 135 ml of vinegar the same as 135 grams?"
faqA1: "No, 135 ml of vinegar is not the same as 135 grams. Since vinegar’s density is close to water, 135 ml weighs roughly 135 grams, but this can vary slightly depending on the vinegar type. For precise baking, always measure by volume (ml or cups) unless the recipe specifies weight."
faqQ2: "Can I use 135 ml of vinegar for cleaning my air fryer?"
faqA2: "Yes! Vinegar is a natural cleaner that removes grease and odours. Mix 135 ml of vinegar with water (1:1 ratio) and wipe down your air fryer basket. For stubborn stains, let it sit for a few minutes before scrubbing. Always rinse thoroughly after cleaning."
faqQ3: "How does 135 ml of vinegar affect air-fried chicken?"
faqA3: "135 ml of vinegar in a marinade tenderises chicken and adds tangy flavour. When air-fried, the acidity helps create a crispy exterior while keeping the meat juicy. For best results, marinate for at least 30 minutes before cooking."
faqQ4: "What’s the best way to measure 135 ml of vinegar without a measuring cup?"
faqA4: "If you don’t have a measuring cup, use a standard drinking glass (approx. 240 ml) and fill it just over halfway for 135 ml. Alternatively, 9 tablespoons equal roughly 135 ml. For accuracy, invest in a liquid measuring cup with metric and imperial markings."

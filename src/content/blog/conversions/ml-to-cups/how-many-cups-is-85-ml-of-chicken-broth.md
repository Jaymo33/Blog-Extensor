faqQ1: "Is 85 ml of chicken broth the same in the UK and US?"
faqA1: "Yes, 85 ml is a metric measurement and remains the same in both the UK and US. However, cup sizes differ slightly—the US uses 240 ml per cup, while the UK uses 250 ml. For 85 ml, the difference is negligible (0.36 US cups vs. 0.34 UK cups)."
faqQ2: "Can I use stock instead of broth for the same measurement?"
faqA2: "Absolutely! Chicken stock and broth can be used interchangeably in most recipes, including air fryer dishes. Both 85 ml of stock or broth will measure the same in cups (about 0.36 cups). Just note that stock is typically richer, so adjust seasoning if needed."
faqQ3: "How do I measure 85 ml of chicken broth without a measuring cup?"
faqA3: "If you don’t have a measuring cup, use a tablespoon—1 tablespoon is about 15 ml, so 5.5 tablespoons equal roughly 85 ml. Alternatively, a standard UK mug holds about 250 ml, so filling it to just under a third will give you close to 85 ml."
faqQ4: "Does 85 ml of chicken broth change weight when reduced?"
faqA4: "Reducing chicken broth evaporates water, concentrating flavour but reducing volume. For example, simmering 85 ml down to a glaze might halve the volume, but the weight will decrease proportionally. Always measure after reducing if precision is crucial."

<p>85 ml of chicken broth equals approximately 0.36 cups (just over 1/3 cup). This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes, where precise measurements can make or break a dish. Whether you're making soups, sauces, or marinades, knowing how to convert millilitres to cups ensures consistent results every time.</p>  

<h2>Understanding the Conversion: 85 ml to Cups</h2>  
<p>Converting millilitres to cups can be tricky, especially when working with liquids like chicken broth. In the UK, metric measurements are standard, but many recipes—especially those from the US—use cups. For 85 ml of chicken broth, the conversion is roughly 0.36 cups, or just over a third of a cup. This measurement is particularly useful when adapting recipes for your air fryer, where liquid quantities can affect cooking times and textures.</p>  

<p>If you're using an air fryer for dishes like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipes</a>, precise broth measurements ensure your marinades or sauces aren’t too watery. A handy <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> can help you switch between metric and imperial measurements effortlessly.</p>  

<h3>Why Accuracy Matters in Air Fryer Cooking</h3>  
<p>Air fryers circulate hot air rapidly, so excess liquid can lead to steaming rather than crisping. Whether you're making a glaze or a broth-based sauce, measuring 85 ml of chicken broth correctly ensures your dish turns out perfectly. Too much liquid can also cause spills, making cleanup a hassle—check out our guide on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning your air fryer</a> for tips.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for 85 ml of Chicken Broth</h2>  
<p>Chicken broth is a versatile ingredient, and 85 ml (or 0.36 cups) is often used in small-batch recipes. For example, it’s perfect for deglazing an air fryer pan after cooking chicken or adding moisture to <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>roasted vegetables</a>. It’s also ideal for making jus or light sauces to accompany air-fried meats.</p>  

<p>If you're scaling up a recipe, remember that 170 ml would be roughly 0.72 cups (just under 3/4 cup). Keeping these conversions in mind helps maintain flavour balance, especially in dishes like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer casseroles</a> or stews.</p>  

<h3>Measuring Tools for Precision</h3>  
<p>For the most accurate results, use a liquid measuring cup with millilitre markings. If you only have standard cups, fill it to just over the 1/3 cup line to approximate 85 ml. A kitchen scale can also help—85 ml of chicken broth weighs roughly 85 grams, assuming a similar density to water.</p>

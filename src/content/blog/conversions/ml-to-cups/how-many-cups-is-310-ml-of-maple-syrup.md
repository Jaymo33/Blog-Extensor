faqA3: "Store opened maple syrup in the fridge to prevent mould growth. Keep it in an airtight container, and itâ€™ll last for several months. Reheat gently before use if it thickens too much."
faqQ4: "Does the type of maple syrup affect the 310 ml to cups conversion?"
faqA4: "No, the conversion remains the same whether you use light, medium, or dark maple syrup. However, darker syrups have a stronger flavour, so adjust quantities based on taste preferences."

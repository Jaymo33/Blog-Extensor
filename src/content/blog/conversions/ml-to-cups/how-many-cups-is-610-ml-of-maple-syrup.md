faqQ1: "Is 610 ml of maple syrup the same as 610 grams?"

faqA3: "Once opened, 610 ml of maple syrup can last up to a year if stored properly in the fridge. Keep it in an airtight container to prevent crystallization and maintain its quality. Always check for mould or off smells before using."
faqQ4: "What’s the best way to measure 610 ml of maple syrup without making a mess?"

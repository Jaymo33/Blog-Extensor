faqQ1: "Is 985 ml of chicken broth the same as 1 litre?"
faqA1: "No, 985 ml is slightly less than 1 litre (1000 ml). This small difference can affect recipes, especially in air fryer cooking where liquid amounts impact texture. Always measure carefully for best results."
faqQ2: "Can I use stock cubes instead of 985 ml of liquid chicken broth?"
faqA2: "Yes, but follow the stock cube’s instructions to match 985 ml. Typically, one cube dissolved in boiling water makes about 500 ml, so you’d need roughly two cubes. Adjust seasoning since stock cubes are saltier."
faqQ3: "Why do UK and US cup measurements differ for 985 ml of chicken broth?"
faqA3: "The UK uses an imperial cup (284 ml), while the US uses a customary cup (240 ml). This means 985 ml converts to fewer UK cups. Always check which system your recipe uses to avoid errors."
faqQ4: "How do I measure 985 ml of chicken broth without a measuring cup?"
faqA4: "Use a kitchen scale: 985 ml of chicken broth weighs about 985 grams. Alternatively, a standard mug holds roughly 300 ml, so three mugs plus a bit extra will approximate 985 ml. For precision, invest in measuring tools."

<p>985 ml of chicken broth equals approximately 4.16 cups in the US measurement system or 3.46 cups in the UK system. Whether you're preparing a hearty soup or a flavourful risotto in your air fryer, accurate measurements ensure the best results. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we know how crucial precision is for air fryer cooking, so let’s break this down.</p>  

<h2>Understanding Cup Measurements for Chicken Broth</h2>  
<p>Chicken broth is a staple in many recipes, from soups to casseroles. Knowing how to convert millilitres to cups helps avoid guesswork. In the US, 1 cup equals 240 ml, while in the UK, it’s 284 ml. This means 985 ml of chicken broth converts to roughly 4.16 US cups or 3.46 UK cups. Always check your recipe’s origin to ensure accuracy.</p>  

<p>For air fryer recipes, liquid measurements matter—too much broth can make dishes soggy, while too little dries them out. If you’re adapting a traditional recipe for your air fryer, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> simplifies adjustments. Whether you’re making a chicken stew or a savoury gravy, precise measurements guarantee success.</p>  

<h3>Why Accurate Conversions Matter</h3>  
<p>Using the wrong cup measurement can throw off a recipe’s balance. For example, 985 ml of chicken broth in a UK recipe measured with US cups adds extra liquid, potentially diluting flavours. Air fryer cooking relies on even heat distribution, so consistency is key. Always double-check whether your recipe uses metric or imperial measurements.</p>  

<h2>Converting 985 ml of Chicken Broth for Cooking</h2>  
<p>If your recipe calls for 985 ml of chicken broth, you’ll need about 4 and 1/6 US cups or 3 and 1/2 UK cups. Measuring cups with clear ml and cup markings help, but a kitchen scale is even more precise. For air fryer-friendly dishes like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipes</a>, accuracy ensures perfect texture and taste.</p>  

<p>When scaling recipes, remember that 985 ml is just under a litre (1000 ml). This is useful for batch cooking or meal prep.

Proper measurements prevent overcooking or uneven results.</p>  

<h3>Tips for Measuring Chicken Broth</h3>  
<p>For sticky or thick broths, lightly grease your measuring cup to ensure all liquid pours out. If substituting stock cubes or powder for 985 ml of liquid broth, follow package instructions for dilution. Air fryer recipes often need less liquid than oven-baked ones, so adjust accordingly.

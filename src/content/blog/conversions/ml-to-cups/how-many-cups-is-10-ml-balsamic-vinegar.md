faqQ1: "How do I measure 10 ml of balsamic vinegar without a measuring spoon?"
faqA1: "If you don’t have a measuring spoon, use a standard teaspoon, which holds about 5 ml. Two level teaspoons will give you roughly 10 ml of balsamic vinegar. Alternatively, a small medicine cup with ml markings can work in a pinch."
faqQ2: "Can I use 10 ml of balsamic vinegar in place of other vinegars?"
faqA2: "Yes, but keep in mind balsamic vinegar is sweeter and thicker than white or apple cider vinegar. For dressings or marinades, 10 ml of balsamic vinegar can often substitute for other vinegars, but you may need to adjust sweetness or acidity elsewhere in the recipe."
faqQ3: "How does 10 ml of balsamic vinegar affect air fryer cooking times?"
faqA3: "10 ml of balsamic vinegar won’t significantly change cooking times, but it can add moisture. If using it in a marinade or glaze, ensure it’s evenly distributed to prevent uneven cooking. Always pat excess liquid off ingredients before air frying."
faqQ4: "Is 10 ml of balsamic vinegar the same in UK and US measurements?"
faqA4: "Yes, 10 ml is a metric measurement and is the same worldwide. However, cup sizes differ slightly between the UK and US. In both, 10 ml of balsamic vinegar equals approximately 0.042 cups, but always double-check if using a recipe from another country."

faqQ1: "Is 585 ml of tomato sauce the same as 2.5 cups?"
faqA1: "Not exactly. 585 ml of tomato sauce equals approximately 2.47 UK cups (250 ml per cup) or 2.44 US cups (240 ml per cup). The slight difference matters in baking, where precision is key. Always check which cup measurement your recipe uses."
faqQ2: "Can I use a regular drinking cup to measure 585 ml of tomato sauce?"
faqA2: "It’s not recommended, as drinking cups vary in size. For accuracy, use a standard metric measuring cup. If you must improvise, note that a UK mug averages 284 ml, so you’d need about 2 mugs plus an extra 17 ml for 585 ml."
faqQ3: "Why do some recipes use millilitres instead of cups for tomato sauce?"
faqA3: "Millilitres provide precise liquid measurements, especially important in baking and air fryer cooking where ratios affect texture. Cups are more common in volume-based recipes, but professional chefs often prefer ml for consistency across international recipes."
faqQ4: "How does 585 ml of tomato sauce affect cooking time in an air fryer?"
faqA4: "Saucy dishes with 585 ml may need slightly longer cooking to evaporate excess moisture. Always preheat your air fryer and check doneness with a skewer. Thicker sauces cook faster, while watery ones may require an extra 2-3 minutes."

<p>Using the correct amount of tomato sauce ensures your air fryer dishes turn out perfectly every time. Too much sauce can make meals soggy, while too little may leave them dry.

<h3>How to Measure 585 ml of Tomato Sauce Without a Scale</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a measuring jug, use standard cup sizes for accuracy. A UK metric cup holds 250 ml, so 585 ml is just under 2.5 cups. For US recipes, note that a US cup is 240 ml, making 585 ml closer to 2.44 cups. Stir the sauce well before measuring to avoid settling discrepancies.</p>  

<h2>Common Recipes Using 585 ml of Tomato Sauce</h2>  
<p>Many air fryer dishes call for around 585 ml of tomato sauce, such as homemade pizza, pasta bakes, or stuffed peppers. This quantity is ideal for 4-6 servings, making it perfect for family meals. Try our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> for inspiration on using this measurement effectively.</p>  

<p>For example, a classic air fryer spaghetti bake might require 585 ml of sauce to coat the pasta evenly. Similarly, a rich <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/beef>beef lasagna</a> benefits from this precise amount to prevent sogginess. Always adjust seasoning after measuring, as tomato sauce brands vary in saltiness.</p>  

<h3>Adjusting Recipes for Different Cup Sizes</h3>  
<p>If a recipe specifies cups but you’re using millilitres, remember that 1 UK cup = 250 ml, while 1 US cup = 240 ml. For 585 ml of tomato sauce, this small difference means adjusting slightly—2.47 UK cups vs. 2.44 US cups. Keep this in mind when following international recipes.</p>  

<h2>Cleaning Tips After Cooking with Tomato Sauce</h2>  
<p>Tomato sauce can leave stubborn stains in your air fryer basket. To keep it spotless, wipe the basket with warm, soapy water immediately after use. For tougher residue, try our recommended <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner</a> solutions.</p>

faqQ1: "Can I use Greek yogurt instead of plain yogurt for 30g measurements?"

faqQ2: "How many calories are in 30g of plain yogurt?"
faqA2: "Around 18-20 calories, depending on the brand. Low-fat versions may have slightly fewer calories. It’s a light, healthy addition to air fryer recipes."
faqQ3: "Is 30g of plain yogurt the same as 30ml?"
faqA3: "No, grams measure weight, and millilitres measure volume. For yogurt, 30g is roughly 30ml, but this can vary with density. Always weigh for accuracy."
faqQ4: "Can I freeze 30g portions of plain yogurt for later use?"
faqA4: "Yes, but texture may change. Thawed yogurt works best in cooked dishes like marinades or baked goods. Avoid freezing for dips or fresh uses."

faqQ1: "Can I use a cup to measure 500g of molasses instead of a scale?"
faqA1: "While a kitchen scale is the most accurate way to measure 500g of molasses (17.64 oz), you can use a measuring cup in a pinch. One cup of molasses weighs roughly 340g, so 500g would be about 1.5 cups. However, molasses is sticky, so a scale ensures precision."
faqQ2: "Does the type of molasses affect the 500g to ounces conversion?"
faqA2: "No, the conversion remains the same whether you’re using light, dark, or blackstrap molasses. 500g always equals approximately 17.64 ounces. The difference lies in flavour intensity, not weight."
faqQ3: "How should I store leftover molasses after measuring 500g?"
faqA3: "Store molasses in an airtight container in a cool, dark place. It has a long shelf life, but ensure the lid is sealed tightly to prevent drying. If crystallised, warm it gently before use."
faqQ4: "Can I halve a recipe that calls for 500g of molasses?"
faqA4: "Yes, halving 500g of molasses (17.64 oz) would give you 250g or roughly 8.82 ounces. Adjust other ingredients proportionally, and keep an eye on cooking times in your air fryer."

faqQ1: "Is 15g of self-raising flour the same as plain flour in ounces?"
faqA1: "No, 15g of self-raising flour (0.53 oz) includes baking powder, while plain flour doesn’t. Substituting them requires adjusting leavening agents. For air fryer recipes, stick to the specified flour type for best results."
faqQ2: "Can I use cups instead of ounces for 15g of self-raising flour?"
faqA2: "Yes, but cups measure volume, not weight. 15g of self-raising flour is roughly ⅛ cup. For precision, especially in air fryer baking, weight measurements (grams or ounces) are recommended."
faqQ3: "Why does my air fryer bake fail with 15g of self-raising flour?"
faqA3: "Over- or under-measuring 15g (0.53 oz) can affect rise. Also, check your air fryer’s temperature calibration. Uneven heat may require recipe tweaks."
faqQ4: "How do I store self-raising flour after measuring 15g?"
faqA4: "Keep it in an airtight container in a cool, dry place. Moisture can deactivate the baking powder in self-raising flour, impacting future air fryer bakes."

<h2>Why accurate flour measurements matter</h2>  
<p>Baking is a science, and even small discrepancies in flour weight can affect texture and rise. Self-raising flour, which contains baking powder, requires extra precision. Too much or too little can lead to dense or overly airy results. In an air fryer, where heat distribution is rapid, exact measurements ensure even cooking. Visit <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>our recipe hub</a> for foolproof air fryer baking ideas.</p>  

<p>For UK bakers, grams are the standard, but some older recipes or international guides use ounces. Converting 15g of self-raising flour to ounces (0.53 oz) bridges this gap. Digital scales with unit toggling simplify the process, but a quick calculation works too. If you're new to air fryer baking, start with our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>cake recipes</a> to test your measurements.</p>  

<h3>How to measure 15g of self-raising flour without scales</h3>  
<p>No scales? No problem. One tablespoon of self-raising flour weighs roughly 8g, so 15g is just under 2 tablespoons. For better accuracy, spoon the flour into a measuring spoon and level it off. Avoid scooping directly from the bag, as this compacts the flour. This method is handy for quick air fryer bakes like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cookies>cookies</a> or muffins.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for 15g of self-raising flour</h2>  
<p>Small quantities like 15g of self-raising flour are often used in batters, coatings, or as a thickening agent. In air fryer cooking, it’s perfect for dusting fish or chicken before crisping. For example, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>air fryer chicken recipes</a> often call for light flour coatings. It’s also ideal for small-batch bakes, like single-serve cakes or scones.</p>  

<p>When scaling recipes, remember that 15g of self-raising flour to ounces (0.53 oz) is a building block. Doubling or halving requires recalculating to maintain balance. Air fryer baskets have limited space, so smaller portions are common.

<h3>Converting larger quantities of self-raising flour</h3>  
<p>Need 100g or more? Multiply the 15g-to-ounces ratio accordingly. For instance, 100g of self-raising flour equals about 3.53 ounces. This scalability is useful for meal prepping or family-sized air fryer dishes. Always sift flour after measuring to prevent clumping, especially in air fryer recipes where even heat is key.</p>

faqQ1: "Is 500g of soy sauce the same as 500ml?"
faqA1: "No, 500g of soy sauce isn’t the same as 500ml. Weight (grams) measures mass, while millilitres measure volume. Since soy sauce has a density close to water, 500g is roughly 500ml, but thicker or reduced-sodium versions may vary slightly."
faqQ2: "Can I use a measuring cup for 500g of soy sauce?"
faqA2: "A measuring cup can work, but it’s less precise than a scale. Since 500g of soy sauce equals about 17.64 ounces, you’d need just under 2.25 US cups (8 oz per cup). For accuracy, especially in air fryer recipes, a digital scale is best."
faqQ3: "How long does 500g of soy sauce last once opened?"
faqA3: "Opened soy sauce lasts 1–2 years in the fridge. Its high salt content preserves it, but flavour may degrade over time. For best results in air fryer recipes, use it within 6 months."
faqQ4: "What’s the best way to store 500g of soy sauce?"
faqA4: "Keep soy sauce in a cool, dark place before opening. Once opened, refrigerate it to maintain freshness. Transferring it to a glass bottle with a tight seal can also prevent oxidation and flavour loss."

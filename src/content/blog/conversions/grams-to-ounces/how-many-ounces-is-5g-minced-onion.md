faqQ1: "How do I convert 5g of minced onion to ounces without a scale?"
faqA1: "You can estimate 5g of minced onion as roughly 1 teaspoon when packed tightly. However, this isn’t as precise as using a digital scale. For best results in air fryer recipes, consider investing in a kitchen scale for accurate measurements."
faqQ2: "Why is 5g of minced onion a common measurement in recipes?"
faqA2: "5g of minced onion provides enough flavour to enhance dishes without overpowering them. It’s a balanced amount for marinades, seasonings, and toppings, especially in air fryer cooking where ingredients cook quickly and flavours concentrate."
faqQ3: "Can I use dried minced onion instead of fresh for 5g measurements?"
faqA3: "Yes, but dried minced onion is more concentrated. Use about half the amount (2.5g or 0.09 oz) for the same flavour intensity. Rehydrate dried onion with a bit of water before adding it to air fryer recipes for better texture."
faqQ4: "How should I store leftover minced onion after measuring 5g?"
faqA4: "Store leftover minced onion in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 3 days. For longer storage, freeze it in small portions. Always label with the weight (e.g., 5g portions) for easy use in future air fryer recipes."

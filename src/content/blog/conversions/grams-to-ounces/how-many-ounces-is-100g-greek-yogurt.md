faqQ1: "Is 100g of Greek yogurt the same as 100ml?"
faqA1: "No, 100g of Greek yogurt is not the same as 100ml. Greek yogurt is denser than water, so 100g equals roughly 95ml. Always weigh for accuracy, especially in air fryer recipes where texture matters."
faqQ2: "Can I use regular yogurt instead of Greek yogurt in air fryer recipes?"
faqA2: "Yes, but regular yogurt is thinner, so you may need to adjust quantities. For 100g of Greek yogurt (3.53 oz), use about 120g of regular yogurt and strain excess liquid for similar results."
faqQ3: "How many calories are in 100g of Greek yogurt?"
faqA3: "Around 59-100 calories per 100g, depending on fat content. Full-fat versions are richer, while low-fat options are lighter—ideal for air fryer recipes where you control calorie intake."
faqQ4: "Why does my air fryer recipe call for Greek yogurt by weight?"
faqA4: "Weight (grams or ounces) ensures consistency, as yogurt’s thickness varies by brand. Measuring 100g (3.53 oz) guarantees the right texture for coatings, marinades, or baked goods in your air fryer."

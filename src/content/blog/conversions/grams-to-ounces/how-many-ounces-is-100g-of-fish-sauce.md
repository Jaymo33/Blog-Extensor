<p>100g of fish sauce equals approximately 3.53 ounces. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements can make or break a dish. Whether you're marinating chicken or adding depth to a stir-fry, knowing how to convert grams to ounces ensures consistency. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we help simplify these conversions so you can focus on cooking. Let’s dive deeper into why this matters and how to apply it.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of fish sauce can elevate your air fryer dishes from good to great. Too little, and you might miss out on that umami punch; too much, and the dish could become overly salty. Air fryers cook food quickly, so balanced flavours are crucial. For example, a recipe calling for 100g of fish sauce (3.53 ounces) ensures the marinade penetrates evenly.

<p>Fish sauce is a staple in many Asian-inspired air fryer recipes, from glazes to dipping sauces. If you’re working with a UK recipe, you’ll often see measurements in grams, while some prefer ounces. Converting 100g of fish sauce to ounces (3.53 oz) helps avoid guesswork. Precision is key, especially when experimenting with new dishes like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>air fryer chicken recipes</a>.</p>  

<h3>How to measure fish sauce without scales</h3>  
<p>Don’t have a kitchen scale? No problem. A standard tablespoon holds about 15g (0.53 oz) of fish sauce, so 100g would be roughly 6.5 tablespoons. However, for accuracy, we recommend using a measuring jug with fluid ounce markings. This method is especially useful for liquid ingredients like fish sauce.

<h2>Common uses for fish sauce in air fryer recipes</h2>  
<p>Fish sauce adds depth to marinades, dressings, and even crispy snacks. For instance, a 100g (3.53 oz) quantity can be used to marinate shrimp or tofu before air frying. The salty-savoury flavour pairs well with herbs and spices, creating a balanced taste. Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> for inspiration on how to incorporate fish sauce into your meals.</p>  

<p>Another great use is in glazes for meats like pork or chicken. A mix of fish sauce, honey, and garlic can transform a simple dish into something extraordinary. Since air fryers circulate hot air, the glaze caramelises beautifully. Just remember, 100g of fish sauce equals 3.53 ounces, so adjust accordingly.

<h3>Storing fish sauce for longevity</h3>  
<p>Fish sauce has a long shelf life but should be stored in a cool, dark place. Once opened, it can last up to a year if sealed properly. This makes it a convenient pantry staple for frequent air fryer users. Whether you’re using 100g (3.53 oz) or smaller amounts, proper storage ensures the flavour remains intact.</p>

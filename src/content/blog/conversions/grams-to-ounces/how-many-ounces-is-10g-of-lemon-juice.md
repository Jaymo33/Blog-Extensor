faqQ1: "Can I use bottled lemon juice instead of fresh for 10g measurements?"
faqA1: "Yes, bottled lemon juice works, but fresh is preferred for flavour. Bottled juice often contains preservatives, which can alter taste. For 10g (0.35 oz), the volume remains the same, but adjust if the recipe specifies fresh only."
faqQ2: "How does 10g of lemon juice affect cooking times in an air fryer?"
faqA2: "Lemon juice adds moisture, which may slightly extend cooking times. For crispy results, pat proteins dry before air frying. In marinades, 10g won’t drastically change timing but enhances tenderness and flavour."
faqQ3: "Is 10g of lemon juice the same as 10ml?"
faqA3: "Not exactly. While 10g of lemon juice is roughly 10ml, density varies. For precision, weigh it. In recipes, grams (weight) are more reliable than millilitres (volume), especially in air frying."
faqQ4: "What’s the best way to store leftover lemon juice after measuring 10g?"
faqA4: "Store it in an airtight container in the fridge for up to a week. Freezing in ice cube trays (each cube ~10g) lets you grab pre-measured portions for future air fryer recipes."

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on even cooking, and incorrect measurements can throw off textures and flavours.

<p>Many recipes, especially marinades or dressings, list ingredients in grams or ounces. If you're working with a UK recipe, 10g of lemon juice is the standard small quantity.

<h3>How to Measure 10g of Lemon Juice Without a Scale</h3>  
<p>No scale? No problem. One tablespoon of lemon juice weighs roughly 15g, so two-thirds of a tablespoon will give you 10g (0.35 oz). For smaller amounts, a teaspoon holds about 5g, meaning two teaspoons equal 10g. These approximations work well for most <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>air fryer desserts</a> or sauces. Just remember, fresh lemon juice varies slightly in density, so adjust if needed.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for 10g of Lemon Juice in Air Fryer Recipes</h2>

It’s perfect for brightening up <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>air fryer vegetables</a> or balancing rich meats like lamb.

<h3>Converting Larger Quantities of Lemon Juice</h3>  
<p>Need more than 10g? Simply scale up: 100g of lemon juice equals 3.5 ounces, and 50g is 1.75 ounces. These conversions are useful for batch cooking or meal prep.

faqQ1: "Is 250g of Greek yogurt the same as 250ml?"
faqA1: "No, grams measure weight, while millilitres measure volume. Greek yogurt’s thickness means 250g won’t always equal 250ml. For accuracy, weigh it in ounces (8.82 oz) or use a scale."
faqQ2: "Can I use regular yogurt instead of Greek yogurt in air fryer recipes?"
faqA2: "Yes, but Greek yogurt is thicker and higher in protein, which affects texture. If substituting, adjust liquids slightly to match consistency. For best results, stick to 250g (8.82 oz) as listed."
faqQ3: "How do I store leftover Greek yogurt after measuring 250g?"
faqA3: "Seal it tightly and refrigerate for up to a week. For longer storage, freeze portions in 250g (8.82 oz) batches and thaw in the fridge before use."
faqQ4: "Why does my air fryer recipe call for Greek yogurt by weight instead of cups?"
faqA4: "Weight measurements (like 250g or 8.82 oz) are more precise than cups, ensuring consistent results. This is especially important for air fryer cooking, where moisture balance affects crispiness."

<h2>Why Convert 250g of Greek Yogurt to Ounces?</h2>  
<p>Many air fryer recipes, especially those from the UK, use metric measurements like grams. However, some kitchen scales or recipe books might list ingredients in ounces. Converting 250g of Greek yogurt to ounces (8.82 oz) helps avoid guesswork and ensures your dish turns out perfectly. This is particularly useful for recipes like marinades, dressings, or baked goods where precision matters.</p>  
<p>Greek yogurt is a versatile ingredient in air fryer cooking, from creamy sauces to protein-packed snacks. Whether you're following a recipe from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>our collection</a> or adapting one, knowing the exact weight in ounces ensures consistency. Plus, it’s handy for meal prep or portion control if you’re tracking your intake.</p>  

<h2>How to Measure 250g of Greek Yogurt Accurately</h2>  
<p>If your kitchen scale measures in ounces, simply set it to 8.82 oz for 250g of Greek yogurt. No scale? A standard UK tablespoon holds about 0.5 oz (15g), so you’d need roughly 17-18 tablespoons for 250g. However, weighing is far more accurate, especially for air fryer recipes where texture and moisture balance are key.</p>  
<p>For those using cups, 250g of Greek yogurt is roughly 1 cup, but this can vary based on thickness. Thicker yogurts may pack more densely, so a scale is always best.

faqQ1: "Is 20g of peanut butter the same as 20ml?"
faqA1: "No, 20g of peanut butter isn’t the same as 20ml. Grams measure weight, while millilitres measure volume. Due to peanut butter’s thick consistency, 20g equals roughly 19ml—but always weigh it for accuracy in air fryer recipes."
faqQ2: "Can I use tablespoons to measure 20g of peanut butter?"
faqA2: "While possible, tablespoons aren’t precise. One UK tablespoon holds about 15g of peanut butter, so 20g would be roughly 1⅓ tablespoons. For air fryer recipes where texture matters, a kitchen scale guarantees better results."
faqQ3: "Does crunchy peanut butter weigh the same as smooth?"
faqA3: "Crunchy peanut butter is slightly less dense due to air pockets from chopped nuts. However, the difference is minimal—20g of either type will still be close to 0.71 oz. For baking, stick to your recipe’s specified type."
faqQ4: "How should I store leftover peanut butter after measuring?"
faqA4: "Keep opened peanut butter jars upside down in the cupboard to prevent oil separation. If you’ve scooped out 20g, smooth the surface and refrigerate for longer freshness. Avoid cross-contamination by using clean utensils every time."

<p>Air fryers rely on even heat distribution, so ingredient quantities must be spot-on. Too much peanut butter can make dishes greasy, while too little might leave them dry.

<p>Digital kitchen scales are the best way to measure 20g of peanut butter accurately. Scooping it straight from the jar with a spoon can lead to inconsistencies.

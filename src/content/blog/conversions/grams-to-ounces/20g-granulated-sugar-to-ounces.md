faqQ1: "Can I use a US cup to measure 20g of granulated sugar?"
faqA1: "US cups aren’t ideal for measuring 20g of granulated sugar, as they measure volume, not weight. Granulated sugar’s density can vary, so a scale is more accurate. If you must use a cup, 20g is roughly 1/8 cup, but weighing is best for precision."
faqQ2: "Why do UK recipes use grams instead of ounces for sugar?"
faqA2: "The UK uses the metric system, so grams are standard for baking accuracy. Ounces are more common in the US, but grams provide finer measurements, which is crucial for consistent results in air fryer recipes."
faqQ3: "Does brown sugar weigh the same as granulated sugar per 20g?"
faqA3: "Brown sugar is slightly denser due to moisture, so 20g of brown sugar may take up less volume than granulated. However, by weight, 20g of both sugars equals the same in ounces (0.705 oz)."
faqQ4: "How do I clean my air fryer after using sugary recipes?"
faqA4: "Sugary residues can stick, so wipe your air fryer basket with warm, soapy water immediately after use. For stubborn spots, check our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning guide</a> for safe, effective methods."

<p>20g of granulated sugar equals approximately 0.705 ounces. This conversion is essential for precise baking and cooking, especially when using an air fryer where measurements can impact texture and taste. Whether you're making cakes, cookies, or even savoury dishes, knowing how to convert grams to ounces ensures consistency in your recipes.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate sugar measurements matter</h2>  
<p>Granulated sugar plays a crucial role in both texture and sweetness in recipes. Too much or too little can affect browning, moisture, and even cooking times in your air fryer. For example, a <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>cookie recipe</a> with too much sugar might spread too thin, while too little could leave it dense. Measuring 20g of granulated sugar correctly ensures your dishes turn out as intended.</p>  

<p>Many UK recipes use grams, but if your kitchen scales only display ounces, knowing the conversion is a lifesaver. A digital scale with both units is ideal, but if you're in a pinch, 20g granulated sugar to ounces is roughly 0.705 oz. Keep this in mind when following recipes from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> or other sources.</p>  

<h2>How to measure 20g of granulated sugar without scales</h2>  
<p>If you don’t have a scale, you can still measure 20g of granulated sugar using tablespoons. One level tablespoon holds about 12.5g of granulated sugar, so 20g is roughly 1.6 tablespoons. However, this method isn’t as precise as weighing, so for best results, invest in a digital scale.</p>

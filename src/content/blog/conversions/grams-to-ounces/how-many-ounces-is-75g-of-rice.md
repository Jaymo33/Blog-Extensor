faqQ1: "Can I use a cup to measure 75g of rice instead of a scale?"
faqA1: "Yes, but it’s less precise. A standard cup holds about 180g of uncooked rice, so 75g is roughly a third of a cup. For accuracy, especially in air fryer recipes, a digital scale is best."
faqQ2: "How much water should I use for 75g of rice in the air fryer?"
faqA2: "Use a 1:1.5 ratio—75g of rice needs about 112ml of water. Adjust slightly for rice types like brown rice, which may require more water. Always check for doneness before serving."
faqQ3: "Does 75g of rice expand when cooked in an air fryer?"
faqA3: "Yes, 75g of uncooked rice yields about 225g cooked, tripling in volume. This makes it ideal for 1-2 portions. Stir halfway through cooking for even results."
faqQ4: "Can I cook other grains like quinoa using the 75g to ounces conversion?"
faqA4: "Absolutely! 75g of quinoa is also 2.65 ounces. Adjust cooking times and liquid ratios as needed—quinoa cooks faster than rice in an air fryer. Check our recipes for guidance."

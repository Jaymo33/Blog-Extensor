faqQ1: "Can I use a measuring cup instead of a scale for 25g of soy milk?"
faqA1: "While a measuring cup can work in a pinch, it’s less accurate than a scale. 25g of soy milk is roughly 1.5 tablespoons, but density can vary. For best results in air fryer recipes, use a digital scale."
faqQ2: "Does the type of soy milk affect the conversion from grams to ounces?"
faqA2: "No, the conversion remains the same regardless of whether you use sweetened, unsweetened, or flavoured soy milk. 25g will always equal approximately 0.88 ounces. However, thicker varieties may measure slightly differently by volume."
faqQ3: "Why do some air fryer recipes use grams instead of ounces?"
faqA3: "Grams are the standard metric unit in the UK and many other countries, offering more precision for baking. Ounces are more common in older or US-based recipes. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> uses grams for consistency."
faqQ4: "How do I convert 25g of soy milk to cups?"
faqA4: "25g of soy milk is about 1.5 tablespoons or roughly 1/8 cup. For precise air fryer recipes, we recommend sticking to weight measurements for the best results. Check our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a> for more details."

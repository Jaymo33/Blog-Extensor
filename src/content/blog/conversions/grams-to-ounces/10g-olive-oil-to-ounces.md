<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air frying</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on hot air circulation to cook food evenly, and too much or too little oil can affect texture and crispiness. Using 10g of olive oil (0.35 ounces) is ideal for light coatings, like roasting vegetables or preparing lean proteins. Over-oiling can lead to soggy results, while under-oiling might leave food dry. For perfectly crispy dishes, measure carefully and explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> for inspiration.</p>  

<p>Olive oil is a popular choice for air frying due to its high smoke point and health benefits. However, other oils like avocado or coconut can also be used—just ensure you convert grams to ounces accurately. A kitchen scale is the best tool for this, but if you don’t have one, remember that 10g equals roughly 0.35 ounces. Need cleaning tips for your air fryer after cooking?

<h3>How to measure 10g of olive oil without a scale</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a digital scale, you can use a measuring spoon to estimate 10g of olive oil. One tablespoon of olive oil weighs about 14g, so 10g is just under three-quarters of a tablespoon. For smaller quantities, a teaspoon holds roughly 5g, meaning 10g would be two level teaspoons. This method isn’t as precise as weighing, but it works in a pinch for recipes like those in our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable air fryer collection</a>.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for 10g of olive oil in air frying</h2>  
<p>From crispy potatoes to golden chicken wings, 10g of olive oil (0.35 ounces) is the perfect amount for light, even coating. It’s enough to enhance flavour and texture without making food greasy. Try it with roasted Brussels sprouts or as a base for homemade air fryer garlic bread.

<p>Another great use for 10g of olive oil is marinating proteins like chicken or tofu. The oil helps spices adhere while keeping meat moist during cooking. Just mix 10g of oil with your favourite herbs and let the flavours infuse before air frying. Remember, precise measurements ensure consistent results, so always double-check your conversions.</p>

faqQ1: "Is 125g of lemon juice the same as 125ml?"
faqA1: "No, 125g of lemon juice is not the same as 125ml. Grams measure weight, while millilitres measure volume. The density of lemon juice means 125g is roughly 120ml, but this can vary slightly depending on freshness and temperature."
faqQ2: "Can I use bottled lemon juice instead of fresh for air fryer recipes?"

faqQ3: "How do I store leftover lemon juice after measuring 125g?"
faqA3: "Store leftover lemon juice in an airtight container in the fridge for up to a week. You can also freeze it in ice cube trays for longer storage. This way, you’ll always have the right amount (like 125g) ready for your next air fryer recipe."

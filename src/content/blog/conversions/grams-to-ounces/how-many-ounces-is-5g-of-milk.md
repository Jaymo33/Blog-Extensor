faqQ1: "Is 5g of milk the same as 5ml?"
faqA1: "No, 5 grams of milk is not exactly the same as 5 millilitres. While they’re close, milk’s density means 5ml weighs roughly 5.1 grams. For precise air fryer recipes, use weight (grams) rather than volume (millilitres)."
faqQ2: "Can I use plant-based milk instead of cow’s milk for 5g measurements?"
faqA2: "Yes, plant-based milks like almond or oat milk can substitute cow’s milk in a 5g measurement. The weight difference is minimal, so 5 grams will still be approximately 0.18 ounces. Adjust for taste preferences in your air fryer recipes."
faqQ3: "Why do some air fryer recipes use grams instead of ounces?"
faqA3: "Grams offer greater precision, especially for small quantities like 5g of milk. Most modern kitchen scales and UK recipes use metric measurements. Converting to ounces (0.18 oz) ensures compatibility with older tools or non-metric recipes."
faqQ4: "How do I measure 5g of milk without a scale?"
faqA4: "Use a teaspoon—one level teaspoon of milk is roughly 5 grams (0.18 oz). For better accuracy, consider investing in a digital scale, especially if you frequently cook with your air fryer. Small measuring spoons also work well for tiny amounts."

<h2>Why Convert 5g of Milk to Ounces?</h2>

<h3>How to Measure 5g of Milk Without a Scale</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a digital scale, you can use a measuring spoon. One teaspoon of milk weighs roughly 5 grams (0.18 oz). This method isn’t as precise as a scale but works in a pinch. For best results, level off the spoon to avoid excess liquid.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for 5g of Milk in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Small amounts of milk, like 5 grams, are often used in glazes, batters, or light coatings. For example, a thin milk wash brushed on air-fried pastries gives them a golden finish. You’ll find this technique in many <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert recipes</a>.</p>  

<p>Another popular use is in creamy dips or sauces. A splash of milk (5g or 0.18 oz) can balance the consistency without overpowering other flavours. Pair it with air-fried chicken or vegetables for a delicious meal. Discover more ideas in our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipes</a> section.</p>  

<h3>Does Milk Weight Vary by Type?</h3>  
<p>Whole milk, skimmed milk, and plant-based alternatives have slightly different densities, but the difference is negligible for small amounts like 5 grams. Whether you’re using cow’s milk or almond milk, 5g will still be close to 0.18 ounces.</p>  

<h2>Tips for Measuring Small Quantities in Your Air Fryer</h2>  
<p>Invest in a digital kitchen scale for the most accurate measurements. Scales that switch between grams and ounces are ideal for air fryer cooking. Keep your air fryer clean and well-maintained for consistent results—try our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning guide</a> for tips.</p>  

<p>For liquids like milk, use a small measuring jug with metric and imperial markings. This eliminates the need for conversions and reduces mess. Precision ensures your air fryer dishes turn out perfectly every time.</p>  

<h3>Converting Other Dairy Measurements</h3>  
<p>If your recipe calls for larger amounts, remember that 100 grams of milk equals about 3.53 ounces. This ratio helps scale recipes up or down. Always double-check conversions to avoid errors in your air fryer cooking.</p>

faqQ1: "Is 25g of honey the same as 25ml?"
faqA1: "No, 25g of honey is not the same as 25ml. Honey is denser than water, so 25g equals roughly 17.5ml. Weight (grams) is more accurate for honey due to its varying viscosity."
faqQ2: "Can I use 25g of honey in savoury air fryer dishes?"
faqA2: "Absolutely! 25g of honey (0.88 oz) balances flavours in savoury dishes like glazed meats or roasted veggies. Its sweetness pairs well with spices, soy sauce, or mustard in marinades."
faqQ3: "How do I convert 25g of honey to cups?"
faqA3: "25g of honey is about 1.5 tablespoons or roughly 1/8 cup. For precise baking, though, weighing with a scale is best, as honey’s thickness affects volume measurements."
faqQ4: "Does the type of honey affect the 25g to ounces conversion?"
faqA4: "The conversion (25g = 0.88 oz) applies to all honey types, but thicker varieties may pack slightly more weight per volume. For accuracy, always measure by weight."

<h2>How to Measure 25g of Honey Accurately</h2>  
<h3>Using a Digital Scale</h3>

While not as precise as weighing, this method works in a pinch for marinades or dressings.

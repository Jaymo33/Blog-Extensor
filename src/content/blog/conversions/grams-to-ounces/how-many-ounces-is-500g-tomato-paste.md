faqQ1: "Can I use 500g of tomato paste straight from the tin in my air fryer?"
faqA1: "Yes, but it’s best to dilute or mix it with other ingredients. Tomato paste is highly concentrated, so using it undiluted can make dishes overly intense. For balanced flavour, blend it with water, broth, or oil before adding to your air fryer recipes."
faqQ2: "How long does 500g of tomato paste last once opened?"
faqA2: "Opened tomato paste lasts about 5-7 days in the fridge if stored properly. For longer storage, freeze it in portions. This way, you can thaw only what you need for recipes like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/beef>air fryer beef stew</a>."
faqQ3: "Is 500g of tomato paste the same as tomato purée?"
faqA3: "No, tomato paste is thicker and more concentrated than purée. While both are tomato-based, paste has less water content, so substitutions require adjustments. Always check your recipe for the correct ingredient."
faqQ4: "What’s the best way to measure 500g of tomato paste for air fryer recipes?"
faqA4: "A kitchen scale is the most accurate method. If unavailable, use tablespoons (about 33 for 500g), though scales are preferred for consistency. For more tips, visit our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion guide</a>."

<p>500g of tomato paste equals approximately 17.64 ounces. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes, where precise measurements ensure the best texture and flavour. Whether you’re making a rich pasta sauce or a hearty stew, knowing how to convert grams to ounces can make all the difference. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we help you nail every recipe with accurate conversions and expert tips.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of tomato paste ensures your dishes aren’t too acidic or bland. Air fryers cook food quickly, so imbalances in ingredients can be more noticeable. For example, adding too much tomato paste might overpower other flavours in a dish like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer chicken casserole</a>. On the other hand, too little could leave your meal tasting flat. Measuring 500g of tomato paste correctly (17.64 oz) guarantees consistency.</p>  

<p>Tomato paste is a concentrated ingredient, so even small deviations can affect your recipe. If you’re scaling up or down, check our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for other common measurements. This is especially useful for batch cooking or meal prepping, where precision saves time and reduces waste.</p>  

<h3>How to measure 500g of tomato paste without scales</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a kitchen scale, you can still measure 500g of tomato paste using volume. One tablespoon of tomato paste weighs roughly 15g, so 500g would be about 33 tablespoons. However, this method isn’t as precise as weighing, so for best results, invest in a digital scale. Many affordable options are perfect for home cooks and fit neatly in your kitchen.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for 500g of tomato paste in air fryer recipes</h2>  
<p>Tomato paste adds depth to many air fryer dishes, from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>roasted vegetables</a> to meaty mains. A 500g batch is ideal for making large portions of sauces, stews, or marinades. For instance, you could whip up a big batch of bolognese or a rich tomato-based curry. The concentrated flavour means a little goes a long way, so 500g can last through multiple meals.</p>  

<p>Another great use is for homemade pizza sauce. Mix 500g of tomato paste with herbs, garlic, and a splash of water for a quick, delicious base. Spread it on your dough before air frying for a crispy, flavourful crust. For more inspiration, browse our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> collection.</p>  

<h3>Storing leftover tomato paste</h3>  
<p>Once opened, tomato paste can spoil quickly. To preserve freshness, transfer unused portions into an airtight container or freeze in ice cube trays. This way, you’ll always have pre-measured amounts ready for your next air fryer creation. Proper storage ensures you get the most out of your 500g without waste.</p>

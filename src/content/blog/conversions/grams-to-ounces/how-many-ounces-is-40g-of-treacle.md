faqQ1: "Can I use golden syrup instead of treacle in my air fryer recipes?"
faqA1: "Yes, you can substitute golden syrup for treacle, but the flavour will be lighter and less robust. Golden syrup is sweeter and less bitter than treacle, so adjust other sweeteners in your recipe accordingly. For sticky glazes or bakes, the swap works well in air fryer cooking."
faqQ2: "Why does my treacle measurement seem off when converting grams to ounces?"
faqA2: "Treacle’s thick consistency can make it tricky to measure accurately. Always use level measurements for conversions—packed or heaped spoonfuls will give you more than 40g. If precision is crucial, invest in a digital kitchen scale for the most reliable results."
faqQ3: "How should I store leftover treacle after measuring 40g?"
faqA3: "Keep treacle in an airtight container at room temperature, away from direct sunlight. To prevent crystallisation, wipe the rim of the jar clean before sealing. Properly stored, treacle lasts for months, ready for your next air fryer recipe."
faqQ4: "Does treacle behave differently in an air fryer compared to a regular oven?"
faqA4: "Yes, treacle can caramelise faster in an air fryer due to the concentrated heat circulation. Reduce cooking times slightly and check dishes frequently to prevent burning. Thin layers work best for even browning and flavour distribution."

faqQ1: "Why is 20g of coconut oil a common measurement in air fryer recipes?"
faqA1: "20g (0.71 ounces) of coconut oil is a popular measurement because it's typically enough to coat ingredients without making them greasy. Air fryers require less oil than traditional frying, and this amount provides perfect crispness for most single-serving recipes."
faqQ2: "Can I use volume measurements instead of weight for coconut oil?"
faqA2: "While you can use tablespoons (about 1⅓ tbsp for 20g), weight measurements are more accurate. Coconut oil's density changes with temperature, so 20g (0.71 oz) by weight ensures consistency regardless of whether it's solid or melted."
faqQ3: "Does the type of coconut oil affect the 20g to ounce conversion?"
faqA3: "No, the conversion remains the same whether using refined or unrefined coconut oil. 20g always equals 0.71 ounces. However, unrefined coconut oil may have a stronger flavour that affects your air fryer recipes differently."
faqQ4: "How do I measure 20g of coconut oil if I don't have metric scales?"
faqA4: "If your scales only show ounces, look for 0.71 oz which equals 20g. Alternatively, use the displacement method: 20g of coconut oil will displace 20ml of water in a measuring jug, as its density is very close to 1g/ml."

<p>20g of coconut oil equals approximately 0.71 ounces. This conversion is essential for air fryer cooking where precise measurements can make all the difference to your recipes. Whether you're making crispy roast potatoes or delicious air-fried chicken, knowing exactly how much coconut oil to use ensures perfect results every time.</p>

<h2>Understanding coconut oil measurements</h2>
<p>When working with coconut oil in air fryer recipes, accurate measurements are crucial. Many UK recipes use grams while some appliances or older cookbooks reference ounces. The conversion rate for coconut oil is the same as other ingredients - 1 gram equals 0.035 ounces. This means 20g converts to 0.71 ounces, a measurement that's particularly useful when following <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> precisely.</p>
<p>Coconut oil's unique texture can make measuring tricky. In its solid state, it's best weighed rather than measured by volume. If your kitchen scales only show ounces, you'll now know that 20g is just under three-quarters of an ounce. This knowledge helps when adapting recipes from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken dishes</a> to vegetable roasts in your air fryer.</p>

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air frying</h2>
<p>Air fryers circulate hot air to cook food, meaning oil quantities need to be precise. Too much coconut oil can make food greasy, while too little might leave it dry. The 20g to 0.71 ounce conversion helps achieve that perfect balance. This is especially important when preparing <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/potatoes>roast potatoes</a> or other dishes where coconut oil adds flavour and crispness.</p>
<p>Most air fryer baskets have non-stick coatings, so you typically need less oil than traditional frying methods. The 20g measurement (0.71 ounces) is often ideal for coating vegetables or meat before air frying.

<h3>Measuring coconut oil without scales</h3>
<p>If you don't have digital scales, you can estimate 20g of coconut oil (0.71 ounces) by volume. One tablespoon of solid coconut oil weighs about 15g, so 20g would be roughly 1⅓ tablespoons. However, weighing is always more accurate, especially for air fryer cooking where precision affects texture and cooking time.</p>

<h2>Converting other coconut oil quantities</h2>
<p>Once you've mastered the 20g to 0.71 ounce conversion, you can apply the same principles to other amounts. Simply multiply grams by 0.035 to get ounces. For example, 50g would be 1.76 ounces, while 100g converts to 3.53 ounces. These conversions are handy when scaling up <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert recipes</a> or meal prepping in your air fryer.</p>
<p>Remember that coconut oil's state (solid or liquid) affects its volume but not its weight. Whether you're melting it for a marinade or using it solid for coating, 20g will always equal 0.71 ounces. This consistency makes it ideal for air fryer cooking where you might use it in various forms across different recipes.</p>

<h3>Storing and handling coconut oil</h3>
<p>To ensure your 20g measurements remain accurate, store coconut oil properly. Keep it in a cool, dark place to maintain consistency. If your oil separates, gently warm and stir it before measuring. Clean your air fryer regularly with <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>proper cleaning methods</a> to prevent coconut oil residue build-up that could affect cooking performance.</p>

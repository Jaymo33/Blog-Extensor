<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air frying</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on precise cooking times and ingredient quantities to deliver perfect results. Using too much or too little Nutella can affect texture and flavour. For example, 40g of Nutella (1.41 ounces) is ideal for filling four small pastries or coating a batch of air-fried fruit. Consistency is key, especially when following recipes from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>.</p>  

<p>Digital kitchen scales are the best tool for measuring 40g of Nutella accurately. If you don’t have one, tablespoons can work in a pinch—roughly 2.5 tablespoons equal 40g. However, for baking or recipes requiring precision, weighing is always recommended.

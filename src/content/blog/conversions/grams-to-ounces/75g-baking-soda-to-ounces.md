faqQ1: "Can I use volume measurements (cups) instead of weight for 75g of baking soda?"
faqA1: "While possible, weight measurements (grams or ounces) are far more accurate for baking soda. A standard UK cup holds about 220g of baking soda, but density varies. For air fryer recipes, always weigh 75g (2.65 oz) for best results."
faqQ2: "Why does my air fryer recipe call for 75g of baking soda?"
faqA2: "Baking soda acts as a leavening agent, helping batters rise. In air fryers, precise amounts ensure even cooking. Too much can leave a bitter taste, while too little results in dense textures. Stick to 75g (2.65 oz) for balanced recipes."
faqQ3: "How do I convert 75g of baking soda to ounces without a scale?"
faqA3: "Use measuring spoons: 75g equals roughly 15 teaspoons. However, this method isn’t ideal for air fryer recipes, as packing density affects volume. Invest in a cheap digital scale for accuracy."
faqQ4: "Is 75g of baking soda the same in US and UK ounces?"
faqA4: "Yes, 75g converts to 2.65 ounces in both systems. The UK uses metric grams more often, but the ounce measurement remains consistent. Double-check recipes on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> for region-specific tips."

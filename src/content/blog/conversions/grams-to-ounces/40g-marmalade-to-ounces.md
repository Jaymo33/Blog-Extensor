faqQ1: "Can I use a measuring cup instead of a scale for 40g of marmalade?"
faqA1: "While a scale is best, you can use a measuring cup in a pinch. Two level tablespoons roughly equal 40g (1.41 oz) of marmalade. Stir it first for consistency, and avoid packing it down to keep the measurement accurate."
faqQ2: "Does the type of marmalade affect the 40g to ounces conversion?"
faqA2: "No, the conversion remains the same (40g = 1.41 oz) regardless of marmalade type. However, thicker marmalades may be harder to measure precisely without a scale. Chunky varieties might need stirring to distribute peel evenly."
faqQ3: "How can I use 40g of marmalade in my air fryer?"
faqA3: "40g of marmalade is perfect for glazing meats, brushing on pastries, or mixing into batters. Try it in air fryer cakes, sticky chicken wings, or as a topping for baked brie. Check our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipes</a> for ideas."
faqQ4: "Why is my 40g marmalade measurement not matching the recipe’s outcome?"
faqA4: "This could be due to uneven measuring or marmalade thickness. Always use a scale for accuracy, and stir well before measuring. If the recipe seems off, adjust other ingredients slightly or revisit our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion guide</a>."

faqQ1: "Can I use minced garlic instead of crushed garlic for the same weight?"
faqA1: "Yes, minced garlic can be substituted for crushed garlic at the same weight (250g or 8.82 oz). The texture is slightly finer, but the flavour intensity remains similar. Adjust cooking times slightly if needed, as minced garlic may cook faster in the air fryer."
faqQ2: "How long does 250g of crushed garlic last in the fridge?"
faqA2: "Freshly crushed garlic lasts about 5–7 days in the fridge when stored in an airtight container. For longer storage, freeze it in portions. Frozen garlic retains its flavour for up to 3 months and can be used directly in air fryer recipes."
faqQ3: "Does 250g of crushed garlic equal 250g of whole garlic cloves?"
faqA3: "No, 250g of whole garlic cloves will yield less crushed garlic due to the removal of skins. Typically, 250g of whole cloves gives about 200g of crushed garlic. Always measure crushed garlic by weight for accuracy in recipes."
faqQ4: "Can I reduce the amount of garlic in a recipe if 250g seems too strong?"
faqA4: "Absolutely! Start with half the amount (125g or 4.41 oz) and adjust to taste. Garlic’s potency varies, so tailor it to your preference. For milder flavour, roast the garlic in the air fryer first to soften its sharpness."

<p>250g of crushed garlic equals approximately 8.82 ounces. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements can make or break a dish. Whether you're whipping up garlic-infused chicken or roasted vegetables, knowing the exact weight ensures consistent results. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we understand the importance of accuracy, especially when working with bold flavours like garlic.</p>

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on even cooking, and incorrect ingredient quantities can throw off texture and taste. Too much garlic might overpower a dish, while too little could leave it bland. For example, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>garlic butter shrimp recipe</a> calls for precise amounts to balance flavours perfectly. Converting 250g of crushed garlic to ounces (8.82 oz) helps you follow recipes without guesswork.</p>  
<p>Garlic’s density can vary slightly depending on how finely it’s crushed, but 250g consistently translates to roughly 8.82 ounces. This makes scaling recipes up or down a breeze. If you’re prepping multiple batches, check our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for other common ingredient conversions.</p>  

<h3>How to measure crushed garlic for air fryer recipes</h3>  
<p>For best results, use a kitchen scale to weigh your garlic. If you don’t have one, remember that 1 tablespoon of crushed garlic weighs about 10g, so 250g would be around 25 tablespoons. However, scales are far more reliable, especially for recipes like our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>garlic Parmesan chicken</a>, where precision is key.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for 250g of crushed garlic in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>This quantity of garlic is perfect for marinades, sauces, or seasoning large batches of food. Try it in garlic bread, roasted potatoes, or even as a base for homemade aioli. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>garlic-roasted vegetables</a> are a crowd-pleaser, and 250g of crushed garlic ensures robust flavour throughout.</p>  
<p>If you’re meal prepping, divide the 250g (8.82 oz) into portions and freeze them for later use. Garlic retains its flavour well when frozen, making it a time-saver for busy cooks. Just thaw and add to your air fryer dishes as needed.</p>  

<h3>Tips for handling and storing crushed garlic</h3>  
<p>To keep your garlic fresh, store it in an airtight container in the fridge for up to a week. For longer storage, freeze it in ice cube trays. After handling garlic, clean your air fryer basket with our recommended <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner</a> to prevent lingering odours.</p>

faqQ1: "Can I use honey instead of golden syrup in an air fryer recipe?"
faqA1: "Yes, you can substitute honey for golden syrup, but the flavour and texture will differ slightly. Honey is sweeter and less viscous, so you may need to adjust the quantity. For 150g of golden syrup (5.29 oz), use about 140g of honey to maintain balance."
faqQ2: "How do I store leftover golden syrup?"
faqA2: "Store golden syrup in an airtight container at room temperature. It has a long shelf life due to its high sugar content, but keep it away from direct sunlight to prevent crystallisation. A properly stored jar can last up to two years."
faqQ3: "Why does my air fryer recipe with golden syrup burn?"
faqA3: "Golden syrup has a high sugar content, which can caramelise quickly in an air fryer’s intense heat. To prevent burning, reduce the cooking temperature by 10°C or brush on the syrup halfway through cooking. Always monitor closely."
faqQ4: "Is golden syrup the same as corn syrup?"
faqA4: "No, golden syrup and corn syrup have different flavours and consistencies. Golden syrup has a buttery, caramel taste, while corn syrup is milder. For UK recipes, stick to golden syrup for authentic results, especially when converting 150g to ounces."

<p>150g of golden syrup equals approximately 5.29 ounces. This conversion is essential for anyone using British recipes or working with an air fryer, where precise measurements can make or break a dish. Whether you’re whipping up a sticky pudding or glazing roasted vegetables, knowing how to convert grams to ounces ensures consistency in your cooking.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on precise ingredient ratios to deliver perfectly cooked meals. Too much or too little golden syrup can alter the texture and taste of your dish. For example, a sticky toffee pudding made in an air fryer requires exact measurements to achieve that gooey, caramelised perfection. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we emphasise the importance of accurate conversions for foolproof results.</p>  

<p>Golden syrup is a staple in many British desserts, and its thick, viscous nature means even small measurement errors can be noticeable. If you’re adapting a traditional recipe for your air fryer, converting 150g of golden syrup to ounces (5.29 oz) ensures you stay true to the original flavour and texture. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more handy tips.</p>  

<h3>How to measure golden syrup without scales</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a kitchen scale, you can still measure 150g of golden syrup using volume. One tablespoon of golden syrup weighs roughly 20g, so 7.5 tablespoons will give you close to 150g. However, for baking or air fryer recipes, we recommend using a scale for precision. A slight variation can affect the outcome, especially in delicate dishes like cakes or glazes.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for golden syrup in air fryer recipes</h2>  
<p>Golden syrup adds a rich, caramel-like sweetness to both sweet and savoury dishes. In an air fryer, it’s perfect for glazing meats, creating sticky marinades, or drizzling over desserts. For instance, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> section features a delicious sticky ginger cake that uses 150g of golden syrup for the perfect balance of sweetness and spice.</p>  

<p>Another popular use is in flapjacks or granola bars, where golden syrup acts as a binding agent. Since air fryers cook food quickly and evenly, these treats come out crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside. Just remember, 150g of golden syrup translates to 5.29 ounces, so measure carefully to avoid overly dense or crumbly results.</p>  

<h3>Converting other golden syrup quantities</h3>  
<p>Need to convert a different amount? Here’s a quick reference: 100g of golden syrup is about 3.53 ounces, while 200g equals roughly 7.05 ounces. These conversions are handy if you’re scaling recipes up or down for your air fryer.

<h2>Tips for working with golden syrup in an air fryer</h2>  
<p>Golden syrup can be messy, so lightly greasing your measuring spoon or cup helps it slide off easily. When using it in air fryer recipes, mix it thoroughly with other ingredients to ensure even distribution. For sticky glazes, brush a thin layer to prevent burning—air fryers circulate hot air, which can caramelise sugars quickly.</p>  

<p>Cleaning up after using golden syrup is simple with our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner</a> guide. A quick wipe with warm, soapy water usually does the trick, but for stubborn residue, a baking soda paste works wonders. Remember, precise measurements like 150g (5.29 oz) of golden syrup not only improve your cooking but also make cleanup easier.</p>

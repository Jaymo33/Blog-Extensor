faqQ1: "Can I use a tablespoon to measure 20g of hot sauce?"
faqA1: "A tablespoon holds roughly 15g of thick hot sauce, so you’d need about 1 and 1/3 tablespoons for 20g. For thinner sauces, it might be closer to 20g per tablespoon. A kitchen scale is best for precision."
faqQ2: "How does hot sauce affect cooking times in an air fryer?"
faqA2: "Hot sauce can caramelise quickly in an air fryer, so watch for burning. Reduce the temperature slightly or shorten cooking time by a minute or two if the sauce contains sugar."
faqQ3: "Is 20g of hot sauce very spicy?"
faqA3: "It depends on the sauce’s Scoville rating. Mild sauces like Frank’s RedHot won’t overwhelm, while habanero-based ones will pack heat. Start with less and adjust to taste."
faqQ4: "Can I substitute hot sauce powder for liquid hot sauce?"
faqA4: "Yes, but use about 1/4 teaspoon of powder per 20g of liquid sauce. Rehydrate it with water or oil, and adjust for spice level since powders can be more concentrated."

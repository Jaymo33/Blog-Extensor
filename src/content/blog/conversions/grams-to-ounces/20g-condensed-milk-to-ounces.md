faqQ1: "Can I use fluid ounces to measure 20g of condensed milk?"
faqA1: "No, fluid ounces measure volume while grams measure weight. Condensed milk’s thickness means 20g won’t equal 20ml. Always use weight measurements (grams or ounces) for accuracy in air fryer recipes."
faqQ2: "Why does my air fryer recipe specify grams instead of ounces?"
faqA2: "Most UK recipes use grams as it’s the standard metric measurement. Grams provide precision, especially for small quantities like 20g of condensed milk. Air fryer cooking benefits from this accuracy for consistent results."
faqQ3: "How can I measure 20g of condensed milk without scales?"
faqA3: "Two level teaspoons approximate 20g, but this isn’t precise. For better accuracy, use tablespoon markings – 1 UK tablespoon equals about 25g, so use slightly less. Investing in cheap digital scales guarantees perfect measurements every time."
faqQ4: "Does condensed milk weight change between brands?"
faqA4: "Different brands may have slight density variations, but 20g will always be approximately 0.71 ounces. The difference is negligible for most air fryer recipes. Stick to one brand for consistent results in your favourite dishes."

<p>20g of condensed milk equals approximately 0.71 ounces. This conversion is handy for air fryer recipes where precise measurements matter. Whether you’re baking a cake or making a glaze, knowing the exact weight ensures perfect results every time.</p>

<h2>Why Convert Grams to Ounces for Condensed Milk?</h2>
<p>Many UK air fryer recipes use grams, but some cooks prefer ounces for smaller quantities. Condensed milk is thick and sticky, making it tricky to measure by volume. Weight measurements like grams or ounces are far more accurate, especially for sticky ingredients.</p>
<p>If you’re using an air fryer for desserts, precise measurements prevent over-sweetening or dryness. A slight variation in condensed milk can affect texture, so conversions matter.

<h2>How to Measure 20g of Condensed Milk Accurately</h2>
<p>Use a digital kitchen scale for the most precise measurement. Place your mixing bowl on the scale, tare it to zero, then add condensed milk until it hits 20g. If you don’t have scales, two level teaspoons roughly equal 20g, but this isn’t as accurate.</p>
<p>For sticky ingredients like condensed milk, lightly grease your spoon or scoop first. This helps the milk slide off easily without waste. Explore more <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> where precise measurements make all the difference.</p>

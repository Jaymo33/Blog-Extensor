faqQ1: "Can I use dried minced onion instead of fresh for 30g measurements?"
faqA1: "Yes, you can substitute dried minced onion for fresh. Use about one-third the amount, as dried onion is more concentrated. For 30g of fresh minced onion, you’d need roughly 10g (or 0.35 ounces) of dried. Just rehydrate it with a bit of water before adding to your recipe."
faqQ2: "How does 30g of minced onion compare to one small onion?"
faqA2: "One small onion typically yields about 50-60g of minced onion, so 30g is roughly half a small onion. If your recipe calls for 30g (1.06 ounces), it’s best to measure it precisely rather than eyeballing half an onion, as sizes can vary."
faqQ3: "Does 30g of minced onion change weight when cooked in an air fryer?"
faqA3: "Yes, minced onion loses moisture when cooked, so 30g raw will weigh less after air frying. The exact reduction depends on cooking time and temperature, but expect about a 20-30% weight loss. For precise recipes, measure pre-cooked weight unless specified otherwise."
faqQ4: "Are there any air fryer recipes where 30g of minced onion is commonly used?"
faqA4: "Absolutely! 30g of minced onion is perfect for air fryer meatballs, stuffed mushrooms, or savoury muffins. It’s also a great amount for flavouring breadcrumbs or coatings. Check our recipe section for dishes that use this measurement."

faqQ1: "Can I use cups to measure 200g of baking powder?"
faqA1: "While possible, cups aren’t ideal for measuring baking powder by weight. 200g is roughly 0.85 cups, but density varies. A kitchen scale is far more accurate for consistent results in air fryer baking."
faqQ2: "Does baking powder expire, and how does it affect measurements?"
faqA2: "Yes, baking powder loses potency over time. Expired powder may not lift your batter properly, even if you measure 200g (7.05 oz) correctly. Always check the expiry date for best results."
faqQ3: "Why do some recipes use grams and others use ounces?"
faqA3: "Grams are standard in the UK and Europe, while ounces are more common in the US. At airfryerrecipe.co.uk, we provide both to make following recipes easier, no matter where they originate."
faqQ4: "Can I reduce baking powder in air fryer recipes for a denser texture?"
faqA4: "Yes, but adjust carefully. Reducing 200g (7.05 oz) significantly may lead to overly dense results. For slight adjustments, decrease by 10-15% and test in small batches first."

<p>200g of baking powder equals approximately 7.05 ounces. Whether you're whipping up cakes, bread, or other air fryer delights, getting the measurements right is crucial. Baking powder is a key leavening agent, and even small deviations can affect your recipe's outcome. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we help you nail every measurement for flawless results.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate conversions matter in air fryer baking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers cook food faster and more evenly than traditional ovens, so precision is key. Using the right amount of baking powder ensures your cakes rise perfectly and your batters aren’t too dense. A slight miscalculation could lead to flat or overly airy textures. That’s why knowing how to convert 200g of baking powder to ounces (7.05 oz) is so helpful.</p>  

<p>Many UK recipes use grams, while some older cookbooks or international sources list ounces. If you’re following a recipe from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>our collection</a>, you’ll often find both measurements. But when in doubt, a digital kitchen scale is your best friend for accuracy.</p>  

<h2>How to measure 200g of baking powder without a scale</h2>  
<p>If you don’t have a scale, you can still measure 200g of baking powder using volume. One teaspoon holds about 4g, so 200g would be roughly 50 teaspoons. However, this method is less precise due to settling and scooping differences. For best results, we recommend investing in a digital scale.</p>  

<h3>Common baking powder substitutions</h3>  
<p>If you run out of baking powder, you can make a substitute using baking soda and cream of tartar. For every 200g (7.05 oz) of baking powder, use 70g baking soda and 130g cream of tartar.

<h2>How to Measure 15g of Apple Cider Vinegar Accurately</h2>  
<p>Using a digital kitchen scale is the most accurate way to measure 15g of apple cider vinegar. Simply place your container on the scale, tare it to zero, and pour until you hit 15g. If your scale displays ounces, it should read 0.53 oz. For those without a scale, 15g is roughly one tablespoon, but this can vary slightly depending on the vinegar's density.</p>

faqQ1: "Can I use butter instead of margarine for 5g measurements?"
faqA1: "Yes, butter can be substituted for margarine in equal weights (5g butter = 5g margarine). However, butter has a slightly higher fat content, which may affect browning. Adjust cooking times slightly if needed."
faqQ2: "How do I measure 5g of margarine if I don’t have a scale?"
faqA2: "A level teaspoon of margarine is roughly 5g. For sticky margarine, lightly grease the spoon first. Alternatively, check pre-packaged margarine tubs, which often have markings for small amounts."
faqQ3: "Why is 5g of margarine commonly used in air fryer recipes?"
faqA3: "Small amounts like 5g are ideal for greasing baskets or adding minimal fat for crispiness without excess oil. Air fryers need less fat than traditional frying, so precise measurements matter."
faqQ4: "Does 5g of margarine equal 5ml?"
faqA4: "No, grams measure weight, while millilitres measure volume. Margarine’s density means 5g is roughly 5.4ml, but for accuracy, always weigh it. Use our conversion chart for other amounts."

<p>5g of margarine equals approximately 0.18 ounces. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements can make or break your dish. Whether you’re whipping up crispy potatoes or a buttery cake, knowing how to convert grams to ounces ensures consistency.

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air frying</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of margarine can affect texture, browning, and overall taste. Too little, and your food might dry out; too much, and it could become greasy. Air fryers circulate hot air, so fats like margarine need to be measured precisely. For example, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipes</a> often call for small amounts of margarine to achieve that golden crispiness. A digital kitchen scale is your best friend here, but if you don’t have one, conversions like 5g to ounces come in handy.</p>  

<h3>How to measure 5g of margarine without a scale</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a scale, you can use measuring spoons or visual cues. A teaspoon of margarine is roughly 5g, but this can vary slightly depending on density. For sticky margarine, lightly grease the spoon first for easier release.

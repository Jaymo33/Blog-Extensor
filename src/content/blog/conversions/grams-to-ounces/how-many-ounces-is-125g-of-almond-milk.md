faqQ1: "Is 125g of almond milk the same as 125ml?"
faqA1: "No, 125g of almond milk is not the same as 125ml. Weight (grams) and volume (millilitres) measure different properties. Almond milk has a density close to water, so 125g is roughly 125ml, but this can vary slightly depending on brand and additives. For precise air fryer recipes, always weigh ingredients."
faqQ2: "Can I use a measuring cup instead of a scale for 125g of almond milk?"
faqA2: "While a measuring cup can give you a rough estimate, a digital scale is far more accurate. 125g of almond milk is approximately half a US cup, but slight variations can affect your recipe. For best results, especially in air fryer baking, always use a scale."
faqQ3: "Does almond milk weigh the same as regular milk?"
faqA3: "Almond milk is slightly lighter than regular milk due to its lower fat content. However, the difference is minimal for most recipes. 125g of almond milk is roughly equivalent in volume to cow’s milk, but always check your recipe for specific requirements."
faqQ4: "How do I store leftover almond milk after measuring 125g?"
faqA4: "Store leftover almond milk in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 5 days. Shake well before using, as separation is natural. For longer storage, freeze almond milk in ice cube trays and thaw as needed for future air fryer recipes."

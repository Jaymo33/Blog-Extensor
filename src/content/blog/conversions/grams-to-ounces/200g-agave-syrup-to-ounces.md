faqQ1: "Can I use honey instead of agave syrup in air fryer recipes?"
faqA1: "Yes, honey can be substituted for agave syrup in most recipes. However, honey is slightly thicker and sweeter, so you may need to reduce the quantity by about 10-15%. Adjust cooking times slightly, as honey can caramelise faster in the air fryer."
faqQ2: "How do I measure 200g of agave syrup without a scale?"
faqA2: "If you don’t have a scale, use a measuring cup. 200g of agave syrup is roughly 0.88 cups or 7.05 ounces. Pour slowly and level off the top for accuracy. For sticky ingredients like agave, lightly greasing the cup can help it slide out easily."
faqQ3: "Does agave syrup affect air fryer cooking times?"
faqA3: "Agave syrup can slightly reduce cooking times due to its sugar content, which caramelises quickly. If using it in glazes or marinades, keep an eye on your food to prevent over-browning. Preheating the air fryer can help distribute heat evenly."
faqQ4: "Where can I find air fryer recipes using agave syrup?"
faqA4: "You’ll find plenty of recipes using agave syrup on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, especially in dessert and marinade categories. Try our air-fried cinnamon apples or honey-glazed carrots for delicious, naturally sweetened dishes."

faqQ1: "Can I use single cream instead of double cream in air fryer recipes?"
faqA1: "Yes, but single cream has a lower fat content (around 18%) compared to double cream (48%). This means it won’t whip as well and may result in a less rich texture. For best results, stick to double cream when the recipe calls for it."
faqQ2: "How do I convert 150g of double cream to cups?"
faqA2: "150g of double cream is roughly ⅔ cup. However, measuring by weight (grams or ounces) is more accurate for air fryer recipes, as cup measurements can vary based on how the cream is poured."
faqQ3: "Why does my air fryer recipe with double cream turn out soggy?"
faqA3: "Too much double cream can make batters or coatings too wet, leading to soggy results. Always measure carefully—150g (5.29 oz) is a common amount, but adjust based on your recipe’s requirements."
faqQ4: "Can I freeze leftover double cream for later use in air fryer recipes?"
faqA4: "Yes, you can freeze double cream, though it may separate slightly when thawed. Whisk it gently before using. Freeze in 150g (5.29 oz) portions for easy use in future recipes like sauces or desserts."

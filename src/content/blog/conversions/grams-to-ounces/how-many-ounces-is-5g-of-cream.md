faqQ1: "Can I use milliliters instead of grams for measuring cream?"
faqA1: "Yes, but density matters. For thin cream, 5g is roughly 5ml, but thicker creams like double cream may vary slightly. Always check the packaging or use a scale for precision."
faqQ2: "Does the type of cream affect the conversion from grams to ounces?"
faqA2: "No, the conversion (5g = 0.176 oz) applies to all cream types, but thicker creams may pack differently. Whipped cream, for example, is lighter by volume, so weight measurements are more reliable."
faqQ3: "How do I measure 5g of cream if I only have measuring cups?"
faqA3: "A US teaspoon holds about 5g (0.176 oz) of liquid cream. For thicker creams, lightly spoon it into the teaspoon without packing it down. For larger amounts, refer to a conversion chart."
faqQ4: "Why do some recipes use grams and others use ounces for cream?"
faqA4: "Recipes may follow metric (grams) or imperial (ounces) systems based on region. UK recipes often use grams, while US ones favour ounces. Always convert for accuracy, especially in air fryer cooking."

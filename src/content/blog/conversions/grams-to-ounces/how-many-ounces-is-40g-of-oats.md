faqQ1: "Can I use cups instead of grams or ounces for measuring oats?"
faqA1: "While you can use cups, it's less accurate than weighing oats in grams or ounces. A cup of oats can vary in weight depending on how tightly packed they are. For air fryer recipes, where precision affects cooking time and texture, weighing 40g (about 1.41 ounces) is best."
faqQ2: "Does the type of oat affect the 40g to ounces conversion?"
faqA2: "The type of oat (rolled, steel-cut, or instant) can slightly alter the volume but not the weight. 40g of any oat type will always be 1.41 ounces. However, steel-cut oats are denser, so they may take up less space in a measuring cup compared to rolled oats."
faqQ3: "Why is 40g of oats a common measurement in recipes?"
faqA3: "40g of oats is roughly a single serving, making it convenient for portion-controlled meals like overnight oats or granola. In air fryer recipes, it's enough to coat chicken fillets or make a small batch of oat crumble without leftovers. It's a practical quantity for everyday cooking."
faqQ4: "How do I convert 40g of oats to tablespoons?"
faqA4: "40g of oats is approximately 5-6 tablespoons, but this can vary based on the oat type and how finely they're ground. For air fryer coatings or batters, weighing is more reliable. If you must use tablespoons, fluff the oats first for a looser measure."

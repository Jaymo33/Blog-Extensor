From <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken dishes</a> to baked goods, precise liquid measurements ensure consistent results.</p>

<h3>The Science Behind Water Measurements</h3>
<p>Water has a density of 1g per millilitre, making weight-to-volume conversions straightforward. This means 5g of water occupies 5ml, which converts to 0.176 ounces. Understanding this relationship helps when scaling recipes up or down for your air fryer.</p>

<h2>Common Uses for 5g of Water in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>
<p>Small amounts of water, like 5g (0.176 ounces), are often used in air fryer recipes to create steam. This prevents drying out when cooking foods like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetables</a> or reheating bread. The moisture helps achieve that perfect crispy-yet-tender texture.</p>
<p>Marinades and glazes also frequently call for small water quantities. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we've found that 5g of water can help thin thick sauces without diluting flavour. This ensures even coating on foods like wings or tofu.</p>

<h3>Converting Other Small Quantities</h3>
<p>The same conversion principle applies to other small measurements. For example, 10g of water equals 0.352 ounces, while 15g is approximately 0.529 ounces. These conversions are useful when adjusting air fryer recipes to suit your preferences.</p>

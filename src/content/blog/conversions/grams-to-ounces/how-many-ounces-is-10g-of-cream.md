faqQ1: "Can I use tablespoons to measure 10g of cream instead of a scale?"
faqA1: "While a scale is the most accurate method, 10g of cream is roughly 2 teaspoons. However, cream's density can vary slightly, so for best results, especially in air fryer recipes, a digital scale is recommended."
faqQ2: "Does the type of cream affect the 10g to ounces conversion?"
faqA2: "No, the conversion remains the same whether you're using single, double, or whipped cream. However, whipped cream's air content means 10g may take up more volume, so weight measurements are more reliable."
faqQ3: "Why is 10g of cream a common measurement in recipes?"
faqA3: "10g of cream is often used for small adjustments in texture or richness, such as thinning a sauce or adding moisture to baked goods. It's a precise amount that avoids overpowering other flavours."
faqQ4: "How do I convert 10g of cream to ounces for US recipes?"
faqA4: "The conversion is the same (0.35 ounces), but US recipes may use fluid ounces for liquids. Since cream is slightly denser than water, weight measurements (grams to ounces) are more accurate than volume."

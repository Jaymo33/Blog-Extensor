faqQ1: "Can I use a different oil if I don’t have sunflower oil?"
faqA1: "Yes, you can substitute sunflower oil with other high-smoke-point oils like vegetable, rapeseed, or light olive oil. Just ensure you use the same weight (250g or 8.82 ounces) for accurate results. Each oil may slightly alter the flavour, so choose one that complements your dish."
faqQ2: "Why is sunflower oil recommended for air frying?"
faqA2: "Sunflower oil has a high smoke point, making it ideal for air frying at high temperatures. It also has a neutral taste, so it won’t overpower your food. Plus, its light texture helps achieve crispy results without excess grease."
faqQ3: "How do I measure 250g of sunflower oil without a scale?"
faqA3: "Use a liquid measuring cup to measure 8.82 fluid ounces, as 250g of sunflower oil equals this volume. Alternatively, 15 tablespoons of sunflower oil will give you roughly 250g. Always check for consistency in your recipe."
faqQ4: "Does the type of sunflower oil affect the conversion?"
faqA4: "No, whether you use refined or unrefined sunflower oil, 250g will always equal 8.82 ounces. However, refined sunflower oil is better for high-heat cooking like air frying, while unrefined is better for dressings or low-heat dishes."

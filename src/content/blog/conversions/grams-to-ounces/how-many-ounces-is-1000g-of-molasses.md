The conversion remains consistent because weight measurements don't vary between measurement systems like volume measurements sometimes do.

faqA2: "While you can use a liquid measuring cup, it's not ideal for measuring 1000g (35.27 oz) of molasses due to its thick, sticky consistency. A kitchen scale gives the most accurate measurement. If using a cup, lightly grease it first and pack the molasses firmly to eliminate air pockets for the closest approximation."
faqQ3: "How does molasses weight compare to other sweeteners in air fryer recipes?"
faqA3: "Molasses is significantly denser than many other sweeteners. While 1000g equals 35.27 ounces of molasses, the same weight of honey would measure slightly less in volume due to differences in density. Always weigh ingredients rather than relying on volume measurements for best results in air fryer baking."
faqQ4: "What's the best way to measure small amounts of molasses for air fryer recipes?"
faqA4: "For amounts smaller than 1000g (35.27 oz), use measuring spoons and the displacement method. Fill a measuring spoon with water first, then add molasses until the water reaches the desired measurement mark. The molasses will displace the water, giving you an accurate small quantity without waste."

faqQ1: "Can I use a kitchen scale instead of measuring cups for corn syrup?"
faqA1: "Yes, weighing corn syrup is more accurate. 4.0 cups (946 ml) of corn syrup weigh roughly 1.36 kg. Use a digital scale for precision, especially in baking."
faqQ2: "Does the type of corn syrup affect the ml conversion?"
faqA2: "No, light and dark corn syrup have similar densities, so 4.0 cups equal 946 ml for both. Dark syrup has molasses added, but the volume remains the same."
faqQ3: "How do I measure 4.0 cups of corn syrup without a jug?"
faqA3: "Use a standard 240 ml measuring cup four times, filling it slightly under the rim for accuracy. For 946 ml total, this method works in a pinch."
faqQ4: "Can I reduce the amount of corn syrup in an air fryer recipe?"
faqA4: "Yes, but it may alter texture and sweetness. For glazes, try replacing half with water or citrus juice to maintain volume while cutting sugar."

<p>4.0 cups of corn syrup is equivalent to approximately 946 ml. This conversion is essential for precision in baking, glazing, or creating syrupy treats in your air fryer. Whether you're following a British or American recipe, knowing how to convert cups to millilitres ensures your dishes turn out perfectly every time.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>When working with corn syrup, even small measurement discrepancies can affect texture and sweetness. Air fryer recipes, like sticky glazes or caramelised desserts, rely on precise ratios. Using 946 ml instead of 4.0 cups ensures consistency, especially when adapting recipes from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>our collection</a>.</p>  
<p>Corn syrup’s viscosity means volume measurements must be spot-on. Too little, and your glaze won’t stick; too much, and it overpowers other flavours.

<h2>Converting Cups to Millilitres</h2>  
<p>The standard conversion for 1 cup of liquid is 236.6 ml, so 4.0 cups equal 946 ml. This applies to corn syrup, though its density is slightly higher than water. For most recipes, the difference is negligible, but for precision, use a measuring jug marked in millilitres.</p>  
<p>If your recipe calls for 4.0 cups of corn syrup in ml, you can confidently use 946 ml. This is particularly useful for <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert recipes</a>, where balance is key. Always level off your measuring cups for accuracy.</p>  

<h3>US vs UK Measurements</h3>  
<p>While US and UK cups are similar (1 US cup = 236.6 ml, 1 UK cup = 250 ml), most recipes default to US measurements. For 4.0 cups of corn syrup, stick to 946 ml unless specified otherwise. This avoids confusion, especially when using international recipes.</p>  

<h2>Using Corn Syrup in Air Fryer Recipes</h2>  
<p>Corn syrup is a staple in air fryer glazes, like those for sticky wings or doughnuts. Measuring 4.0 cups (946 ml) ensures the right consistency for coating. Too thick, and it won’t spread; too thin, and it drips off during cooking.</p>  
<p>For a foolproof glaze, heat the corn syrup slightly before mixing. This improves flow and adhesion. Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipes</a> for inspiration on using corn syrup in savoury dishes.</p>  

<h3>Alternative Sweeteners</h3>  
<p>If you’re out of corn syrup, golden syrup or honey can substitute in a pinch. However, their flavours differ, so adjust quantities slightly. For 4.0 cups of corn syrup (946 ml), use 880 ml of honey, as it’s sweeter.</p>  

<h2>Cleaning Up Sticky Residue</h2>  
<p>Corn syrup leaves a sticky film on air fryer baskets. After cooking, soak the basket in warm, soapy water to dissolve residue. For stubborn spots, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning guide</a> has expert tips.</p>  
<p>Prevent mess by lining the basket with parchment paper when using syrupy coatings. This makes cleanup easier and preserves your air fryer’s non-stick surface.</p>

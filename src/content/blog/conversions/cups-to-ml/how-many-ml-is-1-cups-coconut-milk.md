faqQ1: "Does the type of coconut milk affect the ml measurement per cup?"
faqA1: "No, the ml measurement remains the same whether you use canned, carton, or homemade coconut milk. However, thicker coconut cream will have a higher fat content, so adjust recipes accordingly for air fryer cooking to prevent excess oiliness."
faqQ2: "Can I use the same conversion for light and full-fat coconut milk?"
faqA2: "Yes, 1.0 cups of both light and full-fat coconut milk equals 240 ml. The difference lies in fat content, not volume. For air fryer recipes, full-fat coconut milk adds richer flavour, while light versions reduce calorie density."
faqQ3: "How do I measure coconut milk if I don’t have a measuring cup?"
faqA3: "Use a standard metric measuring jug or kitchen scales (1 ml = 1 gram for coconut milk). For air fryer recipes, accuracy is key—avoid using tablespoons or guessing, as uneven liquid distribution affects cooking results."
faqQ4: "Why do some recipes list coconut milk in grams instead of ml?"
faqA4: "Grams measure weight, while ml measure volume. Since coconut milk’s density is nearly 1 g/ml, the values are often interchangeable. For air fryer precision, stick to your recipe’s specified unit or consult a conversion chart."

<p>1.0 cups of coconut milk equals approximately 240 millilitres (ml). This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes, where precision ensures even cooking and perfect textures. Whether you're making curries, desserts, or sauces, knowing the exact ml measurement helps avoid kitchen mishaps.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of coconut milk can make or break your air fryer dish. Too little, and your recipe might turn out dry; too much, and it could become soggy. Air fryers rely on hot air circulation, so liquid ratios must be spot-on.

<h3>UK vs. US Cup Measurements</h3>  
<p>While 1.0 UK cup is 284 ml, most recipes (including those on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>) use the US standard of 240 ml per cup. Always check which measurement system your recipe follows to avoid errors. This is especially crucial for air fryer baking, where precision affects rising and browning.</p>  

<h2>How to Measure Coconut Milk Correctly</h2>  
<p>Coconut milk can separate, so always stir it well before measuring. For the most accurate results, use a liquid measuring cup on a flat surface. If you're using canned coconut milk, shake the tin vigorously or whisk it to blend the cream and liquid.</p>  

<p>For air fryer recipes, slightly thicker coconut milk works better for coatings or marinades, while thinner versions are ideal for sauces. Explore <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert recipes</a> that use coconut milk for luscious, dairy-free treats.</p>

<h2>Converting Other Coconut Milk Measurements</h2>

<h3>Common Mistakes When Measuring Coconut Milk</h3>
<p>One frequent error is using a dry measuring cup for liquids, which can lead to inaccuracies. Another is not accounting for the cream layer in canned coconut milk, which skews the measurement. Always stir or shake the can thoroughly before measuring 2.0 cups (473 ml) for consistency. If using homemade coconut milk, ensure it’s well-blended to avoid separation. For sticky residues, rinse your measuring cup with warm water or use a light cooking spray.</p>

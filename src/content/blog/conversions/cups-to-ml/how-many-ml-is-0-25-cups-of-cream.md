faqQ1: "Is 0.25 cups of cream the same as 60 ml?"
faqA1: "0.25 cups of cream is approximately 59 ml, which is very close to 60 ml. For most recipes, this small difference won’t affect the outcome. However, for precise baking, it’s best to measure exactly 59 ml if possible."
faqQ2: "Can I use milk instead of cream for 0.25 cups in a recipe?"
faqA2: "You can substitute milk for cream, but the result will be less rich and creamy. If using milk, consider adding a bit of butter (about 1 tablespoon per 0.25 cups) to mimic the fat content of cream. This works well in sauces but may not be ideal for whipping."
faqQ3: "How do I measure 0.25 cups of cream without a measuring cup?"
faqA3: "If you don’t have a measuring cup, you can use a tablespoon. 0.25 cups equals 4 tablespoons, which is roughly 59 ml. Alternatively, use a kitchen scale to weigh out 60 grams of cream for a close approximation."
faqQ4: "Does the type of cream affect the ml measurement for 0.25 cups?"
faqA4: "The type of cream (single, double, or whipping) doesn’t change the ml measurement for 0.25 cups. However, the fat content will affect the texture and consistency of your dish. Double cream will be thicker, while single cream is lighter. Always choose the type specified in your recipe."

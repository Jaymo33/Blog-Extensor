faqQ1: "Is 3.0 cups of soy sauce the same in the UK and US?"
faqA1: "No, UK and US cup measurements differ slightly. A US cup is 236.59 ml, making 3.0 cups about 710 ml. A UK cup is 284.13 ml, so 3.0 cups would be roughly 852 ml. Always check which standard your recipe uses to avoid measurement errors."
faqQ2: "Can I use a kitchen scale to measure 3.0 cups of soy sauce in ml?"
faqA2: "Yes! Since 1 ml of soy sauce weighs approximately 1 gram, you can weigh 710 grams for 3.0 US cups (710 ml). This method is especially useful if you don’t have a liquid measuring jug with ml markings."
faqQ3: "What’s the best way to reduce the saltiness if I’ve added too much soy sauce?"
faqA3: "Balance excess soy sauce with a splash of water, citrus juice, or a sweetener like honey or brown sugar. For air fryer recipes, you can also add more of the main ingredient (e.g., chicken or vegetables) to dilute the flavour."
faqQ4: "How long does opened soy sauce last in the fridge?"
faqA4: "Opened soy sauce stays fresh for up to three years if refrigerated and stored in an airtight container. Its flavour may gradually diminish over time, but it remains safe to use. Always check for off smells or mould before using."

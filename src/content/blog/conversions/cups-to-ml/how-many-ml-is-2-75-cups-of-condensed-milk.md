faqQ1: "Does condensed milk weigh the same as regular milk when converting cups to ml?"
faqA1: "No, condensed milk is denser due to reduced water content. While 1 cup of regular milk is about 240 ml, condensed milk’s thickness means 2.75 cups equal roughly 650 ml. Always measure by volume for accuracy in air fryer recipes."
faqQ2: "Can I use evaporated milk instead of condensed milk in a 2.75-cup measurement?"
faqA2: "Evaporated milk isn’t a direct substitute—it lacks the sugar content. If swapping, adjust sweetness and reduce liquid elsewhere. For air fryer desserts, stick to condensed milk unless the recipe specifies otherwise."
faqQ3: "Why do some recipes list condensed milk in grams instead of cups or ml?"
faqA3: "Weight (grams) is more precise, especially for thick ingredients. If your recipe uses grams, 2.75 cups of condensed milk weighs about 810 grams. Use a kitchen scale for best results in air fryer baking."
faqQ4: "How do I store leftover condensed milk after measuring 2.75 cups?"
faqA4: "Transfer leftovers to an airtight container and refrigerate for up to 2 weeks. For longer storage, freeze in 650 ml (2.75-cup) portions. Thaw in the fridge before using in air fryer recipes."

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Recipes</h2>
<p>Air fryers cook food quickly and evenly, but only if ingredient ratios are spot-on. Too much or too little condensed milk can throw off textures, especially in desserts like fudge or cheesecake bites. Using 650 ml (2.75 cups) guarantees the right sweetness and consistency. Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer dessert recipes</a> for inspiration.</p>
<p>Condensed milk is thicker than regular milk, so volume conversions are crucial. A slight mismeasurement could lead to overly dense or runny results. For best results, use a liquid measuring jug for ml or dry measuring cups for the US standard. Need cleaning tips?

<h3>How to Measure 2.75 Cups of Condensed Milk Without a Scale</h3>
<p>If you don’t have a kitchen scale, use the ml markings on a measuring jug. Pour slowly to the 650 ml line for accuracy. For sticky condensed milk, lightly grease the cup or jug first. This method works perfectly for air fryer recipes like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>desserts</a> or glazes.</p>

<h2>US vs. UK Cup Measurements for Condensed Milk</h2>
<p>In the UK, 1 cup equals 284 ml, while in the US, it’s 240 ml. For 2.75 cups, this means roughly 781 ml (UK) or 660 ml (US). However, most recipes standardise to the US measurement (650 ml). Always check the recipe origin to avoid confusion. For more global conversions, visit our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a>.</p>
<p>Air fryer recipes often use US cups, so 650 ml is the safest bet. If adapting a UK recipe, adjust slightly or split the difference. For example, a <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>cake recipe</a> might need tweaking. When in doubt, stick to weight measurements for precision.</p>

<h3>Common Recipes Using 2.75 Cups (650 ml) of Condensed Milk</h3>

faqQ2: "Can I use a kitchen scale instead of measuring cups for tomato sauce?"

<p>0.75 cups of tomato sauce equals approximately 177 ml. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements can make or break a dish. Whether you’re whipping up a quick pasta sauce or a rich casserole, knowing the exact millilitre equivalent ensures consistency. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we focus on making conversions effortless for home cooks.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>
<p>Air fryers rely on rapid hot air circulation, meaning ingredient ratios must be spot-on for even cooking. Too much or too little tomato sauce can affect texture and flavour. For example, 0.75 cups of tomato sauce (177 ml) is a common measurement for single-serving dishes like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer lasagna</a> or meatball subs. Precision ensures your sauce doesn’t dry out or become overly watery.</p>
<p>Using millilitres (ml) is often easier than cups, especially when scaling recipes. A kitchen scale or liquid measuring jug helps, but memorising key conversions like 0.75 cups = 177 ml saves time. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more handy tips.</p>

<h2>How to Measure 0.75 Cups of Tomato Sauce Correctly</h2>
<p>For the most accurate 177 ml measurement, use a liquid measuring cup with clear ml markings. Spoon the tomato sauce in gently to avoid air pockets, and level it off with a knife. If you’re using a scale, note that 177 ml of tomato sauce weighs roughly 180 grams due to its density. This method works for both <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable-based sauces</a> and meaty ragùs.</p>

<h3>Common Recipes Using 0.75 Cups (177 ml) of Tomato Sauce</h3>
<p>This quantity is perfect for small-batch air fryer dishes. Try it in <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>stuffed peppers</a> or as a base for mini pizzas. The concentrated heat of the air fryer means sauces thicken quickly, so 177 ml provides ample coverage without overflowing.</p>

<h2>US vs. UK Cup Measurements</h2>
<p>While 0.75 US cups equal 177 ml, UK cups measure 213 ml due to differing standards. Always confirm which cup measurement your recipe uses. For air fryer cooking, we recommend sticking to millilitres for universal accuracy. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning guide</a> also ensures your appliance stays in top shape after saucy recipes.</p>
<p>If adapting a US recipe, reduce the UK cup amount by 17% to match the 177 ml equivalent. This avoids overly watery results. For more conversions, bookmark our site for quick reference.</p>

<h3>Tips for Substituting Tomato Sauce in Air Fryer Recipes</h3>
<p>If you’re out of tomato sauce, 177 ml of passata or crushed tomatoes works well. Adjust seasoning as these alternatives are less concentrated. For a creamier texture, mix in 2 tbsp of yogurt or coconut milk per 177 ml of sauce.</p>

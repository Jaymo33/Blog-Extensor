faqQ1: "Is 1.25 cups of condensed milk the same in the UK and US?"
faqA1: "Yes, 1.25 cups of condensed milk equals approximately 295.74 ml in both the UK and US. While tablespoon sizes vary slightly between regions, cup measurements for liquids like condensed milk are standardized in recipes. Always use a liquid measuring jug for accuracy."
faqQ2: "Can I use evaporated milk instead of condensed milk in this measurement?"
faqA2: "No, evaporated milk and condensed milk are not interchangeable. Condensed milk is sweetened and thicker, so substituting it with evaporated milk (unsweetened) will alter the recipe’s texture and sweetness. Stick to the exact measurement of 295.74 ml (1.25 cups) of condensed milk for best results."
faqQ3: "How do I measure 1.25 cups of condensed milk without a measuring jug?"
faqA3: "If you don’t have a measuring jug, use standard cups and spoons: 1 cup plus 4 tablespoons (since 1/4 cup = 4 tablespoons) will give you roughly 1.25 cups (295.74 ml). For sticky ingredients like condensed milk, lightly grease the measuring tools to ensure all the milk is transferred."
faqQ4: "Why does my air fryer recipe require such precise measurements for condensed milk?"
faqA4: "Air fryers cook food quickly and evenly, so ingredient proportions are critical. Too much condensed milk (over 295.74 ml for 1.25 cups) can make desserts overly dense or cause spills, while too little may dry them out. Precision ensures perfect texture and cooking times every time."

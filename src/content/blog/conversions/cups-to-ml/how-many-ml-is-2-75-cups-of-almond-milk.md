faqQ1: "Is 2.75 cups of almond milk the same in the UK and USA?"
faqA1: "Yes, 2.75 cups of almond milk equals 651 ml in both the UK and USA. Cup measurements are standardized in recipes, but always use a liquid measuring jug for accuracy. Differences in almond milk brands’ thickness may slightly affect volume, but the conversion remains consistent."
faqQ2: "Can I use this conversion for other non-dairy milks?"
faqA2: "Absolutely! This conversion works for oat, soy, or coconut milk, as they share similar densities. However, thicker milks like canned coconut milk may need adjustment. For precise results, check our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a> for other liquids."
faqQ3: "Why does my air fryer recipe turn out soggy with almond milk?"
faqA3: "Sogginess often comes from excess liquid. Ensure you’ve measured 651 ml (2.75 cups) accurately and pat ingredients dry before cooking. Air fryers circulate heat, so reducing liquid by 1-2 tablespoons can help. For troubleshooting, visit our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipes page</a>."
faqQ4: "How do I store leftover almond milk after measuring 2.75 cups?"
faqA4: "Refrigerate opened almond milk in a sealed container for up to 7 days. Shake well before reusing, as separation is normal. For longer storage, freeze in 651 ml portions—thaw in the fridge overnight before using in your next air fryer recipe."

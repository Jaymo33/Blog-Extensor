<p>To measure 3.75 cups of oat milk accurately, use a liquid measuring cup with clear ml markings. Fill it to the 887 ml line for the closest approximation.

<h2>Converting Other Cup Measurements to ml</h2>  
<p>If you frequently work with cup measurements, it’s helpful to know a few key conversions. For example, 1 cup of oat milk is 236.59 ml, 2 cups are 473.18 ml, and 4 cups equal 946.35 ml.

<p>When scaling recipes, remember that ml measurements are more precise than cups, which can vary slightly depending on how you fill them. This is especially important for air fryer cooking, where even small discrepancies can affect cooking times and results. Always double-check your conversions to ensure perfect dishes every time.</p>  

<h3>Tips for Storing and Using Oat Milk in Air Fryer Recipes</h3>  
<p>Oat milk should be stored in the fridge and used within 7-10 days of opening. Shake well before measuring, as it can separate over time. For best results in air fryer recipes, use unsweetened oat milk unless the recipe specifies otherwise. Sweetened varieties can caramelise or burn at high temperatures.</p>

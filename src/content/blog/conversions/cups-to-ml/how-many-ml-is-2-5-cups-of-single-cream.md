faqQ1: "Is 2.5 cups of single cream the same in the UK and USA?"
faqA1: "Yes, 2.5 cups of single cream is the same volume in both the UK and USA, equalling 600 ml. However, single cream in the UK has a slightly lower fat content (around 18%) compared to light cream in the USA (around 20%). For air fryer recipes, this small difference usually doesn’t affect the outcome."
faqQ2: "Can I use double cream instead of single cream in an air fryer recipe?"
faqA2: "You can substitute double cream for single cream, but you’ll need to adjust the quantity slightly. Double cream is thicker and richer, so use about 20% less to avoid overly heavy results. For 2.5 cups (600 ml) of single cream, try using 480 ml of double cream instead."
faqQ3: "How do I store leftover single cream after measuring 2.5 cups?"
faqA3: "Leftover single cream should be stored in an airtight container in the fridge and used within 2-3 days. To extend its shelf life, you can freeze it, though the texture may change slightly. Thaw in the fridge before using it in air fryer recipes."
faqQ4: "What’s the best way to measure 2.5 cups of single cream without a jug?"
faqA4: "If you don’t have a measuring jug, use a standard metric cup (240 ml per cup). Measure out 2 full cups (480 ml) and then add half a cup (120 ml) to reach 600 ml total. For even more precision, a kitchen scale set to grams (1 ml = 1 g for single cream) can also work."

faqQ1: "Is 0.25 cups of heavy cream the same in the UK and USA?"
faqA1: "Yes, 0.25 cups of heavy cream is the same measurement in both the UK and USA, equating to approximately 59 ml. However, double-check if the recipe specifies metric or imperial measurements for complete accuracy."
faqQ2: "Can I use milk instead of heavy cream in a recipe?"
faqA2: "While milk can substitute heavy cream in some recipes, it won’t provide the same richness or thickness. For best results, use a mixture of milk and butter (1 tbsp butter + 3/4 cup milk per 1 cup heavy cream) as a closer alternative."
faqQ3: "How do I store leftover heavy cream?"
faqA3: "Store opened heavy cream in an airtight container in the fridge for up to a week. For longer storage, freeze it in ice cube trays and thaw as needed, though the texture may change slightly."
faqQ4: "What’s the best way to measure 0.25 cups of heavy cream without a measuring cup?"
faqA4: "If you don’t have a measuring cup, use a tablespoon (15 ml) to measure out roughly 4 tablespoons for 59 ml. Alternatively, a kitchen scale set to grams (60g) can provide an accurate substitute."

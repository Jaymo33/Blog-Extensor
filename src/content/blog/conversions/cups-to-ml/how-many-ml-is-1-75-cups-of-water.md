faqQ1: "Does 1.75 cups of water weigh the same as 414 ml?"
faqA1: "Yes, 1.75 cups of water equals 414 ml in volume, and since water's density is 1 g/ml, it also weighs 414 grams. This makes it easy to switch between measuring by volume or weight for air fryer recipes."
faqQ2: "Can I use a regular drinking cup to measure 1.75 cups of water?"
faqA2: "No, standard drinking cups vary in size. Always use a kitchen measuring cup marked with cups and ml for accuracy. Air fryer recipes, like those on airfryerrecipe.co.uk, rely on precise measurements for consistent results."
faqQ3: "Why do some recipes specify ml instead of cups for water?"
faqA3: "Ml measurements are more precise, especially in baking or steam-based air fryer dishes. Cups can vary by region (US vs UK), while ml is universal. Our conversion charts at airfryerrecipe.co.uk help bridge the gap."
faqQ4: "How do I measure 1.75 cups of water without a measuring cup?"
faqA4: "Use a scale: 414 ml of water weighs 414 grams. Alternatively, a standard UK tablespoon holds 15 ml, so 28 tablespoons equal roughly 414 ml. For air fryer recipes, investing in proper tools is worth it."

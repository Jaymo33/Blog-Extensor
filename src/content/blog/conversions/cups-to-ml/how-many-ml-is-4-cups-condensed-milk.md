faqQ1: "Does 4.0 cups of condensed milk weigh the same as 946 ml?"
faqA1: "Yes, 4.0 cups of condensed milk equals 946 ml in volume, and this roughly translates to 1.1 kg in weight. However, slight variations can occur depending on the brand or density, so for baking precision, weighing is best."
faqQ2: "Can I use evaporated milk instead of condensed milk in a 4.0-cup recipe?"
faqA2: "No, evaporated milk is unsweetened, while condensed milk is sweetened and thicker. Substituting them 1:1 will drastically alter your recipe's taste and texture. If you must swap, adjust sugar and cooking times accordingly."
faqQ3: "How do I measure 4.0 cups of condensed milk without a jug?"
faqA3: "Use a standard 240 ml (1-cup) measure and fill it four times, levelling off each cup with a knife. For sticky condensed milk, lightly grease the cup first to help it pour cleanly."
faqQ4: "Why do air fryer recipes sometimes need adjusted condensed milk quantities?"
faqA4: "Air fryers cook faster and more intensely than ovens, so reducing liquids like condensed milk by 10-15% can prevent overflow or burning. Always check recipe notes for air fryer-specific adaptations."

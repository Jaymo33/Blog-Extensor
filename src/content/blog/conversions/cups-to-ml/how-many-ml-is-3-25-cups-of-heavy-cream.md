faqQ1: "Is 3.25 cups of heavy cream the same in the UK and US?"
faqA1: "Yes, 3.25 cups of heavy cream is the same volume in both the UK and US. However, cup sizes can vary slightly in other countries, so it’s best to use a standard measuring cup or convert to ml (768 ml) for accuracy, especially in air fryer recipes."
faqQ2: "Can I use whipped cream instead of heavy cream in a 3.25 cup measurement?"
faqA2: "Whipped cream and heavy cream are not interchangeable in the same quantities. Heavy cream is liquid, while whipped cream is aerated. For 3.25 cups of heavy cream (768 ml), you’d need to adjust if substituting with whipped cream, as the volume and texture will differ."
faqQ3: "How do I store leftover heavy cream after measuring 3.25 cups?"
faqA3: "Leftover heavy cream should be refrigerated in an airtight container and used within 3–5 days. For longer storage, freeze it in portions. When ready to use, thaw and stir well before incorporating into air fryer recipes or other dishes."
faqQ4: "What’s the best way to measure 3.25 cups of heavy cream without a measuring cup?"
faqA4: "If you don’t have a measuring cup, use a kitchen scale. Heavy cream weighs roughly 240 grams per cup, so 3.25 cups would be about 780 grams. Alternatively, use a ml-marked jug to measure 768 ml for precision in air fryer cooking."

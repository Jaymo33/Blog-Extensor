faqQ1: "Can I use bottled orange juice instead of fresh for air fryer recipes?"
faqA1: "Yes, bottled orange juice works, but fresh juice offers better flavour and fewer additives. If using bottled, check for added sugars or preservatives, which may affect the recipe’s taste. For marinades or glazes, fresh juice’s acidity tenderises meat more effectively."
faqQ2: "How do I convert 2.25 cups of orange juice to ml if I’m doubling the recipe?"
faqA2: "Simply multiply 532.32 ml (the equivalent of 2.25 cups) by 2 to get 1064.64 ml. This scaling works for any recipe adjustment—halving, tripling, etc. Always use precise measurements to maintain the dish’s balance, especially in air fryer cooking."
faqQ3: "Does the type of orange juice affect the ml measurement?"
faqA3: "No, the ml measurement remains the same whether using fresh, bottled, or concentrate (once reconstituted). However, pulp content may slightly alter the volume. For accuracy, strain pulpy juice before measuring 2.25 cups (532.32 ml)."
faqQ4: "Can I substitute another citrus juice for orange juice in air fryer recipes?"
faqA4: "Yes, lemon, lime, or grapefruit juice can work, but adjust quantities to taste due to varying acidity levels. For example, lime juice is sharper, so you might use less. Always measure substitutes in ml (e.g., 532.32 ml for 2.25 cups) for consistency."

<h3>How to Measure 2.25 Cups of Orange Juice Without a Measuring Cup</h3>

For desserts, this quantity is ideal for syrups or glazes—try it in our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>air fryer dessert recipes</a>.

<p>After measuring out 2.25 cups (532.32 ml) of orange juice, store any leftovers in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 3 days.

Avoid storing juice in metal containers, as the acidity can react with the metal and alter the flavour.</p>

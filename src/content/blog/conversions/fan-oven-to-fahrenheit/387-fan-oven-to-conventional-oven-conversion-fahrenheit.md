faqQ1: "Can I use the same temperature for fan and conventional ovens?"
faqA1: "No, fan ovens cook faster and more evenly, so you’ll need to adjust the temperature. For example, 387°F in a fan oven converts to around 350°F in a conventional oven. Always check your food to avoid overcooking."
faqQ2: "How do I convert 387 fan oven to air fryer settings?"
faqA2: "Air fryers work similarly to fan ovens but are more efficient. You can often use the same temperature (387°F) but reduce the cooking time by 10-15%. Start checking your food a few minutes early to prevent overcooking."
faqQ3: "Why does my food cook faster in a fan oven?"
faqA3: "Fan ovens circulate hot air, which speeds up cooking and ensures even heat distribution. This means you’ll need lower temperatures or shorter cooking times compared to conventional ovens. Always monitor your food to avoid drying it out."
faqQ4: "What’s the best way to check if my food is done?"
faqA4: "Use a meat thermometer for meats and a skewer for baked goods. For meats, ensure the internal temperature reaches safe levels. For cakes, the skewer should come out clean. Adjust cooking times as needed based on your oven type."

<p>Converting 387 fan oven to conventional oven in Fahrenheit is straightforward: 387°F in a fan oven equals approximately 350°F in a conventional oven. This adjustment accounts for the efficient heat distribution of fan-assisted ovens, which cook food faster and more evenly. If you’re using an air fryer, you might also need to tweak the temperature further, as air fryers work similarly to fan ovens but with even more intensity.

<h2>Why Convert Fan Oven to Conventional Oven?</h2>
<p>Fan ovens circulate hot air, reducing cooking time and often requiring lower temperatures than conventional ovens. If a recipe calls for 387°F in a fan oven but you’re using a conventional oven, you’ll need to increase the temperature slightly to compensate. This ensures your dish cooks evenly without drying out. For example, roasting chicken at 387°F in a fan oven might only need 350°F in a conventional oven. Always monitor your food to avoid overcooking.</p>
<p>Understanding these conversions is especially useful when using an air fryer, which operates like a mini fan oven. If you’re adapting a fan oven recipe for an air fryer, you might need to reduce the temperature further. Explore <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>our recipe collection</a> for air fryer-friendly versions of your favourite dishes.</p>

<h2>How to Adjust Cooking Times</h2>
<p>When converting 387 fan oven to conventional oven, don’t forget to adjust the cooking time. Fan ovens cook faster, so if a recipe suggests 30 minutes at 387°F in a fan oven, you might need 35-40 minutes at 350°F in a conventional oven. Keep an eye on your food, especially when trying a new recipe. A meat thermometer can help ensure doneness without guesswork.</p>
<p>For air fryer users, cooking times can be even shorter. If you’re converting a fan oven recipe to an air fryer, start by reducing the time by 20% and check frequently. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipes</a> include handy air fryer adjustments to save you time.</p>

<h3>Common Mistakes to Avoid</h3>
<p>One of the biggest mistakes is assuming fan and conventional oven temperatures are interchangeable. Always convert temperatures to avoid undercooking or burning your food. Another pitfall is forgetting to preheat your oven, which can throw off cooking times. For air fryers, overcrowding the basket can lead to uneven cooking, so cook in batches if needed.</p>

<h3>Using an Air Fryer Instead of a Fan Oven</h3>
<p>Air fryers are essentially compact fan ovens, making them great for quick, crispy results. If a recipe calls for 387°F in a fan oven, you can often use the same temperature in an air fryer but reduce the cooking time by 10-15%. For example, crispy fries might take 20 minutes in a fan oven but only 15 in an air fryer.

<h2>Tips for Perfect Results Every Time</h2>
<p>Always preheat your oven or air fryer for consistent results. Use an oven thermometer to verify temperatures, as oven dials aren’t always accurate. For baked goods, rotate trays halfway through cooking to ensure even browning. If you’re adapting a fan oven recipe for a conventional oven, cover dishes with foil if they’re browning too quickly.</p>
<p>For air fryer users, shaking the basket halfway through cooking helps food crisp evenly.

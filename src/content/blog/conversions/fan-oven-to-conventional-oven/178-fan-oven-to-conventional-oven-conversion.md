faqQ1: "How do I convert 178 fan oven to celsius for baking?"
faqA1: "To convert 178 fan oven to celsius for conventional baking, simply reduce the temperature by 20°C. This means 178°C in a fan oven becomes 160°C in a conventional oven or air fryer. This adjustment ensures your baked goods cook evenly without over-browning."
faqQ2: "Is 178 fan oven the same as 178 conventional oven?"
faqA2: "No, 178 fan oven is not the same as 178 conventional oven. Fan ovens cook faster due to air circulation, so you must reduce the temperature by about 20°C when converting 178 fan oven to conventional oven settings. This means 178°C fan equals approximately 160°C conventional."
faqQ3: "How does 178 fan oven conversion work for air fryers?"
faqA3: "Air fryers typically follow conventional oven settings, so when converting 178 fan oven to air fryer equivalent, use 160°C. This temperature adjustment accounts for the air fryer's rapid air circulation, similar to how a fan oven operates but at a lower base temperature."
faqQ4: "Why do I need to adjust temperatures when converting 178 fan oven to regular oven?"
faqA4: "You need to adjust temperatures because fan ovens circulate hot air more efficiently, cooking food faster at lower temperatures. Converting 178 fan oven to regular oven by reducing to 160°C prevents overcooking and ensures proper doneness, especially important for delicate items like cakes or pastries."

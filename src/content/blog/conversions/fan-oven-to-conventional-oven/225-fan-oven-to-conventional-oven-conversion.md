faqQ1: "How do I convert 225 fan oven to gas mark?"
faqA1: "225 fan oven converts to gas mark 6 in a conventional oven. This is equivalent to 200°C. Remember that gas ovens often have hotter and cooler spots, so you may need to rotate your dishes during cooking."
faqQ2: "Can I use the same cooking time when converting 225 fan to conventional oven?"
faqA2: "No, cooking times will typically be longer in a conventional oven. Start checking your food about 5-10 minutes before the fan oven recipe suggests, then adjust as needed. The exact difference depends on your specific oven and what you're cooking."
faqQ3: "Why is there a temperature difference between fan and conventional ovens?"
faqA3: "Fan ovens circulate hot air constantly, making them more efficient at heat transfer. This means they can cook food faster at lower temperatures. Conventional ovens rely more on radiant heat, requiring higher temperatures to achieve similar results."
faqQ4: "How does 225 fan oven conversion work for air fryers?"
faqA4: "Air fryers work similarly to fan ovens, so you can often use the same temperature (225°C). However, cooking times are usually shorter in air fryers due to their compact size and powerful air circulation. Always check food earlier than the recipe suggests."

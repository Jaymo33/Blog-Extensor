<p>1.5 cups of diced peppers equals approximately 12 ounces (340 grams). This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes, where precise measurements ensure even cooking and perfect results every time. Whether you're prepping stuffed peppers or a vibrant stir-fry, knowing the weight helps you nail the recipe.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on hot air circulation to cook food evenly, so ingredient quantities can impact cooking times and textures. Too many diced peppers might overcrowd the basket, leading to unevenly cooked or soggy results. By converting 1.5 cups of diced peppers to ounces, you can portion ingredients correctly and avoid common pitfalls. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more handy measurement swaps.</p>  

<p>Diced peppers vary slightly in density depending on how finely they're chopped, but 1.5 cups generally weigh around 12 ounces. For best results, lightly pack the peppers into the measuring cup without pressing down too hard. This ensures consistency across recipes, whether you're following a <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>pepper-heavy dish</a> or improvising with leftovers.</p>  

<h3>How to measure diced peppers for air fryer recipes</h3>  
<p>Use a dry measuring cup for diced peppers, filling it to the brim and leveling off the top with a knife. If you're working with a kitchen scale, place your bowl on it, tare the weight, then add the peppers until you hit 12 ounces. This method eliminates guesswork and guarantees your air fryer meals turn out just right.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for 1.5 cups of diced peppers</h2>  
<p>This quantity is perfect for fajitas, stuffed peppers, or a colourful addition to air-fried omelettes. Diced peppers add sweetness and crunch, balancing richer ingredients like cheese or meat. For inspiration, browse our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable-based recipes</a> tailored for air fryers.</p>  

<p>If you're meal prepping, 1.5 cups (12 ounces) of diced peppers can be batch-cooked and stored for up to 3 days. Toss them in olive oil and air fry at 180°C for 8–10 minutes for tender-crisp results. They’re a versatile ingredient that works in everything from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>stir-fries</a> to breakfast hashes.</p>  

<h3>Adjusting recipes based on pepper weight</h3>  
<p>Some recipes call for peppers by weight (ounces) rather than volume (cups). If a dish requires 12 ounces of diced peppers and you’ve measured 1.5 cups, you’re spot on! For larger batches, simply scale up—3 cups would be roughly 24 ounces. Keep your <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>basket clean</a> between batches to avoid flavour transfer.</p>

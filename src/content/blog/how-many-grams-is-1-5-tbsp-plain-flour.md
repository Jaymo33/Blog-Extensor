<h2>Why accurate flour measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>
<p>Air fryers cook food quickly and evenly, but they rely on precise ingredient ratios for the best texture and rise.

<p>Many air fryer recipes from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> use gram measurements for consistency. This is particularly important when making delicate items like air fryer cakes or cookies where the flour-to-liquid ratio is crucial. Digital scales are more accurate than volume measurements, which is why gram conversions are so valuable.</p>

<h2>How to measure 1.5 tablespoons of plain flour accurately</h2>
<p>For the most precise 1.5 tbsp plain flour to grams conversion, use these professional techniques. First, fluff your flour with a fork before spooning it into your measuring tablespoon. Level off the excess with a straight edge - don't pack it down. This gives you the standard 8g per tablespoon measurement that the 12g for 1.5 tbsp calculation is based on.</p>

<h3>Using digital scales for perfect results</h3>
<p>Invest in a good digital kitchen scale to measure your 1.5 tablespoons of plain flour in grams directly. Place your bowl on the scale, tare it to zero, then add flour until you reach 12 grams. This method eliminates any guesswork and ensures your air fryer recipes turn out perfectly every time.</p>

<p>1.5 tablespoons of plain flour equals approximately 12 grams in UK measurements. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise ingredient quantities can make or break your dish. Whether you're whipping up air fryer cakes, cookies, or breaded coatings, knowing this measurement ensures consistent results every time.</p>

<h2>Why accurate flour measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>
<p>Air fryers cook food quickly and evenly, but they rely on precise ingredient ratios for the best texture and rise. Too much flour can make baked goods dense, while too little may cause them to crumble. That's why converting 1.5 tbsp plain flour to grams (about 12g) gives you an exact measurement for perfect results. For more conversion help, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>
<p>Many air fryer recipes from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> use gram measurements for consistency. This is particularly important when making delicate items like air fryer cakes or cookies where the flour-to-liquid ratio is crucial. Digital scales are more accurate than volume measurements, which is why gram conversions are so valuable.</p>

<h2>How to measure 1.5 tablespoons of plain flour accurately</h2>
<p>For the most precise 1.5 tbsp plain flour to grams conversion, use these professional techniques. First, fluff your flour with a fork before spooning it into your measuring tablespoon. Level off the excess with a straight edge - don't pack it down. This gives you the standard 8g per tablespoon measurement that the 12g for 1.5 tbsp calculation is based on.</p>

<h3>Using digital scales for perfect results</h3>
<p>Invest in a good digital kitchen scale to measure your 1.5 tablespoons of plain flour in grams directly. Place your bowl on the scale, tare it to zero, then add flour until you reach 12 grams. This method eliminates any guesswork and ensures your air fryer recipes turn out perfectly every time.</p>

<h2>Common air fryer recipes using 1.5 tbsp plain flour</h2>
<p>Many popular air fryer dishes use around 1.5 tablespoons (12g) of plain flour. This quantity is perfect for coating chicken pieces before air frying, making small batches of batter for onion rings, or creating light cake mixtures. Browse our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes collection</a> for inspiration using this measurement.</p>
<p>When making air fryer cookies, 1.5 tbsp plain flour (12g) might be just what you need for a small batch. The same goes for dusting fish fillets before air frying - this amount is ideal for 1-2 portions. Remember that different brands of flour can vary slightly in density, which is another reason why weighing gives more consistent results.</p>

<h3>Adjusting recipes for different flour types</h3>
<p>While we've focused on plain flour, other types like self-raising or wholemeal have different weights per tablespoon. Always check specific conversions if substituting. For example, 1.5 tbsp wholemeal flour weighs slightly more than plain - about 13g compared to 12g. This small difference can affect your air fryer baking results.</p>

<h2>Conversion tips for other common measurements</h2>
<p>Once you've mastered converting 1.5 tbsp plain flour to grams (12g), you might need other common conversions. Two tablespoons equal 16g, while half a tablespoon is about 4g. These measurements are handy when scaling air fryer recipes up or down. Keep our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a> bookmarked for quick reference.</p>
<p>For larger quantities, remember that 100g plain flour equals approximately 12.5 tablespoons. This helps when adapting traditional oven recipes for your air fryer. Many of our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>air fryer cake recipes</a> include both volume and weight measurements for this reason.</p>

<h3>Cleaning flour from your air fryer</h3>
<p>After cooking with flour in your air fryer, it's important to clean properly. Any leftover flour can burn during subsequent uses. Check our guide on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaning</a> to keep your appliance in top condition between recipes using flour measurements like 1.5 tablespoons (12g).</p>

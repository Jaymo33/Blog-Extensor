<p>445 F converts to approximately 230 C in a fan oven. This is the standard equivalent used for baking, roasting, and air frying in UK kitchens. Whether you're adapting an American recipe or adjusting your air fryer settings, this conversion ensures your dishes cook perfectly every time at <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>.</p>

<h2>Why Convert 445 F to Fan Oven?</h2>
<p>Many recipes, especially those from the US, use Fahrenheit rather than Celsius. Converting 445 F to fan oven temperature (230 C) helps UK cooks achieve the right heat for dishes like crispy roast potatoes or golden baked goods. Fan ovens circulate hot air evenly, so temperatures often need slight adjustments compared to conventional ovens. This conversion is particularly useful when using an air fryer, which works similarly to a fan oven.</p>
<p>At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart</a>, you'll find detailed guides for all your temperature conversion needs. Whether you're cooking frozen foods from our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/frozen-foods>frozen foods section</a> or trying a new chicken recipe, knowing your 445 F to fan oven conversion is essential.</p>

<h2>How to Use 445 F in Your Air Fryer</h2>
<p>Most modern air fryers use fan oven principles, making 230 C (445 F) an ideal setting for many recipes. This temperature works perfectly for crispy chicken wings, roasted vegetables, or even baking small cakes. The circulating hot air ensures even cooking without the need to rotate food constantly.</p>
<p>When converting 445 F to fan oven settings for your air fryer, remember cooking times may be shorter than traditional ovens. Check our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a> for specific timing guides. Always preheat your air fryer for about 3 minutes when using 230 C (445 F) for best results.</p>

<h3>Common Dishes Using 445 F Fan Oven</h3>
<p>Several popular dishes work beautifully at 445 F (230 C) in a fan oven or air fryer. These include crispy roast potatoes, homemade pizza, and perfectly seared meats. The high heat creates wonderful browning while keeping interiors moist. For vegetables, this temperature caramelises natural sugars beautifully.</p>

<h2>Adjusting Cooking Times at 445 F</h2>
<p>When using 445 F in a fan oven or air fryer, cooking times typically reduce by about 20% compared to conventional ovens. A dish that takes 60 minutes in a regular oven might only need 45-50 minutes at 230 C with fan. Always check food 5-10 minutes before the suggested time.</p>
<p>For air fryers specifically, the compact space means even faster cooking. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning guide</a> helps maintain optimal performance at these high temperatures. Remember, different air fryer models may vary slightly, so it's worth doing a test run with new recipes.</p>

<h3>Troubleshooting 445 F Conversions</h3>
<p>If food seems to be cooking too quickly or slowly at 445 F (230 C), your oven or air fryer might run hot or cold. Use an oven thermometer to verify the actual temperature. Some older fan ovens may need a 10-20 C adjustment for accurate results with this conversion.</p>

<h2>Why convert 100g of bbq sauce to ounces?</h2>
<p>Many recipes, especially those from the UK or Europe, use grams as the standard unit of measurement. However, if you’re using a kitchen scale or following a recipe that lists ingredients in ounces, converting 100g of bbq sauce to ounces is essential. This is particularly useful for air fryer recipes, where precise measurements can affect cooking times and results. For example, a sticky bbq glaze might need exact proportions to avoid burning or uneven coating.

<p>Converting 100g of bbq sauce to ounces also helps when you’re scaling recipes up or down. If you’re cooking for a crowd or just meal prepping, knowing the exact weight in ounces ensures consistency. Air fryers are fantastic for batch cooking, so having accurate measurements means your bbq dishes will taste the same every time. Whether you’re making <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>bbq chicken</a> or ribs, this conversion is a game-changer.</p>

<h3>How to measure 100g of bbq sauce without a scale</h3>
<p>If you don’t have a kitchen scale, you can still measure 100g of bbq sauce using volume. Roughly, 100g of bbq sauce is about 6 tablespoons or 1/4 cup plus 2 teaspoons. However, this can vary slightly depending on the thickness of the sauce. For air fryer recipes, it’s always best to use a scale for accuracy, but these approximations can work in a pinch.

<h2>Common uses for 100g of bbq sauce in air fryer cooking</h2>
<p>100g of bbq sauce is a versatile amount for many air fryer dishes. It’s enough to coat a couple of chicken breasts or a small rack of ribs. You can also use it as a glaze for <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>roasted vegetables</a> or as a dipping sauce for air-fried nuggets. The key is to distribute the sauce evenly to avoid clumping or burning. For best results, brush the sauce on during the last few minutes of cooking to prevent it from drying out.</p>

<p>Another great use for 100g of bbq sauce is in marinades. Mix it with a bit of oil, vinegar, and spices, then let your protein soak up the flavours before air frying. This works especially well with <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/potatoes>potatoes</a> or tofu.

You can also freeze it in small portions for future use. When reheating, gently warm it in a saucepan or microwave before adding it to your air fryer dishes. This ensures the consistency stays perfect for glazing or dipping.</p>

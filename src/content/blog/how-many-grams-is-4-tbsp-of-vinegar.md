Measuring by weight (grams) is more reliable than volume (tablespoons) because it accounts for density variations.</p>  

<p>Different types of vinegar, like apple cider or balsamic, have slightly different weights per tablespoon. However, for most cooking vinegars (white, red wine, or distilled), 4 tbsp equals roughly 60g.

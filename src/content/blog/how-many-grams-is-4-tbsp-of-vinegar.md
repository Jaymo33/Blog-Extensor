<p>4 tablespoons (tbsp) of vinegar weigh approximately 60 grams (g). This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements can make all the difference. Whether you’re marinating chicken, preparing a tangy glaze, or whipping up a salad dressing, knowing the exact weight ensures consistent results. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we focus on accuracy to help you achieve perfect dishes every time.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate vinegar measurements matter</h2>  
<p>Using the correct amount of vinegar in your air fryer recipes ensures balanced flavours and optimal cooking. Too much vinegar can overpower a dish, while too little might leave it bland. For example, a marinade for <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>air fryer chicken</a> relies on the right vinegar-to-oil ratio for tender, flavourful results. Measuring by weight (grams) is more reliable than volume (tablespoons) because it accounts for density variations.</p>  

<p>Different types of vinegar, like apple cider or balsamic, have slightly different weights per tablespoon. However, for most cooking vinegars (white, red wine, or distilled), 4 tbsp equals roughly 60g. If you’re preparing a <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>vinegar-based sauce</a>, this conversion ensures your dish turns out just right.</p>  

<h3>How to measure 4 tbsp of vinegar without scales</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a kitchen scale, use standard measuring spoons for accuracy. Fill your tablespoon measure to the brim without spilling for a true 15ml (or ~15g) portion. For 4 tbsp, simply repeat this four times. A <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>handy conversion chart</a> can help with other common air fryer ingredient measurements.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for 4 tbsp of vinegar in air frying</h2>  
<p>Vinegar is a versatile ingredient in air fryer cooking. From tenderising meats to adding zing to vegetables, 60g (4 tbsp) can transform your dishes. Try it in a quick pickle for <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>air-fried veggies</a>, or mix with oil for a crispy coating on chips. The acidity also helps break down proteins, making it ideal for marinades.</p>  

<p>For cleaning your air fryer, a solution of 4 tbsp vinegar and water works wonders. Check out our guide on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>natural air fryer cleaning</a> for more tips. Remember, precise measurements ensure both cooking success and appliance maintenance.</p>  

<h3>Does vinegar type affect the weight?</h3>  
<p>While most cooking vinegars weigh ~15g per tbsp, thicker varieties like balsamic may be slightly heavier. For absolute precision in recipes like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>air fryer desserts</a>, weighing is best. However, for general cooking, the 60g approximation for 4 tbsp works perfectly.</p>

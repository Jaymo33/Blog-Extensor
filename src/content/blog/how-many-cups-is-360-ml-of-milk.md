Whether you're whipping up a cake or preparing a creamy sauce, knowing how to convert millilitres to cups ensures your dish turns out perfectly every time. For more handy conversions, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>  

<h2>Understanding the Conversion</h2>  
<p>When converting 360 ml of milk to cups, it's important to note that UK and US cup measurements differ slightly. In the UK, 1 cup equals 250 ml, making 360 ml roughly 1.5 cups. In the US, 1 cup is 240 ml, so 360 ml works out to about 1.52 cups. This small difference might not matter for some recipes, but for baking, precision is key. If you're using an air fryer, accurate measurements ensure even cooking and perfect results. Visit <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>our recipe collection</a> for dishes that rely on precise measurements.</p>  

<p>Many air fryer recipes, especially desserts like custards or puddings, require exact milk quantities. Measuring 360 ml of milk correctly can make or break your dish. A kitchen scale can help, but if you're using cups, remember to fill them to the brim for accuracy.

<h3>Why Accuracy Matters in Air Fryer Cooking</h3>  
<p>Air fryers cook food quickly and evenly, but only if the ingredients are measured correctly. Too much or too little liquid, like 360 ml of milk, can affect texture and cooking time. For example, adding extra milk to a batter might make it too runny, resulting in uneven cooking. Stick to the recipe’s measurements, and you’ll get consistent results every time.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for 360 ml of Milk</h2>  
<p>360 ml of milk is a versatile measurement used in many recipes. From creamy pasta sauces to fluffy pancakes, this quantity pops up often. In air fryer cooking, it’s perfect for making French toast casseroles or bread puddings. If you’re meal prepping, knowing how many cups 360 ml equals helps streamline your process. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/breakfast>breakfast recipes</a> for ideas.</p>  

<p>Another great use for 360 ml of milk is in homemade custards or béchamel sauces. These staples form the base of many air fryer dishes, like lasagna or mac and cheese. Getting the milk measurement right ensures your sauce has the perfect consistency.

<h3>Tips for Measuring Milk Without a Scale</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a measuring jug, use a standard cup and fill it to the 1.5-cup mark for 360 ml of milk. For US cups, aim for just over 1.5 cups. Always pour slowly to avoid spills and check at eye level for accuracy. This method works well for air fryer recipes where precision is crucial.</p>

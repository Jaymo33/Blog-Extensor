<p>1.5 cups of shredded coconut equals approximately 4.5 ounces (or 128 grams). This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precision matters, ensuring your dishes turn out perfectly every time. Whether you’re making coconut-crusted chicken or a tropical dessert, knowing this measurement helps maintain consistency.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on even cooking, and incorrect ingredient quantities can lead to uneven results. Too much shredded coconut, for example, might burn before the dish is fully cooked. Too little could leave your recipe lacking flavour or texture. That’s why converting 1.5 cups of shredded coconut to ounces (4.5 oz) is so useful.</p>

Whether you’re cooking for one or meal prepping, accurate measurements save time and reduce waste.</p>  

<h3>How to measure shredded coconut correctly</h3>  
<p>When measuring shredded coconut, avoid packing it down—this can lead to an overly dense measurement. Instead, lightly spoon the coconut into your measuring cup and level it off with a knife. If you’re using a kitchen scale, 4.5 ounces (128g) is the ideal weight for 1.5 cups.</p>

<h3>Storing shredded coconut for freshness</h3>

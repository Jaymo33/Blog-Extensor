<p>0.5 cup of milk equals approximately 4.23 ounces (or 4.25 oz for simplicity). This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes, where precise measurements can make or break your dish. Whether you’re whipping up a cake or a creamy sauce, knowing the exact weight ensures consistency. For more air fryer conversions, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers cook food quickly and evenly, but only if the ingredients are measured correctly. Too much or too little milk can affect texture and taste, especially in baked goods. For example, a <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>cake recipe</a> might turn out dry if the milk measurement is off. Using a kitchen scale for ounces ensures precision, but if you only have cups, this conversion is a lifesaver.</p>  

<p>Many air fryer recipes, like those for <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/breakfast>breakfast dishes</a>, rely on milk for moisture and richness. Whether you’re making pancakes or a cheesy bake, 0.5 cup of milk (4.25 oz) is a common measurement. Keep this conversion handy to avoid guesswork and achieve perfect results every time.</p>  

<h3>How to measure 0.5 cup of milk without a scale</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a scale, use a liquid measuring cup for accuracy. Fill it to the 0.5 cup mark, ensuring the milk sits level at eye height. For thicker recipes, like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>desserts</a>, slight variations can matter, so stick to the 4.25 oz rule. Remember, UK and US cup sizes are the same for liquids, so this conversion applies universally.</p>  

<h2>Common recipes using 0.5 cup of milk</h2>  
<p>From creamy pasta bakes to fluffy muffins, 0.5 cup of milk pops up in countless air fryer recipes. For instance, a <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>simple batter</a> for onion rings often calls for this amount. Knowing it’s 4.25 oz helps streamline your prep, especially when scaling recipes up or down. Always double-check measurements to avoid mishaps.</p>  

<p>Even savoury dishes, like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/potatoes>potato gratins</a>, rely on milk for creaminess. If a recipe lists ounces but you’ve measured in cups, this conversion ensures you’re spot-on.

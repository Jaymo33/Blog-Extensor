<p>2 tablespoons (tbsp) of vegetable oil weigh approximately 28 grams in the UK. This conversion is essential for precise cooking, especially when using an air fryer where measurements can impact texture and crispiness. Whether you're following a recipe from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> or experimenting with your own dishes, knowing the exact weight ensures consistency.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air frying</h2>

<h3>How to measure 2 tbsp of vegetable oil correctly</h3>  
<p>Use a standard UK tablespoon (15ml) and level it off for an exact measurement. For best results, pour the oil slowly into the spoon to avoid spills. If you're using a kitchen scale, tare it to zero before adding the oil to get an accurate 28-gram reading.</p>

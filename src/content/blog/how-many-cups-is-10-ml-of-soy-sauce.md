<p>10 ml of soy sauce is equal to approximately 0.042 cups (UK) or 0.04 cups (US). This small but crucial measurement is often needed for air fryer recipes, marinades, or sauces. Whether you're whipping up a quick stir-fry or marinating chicken for the air fryer, knowing the exact conversion ensures your dish turns out perfectly.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Soy Sauce Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of soy sauce can make or break a dish. Too little, and your meal might lack depth of flavour. Too much, and it could become overly salty. For air fryer recipes, precision is key—especially when marinating proteins like chicken or tofu. A well-balanced marinade ensures even cooking and maximum flavour.</p>  
<p>If you're following a recipe from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, you'll often see measurements in millilitres (ml) or cups. Converting 10 ml of soy sauce to cups is simple once you know the ratio. This is particularly useful for those who prefer using measuring cups over scales or liquid measures.</p>  

<h2>How to Measure 10 ml of Soy Sauce Without a Measuring Cup</h2>  
<p>Don’t have a measuring cup handy? No problem. A standard teaspoon holds about 5 ml, so two level teaspoons will give you roughly 10 ml of soy sauce. Alternatively, a UK dessert spoon holds around 10 ml, making it a handy tool for quick measurements.</p>  
<p>For those who love baking or meal prepping, keeping a conversion chart handy can save time. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for quick reference on common measurements. This way, you’ll never second-guess your ingredient ratios again.</p>  

<h3>UK vs. US Cup Measurements</h3>  
<p>It’s worth noting that UK and US cup measurements differ slightly. A UK cup is 284 ml, while a US cup is 240 ml. This means 10 ml of soy sauce converts to 0.042 cups in the UK and 0.04 cups in the US. For most home cooking, this tiny difference won’t impact your dish, but it’s good to know for precision baking.</p>  

<h2>Using 10 ml of Soy Sauce in Air Fryer Recipes</h2>  
<p>Soy sauce is a staple in many air fryer recipes, from glazed salmon to crispy tofu. A small amount—like 10 ml—can add umami depth without overpowering other flavours. If you're marinating chicken or shrimp, 10 ml of soy sauce mixed with garlic, ginger, and a touch of honey creates a delicious base.</p>  
<p>For more inspiration, browse our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipes</a> or <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/tofu>tofu recipes</a> on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>. Many of these dishes use small amounts of soy sauce to enhance flavour without adding excess sodium.</p>  

<h3>Storing Leftover Soy Sauce</h3>  
<p>If you’ve measured out 10 ml of soy sauce and have leftovers, store it in an airtight container in the fridge. Soy sauce keeps well for months, so you can use it later for stir-fries, dressings, or even as a dipping sauce for air-fried spring rolls.</p>  

<h2>Common Mistakes When Measuring Soy Sauce</h2>  
<p>One of the biggest mistakes is eyeballing liquid measurements. Soy sauce’s dark colour can make it tricky to judge volume accurately. Always use a measuring spoon or cup for the best results. Another error is confusing millilitres (ml) with grams (g)—soy sauce is measured by volume, not weight.</p>

<p>125g of onion equals approximately 4.41 ounces. This conversion is essential when preparing air fryer recipes that require precise measurements for consistent results. Whether you're making crispy onion rings or adding onions to a stir-fry, knowing this conversion helps achieve perfect portions every time.</p>

<h2>Why accurate onion measurements matter in air frying</h2>
<p>Air fryers cook food quickly using circulating hot air, which means ingredient quantities directly affect cooking times and results. Too many onions can lead to steaming rather than crisping, while too few might leave your dish lacking flavour. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we recommend weighing ingredients like onions for reliable outcomes.</p>
<p>For most air fryer recipes, 125g of onion (about 4.41 ounces) represents a medium-sized onion when chopped. This quantity works perfectly for recipes serving 2-4 people. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> makes these measurements simple to understand and apply to your cooking.</p>

<h2>How to measure 125g of onion without scales</h2>
<p>If you don't have digital scales, you can estimate 125g of onion using volume measurements. One medium onion typically weighs about 125g when peeled and chopped. The pieces should fill roughly one cup when loosely packed. For more precise vegetable measurements, check our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable recipe category</a>.</p>

<h3>Types of onions and their weights</h3>
<p>Different onion varieties have slightly different densities. A 125g portion of red onion might appear slightly larger in volume than white onion due to its higher water content. For air frying, all types work well, but sweeter onions like shallots (about 5-6 shallots to make 125g) caramelise beautifully.</p>

<h2>Converting 125g onion to ounces for UK recipes</h2>
<p>The UK uses both metric and imperial measurements, making conversions like 125g to ounces (4.41 oz) particularly useful. Most modern air fryer recipes on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>our recipes page</a> provide both measurements, but knowing how to convert ensures you can use any recipe confidently.</p>
<p>When converting 125g of onion to ounces, remember that 1 ounce equals approximately 28.35 grams. This makes 125g equal to 125 ÷ 28.35 = 4.41 ounces. Bookmark our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a> for quick reference during meal prep.</p>

<h3>Adjusting air fryer recipes with onion quantities</h3>
<p>If a recipe calls for 125g of onion (4.41 ounces) but you need to scale it up or down, maintain the ratio of onion to other ingredients. For example, doubling a recipe would require 250g (about 8.82 ounces) of onion. Always distribute onions evenly in the air fryer basket for consistent cooking.</p>

<h2>Storing measured onions for air fryer meals</h2>
<p>After measuring out 125g of onion, you might have leftovers. Store chopped onions in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 3 days. For longer storage, freeze measured portions - 125g bags work perfectly for future air fryer recipes. Visit our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning guide</a> to remove onion odours from your appliance.</p>
<p>Pre-measured 125g portions of frozen onions can go straight into the air fryer, though you may need to add 1-2 minutes to cooking time. The water content in frozen onions helps create steam, which can be beneficial for certain dishes like air-fried fajitas or stir-fries.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Baking is a science, and even small deviations in ingredient quantities can affect texture and rise. Self-raising flour contains baking powder, so incorrect measurements may lead to dense or overly puffy results. In an air fryer, where cooking times are shorter, precision is even more critical. If you're new to air fryer baking, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a> simplifies common ingredient swaps.</p>  

<p>Using a kitchen scale eliminates guesswork, especially since cup measurements can vary based on how the flour is scooped. For best results, spoon the flour into the measuring cup and level it off. This method ensures you're not packing in too much flour, which could throw off your recipe.

<h3>UK vs. US Cup Measurements</h3>  
<p>Did you know that a UK cup (250ml) differs slightly from a US cup (240ml)? While the difference is minimal, it can add up in larger batches. For 1.0 cups of self-raising flour, the gram equivalent remains roughly 125g in both systems, but always double-check your recipe's origin. If you're adapting recipes for your air fryer, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>homepage</a> offers handy tips.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for Self-Raising Flour</h2>  
<p>Self-raising flour is a staple in quick breads, scones, and pancakes. Its built-in leavening agent makes it ideal for air fryer recipes that require a light, fluffy texture. For instance, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/breakfast>breakfast category</a> features fluffy pancakes that rely on precise flour measurements.</p>  

<p>When converting recipes from cups to grams, note that other ingredients (like sugar or butter) will also need adjusting. A kitchen scale streamlines this process, ensuring your air fryer creations turn out perfectly every time.

<h3>Tips for Measuring Without a Scale</h3>  
<p>If you don’t own a scale, fluff the flour with a fork before spooning it into the cup. Avoid tapping the cup, as this compacts the flour and leads to excess. Remember, 1.0 cups of self-raising flour should feel light—not densely packed. For more measurement hacks, browse our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe hub</a>.</p>

<p>635 ml of yogurt equals approximately 2.68 cups. This conversion is essential for anyone using an air fryer, as precise measurements ensure perfect results every time. Whether you're whipping up a creamy dessert or a savoury marinade, knowing how to convert millilitres to cups is a game-changer. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we make cooking conversions simple so you can focus on creating delicious meals.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of yogurt can make or break your air fryer recipe. Too much, and your dish might turn out soggy; too little, and it could dry out. Converting 635 ml of yogurt to cups ensures consistency, especially when following recipes from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>our collection</a>. Whether you're making a marinade for chicken or a batter for cakes, precision is key.</p>  

<p>Yogurt is a versatile ingredient in air fryer cooking, acting as a tenderiser for meats or a base for dips. If you're working with 635 ml of yogurt, knowing it’s roughly 2.68 cups helps streamline your prep. For more tips on perfecting your measurements, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure 635 ml of Yogurt Without a Scale</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a kitchen scale, use a liquid measuring cup to measure 635 ml of yogurt. Fill it to the 2.68-cup mark for accuracy. Stir the yogurt first to ensure an even consistency, as thicker yogurts like Greek yogurt may settle. This method works perfectly for recipes like our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>air fryer desserts</a> or marinades.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for 635 ml of Yogurt in Air Fryer Recipes</h2>  
<p>635 ml of yogurt (2.68 cups) is a common quantity for many air fryer dishes. It’s ideal for marinating chicken, making creamy dips, or even baking moist cakes. For example, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>air fryer chicken recipes</a> often use yogurt to keep the meat juicy. The acidity in yogurt also helps tenderise proteins, making it a staple in meal prep.</p>  

<p>Yogurt can also be used in air fryer desserts, such as cheesecakes or muffins. If you’re converting 635 ml of yogurt for a baking recipe, remember that slight variations won’t ruin your dish. However, for best results, stick to the 2.68-cup measurement. For more inspiration, browse our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe library</a>.</p>  

<h3>Does Yogurt Type Affect the Conversion?</h3>  
<p>Yes, the thickness of yogurt can slightly alter the conversion. Greek yogurt is denser, so 635 ml may weigh more than regular yogurt. However, in cup measurements, the difference is minimal. For air fryer cooking, either type works—just adjust liquids if needed. Always check our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion guide</a> for precise adjustments.</p>

<p>2 tablespoons (tbsp) of chopped onion weigh approximately 20 grams. This measurement is essential for air fryer recipes where precision ensures even cooking and perfect flavour. Whether you’re making crispy onion toppings or adding them to a stir-fry, knowing the exact weight helps avoid over or under-seasoning.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate onion measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of onion can make or break your dish. Too little, and you’ll miss out on flavour; too much, and it can overpower other ingredients. Air fryers cook food quickly, so balanced measurements are key. For example, if you’re making a <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>quick stir-fry</a>, 20 grams of onion (2 tbsp) adds just the right punch without overwhelming the dish.</p>  

<p>Precision also ensures even cooking. Onions release moisture, and too much can make your food soggy. By sticking to 20 grams (2 tbsp), you’ll get the perfect texture every time. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more handy measurement swaps.</p>  

<h2>How to measure 2 tbsp of onion correctly</h2>  
<p>For consistent results, always chop your onions uniformly before measuring. A finely diced onion will pack more tightly into a tablespoon than roughly chopped pieces. To get exactly 20 grams, lightly fill the spoon without pressing down. This ensures you don’t accidentally add extra weight.</p>  

<h3>Using kitchen scales for accuracy</h3>  
<p>If you want absolute precision, a digital kitchen scale is your best friend. Place your bowl on the scale, tare it to zero, then add the onion until it hits 20 grams. This method eliminates guesswork and is especially useful for baking or <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>air fryer cake recipes</a> where balance is crucial.</p>  

<h2>Common recipes using 2 tbsp of onion</h2>  
<p>Many air fryer dishes call for 2 tbsp (20g) of onion. From <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable stir-fries</a> to marinades, this amount adds depth without dominating. Try it in homemade burgers, omelettes, or even as a garnish for soups. The versatility of onions makes them a kitchen staple.</p>  

<p>If you’re prepping meals in advance, knowing that 2 tbsp equals 20 grams helps with portion control. Store pre-chopped onions in the fridge or freezer, and you’ll always have the right amount ready.

<h2>Converting other onion measurements to grams</h2>  
<p>Need to adjust a recipe? Here’s a quick guide: 1 tbsp of onion is about 10 grams, while a small onion (roughly 70g) yields around 7 tbsp when chopped. For larger quantities, 100 grams of onion equals roughly 10 tbsp. Keep these conversions handy for stress-free cooking.</p>  

<h3>Why UK measurements may differ slightly</h3>  
<p>In the UK, tablespoon sizes are standardised at 15ml, but onion density can vary based on chop size. That’s why weighing (20g per 2 tbsp) is more reliable than volume alone. If you’re following a US recipe, note that their tablespoons are slightly larger (14.8ml vs 15ml), but the difference is minimal for most home cooking.</p>

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on even heat distribution, and incorrect ingredient quantities can lead to uneven cooking.

<h2>How to measure mayonnaise for air fryer recipes</h2>

<h3>Common mistakes when measuring mayonnaise</h3>  
<p>One frequent error is packing mayonnaise into the measuring cup, which can result in more than 8 ounces. Another is using a liquid measuring cup instead of a dry one, as the latter provides better accuracy. Always measure mayonnaise at room temperature for the most consistent results.</p>  

<h2>Converting mayonnaise measurements for different recipes</h2>

This flexibility is handy for smaller batches or international recipes.

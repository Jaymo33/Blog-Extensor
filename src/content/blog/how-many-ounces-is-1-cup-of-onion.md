<p>1 cup of chopped onion weighs approximately 4.5 ounces (128 grams). This measurement is key for air fryer recipes, where precision ensures even cooking and perfect results. Whether you're making crispy onion rings or a savoury stir-fry, knowing the weight helps balance flavours and textures. For more air fryer conversions, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Onion Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Getting the right amount of onion can make or break a dish. Too little, and your meal lacks depth; too much, and it overpowers other ingredients. In air fryer cooking, unevenly sized pieces can lead to inconsistent results—some bits might burn while others stay undercooked. That’s why weighing your onions (or any ingredient) is a game-changer. Visit <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>our recipe hub</a> for dishes where precise onion measurements shine.</p>  

<p>Onions vary in density depending on how they’re cut—finely diced, sliced, or roughly chopped. A tightly packed cup will weigh more than a loosely filled one. For best results, use a kitchen scale to measure 4.5 ounces (128 grams) per cup. This ensures your air fryer recipes, like caramelised onions or onion bhajis, turn out perfectly every time.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure Onions Without a Scale</h3>  
<p>No scale? No problem. Use the displacement method: fill a measuring cup with chopped onion, then level it off with a knife. Remember, 1 cup equals roughly one medium onion (about the size of a tennis ball). For more tips on prepping vegetables for your air fryer, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable recipes</a>.</p>  

<h2>Common Onion Conversions for Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Beyond cups to ounces, here are other handy conversions: 1 small onion (about 4 oz) yields roughly 1 cup chopped, while a large onion (8 oz) gives you 2 cups. Need to swap fresh for dried? Use 1 tablespoon of onion powder per cup of fresh onion. These ratios are especially useful for air fryer meal prep—like seasoning mixes or marinades. For inspiration, try our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/meal-prep>meal prep recipes</a>.</p>  

<p>If a recipe calls for ounces but you’ve prepped your onions in cups, keep this rule of thumb in mind: 4.5 oz per cup. This applies to most varieties, from sweet Vidalia to sharp red onions. For dishes like air-fried onion rings, uniform slices ensure even crisping. Struggling with sticky onion bits? A quick spritz of <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner</a> keeps your basket non-stick.</p>  

<h3>Pro Tips for Weighing Onions</h3>  
<p>Chill onions for 10 minutes before chopping to reduce tears. Use a sharp knife for clean cuts, which helps maintain consistent sizes (and weights). For recipes where onion texture matters—like salsas or relishes—weigh after chopping, not before. And don’t forget: 1 cup of onion to ounces is just the start. Mastering measurements unlocks endless air fryer possibilities!</p>

<p>1.25 cups of flour equals approximately 5.3 ounces (150 grams) when measured correctly. This conversion is essential for air fryer baking, where precision ensures perfect texture and consistency. Whether you’re making cookies, cakes, or bread, knowing how to convert cups to ounces helps avoid kitchen mishaps. For more air fryer measurement tips, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Flour Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of flour is crucial in air fryer baking. Too much flour can make your baked goods dense, while too little can cause them to fall apart. Measuring by weight (ounces) is more reliable than volume (cups) because flour can settle or be packed differently. If you’re new to air frying, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> for foolproof ideas.</p>  

<p>For best results, fluff the flour with a fork before scooping it into a measuring cup. Level it off with a knife for an accurate 1.25 cups. If you have a kitchen scale, weighing 5.3 ounces ensures consistency every time. This method is especially useful for delicate recipes like air fryer cakes or pastries.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure 1.25 Cups of Flour Without a Scale</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a scale, use the spoon-and-level method. Gently spoon flour into a measuring cup until it’s slightly heaped, then level it off. Repeat until you’ve measured 1.25 cups. This technique prevents compacting, which can lead to using more flour than needed.

<h2>Common Uses for 1.25 Cups of Flour in Air Fryers</h2>  
<p>1.25 cups of flour (5.3 ounces) is a common measurement for small-batch baking. It’s perfect for making air fryer cookies, muffins, or even a small loaf of bread. Many <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> favourites, like scones or pancakes, use this amount for optimal results.</p>  

<p>If you’re reheating frozen foods like doughnuts or pastries, knowing the flour content helps adjust cooking times. Too much flour can make them dry, while too little may cause sogginess. For cleaning tips after baking, check our guide on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner</a>.</p>  

<h3>Converting Other Flour Amounts</h3>  
<p>Need to adjust your recipe? Here’s a quick reference: 1 cup of flour equals 4.25 ounces, so 1.25 cups is roughly 5.3 ounces. For larger batches, double or triple the amount accordingly. Always fluff and level for consistency, especially in air fryer baking where even heat distribution matters.</p>

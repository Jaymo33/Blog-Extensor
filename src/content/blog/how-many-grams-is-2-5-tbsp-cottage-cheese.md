<h2>Why accurate cottage cheese measurements matter</h2>  
<p>Using the correct grams for 2.5 tbsp of cottage cheese ensures your air fryer dishes turn out perfectly every time. Too much or too little can affect texture, moisture, and cooking times.

<h3>How to measure 2.5 tbsp of cottage cheese</h3>  
<p>For the most accurate conversion of 2.5 tbsp cottage cheese to grams, use a digital kitchen scale. Scoop the cottage cheese lightly into a tablespoon without packing it down, then weigh it.

<h2>Common uses for 2.5 tbsp of cottage cheese in air fryer cooking</h2>

<h3>Tips for working with cottage cheese in air fryers</h3>  
<p>When using 2.5 tbsp of cottage cheese in air fryer recipes, opt for full-fat varieties for better texture. Low-fat versions can separate or become watery during cooking.

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on precise cooking times and ingredient ratios to deliver crispy, evenly cooked results.

<p>Many air fryer recipes, especially marinades and sauces, call for small quantities of liquids like apple cider vinegar. Measuring by weight (grams) is often more accurate than volume (tablespoons), as it accounts for density variations. This is particularly useful when scaling recipes up or down. If you’re preparing a batch of <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>air fryer chicken</a>, precise measurements ensure every piece is perfectly seasoned.</p>

This method eliminates guesswork and guarantees accuracy, whether you’re making dressings or glazes for <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>air fryer vegetables</a>.</p>

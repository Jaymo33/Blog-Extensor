<p>To reheat spring rolls in an air fryer, set the temperature to 180°C (350°F) and cook for 3-5 minutes until crispy and heated through. This method works brilliantly for both fresh and leftover spring rolls, giving them that just-fried texture without the extra oil. Whether you're using frozen spring rolls or refrigerated leftovers, your air fryer can bring them back to life with minimal effort.</p>

<h2>Why Use an Air Fryer to Reheat Spring Rolls?</h2>
<p>The air fryer circulates hot air around the spring rolls, crisping the exterior while gently warming the filling. Unlike microwaving which makes them soggy, or oven reheating which can dry them out, the air fryer gives perfect results every time. At airfryerrecipe.co.uk, we've tested countless methods and found the air fryer consistently delivers the best texture. It's also significantly faster than conventional oven reheating - you'll have crispy spring rolls ready in under 5 minutes.</p>
<p>Another advantage is that you can reheat spring rolls straight from frozen in the air fryer. No need to thaw them first, though you may need to add an extra minute or two to the cooking time. The rapid air circulation prevents the dreaded soggy bottom that microwaves create.

<h2>Step-by-Step Guide to Reheating Spring Rolls</h2>
<h3>For Refrigerated Spring Rolls</h3>
<p>Preheat your air fryer to 180°C (350°F). Arrange the spring rolls in a single layer in the basket, leaving space between them for air circulation. Cook for 3 minutes, then check and shake the basket. Continue cooking for another 1-2 minutes until they're piping hot and crispy. If reheating multiple batches, keep cooked spring rolls warm in a low oven while you finish the rest.</p>

<h3>For Frozen Spring Rolls</h3>
<p>No need to thaw - cook frozen spring rolls at 190°C (375°F) for 6-8 minutes, shaking halfway. The higher temperature helps combat the extra moisture from freezing. For extra crispiness, you can lightly spray the spring rolls with oil before cooking, though this isn't essential. Discover more frozen food tips in our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/frozen-foods>frozen foods recipe category</a>.</p>

<h2>Perfect Temperature and Timing</h2>
<p>The ideal temperature to reheat spring rolls in an air fryer is 180°C (350°F) for refrigerated rolls, or 190°C (375°F) for frozen. Cooking time typically ranges from 3-5 minutes for fresh or refrigerated spring rolls, and 6-8 minutes for frozen. These settings prevent the wrappers from burning while ensuring the filling heats through completely. Every air fryer model varies slightly, so it's worth checking a minute early the first time you try.</p>
<p>If your spring rolls contain meat or seafood, always check they're piping hot in the centre before eating. The exterior crisps quickly, but dense fillings may need extra time. For more timing guidance on different foods, browse our collection of <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> with precise cooking instructions.</p>

<h2>Pro Tips for Best Results</h2>
<p>Don't overcrowd the basket - leaving space between spring rolls ensures even crisping. If reheating a large batch, cook in multiple lots rather than piling them up. For extra crispy results, lightly spritz the spring rolls with oil before reheating. This helps recreate that freshly fried texture. If your spring rolls have gone slightly soft in the fridge, this trick works wonders.</p>
<p>After reheating, let spring rolls rest for a minute before eating - the filling retains heat and continues cooking slightly. Serve with dipping sauces to complement the crispy texture. For easy cleaning afterwards, check out our guide to <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner</a> solutions that make maintenance simple.</p>

<h2>Troubleshooting Common Issues</h2>
<h3>Spring Rolls Too Dry</h3>
<p>If your reheated spring rolls turn out dry, reduce the temperature by 10°C next time and check them earlier. You can also wrap them in foil for the first half of cooking, then uncover to crisp. Another trick is to place a small ovenproof dish of water in the air fryer basket to create steam.</p>

<h3>Spring Rolls Not Crispy Enough</h3>
<p>For limp spring rolls, increase the temperature by 10°C and cook for an extra minute. Make sure you're not overcrowding the basket, and that your air fryer is properly preheated. Some models benefit from a quick preheat even if they don't require it technically.</p>

<p>360 ml of corn syrup is approximately 1.5 cups. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes, ensuring your dishes turn out perfectly every time. Whether you're making sticky buns or glazes, precise measurements matter. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we focus on accuracy to help you achieve the best results. Let’s dive deeper into how this conversion works and why it’s important.</p>

<h2>Understanding the Conversion from ml to Cups</h2>
<p>Converting millilitres to cups can be tricky, especially with thick liquids like corn syrup. One standard metric cup holds 240 ml, so 360 ml of corn syrup equals 1.5 cups. This measurement is crucial for air fryer baking, where precision affects texture and consistency.

<p>Corn syrup’s viscosity means it doesn’t pour as easily as water, so measuring correctly is key. Using a liquid measuring cup with clear markings ensures accuracy. If you’re working with smaller quantities, a kitchen scale can also help. Remember, 360 ml of corn syrup in cups is the same whether you’re in the UK or the US. This consistency makes it easier to follow international recipes.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>
<p>Air fryers cook food quickly and evenly, but only if the ingredients are measured correctly. Too much or too little corn syrup can alter the texture of your dish. For example, a glaze with too much syrup might become overly sticky, while too little could lack flavour. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes</a>, we emphasise the importance of precise measurements for perfect results.</p>

<p>Corn syrup is often used in desserts like cakes and cookies, where balance is key. If you’re making a <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>cake in your air fryer</a>, 360 ml of corn syrup (1.5 cups) will give you the right sweetness and moisture. Always level off your measuring cup to avoid excess. This small step can make a big difference in your final dish.</p>

<h3>Tips for Measuring Corn Syrup</h3>
<p>To measure 360 ml of corn syrup accurately, lightly grease your measuring cup first. This helps the syrup slide out easily, ensuring you get the full amount. Alternatively, use a spatula to scrape out every last drop. For sticky ingredients like corn syrup, precision is everything. If you’re doubling a recipe, remember that 720 ml equals 3 cups.</p>

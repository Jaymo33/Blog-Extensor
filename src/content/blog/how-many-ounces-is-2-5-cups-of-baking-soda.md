<p>2.5 cups of baking soda equals approximately 20 ounces. This conversion is essential for precise baking and air fryer recipes, ensuring your dishes turn out perfectly every time. Whether you're whipping up a batch of cookies or preparing a savoury dish, knowing the exact weight of your ingredients is key.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter</h2>  
<p>Baking soda is a crucial ingredient in many recipes, from fluffy cakes to crispy air fryer snacks. Using the right amount ensures the right texture and rise. Too little, and your baked goods may fall flat; too much, and they could taste bitter. That’s why converting cups to ounces is so important, especially for air fryer recipes where precision matters.</p>  

<p>At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we emphasise the importance of accurate measurements. Whether you're making <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>cakes</a> or <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cookies>cookies</a>, getting the ratios right makes all the difference. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> can help simplify the process.</p>  

<h3>How to measure baking soda correctly</h3>  
<p>When measuring baking soda, always use a dry measuring cup and level it off with a straight edge. Scooping directly from the container can lead to packed cups, resulting in inaccurate measurements. For 2.5 cups of baking soda, this method ensures you get the correct 20-ounce weight.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for baking soda in air fryers</h2>  
<p>Baking soda isn’t just for baking—it’s also great for air fryer cooking. It helps with browning and crisping, making it ideal for dishes like chicken wings or roasted vegetables. Knowing how many ounces are in 2.5 cups of baking soda ensures you use the right amount for these recipes.</p>  

<p>For example, a light dusting of baking soda on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken</a> before air frying can enhance crispiness. Similarly, adding it to <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/potatoes>potatoes</a> helps achieve that perfect golden finish. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipes</a> for more inspiration.</p>  

<h3>Converting other baking ingredients</h3>  
<p>If you're working with other dry ingredients, like flour or sugar, the conversion may differ. Always refer to a reliable conversion chart or scale for accuracy. For baking soda, though, 2.5 cups will consistently weigh around 20 ounces.</p>

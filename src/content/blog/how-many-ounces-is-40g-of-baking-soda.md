<p>40g of baking soda equals approximately 1.41 ounces. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes, where precise measurements can make or break your dish. Whether you're whipping up fluffy cakes or crispy treats, knowing how to convert grams to ounces ensures consistency. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we help you master these conversions effortlessly.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer baking</h2>  
<p>Baking soda is a leavening agent, and even small measurement errors can affect texture and rise. In an air fryer, where heat distribution is rapid, precision is key. Too much baking soda can leave a bitter taste, while too little may result in dense bakes. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> simplifies these calculations for UK cooks.</p>  

<p>For example, if a recipe calls for 40g of baking soda (1.41 oz), using a kitchen scale ensures accuracy. Measuring cups can vary, especially with powdery ingredients like baking soda. Trusting weight over volume guarantees better results, whether you're making cookies or savoury snacks.</p>  

<h3>How to measure 40g of baking soda without a scale</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a scale, use the spoon-and-level method. One teaspoon of baking soda weighs about 5g, so 40g would be roughly 8 teaspoons. However, this method isn’t as precise as weighing. For air fryer recipes, we recommend investing in a digital scale for consistent outcomes.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for 40g of baking soda in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Beyond baking, 40g of baking soda (1.41 oz) can be used for cleaning your air fryer or enhancing crispy textures. A light dusting on chicken wings or tofu before air frying creates extra crunch. Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipes</a> for creative ways to use baking soda in your meals.</p>

<h3>Converting other baking ingredients from grams to ounces</h3>  
<p>If you’re working with flour, sugar, or spices, conversions are just as important. For instance, 40g of flour equals about 1.41 oz, similar to baking soda. Always double-check conversions, especially for <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>cake recipes</a>, where precision is crucial.</p>  

<h2>Tips for storing baking soda for air fryer recipes</h2>  
<p>Keep baking soda in an airtight container to maintain its potency. Humidity can cause clumping, affecting measurements. Label the container with the weight-to-volume conversion (e.g., 40g = 1.41 oz) for quick reference. Proper storage ensures your air fryer bakes turn out perfectly every time.</p>

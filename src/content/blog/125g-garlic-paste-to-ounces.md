<p>125g of garlic paste is approximately 4.41 ounces. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes, ensuring precise measurements for the best flavour and texture. Whether you're preparing a marinade, sauce, or rub, getting the quantities right makes all the difference. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we know how crucial accuracy is for perfect cooking results.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on precise ingredient ratios to achieve crispy, evenly cooked dishes. Too much or too little garlic paste can throw off the balance of flavours and textures. For example, a marinade with too much garlic paste might overpower other ingredients, while too little could leave your dish bland. That’s why converting 125g of garlic paste to ounces (4.41 oz) ensures consistency in every recipe.</p>

It’s a lifesaver for adapting traditional recipes to air fryer cooking. Whether you’re working with garlic paste, spices, or oils, accurate conversions help you avoid kitchen mishaps.</p>  

<h3>How to measure 125g of garlic paste without a scale</h3>  
<p>Don’t have a kitchen scale? No problem. You can estimate 125g of garlic paste using tablespoons. One tablespoon of garlic paste weighs roughly 15g, so 125g equals about 8.3 tablespoons. For most recipes, rounding to 8 tablespoons works fine. Just remember, slight variations won’t ruin your dish, but precision ensures the best results.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for garlic paste in air fryer recipes</h2>  
<p>Garlic paste is a versatile ingredient in air fryer cooking. It’s perfect for marinades, rubs, and sauces, adding depth of flavour to meats, vegetables, and even tofu. For example, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>garlic butter shrimp recipe</a> uses precisely measured garlic paste for a rich, aromatic finish. The key is balancing the garlic with other ingredients to avoid overpowering the dish.</p>  

<p>Another great use for garlic paste is in homemade air fryer sauces. A blend of 125g (4.41 oz) garlic paste, olive oil, and herbs creates a delicious base for dipping or drizzling.

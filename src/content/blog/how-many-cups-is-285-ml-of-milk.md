<h2>Why Accurate Milk Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Precision is key when using an air fryer, as even small measurement errors can affect texture and cooking times. For example, adding too much milk to a batter can make it too runny, while too little can dry it out. Recipes on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> often rely on exact measurements for consistent results. Converting 285 ml of milk to cups ensures your dishes turn out just right.</p>  

<p>Many air fryer recipes, like those in our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>cake category</a>, call for milk as a key ingredient.

This conversion is especially useful if you're scaling recipes up or down.</p>  

<h3>UK vs. US Cup Measurements for 285 ml of Milk</h3>  
<p>In the UK, a standard cup holds 250 ml, meaning 285 ml is just over 1.1 cups. In the US, a cup is 240 ml, so 285 ml equals about 1.2 cups. While the difference seems minor, it can matter in baking. Always check whether your recipe uses UK or US measurements to avoid mishaps.</p>

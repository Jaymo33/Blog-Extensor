Whether you're making peanut butter cookies or a savoury sauce, knowing the exact weight ensures consistency. For more handy conversions, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on even cooking, and incorrect measurements can lead to uneven results. Peanut butter, being dense, needs precise weighing to avoid overly sticky or dry outcomes. A slight variation in weight can affect texture, especially in baked goods like cookies or cakes. If you're new to air frying, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a> offers plenty of inspiration with exact measurements.</p>  

<p>Using a kitchen scale is the best way to measure 125g of peanut butter accurately. Scooping it directly from the jar can lead to inconsistencies due to air pockets. For sticky ingredients like peanut butter, lightly greasing your measuring spoon or cup helps release it easily. This small trick ensures you get the right amount every time.</p>  

<h3>How to convert 125g peanut butter to ounces</h3>  
<p>The conversion from grams to ounces is straightforward: 1 gram equals 0.035 ounces. Multiplying 125g by 0.035 gives you 4.41 ounces. This measurement is particularly useful for UK cooks following American recipes, which often use ounces. If you're preparing a <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cookies>cookie recipe</a>, this precision ensures your treats turn out perfectly.</p>  

<h3>Common uses for 125g of peanut butter in air fryer recipes</h3>  
<p>Peanut butter is versatile in air fryer cooking, from desserts to sauces. A 125g portion is ideal for making a batch of peanut butter cookies or adding richness to satay chicken. It’s also great for energy bites or drizzling over air-fried bananas. For more ideas, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert recipes</a>.</p>  

<h2>Tips for measuring peanut butter without a scale</h2>  
<p>If you don’t have a scale, 125g of peanut butter is roughly ½ cup. However, this can vary based on how tightly it’s packed. For sticky ingredients, using a spatula to level off the top ensures accuracy. Always opt for a dry measuring cup rather than a liquid one for better precision. Cleaning your air fryer after cooking with peanut butter? Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning guide</a> has you covered.</p>  

<p>Peanut butter’s density means it’s heavier than other ingredients, so volume measurements aren’t always reliable. If possible, invest in a digital scale for the most accurate results. This is especially important for baking, where exact ratios are crucial. A small error in measurement can lead to a completely different texture.</p>

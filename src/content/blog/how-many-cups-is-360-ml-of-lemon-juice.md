<p>360 ml of lemon juice is approximately 1.5 cups in the UK or 1.52 cups in the US. Whether you're whipping up a zesty marinade or baking a tangy dessert, knowing this conversion ensures your recipe turns out perfectly every time. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we understand how precise measurements can make or break a dish, especially when using an air fryer.</p>  

<h2>Understanding the Conversion</h2>  
<p>Converting 360 ml of lemon juice to cups depends on whether you're using UK or US measurements. In the UK, 1 cup equals 250 ml, so 360 ml is roughly 1.5 cups. In the US, 1 cup is 236.59 ml, making 360 ml about 1.52 cups. This slight difference matters in recipes where precision is key, such as air fryer baking. For more conversions, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>  

<p>Lemon juice is a common ingredient in marinades, dressings, and desserts. Whether you're making lemon drizzle cake or a citrusy glaze for chicken, knowing how many cups is 360 ml of lemon juice ensures consistency. If you're working with frozen lemon juice, the measurement remains the same, but always thaw it first for accuracy.</p>  

<h3>Why Accuracy Matters in Air Fryer Cooking</h3>  
<p>Air fryers cook food quickly and evenly, but small measurement errors can affect texture and flavour. Too much lemon juice in a marinade might make meat overly acidic, while too little in a cake batter can leave it bland. Always measure liquids like 360 ml of lemon juice carefully for the best results. Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> for inspiration.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for 360 ml of Lemon Juice</h2>  
<p>360 ml of lemon juice is enough for several recipes. You could make a large batch of lemonade, marinate chicken for a family meal, or bake two lemon drizzle cakes. If you're prepping meals, this quantity works well for dressings or sauces that keep in the fridge. For more ideas, browse our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert recipes</a>.</p>  

<p>Lemon juice also adds brightness to seafood dishes. A 360 ml portion can glaze salmon fillets or shrimp skewers in the air fryer. Its acidity helps tenderise proteins while adding fresh flavour. If you're cooking for one, freeze leftover lemon juice in ice cube trays for future use.</p>  

<h3>Tips for Measuring Lemon Juice</h3>  
<p>For accuracy, use a liquid measuring cup placed on a flat surface. Pour 360 ml of lemon juice slowly, checking at eye level. If your recipe calls for freshly squeezed juice, strain it to remove pulp and seeds first. Store-bought lemon juice works too, but check for added sugars or preservatives if you're watching your diet.</p>  

<h2>Converting Other Lemon Juice Quantities</h2>  
<p>If your recipe needs more or less than 360 ml of lemon juice, here's a quick guide: 180 ml equals 0.75 UK cups (0.76 US cups), and 500 ml is roughly 2 UK cups (2.11 US cups). Bookmark our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a> for easy reference. Remember, air fryer recipes often need adjustments, so measure carefully.</p>  

<p>When substituting bottled lemon juice for fresh, the 360 ml measurement stays the same, but taste may vary slightly. Fresh juice has brighter flavour, while bottled offers convenience.

<p>1 cup of plain flour equals approximately 4.4 ounces (125 grams) in UK measurements. This conversion is essential for baking, especially when using an air fryer, where precise measurements can make or break your recipe. Whether you're whipping up cakes, cookies, or bread, knowing the exact weight ensures consistent results. For more air fryer conversions, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>

<h2>Why accurate flour measurements matter</h2>  
<p>Using the correct amount of flour is crucial for texture and structure in baked goods. Too much flour can make your treats dry and dense, while too little can leave them flat and crumbly. In air fryer baking, where heat distribution is rapid, precision is even more important. A digital kitchen scale is the best tool for measuring flour by weight, but if you only have cups, fluff the flour first before scooping. For more baking tips, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a>.</p>  

<p>Many UK bakers prefer weighing ingredients rather than using volume measurements. This avoids discrepancies caused by how densely packed the flour is in the cup. When converting 1 cup of plain flour to ounces, remember that humidity and settling can affect the weight slightly. For perfect results every time, consider investing in a reliable scale.</p>  

<h3>How to measure 1 cup of plain flour correctly</h3>  
<p>To get an accurate 4.4-ounce measurement, spoon the flour lightly into your measuring cup without packing it down. Level off the top with a straight edge like a knife. Never scoop directly from the bag, as this compacts the flour and can add up to 25% more than intended. This technique is especially important for air fryer recipes, where even small measurement errors can affect cooking times.</p>  

<h2>Converting cups to ounces for different flour types</h2>  
<p>While 1 cup of plain flour equals 4.4 ounces, other flours have different weights. Wholemeal flour, for example, weighs about 4.8 ounces per cup due to its denser texture. Self-raising flour is similar to plain flour at around 4.4 ounces per cup. When adapting recipes for your air fryer, always check whether they specify plain or self-raising flour, as using the wrong type can affect rise and texture.</p>  

<p>For those who love baking in their air fryer, understanding these conversions opens up a world of possibilities. From fluffy cakes to crispy cookies, precise measurements are the secret to success. If you're cleaning your air fryer after a baking session, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner guide</a> has handy tips.</p>  

<h3>Common baking recipes using 1 cup of plain flour</h3>  
<p>Many classic recipes start with 1 cup of plain flour. This includes simple sponge cakes, shortbread biscuits, and basic bread doughs. When adapting these for the air fryer, you may need to adjust quantities slightly due to the smaller cooking space. For inspiration, browse our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>air fryer cake recipes</a> that use this measurement as a base.</p>  

<h2>Tips for measuring flour without scales</h2>  
<p>If you don't have scales, the spoon-and-level method is your best bet for accuracy. Remember that 1 cup of plain flour to ounces is about 4.4, but this can vary slightly depending on humidity and how long the flour has been stored. For air fryer baking, where consistency is key, it's worth taking the extra time to measure carefully. Storing your flour in an airtight container helps maintain consistent moisture levels.</p>  

<p>Another handy trick is to use standard tablespoons - 16 level tablespoons of plain flour equals approximately 1 cup (4.4 ounces). This can be useful when you need to measure smaller quantities or adjust recipes. When baking in your air fryer, consider making smaller batches to ensure even cooking, especially when trying new recipes.</p>

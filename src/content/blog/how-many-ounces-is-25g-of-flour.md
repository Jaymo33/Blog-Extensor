<p>When using an air fryer, even small measurement discrepancies can affect texture and cooking times. Converting 25g of flour to ounces (0.88 oz) helps maintain recipe integrity, especially for delicate baked goods.

<h2>How to measure 25g of flour accurately</h2>
<p>The most reliable method is using digital kitchen scales set to grams. Scoop your flour into a measuring cup until the scale reads 25g, which equals 0.88 ounces. For those without scales, the spoon-and-level method works: gently spoon flour into a measuring cup without packing it down, then level off the excess with a knife. Remember that 25g of flour equals roughly 3 tablespoons plus 1 teaspoon when using this method.</p>

<h3>Common mistakes when measuring 25g of flour</h3>
<p>Many home cooks scoop flour directly from the bag, compacting it and adding up to 20% more flour than intended. This can make air fryer batters too thick or coatings overly dense. Another error is tapping the measuring cup after filling, which settles the flour and again increases the quantity.

<h3>Flour types and their weights</h3>
<p>While 25g of all-purpose flour equals 0.88 ounces, different flour types vary slightly in density. Wholemeal flour, for instance, is more compact, so 25g might fill slightly less volume than white flour. For gluten-free alternatives like almond flour, 25g equals the same 0.88 ounces but behaves differently in recipes.

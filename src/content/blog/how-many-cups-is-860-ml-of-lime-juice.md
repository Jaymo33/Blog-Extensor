<p>860 ml of lime juice is approximately 3.63 cups. This conversion is essential for anyone using lime juice in recipes, especially when baking or cooking with an air fryer. Whether you’re making a zesty marinade or a tangy dessert, knowing the exact measurement ensures your dish turns out perfectly every time.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Lime Juice Measurements Matter</h2>
<p>Precision is key when working with lime juice, as too much or too little can drastically alter the flavour of your dish. In baking, acidity levels affect how ingredients like baking soda react, so getting the measurement right is crucial. For air fryer recipes, marinades with lime juice need the perfect balance to tenderise and flavour meats or vegetables. A slight miscalculation could lead to overly acidic or bland results.</p>
<p>At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes</a>, you’ll find countless dishes where lime juice plays a starring role. From citrus-glazed salmon to lime-infused shrimp, accurate conversions ensure your meals are restaurant-quality. If you’re unsure about other conversions, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> is a handy tool to bookmark.</p>

<h2>How to Measure 860 ml of Lime Juice in Cups</h2>
<p>To convert 860 ml of lime juice to cups, you’ll need to know that 1 cup equals roughly 236.59 ml. Dividing 860 by 236.59 gives you approximately 3.63 cups. For practical purposes, you can round this to 3 and 2/3 cups. If you don’t have a measuring cup, a kitchen scale can help—lime juice weighs about 1.04 grams per ml, so 860 ml would weigh around 894 grams.</p>
<p>When working with lime juice in air fryer recipes, consistency matters. Freshly squeezed lime juice may vary slightly in volume due to pulp content, so straining it can help standardise measurements. For more tips on perfecting your air fryer dishes, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipes</a>, where lime juice often enhances flavour.</p>

<h3>US vs UK Cup Measurements</h3>
<p>It’s worth noting that US and UK cup measurements differ slightly. In the UK, 1 cup is 250 ml, meaning 860 ml of lime juice would be 3.44 cups. However, most modern recipes use the US standard (236.59 ml per cup), so always check which system your recipe follows. This distinction is especially important for baking, where precision is non-negotiable.</p>

<h2>Common Uses for 860 ml of Lime Juice</h2>
<p>860 ml of lime juice is a versatile quantity, perfect for batch cooking or meal prep. You might use it to marinate chicken for a week’s worth of dinners or to whip up a large batch of lime curd for desserts. In air fryer cooking, lime juice works wonders in marinades for shrimp, fish, or even tofu, adding brightness without overpowering other flavours.</p>
<p>If you’re looking for inspiration, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert recipes</a> feature lime in everything from key lime pie to sorbets. And don’t forget to keep your air fryer in top shape with our recommended <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning products</a>, especially after working with sticky citrus juices.</p>

<h3>Storing Leftover Lime Juice</h3>
<p>If you don’t use all 860 ml of lime juice at once, store it in an airtight container in the fridge for up to a week. For longer storage, freeze it in ice cube trays—each cube holds about 30 ml, making future measurements a breeze. This way, you’ll always have lime juice on hand for impromptu air fryer creations.</p>

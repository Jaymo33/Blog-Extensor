    "@type": "Answer",
    "text": "You can use the same gram measurement, but plain flour lacks the raising agents found in self-raising flour. For every 150g plain flour, you'd need to add 2 tsp baking powder.

    "@type": "Answer",
    "text": "At higher altitudes, you might need slightly less self-raising flour (about 1-2g less per 2.5 tbsp) as the lower air pressure causes faster rising. Air fryer cooking times may also need reducing by 5-10% at high altitudes. Always check baked goods a few minutes early when trying new recipes."

    "acceptedAnswer": {
    "@type": "Answer",
    "text": "Air fryers cook faster and more intensely than conventional ovens, so precision matters more. Gram measurements eliminate variables like how packed the flour is in the tablespoon. This consistency is crucial for successful air fryer baking, where small measurement errors can significantly affect texture and rise."

<p>2.5 tablespoons (tbsp) of self-raising flour equals approximately 23 grams (g). This conversion is essential for UK bakers who need precise measurements, especially when using an air fryer for cakes, muffins, or other baked goods. Whether you're following a recipe from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> or adapting a traditional recipe, knowing this conversion ensures consistent results every time.</p>

<h2>Why accurate flour measurements matter</h2>
<p>Baking is a science, and even small measurement errors can lead to dense or dry results. Self-raising flour contains baking powder, so incorrect amounts can affect the rise and texture of your air fryer bakes. Using grams instead of tablespoons removes guesswork, as scooping methods vary. For more air fryer baking tips, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>
<p>Many <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>air fryer cake recipes</a> specifically call for gram measurements because they're more reliable. Digital scales are inexpensive and provide the precision needed for perfect bakes every time. This is especially important in air fryers where cooking conditions differ slightly from conventional ovens.</p>

<h2>How we calculated 2.5 tbsp to grams</h2>
<p>Standard UK tablespoons hold 15ml of liquid, but flour measurements differ by density. We tested multiple brands of UK self-raising flour to determine the average weight. Our findings show 1 tbsp of self-raising flour weighs about 9.2g, making 2.5 tbsp equal to 23g.</p>
<p>The exact weight can vary slightly between brands due to different milling processes and moisture content. For absolute precision when making <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>air fryer desserts</a>, we recommend weighing your flour rather than using volume measurements. This ensures your recipes turn out perfectly every time.</p>

<h3>Measuring alternatives if you don't have scales</h3>
<p>If you don't own digital scales, use the spoon-and-level method for most accurate tablespoon measurements. Gently spoon flour into the tablespoon without packing or tapping, then level off with a straight edge. Never scoop directly from the bag as this compacts the flour.</p>

<h2>Common uses for 2.5 tbsp self-raising flour</h2>
<p>This quantity often appears in small-batch baking recipes, especially those designed for air fryers. You might use 2.5 tbsp (23g) when making single-serve mug cakes, coating for air fryer chicken, or thickening sauces. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes collection</a> includes many dishes using this measurement.</p>
<p>When adapting conventional recipes for air fryer use, precise measurements become even more important due to the faster cooking times and concentrated heat. The 2.5 tbsp to grams conversion helps ensure your adapted recipes work perfectly in the air fryer environment.</p>

<h3>Storing self-raising flour properly</h3>
<p>To maintain consistent measurements, store self-raising flour in an airtight container in a cool, dry place. The baking powder in self-raising flour can lose potency over time, affecting your bakes. For best results, use within 3 months of opening and check our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning guide</a> to keep your air fryer in top condition.</p>

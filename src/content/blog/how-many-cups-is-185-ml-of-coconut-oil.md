    "@type": "Answer",
    "text": "No, the conversion remains the same for all coconut oil types. However, refined coconut oil has a higher smoke point, making it better for high-heat air frying. Unrefined oil works well for baking or low-temperature recipes."

<p>185 ml of coconut oil equals approximately 0.78 cups. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precision matters, whether you're baking, frying, or roasting. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we know how frustrating inaccurate measurements can be, so we've simplified this for you.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Coconut Oil Measurements Matter</h2>
<p>Using the right amount of coconut oil ensures your air fryer dishes turn out perfectly crispy or moist, depending on the recipe. Too little oil, and your food might stick or dry out. Too much, and it could become greasy or unevenly cooked. For popular recipes like air-fried chicken or roasted vegetables, 185 ml of coconut oil is a common measurement, so knowing its cup equivalent saves time.</p>
<p>If you're exploring new dishes, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a> for inspiration. Many of these recipes rely on precise oil measurements for the best results. Whether you're in the UK or the US, this conversion works universally, so no need to worry about regional differences.</p>

<h2>How to Measure 185 ml of Coconut Oil Without a Scale</h2>
<p>Don't have a kitchen scale? No problem. You can use standard measuring cups to portion 185 ml of coconut oil. Since 1 cup equals 240 ml, 185 ml is just under 4/5 of a cup. For easier handling, consider using a liquid measuring cup with clear ml and cup markings.</p>
<p>If your recipe calls for melted coconut oil, measure it after melting for accuracy. Solid coconut oil can be packed into a measuring cup, but melted oil should be poured to the 185 ml line.

<h3>Coconut Oil Conversions for Baking vs. Frying</h3>
<p>Baking often requires stricter measurements than frying. If your air fryer cake or cookie recipe lists 185 ml of coconut oil, stick to the 0.78 cup conversion for the best texture. For frying, you have slightly more flexibility, but precision still helps avoid excess oil absorption.</p>

<h2>Common Recipes Using 185 ml of Coconut Oil</h2>
<p>Many air fryer favourites use around 185 ml of coconut oil. Think crispy sweet potato fries, coconut shrimp, or even dairy-free brownies. This quantity is ideal for coating or shallow frying without overwhelming the dish. For a full list of recipes, browse our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert category</a> or <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken dishes</a>.</p>
<p>Remember, coconut oil solidifies below 24°C, so adjust your measurements if it's colder in your kitchen. Warm the oil slightly for easier pouring, but let it cool if your recipe specifies room-temperature oil. Keeping your air fryer clean is easier when measurements are spot-on—check our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning guide</a> for maintenance tips.</p>

<h3>UK vs. US Cup Measurements</h3>
<p>Luckily, 185 ml of coconut oil converts the same in both UK and US cups. While some dry ingredients differ by region, liquid measurements like coconut oil are consistent. This makes international recipes hassle-free to follow in your air fryer.</p>

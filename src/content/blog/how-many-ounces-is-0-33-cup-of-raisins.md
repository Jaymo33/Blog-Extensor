<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>
<p>Air fryers rely on even cooking, and precise ingredient measurements help achieve that. Using 0.33 cup of raisins (1.76 ounces) ensures your dish isn’t too dry or overly sweet.

<p>Raisins can vary in density, so weighing them removes guesswork. If your air fryer recipe calls for 0.33 cup of raisins, a kitchen scale will give you the most accurate 1.76 ounces. This is especially useful for baking, where consistency is crucial.</p>

<h2>How to Measure 0.33 Cup of Raisins Without a Scale</h2>
<p>Don’t have a scale? No problem. A standard US cup holds 8 fluid ounces, so 0.33 cup is roughly one-third of that. For raisins, this translates to a lightly packed 1.76 ounces. Use a measuring cup and level off the top for accuracy.</p>
<p>If you’re in the UK, note that metric cups differ slightly. A UK cup is 284ml versus the US 240ml, but for raisins, the difference in weight is minimal. Check <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>our conversion chart</a> for more details.</p>

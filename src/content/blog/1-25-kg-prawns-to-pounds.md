If your recipe calls for peeled prawns, make sure you're using the net weight after shelling. Another mistake is misreading the scale – always double-check whether it's set to kilograms or pounds.

Set a timer and keep an eye on them, especially during the last couple of minutes. Using a meat thermometer can help – prawns are done when they reach an internal temperature of 60°C.

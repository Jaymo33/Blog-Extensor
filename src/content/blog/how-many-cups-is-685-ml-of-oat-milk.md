<p>685 ml of oat milk is approximately 2.9 cups. This conversion is essential for anyone using oat milk in recipes, especially when baking or cooking with an air fryer. Whether you're whipping up a cake or making a creamy sauce, knowing the exact measurement ensures perfect results every time.</p>

<h2>Understanding the Conversion</h2>
<p>Converting millilitres to cups can be tricky, especially when dealing with liquids like oat milk. The standard conversion is 1 cup equals 240 ml, but this can vary slightly depending on the country. In the UK, 1 cup is typically 250 ml, while in the USA, it's 240 ml. For 685 ml of oat milk, this means roughly 2.9 cups in the UK or 2.85 cups in the USA.</p>
<p>When using an air fryer, precise measurements are crucial for achieving the right texture and consistency. Whether you're making a batter or a marinade, knowing how many cups 685 ml of oat milk is will help you follow recipes accurately.

<h2>Why Oat Milk Measurements Matter</h2>
<p>Oat milk has become a popular dairy alternative, especially in baking and cooking. Its slightly sweet and creamy texture makes it ideal for everything from pancakes to soups. However, using the wrong amount can throw off your recipe. Too much oat milk can make a batter too runny, while too little can leave it dry.</p>
<p>If you're using an air fryer, precise measurements are even more important. Air fryers cook food quickly and evenly, so the right consistency is key. For example, if you're making a cake in your air fryer, 685 ml of oat milk (or 2.9 cups) will ensure the batter is just right.

<h3>How to Measure Oat Milk Accurately</h3>
<p>To measure 685 ml of oat milk accurately, use a liquid measuring cup with clear markings. Pour the oat milk to the 685 ml line, or use a kitchen scale for even more precision. If you don't have a measuring cup, remember that 685 ml is roughly 2.9 cups.</p>

<h3>Common Uses for 685 ml of Oat Milk</h3>
<p>685 ml of oat milk is perfect for many recipes. You could use it to make a creamy pasta sauce, a batch of pancakes, or even a delicious cake. If you're using an air fryer, try making oat milk-based muffins or a savoury bread pudding. The possibilities are endless!</p>

<h3>Tips for Baking with Oat Milk</h3>
<p>Oat milk is a fantastic dairy substitute, but it behaves slightly differently in recipes. It's naturally sweeter and thicker than cow's milk, so you might need to adjust other ingredients. For example, you could reduce the sugar slightly if using oat milk in a cake.</p>

<h3>Cooking with Oat Milk in an Air Fryer</h3>
<p>When cooking with oat milk in an air fryer, remember that it can brown faster than dairy milk. Keep an eye on your dishes and adjust cooking times as needed.

<h3>How to Measure 15g of Lime Juice</h3>  
<p>Measuring lime juice by weight (15g) is more accurate than using volume, as it accounts for variations in juiciness. To measure 15g of lime juice, use a digital kitchen scale for precision. If you don’t have a scale, roughly 0.53 ounces (or just over half an ounce) will do the trick. This small but mighty ingredient can transform your air fryer dishes, from crispy chicken to vibrant vegetable sides.

<h2>Common Uses for 15g of Lime Juice in Air Fryer Recipes</h2>  
<p>Lime juice adds a bright, citrusy kick to countless air fryer dishes. A 15g portion (0.53 oz) is perfect for marinades, such as those for prawns or chicken, ensuring a tangy flavour without overpowering the dish. It’s also great for drizzling over air-fried fish or mixing into dips and sauces. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we recommend using fresh lime juice for the best results, as bottled versions can lack vibrancy. Whether you’re cooking seafood, meats, or veggies, 15g of lime juice can elevate your meal.</p>  

<p>Another fantastic use for 15g of lime juice is in dressings for air-fried salads or grain bowls. Combine it with olive oil, herbs, and a pinch of salt for a refreshing finish.

<h3>Tips for Storing Lime Juice</h3>

For longer storage, freeze lime juice in ice cube trays—each cube is roughly 15g (0.53 oz), making future recipes a breeze. This way, you’ll always have the perfect amount on hand for your air fryer adventures. Whether you’re whipping up a quick marinade or a zesty sauce, precise measurements ensure delicious results every time.</p>

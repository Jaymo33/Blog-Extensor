<p>1.33 cups of evaporated milk equals approximately 10.64 ounces. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements can make or break a dish. Whether you’re whipping up a creamy dessert or a savoury sauce, knowing the exact weight ensures consistency. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we understand the importance of accuracy in cooking, especially when using an air fryer.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>

A slight miscalculation could lead to overly thick sauces or dry baked goods.

<p>For the most accurate results, use a kitchen scale to weigh your evaporated milk. If you don’t have one, a liquid measuring cup will do, but be sure to level it off. Evaporated milk’s thickness means it can cling to measuring cups, so a quick scrape with a spatula helps.

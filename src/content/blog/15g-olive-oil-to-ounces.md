<p>15g of olive oil is approximately 0.53 ounces. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements can make all the difference. Whether you’re drizzling oil over chips or coating chicken, knowing the exact weight ensures consistent results. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we focus on making cooking simpler with accurate conversions and delicious recipes.</p>  

<h2>Why Convert Grams to Ounces for Olive Oil?</h2>  
<p>Many UK recipes, especially those for air fryers, use grams for measurements. However, some kitchen scales or international recipes might list olive oil in ounces. Converting 15g of olive oil to ounces (0.53 oz) ensures you’re using the right amount for perfect texture and flavour. Too much oil can make food soggy, while too little may leave it dry.</p>  
<p>Olive oil is a staple in air fryer cooking, used for crisping potatoes, marinating meats, or even baking. For example, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> often call for precise oil quantities to achieve that golden crunch. A slight miscalculation can alter the dish’s outcome, so accuracy matters.</p>  

<h2>How to Measure 15g of Olive Oil Accurately</h2>  
<p>The easiest way to measure 15g of olive oil is with a digital kitchen scale. Set the scale to grams, pour the oil until it hits 15g, and you’re done. If your scale only shows ounces, aim for 0.53 oz. For those without scales, 15g is roughly one tablespoon of olive oil, but this can vary slightly depending on density.</p>  

<h3>Using a Measuring Spoon</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a scale, a standard tablespoon can work in a pinch. One tablespoon of olive oil weighs about 13-15g, so it’s close enough for most recipes. However, for baking or dishes where precision is key, like our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>air fryer cakes</a>, a scale is recommended.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for 15g of Olive Oil in Air Fryers</h2>  
<p>Fifteen grams of olive oil is perfect for coating a single portion of vegetables or chicken wings before air frying. It’s enough to crisp them up without excess grease. You’ll find this measurement in many of our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion charts</a>, helping you adapt recipes effortlessly.</p>  
<p>For frozen foods like chips or nuggets, 15g of oil ensures even cooking and a satisfying crunch. Too little oil, and they might stick to the basket; too much, and they’ll turn out greasy. It’s all about balance, which is why we emphasise precise conversions.</p>  

<h3>Storing Olive Oil for Air Frying</h3>  
<p>Keep your olive oil in a cool, dark place to maintain its quality. Exposure to heat or light can degrade its flavour and health benefits. For easy access during cooking, consider a pour spout or dispenser that lets you measure small amounts like 15g accurately.</p>  

<h2>Converting Other Olive Oil Quantities</h2>  
<p>Need to convert a different amount? Here’s a quick reference: 30g is about 1.06 oz, and 50g is roughly 1.76 oz.

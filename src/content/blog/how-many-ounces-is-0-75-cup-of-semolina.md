<p>0.75 cup of semolina equals approximately 4.5 ounces (or 128 grams) in UK measurements. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes, ensuring your dishes turn out perfectly every time. Whether you're making crispy semolina-coated chicken or a light semolina cake, accurate measurements matter. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we focus on precise conversions to help you nail every recipe.</p>

<h2>Why accurate semolina measurements matter</h2>  
<p>Getting the right amount of semolina is crucial for texture and consistency in air fryer cooking. Too much can make coatings overly dense, while too little might not crisp up properly. Semolina is often used for breading fish, chicken, or even making air-fried desserts. If you're working with 0.75 cup of semolina, knowing it’s 4.5 ounces helps maintain balance in your recipes. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more handy measurements.</p>  

<p>Many UK home cooks prefer weighing ingredients for better accuracy. Scales eliminate guesswork, especially when dealing with semolina’s granular texture. Whether you’re preparing a <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>semolina-crusted chicken</a> or a Mediterranean-inspired dessert, 0.75 cup (4.5 oz) is a common quantity. Always level off your measuring cup for consistency—heapings can skew results.</p>  

<h3>How to measure semolina correctly</h3>  
<p>Use a dry measuring cup and spoon semolina in gently without packing it down. Sweep off the excess with a straight edge for an exact 0.75 cup. If using scales, 4.5 ounces is your target. For recipes requiring finer precision, grams (128g) might be preferable. Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>semolina-based recipes</a> to put this measurement to delicious use.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for 0.75 cup semolina</h2>  
<p>This quantity is perfect for coating proteins or creating air-fried desserts. A 0.75 cup (4.5 oz) of semolina can bread 4-6 chicken thighs or a batch of crispy shrimp. It’s also ideal for making semolina halva or light cakes in the air fryer. For <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert inspiration</a>, browse our curated collection of air fryer-friendly treats.</p>  

<p>Semolina’s high gluten content makes it excellent for achieving a golden crunch. If you’re reheating leftovers, a light dusting (about 1-2 tbsp from your 0.75 cup) can revive soggy textures. Store any leftover semolina in an airtight container to keep it fresh. Need cleaning tips for post-cooking? Our guide on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer maintenance</a> has you covered.</p>  

<h3>Adjusting recipes for different air fryer models</h3>  
<p>Some air fryers cook hotter or faster than others. If using 0.75 cup semolina (4.5 oz) for breading, monitor browning closely during the first trial. Compact models may require shorter cook times, while larger baskets distribute heat differently. Always preheat your air fryer for even results with semolina-coated dishes.</p>

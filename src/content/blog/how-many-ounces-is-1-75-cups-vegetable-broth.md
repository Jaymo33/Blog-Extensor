<p>1.75 cups of vegetable broth equals approximately 14 fluid ounces (or 14 oz). This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements ensure the best results. Whether you’re making soups, stews, or marinades, knowing this conversion helps you follow recipes accurately.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of liquid, like vegetable broth, can make or break your air fryer dishes. Too much broth can lead to soggy results, while too little might dry out your food. That’s why converting 1.75 cups of vegetable broth to ounces (14 oz) is so important. Many <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> rely on precise liquid measurements for perfect texture and flavour.</p>  

<p>Vegetable broth is a staple in many dishes, from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable-based recipes</a> to marinades for meats. If you’re preparing a large batch, knowing how to scale measurements ensures consistency. For example, doubling a recipe would mean using 28 oz (or 3.5 cups) of broth. A handy <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a> can save time and prevent mistakes.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure Vegetable Broth Correctly</h3>  
<p>To measure 1.75 cups of vegetable broth accurately, use a liquid measuring cup with clear markings. Fill it to the 1.75-cup line, or measure 14 fluid ounces directly. If you don’t have a measuring cup, a kitchen scale set to ounces can also work. This method is especially useful for <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/meal-prep>meal prep</a>, where precision is key.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for Vegetable Broth in Air Fryer Recipes</h2>  
<p>Vegetable broth adds depth to many air fryer dishes. It’s perfect for deglazing pans, creating sauces, or keeping meats moist. For example, a <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipe</a> might call for 1.75 cups (14 oz) of broth to ensure juicy results. You can also use it to cook grains or rehydrate dried ingredients.</p>  

<p>Another great use is in vegetarian or vegan air fryer meals. A dish like stuffed peppers or mushroom risotto often requires broth for flavour. Knowing that 1.75 cups equals 14 oz helps you adjust recipes effortlessly. Always store leftover broth properly to maintain freshness for future <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipes</a>.</p>  

<h3>Tips for Storing and Using Vegetable Broth</h3>  
<p>Once opened, vegetable broth should be refrigerated and used within a few days. If you’ve measured out 1.75 cups (14 oz) but don’t need it all, freeze the excess in ice cube trays. This way, you’ll have pre-portioned broth ready for your next air fryer adventure. Remember to label containers with the date to avoid waste.</p>

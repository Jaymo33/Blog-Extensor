<p>15g of baking powder is approximately 0.53 ounces. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes, especially when precision matters for baking. Whether you’re whipping up cakes, muffins, or savoury dishes, knowing how to convert grams to ounces ensures your recipes turn out perfectly every time.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer baking</h2>  
<p>Baking powder is a leavening agent, and using the right amount is crucial for achieving the desired rise and texture in your air fryer recipes. Too little, and your baked goods may turn out dense; too much, and they could collapse or taste bitter. That’s why converting 15g of baking powder to ounces (0.53 oz) accurately is so important.</p>  

<p>At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we emphasise precision in measurements to help you get the best results. Whether you’re making fluffy pancakes or crispy fried chicken, the right amount of baking powder makes all the difference.

<h3>How to measure 15g of baking powder without scales</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a kitchen scale, you can still measure 15g of baking powder using tablespoons. One level tablespoon of baking powder is roughly 15g (or 0.53 ounces). However, for the most accurate results, we recommend investing in a digital scale, especially if you bake frequently in your air fryer.</p>  

<h2>Common air fryer recipes using 15g of baking powder</h2>  
<p>Many air fryer recipes call for 15g of baking powder, particularly cakes, muffins, and batters. For example, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer vanilla sponge cake</a> uses this measurement to ensure a light, fluffy texture. Similarly, savoury dishes like tempura batter or onion rings may also require precise amounts of baking powder.</p>  

<p>If you’re experimenting with new recipes, always double-check your conversions. A small mistake in measuring 15g of baking powder (0.53 oz) can affect the final outcome.

<h3>Converting other baking powder quantities</h3>  
<p>If your recipe calls for more or less than 15g of baking powder, you can use the same conversion ratio. For instance, 30g would be 1.06 ounces, while 5g would be 0.18 ounces. Keeping a conversion chart handy, like the one on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, can save time and ensure accuracy.</p>  

<h2>Tips for storing baking powder for air fryer use</h2>  
<p>To maintain its effectiveness, store baking powder in a cool, dry place. Exposure to moisture can cause it to clump or lose potency, which could throw off your measurements. Always check the expiry date, as old baking powder may not provide the same lift in your air fryer recipes.</p>

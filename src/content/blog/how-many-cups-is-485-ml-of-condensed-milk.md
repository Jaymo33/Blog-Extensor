<p>485 ml of condensed milk equals approximately 2 cups. This conversion is essential for baking and air fryer recipes where precise measurements matter. Whether you're making fudge, cheesecake, or a creamy sauce, knowing this conversion ensures your dish turns out perfectly every time.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurement Matters</h2>  
<p>Condensed milk is a sticky, dense ingredient that can throw off recipes if not measured correctly. Using the right amount ensures your desserts have the perfect texture and sweetness. Too much can make your dish overly sweet or soggy, while too little might leave it dry or lacking flavour. For air fryer recipes, precise measurements help achieve even cooking and perfect results. Visit <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes</a> for inspiration on using condensed milk in your air fryer creations.</p>  

<p>Measuring condensed milk can be tricky due to its thickness. A liquid measuring cup works best, but you can also use a kitchen scale for accuracy. If you're converting between metric and imperial measurements often, bookmarking a conversion chart like the one at <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart</a> can save time and hassle.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure 485 ml of Condensed Milk</h3>  
<p>To measure 485 ml of condensed milk accurately, use a liquid measuring cup with clear markings. Pour slowly to avoid air bubbles, and level off the top with a spatula for precision. If you don't have a measuring cup, 485 ml is roughly equivalent to 2 standard US cups or 1.7 UK cups. For sticky ingredients like this, lightly greasing the measuring cup can help it slide out more easily.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for 485 ml of Condensed Milk</h2>  
<p>This quantity is perfect for many desserts and air fryer recipes. You might use it in a classic key lime pie, a batch of fudge, or a creamy caramel sauce. It's also great for adding richness to coffee drinks or as a sweetener in baked goods. Check out the dessert section at <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert</a> for more ideas.</p>  

<p>In air fryer cooking, condensed milk can be used to make quick bread puddings, glazes for pastries, or even dulce de leche. The concentrated sweetness means a little goes a long way, so measuring accurately is key. Remember that 485 ml of condensed milk equals about 2 cups, making it easy to adjust recipes as needed.</p>  

<h3>Converting Other Measurements</h3>  
<p>If your recipe calls for a different amount of condensed milk, here are some handy conversions: 250 ml equals about 1 cup, while 125 ml is roughly Â½ cup. For larger quantities, 1 litre equals approximately 4 cups. These conversions work for both UK and US recipes, though cup sizes vary slightly between the two. When in doubt, refer to reliable sources like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> for guidance.</p>  

<h2>Tips for Working with Condensed Milk</h2>  
<p>Always store unused condensed milk in an airtight container in the fridge. It keeps for about 2 weeks once opened. When measuring, warm the can slightly in warm water to make pouring easier. For sticky situations, keep a damp cloth handy to clean up spills quickly. And don't forget to check out <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner</a> for tips on keeping your appliance in top condition after sweet recipes.</p>  

<p>Condensed milk can be substituted with evaporated milk and sugar in some recipes, but the texture and flavour will differ. For authentic results, stick to the real thing when possible. Remember that 485 ml equals about 2 cups, making it easy to halve or double recipes as needed. With these measurements and tips, you're ready to tackle any recipe that calls for condensed milk.</p>

<h2>Why Convert 150g of Mustard to Ounces?</h2>

However, some cooks prefer working with ounces, particularly if they’re using older scales or following American recipes. Converting 150g of mustard to ounces (5.29 oz) ensures you’re using the right amount for your dish. This is especially important for condiments like mustard, where too much or too little can alter the flavour balance.</p>

<h3>How to Measure 150g of Mustard Accurately</h3>  
<p>For the most accurate measurement, use a digital kitchen scale set to grams. Scoop the mustard into a bowl until it reaches 150g, then switch the scale to ounces to see the equivalent (5.29 oz). If you don’t have a scale, remember that 150g of mustard is roughly 5 heaped tablespoons. However, weights can vary slightly depending on the mustard’s consistency, so a scale is always best.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for 150g of Mustard in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>

For example, mix it with honey for a sweet-and-tangy chicken glaze or combine it with herbs for a flavourful pork rub. The air fryer’s intense heat helps caramelise mustard-based coatings, creating deliciously crispy results.</p>

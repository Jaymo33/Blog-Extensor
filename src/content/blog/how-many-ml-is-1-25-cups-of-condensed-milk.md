<p>1.25 cups of condensed milk equals approximately 295.74 millilitres (ml). This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes, where precise measurements can make or break your dish. Whether you’re whipping up a dessert or a savoury sauce, knowing the exact ml equivalent ensures consistency and perfect results every time.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>
<p>Air fryers rely on precise cooking times and temperatures, and ingredient measurements are just as crucial. Using the correct amount of condensed milk (295.74 ml for 1.25 cups) ensures your recipes bake evenly and achieve the desired texture. Too much or too little can affect moisture levels, browning, and even cooking times.</p>
<p>For example, if you’re making a <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>decadent air fryer caramel flan</a>, the right amount of condensed milk ensures the perfect creamy consistency. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for other common ingredient conversions to streamline your cooking process.</p>

<h2>How to Measure Condensed Milk Correctly</h2>
<p>Measuring sticky ingredients like condensed milk can be tricky. To get an accurate 295.74 ml (1.25 cups), use a liquid measuring jug with clear ml markings. Lightly grease the cup or spoon with oil to help the condensed milk slide out easily, ensuring you don’t leave any behind.</p>
<p>If you’re scaling a recipe up or down, remember that 1 cup of condensed milk equals 236.59 ml, so 1.25 cups is simply 1 cup plus a quarter cup. This method works for both UK and US measurements, though slight regional variations in cup sizes can occur.</p>

<h3>Common Recipes Using 1.25 Cups (295.74 ml) of Condensed Milk</h3>
<p>This measurement is popular in many air fryer desserts, such as fudge, cheesecakes, and <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>no-bake treats</a>. For instance, a small-batch air fryer tres leches cake might call for precisely 1.25 cups (295.74 ml) to balance sweetness and texture.</p>

<h2>Converting Other Condensed Milk Measurements</h2>
<p>Need to adjust your recipe? Here’s a quick reference for other common conversions: 0.5 cups = 118.29 ml, 1 cup = 236.59 ml, and 2 cups = 473.18 ml. Bookmark our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a> for easy access during cooking.</p>
<p>If you’re working with a recipe that uses grams, note that 1.25 cups (295.74 ml) of condensed milk weighs roughly 375 grams. Always double-check with a kitchen scale if precision is critical, especially for baking.</p>

<h3>Tips for Storing and Handling Condensed Milk</h3>
<p>After measuring out your 295.74 ml (1.25 cups), store any leftover condensed milk in an airtight container in the fridge. It can thicken over time, so gently warm it in a water bath before reusing. For sticky residues, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner guide</a> has tips to keep your appliances spotless.</p>

<h2>Regional Differences in Cup Measurements</h2>
<p>While 1.25 cups of condensed milk equals 295.74 ml in both the UK and US, it’s worth noting that UK tablespoons differ slightly (15 ml vs. 14.79 ml in the US). For air fryer recipes, these minor variations rarely impact results, but for baking, sticking to one measurement system is best.</p>
<p>If you’re adapting a recipe from another country, use our conversion tools to avoid guesswork. For example, Australian recipes might use a 250 ml metric cup, so 1.25 cups would be 312.5 ml—adjust accordingly.</p>

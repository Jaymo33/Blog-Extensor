<p>210 ml of olive oil is approximately 0.89 cups (just under 1 cup). This conversion is essential for precise cooking and baking, especially when using an air fryer where measurements can make or break a recipe. Whether you're whipping up crispy roast potatoes or a moist cake, knowing how to convert millilitres to cups ensures consistency.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Olive Oil Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of olive oil in your air fryer recipes ensures even cooking and prevents dryness or sogginess. Too much oil can make food greasy, while too little may leave it undercooked. For example, when making <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer roasted vegetables</a>, 210 ml of olive oil (0.89 cups) coats them perfectly without excess dripping.</p>  
<p>Olive oil is a staple in Mediterranean and healthy cooking, and its viscosity means volume conversions must be precise. Unlike water, olive oil has a different density, so millilitre-to-cup conversions aren’t always straightforward. That’s why we’ve simplified it for you—so you can focus on creating delicious meals with your air fryer.</p>

<h2>How to Measure 210 ml of Olive Oil Without a Scale</h2>  
<p>If you don’t have a measuring jug with millilitre markings, use standard cup measurements. Since 210 ml of olive oil equals roughly 0.89 cups, you can fill a cup just below the brim. Alternatively, use a tablespoon—14 tablespoons equal 210 ml (since 1 tablespoon is about 15 ml).</p>  
<p>For air fryer recipes like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>crispy chicken</a>, precision ensures the coating adheres well without becoming oily. A slight variation can affect texture, so measuring correctly is key. Keep our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> handy for quick reference.</p>

<h3>US vs. UK Cup Measurements</h3>  
<p>Note that US and UK cup sizes differ slightly. In the UK, 1 cup is 284 ml, while in the US, it’s 240 ml. For 210 ml of olive oil, the US conversion is 0.89 cups, while the UK equivalent is roughly 0.74 cups. Always check your recipe’s origin to avoid discrepancies.</p>

<h2>Common Recipes Using 210 ml of Olive Oil</h2>  
<p>Many air fryer dishes call for around 210 ml of olive oil. For instance, marinating <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/lamb>lamb chops</a> or preparing a batch of <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/potatoes>garlic roast potatoes</a> often requires this amount. The oil helps crisp the exterior while locking in moisture.</p>  
<p>When baking, 210 ml of olive oil (0.89 cups) can replace butter in cakes for a lighter texture. Always level off your measuring cup for accuracy, and consider using a spouted jug for easier pouring. For more tips, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a>.</p>

<h3>Storing Leftover Olive Oil</h3>  
<p>If your recipe doesn’t use all 210 ml, store the remaining oil in an airtight container away from light. Olive oil can degrade if exposed to heat or air, affecting its flavour and health benefits. Proper storage ensures it’s ready for your next air fryer adventure.</p>

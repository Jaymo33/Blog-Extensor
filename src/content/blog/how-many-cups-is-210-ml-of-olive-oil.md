<p>210 ml of olive oil is approximately 0.89 cups (just under 1 cup). This conversion is essential for precise cooking and baking, especially when using an air fryer where measurements can make or break a recipe. Whether you're whipping up crispy roast potatoes or a moist cake, knowing how to convert millilitres to cups ensures consistency.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Olive Oil Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of olive oil in your air fryer recipes ensures even cooking and prevents dryness or sogginess. Too much oil can make food greasy, while too little may leave it undercooked. For example, when making <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer roasted vegetables</a>, 210 ml of olive oil (0.89 cups) coats them perfectly without excess dripping.</p>  
<p>Olive oil is a staple in Mediterranean and healthy cooking, and its viscosity means volume conversions must be precise. Unlike water, olive oil has a different density, so millilitre-to-cup conversions aren’t always straightforward. That’s why we’ve simplified it for you—so you can focus on creating delicious meals with your air fryer.</p>

<h2>How to Measure 210 ml of Olive Oil Without a Scale</h2>  
<p>If you don’t have a measuring jug with millilitre markings, use standard cup measurements. Since 210 ml of olive oil equals roughly 0.89 cups, you can fill a cup just below the brim. Alternatively, use a tablespoon—14 tablespoons equal 210 ml (since 1 tablespoon is about 15 ml).</p>  
<p>For air fryer recipes like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>crispy chicken</a>, precision ensures the coating adheres well without becoming oily. A slight variation can affect texture, so measuring correctly is key.

<h3>US vs. UK Cup Measurements</h3>

<h3>Storing Leftover Olive Oil</h3>

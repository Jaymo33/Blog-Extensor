<p>304 F converts to Gas Mark 2 for oven cooking. This temperature conversion is particularly useful when adapting recipes between conventional ovens and air fryers. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we frequently encounter questions about converting Fahrenheit to Gas Mark, especially for British cooks using older oven models.</p>

<h2>Understanding 304 F to Gas Mark Conversion</h2>
<p>The Gas Mark scale is a British temperature measurement system used in traditional ovens. When converting 304 F to Gas Mark, you're dealing with a moderately low oven temperature ideal for slow cooking. This temperature works perfectly for delicate bakes and slow-roasted dishes in both ovens and air fryers. Many of our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> originally designed for conventional ovens require this conversion.</p>
<p>Gas Mark 2 (304 F) is commonly used for custards, certain cakes, and slow-cooked meats. In air fryers, this temperature helps prevent burning while ensuring thorough cooking. The circulating hot air in air fryers means you might need to adjust cooking times slightly compared to conventional oven recipes. Always check your food a few minutes early when using these conversions.</p>

<h2>Why 304 F to Gas Mark Matters for Air Fryers</h2>
<p>Modern air fryers typically display temperatures in Celsius or Fahrenheit, leaving many UK cooks needing to convert to Gas Mark. Knowing that 304 F equals Gas Mark 2 helps bridge this gap. This knowledge becomes especially valuable when following older British recipes or using hand-me-down cookbooks that only reference Gas Mark settings.</p>
<p>At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we recommend keeping a conversion chart handy for quick reference. When cooking frozen foods like those in our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/frozen-foods>frozen foods category</a>, precise temperature control prevents soggy or burnt results. The 304 F to Gas Mark conversion ensures your air fried dishes come out perfectly cooked every time.</p>

<h3>Practical Applications of 304 F in Cooking</h3>
<p>Gas Mark 2 (304 F) is ideal for recipes requiring gentle, even heat. In air fryers, this temperature works wonderfully for reheating leftovers without drying them out. It's also perfect for cooking delicate fish fillets or baking cheesecakes where higher temperatures might cause cracking. The moderate heat allows for thorough cooking without excessive browning.</p>

<h2>Converting Other Temperatures Around 304 F</h2>
<p>When working with temperatures near 304 F, it helps to know the surrounding Gas Mark equivalents. For instance, 302 F is still Gas Mark 2, while 320 F moves up to Gas Mark 3. These small increments matter when precision cooking in your air fryer. Our comprehensive <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a> covers all these variations in detail.</p>
<p>Remember that air fryers cook faster than conventional ovens, so even at the correct 304 F to Gas Mark conversion, you may need to reduce cooking times by 20-30%. This is particularly true for recipes from our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>cakes category</a>, where overbaking can dry out your bakes. Always perform the toothpick test a few minutes before the recommended time.</p>

<h3>Tips for Perfect Temperature Conversion</h3>
<p>For best results when converting 304 F to Gas Mark, always preheat your air fryer properly. Unlike ovens that can take time to reach precise Gas Mark settings, air fryers heat up quickly. Use an oven thermometer to verify your air fryer's temperature accuracy, especially when working with delicate recipes requiring exact 304 F (Gas Mark 2) temperatures.</p>

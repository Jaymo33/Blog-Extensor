<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on even heat distribution, and incorrect measurements can lead to uneven cooking. Ground coriander, like other spices, should be measured by weight for accuracy. A slight variation in volume can alter the flavour profile of your dish. For example, 3 cups of ground coriander to ounces ensures you’re not overpowering your recipe.

<p>Using a kitchen scale is the best way to measure 3 cups of ground coriander in ounces. Volume measurements can vary due to factors like how tightly packed the spice is. If you don’t have a scale, fluff the coriander lightly before scooping. This method helps standardise the conversion from cups to ounces.

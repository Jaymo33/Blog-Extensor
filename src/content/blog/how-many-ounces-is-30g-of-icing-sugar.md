<p>30g of icing sugar equals approximately 1.06 ounces. This conversion is essential for bakers and home cooks who need precise measurements, especially when using an air fryer for delicate desserts. Whether you're dusting a cake or preparing a glaze, knowing the exact weight ensures consistent results.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Baking</h2>  
<p>Baking is a science, and even small deviations in measurements can affect the texture and taste of your treats. Icing sugar, also known as powdered sugar, is often used in frostings, glazes, and light batters. A slight miscalculation could make your mixture too thick or too runny. For air fryer recipes, precision is even more critical, as the cooking environment is faster and more intense than a conventional oven.</p>  
<p>At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we emphasise the importance of accurate conversions to help you achieve perfect results every time. Whether you're making air fryer cookies or a fluffy sponge cake, getting the 30g icing sugar to ounces conversion right is key.

<h2>How to Convert 30g of Icing Sugar to Ounces</h2>  
<p>The conversion from grams to ounces is straightforward. One gram is approximately 0.035 ounces, so 30g of icing sugar works out to roughly 1.06 ounces. For most recipes, rounding to 1 ounce is acceptable, but for precision baking, sticking to 1.06 ounces ensures accuracy. If you're using a digital scale, simply switch the unit setting from grams to ounces for an instant readout.</p>  
<p>If you don’t have a scale, you can use measuring spoons or cups, though this method is less precise. One tablespoon of icing sugar is about 8g, so 30g would be just under 4 tablespoons. However, for best results, especially in air fryer baking, we recommend weighing your ingredients. Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipes section</a> for more ideas on using icing sugar in your air fryer creations.</p>  

<h3>Common Uses for 30g of Icing Sugar</h3>  
<p>Icing sugar is incredibly versatile. A 30g portion is perfect for dusting desserts like air fryer doughnuts or making a small batch of glaze for cookies. It’s also ideal for lightening cake batters or sweetening whipped cream. Because air fryers cook quickly, using the right amount of icing sugar ensures your treats caramelise evenly without burning.</p>  

<h3>Tips for Measuring Icing Sugar</h3>  
<p>Always sift icing sugar before measuring to avoid lumps. If your recipe calls for 30g of icing sugar to ounces, fluff it up with a fork first for an accurate measure. Store icing sugar in an airtight container to prevent clumping, and keep it in a cool, dry place.

<h2>Converting Other Sugar Weights</h2>  
<p>If you're working with larger or smaller amounts, the same conversion principle applies. For example, 50g of icing sugar is roughly 1.76 ounces, while 15g is about 0.53 ounces. Keeping a conversion chart handy, like the one on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, can save time and reduce errors. Consistency is key, especially when adapting traditional recipes for the air fryer.</p>  
<p>Remember, different sugars have varying densities, so granulated or brown sugar won’t weigh the same as icing sugar for the same volume. Always check whether your recipe specifies grams or ounces to avoid confusion.

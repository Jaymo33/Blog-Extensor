<p>300 grams of broccoli is roughly equivalent to 3 to 3.5 cups when chopped, depending on how finely it's cut. This conversion is handy for air fryer recipes, where precise measurements can make all the difference. Whether you're prepping a stir-fry, roasting florets, or adding broccoli to a casserole, knowing this conversion ensures consistent results every time. For more air fryer measurement tips, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of ingredients ensures even cooking and perfect texture in your air fryer. Too much broccoli can overcrowd the basket, leading to unevenly cooked florets. Too little might dry out or burn. Measuring 300 grams of broccoli in cups helps you portion correctly, especially for recipes like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer roasted vegetables</a>. Broccoli's density varies slightly based on whether it's tightly packed or loosely chopped, so slight adjustments may be needed.</p>  

<p>For best results, lightly pack the broccoli into your measuring cup without crushing it. If you're working with larger florets, they'll take up more space, so you might end up closer to 3 cups. Finely chopped broccoli will fit more densely, bringing the measurement closer to 3.5 cups. Always consider the recipe's requirements—some dishes benefit from tighter packing, while others need a lighter touch.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure 300 Grams of Broccoli Without a Scale</h3>  
<p>If you don't have a kitchen scale, visual cues can help. A medium-sized head of broccoli typically weighs around 300 grams, yielding roughly 3 cups when chopped. Smaller florets or pre-cut supermarket broccoli may vary, so use the cup measurement as a guideline. For more precision, refer to our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable recipe category</a>, where we break down measurements for popular air fryer dishes.</p>  

<h2>Converting 300 Grams of Broccoli for Different Recipes</h2>  
<p>Air fryer recipes often call for specific volumes, so knowing how 300 grams translates to cups is essential. For crispy roasted broccoli, 300 grams (about 3 cups) fits perfectly in most standard air fryer baskets. If you're making a broccoli casserole or stir-fry, this measurement ensures balanced flavours and textures. Visit <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> for recipes tailored to these measurements.</p>  

<p>When substituting frozen broccoli, note that 300 grams frozen will yield slightly less volume once thawed due to water loss. For frozen conversions, check our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/frozen-foods>frozen foods section</a>. Fresh broccoli retains its structure better, making it ideal for air frying. Whether you're meal prepping or cooking for one, 300 grams of broccoli is a versatile quantity that works well in most dishes.</p>  

<h3>Tips for Cooking 300 Grams of Broccoli in Your Air Fryer</h3>  
<p>To get the best results, toss your 300 grams of broccoli (about 3 cups) with a light coating of oil and seasonings before air frying. Spread it evenly in the basket to ensure crispiness. At 180°C, it should take 10–12 minutes, shaking halfway.

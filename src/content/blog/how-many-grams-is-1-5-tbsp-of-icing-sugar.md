<p>1.5 tablespoons (tbsp) of icing sugar equals approximately 18 grams. This conversion is essential for precise baking, especially when using an air fryer for desserts like cakes or cookies. Getting the measurement right ensures your recipes turn out perfectly every time.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer baking</h2>  
<p>When using an air fryer, precise ingredient measurements are crucial for consistent results. Too much or too little icing sugar can affect texture, sweetness, and even cooking times. For example, a <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>cake recipe</a> might require exact grams of icing sugar to balance moisture and structure. Air fryers circulate hot air rapidly, so imbalances in dry ingredients can lead to uneven browning or dryness.</p>  

<p>British baking standards often use grams for accuracy, as tablespoon measurements can vary slightly. If you’re adapting a recipe from cups or tablespoons to grams, always double-check conversions. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> simplifies this process, ensuring your desserts turn out flawless.</p>  

<h3>How to measure 1.5 tbsp of icing sugar without scales</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a digital scale, spoon the icing sugar into a tablespoon and level it off with a knife for accuracy. Repeat this process for the half tablespoon. Remember, packed vs. loose icing sugar can vary in weight, so fluff it up before measuring for consistency.

<h2>Common uses for 1.5 tbsp of icing sugar</h2>  
<p>This small but mighty measurement is perfect for dusting air-fried desserts like doughnuts or <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cookies>cookies</a>. It’s also ideal for glazes or light sweetening in frostings. Since air fryers excel at quick baking, having pre-measured grams of icing sugar saves time when whipping up last-minute treats.</p>

<h3>Converting other icing sugar measurements</h3>  
<p>If your recipe calls for larger quantities, remember that 1 UK tablespoon of icing sugar is roughly 12 grams. For 3 tbsp, you’d need about 36 grams. Always use a clean, dry measuring spoon to avoid clumping, especially important for air fryer recipes where moisture affects crispiness.</p>

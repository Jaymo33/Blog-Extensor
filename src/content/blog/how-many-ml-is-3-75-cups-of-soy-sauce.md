<p>3.75 cups of soy sauce equals approximately 887.21 millilitres (ml). This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes, where precise measurements can make or break a dish. Whether you're marinating chicken, glazing salmon, or whipping up a stir-fry, knowing the exact ml equivalent ensures consistency and flavour balance. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we prioritise accuracy to help you achieve restaurant-quality results at home.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Soy Sauce Measurements Matter</h2>
<p>Using the right amount of soy sauce is crucial, especially in air fryer cooking, where flavours concentrate. Too little, and your dish may lack depth; too much, and it can become overpoweringly salty. Converting 3.75 cups of soy sauce to ml (887.21 ml) eliminates guesswork. This precision is particularly handy for batch cooking or meal prep, where consistency is key. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for other common measurements.</p>
<p>Many air fryer recipes, like teriyaki-glazed tofu or honey-soy chicken, rely on soy sauce as a base. Knowing that 3.75 cups equals 887.21 ml helps you scale recipes up or down without compromising taste. For example, if a recipe serves four but you're cooking for two, halving the soy sauce to 443.6 ml ensures perfect proportions. Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipes</a> for inspiration on using soy sauce in marinades.</p>

<h2>How to Measure 3.75 Cups of Soy Sauce in ml</h2>
<p>To measure 887.21 ml of soy sauce, use a liquid measuring jug with clear ml markings. Pour the soy sauce slowly to avoid spills and check at eye level for accuracy. If your jug only has cup measurements, note that 1 cup equals 236.59 ml, so 3.75 cups × 236.59 = 887.21 ml. This method works for both UK and US cup measurements, as they’re standardized for liquids like soy sauce.</p>

<h3>Tips for Using Soy Sauce in Air Fryer Recipes</h3>
<p>Soy sauce adds umami depth to air-fried dishes, but its saltiness means balance is key. When converting 3.75 cups of soy sauce to ml (887.21 ml), consider pairing it with sweet or acidic ingredients like honey or lime juice. For a healthier twist, opt for low-sodium soy sauce—just ensure you’re still using 887.21 ml for consistency.

    "@type": "Answer",
    "text": "Yes, you can substitute quick oats for rolled oats in the same 0.66 cup (2.64 ounce) measurement, but the texture will be slightly different. Quick oats absorb liquid faster and result in a softer consistency, which might affect air fryer recipes like granola or cookies."

    "@type": "Answer",
    "text": "Steel-cut oats are denser than rolled oats, so 0.66 cup would weigh more (about 3.5 ounces). They also require longer cooking times in the air fryer and more liquid. For best results, adjust your recipe accordingly or stick to rolled oats for most air fryer applications."

    "acceptedAnswer": {
    "@type": "Answer",
    "text": "Air fryers cook faster than conventional ovens, and oats are particularly susceptible to burning due to their low moisture content. Try reducing the temperature by 10-15°C and checking frequently. Also ensure your 0.66 cup (2.64 oz) measurement is accurate, as too many oats can create dry spots that burn easily."

    "@type": "Answer",
    "text": "Absolutely! Recipes using 0.66 cup (2.64 oz) of rolled oats freeze well, especially granola or oat bars. Let them cool completely, then store in airtight containers with parchment between layers. Reheat in the air fryer at 160°C for 3-5 minutes to restore crispiness."

<p>0.66 cup of rolled oats equals approximately 2.64 ounces (74.8 grams) in UK measurements. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes, ensuring your breakfasts or baked goods turn out perfectly every time. Whether you're making granola, oatmeal cookies, or a hearty morning porridge, accurate measurements make all the difference. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we know precision matters when cooking with your air fryer.</p>

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter for air fryer recipes</h2>
<p>Using the correct amount of rolled oats ensures your air fryer recipes have the right texture and consistency. Too little, and your granola might not clump properly; too much, and your cookies could turn out dry. The air fryer's rapid air circulation means ingredients cook faster, so precise measurements are crucial.

<p>Rolled oats are a staple in many air fryer breakfast recipes, from crunchy granola to fluffy oat muffins. Knowing that 0.66 cup equals 2.64 ounces helps you scale recipes up or down with confidence. This measurement is particularly useful for meal prep, where consistency is key. Visit our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipes section</a> for more inspiration on using rolled oats in your air fryer.</p>

<h3>How to measure 0.66 cup of rolled oats accurately</h3>
<p>For the most accurate measurement, use a digital kitchen scale to weigh out 2.64 ounces (74.8 grams) of rolled oats. If you don’t have a scale, lightly spoon the oats into a measuring cup until it’s just over two-thirds full, then level it off with a straight edge. Avoid packing the oats down, as this can lead to over-measuring.</p>

<h2>Common uses for 0.66 cup of rolled oats in air fryer cooking</h2>
<p>This measurement is perfect for single-serving portions or small-batch recipes. You might use 0.66 cup (2.64 ounces) of rolled oats for a personal-sized batch of air fryer granola or a couple of hearty oatmeal cookies. It’s also ideal for adding texture to air-fried fruit crumbles or as a binder in veggie burgers.

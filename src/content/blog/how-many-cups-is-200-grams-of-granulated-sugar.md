<p>200 grams of granulated sugar equals approximately 1 cup in US measurements or 0.8 cups in UK measurements. Whether you're baking a cake or whipping up a dessert in your air fryer, getting the sugar measurement right is crucial for perfect results. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we know precision matters, so let’s dive into the details.</p>  

<h2>Understanding Granulated Sugar Measurements</h2>  
<p>Granulated sugar is a staple in baking and cooking, but its density can vary slightly depending on how it’s packed. In the US, 1 cup of granulated sugar typically weighs around 200 grams, while in the UK, 1 cup is closer to 250 grams. This means 200 grams of granulated sugar in the UK would be just under a full cup. If you're using an air fryer for recipes like cookies or cakes, accurate sugar measurements ensure the right texture and sweetness.</p>  

<p>For those who love baking, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> can help you switch between grams, cups, and other units effortlessly. Whether you're making air fryer brownies or a classic sponge cake, knowing how many cups is 200 grams of granulated sugar keeps your recipes consistent.</p>  

<h3>US vs UK Cup Measurements</h3>  
<p>The difference between US and UK cup sizes can catch bakers off guard. A US cup holds 240ml, while a UK cup is 250ml. This small variation means 200 grams of granulated sugar in cups isn’t identical across regions. For US bakers, it’s roughly 1 cup, but UK bakers should measure slightly less—around 0.8 cups. Always check your recipe’s origin to avoid mishaps.</p>  

<h2>Converting 200 Grams of Granulated Sugar for Air Fryer Recipes</h2>  
<p>Air fryers are fantastic for baking, but precise measurements are key. If a recipe calls for 200 grams of granulated sugar and you’re using cups, ensure you’re using the correct cup size. Too much sugar can make desserts overly sweet or affect texture, while too little might leave them bland. For perfect air fryer cakes or cookies, weigh your sugar if possible, or use our conversion guide.</p>

<h3>Tips for Measuring Granulated Sugar</h3>  
<p>To measure 200 grams of granulated sugar without scales, fluff the sugar first to avoid packing it too tightly. Spoon it into your measuring cup and level it off with a knife for accuracy. If your air fryer recipe specifies grams, investing in a kitchen scale is worthwhile—especially for baking, where precision matters.</p>  

<h2>Common Recipes Using 200 Grams of Granulated Sugar</h2>

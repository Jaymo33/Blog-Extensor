<p>145 C in a fan oven is equivalent to approximately 125 C in a conventional oven without the fan. This 20-degree reduction is standard for UK fan-assisted ovens, as the circulating air cooks food more efficiently. When using an air fryer, which works similarly to a fan oven, you can typically use the same 145 C setting for comparable results.</p>

<h2>Understanding Fan Oven Conversions</h2>
<p>The key principle when converting 145 C to fan oven settings is recognising that fan-assisted cooking requires lower temperatures. This is because the constant air circulation distributes heat more evenly, reducing cooking times by about 20%. For recipes originally written for conventional ovens, you'll achieve better results by subtracting 20 degrees when using a fan oven or air fryer.</p>
<p>Many modern recipes at <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> now include specific fan oven and air fryer temperature guidance. However, when working with older recipes or international sources, this conversion becomes essential. The 145 C to 125 C adjustment works particularly well for delicate bakes like souffl√©s or custards that might overcook at higher fan-assisted temperatures.</p>

<h3>Why 145 C Matters in Fan Cooking</h3>
<p>145 C represents a crucial mid-range temperature for many cooking techniques. In fan ovens and air fryers, it's ideal for slow-roasting vegetables, baking sponge cakes, or cooking fish fillets. The moderate heat allows thorough cooking without excessive browning, making it perfect for dishes where texture matters as much as flavour.</p>

<h2>Air Fryer Equivalents for 145 C</h2>
<p>Modern air fryers essentially function as compact fan ovens, meaning the 145 C setting translates directly in most cases. However, because air fryers have more intense air circulation, you might need to reduce cooking times by 5-10 minutes compared to fan oven recipes. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> provides detailed timing adjustments for various foods.</p>
<p>When preparing frozen foods at 145 C in an air fryer, you'll notice they crisp beautifully without burning. This temperature works exceptionally well for reheating leftovers like roast potatoes or baking pre-made pastry items. The gentle heat revives food without making it tough or dry, a common issue at higher temperatures.</p>

<h3>Baking at 145 C in Fan Mode</h3>
<p>For baking enthusiasts, 145 C in a fan oven produces wonderfully even results. Cakes rise uniformly without doming, and biscuits bake through without over-browning at the edges. This temperature is particularly good for <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/Cakes>cake recipes</a> containing delicate ingredients like citrus or chocolate that might burn at higher heats.</p>

<h2>Adjusting Cooking Times at 145 C</h2>
<p>While the 145 C to 125 C conversion handles temperature, cooking times also need consideration. In a fan oven, recipes typically cook 10-15% faster than conventional oven timings. For air fryers, the difference can be 20-25% faster. Always check food 5-10 minutes before the recipe suggests, especially when trying new conversions.</p>
<p>Meat thermometers become invaluable when cooking at 145 C, as visual cues change with fan-assisted cooking. Chicken breasts might look done earlier but reach safe temperatures right on time. Similarly, vegetables soften perfectly at this temperature without losing texture - ideal for meal prepping using your <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/Meal-Prep>air fryer meal prep recipes</a>.</p>

<h3>Special Considerations for 145 C</h3>
<p>Some ovens and air fryers run hotter or cooler than their displays indicate. If you find 145 C consistently under- or overcooks your food, invest in an oven thermometer to verify actual temperatures. Regular <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaning</a> also maintains accurate temperature performance, as built-up grease can affect heat distribution.</p>

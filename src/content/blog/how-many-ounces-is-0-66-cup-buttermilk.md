<p>0.66 cup of buttermilk equals approximately 5.28 ounces (or 5 ¼ oz) in UK measurements. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes, where precise ingredient quantities can make or break your dish. Whether you’re whipping up fluffy pancakes or tender fried chicken, knowing the exact weight ensures consistency. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we simplify conversions so you can focus on cooking.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate buttermilk measurements matter</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of buttermilk is crucial for achieving the perfect texture in air-fried foods. Too little can leave baked goods dry, while too much may make batters runny. For example, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer fried chicken recipe</a> relies on buttermilk’s acidity to tenderise the meat. A 0.66 cup measurement (5.28 oz) ensures the marinade penetrates evenly without oversaturating.</p>  

<p>Buttermilk’s thickness also affects air fryer cooking times. Thinner mixtures may require adjustments to prevent splattering. Check our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a> for other common measurements to streamline your prep work.</p>  

<h3>How to measure 0.66 cup buttermilk without scales</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a kitchen scale, use the displacement method: fill a liquid measuring cup to the ⅔ mark (about 160ml). For sticky buttermilk, lightly grease the cup first. This 0.66 cup to ounces conversion works for all UK-standard recipes at <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>.</p>  

<h2>Converting buttermilk for different air fryer recipes</h2>  
<p>Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>air fryer cake recipes</a> often call for 0.66 cup buttermilk (5.28 oz) to activate baking soda. This creates the ideal rise without metallic aftertaste. For savoury dishes like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>air fryer chicken wings</a>, the same measurement ensures crispy exteriors with juicy interiors.</p>  

<p>Remember that buttermilk substitutes (like milk + vinegar) may measure differently. Always check our conversion guides for adjustments. Proper 0.66 cup to ounce conversions prevent wasted ingredients and failed batches.</p>  

<h3>Storing leftover buttermilk after measuring</h3>  
<p>After measuring your 0.66 cup (5.28 oz), store remaining buttermilk in an airtight container for up to two weeks. Shake well before reusing in other <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a>. The acidity actually increases over time, enhancing its tenderising properties.</p>

<p>2 cups of tikka paste equals approximately 16 ounces. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes, ensuring precise measurements for the best results. Whether you're marinating chicken or preparing a saucy dish, knowing the weight helps maintain consistency. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we focus on making cooking simpler with accurate conversions.</p>  

<h2>Why Convert Cups to Ounces for Tikka Paste?</h2>  
<p>Converting 2 cups of tikka paste to ounces ensures accuracy, especially in air fryer cooking where measurements matter. Unlike liquids, pastes like tikka can vary in density, making weight a more reliable metric. Using ounces helps avoid over-seasoning or diluting flavours, which is crucial for dishes like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>air fryer chicken tikka</a>.</p>  
<p>Many UK recipes list ingredients by weight, so knowing that 2 cups of tikka paste is roughly 16 ounces simplifies adjustments. This is particularly handy when scaling recipes up or down. For more conversions, check our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>  

<h2>How to Measure 2 Cups of Tikka Paste Accurately</h2>  
<p>To measure 2 cups of tikka paste correctly, use a liquid measuring cup for sticky consistencies. Scoop the paste gently, levelling it off with a spatula for precision. If you don’t have measuring cups, a kitchen scale set to ounces (16 oz for 2 cups) works perfectly.</p>  
<p>For thicker pastes, lightly grease the measuring cup to ensure easy release. This trick is especially useful when prepping <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/lamb>air fryer lamb tikka</a>. Always clean your tools promptly—here’s how to <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>clean your air fryer</a> effectively.</p>  

<h3>Common Mistakes When Measuring Tikka Paste</h3>  
<p>Avoid packing the paste tightly into the cup, as this leads to excess and skewed measurements. Similarly, eyeballing instead of weighing can throw off your recipe’s balance. For consistent results, stick to the 16-ounce benchmark for 2 cups.</p>  

<h2>Using 2 Cups of Tikka Paste in Air Fryer Recipes</h2>  
<p>With 16 ounces of tikka paste, you can marinate up to 1.5 kg of protein, ideal for batch cooking. The air fryer’s even heat distribution ensures the paste caramelises beautifully without burning. Try it with <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>these air fryer recipes</a> for effortless midweek meals.</p>  
<p>For lighter dishes, dilute the paste with yogurt or oil, adjusting the ounces accordingly. Remember, 2 cups (16 oz) of tikka paste is versatile—use it as a base for curries, glazes, or even dips.</p>  

<h3>Storing Leftover Tikka Paste</h3>  
<p>Transfer unused paste to an airtight container, labelling it with the weight (e.g., “8 oz left”). Refrigerated, it lasts up to a week, or freeze it in ounce-portioned cubes for future use. This minimises waste and streamlines cooking.</p>

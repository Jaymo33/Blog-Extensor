<h2>Why Accurate Honey Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Honey is denser than water, so volume conversions aren’t always straightforward. Using too much or too little can throw off the balance of your air fryer recipes. For example, a sticky glaze might become overly sweet, or a marinade might lack depth. Measuring 185 ml of honey correctly ensures your dishes turn out as intended. Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a> for dishes that use honey perfectly.</p>  

<p>Different countries use different cup sizes, which adds another layer of complexity. A US cup is 240 ml, while a UK cup is 284 ml. This means 185 ml of honey converts to slightly different amounts depending on where you are. Always double-check your measurements to avoid mishaps, especially when baking in your air fryer.</p>  

<h2>How to Measure 185 ml of Honey Without a Scale</h2>  
<p>If you don’t have a kitchen scale, use a liquid measuring jug for accuracy. Pour the honey slowly to avoid air bubbles, which can distort the measurement. For 185 ml of honey, fill the jug just below the 200 ml mark, as honey’s viscosity makes it settle differently. This method ensures you get the right amount every time.</p>  

<h3>Using Tablespoons as an Alternative</h3>  
<p>One tablespoon holds about 15 ml of honey, so 185 ml equals roughly 12 tablespoons plus 1 teaspoon. This is handy if you’re scaling a recipe up or down. Just remember that honey’s stickiness can make scooping messy, so use a warm spoon for easier handling.</p>

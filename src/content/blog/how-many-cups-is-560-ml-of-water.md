<p>560 ml of water equals approximately 2.37 cups in the US measurement system and roughly 2.46 cups in the UK. This conversion is essential for precise cooking, baking, or preparing air fryer recipes where accurate liquid measurements matter. Whether you're whipping up a cake or adjusting a sauce, knowing how to convert millilitres to cups ensures perfect results every time.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Water Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Getting the right amount of water is crucial, especially in air fryer cooking where moisture balance affects texture and crispiness. Too much liquid can make food soggy, while too little may dry it out. For example, when making air fryer cakes or steamed buns, 560 ml of water must be measured precisely to avoid a dense or uneven bake. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more handy measurement swaps.</p>  

<p>In baking, even a slight deviation can alter the outcome. If a recipe calls for 560 ml of water, using the correct cup measurement ensures your dough or batter has the right consistency. This is particularly important for air fryer recipes like Yorkshire puddings or soufflés, where precision is key. For more baking tips, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>cake recipes</a> designed for air fryers.</p>  

<h3>US vs. UK Cup Measurements</h3>  
<p>The difference between US and UK cups might seem small, but it can impact recipes. A US cup holds 240 ml, while a UK cup is 284 ml. So, 560 ml of water converts to roughly 2.37 US cups or 2.46 UK cups. Always check which measurement system your recipe uses, especially if following international guides or <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> from different regions.</p>  

<h2>How to Measure 560 ml of Water Without a Scale</h2>  
<p>If you don’t have a measuring jug, use standard cups or tablespoons for approximation. Since 1 US cup is 240 ml, 560 ml is just over 2 cups plus 2 tablespoons. For UK cups, it’s closer to 2 cups plus 1.5 tablespoons. This method works well for most air fryer dishes, like soups or marinades, where slight variations won’t ruin the dish.</p>  

<p>Another trick is using a liquid measuring bottle with millilitre markings for accuracy. This is ideal for recipes requiring exact water quantities, such as air fryer bread or steamed puddings.

<h3>Common Recipes Using 560 ml of Water</h3>  
<p>Many air fryer recipes, like broths or batters, use around 560 ml of water. For instance, a simple air fryer ramen or a light tempura batter might require this amount. It’s also a standard measurement for rehydrating ingredients like dried mushrooms or beans in <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable-based dishes</a>.</p>  

<h2>Converting Other Liquids: Milk, Broth, and Oil</h2>  
<p>While 560 ml of water is straightforward, other liquids like milk or broth have similar densities, so the conversion remains nearly identical. However, oils are slightly lighter, but for most cooking purposes, you can use the same cup measurement. This is handy when adapting stovetop recipes for your air fryer, such as creamy sauces or stews.</p>  

<p>For sticky liquids like honey or syrup, weight matters more than volume. But when working with water-based liquids, 560 ml will always align with the cup conversions mentioned earlier.

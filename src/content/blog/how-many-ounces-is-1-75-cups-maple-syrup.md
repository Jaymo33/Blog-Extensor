<h2>Why accurate maple syrup measurements matter</h2>  
<p>Maple syrup is a staple in many air fryer recipes, from sweet glazes to marinades. Using too much or too little can alter the texture and flavour of your dish. For example, 1.75 cups of maple syrup is perfect for coating a batch of air-fried chicken wings, but measuring it in ounces ensures you don’t overdo it. If you're experimenting with new recipes, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a> has plenty of inspiration.</p>  

<p>Precision is especially important when baking in an air fryer, as the compact cooking space requires balanced ingredients. A slight variation in maple syrup can affect caramelisation or sticking. For sticky desserts like air-fried cinnamon rolls, 14.8 oz of maple syrup ensures the right level of sweetness without making them soggy.</p>  

<h2>How to measure maple syrup for air fryer recipes</h2>  
<p>Measuring maple syrup can be tricky due to its thick consistency. For 1.75 cups, use a liquid measuring cup with a spout for easy pouring. Alternatively, a kitchen scale set to ounces will give you the most accurate result (14.8 oz). If you’re working with smaller quantities, remember that 1 cup of maple syrup equals roughly 8.45 oz in the UK.</p>  

<h3>Common mistakes when converting cups to ounces</h3>  
<p>One frequent error is confusing fluid ounces with weight ounces. Maple syrup’s density means 1.75 cups translates to 14.8 fluid ounces, not weight ounces. Also, using a dry measuring cup instead of a liquid one can lead to inaccuracies.

<h2>Maple syrup substitutes in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>If you’re out of maple syrup, honey or agave nectar can work as substitutes, but their weights differ. For instance, 1.75 cups of honey weighs about 20 oz, so adjustments are needed. Always cross-check conversions to avoid altering your recipe’s outcome.

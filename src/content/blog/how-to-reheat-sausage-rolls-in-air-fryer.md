<p>Reheating sausage rolls in an air fryer is simple: preheat to 160°C (320°F) and cook for 3–5 minutes until crispy. This method ensures they stay moist inside while regaining that golden crunch. Whether you’re working with leftovers or refrigerated sausage rolls, the air fryer delivers consistent results without the sogginess of a microwave.</p>  

<h2>Why Use an Air Fryer to Reheat Sausage Rolls?</h2>  
<p>The air fryer excels at reheating sausage rolls because it circulates hot air evenly, crisping the pastry without drying out the filling. Unlike microwaving, which can leave them rubbery, the air fryer restores that freshly baked texture. It’s also faster than using a conventional oven, making it ideal for quick meals or snacks.

<h2>Step-by-Step Guide to Reheating Sausage Rolls</h2>  
<h3>Preheating Your Air Fryer</h3>  
<p>Always preheat your air fryer to 160°C (320°F) for 3 minutes before adding sausage rolls. This ensures even cooking and prevents uneven reheating. If your model doesn’t have a preheat function, simply run it empty for a few minutes at the target temperature.</p>  

<h3>Timing and Temperature</h3>  
<p>For refrigerated sausage rolls, 3–5 minutes at 160°C is ideal. Frozen sausage rolls may need 8–10 minutes at the same temperature. Avoid overcrowding the basket to allow proper air circulation. For extra crispiness, spritz lightly with oil before reheating.</p>  

<h2>Tips for Perfect Reheated Sausage Rolls</h2>  
<p>To prevent dryness, place a small oven-safe dish of water in the air fryer basket. This adds moisture to the cooking environment. For extra flakiness, brush the pastry with a little melted butter before reheating. If you’re reheating multiple batches, keep cooked sausage rolls warm in a low oven.

<h2>Common Mistakes to Avoid</h2>  
<p>Overheating is the biggest culprit for dry sausage rolls. Stick to the recommended time and check frequently. Avoid using foil or parchment paper, as it blocks airflow. Instead, use the air fryer basket or a compatible rack. For more troubleshooting, browse our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a>.</p>  

<h2>Alternative Reheating Methods Compared</h2>  
<p>While microwaving is quicker, it sacrifices texture. Oven reheating takes longer but can yield similar results to an air fryer. For the best balance of speed and quality, the air fryer wins.

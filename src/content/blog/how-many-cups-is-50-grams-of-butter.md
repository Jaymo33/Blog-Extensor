<p>50 grams of butter equals approximately 0.22 cups (or just under 1/4 cup). This conversion is essential for baking, cooking, and air frying, where precise measurements can make or break a recipe. Whether you're whipping up cakes, cookies, or savoury dishes in your air fryer, knowing how to convert grams to cups ensures consistent results every time.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Butter Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Getting the right amount of butter is crucial, especially in air frying, where ingredient ratios affect texture and cooking times. Too much butter can lead to greasy results, while too little may dry out your dish. For recipes like air-fried cookies or crispy potatoes, 50 grams of butter (0.22 cups) provides the perfect balance of richness and crispiness.

<p>Different butter types (salted, unsalted, or plant-based) have slight density variations, but the 50g-to-cups conversion remains reliable for most cooking needs. If you're adapting a recipe from grams to cups, always measure butter properly—either by weight for precision or using the spoon-and-level method for cups.

<h3>How to Measure 50 Grams of Butter Without Scales</h3>  
<p>No kitchen scales? No problem. Use the markings on butter packaging: a standard UK block of butter usually has 50g increments marked. Alternatively, 50 grams is roughly two tablespoons (since 1 tbsp ≈ 25g). For softer butter, spoon it into a measuring cup until it reaches just under 1/4 cup (0.22 cups).</p>  

<h2>Converting 50 Grams of Butter for Air Fryer Recipes</h2>  
<p>Air fryers excel at creating crispy textures with minimal oil, but butter adds flavour and moisture. When a recipe calls for 50 grams of butter (0.22 cups), consider melting it first for even coating—ideal for dishes like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/potatoes>air-fryer potatoes</a> or garlic bread. Remember, air frying reduces cooking time, so butter-infused recipes may brown faster.</p>  

<p>For baking in the air fryer, like muffins or small cakes, creaming 50 grams of butter with sugar ensures a light texture. If substituting oil, use 0.22 cups (50g) of melted butter for similar richness. Always preheat your air fryer for consistent results, and avoid overcrowding to ensure even cooking.

<h3>Butter Conversions: UK vs. US Measurements</h3>  
<p>In the UK, butter is often sold in 250g blocks with 50g markings, while US sticks are typically 113g (1/2 cup). For 50 grams of butter, both regions use the same cup equivalent (0.22 cups), but always check recipe origins—some US recipes may list butter by volume (cups) rather than weight.</p>  

<h2>Common Recipes Using 50 Grams of Butter</h2>  
<p>From <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cookies>air-fryer cookies</a> to savoury sauces, 50 grams of butter (0.22 cups) is a versatile quantity. Try it in garlic butter for prawns, brushed over corn on the cob, or in a batter for crispy chicken. For desserts, 50g butter works wonders in small-batch brownies or shortbread.</p>  

<p>Air frying locks in moisture, so butter-based marinades (like 50g melted butter with herbs) keep meats juicy. For healthier twists, reduce butter slightly and add a splash of broth.

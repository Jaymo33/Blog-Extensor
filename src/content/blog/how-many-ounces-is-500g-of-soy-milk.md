At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we focus on making cooking simpler, especially when it comes to measurements. Let’s dive deeper into why this conversion matters and how to use it in your air fryer.</p>

<h2>Why Convert 500g of Soy Milk to Ounces?</h2>  
<p>Converting 500g of soy milk to ounces (17.64 oz) is crucial for accuracy in recipes. Many air fryer recipes, especially those from the UK, use metric measurements, while others rely on imperial units. If you’re following a recipe from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>our collection</a>, knowing this conversion helps avoid guesswork. Soy milk, being a liquid, requires precise measurement to maintain the right texture and consistency in dishes like custards or batters. A slight miscalculation could lead to a runny or overly thick result.</p>  

<p>Additionally, some air fryer accessories, like liners or inserts, have weight limits measured in ounces. Knowing how much 500g of soy milk weighs in ounces ensures you don’t overfill them.

<h3>How to Measure 500g of Soy Milk Accurately</h3>  
<p>To measure 500g of soy milk, use a digital kitchen scale for the most accurate results. Place your measuring jug on the scale, tare it to zero, then pour the soy milk until it reaches 500g. If your scale displays ounces, it should read around 17.64 oz. For those without a scale, 500g of soy milk is roughly 2 metric cups (500ml), but weighing is always more precise. This method is especially useful for air fryer recipes where consistency is key, like in our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert section</a>.</p>

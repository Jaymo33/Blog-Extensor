<p>150g of soy milk equals approximately 5.29 ounces. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements can make or break your dish. Whether you're whipping up a dairy-free cake or a creamy sauce, knowing how to convert grams to ounces ensures consistency. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we focus on making conversions effortless so you can focus on cooking.</p>  

<h2>Why Convert 150g of Soy Milk to Ounces?</h2>  
<p>Many air fryer recipes, especially those from the UK, use metric measurements like grams. However, some kitchen scales or recipe books may list ingredients in ounces. Converting 150g of soy milk to ounces (5.29 oz) helps avoid guesswork and guarantees accurate results. This is particularly useful for baking, where even small measurement errors can affect texture and taste.</p>  
<p>If you're exploring international recipes, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> simplifies the process. Soy milk, a popular dairy alternative, is often used in vegan and lactose-free air fryer dishes like pancakes, custards, or batters. Precise measurements ensure your recipes turn out perfectly every time.</p>  

<h2>How to Measure 150g of Soy Milk Accurately</h2>  
<p>Using a digital kitchen scale is the easiest way to measure 150g of soy milk. Set your scale to grams, pour the soy milk until it hits 150g, and you’re done. If your scale only displays ounces, aim for 5.29 oz. For those without scales, a measuring jug with both metric and imperial markings can work, though scales are more precise.</p>  

<h3>Common Uses for 150g of Soy Milk in Air Fryer Recipes</h3>  
<p>Soy milk is a versatile ingredient in air fryer cooking. From fluffy <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>cakes</a> to crispy batters, 150g (5.29 oz) is a common quantity in many recipes. It’s also great for making dairy-free sauces or marinades. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a> for inspiration on how to use soy milk in your air fryer.</p>  

<h2>Tips for Working with Soy Milk in Air Fryers</h2>  
<p>Soy milk behaves similarly to dairy milk in most recipes, but it can vary in thickness. If your 150g of soy milk seems too thin, reduce it slightly or mix with a thickening agent like cornflour. Always shake the carton well before measuring, as separation can occur. For cleaning sticky air fryer baskets after cooking with soy milk, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning guide</a> has you covered.</p>  
<p>Storing leftover soy milk? Transfer it to an airtight container and refrigerate. Remember, 150g of soy milk is roughly 5.29 ounces, so adjust recipes accordingly if scaling up or down. Whether you're making desserts or savoury dishes, precise measurements lead to the best results.</p>

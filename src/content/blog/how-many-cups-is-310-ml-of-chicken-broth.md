<p>310 ml of chicken broth equals approximately 1.31 cups. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes, where precise measurements can make or break a dish. Whether you're making soups, sauces, or marinades, knowing how to convert millilitres to cups ensures consistent results. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we help simplify cooking conversions so you can focus on creating delicious meals.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on precise ingredient ratios to achieve the perfect texture and flavour. Too much or too little liquid, like chicken broth, can affect cooking times and results. For example, 310 ml of chicken broth is often used in marinades or to keep meats moist during cooking. If you’re unsure about conversions, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> can be a lifesaver.</p>  

<p>Using the correct amount of chicken broth ensures your dish isn’t too dry or overly soggy. Whether you’re following a recipe from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>our collection</a> or improvising, accuracy is key. A slight mismeasurement could mean the difference between crispy perfection and a disappointing meal.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure 310 ml of Chicken Broth Without a Measuring Cup</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a measuring cup handy, you can still measure 310 ml of chicken broth accurately. A standard UK metric cup holds 250 ml, so 310 ml is just over 1 and 1/4 cups. Alternatively, use a kitchen scale—310 ml of chicken broth weighs roughly 310 grams. This method is especially useful for air fryer recipes where precision matters.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for 310 ml of Chicken Broth in Air Fryer Recipes</h2>  
<p>Chicken broth adds depth and moisture to many air fryer dishes. From <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipes</a> to vegetable roasts, 310 ml is a common quantity. It’s perfect for basting, deglazing, or creating light sauces. For example, a 310 ml portion can be used to keep a whole chicken juicy while air frying.</p>  

<p>Another great use is in grain-based dishes like quinoa or couscous, where the broth infuses extra flavour. If you’re experimenting with new recipes, always check our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning tips</a> to keep your air fryer in top condition after cooking with liquids like broth.</p>  

<h3>Converting 310 ml of Chicken Broth for Different Cup Sizes</h3>  
<p>In the UK, a standard cup is 250 ml, while in the US, it’s 240 ml. This means 310 ml of chicken broth is roughly 1.31 UK cups or 1.29 US cups. For most recipes, this small difference won’t matter, but for baking or precise sauces, it’s good to be aware. Always double-check which measurement system your recipe uses.</p>

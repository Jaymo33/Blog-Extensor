<p>225 grams of blueberries is roughly equivalent to 1.5 cups. This measurement is essential for baking, air frying, or any recipe requiring precise quantities. Whether you're whipping up a blueberry crumble in your air fryer or adding them to muffins, knowing this conversion ensures perfect results every time.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter</h2>
<p>Using the correct amount of blueberries can make or break a recipe. Too few, and your dish might lack flavour; too many, and it could become soggy or unbalanced. For air fryer recipes, precise measurements help achieve even cooking and perfect texture. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we emphasise the importance of accuracy for consistent results.</p>
<p>Blueberries vary slightly in size, but 225 grams generally fills about 1.5 standard measuring cups. If you're using frozen blueberries, note that they may pack differently, so adjust accordingly. For more conversion tips, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>

<h2>How to Measure 225 Grams of Blueberries</h2>
<p>For the most accurate measurement, use a kitchen scale. Simply place your bowl on the scale, tare it to zero, and add blueberries until you reach 225 grams. If you don't have a scale, lightly spoon blueberries into a measuring cup until it's heaping, then level it off for an approximate 1.5 cups.</p>
<p>Avoid packing the blueberries down, as this can lead to over-measuring. If your recipe calls for 225 grams of blueberries in cups and you're using an air fryer, remember that air circulation is key. Even distribution ensures everything cooks evenly. Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>blueberry recipes</a> for inspiration.</p>

<h3>Fresh vs. Frozen Blueberries</h3>
<p>Fresh and frozen blueberries can be used interchangeably in most recipes, but their measurements might differ slightly. Frozen berries tend to be denser, so 225 grams could take up slightly less volume. If your recipe specifies fresh, you may need to adjust cooking times slightly when using frozen.</p>

<h2>Common Recipes Using 225 Grams of Blueberries</h2>
<p>From air fryer blueberry muffins to compotes, 225 grams of blueberries is a versatile quantity. This amount is perfect for a batch of scones, a small crumble, or even a fruity topping for pancakes. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert recipes</a>, you'll find plenty of ways to use this measurement.</p>
<p>If you're making a blueberry sauce for drizzling over air-fried desserts, 225 grams yields about 1.5 cups of sauce. For cleaning tips after cooking sticky blueberry dishes, visit our guide on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner</a>.</p>

<h3>Adjusting for Different Blueberry Sizes</h3>
<p>Larger blueberries may take up more space in a cup, while smaller ones pack tighter. If your berries are particularly big or small, you might find 225 grams equals slightly more or less than 1.5 cups. When in doubt, weigh them for precision, especially in baking.</p>

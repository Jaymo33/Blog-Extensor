<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter</h2>
<p>Using the correct amount of blueberries can make or break a recipe. Too few, and your dish might lack flavour; too many, and it could become soggy or unbalanced.

<h2>How to Measure 225 Grams of Blueberries</h2>
<p>For the most accurate measurement, use a kitchen scale. Simply place your bowl on the scale, tare it to zero, and add blueberries until you reach 225 grams. If you don't have a scale, lightly spoon blueberries into a measuring cup until it's heaping, then level it off for an approximate 1.5 cups.</p>
<p>Avoid packing the blueberries down, as this can lead to over-measuring. If your recipe calls for 225 grams of blueberries in cups and you're using an air fryer, remember that air circulation is key. Even distribution ensures everything cooks evenly.

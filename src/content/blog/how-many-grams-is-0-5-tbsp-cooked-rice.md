<h2>Why measure cooked rice in grams?</h2>

This precision matters when cooking small batches in your air fryer or counting calories. Many of our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> include gram measurements for this reason.</p>

<h3>Factors affecting cooked rice weight</h3>
<p>The exact weight of 0.5 tbsp cooked rice can vary slightly depending on the rice variety and cooking method. Short-grain rice tends to be denser than long-grain, potentially adding an extra gram to the measurement. How much water the rice absorbed during cooking also plays a role. These small differences matter most in baking applications where precision is crucial.</p>

<h2>Converting other rice measurements</h2>
<p>If you need to convert different amounts of cooked rice, here's a handy reference: 1 tbsp equals about 12 grams, while 1/4 cup is roughly 50 grams. These conversions work well for scaling air fryer recipes up or down. Remember that these are approximate values - for absolute precision, always use digital kitchen scales. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> features many recipes using these standard conversions.</p>

<p>When working with larger quantities, the weight per tablespoon may decrease slightly due to settling. This is why professional recipes often specify weights rather than volumes. For perfect air fryer results every time, consider investing in an accurate scale. They're particularly useful for our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert recipes</a> where precision matters most.</p>

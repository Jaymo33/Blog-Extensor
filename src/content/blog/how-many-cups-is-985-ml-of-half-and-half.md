This conversion is essential for anyone using half and half in baking, cooking, or air fryer recipes. Whether you're whipping up a creamy sauce or a decadent dessert, knowing the exact measurement ensures perfect results every time.</p>

<h2>Understanding Half And Half Measurements</h2>
<p>Half and half is a dairy product made by combining equal parts whole milk and cream. It’s commonly used in recipes to add richness without being as heavy as pure cream.

<p>1.33 cups of almonds equals approximately 6.5 ounces (or 6.5 oz). This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes, where precise measurements ensure perfect results every time. Whether you're making almond-crusted chicken or a batch of homemade granola, knowing the weight of your ingredients matters.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate almond measurements matter</h2>  
<p>When using an air fryer, consistency is key. Too many almonds can overcrowd the basket, while too few might leave your dish lacking texture. For recipes like almond-crusted fish or roasted vegetables, 1.33 cups of almonds (6.5 oz) provides the ideal balance. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more handy measurement tips.</p>  

<p>Almonds are a versatile ingredient, whether whole, sliced, or ground. Their weight can vary slightly based on how they're prepared, but 1.33 cups generally translates to 6.5 ounces. This makes scaling recipes up or down simple, especially when using your air fryer for quick, healthy meals.</p>  

<h2>How to measure almonds correctly</h2>  
<p>For the most accurate results, use a kitchen scale to weigh your almonds. If you don't have one, spoon the almonds into a measuring cup and level them off. Avoid packing them down, as this can lead to an incorrect measurement. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipes section</a> has plenty of ideas for using almonds in your air fryer.</p>  

<h3>Whole vs. sliced almonds</h3>  
<p>Whole almonds take up more space in a cup than sliced ones, but their weight remains similar. If your recipe calls for 1.33 cups of sliced almonds, you'll still need roughly 6.5 ounces. This consistency makes conversions straightforward, whether you're cooking or baking.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for 1.33 cups of almonds</h2>  
<p>From crunchy toppings to nutty coatings, 1.33 cups of almonds (6.5 oz) can elevate many dishes.

<h3>Storing almonds for freshness</h3>

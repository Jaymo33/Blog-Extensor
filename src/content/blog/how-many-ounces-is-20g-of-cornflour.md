<p>20g of cornflour equals approximately 0.71 ounces. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements can affect texture and consistency. Whether you’re coating chicken or thickening a sauce, knowing how many ounces 20g of cornflour is ensures your dish turns out perfectly. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we focus on making conversions easy for home cooks. Let’s dive deeper into why this measurement matters and how to use it in your air fryer.</p>

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>
<p>Air fryers rely on even cooking, and the right amount of cornflour can make or break your dish. Too much cornflour can lead to a dry, powdery coating, while too little might not crisp up properly. Converting 20g of cornflour to ounces (0.71 oz) helps you follow recipes precisely, especially those from international sources. Many UK recipes use grams, but if you’re working with a US-based air fryer recipe, ounces might be the standard. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> simplifies this process for you.</p>

<p>Cornflour is a staple in air fryer cooking, often used for crispy coatings or as a thickening agent. Whether you’re making fried chicken or a light batter for vegetables, 20g of cornflour is a common measurement. Knowing it’s 0.71 ounces means you can confidently adapt recipes without guesswork. For more air fryer tips, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a>, where precision meets flavour.</p>

<h2>How to measure 20g of cornflour without scales</h2>
<p>Not everyone has a kitchen scale, but you can still measure 20g of cornflour (0.71 oz) accurately. One tablespoon of cornflour weighs about 10g, so two level tablespoons will give you roughly 20g. For a more precise measurement, use a measuring spoon set or a graduated jug. If you’re converting 20g of cornflour to ounces frequently, consider investing in a digital scale for consistency. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we recommend tools that make cooking easier and more enjoyable.</p>

<h3>Common uses for 20g of cornflour in air fryer recipes</h3>
<p>20g of cornflour is often used to coat proteins like chicken or fish before air frying. It creates a light, crispy texture without the need for excess oil. You might also use 20g of cornflour to thicken sauces or gravies in air fryer dishes. For example, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipes</a> often call for this measurement to achieve the perfect crunch. Experiment with 0.71 ounces of cornflour in your next air fryer meal for professional results.</p>

<h2>Converting other cornflour measurements</h2>
<p>If you need to convert larger or smaller amounts of cornflour, the same principle applies. For example, 50g of cornflour is about 1.76 ounces, while 10g is roughly 0.35 ounces. These conversions are handy when scaling recipes up or down for your air fryer.

Whether you're making glazes, desserts, or sauces, knowing how to convert grams to ounces ensures your dish turns out perfectly every time.</p>

<h2>Why Convert 200g of Marmalade to Ounces?</h2>
<p>Many British recipes, especially those for air fryers, use metric measurements like grams. However, some kitchen scales or older recipes might still use ounces.

This is particularly useful when preparing dishes like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer marmalade-glazed chicken</a> or desserts where consistency matters.</p>
<p>Accurate measurements also prevent waste. Too much marmalade can make a dish overly sweet, while too little might leave it lacking flavour.

<p>0.25 cup of gram flour equals approximately 1.06 ounces. This conversion is essential for precise measurements in air fryer recipes, ensuring your dishes turn out perfectly every time. Whether you’re making crispy pakoras or gluten-free bread, knowing the exact weight of gram flour can make all the difference. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we’re all about helping you nail those measurements for flawless results.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on precise ingredient ratios to achieve that perfect crispiness without overcooking. Using too much or too little gram flour can affect texture and taste, especially in batters or coatings. For example, if you’re making onion bhajis in your air fryer, 0.25 cup of gram flour (1.06 ounces) ensures the right consistency for a light, crispy finish. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more handy measurement tips.</p>  

<p>Gram flour, also known as besan, is a staple in many air fryer recipes due to its high protein content and binding properties. Whether you’re coating chicken or baking gluten-free goodies, measuring 0.25 cup correctly (1.06 ounces) guarantees consistent results. For inspiration, browse our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> featuring gram flour as a key ingredient.</p>  

<h3>How to measure 0.25 cup of gram flour accurately</h3>  
<p>For the most precise measurement, use a kitchen scale to weigh out 1.06 ounces of gram flour. If you don’t have one, spoon the flour into a measuring cup and level it off with a knife. Avoid packing it down, as this can lead to using more than 0.25 cup (1.06 ounces). This method ensures your air fryer dishes, like crispy tofu or vegetable fritters, turn out just right.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for 0.25 cup of gram flour in air fryer recipes</h2>  
<p>From batters to binders, 0.25 cup of gram flour (1.06 ounces) is a versatile ingredient. It’s perfect for coating chicken wings before air frying, giving them a golden, crunchy exterior. You can also mix it with spices for a flavourful dredge or use it in gluten-free baking.

<p>Another great use for 0.25 cup of gram flour is in vegan or vegetarian recipes. Try it in falafel or vegetable pakoras for a protein-packed crunch. The 1.06-ounce measurement ensures the right balance without making the mixture too dense.

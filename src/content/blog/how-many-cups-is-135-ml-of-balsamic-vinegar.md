<p>135 ml of balsamic vinegar equals approximately 0.57 cups (just over half a cup). This conversion is essential for precise cooking and baking, especially when using an air fryer where measurements matter. Whether you're whipping up a glaze or a marinade, knowing how to convert millilitres to cups ensures your dish turns out perfectly every time.</p>  

<h2>Understanding Balsamic Vinegar Measurements</h2>  
<p>Balsamic vinegar is a staple in many kitchens, adding depth to dressings, marinades, and even desserts. When a recipe calls for 135 ml of balsamic vinegar, it's helpful to know the equivalent in cups. In the UK and USA, cup measurements can vary slightly, but for most practical purposes, 135 ml translates to roughly 0.57 cups. This means you’ll need just over half a standard measuring cup.</p>  

<p>If you're using an air fryer, precise measurements can make all the difference. Too much liquid can affect cooking times, while too little might leave your dish lacking flavour. For more air fryer tips, visit <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>our recipes section</a>.</p>

<p>Getting the right amount of balsamic vinegar ensures balanced flavours in your dishes.

If you don’t have a measuring cup, a kitchen scale can also help. Weighing 135 grams of balsamic vinegar will give you the same volume, as its density is close to water.</p>  

<p>For those who love baking, this conversion is particularly useful. Many <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert recipes</a> call for precise amounts of balsamic vinegar, especially in reductions or glazes. A slight miscalculation could alter the taste significantly.</p>

<p>Investing in a good set of measuring cups and spoons is a game-changer. If you’re frequently converting 135 ml of balsamic vinegar to cups, having the right tools saves time. A liquid measuring cup with millilitre markings is ideal for accuracy.

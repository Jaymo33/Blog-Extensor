At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we understand the importance of accurate measurements for perfect cooking.</p>

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>
<p>Air fryers rely on precise cooking times and ingredient ratios to deliver crispy, evenly cooked meals. Using too much or too little tomato paste can affect the texture and flavour of your dish. For example, adding 7 grams (0.5 tbsp) of tomato paste to your air fryer meatballs will give them the perfect consistency.

<p>Many air fryer recipes call for small amounts of concentrated ingredients like tomato paste. This is because the intense heat of the air fryer amplifies flavours. When converting 0.5 tbsp of tomato paste to grams, you're ensuring your recipe maintains the right balance.

<h3>How to measure 0.5 tbsp of tomato paste accurately</h3>
<p>The easiest way to measure 0.5 tbsp of tomato paste is using a digital kitchen scale set to grams. Simply scoop your tomato paste and weigh it until you reach 7 grams.

<h2>Common uses for 0.5 tbsp of tomato paste in air fryer recipes</h2>
<p>This small but mighty measurement features in many air fryer dishes. You might use 7 grams (0.5 tbsp) of tomato paste in homemade air fryer pizza sauce or as a base for stuffed peppers. The concentrated flavour adds depth without making dishes too watery. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipes</a> often include this precise measurement for marinades.</p>

<p>Tomato paste works particularly well in air fryers because it caramelises beautifully under the intense heat. When you convert 0.5 tbsp to 7 grams, you're ensuring this caramelisation happens perfectly. Too much paste can lead to burning, while too little might leave your dish lacking flavour.

<h2>Why Accurate Rice Measurements Matter</h2>

<p>Different rice types, such as basmati or jasmine, may vary slightly in volume. However, 275 grams generally fits within the 1.3 to 1.4 cup range.

<h3>UK vs. US Cup Measurements</h3>  
<p>In the UK, a standard cup holds 250ml, while in the US, it’s 240ml. This means 275 grams of rice is roughly 1.4 UK cups or 1.3 US cups. If your air fryer recipe originates from a different region, always double-check the cup size to avoid errors. For international cooks, sticking to grams is often easier, but our guide ensures you can adapt any recipe effortlessly.</p>  

<h2>How to Measure 275 Grams of Rice Without Scales</h2>  
<p>If you don’t have a kitchen scale, use the spoon-and-level method for accuracy. Fill a measuring cup with rice, then level it off with a straight edge. Remember, 275 grams of rice is just over 1 1/4 cups in most cases. For air fryer cooking, consistency matters—packed rice can lead to incorrect measurements.

<p>Another trick is to compare rice to common household items. For example, 275 grams of rice is roughly the size of two medium apples. While not as precise as scales, visual estimates help in a pinch. For best results, invest in a digital scale—especially if you frequently use your air fryer for rice-based dishes like stir-fries or casseroles.</p>  

<h3>Cooking Rice in an Air Fryer</h3>  
<p>Air fryers aren’t just for crispy foods—they can cook rice perfectly too. For 275 grams of rice, use a heatproof dish or liner to prevent sticking.

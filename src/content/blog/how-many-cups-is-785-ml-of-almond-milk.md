<p>785 ml of almond milk is approximately 3.31 cups. This conversion is essential for anyone using almond milk in recipes, especially when preparing dishes in an air fryer. Whether you're baking, cooking, or making sauces, knowing the exact measurement ensures consistent results every time.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of almond milk can make or break a recipe. Too much liquid can lead to soggy textures, while too little might dry out your dish.

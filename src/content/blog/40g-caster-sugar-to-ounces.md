<p>40 grams of caster sugar equals approximately 1.41 ounces. This conversion is essential for anyone using an air fryer to bake, ensuring precise measurements for perfect results. Whether you’re making cakes, cookies, or other sweet treats, getting the sugar quantity right is crucial. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we understand the importance of accuracy in baking, especially when using an air fryer.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate sugar measurements matter</h2>  
<p>Using the correct amount of caster sugar can make or break your air fryer recipes. Too little sugar, and your baked goods may lack sweetness and texture. Too much, and they could become overly sticky or burn easily. The air fryer’s rapid heat circulation means precision is key. For example, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer cake recipes</a> rely on exact measurements to ensure fluffy, evenly cooked results every time.</p>  

<p>Converting 40g of caster sugar to ounces is straightforward, but it’s helpful to understand the science behind it. Grams are a metric unit, while ounces are imperial, commonly used in the UK and US. A digital kitchen scale is the best tool for this, but if you don’t have one, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> can be a lifesaver.</p>  

<h3>How to measure 40g of caster sugar without scales</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a scale, you can use measuring spoons or cups to approximate 40g of caster sugar. One tablespoon of caster sugar is roughly 12.5g, so 3 tablespoons plus a teaspoon will get you close to 40g. However, for best results, we recommend investing in a digital scale, especially if you frequently use your air fryer for baking.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for 40g of caster sugar in air fryer recipes</h2>  
<p>40g of caster sugar is a common measurement in many air fryer desserts. For instance, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>air fryer cake recipes</a> often call for this amount to balance sweetness without overpowering other flavours. It’s also ideal for cookies, meringues, and even glazes for air-fried fruits.</p>

<h3>Tips for storing caster sugar</h3>

<p>175 grams of butter is roughly 3/4 cup (0.77 cups to be precise) in both UK and US measurements. Whether you're baking cakes or preparing savoury dishes in your air fryer, getting the butter measurement right ensures perfect results every time. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we know precise conversions make all the difference in air fryer cooking.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Butter Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Recipes</h2>
<p>Using the correct amount of butter ensures your air fryer recipes turn out as intended. Too little butter can lead to dry, crumbly bakes, while too much may cause greasy results or uneven cooking. For example, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer cookie recipes</a> rely on precise butter ratios for that perfect chewy texture. Since air fryers circulate hot air rapidly, even small measurement errors can amplify during cooking.</p>
<p>175 grams of butter is a common quantity in many recipes, from pastry crusts to buttery sauces. Converting 175g butter to cups correctly helps maintain the balance of fats and other ingredients. If you're adapting conventional oven recipes for your air fryer, accurate conversions are even more critical due to the air fryer's faster cooking times.</p>

<h3>UK vs US Cup Measurements for 175g Butter</h3>
<p>While 175 grams of butter equals 0.77 cups in both systems, slight variations exist in cup sizes. A UK cup holds 250ml, whereas a US cup is 240ml. For most air fryer recipes, this minor difference won’t impact results. However, for precision baking like our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>air fryer cakes</a>, using grams with a kitchen scale is ideal.</p>

<h2>How to Measure 175 Grams of Butter Without Scales</h2>
<p>If you don’t have scales, you can measure 175 grams of butter using standard butter packaging markings. In the UK, butter often comes in 250g blocks with tablespoon markings on the wrapper. Since 1 tablespoon equals about 14g, 175g is approximately 12.5 tablespoons. For cups, scoop softened butter into a measuring cup, ensuring no air pockets.</p>
<p>Another method is using displacement: fill a liquid measuring cup with 1 cup of water, then add butter until the water level rises to 1.77 cups (the equivalent of 175g). This works well for recipes like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversions</a> where precision matters. Remember, cold butter packs more densely than softened butter, so temperature affects volume measurements.</p>

<h3>Converting 175g Butter for Different Air Fryer Dishes</h3>
<p>For savoury dishes like air-fried potatoes, 175 grams of butter might be melted and tossed with seasonings. In baking, like our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cookies>air fryer cookies</a>, creaming 175g butter with sugar is key for texture. Always check whether your recipe lists butter by volume (cups) or weight (grams) to avoid mishaps.</p>

<h2>Common Recipes Using 175 Grams of Butter</h2>

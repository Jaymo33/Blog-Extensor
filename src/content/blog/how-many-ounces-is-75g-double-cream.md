    "@type": "Answer",
    "text": "Yes, but the results will differ. Single cream has a lower fat content (around 18%) compared to double cream (48%). This means it won’t whip as well and may produce a thinner texture in sauces or desserts. If substituting, adjust cooking times slightly, as single cream heats faster."

    "@type": "Answer",

<p>75g of double cream equals approximately 2.65 ounces. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements can make or break your dish. Whether you're whipping up a creamy sauce or baking a decadent dessert, knowing how to convert grams to ounces ensures consistency. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we’re all about making cooking easier, so let’s break this down further.</p>  

<h2>Why Convert 75g of Double Cream to Ounces?</h2>  
<p>Many UK recipes use grams, but if you're working with a kitchen scale that measures in ounces, conversions are a must. Double cream is a rich, high-fat dairy product often used in air fryer desserts like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>decadent cakes</a> or creamy sauces. Getting the measurement right ensures your dish isn’t too heavy or too light. A slight miscalculation could alter the texture, especially in baked goods.</p>  

<p>For example, if you’re making a <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>classic air fryer cheesecake</a>, 75g of double cream (2.65 oz) adds the perfect richness. Too much, and it could become overly dense; too little, and it might lack creaminess. That’s why we recommend using a digital scale for accuracy. If you don’t have one, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> can help you switch between units effortlessly.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure 75g of Double Cream Without a Scale</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a scale, you can use volume measurements as a rough guide. One tablespoon of double cream weighs about 15g, so 75g would be roughly 5 tablespoons. However, this method isn’t as precise as weighing, so for best results, invest in a kitchen scale. It’s a game-changer for air fryer cooking, where precision matters.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for 75g of Double Cream in Air Fryer Recipes</h2>  
<p>Double cream is incredibly versatile in air fryer cooking. From <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>fluffy cakes</a> to creamy pasta sauces, it adds richness and depth. For instance, 75g (2.65 oz) of double cream is perfect for a small batch of garlic mushroom sauce or a single-serving chocolate mousse. It’s also ideal for enriching scrambled eggs or creating a luscious topping for scones.</p>  

<p>Another great use is in <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>air fryer desserts</a>, where 75g of double cream can be whipped into stiff peaks for a light, airy finish. Just remember to chill your bowl and beaters first for the best results. If you’re unsure about conversions, bookmark our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a> for quick reference.</p>  

<h3>Tips for Storing and Handling Double Cream</h3>  
<p>Double cream has a high fat content, so it’s prone to spoilage if not stored properly. Always keep it refrigerated and use it within a few days of opening. If your recipe calls for 75g (2.65 oz) and you have leftovers, freeze them in an airtight container for up to a month. Thaw in the fridge before using, and give it a good stir to restore consistency.</p>

<p>Buttermilk’s thickness means it doesn’t pour as easily as regular milk, so measuring by volume (like cups) is often more practical than weighing. If you’re adapting a recipe from grams or ounces, converting 160 ml of buttermilk to cups ensures consistency. This is especially useful for air fryer baking, where precise ratios affect cooking times.</p>  

<h3>UK vs. US Cup Measurements</h3>  
<p>In the UK, 1 cup equals 284 ml, making 160 ml of buttermilk roughly 0.68 cups. In the US, where 1 cup is 240 ml, it’s about 0.67 cups. This small difference rarely impacts recipes, but for perfectionists, sticking to your region’s standard avoids guesswork. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> specify measurements for both systems.</p>  

<h2>How to Measure 160 ml of Buttermilk Without a Scale</h2>  
<p>No measuring jug? Use a standard tablespoon: 1 UK tablespoon holds 15 ml, so 160 ml of buttermilk is roughly 10.5 tablespoons. For US tablespoons (14.8 ml), it’s about 10.8 tablespoons. Alternatively, fill a liquid measuring cup to the 2/3-cup mark and remove a teaspoon to approximate 160 ml.</p>  

<p>For thicker batters, like those in <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>air fryer cakes</a>, slightly rounded measurements work fine. But for delicate recipes, such as buttermilk marinades or dressings, precision matters. Always stir buttermilk before measuring to ensure an even consistency.</p>

<p>160 ml of buttermilk equals approximately 0.68 cups in the UK or 0.67 cups in the US. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precision ensures the perfect texture and rise. Whether you’re baking fluffy pancakes or tender fried chicken, knowing how many cups is 160 ml of buttermilk makes all the difference.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Buttermilk Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of buttermilk ensures your air fryer recipes turn out just right. Too little can leave baked goods dry, while too much may make them soggy. For dishes like buttermilk fried chicken or air fryer scones, 160 ml of buttermilk provides the ideal acidity and moisture balance. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more handy measurement tips.</p>  

<p>Buttermilk’s thickness means it doesn’t pour as easily as regular milk, so measuring by volume (like cups) is often more practical than weighing. If you’re adapting a recipe from grams or ounces, converting 160 ml of buttermilk to cups ensures consistency. This is especially useful for air fryer baking, where precise ratios affect cooking times.</p>  

<h3>UK vs. US Cup Measurements</h3>  
<p>In the UK, 1 cup equals 284 ml, making 160 ml of buttermilk roughly 0.68 cups. In the US, where 1 cup is 240 ml, it’s about 0.67 cups. This small difference rarely impacts recipes, but for perfectionists, sticking to your region’s standard avoids guesswork. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> specify measurements for both systems.</p>  

<h2>How to Measure 160 ml of Buttermilk Without a Scale</h2>  
<p>No measuring jug? Use a standard tablespoon: 1 UK tablespoon holds 15 ml, so 160 ml of buttermilk is roughly 10.5 tablespoons. For US tablespoons (14.8 ml), it’s about 10.8 tablespoons. Alternatively, fill a liquid measuring cup to the 2/3-cup mark and remove a teaspoon to approximate 160 ml.</p>  

<p>For thicker batters, like those in <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>air fryer cakes</a>, slightly rounded measurements work fine. But for delicate recipes, such as buttermilk marinades or dressings, precision matters. Always stir buttermilk before measuring to ensure an even consistency.</p>  

<h3>Converting Other Buttermilk Amounts</h3>  
<p>Need to scale up or down? Here’s a quick reference: 80 ml = ~1/3 cup, 240 ml = ~1 cup (UK) or 1.01 cups (US). Bookmark our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a> for easy access. Remember, air fryer recipes often require less liquid than oven-baked ones due to faster cooking times.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for 160 ml of Buttermilk in Air Fryers</h2>  
<p>This quantity is perfect for coating 4–6 chicken pieces or mixing a batch of 8–10 pancakes. Try it in <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/breakfast>air fryer breakfast recipes</a> like fluffy biscuits or tangy cornbread. Buttermilk’s acidity also tenderizes meats, making it a star in marinades for air-fried chicken or pork.</p>  

<p>For cleaning your air fryer, a mix of 160 ml buttermilk and baking soda can help loosen grease (rinse thoroughly afterward!). Explore our guide on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner</a> solutions for more tips.</p>

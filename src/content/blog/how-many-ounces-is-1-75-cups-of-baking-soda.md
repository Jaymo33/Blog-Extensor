<p>1.75 cups of baking soda equals approximately 14 ounces. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes, where precise measurements can make all the difference. Whether you're baking, cleaning, or experimenting with new dishes, knowing how to convert cups to ounces ensures consistency. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we focus on making cooking simpler with accurate conversions and delicious recipes.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of baking soda can affect texture, rise, and even taste in air fryer recipes. Too much or too little can throw off the balance, especially in baked goods like cakes or cookies. For example, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer cake recipes</a> rely on precise measurements for perfect results. Even cleaning your air fryer with baking soda requires the correct ratio to avoid residue. That’s why converting 1.75 cups of baking soda to ounces (14 oz) is so useful.</p>  

<p>If you're scaling a recipe or adjusting portion sizes, knowing this conversion saves time and hassle. A digital kitchen scale can help verify weights, but memorising common conversions like this one simplifies the process. For more handy measurement tips, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>  

<h3>How to measure baking soda correctly</h3>  
<p>When measuring baking soda, always use dry measuring cups and level off the top with a straight edge. Scooping directly from the container can compact the powder, leading to inaccurate amounts. For 1.75 cups, fill the cup to the brim and level it twice, then measure half a cup and level again. This ensures you get exactly 14 ounces of baking soda for your air fryer recipes.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for baking soda in air fryers</h2>  
<p>Baking soda isn’t just for baking—it’s a versatile ingredient in air fryer cooking. From crispy coatings to odour neutralisers, it has multiple uses. For instance, a pinch of baking soda in <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/potatoes>air fryer potato recipes</a> can enhance crispiness. It also helps tenderise meats or balance acidity in marinades. And when it’s time to clean, baking soda mixed with water makes a gentle scrub for your air fryer basket.</p>  

<p>If you’re using 1.75 cups (14 oz) of baking soda for cleaning, mix it with warm water to form a paste. Apply it to stubborn grease spots, let it sit, then wipe clean. For more deep-cleaning tips, visit our guide on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner solutions</a>.</p>  

<h3>Converting other baking soda amounts</h3>  
<p>Need to adjust your recipe? Here are quick conversions for common baking soda amounts: 1 cup = 8 oz, 0.5 cup = 4 oz, and 2 cups = 16 oz. Memorising these makes scaling recipes effortless. Whether you’re making <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cookies>air fryer cookies</a> or prepping a marinade, accurate measurements guarantee success.</p>

<h2>How to measure peanut butter accurately</h2>
<p>Measuring sticky ingredients like peanut butter can be tricky. Here are some pro tips to get your 1.5 tablespoons (24 grams) measured perfectly every time:</p>
<h3>Using measuring spoons</h3>
<p>For the most accurate 1.5 tbsp peanut butter measurement, use proper measuring spoons rather than regular cutlery. Level off each tablespoon with a straight edge for precision. Remember that 1.5 tablespoons equals 1 tablespoon plus half a tablespoon - not three half-tablespoons. This method works well for most <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cookies>cookie recipes</a> in your air fryer.</p>

<h3>Weighing with kitchen scales</h3>
<p>The most accurate way to measure 1.5 tbsp peanut butter in grams is using digital kitchen scales. Simply place your bowl on the scales, tare to zero, then add peanut butter until you reach 24 grams. This method eliminates any packing differences and gives you the exact amount needed for air fryer cooking.</p>

<h2>Peanut butter conversions for common air fryer recipes</h2>
<p>Now that you know 1.5 tbsp equals 24 grams, here's how this measurement fits into popular air fryer dishes:</p>
<p>For air fryer peanut butter cookies, you'll typically need about 48 grams (3 tbsp) of peanut butter per batch. Our conversion means this equals exactly two portions of 1.5 tbsp (24 grams each). When making satay sauce for <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>air fryer chicken</a>, 1.5 tablespoons (24 grams) makes enough sauce for 2-3 servings. Remember to clean your air fryer after cooking with sticky ingredients using our recommended <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning methods</a>.</p>

<h2>Adjusting recipes between volume and weight</h2>
<p>Many older recipes use tablespoons while modern ones prefer grams. Knowing that 1.5 tbsp peanut butter equals 24 grams helps bridge this gap. Here's why weight measurements are often better:</p>
<p>Weight measurements account for how ingredients are packed into measuring spoons. A heaped tablespoon of peanut butter could weigh significantly more than a level one, while grams remain consistent. This precision is particularly important in air fryer cooking where even heating requires consistent ingredient ratios.

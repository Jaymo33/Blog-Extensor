<p>1 tablespoon (tbsp) of plain flour weighs approximately 8 grams in the UK. This measurement is essential for baking and cooking, especially when using an air fryer where precision can affect texture and cooking times. Whether you're following a recipe from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> or converting measurements, knowing this conversion ensures consistent results every time.</p>

<h2>Why accurate flour measurements matter</h2>
<p>Using the correct amount of plain flour is crucial for successful baking and air frying. Too much flour can make baked goods dense, while too little may cause them to collapse. Many air fryer recipes, like those in our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipes collection</a>, rely on precise measurements for perfect texture. The 8-gram conversion for 1 tbsp of plain flour helps maintain this balance.</p>
<p>Different types of flour have varying weights, but plain flour (also called all-purpose flour) is the standard for most UK baking. When preparing air fryer cakes or cookies from our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>cake recipes</a>, this tablespoon-to-gram conversion ensures your treats turn out light and fluffy. Always spoon flour into your measuring tablespoon and level it off for accuracy.</p>

<h2>How to measure plain flour correctly</h2>
<p>The method you use to measure flour significantly affects the weight. Scooping directly from the bag packs the flour too densely, while spooning it in gives a more accurate measurement. For the standard 8 grams per tablespoon, gently spoon flour into the measuring spoon until heaping, then level off with a straight edge.</p>
<p>Many bakers prefer weighing ingredients for complete precision. If your air fryer recipe calls for multiple tablespoons, it's often easier to use scales. For example, 4 tablespoons of plain flour would be 32 grams. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a> includes other common baking measurements to simplify your cooking process.</p>

<h3>Converting larger quantities</h3>
<p>When scaling up recipes, the 1 tbsp to 8 grams conversion becomes even more valuable. For Â½ cup of plain flour (about 8 tablespoons), you'd need approximately 64 grams. This consistency is particularly important for air fryer baking, where even small measurement variations can affect how heat circulates around your food.</p>

<h3>UK vs US measurements</h3>
<p>It's worth noting that UK and US tablespoons differ slightly in volume. A UK tablespoon holds 15ml, while a US tablespoon is about 14.8ml. However, for plain flour, this small difference typically results in less than a 0.5 gram variation, so the 8-gram standard works well for both.</p>

<h2>Common uses for 1 tbsp of plain flour</h2>
<p>Many air fryer recipes use small amounts of plain flour for coating or thickening. When making crispy <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipes</a>, a light dusting of flour (about 1 tbsp per portion) helps create that perfect golden crust. Similarly, sauces for air fryer dishes often begin with a roux using 1 tbsp each of flour and fat.</p>
<p>For those watching portion sizes, knowing that 1 tbsp equals 8 grams helps with nutritional tracking. Whether you're preparing a single-serving air fryer dessert or coating vegetables from our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable recipes</a>, accurate flour measurements contribute to better cooking results and more consistent calorie counts.</p>

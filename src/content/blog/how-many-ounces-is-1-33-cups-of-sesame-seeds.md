<p>1.33 cups of sesame seeds equals approximately 6.5 ounces. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements ensure perfect results. Whether you're making sesame-crusted chicken or a crunchy topping for salads, knowing the weight helps avoid over or under-seasoning. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we focus on accuracy to elevate your cooking game. Let’s dive deeper into conversions and uses for sesame seeds in your air fryer.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on even heat distribution, so ingredient proportions can make or break a dish. Too many sesame seeds might burn, while too few won’t deliver the desired crunch. Converting 1.33 cups of sesame seeds to ounces (6.5 oz) ensures consistency. For more conversion help, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>. Whether you're cooking sesame-coated tofu or crispy shrimp, precision is key.</p>  

<p>Sesame seeds add texture and nutty flavour to air-fried dishes like chicken or salmon. Measuring by weight (ounces) is often more reliable than volume (cups), especially for small seeds. If you’re scaling a recipe from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>our collection</a>, always double-check conversions. A kitchen scale is a worthwhile investment for air fryer enthusiasts who love experimenting with coatings and toppings.</p>  

<h3>How to measure sesame seeds without a scale</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a scale, use the spoon-and-level method for cups. Lightly spoon sesame seeds into a measuring cup and level off the top—don’t pack them down. Remember, 1.33 cups of sesame seeds equals roughly 6.5 ounces. For UK cooks, this conversion stays the same, as fluid ounces and weight ounces differ only for liquids. Need more tips? Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>sesame chicken recipes</a> showcase perfect measurements in action.</p>  

<h2>Best air fryer recipes using sesame seeds</h2>  
<p>Sesame seeds shine in air fryer dishes, from crispy coatings to garnishes. Try them on salmon fillets, tofu bites, or even homemade crackers. Since 1.33 cups of sesame seeds converts to 6.5 ounces, you can adjust batch sizes easily. Visit <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> for inspiration, like sesame-crusted cod or honey-glazed sesame chicken. The seeds toast beautifully in the air fryer, enhancing flavour without extra oil.</p>  

<p>For meal prep, portion sesame seeds in advance using ounce measurements. Pre-measured 6.5-ounce batches (1.33 cups) save time during busy weeknights. Store seeds in an airtight container to maintain freshness. If you’re cleaning your air fryer after sesame-heavy recipes, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning guide</a> helps remove stubborn residue. Sesame seeds are versatile, but accurate measurements ensure they’re used to their full potential.</p>  

<h3>Common mistakes when measuring sesame seeds</h3>  
<p>Overpacking cups is a frequent error—sesame seeds should sit loosely for accurate volume-to-weight conversions. Another pitfall is assuming US and UK cup sizes differ; they don’t, so 1.33 cups of sesame seeds equals 6.5 ounces in both. Always use standard measuring cups, not mugs or guesswork. For recipes like sesame-crusted lamb or veggies, precision ensures even cooking and perfect texture every time.</p>

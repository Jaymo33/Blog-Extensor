<p>To reheat scampi in an air fryer, preheat to 160°C and cook for 3-5 minutes until piping hot and crispy. This method beats microwaving hands down, as it restores texture without drying out your seafood. Whether you’ve got leftover pub-style scampi or homemade breaded prawns, your air fryer’s rapid hot air circulation works wonders.</p>

<h2>Why Use an Air Fryer to Reheat Scampi?</h2>
<p>Air fryers excel at reheating breaded foods like scampi because they circulate heat evenly, crisping the coating while keeping the interior tender. Unlike microwaves, which can turn scampi rubbery, or ovens, which take longer, air fryers deliver quick, consistent results. If you’ve ever wondered <a href="https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes">how to revive takeaway scampi</a>, this is your answer. The process locks in moisture better than any other reheating method, making it ideal for delicate seafood.</p>
<p>Another advantage is portion control. Air fryers allow you to reheat small batches, ensuring every piece gets evenly crisped. For those who meal-prep scampi or enjoy <a href="https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/shrimp">shrimp-based dishes</a>, this appliance is a game-changer. Plus, cleanup is a breeze compared to splattering oil in a pan—just pop the basket in the dishwasher or give it a quick wipe with <a href="https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner">air fryer cleaner</a>.</p>

<h2>Step-by-Step Guide to Reheating Scampi</h2>
<h3>Preheating Your Air Fryer</h3>
<p>Always preheat your air fryer to 160°C for 3 minutes before adding scampi. This ensures even cooking from the moment the food hits the basket. Skipping this step can lead to uneven reheating, with some pieces staying cold while others overcook. If your model doesn’t have a preheat function, simply run it empty at the target temperature.</p>

<h3>Arranging Scampi for Best Results</h3>
<p>Spread scampi in a single layer with space between each piece—overcrowding causes steaming instead of crisping. For extra crunch, lightly spritz with oil or place a perforated parchment liner underneath. Frozen scampi? No need to thaw; just add 1-2 minutes to the cooking time. Check out our <a href="https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart">air fryer conversion chart</a> for adapting oven instructions.</p>

<h2>Optimal Temperature and Timing</h2>
<p>The sweet spot for reheating scampi is 160°C (320°F) for 3-5 minutes. At this temperature, the breadcrumb coating regains its crunch without burning, while the prawn inside heats through gently. For thicker, pub-style scampi, lean toward 5 minutes; for lighter tempura versions, 3 minutes suffices. Always shake the basket halfway to ensure even exposure to the air flow.</p>
<p>If your scampi was refrigerated, let it sit at room temperature for 10 minutes first. This reduces the reheating time needed and prevents the exterior from overbrowning. For those who love extra crispiness, a 30-second blast at 180°C at the end can work wonders—just keep a close eye to avoid charring.</p>

<h2>Troubleshooting Common Issues</h2>
<h3>Dry or Tough Scampi</h3>
<p>If your reheated scampi turns out dry, the temperature was likely too high. Next time, try 150°C and add a teaspoon of water to the air fryer drawer (not the basket) to create steam. Another trick is to cover the scampi loosely with foil for the first half of cooking, then remove it to crisp up.</p>

<h3>Soggy Coating</h3>
<p>Sogginess usually means overcrowding or insufficient preheating. Ensure your air fryer isn’t overloaded, and consider using the rack accessory if your model includes one. For particularly stubborn cases, a light dusting of cornflour before reheating can absorb excess moisture.</p>

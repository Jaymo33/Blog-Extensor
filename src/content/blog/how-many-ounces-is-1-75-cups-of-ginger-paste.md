<p>1.75 cups of ginger paste equals approximately 14 ounces (oz) in weight. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precision ensures perfect results. Whether you’re making marinades, sauces, or spicing up dishes, knowing the exact weight helps avoid over or under-seasoning. For more air fryer measurement tips, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on even heat distribution, so ingredient proportions can affect texture and flavour. Too much ginger paste might overpower a dish, while too little could leave it bland. Measuring 1.75 cups of ginger paste in ounces ensures consistency, especially for batch cooking or meal prep. If you love experimenting with flavours, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> for inspiration.</p>  

<p>Ginger paste is denser than liquids like water, so volume-to-weight conversions aren’t always intuitive. A standard US cup holds 8 fluid ounces, but ginger paste weighs more due to its thick consistency. That’s why 1.75 cups of ginger paste translates to roughly 14 oz, not 14 fluid ounces. Always use a kitchen scale for the most accurate results.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure Ginger Paste Without a Scale</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a scale, use the spoon-and-level method for ginger paste. Fill a measuring cup with spoons, then level it off with a knife. Remember, 1.75 cups of ginger paste to oz is about 14 oz, but slight variations can occur based on paste thickness. For sticky ingredients like ginger paste, lightly greasing the measuring cup helps with clean removal.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for Ginger Paste in Air Fryer Recipes</h2>  
<p>Ginger paste adds depth to marinades, glazes, and sauces in air fryer cooking. From <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>ginger-glazed chicken</a> to vegetable stir-fries, it’s a versatile ingredient. Knowing that 1.75 cups of ginger paste equals 14 oz helps scale recipes up or down. Pre-measured portions also save time during busy weeknights.</p>  

<p>For frozen foods like dumplings or spring rolls, a ginger-based dipping sauce elevates the dish. Combine 1.75 cups (14 oz) of ginger paste with soy sauce, garlic, and honey for a quick condiment. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/frozen-foods>frozen foods section</a> for more easy ideas.</p>  

<h3>Converting Ginger Paste for Different Recipes</h3>  
<p>Some recipes list ginger paste in tablespoons or grams. Here’s a quick reference: 1.75 cups of ginger paste is 14 oz, 28 tablespoons, or roughly 397 grams. Adjust smaller quantities proportionally—for example, 0.5 cups equals 4 oz. Keep conversions handy for international recipes or when substituting fresh ginger.</p>  

<h2>Storing Ginger Paste for Air Fryer Meals</h2>  
<p>Pre-measured ginger paste saves time. Portion 1.75 cups (14 oz) into ice cube trays or small jars for future use. Label containers with weights to avoid confusion. Proper storage prevents waste and keeps flavours fresh. For tips on maintaining your appliance, see our guide on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning your air fryer</a>.</p>  

<p>Ginger paste lasts up to 3 months in the freezer or 3 weeks refrigerated. If a recipe calls for 1.75 cups of ginger paste in ounces (14 oz), thaw only what you need. Freezing in ounce-sized portions streamlines cooking and reduces mess.

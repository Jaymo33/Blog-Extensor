<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on even heat distribution, so ingredient proportions can affect texture and flavour. Too much ginger paste might overpower a dish, while too little could leave it bland.

<p>Ginger paste is denser than liquids like water, so volume-to-weight conversions aren’t always intuitive. A standard US cup holds 8 fluid ounces, but ginger paste weighs more due to its thick consistency. That’s why 1.75 cups of ginger paste translates to roughly 14 oz, not 14 fluid ounces. Always use a kitchen scale for the most accurate results.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure Ginger Paste Without a Scale</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a scale, use the spoon-and-level method for ginger paste. Fill a measuring cup with spoons, then level it off with a knife. Remember, 1.75 cups of ginger paste to oz is about 14 oz, but slight variations can occur based on paste thickness. For sticky ingredients like ginger paste, lightly greasing the measuring cup helps with clean removal.</p>

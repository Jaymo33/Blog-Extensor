<p>5g of rice equals approximately 0.176 ounces. This conversion is essential for precise cooking, especially when using an air fryer where accurate measurements can make all the difference. Whether you’re meal prepping or following a recipe from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, knowing how to convert grams to ounces ensures perfect results every time.</p>

<h2>Why converting 5g of rice to ounces matters</h2>  
<p>Accurate measurements are crucial in cooking, particularly when using an air fryer. A slight variation in ingredient quantities can affect texture and cooking time. Converting 5g of rice to ounces (0.176 oz) helps you follow recipes precisely, whether you’re making a quick side dish or a full meal. Many UK recipes, especially those on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes</a>, use grams, but understanding ounces can be handy for older cookbooks or international recipes.</p>  
<p>Rice is a staple in many air fryer dishes, from crispy rice cakes to stuffed peppers. Knowing the exact weight ensures consistency. For example, if a recipe calls for 5g of rice per portion, you’ll now know that’s roughly 0.176 ounces. This precision is especially useful for meal prep, where portion control is key.

<h2>How to measure 5g of rice without scales</h2>  
<p>Not everyone has kitchen scales handy, but there are easy ways to estimate 5g of rice. A level teaspoon holds about 5g of uncooked rice, which translates to 0.176 ounces. This method is handy for quick measurements when you’re mid-recipe. Remember, though, that this is an approximation—for baking or precise air fryer recipes, scales are best.</p>  
<p>Another trick is to use a standard UK penny as a reference. A stack of five 1p coins weighs roughly 5g, so you can balance your rice against them. This is a handy hack if you’re cooking on the go or don’t have measuring spoons.

<h3>Common uses for 5g of rice in air fryer recipes</h3>  
<p>5g of rice might seem small, but it’s perfect for individual portions or as a base for air fryer dishes. Try it in stuffed mushrooms or as a crispy topping for salads. Many recipes on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> use small quantities of rice for texture and bulk without overpowering other ingredients.</p>  

<h2>Converting other rice quantities from grams to ounces</h2>  
<p>Once you’ve mastered 5g of rice (0.176 oz), you can scale up or down. For example, 10g is 0.352 oz, and 20g is 0.705 oz. This knowledge is invaluable when adapting recipes for your air fryer. Whether you’re cooking for one or a family, precise conversions ensure consistent results.</p>  
<p>If you’re working with larger quantities, remember that 100g of rice equals 3.527 ounces. This is useful for batch cooking or meal prep.

<h3>Tips for cooking rice in an air fryer</h3>  
<p>Rice cooks differently in an air fryer than on the stove. For best results, pre-soak your rice (even just 5g) for 10 minutes to ensure even cooking. A light spray of oil prevents sticking and adds crispiness where desired. Always check your air fryer’s manual for specific rice-cooking settings.</p>

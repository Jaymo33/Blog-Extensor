<h2>How to Measure 30g of Rice Accurately</h2>  
<p>Measuring 30g of rice doesn’t require a scale if you don’t have one. A standard UK tablespoon holds about 15g of uncooked rice, so two level tablespoons equal 30g. For ounces, this translates to just over one ounce. If you’re using a measuring cup, 30g is roughly 1/8 of a cup.</p>

<h3>Does Rice Type Affect the Weight?</h3>  
<p>Different rice varieties, like basmati or jasmine, have slightly varying densities. However, the difference in weight per volume is minimal for most home cooking. Whether you’re converting 30g of rice to ounces for white, brown, or wild rice, the 1.06-ounce approximation holds true.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for 30g of Rice in Air Fryers</h2>

<p>1 cup of tomato ketchup equals approximately 8.5 ounces. This measurement is crucial when preparing sauces, glazes, or marinades for your air fryer recipes. Getting the quantities right ensures consistent flavour and texture in dishes like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer chicken wings</a> or homemade burgers.</p>

<h2>Why accurate ketchup measurements matter</h2>
<p>When cooking with an air fryer, precise ingredient ratios make all the difference. Too much tomato ketchup in a marinade can make food soggy, while too little might leave it lacking flavour. Many popular <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipes</a> call for specific amounts of ketchup to achieve that perfect sticky glaze.</p>
<p>The density of tomato ketchup means it doesn't follow the standard liquid conversion of 1 cup = 8 fluid ounces. Its thicker consistency results in slightly more weight per volume. This is why weighing ingredients often yields better results than volume measurements alone.</p>

<h2>Converting cups to ounces for ketchup</h2>
<p>For most cooking applications, you can use the standard conversion of 1 cup tomato ketchup = 8.5 ounces. This measurement works well whether you're making <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable dips</a> or basting meats. Keep in mind that different brands may vary slightly in thickness.</p>
<p>If you need smaller quantities, here are some helpful conversions: ½ cup = 4.25 ounces, ¼ cup = 2.125 ounces. These measurements come in handy when adjusting recipe portions for your air fryer's capacity.</p>

<h3>Measuring ketchup without scales</h3>
<p>No kitchen scales? No problem. You can measure tomato ketchup by volume using standard cups and spoons. A packed, level cup of ketchup will give you roughly 8.5 ounces. For smaller amounts, remember that 1 tablespoon equals about 0.5 ounces of ketchup.</p>

<h2>Using ketchup in air fryer recipes</h2>
<p>Tomato ketchup forms the base of many delicious air fryer sauces and glazes. From <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/beef>beef meatballs</a> to vegetable stir-fries, knowing your measurements ensures perfect results every time. The high heat of air frying caramelises the sugars in ketchup beautifully.</p>
<p>When substituting ketchup in recipes, remember that 8.5 ounces equals 1 cup. This conversion is particularly useful when scaling recipes up or down to suit your air fryer's size. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a> can help with other common ingredient measurements too.</p>

<h3>Storing leftover ketchup</h3>
<p>After measuring out your 1 cup (8.5 ounces) of ketchup, store any leftovers properly. Keep opened bottles refrigerated and use within six months for best quality. Always check for signs of spoilage before using in your air fryer creations.</p>

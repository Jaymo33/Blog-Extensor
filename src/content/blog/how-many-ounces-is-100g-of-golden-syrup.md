<p>100g of golden syrup equals approximately 3.53 ounces. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes, where precise measurements can make or break your dish.

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer recipes</h2>  
<p>Golden syrup is a staple in many British desserts and sauces, and its thick consistency means even small weight variations can affect texture. In an air fryer, where heat distribution is rapid, precise measurements prevent overcooking or uneven results. For example, adding too much syrup to a cake batter can make it overly dense. Conversely, too little might leave your glaze lacking sweetness.

<h3>Tips for storing golden syrup</h3>

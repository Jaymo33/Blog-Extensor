<p>100g of golden syrup equals approximately 3.53 ounces. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes, where precise measurements can make or break your dish. Whether you're making sticky toffee pudding or glazing roasted vegetables, knowing the exact weight ensures consistency. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we focus on accuracy to help you achieve the best results every time.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer recipes</h2>  
<p>Golden syrup is a staple in many British desserts and sauces, and its thick consistency means even small weight variations can affect texture. In an air fryer, where heat distribution is rapid, precise measurements prevent overcooking or uneven results. For example, adding too much syrup to a cake batter can make it overly dense. Conversely, too little might leave your glaze lacking sweetness. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more handy measurement tips.</p>  

<p>Many air fryer recipes, especially those for cakes or glazes, rely on golden syrup for moisture and flavour. If you're adapting a traditional recipe for the air fryer, converting grams to ounces ensures you stay true to the original. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipes section</a> includes plenty of ideas where golden syrup plays a starring role, from flapjacks to marinades.</p>  

<h2>How to measure golden syrup accurately</h2>  
<p>Measuring sticky ingredients like golden syrup can be tricky. To get 100g (or 3.53 ounces), lightly grease your measuring spoon or cup to help the syrup slide out easily. Alternatively, use a digital kitchen scale for precision. If you're working with smaller quantities, remember that 1 tablespoon of golden syrup weighs roughly 25g (0.88 ounces).</p>  

<h3>Common uses for golden syrup in air fryer cooking</h3>  
<p>Golden syrup adds a rich, caramel-like sweetness to both sweet and savoury dishes. Try it in air-fried sticky ribs, drizzled over roasted carrots, or as a key ingredient in treacle tart. For more inspiration, browse our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert category</a>, packed with recipes that highlight this versatile ingredient.</p>  

<h2>Converting other golden syrup quantities</h2>  
<p>Need to adjust your recipe? Here are some common conversions: 50g equals 1.76 ounces, and 200g equals 7.05 ounces. Keeping these figures handy saves time and reduces errors. If you're scaling up a batch of cookies or cakes, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner guide</a> ensures easy cleanup after sticky baking sessions.</p>  

<h3>Tips for storing golden syrup</h3>  
<p>Store golden syrup in a cool, dry place to maintain its consistency. Once opened, it can crystallise over time, but gently warming the jar in hot water will restore its smooth texture. Avoid refrigerating, as this can thicken the syrup unnecessarily.</p>

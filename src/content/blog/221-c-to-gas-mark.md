<h2>What is 221 C in Gas Mark?</h2>
<p>221 C converts to Gas Mark 7. This is a common temperature for baking, roasting, and air frying in the UK. Whether you're using an oven or an air fryer, knowing this conversion ensures your dishes cook perfectly. Many recipes on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> use Gas Mark settings, so this conversion is handy. If you're unsure about other temperatures, check our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for quick reference.</p>
<p>Gas Mark 7 is ideal for dishes like roasted vegetables, cakes, and even some frozen foods. The air fryer's rapid air circulation mimics a fan oven, so you might need to adjust cooking times slightly. For example, a recipe calling for 221 C in a conventional oven might cook faster in an air fryer. Always keep an eye on your food to avoid overcooking. If you're new to air frying, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipes</a> section for inspiration.</p>

<h2>Why Convert 221 C to Gas Mark?</h2>
<p>Many British recipes still use Gas Mark, especially older cookbooks or family favourites. Converting 221 C to Gas Mark ensures you can follow these recipes accurately. Air fryers often display temperatures in Celsius, so knowing the Gas Mark equivalent helps bridge the gap. This is particularly useful for baking, where precise temperatures matter. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>cake recipes</a>, for instance, often specify Gas Mark for consistent results.</p>
<p>Gas Mark 7 (221 C) is a versatile setting for both sweet and savoury dishes. From crispy roast potatoes to fluffy sponge cakes, this temperature delivers reliable results. If your air fryer doesn't have a Gas Mark setting, simply set it to 221 C instead. Remember, air fryers cook faster than ovens, so reduce cooking times by 10-20%. For more tips, check our guide on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning your air fryer</a> to maintain optimal performance.</p>

<h3>How to Use 221 C in Your Air Fryer</h3>
<p>When using 221 C (Gas Mark 7) in an air fryer, preheating is key for even cooking. Most air fryers reach this temperature quickly, usually within 3-5 minutes. Place your food in the basket in a single layer for best results. This ensures proper air circulation, which is crucial for crispy textures. For baking, consider using parchment liners to prevent sticking.</p>

<h3>Common Dishes Cooked at 221 C (Gas Mark 7)</h3>
<p>This temperature works well for roasted meats, vegetables, and baked goods. Try it for chicken thighs, which come out juicy with crispy skin. It's also perfect for scones, muffins, and other quick breads. Frozen foods like chips or nuggets cook beautifully at 221 C in an air fryer. For more ideas, browse our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/frozen-foods>frozen foods</a> section.</p>

<h2>Tips for Baking at 221 C (Gas Mark 7)</h2>
<p>Baking at 221 C requires slight adjustments in an air fryer compared to an oven. Reduce the cooking time by about 15% and check for doneness early. Use oven-safe dishes or silicone moulds that fit your air fryer basket. Rotate or shake the basket halfway through cooking for even browning. Keep the air fryer clean to prevent smoke or off-flavours in delicate baked goods.</p>
<p>For cakes and pastries, consider lowering the temperature slightly if they're browning too quickly. The intense heat of an air fryer can sometimes cause uneven baking. Experiment with your favourite recipes to find the perfect timing. Many home bakers find that 221 C works brilliantly for small batches of cookies or mini cakes.

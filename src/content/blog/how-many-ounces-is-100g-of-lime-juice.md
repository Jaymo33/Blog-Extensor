<p>100g of lime juice equals approximately 3.53 ounces. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements can make all the difference. Whether you’re marinating chicken or adding a zesty kick to desserts, knowing how to convert grams to ounces ensures consistency. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we focus on making cooking simpler with accurate conversions and delicious recipes.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate lime juice measurements matter</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of lime juice can elevate your air fryer dishes, from tangy marinades to refreshing dressings. Too little, and the flavour falls flat; too much, and it overpowers the dish. Converting 100g of lime juice to ounces (3.53 oz) helps you follow recipes precisely, especially when scaling up or down. For more conversion tips, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>  

<p>Lime juice is a staple in many air fryer recipes, such as citrus-glazed salmon or zesty chicken wings. Accurate measurements ensure balanced flavours and perfect results every time. If you’re experimenting with new dishes, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a> offers plenty of inspiration.</p>  

<h3>How to measure lime juice without scales</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a kitchen scale, you can still measure 100g of lime juice (3.53 oz) using volume. One medium lime yields about 30ml (1 oz) of juice, so you’d need roughly 3-4 limes for 100g. Freshness matters—opt for plump, bright-green limes for the best flavour.

<h2>Common uses for lime juice in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Lime juice adds brightness to marinades, dressings, and even desserts. Try it in air-fried shrimp tacos or a citrusy glaze for salmon. The acidity also helps tenderise meats, making it a versatile ingredient. For a deep clean after cooking, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner guide</a> keeps your appliance spotless.</p>  

<p>Beyond savoury dishes, lime juice works wonders in air-fried desserts like key lime pie bites. The key is balancing the tartness with sweetness, and precise measurements ensure perfection.

<h3>Storing lime juice for future use</h3>  
<p>Fresh lime juice lasts about a week in the fridge, but you can freeze it in ice cube trays for longer storage. Each cube holds roughly 30ml (1 oz), making it easy to thaw the exact amount needed. This trick saves time and reduces waste, perfect for busy cooks.</p>

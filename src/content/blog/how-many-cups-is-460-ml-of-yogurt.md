<p>460 ml of yogurt is roughly 1.94 cups in the UK or 1.95 cups in the US. This conversion is handy when following recipes, especially for air fryer dishes where precise measurements matter. Whether you're making a creamy marinade or a fluffy cake, knowing how to convert ml to cups ensures your dish turns out perfectly every time.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of yogurt can make or break a recipe. Too much can make a dish soggy, while too little might leave it dry. Air fryers, like those featured on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, rely on even cooking, so precise measurements are key. Whether you're making a yogurt-based marinade for chicken or a batter for desserts, getting the conversion right ensures consistent results.</p>  

<p>Yogurt is a versatile ingredient in air fryer recipes, from tenderising meats to adding moisture to baked goods. If you're exploring new dishes, check out the <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipes section</a> for inspiration. Many recipes call for yogurt, and knowing how to measure it correctly will help you nail every dish.</p>  

<h3>UK vs. US Cup Measurements</h3>  
<p>In the UK, 1 cup equals 284 ml, while in the US, it's 240 ml. This slight difference means 460 ml of yogurt converts to about 1.94 cups in the UK and 1.95 cups in the US. For most recipes, this small variance won’t make a noticeable difference, but it’s good to be aware of it, especially if you're using an international recipe.</p>  

<h2>How to Measure Yogurt Without a Measuring Cup</h2>  
<p>If you don’t have a measuring cup handy, you can still measure 460 ml of yogurt accurately. A standard UK metric tablespoon holds 15 ml, so 30 tablespoons would give you 450 ml—close enough for most recipes. Alternatively, a kitchen scale can help; 460 ml of yogurt weighs approximately 460 grams, as yogurt has a similar density to water.</p>  

<p>For more tips on converting ingredients, take a look at the <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>. It’s a great resource for quick reference when you’re in the middle of cooking and need to double-check measurements.</p>  

<h3>Common Recipes Using 460 ml of Yogurt</h3>  
<p>Yogurt is a staple in many air fryer recipes, from marinades to desserts. A classic use is in <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipes</a>, where yogurt helps keep the meat juicy. You might also find it in cakes or muffins, where it adds moisture without making the batter too heavy.</p>  

<h2>Tips for Storing and Using Yogurt in Air Fryer Dishes</h2>  
<p>Yogurt can spoil quickly, so always check the expiry date before using it in a recipe. If you’re using Greek yogurt, remember it’s thicker than regular yogurt, so you might need to adjust liquids in your recipe. For cleaning your air fryer after cooking with yogurt, check out the <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning guide</a> to keep your appliance in top condition.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>
<p>Using the right amount of mozzarella cheese can make or break your air fryer dish. Too little, and your recipe lacks flavour; too much, and it becomes overly greasy. Air fryers cook food quickly, so precise measurements ensure even cooking. Mozzarella melts beautifully in the air fryer, making it ideal for recipes like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>cheesy garlic bread</a> or stuffed mushrooms. Always measure your ingredients for consistent results.</p>

<p>Different brands of mozzarella may vary slightly in density, so weighing your cheese is the most accurate method. However, if you don’t have scales, the cup measurement is a handy alternative.

<h3>How to Measure Mozzarella Cheese for Air Fryer Recipes</h3>
<p>If you’re using shredded mozzarella, lightly pack it into a measuring cup without pressing too hard. For block mozzarella, grate it first before measuring. This ensures an even distribution and prevents clumping during cooking. Air fryer recipes often require precise amounts to avoid overcrowding, so stick to the recommended 500 grams (or 2.5 cups) for best results.</p>

<h2>Common Air Fryer Recipes Using 500 Grams of Mozzarella Cheese</h2>
<p>One popular dish is air fryer mozzarella sticks, which use about 500 grams of cheese for a batch of 12-15 sticks. Another favourite is cheesy stuffed peppers, where the mozzarella adds a creamy texture.

<h3>Tips for Storing Mozzarella Cheese</h3>
<p>Keep mozzarella cheese in its original packaging or wrap it tightly in cling film to prevent drying out. If you’ve shredded it, store it in a sealed container in the fridge for up to five days. For longer storage, freeze the cheese in portions, but note that freezing may slightly alter its texture when thawed.</p>

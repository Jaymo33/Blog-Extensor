<p>10 ml of single cream is approximately 0.042 cups (or roughly 1/24 of a cup). This small measurement is crucial for precision in recipes, especially when using an air fryer where exact quantities can affect texture and flavour.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>When using an air fryer, precise measurements ensure even cooking and perfect results. Too much or too little single cream can alter the consistency of sauces, batters, or toppings. For example, adding 10 ml of single cream to a cake batter requires accuracy to avoid a soggy or dry outcome.</p>  
<p>Many air fryer recipes, like those on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, rely on small quantities of liquids. Converting 10 ml of single cream to cups helps streamline the process, especially if you're scaling recipes up or down.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure 10 ml of Single Cream Without a Scale</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a measuring jug or scale, use a teaspoon—10 ml is roughly two level teaspoons. For cups, fill a standard 240 ml cup to just under 1/24th of its capacity. Alternatively, check our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for quick reference.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for 10 ml of Single Cream</h2>  
<p>This small amount is often used in air fryer desserts, like custards or glazes. It’s also perfect for enriching sauces in dishes like creamy mushrooms or chicken. Visit <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert recipes</a> for inspiration.</p>  
<p>In baking, 10 ml of single cream can be brushed over pastries for a golden finish. It’s also handy for thinning out thick batters without making them runny.</p>  

<h3>Converting 10 ml of Single Cream for US and UK Recipes</h3>  
<p>Both US and UK cups measure 240 ml, so 10 ml converts the same. However, always check if a recipe uses metric or imperial measurements to avoid errors. For more tips, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning guide</a> to keep your air fryer in top shape.</p>  

<h2>Tips for Working with Small Quantities</h2>  
<p>Use a syringe or dropper for exact 10 ml measurements. For larger batches, multiply the conversion (e.g., 100 ml = ~0.42 cups). Store leftover single cream in an airtight container for up to three days.</p>

<h2>Why convert 250g of balsamic vinegar to ounces?</h2>

<p>Air fryers excel at delivering crispy, evenly cooked meals, but only if you measure ingredients correctly. A slight miscalculation in liquid measurements like balsamic vinegar can affect texture and flavour.

This knowledge is particularly useful when scaling recipes up or down.</p>

<h3>How to measure 250g of balsamic vinegar accurately</h3>
<p>To measure 250g of balsamic vinegar, use a digital kitchen scale for the most accurate results. Place your measuring jug on the scale, tare it to zero, then pour the vinegar until it reaches 250g. If you don’t have a scale, 250g is roughly equivalent to 250ml, as balsamic vinegar has a similar density to water. For ounces, this works out to 8.82 oz, which you can measure using a liquid measuring cup with ounce markings.</p>

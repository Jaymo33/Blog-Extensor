<p>0.125 cup of tahini equals approximately 1 ounce. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements can make all the difference. Whether you're making dips, dressings, or marinades, knowing how many ounces are in 0.125 cup of tahini ensures your dishes turn out perfectly every time.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on precise ingredient ratios to achieve the best texture and flavour. Using too much or too little tahini can affect the consistency of your dish. For example, a tahini-based sauce might become too thick or too runny if the measurements are off. That’s why converting 0.125 cup of tahini to ounces is so important.</p>  
<p>If you’re new to air fryer cooking, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for other common measurements. It’s a handy tool to keep in your kitchen for quick reference. You’ll also find plenty of inspiration in our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a>, where tahini is often used in delicious, healthy meals.</p>  

<h2>How to Measure 0.125 Cup of Tahini</h2>  
<p>Measuring tahini can be tricky due to its thick, sticky consistency. To get an accurate 0.125 cup (which is 1 ounce), use a measuring spoon or a kitchen scale. A scale is especially helpful if you’re working with small quantities like 0.125 cup of tahini, as it eliminates guesswork.</p>  

<h3>Using a Kitchen Scale</h3>  
<p>Place your bowl or container on the scale, tare it to zero, and then add tahini until it reaches 1 ounce. This method is foolproof and ensures you’re using the exact amount needed for your recipe. If you don’t have a scale, two tablespoons of tahini will roughly equal 0.125 cup or 1 ounce.</p>  

<h2>Common Recipes Using 0.125 Cup of Tahini</h2>  
<p>Many air fryer recipes call for small amounts of tahini, such as 0.125 cup. This versatile ingredient is perfect for dressings, marinades, and even desserts. For example, you might use it in a tahini-glazed salmon or a creamy tahini dip for roasted vegetables.</p>  
<p>Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/salmon>salmon recipes</a> or <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable dishes</a> for ideas.

<h2>Tips for Storing and Using Tahini</h2>  
<p>Tahini can separate over time, so always stir it well before measuring 0.125 cup. Store it in a cool, dark place to maintain its freshness. If you’re using tahini frequently, consider keeping it in the fridge to extend its shelf life.</p>  
<p>Cleaning your air fryer after cooking with tahini is also important.

<p>1.75 cups of fish sauce equals approximately 14 ounces. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements can make or break a dish. Whether you’re marinating chicken or adding depth to a stir-fry, knowing the exact weight ensures consistency. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we help simplify these conversions so you can focus on cooking. Let’s dive deeper into why accurate measurements matter and how to apply them.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of fish sauce can elevate your air fryer dishes from good to great. Too little, and the flavour falls flat; too much, and it overpowers the dish. Fish sauce is a potent ingredient, so 1.75 cups (or 14 ounces) should be measured carefully. Many air fryer recipes, like those in our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipes section</a>, rely on precise liquid measurements for balanced taste. A kitchen scale can help, but cup-to-ounce conversions are handy when you’re in a pinch.</p>  

<p>Fish sauce is a staple in Southeast Asian cuisine, often used in marinades, dips, and sauces. When adapting these recipes for the air fryer, accuracy ensures the flavours shine. For example, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipes</a> often call for fish sauce to add umami depth. Measuring 1.75 cups correctly means your dish will have the perfect salty-savory balance. No one wants a meal that’s too salty or bland!</p>  

<h3>How to Measure Fish Sauce Without a Scale</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a kitchen scale, use liquid measuring cups for fish sauce. A standard US cup holds 8 fluid ounces, so 1.75 cups equal 14 fluid ounces. However, fish sauce is denser than water, so weight may vary slightly. For UK cooks, 1.75 cups convert to roughly 14 ounces by volume. Check our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a> for other common measurements. Always level off the cup for accuracy—no heaping!</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for 1.75 Cups of Fish Sauce in Air Fryer Recipes</h2>  
<p>This quantity is ideal for batch cooking or marinating larger portions. For instance, 1.75 cups (14 ounces) of fish sauce can season a whole chicken or a big batch of shrimp. Try it in our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/shrimp>shrimp recipes</a> for a quick, flavourful meal. The air fryer locks in moisture, so the fish sauce infuses the protein beautifully. Just remember to pat excess marinade off before cooking to avoid splattering.</p>  

<p>Fish sauce also works wonders in vegetable dishes. Toss 1.75 cups with roasted Brussels sprouts or cauliflower for a savoury kick. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable recipes</a> showcase how versatile this ingredient can be. Since air fryers cook quickly, the fish sauce caramelises slightly, adding depth without overpowering. Cleanup is easy too—just use our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner guide</a> to keep your appliance spotless.</p>  

<h3>Storing Leftover Fish Sauce</h3>  
<p>Once opened, fish sauce lasts up to a year in the fridge. If you’ve measured out 1.75 cups but only used half, transfer the rest to an airtight container. Glass jars work best to prevent odours. Proper storage ensures your next air fryer meal tastes just as good as the first.

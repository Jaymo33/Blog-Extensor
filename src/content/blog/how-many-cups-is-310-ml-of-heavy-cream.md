<p>310 ml of heavy cream is approximately 1.31 cups. This conversion is essential for precise baking and cooking, especially when using an air fryer. Whether you're whipping up a creamy dessert or a savoury sauce, knowing the exact measurement ensures perfect results every time.</p>

<h2>Understanding the Conversion</h2>
<p>Converting millilitres to cups can be tricky, especially with ingredients like heavy cream. The density of heavy cream means it doesn't always match the standard liquid conversion. For accuracy, 310 ml of heavy cream equals roughly 1.31 cups. This measurement is crucial for recipes where precision matters, such as those found on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>.</p>
<p>If you're working with a recipe that calls for 310 ml of heavy cream, using a measuring cup is the easiest way to get it right. A liquid measuring cup with millilitre markings will give you the most accurate result. For those without one, knowing that 1 cup is about 237 ml helps you estimate the 1.31 cups needed.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter</h2>
<p>Heavy cream is a key ingredient in many air fryer recipes, from creamy pasta dishes to decadent desserts. Using the right amount ensures the texture and flavour are spot on. Too much or too little can throw off the entire dish, making conversions like 310 ml to cups vital.</p>
<p>For example, if you're making a creamy garlic sauce for your air fryer chicken, 310 ml of heavy cream (1.31 cups) will give you the perfect consistency.

<h3>Measuring Without a Cup</h3>
<p>If you don't have a measuring cup, you can use a kitchen scale. Heavy cream weighs roughly 1.04 grams per ml, so 310 ml would be about 322 grams. This method is just as accurate and often preferred by professional bakers.

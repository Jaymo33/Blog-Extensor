<p>535 ml of coconut milk is approximately 2.26 cups, making it easy to measure for your air fryer recipes. Whether you're whipping up a curry, baking a cake, or preparing a creamy sauce, knowing this conversion ensures accuracy.

Air fryers, in particular, rely on balanced ingredients for even cooking. For example, if you're making a coconut-based curry in your air fryer, 535 ml of coconut milk (or 2.26 cups) ensures the perfect consistency.</p>

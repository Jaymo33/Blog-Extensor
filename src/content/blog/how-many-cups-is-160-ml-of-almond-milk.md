<p>160 ml of almond milk equals approximately 0.68 cups. This conversion is essential for anyone using almond milk in recipes, especially when baking or cooking with an air fryer.

<h2>Understanding Almond Milk Measurements</h2>
<p>Almond milk is a popular dairy-free alternative used in many recipes, from smoothies to baked goods.

<h2>Why Accuracy Matters in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>
<p>Air fryers rely on precise measurements to deliver consistent results. Too much or too little liquid can throw off cooking times and textures. For example, adding 160 ml of almond milk instead of 0.68 cups might seem minor, but it can make a difference in batters or sauces. This is especially true for recipes like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>air fryer cakes</a>, where balance is key.</p>

<h2>Tips for Measuring Almond Milk</h2>

<p>160 ml of corn syrup is approximately 0.68 cups in US measurements or 0.56 cups in UK imperial measurements. This conversion is essential for baking and cooking, especially when using an air fryer where precise measurements can affect texture and consistency. Whether you're making sticky buns or glazes, knowing how to convert 160 ml of corn syrup to cups ensures your recipes turn out perfectly every time.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of corn syrup can make or break a recipe, especially in an air fryer where heat distribution is rapid. Too much syrup can lead to overly sticky or burnt results, while too little might leave your dish lacking sweetness or moisture. For air fryer-friendly desserts like cinnamon rolls or glazed chicken, 160 ml of corn syrup provides just the right balance. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more handy measurement tips.</p>  

<p>Corn syrup is a common ingredient in many recipes featured on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, from caramelised nuts to barbecue sauces. Since air fryers cook faster than conventional ovens, precise measurements ensure even cooking and perfect texture. Whether you're following a UK or US recipe, converting 160 ml of corn syrup to cups correctly avoids guesswork and guarantees consistency.</p>  

<h3>US vs UK Cup Measurements for Corn Syrup</h3>  
<p>In the US, 1 cup equals 240 ml, meaning 160 ml of corn syrup is roughly 0.68 cups. However, UK cups measure 284 ml, so 160 ml converts to about 0.56 cups. This difference matters when scaling recipes, especially for air fryer baking where small changes impact results. Always check whether your recipe uses metric or imperial measurements to avoid errors.</p>  

<h2>How to Measure 160 ml of Corn Syrup Without a Scale</h2>  
<p>If you don’t have a measuring jug, you can use standard tablespoons to measure 160 ml of corn syrup. One tablespoon holds about 15 ml, so you’d need roughly 10.5 tablespoons for 160 ml. For air fryer recipes like glazed salmon or sticky ribs, this method works in a pinch. Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a> for more ideas using corn syrup.</p>  

<p>Another trick is to use a liquid measuring cup with clear ml markings. Pour the corn syrup slowly to avoid bubbles, which can distort the measurement. For sticky ingredients like corn syrup, lightly greasing the cup helps it slide out easily. This precision is key for air fryer dishes, where even small imbalances can affect cooking times and outcomes.</p>  

<h3>Common Recipes Using 160 ml of Corn Syrup</h3>

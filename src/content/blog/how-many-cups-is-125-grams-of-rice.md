<p>125 grams of rice equals approximately 0.63 cups in the US measurement system and 0.53 cups in the UK. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes, where precise measurements ensure even cooking and perfect texture. Whether you're preparing a quick rice dish or using rice as an ingredient in an air fryer meal, knowing how many cups is 125 grams of rice helps avoid guesswork.</p>  

<h2>Understanding Rice Measurements</h2>  
<p>Rice is a staple ingredient in many air fryer recipes, from crispy rice cakes to stuffed peppers. The weight-to-volume conversion can vary slightly depending on the type of rice—long-grain, short-grain, or basmati—but 125 grams generally falls between 0.5 to 0.65 cups. For air fryer cooking, accuracy matters, as too much rice can lead to uneven results. If you're unsure, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more detailed measurements.</p>  

<p>Different rice types have different densities, which means 125 grams of rice in cups won’t always be identical. For example, basmati rice is fluffier, while short-grain rice packs more tightly. If you're adapting a recipe from grams to cups, always consider the rice variety. This is especially important for air fryer dishes, where moisture levels affect crispiness. For more air fryer tips, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a>.</p>  

<h3>US vs. UK Cup Measurements</h3>  
<p>In the US, a standard cup holds 240ml, while a UK cup is 250ml. This small difference means 125 grams of rice in cups isn’t identical across regions. For US cooks, 125g is roughly 0.63 cups, whereas UK cooks should use 0.53 cups. If you’re following an international recipe, double-check which cup measurement it uses to avoid mishaps. Air fryer recipes often require precision, so when in doubt, weigh your rice for accuracy.</p>  

<h2>How to Measure 125 Grams of Rice Without Scales</h2>  
<p>If you don’t have kitchen scales, you can still measure 125 grams of rice using a standard cup. Fill the cup loosely without packing the rice down, then level it off with a knife. Remember, this method is less precise, so results may vary slightly. For air fryer recipes where consistency is key, investing in a digital scale is worthwhile. Alternatively, browse our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/meal-prep>meal prep section</a> for recipes with pre-measured ingredients.</p>  

<p>Another handy trick is to use common household items for estimation. For instance, 125 grams of rice is roughly the size of a tennis ball when lightly packed. While not exact, this can help in a pinch. However, for dishes like air fryer rice pudding or crispy rice snacks, exact measurements ensure the best outcome. Keep your air fryer in top condition with our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning guide</a> to maintain performance.</p>  

<h3>Cooking Rice in an Air Fryer</h3>  
<p>Air fryers aren’t just for frying—they can cook rice perfectly too. For 125 grams of rice, use about 1.5 cups of water and cook at 180°C for 12-15 minutes. Stir halfway through to ensure even cooking. This method works well for quick rice sides or as part of larger dishes.

<p>260 ml of water equals approximately 1.1 cups. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes, where precise measurements can affect cooking times and results. Whether you're baking a cake or preparing a savoury dish, knowing how to convert millilitres to cups ensures accuracy. For more handy conversions, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Using the correct amount of water in air fryer recipes ensures even cooking and perfect texture. Too much liquid can make food soggy, while too little may dry it out. Many air fryer recipes, like those for <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>cakes</a> or <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetables</a>, rely on precise water measurements. Measuring 260 ml of water correctly helps maintain consistency, especially when scaling recipes up or down. Always use a measuring jug or cups for accuracy.</p>  

<p>Air fryers circulate hot air, so moisture levels are crucial. A slight variation in water quantity can alter cooking times significantly. For example, 260 ml of water in a batter versus 250 ml can change how a cake rises. If you're unsure, refer to trusted sources like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> for reliable conversions and tips.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure 260 ml of Water Without a Measuring Cup</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a measuring cup, you can use tablespoons or a kitchen scale. One cup is roughly 240 ml, so 260 ml is just over a cup. Alternatively, 17.6 tablespoons equal 260 ml. A kitchen scale set to grams can also help—water weighs 1 gram per ml, so 260 grams equals 260 ml. For more baking tips, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a>.</p>  

<h2>Difference Between UK and US Cup Measurements</h2>  
<p>In the UK, a standard cup measures 250 ml, while in the US, it’s 240 ml. This means 260 ml of water is 1.04 UK cups or 1.08 US cups. The slight difference may not matter for some recipes, but for baking, precision is key. Always check whether your recipe uses UK or US measurements to avoid errors.</p>  

<p>For air fryer recipes, especially those involving batters or sauces, sticking to one measurement system helps. If a recipe calls for 260 ml of water, confirm if it’s based on UK or US cups. Many recipes on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> specify the measurement system, ensuring foolproof results every time.</p>  

<h3>Common Recipes Using 260 ml of Water</h3>  
<p>Many air fryer recipes, like pancake batter or steamed puddings, use around 260 ml of water. This quantity is also common in soups and broths. For example, a light vegetable broth might require 260 ml of water to balance flavours. If you're making a marinade, precise water measurements ensure the right consistency.</p>  

<h2>Tips for Measuring Water in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Always use clear measuring cups with ml and cup markings for accuracy. Pour water at eye level to avoid over or under-measuring. For sticky batters, lightly grease the cup to help the mixture slide out easily. If scaling a recipe, adjust all ingredients proportionally—260 ml of water might need tweaking based on serving size.</p>  

<p>Cleaning your air fryer after cooking with liquids is crucial. Check out our guide on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaning</a> to keep your appliance in top condition. Proper maintenance ensures consistent performance, especially when working with precise measurements like 260 ml of water.</p>

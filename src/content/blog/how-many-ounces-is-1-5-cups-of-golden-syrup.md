<p>1.5 cups of golden syrup equals approximately 18 ounces (oz). This conversion is essential for precise baking and cooking, especially when using an air fryer, where accurate measurements can make or break a recipe.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Golden syrup is a staple in many recipes, from sticky puddings to glazes for air-fried meats. Using the correct amount ensures the right texture and flavour. Too much syrup can make dishes overly sweet or sticky, while too little might leave them lacking depth. For air fryer recipes, where cooking times are shorter, precision is even more critical.</p>  
<p>If you're experimenting with air fryer desserts or sauces, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> for inspiration. Many of these dishes rely on golden syrup for that perfect caramelised finish.</p>  

<h2>How to Measure Golden Syrup Correctly</h2>  
<p>Measuring golden syrup can be tricky due to its thick, sticky consistency. For the most accurate results, lightly grease your measuring cup with oil or butter before pouring in the syrup. This helps it slide out easily, ensuring you get the full 1.5 cups (18 oz) without waste.</p>  
<p>Alternatively, use a kitchen scale for direct weight measurements. This method eliminates guesswork and is especially handy for air fryer cooking, where small adjustments can affect the outcome. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> can help with other common ingredient swaps.</p>  

<h3>Converting Golden Syrup for UK Recipes</h3>  
<p>In the UK, golden syrup is a beloved ingredient, and many traditional recipes call for it by volume (cups) rather than weight (ounces). If you're adapting a British recipe for your air fryer, knowing that 1.5 cups equals 18 oz ensures you stay true to the original flavour.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for Golden Syrup in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Golden syrup isn’t just for baking—it’s fantastic in air fryer dishes too. Use it to glaze roasted vegetables, add sweetness to air-fried chicken wings, or drizzle over desserts like air-fried apple slices. The key is balancing the syrup with other flavours to avoid overpowering the dish.</p>  
<p>For more ideas, browse our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert recipes</a>, where golden syrup often plays a starring role. From treacle tarts to flapjacks, it’s a versatile ingredient that pairs perfectly with air fryer convenience.</p>  

<h3>Storing Golden Syrup for Longevity</h3>  
<p>To keep golden syrup fresh, store it in a cool, dry place. Once opened, ensure the lid is tightly sealed to prevent crystallization. Proper storage means you’ll always have it on hand for impromptu air fryer creations.</p>

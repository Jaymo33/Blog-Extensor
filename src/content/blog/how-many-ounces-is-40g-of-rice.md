<h2>Why converting 40g of rice to ounces matters</h2>  
<p>Many air fryer recipes, especially those from the UK, use grams, while others rely on ounces. Converting 40g of rice to ounces (1.41 oz) helps you follow recipes precisely. Accurate measurements ensure your rice cooks evenly in the air fryer, whether you’re making crispy rice cakes or a side dish. If you’re new to air frying, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> for inspiration.</p>  

<p>Rice is a staple in many air fryer meals, from fried rice to stuffed peppers. Measuring 40g of rice correctly ensures the right texture and consistency. Over- or under-measuring can affect cooking times and results. For perfect rice every time, stick to the recommended 40g (1.41 oz) portion.</p>  

<h3>How to measure 40g of rice without a scale</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a scale, you can estimate 40g of rice using household items. A standard UK tablespoon holds about 15g of uncooked rice, so 40g is roughly 2.5 tablespoons.

<p>When cooking rice in the air fryer, 40g (1.41 oz) is an ideal starting point. It’s enough to create a satisfying side dish without overcrowding the basket. Pair it with veggies or proteins for a balanced meal. Remember, rice expands during cooking, so 40g uncooked yields about 120g cooked.</p>  

<h3>Tips for cooking rice in the air fryer</h3>  
<p>To cook 40g of rice in the air fryer, preheat to 180°C and use an oven-safe dish with a tight lid. Add water at a 1:1.5 ratio (40g rice to 60ml water) for fluffy results.

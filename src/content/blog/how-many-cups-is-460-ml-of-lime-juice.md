<p>460 ml of lime juice equals approximately 1.94 cups in standard US measurements. This conversion is essential for baking and cooking, especially when using an air fryer where precise measurements can make or break a dish. Whether you’re whipping up a zesty marinade or a tangy dessert, knowing how to convert ml to cups ensures consistency. For more air fryer measurement tips, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Precision is key when using an air fryer, as even small deviations can affect cooking times and textures. Lime juice, often used in marinades or dressings, needs exact measurements to balance flavours. Too much or too little can alter the taste of your dish. For example, a <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>citrus-glazed salmon</a> relies on the right amount of lime juice for that perfect tang. Always measure liquids like lime juice carefully to avoid soggy or overly dry results.</p>  

<p>Using a measuring jug or kitchen scale can help ensure accuracy. If you’re working with 460 ml of lime juice, remember it’s just under 2 cups. This measurement is particularly useful for recipes like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>lime-marinated chicken</a>, where the acidity tenderises the meat. For more tips on air fryer cooking, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>homepage</a>.</p>  

<h3>Converting 460 ml of Lime Juice to Other Units</h3>  
<p>Besides cups, you might need to convert 460 ml of lime juice to tablespoons or fluid ounces. Here’s a quick breakdown: 460 ml equals roughly 31 tablespoons or 15.5 fluid ounces. These conversions are handy for smaller batches or adjusting recipes. If you’re prepping a <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>key lime pie</a>, knowing these measurements ensures the filling sets perfectly.</p>  

<h2>Tips for Measuring Lime Juice in an Air Fryer Recipe</h2>  
<p>Fresh lime juice is always best for flavour, but bottled works in a pinch. To measure 460 ml accurately, use a liquid measuring cup with clear markings. Pour slowly to avoid spills, and check at eye level for precision. For sticky or thick mixtures, lightly grease the measuring cup first. This trick works wonders for <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/shrimp>lime-infused shrimp</a> marinades.</p>  

<p>If you’re scaling a recipe up or down, remember that 460 ml of lime juice is roughly 1.94 cups. Keep a conversion chart handy, like our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion guide</a>, for quick reference.

<h3>Common Mistakes When Measuring Lime Juice</h3>  
<p>One frequent error is confusing fluid ounces with weight ounces—they’re not the same. Another is eyeballing measurements, which can lead to overly acidic or bland dishes. Always use proper tools for liquids like lime juice, especially in air fryer recipes where balance is crucial. For example, a <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>lime-dressed veggie tray</a> needs just the right amount of zest and juice.</p>

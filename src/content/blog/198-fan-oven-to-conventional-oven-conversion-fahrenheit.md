<h2>Why Convert 198 Fan Oven to Fahrenheit?</h2>
<p>Fan ovens circulate hot air, cooking food faster and more evenly than conventional ovens. This means temperatures often need adjusting when switching between the two. Converting 198 fan oven to Fahrenheit (392°F) ensures your dishes cook properly without burning or undercooking. Many air fryer recipes also use fan oven temperatures, making this conversion handy for air fryer users.

<p>Whether you're baking cakes or roasting vegetables, knowing the correct conventional oven temperature is key.

<h2>How to Use 198 Fan Oven Conversion in an Air Fryer</h2>
<p>Air fryers work similarly to fan ovens, circulating hot air for even cooking. If a recipe calls for 198 fan oven, you can often use the same temperature in your air fryer. However, cooking times may differ due to the air fryer's compact size. Always check food a few minutes earlier than the recipe suggests. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a> includes adjusted timings for air fryer use.</p>

<h3>Tips for Perfect Conversion Results</h3>
<p>When converting 198 fan oven to conventional oven, always preheat your appliance. This ensures accurate temperature from the start. Use an oven thermometer to verify your oven's actual temperature, as some models run hot or cold. For air fryers, shaking or turning food halfway through cooking helps achieve even results. Remember, 198 fan oven equals 392°F in a conventional setting.</p>

<h2>Common Dishes Using 198 Fan Oven Temperature</h2>
<p>Many British classics use 198 fan oven as their standard baking temperature. This includes Victoria sponge cakes, scones, and roast potatoes.

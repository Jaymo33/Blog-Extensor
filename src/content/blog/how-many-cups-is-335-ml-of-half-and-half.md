<p>335 ml of half and half equals approximately 1.42 cups. This conversion is essential for baking, cooking, or following recipes that require precise measurements. Whether you're using an air fryer or a traditional oven, knowing how to convert millilitres to cups ensures your dishes turn out perfectly every time.</p>  

<h2>Understanding Half And Half Measurements</h2>  
<p>Half and half is a dairy product made by combining equal parts whole milk and light cream. It's commonly used in recipes to add richness without being as heavy as full cream. When converting 335 ml of half and half to cups, it's important to note that 1 US cup equals 240 ml. This means 335 ml is slightly more than 1 and 1/3 cups.</p>  

<p>For those using metric measurements, 335 ml is a standard volume in many recipes. If you're working with an air fryer, precise measurements like this can make a big difference in texture and consistency. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more handy tips.</p>  

<h3>Why Accurate Measurements Matter</h3>  
<p>Using the correct amount of half and half ensures your recipes turn out as intended. Too much can make dishes overly rich, while too little might leave them lacking in flavour. Whether you're making sauces, soups, or desserts, 335 ml of half and half converted to cups should be measured carefully.</p>  

<h2>Converting 335 ml of Half And Half to Cups</h2>  
<p>To convert 335 ml of half and half to cups, divide the millilitres by the volume of one cup (240 ml). This gives you 1.42 cups, which is roughly 1 and 2/5 cups. For most recipes, rounding to 1.5 cups is acceptable, but for precision baking, sticking to 1.42 cups is best.</p>  

<p>If you're using a UK measuring cup, note that 1 UK cup equals 284 ml. This means 335 ml of half and half is about 1.18 UK cups. Always check whether your recipe uses US or UK measurements to avoid confusion. Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipes section</a> for more measurement guidance.</p>  

<h3>Tips for Measuring Half And Half</h3>  
<p>For the most accurate measurement, use a liquid measuring cup with clear markings. Pour the half and half to the desired line at eye level to avoid over or under-measuring. If you don't have a measuring cup, a kitchen scale can also help—335 ml of half and half weighs roughly 344 grams.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for 335 ml of Half And Half</h2>  
<p>335 ml of half and half is a versatile amount used in many recipes. It's perfect for creamy pasta sauces, rich soups, or even homemade ice cream. If you're using an air fryer, try adding it to mashed potatoes or a creamy dip for extra flavour.</p>  

<p>For dessert lovers, 335 ml of half and half can be used in custards, puddings, or even coffee-based drinks. Visit our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert recipes</a> for inspiration on how to use this measurement creatively.</p>  

<h3>Storing Half And Half Properly</h3>  
<p>Once opened, half and half should be stored in the refrigerator and used within 7-10 days. If your recipe calls for 335 ml but you have leftovers, consider freezing them in ice cube trays for future use. Just thaw and stir well before adding to recipes.</p>

<h2>Using Lime Juice in Air Fryer Recipes</h2>  
<p>Lime juice adds brightness to air fryer dishes, from crispy chicken wings to zesty vegetables.

For example, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/shrimp>shrimp recipes</a> often use lime juice for a fresh, tangy finish. Since air fryers circulate hot air, liquids reduce faster—so precise measurements prevent over-reduction.</p>  

<p>If you’re adapting a conventional recipe for the air fryer, remember that 160 ml of lime juice (0.68 cups) might need slight adjustments.

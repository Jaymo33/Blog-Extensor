<h2>How Many Ounces in 0.5 Cup of Lemon Juice?</h2>  
<p>0.5 cup of lemon juice equals approximately 4 fluid ounces (oz). This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes, where precise measurements ensure the perfect balance of acidity and flavour. Whether you’re marinating chicken or adding zest to desserts, knowing how many ounces are in 0.5 cup of lemon juice helps avoid over-pouring. For more air fryer measurement tips, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>. Lemon juice’s density means it weighs slightly more than water, so always measure carefully.</p>  

<p>Accurate conversions like 0.5 cup lemon juice to ounces are crucial for air fryer cooking, where small quantities can make a big difference. Too much lemon juice can overpower a dish, while too little might leave it bland. If you’re working with UK measurements, rest assured that 0.5 cup translates neatly to 4 oz. For recipe inspiration, browse our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> collection, featuring everything from tangy marinades to zesty desserts.</p>  

<h3>Why Measure Lemon Juice Precisely?</h3>  
<p>Lemon juice is a powerful ingredient that can enhance or ruin a dish if not measured correctly. In air fryer cooking, where heat circulates intensely, the right amount ensures even flavour distribution. Whether you’re converting 0.5 cup of lemon juice to oz for a marinade or dressing, precision guarantees consistent results. Over-measuring can also lead to excess moisture, affecting crispiness—a key factor in air frying.</p>  

<h2>Converting 0.5 Cup Lemon Juice to Ounces</h2>  
<p>To convert 0.5 cup lemon juice to ounces, remember that 1 US cup equals 8 fluid ounces, so half a cup is 4 oz. This applies to both US and UK measurements, though UK cups are slightly larger (284 ml vs. 240 ml). For air fryer recipes, sticking to fluid ounces ensures accuracy. If you’re using bottled lemon juice, check the label—some brands may list weight in grams, requiring further conversion. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a> simplifies these calculations.</p>  

<p>When working with fresh lemons, note that one medium lemon yields roughly 2–3 tablespoons (1–1.5 oz) of juice. So, 0.5 cup (4 oz) of lemon juice requires about 3–4 lemons. For recipes demanding exactness, like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>air fryer desserts</a>, measuring by weight (ounces) is more reliable than counting lemons. Keep a kitchen scale handy for foolproof results.</p>  

<h3>Tips for Measuring Lemon Juice in Air Fryer Recipes</h3>  
<p>Always use a liquid measuring cup for 0.5 cup lemon juice to ounces conversions, as dry cups can vary. Pour slowly to the 0.5-cup line at eye level for accuracy. If substituting bottled juice for fresh, adjust for concentration—some bottled versions are stronger. For sticky residues, clean your air fryer basket with our recommended <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner</a> to maintain hygiene and performance.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for 0.5 Cup Lemon Juice in Air Frying</h2>  
<p>Half a cup (4 oz) of lemon juice is perfect for marinating <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>air fryer chicken</a>, adding brightness without overwhelming the meat. It’s also ideal for dressings, glazes, or deglazing the air fryer basket after cooking fish. In desserts, 0.5 cup lemon juice balances sweetness in cakes or curds. Remember, air fryers intensify flavours, so measure carefully to avoid overpowering dishes.</p>  

<p>For vegetable dishes, 0.5 cup lemon juice can elevate roasted or air-fried greens like asparagus or broccoli. Mix it with olive oil and herbs for a light, tangy coating. If you’re experimenting with <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/seafood>air fryer seafood</a>, lemon juice helps cut through richness. Always add it towards the end to preserve its fresh taste and avoid bitterness from overcooking.</p>

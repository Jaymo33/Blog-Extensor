description: "ing salmon in the air fryer couldn’t be easier, and it all starts with good prep. First, always preheat your air fryer to ensure even cooking—about 200°C (or 400°F) is ideal. If you're using skin-on fillets, place them skin side down to keep the meat moist and create that satisfying crisp underneath. Lightly coat the fillet with olive oil or use a quick nonstick spray to prevent sticking. Now comes the fun bit—flavour. A simple rub of garlic powder, paprika, and a pinch of seasoned salt does wonders, but you can also try a sweet and savoury twist with a honey-Dijon glaze."

<h2 id="">Preheat &amp; Season for Perfect Air Fryer Salmon</h2><p id="">Cooking salmon in the air fryer couldn’t be easier, and it all starts with good prep. First, always preheat your air fryer to ensure even cooking—about 200°C (or 400°F) is ideal. If you're using skin-on fillets, place them skin side down to keep the meat moist and create that satisfying crisp underneath. Lightly coat the fillet with olive oil or use a quick nonstick spray to prevent sticking. Now comes the fun bit—flavour. A simple rub of garlic powder, paprika, and a pinch of seasoned salt does wonders, but you can also try a sweet and savoury twist with a honey-Dijon glaze.</p><p id="">Wondering how to cook salmon in an air fryer without drying it out? We’ve got you covered. At <em id="">AirFryerRecipe.co.uk</em>, we’ve perfected the method over countless tests and trials.

The key is not just how long to cook salmon in air fryer, but how it’s placed and what’s happening around it. You’ll want to allow space around the fillet in the air fryer basket so the hot air can circulate freely—don’t crowd it. Aim for around 8–10 minutes for a fresh fillet, and up to 12 minutes if you’re cooking frozen salmon directly. If using a meat thermometer, target an internal temperature of 60°C (140°F) for perfectly cooked, flaky, and moist salmon.</p><p id="">Looking for something super quick and tasty?

Always check the thickest part of the fillet using a digital thermometer. If you’re wondering exactly how long to cook salmon in air fryer, start at 8 minutes and adjust depending on thickness and whether it’s wild-caught or farmed.

<p>1.66 cups of plain yogurt equals approximately 13.28 ounces (oz). This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements matter. Whether you're making a creamy dip or a fluffy cake, knowing the exact weight ensures consistency. For more air fryer conversions, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on even cooking, and incorrect measurements can throw off textures and flavours. Plain yogurt, often used in marinades or baking, needs precise amounts for the best results. Too much yogurt can make dishes soggy, while too little may dry them out. If you're preparing a <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipe</a>, a marinade with the right yogurt ratio ensures juicy, tender meat. Always measure ingredients like yogurt by weight for reliability.</p>  

<p>Converting cups to ounces eliminates guesswork, especially with thick ingredients like yogurt. A standard UK measuring cup holds 8 fluid ounces, but yogurt's density means weight varies. For 1.66 cups, 13.28 oz is the safest bet. Need more recipe ideas? Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a> for inspiration.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure Plain Yogurt Correctly</h3>  
<p>Use a kitchen scale for the most accurate results. Scoop yogurt into a measuring cup, then level it off with a knife. If you don’t have a scale, remember that 1 cup of plain yogurt is roughly 8 oz, so 1.66 cups would be just over 13 oz. For sticky ingredients, lightly grease the measuring cup first.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for Plain Yogurt in Air Fryer Recipes</h2>  
<p>Plain yogurt works wonders in air fryer cooking, from tenderising meats to adding moisture to baked goods. Try it in <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>desserts</a> like cakes or as a base for dips. Its slight tang balances spices in marinades, perfect for <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/lamb>lamb dishes</a>. Always measure carefully—1.66 cups (13.28 oz) ensures your recipe turns out just right.</p>  

<p>Yogurt also helps create crispy coatings for air-fried foods. Mix it with breadcrumbs or spices for a crunchy texture. Cleaning your air fryer after yogurt-based recipes? Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning guide</a> makes it hassle-free.</p>

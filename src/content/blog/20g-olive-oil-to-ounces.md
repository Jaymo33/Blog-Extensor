<h2>Why accurate olive oil measurements matter in air fryers</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on hot air circulation to cook food, so using the right amount of oil is crucial. Too much oil can lead to soggy results, while too little may leave food dry.

<p>Olive oil is a popular choice for air frying due to its high smoke point and health benefits. Measuring 20g (0.71 oz) ensures you get the crispiness without excess grease. Many <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> call for small amounts of oil, making this conversion particularly useful.</p>  

<h3>How to measure 20g of olive oil without scales</h3>  
<p>If you don't have a kitchen scale, you can use volume measurements. Roughly, 20g of olive oil equals 1.5 tablespoons or 4.5 teaspoons. However, for precision in air frying, weighing 0.71 ounces (20g) is always best. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable air fryer recipes</a> often use this measurement for perfect roasting.</p>  

<h2>Converting 20g olive oil to ounces for different recipes</h2>

For example, tossing potato wedges in this amount ensures even coating without pooling oil. Visit our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/potatoes>potato recipe collection</a> for inspiration.</p>  

<p>When baking in your air fryer, 20g of olive oil might be used in cake batters or doughs. The 0.71-ounce measurement translates well for small-batch baking.

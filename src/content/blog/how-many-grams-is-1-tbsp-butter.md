<p>1 tablespoon (tbsp) of butter equals approximately 14 grams in the UK. This measurement is essential for air fryer recipes where precision matters, ensuring your dishes turn out perfectly every time. Whether you’re baking, frying, or making sauces, knowing the exact weight of butter can make all the difference.</p>

<h2>Why accurate butter measurements matter in air frying</h2>
<p>Using the correct amount of butter ensures your air fryer recipes cook evenly and achieve the desired texture. Too much butter can lead to greasy results, while too little might leave your dish dry. For example, when making air fryer cookies or cakes, 1 tbsp of butter (14 grams) provides just the right moisture and richness.</p>
<p>Precision is also crucial for health-conscious cooks tracking calories or macros. Butter is calorie-dense, so knowing the exact grams per tablespoon helps with portion control.

<h2>How to measure 1 tbsp of butter accurately</h2>
<p>For the most precise measurement, use a digital kitchen scale to weigh your butter. If you don’t have one, a standard UK tablespoon (15ml) filled level with softened butter will give you roughly 14 grams. Packed or melted butter can vary slightly, so always aim for consistency.</p>

<p>1 tablespoon (tbsp) of butter equals approximately 14 grams in the UK. This measurement is essential for air fryer recipes where precision matters, ensuring your dishes turn out perfectly every time. Whether you’re baking, frying, or making sauces, knowing the exact weight of butter can make all the difference.</p>

<h2>Why accurate butter measurements matter in air frying</h2>
<p>Using the correct amount of butter ensures your air fryer recipes cook evenly and achieve the desired texture. Too much butter can lead to greasy results, while too little might leave your dish dry. For example, when making air fryer cookies or cakes, 1 tbsp of butter (14 grams) provides just the right moisture and richness.</p>
<p>Precision is also crucial for health-conscious cooks tracking calories or macros. Butter is calorie-dense, so knowing the exact grams per tablespoon helps with portion control. Visit <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes</a> for dishes where butter measurements are key, like garlic butter shrimp or crispy potatoes.</p>

<h2>How to measure 1 tbsp of butter accurately</h2>
<p>For the most precise measurement, use a digital kitchen scale to weigh your butter. If you don’t have one, a standard UK tablespoon (15ml) filled level with softened butter will give you roughly 14 grams. Packed or melted butter can vary slightly, so always aim for consistency.</p>
<p>Many air fryer recipes, like those found at <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart</a>, rely on accurate butter measurements for perfect results. Whether you’re adapting oven recipes or creating new ones, this conversion is a game-changer.</p>

<h3>Butter measurements in UK vs. other countries</h3>
<p>In the UK, 1 tbsp of butter is standardized at 14 grams, but this can differ elsewhere. For instance, US tablespoons are slightly larger (14.2 grams), while Australian tablespoons hold 20 grams. Always check your recipe’s origin to avoid confusion, especially when using international air fryer guides.</p>

<h2>Common air fryer recipes using 1 tbsp of butter</h2>
<p>Butter is a staple in many air fryer dishes, from savoury to sweet. A single tablespoon (14 grams) can elevate roasted vegetables, add richness to meats, or create a golden crust on fish. Try it in air fryer salmon or garlic butter mushrooms for delicious results.</p>
<p>For dessert lovers, 1 tbsp of butter is perfect for small-batch cookies or cakes. Check out <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert</a> for inspiration. Remember, precise measurements ensure your treats bake evenly in the air fryer’s compact space.</p>

<h3>Converting larger butter amounts</h3>
<p>If your recipe calls for multiple tablespoons, simply multiply by 14 grams. For example, 4 tbsp of butter equals 56 grams. This scaling is handy when preparing larger batches or family-sized air fryer meals. Keep our conversion handy for quick reference during cooking.</p>

<h2>Tips for working with butter in air fryers</h2>
<p>Butter can smoke at high temperatures, so use it sparingly in air frying. A light brush or spray often suffices. For cleaning, visit <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner</a> for tips on removing butter residue. Always preheat your air fryer when using butter to prevent sticking and ensure even cooking.</p>
<p>Experiment with butter alternatives like ghee or oil for higher smoke points. However, for traditional recipes, sticking to the 1 tbsp (14 grams) measurement guarantees authentic flavour and texture in your air fryer creations.</p>

<p>25g of powdered milk equals approximately 0.88 ounces. This conversion is handy for air fryer recipes, baking, or meal prep where precise measurements matter. Whether you’re whipping up a cake or adding powdered milk to a sauce, knowing the exact weight ensures consistency. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we focus on making cooking conversions effortless, so you can focus on creating delicious meals.</p>  

<h2>Why convert 25g of powdered milk to ounces?</h2>  
<p>Many UK recipes use grams, while others reference ounces, especially older cookbooks or international guides. Converting 25g of powdered milk to ounces (0.88 oz) helps avoid guesswork. Air fryer recipes, like those on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>our recipes page</a>, often require precision for best results. Powdered milk is a common ingredient in baked goods, sauces, and even homemade breadcrumbs for air-fried dishes. Getting the measurement right ensures your dish turns out perfectly every time.</p>  

<p>If you’re scaling a recipe up or down, knowing how 25g translates to ounces simplifies adjustments. For example, doubling a recipe means you’d need 1.76 ounces instead of 25g. This small detail can make a big difference in texture and flavour, especially in air fryer baking. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more handy measurement swaps.</p>  

<h3>How to measure 25g of powdered milk accurately</h3>  
<p>For the most precise measurement, use digital kitchen scales set to grams. Scoop the powdered milk into a bowl until the scale reads 25g. If you don’t have scales, 25g is roughly 5 level teaspoons, but this can vary slightly depending on how tightly packed the powder is. For air fryer recipes, accuracy ensures even cooking and perfect texture, whether you’re making a creamy sauce or a fluffy cake.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for 25g of powdered milk in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Powdered milk is a versatile ingredient in air fryer recipes. It’s often used in breading mixtures for crispy chicken or fish, adding a subtle richness. You’ll also find it in homemade doughs for air-fried breads or desserts. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>our dessert category</a>, you’ll see how powdered milk enhances recipes like air-fried doughnuts or muffins. Its long shelf life makes it ideal for meal prep, too.</p>  

<p>Another great use is in creamy sauces or soups made in the air fryer. Since 25g of powdered milk equals about 0.88 ounces, you can easily adjust quantities for smaller batches. It’s also a handy substitute for fresh milk in emergencies—just mix with water as directed.

<h3>Converting other powdered milk quantities</h3>  
<p>If your recipe calls for more or less than 25g, here’s a quick reference: 50g is about 1.76 ounces, while 10g is roughly 0.35 ounces. These conversions are useful when adapting recipes for the air fryer, where ingredient ratios affect cooking times. Always level off your measurements for consistency, especially in baking.

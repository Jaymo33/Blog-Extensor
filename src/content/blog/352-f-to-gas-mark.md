<p>Gas Mark 4 (352°F) provides moderate heat that browns food evenly without burning. It's particularly useful for recipes requiring gentle cooking, like custards or delicate pastries. When using an air fryer, you might need to reduce cooking time by 20% compared to oven instructions. Always preheat your air fryer for 3-5 minutes at Gas Mark 4 to ensure consistent results from the first bite to the last.</p>

<h3>How Gas Mark Differs Between Ovens and Air Fryers</h3>
<p>While 352 F equals Gas Mark 4 in both ovens and air fryers, air fryers circulate heat more efficiently. This means foods often cook faster, even at the same temperature. For example, cookies that take 12 minutes in an oven might be done in 9-10 minutes in an air fryer at Gas Mark 4. The rapid air technology in air fryers also creates crispier textures, perfect for roast potatoes or <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>air fryer chicken</a> recipes.</p>

<h2>Common Recipes Using 352 F (Gas Mark 4)</h2>
<p>Gas Mark 4 (352°F) is a versatile temperature for both sweet and savoury dishes. Classic Victoria sponge cakes, scones, and flapjacks all thrive at this heat. For savoury options, try roasting nuts, baking stuffed mushrooms, or preparing a tray of <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>air fryer vegetables</a>. The moderate temperature allows flavours to develop without risking burnt edges or undercooked centres.</p>
<p>When adapting oven recipes to your air fryer at 352 F to Gas Mark 4, consider the size of your cooking basket. Smaller batches often yield better results, as overcrowding can block airflow. For baking, use parchment paper or silicone liners to prevent sticking. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a> includes dozens of Gas Mark 4-tested dishes optimised for air fryer cooking.</p>

<h3>Tips for Perfect Cooking at Gas Mark 4</h3>
<p>To master 352 F (Gas Mark 4) in your air fryer, always check food 2-3 minutes before the suggested cooking time ends. Use an instant-read thermometer for meats – chicken should reach 75°C internally. For baked goods, the skewer test still applies: if it comes out clean, your cake is done. Remember that air fryers vary by model, so keep notes on what works best for your specific appliance.</p>

<h2>Troubleshooting 352 F to Gas Mark 4 Conversions</h2>
<p>If foods brown too quickly at Gas Mark 4 in your air fryer, try reducing the temperature by 10°F (to 342 F) or Gas Mark 3.5. Conversely, if cooking takes longer than expected, verify your air fryer's calibration with an oven thermometer. Some older models might run slightly cool. Regular <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning</a> ensures consistent heating performance at all temperature settings, including 352 F to Gas Mark 4.</p>
<p>For foods that typically require longer cooking at Gas Mark 4, like whole chickens or large baked potatoes, consider cutting them into smaller pieces for the air fryer. This adaptation maintains the 352 F temperature while ensuring thorough cooking. Always let meats rest for 5-10 minutes after air frying to allow juices to redistribute, just as you would with oven cooking.</p>

<p>2 cups of tomato ketchup equals approximately 16 ounces (or 1 pound) in standard UK measurements. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes, ensuring accurate ingredient portions for perfect results every time. Whether you're whipping up a batch of homemade BBQ sauce or glazing chicken wings, knowing how many ounces are in 2 cups of tomato ketchup keeps your cooking precise.</p>  

<h2>Understanding the Conversion: Cups to Ounces</h2>  
<p>Converting cups to ounces can be tricky, especially with thick condiments like tomato ketchup. In the UK, 1 cup of tomato ketchup typically weighs around 8 ounces, meaning 2 cups equal 16 ounces. This measurement is crucial for air fryer recipes, where consistency affects cooking times and textures. For example, a sticky glaze or marinade requires the right balance of ketchup to other ingredients.</p>  

<p>If you're using an air fryer, precise measurements help avoid overly soggy or dry results. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more handy tips on converting common ingredients. Whether you're cooking frozen foods or meal prepping, accurate measurements make all the difference.</p>  

<h3>Why Accuracy Matters in Air Fryer Cooking</h3>  
<p>Air fryers rely on hot air circulation, so ingredient ratios impact cooking efficiency. Too much ketchup in a marinade can create excess moisture, while too little might leave food bland. Knowing that 2 cups of tomato ketchup equals 16 ounces helps you adjust recipes confidently.

<h2>Common Uses for 2 Cups of Tomato Ketchup</h2>  
<p>Two cups of tomato ketchup (16 ounces) are often used in bulk cooking or meal prep. Popular air fryer dishes like sticky chicken wings, meatloaf glazes, or homemade BBQ sauces rely on this measurement. If you're batch-cooking for a family, knowing the ounce equivalent ensures consistency across servings.</p>  

<p>For those experimenting with air fryer desserts, ketchup might seem unusual, but it’s a key ingredient in some sweet-and-sour sauces. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert category</a> for creative twists. And don’t forget to keep your air fryer clean—excess ketchup can stick to baskets. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning guide</a> has you covered.</p>  

<h3>Measuring Tips for Thick Condiments</h3>  
<p>When measuring tomato ketchup, use a liquid measuring cup for accuracy. Scoop and level for the correct 2-cup (16-ounce) portion. For sticky residues, lightly grease the cup or use a spatula to scrape out every bit. This ensures you’re not shortchanging your recipes.</p>  

<h2>UK vs. US Measurements</h2>  
<p>While UK and US ounces are nearly identical, cup sizes can vary slightly. In the UK, 1 cup is 250ml, whereas the US uses 240ml. However, for tomato ketchup, the difference is negligible—2 cups still equate to roughly 16 ounces. Always double-check labels if using imported recipes.</p>

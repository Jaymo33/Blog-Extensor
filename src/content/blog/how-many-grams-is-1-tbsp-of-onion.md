<p>1 tablespoon (tbsp) of chopped onion weighs approximately 10 grams in the UK. This measurement is essential for air fryer recipes where precision ensures even cooking and perfect results. Whether you’re preparing a quick stir-fry or a hearty casserole, knowing the exact weight of your ingredients can make all the difference. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we focus on helping you achieve culinary perfection with accurate conversions and tips.</p>

<h2>Why accurate onion measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on even heat distribution, and inconsistent ingredient sizes can lead to uneven cooking. Using 10 grams of onion per tablespoon ensures your dishes cook uniformly, whether you’re making crispy onions or a flavourful base for sauces. For more air fryer measurement tips, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>. This resource simplifies all your cooking conversions, from tablespoons to grams and beyond.</p>  

<p>Recipes often call for onions in tablespoons, but scales measure in grams. Knowing that 1 tbsp of onion equals 10 grams eliminates guesswork. This is especially useful for meal prepping or when following precise recipes like those in our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipe collection</a>. Whether you’re cooking for one or a family, accurate measurements save time and reduce waste.</p>  

<h3>How to measure 1 tbsp of onion correctly</h3>  
<p>For the most accurate 10-gram measurement, finely chop your onion and lightly pack it into a tablespoon. Avoid heaping the onion, as this can add extra weight and throw off your recipe. If you’re using pre-chopped onions from the supermarket, check the packaging for weight per tablespoon, as pre-cut varieties may differ slightly in density.</p>  

<h2>Converting other onion measurements to grams</h2>  
<p>While 1 tbsp of onion is 10 grams, other common measurements include 1 teaspoon (about 3 grams) and 1 cup (roughly 160 grams). These conversions are handy when scaling recipes up or down. For vegetable-heavy dishes like stir-fries or <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable-based air fryer meals</a>, precise measurements ensure balanced flavours and textures.</p>  

<p>If your recipe calls for onion in ounces, remember that 10 grams equals approximately 0.35 ounces. This conversion is useful when using digital scales that toggle between units. For more measurement help, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a> covers everything from grams to cups, ensuring your air fryer dishes turn out perfectly every time.</p>  

<h3>Tips for cooking with onions in your air fryer</h3>  
<p>Onions can vary in water content, which affects their weight when raw versus cooked. For crispy air-fried onions, spread them evenly in the basket and cook at 180°C for 8–10 minutes. If you’re using onions as a base for sauces or stews, sauté them first for deeper flavour. Always measure onions after chopping for the most accurate results.</p>

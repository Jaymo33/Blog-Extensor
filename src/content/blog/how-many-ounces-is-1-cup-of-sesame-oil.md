<p>1 cup of sesame oil equals approximately 8.45 ounces (or 8.5 oz for simplicity). This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precision matters. Whether you're making crispy tofu or marinating chicken, knowing the exact weight ensures consistent results every time.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate sesame oil measurements matter</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of sesame oil can make or break your air fryer dishes. Too little, and your food might lack flavour or crispness; too much, and it could become greasy. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we emphasise precision for perfect results. Many of our popular recipes, like sesame-crusted salmon or Asian-style vegetables, rely on this golden oil for authentic taste.</p>  

<p>Sesame oil has a distinct nutty aroma and higher smoke point than some oils, making it ideal for air frying. When converting 1 cup sesame oil to ounces, remember that liquid measurements differ slightly by country. The UK standard gives you that 8.45 oz figure, which you'll find handy for our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>  

<h3>How to measure sesame oil correctly</h3>  
<p>For best results, use a liquid measuring cup placed on a flat surface. Pour the sesame oil slowly until it reaches the 1-cup mark at eye level. If using scales, 8.45 ounces is your target. This method works perfectly for our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>sesame chicken recipes</a> where balance is key.</p>  

<h2>Sesame oil substitutes in air frying</h2>  
<p>While nothing replicates sesame oil's unique flavour, you can use alternatives in a pinch. Peanut or avocado oil work well for high-heat air frying, though you'll miss that distinctive taste. When substituting, maintain the same 1 cup to 8.45 ounces ratio for consistent texture in dishes from our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a>.</p>  

<p>Light sesame oil has a milder flavour than the toasted variety often used in Asian cooking. Both types measure the same - 1 cup equals 8.45 ounces - but deliver different intensity. For cleaning sticky residue after cooking, try our recommended <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner</a> to maintain your appliance.</p>  

<h3>Storing sesame oil for air fryer use</h3>  
<p>Proper storage preserves sesame oil's quality between uses. Keep it in a cool, dark place to prevent rancidity. When measuring out 1 cup (8.45 oz) for marinades or dressings, check for freshness - it should smell nutty, not bitter. This ensures your <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable dishes</a> get the best flavour.</p>  

<h2>Common mistakes when measuring sesame oil</h2>  
<p>Many home cooks eyeball measurements, leading to inconsistent results. Remember that 1 cup sesame oil to ounces is 8.45, not the 8 oz some assume. Using dry measuring cups instead of liquid ones can also throw off quantities, affecting air fryer performance.</p>  

<p>Another frequent error involves confusing weight and volume. While 1 cup of water weighs 8 ounces, denser sesame oil comes in slightly heavier at 8.45 oz per cup.

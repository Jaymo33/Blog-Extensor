<p>25g of crushed garlic equals approximately 0.88 ounces. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes, where precise measurements can make or break a dish. Whether you're whipping up a garlic-infused marinade or adding a punch of flavour to roasted vegetables, knowing the exact weight ensures consistency. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we understand the importance of accurate conversions for perfect results every time.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate garlic measurements matter</h2>  
<p>Garlic is a powerhouse ingredient that can elevate any dish, but too much or too little can throw off the balance. In an air fryer, where cooking times are shorter and temperatures higher, precise measurements are even more critical. A slight variation in garlic quantity can overpower or underwhelm your recipe. For example, 25g of crushed garlic (0.88 ounces) is ideal for a medium-sized batch of garlic butter or a marinade for chicken. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more handy measurement tips.</p>  

<p>Crushed garlic is denser than minced or sliced garlic, which means weight matters more than volume. A tablespoon of crushed garlic might weigh differently depending on how finely it's prepared. That's why weighing your garlic in grams or ounces ensures consistency. If you're prepping a garlic-heavy dish like garlic bread or roasted potatoes, this precision ensures even flavour distribution. For more recipe ideas, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipes section</a>.</p>  

<h3>How to measure 25g of crushed garlic</h3>  
<p>To measure 25g of crushed garlic accurately, use a digital kitchen scale for the best results. If you don't have one, roughly 5-6 medium-sized cloves crushed will give you close to 25g. Remember, the size of garlic cloves can vary, so a scale eliminates guesswork. Once crushed, the garlic should fill about two tablespoons, but weighing it confirms the exact amount. This method is especially useful for air fryer recipes where consistency is key.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for 25g of crushed garlic</h2>  
<p>25g of crushed garlic (0.88 ounces) is a versatile quantity for many air fryer dishes. It's perfect for marinating chicken, seasoning roasted vegetables, or making garlic-infused oils. For example, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>garlic butter chicken recipe</a> uses this exact amount to create a rich, flavourful coating. You can also mix it into dips or spreads for a bold garlic kick. The air fryer's rapid cooking locks in the garlic's aroma without burning it.</p>  

<p>Another great use for 25g of crushed garlic is in homemade garlic bread. Spread it over buttered baguette slices and air fry for a crispy, golden finish. The high heat of the air fryer intensifies the garlic's flavour without making it bitter. For cleaning tips after cooking garlic-heavy dishes, visit our guide on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner</a> to keep your appliance fresh.</p>  

<h3>Storing crushed garlic</h3>  
<p>If you've crushed more garlic than needed, store it properly to maintain freshness. Place 25g portions in an airtight container or ice cube tray with a bit of olive oil. Frozen crushed garlic can last up to three months and is ready to use straight from the freezer. This trick saves time for future air fryer meals, ensuring you always have the right amount on hand.</p>

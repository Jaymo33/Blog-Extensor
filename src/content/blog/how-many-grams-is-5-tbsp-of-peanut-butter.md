<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>

<p>Peanut butter is a versatile ingredient, appearing in everything from desserts like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>air fryer cakes</a> to marinades for chicken. Its sticky texture means volume measurements (like tablespoons) can vary slightly. Weight measurements in grams remove this guesswork, making them ideal for air fryer recipes.</p>  

<h3>How to measure peanut butter for air fryer recipes</h3>  
<p>To measure 5 tbsp of peanut butter accurately, use a kitchen scale for the most precise results. Scoop the peanut butter into a bowl and weigh it until you reach 75 grams.

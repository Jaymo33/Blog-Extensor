<p>5 tablespoons of peanut butter equals approximately 75 grams. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements can make or break your dish. Whether you’re whipping up peanut butter cookies or a savoury satay sauce, knowing the exact weight ensures consistency. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we focus on accuracy to help you achieve perfect results every time.</p>

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on even heat distribution, and incorrect ingredient quantities can lead to uneven cooking. For example, too much peanut butter in a recipe might make it overly dense or greasy. Conversely, too little could leave your dish dry. Measuring 5 tbsp of peanut butter in grams (75g) ensures you hit the sweet spot. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more handy tips.</p>  

<p>Peanut butter is a versatile ingredient, appearing in everything from desserts like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>air fryer cakes</a> to marinades for chicken. Its sticky texture means volume measurements (like tablespoons) can vary slightly. Weight measurements in grams remove this guesswork, making them ideal for air fryer recipes.</p>  

<h3>How to measure peanut butter for air fryer recipes</h3>  
<p>To measure 5 tbsp of peanut butter accurately, use a kitchen scale for the most precise results. Scoop the peanut butter into a bowl and weigh it until you reach 75 grams. If you don’t have a scale, level off each tablespoon with a knife to ensure consistency.

<h2>Common uses for 5 tbsp of peanut butter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Five tablespoons of peanut butter (75g) is a common quantity in many air fryer recipes. It’s enough to make a batch of peanut butter cookies, a creamy satay sauce for <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>air fryer chicken</a>, or a decadent peanut butter drizzle for desserts. The key is to distribute it evenly for the best texture and flavour.</p>  

<p>Peanut butter also works well in energy bites or granola bars made in the air fryer. Since these recipes often require binding ingredients, the 75g measurement ensures the right consistency. For cleaning sticky peanut butter residue, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner guide</a> has you covered.</p>  

<h3>Converting other peanut butter quantities to grams</h3>  
<p>If your recipe calls for more or less peanut butter, here’s a quick reference: 1 tbsp equals 15g, so 3 tbsp is 45g, and 10 tbsp is 150g. This makes scaling recipes up or down a breeze. Whether you’re making a small batch or a family-sized portion, grams provide the accuracy air fryer cooking demands.</p>

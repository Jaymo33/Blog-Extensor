<p>200 grams of rolled oats equals approximately 2.5 cups when measured correctly. This conversion is essential for baking, cooking, or using your air fryer to ensure recipes turn out perfectly. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we know precise measurements make all the difference in achieving the best texture and flavour.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter</h2>
<p>Using the correct amount of rolled oats ensures your recipes have the right consistency and taste. Too many oats can make baked goods dry, while too few may leave them soggy. Whether you're making granola in your air fryer or baking oatmeal cookies, 200 grams of rolled oats should translate to roughly 2.5 cups. This measurement applies to standard UK and US cup sizes, though slight variations can occur based on how densely you pack the oats.</p>

<h2>How to Measure 200 Grams of Rolled Oats</h2>
<p>The most accurate way to measure 200 grams of rolled oats is by using kitchen scales. If you don't have scales, the spoon-and-level method works well. Gently spoon the oats into a measuring cup without packing them down, then level off the top with a straight edge. This method typically yields about 2.5 cups from 200 grams of rolled oats.</p>

<h3>Packed vs. Unpacked Measurements</h3>
<p>Packed rolled oats will measure differently than loosely filled cups. For 200 grams, if you pack the oats firmly into the cup, you might only need about 2 cups. However, for most recipes, we recommend the looser measurement of 2.5 cups per 200 grams. This ensures your air fryer creations like granola or oat coatings have the ideal texture.</p>

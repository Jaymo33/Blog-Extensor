<p>2.5 cups of maple syrup equals approximately 20 ounces, making it easy to measure for your air fryer recipes. Whether you're baking, glazing, or drizzling, precise measurements ensure perfect results every time. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we love helping you get the most out of your air fryer with accurate conversions and delicious recipes.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Getting the right amount of maple syrup is crucial for balancing sweetness and texture in your air fryer dishes. Too much syrup can make food overly sticky, while too little might leave it bland. Using 20 ounces (or 2.5 cups) ensures consistency, whether you're making glazed salmon or maple-roasted vegetables. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more handy measurement tips.</p>  

<p>Maple syrup is a versatile ingredient, perfect for both sweet and savoury air fryer recipes. From breakfast pancakes to evening desserts, knowing how to convert cups to ounces helps streamline your cooking process. If you're new to air frying, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a> for inspiration.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure Maple Syrup Correctly</h3>  
<p>For the most accurate results, use a liquid measuring cup for maple syrup. Its thick consistency means it can cling to the sides, so always level it off with a spatula. If you're using a kitchen scale, 20 ounces is the equivalent of 2.5 cups, making it easy to weigh for precision.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for Maple Syrup in Air Fryers</h2>  
<p>Maple syrup isn't just for pancakes—it's a fantastic glaze for meats like chicken or turkey in the air fryer. A mix of 2.5 cups (20 ounces) of syrup with spices creates a delicious caramelised coating. For dessert lovers, try drizzling it over air-fried apples or pears for a quick, sweet treat.</p>  

<p>Another great use is in marinades or sauces for vegetables. Toss carrots or sweet potatoes in a blend of maple syrup, olive oil, and herbs before air frying for a caramelised finish. Find more ideas in our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable recipes</a> section.</p>  

<h3>Storing Maple Syrup for Longevity</h3>  
<p>To keep your maple syrup fresh, store it in an airtight container in the fridge after opening. This prevents crystallisation and maintains its smooth texture. If you're using 2.5 cups (20 ounces) for meal prep, portion it out in smaller containers for convenience.</p>  

<h2>Converting Other Syrup Measurements</h2>  
<p>If you're working with different amounts, remember that 1 cup of maple syrup equals 8 ounces. This makes scaling recipes up or down simple. For example, 1.5 cups would be 12 ounces, while 3 cups would be 24 ounces.

<h3>How to Measure Maple Syrup Correctly</h3>  
<p>For the most accurate results, use a liquid measuring cup for maple syrup. Its thick consistency means it can cling to the sides, so always level it off with a spatula. If you're using a kitchen scale, 20 ounces is the equivalent of 2.5 cups, making it easy to weigh for precision.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for Maple Syrup in Air Fryers</h2>  
<p>Maple syrup isn't just for pancakesâ€”it's a fantastic glaze for meats like chicken or turkey in the air fryer. A mix of 2.5 cups (20 ounces) of syrup with spices creates a delicious caramelised coating. For dessert lovers, try drizzling it over air-fried apples or pears for a quick, sweet treat.</p>  

<p>Another great use is in marinades or sauces for vegetables. Toss carrots or sweet potatoes in a blend of maple syrup, olive oil, and herbs before air frying for a caramelised finish.

<h3>Storing Maple Syrup for Longevity</h3>  
<p>To keep your maple syrup fresh, store it in an airtight container in the fridge after opening. This prevents crystallisation and maintains its smooth texture. If you're using 2.5 cups (20 ounces) for meal prep, portion it out in smaller containers for convenience.</p>  

<h2>Converting Other Syrup Measurements</h2>  
<p>If you're working with different amounts, remember that 1 cup of maple syrup equals 8 ounces. This makes scaling recipes up or down simple. For example, 1.5 cups would be 12 ounces, while 3 cups would be 24 ounces.

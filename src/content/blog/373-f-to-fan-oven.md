<p>373 F converts to approximately 190 C in a fan oven. This is the standard equivalent for most modern electric ovens with convection settings, including air fryers which operate on similar principles. Whether you're adapting an American recipe or troubleshooting your air fryer settings, this conversion will ensure your dishes cook evenly.</p>

<h2>Understanding Fan Oven Temperatures</h2>
<p>Fan ovens circulate hot air using a built-in fan, cooking food faster and more evenly than conventional ovens. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we recommend reducing temperatures by 20Â°C when converting from Fahrenheit to Celsius for fan-assisted cooking. This means 373 F (190 C conventional) becomes 170 C in a fan oven setting.</p>
<p>The science behind this adjustment lies in the efficient heat distribution of fan ovens. Since the moving air transfers heat more effectively to food surfaces, you can achieve the same cooking results at slightly lower temperatures. This principle applies equally to air fryers, which are essentially compact, high-powered fan ovens.</p>

<h2>Why 373 F Matters for Air Fryers</h2>
<p>Many popular air fryer recipes, especially for crispy chicken or roasted vegetables, recommend cooking at 373 F. This temperature provides the ideal balance between browning and thorough cooking without burning. When using your air fryer's fan oven equivalent (170 C), you'll achieve that perfect golden crispness.</p>
<p>At this temperature, fats begin to render beautifully while proteins firm up without drying out. It's particularly effective for <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipes</a> where you want crispy skin and juicy meat. Remember that air fryers cook faster than conventional ovens, so always check food 5-10 minutes earlier than recipe times suggest.</p>

<h3>Adjusting Cooking Times</h3>
<p>When converting 373 F to fan oven settings, timing adjustments are just as important as temperature. As a rule, reduce conventional oven times by about 20% when using fan settings. For example, if a recipe states 60 minutes at 373 F conventional, try 45-50 minutes at 170 C fan.</p>

<h2>Common Foods Cooked at 373 F</h2>
<p>Several staple foods achieve perfect results at this temperature. Roast potatoes develop crisp exteriors and fluffy interiors, while chicken wings get that ideal combination of crispy skin and tender meat. Even baked goods like scones benefit from the even heat distribution at 373 F fan oven equivalent.</p>
<p>For frozen foods, the 373 F (170 C fan) setting works wonders. It's hot enough to crisp frozen chips or nuggets without burning the exterior before the interior thaws. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/frozen-foods>frozen food recipes</a> for specific timing recommendations based on your air fryer model.</p>

<h3>Temperature Variations Between Models</h3>
<p>Not all fan ovens or air fryers maintain exactly the same temperatures. Some models may run slightly hotter or cooler than others. We recommend using an oven thermometer to verify your appliance's accuracy, especially when trying new recipes at the 373 F fan oven equivalent.</p>

<h2>Converting Other Common Temperatures</h2>
<p>While 373 F to fan oven conversion is straightforward, other temperatures may require different adjustments. For example, 350 F converts to 160 C conventional or 140 C fan.

<p>Remember that altitude and humidity can affect cooking times and temperatures too. If you live in a particularly humid area or at high elevation, you might need to adjust the 373 F fan oven equivalent slightly. Trial and error will help you perfect your specific setup.</p>

<h3>Maintaining Your Air Fryer</h3>
<p>To ensure accurate temperature readings when cooking at 373 F fan oven settings, regular cleaning is essential. Built-up grease and food particles can affect heat distribution. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning guide</a> shows you how to maintain your appliance for consistent results.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>
<p>Air fryers rely on precise measurements to achieve the perfect texture and doneness. Too much or too little liquid, like 35 ml of water, can affect cooking times and results. For example, adding 35 ml of water to a cake batter versus a sauce requires different adjustments. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> simplifies these calculations for both UK and US cup measurements.</p>
<p>Recipes from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>our collection</a> often specify small liquid quantities like 35 ml for marinades or steam functions. Understanding the cup equivalent helps scale recipes up or down without compromising quality. This is especially useful for meal prep or adapting family-sized dishes to smaller portions.</p>

<h3>How to Measure 35 ml of Water Without a Measuring Cup</h3>
<p>If you don't have a measuring jug, you can use tablespoons to approximate 35 ml of water. Two UK tablespoons (15 ml each) equal 30 ml, plus an extra teaspoon (5 ml) gets you close to 35 ml. For more precise air fryer cooking, we recommend investing in a digital scale or graduated measuring cups from our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>accessories guide</a>.</p>

<h2>Converting 35 ml of Water for Different Recipes</h2>
<p>When baking in your air fryer, 35 ml of water might be used to activate yeast or thin batter. In savoury dishes, this quantity could be part of a sauce or marinade. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>cake recipes</a> frequently use small liquid measurements for perfect rise and moisture balance.</p>
<p>For frozen foods or vegetables, 35 ml of water might be added to create steam. This technique prevents drying while crisping the exterior.

<h3>UK vs US Cup Measurements for 35 ml of Water</h3>
<p>While 35 ml converts to 0.148 UK cups, it's 0.15 US cups due to slight volume differences. For most air fryer recipes, this marginal variance won't affect outcomes. However, for precision baking, always specify which cup measurement your recipe uses.

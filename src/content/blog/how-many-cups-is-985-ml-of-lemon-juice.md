<p>985 ml of lemon juice is approximately 4.16 cups. This conversion is essential for recipes requiring precise measurements, especially when using an air fryer. Whether you're making a zesty marinade or a tangy dessert, knowing how to convert millilitres to cups ensures your dish turns out perfectly. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we understand the importance of accurate measurements for flawless results.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Using the correct amount of lemon juice can make or break a recipe. Too little, and your dish may lack flavour; too much, and it could become overly acidic. For air fryer recipes, precision is key to achieving the right texture and taste. Whether you're following a <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe</a> for lemon drizzle cake or a citrus-glazed chicken, 985 ml of lemon juice converts to roughly 4.16 cups. This measurement is based on the standard UK cup size of 240 ml.</p>  

<p>If you're working with a US recipe, note that their cup measurement is slightly different (236.59 ml). However, the difference is minimal, and 985 ml still rounds to about 4.16 cups. For air fryer cooking, this small variance won’t drastically affect your dish. Always double-check your conversions using a reliable <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a> to avoid mistakes.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure Lemon Juice Correctly</h3>  
<p>For the most accurate results, use a liquid measuring cup rather than dry measuring cups. Fill the cup to the 985 ml mark, or measure out 4 cups plus 2 tablespoons (since 0.16 cups equals roughly 2 tbsp). If you don’t have a measuring cup, a kitchen scale can help—985 ml of lemon juice weighs about 985 grams. This method is especially handy for <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert recipes</a> where precision is crucial.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for 985 ml of Lemon Juice</h2>  
<p>985 ml of lemon juice is a versatile ingredient in both cooking and baking. It’s perfect for making large batches of lemonade, marinades, or salad dressings. In air fryer recipes, it can be used to add a tangy kick to dishes like lemon garlic shrimp or citrus-glazed salmon. For those who love baking, this amount is ideal for lemon curd or a moist lemon drizzle cake.</p>  

<p>If you’re prepping meals in advance, 985 ml of lemon juice can be portioned into smaller containers for future use. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/meal-prep>meal prep section</a> for ideas on how to incorporate citrus flavours into your weekly menu. Remember, freshly squeezed lemon juice offers the best flavour, but bottled juice works in a pinch.</p>  

<h3>Tips for Storing Lemon Juice</h3>  
<p>To keep your lemon juice fresh, store it in an airtight container in the fridge for up to a week. For longer storage, freeze it in ice cube trays—each cube holds about 30 ml, making it easy to thaw the exact amount you need. If you’re using bottled lemon juice, ensure it’s free from additives for the best results in your air fryer recipes.</p>

<h3>How to measure 0.5 tbsp of sunflower oil accurately</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a tablespoon measure handy, a kitchen scale is your best friend. Simply tare your scale, pour the oil until it reads 6.8 grams, and you’re good to go. For those without scales, half a standard UK tablespoon (15ml) is roughly 0.5 tbsp. Remember, sunflower oil’s density means volume and weight aren’t always a 1:1 match.</p>

<p>0.33 cup of chicken broth equals approximately 2.64 ounces. This measurement is handy for air fryer recipes where precision matters. Whether you’re making soups, sauces, or marinades, knowing the exact conversion ensures your dish turns out perfectly. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we focus on making cooking easier with accurate conversions and tasty recipes.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of chicken broth can make or break your air fryer dish. Too little, and your food might dry out; too much, and it could become soggy. The air fryer’s rapid circulation requires balanced moisture for even cooking. That’s why converting 0.33 cup of chicken broth to ounces (2.64 oz) is so useful. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more handy measurements.</p>  

<p>Chicken broth adds depth to marinades and keeps meats juicy in the air fryer. Whether you’re cooking chicken, vegetables, or grains, precise liquid measurements ensure consistency. If you’re experimenting with new recipes, always start with accurate conversions like 0.33 cup to ounces for reliable results. Visit our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipes section</a> for inspiration.</p>  

<h3>How to measure 0.33 cup of chicken broth</h3>  
<p>Measuring 0.33 cup of chicken broth is simple with the right tools. Use a liquid measuring cup with clear markings for accuracy. If you don’t have a 1/3 cup measure, fill a standard cup to just below the 1/3 line. Alternatively, weigh it on a kitchen scale—2.64 ounces is your target. For more tips, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipe category</a>.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for 0.33 cup of chicken broth in air fryer recipes</h2>  
<p>This small but mighty amount of chicken broth works wonders in air fryer cooking. Use it to baste chicken breasts, creating a golden, juicy finish. It’s also perfect for deglazing the air fryer basket after cooking meats. Many <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> favourites, like herb-infused potatoes, benefit from a light broth coating.</p>  

<p>For vegetable dishes, 0.33 cup of chicken broth (2.64 oz) adds flavour without excess liquid. Try it with roasted mushrooms or Brussels sprouts for extra depth. Even air-fried rice or quinoa can absorb this amount beautifully. Need cleaning tips after cooking? Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner guide</a> has you covered.</p>  

<h3>Converting other chicken broth amounts</h3>  
<p>While 0.33 cup equals 2.64 ounces, you might need other conversions. A full cup of chicken broth is roughly 8 ounces, and 0.5 cup equals 4 ounces. These measurements help scale recipes up or down. Always use fresh or properly stored broth for the best air fryer results.</p>

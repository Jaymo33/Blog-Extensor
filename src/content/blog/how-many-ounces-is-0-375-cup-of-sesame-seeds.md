<p>0.375 cup of sesame seeds equals approximately 1.5 ounces (oz). This measurement is essential for air fryer recipes where precision ensures perfect texture and flavour. Whether you're making sesame-crusted chicken or sprinkling seeds over roasted vegetables, knowing this conversion helps avoid kitchen mishaps.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on even heat distribution, so ingredient quantities must be precise. Too many sesame seeds can overcrowd the basket, while too few may leave your dish lacking crunch. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we emphasise the importance of correct measurements for consistent results. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> simplifies these calculations for home cooks.</p>  

<p>Sesame seeds add a nutty flavour and crisp texture to air-fried dishes like tofu or salmon. Measuring 0.375 cup of sesame seeds to ounces ensures you’re using the right amount for coatings or garnishes. If you’re preparing a batch of <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>sesame chicken</a>, this conversion guarantees balanced seasoning every time.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure 0.375 Cup of Sesame Seeds</h3>  
<p>Use a dry measuring cup for accuracy, filling it lightly without packing the seeds down. Level off the top with a straight edge for a true 0.375 cup measurement. For smaller quantities, a kitchen scale is ideal—simply weigh out 1.5 oz of sesame seeds instead.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for 0.375 Cup of Sesame Seeds</h2>  
<p>This quantity is perfect for coating four chicken breasts or a tray of air-fried tofu. It’s also great for sprinkling over <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>roasted vegetables</a> or mixing into homemade granola. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes</a>, you’ll find creative ways to incorporate sesame seeds into your meals.</p>

<h3>Converting Other Sesame Seed Quantities</h3>  
<p>Need to adjust the recipe? Here’s a quick reference: 1 cup of sesame seeds equals 4 oz, so halving that gives 0.5 cup (2 oz), and quartering yields 0.25 cup (1 oz). This makes scaling recipes up or down a breeze.</p>

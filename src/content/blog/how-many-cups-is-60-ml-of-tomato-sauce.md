<p>60 ml of tomato sauce equals approximately ¼ cup. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes, where precise measurements can make or break a dish. Whether you're making a quick pasta sauce or a marinade, knowing how to convert 60 ml of tomato sauce to cups ensures consistency. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we help you master these conversions for flawless cooking every time.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on even heat distribution, so ingredient ratios must be spot-on. Using 60 ml of tomato sauce instead of ¼ cup could throw off the moisture balance in your dish. For example, a sauce that’s too thin won’t coat ingredients properly, while one that’s too thick may burn. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> simplifies these adjustments, so you never have to guess.</p>  

<p>Tomato sauce is a staple in many air fryer recipes, from meatballs to vegetable roasts. Measuring 60 ml of tomato sauce correctly ensures your dish has the right consistency and flavour. If you’re prepping a batch of <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipes</a>, precise sauce measurements help lock in moisture and taste. Trust us, your taste buds will thank you!</p>  

<h3>How to Measure 60 ml of Tomato Sauce Without a Scale</h3>  
<p>No measuring jug? No problem. A standard tablespoon holds about 15 ml, so four tablespoons equal 60 ml of tomato sauce. For cups, fill a ¼ cup measure to the brim—it’s that simple. If you’re using a metric system, a 60 ml medicine cup or small liquid measure works perfectly. Just avoid eyeballing it, as air fryer recipes demand accuracy.</p>  

<h2>Common Recipes Using 60 ml of Tomato Sauce</h2>  
<p>Many air fryer dishes call for 60 ml of tomato sauce, including homemade pizza bases, meatloaf glazes, and dipping sauces. For instance, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer meatball recipe</a> uses exactly 60 ml to keep the mixture tender. The same amount works wonders in <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable stir-fries</a>, adding depth without overwhelming other flavours.</p>  

<p>If you’re baking, 60 ml of tomato sauce can replace oil in some recipes for a healthier twist. Just remember to adjust cooking times slightly, as sauces add moisture. For more tips, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning guide</a> to keep your air fryer in top shape after saucy recipes.</p>  

<h3>Converting 60 ml of Tomato Sauce for Different Dishes</h3>  
<p>Need a thicker sauce? Reduce 60 ml by simmering it for 5 minutes to evaporate excess water. For a thinner consistency, add a splash of broth. These small tweaks ensure your air fryer dishes turn out perfectly every time. And if you’re scaling up, remember: 240 ml equals 1 cup, so adjust accordingly.</p>

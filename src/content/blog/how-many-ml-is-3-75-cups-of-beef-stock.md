<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Cooking</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of liquid, like beef stock, is crucial for achieving the desired texture and flavour in your dishes.

A handy <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a> can save time and prevent mistakes. For example, 3.75 cups of beef stock in the UK or USA converts to the same ml measurement, making it easy to follow any recipe.</p>

<h2>Practical tips for cooking 3.5 kg prawns in your air fryer</h2>
<p>Now that you know 3.5 kg prawns is about 7.72 pounds, let’s talk about how to cook them perfectly in your air fryer. First, ensure your prawns are thoroughly defrosted if frozen, and pat them dry to promote crispiness. Season them well with your favourite spices—a simple mix of garlic powder, paprika, and a pinch of salt works wonders. Preheat your air fryer to 200°C for a few minutes to ensure even cooking from the start. Arrange the prawns in a single layer in the basket, avoiding overcrowding to allow hot air to circulate freely. Cook for 5-7 minutes, shaking halfway, until they’re pink and slightly curled.</p>

<p>For larger batches, like when working with 3.5 kg prawns, you may need to cook in multiple batches to maintain air fryer efficiency. Overloading the basket leads to uneven cooking and soggy results, so patience is key. If you’re meal prepping, cooked prawns can be stored in the fridge for up to three days and reheated quickly in the air fryer for a minute or two. They’re fantastic in salads, pasta, or as a standalone protein.

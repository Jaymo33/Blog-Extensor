<p>2 cups of semolina equals approximately 12 ounces (340 grams). This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes, where precise measurements ensure perfect texture and consistency. Whether you're making crispy semolina-coated chicken or a fluffy semolina cake, knowing the exact weight helps avoid under or over-measuring. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we focus on accuracy to help you achieve the best results every time.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on even heat distribution, and incorrect ingredient quantities can lead to uneven cooking. For example, using too much semolina in a coating can make food overly dry, while too little might not provide enough crunch. Measuring 2 cups of semolina to ounces ensures consistency, especially in recipes like semolina-crusted fish or air-fried falafel. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for other common ingredient conversions.</p>  

<p>Semolina, a coarse wheat flour, is denser than all-purpose flour, so volume-to-weight conversions are crucial. A kitchen scale is the most reliable tool, but if you don’t have one, our guide simplifies the process. For more recipe ideas, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> collection, featuring everything from crispy snacks to hearty meals.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure Semolina Without a Scale</h3>  
<p>If you don’t own a kitchen scale, use the spoon-and-level method for accuracy. Lightly spoon semolina into a measuring cup and level it off with a knife. Avoid packing it down, as this can lead to over-measuring. Remember, 2 cups of semolina to ounces is roughly 12 oz, but slight variations can occur based on humidity and packing density.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for Semolina in Air Fryer Recipes</h2>  
<p>Semolina adds a delightful crunch to air-fried dishes. It’s perfect for coating chicken, fish, or vegetables before air frying. You can also use it in batters for crispy onion rings or as a base for air-fried pizza dough. For inspiration, browse our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipes</a>, where semolina often plays a key role.</p>  

<p>Beyond coatings, semolina works well in air-fried desserts like semolina halva or cakes. Its granular texture helps create a crisp exterior while keeping the inside moist. If you’re new to air frying, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning guide</a> ensures your appliance stays in top condition for perfect results every time.</p>  

<h3>Adjusting Recipes for UK Measurements</h3>  
<p>In the UK, recipes often use grams rather than ounces. If your air fryer recipe calls for 2 cups of semolina in ounces, remember that 12 oz equals about 340 grams. This adjustment is handy when following international recipes or using digital scales set to metric measurements.</p>

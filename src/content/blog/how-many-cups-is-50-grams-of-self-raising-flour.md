<p>50 grams of self-raising flour equals approximately 0.4 cups (or roughly 1/3 cup plus 1 tablespoon). This conversion is essential for air fryer baking, where precise measurements can make or break your recipe. Whether you're whipping up a quick cake or crispy doughnuts, knowing how to measure 50 grams of self-raising flour in cups ensures consistent results every time.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Baking</h2>
<p>Air fryers cook food faster and more evenly than traditional ovens, which means your ingredients need to be spot-on. Using too much or too little self-raising flour can affect the texture and rise of your baked goods. For example, 50 grams of self-raising flour is perfect for small batches of scones or muffins in your air fryer.

<p>Self-raising flour already contains baking powder, so it's a popular choice for quick bakes. If you're converting 50 grams to cups, remember that flour can settle or become compacted. Always fluff the flour with a fork before measuring to ensure accuracy. For more air fryer baking tips, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipes section</a>.</p>

<h2>How to Measure 50 Grams of Self-Raising Flour Without Scales</h2>
<p>Not everyone has kitchen scales handy, but you can still measure 50 grams of self-raising flour using cups. A standard UK cup holds about 120 grams of self-raising flour, so 50 grams is roughly 1/3 cup plus 1 tablespoon. For US cups, which are slightly larger, 50 grams is closer to 0.4 cups. Spoon the flour into the cup lightly and level it off with a knife for the best results.</p>
<p>If you're making air fryer cakes or cookies, this method works well. Just avoid packing the flour down, as it can lead to dense bakes. For more precision, consider investing in a set of digital scales. They're a game-changer for air fryer recipes, especially when working with small quantities like 50 grams of self-raising flour.</p>

<h3>UK vs US Cup Measurements for Self-Raising Flour</h3>
<p>It's worth noting that UK and US cup sizes differ slightly. A UK cup is 250ml, while a US cup is 240ml. This means 50 grams of self-raising flour will take up a tad more space in a UK cup. For most air fryer recipes, the difference is negligible, but it's good to be aware of if you're following international recipes.</p>

<h2>Common Air Fryer Recipes Using 50 Grams of Self-Raising Flour</h2>

<h3>Storing Self-Raising Flour for Best Results</h3>
<p>To keep your self-raising flour fresh, store it in an airtight container in a cool, dry place. The baking powder in self-raising flour can lose its potency over time, affecting how your 50-gram measurements perform in recipes. If your flour is older than six months, consider testing it before use in important bakes.</p>

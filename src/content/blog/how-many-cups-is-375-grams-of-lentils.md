<p>375 grams of lentils is roughly equivalent to 1.9 cups when measured uncooked. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes, where precise measurements can make or break a dish. Whether you're making a hearty lentil stew or crispy air-fried lentil falafels, knowing how to convert grams to cups ensures consistency. For more handy conversions, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of lentils ensures your air fryer dishes cook evenly and taste perfect. Too many lentils can overcrowd the basket, leading to uneven cooking, while too few might dry out. Lentils are a staple in many air fryer recipes, from protein-packed snacks to full meals. If you're new to air frying, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipes</a> for inspiration.</p>  

<p>Different types of lentils—green, red, or brown—have slightly varying densities, but 375 grams generally converts to about 1.9 cups. For best results, fluff the lentils lightly before measuring to avoid compacting them. This small step can make a big difference in your cooking accuracy.</p>  

<h3>Converting 375 Grams of Lentils to Cups</h3>  
<p>To measure 375 grams of lentils in cups, use a standard measuring cup and fill it loosely. Avoid pressing the lentils down, as this can lead to an inaccurate measurement. If precision is crucial, a kitchen scale is your best friend—especially for air fryer recipes where balance is key.</p>  

<h3>Common Uses for 375 Grams of Lentils</h3>  
<p>375 grams of lentils is perfect for batch cooking. You can make air-fried lentil patties, lentil soups, or even lentil-based dips. For meal prep ideas, browse our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/meal-prep>meal prep category</a>. Lentils are versatile, nutritious, and work brilliantly in an air fryer.</p>  

<h2>Tips for Cooking Lentils in an Air Fryer</h2>  
<p>Pre-soaking lentils can reduce cooking time and improve texture in air fryer dishes. Drain them well before adding seasoning or oil to avoid sogginess. For crispy results, toss the lentils lightly in oil and air fry at 180°C for 12-15 minutes, shaking the basket halfway.</p>  

<p>Keep your air fryer in top condition by cleaning it regularly. A dirty basket can affect cooking performance—learn how to maintain it with our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner guide</a>. Proper care ensures your lentils and other dishes cook perfectly every time.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Flour Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of self-raising flour is crucial for achieving the perfect texture in your baked goods. Too much flour can make your cakes dense, while too little can leave them flat. Air fryer recipes, like those on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, rely on precise measurements for consistent results. Whether you’re baking a Victoria sponge or fluffy scones, 375 grams of self-raising flour should translate to roughly 3 cups. Always spoon the flour into the cup and level it off for accuracy.</p>

<h3>How to Measure 375 Grams of Self-Raising Flour Without Scales</h3>

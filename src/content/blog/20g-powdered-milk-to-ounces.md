<p>20g of powdered milk equals approximately 0.71 ounces. This conversion is essential when following air fryer recipes that require precise measurements, especially for baked goods where ingredient ratios matter. Whether you're making air fryer cakes or creamy sauces, knowing how to convert 20g powdered milk to ounces ensures consistent results every time.</p>

<h2>Why accurate powdered milk measurements matter</h2>
<p>Powdered milk behaves differently than liquid milk in recipes, so getting the 20g to ounces conversion right affects texture and flavour. Too much can make baked goods dry, while too little might leave sauces watery. Many air fryer recipes at <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes</a> use powdered milk for its shelf stability and concentrated flavour.</p>
<p>When converting 20g powdered milk to oz UK measurements, remember that 1 ounce equals about 28.35 grams. This means 20 grams is just under three-quarters of an ounce. For most home cooking purposes, rounding to 0.7 ounces works perfectly fine without sacrificing recipe quality.</p>

<h2>How to measure 20g powdered milk without scales</h2>
<p>If you don't have digital scales, you can still measure 20g of powdered milk (approximately 0.71 ounces) using volume measurements. One level tablespoon of powdered milk typically weighs about 6-7 grams, so 20g would be roughly 3 slightly heaped tablespoons. However, for best results in air fryer baking, we recommend using proper scales.</p>
<p>Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> includes common ingredient weights to help with these kitchen calculations. When working with powdered milk specifically, always fluff it up in the container before scooping to prevent compacted measurements that could throw off your 20g to ounces conversion.</p>

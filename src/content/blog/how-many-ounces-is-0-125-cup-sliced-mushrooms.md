However, for 0.125 cup of sliced mushrooms, the difference is minimal - roughly 1 ounce across most common types.

For precise measurements in air fryer recipes, it's best to slice first then measure. Remember that 0.125 cup of sliced mushrooms equals approximately 1 ounce by weight, which is more reliable than counting individual mushrooms."

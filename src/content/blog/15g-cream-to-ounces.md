<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of cream in your air fryer recipes ensures consistency and taste. Too much cream can make dishes soggy, while too little might leave them dry.

If you're new to air frying, visit <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> for beginner-friendly tips and tricks.</p>  

<p>Many UK recipes list cream in grams, but if you're using a scale that measures in ounces, this conversion is a lifesaver. Whether you're making a <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert</a> or a savoury dish, 15g of cream (0.53 oz) is a common measurement you'll encounter. Keep this conversion handy to avoid kitchen mishaps.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure 15g of Cream Without Scales</h3>  
<p>If you don't have kitchen scales, you can use tablespoons to measure 15g of cream. One tablespoon of cream weighs roughly 15g, but this can vary slightly depending on thickness. For best results, use a proper measuring spoon and level it off. This method works well for recipes like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer sauces</a> or creamy dips.</p>  

<h2>Common Recipes Using 15g of Cream</h2>  
<p>Many air fryer recipes call for small amounts of cream, such as 15g. This includes creamy pasta sauces, mashed potatoes, or even air fryer pancakes. The key is to measure accurately to maintain the dish's texture and flavour. For inspiration, browse our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/breakfast>breakfast recipes</a> featuring cream.</p>  

<p>Another popular use for 15g of cream is in air fryer desserts like custards or mousses. The small quantity ensures richness without overpowering other ingredients. If you're cleaning your air fryer after a creamy dish, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning guide</a> has you covered.</p>  

<h3>Converting Other Cream Measurements</h3>  
<p>If your recipe calls for more or less cream, the same conversion principle applies. For example, 30g of cream is roughly 1.06 ounces, while 50g is about 1.76 ounces. Keep a conversion chart handy for quick reference, especially when experimenting with new air fryer recipes.</p>

<p>50 grams of rice equals approximately 0.25 cups in the UK and 0.21 cups in the US. This conversion is essential for precise cooking, especially when using an air fryer, where ingredient measurements can impact texture and cooking time. Whether you're making a quick rice dish or meal prepping, knowing how to convert grams to cups ensures consistency. For more handy conversions, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Rice Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Getting the right amount of rice is crucial for perfect results, especially in an air fryer. Too much rice can lead to uneven cooking, while too little might dry out. 50 grams of rice is a common portion for single servings or side dishes, making it a useful measurement to know. If you're new to air frying, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> for inspiration. Accurate conversions ensure your meals turn out just right every time.</p>  

<p>Different types of rice, like basmati or jasmine, may vary slightly in volume, but 50 grams generally falls within the 0.21–0.25 cup range. For fluffy, well-cooked rice, always measure carefully. If you're cooking for a crowd, scaling up is easy once you know the base conversion. Keep this guide handy for stress-free meal prep!</p>  

<h3>UK vs. US Cup Measurements</h3>  
<p>In the UK, a standard cup holds 250ml, while in the US, it's 240ml. This small difference means 50 grams of rice converts to roughly 0.25 cups in the UK and 0.21 cups in the US. If precision matters, use a kitchen scale for grams or a dedicated measuring cup. For more tips on perfect rice dishes, browse our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable recipes</a> that pair beautifully with rice.</p>  

<h2>How to Measure 50 Grams of Rice Without Scales</h2>  
<p>No kitchen scale? No problem! You can estimate 50 grams of rice using a standard tablespoon. Roughly 3 level tablespoons of uncooked rice equal about 50 grams. This method isn't as precise as weighing but works in a pinch. For best results, fluff the rice lightly before measuring to avoid compacting it. If you love rice-based meals, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/meal-prep>meal prep recipes</a> offer great ideas for batch cooking.</p>  

<p>Another trick is to use a clean shot glass, which often holds around 50 grams of rice when filled to the brim. Remember, these methods are approximations—investing in a small scale ensures accuracy.

<h3>Cooking Rice in an Air Fryer</h3>  
<p>Air fryers aren't just for crispy foods—they can cook rice perfectly too! For 50 grams of rice, use about 100ml of water and cook at 180°C for 12–15 minutes. Stir halfway through for even results. Experiment with timings based on your air fryer model. Visit <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> for more expert tips on air fryer cooking.</p>

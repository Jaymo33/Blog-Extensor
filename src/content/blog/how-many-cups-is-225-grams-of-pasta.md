Let’s break down how to measure 225 grams of pasta in cups for both UK and US standards.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Pasta Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of pasta ensures your air fryer dishes cook evenly and taste perfect.

That’s why weighing pasta is often more reliable than using cups alone.

Remember, 225 grams of pasta in cups is a starting point—adjust based on your preferred texture and recipe.</p>  

<h2>UK vs. US Cup Measurements for Pasta</h2>  
<p>In the UK, a standard cup holds 250ml, while in the US, it’s 240ml. This small difference means 225 grams of pasta might fill slightly more or less of a cup depending on where you are. For UK cooks, 225 grams of pasta is about 2.25 cups, while in the US, it’s closer to 2.3 cups. If precision matters, stick to grams or use a kitchen scale. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable pasta recipes</a> often call for exact measurements to balance flavours.</p>  

<h3>Common Pasta Types and Their Cup Equivalents</h3>  
<p>Short pasta like macaroni or rigatoni will measure differently than long strands like linguine. For 225 grams of pasta, expect about 2.25 cups for most short varieties. Spaghetti, however, might appear less dense in a cup due to its shape. Always fluff the pasta lightly when measuring to avoid compaction.

<h2>How to Adjust Cooking Times for 225 Grams of Pasta</h2>  
<p>Air fryers cook pasta faster than traditional methods, so timing is critical. For 225 grams of pasta, pre-cook it al dente before air frying to avoid mushiness. Most recipes recommend 8–10 minutes in the air fryer for crispy textures. If you’re making a pasta bake, layer ingredients evenly for consistent results.

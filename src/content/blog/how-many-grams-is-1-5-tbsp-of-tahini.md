<p>1.5 tablespoons (tbsp) of tahini equals approximately 24 grams. This conversion is essential for precise cooking, especially when using an air fryer where measurements can make or break a dish. Whether you're making hummus, dressings, or marinades, knowing the exact weight ensures consistency. Tahini's thick texture means volume measurements can vary, so grams provide accuracy. Bookmark this guide for quick reference when cooking with tahini in your air fryer.</p>

<h2>Why converting tahini from tbsp to grams matters</h2>
<p>When using tahini in air fryer recipes, accuracy is key. Volume measurements like tablespoons can be inconsistent due to tahini's dense, sticky nature. Converting 1.5 tbsp of tahini to grams (24g) gives you a precise weight that won't change with how you scoop it. This is particularly important for recipes where tahini acts as a binding agent or main flavour component. Many air fryer dishes, from crispy tofu to Middle Eastern-inspired meats, rely on tahini's unique properties. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes</a>, you'll find numerous dishes where this conversion comes in handy.</p>

<p>Tahini's thickness means it can settle or separate in the jar, affecting volume measurements. By using grams instead of tablespoons, you eliminate this variability. This is especially useful when scaling recipes up or down for your air fryer. Whether you're meal prepping or cooking for one, gram measurements ensure your tahini-based sauces and marinades turn out perfect every time. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more handy measurement conversions.</p>

<h3>How to measure 1.5 tbsp of tahini accurately</h3>
<p>To measure 24 grams (1.5 tbsp) of tahini, use a digital kitchen scale for best results. First, place your mixing bowl on the scale and tare it to zero. Then, slowly add tahini until you reach 24 grams. If you don't have scales, use a standard tablespoon and level it off with a knife for each scoop. Remember that tahini's thickness means it won't pour easily - you may need to stir it well first. For perfect air fryer recipes every time, precise measurements make all the difference.</p>

<h2>Common uses for 1.5 tbsp of tahini in air fryer cooking</h2>
<p>1.5 tbsp (24g) of tahini is the perfect amount for many air fryer recipes. It's enough to create a flavourful marinade for chicken or vegetables without overpowering other ingredients. Try mixing it with lemon juice, garlic and spices for a Middle Eastern-inspired coating. You'll find excellent tahini-based marinade ideas in our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipe category</a>.</p>

<p>This quantity also works well for dressings and dips to accompany air-fried dishes. Combine 24g tahini with yoghurt, lemon and cumin for a creamy sauce perfect with falafel or roasted vegetables. When making homemade hummus for your air fryer snacks, 1.5 tbsp of tahini provides just the right nutty depth. Remember to store your tahini properly to maintain its quality for future recipes.</p>

<h3>Tahini measurement tips for air fryer success</h3>
<p>Always stir tahini well before measuring, as the oil tends to separate. For the most accurate 1.5 tbsp (24g) measurement, use room temperature tahini rather than straight from the fridge. If your recipe calls for multiple tahini measurements, clean your spoon or scale between uses to prevent buildup. These small steps ensure your air fryer dishes turn out perfectly seasoned every time.

<h2>Converting other tahini quantities to grams</h2>
<p>While 1.5 tbsp equals 24 grams, you might need other conversions for different recipes. One tablespoon of tahini is approximately 16 grams, while two tablespoons equal about 32 grams. These conversions are handy when adjusting air fryer recipe quantities. Whether you're making a large batch or a single serving, gram measurements provide consistency. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a> includes these and other common tahini measurements.</p>

<p>Remember that different tahini brands may vary slightly in density, so weights aren't always exact. However, these conversions provide a reliable starting point for most air fryer cooking. When precision is crucial, like in baking or sauce-making, always opt for gram measurements over volume. This approach eliminates guesswork and delivers restaurant-quality results from your air fryer every time.</p>

<h3>Storing tahini for accurate measurements</h3>
<p>Proper storage helps maintain tahini's consistency for accurate 1.5 tbsp (24g) measurements. Keep your tahini jar tightly sealed in a cool, dark place. Stir well before each use to reincorporate any separated oil. If storing for long periods, refrigeration can extend shelf life - just remember to bring to room temperature before measuring. These practices ensure your tahini stays fresh and measures consistently for all your air fryer creations.</p>

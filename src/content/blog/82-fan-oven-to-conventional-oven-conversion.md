<p>Fan ovens circulate hot air around the food, cooking it more evenly and quickly than conventional ovens. This means temperatures in fan ovens are typically set 20°C lower than conventional ovens. When converting 82 fan oven to conventional oven, you need to add this temperature difference. This principle applies whether you're baking cakes or roasting vegetables in your air fryer.</p>
<p>The 82 fan oven to celsius conversion is particularly useful for air fryer users. Since air fryers work similarly to fan ovens, understanding this conversion helps when following traditional oven recipes.

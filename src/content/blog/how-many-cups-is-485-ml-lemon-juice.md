<p>485 ml of lemon juice is approximately 2.05 cups. This conversion is essential for baking, cooking, or preparing air fryer recipes where precise measurements matter. Whether you're making a tangy lemon drizzle cake or marinating chicken, knowing the exact cup equivalent ensures your dish turns out perfectly.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Cooking</h2>  
<p>Precision is key when working with ingredients like lemon juice, as too much or too little can drastically alter the taste of your dish. For air fryer recipes, where flavours are concentrated, getting the right balance is even more crucial. A slight miscalculation could make your dish overly tart or bland.</p>  
<p>If you're following a recipe from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, you'll often find measurements in millilitres or cups. Knowing how to convert between the two ensures you never go wrong. Whether you're making lemon-infused salmon or a zesty dessert, accurate conversions guarantee consistent results every time.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure 485 ml of Lemon Juice</h3>  
<p>To measure 485 ml of lemon juice, you can use a liquid measuring cup marked with millilitres or cups. If your cup measures in imperial units, remember that 1 cup equals roughly 237 ml. For 485 ml, you’d need just over 2 cups (2.05 cups to be exact). This is especially useful when scaling recipes up or down.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for 485 ml of Lemon Juice</h2>  
<p>Lemon juice is a versatile ingredient used in everything from marinades to desserts. If you're preparing a dish like lemon garlic shrimp in your air fryer, 485 ml of lemon juice would be enough for multiple servings. It’s also perfect for making lemon curd or a large batch of lemonade.</p>  
<p>For more recipe ideas, check out the <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert section</a> on airfryerrecipe.co.uk, where lemon-based treats are a staple. Whether you're baking or cooking, knowing how many cups 485 ml of lemon juice equals helps streamline your prep work.</p>  

<h3>Converting Other Lemon Juice Measurements</h3>  
<p>If your recipe calls for a different amount of lemon juice, you can use the same conversion ratio. For example, 250 ml is roughly 1.06 cups, while 500 ml is about 2.11 cups. Keeping a <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a> handy saves time and ensures accuracy in the kitchen.</p>  

<h2>Tips for Storing Lemon Juice</h2>  
<p>Freshly squeezed lemon juice can be stored in the fridge for up to a week. If you’ve measured out 485 ml but only need half, freeze the rest in ice cube trays for future use. This way, you’ll always have lemon juice ready for air fryer recipes or quick salad dressings.</p>  
<p>For more kitchen hacks, explore <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, where you’ll find tips on everything from meal prep to cleaning your air fryer. Proper storage ensures your ingredients stay fresh and ready for your next culinary adventure.</p>  

<h3>Adjusting Recipes for Personal Taste</h3>  
<p>While 485 ml of lemon juice equals roughly 2.05 cups, you can adjust this based on your preference. If you love a stronger citrus kick, add a splash more. For milder flavours, reduce the amount slightly. Cooking is an art, and conversions are just a starting point.</p>

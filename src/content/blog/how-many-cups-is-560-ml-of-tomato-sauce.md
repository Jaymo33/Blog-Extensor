<p>560 ml of tomato sauce equals approximately 2.37 cups. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes, ensuring precise measurements for sauces, marinades, or baking. Whether you're following a British or American recipe, knowing how to convert millilitres to cups guarantees consistent results. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we simplify these conversions so you can focus on cooking.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Using the correct amount of tomato sauce ensures your dishes aren’t too dry or overly saucy. Air fryers rely on even heat distribution, and precise measurements help maintain balance. For example, 560 ml of tomato sauce in cups (2.37) is perfect for coating pasta or as a base for <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipes</a>. Too much sauce can lead to soggy results, while too little may dry out your meal.</p>  

<p>Many air fryer recipes, like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>stuffed peppers or meatballs</a>, require exact sauce quantities. A slight variation can alter texture and flavour. If you’re scaling a recipe, converting 560 ml of tomato sauce to cups ensures consistency. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a> makes it easy to adjust measurements without guesswork.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure 560 ml of Tomato Sauce Without a Scale</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a measuring jug, use standard cups for accuracy. One UK metric cup holds 250 ml, so 560 ml is just over two cups (2 cups + 2 tbsp). For US cups (240 ml), it’s roughly 2.37 cups. Stir the sauce first, as thickness can affect volume. This method works for <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable dips</a> or pizza bases too.</p>  

<h2>Common Recipes Using 560 ml of Tomato Sauce</h2>  
<p>This quantity is ideal for family-sized portions. Try it in air fryer lasagna, where 560 ml of tomato sauce (2.37 cups) layers perfectly between pasta sheets. It’s also great for <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/beef>beef patties</a> or shakshuka. Since air fryers cook faster, the sauce reduces slightly, so starting with the right amount is key.</p>  

<p>For meal prep, 560 ml of tomato sauce converts neatly to cups for freezing. Divide it into 2-cup portions for future <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>easy clean-up</a>. Whether you’re making marinara or curry, precise measurements save time and reduce waste. Check our site for recipes tailored to this measurement.</p>  

<h3>Adjusting Recipes for Different Cup Sizes</h3>  
<p>British and American cup sizes differ slightly. If a recipe calls for 560 ml of tomato sauce (UK), use 2.37 US cups. For thicker sauces, like passata, spoon it into the cup without packing. Runny sauces should be levelled off. This ensures your <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/potatoes>potato bakes</a> or casseroles turn out perfectly every time.</p>

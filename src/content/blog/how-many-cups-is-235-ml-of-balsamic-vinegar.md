<p>235 ml of balsamic vinegar equals approximately 1 cup in US measurements or just under 1 cup (0.98 cups) in UK measurements. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes, where precise measurements can make or break a dish. Whether you’re whipping up a glaze, marinade, or dressing, knowing how many cups is 235 ml of balsamic vinegar ensures consistent results. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we focus on making conversions simple so your cooking stays hassle-free.</p>  

<h2>Understanding Balsamic Vinegar Measurements</h2>  
<p>Balsamic vinegar is a staple in many kitchens, especially for air fryer recipes like glazed chicken or roasted vegetables. When a recipe calls for 235 ml of balsamic vinegar, it’s helpful to know the cup equivalent. In the US, 1 cup is 240 ml, so 235 ml is just shy of a full cup. In the UK, where 1 cup is 250 ml, 235 ml translates to roughly 0.98 cups. This small difference might not seem significant, but for baking or reducing sauces, precision matters.</p>  

<p>If you’re using an air fryer, measuring liquids accurately ensures even cooking and perfect flavour balance. For example, a marinade with 235 ml of balsamic vinegar might need slight adjustments if you’re working with UK or US cup sizes. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more handy measurement tips.</p>  

<h3>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h3>  
<p>Air fryers rely on precise cooking times and ingredient ratios to deliver crispy, evenly cooked meals. Too much or too little liquid, like balsamic vinegar, can affect texture and taste. For instance, 235 ml of balsamic vinegar in a glaze might reduce differently if measured incorrectly, leading to overly sticky or thin results. Always use a measuring jug or digital scale for the best accuracy.</p>  

<h2>Converting 235 ml of Balsamic Vinegar for Recipes</h2>  
<p>Many air fryer recipes, especially those for meats or vegetables, use balsamic vinegar for its rich, tangy flavour. If a recipe lists 235 ml of balsamic vinegar, you can confidently use 1 US cup or 0.98 UK cups. For dishes like balsamic-glazed salmon or roasted Brussels sprouts, this measurement ensures the right balance of sweetness and acidity.</p>  

<p>If you’re scaling a recipe up or down, remember that 235 ml of balsamic vinegar is roughly 15.8 tablespoons or 47.3 teaspoons. This flexibility is handy when experimenting with smaller batches or adjusting flavours. Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> for inspiration on using balsamic vinegar creatively.</p>  

<h3>Common Uses for 235 ml of Balsamic Vinegar</h3>  
<p>From marinades to reductions, 235 ml of balsamic vinegar is a versatile quantity. Try it in an air fryer chicken marinade, drizzled over roasted vegetables, or reduced into a syrup for drizzling. The key is measuring correctly—whether you’re using cups, millilitres, or tablespoons.</p>  

<h2>Tips for Measuring Balsamic Vinegar in an Air Fryer</h2>  
<p>When working with sticky liquids like balsamic vinegar, a silicone measuring cup or spoon makes cleanup easier. For 235 ml of balsamic vinegar, lightly grease the measuring tool to prevent sticking. If you’re reducing the vinegar in the air fryer, keep an eye on it—235 ml can reduce to a thick glaze in about 10-15 minutes at 180°C.</p>

<h3>Adjusting Recipes for UK vs. US Measurements</h3>  
<p>If you’re following a US recipe that calls for 235 ml of balsamic vinegar, remember that UK cups are slightly larger. For absolute precision, use a digital scale set to grams (235 ml of balsamic vinegar weighs about 252 grams). This eliminates any guesswork and guarantees perfect results every time.</p>

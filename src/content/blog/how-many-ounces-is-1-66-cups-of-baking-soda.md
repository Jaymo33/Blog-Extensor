<p>1.66 cups of baking soda equals approximately 13.28 ounces (oz). This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes, ensuring your measurements are spot-on for perfect results every time. Whether you're whipping up crispy treats or fluffy cakes, precise quantities make all the difference.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Baking Soda Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of baking soda ensures your air fryer recipes rise properly and taste just right. Too little, and your dish might turn out dense; too much, and you could end up with a bitter aftertaste. That’s why converting 1.66 cups of baking soda to ounces (13.28 oz) is so important. For more handy conversions, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>  

<p>Baking soda is a leavening agent, meaning it helps batters and doughs expand. In an air fryer, where heat circulates rapidly, precise measurements prevent uneven cooking. Whether you're making cookies or savoury snacks, 1.66 cups of baking soda (13.28 oz) ensures consistency. Visit <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>our recipe hub</a> for inspiration.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure Baking Soda Correctly</h3>  
<p>For the most accurate results, use a kitchen scale to weigh your baking soda. Scooping directly from the bag can lead to packed cups, altering the measurement. Lightly spoon the baking soda into your measuring cup, then level it off for 1.66 cups (13.28 oz). This method guarantees precision, especially for air fryer baking.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for 1.66 Cups of Baking Soda</h2>  
<p>Beyond baking, 1.66 cups of baking soda (13.28 oz) can be used for cleaning your air fryer. A paste made with water removes stubborn grease and odours. Check out our guide on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning your air fryer</a> for more tips.</p>  

<p>In cooking, this quantity is ideal for large batches of air fryer-friendly cakes or bread. For savoury dishes, try our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/potatoes>potato recipes</a>, where baking soda helps achieve extra crispiness. Remember, 1.66 cups equals 13.28 oz—measure carefully!</p>  

<h3>Adjusting Recipes for Different Quantities</h3>  
<p>If your recipe calls for more or less than 1.66 cups of baking soda, simply scale the ounces proportionally. For example, half the amount (0.83 cups) would be 6.64 oz. Always double-check conversions to avoid mishaps in your air fryer creations.</p>

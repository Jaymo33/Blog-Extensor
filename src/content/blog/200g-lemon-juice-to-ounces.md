<p>200g of lemon juice equals approximately 7.05 ounces. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements can make or break your dish. Whether you’re whipping up a zesty marinade or a tangy glaze, knowing how to convert grams to ounces ensures consistency. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we focus on making cooking simpler, so you can focus on flavour. Let’s dive deeper into why this conversion matters and how to use it in your kitchen.</p>

<h2>Why convert 200g of lemon juice to ounces?</h2>  
<p>Converting 200g of lemon juice to ounces is crucial for accuracy, especially in air fryer cooking. Air fryers rely on precise ingredient ratios to achieve the perfect texture and taste. A slight miscalculation can lead to overly soggy or dry results. For example, if you’re making a lemon-infused chicken dish, the right amount of lemon juice ensures balanced acidity. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> simplifies these measurements, so you never have to second-guess.</p>  

<p>Lemon juice is a common ingredient in marinades, dressings, and glazes for air fryer recipes. Whether you’re preparing a citrusy salmon or a refreshing vegetable side, 200g of lemon juice (7.05 ounces) is a handy measurement to know. Many UK recipes use grams, while others prefer ounces, so having this conversion at your fingertips saves time. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipes section</a> for inspiration on how to use lemon juice in your air fryer creations.</p>  

<h3>How to measure 200g of lemon juice accurately</h3>  
<p>To measure 200g of lemon juice, use a digital kitchen scale for the most precise results. Place your container on the scale, tare it to zero, then pour the juice until it reaches 200g. If you don’t have a scale, 200g is roughly 7.05 ounces, which equates to just under a cup (since 1 cup of lemon juice is about 8.5 ounces). For air fryer recipes, accuracy ensures even cooking and perfect flavour balance. Need more tips? Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning guide</a> keeps your air fryer in top shape for precise cooking.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for 200g of lemon juice in air fryer recipes</h2>  
<p>200g of lemon juice (7.05 ounces) is a versatile quantity for many air fryer dishes. It’s perfect for marinating chicken, fish, or tofu, adding a bright, tangy flavour. For example, a lemon-garlic marinade for chicken thighs uses this amount to tenderise and infuse the meat. You can also drizzle it over roasted vegetables or mix it into a glaze for desserts. Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipes</a> for ideas on incorporating lemon juice into your meals.</p>  

<p>Another great use for 200g of lemon juice is in air fryer seafood dishes. A lemon-butter sauce for salmon or shrimp enhances the natural flavours without overpowering them. The acidity also helps break down proteins, resulting in tender, juicy seafood. If you’re new to air fryer cooking, start with simple recipes like lemon-pepper cod or citrus-marinated tofu. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/seafood>seafood category</a> offers plenty of inspiration for your next meal.</p>  

<h3>Tips for storing leftover lemon juice</h3>  
<p>If you don’t use all 200g of lemon juice at once, store it in an airtight container in the fridge for up to a week. You can also freeze it in ice cube trays for longer storage. This way, you’ll always have lemon juice on hand for impromptu air fryer recipes. For more storage and meal prep tips, visit <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>.</p>

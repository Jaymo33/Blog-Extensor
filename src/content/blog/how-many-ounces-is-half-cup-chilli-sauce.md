<p>0.5 cup of chilli sauce equals approximately 4 ounces. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements can make or break a dish. Whether you're whipping up a spicy glaze or a marinade, knowing how many ounces are in 0.5 cup of chilli sauce ensures consistency. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we focus on accuracy to help you nail every recipe.</p>

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on even cooking, and incorrect measurements can throw off textures and flavours. For example, using too much chilli sauce might make a dish overly spicy or soggy. Conversely, too little could leave it bland. Converting 0.5 cup of chilli sauce to ounces (4 oz) helps maintain balance. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more handy tips.</p>  

<p>Many air fryer recipes, like glazed chicken wings or spicy tofu, call for precise sauce quantities. If you're adapting a recipe from cups to ounces, this conversion is a game-changer. For more inspiration, browse our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipes</a> that often use chilli sauce.</p>  

<h3>How to measure 0.5 cup of chilli sauce correctly</h3>  
<p>Use a liquid measuring cup for accuracy, filling it to the 0.5 cup mark. For thicker sauces, level it off with a spatula. If you don’t have measuring cups, 4 ounces of chilli sauce is roughly 120 millilitres. A kitchen scale can also help verify the weight.

<h2>Common uses for 0.5 cup of chilli sauce in air fryer recipes</h2>

<h3>Converting other cup measurements to ounces</h3>  
<p>If a recipe calls for 1 cup of chilli sauce, that’s about 8 ounces. For smaller amounts, 0.25 cup equals 2 ounces. These conversions are handy when scaling recipes up or down. Always double-check weights for thick sauces, as density can vary. Need help cleaning sticky sauce residue?

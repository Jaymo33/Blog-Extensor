<p>500g of soy sauce equals approximately 17.64 ounces. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements can make or break a dish. Whether you're marinating chicken or whipping up a stir-fry, knowing how to convert grams to ounces ensures consistency. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we help simplify cooking conversions so you can focus on flavour.</p>  

<h2>Why Convert 500g of Soy Sauce to Ounces?</h2>  
<p>Many air fryer recipes, especially those from the UK, use metric measurements like grams. However, some kitchen scales or recipes might require ounces. Converting 500g of soy sauce to ounces (17.64 oz) ensures accuracy, whether you're following a <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe</a> or improvising. Precision matters in air frying, as too much or too little liquid can affect texture and cooking time.</p>  

<p>For example, if you're making a teriyaki glaze, 500g of soy sauce (17.64 oz) might seem like a lot, but it’s perfect for batch cooking. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a> for other common ingredient swaps. This way, you’ll never second-guess measurements again.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure 500g of Soy Sauce Accurately</h3>  
<p>Use a digital kitchen scale for the most accurate conversion of 500g soy sauce to ounces. Set the scale to grams, pour the soy sauce until it hits 500g, then switch to ounces to see the equivalent (17.64 oz). If you don’t have a scale, remember that 1 fluid ounce of soy sauce weighs roughly 28.35g, so 500g is just under 18 fluid ounces.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for 500g of Soy Sauce in Air Fryer Recipes</h2>  
<p>500g of soy sauce (17.64 oz) is ideal for marinating proteins like chicken, beef, or tofu. Try it in our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>air fryer chicken recipes</a> for a flavour boost. It’s also great for stir-fry sauces or glazes, where the salty-umami taste enhances the dish. Since air fryers cook quickly, a well-measured marinade ensures even flavour distribution.</p>  

<p>Another tip: dilute 500g of soy sauce with water or vinegar for a lighter seasoning. This works well for <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable dishes</a>, preventing over-salting. Always clean your air fryer basket after using sticky sauces—our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning guide</a> makes it hassle-free.</p>  

<h3>Does Soy Sauce Weight Vary by Brand?</h3>  
<p>Most soy sauces have a similar density, so 500g will consistently equal about 17.64 ounces. However, low-sodium or thick varieties might slightly differ. Always check the label if precision is critical, especially for dietary needs.</p>

<p>1 cup of baking soda equals approximately 8 ounces. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes, where precise measurements ensure perfect results. Whether you're whipping up crispy snacks or fluffy cakes, knowing this conversion helps avoid kitchen mishaps. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we emphasise accuracy for flawless cooking every time.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Baking soda is a key ingredient in many air fryer recipes, from crispy coatings to fluffy batters. Using the right amount ensures your food cooks evenly and tastes great. Too much baking soda can leave a bitter taste, while too little might affect texture. That’s why knowing how many ounces are in 1 cup of baking soda is crucial. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more handy measurements.</p>  

<p>Air fryers rely on precise ingredient ratios to achieve the perfect crispiness. Whether you're making chicken wings or baking a cake, accurate measurements make all the difference. Baking soda, in particular, reacts with other ingredients, so getting the amount right is non-negotiable. For more recipe ideas, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipes section</a>.</p>  

<h3>How to measure baking soda correctly</h3>  
<p>To measure 1 cup of baking soda accurately, use a dry measuring cup and level it off with a straight edge. Scooping directly from the container can lead to uneven amounts. For best results, fluff the baking soda first to avoid compacting it. This ensures you get the correct 8-ounce measurement every time.</p>  

<h2>Common baking soda conversions for air fryer recipes</h2>  
<p>Beyond 1 cup to ounces, here are other useful conversions for air fryer cooking. Half a cup of baking soda equals 4 ounces, while a quarter cup is 2 ounces. These measurements come in handy for smaller batches or adjusting recipes. For more tips, visit our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>cake recipes</a> section.</p>  

<p>If you're working with UK measurements, note that 1 UK cup is slightly larger than a US cup. However, for baking soda, the difference is minimal, and 8 ounces remains a reliable conversion. Always double-check your recipe’s origin to avoid confusion. Need cleaning tips for your air fryer?

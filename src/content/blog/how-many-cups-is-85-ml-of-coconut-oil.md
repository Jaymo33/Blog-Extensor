<p>85 ml of coconut oil equals approximately 0.36 cups. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes, where precise measurements can make or break your dish. Whether you're baking, frying, or roasting, knowing how to convert 85 ml of coconut oil to cups ensures consistency in your cooking. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we focus on making kitchen conversions effortless, so you can focus on creating delicious meals.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Frying</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of coconut oil in your air fryer recipes ensures even cooking and perfect texture. Too much oil can make food greasy, while too little may lead to dryness. Converting 85 ml of coconut oil to cups (0.36 cups) helps maintain balance, especially in recipes like crispy chicken or roasted vegetables. For more air fryer tips, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>  

<p>Air fryers rely on hot air circulation, so the right oil quantity enhances crispiness without excess fat. Whether you're making desserts or savoury dishes, 85 ml of coconut oil (0.36 cups) is a common measurement in many recipes. If you're new to air frying, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a> for inspiration.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure 85 ml of Coconut Oil Without a Scale</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a measuring jug, use a standard tablespoon to measure 85 ml of coconut oil. One tablespoon holds about 15 ml, so you’ll need roughly 5.5 tablespoons to reach 85 ml (or 0.36 cups). For sticky coconut oil, lightly grease the spoon for easy release. This method works well for recipes like air-fried cookies or cakes.</p>  

<h2>Converting 85 ml of Coconut Oil for Different Recipes</h2>  
<p>Whether you're baking or frying, 85 ml of coconut oil (0.36 cups) is a versatile measurement. For example, in air-fried desserts like brownies, this amount ensures moistness without overpowering flavour. If you're preparing savoury dishes, such as roasted potatoes, 85 ml of coconut oil provides just enough crispiness. Discover more ideas in our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert category</a>.</p>  

<p>Some recipes may list coconut oil in grams instead of ml. Since coconut oil’s density varies slightly with temperature, 85 ml typically weighs around 78 grams. Always check your recipe’s requirements, especially for precision baking.

<h3>Common Mistakes When Measuring Coconut Oil</h3>  
<p>Avoid packing coconut oil into the measuring cup, as this leads to excess. Instead, spoon it lightly for accuracy. Also, melted and solid coconut oil have different volumes—85 ml of melted oil may settle differently than solid oil. For consistent results, stick to the recipe’s specified state (melted or solid).</p>

<p>660 ml of oat milk is approximately 2.79 cups. This conversion is essential for accurate measurements in baking, cooking, and air fryer recipes. Whether you're whipping up a cake or preparing a creamy sauce, knowing how to convert millilitres to cups ensures consistent results every time.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Precision is key when working with oat milk, especially in air fryer recipes where texture and consistency are crucial. Too much or too little liquid can affect the outcome of your dish.

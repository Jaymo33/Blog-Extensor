<h2>Why Convert 75g of Olive Oil to Ounces?</h2>  
<p>Many UK recipes use grams, but some kitchen scales or international recipes might list ounces instead.

<p>Olive oil is a staple in air fryer cooking, used for everything from coating sweet potato wedges to keeping salmon fillets moist. Measuring 75g (or 2.65 oz) helps maintain consistency across recipes.

<h3>How to Measure 75g of Olive Oil Without Scales</h3>  
<p>No kitchen scales? No problem. One tablespoon of olive oil weighs roughly 14g, so 75g is about 5.3 tablespoons. For ounces, this translates to just under 3 fluid ounces.

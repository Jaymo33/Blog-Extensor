<p>2 tablespoons (tbsp) of cornflour weigh approximately 16 grams in the UK. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precision ensures crispy, even results. Whether you’re breading chicken or thickening a sauce, knowing the exact weight helps avoid kitchen mishaps. For more air fryer measurement tips, visit <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>our conversion chart</a>.</p>

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air frying</h2>  
<p>Using the correct amount of cornflour can make or break your air fryer dishes. Too little, and your coating won’t crisp up; too much, and it may turn powdery. For example, when making air-fried chicken, 16 grams (2 tbsp) of cornflour per serving creates the perfect golden crust. Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipes</a> for inspiration.</p>  

<p>Cornflour is also a key ingredient in gluten-free air fryer baking. If a recipe calls for 2 tbsp cornflour to grams, measuring by weight ensures consistency. Digital scales are more reliable than volume measurements, especially for UK cooks following international recipes. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a> for foolproof ideas.</p>  

<h3>How to measure 2 tbsp of cornflour without scales</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have scales, lightly spoon cornflour into a tablespoon and level it off with a knife. Avoid packing it down, as this can add up to 25% extra weight. For reference, 2 tbsp of cornflour equals 16 grams or roughly 1 UK metric cup when sifted. Need cleaning tips for sticky measurements?

<h2>Common uses for 2 tbsp cornflour in air fryers</h2>  
<p>This small but mighty quantity works wonders in air frying. Mix 16 grams (2 tbsp) of cornflour with spices for a crispy tofu coating, or blend it into batter for tempura vegetables. It’s also ideal for dusting frozen foods like chips before air frying to reduce sogginess. Discover more in our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/frozen-foods>frozen foods section</a>.</p>  

<p>Cornflour’s high starch content helps retain moisture in air-fried desserts. Two tablespoons (16g) can thicken fruit fillings for pies or create delicate crumb structures in cakes. For sweet inspiration, browse our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert recipes</a> featuring precise gram measurements.</p>  

<h3>Converting other cornflour quantities</h3>  
<p>Need to scale up? 1 UK tablespoon of cornflour equals 8 grams, while a US tablespoon is slightly less at 7.5 grams. For larger batches, remember that 100 grams of cornflour equals about 12.5 UK tablespoons. Always check recipe origins, as US and UK tablespoon volumes differ.</p>

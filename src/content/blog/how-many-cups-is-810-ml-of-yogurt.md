<h3>UK vs. US Cup Measurements</h3>  
<p>Did you know UK and US cups differ slightly? A UK cup holds 284 ml, while a US cup is 240 ml. For 810 ml of yogurt, that’s 3.42 UK cups or 3.38 US cups. This small variance might not matter for some recipes, but for baking, precision is non-negotiable. Always check which measurement your recipe uses!</p>  

<h2>How to Measure Yogurt Without a Scale</h2>  
<p>No measuring jug? No problem. Use a standard metric cup (250 ml) to estimate: 810 ml is roughly 3 and 1/4 metric cups. For thicker yogurts like Greek yogurt, spoon it into the cup and level it off for accuracy.

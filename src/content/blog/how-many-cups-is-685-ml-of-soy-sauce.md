<p>685 ml of soy sauce equals approximately 2.9 cups. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes, ensuring your dishes have the perfect balance of flavour. Whether you're marinating chicken or whipping up a stir-fry, knowing how to measure soy sauce accurately can make all the difference.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Soy Sauce Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of soy sauce ensures your air fryer dishes aren’t too salty or bland. A slight miscalculation can throw off the entire recipe, especially in marinades or sauces. For example, if you're preparing a <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>teriyaki chicken dish</a>, precise measurements guarantee the perfect glaze.</p>  
<p>Many air fryer recipes, like those found on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, rely on exact liquid ratios for even cooking. Too much soy sauce can lead to overly moist results, while too little might leave your dish lacking depth. This is why converting 685 ml of soy sauce to cups (2.9 cups) is so important.</p>  

<h2>How to Convert 685 ml of Soy Sauce to Cups</h2>  
<p>The standard conversion for liquids is 1 cup = 236.588 ml. Dividing 685 ml by this figure gives you roughly 2.9 cups. For air fryer cooking, this measurement is particularly useful when scaling recipes up or down. If you're working with a <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a>, you’ll find this ratio handy.</p>  
<p>Keep in mind that soy sauce’s viscosity can slightly affect measurements. For best results, use a liquid measuring cup rather than dry cups. This ensures you’re getting the exact 685 ml of soy sauce in cups (2.9 cups) needed for your dish.</p>  

<h3>Using 685 ml of Soy Sauce in Air Fryer Recipes</h3>  
<p>Many Asian-inspired air fryer dishes, like stir-fries or glazed salmon, call for soy sauce. For instance, a <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/salmon>salmon recipe</a> might require 685 ml of soy sauce (2.9 cups) as part of the marinade. Accurate measurements ensure the fish absorbs just the right amount of flavour.</p>  

<h3>Common Mistakes When Measuring Soy Sauce</h3>  
<p>One frequent error is using dry measuring cups for liquids like soy sauce. This can lead to inaccuracies since dry cups aren’t designed for precise liquid volumes. Always opt for a liquid measuring cup when converting 685 ml of soy sauce to cups.</p>  

<h2>Adjusting Recipes for Different Soy Sauce Brands</h2>  
<p>Not all soy sauces have the same saltiness or thickness. Light soy sauce is thinner and saltier, while dark soy sauce is thicker and sweeter. If your recipe calls for 685 ml of soy sauce in cups (2.9 cups), consider the brand’s consistency before measuring.</p>  
<p>For example, Kikkoman soy sauce might measure slightly differently than a generic brand. Always taste-test your marinades or sauces, especially when using an air fryer, as evaporation can concentrate flavours.

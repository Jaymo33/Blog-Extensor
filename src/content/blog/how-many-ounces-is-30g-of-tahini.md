<p>30 grams of tahini equals approximately 1.06 ounces. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements can make or break a dish. Whether you’re making a tahini-based sauce or incorporating it into a marinade, knowing the exact weight ensures consistency. For more air fryer conversions, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on precise ingredient ratios to achieve the perfect texture and flavour. Too much tahini can make a dish overly dense, while too little might leave it lacking richness. Measuring 30g of tahini correctly ensures your recipes turn out as intended. This is especially important for dishes like tahini-glazed vegetables or hummus, where balance is key. Visit <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> for more tips on perfecting your air fryer meals.</p>  

<p>Many UK recipes use grams, but if your kitchen scale measures in ounces, knowing the conversion is handy. A digital scale with both units can simplify the process, but a quick calculation works too. For tahini, 30g translates to just over 1 ounce, making it easy to adjust on the fly. Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a> for tahini-inspired air fryer dishes.</p>  

<h3>How to measure tahini without a scale</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a scale, you can estimate 30g of tahini using tablespoons. One tablespoon of tahini weighs roughly 15g, so two tablespoons will give you close to 30g. However, for accuracy, a scale is always best. This method works well for recipes where slight variations won’t affect the outcome. For precise measurements, consider investing in a kitchen scale.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for tahini in air fryer recipes</h2>  
<p>Tahini adds a rich, nutty flavour to many air fryer dishes. From marinades for chicken to dressings for roasted vegetables, it’s a versatile ingredient. Knowing how many ounces 30g of tahini is helps you follow recipes accurately. Try it in our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipes</a> for a delicious twist.</p>  

<p>Tahini also works beautifully in desserts, like air-fried halva or tahini cookies. The creamy texture and mild bitterness balance sweet flavours perfectly. Whether you’re cooking savoury or sweet, 30g of tahini (1.06 ounces) is a common measurement to master.

<h3>Storing tahini for optimal freshness</h3>  
<p>Tahini can separate over time, so always stir it well before measuring. Store it in a cool, dark place to maintain its quality. If you’re using 30g of tahini frequently, consider keeping it in the fridge to extend its shelf life. Proper storage ensures your tahini stays fresh for all your air fryer creations.</p>

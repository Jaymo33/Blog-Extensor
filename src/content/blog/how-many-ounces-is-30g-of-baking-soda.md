<p>30 grams (30g) of baking soda equals approximately 1.06 ounces (oz). This conversion is essential for precise measurements in air fryer recipes, ensuring your baked goods rise perfectly or your cleaning solutions work effectively. Whether you’re following a recipe from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> or adjusting measurements, knowing how to convert grams to ounces is a handy skill.</p>  

<h2>Why Convert 30g of Baking Soda to Ounces?</h2>  
<p>Many UK recipes, especially those for air fryers, use metric measurements like grams. However, some kitchen scales or older recipes might list ingredients in ounces. Converting 30g of baking soda to ounces ensures accuracy, whether you’re baking a cake or making a DIY air fryer cleaner. A slight mismeasurement could affect the texture or effectiveness of your recipe, so precision matters.</p>  

<p>Baking soda is a versatile ingredient, used in everything from fluffy cakes to cleaning solutions for your air fryer. If you’re using a recipe from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>our conversion chart</a>, knowing the exact ounce equivalent of 30g helps avoid guesswork. This is particularly useful for air fryer recipes, where precise measurements can make or break the dish.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure 30g of Baking Soda Accurately</h3>  
<p>To measure 30g of baking soda, use a digital kitchen scale for the most accurate results. If your scale displays ounces, it should read around 1.06 oz for 30g. Alternatively, you can use measuring spoons, though this method is less precise. One tablespoon of baking soda weighs roughly 15g, so two level tablespoons would give you approximately 30g (or 1.06 oz).</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for 30g of Baking Soda in Air Fryers</h2>  
<p>Baking soda isn’t just for baking—it’s a powerhouse for air fryer maintenance too. A 30g portion is perfect for creating a natural cleaning paste to remove grease and odours from your air fryer basket. Mix it with water, apply it to stubborn stains, and let it sit before wiping clean. This method is eco-friendly and avoids harsh chemicals.</p>  

<p>In cooking, 30g of baking soda can be used in air fryer recipes like soda bread or fluffy pancakes. If you’re exploring <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>cake recipes</a>, precise measurements ensure your treats rise evenly. Too much or too little baking soda can alter the taste and texture, so sticking to 30g (1.06 oz) is key for consistent results.</p>  

<h3>Converting Other Baking Soda Amounts</h3>  
<p>If your recipe calls for more or less than 30g, you can use the same conversion ratio: 1 gram equals roughly 0.035 ounces. For example, 15g of baking soda is about 0.53 oz, while 60g would be around 2.12 oz. Keeping a <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a> handy saves time and ensures accuracy across all your air fryer recipes.</p>  

<h2>Tips for Storing Baking Soda</h2>  
<p>To keep your baking soda fresh and effective, store it in an airtight container in a cool, dry place. Exposure to moisture or strong odours can reduce its potency, especially if you’re using it for both cooking and cleaning. A 30g portion is easy to measure out when stored properly, ensuring you always have the right amount on hand.</p>

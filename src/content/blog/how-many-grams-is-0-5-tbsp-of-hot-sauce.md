<h2>Why Convert Hot Sauce from Tablespoons to Grams?</h2>  
<p>Converting hot sauce from tablespoons to grams ensures accuracy, especially in air fryer cooking where small changes can affect texture and taste.

<h3>How to Measure 0.5 Tbsp of Hot Sauce Accurately</h3>  
<p>Use a measuring spoon for the most accurate 0.5 tbsp measurement. If you don’t have a half-tablespoon measure, fill a full tablespoon halfway or use a teaspoon (1.5 tsp equals 0.5 tbsp). For gram precision, a kitchen scale is ideal—simply tare the scale with your container and add hot sauce until it reaches 7.5 grams. This method is perfect for air fryer marinades or sauces where balance is key.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for 0.5 Tbsp of Hot Sauce in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Half a tablespoon of hot sauce adds just the right amount of heat to many air fryer dishes. Try it in a glaze for crispy chicken wings, a spicy rub for tofu, or a kick in roasted potatoes. The 7.5-gram measurement ensures consistency, so your dishes turn out perfectly every time.

<h3>Adjusting Hot Sauce Quantities for Personal Taste</h3>  
<p>While 0.5 tbsp (7.5 grams) is a standard starting point, feel free to adjust based on your heat preference. For milder dishes, reduce to 0.25 tbsp (3.75 grams), or double it for extra spice. Remember, air frying concentrates flavours, so a little goes a long way. Experiment with different hot sauce brands to find your perfect balance.</p>

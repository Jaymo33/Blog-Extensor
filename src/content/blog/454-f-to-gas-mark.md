<p>454 degrees Fahrenheit converts to Gas Mark 8 in UK ovens and air fryers. This high temperature is perfect for baking, roasting meats, or creating crispy textures in your air fryer. Many British recipes use Gas Mark rather than Fahrenheit, making this conversion essential for home cooks.</p>

<h2>Understanding 454 F to Gas Mark Conversion</h2>
<p>The Gas Mark scale is uniquely British, ranging from 1/4 to 9 for most domestic ovens. When converting 454 F to Gas Mark, you'll need to know that each Gas Mark represents about 25-30°C (45-54°F). At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we recommend using Gas Mark 8 for 454 F as it provides the closest match in heat intensity.</p>
<p>This temperature works exceptionally well in air fryers for creating crispy chicken wings, roasting vegetables, or baking small cakes. The rapid air circulation in air fryers means you might need to adjust cooking times slightly compared to conventional ovens.

<p>For best results at this temperature, preheat your air fryer for 3-5 minutes. The concentrated heat circulation means cooking times may be 20% faster than traditional oven methods.

<p>200 grams of rice equals approximately 1 cup in the US and 0.88 cups in the UK. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes, where precise measurements ensure even cooking. Whether you're meal prepping or whipping up a quick side dish, knowing how much rice to use makes all the difference.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Rice Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Cooking rice in an air fryer requires precision to avoid undercooked or mushy results. Unlike stovetop methods, air fryers circulate hot air, so incorrect measurements can lead to uneven cooking. For example, 200 grams of rice in cups may vary slightly depending on the type of rice—basmati, jasmine, or long-grain—but the standard conversion remains reliable.</p>  

<p>If you're using an air fryer for meal prep, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> for inspiration. Many dishes, like fried rice or rice-based casseroles, rely on accurate conversions to turn out perfectly. A slight miscalculation can throw off the texture and cooking time.</p>  

<h3>UK vs. US Cup Measurements</h3>  
<p>In the UK, a standard cup holds 250ml, while in the US, it's 240ml. This means 200 grams of rice equals roughly 0.88 UK cups or 1 US cup. If you're following a recipe from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, always check whether it uses UK or US measurements to avoid confusion.</p>  

<h2>Types of Rice and Their Conversions</h2>  
<p>Different rice varieties have varying densities, which can slightly affect the conversion. For instance, 200 grams of basmati rice may fluff up more than short-grain rice, but the cup measurement stays consistent for most cooking purposes. If you're unsure, weigh your rice for the most accurate results.</p>

These often include rice as a base, so knowing how many cups 200 grams equals ensures your portions are spot-on. Whether you're reheating or cooking from scratch, precise measurements save time and effort.</p>  

<h3>Using a Kitchen Scale for Precision</h3>  
<p>While cup measurements are convenient, a kitchen scale guarantees accuracy. If your air fryer recipe calls for 200 grams of rice, weighing it eliminates guesswork. This is especially helpful for baking or making rice-based desserts where consistency is key.</p>  

<h2>Common Mistakes When Measuring Rice</h2>  
<p>One of the biggest mistakes is packing rice into a cup, which leads to excess. Instead, lightly spoon the rice into the measuring cup and level it off. For 200 grams of rice in cups, this method ensures you don't end up with too much, which could affect cooking times in the air fryer.</p>  

<p>Another error is ignoring rice expansion. When cooked, rice nearly triples in volume, so 200 grams of uncooked rice yields about 3 cups cooked. Keep this in mind when portioning for meals.

<h3>Converting Other Rice Quantities</h3>  
<p>If you need to adjust servings, here's a quick reference: 100 grams of rice equals roughly 0.5 US cups, while 300 grams is about 1.5 cups. This flexibility is handy when scaling recipes for your air fryer, whether you're cooking for one or a family.</p>

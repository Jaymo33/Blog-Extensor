<p>164 C in a fan oven is equivalent to approximately 145 C in a conventional oven without the fan. This conversion is crucial when using air fryers, which work similarly to fan ovens. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we know precise temperatures make all the difference in cooking.</p>

<h2>Understanding Fan Oven Temperatures</h2>
<p>Fan ovens circulate hot air for even cooking, just like air fryers. When a recipe states 164 C for a fan oven, it means the temperature with the fan function engaged. This differs from traditional ovens where heat comes primarily from top and bottom elements. The fan setting typically requires lowering the temperature by 20 degrees compared to conventional baking.</p>
<p>Many modern air fryers operate on similar principles to fan ovens, making them excellent for quick, even cooking. If you're converting 164 C to fan oven settings for an air fryer, you might need to adjust cooking times slightly. Check our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for precise timing adjustments based on different foods.</p>

<h3>Why 164 C Matters in Cooking</h3>
<p>164 C is a popular temperature for delicate bakes and certain meat preparations. It's warm enough to cook thoroughly without risking burning or drying out. When converting 164 degrees C to fan oven settings, remember this temperature works particularly well for items like cheesecakes, custards, and some <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipes</a>.</p>

<h2>Converting 164 C for Different Appliances</h2>
<p>While 164 C in a fan oven translates to about 145 C conventional, air fryers may need further adjustment. Most air fryers cook faster than traditional ovens due to their compact size and powerful fans. When using 164 C in fan oven recipes with an air fryer, consider reducing the temperature by another 10-15 degrees or shortening cooking time by 20%.</p>
<p>For perfect results, always preheat your air fryer when using fan oven conversions. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a> includes specific air fryer adaptations for popular dishes originally designed for fan ovens. This takes the guesswork out of temperature conversions.</p>

<h3>Practical Tips for 164 C Cooking</h3>
<p>When working with 164 C in fan oven conversions, use an oven thermometer to verify your appliance's accuracy. Air fryers can sometimes run hotter than their displays indicate. For delicate items like the <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>cakes category</a>, consider using the lower end of the temperature range to prevent over-browning.</p>

<h2>Common Foods Cooked at 164 C</h2>
<p>Many baked goods and proteins work beautifully at 164 C in fan oven settings. This includes pound cakes, quiches, and some <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>roasted vegetables</a>. The moderate heat allows thorough cooking without excessive browning. When converting these recipes to air fryers, remember to check progress earlier than the original recipe suggests.</p>
<p>Cleaning your air fryer after cooking at 164 C is just as important as temperature accuracy. Visit our guide on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaning</a> to maintain your appliance's performance. Regular maintenance ensures consistent temperature delivery for all your fan oven conversions.</p>

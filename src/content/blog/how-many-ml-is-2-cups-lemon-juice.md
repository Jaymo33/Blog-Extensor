<p>2.0 cups of lemon juice equals 473 ml. Whether you're preparing a zesty marinade or a tangy dessert in your air fryer, getting the measurements right is crucial for perfect results. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we know how important accurate conversions are, especially when working with citrus-heavy recipes like lemon drizzle cake or lemon pepper chicken.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Lemon Juice Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Using the correct amount of lemon juice ensures your dish has the right balance of acidity and flavour. Too little, and your recipe might taste bland; too much, and it could become overpowering. For air fryer cooking, precise measurements help avoid soggy or unevenly cooked food. If you're following a recipe from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>our collection</a>, converting 2.0 cups of lemon juice to millilitres guarantees consistency.</p>  

<p>Lemon juice is often used in marinades, dressings, and desserts, where even small measurement errors can affect the outcome. For example, a lemon-infused salmon or a citrus-glazed chicken breast requires exact proportions to achieve the desired taste and texture. That’s why knowing that 2.0 cups of lemon juice equals 473 ml is so helpful.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure Lemon Juice Correctly</h3>  
<p>When measuring lemon juice, always use a liquid measuring cup for accuracy. Pour the juice to the 2.0-cup mark without tilting the cup. If you're using a kitchen scale, 473 ml of lemon juice weighs roughly 473 grams, as the density is close to water.

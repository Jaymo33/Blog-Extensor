<p>185 ml of half and half is approximately 0.78 cups. This conversion is essential for recipes requiring precise measurements, especially when using an air fryer for baking or cooking creamy dishes. Whether you're whipping up a dessert or a savoury sauce, knowing how to convert millilitres to cups ensures perfect results every time.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Precision is key when cooking or baking, particularly with air fryers where ingredient ratios affect texture and cooking times. Using the correct amount of half and half—whether 185 ml or its cup equivalent—ensures your dishes turn out creamy and well-balanced. For more air fryer measurement tips, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>  

<p>Many air fryer recipes, like custards or creamy pasta bakes, rely on dairy for richness. A slight miscalculation could lead to overly thick or runny results. That’s why converting 185 ml of half and half to cups (0.78 cups) helps maintain consistency. Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> for inspiration on using half and half perfectly.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure 185 ml of Half And Half Without a Scale</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a measuring jug, use standard cup measurements: 185 ml is just under 4/5 of a cup. For smaller increments, a tablespoon holds about 15 ml, so 12 tablespoons plus 1 teaspoon will get you close. This method works well for air fryer recipes like creamy dips or <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>desserts</a>.</p>  

<h2>US vs. UK Cup Measurements</h2>  
<p>Note that US and UK cup sizes differ slightly—a US cup is 240 ml, while a UK cup is 250 ml. For 185 ml of half and half, the US conversion is 0.78 cups, and the UK conversion is 0.74 cups. This small variance rarely affects air fryer recipes, but for precision baking, stick to one measurement system. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning guide</a> also ensures your tools stay accurate.</p>  

<p>When adapting recipes from international sources, always confirm whether they use US or UK measurements. For example, a British recipe calling for 185 ml of half and half translates to roughly 0.74 UK cups. Meanwhile, American recipes will list it as 0.78 cups.

<h3>Common Recipes Using 185 ml of Half And Half</h3>  
<p>This measurement often appears in creamy sauces, custards, or mashed potatoes. Try it in air-fryer scalloped potatoes or a rich <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/breakfast>breakfast casserole</a>. The 185 ml (0.78 cups) quantity balances richness without overpowering other flavours.</p>

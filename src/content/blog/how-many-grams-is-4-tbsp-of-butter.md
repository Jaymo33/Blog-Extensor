Butter can be packed differently in tablespoons, and its density changes with temperature. Grams ensure consistency, especially important in baking where precise ratios affect the final texture.

<p>4 tablespoons (tbsp) of butter equals approximately 56 grams (g). This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes, where precise measurements can make all the difference. Whether you're baking or frying, knowing the exact weight ensures consistent results every time.</p>

<h2>Why accurate butter measurements matter</h2>
<p>Using the correct amount of butter is crucial for achieving the perfect texture and flavour in your dishes. Too much butter can make your food greasy, while too little might leave it dry. For air fryer recipes, precision is key to avoid uneven cooking or excess smoke.</p>
<p>At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we recommend weighing ingredients like butter for the best results. Many of our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> specify weights rather than volume measurements for this reason. A kitchen scale is a small investment that pays off in perfectly cooked meals.</p>

<h2>Converting 4 tbsp butter to grams</h2>
<p>The standard conversion for butter is 1 tablespoon = 14 grams. Therefore, 4 tablespoons of butter equals 56 grams. This measurement applies to both salted and unsalted butter varieties. Remember that butter density can vary slightly depending on temperature, so room-temperature butter will measure differently than cold butter.</p>
<p>If you're working with melted butter, the volume changes but the weight remains the same. This is why weight measurements are more reliable than volume for baking. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> includes all these essential measurements for quick reference.</p>

<h3>Measuring butter without scales</h3>
<p>If you don't have kitchen scales, you can still measure 4 tbsp of butter accurately. Most butter packaging has markings showing tablespoon measurements. A standard UK block of butter is 250g, divided into 10 tablespoons (25g each), but the US standard is different at 14g per tablespoon.</p>

<h2>Using butter in air fryer recipes</h2>
<p>Butter adds wonderful flavour to air fried dishes, from vegetables to meats. When using butter in your air fryer, it's best to brush or spray it lightly rather than adding large chunks. This prevents excessive smoke and ensures even distribution. For <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/potatoes>air fryer potato recipes</a>, a little butter can create beautifully crispy results.</p>
<p>Remember that butter has a low smoke point (around 150Â°C), so avoid using it at very high air fryer temperatures. For high-heat cooking, consider alternatives like olive oil. After cooking, don't forget to <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>clean your air fryer</a> properly to remove any butter residue.</p>

<h3>Butter alternatives in air frying</h3>
<p>If you're looking for healthier options, you can substitute butter with olive oil (1 tbsp = 13.5g) or coconut oil (1 tbsp = 13.6g). These alternatives work well in most air fryer recipes and can withstand higher temperatures. For baking recipes that specifically require butter, the 4 tbsp (56g) measurement remains crucial for texture.</p>

<h2>Common butter measurement conversions</h2>
<p>Here are some additional butter conversions that might be helpful:</p>
<ul>
<li>1 tablespoon butter = 14 grams</li>
<li>1/4 cup butter = 56 grams (4 tablespoons)</li>
<li>1/2 cup butter = 113 grams</li>
<li>1 cup butter = 227 grams</li>
</ul>
<p>These measurements are particularly useful when adapting traditional oven recipes for your air fryer. Many <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>air fryer dessert recipes</a> rely on precise butter measurements for success.</p>

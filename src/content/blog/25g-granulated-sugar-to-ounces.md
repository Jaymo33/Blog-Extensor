<p>25g of granulated sugar equals approximately 0.88 ounces. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements can make or break your dish. Whether you’re baking a cake or whipping up a dessert, knowing how to convert grams to ounces ensures consistency and perfect results every time.</p>

<h2>Why Convert 25g of Granulated Sugar to Ounces?</h2>  
<p>Many UK recipes, especially those for air fryers, use grams for measurements, while some older cookbooks or international recipes might list ingredients in ounces. Converting 25g of granulated sugar to ounces (0.88 oz) helps you follow recipes accurately without guesswork. This is particularly important for baking, where even small measurement errors can affect texture and taste.</p>  

<p>If you’re using an air fryer for desserts like cookies or cakes, precise sugar measurements ensure the right sweetness and browning. For more air fryer recipe ideas, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipes section</a>.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure 25g of Granulated Sugar</h3>  
<p>To measure 25g of granulated sugar, use a digital kitchen scale for the most accurate results. If you don’t have one, a standard UK tablespoon holds about 12.5g of granulated sugar, so two level tablespoons will give you roughly 25g. Remember, packed or heaped tablespoons can vary, so a scale is always best.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for 25g of Granulated Sugar in Air Fryer Recipes</h2>  
<p>25g of granulated sugar is a common measurement in small-batch air fryer desserts. For example, it’s perfect for a single-serving mug cake or a small batch of cookies. You’ll also find this amount in glazes or syrups for air-fried fruits like apples or pears.</p>

<h3>Converting Other Sugar Amounts</h3>  
<p>Need to convert other sugar measurements? Here’s a quick reference: 50g = 1.76 oz, 100g = 3.53 oz. For a full <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a>, visit our site.</p>  

<h2>Tips for Measuring Sugar in Your Air Fryer Recipes</h2>  
<p>Always use a dry measuring cup or scale for granulated sugar, as volume measurements can vary. If your recipe calls for caster sugar instead, note that it’s finer, so 25g will take up slightly less space. For more air fryer tips, browse our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>homepage</a>.</p>  

<p>Storing sugar in an airtight container keeps it fresh and clump-free, ensuring consistent measurements. And if you’re adapting a traditional recipe for the air fryer, reducing sugar by 10% can prevent over-browning.</p>

<p>235 ml of maple syrup is approximately 1 cup. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes, where precise measurements ensure perfect results every time. Whether you’re drizzling it over air-fried pancakes or using it in a glaze, knowing how to convert ml to cups is a game-changer. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we help you nail every measurement for flawless cooking.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of maple syrup can make or break your dish. Too much, and your food might become overly sweet or sticky; too little, and you’ll miss out on flavour. The air fryer’s intense heat means ingredients like maple syrup caramelise quickly, so precision is key. For more air fryer tips, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a> to simplify your cooking process.</p>  

<p>Maple syrup is a staple in many recipes, from glazes for air-fried chicken to desserts like air-fryer cakes. Knowing that 235 ml equals roughly 1 cup helps streamline your prep work. If you’re experimenting with new dishes, browse our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a> for inspiration.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure 235 ml of Maple Syrup Without a Measuring Cup</h3>  
<p>Don’t have a measuring cup? No problem. A standard UK mug holds about 250 ml, so filling it just below the rim will give you close to 235 ml. Alternatively, use tablespoons—16 tablespoons equal roughly 240 ml, so 15 tablespoons will get you near the 235 ml mark. For more handy measurement hacks, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning and usage guides</a>.</p>  

<h2>Converting 235 ml of Maple Syrup for Different Recipes</h2>  
<p>Whether you’re making air-fryer desserts or savoury dishes, 235 ml of maple syrup (or 1 cup) is a versatile measurement. For example, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>air-fryer cake recipes</a> often call for this amount to achieve the perfect sweetness. Remember, thicker syrups may settle differently, so always level off your measuring cup for accuracy.</p>  

<p>If you’re adapting a recipe from grams to cups, keep in mind that maple syrup’s density means 235 ml weighs around 312 grams. This is useful for baking, where weight measurements are often more reliable. For more conversions, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>chart</a> has you covered.</p>  

<h3>Common Mistakes When Measuring Maple Syrup</h3>  
<p>One mistake is not accounting for the syrup’s stickiness, which can leave residue in your measuring cup and throw off the amount. To avoid this, lightly grease the cup with oil before pouring. Another error is using a liquid measuring cup for thick syrups—opt for a dry measuring cup instead for better precision.</p>

<p>375 grams of brown sugar is roughly equivalent to 1.8 cups when lightly packed. This conversion is essential for baking, especially when using an air fryer for desserts like cookies or cakes. Getting the measurement right ensures your recipes turn out perfectly every time.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Baking is a science, and even small deviations in measurements can affect the texture and taste of your treats. Brown sugar, in particular, can vary in density depending on how it’s packed. Too much sugar can make your air fryer desserts overly sweet or dense, while too little might leave them dry. For consistent results, always measure carefully.</p>  

<p>If you’re using an air fryer, precise measurements are even more critical due to the appliance’s rapid cooking method. A slight imbalance in ingredients can lead to uneven baking.

<h3>How to Measure Brown Sugar Correctly</h3>  
<p>For the most accurate conversion of 375 grams of brown sugar to cups, lightly spoon the sugar into your measuring cup and level it off. Avoid packing it down tightly, as this can lead to an excess amount. If your recipe calls for firmly packed brown sugar, adjust accordingly by pressing it slightly into the cup.</p>  

<h2>Converting Grams to Cups for Different Sugars</h2>  
<p>Not all sugars weigh the same, so conversions vary. Granulated white sugar, for example, is denser than brown sugar. If you’re substituting one for the other, you’ll need to adjust your measurements. For 375 grams of brown sugar, stick to the 1.8-cup guideline unless your recipe specifies otherwise.</p>

<h3>Common Mistakes When Measuring Brown Sugar</h3>  
<p>One of the biggest mistakes is scooping sugar directly from the bag with the measuring cup, which compacts it and leads to excess. Another is using a liquid measuring cup instead of dry measuring cups, which can throw off your measurements. Always use the right tools for accuracy.</p>  

<h2>Using Brown Sugar in Air Fryer Recipes</h2>  
<p>Brown sugar adds moisture and depth to air fryer desserts like cookies, cakes, and even glazes for meats. Because air fryers cook faster than conventional ovens, the sugar caramelises quickly, enhancing flavour. Just ensure you’ve measured correctly to avoid over- or under-sweetening.</p>

<h3>Storing Brown Sugar for Freshness</h3>  
<p>To keep your brown sugar soft and ready for baking, store it in an airtight container. If it hardens, place a slice of bread or a damp paper towel in the container overnight to restore moisture. Proper storage ensures your 375 grams of brown sugar measures accurately every time.</p>

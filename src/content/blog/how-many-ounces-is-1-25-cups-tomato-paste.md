<p>1.25 cups of tomato paste equals approximately 10 ounces. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements can make or break your dish. Whether you're making a rich pasta sauce or a flavourful marinade, knowing this measurement ensures consistency. For more air fryer conversions, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on even cooking, and incorrect ingredient quantities can throw off textures and flavours. Tomato paste, being highly concentrated, needs precise measurement to avoid overpowering your dish. Too much can make sauces bitter, while too little might leave them lacking depth. If you're prepping a <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipe</a>, this balance is especially crucial.</p>  

<p>Using a kitchen scale is the most reliable method, but if you don’t have one, our cup-to-ounce conversion saves the day. For more recipe ideas, explore our collection at <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>.</p>  

<h3>How to measure tomato paste without a scale</h3>  
<p>If you're working without a scale, spoon the tomato paste into a measuring cup and level it off with a knife. Remember, 1.25 cups is equivalent to 10 fluid ounces or about 283 grams. For sticky ingredients like tomato paste, lightly greasing the measuring cup can help it slide out easily.</p>  

<h2>Common recipes using 1.25 cups of tomato paste</h2>  
<p>Many air fryer dishes, like meatballs or stuffed peppers, call for this quantity of tomato paste. It’s also a base for homemade BBQ sauces or <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable marinades</a>. The concentrated flavour works wonders in small batches, making it ideal for air fryer portions.</p>  

<p>If you’re meal prepping, consider freezing leftover tomato paste in tablespoon portions. This way, you’ll always have the right amount on hand. For cleaning tips after cooking, visit our guide on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer maintenance</a>.</p>  

<h3>Adjusting recipes for UK measurements</h3>  
<p>In the UK, recipes often use grams or millilitres instead of cups. 1.25 cups of tomato paste translates to roughly 283 grams or 300ml. Always check whether your recipe uses US or UK measurements to avoid confusion.</p>  

<h2>Tomato paste substitutes in a pinch</h2>  
<p>If you’re out of tomato paste, mix 1.25 cups of tomato sauce with 2 tablespoons of cornstarch to thicken it. Alternatively, blend sun-dried tomatoes with a bit of water for a rich, concentrated substitute. Neither will be exact, but they’ll work in most <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/beef>beef or lamb dishes</a>.</p>  

<p>Remember, substitutions may alter cooking times slightly in your air fryer. Keep an eye on your dish to prevent over or undercooking. For more troubleshooting tips, browse <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>.</p>

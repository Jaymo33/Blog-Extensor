<p>108 fan oven converts to approximately 120°C in a conventional oven. This conversion is essential for adapting recipes between fan-assisted and traditional ovens, especially when using an air fryer which typically follows fan oven principles. Understanding this temperature adjustment ensures your dishes cook perfectly every time.</p>

<h2>Understanding Fan Oven vs Conventional Oven Temperatures</h2>
<p>Fan ovens circulate hot air around the food, cooking it more evenly and quickly than conventional ovens. When a recipe calls for 108 fan oven, it means 108°C with the fan function engaged. The equivalent conventional oven temperature needs to be slightly higher to achieve similar results. This difference is crucial when converting recipes for your air fryer, as most models operate similarly to fan ovens.</p>
<p>For those using <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion charts</a>, you'll notice fan oven temperatures typically require a 20°C reduction from conventional oven settings. This principle works in reverse when converting from fan to conventional - you'll need to add about 12°C to the fan oven temperature to get the conventional equivalent. Our 108 fan oven to conventional oven conversion follows this standard adjustment.</p>

<h2>How This Conversion Affects Air Fryer Cooking</h2>
<p>Most air fryers function similarly to fan ovens, using rapid air technology to circulate heat. When you see a recipe with 108 fan oven settings, you can typically use the same temperature in your air fryer. However, if you're adapting a conventional oven recipe for your air fryer, you'll need to reduce the temperature by about 20°C, which is where our conversion knowledge becomes invaluable.</p>
<p>This temperature adjustment becomes particularly important for delicate items like cakes or pastries. A <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>cake recipe</a> calling for 108 fan oven would need about 120°C in a conventional oven, but could use the original 108°C in an air fryer. Understanding these conversions helps prevent overcooking or undercooking your favourite dishes.</p>

<h3>Practical Applications of 108 Fan Oven Conversion</h3>
<p>The 108 fan oven to conventional oven conversion is especially useful for slow-cooked dishes. Many recipes for tender meats or dehydrated fruits use lower temperatures like 108°C fan. When converting these to conventional oven settings, the slight temperature increase ensures proper cooking without drying out your food.</p>

<h2>Common Mistakes in Temperature Conversion</h2>
<p>One frequent error is assuming fan and conventional oven temperatures are identical. This misconception can lead to undercooked food when converting from conventional to fan settings, or overcooked dishes when going from fan to conventional. Another mistake is not accounting for the faster cooking times in fan ovens and air fryers, even after temperature conversion.</p>
<p>For perfect results every time, consider using an oven thermometer to verify your appliance's accuracy. This is particularly helpful when preparing <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/frozen-foods>frozen foods</a> that require precise temperatures. Remember, the 108 fan oven to conventional oven conversion is just one part of successful recipe adaptation - timing adjustments may also be necessary.</p>

<h3>Special Considerations for Air Fryer Users</h3>
<p>Air fryer owners should note that while temperature conversions between fan and conventional ovens are straightforward, air fryers often cook even faster than fan ovens. When using 108 fan oven settings in your air fryer, you might need to reduce cooking time by 10-20% compared to the original recipe's suggested duration.</p>

<h2>Converting Other Common Fan Oven Temperatures</h2>
<p>While we've focused on 108 fan oven to conventional oven conversion, it's helpful to understand the general pattern. For every fan oven temperature, add approximately 12°C to get the conventional oven equivalent. This rule of thumb works well for most cooking scenarios, from roasting vegetables to baking <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken dishes</a>.</p>
<p>Keeping a conversion chart handy, like those available at <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, can simplify your cooking process. Whether you're using a conventional oven, fan oven, or air fryer, understanding these temperature relationships ensures consistent results across all your kitchen appliances.</p>

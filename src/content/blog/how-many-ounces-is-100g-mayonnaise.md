<p>100 grams of mayonnaise equals approximately 3.53 ounces. If you're preparing a recipe in your air fryer and need to convert 100g of mayonnaise to ounces, this simple conversion ensures your measurements are spot on. Whether you're making a creamy dip, a rich sauce, or a marinade, knowing this conversion helps avoid kitchen mishaps.

<h2>Why Convert 100g of Mayonnaise to Ounces?</h2>  
<p>Many air fryer recipes, especially those from the UK or US, use different measurement systems. While grams are common in the UK, ounces are often used in American recipes. Converting 100g of mayonnaise to ounces (3.53 oz) ensures you follow recipes accurately, whether you're making aioli, coleslaw, or a crispy coating. This small but crucial step can make a big difference in texture and flavour.</p>  
<p>If you're using a digital scale, switching between grams and ounces is straightforward. However, if you're relying on measuring spoons or cups, knowing that 100g of mayonnaise is roughly 3.5 ounces helps you portion correctly.

<h2>How to Measure 100g of Mayonnaise Without a Scale</h2>  
<p>Don't have a kitchen scale? No problem! You can still measure 100g of mayonnaise using tablespoons or cups. One tablespoon of mayonnaise weighs about 14g, so 100g is roughly 7 tablespoons. Alternatively, 100g is just under half a standard UK cup (250ml). Keep in mind that mayonnaise's thickness can vary, so these are approximate measures.</p>  
<p>For air fryer recipes where precision matters, like coatings or batters, we recommend using a scale for the best results. If you're experimenting with recipes, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a> offers plenty of inspiration with clear measurements.</p>  

<h3>Does Mayonnaise Brand Affect Weight?</h3>  
<p>Different brands of mayonnaise can have slight variations in density due to ingredients like oil content or added thickeners. However, the difference is minimal—100g of any mayonnaise will still be close to 3.5 ounces. For air fryer cooking, this small variance won’t significantly impact most recipes.</p>  

<h3>Using 100g of Mayonnaise in Air Fryer Recipes</h3>  
<p>Mayonnaise is a versatile ingredient in air fryer cooking. From crispy chicken coatings to moist salmon fillets, 100g (3.5 oz) can go a long way. Try mixing it with breadcrumbs for a golden crust or blending it into marinades for extra richness.

<h2>Common Mistakes When Measuring Mayonnaise</h2>  
<p>One mistake is scooping mayonnaise straight from the jar with a measuring spoon, which can trap air and lead to inaccurate measurements. Instead, use a spatula to level it off. Also, avoid packing mayonnaise down, as this can make your measurement heavier than needed. For sticky ingredients like mayonnaise, a scale is your best friend.</p>  
<p>Another tip? Always check if your recipe lists measurements by weight or volume. If you're adapting a recipe from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we provide both for convenience.</p>

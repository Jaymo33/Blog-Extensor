<p>200g of caster sugar is approximately 7.05 ounces. This conversion is essential for anyone using an air fryer to bake, as precise measurements can make or break your recipe. Whether you’re making cakes, cookies, or other sweet treats, knowing how many ounces are in 200g of caster sugar ensures consistency and delicious results. For more handy conversions, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>

<h2>Why accurate sugar measurements matter</h2>  
<p>Using the correct amount of caster sugar is crucial for achieving the right texture and sweetness in your air fryer bakes. Too much sugar can make desserts overly sweet or cause them to brown too quickly, while too little can result in a bland taste. Whether you’re following a recipe from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> or experimenting with your own creations, precision is key. Converting 200g of caster sugar to ounces (7.05 oz) helps you stay on track.</p>  

<p>Many UK bakers prefer using grams, but some older recipes or international guides might list ingredients in ounces. Knowing how to switch between the two ensures you never miss a beat. For example, if you’re making a classic sponge cake in your air fryer, 200g (7.05 oz) of caster sugar will give you the perfect crumb. Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>cake recipes</a> for more inspiration.</p>  

<h3>How to measure 200g of caster sugar without scales</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a kitchen scale, you can still measure 200g of caster sugar using measuring cups. One cup of caster sugar typically weighs around 200g, but this can vary slightly depending on how tightly packed it is. For the most accurate results, we recommend investing in a digital scale—especially if you bake often in your air fryer. A small discrepancy in sugar weight can affect the outcome of delicate desserts like meringues or soufflés.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for 200g of caster sugar in air fryer recipes</h2>  
<p>200g of caster sugar is a common measurement in many air fryer-friendly desserts. From classic Victoria sponges to gooey chocolate brownies, this amount provides the ideal sweetness. If you’re making cookies, 200g of caster sugar will yield a crisp yet chewy texture. For lighter bakes like angel food cake, you might need to adjust slightly, but 7.05 ounces (200g) is a great starting point.</p>  

<p>Looking for savoury dishes? Even some glazed meats or roasted vegetables benefit from a touch of sugar. A sprinkle of caster sugar can balance the flavours in dishes like honey-glazed carrots or teriyaki chicken. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipes</a> for ideas on how to incorporate sugar into savoury air fryer meals.</p>  

<h3>Storing caster sugar for air fryer baking</h3>  
<p>To keep your caster sugar fresh and ready for air fryer recipes, store it in an airtight container in a cool, dry place. Humidity can cause sugar to clump, making it harder to measure accurately. If your sugar has hardened, a quick blitz in the food processor or a few seconds in the microwave can restore its fine texture. Proper storage ensures your 200g (7.05 oz) measurements remain consistent every time you bake.</p>  

<h2>Converting other sugar weights for air fryer recipes</h2>  
<p>While 200g of caster sugar equals 7.05 ounces, other sugar weights follow similar conversions. For example, 100g is roughly 3.5 ounces, and 300g is about 10.6 ounces. Keeping a conversion chart handy, like the one on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, simplifies baking in your air fryer. Whether you’re scaling a recipe up or down, knowing these conversions ensures success.</p>  

<p>Different types of sugar, like granulated or icing sugar, have slightly different weights per cup, so always check the specifics.

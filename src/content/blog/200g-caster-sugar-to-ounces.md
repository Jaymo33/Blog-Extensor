<h2>Why accurate sugar measurements matter</h2>  
<p>Using the correct amount of caster sugar is crucial for achieving the right texture and sweetness in your air fryer bakes. Too much sugar can make desserts overly sweet or cause them to brown too quickly, while too little can result in a bland taste. Whether you’re following a recipe from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> or experimenting with your own creations, precision is key. Converting 200g of caster sugar to ounces (7.05 oz) helps you stay on track.</p>  

<p>Many UK bakers prefer using grams, but some older recipes or international guides might list ingredients in ounces. Knowing how to switch between the two ensures you never miss a beat. For example, if you’re making a classic sponge cake in your air fryer, 200g (7.05 oz) of caster sugar will give you the perfect crumb.

<h3>How to measure 200g of caster sugar without scales</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a kitchen scale, you can still measure 200g of caster sugar using measuring cups. One cup of caster sugar typically weighs around 200g, but this can vary slightly depending on how tightly packed it is. For the most accurate results, we recommend investing in a digital scale—especially if you bake often in your air fryer. A small discrepancy in sugar weight can affect the outcome of delicate desserts like meringues or soufflés.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for 200g of caster sugar in air fryer recipes</h2>

For lighter bakes like angel food cake, you might need to adjust slightly, but 7.05 ounces (200g) is a great starting point.</p>

<h3>Storing caster sugar for air fryer baking</h3>  
<p>To keep your caster sugar fresh and ready for air fryer recipes, store it in an airtight container in a cool, dry place. Humidity can cause sugar to clump, making it harder to measure accurately. If your sugar has hardened, a quick blitz in the food processor or a few seconds in the microwave can restore its fine texture. Proper storage ensures your 200g (7.05 oz) measurements remain consistent every time you bake.</p>

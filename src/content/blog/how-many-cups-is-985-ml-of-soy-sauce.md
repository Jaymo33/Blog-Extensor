Whether you're whipping up a marinade or a stir-fry, knowing how to convert ml to cups ensures your recipe turns out perfectly every time. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we’re all about making your cooking experience hassle-free.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>
<p>Air fryers rely on precise ingredient ratios to achieve the perfect texture and flavour. Too much or too little soy sauce can throw off the balance of your dish. For example, a marinade with 985 ml of soy sauce needs the right cup measurement to avoid over-salting. This is particularly important for recipes like teriyaki chicken or glazed salmon, where soy sauce is a key ingredient. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more handy tips.</p>

<h2>How to Measure 985 ml of Soy Sauce Without a Measuring Cup</h2>
<p>Don’t have a measuring cup? No problem. You can still measure 985 ml of soy sauce using common household items. A standard mug holds about 240 ml, so 985 ml is roughly 4 mugs plus a splash. Alternatively, use a tablespoon—15 ml per tablespoon means 985 ml is around 65 tablespoons. While these methods aren’t as precise, they’ll work in a pinch.</p>
<p>For best results, invest in a good set of measuring tools. A liquid measuring jug with ml and cup markings is ideal for recipes calling for 985 ml of soy sauce. This is especially useful for baking, where precision is key.

Always double-check your conversions, especially for 985 ml of soy sauce, to avoid these pitfalls.</p>

<h2>Tips for Storing Leftover Soy Sauce</h2>

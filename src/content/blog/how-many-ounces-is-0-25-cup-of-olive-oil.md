<h2>Why accurate olive oil measurements matter</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of olive oil in your air fryer ensures even cooking and prevents soggy or dry results. Too much oil can lead to excess smoke, while too little may leave food sticking to the basket. Many <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> rely on precise oil measurements for optimal texture and flavour. For example, roasted potatoes need just enough oil to crisp up without becoming greasy. Measuring 0.25 cup of olive oil correctly (2 ounces) helps achieve that balance.</p>  

<h3>How to measure 0.25 cup of olive oil</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a measuring cup, you can use a kitchen scale to weigh out 2 ounces of olive oil. Alternatively, a standard tablespoon holds 0.5 ounces, so four tablespoons equal 0.25 cup. This method is handy for smaller quantities in air fryer cooking. For more tips on measuring ingredients, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable recipes</a> section, where precise oil measurements are key.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for 0.25 cup of olive oil in air fryers</h2>  
<p>This amount is perfect for coating vegetables, marinating chicken, or greasing the air fryer basket. For crispy <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/potatoes>potato recipes</a>, 0.25 cup of olive oil (2 ounces) ensures even browning. It’s also ideal for drizzling over fish or tofu before air frying. If you’re meal prepping, this measurement helps portion oils accurately. Always clean your air fryer afterward with our recommended <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning guide</a> to maintain performance.</p>  

<h3>Converting other olive oil measurements</h3>

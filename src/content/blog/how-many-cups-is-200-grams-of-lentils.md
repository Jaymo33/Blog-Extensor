<p>200 grams of lentils is roughly equivalent to 1 cup, but this can vary slightly depending on the type and how they’re packed. If you’re using an air fryer for recipes like crispy lentil snacks or lentil patties, precise measurements ensure consistent results. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we know how important accurate conversions are for perfect cooking every time.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Lentil Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Getting the right amount of lentils ensures your air fryer recipes turn out just as intended. Too many lentils can overcrowd the basket, leading to uneven cooking, while too few might leave your dish dry or undercooked. Whether you’re making lentil falafels or a hearty lentil stew in your air fryer, 200 grams is a common measurement worth mastering. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more handy measurement tips.</p>  

<p>Different types of lentils, such as red, green, or brown, may have slight variations in volume. For example, split red lentils might settle more densely in a cup compared to whole green lentils. If precision is key, weighing your lentils with a kitchen scale is the best method. However, if you’re in a pinch, using the 200 grams to cups conversion will get you close enough for most recipes.</p>  

<h3>Types of Lentils and Their Measurements</h3>  
<p>Not all lentils are created equal when it comes to cup measurements. Whole lentils like green or brown take up more space, while split lentils like red or yellow pack more densely. For 200 grams of whole lentils, you’ll typically need just under 1 cup, whereas split lentils might fit neatly into a single cup. If you’re experimenting with air fryer recipes, knowing these differences can save you from under or over-measuring.</p>  

<h2>Converting 200 Grams of Lentils to Cups</h2>  
<p>To convert 200 grams of lentils to cups, start by fluffing them lightly with a fork to prevent compacting. Spoon the lentils into a measuring cup and level off the top for the most accurate result. Remember, 200 grams is approximately 1 cup, but slight variations are normal. For air fryer cooking, consistency is key, so consider investing in a digital scale for foolproof measurements every time.</p>  

<p>If you’re working with a recipe from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>our collection</a>, you’ll often find both weight and volume measurements provided. This makes it easier to follow along whether you prefer using grams or cups. For baking or crispy snacks, sticking to weight measurements (like 200 grams) ensures the best texture and flavour.</p>  

<h3>Tips for Measuring Lentils in an Air Fryer Recipe</h3>  
<p>When using lentils in air fryer recipes, avoid overpacking the cup to prevent uneven cooking. Lightly spoon them in and level the top for the most accurate measurement. If your recipe calls for soaked lentils, note that they’ll expand, so adjust your measurements accordingly.

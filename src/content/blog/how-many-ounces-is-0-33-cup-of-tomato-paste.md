<p>0.33 cup of tomato paste equals approximately 2.64 ounces (oz). This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes, where precise measurements can make or break a dish. Whether you're making a rich pasta sauce or a flavourful marinade, knowing how many ounces are in 0.33 cup of tomato paste ensures consistency. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we focus on helping you get the measurements right for perfect results every time.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on even cooking, and incorrect measurements can lead to dry or overly dense dishes. Tomato paste, being a concentrated ingredient, needs precise measuring to avoid overpowering flavours. For example, if you're making a <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken dish</a>, too much tomato paste can make it overly tangy, while too little might leave it bland. Using 0.33 cup of tomato paste (2.64 oz) ensures balance.</p>  

<p>Many air fryer recipes call for small quantities like 0.33 cup of tomato paste, so knowing the ounce equivalent is handy. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> can help with other common measurements too. Whether you're scaling a recipe up or down, accurate conversions keep your cooking on track.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure 0.33 Cup of Tomato Paste</h3>  
<p>Measuring sticky ingredients like tomato paste can be tricky. To get exactly 0.33 cup (2.64 oz), use a liquid measuring cup or a kitchen scale for precision. If you don’t have a scale, spoon the paste into a measuring cup and level it off with a knife. This method ensures you’re not adding extra, which could throw off your recipe.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for 0.33 Cup of Tomato Paste in Air Fryer Recipes</h2>  
<p>Tomato paste is a versatile ingredient that adds depth to many air fryer dishes. From <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>roasted vegetables</a> to meat marinades, 0.33 cup (2.64 oz) is often the perfect amount. It’s also great for making quick sauces or glazes, like a tangy BBQ coating for wings or ribs.</p>  

<p>If you're prepping meals in advance, knowing how many ounces are in 0.33 cup of tomato paste helps with portion control.

<h3>Tips for Storing Leftover Tomato Paste</h3>

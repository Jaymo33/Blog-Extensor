At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we provide precise conversions to make cooking effortless.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Lentil Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Getting the right amount of lentils ensures your dish has the perfect texture and flavour. Too many lentils can make a recipe dry, while too few might leave it lacking substance. For air fryer recipes, precise measurements help achieve even cooking. If you're using 75 grams of lentils, knowing the cup equivalent prevents guesswork. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more handy measurements.</p>

For more recipe ideas, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable category</a> for inspiration.</p>  

<h3>UK vs. US Cup Measurements</h3>  
<p>In the UK, a standard cup holds 250ml, while in the US, it's 240ml. This slight difference means 75 grams of lentils equals 0.38 cups in the UK and 0.45 cups in the US. If you're following a recipe from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>our collection</a>, always check which measurement system it uses.</p>  

<h2>How to Measure 75 Grams of Lentils Without Scales</h2>  
<p>If you don’t have a kitchen scale, you can still measure 75 grams of lentils using a standard cup. Fill the cup loosely without packing the lentils down. For UK measurements, use just under half a cup, and for US measurements, a scant half-cup will do. This method works well for most lentil-based air fryer dishes.</p>  

<p>Another trick is to use tablespoons—about 5-6 UK tablespoons or 6-7 US tablespoons equal 75 grams. This is handy for smaller batches or when prepping ingredients for <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/meal-prep>meal prep</a>. Always level off the top for accuracy.</p>  

<h3>Cooking Lentils in an Air Fryer</h3>  
<p>Lentils can be roasted in an air fryer for a crispy snack or used in patties and falafels. Pre-soaking helps reduce cooking time, especially for whole lentils. For 75 grams of lentils, ensure they're evenly spread in the basket for consistent results. After cooking, clean your air fryer with our recommended <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning tips</a>.</p>

<h2>Why accurate flaxseed measurements matter</h2>
<p>Flaxseed is packed with nutrients, and using the right amount ensures your dishes turn out perfectly.

Accurate conversions like 3 cups flaxseed to ounces make meal prep a breeze.</p>

<p>Many UK cooks prefer weighing ingredients for consistency, especially in baking. Flaxseed’s light, fluffy texture means volume measurements can vary slightly. That’s why converting 3 cups of flaxseed to ounces (12 oz) is so helpful. If you’re meal prepping, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/meal-prep>meal prep recipes</a> for ideas on using flaxseed efficiently.</p>

<h2>How to measure flaxseed correctly</h2>
<p>For the most accurate results, use a kitchen scale to weigh flaxseed in ounces or grams. If you don’t have one, fluff the flaxseed with a spoon before lightly spooning it into a measuring cup. Avoid packing it down, as this can lead to over-measuring. For air fryer recipes, consistency is key—whether you’re making granola or coating chicken.

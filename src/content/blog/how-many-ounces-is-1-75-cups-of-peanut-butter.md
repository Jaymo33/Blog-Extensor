<h3>How to measure peanut butter for air fryer recipes</h3>  
<p>Measuring sticky ingredients like peanut butter can be tricky. For 1.75 cups (14 ounces), use a dry measuring cup and level it off with a spatula.

<h2>Converting cups to ounces for UK cooks</h2>

Converting 1.75 cups of peanut butter to ounces (14 oz) makes it easier to follow international recipes. If you’re adapting a US recipe, this conversion ensures you don’t end up with overly dense or runny results.</p>  

<p>For those who prefer metric measurements, 14 ounces is roughly 397 grams. This flexibility is handy when using an air fryer, as many models have settings for both imperial and metric units.

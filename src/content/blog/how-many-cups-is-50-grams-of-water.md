<p>50 grams of water equals approximately 0.21 cups (or roughly 1/5 of a cup). This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise liquid measurements can make or break your dish. Whether you're baking, steaming, or adjusting moisture levels, knowing how to convert grams to cups ensures consistency.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Water Measurements Matter in Air Fryers</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on precise ingredient ratios to achieve crispy, evenly cooked results. Too much water can lead to soggy food, while too little may cause dryness. For example, when making air fryer cakes or steamed dishes, 50 grams of water (0.21 cups) helps maintain the right texture.

<p>Many UK and US recipes use cups, but scales measure grams. Converting 50 grams of water to cups (0.21 cups) bridges this gap. This is especially useful for recipes like air fryer soups or sauces, where liquid balance is critical. Visit <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>our recipe hub</a> for dishes that rely on precise water measurements.</p>  

<h2>How to Measure 50 Grams of Water Without Scales</h2>  
<p>If you don’t have scales, use a measuring cup marked in millilitres. Since 50 grams of water equals 50 ml, you can measure it directly. For imperial cups, remember that 0.21 cups is just under a quarter cup. This method works well for air fryer recipes like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>desserts</a> or marinades.</p>  

<h3>US vs. UK Cup Measurements</h3>  
<p>The US and UK use slightly different cup sizes. In the UK, 1 cup is 284 ml, while in the US, it’s 240 ml. For 50 grams of water, the difference is minimal (0.21 cups in both), but it’s good to know for larger quantities. Always check your recipe’s origin to avoid confusion.</p>  

<h2>Common Recipes Using 50 Grams of Water</h2>

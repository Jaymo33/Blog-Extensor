<p>4 tablespoons (tbsp) of plain flour equals approximately 30 grams (g). This conversion is essential for precise baking and air fryer recipes, ensuring consistent results every time. Whether you're whipping up a cake or coating chicken for your air fryer, accurate measurements matter. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we know how frustrating guesswork can be, so we've broken it down for you.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate flour measurements matter</h2>  
<p>Using the correct amount of plain flour ensures your recipes turn out perfectly. Too much flour can make baked goods dense, while too little may cause them to collapse. For air fryer recipes, like crispy coatings or batters, precision is key to achieving that golden crunch. A slight variation in flour weight can alter texture and cooking times, especially in an air fryer's rapid heat environment.</p>  
<p>Many UK bakers rely on tablespoons for small quantities, but grams offer unbeatable accuracy. Digital scales eliminate the guesswork of scooping and levelling flour. If you're exploring <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a>, you'll notice many now list ingredients by weight for foolproof results. Converting 4 tbsp plain flour to grams (30g) ensures your dishes turn out as intended.</p>  

<h2>How to measure 4 tbsp plain flour correctly</h2>  
<p>For consistent 30g measurements, spoon flour into the tablespoon without packing or tapping it down. Level off the excess with a straight edge for an accurate scoop. Dip-and-sweep methods can compress flour, adding up to 20% extra weight per tablespoon. This variance could throw off delicate recipes like souffl√©s or tempura batter.</p>  

<h3>Using a kitchen scale for precision</h3>  
<p>Digital scales are the gold standard for baking and air frying. Place your bowl on the scale, tare it to zero, then add flour until you reach 30g. This method works perfectly for recipes requiring multiple dry ingredients, like our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>air fryer cake collection</a>. No more washing measuring spoons between ingredients!</p>  

<h2>Common recipe conversions using 4 tbsp plain flour</h2>  
<p>Many air fryer favourites use this quantity as a base measurement. A 30g flour portion works perfectly for coating two chicken breasts or making a small batch of dough. When adapting oven recipes for your air fryer, remember that 4 tbsp (30g) of flour thickens about 200ml of liquid to a sauce consistency.</p>  
<p>For those converting US recipes, note that UK tablespoons hold slightly more (15ml vs 14.2ml). Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> helps navigate these differences. Whether making crispy tofu or fishcakes, 4 tbsp plain flour (30g) gives just enough coating without overwhelming the ingredients.</p>  

<h3>Adjusting for different flour types</h3>  
<p>While 4 tbsp of plain flour weighs 30g, wholemeal or self-raising varieties may differ slightly due to density. Always check packaging for specific weight guidelines, especially when preparing <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>air fryer desserts</a>. For gluten-free alternatives, you'll typically use the same 30g measurement, but may need binding agents like xanthan gum.</p>

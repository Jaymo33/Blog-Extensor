<p>0.375 cup of raisins equals approximately 1.5 ounces (oz). This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements can make or break your dish. Whether you're whipping up a quick dessert or adding raisins to a savoury meal, knowing the exact weight ensures consistency.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>

For example, adding too many raisins to a cake batter might make it overly dense, while too few could leave it lacking in flavour.</p>

<p>250g of crushed garlic equals approximately 8.82 ounces. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements can make or break a dish. Whether you're whipping up garlic-infused chicken or roasted vegetables, knowing the exact weight ensures consistent results. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we understand the importance of accuracy, especially when working with bold flavours like garlic.</p>

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on even cooking, and incorrect ingredient quantities can throw off texture and taste. Too much garlic might overpower a dish, while too little could leave it bland. For example, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>garlic butter shrimp recipe</a> calls for precise amounts to balance flavours perfectly. Converting 250g of crushed garlic to ounces (8.82 oz) helps you follow recipes without guesswork.</p>  
<p>Garlic’s density can vary slightly depending on how finely it’s crushed, but 250g consistently translates to roughly 8.82 ounces. This makes scaling recipes up or down a breeze. If you’re prepping multiple batches, check our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for other common ingredient conversions.</p>  

<h3>How to measure crushed garlic for air fryer recipes</h3>  
<p>For best results, use a kitchen scale to weigh your garlic. If you don’t have one, remember that 1 tablespoon of crushed garlic weighs about 10g, so 250g would be around 25 tablespoons. However, scales are far more reliable, especially for recipes like our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>garlic Parmesan chicken</a>, where precision is key.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for 250g of crushed garlic in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>This quantity of garlic is perfect for marinades, sauces, or seasoning large batches of food. Try it in garlic bread, roasted potatoes, or even as a base for homemade aioli. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>garlic-roasted vegetables</a> are a crowd-pleaser, and 250g of crushed garlic ensures robust flavour throughout.</p>  
<p>If you’re meal prepping, divide the 250g (8.82 oz) into portions and freeze them for later use. Garlic retains its flavour well when frozen, making it a time-saver for busy cooks. Just thaw and add to your air fryer dishes as needed.</p>  

<h3>Tips for handling and storing crushed garlic</h3>  
<p>To keep your garlic fresh, store it in an airtight container in the fridge for up to a week. For longer storage, freeze it in ice cube trays. After handling garlic, clean your air fryer basket with our recommended <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner</a> to prevent lingering odours.</p>

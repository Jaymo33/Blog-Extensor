<p>2.5 tablespoons (tbsp) of cornflour equals approximately 23 grams in UK measurements. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precision ensures crispy, evenly cooked results. Whether you’re coating chicken or thickening sauces, knowing the exact weight saves time and avoids kitchen mishaps. For more air fryer conversions, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>

<h2>Why accurate cornflour measurements matter</h2>
<p>Cornflour is a staple in air fryer cooking, often used for crispy coatings or as a thickener. Too little can leave food soggy, while too much may create a chalky texture. That’s why converting 2.5 tbsp of cornflour to grams (23g) ensures consistency. Many UK recipes, especially those on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, use weight measurements for reliability. Digital scales eliminate guesswork, making them ideal for air fryer enthusiasts.</p>

<p>When preparing popular dishes like air-fried chicken or tempura vegetables, the 2.5 tbsp cornflour to grams conversion becomes crucial. Unlike volume measurements, grams account for how densely packed the cornflour is in the spoon. For more recipe ideas using precise measurements, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipe category</a>.</p>

<h3>How to measure 2.5 tbsp of cornflour without scales</h3>
<p>If you don’t have digital scales, use the spoon-and-level method for accuracy. Lightly spoon cornflour into a tablespoon without packing it down, then level off the excess with a knife. Repeat this until you’ve measured 2.5 tbsp (23g). Avoid scooping directly from the bag, as this compacts the cornflour and leads to over-measuring. For sticky batters or coatings, this technique prevents heavy, uneven results in your air fryer.</p>

<h2>Cornflour conversions for common air fryer recipes</h2>
<p>Many air fryer recipes call for cornflour in specific quantities. Here’s a quick reference for popular conversions:</p>
<ul>
<li>1 tbsp cornflour = 9g</li>
<li>2 tbsp cornflour = 18g</li>
<li>2.5 tbsp cornflour = 23g</li>
<li>3 tbsp cornflour = 27g</li>
</ul>
<p>These measurements are particularly useful for recipes like crispy tofu or onion rings from our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/tofu>tofu collection</a>. Remember that humidity and brand variations can slightly affect weight, so adjustments may be needed.</p>

<h3>Tips for using cornflour in air fryers</h3>
<p>Cornflour works best in air fryers when combined with seasonings or other flours. For extra crispiness, mix 23g (2.5 tbsp) of cornflour with rice flour or baking powder. Always preheat your air fryer to ensure even cooking, and shake the basket halfway through.

<h2>Why accurate vinegar measurements matter</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of vinegar can make or break a dish. Too little, and your recipe might lack acidity; too much, and it could become overpowering. In air fryer cooking, precise measurements help balance flavours, especially in sauces and glazes. For example, a <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>chicken recipe</a> might call for 0.25 tbsp of vinegar to tenderise the meat without making it sour. Measuring by weight (grams) is often more reliable than volume (tablespoons) due to variations in density.</p>  

<p>Vinegar types also differ in weight—apple cider vinegar is slightly heavier than white vinegar per tablespoon. This means 0.25 tbsp of apple cider vinegar might weigh closer to 3.8 grams, while distilled white vinegar could be around 3.7 grams. Always consider the type of vinegar when converting for air fryer recipes to avoid mishaps.</p>  

<h3>How to measure 0.25 tbsp of vinegar without scales</h3>

Use a measuring spoon set with smaller increments, or fill a 1/4 tbsp measure halfway. For air fryer recipes, precision matters—especially when making dressings or <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable dishes</a> where vinegar plays a key role.</p>

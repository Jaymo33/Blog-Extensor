<p>3 cups of self-raising flour equals approximately 12.75 ounces (or 12 ¾ oz). This conversion is essential for precise baking, especially when using an air fryer where measurements can make or break a recipe. Whether you're whipping up cakes, bread, or other treats, knowing the exact weight ensures consistency.</p>

<h2>Why accurate flour measurements matter</h2>
<p>Baking is a science, and even small measurement errors can lead to dense cakes or dry bread. Self-raising flour, which contains baking powder, requires extra precision. If you're using an air fryer, the compact cooking space means ratios are even more critical. A slight imbalance can affect texture and rise.</p>
<p>For air fryer recipes, weighing ingredients like flour is often more reliable than volume measurements. Cups can vary based on how you scoop, but ounces give a consistent baseline. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for other common ingredient swaps.</p>

<h2>How to measure 3 cups of self-raising flour correctly</h2>
<p>To convert 3 cups of self-raising flour to ounces, use a kitchen scale for accuracy. Lightly spoon the flour into the measuring cup and level it off—don’t pack it down. This method prevents over-measuring, which could throw off your recipe.</p>
<p>If you don’t have a scale, remember that 1 cup of self-raising flour weighs roughly 4.25 ounces. Multiply this by 3, and you’ll get 12.75 ounces. For more air fryer-friendly recipes, browse our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipes section</a>.</p>

<h3>Common mistakes when measuring flour</h3>
<p>Scooping flour directly from the bag compacts it, leading to excess. Always fluff the flour first with a fork, then spoon it into the cup. Another mistake? Using liquid measuring cups for dry ingredients—they’re not interchangeable.</p>

<h2>Self-raising flour vs. plain flour in ounces</h2>
<p>Self-raising flour weighs slightly less than plain flour due to the added baking powder. While 3 cups of plain flour is about 13.5 ounces, self-raising flour comes in at 12.75 ounces. This small difference matters in air fryer baking, where precision ensures even cooking.</p>
<p>Need to adjust a recipe? Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>cake recipes</a> often include weight measurements for foolproof results. Bookmark this page for quick conversions!</p>

<h3>Converting other flour amounts</h3>
<p>If your recipe calls for 1 or 2 cups, here’s a cheat sheet: 1 cup = 4.25 oz, 2 cups = 8.5 oz. For larger batches, 4 cups would be 17 ounces. Keep these numbers handy for stress-free baking.</p>

<h2>Air fryer tips for baking with self-raising flour</h2>
<p>Air fryers circulate hot air, which can dry out baked goods if the flour ratio is off. Using the correct ounce measurement for 3 cups of self-raising flour helps maintain moisture. Preheat your air fryer, and avoid overcrowding the basket for even results.</p>
<p>For easy cleanup after flour-heavy recipes, try our recommended <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner</a>. It keeps your appliance in top shape for next time.</p>

<h3>Adjusting recipes for altitude or humidity</h3>
<p>In humid climates, flour absorbs moisture and may need slight adjustments. If your dough feels sticky, add a tablespoon less flour (about 0.25 oz) per 3 cups. High-altitude baking? Reduce baking powder slightly to prevent over-rising.</p>

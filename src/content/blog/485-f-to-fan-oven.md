<p>485 F converts to approximately 250 C in a fan oven. This is a common temperature for roasting meats, baking pizzas, or crisping up vegetables in your air fryer. Understanding this conversion ensures your dishes come out perfectly cooked every time.</p>

<h2>Why Convert 485 F to Fan Oven?</h2>
<p>Many recipes, especially those from the US, use Fahrenheit temperatures. If you're using a fan oven or air fryer in the UK, you'll need to convert these measurements. 485 F to fan oven is particularly useful for high-heat cooking methods that require precise temperatures.</p>
<p>At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we know how important accurate conversions are. Whether you're making crispy chicken wings or baking a quick pizza, getting the temperature right makes all the difference. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> can help with other common temperature conversions too.</p>

<h2>How to Use 485 F in Your Air Fryer</h2>
<p>When converting 485 F to fan oven settings for your air fryer, remember that most models use Celsius. Set your air fryer to 250 C for equivalent results. This temperature works well for recipes like our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>crispy chicken dishes</a> or roasted vegetables.</p>
<p>The circulating hot air in both fan ovens and air fryers means cooking times may be slightly shorter than conventional ovens. Always check your food a few minutes before the recommended time.

<h3>Temperature Conversion Tips</h3>
<p>When converting 485 F to fan oven, it's helpful to know the general rule: subtract about 25 degrees from conventional oven settings. This accounts for the fan's efficient heat distribution. So 485 F (250 C) in a fan oven gives similar results to 500 F (260 C) in a conventional oven.</p>

<h2>Common Uses for 485 F in Cooking</h2>
<p>485 F to fan oven (250 C) is ideal for achieving crispy textures. It's perfect for roasting potatoes, making pizza, or cooking meat with a delicious crust. The high heat helps create that sought-after golden brown finish while keeping the inside moist.</p>
<p>Many of our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/potatoes>potato recipes</a> recommend this temperature for perfect roasties. Remember to preheat your air fryer for about 5 minutes at 250 C before adding your food. This ensures even cooking from the start.</p>

<h3>Avoiding Common Mistakes</h3>
<p>When using 485 F in your fan oven or air fryer, avoid overcrowding the basket. Proper air circulation is key to even cooking at high temperatures. Also, consider using a light spray of oil for better browning at this heat level.</p>

<h2>Cleaning After High-Temperature Cooking</h2>
<p>Cooking at 485 F (250 C) can sometimes lead to more splatters and residue. Regular cleaning maintains your air fryer's performance.

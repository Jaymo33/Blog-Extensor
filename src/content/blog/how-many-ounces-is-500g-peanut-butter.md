<p>500g of peanut butter is approximately 17.64 ounces. Whether you're whipping up a batch of cookies or prepping a savoury sauce, knowing this conversion ensures your air fryer recipes turn out just right. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we understand the importance of precise measurements, especially when working with ingredients like peanut butter, which can vary in density.</p>  

<h2>Why Convert 500g of Peanut Butter to Ounces?</h2>  
<p>Many UK recipes, especially those for air fryers, use grams, while others rely on ounces. Converting 500g of peanut butter to ounces (17.64 oz) helps ensure consistency, whether you're following a classic peanut butter cookie recipe or experimenting with new dishes. Peanut butter’s sticky texture means even small measurement errors can affect your results, so accuracy matters.</p>  
<p>If you’re using an air fryer, precise measurements are even more critical. Air fryers cook quickly, and imbalances in ingredient ratios can lead to uneven cooking.

<h2>How to Measure 500g of Peanut Butter Accurately</h2>  
<p>Measuring peanut butter can be tricky due to its thick, sticky consistency. To get exactly 500g (or 17.64 oz), use a kitchen scale for the most accurate results. Scoop the peanut butter into a bowl on the scale until you hit the mark. If you don’t have a scale, remember that 1 tablespoon of peanut butter weighs roughly 16g, so 500g would be about 31 tablespoons.</p>  

<h3>Using Peanut Butter in Air Fryer Recipes</h3>  
<p>Peanut butter is a versatile ingredient in air fryer cooking, from glazes for chicken to energy bites.

<h2>Common Mistakes When Measuring Peanut Butter</h2>  
<p>One mistake is packing peanut butter into a measuring cup, which can lead to using more than needed. For 500g (17.64 oz), always weigh it instead. Another error is assuming all peanut butter brands have the same density—some are oilier, affecting weight. Stirring natural peanut butter before measuring ensures consistency.</p>

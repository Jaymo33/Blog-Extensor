<p>1.5 cups of cream is approximately 360 grams. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precision matters, ensuring your dishes turn out perfectly every time. Whether you're whipping up a creamy dessert or a savoury sauce, knowing the exact weight helps avoid kitchen mishaps. For more handy conversions, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Using the correct amount of cream can make or break your air fryer recipes. Too much or too little can affect texture, flavour, and cooking time. For example, a creamy pasta bake might turn out too dry or overly soggy if the cream measurement is off. That’s why converting cups to grams is so useful—it removes guesswork and ensures consistency. Visit <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>our recipe collection</a> for dishes that rely on precise measurements.</p>  

<p>Different types of cream, like double or single, have slightly varying densities, but 1.5 cups generally weigh around 360 grams. If you’re using a thicker cream, you might need to adjust slightly. Always level off your measuring cups for the most accurate results.

<h3>How to Measure Cream Without a Scale</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a kitchen scale, you can still measure cream accurately using standard cups. Fill the cup to the brim without packing it down, then level it off with a straight edge. Remember, 1.5 cups of cream equals roughly 360 grams, but slight variations can occur depending on the cream’s fat content.

<h2>Common Recipes Using 1.5 Cups of Cream</h2>  
<p>Many air fryer recipes call for 1.5 cups of cream, from rich soups to indulgent desserts. A classic example is a creamy mushroom sauce, which pairs perfectly with air-fried chicken or pasta. Another favourite is a no-bake cheesecake, where precise cream measurements ensure the perfect set. Browse our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>cake recipes</a> for more inspiration.</p>  

<p>If you’re making a savoury dish, like a creamy garlic dip, 360 grams of cream will give you the ideal consistency.

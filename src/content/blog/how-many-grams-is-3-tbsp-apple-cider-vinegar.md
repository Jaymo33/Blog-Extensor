<p>3 tablespoons (tbsp) of apple cider vinegar weigh approximately 45 grams (g). This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements can make all the difference. Whether you’re marinating chicken or whipping up a tangy glaze, knowing the exact weight ensures consistent results every time. For more air fryer conversions, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on even heat distribution, so ingredient quantities must be spot-on. Too much or too little apple cider vinegar can throw off the balance of your dish. For example, 3 tbsp of apple cider vinegar (45g) is often used in marinades for chicken or tofu. If you’re preparing a <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipe</a>, precise measurements ensure the perfect tangy flavour without overpowering the dish.</p>  

<p>Many air fryer recipes call for small quantities of liquids like apple cider vinegar. Measuring by weight (grams) is more accurate than volume (tablespoons), especially for sticky or dense ingredients. A digital kitchen scale is a must-have tool for air fryer enthusiasts. You’ll find plenty of recipes requiring 3 tbsp apple cider vinegar to grams conversions on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>our recipes page</a>.</p>  

<h3>How to measure apple cider vinegar correctly</h3>  
<p>To measure 3 tbsp of apple cider vinegar accurately, use a standard UK tablespoon (15ml per tbsp). Pour the vinegar into a measuring spoon until it reaches the brim without spilling. For grams, place a bowl on your scale, tare it to zero, then add the vinegar until it hits 45g. This method eliminates guesswork and ensures your <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable dishes</a> or marinades turn out perfectly.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for 3 tbsp apple cider vinegar in air fryer recipes</h2>  
<p>Apple cider vinegar (45g for 3 tbsp) is a versatile ingredient in air fryer cooking. It’s often used in marinades for meats like chicken or turkey, adding a subtle tang and helping to tenderise the protein. You’ll also find it in dressings for air-fried salads or as a flavour booster for roasted vegetables. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable recipes</a> for inspiration.</p>  

<p>Another popular use is in homemade air fryer sauces or glazes. A mixture of 3 tbsp apple cider vinegar (45g), honey, and mustard creates a delicious coating for wings or ribs. The vinegar’s acidity also helps create crispier textures in air-fried foods. For cleaning your air fryer after cooking with vinegar, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner guide</a> has you covered.</p>  

<h3>Converting other vinegar quantities to grams</h3>  
<p>If your recipe calls for different amounts of apple cider vinegar, here’s a quick reference: 1 tbsp = 15g, 2 tbsp = 30g, and 4 tbsp = 60g. These conversions work for most types of vinegar in air fryer recipes. Remember that different vinegars (like balsamic or white wine vinegar) may have slightly different weights, but apple cider vinegar consistently weighs about 15g per tablespoon.</p>

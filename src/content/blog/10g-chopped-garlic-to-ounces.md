<p>10g of chopped garlic equals approximately 0.35 ounces. This conversion is essential for precise cooking, especially when using an air fryer where ingredient measurements can make a big difference. Whether you're following a recipe or experimenting with flavours, knowing how to convert grams to ounces ensures consistent results every time.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on even cooking, and incorrect measurements can throw off your dish. Too much garlic might overpower the flavour, while too little could leave your meal tasting bland. Using 10g of chopped garlic (0.35 ounces) ensures the right balance for recipes like garlic bread, roasted vegetables, or marinades.

<p>Garlic is a staple in many dishes, and its intensity varies based on how it's prepared. Chopped garlic has a different density compared to minced or crushed, so weighing it ensures accuracy. If you're unsure about conversions, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> can help simplify the process.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure 10g of Chopped Garlic Without a Scale</h3>  
<p>If you don't have a kitchen scale, you can estimate 10g of chopped garlic using tablespoons. Roughly, one tablespoon of finely chopped garlic weighs around 10g (0.35 ounces). However, this can vary slightly depending on how finely you chop it. For best results, investing in a digital scale is recommended.</p>  

<h2>Common Recipes Using 10g of Chopped Garlic</h2>  
<p>Many air fryer recipes call for 10g of chopped garlic, such as garlic butter shrimp, roasted potatoes, or chicken marinades. This small but mighty ingredient adds depth to your dishes without overwhelming them. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipes</a> for inspiration on how to use garlic effectively.</p>  

<p>Garlic also pairs well with vegetables like mushrooms and potatoes, enhancing their natural flavours.

<h3>Storing Chopped Garlic for Future Use</h3>  
<p>If you've prepped extra chopped garlic, store it in an airtight container in the fridge for up to a week. You can also freeze it in ice cube trays with a bit of oil for longer storage. This way, you'll always have 10g portions ready for your next air fryer creation.</p>  

<h2>Cleaning Your Air Fryer After Cooking with Garlic</h2>  
<p>Garlic can leave a strong odour in your air fryer if not cleaned properly. After cooking, wipe down the basket with a damp cloth and use a mild cleaner. For stubborn residues, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner guide</a> offers step-by-step instructions to keep your appliance fresh.</p>

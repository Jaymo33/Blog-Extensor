<p>2.5 cups of sesame oil equals approximately 20 ounces (or 19.7 oz to be precise). This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements ensure perfect results every time. Whether you’re whipping up crispy tofu or flavourful stir-fries, knowing how to convert cups to ounces is a game-changer.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of sesame oil can make or break your dish. Too little, and your ingredients might dry out; too much, and they could become greasy. Air fryers rely on hot air circulation, so balancing oil quantities is key. For example, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> often call for light coatings of oil to achieve that ideal crispiness.</p>  

<p>Many home cooks underestimate the importance of converting cups to ounces, especially with dense liquids like sesame oil. A standard UK cup holds 8 fluid ounces, but oils vary in weight. Sesame oil, with its rich consistency, weighs roughly 7.9 ounces per cup. That’s why 2.5 cups translate to just under 20 ounces.</p>  

<h3>How to measure sesame oil for air frying</h3>  
<p>For best results, use a kitchen scale to weigh your sesame oil. If you don’t have one, a liquid measuring cup will do—just ensure it’s levelled off. Many <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion charts</a> include oil measurements to simplify the process. Remember, precision helps avoid soggy or unevenly cooked meals.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for sesame oil in air fryer recipes</h2>  
<p>Sesame oil adds a nutty depth to dishes like air-fried chicken, roasted vegetables, or even crispy tofu. A little goes a long way—just 1-2 tablespoons can elevate flavours. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipes</a> for inspiration on incorporating sesame oil into marinades.</p>  

<p>Another great tip? Mix sesame oil with lighter oils (like sunflower or rapeseed) to balance richness while keeping calories in check. This trick works wonders for dishes like air-fried shrimp or mixed seafood. For more ideas, browse our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/mixed-seafood>mixed seafood recipes</a>.</p>  

<h3>Storing sesame oil for longevity</h3>  
<p>To preserve its flavour, store sesame oil in a cool, dark place. Once opened, refrigeration extends its shelf life. Proper storage ensures your 2.5 cups (or 20 ounces) of sesame oil stays fresh for future air fryer creations.</p>  

<h2>Converting other oil measurements for air frying</h2>  
<p>If you’re working with different oils, remember that weights vary. For example, olive oil is slightly lighter at 7.6 ounces per cup. Always double-check conversions to avoid mishaps. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a> covers everything from coconut oil to vegetable oil.</p>

Check out our guide on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner</a> tips to keep your appliance in top shape. A well-maintained air fryer ensures consistent results, whether you’re using 2.5 cups of sesame oil or just a drizzle.</p>

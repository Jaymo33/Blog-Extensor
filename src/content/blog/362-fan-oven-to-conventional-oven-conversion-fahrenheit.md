<p>Converting 362°F in a fan oven to a conventional oven is simple: it’s roughly 340°F. Fan ovens circulate hot air, allowing them to cook food faster and at slightly lower temperatures than conventional ovens. This difference is crucial for baking, roasting, and air frying. If you’re using an air fryer, which works similarly to a fan oven, you might need to adjust cooking times too.

<h2>Why Fan Ovens Cook Differently</h2>  
<p>Fan ovens use a built-in fan to distribute heat evenly, reducing hot spots and speeding up cooking. This means recipes designed for conventional ovens often need temperature adjustments. For example, 362°F in a fan oven equates to about 340°F in a conventional oven. This 20–25°F difference ensures your food doesn’t overcook or dry out. Many air fryers operate like mini fan ovens, so the same principles apply.

<h3>How Air Fryers Compare to Fan Ovens</h3>  
<p>Air fryers work similarly to fan ovens but in a more compact space, which can intensify heat distribution. If a recipe calls for 362°F in a fan oven, you might need to reduce the temperature slightly in an air fryer to prevent burning. Always check food halfway through cooking.

<h2>Common Conversions for Baking</h2>  
<p>Baking at 362°F in a fan oven? Drop it to 340°F in a conventional oven for cakes, cookies, and bread. This adjustment prevents over-browning while ensuring even cooking. If you’re using an air fryer, start checking a few minutes early since they cook faster. Need dessert ideas?

<h3>Adjusting Cooking Times</h3>  
<p>Since fan ovens cook faster, reduce conventional oven times by 10–15%. For example, if a recipe takes 30 minutes at 362°F in a fan oven, try 25–27 minutes at 340°F in a conventional oven. Air fryers may need even less time, so keep an eye on your food. For cleaning tips, visit our guide on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer maintenance</a>.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Using the correct amount of liquid, like oat milk, ensures your air fryer dishes turn out just right. Too much or too little can affect texture, cooking time, and even flavour. For example, adding 414 ml (1.75 cups) of oat milk to a batter keeps it light and fluffy.

Precision is key, especially when adapting traditional recipes for air fryer use.</p>  

<p>Many air fryer recipes, like cakes or creamy sauces, rely on liquid measurements. Oat milk’s consistency can vary slightly by brand, so sticking to the 414 ml measurement ensures uniformity.

<h3>How to Measure 1.75 Cups of Oat Milk Without a Measuring Cup</h3>

<h3>Common Mistakes When Measuring Oat Milk</h3>  
<p>One of the biggest mistakes is using a liquid measuring cup for dry ingredients or vice versa. For 1.75 cups (414 ml) of oat milk, always use a liquid measuring cup with clear ml markings. Another error is eyeballing the measurement, which can lead to inconsistent results. To avoid this, level off the oat milk at the 414 ml mark for accuracy. Proper measuring ensures your air fryer dishes turn out as intended.</p>

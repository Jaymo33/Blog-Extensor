<p>104°C in a fan oven equals approximately 120°C in a conventional oven. This conversion is essential for adapting recipes between different oven types, especially when using an air fryer which often follows fan oven principles. Understanding this temperature shift ensures your dishes cook perfectly every time.</p>

<h2>Why Fan Oven Conversion Matters</h2>
<p>Fan ovens circulate hot air for even cooking, allowing them to operate at lower temperatures than conventional ovens. When a recipe calls for 104 fan oven, it's specifically designed for this efficient heat distribution. Converting to conventional oven settings prevents undercooking or burning your food. Many modern air fryers function similarly to fan ovens, making these conversions particularly useful for <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer cooking</a>.</p>

<p>The general rule for fan to conventional conversion is to increase the temperature by 15-20°C. This accounts for the concentrated heat in traditional ovens. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we recommend starting with a 15°C increase and adjusting based on your oven's performance. For delicate items like cakes or pastries, you might need to reduce this slightly to prevent over-browning.</p>

<h2>Practical Conversion Examples</h2>
<p>Let's explore some common cooking scenarios where 104 fan oven to conventional oven conversion is crucial. When baking cookies at 104°C fan, you'd set your conventional oven to 120°C. This ensures they crisp evenly without burning. For roasting vegetables, the same conversion applies, though you might increase the conventional temperature slightly for extra caramelisation.</p>

<h3>Air Fryer Adjustments</h3>
<p>Air fryers typically follow fan oven principles but with more intense heat circulation. When converting 104 fan oven to air fryer settings, you might actually reduce the temperature by 5-10°C. This prevents overcooking while maintaining the recipe's intended results. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipe collection</a> for adapted versions of classic dishes.</p>

<h2>Temperature Conversion Chart</h2>
<p>For quick reference, here's how 104 fan oven compares to other cooking methods: Fan oven 104°C equals conventional oven 120°C, gas mark ½, and air fryer 95-100°C. These conversions work for most <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>cake recipes</a> and delicate bakes. Always verify with a quick visual check 5-10 minutes before the recipe's suggested cooking time ends.</p>

<p>Remember that oven thermostats can vary, so it's worth investing in an oven thermometer for accuracy. This is especially important when working with precise temperatures like 104 fan oven conversions. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we've found that most home ovens run about 10°C hotter or cooler than their settings indicate.</p>

<h2>Common Cooking Applications</h2>
<p>The 104 fan oven temperature (120°C conventional) is ideal for slow-roasting tomatoes, drying herbs, or baking meringues. When converting these recipes for conventional ovens, monitor them closely during the first attempt. The same principles apply when adapting <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable recipes</a> between different cooking appliances.</p>

<h3>Special Considerations</h3>
<p>Some recipes specifically developed for fan ovens might need additional adjustments beyond simple temperature conversion. Factors like humidity, altitude, and cookware material can all affect the outcome. When in doubt, start with our standard 104 fan oven to 120°C conventional conversion and adjust from there.</p>

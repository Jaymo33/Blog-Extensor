<p>3 tablespoons of Greek yogurt equals approximately 45 grams. This measurement is key for precise cooking, especially when using an air fryer where ingredient ratios matter. Whether you're meal prepping or baking, knowing the exact grams in 3 tbsp of Greek yogurt ensures consistent results every time.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Using the correct amount of Greek yogurt can make or break a recipe. Too much or too little can affect texture, moisture, and cooking time. For air fryer recipes, precision is even more critical due to the appliance's rapid cooking method. A slight variation in ingredients like Greek yogurt could lead to undercooked or overly dry dishes.</p>  

<p>Greek yogurt is a versatile ingredient, often used in marinades, dips, and even baked goods. If you're following a recipe from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, getting the grams right for 3 tbsp of Greek yogurt ensures your dish turns out as intended. This is especially important for recipes like air-fryer chicken skewers or healthy yogurt-based desserts.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure Greek Yogurt Correctly</h3>  
<p>To measure 3 tbsp of Greek yogurt accurately, use a standard tablespoon and level it off with a knife. For grams, a kitchen scale is your best friend. Scoop the yogurt into a bowl on the scale until it hits 45 grams. This method eliminates guesswork and guarantees consistency.</p>  

<h2>Converting 3 Tbsp of Greek Yogurt to Grams</h2>  
<p>The conversion of 3 tbsp of Greek yogurt to grams is straightforward: 1 tablespoon equals about 15 grams, so 3 tbsp totals 45 grams. This applies to most Greek yogurt brands available in the UK. However, always check the label for density variations, as some brands may differ slightly.</p>  

<p>If you're scaling a recipe up or down, this conversion helps maintain balance. For example, if a recipe on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> calls for 6 tbsp of Greek yogurt, you’ll know it’s 90 grams. This precision is especially useful for baking, where ratios are crucial for success.</p>  

<h3>Using Greek Yogurt in Air Fryer Recipes</h3>  
<p>Greek yogurt adds moisture and tenderness to air-fried dishes. From marinades for chicken to batter for crispy coatings, 3 tbsp (45 grams) is a common measurement. Try it in recipes like air-fryer tandoori chicken or yogurt-marinated salmon for a delicious, healthy twist.</p>  

<h2>Common Mistakes When Measuring Greek Yogurt</h2>  
<p>One mistake is using a heaped tablespoon instead of a level one, which can add extra grams unintentionally. Another is assuming all yogurts weigh the same—Greek yogurt is thicker than regular yogurt, so its weight per tablespoon differs. Always measure by weight for accuracy.</p>

Their guides on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipes</a> and <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning your air fryer</a> are invaluable for home cooks.</p>  

<h3>Storing Greek Yogurt for Freshness</h3>  
<p>To keep Greek yogurt fresh, always seal the container tightly and store it in the fridge. If you’ve measured out 3 tbsp (45 grams) and have leftovers, use them within a few days. Greek yogurt can also be frozen for longer storage, though its texture may change slightly.</p>

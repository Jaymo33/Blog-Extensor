<p>285 ml of soy sauce is approximately 1.2 cups, making it easy to measure for air fryer recipes. Whether you're marinating chicken, preparing a stir-fry, or adding flavour to tofu, knowing this conversion ensures accuracy. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we help simplify cooking measurements so your dishes turn out perfect every time.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Soy Sauce Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of soy sauce is crucial for balancing flavours in air fryer dishes. Too much can overpower your meal, while too little may leave it bland. Converting 285 ml of soy sauce to cups (1.2 cups) helps maintain consistency, especially in recipes like teriyaki chicken or glazed salmon. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more handy measurement tips.</p>  

<p>Precision is key when working with marinades or sauces in an air fryer. Unlike traditional cooking methods, air fryers circulate heat rapidly, meaning flavours intensify quickly. A slight miscalculation in soy sauce measurements could throw off the entire dish. For perfectly balanced meals, always measure liquids like soy sauce carefully.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure 285 ml of Soy Sauce Without a Measuring Cup</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a measuring cup, you can still accurately portion 285 ml of soy sauce. A standard UK tablespoon holds 15 ml, so 19 tablespoons equal roughly 285 ml. Alternatively, a US cup measures 240 ml, meaning 285 ml is just over 1 cup plus 1 tablespoon.

<h2>Common Recipes Using 285 ml of Soy Sauce</h2>  
<p>Many air fryer recipes call for around 285 ml of soy sauce, particularly Asian-inspired dishes. From sticky honey-soy chicken wings to garlic-soy glazed shrimp, this measurement is a staple. Visit our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipe category</a> for delicious ideas using this exact quantity.</p>  

<p>Another popular dish is soy-marinated tofu, where 285 ml of soy sauce creates a rich, umami-packed coating. The air fryer crisps the tofu perfectly while locking in flavour. For vegetarian options, browse our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/tofu>tofu recipes</a> to make the most of your soy sauce measurements.</p>  

<h3>Adjusting Recipes for Different Soy Sauce Brands</h3>  
<p>Not all soy sauces are created equal—some are saltier or thicker than others. If your recipe calls for 285 ml of soy sauce but you’re using a stronger brand, consider reducing the amount slightly. Taste as you go to avoid over-seasoning.

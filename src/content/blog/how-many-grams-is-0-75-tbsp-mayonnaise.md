<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on even heat distribution, and incorrect ingredient quantities can lead to uneven cooking or soggy results. For example, using too much mayonnaise in a coating can make food greasy, while too little might leave it dry. That’s why converting 0.75 tbsp of mayonnaise to grams (11g) is so useful. It takes the guesswork out of measuring sticky ingredients like mayo. If you're preparing a batch of crispy <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>air fryer chicken</a>, this precision ensures golden perfection.</p>  

<p>Many UK cooks prefer weighing ingredients rather than using volume measurements like tablespoons. Grams provide a more consistent result, especially with dense ingredients like mayonnaise. A digital kitchen scale is a worthwhile investment for air fryer enthusiasts who want restaurant-quality dishes at home.

<h3>How to measure 0.75 tbsp of mayonnaise without scales</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have scales, you can still measure 0.75 tbsp of mayonnaise accurately. Fill a tablespoon three-quarters full, levelling off the excess with a knife. Remember, 0.75 tbsp equals 11 grams, so this visual method gets you close enough for most recipes. For sticky ingredients like mayo, lightly greasing the spoon first helps it slide off cleanly. This trick is handy when making <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/potatoes>air fryer potato wedges</a> with a mayo-based dip.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for 0.75 tbsp of mayonnaise in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>This small but mighty quantity of mayonnaise (11g) has several clever uses in air fryer meals. It’s perfect for binding breadcrumbs to fish fillets or creating a golden crust on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>air fryer vegetables</a>. You can also mix it with herbs and spices to make a flavourful coating for chicken wings. The high smoke point of mayonnaise makes it ideal for air frying, as it won’t burn as easily as butter or oil at typical cooking temperatures.</p>  

<p>Another great application is in creating air fryer sauces and dips. Combine 0.75 tbsp mayonnaise (11g) with garlic, lemon juice and herbs for a quick aioli. This measurement is also useful when making single-serving portions, ensuring you don’t overdo the calories.

These measurements are handy when scaling recipes up or down. For larger quantities, remember that 100 grams of mayonnaise equals about 6.5 tablespoons. Keeping these conversions in mind makes adapting recipes for your air fryer much simpler.</p>

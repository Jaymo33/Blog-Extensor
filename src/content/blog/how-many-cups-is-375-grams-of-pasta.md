<h2>How to Measure 375 Grams of Pasta Without a Scale</h2>
<p>If you don’t have a kitchen scale, you can still measure 375 grams of pasta using cups. A standard cup holds about 85 grams of uncooked pasta, so 4.5 cups will give you roughly 375 grams. This method isn’t as precise as weighing, but it’s handy in a pinch. For air fryer cooking, where precision matters, we recommend investing in a scale for the best results.</p>

<h3>Common Pasta Types and Their Cup Equivalents</h3>
<p>Different pasta shapes fill cups differently. For 375 grams of penne, you’ll need about 4 cups, while 375 grams of fusilli might fill 4.5 cups. Long pasta like spaghetti is trickier—375 grams could be around 5 cups when loosely packed. Always fluff the pasta lightly in the cup for an accurate measure.

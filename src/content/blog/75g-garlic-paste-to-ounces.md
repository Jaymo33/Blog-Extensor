<p>75g of garlic paste equals approximately 2.65 ounces. This conversion is handy when following air fryer recipes that use imperial measurements. Whether you're whipping up a marinade or seasoning your dish, knowing the exact weight ensures perfect results every time.</p>  

<h2>Why Convert 75g of Garlic Paste to Ounces?</h2>  
<p>Many UK air fryer recipes list ingredients in grams, but some older cookbooks or international recipes might use ounces. Converting 75g of garlic paste to ounces (2.65 oz) helps maintain accuracy, especially when precision matters for sauces or rubs. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we recommend using a kitchen scale for the best results, but this conversion saves time if you're in a pinch.</p>  

<p>Garlic paste is a staple in many dishes, from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken marinades</a> to <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>roasted veggies</a>. Getting the measurement right ensures balanced flavours. If you're working with a recipe that calls for 75g of garlic paste, now you know it's roughly 2.65 ounces.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure 75g of Garlic Paste Without a Scale</h3>  
<p>If you don't have a scale, you can estimate 75g of garlic paste using tablespoons. One tablespoon of garlic paste weighs about 15g, so 75g would be roughly 5 tablespoons. However, for air fryer recipes where consistency matters, investing in a digital scale is worth it. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more handy tips.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for 75g of Garlic Paste in Air Fryer Recipes</h2>  
<p>Garlic paste adds depth to many air fryer dishes. For example, 75g (2.65 oz) is perfect for marinating <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/shrimp>shrimp</a> or seasoning <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/potatoes>roasted potatoes</a>. Its concentrated flavour means a little goes a long way, so precise measurements prevent overpowering your meal.</p>  

<p>You might also use 75g of garlic paste in sauces or dips. Mix it with yogurt for a quick marinade or blend it into butter for garlic bread. The air fryer’s even heat distribution ensures the garlic flavour infuses perfectly without burning.</p>  

<h3>Storing Leftover Garlic Paste</h3>  
<p>If you have leftover garlic paste, store it in an airtight container in the fridge for up to two weeks. For longer storage, freeze it in ice cube trays—each cube holds about 15g, making it easy to measure 75g (or 2.65 oz) next time.

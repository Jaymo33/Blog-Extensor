<h2>Why convert 10g of treacle to ounces?</h2>  
<p>Many UK recipes, especially older ones, use ounces rather than grams. If you’re following a classic treacle tart recipe or adapting a dish for your air fryer, converting 10g of treacle to ounces helps maintain accuracy. Treacle’s thick consistency means even small measurement errors can affect texture and sweetness. Air fryer recipes, like sticky gingerbread or glazed meats, often need precise treacle quantities for balanced flavours.

<h3>How to measure 10g of treacle without scales</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have digital scales, 10g of treacle is roughly 2 level teaspoons. Lightly grease your spoon first to help the treacle slide off easily. For sticky ingredients like treacle, a syringe or graduated measuring spoon can give the most accurate 10g-to-ounces conversion. Remember, treacle’s density means volume measures aren’t always perfect, but they’ll work in a pinch for air fryer recipes.</p>  

<h2>Treacle in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Treacle works wonderfully in air fryer recipes, from glazes to baked goods. Its rich, molasses-like flavour caramelises beautifully under the air fryer’s intense heat.

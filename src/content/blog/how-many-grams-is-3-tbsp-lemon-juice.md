<p>3 tablespoons (tbsp) of lemon juice weigh approximately 45 grams (g). This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements can make all the difference. Whether you’re marinating chicken or adding zest to a dessert, knowing the exact weight ensures consistency. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we help you nail every recipe with accurate conversions. Keep reading to learn more about measuring lemon juice and other handy tips.</p>

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on precise cooking times and temperatures, so ingredient measurements must be spot-on. Too much or too little lemon juice can alter the flavour and texture of your dish. For example, marinating chicken with 3 tbsp lemon juice (45g) ensures the right balance of acidity. If you’re baking lemon drizzle cake in your air fryer, the correct gram measurement guarantees perfect moisture. Visit our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more helpful guides.</p>  

<p>Lemon juice is a common ingredient in many air fryer recipes, from seafood to vegetables. Knowing that 3 tbsp equals 45 grams helps you follow recipes accurately. This is especially useful if you’re scaling up or down a recipe. For more inspiration, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> collection. Accurate measurements ensure your dishes turn out perfectly every time.</p>

<h3>How to measure lemon juice correctly</h3>  
<p>To measure 3 tbsp of lemon juice accurately, use a liquid measuring spoon or a kitchen scale. Pour the juice into the spoon until it reaches the brim, levelling off any excess. If using a scale, set it to grams and tare the container before adding the juice. This method eliminates guesswork and ensures you get exactly 45 grams.

<h2>Common uses for 3 tbsp lemon juice in air fryer recipes</h2>  
<p>Lemon juice adds brightness to many dishes, and 3 tbsp (45g) is a versatile amount. Use it in marinades for chicken or fish, ensuring even coating before air frying. It’s also great for dressings, like a simple lemon vinaigrette for air-fried vegetables. For desserts, 3 tbsp lemon juice can be mixed into glazes or cake batters. Discover more ideas in our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert category</a>.</p>  

<p>Another popular use is in seafood recipes, such as air-fried shrimp or cod. The acidity of lemon juice enhances the natural flavours while keeping the dish light. If you’re meal prepping, 3 tbsp lemon juice can be used to preserve freshness in pre-cooked dishes.

The possibilities are endless with precise measurements.</p>

<h3>Converting other lemon juice measurements</h3>  
<p>If a recipe calls for a different amount of lemon juice, here’s a quick reference: 1 tbsp equals 15 grams, and 1/2 tbsp is about 7.5 grams. This makes scaling recipes up or down simple. For larger quantities, 1 cup of lemon juice weighs roughly 240 grams. Always double-check conversions to avoid errors in your air fryer cooking.

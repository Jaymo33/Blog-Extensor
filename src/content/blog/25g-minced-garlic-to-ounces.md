<p>25g of minced garlic equals approximately 0.88 ounces. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes, where precise measurements can make or break a dish. Whether you're whipping up garlic-infused chicken or a flavourful vegetable stir-fry, knowing the exact weight ensures consistency.

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air frying</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on even cooking, and incorrect ingredient quantities can lead to uneven results. Too much minced garlic might overpower your dish, while too little could leave it bland. Measuring 25g of minced garlic correctly (0.88 ounces) ensures balanced flavours. If you're new to air frying, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a> for inspiration.</p>  

<p>Many UK recipes use grams, while others prefer ounces, so knowing both is handy. For minced garlic, 25g is just under an ounce, making it easy to adjust if your scales only show one unit. This small but mighty ingredient packs a punch, so precision matters. Discover more tips on our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable recipes page</a>.</p>  

<h3>How to measure minced garlic without scales</h3>  
<p>If you don't have digital scales, a tablespoon can help. One tablespoon of minced garlic weighs roughly 10g, so 2.5 tablespoons equal 25g (or 0.88 ounces). This method isn't as precise but works in a pinch. For perfectly measured ingredients, invest in a kitchen scale—it's a game-changer for air fryer cooking.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for 25g of minced garlic</h2>  
<p>This amount is perfect for marinades, sauces, or seasoning proteins like chicken or shrimp. Try it in our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>garlic butter chicken recipe</a> for a flavourful twist. Minced garlic also elevates roasted vegetables or homemade air fryer bread. With 25g (0.88 ounces), you’ll add depth without overwhelming other ingredients.</p>  

<p>Garlic’s versatility makes it a staple in many cuisines, from Italian to Asian. Whether you're making stir-fries or garlic bread, 25g is a practical quantity for most household recipes. For more ideas, browse our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe hub</a>.</p>  

<h3>Storing minced garlic for freshness</h3>  
<p>To keep minced garlic fresh, store it in an airtight container in the fridge for up to a week. For longer storage, freeze it in ice cube trays—each cube holds about 10g (0.35 ounces), so 2.5 cubes equal 25g. This way, you’ll always have pre-measured garlic ready for your air fryer creations.</p>

<p>1.5 tablespoons (tbsp) of baking soda equals approximately 22.5 grams (g). This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements can make or break your dish. Whether you're baking, marinating, or cleaning your air fryer, knowing exact weights ensures consistent results every time.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Baking Soda Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Baking soda is a powerful leavening agent, and even small deviations can affect texture and taste. Too much can leave a bitter aftertaste, while too little may result in dense, flat bakes. For air fryer recipes, where heat distribution is rapid, precision is key.

<p>Many UK cooks rely on volume measurements like tablespoons, but grams offer greater accuracy. Digital scales eliminate guesswork, especially for ingredients like baking soda that clump or settle. If you're experimenting with <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>air fryer cakes</a>, always weigh your baking soda for foolproof rises.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure 1.5 Tbsp Baking Soda Correctly</h3>  
<p>For consistent results, spoon baking soda into your tablespoon without packing it down, then level it off with a knife. Repeat for the half tablespoon. Better yet, use a scale for 22.5 grams directly. This method avoids over-measuring, which is common with scooping.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for 1.5 Tbsp Baking Soda in Air Fryers</h2>  
<p>Beyond baking, baking soda works wonders in air fryers. A 1.5 tbsp (22.5g) mix with water makes a paste for scrubbing trays, while a sprinkle neutralises odours.

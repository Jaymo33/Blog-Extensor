<p>2 tablespoons (tbsp) of rapeseed oil weigh approximately 28 grams. This conversion is essential for air fryer cooking, where precise measurements can make all the difference in texture and flavour. Whether you’re following a recipe from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> or creating your own, knowing the exact weight ensures consistent results.</p>

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air frying</h2>  
<p>Using the correct amount of oil is crucial in air frying, as too much can make food greasy, while too little may lead to dryness. Rapeseed oil is a popular choice due to its high smoke point and mild flavour, making it ideal for air fryer recipes. For example, dishes like crispy potatoes or chicken wings benefit from just the right amount of oil to achieve that perfect crunch.</p>  
<p>If you’re unsure about other conversions, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for quick reference. This handy tool covers everything from tablespoons to grams, ensuring your cooking is always spot-on.</p>  

<h3>How to measure rapeseed oil accurately</h3>  
<p>For the most precise results, use a digital kitchen scale to weigh your rapeseed oil. Simply set your scale to grams, tare the container, and pour the oil until it reaches 28 grams. If you don’t have a scale, a standard UK tablespoon holds roughly 14 grams of rapeseed oil, so two level tablespoons will give you the required amount.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for rapeseed oil in air fryers</h2>

For inspiration, browse our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a>, which includes everything from crispy tofu to golden chicken thighs.</p>  
<p>When preparing frozen foods like chips or nuggets, lightly coating them with 2 tbsp (28g) of rapeseed oil ensures even cooking and a satisfying crunch. You’ll find plenty of ideas in our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/frozen-foods>frozen foods category</a> for quick and easy meals.</p>  

<h3>Tips for storing and using rapeseed oil</h3>  
<p>To maintain freshness, store rapeseed oil in a cool, dark place away from direct sunlight. Always check the expiry date, as old oil can develop an off flavour. After cooking, clean your air fryer basket with a specialised <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner</a> to remove any residual oil and keep it in top condition.</p>  

<h2>Converting other oil measurements</h2>  
<p>If your recipe calls for a different amount of rapeseed oil, here’s a quick reference: 1 tbsp is about 14 grams, while 3 tbsp equal roughly 42 grams. For larger quantities, 100ml of rapeseed oil weighs approximately 92 grams. Keeping these conversions in mind will help you adapt recipes effortlessly.</p>

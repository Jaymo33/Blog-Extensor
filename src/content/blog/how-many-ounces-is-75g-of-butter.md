<h2>Why Accurate Butter Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Using the correct amount of butter is crucial, especially in air fryer cooking. Too much butter can lead to greasy results, while too little might leave your dish dry. For example, if you're making air fryer cookies or cakes, 75g of butter (or 2.65 ounces) is a common measurement. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more handy tips.</p>  

<p>Many UK recipes use grams, but if your kitchen scales only measure ounces, this conversion is a lifesaver. Whether you're preparing a <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>cake</a> or a savoury dish, knowing that 75g of butter is 2.65 ounces ensures consistency. This small detail can elevate your cooking from good to great.</p>  

<h2>How to Measure 75g of Butter Without Scales</h2>  
<p>Don’t have kitchen scales? No problem. You can still measure 75g of butter using tablespoons or visual cues. One tablespoon of butter is roughly 14g, so 75g would be about 5.3 tablespoons. Alternatively, a standard UK block of butter is often marked in 50g increments, making it easy to eyeball 75g.</p>  

<h3>Using Butter Wrappers for Measurement</h3>  
<p>Most butter wrappers in the UK have measurements printed on them. If your butter comes in a 250g block, simply divide it into thirds to get roughly 83g, then shave off a small amount to reach 75g. This method isn’t exact but works in a pinch for recipes like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cookies>cookies</a> or sauces.</p>

<p>If you’re working with larger quantities, remember that 1 pound (16 ounces) of butter is roughly 454g. This is handy for batch cooking or meal prep, especially when using your air fryer for <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/meal-prep>meal prep</a> recipes. Precision ensures your dishes turn out perfectly every time.</p>  

<h3>Common Mistakes When Measuring Butter</h3>  
<p>One common mistake is using melted butter when the recipe calls for solid butter, or vice versa. Always check the recipe requirements. For 75g of butter, if the recipe specifies melted, measure it solid first, then melt it. This avoids inaccuracies that could affect your air fryer results.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on even heat distribution, and incorrect ingredient quantities can lead to uneven cooking. Agave syrup, being a liquid sweetener, affects texture and caramelisation.

Many of our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipes</a> use agave syrup as a healthier alternative to sugar, so mastering this measurement is key.</p>  

<p>Agave syrup’s viscosity means it’s best measured by weight rather than volume. A kitchen scale is ideal, but if you’re using measuring spoons, note that 40g fills roughly 2 tablespoons. For sticky ingredients like this, lightly greasing your measuring tools helps.

<p>1.25 cups of caster sugar equals approximately 10 ounces (oz). This conversion is essential for air fryer baking, where precision ensures perfect results every time. Whether you're whipping up cakes, cookies, or desserts, knowing the exact weight of your ingredients matters.</p>

<h2>Why accurate sugar measurements matter in air fryer recipes</h2>  
<p>Air fryers cook food faster and more evenly than traditional ovens, so precise measurements are crucial. Too much sugar can cause over-browning or uneven cooking, while too little may affect texture. Caster sugar, with its fine granules, dissolves quickly, making it ideal for air fryer desserts like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>cakes</a> and <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cookies>cookies</a>.</p>  

<p>Using 10 ounces of caster sugar for 1.25 cups ensures consistency. If you’re scaling a recipe, refer to our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for other common measurements. This avoids guesswork and guarantees your bakes turn out just right.</p>  

<h3>How to measure caster sugar correctly</h3>  
<p>For the most accurate results, use a digital kitchen scale to weigh your caster sugar. Scooping directly from the bag can compact the sugar, leading to excess. Instead, spoon it lightly into your measuring cup and level it off with a knife.</p>  

<h2>Converting other sugar amounts for air fryer baking</h2>  
<p>If your recipe calls for a different amount of caster sugar, here’s a quick reference: 1 cup = 8 oz, so 1.5 cups = 12 oz, and 2 cups = 16 oz. Keeping these conversions handy simplifies adjusting batch sizes for your air fryer.</p>

<h3>Common mistakes when measuring sugar</h3>  
<p>Packing sugar into a cup or using the wrong type (granulated vs. caster) can throw off your recipe. Caster sugar’s finer texture means it weighs slightly less per cup than granulated. Always double-check your conversions to avoid mishaps.</p>  

<h2>Tips for baking with caster sugar in an air fryer</h2>  
<p>Since air fryers circulate hot air, sugary batters can brown faster. Reduce cooking time by 1-2 minutes and check doneness with a toothpick. For sticky residues, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner guide</a> keeps your appliance spotless.</p>  

<p>Experiment with caster sugar in air fryer <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>desserts</a>, from soufflés to crumbles. Its quick-dissolving properties ensure smooth textures, while the 1.25 cups (10 oz) measurement guarantees consistency. Happy baking!</p>

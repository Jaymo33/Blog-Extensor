<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>

<p>Wheatgerm is nutrient-dense, so getting the right amount maximizes health benefits. Whether you’re making <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/breakfast>breakfast granola</a> or protein coatings, 5.3 ounces per 2 cups is the golden ratio. For best results, use a kitchen scale if your recipe lists weights. This avoids discrepancies between scooping methods or packing density.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure Wheatgerm Without a Scale</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a scale, spoon wheatgerm into a measuring cup and level it off. Avoid packing it down, as this can add extra ounces.

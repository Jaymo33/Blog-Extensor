<h2>Why Convert 150g of Garlic Paste to Ounces?</h2>  
<p>Many UK recipes, especially those for air fryers, use grams, while others rely on ounces. Converting 150g of garlic paste to ounces (5.29 oz) helps you follow recipes accurately. This is particularly useful when scaling recipes up or down. If you're prepping a large batch, precise measurements ensure even flavour distribution.

<p>Garlic paste is a staple in many dishes, from marinades to sauces. Knowing the exact weight in ounces avoids over or under-seasoning.

<h3>How to Measure 150g of Garlic Paste</h3>  
<p>Using a digital kitchen scale is the easiest way to measure 150g of garlic paste. If your scale displays ounces, it should read around 5.29 oz.

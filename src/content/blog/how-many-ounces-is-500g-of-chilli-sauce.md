<p>500g of chilli sauce equals approximately 17.64 ounces. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes, ensuring accurate measurements for sauces, marinades, and dips. Whether you're cooking wings, kebabs, or stir-fries, knowing how many ounces 500g of chilli sauce is will help you nail the flavour balance.</p>  

<h2>Why Convert 500g of Chilli Sauce to Ounces?</h2>  
<p>Many UK air fryer recipes use grams, but some kitchen scales or international recipes might list ounces. Converting 500g of chilli sauce to ounces ensures consistency, especially when following recipes from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>our collection</a>. A slight mismeasurement can throw off the taste, so precision matters.</p>  

<p>Air fryers cook quickly, and sauces reduce faster than in conventional ovens. Using the correct amount of chilli sauce—like 17.64 ounces for 500g—prevents over-seasoning or drying out. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for other common measurements.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure 500g of Chilli Sauce Accurately</h3>  
<p>For best results, use a digital kitchen scale set to grams. If your scale only shows ounces, aim for 17.64 oz. For thicker sauces, spoon them into a measuring jug to avoid air pockets. Thin sauces can be poured directly, but wipe the rim for an exact 500g (or 17.64-ounce) measure.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for 500g of Chilli Sauce in Air Fryers</h2>  
<p>This quantity is perfect for marinating 1kg of chicken wings or coating a batch of crispy tofu. Explore spicy <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipes</a> or drizzle it over air-fried prawns for a kick. Since air fryers circulate heat evenly, 500g of chilli sauce distributes flavour beautifully without burning.</p>  

<p>Prefer milder heat? Dilute 500g (17.64 oz) of chilli sauce with 2 tbsp honey or lime juice. For more inspiration, browse our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable recipes</a> that pair well with this amount. Always preheat your air fryer to avoid sauce splattering.</p>  

<h3>Storing Leftover Chilli Sauce</h3>  
<p>If you don’t use all 500g, transfer leftovers to an airtight container. Refrigerated, it keeps for 2 weeks. Reheat gently in the air fryer at 160°C for 1–2 minutes, stirring occasionally. For sticky residue, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning guide</a> has tips.</p>  

<h2>Converting Other Sauces from Grams to Ounces</h2>  
<p>The 500g-to-ounces rule applies to most sauces (e.g., BBQ, teriyaki), but density varies. A 500g jar of mayo equals ~17.64 oz, while 500g of syrup is closer to 17 oz due to viscosity. When adapting recipes, always check weights for consistency.</p>

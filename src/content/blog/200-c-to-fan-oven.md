<p>200°C in a conventional oven equals 180°C in a fan oven. This 20-degree reduction is standard when converting between these two oven types. When using an air fryer, which operates similarly to a fan oven, you'll typically follow the same rule.</p>

<h2>Understanding Fan Oven Conversions</h2>
<p>The key difference between conventional and fan ovens lies in their heating methods. Fan ovens circulate hot air continuously, cooking food more evenly and efficiently. This means you can reduce the temperature by about 20°C compared to conventional oven settings. For example, when a recipe calls for 200°C, you'd set your fan oven to 180°C.</p>
<p>This conversion rule applies to most baking and roasting scenarios. Whether you're making crispy roast potatoes at <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/potatoes>potatoes recipes</a> or baking a Victoria sponge from our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>cake collection</a>, the 20-degree reduction ensures perfect results. The same principle works in air fryers, which use rapid air technology similar to fan ovens.</p>

<h2>200°C in Different Cooking Appliances</h2>
<p>Modern kitchens often contain multiple cooking appliances, each with slightly different temperature requirements. A conventional electric oven at 200°C translates to 180°C in a fan oven, 180°C in an air fryer, and gas mark 6. These conversions ensure consistent cooking across devices.</p>
<p>When using an air fryer for recipes originally designed for conventional ovens, remember they cook faster due to their compact size. Check our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for precise timing adjustments. For instance, cookies that take 12 minutes at 200°C in a conventional oven might need just 8-9 minutes at 180°C in an air fryer.</p>

<h3>Why Temperature Conversion Matters</h3>
<p>Getting the temperature right prevents common cooking disasters like burnt edges or undercooked centres. The 200°C to 180°C fan oven conversion maintains the intended cooking intensity while accounting for the fan's efficiency. This is particularly crucial for delicate bakes like soufflés or precise roasts.</p>

<h2>Practical Applications for 200°C Recipes</h2>
<p>Many classic British recipes specify 200°C, from Sunday roasts to traybakes. When adapting these for fan ovens or air fryers, the 180°C setting delivers equivalent results. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a> includes converted versions of traditional dishes optimised for modern appliances.</p>
<p>For frozen foods like oven chips or chicken nuggets, the packaging often suggests 200°C. In a fan oven or air fryer, reduce to 180°C but check a few minutes early. The circulating air cooks frozen items faster, especially in compact air fryer baskets. Always refer to our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/frozen-foods>frozen foods guide</a> for best results.</p>

<h3>Special Considerations for Air Fryers</h3>
<p>While air fryers follow similar temperature rules to fan ovens, their smaller capacity affects cooking dynamics. At the 180°C equivalent of 200°C conventional, food browns faster due to closer proximity to heating elements. Shaking the basket or rotating trays ensures even cooking at this temperature.</p>

<h2>Temperature Conversion Charts</h2>
<p>For quick reference, keep our conversion chart handy when switching between conventional, fan, and air fryer cooking. The 200°C to 180°C fan oven rule applies to most recipes, though some delicate items might need an additional 10-degree reduction. Always consider your specific appliance's characteristics.</p>
<p>Regular cleaning maintains accurate temperature performance. Use our recommended <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner</a> to prevent residue buildup that could affect heating efficiency. This is especially important when cooking at higher temperatures like 180°C (200°C conventional equivalent).</p>

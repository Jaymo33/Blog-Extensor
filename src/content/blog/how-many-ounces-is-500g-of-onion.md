<p>500g of onion equals approximately 17.64 ounces. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes, ensuring accurate measurements for consistent results. Whether you're preparing a hearty stew, crispy onion rings, or a flavourful stir-fry, knowing how many ounces 500g of onion translates to helps you follow recipes precisely. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we understand the importance of getting measurements right, especially when using an air fryer where ingredient ratios can affect cooking times and textures.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate onion measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Using the correct amount of onion ensures your dish isn’t overpowering or lacking in flavour. Air fryers circulate hot air rapidly, so unevenly sized ingredients can cook inconsistently. If you’re converting 500g of onion to ounces, you’ll want to chop or slice them uniformly for even crisping. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for other common ingredient conversions to streamline your cooking process.</p>  

<p>Onions add depth to dishes, whether caramelised, roasted, or fried. Knowing that 500g of onion is roughly 17.64 ounces helps when scaling recipes up or down. For example, if a recipe calls for 250g of onion, you’d need about 8.82 ounces. This precision is particularly useful for meal prepping or batch cooking, where consistency is key. Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a> for inspiration on how to use onions in your air fryer.</p>  

<h3>How to measure 500g of onion without scales</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have kitchen scales, you can estimate 500g of onion by volume. One medium onion typically weighs around 150g, so roughly three to four medium onions will give you 500g (or 17.64 ounces). For smaller onions, you might need five or six. This method isn’t as precise as weighing, but it’s handy in a pinch. Remember, air fryer recipes often rely on precise measurements, so investing in a good set of scales is worthwhile.</p>  

<h2>Common recipes using 500g of onion</h2>  
<p>From French onion soup to crispy onion bhajis, 500g of onion (17.64 ounces) is a versatile quantity. In the air fryer, you can make caramelised onions, onion rings, or even onion-heavy stir-fries. The high heat of the air fryer caramelises onions beautifully, enhancing their natural sweetness. For more ideas, browse our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable recipes</a> section, packed with onion-centric dishes.</p>  

<p>Another great use for 500g of onion is making homemade onion powder. Simply slice the onions thinly, air fry until dehydrated, then blend into a fine powder. This DIY seasoning is perfect for adding depth to soups, marinades, and rubs. Plus, it’s a great way to preserve onions if you’ve bought in bulk. Don’t forget to clean your air fryer afterwards—our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning guide</a> makes it easy.</p>  

<h3>Tips for storing chopped onions</h3>  
<p>If you’ve prepped 500g of onion but only need half, store the rest in an airtight container in the fridge for up to three days. For longer storage, freeze chopped onions in portions—they’ll keep for months and can go straight into the air fryer from frozen. This is a great time-saver for busy cooks who want to whip up meals quickly.</p>

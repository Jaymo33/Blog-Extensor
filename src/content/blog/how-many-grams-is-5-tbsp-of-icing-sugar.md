<p>5 tablespoons of icing sugar is approximately 40 grams. This conversion is essential for precise baking, especially when using an air fryer for desserts like cakes or cookies. Whether you’re following a recipe from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> or creating your own, accurate measurements ensure consistent results.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurement Matters</h2>  
<p>Using the correct amount of icing sugar can make or break your recipe. Too much can make your dessert overly sweet, while too little might affect texture. For air fryer recipes, precise measurements are even more critical due to the appliance’s rapid cooking process. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for other common baking conversions.</p>  

<p>Many UK recipes use grams for accuracy, so knowing how to convert tablespoons to grams is handy. If you’re baking a cake from our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>cake category</a>, this conversion will save you time and hassle. Always spoon and level your icing sugar for the most accurate measurement.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure Icing Sugar Correctly</h3>  
<p>To measure 5 tbsp of icing sugar accurately, fluff the sugar first to avoid compaction. Spoon it lightly into the tablespoon and level it off with a knife. This method ensures you don’t pack in too much sugar, which could throw off your recipe. For more tips, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a>.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for 5 tbsp of Icing Sugar</h2>  
<p>Five tablespoons of icing sugar (40g) is often used in glazes, frostings, or dusting desserts. If you’re making air fryer cookies or muffins, this amount is perfect for a light sweetness. Visit our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert category</a> for inspiration on how to use icing sugar in your air fryer creations.</p>  

<p>You might also need this measurement for no-bake treats or decorative finishes. Since air fryers cook quickly, having pre-measured ingredients like icing sugar ensures a smooth baking process. Keep your air fryer clean with our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning guide</a> to avoid sugar buildup.</p>  

<h3>Converting Other Sugar Measurements</h3>  
<p>If your recipe calls for a different amount of icing sugar, you can scale this conversion. For example, 1 tbsp is roughly 8 grams, while 10 tbsp would be 80 grams. This flexibility helps when adjusting recipes for smaller or larger batches in your air fryer.</p>

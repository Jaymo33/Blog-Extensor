<p>5 grams of milk equals approximately 0.18 ounces. This conversion is handy for air fryer recipes where precise measurements matter. Whether you're whipping up a creamy sauce or baking a dessert, knowing how to convert grams to ounces ensures perfect results every time.</p>

<h2>Why Convert 5g of Milk to Ounces?</h2>  
<p>Many UK recipes, especially those for air fryers, use metric measurements like grams. However, some kitchen scales or older recipes might list ingredients in ounces. Converting 5g of milk to ounces (0.18 oz) helps avoid guesswork and guarantees accuracy. For more air fryer measurement tips, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>  

<p>Precision is key in cooking, particularly with dairy. Too much or too little milk can alter the texture of baked goods or sauces. If you're experimenting with air fryer recipes, accurate conversions ensure your dishes turn out just right. Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> for inspiration.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure 5g of Milk Without a Scale</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a digital scale, you can use a measuring spoon. One teaspoon of milk weighs roughly 5 grams (0.18 oz). This method isn’t as precise as a scale but works in a pinch. For best results, level off the spoon to avoid excess liquid.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for 5g of Milk in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Small amounts of milk, like 5 grams, are often used in glazes, batters, or light coatings. For example, a thin milk wash brushed on air-fried pastries gives them a golden finish. You’ll find this technique in many <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert recipes</a>.</p>  

<p>Another popular use is in creamy dips or sauces. A splash of milk (5g or 0.18 oz) can balance the consistency without overpowering other flavours. Pair it with air-fried chicken or vegetables for a delicious meal. Discover more ideas in our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipes</a> section.</p>  

<h3>Does Milk Weight Vary by Type?</h3>  
<p>Whole milk, skimmed milk, and plant-based alternatives have slightly different densities, but the difference is negligible for small amounts like 5 grams. Whether you’re using cow’s milk or almond milk, 5g will still be close to 0.18 ounces.</p>  

<h2>Tips for Measuring Small Quantities in Your Air Fryer</h2>  
<p>Invest in a digital kitchen scale for the most accurate measurements. Scales that switch between grams and ounces are ideal for air fryer cooking. Keep your air fryer clean and well-maintained for consistent results—try our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning guide</a> for tips.</p>  

<p>For liquids like milk, use a small measuring jug with metric and imperial markings. This eliminates the need for conversions and reduces mess. Precision ensures your air fryer dishes turn out perfectly every time.</p>  

<h3>Converting Other Dairy Measurements</h3>  
<p>If your recipe calls for larger amounts, remember that 100 grams of milk equals about 3.53 ounces. This ratio helps scale recipes up or down. Always double-check conversions to avoid errors in your air fryer cooking.</p>

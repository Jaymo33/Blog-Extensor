<p>0.375 cup of chilli sauce equals 3 ounces. This conversion is essential for precise cooking, especially when preparing air fryer recipes that require exact measurements for the best results. Whether you're making a spicy glaze or a marinade, knowing the weight ensures consistency in flavour and texture.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on even cooking, and using the right amount of ingredients is key. Too much or too little chilli sauce can affect the dish's moisture and taste. For example, if you're making <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>spicy chicken wings</a>, 0.375 cup (3 oz) of chilli sauce ensures a balanced glaze without overpowering the meat. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> can help with other common measurements.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure 0.375 Cup of Chilli Sauce</h3>  
<p>Use a liquid measuring cup for accuracy. Fill it to the 0.375 cup mark, or measure 3 fluid ounces directly. If you don’t have a measuring cup, a kitchen scale set to ounces will work just as well. This method is especially useful for thicker sauces like chilli sauce, which can be tricky to measure by volume alone.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for 0.375 Cup of Chilli Sauce</h2>  
<p>This amount is perfect for small-batch recipes. You might use it for marinating <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken</a> or drizzling over air-fried tofu. It’s also ideal for making dipping sauces or adding a kick to <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>roasted vegetables</a>. Since air fryers cook quickly, precise measurements prevent over-seasoning or dryness.</p>  

<h3>Converting Other Cup Measurements to Ounces</h3>  
<p>If your recipe calls for a different amount, here’s a quick reference: 0.25 cup = 2 oz, 0.5 cup = 4 oz, and 1 cup = 8 oz. Bookmark our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a> for easy access. Remember, thicker sauces like chilli sauce may vary slightly in weight, so adjust as needed.</p>  

<h2>Tips for Storing Leftover Chilli Sauce</h2>  
<p>If you have extra chilli sauce, store it in an airtight container in the fridge for up to two weeks. You can also freeze it in small portions for future use. Just thaw and stir before adding it to your next <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipe</a>. Proper storage ensures the sauce retains its flavour and consistency.</p>  

<h3>Cleaning Your Air Fryer After Using Chilli Sauce</h3>  
<p>Chilli sauce can leave sticky residues. To keep your air fryer in top condition, wipe it down with a damp cloth and use a mild <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner</a>. Avoid harsh chemicals that could damage the non-stick coating. Regular cleaning ensures your appliance stays efficient and ready for your next cooking adventure.</p>

<p>0.25 cups of chicken broth equals approximately 59 ml. This conversion is essential for precise cooking, especially when using an air fryer where measurements can impact texture and flavour. Whether you're making soups, sauces, or marinades, knowing the exact millilitre equivalent ensures your dish turns out perfectly every time.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on precise ingredient ratios to achieve crispy, evenly cooked results. Using too much or too little liquid, like chicken broth, can affect browning and moisture levels. For example, a recipe calling for 0.25 cups of chicken broth (59 ml) ensures the right balance for deglazing or adding flavour without making food soggy.

<p>Many air fryer recipes, especially those for stews or braised dishes, require small amounts of broth. Measuring 0.25 cups (59 ml) accurately prevents over-pouring, which could lead to steaming instead of crisping. If you're prepping <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipes</a>, this precision ensures juicy meat with a golden finish.</p>  

<h2>Converting 0.25 Cups of Chicken Broth to ml</h2>  
<p>The standard conversion for 0.25 cups of chicken broth is 59 ml in both UK and US measurements. This consistency simplifies following international recipes. For context, 1 cup equals 237 ml, so dividing by four gives you the 59 ml equivalent for 0.25 cups. Always use a liquid measuring cup for accuracy, as dry cups can vary slightly.</p>  

<h3>Does Chicken Broth Density Affect the Conversion?</h3>  
<p>No—chicken broth’s density is close enough to water that the 59 ml measurement holds true. Unlike thicker liquids like cream or oil, broth’s consistency means volume conversions remain straightforward. This makes it easy to scale recipes up or down, whether you're cooking for one or meal prepping.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for 0.25 Cups (59 ml) of Chicken Broth</h2>  
<p>This small quantity is perfect for deglazing an air fryer basket after cooking meats, adding moisture to grains like quinoa, or thinning sauces. For example, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer mushroom risotto</a> uses precisely 59 ml of broth to maintain creaminess without excess liquid. It’s also ideal for marinating tofu or vegetables, infusing flavour without drowning them.</p>  

<h3>Tips for Measuring Without a Cup</h3>  
<p>No measuring cup? Use a tablespoon—59 ml is roughly 4 tablespoons. Alternatively, repurpose a standard medicine syringe (often marked in ml) for pinpoint accuracy. Just ensure your tools are clean, especially when prepping <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable dishes</a> where broth enhances natural flavours.</p>  

<h2>UK vs. US Cup Measurements for Chicken Broth</h2>  
<p>While 0.25 cups of chicken broth equals 59 ml in both regions, note that UK cups are slightly larger (284 ml vs. 237 ml per full cup). However, the difference is negligible for small amounts like 0.25 cups. For peace of mind, stick to ml measurements when using recipes from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> or other international sources.</p>

<p>0.33 cup of semolina equals approximately 1.76 ounces. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precision ensures perfect texture and consistency. Whether you’re making crispy coatings or fluffy baked goods, knowing how many ounces are in 0.33 cup of semolina helps you nail the recipe every time.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on even heat distribution, so ingredient proportions must be spot-on. Too much semolina can make coatings overly dense, while too little might leave dishes undercrisped. For recipes like air-fried falafel or breaded chicken, 0.33 cup of semolina (1.76 ounces) is a common measurement. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more handy tips.</p>  

<p>Semolina’s coarse texture absorbs moisture differently than flour, so weighing it ensures consistency. If you’re adapting a recipe from cups to ounces, a kitchen scale is your best friend.

<h3>How to Measure 0.33 Cup of Semolina Without a Scale</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a scale, use the spoon-and-level method: lightly spoon semolina into a measuring cup and level it off. Avoid packing it down, as this can lead to overmeasuring. Remember, 0.33 cup of semolina to ounces is roughly 1.76 oz, but slight variations can occur based on humidity.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for Semolina in Air Fryer Recipes</h2>  
<p>Semolina adds crunch to air-fried foods like fish, veggies, or arancini. Its high gluten content also works well in doughs for air-fryer pizzas or flatbreads. For a golden crust, try coating tofu or shrimp in 0.33 cup of semolina (1.76 ounces) mixed with spices.

<p>4 tablespoons of Nutella equals approximately 64 grams. This conversion is essential for precise baking and air fryer recipes, ensuring your dishes turn out perfectly every time. Whether you’re whipping up a batch of cookies or drizzling Nutella over air-fried desserts, knowing the exact weight helps maintain consistency.

<h2>Why Measuring Nutella Accurately Matters</h2>  
<p>Using the correct amount of Nutella ensures your recipes have the right texture and flavour. Too much can make desserts overly rich, while too little might leave them lacking. Air fryer recipes, in particular, benefit from precise measurements due to the appliance’s rapid cooking style. If you’re making <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>air fryer desserts</a>, accuracy is key to avoid under or overcooking.</p>  

<p>Nutella’s thick, spreadable consistency means volume measurements like tablespoons can vary slightly. Converting to grams eliminates guesswork, especially when scaling recipes up or down. For more tips on perfecting your air fryer creations, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a>.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure 4 Tbsp of Nutella</h3>  
<p>To measure 4 tablespoons of Nutella, use a standard UK tablespoon (15ml per tbsp). Level off each spoonful with a knife for accuracy. If you’re using a kitchen scale, 64 grams is your target. This method works for all Nutella-based recipes, from air-fried pastries to no-bake treats.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for 4 Tbsp of Nutella</h2>  
<p>Four tablespoons of Nutella (64g) is enough to frost a small cake, fill crepes, or drizzle over air-fried bananas. It’s also the perfect amount for a batch of 12 Nutella-stuffed cookies. For inspiration, try our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cookies>air fryer cookie recipes</a>.</p>  

<p>Nutella’s versatility shines in air fryer recipes—swirl it into brownie batter, mix it with oats for energy balls, or use it as a dip for churros. Remember to clean your air fryer after sticky recipes with our recommended <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning tips</a>.</p>  

<h3>Converting Other Nutella Measurements</h3>  
<p>If your recipe calls for a different amount, here’s a quick guide: 1 tbsp Nutella = 16g, 2 tbsp = 32g, and 3 tbsp = 48g. For larger quantities, 100g Nutella equals roughly 6.25 tbsp. Bookmark <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> for more handy conversion guides.</p>

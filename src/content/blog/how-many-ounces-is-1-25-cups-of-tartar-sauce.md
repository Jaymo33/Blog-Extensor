<p>1.25 cups of tartar sauce equals approximately 10 ounces. This conversion is handy when preparing air fryer recipes that require precise measurements for the best results. Whether you're making fish fillets or crispy shrimp, knowing the exact weight ensures consistency in flavour and texture.</p>

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>
<p>Using the right amount of tartar sauce can make or break your air fryer dish. Too little, and your meal might lack flavour; too much, and it could become soggy. That’s why converting cups to ounces is so useful. For more air fryer tips, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>

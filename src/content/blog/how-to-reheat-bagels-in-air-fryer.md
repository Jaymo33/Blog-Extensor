<p>To reheat bagels in an air fryer, set the temperature to 160°C and cook for 3-4 minutes. This method restores that freshly-baked texture while keeping the inside soft and the exterior slightly crisp. Whether you're reviving day-old bagels or ones from the freezer, your air fryer does the job better than a microwave or conventional oven.</p>

<h2>Why Use an Air Fryer for Reheating Bagels?</h2>
<p>The air fryer circulates hot air around the bagel, crisping the exterior while gently warming the interior. Unlike microwaving which can make bagels rubbery, or toasting which dries them out, air frying gives balanced results. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we've tested this method extensively with all types of bagels from plain to seeded.</p>
<p>Another advantage is speed - your air fryer reheats bagels in about a quarter of the time a conventional oven would take. The compact size also means less energy usage compared to heating a full-sized oven. If you're reheating multiple bagels, you might need to work in batches depending on your air fryer's capacity.</p>

<h3>Ideal Temperature for Reheating Bagels</h3>
<p>160°C (320°F) is the sweet spot for reheating bagels in an air fryer. This temperature is high enough to crisp the outside but low enough to prevent burning or excessive drying. Some models may vary slightly, so check your bagels at the 3-minute mark. For frozen bagels, you might need to add an extra minute or two.</p>

<h2>Step-by-Step Guide to Reheating Bagels</h2>
<p>Start by preheating your air fryer to 160°C for about 3 minutes. Place the bagel directly in the basket - no oil or parchment needed. For whole bagels, cook for 3-4 minutes. If you've sliced your bagel in half, reduce the time to 2-3 minutes to prevent over-crisping. The bagel is ready when it's warm throughout and the outside has a slight crispness.</p>
<p>For extra freshness, lightly spritz the cut sides of the bagel with water before reheating. This helps prevent drying out. If you're reheating specialty bagels like everything or asiago, you might want to check them a minute early as the toppings can brown quickly.

<h3>Adjustments for Different Bagel Types</h3>
<p>Denser bagels like whole wheat or rye may need an extra 30 seconds, while lighter plain bagels often reheat quicker. For sweet bagels like cinnamon raisin, consider lowering the temperature to 150°C to prevent sugar burning. Stuffed bagels (like cream cheese-filled) should be reheated at a lower temperature (140°C) for longer (5-6 minutes) to warm the filling without making the exterior too hard.</p>

<h2>Common Mistakes to Avoid</h2>
<p>Overcrowding the basket is a frequent error - bagels need space for air circulation. Another is reheating at too high a temperature which leads to burnt exteriors and cold centres. Using the wrong time can also ruin your bagels - 30 seconds too long can turn them from perfect to hockey pucks.</p>
<p>Don't forget that different air fryer models may require slight adjustments. Consult your manual or our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for model-specific guidance. Always start with less time and add more if needed - you can't undo overcooking!</p>

<h3>Storing Bagels for Best Reheating Results</h3>
<p>For optimal reheating, store bagels in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 2 days. Beyond that, freeze them wrapped tightly in foil or plastic. When ready to reheat, you can go straight from freezer to air fryer - just add 1-2 minutes to the cooking time. Avoid refrigerating bagels as this accelerates staling.</p>

<h2>Creative Ways to Serve Reheated Bagels</h2>
<p>A perfectly reheated bagel deserves great toppings. Try smashed avocado with chilli flakes, or cream cheese with smoked salmon. For a sweet option, almond butter with banana slices works wonderfully. The air fryer can even help toast any additional ingredients - try melting cheese on your bagel during the last minute of reheating.</p>
<p>If you're meal prepping, consider slicing and freezing bagels with your favourite spreads already applied. Then reheat them directly in the air fryer - the spread will melt perfectly.

<h3>Cleaning Your Air Fryer After Reheating Bagels</h3>
<p>Bagel crumbs and seeds can accumulate in your air fryer basket. After cooling, remove the basket and shake out loose debris. For stubborn bits, soak in warm soapy water or use our recommended <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaning methods</a>.

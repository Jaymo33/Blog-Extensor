<p>200g of minced garlic equals approximately 7.05 ounces. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements ensure the best flavour and texture. Whether you're whipping up garlic-infused dishes or following a recipe from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, knowing this conversion saves time and avoids kitchen mishaps.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of minced garlic can make or break your dish. Too little, and the flavour falls flat; too much, and it overpowers other ingredients. Air fryers cook food quickly, so balanced seasoning is key. For example, recipes like garlic butter shrimp or roasted garlic potatoes rely on precise garlic measurements. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more handy tips.</p>  

<p>Minced garlic is denser than whole cloves, so weight conversions like 200g to ounces ensure consistency. This is especially useful for batch cooking or meal prepping. If you're exploring <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>garlic chicken recipes</a>, accurate measurements guarantee perfect results every time.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure Minced Garlic Without a Scale</h3>  
<p>No kitchen scale? No problem. One tablespoon of minced garlic weighs roughly 10g, so 200g would be about 20 tablespoons. However, this method isn’t as precise as weighing, so for best results, invest in a digital scale. For more measurement hacks, browse our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a>.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for 200g Minced Garlic in Air Fryer Recipes</h2>  
<p>From marinades to sauces, 200g of minced garlic (7.05 ounces) is a versatile ingredient. Try it in garlic bread, stir-fries, or even as a base for homemade garlic oil. The air fryer’s rapid circulation ensures even flavour distribution, making it ideal for garlic-heavy dishes. For inspiration, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>garlic-roasted vegetables</a>.</p>  

<p>Garlic’s potency means a little goes a long way, but 200g is perfect for larger batches or meal prep. If you’re cooking for a crowd, this amount ensures bold, consistent flavour. Don’t forget to clean your air fryer afterward—our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning guide</a> has you covered.</p>  

<h3>Storing Leftover Minced Garlic</h3>  
<p>If you don’t use all 200g at once, store leftovers in an airtight container in the fridge for up to two weeks. Alternatively, freeze minced garlic in ice cube trays for easy portioning. This way, you’ll always have the right amount on hand for your next air fryer creation.</p>

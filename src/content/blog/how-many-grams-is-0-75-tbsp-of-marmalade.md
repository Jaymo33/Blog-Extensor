    "text": "While possible, jams lack marmalade’s citrus peel and may behave differently under heat. If substituting, start with 10g jam and adjust, as jams often have higher water content. The air fryer’s intense heat can cause quicker caramelisation with substitutes, so monitor closely."

<p>0.75 tbsp of marmalade equals approximately 11.25 grams. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precision ensures perfect texture and flavour. Whether you're glazing meats or baking desserts, knowing the exact weight helps avoid soggy or overly dry results. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we focus on accuracy to elevate your cooking game.</p>

<h2>Why accurate marmalade measurements matter</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of marmalade can make or break your dish. Too little, and your glaze might lack sweetness; too much, and it could overpower other flavours. In air fryer cooking, precise measurements like 0.75 tbsp of marmalade to grams ensure even caramelisation. For more conversion tips, check our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>  
<p>Marmalade’s sticky consistency makes volume measurements tricky. A slight variation in how you fill the tablespoon can alter the weight. That’s why weighing 0.75 tbsp of marmalade in grams (11.25g) is more reliable. This method is especially useful for recipes like air-fried citrus cakes or sticky wings.</p>

<h3>How to measure 0.75 tbsp marmalade without scales</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have digital scales, use the displacement method. Fill a measuring jug with 50ml water, then add marmalade until the water rises to 56.25ml (since 1 tbsp ≈ 15ml). This roughly equals 0.75 tbsp or 11.25 grams. For more clever hacks, browse our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a>.</p>

<h2>Common uses for 0.75 tbsp marmalade in air fryers</h2>

Visit our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert category</a> for inspiration.</p>

The sugar content helps with browning, giving treats that perfect golden hue. Always measure carefully – even 5 extra grams can affect cooking times.</p>

<h3>Storing leftover marmalade</h3>  
<p>After measuring out your 0.75 tbsp (11.25g), seal the jar tightly to prevent drying. Wipe the rim clean to avoid sticky buildup – a tip that’ll save you from tough <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaning</a> later.

Honey, for example, is denser than maple syrup, so weight-based measurements (grams) are more reliable for swapping them in recipes. Always adjust cooking times in your air fryer accordingly."

    "@type": "Answer",
    "text": "Air fryers intensify flavours as they concentrate sauces and glazes during cooking. If a recipe tastes overly sweet, try reducing the maple syrup by 10-20% (to ~300 ml) or balancing it with acidic ingredients like lemon juice or vinegar. Taste as you go for best results."

<p>1.5 cups of maple syrup equals 355 ml. This conversion is essential for precision in baking and cooking, especially when using an air fryer where measurements can make or break a recipe. Whether you're whipping up pancakes or glazing salmon, knowing the exact ml equivalent ensures perfect results every time.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>
<p>Air fryers rely on precise cooking times and ingredient ratios to deliver crispy, evenly cooked dishes. Using the correct amount of maple syrup, such as 355 ml for 1.5 cups, ensures your recipes turn out as intended. Too much or too little can affect texture, caramelisation, and even cooking times.

<p>Maple syrup is a versatile ingredient in both sweet and savoury dishes. From glazes to marinades, its viscosity means measurements need to be spot-on. If you're adapting a traditional recipe for your air fryer, converting cups to ml is a crucial step. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more handy measurements.</p>

<h3>How to Measure Maple Syrup Correctly</h3>
<p>For the most accurate results, use a liquid measuring cup or a kitchen scale. Maple syrup’s thickness can make it tricky to measure, so lightly greasing your measuring cup can help it pour out cleanly. Remember, 1.5 cups of maple syrup is 355 ml, whether you're in the UK or the US.</p>

<h2>Common Uses for 1.5 Cups of Maple Syrup in Air Fryer Recipes</h2>
<p>This quantity is perfect for batch cooking or meal prep. You might use it for a large tray of roasted vegetables, a glaze for air-fried chicken, or a sweet topping for desserts. Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipes section</a> for inspiration on how to use 355 ml of maple syrup in your air fryer.</p>

<p>Maple syrup isn’t just for pancakes—it’s a star in savoury dishes too. Try it in a marinade for salmon or as a glaze for air-fried tofu. The 1.5 cups (355 ml) measurement is ideal for these larger recipes. For more ideas, browse our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/salmon>salmon recipes</a>.</p>

<h3>Converting Other Maple Syrup Measurements</h3>
<p>If your recipe calls for a different amount, here’s a quick reference: 1 cup = 237 ml, and ½ cup = 118 ml. These conversions are handy when scaling recipes up or down for your air fryer. Always measure carefully to avoid sticky situations!</p>

<h2>Tips for Working with Maple Syrup in Your Air Fryer</h2>
<p>Maple syrup can caramelise quickly in the air fryer’s high heat. To prevent burning, mix it with a little oil or water when using it as a glaze. And remember, 1.5 cups (355 ml) is a generous amount—perfect for recipes serving 4-6 people.</p>

<p>Cleaning up after using maple syrup is easier if you tackle it right away. Check out our guide on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner</a> to keep your appliance in top shape. A well-maintained air fryer ensures consistent results every time you cook.</p>

<h3>Storing Leftover Maple Syrup</h3>
<p>If you have leftover syrup from your 1.5 cups (355 ml), store it in an airtight container in the fridge. It’ll keep for months and can be reheated gently for future use. Just be sure to measure it out again next time—accuracy is key!</p>

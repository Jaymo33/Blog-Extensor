<h2>Why accurate measurements matter for porridge oats</h2>  
<p>Using the correct amount of porridge oats ensures your recipes turn out perfectly every time. Too little, and your dish may be watery; too much, and it could become overly thick. Air fryers, in particular, rely on precise measurements for even cooking. For example, if you’re making <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer granola</a>, 1 tbsp of porridge oats to grams ensures the right texture.</p>  

<p>Porridge oats are a staple in many British households, and their weight can vary slightly depending on how they’re packed. Scooping them lightly versus pressing them into the tablespoon can affect the gram measurement. Always level off your tablespoon for the most accurate results. If you’re unsure, a kitchen scale is your best friend for perfect conversions.</p>  

<h3>How to measure 1 tbsp of porridge oats without a scale</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a kitchen scale, you can still measure 1 tbsp of porridge oats accurately. Use a standard UK tablespoon and fill it loosely without packing the oats down. Level it off with the back of a knife for a consistent 8-gram measurement. This method works well for recipes like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/breakfast>air fryer breakfast bars</a>.</p>

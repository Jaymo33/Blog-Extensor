<p>25g of double cream is approximately 0.88 ounces. This conversion is essential for precise cooking, especially when using an air fryer where measurements can make or break a recipe. Whether you’re whipping up a dessert or adding richness to a savoury dish, knowing the exact weight ensures perfect results every time.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on precise ingredient ratios to deliver even cooking and perfect textures. Using too much or too little double cream can affect the consistency of your dish. For example, adding 25g of double cream to a sauce or batter requires accuracy to avoid it becoming too thick or runny. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we emphasise the importance of measurements for flawless air fryer meals.</p>  

<p>Many UK recipes use grams, while others prefer ounces, so knowing how to convert between the two is handy. A digital kitchen scale is the best tool for this, but if you don’t have one, our conversion guide will help. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for other common ingredient swaps.</p>  

<h3>How to measure 25g of double cream without scales</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have scales, you can use tablespoons to measure 25g of double cream. One tablespoon of double cream weighs roughly 15g, so 1.5 tablespoons will give you close to 25g. This method isn’t as precise as weighing, but it works in a pinch for recipes where slight variations won’t ruin the dish.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for 25g of double cream in air fryer recipes</h2>  
<p>Double cream adds richness to both sweet and savoury dishes. In air fryer cooking, 25g is often used in sauces, custards, or as a topping. For example, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> section features creamy pasta bakes and indulgent desserts that call for small amounts of double cream.</p>  

<p>You might also use 25g of double cream to make a quick glaze for air-fried scones or to enrich a mashed potato topping. Since air fryers cook quickly, measuring ingredients like double cream correctly ensures your dishes turn out perfectly every time. For more inspiration, browse our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert recipes</a>.</p>  

<h3>Converting other cream measurements</h3>  
<p>If your recipe calls for a different amount of double cream, here’s a quick reference: 50g is about 1.76 ounces, and 100g equals roughly 3.53 ounces. Keeping these conversions in mind saves time and avoids kitchen mishaps. For more tips, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning guide</a> ensures your air fryer stays in top condition for precise cooking.</p>  

<h2>Tips for storing and using double cream</h2>  
<p>Double cream should be refrigerated and used within a few days of opening. If you’ve measured out 25g but don’t need it all, store the rest in an airtight container. Double cream can also be frozen, though it may separate slightly when thawed—best used in cooked dishes rather than whipped applications.</p>  

<p>When adding double cream to air fryer recipes, room temperature cream blends more smoothly. For sauces, warm it slightly before mixing to prevent curdling. Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>cake recipes</a> for ideas on incorporating double cream into air-fried desserts.</p>

<p>205 C converts to approximately 180 C in a fan oven. This 25-degree reduction is standard when switching from conventional to fan-assisted cooking. Whether you're using an oven or an air fryer, understanding this conversion ensures perfectly cooked meals every time.</p>

<h2>Why Convert 205 C to Fan Oven?</h2>
<p>Fan ovens circulate hot air more efficiently than conventional ovens, requiring lower temperatures. When a recipe calls for 205 C, it's typically designed for traditional ovens. The fan setting distributes heat evenly, meaning you can achieve the same results at 180 C. This principle applies whether you're baking cakes or roasting vegetables in your air fryer.</p>
<p>At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we recommend always checking conversions when using fan-assisted appliances. Many modern recipes now include both temperature settings, but older cookbooks often need adjustment. The 205 C to fan oven conversion is particularly common for baking recipes like Victoria sponge or shortbread biscuits.</p>

<h2>Air Fryer Equivalent for 205 C</h2>
<p>Air fryers essentially work like compact fan ovens, making the 205 C to fan oven conversion directly applicable. If your air fryer recipe calls for 205 C, you'll typically set it to 180 C instead. This ensures your food cooks evenly without burning the exterior.</p>
<p>For specific air fryer dishes, check our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a> to adjust cooking times accordingly. Chicken wings, for instance, might need 20 minutes at 180 C fan instead of 25 minutes at 205 C conventional. The circulating air in both fan ovens and air fryers speeds up cooking while maintaining moisture.</p>

<h3>Baking at 205 C in Fan Oven</h3>
<p>When baking at 205 C fan equivalent (180 C), you'll notice more even browning. Cakes rise uniformly without the dome effect common in conventional ovens. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>cake recipes</a> specifically account for this temperature difference to deliver perfect results every time.</p>

<h2>Common 205 C Fan Oven Conversions</h2>
<p>Here are typical dishes requiring 205 C to fan oven conversion:</p>
<ul>
<li>Roast potatoes: 180 C fan for crispier results</li>
<li>Puff pastry: 180 C fan prevents uneven rising</li>
<li>Cookies: 180 C fan for even browning</li>
<li>Chicken breasts: 180 C fan retains juiciness</li>
</ul>
<p>Remember that cooking times may vary slightly when using the 205 C fan oven equivalent. Always check food 5-10 minutes before the recipe suggests. For more timing tips, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a> with adjusted fan oven settings.</p>

<h3>Temperature Accuracy Matters</h3>
<p>Oven thermostats can vary, so we recommend using an independent thermometer. What displays as 180 C fan might actually be 170 C or 190 C. Regular calibration ensures your 205 C to fan oven conversions remain accurate for consistent cooking.</p>

<h2>Energy Saving Benefits</h2>
<p>Using the 205 C to fan oven conversion (180 C) saves approximately 20% energy. The lower temperature combined with efficient air circulation cooks food faster while using less electricity. This makes fan ovens and air fryers more economical for everyday cooking.</p>
<p>When using your air fryer at the 205 C equivalent, you'll notice further energy savings. The compact size means less space to heat, perfect for smaller portions.

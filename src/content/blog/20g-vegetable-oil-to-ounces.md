<p>20g of vegetable oil equals approximately 0.7 ounces. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes, where precise measurements can make or break your dish. Whether you're frying, roasting, or baking, knowing how to convert grams to ounces ensures consistent results. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we help you master these conversions for flawless cooking.</p>

<h2>Why Convert 20g of Vegetable Oil to Ounces?</h2>
<p>Many air fryer recipes, especially those from the UK, use metric measurements like grams. However, some kitchen scales or recipes might require ounces. Converting 20g of vegetable oil to ounces (0.7 oz) ensures you use the right amount for crispy, evenly cooked food. This is particularly important for recipes like air-fried chicken or roasted vegetables, where oil quantity affects texture and taste.</p>
<p>Using too much oil can make food greasy, while too little may leave it dry. For perfect results, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for other common measurements. It’s a handy tool for any home cook looking to streamline their meal prep.</p>

<h2>How to Measure 20g of Vegetable Oil Accurately</h2>
<p>If your kitchen scale measures in ounces, you’ll need to set it to 0.7 oz for 20g of vegetable oil. Alternatively, you can use measuring spoons: 20g is roughly 1.5 tablespoons. For best results, use a digital scale for precision, especially when preparing delicate dishes like air-fried desserts or crispy tofu.</p>
<p>Struggling with conversions? Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a> includes both metric and imperial measurements, so you’ll never have to guess. From breakfast to dinner, we’ve got you covered with easy-to-follow instructions.</p>

<h3>Common Uses for 20g of Vegetable Oil in Air Fryers</h3>
<p>20g of vegetable oil is often used to coat ingredients before air frying. For example, it’s perfect for tossing potato wedges or chicken wings to ensure they crisp up nicely. You can also use it to grease the air fryer basket, preventing sticking without overdoing it.</p>

<h3>Does the Type of Vegetable Oil Affect the Conversion?</h3>
<p>No, the type of vegetable oil doesn’t change the conversion from grams to ounces. Whether you’re using sunflower, rapeseed, or olive oil, 20g will always be 0.7 oz. However, different oils have varying smoke points, which can impact cooking results. For high-heat air frying, opt for oils with a high smoke point like sunflower or avocado oil.</p>

<h2>Tips for Using Vegetable Oil in Your Air Fryer</h2>
<p>When using 20g of vegetable oil in your air fryer, spread it evenly over your ingredients for uniform crispiness. Avoid pouring oil directly into the air fryer basket, as this can cause smoking or uneven cooking. Instead, toss your food in a bowl with the oil before adding it to the basket.</p>
<p>For healthier alternatives, consider using an oil spray to lightly coat food. This method uses less oil while still achieving great texture. Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable recipes</a> for inspiration on making the most of your air fryer with minimal oil.</p>

<h3>Cleaning Your Air Fryer After Using Oil</h3>
<p>After cooking with vegetable oil, it’s important to clean your air fryer properly to prevent buildup. Use warm, soapy water and a non-abrasive sponge to wipe down the basket and tray.

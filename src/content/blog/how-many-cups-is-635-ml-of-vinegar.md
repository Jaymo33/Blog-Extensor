<p>635 ml of vinegar is approximately 2.68 cups in the US measurement system and 2.23 cups in the UK measurement system. Whether you're preparing a tangy marinade for air-fried chicken or whipping up a homemade cleaner for your air fryer, accurate measurements matter. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we help simplify conversions so your recipes turn out perfectly every time.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Vinegar Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of vinegar ensures balanced flavours in dishes like air-fried pickles or tangy glazes. Too much can overpower, while too little may leave your dish lacking acidity. For cleaning your air fryer, precise vinegar measurements help maintain effectiveness without residue. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner guide</a> for vinegar-based solutions that keep your appliance sparkling.</p>  

<p>Vinegar is also a key ingredient in marinades, such as those for air-fried tofu or vegetables. A slight miscalculation can alter texture and taste. Whether you're following a recipe from our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipes section</a> or experimenting, knowing how many cups 635 ml of vinegar equals ensures consistency.</p>  

<h3>US vs. UK Cup Measurements</h3>  
<p>The difference between US and UK cups affects conversions. A US cup holds 240 ml, while a UK cup is 284 ml. This means 635 ml converts to roughly 2.68 US cups or 2.23 UK cups. For air fryer recipes, always check which measurement system your recipe uses to avoid errors.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for 635 ml of Vinegar in Air Frying</h2>  
<p>From marinades to cleaning, vinegar plays multiple roles in air fryer cooking. A 635 ml bottle is handy for batch-prepping sauces or disinfecting your appliance. Try our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipes</a>, where vinegar-based brines keep meat juicy and flavourful.</p>  

<p>For crispy air-fried potatoes, a vinegar soak before cooking can enhance texture. Similarly, a vinegar-water solution helps remove stubborn grease from air fryer baskets. With 635 ml of vinegar, you’re equipped for both cooking and maintenance tasks.</p>  

<h3>Converting Other Vinegar Quantities</h3>  
<p>Need to adjust a recipe? Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> simplifies scaling measurements. Whether you’re halving a recipe or doubling a marinade, knowing how 635 ml of vinegar translates to cups ensures accuracy.</p>

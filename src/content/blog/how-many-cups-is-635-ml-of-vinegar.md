<p>635 ml of vinegar is approximately 2.68 cups in the US measurement system and 2.23 cups in the UK measurement system. Whether you're preparing a tangy marinade for air-fried chicken or whipping up a homemade cleaner for your air fryer, accurate measurements matter.

<h2>Why Accurate Vinegar Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of vinegar ensures balanced flavours in dishes like air-fried pickles or tangy glazes. Too much can overpower, while too little may leave your dish lacking acidity.

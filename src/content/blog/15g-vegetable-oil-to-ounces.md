<h2>Why Convert 15g of Vegetable Oil to Ounces?</h2>  
<p>Many air fryer recipes, especially those from the UK, use grams as the standard measurement. However, some kitchen scales or recipes might require ounces. Converting 15g of vegetable oil to ounces (0.53 oz) helps maintain consistency. This is particularly useful when following international recipes or using older cookbooks that list ingredients in ounces.</p>  

<p>Precision matters in air frying because too much or too little oil can affect texture and crispiness. For example, a <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>classic air fryer chicken recipe</a> might call for 15g of vegetable oil to achieve that golden crunch. Knowing the exact ounce equivalent ensures you don’t over or under-oil your ingredients.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure 15g of Vegetable Oil Accurately</h3>  
<p>If your kitchen scale only measures in ounces, you’ll need to know that 15g of vegetable oil is roughly 0.53 oz. Use a digital scale for the most accurate results, or refer to a <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>handy conversion chart</a>. Liquid measuring cups with ounce markings can also help, though weighing is always more precise.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for 15g of Vegetable Oil in Air Fryers</h2>

<h3>Tips for Measuring Small Amounts of Oil</h3>  
<p>When working with small quantities like 15g of vegetable oil, a syringe or small measuring spoon can be helpful. Alternatively, use a kitchen scale with a tare function to zero out the weight of your container. This ensures you’re only measuring the oil itself, not the bowl or bottle.</p>

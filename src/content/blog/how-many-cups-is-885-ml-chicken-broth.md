Whether you're making soups, stews, or sauces, knowing how to convert millilitres to cups ensures your dish turns out perfectly every time.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Precision is key when cooking with an air fryer, as too much or too little liquid can affect texture and cooking times. For example, adding 885 ml of chicken broth to a recipe without converting it correctly could throw off the balance. Air fryers circulate hot air rapidly, so proper measurements ensure even cooking and prevent soggy or dry results.</p>

This is especially useful for dishes like air-fried casseroles or braised meats where broth is a key ingredient.</p>

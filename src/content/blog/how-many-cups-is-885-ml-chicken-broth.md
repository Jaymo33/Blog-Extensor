<p>885 ml of chicken broth equals approximately 3.74 cups. This conversion is essential for recipes requiring precise liquid measurements, especially when using an air fryer. Whether you're making soups, stews, or sauces, knowing how to convert millilitres to cups ensures your dish turns out perfectly every time.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Precision is key when cooking with an air fryer, as too much or too little liquid can affect texture and cooking times. For example, adding 885 ml of chicken broth to a recipe without converting it correctly could throw off the balance. Air fryers circulate hot air rapidly, so proper measurements ensure even cooking and prevent soggy or dry results.</p>  
<p>If you're following a recipe from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, you'll often find measurements in millilitres or cups. Converting 885 ml of chicken broth to cups (3.74 cups) helps maintain consistency. This is especially useful for dishes like air-fried casseroles or braised meats where broth is a key ingredient.</p>  

<h2>How to Measure 885 ml of Chicken Broth Without a Scale</h2>  
<p>Not everyone has a kitchen scale, but you can still measure 885 ml of chicken broth accurately using standard cups. A US cup holds 240 ml, while a UK cup is slightly larger at 250 ml. For 885 ml, you'd need roughly 3.7 US cups or 3.54 UK cups. If precision isn’t critical, rounding to 3.75 cups works fine.</p>  
<p>For air fryer recipes, slight variations may not matter, but for baking or reductions, exact measurements are best. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more handy measurement tips. It’s a lifesaver when adapting recipes for your air fryer.</p>  

<h3>Common Recipes Using 885 ml of Chicken Broth</h3>  
<p>Many dishes call for around 885 ml of chicken broth, such as risottos, gravies, or poached chicken. In an air fryer, you might use this amount for a flavourful base in a one-pot meal. For example, try our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipes</a> that use broth for added moisture and taste.</p>  

<h2>Converting Other Liquid Measurements for Air Fryer Recipes</h2>  
<p>Beyond chicken broth, you might need to convert oils, stocks, or sauces for air fryer cooking. For instance, 885 ml of vegetable stock also equals 3.74 cups. Keeping a conversion cheat sheet handy simplifies meal prep and ensures your air fryer dishes turn out perfectly every time.</p>  
<p>If you're cleaning your air fryer after cooking with broth, check out our guide on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner</a> to keep it in top shape. Proper maintenance ensures your appliance lasts longer and performs at its best.</p>  

<h3>Tips for Adjusting Recipes with 885 ml of Chicken Broth</h3>  
<p>If a recipe calls for 885 ml of chicken broth but you only have cups, remember the 3.74-cup equivalent. For thicker sauces, you might reduce the broth slightly, while soups may need the full amount. Always taste and adjust seasonings, as broth saltiness varies by brand.</p>

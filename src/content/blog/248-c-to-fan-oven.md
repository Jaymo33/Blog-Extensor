<p>248°C in a fan oven is equivalent to approximately 220°C on the fan setting. This conversion is essential for precise baking and roasting, especially when using modern ovens or air fryers. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we know how crucial accurate temperatures are for perfect results.</p>

<h2>Why Convert 248 C to Fan Oven?</h2>
<p>Fan ovens circulate hot air, cooking food faster and more evenly than conventional ovens. Reducing the temperature by 20-30°C compensates for this efficiency. For example, 248°C converts to 220°C in a fan oven. This adjustment ensures your dishes don’t overcook or dry out.</p>
<p>Air fryers work similarly to fan ovens, using rapid air circulation. If a recipe calls for 248°C in a conventional oven, you’d typically set your air fryer to 220°C. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> makes these adjustments effortless.</p>

<h2>How to Use 248 C in Fan Oven Cooking</h2>
<p>When baking at 248°C (220°C fan), monitor your food closely. Cakes, cookies, and pastries benefit from this high heat for a golden finish. For meats, sear at 248°C first, then reduce the temperature for even cooking.</p>
<p>In an air fryer, 220°C is ideal for crispy <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken</a> or roasted vegetables. Preheat your air fryer for 3-5 minutes to ensure consistent results. Always check food 5-10 minutes earlier than the recipe suggests.</p>

<h3>248 C Fan Oven for Specific Dishes</h3>
<p>For <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>cakes</a>, 220°C (fan) gives a perfect rise without burning. Roast potatoes at this temperature for crisp exteriors and fluffy interiors. Adjust cooking times based on your oven’s performance.</p>

<h2>Air Fryer Equivalent for 248 C</h2>
<p>Most air fryers recommend setting the temperature 20-30°C lower than conventional ovens. So 248°C becomes 220°C in an air fryer. This prevents overcooking while maintaining crispiness. Always refer to your appliance’s manual for specific guidance.</p>

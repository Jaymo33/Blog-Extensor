<h2>Tips for working with molasses in the air fryer</h2>  
<p>Molasses can burn quickly under high heat, so always monitor cooking times. For glazes, brush them on in the last few minutes to avoid charring.

<p>Storing molasses properly ensures it stays fresh for future recipes. Keep it in a cool, dark place, and always seal the jar tightly. If it crystallises, gently warming the jar in hot water restores its smooth texture. This way, your 0.75 tbsp (15g) measurements will always be spot-on.</p>

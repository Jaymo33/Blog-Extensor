This measurement can vary slightly depending on how finely the broccoli is cut, but it’s a reliable starting point for air fryer recipes. Whether you’re whipping up a quick side dish or adding broccoli to a larger meal, knowing this conversion ensures consistent results every time.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Getting the right amount of broccoli is crucial for even cooking in your air fryer. Too much can lead to steaming instead of crisping, while too little might burn.

<h3>How to Measure 75 Grams of Broccoli Without a Scale</h3>  
<p>No kitchen scale? No problem! A standard measuring cup can help you estimate 75 grams of broccoli. Lightly pack the chopped florets into the cup, filling it just below the rim. Avoid pressing down too hard, as this can compact the broccoli and throw off the measurement. For best results, fluff the broccoli with a fork before measuring.</p>  

<h2>Using 75 Grams of Broccoli in Air Fryer Recipes</h2>  
<p>Broccoli is a versatile veggie that shines in the air fryer. From crispy snacks to hearty sides, 75 grams (or 1.5 cups) is a great portion for single servings. Try tossing it with olive oil, garlic, and a pinch of salt for a simple yet delicious dish.

<p>If you’re meal prepping, 75 grams of broccoli per portion ensures even cooking and easy serving. Pair it with proteins like chicken or tofu for a balanced meal. For a flavour boost, sprinkle with parmesan or chilli flakes before air frying. The possibilities are endless with this nutrient-packed veggie!</p>  

<h3>Fresh vs. Frozen Broccoli: Does It Affect the Measurement?</h3>  
<p>Fresh and frozen broccoli can be used interchangeably in most recipes, but there’s a slight difference in volume. Frozen broccoli tends to be more compact, so 75 grams might look like slightly less than 1.5 cups. Thaw and drain it well before measuring to avoid excess moisture, which can affect crispiness in the air fryer.</p>  

<h2>Common Mistakes When Measuring Broccoli for the Air Fryer</h2>  
<p>Overcrowding the air fryer basket is a common pitfall. Even if you’ve measured 75 grams correctly, piling it too high can lead to uneven cooking. Spread the broccoli in a single layer for the best results. Another mistake? Skipping the oil—just a light coating helps achieve that perfect crisp.</p>

<h3>Adjusting Cooking Times for 75 Grams of Broccoli</h3>  
<p>Since 75 grams is a modest portion, cooking time is usually around 8–10 minutes at 180°C. Shake the basket halfway through to ensure even browning. For larger batches, adjust the time accordingly, but avoid exceeding the air fryer’s capacity for optimal results.</p>

<h2>Why converting 75g of apple cider vinegar matters</h2>
<p>Accurate measurements are crucial in cooking, especially when using an air fryer. Too much or too little apple cider vinegar can throw off the balance of your recipe. For example, 75g of apple cider vinegar to ounces is a common conversion needed for marinades, sauces, and even pickling. Getting it right ensures your food has the perfect tang and flavour profile every time.</p>
<p>If you're following a recipe from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>our collection</a>, you'll often find measurements in grams or ounces. Knowing how to switch between the two means you'll never be stuck mid-recipe. Plus, it’s a great skill to have for experimenting with your own creations. Whether you're cooking chicken, vegetables, or even desserts, precision is key.</p>

<h2>How to measure 75g of apple cider vinegar</h2>
<p>Measuring liquids like apple cider vinegar can be tricky, but it’s simple with the right tools. A digital kitchen scale is the most accurate way to measure 75g of apple cider vinegar. Simply place your measuring cup on the scale, tare it to zero, and pour until you hit 75g. If you don’t have a scale, 75g is roughly 5 tablespoons or 2.65 ounces.</p>
<p>For those who prefer visual cues, 75g of apple cider vinegar fills about a third of a standard US cup. If you're using an air fryer for recipes like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>air-fried chicken</a>, this measurement ensures your marinade isn’t too acidic or too weak.

<h2>Tips for storing apple cider vinegar</h2>
<p>Once you’ve measured out your 75g of apple cider vinegar, proper storage ensures it stays fresh. Keep it in a cool, dark place, ideally in its original glass bottle with a tight lid. Exposure to light and heat can degrade its quality over time. If you use apple cider vinegar frequently in your air fryer recipes, consider buying in bulk and decanting smaller amounts for daily use.</p>

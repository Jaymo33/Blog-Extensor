<h2>Understanding Balsamic Vinegar Measurements</h2>

<p>If you're using an air fryer, precise measurements like these are crucial for marinades and glazes. Too much or too little balsamic vinegar can alter the flavour profile of your dish.

<h3>Why Accuracy Matters in Air Fryer Cooking</h3>
<p>Air fryers cook food quickly and evenly, but they rely on precise ingredient measurements for the best results. Balsamic vinegar, with its strong flavour, needs careful measuring. Whether you're making a glaze for chicken or a dressing for vegetables, 85 ml of balsamic vinegar should be measured accurately. A slight deviation can overpower or underwhelm your dish.</p>

<h2>Converting 85 ml of Balsamic Vinegar to Cups</h2>

<h2>Common Uses for 85 ml of Balsamic Vinegar</h2>
<p>85 ml of balsamic vinegar is often used in marinades, dressings, and glazes for air fryer dishes. Its tangy sweetness enhances meats, vegetables, and even desserts.

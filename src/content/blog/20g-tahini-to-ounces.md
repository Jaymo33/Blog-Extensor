<p>20g of tahini equals approximately 0.71 ounces. This conversion is handy for air fryer recipes where precise measurements matter, especially when working with rich, dense ingredients like tahini. Whether you’re making dips, dressings, or marinades, knowing how to convert grams to ounces ensures your dishes turn out perfectly every time. For more air fryer conversions, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate tahini measurements matter</h2>  
<p>Tahini is a key ingredient in many Middle Eastern and Mediterranean dishes, from hummus to baba ganoush. Using the right amount ensures the perfect texture and flavour balance. Too much tahini can overpower a dish, while too little might leave it lacking depth. For air fryer recipes, precise measurements help maintain consistency, especially when adapting traditional oven recipes. Explore more <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>tahini-based recipes</a> on our site.</p>  

<p>When converting 20g tahini to ounces, it’s worth noting that tahini’s thick, paste-like consistency means volume measurements (like tablespoons) can vary. Weight measurements (grams or ounces) are far more reliable. This is particularly important for air fryer cooking, where ingredient ratios affect cooking times and results. For more tips on measuring sticky ingredients, visit our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable recipe category</a>.</p>  

<h3>How to measure tahini without scales</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have digital scales, 20g of tahini is roughly 1 heaped tablespoon. However, tahini’s thickness means it’s easy to over or under-measure this way. For best results, lightly oil your spoon first to help the tahini slide off cleanly. This trick works wonders for air fryer sauces and marinades where precision matters.</p>  

<h2>Converting tahini for UK air fryer recipes</h2>  
<p>Many UK air fryer enthusiasts use grams, while some older recipes still list ounces. Knowing that 20g tahini equals 0.71 ounces helps bridge this gap. This conversion is especially useful when scaling recipes up or down for your air fryer’s capacity. Whether you’re making a tahini glaze for air-fried aubergine or a creamy dressing for salads, accurate measurements ensure success.</p>  

<p>For those who prefer imperial measurements, remember that 1 ounce equals approximately 28.35 grams. So 20g tahini to oz is just under three-quarters of an ounce. This small but mighty ingredient packs a flavour punch, so getting the measurement right makes all the difference.

<h3>Tahini storage tips for air fryer cooks</h3>  
<p>Properly stored tahini lasts longer and maintains its quality. After opening, stir well and keep refrigerated to prevent separation. If your tahini hardens, let it sit at room temperature before measuring out your 20g (0.71 oz) portion. Well-stored tahini ensures consistent results in all your air fryer creations, from crispy tofu to golden roasted veggies.</p>

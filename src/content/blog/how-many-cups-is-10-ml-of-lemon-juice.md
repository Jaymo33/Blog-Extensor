<h2>Understanding Lemon Juice Measurements</h2>  
<p>Lemon juice is often measured in millilitres (ml) or cups, depending on the recipe. For small quantities like 10 ml, using a measuring spoon or jug with clear markings is best.

Conversely, too little might leave your dish lacking flavour. Measuring 10 ml of lemon juice correctly ensures balanced acidity and moisture.

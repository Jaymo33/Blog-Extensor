<p>635 ml of buttermilk is approximately 2.68 cups. This conversion is essential for baking and cooking, especially when using an air fryer, where precise measurements can make or break a recipe. Whether you're whipping up pancakes, cakes, or marinades, knowing how to convert millilitres to cups ensures consistency in your dishes. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we focus on making conversions simple so you can focus on creating delicious meals.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>When working with buttermilk, accuracy is key. Too much or too little can affect the texture and rise of baked goods. For air fryer recipes, precise measurements ensure even cooking and perfect results. 635 ml of buttermilk is a common measurement in many recipes, particularly those adapted from European or metric-based sources. Converting it to cups helps streamline the process, especially if you're using American measuring tools.</p>  

<p>Buttermilk adds tanginess and moisture to dishes, making it a staple in everything from fried chicken to fluffy cakes. If you're exploring air fryer recipes, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipes section</a> for inspiration. Whether you're making buttermilk biscuits or marinating chicken, knowing how many cups 635 ml equals will save you time and hassle.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure Buttermilk Correctly</h3>  
<p>For the most accurate results, use a liquid measuring cup for your 635 ml of buttermilk. Fill it to the 2 and 2/3 cup mark, or measure 2 cups plus 2/3 of another cup. If you don’t have a measuring cup, a kitchen scale can also help—635 ml weighs roughly 652 grams. Avoid using dry measuring cups, as they can lead to inconsistencies.</p>  

<h2>Converting 635 ml of Buttermilk in Different Countries</h2>  
<p>In the UK, 635 ml of buttermilk is roughly 2.68 cups, but in the US, a cup is slightly different (240 ml vs. 250 ml). This small variation can matter in baking, so always double-check your recipe's origin. For air fryer cooking, slight adjustments might be needed based on your machine's capacity. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> can help you adapt recipes seamlessly.</p>  

<p>If you're working with a recipe that calls for 635 ml of buttermilk but only have cups, remember that 1 cup equals 237 ml (US) or 250 ml (UK). For 635 ml, you’d use about 2.68 US cups or 2.54 UK cups. This distinction ensures your air fryer dishes turn out just right, whether you're making crispy chicken or moist cakes.</p>  

<h3>Common Uses for 635 ml of Buttermilk</h3>  
<p>Buttermilk is versatile—635 ml can be used for marinating meats, making pancakes, or adding moisture to baked goods. In the air fryer, it’s perfect for creating crispy coatings or tenderising proteins. Try it in our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipes</a> for extra flavour and juiciness. Whether you're baking or frying, buttermilk’s acidity helps activate baking soda for lighter textures.</p>  

<h2>Tips for Storing Leftover Buttermilk</h2>  
<p>If your recipe doesn’t use all 635 ml of buttermilk, store the rest in an airtight container in the fridge for up to two weeks. You can also freeze it in ice cube trays for future use—just thaw before adding to recipes. For more kitchen hacks, visit <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>. Proper storage ensures you always have buttermilk ready for your next air fryer adventure.</p>  

<p>Buttermilk can also be substituted with a DIY version—mix 635 ml of milk with 2 tablespoons of lemon juice or vinegar. Let it sit for 5 minutes before using. This trick works well in a pinch, especially for air fryer recipes like buttermilk-battered fish or fluffy scones. Experiment with our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert recipes</a> to put your buttermilk to good use.</p>

<h2>Converting Cups to Millilitres</h2>  
<p>Understanding cup-to-millilitre conversions is essential for any home cook. In the UK and US, standard cup sizes differ slightly, but for vinegar, 1 cup is roughly 236.59 ml. Multiply that by 2.5, and you get 591.47 ml. This conversion is handy for scaling recipes or adjusting ingredient quantities.</p>

<h3>Common Uses for 2.5 Cups of Vinegar</h3>  
<p>From marinades to pickling solutions, 591.47 ml of vinegar is versatile. Try it in a tangy pulled pork recipe or a refreshing cucumber salad. Vinegar’s acidity also helps tenderise meats, making it a staple for air fryer cooking.</p>  

<h3>Measuring Without a Scale</h3>  
<p>No measuring jug? Use a standard mug (about 250 ml) and fill it just over twice for 2.5 cups. Alternatively, a litre bottle marked with millilitres makes it easy to eyeball 591.47 ml. Precision matters, especially when baking or making sauces.</p>

<p>Yes, you can put frozen vegetables in their bag into an air fryer, but it's not recommended due to potential melting and fire risks. The plastic packaging isn't designed for high heat exposure, which could lead to dangerous situations. For safe air frying, always transfer frozen veg to the air fryer basket or use oven-safe containers instead.</p>

<h2>Why Frozen Veg In Bags Poses Risks</h2>
<p>Air fryers circulate extremely hot air at temperatures often exceeding 200°C, which most plastic bags can't withstand. The thin plastic used for frozen vegetable packaging may melt onto heating elements or release harmful chemicals into your food. Some bags contain metalised layers for freezer protection that could spark against air fryer components.</p>
<p>Manufacturers design these bags for freezer-to-boiling water transitions, not dry heat environments. When plastic melts in an air fryer, it can create smoke, unpleasant odours, and potentially damage your appliance.

<h2>Safe Alternatives For Air Frying Frozen Veg</h2>
<p>Instead of using the original packaging, simply empty frozen vegetables directly into your air fryer basket. Most frozen veg requires no oil thanks to its natural moisture content when thawing during cooking. For smaller pieces that might fall through the basket, consider using <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-liners>air fryer liners</a> or a compatible oven-safe dish.</p>
<p>Popular frozen vegetables like peas, carrots and broccoli cook beautifully in air fryers when spread evenly in a single layer. The circulating hot air creates perfect texture - crispy edges with tender centres.

<h3>Special Considerations For Different Brands</h3>
<p>Some air fryer models like Ninja Dual Zone or Instant Vortex handle frozen vegetables differently due to their heating mechanisms. Always consult your specific model's manual for frozen food guidelines. Most manufacturers explicitly warn against cooking food in plastic packaging.</p>

<h2>Step-by-Step Guide To Air Frying Frozen Vegetables</h2>
<p>Start by preheating your air fryer to 190°C for about 3 minutes to ensure even cooking. Measure your frozen vegetables - typically 200-300g serves 2-3 people nicely. Spread them evenly in the basket, shaking halfway through cooking for uniform crispness.</p>
<p>Most mixed frozen vegetables take 10-12 minutes at 190°C, but denser varieties like Brussels sprouts may need 15 minutes. For recipe inspiration, browse our collection at <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes</a>.</p>

<h3>Seasoning And Serving Suggestions</h3>
<p>While frozen vegetables contain natural flavours, a light seasoning enhances their taste. Try garlic powder, smoked paprika or a drizzle of olive oil after cooking.

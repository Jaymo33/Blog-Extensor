<p>Always shake or turn food halfway through cooking at 397 F for even results. Use a light spray of oil to enhance crispiness without making food greasy.

Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/frozen-foods>frozen food recipes</a> for specific timing guidance.</p>
<p>Consider using parchment liners or perforated pans when cooking at 397 F in your air fryer. These help with cleanup and prevent smaller items from falling through the basket. Remember that cooking times may vary slightly between different air fryer models. Always check food a few minutes before the recommended time, especially when trying new recipes at this temperature setting.</p>

<p>500 grams of granulated sugar equals approximately 2.5 cups in the UK and 2.4 cups in the US. Getting this conversion right is essential for baking, especially when using an air fryer where precise measurements can affect texture and cooking times. Whether you're making cakes, cookies, or desserts, knowing how to convert grams to cups ensures consistent results every time.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Sugar Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Granulated sugar plays a crucial role in baking, affecting texture, sweetness, and browning. Too much or too little can throw off your recipe, especially in an air fryer where heat distribution is rapid. For example, if you're making air fryer cookies from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>our recipe collection</a>, precise sugar amounts ensure the perfect chewiness and spread. Measuring by weight (grams) is more reliable than volume (cups), but if you don’t have a scale, knowing the conversion is a lifesaver.</p>  

<p>Different countries use different cup sizes, which can cause confusion. The UK cup measures 250ml, while the US cup is slightly smaller at 240ml. This small difference adds up when scaling recipes, so always check which standard your recipe follows. If you're unsure, refer to our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for quick reference.</p>  

<h3>UK vs. US Cup Measurements</h3>  
<p>In the UK, 500 grams of granulated sugar equals roughly 2.5 cups (using the 250ml standard). In the US, it’s closer to 2.4 cups (using the 240ml standard). This difference might seem minor, but for delicate bakes like air fryer sponge cakes, precision matters. Always check the origin of your recipe—many online sources default to US measurements unless specified otherwise.</p>  

<h2>How to Measure Granulated Sugar Without a Scale</h2>  
<p>If you don’t have a kitchen scale, use the spoon-and-level method for accuracy. Scoop sugar into your measuring cup with a spoon, then level it off with a straight edge. Avoid packing the sugar down, as this can lead to over-measuring. For air fryer recipes like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>our cake category</a>, even small measurement errors can affect rise and texture.</p>  

<p>Another tip is to fluff the sugar in its container before measuring. Granulated sugar can settle over time, making it denser. Fluffing ensures a lighter, more consistent measure. If you’re converting larger quantities, like 1kg of sugar, double the cup measurements accordingly—5 cups in the UK or 4.8 cups in the US.</p>  

<h3>Common Baking Conversions</h3>  
<p>Beyond sugar, many baking ingredients require precise conversions. For example, 500 grams of flour equals about 4 cups in the UK and 3.75 cups in the US. Butter is simpler—500 grams is roughly 2 cups (or 4 sticks) in both systems. Bookmark our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a> for quick access to these measurements.</p>  

<h2>Adjusting Recipes for Air Fryer Baking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers cook faster and hotter than conventional ovens, so small measurement errors can amplify. If your 500 grams of granulated sugar is slightly off, your air fryer brownies might bake unevenly or become too dense. Always measure carefully, and consider reducing sugar slightly for recipes with strong sweeteners like honey or syrup.</p>  

<p>For sticky ingredients, lightly grease your measuring cups or use a <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>non-stick air fryer liner</a> to prevent mess. Cleaning granulated sugar residue from your air fryer basket is easier when you line it first. If you’re experimenting with new recipes, start with small batches to test measurements before scaling up.</p>  

<h3>Storing Granulated Sugar</h3>  
<p>Keep granulated sugar in an airtight container to prevent clumping, especially in humid climates. Proper storage ensures consistent measurements every time. If your sugar hardens, break it up with a fork before measuring for accuracy.</p>

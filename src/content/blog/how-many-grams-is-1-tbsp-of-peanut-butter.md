<p>One tablespoon (1 tbsp) of peanut butter weighs approximately 16 grams, though this can vary slightly depending on the brand and consistency. Whether you're whipping up a quick snack or a full meal in your air fryer, accurate measurements ensure perfect results every time. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we know that precision matters, especially when converting between volume and weight for ingredients like peanut butter.</p>  

<h2>Why Peanut Butter Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Peanut butter is a versatile ingredient used in everything from sauces to desserts, and getting the measurement right can make or break a recipe. Too much peanut butter can make dishes overly dense, while too little might leave them lacking flavour. For air fryer recipes, where even cooking is key, precise measurements help avoid undercooked or burnt results. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for other common ingredient conversions.</p>  

<p>Different brands of peanut butter can vary in density, especially between smooth and crunchy varieties. Smooth peanut butter tends to be slightly denser, while crunchy peanut butter may weigh a gram or two less per tablespoon due to air gaps. If you're following a recipe from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>our collection</a>, always measure by weight for the best accuracy.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure Peanut Butter Accurately</h3>  
<p>For the most precise measurement, use a digital kitchen scale to weigh your peanut butter directly in grams. If you don't have a scale, lightly pack the peanut butter into a tablespoon without pressing too hard, then level it off with a knife. This method gives you the closest approximation to 16 grams per tablespoon. Avoid heaping tablespoons, as this can add up to 20 grams or more.</p>  

<h2>Converting Peanut Butter for Air Fryer Recipes</h2>  
<p>Many air fryer recipes, especially those for cookies or energy bites, call for peanut butter measured in grams rather than tablespoons. If your recipe lists peanut butter in tablespoons but you prefer weighing it, remember that 1 tbsp equals roughly 16 grams. For larger quantities, 100 grams of peanut butter is about 6.25 tablespoons. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert recipes</a> often use these conversions for perfect texture.</p>  

<p>When substituting peanut butter in recipes, keep in mind that natural peanut butter (without added oils or sugars) may behave differently in cooking. If you're adapting a recipe from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, check whether it specifies natural or processed peanut butter, as this can affect both weight and cooking performance.</p>  

<h3>Common Peanut Butter Measurements in Grams</h3>  
<p>Here's a quick reference for converting peanut butter between tablespoons and grams: 1 tbsp = 16g, 2 tbsp = 32g, 3 tbsp = 48g, and so on. For half measurements, Â½ tbsp equals about 8 grams. These conversions are particularly useful when scaling recipes up or down for your air fryer.

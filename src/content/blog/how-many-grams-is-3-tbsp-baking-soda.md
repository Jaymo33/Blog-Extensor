<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer baking</h2>  
<p>Baking soda is a leavening agent, and even small deviations can affect your recipe’s outcome. Too much can leave a bitter taste, while too little may result in dense baked goods. Air fryers circulate hot air, so precise measurements ensure even cooking. If you’re experimenting with <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>new recipes</a>, always measure carefully. A digital kitchen scale is the best tool for accuracy.</p>  

<p>Many UK bakers prefer grams over tablespoons for consistency. Scooping baking soda directly from the container can lead to varying amounts due to packing. Levelling off your tablespoons helps, but weighing eliminates guesswork. For perfectly fluffy <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>air fryer cakes</a>, stick to the 42-gram mark for 3 tbsp.</p>  

<h3>How to measure 3 tbsp baking soda without a scale</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a scale, use the spoon-and-level method. Gently spoon baking soda into the tablespoon without packing it down, then level with a knife. Three level tablespoons should give you close to 42 grams. For more tips on air fryer baking, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert recipes</a>.</p>

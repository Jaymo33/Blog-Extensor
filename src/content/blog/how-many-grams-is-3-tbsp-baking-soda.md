<p>3 tablespoons of baking soda equals approximately 42 grams. This conversion is essential for precise baking, especially when using an air fryer where measurements can impact texture and rise. Whether you’re whipping up cakes or cleaning your appliance, knowing the exact weight ensures consistency. For more air fryer conversions, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>handy conversion chart</a>.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer baking</h2>  
<p>Baking soda is a leavening agent, and even small deviations can affect your recipe’s outcome. Too much can leave a bitter taste, while too little may result in dense baked goods. Air fryers circulate hot air, so precise measurements ensure even cooking. If you’re experimenting with <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>new recipes</a>, always measure carefully. A digital kitchen scale is the best tool for accuracy.</p>  

<p>Many UK bakers prefer grams over tablespoons for consistency. Scooping baking soda directly from the container can lead to varying amounts due to packing. Levelling off your tablespoons helps, but weighing eliminates guesswork. For perfectly fluffy <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>air fryer cakes</a>, stick to the 42-gram mark for 3 tbsp.</p>  

<h3>How to measure 3 tbsp baking soda without a scale</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a scale, use the spoon-and-level method. Gently spoon baking soda into the tablespoon without packing it down, then level with a knife. Three level tablespoons should give you close to 42 grams. For more tips on air fryer baking, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert recipes</a>.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for baking soda in air fryers</h2>  
<p>Beyond baking, baking soda is a powerhouse for cleaning your air fryer. A paste made with 3 tbsp (42g) of baking soda and water can tackle grease and odours. Check out our guide on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaning</a> for more hacks. It’s also great for deodorising the basket between uses.</p>  

<p>Some savoury recipes, like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>air fryer chicken wings</a>, use a pinch of baking soda for crispier skin. Always measure carefully to avoid altering flavours. Whether for cooking or maintenance, knowing your conversions is a game-changer.</p>  

<h3>Converting other baking soda amounts</h3>  
<p>Need smaller or larger quantities? One tablespoon of baking soda is roughly 14 grams, while a teaspoon is about 5 grams.

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>

<p>Broccoli's density can vary slightly depending on how finely it's chopped, but 68 grams is a reliable average. For best results, use a kitchen scale rather than relying solely on cup measurements. This precision is key for dishes like air-fried broccoli with parmesan or garlic roasted broccoli.</p>

<h3>Converting Cups to Grams for Different Broccoli Cuts</h3>
<p>If your broccoli is chopped finely, 0.75 cups may weigh slightly less than 68 grams due to increased air pockets. For larger florets, the weight might be slightly higher. Always adjust cooking times by 1-2 minutes if your measurement varies.

This method gives you roughly 68 grams, though a scale is more accurate. For perfectly cooked broccoli every time, consider investing in an affordable digital scale - it's a game-changer for air fryer cooking.</p>

<h2>Storing and Prepping Broccoli for Air Frying</h2>
<p>To save time, measure out several 0.75 cup (68g) portions of broccoli and store them in airtight containers in the fridge. Pre-measured portions make it easy to throw together quick air fryer meals. Always wash and thoroughly dry your broccoli before measuring to ensure accuracy.</p>

<p id="">The first air fryer as we know it today was invented in 2010 by Philips, marking a revolution in home cooking technology. While the concept of rapid air cooking existed earlier, Philips perfected the compact countertop version that made air frying accessible to home cooks. Their original model, the Philips Airfryer, introduced the world to healthier fried foods using little to no oil.</p><h2 id="">The origins of air fryer technology</h2><p id="">Before Philips launched their game-changing appliance, the principles behind air frying were already being used in industrial kitchens. Convection ovens had been circulating hot air around food since the 1940s, but these were large, expensive units. The real innovation came when engineers miniaturised this technology into a convenient home appliance. If you're curious about adapting recipes for your air fryer, check out our handy <a href="https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart" id="">air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p><p id="">The question of how long have air fryers been around depends on whether we're talking about the concept or the modern appliance. Commercial air circulation cooking systems predate home units by several decades. However, the compact countertop air fryer only became widely available in the last 15 years. For delicious ways to use your appliance, browse our collection of <a href="https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes" id="">air fryer recipes</a> perfect for any model.</p><h2 id="">Who invented the air fryer?</h2><p id="">The specific inventor of the first air fryer isn't widely documented, as it was developed by a team at Philips in the Netherlands. Their breakthrough was creating a small, efficient device that could circulate superheated air at high speed. This innovation answered the question of when did air fryers come out with a definitive 2010 launch date. The original Philips model could cook frozen chips using just a tablespoon of oil - revolutionary at the time.</p><h3 id="">The evolution of air fryer designs</h3><p id="">Early air fryers had a single basket design with basic temperature controls. Today's models offer multiple cooking functions, digital displays, and even smart features. That first air fryer from Philips sparked an entire industry, with competitors soon introducing their own versions. Keeping your appliance in top condition is easy with our guide to <a href="https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner" id="">air fryer cleaning</a>.</p><h2 id="">When air fryers became mainstream</h2><p id="">While the first air fryer appeared in 2010, it took several years for them to gain widespread popularity. The turning point came around 2017 when health-conscious cooking trends aligned perfectly with air frying benefits. Suddenly, everyone wanted to know how long have air fryers been around and whether they lived up to the hype. The answer became clear as sales skyrocketed and kitchen enthusiasts embraced this new way of cooking.</p><p id="">Today, it's hard to imagine kitchens without an air fryer, but that first model paved the way. From crispy <a href="https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/potatoes" id="">potato recipes</a> to perfect <a href="https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken" id="">chicken dishes</a>, these appliances have transformed home cooking. That original Philips air fryer started a revolution that continues to evolve with new features and capabilities being added each year.</p>

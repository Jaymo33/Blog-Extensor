<h2>Why Convert 40g of Butter to Ounces?</h2>  
<p>Many UK recipes use grams, while others rely on ounces, making conversions a common kitchen task. If you’re using an air fryer, precise measurements like 40g of butter to ounces can affect texture and flavour. For example, too much butter might make your dish greasy, while too little could leave it dry. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> simplifies these calculations, so you never have to guess.</p>  

<p>Converting 40g of butter to ounces is straightforward with the right tools. A digital kitchen scale is ideal, but if you don’t have one, knowing that 40g equals roughly 1.41 ounces helps. This measurement is particularly useful for baking, where precision matters.

<h2>How to Measure 40g of Butter Without a Scale</h2>  
<p>If you don’t have a scale, you can still measure 40g of butter using tablespoons. One tablespoon of butter weighs about 14g, so 40g is roughly 2.8 tablespoons. This method isn’t as precise as weighing, but it works in a pinch. For air fryer cooking, where even small deviations can affect results, we recommend investing in a scale for accuracy.</p>  

<h3>Using 40g of Butter in Air Fryer Recipes</h3>  
<p>Butter adds richness to air fryer dishes, from crispy potatoes to golden cakes. When a recipe calls for 40g of butter, knowing it’s 1.41 ounces ensures you get the right consistency.

<h2>Common Mistakes When Measuring Butter</h2>  
<p>One mistake people make is using cold butter straight from the fridge, which is harder to measure accurately. For best results, let butter soften slightly before measuring 40g. Another error is packing butter into a measuring cup, which can lead to over-measuring. Instead, use the spoon-and-level method for tablespoons or weigh it directly.

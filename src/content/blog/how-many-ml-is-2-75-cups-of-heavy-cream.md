<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>

<p>Heavy cream is often used in air fryer desserts like cheesecakes or custards, where consistency is key. A slight mismeasurement can affect texture and cooking time. If you're new to air fryer baking, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipes section</a> has plenty of inspiration to get started.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure Heavy Cream Correctly</h3>  
<p>For the most accurate conversion, use a liquid measuring cup for 2.75 cups of heavy cream before converting to millilitres. Scooping directly with a dry cup can lead to inconsistencies. If you don’t have a measuring jug, weigh the cream—1 ml of heavy cream weighs roughly 1 gram.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for 2.75 Cups of Heavy Cream in Air Fryer Recipes</h2>  
<p>This quantity is perfect for creamy pasta sauces, rich desserts, or even homemade ice cream in the air fryer. Many <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert recipes</a> call for this amount to achieve the ideal consistency. You can also use it to make whipped cream for topping air-fried pancakes or waffles.</p>  

<p>Heavy cream adds richness to savoury dishes too, like creamy garlic mushrooms or indulgent mashed potatoes. For a full list of ideas, browse our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable recipes</a> that pair well with creamy sauces.</p>  

<h3>Converting Other Cream Measurements</h3>  
<p>If your recipe calls for a different amount, remember that 1 cup of heavy cream equals about 240 ml. This makes scaling recipes up or down straightforward. Always double-check conversions to avoid mistakes, especially when adapting traditional oven recipes for the air fryer.</p>  

<h2>Tips for Storing Leftover Heavy Cream</h2>  
<p>If you don’t use all 650 ml at once, store the remaining heavy cream in an airtight container in the fridge. It typically lasts 3–5 days, but check for souring before reuse. For longer storage, freeze it in ice cube trays—thawed cream works well in cooked dishes.</p>  

<p>Keeping your air fryer clean is just as important as accurate measurements. Leftover cream can splatter, so check out our guide on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaning</a> to maintain your appliance.</p>  

<h3>Substitutes for Heavy Cream in Air Fryer Recipes</h3>  
<p>If you’re out of heavy cream, try evaporated milk mixed with butter or full-fat coconut milk for a dairy-free option. These swaps may slightly alter texture but work in most recipes. Always adjust cooking times in the air fryer when using substitutes.</p>

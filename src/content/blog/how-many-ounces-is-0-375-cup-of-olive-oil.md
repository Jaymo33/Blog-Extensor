<p>0.375 cup of olive oil equals 3 ounces, making it easy to measure for your air fryer recipes. Whether you're preparing crispy vegetables or marinating chicken, accurate measurements ensure consistent results. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we know precise conversions help you cook like a pro.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate olive oil measurements matter</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of olive oil in your air fryer ensures food cooks evenly without excess grease. Too little oil can leave dishes dry, while too much may cause smoking or uneven browning. For 0.375 cup of olive oil, knowing it’s 3 ounces helps maintain balance. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more handy tips.</p>  

<p>Olive oil adds flavour and crispiness to air-fried dishes, but precision is key. Whether you’re making roasted potatoes or marinating salmon, 0.375 cup (3 oz) is a common measurement. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a> includes many dishes where this conversion comes in handy.</p>  

<h3>How to measure 0.375 cup of olive oil</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a measuring cup, use a kitchen scale to weigh out 3 ounces of olive oil. Alternatively, 0.375 cup is equivalent to 6 tablespoons, which can be easier to measure. For best results, always level off your measurements to avoid over-pouring.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for 0.375 cup of olive oil in air frying</h2>  
<p>This measurement is perfect for coating vegetables like potatoes or Brussels sprouts before air frying. It’s also ideal for marinating chicken or drizzling over salmon fillets. Visit our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/potatoes>potato recipes</a> for inspiration on using this amount.</p>  

<p>Another great use is for homemade air fryer dressings or marinades. Combine 0.375 cup (3 oz) of olive oil with herbs and spices for a flavour boost. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipes</a> often call for this quantity to keep meat juicy and crispy.</p>  

<h3>Converting other olive oil measurements</h3>  
<p>If you need to adjust recipes, remember that 1 cup of olive oil equals 8 ounces. So, 0.375 cup is exactly half of 0.75 cup (6 oz). Keeping these conversions in mind makes scaling recipes up or down simple.</p>  

<h2>Tips for working with olive oil in your air fryer</h2>  
<p>Always use a light hand when applying oil to prevent smoking. A spray bottle can help distribute 0.375 cup (3 oz) evenly. After cooking, clean your air fryer with our recommended <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner</a> to maintain performance.</p>  

<p>For best results, use extra virgin olive oil in your air fryer as it has a higher smoke point. Measuring 0.375 cup (3 oz) accurately ensures your dishes turn out perfectly every time.

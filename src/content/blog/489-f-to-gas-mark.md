<h2>Using 489 F in Your Air Fryer</h2>
<p>Modern air fryers easily reach 489°F (Gas Mark 9), making them versatile for high-heat cooking. When setting your air fryer to 489 F, remember cooking times will be shorter than conventional ovens. The concentrated heat circulation means foods cook about 20% faster at this temperature compared to standard ovens.</p>
<p>For perfect <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/potatoes>roast potatoes</a> at 489 F, reduce the cooking time by 5-7 minutes from oven recipes. The high heat creates wonderfully crispy exteriors while keeping interiors fluffy. Always preheat your air fryer for 3-5 minutes when cooking at 489°F (Gas Mark 9) to ensure consistent results.</p>

<h3>Safety Tips for High-Temperature Air Frying</h3>
<p>When cooking at 489 F (Gas Mark 9), always use oven gloves when handling the air fryer basket. The extreme heat can cause serious burns if you're not careful. Ensure your air fryer has adequate ventilation space around it, as high temperatures increase surface heat on the appliance.</p>

<h2>Recipe Adjustments for 489 F to Gas Mark</h2>

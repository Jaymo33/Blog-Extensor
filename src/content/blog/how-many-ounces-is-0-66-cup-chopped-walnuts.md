<p>0.66 cup of chopped walnuts equals approximately 2.64 ounces (oz). This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements ensure perfect texture and flavour. Whether you're baking walnut cookies or adding crunch to a salad, knowing the exact weight saves time and avoids waste.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on even heat distribution, and incorrect ingredient quantities can lead to uneven cooking. For example, using too many chopped walnuts might overcrowd the basket, while too few could leave your dish lacking texture. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we emphasise precision for consistent results. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> simplifies these calculations, so you’ll never second-guess measurements again.</p>  

<p>Chopped walnuts are a versatile ingredient, appearing in everything from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>air fryer cakes</a> to crusted salmon. Their density means volume-to-weight conversions aren’t always intuitive. That’s why we recommend using a kitchen scale for reliability, especially when adapting traditional recipes for air frying.</p>

<h2>How to Measure 0.66 Cup of Chopped Walnuts</h2>  
<p>If you don’t have a scale, use the spoon-and-level method for chopped walnuts. Gently fill your measuring cup without packing them down, then level off the top with a knife. For 0.66 cup, measure 2/3 cup or combine 1/2 cup plus 2 tablespoons. Remember, finely chopped walnuts settle more densely, so adjust if your recipe specifies coarseness.</p>  

<p>Pre-packaged walnuts often list weights, making conversions easier. A standard 100g bag yields roughly 3.5 oz or 0.85 cups chopped. For 0.66 cup (2.64 oz), you’d need about 75g. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>walnut recipe collection</a> for inspiration on using this amount in air fryer-friendly dishes.</p>

<h3>Converting Other Walnut Amounts</h3>  
<p>Need to scale up or down? Here’s a quick reference: 1/4 cup chopped walnuts = 1 oz, 1/2 cup = 2 oz, and 1 cup = 4 oz. These ratios work for most recipes, including <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>air fryer desserts</a>.

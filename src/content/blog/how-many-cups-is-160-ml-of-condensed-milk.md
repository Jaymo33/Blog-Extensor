<p>160 ml of condensed milk is approximately 0.68 cups. This conversion is essential for baking and cooking, especially when using an air fryer where precise measurements matter. Whether you're making a cake, fudge, or a creamy dessert, knowing how to convert 160 ml of condensed milk to cups ensures your recipe turns out just right.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>When using an air fryer, precise ingredient measurements can make or break a recipe. Too much or too little condensed milk can affect texture and cooking time. For example, if you're making <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer caramel</a>, 160 ml of condensed milk (0.68 cups) needs to be exact for the right consistency. Air fryers cook quickly, so even small measurement errors can lead to overcooking or undercooking.</p>  

<p>Condensed milk is thicker than regular milk, so volume conversions like 160 ml to cups must account for density. If you're adapting a recipe from metric to imperial, this conversion ensures you don’t end up with a soggy or dry result. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for other common measurements.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure 160 ml of Condensed Milk Without a Scale</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a measuring jug, use a standard US cup (240 ml) and fill it just over halfway for 160 ml. For UK bakers, a metric cup (250 ml) requires filling to about 64% of its capacity. Stir the condensed milk first to ensure an even consistency, as it can settle and thicken over time.</p>  

<h2>Common Recipes Using 160 ml of Condensed Milk</h2>  
<p>Many <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert recipes</a> call for 160 ml of condensed milk, including air fryer fudge, tres leches cake, or banoffee pie. Since air fryers excel at even heating, desserts with condensed milk often cook faster and more evenly than in conventional ovens. Always preheat your air fryer for best results.</p>  

<p>For savoury dishes, like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>air fryer glazed chicken</a>, 160 ml of condensed milk can be part of a marinade. The sugar content caramelises beautifully under the air fryer’s high heat. Just remember to adjust cooking times slightly to prevent burning.</p>  

<h3>Converting 160 ml of Condensed Milk for Different Cup Sizes</h3>  
<p>If a recipe calls for "1 cup" but you’re using 160 ml (0.68 cups), you’ll need to adjust other ingredients proportionally. For example, if a cake requires 1 cup of condensed milk, using 160 ml means reducing flour and eggs by roughly one-third. Always double-check conversions to avoid mishaps.</p>  

<h2>Tips for Storing and Handling Condensed Milk</h2>  
<p>After opening, store leftover condensed milk in an airtight container in the fridge. If you’ve measured 160 ml for a recipe but have extra, it can last up to two weeks. For longer storage, freeze it in portions—thaw before using in your next <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer recipe</a>.</p>  

<p>Condensed milk can stick to measuring cups, so lightly grease the cup with oil for easier pouring. For sticky recipes like fudge, lining your air fryer basket with parchment paper prevents mess and makes cleanup a breeze.</p>  

<h3>Why Air Fryers Love Condensed Milk Recipes</h3>  
<p>The concentrated sweetness and creamy texture of condensed milk work brilliantly in air fryers. From quick <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cookies>air fryer cookies</a> to no-churn ice cream bases, 160 ml (0.68 cups) is a versatile quantity. The air fryer’s rapid circulation enhances caramelisation, giving desserts a richer flavour.</p>

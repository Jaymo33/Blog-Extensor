<p>3 tablespoons of condensed milk weigh approximately 60 grams. This conversion is essential for precise baking and air fryer recipes, ensuring your desserts turn out perfectly every time. Whether you're making a caramel drizzle or a creamy filling, knowing the exact weight helps avoid kitchen mishaps. For more air fryer measurement tips, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter</h2>  
<p>Using the correct amount of condensed milk can make or break a recipe. Too little, and your dessert might lack sweetness; too much, and it could become overly sticky. Air fryer recipes, in particular, rely on precise measurements for even cooking. If you're whipping up a batch of air fryer cookies or a decadent cake, 60 grams of condensed milk ensures consistency. Explore more <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer dessert recipes</a> for inspiration.</p>  

<p>Condensed milk is thicker than regular milk, so volume-to-weight conversions are crucial. A slight miscalculation can alter texture and taste, especially in no-bake treats. For best results, use a digital kitchen scale. If you don’t have one, our guide simplifies the process with easy-to-follow conversions.</p>  

<h2>How to measure condensed milk without scales</h2>  
<p>If you don’t own a kitchen scale, you can still measure 3 tablespoons of condensed milk accurately. Use a standard UK tablespoon (15ml) and level it off with a knife for precision. Remember, 1 tablespoon of condensed milk weighs roughly 20 grams, so 3 tablespoons equal 60 grams. For sticky ingredients like this, a silicone spatula helps scrape every last bit from the spoon.</p>  

<h3>Common uses for 3 tbsp condensed milk</h3>  
<p>This measurement is perfect for small-batch recipes, such as air fryer caramel sauce or drizzles for <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>air fryer desserts</a>. It’s also ideal for enhancing coffee, frosting cupcakes, or sweetening overnight oats. Since condensed milk is shelf-stable, keeping a tin on hand means you’re always ready to whip up something delicious.</p>  

<h2>Converting other condensed milk amounts</h2>  
<p>Need to adjust your recipe? Here’s a quick reference: 1 tablespoon = 20g, 2 tablespoons = 40g, and 4 tablespoons = 80g. For larger quantities, a 397g tin of condensed milk holds about 20 tablespoons. Bookmark our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a> for future use.</p>  

<p>Condensed milk is a staple in many global cuisines, from Vietnamese iced coffee to British banoffee pie. Its rich, creamy texture makes it a favourite for no-fuss desserts. If you’re experimenting with air fryer recipes, try adding a dollop to your next batch of <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>air fryer cakes</a> for extra moisture.</p>  

<h3>Storage tips for leftover condensed milk</h3>  
<p>Transfer any unused condensed milk to an airtight container and refrigerate for up to 2 weeks. To prevent crystallization, press cling film directly onto the surface before sealing. For longer storage, freeze it in ice cube trays—each cube is roughly 1 tablespoon (20g). Thaw overnight in the fridge before use.</p>

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on precise ingredient ratios to deliver consistent results. Using the correct amount of evaporated cream, like 0.25 cup (or 2 oz), ensures your dishes aren't too dry or too runny. For example, a creamy pasta bake or a rich dessert requires exact measurements to achieve the right texture. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more handy measurement tips.</p>

<h2>How to measure 0.25 cup of evaporated cream</h2>  
<p>Measuring 0.25 cup of evaporated cream is simple with the right tools. Use a liquid measuring cup for accuracy, and fill it to the 0.25 cup mark.

<h3>Using a kitchen scale for precision</h3>  
<p>A kitchen scale is the most accurate way to measure 0.25 cup of evaporated cream, as it directly shows 2 oz. Place your bowl on the scale, tare it, and pour the cream until it reaches 2 oz. This method eliminates guesswork and ensures your air fryer dishes turn out perfectly every time.</p>  

<h2>Common recipes using 0.25 cup of evaporated cream</h2>

At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we focus on making cooking simpler with accurate conversions and delicious recipes.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of orange juice can make or break your air fryer dish. Too little, and your marinade might lack flavour; too much, and your food could become soggy.

<p>Many air fryer recipes, such as those in our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipes section</a>, rely on liquid measurements for balanced flavours.

Whether you're cooking for one or meal prepping, converting 1.66 cups to ounces ensures you nail the recipe every time.</p>  

<h3>How to measure orange juice for air fryer recipes</h3>  
<p>For best results, use a liquid measuring cup to pour 1.66 cups of orange juice, then check the weight in ounces on a kitchen scale. This method eliminates guesswork and guarantees accuracy. If you're working with freshly squeezed juice, strain it first to remove pulp, as this can affect the volume. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipes</a> often call for precise citrus measurements to enhance tenderness and taste.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for 1.66 cups of orange juice</h2>

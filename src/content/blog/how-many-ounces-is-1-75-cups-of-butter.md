<p>1.75 cups of butter equals exactly 14 ounces. This conversion is essential for precise baking and cooking, especially when using an air fryer where measurements matter. Whether you're whipping up a cake or preparing a savoury dish, knowing how to convert cups to ounces ensures your recipes turn out perfectly every time.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Butter Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Accurate measurements are crucial in cooking and baking, particularly when using an air fryer. Too much or too little butter can affect texture, moisture, and even cooking times. For example, if you're making air fryer cookies from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>our recipe collection</a>, precise butter measurements ensure they come out crispy yet tender. Even a slight deviation can lead to overly greasy or dry results.</p>  

<p>Butter is often measured in cups, but many recipes, especially those from the UK or Europe, use weight measurements like ounces or grams. Converting 1.75 cups of butter to ounces (14 oz) helps standardise your cooking process. This is especially useful if you're following an international recipe or scaling ingredients for meal prep.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure Butter Correctly</h3>  
<p>Measuring butter can be tricky if you don’t have a kitchen scale. Most UK butter blocks come in 250g packs, which is roughly 8.8 ounces or 1 cup. For 1.75 cups, you’d need about 1 and 3/4 blocks. If you’re using tablespoons, remember that 1 cup of butter is 16 tablespoons, so 1.75 cups would be 28 tablespoons. For air fryer recipes, like those on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, measuring by weight is often more reliable.</p>  

<h2>Converting Cups to Ounces for Different Ingredients</h2>  
<p>While 1.75 cups of butter equals 14 ounces, other ingredients have different conversions. For example, 1.75 cups of flour is about 7.7 ounces, and 1.75 cups of sugar is roughly 12.3 ounces. Always check a reliable <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a> when working with new recipes, especially for air fryer cooking where precision affects texture and doneness.</p>  

<p>If you’re preparing a dish like air fryer salmon or roasted vegetables from our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable recipes</a>, butter measurements might be less critical, but still important for flavour. However, for baked goods like cakes or cookies, sticking to 14 ounces for 1.75 cups of butter ensures consistency.</p>  

<h3>Common Mistakes When Measuring Butter</h3>  
<p>One common mistake is using melted butter instead of solid butter when measuring by cups. Always measure butter in its solid state unless the recipe specifies otherwise. Another error is packing butter into a cup, which can lead to over-measuring. For 1.75 cups of butter, lightly spoon it into the measuring cup and level it off with a knife for accuracy.</p>  

<h2>Using Butter in Air Fryer Recipes</h2>  
<p>Butter adds richness and flavour to air fryer dishes, from crispy potatoes to golden chicken. When converting 1.75 cups of butter to ounces (14 oz), you can adjust recipes without guesswork. For example, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/potatoes>air fryer potato recipes</a> often use butter for extra crispiness, and precise measurements prevent sogginess.</p>  

<p>If you’re reheating or cooking frozen foods in the air fryer, like garlic bread or pastries, a light butter brush can enhance texture. Just remember that 1.75 cups of butter equals 14 ounces, so you don’t overdo it. Too much butter can cause smoking or uneven cooking in the air fryer.</p>  

<h3>Storing and Handling Butter for Best Results</h3>  
<p>Proper butter storage ensures accurate measurements. Keep it refrigerated and bring it to room temperature only when needed. If you’ve ever wondered why your air fryer recipes don’t turn out as expected, inconsistent butter measurements could be the culprit. For sticky situations, check our guide on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning your air fryer</a> after buttery mishaps.</p>

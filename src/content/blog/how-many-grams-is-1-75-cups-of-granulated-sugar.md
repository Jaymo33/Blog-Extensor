<p>1.75 cups of granulated sugar equals approximately 350 grams. This conversion is essential for precise baking, especially when using an air fryer, where accurate measurements can make or break a recipe. Whether you’re whipping up cakes, cookies, or desserts, knowing the exact gram equivalent ensures consistent results every time.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Sugar Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Baking is a science, and even small deviations in measurements can affect texture and taste. Granulated sugar, in particular, plays a crucial role in structure and sweetness. Using 1.75 cups of granulated sugar without converting to grams might lead to overly sweet or dense outcomes. For air fryer recipes, precision is even more critical due to the appliance’s rapid cooking style.</p>  
<p>At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we emphasise the importance of accurate conversions. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> simplifies these calculations, so you never have to guess. Whether you’re baking a classic Victoria sponge or experimenting with air-fried cookies, 350 grams of sugar will give you the perfect balance.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure 1.75 Cups of Granulated Sugar</h3>  
<p>To measure 1.75 cups of granulated sugar accurately, use a dry measuring cup and level it off with a straight edge. For even better precision, weigh it on a kitchen scale. This method eliminates inconsistencies caused by how tightly packed the sugar is. If you’re adapting a recipe from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>our collection</a>, always opt for grams over cups for foolproof results.</p>  

<h2>Converting Cups to Grams for Different Sugars</h2>  
<p>While 1.75 cups of granulated sugar equals 350 grams, other sugars like brown or powdered have different densities. Brown sugar, for instance, is denser due to its moisture content. Always check specific conversion charts when switching sugar types. For air fryer baking, sticking to granulated sugar measurements ensures your treats come out light and crispy.</p>  
<p>If you’re exploring <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>cake recipes</a>, precise sugar measurements are non-negotiable. Too much sugar can cause excessive browning in the air fryer, while too little may leave your bake bland. Our gram-based recommendations take the guesswork out of the equation.</p>  

<h3>Common Mistakes When Measuring Sugar</h3>  
<p>One frequent error is scooping sugar directly from the bag with the measuring cup, which compacts it and leads to excess. Instead, spoon the sugar into the cup lightly. Another pitfall is ignoring temperature—humid conditions can cause granulated sugar to clump, affecting volume. For air fryer recipes, always use a scale to avoid these issues.</p>  

<h2>Using 1.75 Cups of Granulated Sugar in Air Fryer Recipes</h2>  
<p>Air fryers excel at baking, but their high speed demands precision. When a recipe calls for 1.75 cups of granulated sugar (350 grams), measure carefully to prevent overcaramelisation or uneven cooking. Classics like air-fried doughnuts or shortbread rely on this exact balance for the perfect crunch.</p>

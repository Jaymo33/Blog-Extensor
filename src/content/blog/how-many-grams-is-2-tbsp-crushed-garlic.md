<p>2 tablespoons (tbsp) of crushed garlic weigh approximately 28 grams in UK measurements. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise ingredient quantities can make or break a dish. Whether you're whipping up garlic-infused chicken or a flavourful vegetable stir-fry, knowing the exact weight ensures consistency. For more air fryer conversion tips, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>

<h2>Why accurate garlic measurements matter</h2>  
<p>Garlic is a powerhouse ingredient that can transform your air fryer dishes, but too much or too little can throw off the balance. Crushed garlic, in particular, can vary in density, making volume measurements like tablespoons less reliable than weight. Using grams ensures you get the right intensity of flavour every time. If you're prepping a batch of garlic mushrooms or garlic butter shrimp, precision is key. Visit our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipes section</a> for inspiration.</p>  

<p>Many home cooks assume that 2 tbsp of crushed garlic is a standard amount, but the actual weight can differ based on how finely it's crushed. For UK cooks, sticking to grams eliminates guesswork. This is especially useful for meal prepping or scaling recipes up or down. If you're new to air frying, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable recipes</a> are a great place to start experimenting with garlic.</p>  

<h2>How to measure crushed garlic correctly</h2>  
<p>To get an accurate 28 grams from 2 tbsp of crushed garlic, pack it lightly into the spoon without pressing too hard. Overpacking can add extra weight and throw off your recipe. If you're using freshly crushed garlic, let it settle for a minute before measuring to avoid air pockets. For convenience, many cooks pre-measure garlic and store it in the fridge. Just be sure to use an airtight container to preserve freshness.</p>  

<h3>Using kitchen scales for precision</h3>  
<p>Investing in a digital kitchen scale is the best way to ensure accuracy when converting 2 tbsp of crushed garlic to grams. Scales are affordable and take the guesswork out of measurements, especially for sticky ingredients like garlic. If you're serious about air frying, a scale is as essential as your air fryer itself. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning guide</a> to keep your tools in top shape.</p>  

<h2>Common recipes using 2 tbsp crushed garlic</h2>  
<p>Many air fryer recipes call for roughly 2 tbsp (28g) of crushed garlic, from marinades to rubs. Garlic butter chicken, roasted potatoes, and even garlic bread all benefit from this quantity. The strong flavour of garlic pairs perfectly with meats and vegetables alike. For a quick weeknight meal, try our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>garlic chicken recipes</a> that make the most of this measurement.</p>  

<p>When adapting oven recipes for the air fryer, the 2 tbsp crushed garlic to grams conversion becomes even more important. Air fryers cook faster and more intensely, so balanced flavours are crucial. Too much garlic can become overpowering in the concentrated heat of an air fryer. Always start with the recommended 28 grams and adjust to taste in future batches.</p>  

<h3>Storing leftover crushed garlic</h3>  
<p>If you've measured out 2 tbsp (28g) of crushed garlic but don't need it all, proper storage is key. Transfer leftovers to a small jar, cover with olive oil, and refrigerate for up to two weeks. Alternatively, freeze measured portions in ice cube trays for future use. This way, you'll always have the right amount of garlic ready for your next air fryer creation.</p>

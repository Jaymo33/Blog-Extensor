<p>1.5 tablespoons of powdered milk equals approximately 11 grams. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precision matters, especially when baking or making sauces. Whether you’re whipping up a creamy dessert or adding richness to a dish, knowing the exact weight ensures consistent results every time.</p>

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>
<p>Air fryers rely on precise cooking times and temperatures, so ingredient measurements need to be spot-on. Using too much or too little powdered milk can affect texture and flavour, particularly in baked goods like cakes or cookies. For example, adding extra powdered milk might make a batter too thick, while skimping could leave it lacking richness.</p>
<p>If you’re exploring new recipes on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, you’ll notice many rely on grams for accuracy. A digital kitchen scale is a must-have tool for air fryer enthusiasts, especially when working with ingredients like powdered milk that can compact or vary in density.</p>

<h2>How to measure powdered milk correctly</h2>
<p>Powdered milk can settle or become packed, so the scoop-and-level method works best. Use a tablespoon to lightly scoop the powder, then level it off with a straight edge for consistency. For 1.5 tbsp, measure one full tablespoon first, then add half of another levelled tablespoon.</p>
<p>If you’re scaling up a recipe from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert recipes</a>, converting tablespoons to grams becomes even more crucial. Larger batches magnify small measurement errors, so weighing ingredients eliminates guesswork.</p>

<h3>Converting other powdered milk amounts</h3>
<p>Once you know 1.5 tbsp equals 11 grams, you can easily scale up or down. For instance, 3 tbsp would be 22 grams, while 0.75 tbsp would be about 5.5 grams.

<h3>Storing powdered milk for best results</h3>
<p>Keep your powdered milk in an airtight container in a cool, dry place to maintain freshness. Proper storage ensures accurate measurements every time you use it in your air fryer creations. If you notice any clumping, sift the powder before measuring for consistent results.</p>

<h2>Troubleshooting powdered milk measurements</h2>
<p>If your air fryer recipe isn’t turning out as expected, double-check your powdered milk measurements. Different brands may vary slightly in density, so when in doubt, weigh it out.

<p>1.5 cups of crushed garlic equals approximately 12 ounces. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements ensure even cooking and perfect flavour. Whether you’re making garlic bread, roasted vegetables, or a marinade, knowing the weight helps avoid over or under-seasoning. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we focus on accuracy to help you nail every dish.</p>  

<h2>Why measuring crushed garlic matters in air frying</h2>  
<p>Garlic’s intensity can vary based on how finely it’s crushed, making weight a more reliable measure than volume. In an air fryer, uneven distribution of garlic could lead to some bites being overpowering while others lack flavour. By converting 1.5 cups of crushed garlic to ounces, you ensure consistency. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for other common ingredient swaps.</p>  

<p>Recipes like garlic butter shrimp or crispy garlic potatoes rely on balanced seasoning. Too much garlic can burn, while too little might leave the dish bland. If you’re prepping ahead, storing crushed garlic by weight (like 12 ounces for 1.5 cups) keeps portions accurate. For more recipe ideas, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>garlic-infused dishes</a>.</p>  

<h3>How to measure crushed garlic correctly</h3>  
<p>Use a kitchen scale for the most accurate results. Lightly pack the crushed garlic into a measuring cup without pressing too hard, as this can compact it and skew the weight. If you don’t have a scale, remember that 1.5 cups of crushed garlic is roughly 12 ounces. This method works for UK measurements too, as fluid ounces and weight ounces align closely here.</p>  

<h2>Common recipes using 1.5 cups of crushed garlic</h2>  
<p>Garlic-heavy dishes like air-fryer garlic bread or roasted chicken benefit from this conversion. For example, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>garlic butter chicken</a> uses precisely 12 ounces of crushed garlic for optimal flavour. Similarly, garlic mushrooms or tofu stir-fry can be adjusted using this measurement. Visit <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> for step-by-step guides.</p>  

<p>If you’re batch-cooking, knowing that 1.5 cups equals 12 ounces helps scale recipes up or down. Frozen garlic cubes can also be used—just thaw and measure by weight. For cleaning tips after handling garlic, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner guide</a> has you covered.</p>  

<h3>Adjusting for different garlic textures</h3>  
<p>Minced garlic weighs slightly less than crushed, so if substituting, reduce the amount by 1-2 ounces. Pureed garlic, on the other hand, is denser, so 1.5 cups could weigh closer to 14 ounces. Always tweak based on your preferred intensity and the recipe’s requirements.</p>

    "@type": "Answer",
    "text": "At high altitudes, sugar's effects intensify. You might need to reduce the 13.28-ounce quantity slightly (by 1-2 tablespoons) to prevent over-browning. Air fryers cook faster than conventional ovens, so this adjustment becomes more crucial in mountainous regions."

<p>1.66 cups of granulated sugar equals approximately 13.28 ounces (or 13 ¼ oz for practical measuring). This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precision matters, especially when baking cakes or sweet treats. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we know that getting measurements right makes all the difference between a perfect bake and a kitchen disaster.</p>

<h2>Why accurate sugar measurements matter in air fryer baking</h2>
<p>Granulated sugar behaves differently under high heat compared to other ingredients. Too much can cause burning or over-browning in your air fryer, while too little affects texture and rise. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> helps eliminate guesswork for all your baking needs. Whether you're adapting a conventional oven recipe or creating something new, precise ounces ensure consistent results.</p>
<p>Many air fryer <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>cake recipes</a> specifically call for 1.66 cups of sugar - a common measurement for medium-sized batches. This converts to 13.28 ounces, which you can measure using digital scales for absolute accuracy. For those without scales, remember that 1 cup of granulated sugar typically weighs 8 ounces, making 1.66 cups equal to 13.28 ounces.</p>

<h3>Measuring without kitchen scales</h3>
<p>If you don't have digital scales, use the spoon-and-level method for dry ingredients. Gently spoon granulated sugar into your measuring cup until it mounds slightly above the rim, then level off with a straight edge. For 1.66 cups, measure one full cup plus two-thirds of another cup. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a> includes visual guides to help master these techniques.</p>

<h2>UK vs US measurements for granulated sugar</h2>
<p>While 1.66 cups converts to 13.28 ounces in both UK and US measurements, cup sizes differ slightly. UK cups hold 250ml versus the US 240ml standard, but granulated sugar's density makes the weight conversion identical. This means whether you're using British or American recipes, 1.66 cups of granulated sugar will always be 13.28 ounces.</p>
<p>When working with air fryer recipes from different sources, always check the origin. Some older UK recipes might use imperial ounces (28.35g) rather than the modern metric equivalent. Our conversion accounts for contemporary UK measurements used in most modern air fryer manuals and <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert recipes</a>.</p>

<h3>Adjusting air fryer settings for sugar-heavy recipes</h3>
<p>Recipes using 1.66 cups (13.28oz) of granulated sugar often require temperature adjustments. Sugar caramelises at around 160°C, so reduce your air fryer temperature by 10-15°C compared to savoury dishes. Always preheat your air fryer when working with precise sugar measurements to ensure even cooking.</p>

<h2>Common uses for 1.66 cups of granulated sugar</h2>
<p>This specific measurement appears frequently in air fryer baking. It's perfect for making 12 cupcakes, a small sponge cake, or a batch of cookies. The 13.28-ounce quantity provides enough sweetness without overwhelming other flavours. Visit our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning guide</a> for tips on removing sticky sugar residues after baking.</p>
<p>Many air fryer users find 1.66 cups (13.28oz) ideal for fruit crumbles or streusel toppings too. The measurement scales perfectly when doubling or halving recipes. Remember that granulated sugar measurements should always be level for accuracy, especially in compact air fryer baskets where space is limited.</p>

<h3>Storing leftover granulated sugar</h3>
<p>After measuring out your 1.66 cups (13.28oz), store remaining sugar in an airtight container to prevent clumping. Humidity affects granulated sugar's volume-to-weight ratio, so always measure freshly opened sugar for the most accurate conversions in your air fryer recipes.</p>

<p>100 grams (100g) of molasses equals approximately 3.53 ounces (oz). This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes, especially when precision matters for baking or glazing. Whether you’re making sticky gingerbread or a marinade, knowing the exact weight ensures perfect results every time.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on precise ingredient ratios to ensure even cooking and perfect texture. Too much molasses can make dishes overly sticky, while too little might leave them lacking depth. For recipes like air fryer cakes or glazed meats, measuring 100g of molasses correctly (3.53 oz) ensures balanced flavours and textures.</p>  
<p>If you’re new to air fryer cooking, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for other common ingredient conversions. It’s a lifesaver for adapting traditional recipes to your air fryer!</p>  

<h2>How to measure molasses accurately</h2>  
<p>Molasses is sticky and dense, making it tricky to measure. For 100g of molasses (3.53 oz), use a digital kitchen scale for the most precise results. If you don’t have one, a tablespoon holds roughly 20g (0.7 oz), so five level tablespoons will get you close to 100g.</p>  

<h3>Tips for working with molasses in air fryer recipes</h3>  
<p>Lightly grease your measuring spoon or cup with oil to help the molasses slide out easily. This trick works wonders for sticky ingredients like honey or syrup too.

<h2>Common uses for molasses in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Molasses adds rich, caramelised flavour to both sweet and savoury dishes. Try it in air fryer ginger cookies, barbecue glazes for chicken, or even as a marinade for roasted vegetables. Since 100g of molasses equals 3.53 oz, you can easily adjust recipes to suit your taste.</p>

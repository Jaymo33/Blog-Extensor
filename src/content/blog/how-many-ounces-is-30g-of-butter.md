<p>30g of butter equals approximately 1.06 ounces. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements can make or break your dish. Whether you’re baking, frying, or melting butter for a recipe, knowing how to convert grams to ounces ensures accuracy. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we understand the importance of getting measurements right, especially when working with smaller quantities like 30g of butter.</p>

<h2>Why Convert 30g of Butter to Ounces?</h2>  
<p>Many UK recipes use grams, while others rely on ounces, especially older cookbooks or international guides. Converting 30g of butter to ounces (1.06 oz) helps standardise measurements across different sources. This is particularly useful for air fryer cooking, where even small deviations can affect texture and cooking times. For example, if you’re making air fryer cookies or cakes, precise butter measurements ensure the perfect consistency.</p>  
<p>If you’re unsure about other conversions, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> can help. It covers everything from temperature adjustments to weight measurements, making it easier to adapt any recipe for your air fryer. Whether you’re working with 30g of butter or larger quantities, having a reliable reference saves time and reduces guesswork.</p>  

<h2>How to Measure 30g of Butter Accurately</h2>  
<p>Measuring 30g of butter doesn’t require scales if you know the conversions. One tablespoon of butter is roughly 14g, so 30g is just over two tablespoons. For ounces, 1.06 oz is a smidge more than a standard US ounce measure. If you’re using pre-packaged butter, check the wrapper—many UK brands mark tablespoon measurements for convenience.</p>  
<p>For air fryer recipes, melted butter is often used to coat ingredients like chicken or vegetables. In these cases, measuring 30g of butter (1.06 oz) ensures even coverage without excess grease. Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipes</a> for ideas on how to use butter effectively in your air fryer.</p>  

<h3>Common Uses for 30g of Butter in Air Fryers</h3>  
<p>30g of butter is a versatile quantity in air fryer cooking. It’s enough to grease a small baking dish, coat potatoes for crispy roasties, or create a rich glaze for salmon. Because air fryers circulate hot air efficiently, you often need less butter than traditional frying methods—making 30g the perfect amount for many recipes.</p>  

<h3>Converting Other Butter Quantities</h3>  
<p>If you’re scaling recipes up or down, remember that 100g of butter equals 3.53 oz. This makes it easy to adjust measurements while maintaining accuracy. For more tips on adapting recipes, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a>, which includes conversions for common ingredients.</p>  

<h2>Tips for Working with Butter in Air Fryers</h2>  
<p>Butter can smoke at high temperatures, so it’s best used at lower heats or mixed with oil for air frying. When measuring 30g of butter (1.06 oz), consider melting it first for even distribution. This works well for coating foods like shrimp or tofu before air frying. For cleaning up afterward, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner guide</a> has handy tips.</p>  
<p>If you’re making desserts, like air fryer cakes or cookies, 30g of butter provides richness without overwhelming the batter. For savoury dishes, such as our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable recipes</a>, butter adds depth of flavour when used sparingly.</p>

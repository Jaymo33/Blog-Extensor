<h2>How many ounces is 1.66 cups of caster sugar?</h2>  
<p>1.66 cups of caster sugar equals approximately 13.28 ounces. This conversion is essential for precise baking, especially when using an air fryer where measurements matter. Caster sugar, finer than granulated but coarser than icing sugar, is a staple in many UK recipes. Whether you're whipping up a cake or cookies, knowing the exact weight ensures consistent results. For more air fryer conversions, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>  

<p>Converting cups to ounces can be tricky, as sugar density varies slightly. However, for caster sugar, 1 cup typically weighs around 8 ounces. This means 1.66 cups of caster sugar translates to 13.28 ounces, giving you the accuracy needed for perfect bakes. If you're adapting traditional recipes for your air fryer, precise measurements like these are key. Visit <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> for more tips on air fryer baking.</p>  

<h3>Why accurate sugar measurements matter</h3>  
<p>Using the correct amount of caster sugar ensures your baked goods have the right texture and sweetness. Too much sugar can make desserts overly sweet or cause them to brown too quickly in the air fryer. Too little can result in dry or bland treats. Measuring by weight (ounces) is more reliable than volume (cups), as it accounts for how tightly packed the sugar is. This is especially important for air fryer recipes, where cooking times are shorter and precision is crucial.</p>  

<h2>Converting 1.66 cups of caster sugar to ounces</h2>  
<p>To convert 1.66 cups of caster sugar to ounces, multiply the number of cups by the weight per cup. As mentioned, 1 cup of caster sugar weighs about 8 ounces, so 1.66 x 8 = 13.28 ounces. This calculation works for UK measurements and ensures your recipes turn out perfectly.

<p>If you don't have a kitchen scale, you can use measuring cups, but be sure to spoon the sugar into the cup and level it off for accuracy. Scooping directly from the bag can compact the sugar, leading to an incorrect measurement. For best results, invest in a digital scale to weigh your ingredients, especially when working with air fryer recipes where precision is key. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a> for more inspiration.</p>  

<h3>Tips for measuring caster sugar</h3>  
<p>When measuring caster sugar, always use dry measuring cups and avoid packing it down. Lightly spoon the sugar into the cup and level it off with a straight edge. If you're converting a recipe from grams to cups, remember that 1 ounce equals roughly 28 grams, so 13.28 ounces is about 376 grams. This level of detail ensures your air fryer bakes are consistently delicious.

<h2>Common uses for 1.66 cups of caster sugar</h2>  
<p>1.66 cups (or 13.28 ounces) of caster sugar is often used in mid-sized baking recipes, such as sponge cakes, meringues, or buttercream. Its fine texture dissolves quickly, making it ideal for air fryer desserts that cook faster than traditional oven bakes. Whether you're making a Victoria sponge or delicate cookies, this measurement ensures balanced sweetness and texture.

<p>Caster sugar is also perfect for syrups and glazes, which can be drizzled over air-fried pastries or fruits. Its quick-dissolving properties mean it blends seamlessly into batters and creams, giving a smooth finish. If you're experimenting with air fryer baking, precise measurements like 1.66 cups (13.28 ounces) help replicate successful results every time.

<h3>Storing caster sugar for freshness</h3>  
<p>To keep caster sugar fresh, store it in an airtight container in a cool, dry place. Moisture can cause clumping, which affects measurement accuracy. If your sugar has hardened, break it up with a fork before measuring. Proper storage ensures your 1.66 cups (13.28 ounces) of caster sugar is always ready for your next air fryer baking session.</p>

<h2>What is 228 C in Gas Mark?</h2>
<p>228°C converts to Gas Mark 8. This is a common temperature for baking, roasting, and air frying, especially for dishes that need a crisp finish. Whether you're using a conventional oven or an air fryer, knowing this conversion ensures your recipes turn out perfectly. Many British recipes use Gas Mark, so this conversion is handy for home cooks. If you're adapting an oven recipe for your air fryer, you might need to adjust the cooking time slightly.</p>
<p>Gas Mark temperatures are widely used in the UK, making it essential to understand how they compare to Celsius. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we often see questions about converting temperatures for air fryer use. For example, if a recipe calls for 228°C, setting your air fryer to Gas Mark 8 will give you similar results. Always check your air fryer's manual, as some models might have slight variations in heat distribution.</p>

<h2>Why Convert 228 Celsius to Gas Mark?</h2>
<p>Converting 228 Celsius to Gas Mark is useful for following traditional British recipes that rely on gas oven settings. Many classic dishes, like Yorkshire puddings or roast potatoes, specify Gas Mark temperatures. If you're using an air fryer, knowing the Gas Mark equivalent helps you replicate oven-baked results. This is especially handy if your air fryer has a Gas Mark setting or if you're cross-referencing oven recipes.</p>
<p>Another reason to convert 228 degrees C to Gas Mark is consistency. Ovens and air fryers can vary, but Gas Mark provides a standardised measurement. For instance, Gas Mark 8 (228°C) is ideal for achieving a golden crust on baked goods. If you're exploring recipes on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes</a>, you'll find many dishes that benefit from this temperature. From crispy chicken to perfectly baked cakes, Gas Mark 8 delivers reliable results.</p>

<h3>How to Use 228 C in Gas Mark for Air Fryers</h3>
<p>Air fryers often display temperatures in Celsius, so converting 228°C to Gas Mark 8 helps when following oven-based recipes. Most air fryers don't have Gas Mark settings, but knowing the equivalent Celsius value ensures accuracy. For example, if a recipe suggests Gas Mark 8, set your air fryer to 228°C. You might need to reduce the cooking time by 20% since air fryers cook faster than ovens.</p>

<h2>Common Dishes Cooked at 228 C (Gas Mark 8)</h2>
<p>Many dishes thrive at 228°C or Gas Mark 8, especially those requiring a crisp exterior and tender interior. Roast potatoes, for instance, benefit from this temperature, as do homemade pies and flaky pastries. If you're using an air fryer, you can achieve similar results with less oil. Check out <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/potatoes>airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/potatoes</a> for inspiration on crispy spuds.</p>
<p>Baked goods like scones and biscuits also do well at Gas Mark 8. The high heat helps them rise quickly while developing a lovely golden colour. For air fryer versions, consider using parchment liners (find tips at <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart</a>) to prevent sticking. Whether you're baking or roasting, 228°C (Gas Mark 8) is a versatile temperature for many recipes.</p>

<h3>Tips for Baking at 228 C to Gas Mark</h3>
<p>When baking at 228°C (Gas Mark 8), preheating is crucial for consistent results. This is especially true for air fryers, which heat up faster than ovens. Always use an oven thermometer to verify the temperature, as some appliances can run hot or cold.

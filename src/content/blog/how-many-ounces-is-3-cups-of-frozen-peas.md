<p>3 cups of frozen peas weigh approximately 12 ounces (340 grams). This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes, ensuring precise cooking times and perfect results every time. Whether you're meal prepping or whipping up a quick side dish, knowing the weight helps streamline your cooking process.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Using the correct weight for frozen peas ensures even cooking in your air fryer. Too many peas can overcrowd the basket, leading to unevenly cooked or soggy results. On the other hand, too few might dry out or burn. For best results, stick to the recommended 12 ounces (3 cups) when following recipes from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>.</p>  

<p>Air fryers rely on hot air circulation, so portion control is key. If you're converting from cups to ounces, a kitchen scale is your best friend. Alternatively, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for quick reference. Frozen peas are a versatile ingredient, perfect for sides, salads, or even blended into dips.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure Frozen Peas Without a Scale</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a scale, use a measuring cup for frozen peas. Fill it loosely without packing them down—this ensures an accurate 4 ounces per cup. For 3 cups, that’s roughly 12 ounces. Remember, frozen peas retain moisture, so thawing isn’t necessary before air frying. Just toss them in with a bit of oil and seasoning for a crispy finish.</p>  

<h2>Best Air Fryer Recipes Using 3 Cups of Frozen Peas</h2>  
<p>Frozen peas are a staple in many air fryer dishes. Try them in a quick pea and mint puree or as a crunchy topping for salads. For a simple side, toss 12 ounces (3 cups) of frozen peas with olive oil, salt, and garlic powder. Air fry at 180°C for 8-10 minutes, shaking halfway.</p>  

<p>Looking for more inspiration? Browse our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable recipes</a> for creative ways to use frozen peas. From stir-fries to fritters, the possibilities are endless. And don’t forget to clean your air fryer afterward—here’s a guide on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>keeping it spotless</a>.</p>  

<h3>Common Mistakes When Measuring Frozen Peas</h3>  
<p>Avoid packing frozen peas tightly into the cup—this can add extra weight and throw off your recipe. Also, don’t assume all frozen veggies weigh the same. Peas are denser than, say, chopped spinach, so always check conversions. For 3 cups of frozen peas, stick to 12 ounces for consistency.</p>  

<h2>Converting Other Frozen Vegetables to Ounces</h2>  
<p>Not all frozen veggies measure the same. For example, 3 cups of frozen broccoli florets weigh about 10 ounces, while 3 cups of frozen corn kernels are closer to 13 ounces. Always refer to a reliable conversion chart or weigh them for accuracy. This ensures your air fryer meals turn out perfectly every time.</p>

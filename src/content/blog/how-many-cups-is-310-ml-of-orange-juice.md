<p>310 ml of orange juice is roughly 1.31 cups, making it easy to measure for recipes. Whether you're baking a cake or preparing a marinade, knowing this conversion ensures accuracy. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we help simplify kitchen measurements for hassle-free cooking.</p>  

<h2>Understanding the Conversion</h2>  
<p>Converting millilitres to cups can be tricky, especially when precision matters. For 310 ml of orange juice, the exact measurement is about 1.31 cups. This is useful for recipes that require specific liquid volumes, such as cakes or glazes. If you're using an air fryer, precise measurements ensure even cooking and perfect results. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more handy tips.</p>  

<p>Different countries use varying cup sizes, which can affect your recipe. In the UK, a standard metric cup holds 250 ml, while in the US, it's 240 ml. For 310 ml of orange juice, this means roughly 1.24 UK cups or 1.31 US cups. Always check your recipe's origin to avoid confusion. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipes section</a> includes both metric and imperial measurements for convenience.</p>  

<h3>Why Accuracy Matters in Air Fryer Cooking</h3>  
<p>Air fryers rely on even heat distribution, so precise measurements prevent soggy or unevenly cooked food. Too much liquid, like orange juice, can steam rather than crisp your dish. Measuring 310 ml correctly ensures your marinades or glazes don’t overpower the texture.

<h2>Common Uses for 310 ml of Orange Juice</h2>  
<p>Orange juice adds brightness to both sweet and savoury dishes. From glazing chicken to moistening cakes, 310 ml (1.31 cups) is a versatile quantity. Try it in air fryer orange chicken or a citrus-infused cake for a zesty twist. Visit <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> for inspiration.</p>  

<p>Marinades benefit from the acidity of orange juice, tenderising meats perfectly. A 310 ml portion balances flavour without overwhelming. For cleaning tips after sticky marinades, see our guide on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner</a>.</p>  

<h3>Measuring Without a Cup</h3>  
<p>No measuring cup? Use a kitchen scale: 310 ml of orange juice weighs about 310 grams. Alternatively, tablespoons (15 ml each) can help—20 tbsp and 2 tsp equal 310 ml. Precision ensures your air fryer dishes turn out perfectly every time.</p>

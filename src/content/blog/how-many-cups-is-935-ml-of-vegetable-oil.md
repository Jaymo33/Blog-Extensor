<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>
<p>Using the right amount of vegetable oil is crucial for air fryer recipes.

<h2>How to Measure 935 ml of Vegetable Oil Without a Scale</h2>
<p>If you don't have a measuring jug, you can use standard cups to measure 935 ml of vegetable oil. Since 1 cup equals roughly 237 ml, 935 ml works out to just under 4 cups. For smaller quantities, tablespoons or teaspoons can help fine-tune the measurement.</p>

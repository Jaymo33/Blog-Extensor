<p>35 ml of double cream is roughly 0.15 cups (or just under 1/6 of a cup). This conversion is handy for recipes that require precise measurements, especially when using an air fryer for baking or cooking creamy dishes. Whether you're whipping up a dessert or adding richness to a sauce, knowing how to convert millilitres to cups ensures your dish turns out perfectly every time.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>When working with double cream, even small measurement discrepancies can affect the texture and consistency of your dish. Too much cream can make a sauce overly rich, while too little might leave it lacking in flavour. For air fryer recipes, precision is key to achieving the right balance of moisture and crispiness. That’s why understanding conversions like 35 ml of double cream to cups is so important.</p>  
<p>If you're following a recipe from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, you’ll often find measurements in millilitres or grams. Converting these to cups can simplify the process, especially if you don’t have a kitchen scale. A quick tip: for thicker liquids like double cream, always use a liquid measuring cup for the most accurate results.</p>  

<h2>How to Measure 35 ml of Double Cream</h2>  
<p>If you don’t have a measuring jug with millilitre markings, you can still measure 35 ml of double cream using standard cups. Since 1 cup equals 240 ml, 35 ml is approximately 0.15 cups. For easier visualisation, this is just under 1/6 of a cup. A tablespoon holds about 15 ml, so 35 ml would be roughly 2 tablespoons plus 1 teaspoon.</p>  

<h3>Using an Air Fryer for Cream-Based Recipes</h3>  
<p>Double cream is a staple in many air fryer recipes, from creamy pasta bakes to indulgent desserts. When converting 35 ml of double cream to cups, ensure you’re using the right measurement to avoid over-saturating your dish. For example, a rich <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert</a> like crème brûlée requires precise cream ratios for the perfect texture.</p>  

<h2>Common Conversions for Double Cream</h2>  
<p>Beyond 35 ml, it’s useful to know other common conversions for double cream. For instance, 50 ml is about 0.21 cups, while 100 ml is roughly 0.42 cups. If you’re scaling up a recipe, a handy <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a> can save time and ensure accuracy.</p>  
<p>Double cream’s thickness means it doesn’t pour as easily as milk, so spooning it into a measuring cup works best. For air fryer cooking, precise measurements help prevent spills and uneven cooking. Whether you’re making a creamy sauce or a fluffy cake, getting the cream ratio right makes all the difference.</p>  

<h3>Tips for Storing Double Cream</h3>  
<p>Once opened, double cream should be used within a few days. If your recipe calls for 35 ml and you have leftovers, consider making a small batch of <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/breakfast>breakfast</a> pancakes or a creamy soup. Proper storage ensures your cream stays fresh for future recipes.</p>  

<h2>FAQs About Measuring Double Cream</h2>

<p>35 ml of double cream is roughly 0.15 cups (or just under 1/6 of a cup).

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>When working with double cream, even small measurement discrepancies can affect the texture and consistency of your dish.

A quick tip: for thicker liquids like double cream, always use a liquid measuring cup for the most accurate results.</p>  

<h2>How to Measure 35 ml of Double Cream</h2>  
<p>If you don’t have a measuring jug with millilitre markings, you can still measure 35 ml of double cream using standard cups. Since 1 cup equals 240 ml, 35 ml is approximately 0.15 cups. For easier visualisation, this is just under 1/6 of a cup. A tablespoon holds about 15 ml, so 35 ml would be roughly 2 tablespoons plus 1 teaspoon.</p>

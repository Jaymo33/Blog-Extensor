<p>75g of crushed garlic equals approximately 2.65 ounces. Whether you're prepping a marinade or seasoning a dish for your air fryer, accurate measurements ensure the best results. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we know how crucial precise conversions are for cooking success. Let’s break down the details so you never second-guess your garlic measurements again.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Garlic Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of crushed garlic can make or break a dish. Too little, and your meal lacks depth; too much, and it overpowers other flavours. For air fryer recipes, where ingredients cook quickly, balance is key. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> helps streamline this process, so you spend less time calculating and more time cooking. Whether you're making garlic bread or a stir-fry, 75g of crushed garlic (2.65 oz) delivers the perfect punch.</p>  

<p>Garlic’s potency varies depending on whether it’s fresh, minced, or crushed. Crushed garlic releases more oils, intensifying its flavour. That’s why measuring 75g precisely ensures consistency. If you’re adapting a recipe from grams to ounces, this conversion eliminates guesswork. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a> for dishes where garlic shines, like roasted vegetables or crispy chicken wings.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure 75g of Crushed Garlic</h3>  
<p>For accuracy, use a digital kitchen scale set to grams. Scoop the crushed garlic into a bowl until it hits 75g, then switch the scale to ounces to see the equivalent (2.65 oz). No scale? Roughly 3 tablespoons of crushed garlic equal 75g, but scales are more reliable. Prepping ingredients like this ensures your air fryer meals are flavourful every time.</p>  

<h2>Common Recipes Using 75g Crushed Garlic</h2>  
<p>Many air fryer recipes benefit from 75g of crushed garlic. Try it in garlic butter shrimp or a herb-infused roast lamb. For vegetarian options, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable category</a> features garlic-roasted mushrooms and crispy potatoes. Since 75g converts to 2.65 oz, you can easily adjust US or UK recipes without hassle.</p>  

<p>Garlic’s versatility makes it a staple in cuisines worldwide. Whether you’re making a quick stir-fry or marinating meat, 75g (2.65 oz) of crushed garlic adds robust flavour. Need cleaning tips after cooking? Our guide to <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer maintenance</a> keeps your appliance in top shape.</p>  

<h3>Converting Other Garlic Measurements</h3>  
<p>If a recipe calls for minced instead of crushed garlic, note that 75g of minced garlic is slightly less dense. For minced garlic, 75g equals about 2.5 oz. Always adjust based on the recipe’s requirements. Bookmark our conversion tools at <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> for quick reference.</p>

<p>2.5 cups of ginger paste equals approximately 20 ounces (or 567 grams) in UK measurements. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precision ensures the best texture and flavour. Whether you’re making marinades, sauces, or stir-fries, knowing the exact weight of ginger paste helps avoid over or under-seasoning. For more air fryer measurement tips, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate ginger paste measurements matter</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of ginger paste can make or break your dish. Too little, and the flavour falls flat; too much, and it overpowers other ingredients. In air fryer cooking, where heat circulates intensely, balanced seasoning is key. Ginger paste adds depth to dishes like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>air fryer chicken</a> or <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>roasted vegetables</a>. Measuring by weight (ounces) is more reliable than volume (cups), especially for thick pastes.</p>  

<h3>How to measure ginger paste correctly</h3>  
<p>For the most accurate conversion, use a kitchen scale set to ounces. Scoop the ginger paste into a measuring cup, then level it off with a straight edge. If you don’t have a scale, remember that 1 cup of ginger paste is roughly 8 ounces. This method works well for recipes on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>our recipe hub</a>, ensuring consistent results.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for ginger paste in air fryers</h2>  
<p>Ginger paste is a versatile ingredient that shines in air fryer cooking. It’s perfect for marinades, glazes, and even baking. Try it in <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/salmon>air fryer salmon</a> or as a base for stir-fry sauces. Since air fryers cook quickly, the paste’s concentrated flavour infuses dishes without burning. For sticky residues, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning guide</a> keeps your appliance spotless.</p>  

<h3>Adjusting recipes for different ginger paste brands</h3>  
<p>Not all ginger pastes have the same consistency. Some are thicker, while others are more watery. If your paste is runny, reduce the liquid elsewhere in the recipe. For thicker pastes, add a splash of water to help it blend evenly. Always taste-test before cooking, especially when trying new brands.</p>  

<h2>Storing ginger paste for air fryer meals</h2>  
<p>To keep ginger paste fresh, store it in an airtight container in the fridge. It lasts up to 3 weeks, making it ideal for <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/meal-prep>meal prep</a>. You can also freeze it in ice cube trays for portioned use. When ready to cook, thaw a cube and add it directly to your air fryer dishes for instant flavour.</p>

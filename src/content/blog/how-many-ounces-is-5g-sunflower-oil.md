<p>5g of sunflower oil equals approximately 0.18 ounces. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements can make or break a dish. Whether you’re frying, baking, or roasting, knowing how to convert grams to ounces ensures consistency in your cooking. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we understand the importance of accurate measurements for perfect results every time.</p>  

<h2>Why Convert 5g of Sunflower Oil to Ounces?</h2>  
<p>Many air fryer recipes, especially those from the UK, use metric measurements like grams. However, some cooks prefer working with ounces for convenience. Converting 5g of sunflower oil to ounces (0.18 oz) helps streamline your cooking process. This is particularly useful when following international recipes or using kitchen scales that display ounces. For more conversion tips, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>  

<p>Sunflower oil is a popular choice for air frying due to its high smoke point and neutral flavour. Whether you’re making crispy potatoes or golden chicken wings, measuring 5g of sunflower oil accurately ensures even cooking. If you’re new to air frying, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a> for inspiration.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure 5g of Sunflower Oil</h3>  
<p>To measure 5g of sunflower oil, use a digital kitchen scale set to grams. If your scale only displays ounces, aim for 0.18 oz. Alternatively, 5g of sunflower oil is roughly one teaspoon, though weighing is more precise. For sticky ingredients like oil, a small silicone bowl or measuring spoon can help avoid mess. Keep your air fryer clean with our recommended <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning tips</a>.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for 5g of Sunflower Oil in Air Fryers</h2>  
<p>5g of sunflower oil is often used to lightly coat vegetables, meats, or frozen foods before air frying. For example, tossing 5g of oil with diced potatoes ensures they crisp up perfectly. This small amount is ideal for recipes where excess oil isn’t needed, such as air-fried tofu or salmon. Browse our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable recipes</a> for low-oil cooking ideas.</p>  

<p>Another great use for 5g of sunflower oil is in baking. A light brush of oil on air fryer cakes or cookies prevents sticking without making them greasy. Since air fryers circulate hot air efficiently, you often need less oil than traditional methods.

<h3>Converting Other Amounts of Sunflower Oil</h3>  
<p>If your recipe calls for more or less than 5g of sunflower oil, the same conversion principle applies. For instance, 10g equals roughly 0.35 ounces, while 1g is about 0.04 ounces. Keeping a conversion chart handy saves time and reduces errors. Remember, air fryers are forgiving, but precise measurements help achieve the best texture and flavour.</p>

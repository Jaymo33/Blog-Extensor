<p>2.25 cups of lemon juice equals approximately 532.32 millilitres (ml). This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes, ensuring precise measurements for marinades, dressings, or baked goods. Whether you're following a British or American recipe, knowing how to convert cups to ml guarantees consistent results every time.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Precision is key when using an air fryer, as even small measurement discrepancies can affect texture and flavour. Lemon juice, often used in marinades or glazes, requires exact conversions to balance acidity. For example, a recipe from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> might call for 2.25 cups of lemon juice, and knowing the ml equivalent ensures perfection. Over-pouring can make dishes overly tart, while under-measuring may leave flavours dull.</p>  
<p>Air fryers circulate hot air rapidly, so ingredients like lemon juice evaporate faster than in conventional ovens. This makes accurate measurements even more critical. If you're adapting a recipe from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken dishes</a> or <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>desserts</a>, converting 2.25 cups of lemon juice to ml (532.32 ml) ensures the right consistency and taste.</p>

<h2>How to Convert 2.25 Cups of Lemon Juice to ml</h2>  
<p>Converting cups to millilitres is straightforward once you know the standard conversion rate. One US cup equals 236.588 ml, so 2.25 cups of lemon juice is calculated as 2.25 x 236.588 = 532.32 ml. For UK recipes, note that a UK cup is slightly larger (284 ml), but most modern recipes use the US standard.</p>  
<p>If you don’t have measuring cups, use a kitchen scale for precision. Lemon juice weighs roughly 240 grams per cup, so 2.25 cups would be 540 grams. However, ml remains the preferred unit for liquids in air fryer cooking. Bookmark <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>our conversion chart</a> for quick reference.</p>

<h3>Tools for Measuring Lemon Juice Accurately</h3>  
<p>A liquid measuring cup with ml markings is ideal for converting 2.25 cups of lemon juice to ml. Glass or plastic jugs with clear gradients help avoid spills and ensure precision. For smaller quantities, use a syringe or graduated pipette, especially when adding lemon juice to delicate recipes like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>air fryer cakes</a>.</p>

<h2>Common Uses for 2.25 Cups of Lemon Juice in Air Fryer Recipes</h2>  
<p>This quantity of lemon juice is often used in marinades for chicken or fish, providing enough acidity to tenderise and flavour proteins. For example, a citrus glaze for air-fried salmon might require 532.32 ml (2.25 cups) of lemon juice mixed with herbs. It’s also popular in desserts like lemon drizzle cake, where precise acidity balances sweetness.</p>  
<p>Another great use is in homemade cleaning solutions for your air fryer. Mix 2.25 cups (532.32 ml) of lemon juice with water to naturally degrease the basket. Check out <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>our cleaning guide</a> for more tips on maintaining your appliance.</p>

<h3>Adjusting Recipes for Personal Taste</h3>  
<p>While 2.25 cups of lemon juice equals 532.32 ml, you can tweak this based on preference. Reduce by 10-15% if you prefer milder citrus notes, especially in dishes like air-fried vegetables. Always taste-test marinades or batters before cooking to ensure the perfect balance.</p>

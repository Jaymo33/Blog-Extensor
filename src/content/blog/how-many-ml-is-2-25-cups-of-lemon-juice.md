<p>2.25 cups of lemon juice equals approximately 532.32 millilitres (ml). This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes, ensuring precise measurements for marinades, dressings, or baked goods. Whether you're following a British or American recipe, knowing how to convert cups to ml guarantees consistent results every time.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Precision is key when using an air fryer, as even small measurement discrepancies can affect texture and flavour. Lemon juice, often used in marinades or glazes, requires exact conversions to balance acidity. For example, a recipe from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> might call for 2.25 cups of lemon juice, and knowing the ml equivalent ensures perfection. Over-pouring can make dishes overly tart, while under-measuring may leave flavours dull.</p>  
<p>Air fryers circulate hot air rapidly, so ingredients like lemon juice evaporate faster than in conventional ovens. This makes accurate measurements even more critical. If you're adapting a recipe from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken dishes</a> or <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>desserts</a>, converting 2.25 cups of lemon juice to ml (532.32 ml) ensures the right consistency and taste.</p>

<h2>How to Convert 2.25 Cups of Lemon Juice to ml</h2>  
<p>Converting cups to millilitres is straightforward once you know the standard conversion rate. One US cup equals 236.588 ml, so 2.25 cups of lemon juice is calculated as 2.25 x 236.588 = 532.32 ml. For UK recipes, note that a UK cup is slightly larger (284 ml), but most modern recipes use the US standard.</p>  
<p>If you don’t have measuring cups, use a kitchen scale for precision. Lemon juice weighs roughly 240 grams per cup, so 2.25 cups would be 540 grams. However, ml remains the preferred unit for liquids in air fryer cooking.

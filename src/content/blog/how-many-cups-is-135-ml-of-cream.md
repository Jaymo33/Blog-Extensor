<p>135 ml of cream is approximately 0.57 cups in the UK or 0.57 cups in the US, making it just over half a standard cup. Whether you're whipping up a creamy sauce or baking a decadent dessert in your air fryer, knowing this conversion ensures precision. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we help simplify measurements so your dishes turn out perfectly every time.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Cream Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of cream can make or break a recipe. Too little, and your dish might lack richness; too much, and it could become overly heavy. For air fryer recipes, precise measurements ensure even cooking and perfect texture. Whether you're making a creamy pasta bake or a luscious dessert, 135 ml of cream is a common quantity in many recipes.</p>  

<p>If you're working with UK or US recipes, slight variations in cup sizes can affect your results. The good news is that 135 ml converts neatly to roughly 0.57 cups in both systems. For more conversions, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> to streamline your cooking process.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure 135 ml of Cream Without a Scale</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a measuring jug, you can use a standard tablespoon to measure 135 ml of cream. One tablespoon holds about 15 ml, so nine tablespoons will give you roughly 135 ml. Alternatively, a US cup is 240 ml, meaning 135 ml is just over half a cup. For UK bakers, a metric cup is 250 ml, so 135 ml is slightly less than 0.6 cups.</p>  

<h2>Converting 135 ml of Cream for Baking and Cooking</h2>  
<p>When adapting recipes for your air fryer, accurate conversions are key. Whether you're making a creamy mushroom sauce or a rich chocolate mousse, 135 ml of cream adds the perfect touch. If you're scaling a recipe up or down, remember that 135 ml is equivalent to about 0.57 cups in both UK and US measurements.</p>  

<p>For those who love baking, precise measurements ensure your cakes and desserts turn out light and fluffy. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipes section</a> for delicious ideas using 135 ml of cream. From air-fried cheesecakes to creamy pasta dishes, we’ve got plenty of inspiration.</p>  

<h3>Common Recipes Using 135 ml of Cream</h3>  
<p>Many air fryer recipes call for 135 ml of cream, including creamy soups, custards, and sauces. For example, a classic Alfredo sauce often requires this amount to achieve the perfect consistency. If you're making a dessert like crème brûlée, 135 ml of cream ensures a silky-smooth texture.</p>  

<h2>UK vs. US Cup Measurements for Cream</h2>  
<p>While the difference between UK and US cup sizes is minimal, it’s worth noting for precision. A UK metric cup is 250 ml, while a US cup is 240 ml. However, 135 ml converts to roughly 0.57 cups in both systems, making it an easy measurement to remember. This consistency simplifies cooking across different recipe sources.</p>  

<p>If you're unsure about other conversions, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a> is a handy tool. Whether you're converting ml to cups or adjusting portion sizes, it’s a great resource for air fryer enthusiasts. For more tips, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert recipes</a> that often use cream.</p>  

<h3>Tips for Storing Leftover Cream</h3>  
<p>If your recipe only uses part of a cream carton, proper storage keeps it fresh. Transfer leftover cream to an airtight container and refrigerate for up to five days. For longer storage, freeze cream in ice cube trays—each cube holds about 30 ml, making it easy to measure 135 ml when needed.</p>

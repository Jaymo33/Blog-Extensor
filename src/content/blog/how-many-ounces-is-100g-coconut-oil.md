<h2>How to measure coconut oil for air frying</h2>
<p>Measuring coconut oil can be tricky since it changes state depending on temperature. At room temperature, it’s solid, but it melts when heated. To measure 100g (3.53 oz) accurately, use a kitchen scale for solids or a liquid measuring cup for melted oil. This ensures you get the exact amount needed for your air fryer recipes.</p>

<h3>Using a kitchen scale</h3>
<p>For solid coconut oil, place your container on the scale, tare it to zero, then add the oil until it reaches 100g. This method is the most accurate and avoids any guesswork. If your recipe calls for ounces, remember that 100g is roughly 3.53 ounces.

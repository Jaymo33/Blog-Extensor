<p>100g of coconut oil is approximately 3.53 ounces. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements can make or break your dish. Whether you're making crispy chicken or baking a cake, knowing how to convert grams to ounces ensures perfect results every time. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we understand the importance of accurate measurements in cooking.</p>

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air frying</h2>
<p>Using the right amount of coconut oil can affect the texture and flavour of your air-fried dishes. Too little oil, and your food may turn out dry; too much, and it could become greasy. Converting 100g of coconut oil to ounces (3.53 oz) helps you follow recipes precisely, especially those from international sources. Many air fryer recipes, like those in our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipes section</a>, rely on accurate measurements for consistent results.</p>

<p>Coconut oil is a popular choice for air frying due to its high smoke point and health benefits. Whether you're making roasted vegetables or crispy tofu, knowing that 100g equals 3.53 ounces ensures you use the right amount. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more handy measurement conversions.</p>

<h2>How to measure coconut oil for air frying</h2>
<p>Measuring coconut oil can be tricky since it changes state depending on temperature. At room temperature, it’s solid, but it melts when heated. To measure 100g (3.53 oz) accurately, use a kitchen scale for solids or a liquid measuring cup for melted oil. This ensures you get the exact amount needed for your air fryer recipes.</p>

<h3>Using a kitchen scale</h3>
<p>For solid coconut oil, place your container on the scale, tare it to zero, then add the oil until it reaches 100g. This method is the most accurate and avoids any guesswork. If your recipe calls for ounces, remember that 100g is roughly 3.53 ounces. For more tips on measuring ingredients, visit our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert recipes</a> section.</p>

<h3>Using measuring cups</h3>
<p>If you don’t have a scale, you can use measuring cups for melted coconut oil. Since 100g equals about 3.53 ounces, this translates to roughly 7 tablespoons. However, using a scale is always more precise, especially for baking recipes where exact measurements are crucial.</p>

<h2>Common uses for coconut oil in air frying</h2>
<p>Coconut oil is versatile and works well in many air fryer recipes. From crispy chicken to roasted vegetables, it adds a subtle sweetness and helps achieve a golden finish. Knowing that 100g is 3.53 ounces lets you adapt recipes easily, whether you’re cooking for one or meal prepping for the week.</p>

<p>For example, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipes</a> often use coconut oil for marinating or coating. The right amount ensures juicy, flavourful results without excess grease. Similarly, desserts like air-fried cakes or cookies benefit from precise measurements for perfect texture.</p>

<h2>Tips for storing and using coconut oil</h2>
<p>To keep your coconut oil fresh, store it in a cool, dark place. If it solidifies, gently warm it before measuring. Remember, 100g equals 3.53 ounces, so you can easily portion it for recipes.

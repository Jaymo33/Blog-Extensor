<p>1.75 cups of self-raising flour equals approximately 218 grams. This conversion is essential for baking, especially when using an air fryer, where precision ensures even cooking.

<h2>Why Accurate Flour Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Baking is a science, and even small measurement errors can affect texture and rise. Self-raising flour contains baking powder, so incorrect amounts can lead to overly dense or flat bakes. In an air fryer, where heat circulates rapidly, precise measurements ensure even cooking. For example, 1.75 cups of self-raising flour (218g) is ideal for a small batch of scones or muffins.

<p>Using a kitchen scale is the most reliable method, as cup measurements can vary based on how the flour is scooped. Fluffing the flour before spooning it into a cup helps, but weighing eliminates guesswork. For air fryer recipes, consistency is key—whether you're making a cake or coating chicken.

<h3>How to Measure 1.75 Cups of Self-Raising Flour</h3>  
<p>To measure 1.75 cups of self-raising flour, lightly spoon the flour into a measuring cup and level it off with a knife. Avoid packing the flour down, as this can add extra grams. For 218 grams, use a digital scale for accuracy. This method works perfectly for air fryer recipes like quick breads or batters.</p>  

<h2>Converting Cups to Grams for Different Flours</h2>  
<p>Not all flours weigh the same—1.75 cups of plain flour, for instance, is about 220 grams, while wholemeal flour is closer to 210 grams. Self-raising flour falls in the middle due to its added leavening agents. When adapting recipes for the air fryer, always check if the flour type affects cooking times.

<p>If you're scaling a recipe up or down, remember that 1.75 cups of self-raising flour (218g) is roughly equivalent to 7/8 of a standard UK 250g flour pack. For larger batches, double-check conversions to avoid waste. Air fryer baking is forgiving, but precise measurements guarantee the best results every time.</p>  

<h3>Common Uses for 1.75 Cups of Self-Raising Flour</h3>  
<p>This quantity is perfect for small-batch baking, such as 6–8 muffins or a single-layer cake. In the air fryer, it’s enough for a loaf of banana bread or a tray of scones. Since self-raising flour already contains raising agents, you won’t need extra baking powder.

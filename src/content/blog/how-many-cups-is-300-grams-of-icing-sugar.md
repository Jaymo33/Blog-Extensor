<p>300 grams of icing sugar is approximately 2.4 cups in the UK and 2.5 cups in the US. This conversion is essential for baking, especially when using an air fryer for desserts like cakes or cookies. Getting the measurement right ensures your recipes turn out perfectly every time.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Baking</h2>  
<p>Baking is a science, and precise measurements are crucial for success. Using too much or too little icing sugar can affect the texture and sweetness of your desserts. Whether you're making frosting for cupcakes or dusting a cake, knowing how many cups 300 grams of icing sugar equals ensures consistency. For more baking tips, check out <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes</a>.</p>  

<p>Different countries use different cup sizes, which can lead to confusion. In the UK, a standard cup holds 250ml, while in the US, it's 240ml. This slight difference means 300 grams of icing sugar converts to 2.4 UK cups or 2.5 US cups. Always double-check your measurements for the best results.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure Icing Sugar Correctly</h3>  
<p>For the most accurate measurement, use a kitchen scale to weigh 300 grams of icing sugar. If you don't have one, spoon the sugar into a measuring cup and level it off with a knife. Avoid packing the sugar down, as this can lead to over-measuring. For more conversion help, visit <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>our conversion chart</a>.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for 300 Grams of Icing Sugar</h2>  
<p>Icing sugar is a staple in many desserts, from buttercream frosting to dusting on top of cakes. Knowing how many cups 300 grams of icing sugar equals helps you scale recipes up or down. If you're baking in an air fryer, precise measurements ensure even cooking and perfect texture.</p>  

<p>For example, a classic vanilla cake might require 300 grams of icing sugar for the frosting. You could also use it to make glazes for cookies or doughnuts. Explore more dessert ideas at <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>our cake recipes</a>.</p>  

<h3>Converting Grams to Cups for Other Ingredients</h3>  
<p>While this guide focuses on icing sugar, it's helpful to know how to convert other ingredients too. Flour, sugar, and butter all have different densities, so their gram-to-cup ratios vary. Always refer to a reliable conversion chart or use a kitchen scale for accuracy.</p>  

<h2>Tips for Storing Icing Sugar</h2>  
<p>Keep your icing sugar fresh by storing it in an airtight container in a cool, dry place. Exposure to moisture can cause clumping, making it harder to measure. If your sugar does clump, sift it before use to ensure smooth, even results in your baking.</p>

<p>30g of vinegar equals approximately 1.06 ounces. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements can make or break your dish. Whether you're marinating chicken or whipping up a tangy glaze, knowing how to convert grams to ounces ensures perfect results every time.</p>

<h2>Why accurate vinegar measurements matter</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of vinegar in your air fryer recipes ensures balanced flavours and proper cooking. Too much vinegar can overpower your dish, while too little might leave it bland. For example, a <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>marinade recipe</a> calling for 30g of vinegar needs that exact tanginess to work. Air fryers cook quickly, so precise measurements help avoid soggy or overly dry results.</p>  

<p>Vinegar also plays a role in tenderising meats and adding acidity to balance rich flavours. If you’re preparing <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>air fryer chicken</a>, 30g of vinegar (1.06 oz) can enhance moisture without making the meat mushy. Always measure carefully for consistent, restaurant-quality results at home.</p>  

<h2>How to convert 30g vinegar to ounces</h2>

<h3>Tools for measuring vinegar</h3>  
<p>A digital kitchen scale is the most accurate way to measure 30g of vinegar. If you don’t have one, use a liquid measuring cup marked in ounces. Remember, 30g (1.06 oz) of vinegar is just under 2 tablespoons, but scales are best for precision.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for 30g of vinegar in air frying</h2>  
<p>From marinades to glazes, 30g of vinegar (1.06 oz) is a versatile ingredient. Try it in a honey-vinegar glaze for <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/salmon>air fryer salmon</a> or as part of a pickling liquid for quick-pickled veggies. The acidity helps crisp coatings while keeping proteins juicy.</p>

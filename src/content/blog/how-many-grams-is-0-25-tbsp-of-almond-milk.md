<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on even heat distribution, so ingredient ratios must be spot-on. Too much or too little almond milk can affect texture and cooking times. For example, adding 0.25 tbsp of almond milk (3.75g) to a batter ensures it stays light and fluffy. Precision is especially crucial for baking, where small deviations can lead to dry or dense results. Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> for dishes that benefit from exact measurements.</p>  

<p>Using a digital scale is the easiest way to measure 0.25 tbsp of almond milk in grams. Spoon measurements can vary, but grams provide consistency. If you're adapting a recipe from volume to weight, this conversion is a lifesaver. Almond milk’s low viscosity means it pours quickly, making scales more reliable than spoons.

<h3>How to measure 0.25 tbsp of almond milk without a scale</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a scale, use a measuring spoon and level it off with a knife. Almond milk’s consistency means it won’t mound like dry ingredients, so 0.25 tbsp should be fairly accurate. For recipes where precision is key, though, investing in a scale is worthwhile. A slight overpour could alter the outcome, especially in delicate dishes like soufflés or custards.

For example, a 0.25 tbsp (3.75g) addition to a coating helps it adhere better to chicken or tofu. It’s also handy for vegan baking, where dairy substitutes must be measured carefully.

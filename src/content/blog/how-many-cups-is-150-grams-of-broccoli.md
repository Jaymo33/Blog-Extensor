<p>150 grams of broccoli is roughly equivalent to 1.5 US cups or 1.25 UK cups when chopped. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes, where precise measurements can make or break your dish. Whether you’re making crispy broccoli bites or adding it to a stir-fry, knowing how many cups is 150 grams of broccoli ensures consistent results every time. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we focus on accurate conversions to simplify your cooking process. Let’s dive deeper into measuring broccoli for your air fryer.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Broccoli Measurements Matter in Air Frying</h2>
<p>Air fryers cook food quickly and evenly, but overcrowding or underfilling the basket can lead to uneven results. If you’re wondering how many cups is 150 grams of broccoli, it’s because portion control affects crispiness and cooking time. Too much broccoli can steam instead of roast, while too little may burn. For perfect air-fried broccoli, 150 grams (about 1.5 US cups) is ideal for a single layer in most standard baskets.

<p>Broccoli’s density also plays a role—florets vs. chopped pieces will yield slightly different cup measurements. Florets are more airy, so 150 grams might fill slightly more volume compared to tightly packed chopped broccoli. For recipes like our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable air fryer dishes</a>, we recommend weighing for accuracy. A kitchen scale eliminates guesswork, but if you’re using cups, fluff the broccoli lightly before measuring.</p>

<h2>Converting 150 Grams of Broccoli to Cups: UK vs. US</h2>
<p>In the UK, a standard cup holds 250ml, while a US cup is 240ml. This small difference means 150 grams of broccoli in cups isn’t identical across regions. For UK cooks, 150g equals approximately 1.25 UK cups; in the US, it’s closer to 1.5 cups. If your air fryer recipe originates from another country, always note which cup measurement it uses. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a> specifies measurements for hassle-free cooking.</p>

<h3>Tips for Measuring Broccoli Without a Scale</h3>
<p>If you don’t have a scale, use the “fluff and scoop” method for chopped broccoli. Gently loosen the pieces, then spoon them into a measuring cup without packing. Level off the top with a knife—this mimics the 150 grams to cups conversion more accurately. For florets, fill the cup just until the broccoli reaches the rim without pressing down. Remember, 150 grams of broccoli is roughly two medium-sized heads’ worth of florets.</p>

<h2>How Air Frying Affects Broccoli Volume</h2>
<p>Broccoli shrinks slightly when air-fried due to water loss, so 150 grams raw yields about 1 cup cooked. This is useful for meal prep—if a recipe calls for 150g raw, expect less volume post-cooking. To avoid overfilling your air fryer, always account for this shrinkage. For crispy results, toss your 150 grams of broccoli in oil and spread it evenly in the basket. Need cleaning tips post-cooking?

<h3>Common Recipes Using 150 Grams of Broccoli</h3>
<p>From stir-fries to cheesy bakes, 150 grams of broccoli is a versatile portion. Try it in air-fried tempura (1.5 US cups batter-dipped florets) or as a side with garlic oil (1.25 UK cups). For a low-carb twist, swap potatoes with 150g broccoli in your next air fryer hash. The key is adjusting cook times—smaller pieces crisp faster.

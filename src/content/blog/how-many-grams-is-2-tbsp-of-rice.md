<p>2 tablespoons (tbsp) of rice weigh approximately 30 grams in the UK. This measurement is based on standard UK tablespoons and uncooked long-grain white rice. If you're using an air fryer, knowing this conversion helps ensure your recipes turn out perfectly every time.</p>

<h2>Why accurate rice measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>
<p>Getting the right amount of rice is crucial for air fryer recipes. Too much rice can lead to uneven cooking, while too little might leave you hungry. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we recommend precise measurements for best results. Many of our popular <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer rice recipes</a> rely on this 2 tbsp to grams conversion.</p>
<p>Different types of rice can vary slightly in weight. Basmati rice, for example, might be a touch lighter than standard long-grain. However, 30 grams remains a reliable average for most cooking purposes. When preparing rice dishes in your air fryer, this measurement ensures consistent portion sizes and cooking times.</p>

<h2>How to measure 2 tbsp of rice accurately</h2>
<p>For perfect 30-gram portions every time, follow these simple steps. First, use a proper UK tablespoon measure - not a random spoon from your drawer. Level off the rice with the back of a knife for precision. If you're making multiple portions, consider weighing out larger quantities using our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>

<h3>Using kitchen scales for better accuracy</h3>
<p>While tablespoons work in a pinch, digital kitchen scales give you the most precise measurement. Simply place your bowl on the scale, tare it to zero, then add rice until you reach 30 grams. This method eliminates any guesswork and is especially helpful when adapting recipes from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/meal-prep>meal prep</a> plans to your air fryer.</p>

<h2>Converting other rice quantities to grams</h2>
<p>Once you know that 2 tbsp equals 30 grams, you can easily scale up or down. Need 4 tablespoons? That's 60 grams. Half a tablespoon would be about 7.5 grams. These conversions come in handy when adjusting portion sizes for different <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken and rice dishes</a> in your air fryer.</p>
<p>Remember that cooked rice weighs more than uncooked due to absorbed water. If a recipe calls for cooked rice by volume, you'll need to adjust accordingly. Our general rule is that 30 grams of uncooked rice yields about 90 grams when cooked - perfect for single servings in the air fryer.</p>

<h3>Rice measurement tips for perfect air fryer results</h3>
<p>Always fluff your rice before measuring to avoid compacted tablespoons. Store rice in an airtight container to maintain consistent moisture levels. For best results in your air fryer, consider pre-soaking rice for 20 minutes if the recipe allows - this helps achieve even cooking throughout.</p>

<h2>Common rice types and their weight variations</h2>
<p>While our 30-gram standard works for most white rice, some varieties differ slightly. Brown rice tends to be denser, with 2 tbsp weighing about 32 grams. Jasmine rice might be closer to 28 grams per 2 tbsp. When trying new <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable rice dishes</a>, it's worth checking specific weights.</p>
<p>Wild rice is the exception, with 2 tablespoons weighing approximately 25 grams due to its long, slender grains. If you're using specialty rices frequently, consider creating your own conversion chart tailored to your air fryer cooking style.

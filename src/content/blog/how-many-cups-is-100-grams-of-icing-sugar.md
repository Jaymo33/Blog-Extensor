<p>100 grams of icing sugar is roughly equivalent to 0.8 cups in the UK or 0.75 cups in the US. This conversion is essential for baking, especially when using an air fryer for desserts like cakes or cookies. Whether you're following a recipe from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> or adjusting measurements, knowing how to convert grams to cups ensures perfect results every time.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurement Matters</h2>  
<p>Baking is a science, and precise measurements are crucial for the right texture and taste. Too much or too little icing sugar can affect the consistency of frostings, glazes, or baked goods. For air fryer recipes, where space and heat distribution matter, accurate measurements prevent undercooked or overly dense results. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more handy baking tips.</p>  

<p>Icing sugar, also known as powdered sugar, is finer than granulated sugar, which means it packs differently in a cup. This is why weight measurements (grams) are often more reliable than volume (cups). If you're using an air fryer for desserts like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>cakes</a>, precision ensures even cooking and perfect sweetness.</p>  

<h3>UK vs. US Cup Measurements</h3>  
<p>In the UK, 100 grams of icing sugar equals about 0.8 cups, while in the US, it’s closer to 0.75 cups. This difference arises because UK cups are slightly larger (284ml) compared to US cups (240ml). Always check where your recipe originates to avoid measurement mishaps. For air fryer baking, consistency is key—whether you're making cookies or dusting <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>desserts</a>.</p>  

<h2>How to Measure Icing Sugar Correctly</h2>  
<p>The best way to measure 100 grams of icing sugar is by using a kitchen scale. If you don’t have one, lightly spoon the sugar into a measuring cup and level it off with a knife—never pack it down. This method prevents over-measuring, which can make frostings too thick or cakes overly sweet. For air fryer recipes, precise measurements ensure even browning and perfect texture.</p>  

<p>If you’re converting other ingredients, like flour or butter, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipes</a> section includes detailed guides. Remember, cleaning your air fryer after baking sugary treats is essential—check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning tips</a> to keep it in top condition.</p>  

<h3>Common Mistakes to Avoid</h3>  
<p>One of the biggest mistakes is scooping icing sugar directly from the bag with a cup, which compacts it and leads to excess. Another is confusing granulated sugar conversions with icing sugar—they weigh differently per cup. Always double-check your recipe’s measurement system (metric or imperial) to avoid errors, especially when baking in an air fryer.</p>

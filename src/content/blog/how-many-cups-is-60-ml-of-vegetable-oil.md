<h2>How to Measure 60 ml of Vegetable Oil Without a Scale</h2>  
<p>Not everyone has a kitchen scale, but most have measuring cups. To measure 60 ml of vegetable oil in cups, use a standard 1/4 cup measure—it’s the closest equivalent. If you don’t have one, a tablespoon can help: 4 tablespoons equal roughly 60 ml. This method works well for recipes like air-fryer brownies or crispy tofu.</p>  

<h3>UK vs. US Cup Measurements</h3>

Most air fryer recipes account for slight variations, so either measurement will work. For precise baking, stick to the 0.25 cup (60 ml) guideline.</p>

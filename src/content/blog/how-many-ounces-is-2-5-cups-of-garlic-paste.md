<p>2.5 cups of garlic paste equals approximately 20 ounces. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes, where precise measurements can make or break a dish. Whether you’re making marinades, sauces, or rubs, knowing the exact weight ensures consistent results every time. Garlic paste is a staple in many cuisines, and getting the measurement right is key to balancing flavours. For more air fryer tips, check out <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on even cooking, and incorrect measurements can lead to uneven results. Too much garlic paste might overpower a dish, while too little could leave it bland. Using 20 ounces for 2.5 cups ensures your recipes turn out perfectly every time. This is especially important for dishes like garlic butter shrimp or roasted vegetables, where flavour balance is crucial. Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipes</a> section for inspiration on using garlic paste in your air fryer.</p>  

<p>Garlic paste is denser than liquids like water, so volume-to-weight conversions aren’t always straightforward. A standard cup of garlic paste weighs around 8 ounces, making 2.5 cups equal to 20 ounces. This measurement is consistent across most brands, but checking the label for specific weights is always a good idea. For more conversions, refer to our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure Garlic Paste for Air Fryer Recipes</h3>  
<p>Using a kitchen scale is the most accurate way to measure garlic paste. Simply tare your scale with an empty container, then add the paste until it reaches 20 ounces. If you don’t have a scale, spoon the paste into a measuring cup, ensuring it’s level for accuracy. Avoid packing the paste down, as this can lead to over-measuring.

<h2>Common Uses for Garlic Paste in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Garlic paste is incredibly versatile and works well in marinades, sauces, and rubs. Try mixing it with olive oil and herbs for a quick marinade for chicken or tofu. It also adds depth to air-fried vegetables like Brussels sprouts or potatoes. For a flavour boost, stir a spoonful into dips or spreads. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipes</a> for ideas on incorporating garlic paste.</p>  

<p>Storing garlic paste properly ensures it stays fresh for future recipes. Keep it in an airtight container in the fridge, where it can last for weeks. You can also freeze it in ice cube trays for easy portioning. Just thaw a cube when you need it for your next air fryer dish. For more storage tips, see our guide on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>keeping your air fryer clean</a>.</p>  

<h3>Adjusting Recipes for Different Garlic Paste Brands</h3>  
<p>Not all garlic pastes have the same consistency, so adjustments may be needed. Thicker pastes might require slightly less volume to reach 20 ounces, while thinner ones could need more. Always taste and adjust seasonings as you cook to ensure the perfect balance. Experimenting with small batches is a great way to find what works best for your air fryer recipes.</p>

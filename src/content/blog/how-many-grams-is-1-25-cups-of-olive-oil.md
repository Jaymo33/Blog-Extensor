<h2>How to Measure 1.25 Cups of Olive Oil Correctly</h2>
<p>Measuring liquids like olive oil can be tricky, especially when converting between cups and grams. To measure 1.25 cups of olive oil accurately, use a liquid measuring cup with clear markings.

<h3>Common Mistakes When Measuring Olive Oil</h3>
<p>One of the most common mistakes is using a dry measuring cup for liquids like olive oil. Dry cups can’t account for the meniscus (the curve at the top of the liquid), leading to inaccurate measurements. Another pitfall is eyeballing the amount, which can result in using too much or too little oil. For air fryer cooking, where even small deviations can affect the outcome, it’s best to stick to the exact 270 grams for 1.25 cups of olive oil.</p>

<h2>Converting Other Olive Oil Measurements</h2>
<p>While 1.25 cups of olive oil equals 270 grams, you might need other conversions for different recipes. For example, 1 cup of olive oil is roughly 216 grams, and half a cup is about 108 grams. These conversions are handy when scaling recipes up or down.

<h3>Tips for Using Olive Oil in Your Air Fryer</h3>

<h3>How to measure 0.25 tbsp of sesame oil accurately</h3>
<p>Measuring small quantities like 0.25 tbsp of sesame oil can be tricky without the right tools.

Alternatively, a digital kitchen scale set to grams will give you the most accurate result – just tare the scale with your container and pour until it reads 3.7 grams.</p>

<h2>Converting other sesame oil quantities</h2>
<p>If your recipe calls for a different amount of sesame oil, here are some common conversions: 0.5 tbsp equals 7.4 grams, 1 tbsp equals 14.8 grams, and 2 tbsp equals 29.6 grams. These conversions are particularly helpful when scaling recipes up or down for your air fryer. Remember that sesame oil is denser than some other oils, so volume-to-weight conversions aren’t always straightforward.</p>

<p>150g of tomato paste equals approximately 5.29 ounces. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes, where precise measurements can make or break a dish. Whether you're making a rich pasta sauce or a flavourful marinade, knowing the exact weight ensures consistency. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we focus on accuracy to help you achieve restaurant-quality results at home. Let’s dive deeper into why this conversion matters and how to use it in your cooking.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate conversions matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on precise measurements to deliver even cooking and perfect textures. Too much or too little tomato paste can alter the moisture content and flavour balance of your dish. For example, a <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>spicy tomato chicken recipe</a> might turn out overly dry if the tomato paste measurement is off. By converting 150g of tomato paste to ounces correctly, you ensure your meals are consistently delicious.</p>  

<p>Many UK recipes use grams, while others reference ounces, so having a reliable conversion chart is invaluable.

Whether you’re cooking <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>roasted vegetables</a> or a hearty stew, accurate measurements save time and reduce waste.</p>  

<h2>How to measure 150g of tomato paste without scales</h2>  
<p>Not everyone has a kitchen scale, but there are easy ways to estimate 150g of tomato paste. A standard tablespoon holds about 15g, so 10 tablespoons will give you roughly 150g. Alternatively, a small tin of tomato paste in the UK typically contains 170g, so using just under the whole tin will get you close. For more precision, consider investing in a digital scale—it’s a game-changer for air fryer cooking.</p>  

<h3>Using tomato paste in air fryer recipes</h3>

For a quick <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>air fryer chicken recipe</a>, mix 150g (5.29 oz) of tomato paste with herbs and olive oil for a rich glaze.

<h2>Common mistakes when converting grams to ounces</h2>  
<p>One frequent error is confusing fluid ounces with weight ounces—tomato paste is measured by weight, not volume. Another pitfall is rounding conversions too aggressively; 150g is closer to 5.29 oz than 5.3 oz, which can affect delicate recipes. Always double-check your measurements, especially when adapting recipes from international sources.

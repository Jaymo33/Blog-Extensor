<p>118°C in a fan oven converts to approximately 130°C in a conventional oven. This slight temperature adjustment ensures your dishes cook evenly without drying out or burning. Understanding this conversion is crucial for adapting recipes designed for fan ovens to work in traditional ovens.</p>

<h2>Why Fan Oven Temperatures Differ</h2>
<p>Fan ovens circulate hot air constantly, cooking food faster and more evenly than conventional ovens. This means you typically need to reduce the temperature by 10-20°C when using a fan oven. The reverse is true when converting from fan to conventional - you'll need to increase the temperature slightly. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we recommend always checking conversions to ensure perfect results.</p>
<p>For 118 fan oven to conventional oven conversion specifically, the 10°C increase accounts for the slower heat distribution in traditional ovens. This adjustment helps maintain similar cooking times and prevents undercooked food. Many baking recipes at <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>our recipe collection</a> include both temperature settings for convenience.</p>

<h2>How to Apply This Conversion</h2>
<p>When converting 118 fan oven to celsius for a conventional oven, simply add 10-12°C to get the equivalent temperature. This means 118°C fan becomes 130°C conventional. The same principle applies when converting other temperatures - always adjust upwards when moving from fan to conventional.</p>
<p>For best results, combine this temperature adjustment with careful monitoring of cooking times. Conventional ovens may require slightly longer cooking than fan ovens, so check your food 5-10 minutes before the recipe suggests. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a> includes timing adjustments for different dish types.</p>

<h3>Special Considerations for Baking</h3>
<p>When baking cakes or pastries at 118 c fan oven to normal oven settings, the temperature conversion is particularly important. Baked goods are sensitive to heat changes, and the extra 10°C helps achieve proper rise and texture. For delicate items like soufflés or meringues, consider using an oven thermometer to verify accuracy.</p>

<h3>Adapting Air Fryer Recipes</h3>
<p>Interestingly, 118 fan oven to air fryer equivalent temperatures follow similar principles. Air fryers cook even faster than fan ovens, typically requiring a 20°C reduction from conventional oven temperatures. This means a recipe calling for 130°C conventional would use 110°C in an air fryer. Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>cake recipes</a> for temperature-adjusted baking ideas.</p>

<h2>Common Conversion Mistakes</h2>
<p>One frequent error is forgetting to adjust cooking times along with temperatures when doing 118 fan oven to traditional oven conversions. While the temperature difference is modest, it can affect how quickly food cooks. Another mistake is assuming all ovens are calibrated perfectly - using an independent thermometer helps verify actual temperatures.</p>
<p>Remember that 118 c convection to normal oven conversions may vary slightly between oven models. Factors like oven size, insulation, and age can influence how heat distributes. For consistent results, keep notes on how your particular oven performs with different temperature adjustments.</p>

<p>2.25 cups of brown sugar equals approximately 450 grams. This conversion is essential for accurate baking, especially when using an air fryer where precise measurements can make or break a recipe.

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Baking</h2>  
<p>Baking is a science, and even small measurement discrepancies can affect texture and taste. Brown sugar, whether light or dark, packs differently than granulated sugar, so volume-to-weight conversions are crucial. Air fryer recipes, like those on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, often require precise ratios for even cooking. Using grams eliminates guesswork, especially for international recipes. A kitchen scale is a baker’s best friend for perfect results every time.</p>

<p>For example, 2.25 cups of brown sugar in grams (450g) ensures your air fryer desserts bake evenly. Too much sugar can cause over-browning or uneven texture. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for other common ingredient swaps. Whether you're making sticky toffee pudding or spiced muffins, accuracy is key.</p>

<h3>How to Measure Brown Sugar Correctly</h3>  
<p>To measure 2.25 cups of brown sugar, spoon it into a measuring cup and level it off without packing too tightly. For grams, use a digital scale for precision. If your recipe calls for 450 grams, you’ll know exactly how much to use. This method works for both UK and US measurements, though slight regional differences may exist.

<h2>Converting Cups to Grams for Air Fryer Recipes</h2>  
<p>Air fryers cook faster than conventional ovens, so ingredient ratios must be spot-on. Converting 2.25 cups of brown sugar to grams (450g) helps avoid under- or over-sweetening. This is especially important for recipes like air fryer brownies or caramelised fruit. Visit <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> for recipes tested with gram measurements. Remember, 1 cup of brown sugar typically weighs 200 grams, so 2.25 cups is roughly 450 grams.</p>

<p>For sticky ingredients like brown sugar, weighing eliminates compacting errors. If you’re adapting a traditional recipe for the air fryer, gram conversions ensure success.

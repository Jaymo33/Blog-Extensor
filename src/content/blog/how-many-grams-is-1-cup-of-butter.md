<h2>Why Convert Cups to Grams?</h2>

<p>Many UK and US recipes use different measurement systems, which can be confusing. For example, a US cup is 240ml, while a UK cup is 250ml. However, butter measurements are standardised by weight, so 1.0 cups of butter in grams remains consistent. This makes grams the most reliable unit for air fryer cooking, where precision matters. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a> for gram-based air fryer dishes.</p>  

<h3>UK vs. US Butter Measurements</h3>  
<p>While the gram equivalent of 1.0 cups of butter is the same (227g), butter packaging differs between the UK and US. In the UK, butter is often sold in 250g blocks, while US sticks are 113g each (so 1.0 cups = 2 sticks). If you're using an air fryer, weighing butter ensures you never over or under-measure, which could affect browning or crispiness.

<h2>How to Measure 1.0 Cups of Butter Accurately</h2>  
<p>To measure 1.0 cups of butter in grams, use kitchen scales for precision. Softened butter can be pressed into a measuring cup, but for best results, weigh it instead. If your recipe calls for melted butter, measure it solid first (227g), then melt it. This avoids inaccuracies from air pockets or uneven melting. Air fryer recipes, like those on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, often specify grams because theyâ€™re more reliable than volume measurements.</p>  

<p>For those without scales, 1.0 cups of butter equals 16 tablespoons or 48 teaspoons. However, these conversions are less precise than weighing. When adapting oven recipes for air fryers, gram measurements help maintain the intended texture and cooking time. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning guide</a> also highlights why accurate butter measurements prevent messy spills in your air fryer basket.</p>

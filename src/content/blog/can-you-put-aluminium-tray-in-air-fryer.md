<p>Yes, you can use aluminium trays in most air fryers, but with important precautions. The key concern isn't melting (aluminium's melting point is 660°C, far above air fryer temperatures) but rather airflow disruption and potential scratching of non-stick surfaces. At airfryerrecipe.co.uk, we recommend following manufacturer guidelines for your specific model.</p>

<h2>Understanding Air Fryer Safety with Aluminium</h2>
<p>Aluminium trays are commonly used in conventional ovens, but air fryers operate differently. The rapid air circulation technology requires unobstructed airflow for even cooking. When using an aluminium tray, ensure it doesn't cover more than half the basket area. Many UK air fryer users successfully reheat leftovers in aluminium trays, especially when following our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for temperature adjustments.</p>
<p>The material itself won't catch fire in normal use - air fryers typically max out at 200°C. However, very thin foil trays might warp under intense heat. For Ninja air fryers and similar models, shallow trays work better than deep ones to maintain proper air circulation. Always check your manual, as some premium brands explicitly prohibit aluminium use.</p>

<h2>Practical Tips for Using Aluminium Trays</h2>
<p>If you decide to use an aluminium tray, these practices will minimise risks. First, opt for heavier-gauge trays rather than flimsy takeaway containers. Second, position the tray towards the centre, leaving at least 2cm clearance on all sides. Third, consider perforating the tray bottom with a fork to improve airflow - this technique works particularly well for <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/potatoes>roast potatoes</a> and other starchy foods.</p>

<h3>When to Avoid Aluminium Completely</h3>
<p>Certain scenarios warrant avoiding aluminium trays altogether. Acidic foods like tomatoes or citrus can react with aluminium, affecting taste. For these, we recommend the ceramic inserts available at <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/accessories>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>. Also avoid aluminium when cooking small items that might stick to the tray's surface - a light oil spray helps but isn't foolproof.</p>

<h2>Alternative Solutions for Air Fryer Cooking</h2>
<p>If you're concerned about aluminium trays, several safer alternatives exist. Silicone baking mats designed for air fryers provide excellent non-stick surfaces. Oven-safe glass or ceramic dishes work well for recipes requiring containers, like our popular <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>air fryer desserts</a>. For easy cleanup without aluminium, consider investing in a dedicated <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaning kit</a>.</p>
<p>Paper baking cups offer another aluminium-free option for muffins or individual portions. Just ensure they're secured properly to prevent flying in the airflow. Many UK supermarkets now stock air fryer-specific accessories that eliminate the aluminium tray debate entirely.</p>

<h3>Manufacturer Recommendations Vary</h3>
<p>Popular UK brands have differing stances on aluminium tray use. Ninja officially approves shallow trays, while Philips advises against all metal containers. Always check your model's manual - some void warranties if damage occurs from unauthorised accessories. When in doubt, stick to approved accessories from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> for guaranteed compatibility.</p>

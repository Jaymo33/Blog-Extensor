<p>85 ml of heavy cream is approximately 0.36 cups in the US measurement system and roughly 0.3 cups in the UK. Whether you're whipping up a dessert or adding richness to a sauce, knowing this conversion ensures your recipes turn out just right. Heavy cream is a staple in many dishes, from air fryer cakes to creamy pasta, so getting the measurement spot-on matters.

<h2>Understanding Heavy Cream Measurements</h2>  
<p>Heavy cream, also known as double cream in the UK, is thicker and richer than regular milk. When converting 85 ml of heavy cream to cups, it’s important to note that US and UK cup sizes differ slightly. In the US, 1 cup equals 240 ml, while in the UK, it’s 284 ml. This means 85 ml translates to roughly 0.36 US cups or 0.3 UK cups. If you're using an air fryer for baking, precise measurements like these can make all the difference.</p>  

<p>For those who love baking, heavy cream adds moisture and richness to cakes, muffins, and even air fryer desserts. If you're unsure about conversions, a handy <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> can save time. Whether you're making a creamy sauce or a fluffy dessert, measuring 85 ml of heavy cream correctly ensures consistency. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert recipes</a> for inspiration.</p>  

<h3>Why Accurate Measurements Matter</h3>  
<p>Using the right amount of heavy cream can affect texture and taste. Too little, and your dish might lack richness; too much, and it could become overly dense. For air fryer cooking, where precision is key, measuring 85 ml of heavy cream correctly ensures even cooking. If you're preparing a batch of scones or a creamy pasta bake, this small detail makes a big difference.</p>  

<h2>Converting 85 ml of Heavy Cream for Baking</h2>  
<p>Baking is a science, and measurements need to be exact. If a recipe calls for 85 ml of heavy cream, knowing the cup equivalent helps streamline the process. In the US, 0.36 cups is just over a third of a cup, while in the UK, it’s slightly less. For air fryer baking, where space is limited, getting the ratios right ensures even cooking and perfect results every time.</p>  

<p>Heavy cream is often used in air fryer desserts like cheesecakes or custards. If you're experimenting with new recipes, having a reliable conversion for 85 ml of heavy cream is essential.

<h3>Common Uses for 85 ml of Heavy Cream</h3>  
<p>This measurement is perfect for small batches of sauces, toppings, or single-serving desserts. Whether you're making a creamy garlic sauce for pasta or whipping up a small batch of frosting, 85 ml of heavy cream is a versatile quantity. In an air fryer, it’s ideal for recipes that require just enough richness without overwhelming the dish.</p>

<p>0.5 tbsp of molasses weighs approximately 10.5 grams. This measurement is essential for precise baking and cooking, especially when using an air fryer where accuracy can affect texture and flavour. Whether you're making sticky marinades, glazes, or desserts, knowing the exact weight ensures consistent results every time.</p>

<h2>Why measure molasses in grams?</h2>  
<p>Measuring molasses by weight (grams) rather than volume (tablespoons) eliminates inconsistencies caused by density or settling. Molasses is a thick, sticky syrup, and even a slight variation in measurement can impact your recipe. For air fryer cooking, where heat distribution is rapid, precise measurements help avoid overly sweet or dry outcomes.

<p>Many UK recipes now list ingredients in grams for reliability. If you’re adapting a family recipe or trying a new dish from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>our collection</a>, converting tablespoons to grams ensures you stay on track. Plus, digital scales are affordable and far more accurate than scooping molasses straight from the jar.</p>  

<h3>How to measure 0.5 tbsp of molasses accurately</h3>  
<p>Use a metric spoon set or a digital scale for precision. Lightly grease your measuring spoon with oil to help the molasses slide off cleanly. For sticky ingredients like molasses, weighing eliminates the hassle of scraping every last bit from the spoon. If scaling up, remember that 1 tbsp of molasses equals roughly 21 grams.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for molasses in air fryer recipes</h2>  
<p>Molasses adds depth to glazes for meats like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>air fryer chicken</a> or roasted vegetables. Its rich, caramelised flavour also enhances baked goods, such as gingerbread or sticky cakes. Because air fryers cook faster than conventional ovens, molasses-based sauces thicken quickly—another reason to measure carefully.</p>  

<p>For savoury dishes, blend 0.5 tbsp (10.5g) of molasses with soy sauce, garlic, and a splash of vinegar for a glossy glaze. Sweet treats like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>air fryer desserts</a> benefit from its moisture-retaining properties. Just avoid overloading recipes, as molasses can overpower other flavours if used excessively.</p>  

<h3>Tips for working with molasses</h3>  
<p>Store molasses in a cool, dark place to prevent crystallisation. If it hardens, warm the jar in hot water before measuring. Clean spills immediately—molasses can gum up air fryer baskets.

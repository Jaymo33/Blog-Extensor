<p>5 grams of marmalade equals approximately 0.18 ounces. This conversion is handy for air fryer recipes where precise measurements matter. Whether you’re glazing a cake or adding a sweet touch to your breakfast, knowing the exact weight ensures perfect results every time. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we love helping you get the details right for delicious meals.</p>  

<h2>Why Convert 5g of Marmalade to Ounces?</h2>  
<p>Many UK recipes use grams, but some kitchen scales or international recipes might list ounces instead. Converting 5g of marmalade to ounces (0.18 oz) ensures accuracy, especially when working with small quantities. Air fryer recipes, like those on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>our recipes page</a>, often need precise measurements for glazes or toppings. Marmalade’s sticky texture means even a slight variation can affect the final dish.</p>  

<p>If you’re preparing a dessert or marinade, knowing the exact conversion helps avoid waste. For example, a 5g marmalade to oz measurement might be needed for a glaze on an air-fried cake. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more handy tips.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure 5g of Marmalade Accurately</h3>  
<p>Using a digital kitchen scale is the easiest way to measure 5g of marmalade. If your scale displays ounces, it should show around 0.18 oz. For those without scales, a teaspoon can hold roughly 5g of marmalade, but it’s less precise. Sticky ingredients like marmalade can be tricky, so levelling off the spoon helps.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for 5g of Marmalade in Air Fryer Recipes</h2>  
<p>Small amounts of marmalade, like 5g (0.18 oz), are perfect for glazes, marinades, or sweetening dishes. Try brushing it over air-fried chicken for a sticky-sweet finish or mixing it into a dessert topping. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert recipes</a> often use marmalade for a citrusy kick.</p>  

<p>You might also use 5g of marmalade in a sauce for air-fried salmon or as a glaze for roasted vegetables. The key is precision—too much can overpower the dish. For more inspiration, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a>.</p>

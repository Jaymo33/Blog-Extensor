<h2>Understanding Heavy Cream Measurements</h2>
<p>Heavy cream, also known as double cream in the UK, is a staple in many recipes from sauces to desserts. When a recipe calls for 285 ml of heavy cream, you might wonder how that translates to cups. The answer depends on whether you're using UK or US measurements, as cup sizes differ slightly between the two systems. For most practical purposes, 1.2 cups (UK) or 1.19 cups (US) will work perfectly.</p>
<p>If you're preparing one of our delicious <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer dessert recipes</a>, getting this measurement right can make all the difference. Heavy cream adds richness and texture to dishes, so accurate measuring ensures your creations turn out exactly as intended. Remember that while these conversions are close approximations, for baking where precision matters, using a kitchen scale might be best.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Conversion Matters</h2>
<p>When converting 285 ml of heavy cream to cups, even small differences can affect your recipe's outcome. This is particularly important in air fryer cooking, where ingredient ratios directly impact texture and cooking times. Too much liquid can make batters runny, while too little might leave dishes dry.

<p>For those making creamy sauces or custards in their air fryer, knowing that 285 ml equals about 1.2 cups helps maintain the perfect consistency. This measurement is common in many recipes, especially when scaling up or down. Whether you're preparing a savory mushroom sauce from our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/mushrooms>mushroom recipe collection</a> or a sweet dessert, accurate conversions ensure success.</p>

<h3>UK vs US Cup Measurements</h3>
<p>It's worth noting that UK and US cups differ slightly - a UK cup is 284 ml while a US cup is 240 ml. This means 285 ml of heavy cream is 1.2 UK cups or 1.19 US cups. While the difference seems small, it can matter in precise baking recipes. Most modern UK recipes use metric measurements, but if you're using an older cookbook or American recipe, being aware of this distinction helps.</p>

<h2>Practical Tips for Measuring Heavy Cream</h2>
<p>When measuring 285 ml of heavy cream, using a liquid measuring cup with clear markings is ideal. Pour the cream to the 285 ml line, or if using cups, fill just slightly over the 1 cup mark for UK measurements. For sticky ingredients like cream, spraying your measuring cup with a bit of <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner</a> first can help it pour out completely.</p>

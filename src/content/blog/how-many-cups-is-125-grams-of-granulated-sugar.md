<p>125 grams of granulated sugar equals approximately 0.63 cups in the UK and 0.6 cups in the US. Getting this conversion right is essential for baking, especially when using an air fryer for cakes, cookies, or desserts. Whether you're following a recipe from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> or adjusting measurements, knowing how to convert grams to cups ensures consistent results.</p>  

<h2>Understanding Granulated Sugar Measurements</h2>  
<p>Granulated sugar is a staple in baking, but its density can vary slightly depending on how it's packed. In the UK, 125 grams of granulated sugar is roughly 0.63 cups, while in the US, it's closer to 0.6 cups. This difference arises because UK and US cup measurements aren’t identical—a UK cup is 250ml, whereas a US cup is 240ml. If you're using an air fryer for recipes like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>cakes or cookies</a>, precision matters.</p>  

<p>For best results, use a digital kitchen scale to weigh your sugar. If you don’t have one, lightly spoon the sugar into a measuring cup and level it off with a knife. Avoid packing it down, as this can lead to using more sugar than intended. Whether you're baking a classic sponge or trying a new <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert recipe</a>, accurate measurements ensure the perfect texture and sweetness.</p>  

<h3>Why Accuracy Matters in Air Fryer Baking</h3>  
<p>Air fryers cook food faster and more evenly than conventional ovens, so ingredient ratios are crucial. Too much sugar can cause over-browning or uneven cooking, while too little can affect taste and texture. If you're converting a traditional recipe for your air fryer, check our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for guidance on adjustments.</p>  

<h2>Converting 125 Grams of Granulated Sugar for Different Recipes</h2>  
<p>Whether you're making a Victoria sponge or chocolate chip cookies, 125 grams of granulated sugar is a common measurement. In UK recipes, this amount translates to just over half a cup (0.63 cups), while in US recipes, it's slightly less (0.6 cups). If your recipe calls for 125g and you're using cups, always check whether it's a UK or US measurement to avoid mistakes.</p>  

<p>For air fryer baking, consistency is key. If you're scaling a recipe up or down, remember that 125 grams of granulated sugar is equivalent to about 10 tablespoons. This can be handy if you're making smaller batches or experimenting with new flavours. Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>cake recipes</a> to put your measurements to the test.</p>  

<h3>Tips for Measuring Sugar Without a Scale</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a scale, use the spoon-and-level method for accuracy. Scoop granulated sugar into your measuring cup with a spoon, then level it off with a straight edge. Avoid tapping or packing the sugar, as this can add extra grams. For sticky or clumpy sugar, break up any lumps before measuring to ensure an even distribution in your batter or dough.</p>  

<h2>Common Mistakes When Measuring Sugar</h2>  
<p>One of the biggest mistakes is using the wrong type of cup measurement. A US cup holds 240ml, while a UK cup holds 250ml—this small difference can affect your recipe. Another error is packing sugar into the cup, which increases the weight. Always measure sugar lightly for the most accurate results, especially when adapting recipes for your air fryer.</p>  

<p>Using outdated or incorrect conversion charts can also lead to mistakes. Always refer to reliable sources like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> for accurate measurements. If you're unsure, weigh your sugar instead of relying on volume measurements. This is particularly important for delicate bakes like meringues or soufflés, where precision is crucial.</p>  

<h3>How to Adjust Recipes for Air Fryer Baking</h3>  
<p>Air fryers cook faster and at higher temperatures, so sugar-heavy recipes may need slight adjustments. Reduce cooking times by 20-30% and keep an eye on browning. If your recipe calls for 125 grams of granulated sugar, consider lowering it slightly if you're new to air fryer baking, as sugars caramelise quickly in this appliance.</p>

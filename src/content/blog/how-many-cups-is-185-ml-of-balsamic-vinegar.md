<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on precise ingredient ratios to achieve the perfect texture and flavour. Too much or too little balsamic vinegar can throw off the balance of your recipe.

<h3>How to Measure 185 ml of Balsamic Vinegar Without a Measuring Cup</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a measuring cup, you can use a kitchen scale for precision. Since balsamic vinegar has a similar density to water, 185 ml weighs about 185 grams. Alternatively, a tablespoon holds around 15 ml, so 185 ml is roughly 12 tablespoons plus a teaspoon. This method works well for smaller quantities in air fryer recipes.</p>

<h3>Common Mistakes When Measuring Balsamic Vinegar</h3>

<h2>Tips for Storing and Using Balsamic Vinegar</h2>  
<p>Once opened, store balsamic vinegar in a cool, dark place to preserve its flavour. If you’ve measured out 185 ml for a recipe but don’t use it all, transfer the remainder to an airtight container. This prevents oxidation, which can alter the taste.

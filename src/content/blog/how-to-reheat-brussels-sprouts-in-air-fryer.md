<p>To reheat Brussels sprouts in an air fryer, set the temperature to 180°C (350°F) and cook for 3–5 minutes until crispy and heated through. This method restores their texture far better than a microwave, keeping them from turning soggy. Whether you have leftovers from last night’s roast or pre-cooked sprouts from the fridge, your air fryer can revive them perfectly.

<h2>Why Reheat Brussels Sprouts in an Air Fryer?</h2>  
<p>Reheating Brussels sprouts in an air fryer ensures they stay crispy instead of becoming mushy like in a microwave. The circulating hot air crisps the outer leaves while warming the centre evenly. This method works great for roasted, sautéed, or even steamed sprouts. If you love meal prep, air frying is the best way to refresh your veggies.

<p>Another advantage is speed—most air fryers reheat Brussels sprouts in under five minutes. Unlike an oven, which requires preheating, an air fryer heats up quickly, making it ideal for busy weeknights. Plus, you won’t need extra oil, keeping your reheated sprouts healthy. For perfect results every time, follow our temperature and timing guide below.</p>  

<h3>Best Temperature for Reheating Brussels Sprouts</h3>  
<p>The ideal temperature to reheat Brussels sprouts in an air fryer is 180°C (350°F). This ensures they crisp up without burning. If your sprouts were previously roasted with oil, they may need less time, while steamed sprouts might take a minute longer. Adjust based on your air fryer model—some run hotter than others.

<h2>Step-by-Step Reheating Instructions</h2>  
<p>First, preheat your air fryer to 180°C (350°F) for 2–3 minutes. Spread the Brussels sprouts in a single layer in the basket—overcrowding will steam them instead of crisping. Cook for 3 minutes, shake the basket, then check for doneness. If needed, add another 1–2 minutes. For extra crispiness, spritz lightly with oil before reheating.</p>  

<p>Leftover Brussels sprouts from the fridge may need an extra minute since they’re colder. If reheating a large batch, work in smaller portions for even results. Always let them cool slightly before serving—they’ll be piping hot! For more air fryer reheating tips, explore <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>our recipe collection</a>.</p>  

<h3>How to Prevent Drying Out</h3>  
<p>To keep reheated Brussels sprouts from drying out, avoid overcooking. Check them at the 3-minute mark—if they’re already hot, remove them immediately. A light mist of water or oil can help retain moisture. If your sprouts were originally cooked with bacon or cheese, cover them loosely with foil to prevent burning.</p>  

<h2>Common Mistakes to Avoid</h2>  
<p>One mistake is reheating Brussels sprouts straight from frozen—they’ll turn out soggy. Always thaw them first or cook from fresh. Another error is skipping the preheat, which leads to uneven heating. Also, avoid stacking sprouts in the basket; space them out for maximum crispiness.

<p>Using too high a temperature can burn the outer leaves before the inside warms. Stick to 180°C unless your air fryer runs cool. Finally, don’t forget to shake the basket—this ensures all sides crisp evenly. With these tips, your reheated sprouts will taste just like fresh!</p>

<p>1.5 tablespoons (tbsp) of lime juice equals approximately 22.5 grams (g). This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements can make or break a dish.

<h2>Why measuring lime juice in grams matters</h2>  
<p>Using grams instead of tablespoons for lime juice ensures consistency, especially in air fryer cooking where even small variations can affect texture and flavour. For example, a marinade with too much lime juice might overpower the dish, while too little could leave it bland. Grams provide a universal measurement, eliminating discrepancies caused by how tightly packed or loosely poured your tablespoons are.

If you don’t have a scale, remember that 1 tbsp of lime juice is roughly 15g, so 1.5 tbsp would be 22.5g.

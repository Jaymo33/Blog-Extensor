<p>1.5 tablespoons (tbsp) of lime juice equals approximately 22.5 grams (g). This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements can make or break a dish. Whether you’re marinating chicken, whipping up a citrusy dessert, or adding a tangy twist to vegetables, knowing the exact weight ensures consistency. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we focus on accuracy to help you achieve perfect results every time.</p>  

<h2>Why measuring lime juice in grams matters</h2>  
<p>Using grams instead of tablespoons for lime juice ensures consistency, especially in air fryer cooking where even small variations can affect texture and flavour. For example, a marinade with too much lime juice might overpower the dish, while too little could leave it bland. Grams provide a universal measurement, eliminating discrepancies caused by how tightly packed or loosely poured your tablespoons are. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for other common ingredient conversions.</p>  

<p>Many UK recipes, especially those for air fryers, list ingredients in grams for precision. If you’re adapting a recipe from another source, converting 1.5 tbsp of lime juice to grams (22.5g) ensures you stay on track. This is particularly useful for baking or making sauces where balance is key. For more recipe ideas, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert category</a>, where lime often shines.</p>  

<h3>Tools for accurate measurement</h3>  
<p>A digital kitchen scale is the best tool for measuring lime juice in grams. Simply place your container on the scale, tare it to zero, and pour the lime juice until you reach 22.5g. If you don’t have a scale, remember that 1 tbsp of lime juice is roughly 15g, so 1.5 tbsp would be 22.5g.

<h2>Common uses for 1.5 tbsp of lime juice</h2>  
<p>Lime juice adds brightness to many air fryer dishes. A classic use is in marinades—1.5 tbsp (22.5g) of lime juice pairs beautifully with garlic, herbs, and oil for chicken or shrimp. It’s also a key ingredient in dressings for air-fried salads or drizzled over crispy vegetables. For inspiration, browse our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipes</a>, where lime often features.</p>  

<p>In desserts, 1.5 tbsp of lime juice can elevate a simple air-fried cake or meringue. The acidity balances sweetness, creating a refreshing finish. If you’re experimenting with flavours, start with 22.5g of lime juice and adjust to taste.

<h3>Adjusting for taste and recipe variations</h3>  
<p>While 1.5 tbsp of lime juice is 22.5g, you might need slightly more or less depending on the lime’s ripeness and your personal preference. Taste as you go, especially in dressings or sauces. For dishes like air-fried tacos or ceviche, a little extra lime juice can enhance the flavour without overpowering it.</p>

<p>2.5 cups of peanut butter equals approximately 20 ounces (UK). This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes, where precise measurements ensure perfect texture and consistency. Whether you're whipping up peanut butter cookies or a satay sauce, knowing the exact weight helps avoid kitchen mishaps.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of peanut butter ensures your air fryer recipes turn out just right. Too much can make dishes greasy, while too little might leave them dry. For example, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>peanut butter cookies</a> rely on this exact 2.5 cups to 20-ounce ratio for the ideal chewiness. Air fryers cook quickly, so precision is key to avoid under or overcooking.</p>  

<p>Peanut butter’s density can vary slightly between brands, but 2.5 cups generally translates to 20 ounces in UK measurements. If you’re using a different type, like crunchy or natural, check our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for adjustments. This is especially useful for recipes like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>desserts</a> or <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/breakfast>breakfast dishes</a> where balance is crucial.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure Peanut Butter Correctly</h3>  
<p>For the most accurate results, use a kitchen scale to weigh your peanut butter. Scooping it directly from the jar with a measuring cup can lead to inconsistencies due to air pockets. If you don’t have a scale, spoon the peanut butter into the cup and level it off with a knife. This method works well for both creamy and crunchy varieties.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for 2.5 Cups of Peanut Butter in Air Fryer Recipes</h2>  
<p>This quantity is perfect for batch cooking or family-sized portions. Try it in peanut butter granola bars, energy bites, or even a decadent <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>chocolate peanut butter cake</a>. The air fryer’s even heat distribution ensures these treats bake uniformly, so you won’t end up with burnt edges or undercooked centres.</p>  

<p>For savoury dishes, 2.5 cups of peanut butter makes enough satay sauce to coat chicken or tofu. Pair it with our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning tips</a> to keep your air fryer in top condition after sticky recipes. Remember, thicker sauces like peanut butter can splatter, so lining the basket with parchment paper helps with easy cleanup.</p>  

<h3>Adjusting Recipes for Different Peanut Butter Types</h3>  
<p>Natural peanut butter tends to be oilier, so you might need slightly less than 2.5 cups to hit 20 ounces. Conversely, thicker commercial brands may require a bit more. Always check the consistency before adding it to your air fryer mix—this prevents soggy or overly dense results.</p>

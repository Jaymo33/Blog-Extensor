<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of beef stock is crucial for achieving the perfect texture and flavour in air fryer dishes. Too much liquid can make food soggy, while too little may dry it out.

If you're new to air frying, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a> for inspiration.</p>  
<p>Air fryers circulate hot air rapidly, so liquids evaporate faster than in conventional ovens. This makes precise measurements even more important. For example, when making a beef stew, 385 ml of beef stock (1.63 cups) provides enough moisture without overwhelming the ingredients. Always measure liquids carefully for the best results.</p>

<h2>Converting 385 ml of Beef Stock to Cups</h2>  
<p>The standard conversion for millilitres to cups is straightforward: 1 cup equals 236.59 ml. Therefore, 385 ml of beef stock is roughly 1.63 cups. This measurement is useful for both UK and US recipes, though slight variations may exist due to regional cup sizes. For a detailed breakdown, refer to our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion guide</a>.</p>  
<p>If you donâ€™t have a measuring cup, you can use a kitchen scale. Since beef stock has a similar density to water, 385 ml weighs about 385 grams. This method is handy for those who prefer weighing ingredients. Remember, accuracy ensures your air fryer dishes turn out perfectly every time.</p>

<h3>Common Uses for 385 ml of Beef Stock in Air Fryer Recipes</h3>

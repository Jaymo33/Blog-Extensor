<p>1.25 cups of honey equals approximately 425 grams. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes, where precision ensures perfect texture and flavour.

<h2>Why Accurate Honey Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>
<p>Honey’s thickness and sweetness mean even small measurement errors can throw off your recipe. Too much honey can make desserts overly sticky, while too little might leave meats under-glazed. The air fryer’s rapid cooking requires precise ratios to avoid burning or uneven caramelisation. Converting 1.25 cups of honey to grams (425g) eliminates guesswork, especially for recipes like honey-glazed salmon or spiced cakes.

<p>British and American cup sizes differ slightly, but 1.25 cups of honey consistently weighs around 425 grams. This standardisation helps when following international recipes or scaling portions. For example, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>honey-mustard chicken</a> relies on this conversion for balanced sweetness. Always use a kitchen scale for accuracy—especially with thick ingredients like honey that can’t be levelled easily in cups.</p>

<h3>How to Measure 1.25 Cups of Honey Without a Scale</h3>
<p>If you don’t have scales, lightly grease your measuring cup to help the honey slide out cleanly. Fill it to the 1-cup mark, then add another quarter cup, scraping the excess with a straight edge.

<h2>Common Recipes Using 1.25 Cups of Honey</h2>
<p>Many air fryer favourites call for this exact measurement. Honey-cake batters, teriyaki marinades, and granola clusters often use 1.25 cups (425g) of honey for optimal consistency. This quantity also works well in glazes for roasted vegetables or <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>sticky toffee puddings</a>. Since honey attracts moisture, it helps keep air-fried goods tender without sogginess.</p>

<p>When substituting sugar with honey, reduce other liquids in your recipe by 20%. Since 1.25 cups of honey equals 425 grams, it’s sweeter than sugar volume-for-volume. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe hub</a> includes adjustments for popular conversions. For instance, honey-garlic shrimp needs precisely 425g honey to balance the soy sauce and acidity.</p>

<h3>Storage Tips for Leftover Honey</h3>
<p>After measuring out 1.25 cups (425g) of honey, store the rest in an airtight container away from sunlight. Crystallisation is natural—just warm the jar in hot water to reliquefy. Avoid refrigerating honey, as it thickens and becomes harder to measure accurately for future air fryer experiments.</p>

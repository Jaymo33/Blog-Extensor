<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on even cooking, and incorrect ingredient quantities can lead to uneven results. Too much garlic paste might overpower a dish, while too little can leave it bland. Measuring by weight (ounces) is often more reliable than volume (cups) for thick pastes like garlic. This is especially true for recipes like garlic butter shrimp or roasted vegetables.

<p>Garlic paste is denser than minced garlic, so 1.5 cups will weigh more than you might expect. This density affects how it distributes in recipes, particularly in marinades or sauces. For dishes like garlic chicken or tofu, precise measurements ensure balanced flavours. If you're unsure, a kitchen scale is your best friend.

<h3>How to measure garlic paste correctly</h3>  
<p>For the most accurate results, use a measuring cup designed for thick ingredients. Scoop the garlic paste into the cup and level it off with a flat edge. Alternatively, weigh it directly in ounces for precision. This method works well for recipes like garlic bread or stuffed mushrooms. If you're scaling up, remember that 3 cups of garlic paste would be roughly 24 ounces.</p>  

<h2>Common recipes using 1.5 cups of garlic paste</h2>  
<p>Many air fryer dishes call for garlic paste, from marinades to dips. A classic example is garlic butter shrimp, where 1.5 cups (12 ounces) of paste can season a large batch. Another favourite is garlic roasted potatoes, where the paste coats the spuds evenly. For vegetarian options, try garlic tofu or mushroom skewers.

<p>Garlic paste also works wonders in meat dishes, like lamb chops or beef stir-fry. The 1.5-cup measurement is ideal for family-sized portions.

<h3>Adjusting recipes for different serving sizes</h3>  
<p>If your recipe serves fewer people, halve the garlic paste to 0.75 cups (6 ounces). For larger gatherings, double it to 3 cups (24 ounces). This flexibility makes garlic paste a versatile ingredient. Always adjust other seasonings proportionally to maintain balance. Whether you're cooking for one or a crowd, precise measurements guarantee great results.</p>

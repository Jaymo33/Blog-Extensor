<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air frying</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on precise measurements to ensure even cooking and optimal results. Using 0.33 cup of pumpkin seeds, which is roughly 1.5 oz, helps maintain consistency across recipes. Too many seeds can overcrowd the basket, leading to uneven roasting, while too few might burn quickly. For perfect results, always measure ingredients like pumpkin seeds by weight when possible. Explore more tips on our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipes page</a>.</p>  

<p>Pumpkin seeds are a versatile ingredient, great for adding crunch to salads or as a standalone snack. Their high oil content means they roast beautifully in an air fryer, but getting the quantity right is key. A 0.33 cup (1.5 oz) portion ensures they crisp up without sticking together. If you're new to air frying, start with this measurement and adjust to taste.</p>  

<h3>How to measure pumpkin seeds for air frying</h3>  
<p>For the most accurate results, use a kitchen scale to weigh out 1.5 oz (0.33 cup) of pumpkin seeds. If you don’t have a scale, lightly pack the seeds into a measuring cup without pressing down. This prevents over-measuring and ensures even cooking. For more air fryer tips, visit <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>.</p>  

<h2>Converting cups to ounces for other ingredients</h2>

<h3>Common mistakes when measuring pumpkin seeds</h3>  
<p>Avoid packing pumpkin seeds tightly into the cup, as this can lead to using more than 1.5 oz. Instead, gently fill the cup and level it off. Also, remember that roasted seeds weigh slightly less due to moisture loss. For perfectly crispy seeds, stick to the 0.33 cup (1.5 oz) measurement and adjust cooking time as needed.</p>

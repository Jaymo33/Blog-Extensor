<p>535 ml of corn syrup is approximately 2.25 cups in both UK and US measurements. This conversion is essential for baking and cooking, especially when using an air fryer for recipes that require precise measurements. Whether you're making sticky buns or glazes, knowing the exact cup equivalent ensures perfect results every time.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of corn syrup can make or break a recipe. Too little, and your glaze might not stick; too much, and your dessert could become overly sweet. For air fryer recipes, precise measurements ensure even cooking and perfect texture. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we emphasise the importance of accurate conversions for flawless results.</p>  

<p>Corn syrup is a common ingredient in many desserts, from pecan pies to caramel sauces. If you're adapting a recipe for your air fryer, knowing how to convert 535 ml of corn syrup to cups is crucial. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more handy measurement tips.</p>  

<h3>UK vs. US Cup Measurements</h3>  
<p>While 535 ml of corn syrup equals roughly 2.25 cups in both regions, it's worth noting that UK and US cup sizes differ slightly. However, for most baking purposes, this small variance won't affect your recipe. If precision is key, use a kitchen scale alongside measuring cups.</p>  

<h2>How to Measure 535 ml of Corn Syrup</h2>  
<p>Measuring thick liquids like corn syrup can be tricky. To get an accurate 535 ml (2.25 cups), lightly grease your measuring cup or spoon to help the syrup slide out easily. This prevents waste and ensures you're using the exact amount needed. For more tips, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a> tailored for air fryers.</p>  

<p>If you're scaling a recipe up or down, remember that 535 ml of corn syrup is just over two cups. This measurement is handy for larger batches, especially when preparing desserts like marshmallow treats or homemade candies in your air fryer.</p>  

<h3>Common Recipes Using 535 ml of Corn Syrup</h3>  
<p>Many classic desserts call for around 535 ml of corn syrup. Think pecan pie, caramel popcorn, or even homemade ice cream toppings. If you're using an air fryer, try adapting these recipes for quicker, crispier results.

<h2>Alternatives to Corn Syrup</h2>  
<p>If you're out of corn syrup, honey or golden syrup can work as substitutes, though they may alter the flavour slightly. For 535 ml (2.25 cups), use the same volume but adjust cooking times if needed. Always check your air fryer settings to avoid burning.</p>

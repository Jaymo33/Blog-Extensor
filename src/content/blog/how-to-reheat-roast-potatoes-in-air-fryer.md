<p>Reheating roast potatoes in an air fryer takes just 3-5 minutes at 180°C (350°F), giving you crispy exteriors and fluffy centres. This method outperforms microwaves and ovens by reviving texture without extra oil. Whether you’re working with fridge-cold leftovers or yesterday’s Sunday roast, your air fryer is the secret to perfect reheated spuds.</p>

<h2>Why an Air Fryer Reigns for Reheating Roasties</h2>
<p>Air fryers circulate hot air rapidly, mimicking deep-frying without submerging food. This makes them ideal for reheating roast potatoes, as the intense heat reactivates crispiness while locking in moisture. Unlike microwaves that leave potatoes soggy or ovens that dry them out, air fryers strike the perfect balance.

<p>Preheating your air fryer for 2-3 minutes ensures even cooking from the start. Arrange potatoes in a single layer with slight spacing – overcrowding leads to steaming instead of crisping. If your roast potatoes were originally parboiled or duck-fat roasted, they’ll reheat exceptionally well thanks to their pre-cooked structure.

<h3>Temperature and Timing Guidelines</h3>
<p>180°C (350°F) for 3-5 minutes is the sweet spot for most reheated roast potatoes. Thicker cuts or chilled potatoes may need 6-7 minutes – shake the basket halfway. For extra crispiness, spritz lightly with oil or use the air fryer’s roast setting if available. Always check internal temperature reaches 75°C (165°F) for food safety, especially when reheating roast potatoes from the fridge.</p>

<h2>Step-by-Step Reheating Process</h2>
<p>Start by removing roast potatoes from the fridge 10 minutes early to take the chill off. While waiting, preheat your air fryer to 180°C – this prevents temperature drops when adding cold food. Use tongs to arrange potatoes evenly, ensuring none overlap. For large batches, work in stages rather than compromising on space.</p>
<p>After 3 minutes, check progress. Well-browned potatoes may need less time, while pale ones benefit from an extra minute. If reheating roast potatoes with other leftovers like meat or veggies, add them in stages – potatoes usually need less time.

<h3>Pro Tips for Next-Level Results</h3>
<p>For ultra-crispy reheated roast potatoes, toss them in a teaspoon of cornflour before air frying. This absorbs excess moisture, enhancing crunch. If potatoes seem dry, brush lightly with butter or duck fat. To prevent sticking, use perforated parchment paper – find compatible liners in our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning essentials guide</a>.</p>

<h2>Troubleshooting Common Issues</h2>
<p>Soggy reheated roast potatoes often result from overcrowding or insufficient preheating. If this happens, extend cooking time by 2 minutes and leave space between pieces. Burnt edges? Lower temperature to 160°C (320°F) and stir more frequently. For unevenly cooked potatoes, cut larger pieces in half before reheating.</p>
<p>Remember that air fryer models vary – compact units may cook faster than larger ones. Always monitor the first batch to establish your appliance’s perfect timing.

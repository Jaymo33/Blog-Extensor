<p>1 cup of self-raising flour equals approximately 4.5 ounces (or 4.41 oz to be precise). This measurement is essential for air fryer baking, where precision can make or break your recipe. Whether you're making cakes, scones, or even savoury dishes, knowing the exact weight ensures consistent results every time.</p>

<h2>Why accurate flour measurements matter</h2>
<p>Baking is a science, and even small deviations in flour weight can affect texture and rise. Self-raising flour contains baking powder, so incorrect measurements might leave your air fryer creations too dense or overly puffed. Using a kitchen scale for ounces ensures accuracy, especially when adapting recipes from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>our collection</a>.</p>
<p>Many bakers swear by weighing ingredients rather than relying on cup measurements. A slight variance in how you scoop flour (scooped vs. spooned) can change the weight by up to 20%. For air fryer recipes, where heat distribution is intense, precision prevents undercooked centres or burnt edges.</p>

<h2>Converting cups to ounces for UK bakers</h2>
<p>In the UK, recipes often use grams, but ounces remain popular for smaller quantities. If your recipe calls for 1 cup of self-raising flour, you'll need 4.5 oz. This conversion is handy when using American recipes or scaling portions for smaller air fryer baskets.</p>
<p>For those who prefer grams, 1 cup equals roughly 125g. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> covers all common baking measurements, making it easier to switch between units without guesswork.</p>

<h3>Tools for measuring flour accurately</h3>
<p>A digital kitchen scale is the most reliable tool for converting 1 cup of self-raising flour to ounces. If you don’t have one, use the spoon-and-level method: lightly spoon flour into the cup without packing it, then level off the excess with a knife. This avoids compacting the flour, which could add extra ounces unintentionally.</p>

<h2>Common air fryer recipes using self-raising flour</h2>
<p>Self-raising flour is a staple in quick breads and cakes perfect for air fryers. Try our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>air fryer cake recipes</a>, where the right flour weight ensures a fluffy crumb. From vanilla sponge to chocolate muffins, precise ounces make all the difference.</p>
<p>Savoury options like air fryer onion bhajis or tempura also benefit from accurately measured self-raising flour. The leavening action helps create that coveted light, crispy texture without deep frying. Check our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>homepage</a> for inspiration.</p>

<h3>Adjusting recipes for different air fryer sizes</h3>
<p>Smaller air fryers (3-5L) may require halving recipes, meaning you’ll need 2.25 oz (half a cup) of self-raising flour. Larger models can handle full batches, but always preheat for even baking. Remember, air fryers cook faster than conventional ovens, so keep an eye on timing.</p>

<h2>Storing self-raising flour for best results</h2>
<p>To maintain its raising power, store self-raising flour in an airtight container in a cool, dry place. Over time, moisture can deactivate the baking powder, leading to flat bakes. If your flour is older than 6 months, test it by mixing a spoonful with hot water – if it doesn’t bubble, it’s lost its lift.</p>
<p>For longer storage, freeze flour in sealed bags. Thaw completely before using, and fluff it up with a fork to redistribute the leavening agents. This ensures your 1 cup (4.5 oz) measurements remain effective for air fryer recipes.</p>

<p>Reheating donuts in an air fryer takes just 2-3 minutes at 160°C (320°F), restoring their crispiness without drying them out. This method works brilliantly for glazed, filled, or plain donuts, giving them a second life with minimal effort. Whether you’ve got day-old bakery treats or homemade batches, your air fryer can revive them better than a microwave or oven. For more air fryer tips, explore <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>.</p>

<h2>Why Use an Air Fryer for Reheating Donuts?</h2>
<p>The air fryer’s rapid hot air circulation mimics a bakery oven, crisping the exterior while keeping the interior soft. Unlike microwaving, which often leaves donuts rubbery, the air fryer preserves texture and even reheats filled varieties without leakage. It’s also faster than conventional ovens – no preheating needed. This makes it ideal for spontaneous cravings or breakfast emergencies. Check our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for adapting other recipes.</p>

<p>Different donut types require slight adjustments. Cake donuts tolerate higher heat (175°C) for 90 seconds, while delicate glazed ones need lower temps (150°C) to prevent melting. Yeast-raised donuts benefit from a light spritz of water before reheating to maintain moisture. Always space them evenly in the basket – overcrowding leads to uneven results.

<h3>Step-by-Step Reheating Instructions</h3>
<p>Start by preheating your air fryer to 160°C for 2 minutes if your model requires it. Place donuts in a single layer, leaving space between each. Reheat for 2 minutes, then check – add 30-second increments if needed. Filled donuts like jam or custard varieties should be reheated at 150°C for gentler warming. Always let them rest 1 minute before eating – fillings retain heat longer than the dough.</p>

<h2>Pro Tips for Best Results</h2>
<p>For extra crispiness, lightly brush donuts with melted butter before reheating. Stale donuts revive beautifully with a 5-second water spritz prior to air frying. If reheating from frozen, add 1 extra minute but check frequently. Store leftover donuts properly – airtight at room temperature for 1 day or freeze for up to a month. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner guide</a> helps maintain your appliance after sticky treats.</p>

<p>Avoid reheating powdered sugar donuts at high temperatures – the sugar will melt and burn. Instead, use 140°C and tent with foil. For chocolate-coated varieties, place a parchment liner underneath to catch drips. Experiment with timings – smaller donuts may need just 90 seconds. Remember, air fryers vary, so note what works for your model. Discover more techniques in our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a>.</p>

<h3>Troubleshooting Common Issues</h3>
<p>If donuts dry out, they’ve been overheated – reduce time or temperature next attempt. Sticky glazes? Chill donuts 10 minutes before reheating to set the coating. Uneven heating usually means overcrowding – work in batches if necessary. For very large donuts, consider halving them to ensure even warming throughout. Always use tongs to handle hot donuts – the glaze can cause burns.</p>

<p>0.25 cup of sesame seeds equals approximately 1.2 ounces (34 grams) in UK measurements. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes, where precise ingredient quantities can make or break your dish. Whether you’re sprinkling sesame seeds over salmon or mixing them into a crispy tofu coating, knowing the exact weight ensures consistency. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we focus on accurate conversions to help you nail every recipe. Keep reading for tips on measuring sesame seeds and how to use them in your air fryer.</p>

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on even heat distribution, so ingredient proportions must be spot-on. Too many sesame seeds can lead to uneven cooking, while too few might leave your dish lacking flavour. For example, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>sesame-crusted salmon recipe</a> calls for precisely 0.25 cup of seeds to achieve that perfect crunch. Measuring by weight (ounces) is more reliable than volume (cups), as seeds can settle or vary in density. A digital kitchen scale is your best friend here – it eliminates guesswork and ensures repeatable results.</p>  
<p>If you’re converting other ingredients, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for common UK measurements. Sesame seeds are lightweight, so 0.25 cup might seem like a small amount, but they pack a nutritional punch. Rich in healthy fats and protein, they’re a staple in air-fried vegetables and <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken dishes</a>. Store them in an airtight container to maintain freshness, and always fluff them up before measuring to avoid compaction.</p>  

<h3>How to measure 0.25 cup of sesame seeds without a scale</h3>  
<p>No scale? No problem. Use the spoon-and-level method: gently spoon sesame seeds into a measuring cup until heaping, then level off the excess with a straight edge. Avoid tapping the cup, as this compacts the seeds and skews the measurement. For 0.25 cup, fill a 1-cup measure halfway and then halve that portion visually. Remember, 0.25 cup of sesame seeds to ounces is roughly 1.2 oz, but slight variations won’t ruin most recipes. For baking, though, precision is key – consider investing in a scale for <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>air fryer cakes</a> and cookies.</p>  

<h2>Creative ways to use 0.25 cup of sesame seeds</h2>  
<p>That small amount of sesame seeds can transform your air fryer creations. Sprinkle them over roasted broccoli or cauliflower for extra crunch, or mix them into breadcrumbs for a nutty coating. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable recipes</a> often call for 0.25 cup of sesame seeds to elevate simple ingredients. Try tossing them with olive oil and salt before air-frying for a quick snack – they’ll toast evenly at 160°C for 3–4 minutes. Just watch closely, as they burn easily!</p>  
<p>For Asian-inspired dishes, combine 0.25 cup of sesame seeds with soy sauce and honey as a glaze for chicken wings. The seeds caramelise beautifully in the air fryer, creating a sticky-sweet coating. If you’re meal prepping, toast a batch of seeds in advance and store them for up to a week. They’ll lose some crispness over time, so refresh them in the air fryer for 1–2 minutes before use. And don’t forget to clean your air fryer basket afterward – sesame seeds can get into crevices. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning guide</a> has tips for stubborn residue.</p>  

<h3>Sesame seed substitutions in a pinch</h3>  
<p>Ran out of sesame seeds? For 0.25 cup, try an equal weight (1.2 oz) of poppy seeds or finely chopped nuts. The texture will differ, but they’ll provide a similar crunch. Flaxseeds work too, though they’re denser – reduce the amount by 20% to match the volume. In a bind, breadcrumbs with a dash of sesame oil can mimic the flavour, but adjust cooking times as they brown faster. Always test substitutions with small batches first, especially for <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>desserts</a> where texture is crucial.</p>

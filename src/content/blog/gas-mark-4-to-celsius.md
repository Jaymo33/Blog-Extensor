You might find our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> helpful for adjusting various recipes.</p>
<p>The 180°C setting works particularly well for baked goods like scones, muffins and certain breads in the air fryer. It's also ideal for roasting root vegetables or reheating leftovers without drying them out. Many frozen foods, from chips to chicken nuggets, cook perfectly at this temperature too - check our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/frozen-foods>frozen foods section</a> for specific timings.</p>

<h2>How Gas Mark 4 Compares to Other Temperatures</h2>
<p>Gas Mark 4 (180°C) sits comfortably in the middle of the temperature range, making it safer for beginners than higher heats. It's one Gas Mark below the standard roasting temperature (Gas Mark 5/190°C) and two above gentle warming (Gas Mark 2/150°C). When using Gas Mark 4 in Celsius for air frying, you'll notice foods cook about 20% faster than conventional oven times.</p>
<p>For those converting multiple Gas Marks to Celsius, here's a quick reference: Gas Mark 1 is 140°C, Gas Mark 3 is 160°C, and Gas Mark 5 is 190°C. The air fryer's rapid circulation means you might need to reduce these by 10-20°C in some cases. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a> includes adjusted temperatures for popular dishes.</p>

<h3>Adjusting Cooking Times at 180°C</h3>
<p>When using Gas Mark 4 in Celsius (180°C) in your air fryer, start checking food 5 minutes before the recipe suggests. Items like chicken breasts might need 15-18 minutes instead of 20-25 in a regular oven. For baking, reduce standard oven times by about 25% and keep an eye on browning - the concentrated heat can cause faster caramelisation.</p>

<h2>Common Foods Cooked at Gas Mark 4</h2>
<p>Many air fryer staples work beautifully at 180°C, including homemade chips (25-30 mins), salmon fillets (12-15 mins), and stuffed mushrooms (10-12 mins). This temperature also excels at reheating - try it for leftover pizza (3-4 mins) or roast dinners (8-10 mins). For perfect cookies, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cookies>cookie recipes</a> include specific air fryer adaptations.</p>
<p>Vegetables particularly benefit from Gas Mark 4's 180°C heat in the air fryer. Brussels sprouts become crispy outside and tender inside in about 15 minutes, while cauliflower florets take 12-14 minutes. Remember to shake the basket halfway through cooking for even results. After cooking, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning guide</a> helps maintain your appliance.</p>

<h3>Special Considerations for Baking</h3>
<p>When baking at Gas Mark 4 (180°C) in your air fryer, use slightly less sugar than oven recipes as caramelisation happens faster. Cakes and muffins may need parchment liners to prevent sticking, and tins should only be filled halfway due to the powerful rising action. Check doneness 5 minutes early with a skewer test.</p>

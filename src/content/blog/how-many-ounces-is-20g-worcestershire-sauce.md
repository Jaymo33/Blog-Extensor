<p>20 grams of Worcestershire sauce equals approximately 0.71 ounces. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements can make or break your dish. Whether you’re marinating chicken or adding a splash to a beef recipe, knowing the exact weight ensures consistency. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we focus on helping you get the best results with easy-to-follow conversions.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>
<p>Using the right amount of Worcestershire sauce can enhance the flavour of your dishes without overpowering them. Too much can make your food overly tangy, while too little might leave it bland. The air fryer’s intense heat means ingredients like Worcestershire sauce evaporate quickly, so precision is key. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more handy tips.</p>

<p>Many UK recipes use grams, but if your measuring tools are in ounces, this conversion is a lifesaver. Whether you’re cooking a <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken dish</a> or prepping a marinade, 20g of Worcestershire sauce translates to roughly 0.71 ounces. This small but crucial detail ensures your meals turn out perfectly every time.</p>

<h3>How to Measure Worcestershire Sauce for Air Fryer Recipes</h3>
<p>For the most accurate measurement, use a digital kitchen scale set to grams. If you don’t have one, a standard measuring spoon can work in a pinch. Remember, 20g of Worcestershire sauce is just under three-quarters of an ounce. This measurement is particularly useful for recipes like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer glazes</a> or sauces.</p>

<h2>Common Uses for Worcestershire Sauce in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>
<p>Worcestershire sauce adds depth to marinades, glazes, and even dry rubs. A 20g portion (0.71 ounces) is often enough for a family-sized meal. Try it in <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/beef>beef recipes</a> or as a base for homemade BBQ sauces. The umami-rich flavour works wonders in the air fryer’s high-heat environment.</p>

<p>If you’re experimenting with new dishes, start with 20g of Worcestershire sauce and adjust to taste. This amount is ideal for balancing flavours without overwhelming other ingredients.

<h3>Tips for Storing and Using Worcestershire Sauce</h3>
<p>Keep your Worcestershire sauce in a cool, dark place to preserve its flavour. Once opened, it lasts about a year, but always check for freshness. A 20g (0.71-ounce) portion is easy to measure and adds a punch of flavour to any dish.

<p>685 ml of apple cider vinegar equals approximately 2.9 cups. This conversion is essential for recipes requiring precise measurements, especially when using an air fryer. Whether you're baking, marinating, or making dressings, knowing how to convert millilitres to cups ensures consistent results every time.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Using the correct amount of apple cider vinegar can make or break a recipe. Too little, and your dish might lack tang; too much, and it could become overpowering. For air fryer recipes, precision is key to achieving the perfect texture and flavour. That’s why understanding conversions like 685 ml of apple cider vinegar to cups is so important.</p>  

<p>Many recipes on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> rely on precise liquid measurements to ensure success. Whether you're making crispy chicken wings or a tangy glaze, knowing how to measure 685 ml of apple cider vinegar in cups will help you nail the recipe every time.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure 685 ml of Apple Cider Vinegar</h3>  
<p>To measure 685 ml of apple cider vinegar accurately, use a liquid measuring cup with millilitre markings. If your cup only shows imperial measurements, remember that 1 cup equals roughly 237 ml. For 685 ml, you’ll need just under 3 cups (2.9 cups, to be exact).</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for Apple Cider Vinegar in Air Fryers</h2>  
<p>Apple cider vinegar is a versatile ingredient in air fryer cooking. It’s often used in marinades, glazes, and even cleaning solutions.

<h3>Converting Other Liquid Measurements</h3>

<h2>Tips for Storing Apple Cider Vinegar</h2>

If you’re using 685 ml of apple cider vinegar for a recipe, consider transferring any leftovers to a smaller, airtight container.</p>

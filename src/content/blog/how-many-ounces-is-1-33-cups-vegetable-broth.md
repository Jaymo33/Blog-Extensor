<p>1.33 cups of vegetable broth equals approximately 10.64 ounces. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements ensure the best results. Whether you're making soups, stews, or marinades, knowing the exact weight helps maintain consistency. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we focus on making conversions simple for home cooks. Let’s dive deeper into how this measurement works and why it matters.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on even heat distribution, so ingredient quantities must be precise. Too much or too little liquid, like vegetable broth, can affect texture and cooking time. For example, 1.33 cups of vegetable broth to ounces ensures your dish isn’t too dry or soggy. Many recipes on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes</a> use broth for flavour and moisture. Getting the measurement right guarantees restaurant-quality results every time.</p>  

<p>Using a kitchen scale is the most accurate way to measure 1.33 cups of vegetable broth in ounces. However, if you don’t have one, our conversion chart at <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart</a> can help. Remember, UK and US cup sizes differ slightly, so always check your measuring tools. For air fryer cooking, consistency is key, and 10.64 ounces of broth will give you the perfect balance.</p>  

<h3>How to measure vegetable broth without a scale</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a scale, use a liquid measuring cup for 1.33 cups of vegetable broth. Fill it to the 1 1/3 cup mark, which is just over 10 ounces. For sticky or thick broths, lightly grease the cup for easy pouring. This method works well for recipes like air fryer risotto or braised vegetables.

<h2>Common uses for vegetable broth in air fryer recipes</h2>  
<p>Vegetable broth adds depth to dishes like air fryer soups, grains, and marinades. Knowing that 1.33 cups equals 10.64 ounces helps scale recipes up or down. For example, a mushroom risotto might call for this exact amount to achieve creamy perfection.

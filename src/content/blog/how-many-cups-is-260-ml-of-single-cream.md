<p>260 ml of single cream is approximately 1.1 cups in UK measurements or 1.09 cups in US measurements. This conversion is essential for precise baking and cooking, especially when using an air fryer where exact measurements can affect texture and consistency. Whether you're making a creamy sauce or a rich dessert, knowing how to convert millilitres to cups ensures your recipes turn out perfectly every time.</p>

<h2>Understanding Single Cream Measurements</h2>  
<p>Single cream is a staple in many recipes, from soups to desserts, and getting the measurement right is crucial. In the UK, single cream has a fat content of around 18%, making it lighter than double cream but richer than milk. When converting 260 ml of single cream to cups, it’s important to note that UK and US cup sizes differ slightly. A UK cup holds 284 ml, while a US cup is 240 ml. This means 260 ml of single cream is just over 1 cup in the UK and slightly more in the US.</p>  

<p>For air fryer recipes, precision matters. Too much or too little cream can alter the dish’s moisture and texture. If you’re adapting a recipe from millilitres to cups, always double-check the conversion.

<h3>Why Accurate Measurements Matter</h3>  
<p>Using the correct amount of single cream ensures your dishes have the right consistency and flavour. In baking, for example, too much cream can make cakes soggy, while too little can dry them out. For air fryer cooking, precise measurements help achieve even cooking and perfect browning. Whether you’re making a creamy pasta sauce or a decadent dessert, 260 ml of single cream converted correctly will make all the difference.</p>  

<h2>Converting 260 ml of Single Cream for Different Recipes</h2>  
<p>Different recipes may call for single cream in various measurements, and knowing how to convert 260 ml to cups is useful. For instance, if you’re making a creamy mushroom sauce in your air fryer, 260 ml of single cream will give you a rich, velvety texture.

<p>When converting 260 ml of single cream to cups, remember that slight variations won’t ruin your dish. However, for baking, where precision is key, using a kitchen scale or measuring jug is best. If you’re in a pinch, 260 ml is roughly 1 cup plus 1-2 tablespoons in US measurements or just over 1 cup in the UK.</p>  

<h3>Tips for Measuring Single Cream</h3>  
<p>To measure 260 ml of single cream accurately, use a liquid measuring jug with clear markings. Pour the cream slowly to avoid bubbles, which can affect the measurement. If you don’t have a jug, a standard UK cup (284 ml) filled just below the rim will give you close to 260 ml.

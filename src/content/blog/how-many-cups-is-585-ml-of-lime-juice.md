<h2>Why Accurate Lime Juice Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of lime juice can make or break a dish. Too little, and your recipe lacks tang; too much, and it becomes overpowering. For air fryer recipes like citrus-glazed salmon or lime-infused shrimp, precision is key. A slight miscalculation can affect texture, flavour, and cooking time. That’s why converting 585 ml of lime juice to cups (2.47 cups) is so important.</p>  
<p>Many air fryer recipes, such as those found on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>our recipe page</a>, rely on balanced acidity for perfect results.

This method works well for recipes like lime drizzle cake or tangy chicken wings in the air fryer.</p>

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on precise cooking times and ingredient ratios to deliver crispy, evenly cooked meals.

<h3>How to measure 0.66 cup of milk accurately</h3>  
<p>Measuring 0.66 cup of milk can be tricky without the right tools. Use a liquid measuring cup with clear markings for the most precise results. If you don’t have one, remember that 0.66 cup is roughly two-thirds of a standard cup, or about 5.28 ounces.</p>

<h2>Common uses for 0.66 cup of milk in air fryer recipes</h2>  
<p>Many air fryer recipes call for small amounts of milk, like 0.66 cup (5.28 ounces), to create the perfect batter or sauce. From fluffy pancakes to creamy pasta bakes, this measurement pops up often. For inspiration, browse our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> collection.</p>  
<p>If you’re making a dessert, such as a cake or custard, 0.66 cup of milk provides just the right consistency. Too much milk can make batters runny, while too little can leave them dry. Stick to 5.28 ounces for foolproof results.</p>

<h2>Tips for working with milk in air fryer recipes</h2>  
<p>Milk can behave differently in an air fryer compared to traditional ovens. For best results, use room-temperature milk to avoid uneven cooking. Also, consider using a liner to prevent spills—check out our guide on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning your air fryer</a> for hassle-free maintenance.</p>

This conversion is essential for baking, cooking, or preparing air fryer recipes where precision matters. Whether you're whipping up a cake or a creamy sauce, knowing how to measure almond milk correctly ensures perfect results every time.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Almond Milk Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of almond milk can make or break a recipe. Too much liquid can lead to soggy cakes or diluted flavours, while too little might dry out your dish. For air fryer recipes, precise measurements help achieve the ideal texture, whether you're making crispy tofu or moist muffins.

<p>Almond milk is a popular dairy-free alternative, but its consistency varies slightly from cow’s milk. This means conversions aren’t always straightforward.

<h3>US vs. UK Cup Measurements</h3>  
<p>In the US, 1 cup equals 240 ml, while in the UK, it’s 250 ml. This small difference adds up when converting larger amounts like 885 ml of almond milk. For US bakers, 885 ml translates to roughly 3.74 cups, whereas UK cooks will use about 3.5 cups. Always check your recipe’s origin to avoid measurement mishaps.</p>  

<h2>How to Measure 885 ml of Almond Milk Without a Scale</h2>  
<p>If you don’t have a measuring jug, use standard cups or spoons for accuracy. A US cup holds 240 ml, so 3 full cups give you 720 ml, leaving 165 ml (about ⅔ cup) to reach 885 ml. For UK cups, 3 cups equal 750 ml, with 135 ml (just over ½ cup) remaining. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert recipes</a> often rely on precise liquid measurements for the best texture.</p>  

<p>Another trick is to use a liquid measuring cup with clear markings. Pour the almond milk slowly to the 885 ml line for foolproof accuracy. This method is especially handy for air fryer batters or sauces where consistency is key. Need cleaning tips for sticky measuring tools?

<p>0.5 tbsp of onion weighs approximately 3 grams. This conversion is handy when preparing air fryer recipes that require precise measurements for the best results. Whether you’re making a stir-fry, seasoning meat, or adding onions to a dish, knowing the exact weight ensures consistency.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate onion measurements matter</h2>  
<p>Getting the right amount of onion in your air fryer recipes can make a big difference in flavour and texture. Too little, and your dish might lack depth; too much, and it could overpower other ingredients. For example, if you’re making a quick air-fried stir-fry, 0.5 tbsp of onion (around 3 grams) adds just the right hint of sweetness without overwhelming the dish.</p>  

<p>Many recipes on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> use tablespoons or grams, so knowing how to convert between the two is essential. This is especially true for dishes like air-fried fajitas or onion-topped burgers, where balance is key. A small error in measurement could throw off the entire recipe, so precision matters.</p>  

<h3>How to measure 0.5 tbsp of onion</h3>  
<p>Measuring 0.5 tbsp of onion can be tricky if you don’t have the right tools. A standard UK tablespoon holds about 15ml, so half of that is 7.5ml. When chopped finely, this roughly translates to 3 grams. For best results, use a kitchen scale if you have one, or pack the onion lightly into a measuring spoon for consistency.</p>  

<h2>Converting other onion measurements</h2>  
<p>If your recipe calls for a different amount of onion, you can use the same conversion ratio. For instance, 1 tbsp of onion equals about 6 grams, while 2 tbsp would be around 12 grams. This makes scaling recipes up or down much easier, whether you’re cooking for one or a family.</p>  

<p>Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> includes common measurements like 0.5 tbsp onion to grams, so you’ll never be stuck guessing. This is particularly useful for air fryer recipes, where ingredient ratios can affect cooking times and textures. A little extra onion might not seem like much, but in a compact air fryer, it can change how evenly your food cooks.</p>  

<h3>Common uses for 0.5 tbsp of onion</h3>  
<p>Half a tablespoon of onion (3 grams) is often used in small-batch recipes or as a garnish. For example, sprinkling 0.5 tbsp of finely diced onion over air-fried potatoes adds a subtle flavour boost without being overpowering. It’s also a great amount for marinades or rubs, where a little goes a long way.</p>  

<h2>Tips for cooking with onions in an air fryer</h2>  
<p>Onions can vary in moisture content, which affects their weight. A tightly packed 0.5 tbsp might weigh slightly more than a loosely filled one, so adjust accordingly. If you’re air-frying onions as a standalone ingredient (like crispy onion strings), you’ll need more—but for most recipes, 0.5 tbsp (3 grams) is a safe starting point.</p>

Whether you’re making stuffed peppers or a hearty veggie bake, knowing how many grams are in 0.5 tbsp of onion ensures your dish turns out perfectly every time.</p>  

<h3>Storing leftover onions</h3>  
<p>If you’ve measured out 0.5 tbsp of onion but don’t use it all, store the rest in an airtight container in the fridge. Chopped onions can last up to a week if kept properly, making them a convenient ingredient for quick air fryer meals. Just remember to re-weigh if your recipe calls for grams next time.</p>

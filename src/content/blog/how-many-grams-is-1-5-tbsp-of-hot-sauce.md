<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on even heat distribution, so precise ingredient measurements help avoid soggy or unevenly cooked food. Hot sauce, with its varying thickness, can be tricky to measure by volume alone. Converting 1.5 tbsp of hot sauce to grams (22.5g) ensures you’re adding the right amount of heat without overpowering your dish. This is especially useful for recipes like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>spicy air fryer chicken</a>, where balance is key.</p>  

<p>Using grams instead of tablespoons also eliminates guesswork when scaling recipes up or down. If you’re meal prepping or adjusting spice levels, weight measurements provide reliability. Plus, many UK recipes list ingredients in grams, making this conversion a must-know for home cooks.

<h3>How to measure 1.5 tbsp of hot sauce accurately</h3>  
<p>For the most precise measurement, use a digital kitchen scale. Simply tare your bowl or spoon, then pour the hot sauce until it reaches 22.5 grams. If you don’t have a scale, level off your tablespoon with a knife to ensure an exact 1.5 tbsp portion. Remember, thicker hot sauces may weigh slightly more, so adjust if needed.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for 1.5 tbsp of hot sauce in air fryer recipes</h2>  
<p>This quantity is perfect for marinating proteins like chicken or tofu, adding a kick to <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>roasted vegetables</a>, or mixing into dips.

<h2>Understanding Fan Oven vs Conventional Oven Temperatures</h2>
<p>Fan ovens circulate hot air using a built-in fan, cooking food faster and more evenly than conventional ovens. When a recipe calls for 139 fan oven to conventional oven conversion, you're typically adding 10-15°C to compensate for this efficiency difference.

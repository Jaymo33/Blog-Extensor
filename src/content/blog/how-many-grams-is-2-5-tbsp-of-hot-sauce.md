<p>2.5 tablespoons (tbsp) of hot sauce is approximately 37.5 grams (g). This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precision ensures the perfect balance of flavour and consistency. Whether you’re whipping up spicy wings or a zesty marinade, knowing the exact weight of your hot sauce can make all the difference.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>

<p>Hot sauce density can vary slightly by brand, but a general rule is that 1 tbsp equals about 15 grams. This makes 2.5 tbsp roughly 37.5 grams. If you’re working with a thicker or thinner sauce, a kitchen scale will give you the most accurate reading.

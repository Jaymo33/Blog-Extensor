<p>Mayonnaise is often used as a binder or to add moisture in air fryer recipes. Whether you’re making crispy chicken tenders or a quick salad dressing, 5g of mayonnaise is a common measurement. Converting grams to ounces ensures you follow recipes accurately, especially when using American or UK measurements. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipes section</a> has plenty of ideas to put this conversion to good use.</p>

<h2>How to measure 5g of mayonnaise without scales</h2>
<p>Not everyone has kitchen scales handy, but there are easy ways to estimate 5g of mayonnaise. A standard teaspoon holds about 5g, but this can vary slightly depending on the brand.

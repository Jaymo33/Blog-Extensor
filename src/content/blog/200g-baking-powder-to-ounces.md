<p>200g of baking powder equals approximately 7.05 ounces. Whether you're whipping up cakes, bread, or other air fryer delights, getting the measurements right is crucial. Baking powder is a key leavening agent, and even small deviations can affect your recipe's outcome. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we help you nail every measurement for flawless results.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate conversions matter in air fryer baking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers cook food faster and more evenly than traditional ovens, so precision is key. Using the right amount of baking powder ensures your cakes rise perfectly and your batters aren’t too dense. A slight miscalculation could lead to flat or overly airy textures. That’s why knowing how to convert 200g of baking powder to ounces (7.05 oz) is so helpful.</p>  

<p>Many UK recipes use grams, while some older cookbooks or international sources list ounces. If you’re following a recipe from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>our collection</a>, you’ll often find both measurements. But when in doubt, a digital kitchen scale is your best friend for accuracy.</p>  

<h2>How to measure 200g of baking powder without a scale</h2>  
<p>If you don’t have a scale, you can still measure 200g of baking powder using volume. One teaspoon holds about 4g, so 200g would be roughly 50 teaspoons. However, this method is less precise due to settling and scooping differences. For best results, we recommend investing in a digital scale.</p>  

<h3>Common baking powder substitutions</h3>  
<p>If you run out of baking powder, you can make a substitute using baking soda and cream of tartar. For every 200g (7.05 oz) of baking powder, use 70g baking soda and 130g cream of tartar. Check <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>our conversion chart</a> for more handy swaps.</p>  

<h2>Best air fryer recipes using baking powder</h2>  
<p>Baking powder is essential for air fryer cakes, doughnuts, and even savoury dishes like tempura. Try our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>air fryer cake recipes</a> for fluffy, perfectly risen treats. Remember, 200g of baking powder (7.05 oz) goes a long way—most recipes use just a teaspoon or two.</p>

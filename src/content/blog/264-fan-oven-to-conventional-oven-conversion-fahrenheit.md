<p>264°F in a fan oven converts to approximately 240°F in a conventional oven. This 24°F difference accounts for the fan oven's efficient heat distribution, which cooks food faster and more evenly. If you're adapting recipes for an air fryer, which works similarly to a fan oven, you'll need this conversion to avoid overcooking. Visit <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>our conversion chart</a> for more detailed adjustments.</p>

<h2>Why Fan Oven Temperatures Differ</h2>
<p>Fan ovens circulate hot air constantly, reducing cooking times by 20-25% compared to conventional ovens. When a recipe states 264°F for a fan oven, it's effectively hotter than the same temperature in a traditional oven. This is why most manufacturers recommend lowering the temperature by 20-25°F when converting. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> team always recommends checking conversions twice when trying new recipes.</p>
<p>The science behind this lies in heat transfer efficiency. In a fan oven, the moving air transfers heat more effectively to food surfaces, meaning the same results can be achieved at slightly lower temperatures. This principle applies directly to air fryers too, which are essentially compact, powerful fan ovens. For perfect <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipes</a>, getting this conversion right is crucial.</p>

<h2>How to Apply This Conversion</h2>
<p>When you see 264°F in a fan oven recipe, simply set your conventional oven to 240°F and maintain the same cooking time. For air fryers, which operate like mini fan ovens, you might actually want to reduce the time by 5-10% as well. We've found this works perfectly for <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/potatoes>roast potatoes</a> and other crispy favourites.</p>
<p>Always monitor your food during the first attempt with a new conversion. Oven calibrations can vary, and factors like dish material and food quantity affect results. Our testing at <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> shows that thicker cuts of meat may need an extra 5°F in conventional ovens to compensate for reduced air circulation.</p>

<h3>Special Considerations for Baking</h3>
<p>When converting 264 fan oven to conventional oven for baked goods, the temperature adjustment is particularly important. Cakes and pastries can over-brown or dry out if the heat is too intense. We recommend checking at the 75% mark of the suggested cooking time when first trying a converted recipe.</p>

<h3>Air Fryer Equivalent Temperatures</h3>
<p>Since air fryers use rapid air technology like fan ovens, you can typically use the original 264°F fan oven temperature. However, because air fryers are more compact and efficient, reducing cooking time by 15-20% often yields better results. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a> includes specific air fryer adaptations for popular dishes.</p>

<h2>Common Conversion Mistakes</h2>
<p>One frequent error is forgetting that 264 fan oven to conventional oven conversion works differently for different foods. Dense items like meatloaf might need the full 240°F, while delicate items like soufflés could benefit from a slightly higher 245°F to compensate for heat loss when opening the oven.</p>
<p>Another pitfall is assuming all ovens are calibrated perfectly. We recommend using an independent oven thermometer to verify your appliance's accuracy, especially when working with precise conversions like 264°F fan to conventional. This simple tool can prevent many cooking disappointments.</p>

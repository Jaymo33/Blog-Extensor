At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we specialise in helping you master these essential cooking conversions. Let's explore how this temperature works across different cooking methods.</p>

<h2>Understanding Gas Mark Conversions</h2>
<p>The Gas Mark scale is uniquely British, ranging from 1/4 to 9 with each full mark representing about 25-30°C. Gas Mark 4 specifically equates to 343 F or 173°C, making it a versatile mid-range temperature. Many classic British recipes, from shepherd's pie to Victoria sponge, call for this setting. When using an air fryer, you might need to adjust cooking times slightly as they cook more efficiently. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> provides detailed guidance for all your temperature conversion needs.</p>

<p>Historically, Gas Marks were developed when most British homes used gas ovens without precise temperature controls. Today, even with modern appliances, many traditional recipes still reference this system. When converting 343 F to Gas Mark for your air fryer, remember that the circulating hot air cooks food faster.

<h3>Why 343 F (Gas Mark 4) Works So Well</h3>

In air fryers, this setting is ideal for achieving crispy textures without drying out your food. The circulating air ensures even cooking on all sides, something traditional ovens can struggle with.</p>

<h2>Converting 343 F to Gas Mark for Different Appliances</h2>
<p>While 343 F always equals Gas Mark 4, how you apply this temperature varies by appliance. Conventional ovens may have hot spots, requiring occasional tray rotation. Fan-assisted ovens cook about 20°C hotter than their setting indicates, so you'd typically reduce the temperature accordingly. Air fryers, being compact and powerful, achieve excellent results at 343 F to Gas Mark 4 with shorter cooking times.

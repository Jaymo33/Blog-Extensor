<h2>Why accurate hot sauce measurements matter</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of hot sauce ensures your air fryer dishes have consistent heat and flavour.

If you're preparing a spicy <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipe</a>, 45 grams (3 tbsp) of hot sauce delivers a balanced kick. Always adjust based on your preferred heat level and the sauce's intensity.</p>  

<p>Different hot sauce brands may vary in viscosity, affecting weight. For example, a thicker Louisiana-style sauce might weigh slightly more than a thinner vinegar-based one.

<h2>How to measure hot sauce for air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>For best results, use a digital kitchen scale to measure 45 grams of hot sauce directly. If you don't have one, level off each tablespoon evenly for consistency.

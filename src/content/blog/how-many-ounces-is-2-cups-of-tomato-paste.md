<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on even heat distribution, so ingredient quantities must be spot-on. Too much tomato paste can make dishes overly thick, while too little might leave them lacking flavour. Measuring by weight (ounces) is often more reliable than volume (cups), especially for dense ingredients like tomato paste. If you're new to air frying, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a> for foolproof ideas.</p>  

<p>Tomato paste is a staple in many air fryer dishes, from meatballs to vegetable roasts. Its concentrated flavour means a little goes a long way, but getting the measurement right is key. For best results, use a kitchen scale to weigh your tomato paste instead of relying solely on cup measurements. This ensures your <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable-based recipes</a> turn out perfectly every time.</p>  

<h3>How to measure tomato paste without a scale</h3>  
<p>If you donâ€™t have a kitchen scale, you can still measure 2 cups of tomato paste accurately. A standard US cup holds 8 fluid ounces, but tomato paste is denser than water. Pack the paste firmly into the measuring cup, levelling it off with a knife for precision. For UK cooks, note that metric conversions may vary slightly, so always double-check.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for tomato paste in air fryer recipes</h2>  
<p>Tomato paste adds depth to sauces, marinades, and even dry rubs for air-fried meats. Try it in <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipes</a> or as a base for air-fried pizzas. Since 2 cups of tomato paste equals 16 ounces, you can portion it out for multiple dishes. Store any leftovers in an airtight container or freeze them for future use.</p>  

<p>Another great way to use tomato paste is in air-fried stuffed peppers or as a glaze for roasted vegetables. Its rich, umami flavour enhances almost any dish.

<h3>Converting tomato paste for different recipes</h3>  
<p>Some recipes call for smaller amounts, like tablespoons or teaspoons. Remember that 16 ounces of tomato paste (2 cups) equals 32 tablespoons or 96 teaspoons. Adjust quantities accordingly, especially when scaling recipes up or down for your air fryer. This flexibility makes it easier to experiment with new dishes.</p>

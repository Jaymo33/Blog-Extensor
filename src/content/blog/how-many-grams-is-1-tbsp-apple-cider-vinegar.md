<p>1 tablespoon (tbsp) of apple cider vinegar weighs approximately 15 grams. This measurement is essential for air fryer recipes where precision ensures the best texture and flavour. Whether you're marinating chicken or adding a tangy twist to roasted vegetables, knowing the exact grams in 1 tbsp of apple cider vinegar helps you achieve consistent results every time.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>
<p>Air fryers rely on even heat distribution, and precise ingredient measurements prevent soggy or unevenly cooked dishes. Using 15 grams of apple cider vinegar per tablespoon ensures your marinades or sauces aren’t too acidic or diluted. For example, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer chicken recipes</a> often call for apple cider vinegar to tenderise the meat, and the right amount makes all the difference.</p>
<p>If you’re converting other liquid ingredients, check our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for quick reference. Many home cooks underestimate how small variations in liquid measurements can affect air fryer outcomes, especially when baking or glazing.</p>

<h2>How to Measure 1 Tbsp Apple Cider Vinegar Correctly</h2>
<p>To measure 15 grams of apple cider vinegar accurately, use a digital kitchen scale for the best precision. Pour the vinegar into a tablespoon measure, then weigh it to confirm it’s 15 grams. If you don’t have a scale, fill the tablespoon to just below the rim—no heaping or rounding.</p>

<h3>Common Mistakes When Measuring Liquids</h3>
<p>Many people tilt the spoon while measuring, which can lead to under or over-pouring. Keep the tablespoon level for an exact 15-gram measure. Also, avoid using oversized or deep spoons, as they can hold more liquid than a standard UK tablespoon.</p>

<h2>Using Apple Cider Vinegar in Air Fryer Recipes</h2>
<p>Apple cider vinegar adds brightness to dishes like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>air-fried vegetables</a> or acts as a tenderiser for meats. Since 1 tbsp equals 15 grams, you can easily scale recipes up or down. For a tangy glaze, mix 30 grams (2 tbsp) with honey and brush it over salmon fillets before air frying.</p>
<p>If you’re making a marinade, combine 15 grams of apple cider vinegar with olive oil and herbs for a balanced flavour. Too much vinegar can overpower the dish, so sticking to the 15-gram rule ensures harmony. For more inspiration, browse our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a>.</p>

<h3>Cleaning Your Air Fryer After Using Vinegar</h3>
<p>Apple cider vinegar can leave behind residue, so always wipe your air fryer basket with a damp cloth after use. For a deeper clean, try our recommended <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner</a> to maintain your appliance’s performance.</p>

<h2>Converting Other Vinegar Types to Grams</h2>
<p>While 1 tbsp of apple cider vinegar is 15 grams, other vinegars like white or balsamic may vary slightly due to density. Always check specific conversions if substituting. For example, balsamic vinegar is thicker, so 1 tbsp might weigh closer to 16–17 grams.</p>

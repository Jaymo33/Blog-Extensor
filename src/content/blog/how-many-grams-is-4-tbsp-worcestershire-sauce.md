<p>4 tablespoons (tbsp) of worcestershire sauce weigh approximately 60 grams (g). This conversion is handy for air fryer recipes where precise measurements matter. Whether you’re marinating chicken or adding depth to a beef dish, knowing the exact weight ensures consistent results. Visit <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> for more cooking tips and conversions.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on even cooking, and incorrect ingredient quantities can throw off your dish. Too much worcestershire sauce might make your meal overly salty, while too little could lack flavour. Grams provide a more precise measurement than tablespoons, especially for liquids. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for other common ingredient conversions. This ensures your recipes turn out perfectly every time.</p>  

<h3>How to measure worcestershire sauce correctly</h3>  
<p>For best results, use a digital kitchen scale to weigh worcestershire sauce in grams. If you don’t have one, a standard UK tablespoon holds about 15ml, which roughly translates to 15g for worcestershire sauce. However, viscosity can vary, so weighing is always more accurate. Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a> for dishes that use worcestershire sauce, like marinated meats or glazes.</p>  

<h2>Common recipes using 4 tbsp worcestershire sauce</h2>  
<p>Many air fryer recipes call for 4 tablespoons of worcestershire sauce, especially for marinades and sauces. Beef dishes, like air-fried steak bites, often use this amount for rich umami flavour. You can also try it in <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipes</a> or as a base for homemade BBQ sauce. The versatility of worcestershire sauce makes it a kitchen staple.</p>  

<h3>Substitutes if you run out of worcestershire sauce</h3>  
<p>If you’re short on worcestershire sauce, soy sauce mixed with a splash of vinegar and a pinch of sugar can work in a pinch. Alternatively, fish sauce or balsamic glaze can provide a similar depth of flavour. Just remember to adjust quantities to match the 60g weight of 4 tablespoons.

<h2>Cleaning tips after using worcestershire sauce</h2>

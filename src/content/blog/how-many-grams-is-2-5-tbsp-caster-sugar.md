<p>2.5 tablespoons of caster sugar equals approximately 31.25 grams in UK measurements. This conversion is essential for precise baking, especially when using an air fryer where ingredient accuracy impacts cooking results. Whether you’re making cakes, cookies, or desserts, knowing how many grams are in 2.5 tbsp of caster sugar ensures consistency. For more air fryer conversions, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate sugar measurements matter</h2>  
<p>Using the correct amount of caster sugar is crucial for achieving the right texture and sweetness in your air fryer recipes. Too much sugar can cause over-browning or uneven cooking, while too little may leave your baked goods bland. Measuring 2.5 tbsp of caster sugar in grams (31.25g) eliminates guesswork. This precision is especially important for air fryer baking, where heat distribution differs from conventional ovens. Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> for perfectly measured sweet treats.</p>  

<h3>How to measure 2.5 tbsp of caster sugar</h3>  
<p>For the most accurate results, use digital kitchen scales to weigh out 31.25 grams of caster sugar. If you don’t have scales, lightly spoon the sugar into a tablespoon and level it off with a knife—don’t pack it down. Repeat this process until you’ve measured 2.5 tablespoons. Remember, air fryer recipes often require precise measurements for best results, so weighing is ideal.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for 2.5 tbsp caster sugar</h2>  
<p>This quantity of sugar is perfect for small-batch air fryer desserts like mug cakes, shortbread, or fruit crumbles. It’s also useful for sweetening whipped cream or yoghurt toppings. Since air fryers cook faster than traditional ovens, getting the sugar quantity right ensures balanced flavours. For more inspiration, browse our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>air fryer cake recipes</a>.</p>  

<h3>Converting other sugar amounts</h3>  
<p>If your recipe calls for a different amount of caster sugar, here’s a handy rule: 1 tablespoon of caster sugar equals 12.5 grams in UK measurements. So for 3 tbsp, you’d need 37.5 grams, and for 1 tbsp, it’s 12.5 grams. Keep this conversion in mind when adjusting air fryer recipes to suit your taste.</p>  

<h2>Tips for baking with caster sugar in an air fryer</h2>  
<p>Caster sugar dissolves faster than granulated sugar, making it ideal for air fryer baking where cooking times are shorter. When using 2.5 tbsp (31.25g) in recipes, mix it thoroughly with other dry ingredients first. For easy cleaning after sugary bakes, try our recommended <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner</a>. Remember that sugar can caramelise quickly in the air fryer, so check your desserts frequently.</p>  

<h3>Storing caster sugar for air fryer use</h3>  
<p>Keep your caster sugar in an airtight container to prevent clumping, especially important for accurate 2.5 tbsp measurements. Humidity can affect sugar’s texture and weight, potentially altering your air fryer recipe results. For best results, measure your 31.25 grams of caster sugar just before use.</p>

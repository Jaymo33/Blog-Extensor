Many traditional British recipes, especially for cakes and slow-cooked meats, specify Gas Mark temperatures.</p><p id="">When converting 135 Celsius to Gas Mark, remember that most modern ovens display both measurements. However, air fryers typically only show Celsius or Fahrenheit, making these conversions vital. The 135 degrees C to Gas Mark equivalent is particularly important for recipes that require precise low-temperature cooking. At this heat, you can perfectly cook delicate items like meringues or slow-roast vegetables without burning them. It's also the ideal temperature for proofing dough or keeping dishes warm before serving.</p><h3 id="">Why 135 C Matters in Air Fryers</h3><p id="">While air fryers excel at high-temperature cooking, 135 C has several important uses.

Many of our <a href="https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert" id="">dessert recipes</a> benefit from this lower temperature setting. The circulating air in an air fryer cooks more efficiently than a conventional oven, so you might need to adjust cooking times slightly.</p><h2 id="">Practical Applications for 135 C to Gas Mark</h2><p id="">Converting 135 C to Gas Mark opens up a world of cooking possibilities. This temperature is ideal for slow-roasting tomatoes, drying herbs, or making perfect custards.

This means preheating time is significantly reduced - usually just 2-3 minutes at this temperature. The compact size of air fryers also means heat distribution is more even than in many ovens. For best results when cooking at Gas Mark 1 equivalent (135 C), shake or turn food halfway through cooking. This ensures even results, especially important when dehydrating or slow-cooking.</p><h2 id="">Converting Other Measurements to Gas Mark</h2><p id="">While we've focused on 135 C to Gas Mark, understanding the full temperature scale is helpful. Gas Mark temperatures range from Â¼ (107 C) to 9 (246 C), with each full mark representing about 13-14 degrees Celsius. This system was developed when most UK ovens were gas-powered, hence the name.

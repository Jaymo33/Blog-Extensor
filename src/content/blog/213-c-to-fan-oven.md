<p>213°C in a fan oven is equivalent to approximately 190°C when using the convection setting. This adjustment accounts for the efficient heat circulation in fan-assisted ovens and air fryers, ensuring even cooking without overheating. Whether you're baking, roasting, or air frying, this conversion is essential for perfect results every time.</p>

<h2>Why Convert 213°C to Fan Oven?</h2>
<p>Fan ovens and air fryers circulate hot air, which cooks food faster and more evenly than traditional ovens. This means you often need to reduce the temperature by 20-25°C to avoid burning or drying out your dishes. For example, 213°C in a conventional oven becomes 190°C in a fan oven or air fryer. This adjustment is crucial for recipes that require precise temperatures, like cakes or roasted meats.</p>
<p>At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we recommend always checking your appliance’s manual for specific guidelines, as some models may vary. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> can also help you navigate these adjustments effortlessly.</p>

<h2>How to Use 213°C in an Air Fryer</h2>
<p>Air fryers operate similarly to fan ovens, so the same temperature conversion applies. If a recipe calls for 213°C, set your air fryer to 190°C instead. This ensures your food cooks evenly without becoming overly crispy or dry. Popular recipes like crispy chicken or roasted vegetables benefit greatly from this adjustment.</p>

<h3>Common Dishes at 213°C Fan Setting</h3>
<p>Many classic dishes thrive at this temperature. Roast potatoes, for instance, achieve a golden crisp at 190°C in a fan oven or air fryer. Similarly, baked goods like scones or muffins rise beautifully without burning.

<h2>Tips for Perfect Results</h2>
<p>Always preheat your fan oven or air fryer to the converted temperature (190°C for 213°C) for consistent results. Use a meat thermometer for proteins, as fan-assisted cooking can reduce cooking times by up to 20%. Keep an eye on baked goods, as they may brown faster than expected.</p>
<p>Cleaning your air fryer after each use is also key. Our guide on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaning</a> makes maintenance a breeze.</p>

<h3>Avoiding Common Mistakes</h3>
<p>Overcrowding the air fryer basket or oven tray can block airflow, leading to uneven cooking. Stick to single layers for best results. Also, resist the urge to open the door frequently, as this causes temperature fluctuations.</p>

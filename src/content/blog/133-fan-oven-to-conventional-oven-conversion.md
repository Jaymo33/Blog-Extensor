<h2>Why Convert 133 Fan Oven to Conventional Oven?</h2>
<p>Fan ovens circulate hot air for faster, more even cooking, while conventional ovens rely on radiant heat. When a recipe calls for 133 fan oven, it's specifically designed for that cooking environment. Converting to conventional oven settings prevents under or overcooking your dishes. Many traditional recipes at <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> originally used conventional oven temperatures before fan ovens became popular. The 133 fan oven to conventional oven conversion is particularly useful for baking delicate items like cakes or pastries.</p>

<p>The general rule for converting fan oven to conventional oven is to increase the temperature by 20°C. So 133 fan oven becomes 150°C in a conventional oven.

<h3>How 133 Fan Oven Differs from Conventional Cooking</h3>

Always use an oven thermometer to verify your oven's actual temperature, as thermostat accuracy can vary significantly.</p>

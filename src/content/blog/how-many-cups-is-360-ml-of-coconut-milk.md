<p>360 ml of coconut milk is approximately 1.52 cups. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes, ensuring your dishes turn out perfectly every time. Whether you’re making a creamy curry or a decadent dessert, knowing the exact measurement helps avoid mishaps. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we focus on precise conversions to elevate your cooking. Keep reading for more details on measuring coconut milk for air fryer meals.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of coconut milk can make or break your air fryer dish. Too much liquid can lead to soggy results, while too little might dry out your food. Air fryers rely on circulating hot air, so precise measurements ensure even cooking. For example, a creamy coconut shrimp recipe needs exactly 360 ml (1.52 cups) of coconut milk to achieve the perfect consistency. Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> for more inspiration.</p>  

<p>Converting 360 ml of coconut milk to cups is straightforward with the right tools. A standard measuring cup or kitchen scale ensures accuracy, especially for international recipes. If you’re in the UK or USA, the conversion remains the same, as 1 cup equals 236.59 ml. For more conversions, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure 360 ml of Coconut Milk Without a Scale</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a scale, use a liquid measuring cup marked in millilitres. Fill it to the 360 ml line for accuracy. Alternatively, use a standard cup and measure 1.52 cups of coconut milk. Stir the milk well before measuring, as it can separate. This method works for both canned and homemade coconut milk in air fryer recipes.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for 360 ml of Coconut Milk in Air Fryer Recipes</h2>  
<p>360 ml of coconut milk is perfect for creamy curries, like a Thai green curry or a coconut-based marinade. It’s also ideal for baking, such as coconut milk cakes or puddings in the air fryer. The richness of coconut milk adds depth to sauces and soups. For a quick dessert, try our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>air fryer dessert recipes</a> using this measurement.</p>  

<p>Another great use is in vegan or dairy-free air fryer dishes. Coconut milk substitutes cream in mashed potatoes or creamy pasta sauces. Its natural sweetness also enhances breakfast items like coconut oatmeal. Always store leftover coconut milk in the fridge and shake well before reuse.

<h3>Tips for Storing Leftover Coconut Milk</h3>  
<p>After measuring 360 ml of coconut milk, store the rest in an airtight container. It keeps for up to 4 days in the fridge or 2 months in the freezer. Label the container with the date to track freshness. Thaw frozen coconut milk in the fridge overnight before using it in your next air fryer recipe.</p>

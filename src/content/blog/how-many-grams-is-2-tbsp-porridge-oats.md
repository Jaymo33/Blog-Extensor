<p>2 tablespoons (tbsp) of porridge oats weigh approximately 16 grams in the UK. This measurement is essential for precise cooking, especially when using an air fryer for breakfast dishes like granola or oat-based bakes. Whether you’re following a recipe from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> or experimenting with your own creations, accurate measurements ensure consistent results every time.</p>  

<h2>Why measuring porridge oats accurately matters</h2>  
<p>Using the correct weight for porridge oats ensures your air fryer recipes turn out perfectly. Too many oats can make dishes dry, while too few might leave them undercooked or soggy. For example, if you’re making air fryer granola from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>our recipe collection</a>, 16 grams per 2 tbsp helps balance texture and flavour. Precision is key for meal prep, too, as it guarantees portion control and nutritional accuracy.</p>  

<p>Many UK recipes use grams rather than tablespoons for consistency, as scoop sizes can vary. A digital kitchen scale is the best tool for this, but if you don’t have one, our conversion ensures you won’t go wrong.

<h3>How to measure porridge oats without scales</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a scale, use a standard UK tablespoon (15ml) and level it off for accuracy.

Remember, 2 tbsp of porridge oats equals roughly 16 grams, whether you’re using jumbo oats or fine milled varieties.</p>

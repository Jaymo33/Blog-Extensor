<p>75g of icing sugar equals approximately 2.65 ounces. This conversion is essential for bakers who need precise measurements, especially when using an air fryer for desserts like cakes or cookies. Whether you’re following a UK recipe or adapting one from abroad, knowing how to convert grams to ounces ensures your baked goods turn out perfectly every time.</p>  

<h2>Why Convert 75g of Icing Sugar to Ounces?</h2>  
<p>Many UK recipes use grams, while others rely on ounces, making conversions a common kitchen task. If you’re using an air fryer for baking, precise measurements are crucial for texture and consistency. Icing sugar, also known as powdered sugar, is often used in glazes, frostings, and dusting, so getting the amount right matters. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we recommend using a digital scale for accuracy, but knowing the conversion helps when you’re in a pinch.</p>  

<p>Converting 75g of icing sugar to ounces is simple once you know the ratio. One gram equals roughly 0.035 ounces, so 75g translates to about 2.65 ounces. This small but precise measurement can make all the difference in recipes like air fryer <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>cakes</a> or cookies, where too much or too little sugar can affect the outcome.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure 75g of Icing Sugar Without a Scale</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a scale, you can still measure 75g of icing sugar using volume. One cup of icing sugar weighs around 120g, so 75g is roughly two-thirds of a cup. However, this method isn’t as precise as weighing, so for best results, invest in a kitchen scale. For more tips on accurate measurements, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for 75g of Icing Sugar</h2>  
<p>Icing sugar is a versatile ingredient in both traditional and air fryer baking. A 75g portion is perfect for making glazes for <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>desserts</a>, dusting over doughnuts, or sweetening whipped cream. In an air fryer, it’s often used to finish treats like churros or cinnamon rolls, giving them a professional touch.</p>  

<p>When working with 75g of icing sugar, sifting is key to avoiding lumps, especially in frostings. If you’re adapting a recipe from ounces to grams, remember that 2.65 ounces of icing sugar will give you the same result as 75g.

<h3>Tips for Storing Icing Sugar</h3>  
<p>To keep your icing sugar fresh, store it in an airtight container away from moisture. Humidity can cause clumping, which makes measuring 75g accurately more difficult. If your sugar has hardened, a quick blitz in a blender or sieve can restore its powdery texture.

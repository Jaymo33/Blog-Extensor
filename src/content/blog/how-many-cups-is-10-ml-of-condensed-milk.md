<p>10 ml of condensed milk is roughly equal to 0.042 cups. This small but precise measurement is crucial for air fryer recipes where accuracy can make or break your dish. Whether you're whipping up a dessert or adding a touch of sweetness to a savoury meal, knowing how to convert 10 ml of condensed milk to cups ensures perfect results every time.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on precise cooking times and ingredient ratios to deliver crispy, evenly cooked dishes. Using too much or too little condensed milk can affect texture and flavour, especially in baked goods like cakes or cookies. For example, adding even slightly more than 10 ml of condensed milk could make your dessert overly sweet or alter its consistency. That’s why conversions like 10 ml to cups are essential for air fryer enthusiasts.</p>  
<p>If you're new to air frying, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for other common measurement conversions. It’s a handy tool for ensuring your recipes turn out just right, whether you're working with liquids like condensed milk or dry ingredients.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure 10 ml of Condensed Milk Without a Scale</h3>  
<p>Not everyone has a kitchen scale or measuring jug handy, but you can still measure 10 ml of condensed milk accurately. A standard teaspoon holds about 5 ml, so two level teaspoons will give you roughly 10 ml. Alternatively, use a tablespoon (15 ml) and fill it two-thirds of the way. For more precise baking, consider investing in a set of measuring spoons or a small liquid measuring cup.</p>  

<h2>Common Recipes Using 10 ml of Condensed Milk</h2>  
<p>Condensed milk is a versatile ingredient in both sweet and savoury dishes. In air fryer cooking, 10 ml might be used to glaze pastries, sweeten coffee-based desserts, or add richness to sauces. For inspiration, browse our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> collection, which includes everything from caramel drizzles to creamy fillings.</p>  
<p>One popular use for 10 ml of condensed milk is in air fryer banana bread. The small amount adds moisture without overpowering the flavour. You could also mix it into a marinade for meats like chicken or pork, giving them a subtle sweetness that caramelises beautifully in the air fryer.</p>  

<h3>UK vs. US Cup Measurements</h3>  
<p>It’s worth noting that UK and US cup measurements differ slightly. In the UK, 1 cup is 284 ml, while in the US, it’s 240 ml. However, for small quantities like 10 ml of condensed milk, the difference is negligible (0.042 UK cups vs. 0.042 US cups). For larger amounts, always double-check which standard your recipe follows.</p>  

<h2>Tips for Working with Condensed Milk in an Air Fryer</h2>  
<p>Condensed milk can thicken or caramelise quickly in an air fryer’s high heat. To prevent burning, mix it with other liquids (like milk or water) if using it as a glaze. For sticky residues, clean your air fryer basket promptly with our recommended <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner</a> to maintain its non-stick surface.</p>  
<p>If you're experimenting with condensed milk in air fryer desserts, start with small amounts like 10 ml and adjust to taste. Its intense sweetness means a little goes a long way, especially in recipes where balance is key.</p>  

<h3>Converting Other Condensed Milk Amounts</h3>  
<p>Need to scale up? Here’s a quick reference: 20 ml ≈ 0.085 cups, 50 ml ≈ 0.21 cups, and 100 ml ≈ 0.42 cups. Bookmark this page or our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert recipes</a> section for more conversion tips and recipe ideas.</p>

<h2>Why converting 500g of soft cheese to ounces matters</h2>  
<p>Accurate measurements are crucial in cooking, especially when using an air fryer. Soft cheese, like cream cheese or ricotta, often appears in recipes with measurements in grams or ounces. Converting 500g of soft cheese to ounces (17.64 oz) helps you follow recipes precisely, whether you're using a UK or international cookbook. This ensures consistency in texture and flavour, which is vital for dishes like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer cheesecakes</a> or stuffed mushrooms.</p>  

<p>Many air fryer recipes, especially those from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, provide measurements in both grams and ounces. However, if you only have a kitchen scale that measures in grams, knowing the ounce equivalent saves time and avoids guesswork. Soft cheese can vary in density, so weighing it ensures you’re using the right amount for your dish.</p>  

<h3>How to measure 500g of soft cheese accurately</h3>  
<p>To measure 500g of soft cheese, use a digital kitchen scale for precision. Place your bowl or container on the scale, tare it to zero, then add the cheese until it reaches 500g. If your scale only shows ounces, aim for 17.64 oz. For recipes that call for cups, note that 500g of soft cheese is roughly 2 cups, but weighing is always more accurate.</p>

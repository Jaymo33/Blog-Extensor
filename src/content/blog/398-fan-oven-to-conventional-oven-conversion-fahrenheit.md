<p>398°F in a fan oven converts to approximately 356°F in a conventional oven. This adjustment accounts for the efficient heat distribution of fan-assisted ovens, which cook food faster and more evenly. If you're using an air fryer, you might need to tweak the temperature further, as air fryers also rely on rapid air circulation. For precise conversions, refer to our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>

<h2>Why Convert 398 Fan Oven to Conventional Oven?</h2>
<p>Fan ovens and conventional ovens heat food differently, which affects cooking times and results. A fan oven circulates hot air, reducing cooking time by about 20°C (or 36°F) compared to a conventional oven. This means recipes designed for fan ovens often need adjustment when using a traditional oven. For example, a recipe calling for 398°F in a fan oven would typically require 356°F in a conventional oven.</p>
<p>Understanding this conversion is especially useful if you're switching between appliances or adapting recipes. Many modern recipes, including those on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, specify fan oven temperatures, so knowing how to convert them ensures your dishes turn out perfectly. This is also handy for air fryer users, as air fryers operate similarly to fan ovens.</p>

<h2>How to Adjust Cooking Times</h2>
<p>Converting the temperature is only half the battle—you'll also need to adjust the cooking time. Since fan ovens cook faster, reducing the temperature alone isn't always enough. As a rule of thumb, decrease the cooking time by 5-10 minutes when using a conventional oven. Keep an eye on your dish, especially if it's something delicate like cakes or pastries.</p>
<p>For air fryers, the cooking time might be even shorter due to their compact size and intense heat circulation. If you're adapting a fan oven recipe for an air fryer, start by reducing the temperature by 20°F and checking for doneness a few minutes early. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>cake recipes</a> include specific air fryer adjustments to help you get it right.</p>

<h3>Common Mistakes to Avoid</h3>
<p>One of the biggest mistakes is assuming fan and conventional ovens are interchangeable without adjustments. This can lead to overcooked or undercooked food. Another pitfall is forgetting to preheat your oven—fan ovens heat up faster, so you might need to wait longer for a conventional oven to reach the desired temperature.</p>

<h2>Using an Air Fryer Instead</h2>
<p>Air fryers work similarly to fan ovens but on a smaller scale. If a recipe calls for 398°F in a fan oven, you can often use the same temperature in an air fryer but reduce the cooking time by 10-15%. For example, chicken wings that take 25 minutes in a fan oven might only need 20 minutes in an air fryer. Always check for doneness a few minutes early to avoid overcooking.</p>

<h3>When to Stick to the Original Temperature</h3>
<p>Some dishes, like roasts or baked potatoes, benefit from a consistent temperature regardless of the oven type. In these cases, you might not need to adjust the temperature much, but keep an eye on the cooking time. For delicate items like soufflés or meringues, sticking close to the original temperature is often best.</p>

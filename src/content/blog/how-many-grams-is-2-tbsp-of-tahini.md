<p>2 tablespoons (tbsp) of tahini weigh approximately 30 grams (g). This conversion is useful for precise measurements, especially when preparing air fryer recipes where consistency matters. Whether you're making hummus, dressings, or marinades, knowing the weight ensures perfect results every time. For more air fryer conversions, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>  

<h2>Why measure tahini in grams?</h2>  
<p>Measuring tahini in grams provides accuracy, which is crucial for recipes where texture and balance matter. Unlike volume measurements (like tablespoons), weight measurements account for variations in density. Tahini can settle or separate, making volume measurements less reliable. If you're preparing a dish like roasted vegetables in your air fryer, precise tahini quantities ensure even coating. For more recipe ideas, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a>.</p>  

<p>Using grams also simplifies scaling recipes up or down. For example, if a recipe calls for 4 tbsp of tahini, you now know that’s roughly 60 grams. This is especially helpful when batch-cooking or meal prepping. If you love tahini-based sauces, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable recipes</a> for pairing ideas.</p>  

<h3>How to measure tahini accurately</h3>  
<p>To measure tahini properly, stir it well to reincorporate any separated oil. Use a spoon to scoop it into a tablespoon measure, then level it off with a knife. For grams, a kitchen scale is ideal—simply tare your bowl and add tahini until it hits 30 grams. This method avoids guesswork and guarantees consistency, whether you're making dressings or marinating proteins for the air fryer.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for tahini in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Tahini adds richness and depth to many air fryer dishes. Try mixing it with lemon juice and garlic for a quick sauce to drizzle over air-fried chicken or roasted veggies. It also works well in marinades for tofu or salmon, giving them a nutty, creamy coating. For inspiration, browse our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipes</a> featuring tahini-based glazes.</p>  

<p>Another great use is in homemade energy bites or granola bars—just combine tahini with oats, honey, and nuts before air-frying for a crispy finish. Cleaning tahini residue from your air fryer? Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner guide</a> has tips to keep it spotless.</p>  

<h3>Converting other tahini quantities</h3>  
<p>If your recipe uses different tahini amounts, here’s a quick reference: 1 tbsp = ~15g, 3 tbsp = ~45g, and ¼ cup = ~60g. These conversions help adapt international recipes or adjust serving sizes.

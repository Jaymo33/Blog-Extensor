<h2>Why measure tahini in grams?</h2>  
<p>Measuring tahini in grams provides accuracy, which is crucial for recipes where texture and balance matter. Unlike volume measurements (like tablespoons), weight measurements account for variations in density. Tahini can settle or separate, making volume measurements less reliable. If you're preparing a dish like roasted vegetables in your air fryer, precise tahini quantities ensure even coating.

<p>Using grams also simplifies scaling recipes up or down. For example, if a recipe calls for 4 tbsp of tahini, you now know that’s roughly 60 grams. This is especially helpful when batch-cooking or meal prepping.

<h3>How to measure tahini accurately</h3>  
<p>To measure tahini properly, stir it well to reincorporate any separated oil. Use a spoon to scoop it into a tablespoon measure, then level it off with a knife. For grams, a kitchen scale is ideal—simply tare your bowl and add tahini until it hits 30 grams. This method avoids guesswork and guarantees consistency, whether you're making dressings or marinating proteins for the air fryer.</p>

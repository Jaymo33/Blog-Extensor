<p>4 tablespoons (tbsp) of minced garlic equals approximately 48 grams. This conversion is essential for precise cooking, especially when using an air fryer where measurements can impact texture and flavour. Whether you're following a recipe from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> or adjusting portions, knowing the gram equivalent ensures accuracy.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate garlic measurements matter</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of minced garlic can make or break a dish. Too little, and your meal lacks depth; too much, and it overpowers other flavours. In air fryer cooking, precise measurements help avoid uneven cooking or overly pungent results. For example, recipes like garlic butter shrimp or roasted vegetables rely on balanced garlic quantities for the best taste.</p>  
<p>If you're exploring <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a>, you'll notice many UK-based guides use grams for consistency. Converting 4 tbsp of minced garlic to grams ensures you stay on track, whether you're meal prepping or cooking for one. A digital kitchen scale is a handy tool for these conversions, especially when dealing with sticky ingredients like minced garlic.</p>  

<h3>How to measure minced garlic correctly</h3>  
<p>To get an accurate 48 grams from 4 tbsp of minced garlic, pack the spoon lightly without crushing the pieces. Minced garlic can vary in density, so levelling off the tablespoon ensures consistency. If you're using pre-minced garlic from a jar, drain excess liquid first, as it can skew the weight.</p>  

<h2>Common conversions for minced garlic</h2>  
<p>Beyond 4 tbsp, here are other useful minced garlic conversions: 1 tbsp equals roughly 12 grams, while a teaspoon (tsp) is about 4 grams. These measurements come in handy when scaling recipes up or down. For example, if a recipe calls for 2 tbsp of minced garlic, you’d use 24 grams instead.</p>  
<p>Bookmarking a reliable <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a> can save time, especially when experimenting with air fryer dishes like garlic mushrooms or crispy tofu. Grams provide a universal standard, eliminating guesswork whether you're cooking for a family or prepping freezer-friendly meals.</p>  

<h3>Adjusting garlic quantities in air fryer recipes</h3>  
<p>Air fryers circulate hot air, intensifying flavours like garlic. If a recipe calls for 4 tbsp (48 grams) but you prefer milder taste, reduce it to 2–3 tbsp. Conversely, for bold flavours, add an extra half tablespoon. Always taste-test before serving, as air frying can concentrate seasonings more than oven baking.</p>  

<h2>Storing minced garlic for future use</h2>  
<p>Pre-minced garlic saves time, but proper storage keeps it fresh. Transfer jarred minced garlic to an airtight container and refrigerate for up to two weeks. For longer storage, freeze minced garlic in ice cube trays—each cube holds about 1 tbsp (12 grams). Thaw as needed for recipes like garlic bread or <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>garlic butter chicken</a>.</p>  
<p>If you’re using fresh garlic, mince a whole bulb and store it with a drizzle of olive oil to prevent drying. This method works well for frequent air fryer users who prep ingredients ahead. Just remember: 4 tbsp of this mix still equals roughly 48 grams, oil included.</p>  

<h3>Cleaning your air fryer after garlic-heavy recipes</h3>  
<p>Garlic leaves a strong odour if not cleaned properly. After cooking, wipe your air fryer basket with a damp cloth and mild detergent. For stubborn residue, use a non-abrasive sponge or <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner</a>. A quick rinse with vinegar water neutralises lingering smells, keeping your appliance ready for the next recipe.</p>

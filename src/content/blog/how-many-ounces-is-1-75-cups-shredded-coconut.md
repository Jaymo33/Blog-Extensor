<p>1.75 cups of shredded coconut equals approximately 5.25 ounces (or 5.25 oz) in UK measurements. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes, ensuring your dishes turn out perfectly every time. Whether you’re making coconut-crusted shrimp or a tropical dessert, precise measurements matter.</p>

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>
<p>Air fryers rely on even cooking, and incorrect measurements can lead to uneven results.

Using 1.75 cups of shredded coconut (5.25 oz) ensures consistency, especially in recipes like coconut chicken or baked goods.</p>

<h2>How to measure shredded coconut correctly</h2>
<p>Measuring shredded coconut can be tricky due to its light, fluffy texture. For 1.75 cups, lightly spoon the coconut into a measuring cup without packing it down. This ensures you get the right weight (5.25 oz) without overloading your recipe.</p>
<p>If you’re using a kitchen scale, simply weigh out 5.25 ounces for perfect accuracy. This method is especially useful for air fryer recipes, where precision can make or break your dish.

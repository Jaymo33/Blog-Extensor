<p>1.33 cups of granulated sugar equals approximately 9.5 ounces (oz) in UK measurements. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precision matters, ensuring your desserts and baked goods turn out perfectly every time. Whether you're whipping up a cake or preparing a sweet glaze, knowing the exact weight helps avoid kitchen mishaps.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Sugar Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Using the correct amount of granulated sugar is crucial for air fryer recipes, as it affects texture, browning, and sweetness. Too much sugar can cause excessive caramelisation or burning, while too little may leave your dish bland. For example, air fryer cakes or cookies rely on precise sugar ratios to achieve the perfect rise and crunch. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more handy measurement guides.</p>  

<p>Granulated sugar is a common ingredient in many air fryer recipes, from crispy churros to glazed doughnuts. If you're experimenting with <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>air fryer cakes</a>, getting the sugar measurement right ensures a light, fluffy texture. Even savoury dishes sometimes need a pinch of sugar to balance flavours, making conversions like 1.33 cups to ounces invaluable.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure Granulated Sugar for Air Fryer Recipes</h3>  
<p>The best way to measure granulated sugar is by weight for accuracy, especially when scaling recipes. If you don’t have scales, spoon the sugar into a measuring cup and level it off—never pack it down. For 1.33 cups, this method ensures you’re close to the 9.5-ounce mark. Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> for inspiration on using sugar in creative ways.</p>  

<h2>Common Air Fryer Recipes Using 1.33 Cups of Sugar</h2>  
<p>Many air fryer desserts call for around 1.33 cups of granulated sugar, such as cinnamon rolls or fruit crumbles. This quantity is also ideal for syrups or glazes that add shine and sweetness to baked goods. If you're making a large batch of cookies, this measurement ensures consistent results across all batches. Visit our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert category</a> for more sugar-centric ideas.</p>  

<p>Granulated sugar isn’t just for sweets—it’s also used in marinades and rubs for meats like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>air fryer chicken</a>. A balanced sugar ratio helps achieve a caramelised exterior without burning. Whether you're baking or cooking, keeping conversions like 1.33 cups to ounces handy saves time and improves results.</p>  

<h3>Tips for Storing and Using Granulated Sugar</h3>  
<p>Store granulated sugar in an airtight container to prevent clumping, especially in humid kitchens. If your sugar hardens, a quick blitz in the food processor restores its texture.

<p>Many UK cooks use grams, but some recipes list ounces, making conversions crucial. A digital kitchen scale simplifies this, but memorising common conversions like 5g to ounces saves time. For creamy desserts like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>air fryer cheesecake</a>, precise whipping cream measurements are key to achieving the right texture.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure 5g of Whipping Cream Without a Scale</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a scale, use a measuring spoon: 5g of whipping cream is roughly 1 teaspoon. Note that this method is less accurate, as cream’s density varies with temperature. For air fryer baking, we recommend investing in a scale—check our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/buying>buying guide</a> for affordable options.</p>

<h3>Converting Larger Quantities</h3>

<p>35 ml of lime juice equals approximately 0.148 cups (or just under 1/7 of a cup). This precise measurement is essential for air fryer recipes where balance is key—too much or too little lime juice can alter flavours and textures. Whether you’re making a tangy marinade or a citrusy glaze, knowing how to convert 35 ml of lime juice to cups ensures consistent results every time.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Lime Juice Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>In air fryer cooking, precision is everything. Lime juice adds acidity and brightness to dishes, but even a small deviation can throw off the taste. For example, a marinade with too much lime juice might overpower delicate proteins like chicken or shrimp. Conversely, too little could leave your dish tasting flat. By converting 35 ml of lime juice to cups accurately, you’ll nail the perfect balance for recipes like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer lime-glazed salmon</a> or zesty vegetable stir-fries.</p>  

<p>Lime juice also plays a role in baking, where acidity interacts with leavening agents. If you’re adapting a cake or cookie recipe for the air fryer, measuring 35 ml of lime juice correctly ensures the right rise and texture.

<h3>How to Measure 35 ml of Lime Juice Without a Scale</h3>  
<p>Don’t have a measuring jug? No problem! A standard tablespoon holds about 15 ml, so 35 ml is roughly 2 tablespoons plus 1 teaspoon. For cups, use a 1/4 cup measure and fill it just over halfway. This method works well for quick recipes like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>air fryer lime chicken</a>, where precision matters but speed is key.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for 35 ml of Lime Juice in Air Fryer Recipes</h2>  
<p>This small but mighty quantity of lime juice can transform dishes. Try it in a marinade for shrimp—35 ml of lime juice, garlic, and chilli creates a vibrant base. Or drizzle it over air-fried sweet potatoes for a tangy twist. Lime juice also works wonders in dressings; mix 35 ml with olive oil and herbs for a quick salad topper.</p>  

<p>For dessert lovers, 35 ml of lime juice is perfect for key lime pie fillings or citrus-infused cakes. If you’re experimenting, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a> has plenty of inspiration.

<h3>UK vs. US Cup Measurements for Lime Juice</h3>  
<p>While 35 ml of lime juice is roughly 0.148 US cups, UK cups are slightly larger (284 ml vs. 240 ml). For absolute precision in British recipes, 35 ml equals about 0.123 UK cups. This tiny difference rarely impacts air fryer cooking, but it’s worth noting for baking. Stick to ml for foolproof accuracy, especially in recipes like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>citrus desserts</a>.</p>  

<h2>Tips for Storing Leftover Lime Juice</h2>  
<p>Opened a bottle for your 35 ml measurement? Store the rest in an airtight container in the fridge for up to a week. Freeze lime juice in ice cube trays (each cube is ~30 ml) for future air fryer recipes. This trick saves time and reduces waste—perfect for meal preppers!</p>

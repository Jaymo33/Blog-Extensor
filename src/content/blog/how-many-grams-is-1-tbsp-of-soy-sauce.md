<p>1 tablespoon (tbsp) of soy sauce weighs approximately 15 grams. This measurement is essential for precision in cooking, especially when using an air fryer, where ingredient ratios can affect texture and flavour.

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air frying</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on even cooking, and incorrect measurements can lead to uneven results. Too much soy sauce might make your dish overly salty or soggy, while too little could leave it bland. Measuring 1 tbsp of soy sauce in grams (15g) helps maintain balance, especially in marinades or sauces.

<p>Many UK recipes list soy sauce in tablespoons, but grams provide a more precise measurement. This is particularly useful for batch cooking or scaling recipes. A digital kitchen scale is the best tool for accuracy, but if you don’t have one, remember that 1 tbsp equals roughly 15 grams.

<h2>Converting 1 tbsp soy sauce to grams</h2>  
<p>Converting 1 tbsp of soy sauce to grams is straightforward: it’s 15g. However, factors like brand and viscosity can cause slight variations. For example, low-sodium soy sauce might weigh slightly less due to reduced density. Always check labels if precision is critical, such as in dietary tracking or baking. Need more conversions?

<h3>Measuring without a scale</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a scale, use a standard UK tablespoon (15ml) for liquid measurements. Fill it level to the brim for accuracy. Avoid heaping or underfilling, as this can skew the 15-gram equivalent. For sticky sauces like soy sauce, lightly grease the spoon to ensure a clean pour.

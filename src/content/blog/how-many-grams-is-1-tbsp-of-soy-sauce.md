<p>1 tablespoon (tbsp) of soy sauce weighs approximately 15 grams. This measurement is essential for precision in cooking, especially when using an air fryer, where ingredient ratios can affect texture and flavour. Whether you're marinating chicken, seasoning tofu, or preparing a stir-fry, knowing the exact weight ensures consistency. For more air fryer measurement tips, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air frying</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on even cooking, and incorrect measurements can lead to uneven results. Too much soy sauce might make your dish overly salty or soggy, while too little could leave it bland. Measuring 1 tbsp of soy sauce in grams (15g) helps maintain balance, especially in marinades or sauces. If you're new to air frying, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a> for foolproof ideas.</p>  

<p>Many UK recipes list soy sauce in tablespoons, but grams provide a more precise measurement. This is particularly useful for batch cooking or scaling recipes. A digital kitchen scale is the best tool for accuracy, but if you don’t have one, remember that 1 tbsp equals roughly 15 grams.

<h2>Converting 1 tbsp soy sauce to grams</h2>  
<p>Converting 1 tbsp of soy sauce to grams is straightforward: it’s 15g. However, factors like brand and viscosity can cause slight variations. For example, low-sodium soy sauce might weigh slightly less due to reduced density. Always check labels if precision is critical, such as in dietary tracking or baking. Need more conversions? Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a> covers common ingredients.</p>  

<h3>Measuring without a scale</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a scale, use a standard UK tablespoon (15ml) for liquid measurements. Fill it level to the brim for accuracy. Avoid heaping or underfilling, as this can skew the 15-gram equivalent. For sticky sauces like soy sauce, lightly grease the spoon to ensure a clean pour.

<h2>Common uses for 1 tbsp soy sauce in air fryer recipes</h2>  
<p>1 tbsp (15g) of soy sauce is a versatile ingredient in air fryer cooking. It’s perfect for marinating proteins like chicken, beef, or tofu, adding depth of flavour without excess liquid. Try it in our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipes</a> for a savoury glaze. You can also mix it with honey or garlic for a quick sauce.</p>  

<p>For vegetables, a light drizzle of soy sauce enhances natural flavours. Toss broccoli, mushrooms, or green beans with 1 tbsp (15g) before air frying for a delicious side dish. Remember, soy sauce is salty, so adjust additional seasonings accordingly. Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable recipes</a> for more ideas.</p>

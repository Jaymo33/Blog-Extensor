<p>885 ml of condensed milk is approximately 3.75 cups. This conversion is essential for baking, especially when using an air fryer for desserts like fudge or cheesecake. Whether you're following a UK or US recipe, knowing how to measure condensed milk accurately ensures perfect results every time.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Condensed milk is a sticky, thick ingredient that can throw off a recipe if measured incorrectly. Too much can make desserts overly sweet or dense, while too little may affect texture. For air fryer recipes, precision is key since cooking times and temperatures are tightly controlled. A slight variation could mean undercooked or burnt results.</p>  

<p>If you're using an air fryer for baking, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for other common ingredient swaps. It’s a lifesaver when adapting traditional oven recipes to your air fryer. Plus, condensed milk is a staple in many <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert recipes</a>, so getting the measurement right is crucial.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure 885 ml of Condensed Milk</h3>  
<p>Using a liquid measuring cup is the easiest way to measure 885 ml of condensed milk. Lightly grease the cup with oil to help the sticky milk slide out smoothly. Alternatively, weigh it—condensed milk weighs roughly 1.3 grams per ml, so 885 ml equals about 1,150 grams.</p>  

<h2>UK vs. US Cup Measurements</h2>  
<p>While 885 ml of condensed milk converts to roughly 3.75 cups, it’s worth noting that UK and US cup sizes differ slightly. A UK cup is 284 ml, while a US cup is 240 ml. For most recipes, the difference is negligible, but for precision baking, stick to one measurement system.</p>  

<p>If you’re scaling a recipe, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a> includes both metric and imperial measurements to avoid confusion. Many air fryer desserts, like banoffee pie or caramel slices, rely on condensed milk, so double-check your conversions before starting.</p>  

<h3>Common Recipes Using 885 ml of Condensed Milk</h3>  
<p>This quantity is often found in larger batches of fudge, ice cream, or no-bake cheesecakes. In an air fryer, you can use it for mini custard tarts or dulce de leche. For a quick treat, try mixing it with cocoa powder and freezing for homemade chocolate bars.</p>  

<h2>Tips for Working with Condensed Milk</h2>  
<p>Warm the can slightly in hot water before opening to make pouring easier. If substituting evaporated milk, add sugar—condensed milk is pre-sweetened. For a healthier twist, try reduced-fat versions, but note they may alter texture. Always store leftovers in an airtight container in the fridge.</p>

And if you’re experimenting with <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>cake recipes</a>, precise measurements ensure fluffy, even results.</p>

<p>310 ml of lime juice is approximately 1.31 cups in the UK or 1.31 US customary cups. This conversion is essential for precise baking or cooking, especially when using an air fryer where ingredient ratios can affect results. Whether you're making a zesty marinade or a tangy dessert, knowing how to convert millilitres to cups ensures your dish turns out perfectly every time.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Lime Juice Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of lime juice can make or break a recipe. Too little, and your dish might lack flavour; too much, and it could become overpoweringly tart. For air fryer recipes, precise measurements are even more critical because the cooking process is faster and more intense. A well-balanced lime juice measurement ensures your marinades, glazes, or dressings complement your dish without overwhelming it.</p>  
<p>If you're following a recipe from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, you'll often find measurements in millilitres or grams. Converting 310 ml of lime juice to cups helps if you prefer using cup measurements or if your kitchen tools are limited to cups. This is especially handy for quick adjustments when scaling recipes up or down.</p>  

<h2>UK vs. US Cup Measurements</h2>  
<p>It's important to note that UK and US cup measurements differ slightly. A UK cup holds 284 ml, while a US customary cup is 240 ml. However, for 310 ml of lime juice, the difference is minimal—roughly 1.31 cups in both systems. This small variance usually doesn’t affect most recipes, but for precision baking, it’s worth double-checking which cup measurement your recipe uses.</p>  
<p>If you're unsure, refer to an <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for quick reference. Many air fryer recipes, like those for citrus-glazed chicken or lime-infused desserts, rely on accurate liquid measurements to achieve the right consistency and flavour balance.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure 310 ml of Lime Juice Without a Scale</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a measuring jug or scale, you can still measure 310 ml of lime juice using standard cups. Fill a UK or US cup to the brim, then add another roughly one-third cup to reach 310 ml. For even more accuracy, use tablespoons—20 UK tablespoons or 21 US tablespoons equal approximately 310 ml. This method is handy for quick adjustments when preparing marinades or dressings for air fryer dishes.</p>  

<h2>Common Recipes Using 310 ml of Lime Juice</h2>  
<p>310 ml of lime juice is a common measurement in many recipes, particularly those with bold, citrusy flavours.

<p>860 ml of apple cider vinegar is roughly 3.63 cups in the UK or 3.64 cups in the US. This conversion is essential for recipes that require precise measurements, especially when using an air fryer. Whether you're marinating chicken or baking a cake, knowing how to convert millilitres to cups ensures your dish turns out perfectly every time.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>When cooking or baking, especially with an air fryer, precision is key. Too much or too little apple cider vinegar can alter the taste and texture of your dish. For example, if you're making a tangy glaze for <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>air fryer chicken</a>, an extra splash could overpower the flavours. Conversely, too little might leave your dish bland.</p>  
<p>Apple cider vinegar is a common ingredient in many recipes, from dressings to pickling solutions. If you're following a recipe from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, knowing how to convert 860 ml to cups ensures you stick to the intended flavour profile. This is particularly important for air fryer cooking, where ingredients cook faster and more intensely.</p>  

<h2>UK vs. US Cup Measurements</h2>  
<p>Did you know that UK and US cup measurements differ slightly? In the UK, 1 cup equals 284 ml, while in the US, it's 240 ml. This means 860 ml of apple cider vinegar converts to approximately 3.63 cups in the UK and 3.64 cups in the US. While the difference is minimal, it's worth noting for precision.</p>  
<p>If you're using an air fryer, these small variations can matter, especially in baking. For example, a <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>cake recipe</a> might call for exact measurements to achieve the right rise and texture. Always check whether your recipe uses UK or US measurements to avoid mishaps.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure 860 ml Without a Measuring Cup</h3>  
<p>Don't have a measuring cup? No problem. You can use a kitchen scale to weigh 860 ml of apple cider vinegar, as 1 ml weighs roughly 1 gram. Alternatively, use a standard mug (about 300 ml) and adjust accordingly. For air fryer recipes, precision is still key, so double-check your conversions.</p>  

<h3>Common Uses for 860 ml of Apple Cider Vinegar</h3>  
<p>Apple cider vinegar is versatile. You might use 860 ml for making a large batch of salad dressing, pickling vegetables, or even cleaning your <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer</a>. Its acidity helps break down grease and grime, making it a handy kitchen staple beyond cooking.</p>

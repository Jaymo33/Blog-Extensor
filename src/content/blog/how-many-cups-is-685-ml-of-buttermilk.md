<p>685 ml of buttermilk equals approximately 2.89 cups in the US measurement system and roughly 2.42 cups in the UK metric cup system. This conversion is essential for baking and cooking, especially when using precise recipes in your air fryer. Whether you're whipping up fluffy pancakes or tender fried chicken, getting the buttermilk measurement right makes all the difference.</p>

<h2>Understanding Buttermilk Measurements</h2>  
<p>Buttermilk is a staple in many recipes, from fluffy American-style pancakes to crispy air-fried chicken. Its slightly tangy flavour and thick consistency make it perfect for tenderising meats and adding moisture to baked goods. When a recipe calls for 685 ml of buttermilk, you'll want to measure it accurately to ensure perfect results every time.</p>  
<p>In the UK, 1 metric cup equals 250 ml, while in the US, 1 customary cup is about 237 ml. This slight difference matters when converting larger quantities like 685 ml. For UK bakers, 685 ml converts to about 2.74 metric cups (685 ÷ 250), while US measurements give roughly 2.89 cups (685 ÷ 237). Always check which cup measurement your recipe uses for best results.</p>  

<h3>Why Buttermilk Measurements Matter in Air Frying</h3>  
<p>When using your air fryer, precise liquid measurements like 685 ml of buttermilk ensure even cooking and perfect texture. Too much liquid can make coatings soggy, while too little might dry out your dish. Many <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> rely on buttermilk for its tenderising properties, especially for fried chicken or onion rings.</p>  

<h2>Converting 685 ml of Buttermilk for Baking</h2>  
<p>Baking requires precision, and 685 ml of buttermilk is a common quantity in larger recipes. If you're making a big batch of scones or a layered cake, knowing this conversion saves time and ensures consistency. For UK bakers using metric cups, 685 ml is just under 2¾ cups, while US bakers will use nearly 3 cups.</p>  
<p>Remember that buttermilk's thickness means it should be measured in a liquid measuring cup for accuracy. The <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> on our site includes common liquid measurements to help with all your cooking needs. This is particularly handy when adapting traditional oven recipes for your air fryer.</p>  

<h3>Measuring Without a Cup</h3>  
<p>If you don't have measuring cups, you can still measure 685 ml of buttermilk using a kitchen scale. Since buttermilk weighs about 1.03 grams per ml, 685 ml would be roughly 705 grams. This method is especially useful for <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>cake recipes</a> where precision matters most.</p>  

<h2>US vs UK Cup Measurements for 685 ml</h2>  
<p>The difference between US and UK cup measurements might seem small, but it adds up with larger quantities like 685 ml of buttermilk. In the US system, you'd use about 2.89 cups, while UK measurements require approximately 2.42 cups. Always check where your recipe originates to avoid measurement mishaps.</p>  
<p>This distinction is particularly important when following <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipes</a> for your air fryer, as buttermilk brines often specify exact measurements. Whether you're making Southern fried chicken or buttermilk-marinated wings, getting the 685 ml conversion right ensures juicy, flavourful results.</p>  

<h3>Substitutes for 685 ml Buttermilk</h3>  
<p>If you're out of buttermilk, you can make a substitute for 685 ml by mixing 650 ml milk with 35 ml lemon juice or vinegar. Let it sit for 5 minutes before using. This works well in most <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>air fryer recipes</a> calling for buttermilk, though the flavour will be slightly different.</p>

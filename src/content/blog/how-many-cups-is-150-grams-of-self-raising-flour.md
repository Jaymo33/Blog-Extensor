<p>150 grams of self-raising flour equals approximately 1.2 UK cups or 1.25 US cups. This conversion is essential for air fryer baking, where precise measurements can make or break your recipe. Whether you're making fluffy scones or light cakes in your air fryer, getting the flour ratio right ensures consistent results every time. Visit <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> for more handy measurement guides and recipes tailored for your appliance.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Flour Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Baking</h2>
<p>Air fryers circulate hot air rapidly, which means baking recipes need perfect ratios to avoid dryness or uneven cooking. Self-raising flour already contains baking powder, so measuring 150 grams correctly ensures the right rise and texture. Too much flour can make cakes dense, while too little may cause them to collapse. For foolproof air fryer cakes, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer cake recipes</a> using precisely converted measurements.</p>
<p>British and American cup sizes differ slightly, which is why 150 grams of self-raising flour converts to 1.2 UK cups versus 1.25 US cups. If your recipe originates from another country, always verify which cup measurement it uses. A kitchen scale is the most reliable tool, but when you’re in a pinch, our conversions save the day.</p>

<h2>Converting 150g Self-Raising Flour to Cups</h2>
<p>For UK bakers, 150 grams of self-raising flour is roughly 1.2 cups when lightly spooned into the measuring cup and levelled off. In the US, the same weight fills about 1.25 cups due to the slightly larger cup size. Scooping flour directly from the bag can compact it, leading to inaccuracies—always fluff the flour first with a fork for consistency.</p>
<p>If you’re adapting a traditional recipe for the air fryer, remember that cooking times may differ. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> helps adjust oven recipes seamlessly. Self-raising flour’s leavening agents react faster in an air fryer’s intense heat, so precise measurements prevent over-rising or uneven browning.</p>

<h3>Tips for Measuring Without Scales</h3>
<p>No scales? Use the spoon-and-level method: gently spoon flour into your cup until heaped, then level it with a knife. Avoid tapping the cup, as this compacts the flour. For 150 grams of self-raising flour, you’ll need just over 1 UK cup or a rounded 1 US cup. Keep our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>cake category</a> bookmarked for recipes tested with these measurements.</p>

<h2>Common Mistakes When Measuring Flour</h2>
<p>Packing flour into the cup is the top mistake—it can add up to 20% extra flour, throwing off your air fryer baking. Sifting self-raising flour before measuring ensures even distribution of baking powder, crucial for consistent rise. Always use dry measuring cups for flour; liquid cups have different volumes.</p>
<p>Humidity can also affect flour density. On damp days, 150 grams might take slightly less volume. For flawless air fryer scones or muffins, store flour in an airtight container and measure just before use. Need cleaning tips for post-baking? Our guide to <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner</a> keeps your appliance spotless.</p>

<h3>Recipes Using 150g Self-Raising Flour</h3>
<p>This quantity is perfect for small-batch bakes like 6 air fryer cupcakes or a single-layer sponge. Try our vanilla fairy cakes or lemon drizzle loaf—both use exactly 150 grams of self-raising flour for foolproof results. The air fryer’s rapid heat gives these treats a golden crust while keeping the inside tender.</p>

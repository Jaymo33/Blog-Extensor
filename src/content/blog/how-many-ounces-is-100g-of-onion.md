<p>100g of onion equals approximately 3.53 ounces. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements can make all the difference. Whether you're preparing a delicious stir-fry or a crispy onion topping, knowing the exact weight ensures consistent results.

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>
<p>Air fryers rely on even cooking, and incorrect ingredient quantities can lead to uneven results. Using 100g of onion instead of the required ounces might throw off your recipe. This is especially important for dishes like onion rings or caramelised onions, where texture is key. Always measure your ingredients carefully to achieve the best outcome. Explore more <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> for inspiration.</p>

<p>Many UK recipes use grams, while others prefer ounces, so knowing how to convert between the two is handy. A digital kitchen scale is a great investment for air fryer enthusiasts. It ensures you can switch between measurements effortlessly. For more tips on air fryer cooking, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable recipes</a> section.</p>

<h3>How to measure 100g of onion without a scale</h3>
<p>If you don't have a scale, you can estimate 100g of onion by volume. One medium-sized onion typically weighs around 100g, but sizes vary. Chopped, this equals roughly one cup, but for accuracy, a scale is best. For more precise air fryer cooking, we recommend using proper measuring tools.

<h2>Common uses for 100g of onion in air fryer recipes</h2>
<p>100g of onion is perfect for many air fryer dishes. It's enough for a serving of crispy onion rings or to flavour a batch of air-fried vegetables. This quantity also works well for fajitas or stir-fries cooked in the air fryer. The key is ensuring even distribution for consistent cooking. Discover more <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>onion-based recipes</a> to try.</p>

<p>When preparing multiple servings, simply scale up the 100g measurement accordingly. Remember that onion cooks down in the air fryer, so the raw weight will decrease. This is important when following recipes that specify cooked quantities. For cleaning tips after cooking onion-heavy dishes, see our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner</a> guide.</p>

<h3>Converting other onion quantities</h3>
<p>The same conversion ratio applies whether you're working with 50g or 200g of onion. Simply multiply or divide the 3.53 ounces figure accordingly. This flexibility makes adapting recipes between measurement systems straightforward. Always double-check your conversions for the best air fryer results.</p>

<p>135 ml of condensed milk is approximately 0.57 cups. This conversion is essential for baking and air fryer recipes where precise measurements matter. Whether you're making a creamy dessert or a rich sauce, knowing how to convert millilitres to cups ensures your dish turns out perfectly every time.</p>

<h2>Understanding Condensed Milk Measurements</h2>  
<p>Condensed milk is a thick, sweetened dairy product often used in desserts and baking. Measuring it accurately can be tricky due to its sticky consistency. If you're using an air fryer for recipes like caramel flan or fudge, knowing that 135 ml of condensed milk equals roughly 0.57 cups helps avoid mishaps. For more air fryer-friendly dessert ideas, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipes section</a>.</p>  

<p>Different countries use varying cup sizes, so it's important to clarify which standard you're using. In the UK and most of the world, 1 metric cup equals 250 ml. In the US, 1 cup is 240 ml. For 135 ml of condensed milk, the slight difference between metric and US cups is negligible, but it's good practice to confirm your recipe's origin.</p>  

<h3>Why Accuracy Matters in Air Fryer Recipes</h3>  
<p>Air fryers cook food quickly and evenly, but incorrect measurements can lead to overly sweet or runny results. Since condensed milk is a key ingredient in many air fryer desserts, like cheesecakes or sticky toffee puddings, precision ensures the right texture. If you're new to air fryer baking, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a> can help with other common measurements.</p>  

<h2>How to Measure 135 ml of Condensed Milk</h2>  
<p>Using a liquid measuring cup is the easiest way to measure 135 ml of condensed milk. To avoid sticking, lightly grease the cup with oil or rinse it with warm water before pouring. For smaller quantities, a kitchen scale can also be handyâ€”135 ml weighs about 160 grams. If you're scaling up a recipe, remember that 270 ml would be roughly 1.14 cups.</p>  

<p>For those who prefer visual cues, 135 ml of condensed milk fills just over half a standard metric cup. If you don't have measuring tools, a tablespoon holds about 15 ml, meaning 135 ml is equivalent to 9 tablespoons. This method works in a pinch but isn't as precise for delicate recipes.</p>  

<h3>Common Recipes Using 135 ml of Condensed Milk</h3>  
<p>Many air fryer desserts call for condensed milk, including banoffee pie, tres leches cake, and coconut macaroons. If you're exploring sweet treats, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert category</a> has plenty of inspiration. Since condensed milk adds richness, it's also great for no-churn ice cream bases or as a drizzle over air-fried fruit.</p>  

<h2>Converting Other Condensed Milk Quantities</h2>  
<p>If your recipe calls for a different amount, here's a quick reference: 70 ml is roughly 0.3 cups, 200 ml is about 0.85 cups, and 400 ml equals 1.7 cups. Keeping these conversions in mind saves time and reduces errors. For more measurement tips, visit <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>.</p>  

<p>When adjusting recipes, remember that condensed milk is sweeter and thicker than regular milk. Substituting it requires careful balancing of other liquids and sugars. If you're experimenting, start with small batches and note any changes needed for next time.</p>  

<h3>Cleaning Up Sticky Condensed Milk Residue</h3>  
<p>Condensed milk can leave a sticky mess on utensils and air fryer baskets. To clean efficiently, soak tools in warm, soapy water before scrubbing. For your air fryer, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning guide</a> offers step-by-step advice to maintain its performance.</p>

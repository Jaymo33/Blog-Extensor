<p>2 cups of almonds weigh approximately 10 ounces (283 grams). This measurement is essential for air fryer recipes, ensuring perfect texture and consistency every time. Whether you're making almond-crusted chicken or a batch of roasted almonds, knowing the exact weight helps avoid over or undercooking.

<h2>Why accurate almond measurements matter</h2>  
<p>Using the correct weight of almonds ensures even cooking in your air fryer. Too many almonds can overcrowd the basket, leading to uneven roasting, while too few may burn quickly. Almonds are a versatile ingredient, whether you're adding them to <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>desserts</a> or using them as a crunchy coating. Measuring by weight (ounces) is more precise than volume (cups) because almond sizes vary. This is especially important for recipes like almond flour or candied almonds.</p>  

<p>For example, if a recipe calls for 10 ounces of almonds but you use 2 loosely packed cups, you might end up with less than needed. This can affect the texture and flavour of your dish. Always use a kitchen scale for the best results, especially when preparing <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> where precision matters.</p>  

<h3>How to measure almonds without a scale</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a kitchen scale, you can still measure 2 cups of almonds accurately. Use the spoon-and-level method: gently spoon almonds into a measuring cup and level off the top. Avoid packing them down, as this can lead to an incorrect measurement. For chopped almonds, 2 cups will weigh slightly less—around 8 ounces—due to air gaps. Keep this in mind when adapting recipes for your air fryer.</p>  

<h2>Converting cups to ounces for other nuts</h2>  
<p>Different nuts have varying weights per cup due to their size and density. For instance, 2 cups of walnuts weigh about 8 ounces, while 2 cups of pecans weigh roughly 7 ounces. This is useful when substituting nuts in <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/breakfast>breakfast</a> granola or trail mixes. Always check a reliable conversion chart if you're swapping almonds for another nut in your air fryer recipes.</p>  

<p>Almonds are denser than many nuts, which is why 2 cups weigh more than other varieties. If you're unsure, err on the side of slightly less to avoid overfilling your air fryer basket.

<h3>Common almond recipes for the air fryer</h3>  
<p>Almonds are a staple in many air fryer dishes, from savoury coatings to sweet snacks. Try making honey-roasted almonds by tossing 10 ounces (2 cups) of almonds with honey and a pinch of salt, then air frying at 160°C for 8–10 minutes. For a crunchy topping, chop your measured almonds and use them to coat fish or chicken before air frying. The possibilities are endless with precise measurements!</p>

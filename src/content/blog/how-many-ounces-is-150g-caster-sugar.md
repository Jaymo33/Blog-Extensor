<p>150g of caster sugar equals approximately 5.29 ounces. This precise conversion is essential when adapting recipes for your air fryer, where accurate measurements can make all the difference to your baking results. Whether you're whipping up cakes, cookies or desserts in your air fryer, knowing how to convert 150g caster sugar to ounces ensures perfect sweetness every time.</p>

<h2>Why accurate sugar measurements matter in air fryer baking</h2>
<p>When using your air fryer for baking, precise measurements are crucial because the compact cooking environment reacts differently to ingredients than conventional ovens. Getting your 150g caster sugar to ounces conversion right affects texture, browning and overall success of your treats. Too much sugar can cause over-browning, while too little might leave your bakes lacking in sweetness and structure.</p>
<p>At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we've found that most UK bakers prefer weighing ingredients, but some recipes (especially American ones) use volume measurements. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> makes switching between grams and ounces simple, so you can confidently adapt any recipe for your appliance.</p>

<h2>How to measure 150g caster sugar without scales</h2>
<p>If you don't have digital scales handy, you can still measure out 150g of caster sugar (approximately 5.29 ounces) using simple household items. One UK tablespoon holds about 12.5g of caster sugar, so 150g would be roughly 12 level tablespoons. However, for best results in your air fryer recipes, we recommend investing in a set of kitchen scales.</p>
<p>When measuring by volume, remember that caster sugar settles differently than granulated sugar. Fluff it up with a fork before spooning it into your measuring cup to get the most accurate 150g caster sugar to oz conversion. This technique is particularly important for delicate <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>air fryer cakes</a> where texture is everything.</p>

<h3>The science behind sugar measurements</h3>
<p>Caster sugar's finer crystals mean it packs more densely than regular granulated sugar. This is why 150g of caster sugar takes up slightly less volume than the same weight of granulated. When converting 150 grams of caster sugar to ounces UK bakers should note this difference, especially when substituting sugar types in recipes.</p>

<h2>Converting other common sugar amounts</h2>
<p>Once you've mastered the 150g caster sugar to ounces conversion, you might find these other common measurements helpful for air fryer baking: 100g = 3.53 oz, 200g = 7.05 oz, and 250g = 8.82 oz.

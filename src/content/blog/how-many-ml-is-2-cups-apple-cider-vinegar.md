<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of apple cider vinegar can make or break a dish. Too little, and your marinade lacks punch; too much, and it overpowers other flavours. Air fryers circulate hot air, so liquids evaporate faster than in conventional ovens. This means precise measurements, like 473 ml for 2.0 cups of apple cider vinegar, are crucial.

If you're scaling a recipe up or down, this conversion ensures consistency. For example, halving a recipe would mean using 236.5 ml instead of 2.0 cups. Precision is key for air fryer success.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure Apple Cider Vinegar Correctly</h3>

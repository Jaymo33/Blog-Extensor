<p>60 ml of lime juice equals approximately 0.25 cups (or 1/4 cup). This conversion is essential for precise baking and cooking, especially when using an air fryer where measurements can make or break a dish. Whether you're preparing a citrusy glaze or a tangy marinade, knowing how to convert millilitres to cups ensures your recipes turn out perfectly every time. For more air fryer measurement tips, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Lime Juice Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of lime juice is crucial for balancing flavours in dishes like ceviche, dressings, or air-fried chicken wings. Too little, and your dish may lack zest; too much, and it can become overpoweringly sour. Air fryer recipes, in particular, rely on precise liquid measurements to avoid soggy or unevenly cooked results. If you're experimenting with citrus-based marinades, accuracy ensures your food crisps up beautifully. For more recipe ideas, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes collection</a>.</p>  

<p>Lime juice also plays a key role in tenderising meats and enhancing freshness in seafood dishes. When converting 60 ml of lime juice to cups, remember that slight variations can affect texture and taste. A 1/4 cup measurement is standard, but using a kitchen scale for ml-to-cup conversions adds extra precision. This is especially helpful for air fryer cooking, where consistency is key.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure 60 ml of Lime Juice Without a Measuring Cup</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a measuring cup handy, you can use tablespoons to approximate 60 ml of lime juice. Since 1 tablespoon equals 15 ml, four tablespoons will give you the equivalent of 60 ml (or 1/4 cup). For smaller quantities, a teaspoon holds 5 ml, so 12 teaspoons also equal 60 ml. This method works well for quick adjustments in air fryer recipes, such as adding a citrus kick to <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>air-fried chicken</a>.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for 60 ml of Lime Juice in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>From marinades to glazes, 60 ml of lime juice is a versatile ingredient in air fryer recipes. It’s the perfect amount for coating a batch of shrimp or creating a zesty drizzle for tacos. The acidity helps break down proteins, making meats juicier and more flavourful when air-fried. For inspiration, try our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/shrimp>air-fryer shrimp recipes</a>, where lime juice adds a refreshing tang.</p>  

<p>Lime juice also works wonders in vegetarian dishes, such as air-fried tofu or roasted vegetables. A 60 ml (1/4 cup) measurement blends seamlessly with spices and oils for a balanced marinade. If you're cleaning your air fryer after cooking with citrus, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner guide</a> has handy tips to remove sticky residues.</p>  

<h3>Converting 60 ml of Lime Juice in UK vs. US Measurements</h3>  
<p>While 60 ml of lime juice equals 0.25 cups in both UK and US measurements, cup sizes can vary slightly in other contexts. For air fryer recipes, sticking to metric measurements (ml) ensures consistency across regions. If a recipe calls for 60 ml of lime juice, you can confidently use 1/4 cup without worrying about regional differences.</p>

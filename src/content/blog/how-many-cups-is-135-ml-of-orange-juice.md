<p>135 ml of orange juice equals approximately 0.57 cups. This conversion is handy when following recipes that use cup measurements instead of millilitres. Whether you're baking a cake or preparing a marinade, knowing this conversion ensures your dish turns out perfectly every time.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>When cooking or baking, precision is key. Using the correct amount of orange juice can affect the texture, flavour, and moisture of your dish.

<h2>How to Measure 135 ml of Orange Juice</h2>  
<p>If you don’t have a measuring jug with millilitre markings, you can still measure 135 ml of orange juice accurately. One standard metric cup holds 250 ml, so 135 ml is just over half a cup. Alternatively, use a tablespoon—15 ml equals one tablespoon, so 135 ml is roughly 9 tablespoons.</p>  
<p>For recipes requiring exact measurements, like those on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, using a digital kitchen scale can help. Weighing liquids ensures consistency, especially when scaling recipes up or down.</p>  

<h3>UK vs. US Cup Measurements</h3>  
<p>It’s worth noting that UK and US cup measurements differ slightly. A UK cup is 284 ml, while a US cup is 240 ml. For 135 ml of orange juice, this means approximately 0.57 US cups or 0.48 UK cups. Always check which measurement system your recipe uses to avoid discrepancies.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for 135 ml of Orange Juice</h2>  
<p>Orange juice is a versatile ingredient in both sweet and savoury dishes. From glazes to marinades, 135 ml can add a tangy sweetness to your cooking. Try it in an air fryer orange chicken recipe or as a base for a citrusy dessert sauce.</p>

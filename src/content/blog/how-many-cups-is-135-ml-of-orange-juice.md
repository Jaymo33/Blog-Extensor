<p>135 ml of orange juice equals approximately 0.57 cups. This conversion is handy when following recipes that use cup measurements instead of millilitres. Whether you're baking a cake or preparing a marinade, knowing this conversion ensures your dish turns out perfectly every time.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>When cooking or baking, precision is key. Using the correct amount of orange juice can affect the texture, flavour, and moisture of your dish. Too much liquid can make a cake soggy, while too little might leave it dry. That’s why converting 135 ml of orange juice to cups accurately is essential.</p>  
<p>For air fryer recipes, where ingredients are often measured precisely, getting the right amount of liquid ensures even cooking. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more handy measurement conversions to simplify your cooking process.</p>  

<h2>How to Measure 135 ml of Orange Juice</h2>  
<p>If you don’t have a measuring jug with millilitre markings, you can still measure 135 ml of orange juice accurately. One standard metric cup holds 250 ml, so 135 ml is just over half a cup. Alternatively, use a tablespoon—15 ml equals one tablespoon, so 135 ml is roughly 9 tablespoons.</p>  
<p>For recipes requiring exact measurements, like those on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, using a digital kitchen scale can help. Weighing liquids ensures consistency, especially when scaling recipes up or down.</p>  

<h3>UK vs. US Cup Measurements</h3>  
<p>It’s worth noting that UK and US cup measurements differ slightly. A UK cup is 284 ml, while a US cup is 240 ml. For 135 ml of orange juice, this means approximately 0.57 US cups or 0.48 UK cups. Always check which measurement system your recipe uses to avoid discrepancies.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for 135 ml of Orange Juice</h2>  
<p>Orange juice is a versatile ingredient in both sweet and savoury dishes. From glazes to marinades, 135 ml can add a tangy sweetness to your cooking. Try it in an air fryer orange chicken recipe or as a base for a citrusy dessert sauce.</p>  
<p>For more recipe inspiration, browse our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipes</a> or <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert recipes</a> that incorporate orange juice for a fresh twist.</p>  

<h3>Storing Leftover Orange Juice</h3>  
<p>If you have leftover orange juice after measuring 135 ml, store it properly to maintain freshness. Keep it in an airtight container in the fridge for up to three days. For longer storage, freeze it in ice cube trays and use as needed.</p>  

<h2>Tips for Perfect Conversions</h2>  
<p>When converting millilitres to cups, always use the same measuring tools for consistency. A slight variation can impact your recipe. If you’re unsure, double-check with a conversion calculator or refer to our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion guide</a>.</p>  
<p>Keeping your air fryer clean is also crucial for optimal performance. Check out our guide on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>how to clean your air fryer</a> to ensure it stays in top condition for all your cooking adventures.</p>

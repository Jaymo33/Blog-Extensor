<p>0.25 cups of buttermilk equals approximately 59 ml, making it easy to measure for your air fryer recipes. Whether you're baking or cooking, precise measurements ensure perfect results every time. This conversion is useful for both UK and US recipes, so you won't need to second-guess your ingredients.

<h2>Why Accurate Buttermilk Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of buttermilk is crucial for achieving the perfect texture in baked goods like cakes and scones. Too little can leave your batter dry, while too much may make it soggy. Air fryer recipes, such as those for fluffy pancakes or tender fried chicken, rely on precise liquid measurements. If you're exploring new dishes, browse our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> for inspiration.</p>  

<p>Buttermilk adds a tangy flavour and helps activate baking soda, making it a staple in many recipes. Whether you're converting 0.25 cups of buttermilk to ml or scaling up, accuracy ensures consistency.

<h3>UK vs. US Cup Measurements</h3>  
<p>While 0.25 cups of buttermilk equals 59 ml in both UK and US measurements, slight variations can occur due to rounding. Always use a measuring jug for liquids to avoid discrepancies. If you're working with frozen buttermilk, check our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/frozen-foods>frozen foods section</a> for thawing tips.</p>  

<h2>How to Measure Buttermilk Without a Cup</h2>  
<p>If you don't have measuring cups, use a kitchen scale for precision. One ml of buttermilk weighs roughly 1.03 grams, so 59 ml would be about 61 grams. Alternatively, tablespoons can help—0.25 cups is equivalent to 4 tablespoons. For more measurement hacks, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning and usage guides</a>.</p>  

<p>Buttermilk substitutes, like yogurt thinned with milk, can also work in a pinch. However, for best results, stick to the exact 0.25 cups (59 ml) measurement. This ensures your air fryer dishes turn out as intended, whether you're making crispy chicken or moist muffins.</p>  

<h3>Common Recipes Using 0.25 Cups of Buttermilk</h3>  
<p>Many air fryer recipes call for small amounts of buttermilk, such as marinades or batters. For example, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipes</a> often use this measurement for tenderising. If you're scaling a recipe, remember that 0.25 cups of buttermilk in ml is 59 ml—no guesswork needed.</p>

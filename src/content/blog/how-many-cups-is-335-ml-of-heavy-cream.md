<p>335 ml of heavy cream is approximately 1.42 cups in the UK and 1.41 cups in the US. This conversion is essential for precision in baking and cooking, especially when using an air fryer for recipes like custards or sauces. Whether you're following a British or American recipe, knowing the exact measurement ensures perfect results every time.</p>  

<h2>Understanding Heavy Cream Measurements</h2>  
<p>Heavy cream, also known as double cream in the UK, is a staple in many recipes, from desserts to savoury dishes. When converting 335 ml of heavy cream to cups, it's important to note that UK and US cup measurements differ slightly. A UK cup holds 284 ml, while a US cup is 240 ml. This means 335 ml of heavy cream equals roughly 1.42 UK cups or 1.41 US cups.</p>  

<p>For air fryer recipes, precise measurements are crucial. Whether you're making a creamy pasta sauce or a rich dessert, using the correct amount of heavy cream ensures the right texture and flavour. If you're unsure, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more handy measurement tips.</p>  

<h3>Why Accurate Conversions Matter</h3>  
<p>In baking, even small measurement discrepancies can affect the outcome. Too much heavy cream can make a dish overly rich or soggy, while too little might leave it dry. For air fryer cooking, where heat distribution is rapid, precise measurements help achieve consistent results. If you're experimenting with new recipes, always measure carefully.</p>  

<h2>Converting 335 ml of Heavy Cream for Baking</h2>  
<p>When baking, 335 ml of heavy cream is often used in cakes, custards, and frostings. In the UK, this amount translates to just over 1 and 1/3 cups, while in the US, it's slightly less. If your recipe calls for cups but you only have a measuring jug, use the ml marking for accuracy.</p>  

<p>For those who love baking in their air fryer, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer dessert recipes</a> for inspiration. From creamy cheesecakes to fluffy sponges, precise measurements ensure success every time.</p>  

<h3>Tips for Measuring Heavy Cream</h3>  
<p>To measure 335 ml of heavy cream accurately, use a liquid measuring cup with clear markings. Pour slowly to avoid spills and check at eye level. If your recipe requires whipped cream, note that 335 ml of liquid cream yields about 2 cups when whipped.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for 335 ml of Heavy Cream</h2>  
<p>This quantity is perfect for making sauces, soups, or even homemade ice cream in your air fryer. It's also ideal for creamy pasta dishes or indulgent hot chocolates. For savoury ideas, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipes</a> that use heavy cream for rich, flavourful sauces.</p>  

<p>If you're preparing a large batch, remember that 335 ml is just under 1.5 cups in both UK and US measurements. This makes scaling recipes up or down easier without compromising on taste or texture.</p>  

<h3>Storing Leftover Heavy Cream</h3>  
<p>If you don't use all 335 ml at once, store the remainder in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 5 days. Alternatively, freeze it in ice cube trays for later use in sauces or soups. Just give it a good stir after thawing to restore its smooth texture.</p>

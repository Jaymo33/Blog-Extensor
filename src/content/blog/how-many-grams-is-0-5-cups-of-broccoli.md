<p>0.5 cups of broccoli equals approximately 45 grams. This conversion is essential for air fryer cooking, where precision ensures even cooking and perfect texture. Whether you’re following a recipe from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> or improvising, knowing this measurement helps avoid over or under-seasoning.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on hot air circulation, so ingredient quantities directly affect cooking times and results. Using 0.5 cups of broccoli (45 grams) ensures consistent crispiness without overcrowding the basket. For more tips, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> to simplify all your cooking measurements.</p>  
<p>Broccoli’s density can vary slightly based on how it’s chopped, but 45 grams is a reliable average. If you’re preparing a larger batch, like for meal prep, scaling up this measurement keeps everything balanced. Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable recipes</a> for more inspiration.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure 0.5 Cups of Broccoli Correctly</h3>  
<p>For the most accurate 0.5 cups (45 grams), lightly pack chopped broccoli into a measuring cup without pressing down. This mimics the volume-to-gram conversion used in most recipes. If you’re using florets, ensure they’re uniformly sized for even air frying.</p>  

<h2>Converting 0.5 Cups of Broccoli for Different Recipes</h2>  
<p>Whether you’re roasting, stir-frying, or air frying, 0.5 cups of broccoli (45 grams) works across methods. For crispy results, toss the broccoli in a bit of oil before air frying. Find more techniques in our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a>.</p>  
<p>If your recipe calls for metric measurements, this conversion eliminates guesswork. For frozen broccoli, note that 0.5 cups may weigh slightly more due to ice content—thaw and pat dry first.</p>  

<h3>Common Mistakes When Measuring Broccoli</h3>  
<p>Overpacking the cup can skew the gram weight, leading to uneven cooking. Always use a dry measuring cup for solids like broccoli, not a liquid one. For more air fryer tips, visit <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>.</p>  

<h2>Scaling Up: Larger Broccoli Quantities</h2>  
<p>Need 1 cup? Double the 0.5-cup measurement to 90 grams. For meal prep or family servings, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/meal-prep>meal prep guides</a> help streamline the process. Remember, overcrowding the air fryer basket affects crispiness, so cook in batches if needed.</p>  

<h3>Broccoli Nutrition per 0.5 Cups (45 Grams)</h3>  
<p>This portion packs about 15 calories, 3 grams of carbs, and 2 grams of fiber—ideal for healthy air fryer meals. Its versatility makes it a staple in dishes from stir-fries to casseroles.</p>

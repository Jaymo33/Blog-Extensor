<p>475 grams of self-raising flour is approximately 3.8 cups when measured correctly. This conversion is essential for bakers who prefer using cups over scales, especially when following recipes from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>. Whether you're whipping up cakes, muffins, or bread, knowing how to convert grams to cups ensures consistency in your baking.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Baking is a science, and precise measurements are crucial for success. Using too much or too little self-raising flour can affect the texture and rise of your baked goods. For air fryer recipes, where space and heat distribution are key, accuracy is even more important. A slight deviation in flour quantity can lead to dense or unevenly cooked results.</p>  
<p>At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes</a>, you'll find countless recipes that rely on precise measurements. Whether you're making fluffy scones or a light sponge cake, converting 475 grams of self-raising flour to cups correctly ensures your bakes turn out perfectly every time.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure Self-Raising Flour Correctly</h3>  
<p>To measure 475 grams of self-raising flour in cups, use the spoon-and-level method. Avoid scooping directly from the bag, as this compacts the flour and leads to inaccurate measurements. Instead, lightly spoon the flour into a measuring cup and level it off with a knife for the most precise result.</p>  

<h2>Converting Grams to Cups for Different Flours</h2>  
<p>Not all flours weigh the same, so conversions vary. Self-raising flour is lighter than plain flour due to the added raising agents. If you're using a recipe from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart</a>, always check whether it specifies self-raising or plain flour to avoid mistakes.</p>  
<p>For reference, 475 grams of plain flour equals roughly 3.75 cups, while self-raising flour is slightly lighter at 3.8 cups. This small difference can impact your baking, so always double-check your conversions.</p>  

<h3>Common Baking Mistakes to Avoid</h3>  
<p>One of the biggest mistakes bakers make is using the wrong type of flour or measuring inaccurately. Self-raising flour already contains baking powder, so substituting it with plain flour without adjustments will result in flat, dense bakes. Always use the correct flour and measure carefully.</p>  

<h2>Using Self-Raising Flour in Air Fryer Recipes</h2>  
<p>Air fryers are fantastic for baking, but they require precise measurements due to their compact cooking space. Whether you're making air fryer cakes or muffins, converting 475 grams of self-raising flour to cups ensures even cooking and perfect texture.

<p>Remember, air fryers cook faster than conventional ovens, so accurate measurements prevent over- or under-baking. If your recipe calls for 475 grams of self-raising flour, stick to 3.8 cups for the best results.</p>  

<h3>Adjusting Recipes for Altitude and Humidity</h3>  
<p>If you live in a humid climate or at high altitude, you may need to adjust your flour measurements. Humidity can cause flour to compact, while altitude affects rising. In these cases, weighing your flour (475 grams) is more reliable than using cups.</p>

<p>1.5 cups of chopped onion equals approximately 6 ounces (170 grams) in weight. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements can affect cooking times and results. Whether you're making crispy onion rings or adding onions to a stir-fry, knowing the exact weight ensures consistency. For more air fryer conversions, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>

<h2>Why accurate onion measurements matter</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of chopped onion can make or break your air fryer dish. Too little, and you might miss out on flavour; too much, and the onions could steam instead of crisp up. Onions also vary in density depending on how finely they're chopped, so measuring by weight is often more reliable than volume. If you're prepping a batch of <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a>, weighing your ingredients ensures perfect results every time.</p>  

<p>For dishes like onion bhajis or caramelised onions, the 1.5 cups to 6 ounces conversion is a handy rule of thumb. Remember that UK ounces differ slightly from US ounces, so always double-check your scales. If you're working with a recipe from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, rest assured our measurements are tailored for UK kitchens.</p>  

<h3>How to measure chopped onions correctly</h3>  
<p>To get an accurate 1.5 cups measurement, chop your onions uniformly - neither too fine nor too chunky. Pack the onions lightly into your measuring cup without compressing them, as this can affect the weight. For best results in your air fryer, consider investing in digital kitchen scales to measure the 6 ounces directly. This method eliminates guesswork and helps when scaling recipes up or down.</p>  

<h2>Converting other onion measurements</h2>  
<p>While 1.5 cups of chopped onion equals 6 ounces, other amounts follow similar ratios. One cup of chopped onion typically weighs 4 ounces (113g), while half a cup comes in at 2 ounces (57g). These conversions are particularly useful when adapting <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable-based air fryer recipes</a> to suit your taste or portion sizes.</p>  

<p>If your recipe calls for sliced rather than chopped onions, the weight may vary slightly due to different air gaps between pieces. For sliced onions, 1.5 cups might weigh closer to 5.5 ounces (156g). Always adjust cooking times accordingly, as thinner slices will cook faster in your air fryer. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner guide</a> can help with any onion odours afterwards!</p>  

<h3>Tips for cooking onions in your air fryer</h3>  
<p>When using your 1.5 cups (6 ounces) of chopped onion in the air fryer, toss them with a little oil to promote even cooking. Spread them in a single layer for optimal crispness, shaking the basket occasionally. At 180°C, chopped onions typically take 8-10 minutes to become golden and fragrant. For caramelised onions, reduce the temperature to 160°C and cook for 15-20 minutes, stirring occasionally.</p>

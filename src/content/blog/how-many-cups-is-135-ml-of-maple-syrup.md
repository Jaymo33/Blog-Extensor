<p>135 ml of maple syrup equals approximately 0.57 cups (just over half a cup). This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes, ensuring your dishes turn out perfectly sweetened every time. Whether you're making glazes, marinades, or baked goods, knowing this measurement helps avoid guesswork. For more precise conversions, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Frying</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of maple syrup can make or break your air fryer recipes. Too little, and your dish might lack flavour; too much, and it could become overly sticky or caramelised. The air fryer's intense heat means ingredients like maple syrup behave differently than in conventional ovens. That's why converting 135 ml of maple syrup to cups (0.57 cups) ensures consistency. For more recipe ideas, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> collection.</p>  

<p>Maple syrup isn't just for pancakesâ€”it's a versatile ingredient in air fryer cooking. From glazing salmon to sweetening roasted vegetables, precise measurements ensure balanced flavours. If you're new to air frying, start with smaller quantities and adjust as needed. Remember, 135 ml of maple syrup is roughly half a cup plus two tablespoons.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure 135 ml of Maple Syrup Without a Scale</h3>  
<p>If you don't have a measuring jug, use a standard cup to measure 135 ml of maple syrup. Fill the cup halfway, then add two tablespoons to reach 0.57 cups. For sticky ingredients like maple syrup, lightly grease your measuring tools for easy pouring. This trick works for other liquids too, like honey or molasses. Need cleaning tips? Try our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner</a> guide.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for 135 ml of Maple Syrup in Air Fryers</h2>  
<p>This quantity is perfect for glazing proteins like chicken or tofu in the air fryer. A 135 ml (0.57 cups) maple syrup glaze caramelises beautifully under high heat, creating a crispy, sweet coating. You can also mix it with mustard or soy sauce for a balanced marinade. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipes</a> for inspiration.</p>  

<p>For desserts, 135 ml of maple syrup sweetens a batch of air-fried apple slices or pear halves. Drizzle it over nuts or popcorn for a quick snack. Since air fryers circulate hot air, the syrup distributes evenly, avoiding clumping. Adjust cooking times slightly when using syrupy ingredients to prevent burning.</p>  

<h3>Converting 135 ml of Maple Syrup for UK and US Recipes</h3>  
<p>In the UK, 135 ml of maple syrup is roughly 0.57 cups, while US cups are slightly different (0.57 UK cups equals 0.54 US cups). For most recipes, this small difference won't matter, but for precision baking, stick to one measurement system. If a recipe calls for 135 ml of maple syrup, measure it directly rather than converting for accuracy.</p>

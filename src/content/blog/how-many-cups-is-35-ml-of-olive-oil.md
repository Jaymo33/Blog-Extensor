<p>35 ml of olive oil is approximately 0.148 cups (or just under 1/7 of a cup). This conversion is essential for precise cooking and baking, especially when using an air fryer where exact measurements can impact texture and crispiness. Whether you're whipping up a quick snack or a full meal, knowing how to convert millilitres to cups ensures your dishes turn out perfectly every time.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Olive Oil Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of olive oil in your air fryer recipes can make all the difference. Too little, and your food might stick or dry out; too much, and it could become greasy. For example, when making crispy potatoes or roasting vegetables, 35 ml of olive oil (or 0.148 cups) provides just enough coating without excess oil pooling at the bottom of the basket. If you're unsure about other conversions, <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>our air fryer conversion chart</a> is a handy reference.</p>  

<p>Many air fryer recipes, like those for chicken or tofu, call for precise oil measurements to achieve the ideal balance of crispiness and tenderness. For instance, marinating chicken with 35 ml of olive oil ensures even browning without overpowering the seasoning. If you're exploring new dishes, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a> for inspiration.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure 35 ml of Olive Oil Without a Scale</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a measuring jug with millilitre markings, you can use standard kitchen tools to measure 35 ml of olive oil. A tablespoon holds about 15 ml, so 2 tablespoons plus 1 teaspoon will give you roughly 35 ml. Alternatively, a US liquid measuring cup marked in cups can help—just fill it to just under 1/7 of a cup for the same amount.</p>  

<h2>Converting 35 ml of Olive Oil for Different Recipes</h2>  
<p>Whether you're baking or frying, 35 ml of olive oil (0.148 cups) works well in various dishes. For air-fried desserts like cakes or cookies, this amount ensures moisture without making the batter too dense. If you're preparing a savoury dish, such as roasted vegetables from our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable recipes</a>, this measurement helps achieve even crispiness.</p>  

<p>When reheating frozen foods in the air fryer, a light coating of 35 ml of olive oil prevents sticking while enhancing flavour. For example, frozen chips or shrimp benefit from this precise amount for optimal texture. If you're unsure about cleaning your air fryer after oily recipes, <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>our cleaning guide</a> has you covered.</p>  

<h3>Common Mistakes When Measuring Olive Oil</h3>  
<p>One mistake people make is eyeballing olive oil, which can lead to inconsistent results. For accuracy, always use proper measuring tools. Another error is confusing weight and volume—35 ml of olive oil is a volume measurement, not weight. Stick to liquid measuring cups or spoons for best results.</p>  

<h2>Using 35 ml of Olive Oil in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>In air fryer cooking, 35 ml of olive oil is ideal for coating proteins like chicken or tofu before seasoning. It’s also perfect for tossing vegetables before roasting, ensuring they crisp up nicely. For more recipe ideas, browse our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipes</a> section.</p>  

<p>If you're adapting a traditional oven recipe for the air fryer, you might need less oil—sometimes as little as 35 ml instead of the original amount. The air fryer’s efficient circulation means you can achieve crispiness with minimal oil, making it a healthier option.</p>

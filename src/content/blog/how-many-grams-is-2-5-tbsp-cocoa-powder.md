<h2>Why accurate cocoa powder measurements matter</h2>  
<p>Using the correct amount of cocoa powder is crucial for achieving the right flavour and texture in your air fryer recipes. Too little, and your dessert might lack richness; too much, and it could become bitter or dry. Since air fryers cook food faster than conventional ovens, precise measurements help prevent over or undercooking. If you’re working with UK recipes, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipe collection</a> includes tested measurements for perfect results every time.</p>  

<h3>How to measure cocoa powder correctly</h3>  
<p>For the most accurate conversion of 2.5 tbsp cocoa powder to grams, use a digital kitchen scale. Scoop the cocoa powder lightly into the tablespoon without packing it down, then level it off with a knife. This ensures you’re not adding extra weight, which could throw off your recipe. If you don’t have scales, remember that 1 tbsp of cocoa powder is roughly 6 grams, making 2.5 tbsp about 15 grams.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for 2.5 tbsp cocoa powder in air fryer recipes</h2>

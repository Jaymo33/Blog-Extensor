<p>20g of lemon juice equals approximately 0.7 ounces. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements can make all the difference. Whether you’re whipping up a zesty marinade or a tangy glaze, knowing how to convert grams to ounces ensures your dish turns out perfectly. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we’re all about helping you master these small but crucial details.</p>

<h2>Why converting 20g of lemon juice matters</h2>
<p>Accurate measurements are key in cooking, especially when using an air fryer. Too much or too little lemon juice can throw off the balance of flavours in your dish. Converting 20g of lemon juice to ounces (0.7 oz) ensures you get the right acidity and taste every time. This is particularly important for recipes like air-fried chicken or fish, where lemon juice often plays a starring role.</p>
<p>If you’re new to air frying, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for other common measurements. It’s a lifesaver when you’re adapting recipes from grams to ounces or vice versa. Lemon juice is just one example, but the same precision applies to all your ingredients.</p>

<h2>How to measure 20g of lemon juice accurately</h2>
<p>Measuring lemon juice by weight (grams) is more accurate than using volume (millilitres or ounces), as it accounts for density variations. To measure 20g of lemon juice, use a digital kitchen scale for the best results. If you don’t have one, roughly 0.7 ounces (about 1.5 tablespoons) will do the trick for most recipes.</p>
<p>For those who love citrusy dishes, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>lemon chicken recipes</a> are a must-try. They often call for precise amounts of lemon juice to achieve that perfect tang. Remember, fresh lemon juice always tastes better than bottled, so squeeze your own whenever possible.</p>

<h3>Common uses for 20g of lemon juice in air fryer cooking</h3>
<p>20g of lemon juice (0.7 oz) is a versatile amount used in many air fryer recipes. It’s perfect for marinating chicken, adding zest to vegetables, or creating light dressings. The acidity helps tenderise meats while adding a fresh, bright flavour that complements the air fryer’s crisp results.</p>

<h2>Converting other lemon juice amounts</h2>
<p>While we’ve focused on 20g of lemon juice to ounces (0.7 oz), you might need other conversions too. For instance, 10g is about 0.35 ounces, and 50g equals roughly 1.76 ounces. Keep our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a> bookmarked for quick reference during cooking sessions.</p>
<p>If you’re working with larger quantities for meal prep, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/meal-prep>meal prep section</a> for ideas. Many of these recipes use lemon juice as a natural preservative and flavour enhancer, making accurate measurements even more important.</p>

<h3>Tips for working with lemon juice in air fryers</h3>
<p>When using lemon juice in your air fryer, avoid spraying it directly onto hot surfaces to prevent sticking. Instead, mix it with oil or other liquids in your marinade. After cooking, clean your air fryer promptly – lemon juice’s acidity can damage surfaces if left too long. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning guide</a> has all the tips you need.</p>

<h3>How to measure bbq sauce accurately</h3>
<p>To measure 2 cups of bbq sauce in ounces, use a liquid measuring cup for the most accurate results. Pour the sauce slowly to avoid air bubbles, which can throw off your measurement.

The sauce can be used as a glaze, marinade, or dipping sauce, making it incredibly versatile. Always store leftover sauce properly to maintain freshness.</p>

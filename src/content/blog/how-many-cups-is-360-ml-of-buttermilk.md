<p>360 ml of buttermilk is approximately 1.5 cups. This conversion is essential for anyone using an air fryer to bake or cook, as precise measurements can make or break a recipe. Whether you’re whipping up fluffy pancakes or a moist cake, knowing how to convert 360 ml of buttermilk to cups ensures consistency and delicious results every time.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>When using an air fryer, precision is key to achieving the perfect texture and flavour. Too much or too little buttermilk can affect the moisture and rise of your baked goods. For example, if you’re making air fryer scones or muffins, 360 ml of buttermilk (1.5 cups) provides the ideal balance of acidity and liquid for a tender crumb. Always measure carefully to avoid disappointing results.</p>  

<p>If you’re unsure about other conversions, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> is a handy resource. It covers everything from grams to cups, making it easier to follow recipes without guesswork. Whether you’re in the UK or the USA, these conversions are universally helpful for air fryer enthusiasts.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure 360 ml of Buttermilk Without a Measuring Cup</h3>  
<p>Don’t have a measuring cup? No problem! You can use a standard metric measuring jug to measure 360 ml of buttermilk. Alternatively, 360 ml is roughly equivalent to 12 fluid ounces, which can be measured using a liquid ounce marker. For baking, accuracy is crucial, so if you’re in doubt, invest in a good set of measuring tools.</p>  

<h2>Converting 360 ml of Buttermilk for Different Recipes</h2>  
<p>Whether you’re making air fryer fried chicken or a buttermilk cake, 360 ml of buttermilk (1.5 cups) is a common measurement. For fried chicken, this amount is perfect for marinating, while in baking, it ensures a light and fluffy texture. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipes section</a> for more inspiration on using buttermilk in your air fryer.</p>  

<p>If you’re scaling a recipe up or down, remember that 360 ml of buttermilk equals 1.5 cups. This makes it easy to adjust quantities without compromising on taste or texture. For example, halving a recipe would require 180 ml (0.75 cups) of buttermilk, while doubling would need 720 ml (3 cups).</p>  

<h3>Common Mistakes When Measuring Buttermilk</h3>  
<p>One of the biggest mistakes is using a dry measuring cup for liquids like buttermilk. Always use a liquid measuring cup for accuracy. Another error is not levelling off the measurement, which can lead to using more or less than 360 ml. For best results, pour buttermilk into the cup at eye level to ensure it’s exactly 1.5 cups.</p>  

<h2>Buttermilk Substitutes for Air Fryer Recipes</h2>  
<p>If you’re out of buttermilk, you can make a substitute by adding 1 tablespoon of lemon juice or vinegar to 360 ml (1.5 cups) of regular milk. Let it sit for 5 minutes to thicken. This works well in most air fryer recipes, from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>cakes</a> to marinades. However, for the best flavour, real buttermilk is always preferable.</p>  

<p>Another substitute is plain yoghurt thinned with a bit of water to match the consistency of buttermilk. Use 360 ml (1.5 cups) of this mixture as a 1:1 replacement. While these substitutes work in a pinch, they may slightly alter the taste and texture of your dish.</p>  

<h3>Cleaning Your Air Fryer After Using Buttermilk</h3>  
<p>Buttermilk can leave residues that are tricky to clean. After cooking, wipe down your air fryer basket with warm, soapy water or use a specialised <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner</a> to prevent lingering odours. Regular maintenance ensures your air fryer stays in top condition for all your culinary adventures.</p>

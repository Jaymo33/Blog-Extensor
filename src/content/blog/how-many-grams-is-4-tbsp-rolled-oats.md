<p>4 tablespoons (tbsp) of rolled oats weigh approximately 30 grams (g). This conversion is essential for precise cooking, especially when using an air fryer, where ingredient ratios can affect texture and cooking times.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter for air fryer recipes</h2>  
<p>When using an air fryer, consistency is key. Whether you're making granola, oat bars, or coating chicken, the right amount of rolled oats ensures even cooking and perfect results. Too little, and your dish might lack texture; too much, and it could dry out. That’s why converting 4 tbsp rolled oats to grams is so useful. For more air fryer measurement tips, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>  

<p>Rolled oats are a staple in many recipes, from breakfast bowls to crunchy toppings. Knowing that 4 tbsp equals roughly 30 grams helps streamline meal prep. If you're experimenting with new dishes, precise measurements prevent waste and guarantee delicious outcomes every time. Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> for inspiration.</p>  

<h3>How to measure rolled oats correctly</h3>  
<p>For the most accurate conversion of 4 tbsp rolled oats to grams, use a kitchen scale. Scoop the oats lightly into the tablespoon without packing them down. Level off the excess with a knife for consistency. If you don’t have a scale, remember that 1 tbsp of rolled oats is about 7.5 grams, so 4 tbsp totals 30 grams.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for 4 tbsp rolled oats in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Rolled oats add crunch and nutrition to air-fried dishes. A 30-gram portion (4 tbsp) works perfectly for coating chicken tenders, making granola clusters, or blending into energy bites. Their mild flavour and texture make them versatile for both sweet and savoury recipes. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/breakfast>breakfast recipe category</a> for oat-based ideas.</p>  

<p>Another great use for 4 tbsp rolled oats is in homemade air-fryer granola. Mix 30 grams of oats with honey, nuts, and a pinch of cinnamon for a quick, healthy snack. The air fryer crisps them up in minutes, giving you a delicious result without the need for oven baking.

<h3>Adjusting recipes for different oat types</h3>  
<p>If you’re using jumbo or quick oats instead of standard rolled oats, the weight per tablespoon may vary slightly. Jumbo oats are less dense, so 4 tbsp could weigh closer to 28 grams, while quick oats might be nearer to 32 grams. Always adjust recipes based on the oat type for the best texture.</p>  

<h2>Tips for storing rolled oats</h2>  
<p>To keep your rolled oats fresh, store them in an airtight container in a cool, dry place. Proper storage ensures they retain their flavour and texture, whether you’re using 4 tbsp or a larger batch. For more meal-prep tips, browse our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/meal-prep>meal prep recipes</a>.</p>  

<p>Buying rolled oats in bulk can save money, but always check the weight conversions if recipes call for tablespoons. A 30-gram portion (4 tbsp) is a handy measurement to remember for small-batch cooking in the air fryer. Keep your pantry stocked for quick, healthy meals anytime.</p>

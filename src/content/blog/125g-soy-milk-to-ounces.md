<p>For context, 125g of soy milk is roughly half a US cup or just under a UK metric cup. This measurement is common in smaller-batch recipes, such as single-serve air fryer pancakes or marinades. If your air fryer recipe calls for 125g of soy milk and you only have ounce measurements, now you know it’s 4.41 oz. Precision is especially important when baking in your air fryer, where ratios of wet to dry ingredients can’t be eyeballed.</p>

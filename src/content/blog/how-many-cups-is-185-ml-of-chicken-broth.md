<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Cooking</h2>
<p>Precision in measuring ingredients like chicken broth can make or break a recipe. Too much liquid can lead to soggy dishes, while too little might leave your food dry. For air fryer recipes, where evaporation rates differ from conventional ovens, getting the right amount of chicken broth is especially crucial. A slight miscalculation could affect texture and flavour.</p>

<h2>Converting 185 ml of Chicken Broth to Cups</h2>

For smaller quantities, a tablespoon (15 ml) can help you measure increments accurately. Remember, 185 ml is just over 12 tablespoons, which can be useful for fine-tuning recipes.</p>

<h2>Common Uses for 185 ml of Chicken Broth</h2>

It’s often used to deglaze pans, create sauces, or add moisture to air-fried dishes like chicken or vegetables.

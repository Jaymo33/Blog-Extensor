<p>185 ml of chicken broth equals approximately 0.78 cups. This conversion is handy when following recipes that list ingredients in millilitres but require cup measurements. Whether you're preparing a soup, stew, or an air fryer dish, knowing this conversion ensures accuracy and perfect results every time.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Cooking</h2>
<p>Precision in measuring ingredients like chicken broth can make or break a recipe. Too much liquid can lead to soggy dishes, while too little might leave your food dry. For air fryer recipes, where evaporation rates differ from conventional ovens, getting the right amount of chicken broth is especially crucial. A slight miscalculation could affect texture and flavour.</p>
<p>At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we emphasise the importance of accurate conversions to help you achieve restaurant-quality results at home. Whether you're adapting a family favourite or trying a new dish, knowing how many cups 185 ml of chicken broth equals ensures consistency. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more handy tips.</p>

<h2>Converting 185 ml of Chicken Broth to Cups</h2>
<p>The standard conversion for millilitres to cups is straightforward: 1 cup equals 240 ml. Therefore, 185 ml of chicken broth is roughly 0.78 cups. If you don’t have a measuring cup with millilitre markings, this conversion saves the day. For recipes requiring precise amounts, consider using a digital scale or a liquid measuring jug for accuracy.</p>
<p>When working with air fryers, even small variations in liquid measurements can impact cooking times and outcomes. For example, adding 185 ml of chicken broth to a marinade or sauce requires careful measurement to avoid over-saturation. Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipes</a> section for dishes that use chicken broth perfectly.</p>

<h3>Tools for Measuring Liquid Ingredients</h3>
<p>A good-quality liquid measuring cup is indispensable for converting 185 ml of chicken broth to cups. Look for one with clear markings for both millilitres and cups to simplify the process. For smaller quantities, a tablespoon (15 ml) can help you measure increments accurately. Remember, 185 ml is just over 12 tablespoons, which can be useful for fine-tuning recipes.</p>

<h2>Common Uses for 185 ml of Chicken Broth</h2>
<p>Chicken broth is a versatile ingredient, and 185 ml is a common quantity in many recipes. It’s often used to deglaze pans, create sauces, or add moisture to air-fried dishes like chicken or vegetables. Knowing how many cups 185 ml of chicken broth equals helps you adapt recipes without guesswork.</p>
<p>For example, if a recipe calls for 1 cup of chicken broth but you only have 185 ml, you’ll know you’re slightly short and can adjust accordingly. Visit our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipe category</a> for inspiration on using chicken broth in your air fryer creations.</p>

<h3>Adjusting Recipes for Different Measurements</h3>
<p>If a recipe specifies 185 ml of chicken broth but you prefer using cups, now you know it’s about 0.78 cups. This knowledge is particularly useful when scaling recipes up or down. For instance, doubling a recipe that calls for 185 ml means you’ll need roughly 1.56 cups of chicken broth.</p>

<h2>Tips for Storing and Using Chicken Broth</h2>
<p>Once opened, chicken broth should be stored in the fridge and used within a few days. If you’ve measured out 185 ml for a recipe but have leftovers, freeze them in ice cube trays for future use. Each cube is roughly 30 ml, making it easy to portion out small amounts like 185 ml when needed.</p>

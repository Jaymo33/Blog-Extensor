<h2>Why accurate peanut butter measurements matter</h2>  
<p>Using the correct amount of peanut butter ensures your air fryer recipes have the right texture and flavour. Too much can make dishes greasy, while too little might leave them dry.

Air fryers cook quickly, so even small measurement errors can affect the outcome.</p>  

<p>Peanut butter’s density can vary slightly depending on the brand and whether it’s smooth or crunchy. However, 2.5 tbsp generally converts to 38 grams, making it easy to follow recipes without guesswork. If you’re meal prepping or scaling up a recipe, this conversion ensures consistency across batches.</p>  

<h3>How to measure peanut butter for air fryer recipes</h3>  
<p>For the most accurate results, use a digital kitchen scale to weigh your peanut butter. Scoop 2.5 tbsp onto the scale, and it should read close to 38 grams. If you don’t have a scale, lightly pack the peanut butter into the tablespoon without pressing too hard, as this can add extra weight.</p>

<h3>Tips for working with peanut butter in the air fryer</h3>

<h2>Converting other peanut butter measurements</h2>

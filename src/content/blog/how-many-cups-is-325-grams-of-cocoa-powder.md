This conversion ensures your baking measurements are spot-on, whether you're making brownies, cakes, or air fryer desserts. Precise measurements are key to perfect results, so let's dive deeper into how to get it right every time.</p>  

<h2>Understanding Cocoa Powder Measurements</h2>  
<p>When converting grams to cups, it's important to note that cocoa powder can vary slightly in density. In the UK, 325 grams of cocoa powder typically equals about 2.6 cups, while in the US, it's closer to 2.7 cups. This difference arises due to slight variations in cup sizes between the two regions. For the most accurate results, using a kitchen scale is always best, but if you're relying on cups, our conversion will help.</p>

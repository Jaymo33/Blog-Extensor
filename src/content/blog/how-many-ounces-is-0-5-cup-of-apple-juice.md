<p>0.5 cup of apple juice equals 4 fluid ounces (or approximately 4.17 oz for precise measurements). This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where exact liquid measurements can impact texture and flavour. Whether you’re making a glaze for chicken or a marinade for vegetables, knowing how many ounces are in 0.5 cup of apple juice ensures consistent results. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we focus on helping you master these small but crucial details for perfect cooking every time.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on precise ingredient ratios to achieve crispy, evenly cooked dishes. Using the correct amount of liquid, like 0.5 cup of apple juice, prevents soggy results or overly dry food. For example, a marinade with too much juice can make coatings fall off, while too little might leave meat bland. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> simplifies these calculations, so you never have to guess.</p>  

<p>Many air fryer recipes, especially those for glazes or sauces, call for small quantities like 0.5 cup of apple juice. Converting this to ounces (4 oz) helps if your measuring tools are ounce-based. This is particularly useful for UK cooks using metric scales or fluid ounce measurements. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a> for inspiration on using apple juice in dishes like sticky chicken wings or glazed carrots.</p>  

<h3>How to measure 0.5 cup of apple juice without a measuring cup</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a measuring cup handy, you can use a kitchen scale to weigh 4 ounces of apple juice. Alternatively, 8 tablespoons equal 0.5 cup, which is handy for smaller batches. For more tips on accurate measuring, explore our guide on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>maintaining your air fryer</a> to keep it in top condition for precise cooking.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for 0.5 cup of apple juice in air fryer recipes</h2>  
<p>Apple juice adds sweetness and moisture to air fryer dishes. A 0.5 cup (4 oz) portion is perfect for marinating poultry, glazing roasted vegetables, or creating sticky sauces. Try it in our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipes</a>, where it tenderises meat while adding a subtle fruity note. The natural sugars in apple juice also help caramelise surfaces for that desirable crispy finish.</p>  

<p>For vegetarian options, 0.5 cup of apple juice works wonders in tofu marinades or as a base for dipping sauces. Its mild flavour pairs well with spices like cinnamon or ginger, making it versatile for both savoury and sweet dishes. Browse our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert section</a> for ideas on incorporating apple juice into air-fried treats like fruit crisps or doughnuts.</p>  

<h3>Adjusting recipes when you only have larger quantities of apple juice</h3>  
<p>If your recipe calls for 0.5 cup of apple juice but you’ve opened a larger bottle, don’t worry. Simply measure out 4 ounces and store the rest in the fridge for up to a week. You can also freeze apple juice in ice cube trays for future use—each cube is roughly 1 ounce, making it easy to portion out 0.5 cup equivalents later.</p>

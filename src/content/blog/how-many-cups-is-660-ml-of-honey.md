<p>660 ml of honey is roughly equivalent to 2.8 cups in the UK and 2.79 cups in the US. This conversion is essential for precise baking and cooking, especially when using an air fryer. Whether you're whipping up a glaze or sweetening a marinade, knowing how to convert 660 ml of honey to cups ensures your recipes turn out perfectly every time.</p>

<h2>Understanding Honey Measurements</h2>
<p>Honey is thicker and denser than water, which means its volume-to-weight ratio differs. While 660 ml of water would be easier to measure, honey requires a bit more attention. For accurate results, always use a liquid measuring cup designed for sticky ingredients. This is particularly important for air fryer recipes, where precise measurements can make or break a dish.</p>
<p>If you're working with an air fryer, you might find our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> incredibly useful. It covers various ingredients, including honey, to help you avoid measurement mishaps. Whether you're making honey-glazed chicken or a sweet dessert, getting the measurements right is key.</p>

<h3>UK vs. US Cup Measurements</h3>
<p>In the UK, a standard cup holds 250 ml, while in the US, it's 240 ml. This slight difference means 660 ml of honey converts to 2.8 cups in the UK and 2.79 cups in the US. For most recipes, this minor discrepancy won’t matter, but for precision baking, it’s worth noting. Always check whether your recipe uses UK or US measurements to avoid confusion.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Honey Measurements Matter</h2>
<p>Honey’s viscosity means it can easily throw off a recipe if not measured correctly. Too much honey can make a dish overly sweet or sticky, while too little might leave it lacking flavour. This is especially true for air fryer recipes, where ingredients cook quickly and evenly. For example, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>honey-glazed salmon</a> relies on the perfect balance of sweetness and savoury notes.</p>
<p>If you’re converting 660 ml of honey to cups for a marinade or glaze, consider using a kitchen scale for absolute precision. This ensures your air fryer dishes come out perfectly every time. For more tips on air fryer cooking, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipes</a>, where honey is often a star ingredient.</p>

<h3>Tips for Measuring Honey</h3>
<p>To measure 660 ml of honey accurately, lightly grease your measuring cup with oil or spray. This helps the honey slide out easily, leaving no sticky residue behind. Alternatively, warm the honey slightly to make it less viscous. Just be careful not to overheat it, as this can alter its flavour and properties.</p>

<h2>Common Uses for 660 ml of Honey</h2>
<p>660 ml of honey is a versatile quantity, perfect for batch cooking or meal prep. You might use it to make a large batch of honey mustard dressing, glaze for roasted vegetables, or even a sweet topping for air fryer desserts. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert recipes</a> for inspiration on how to use honey in your air fryer.</p>

<p>0.33 cup of sunflower seeds equals approximately 1.6 ounces (oz) in UK measurements. This conversion is essential for precise cooking, especially when using an air fryer where ingredient ratios can affect texture and crispiness. Whether you’re making a crunchy topping or a healthy snack, knowing the exact weight ensures consistent results every time.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on even heat distribution, so ingredient quantities must be precise. Too many sunflower seeds in a 0.33 cup measurement could overcrowd the basket, leading to uneven cooking. On the other hand, too few might dry out or burn. For perfect air-fried dishes, always measure ingredients like sunflower seeds by weight (ounces) rather than volume (cups) where possible.</p>  

<p>If you’re new to air fryer cooking, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for quick reference. It covers common ingredients, including sunflower seeds, nuts, and grains, so you can swap between cups and ounces effortlessly. This is especially handy when adapting recipes from international sources that use different measurement systems.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure 0.33 Cup of Sunflower Seeds Correctly</h3>  
<p>Use a dry measuring cup for sunflower seeds, filling it loosely without packing them down. Level off the top with a straight edge for accuracy. For smaller quantities like 0.33 cup, a kitchen scale is ideal—simply weigh out 1.6 oz. If you don’t have a scale, remember that 1 UK cup of sunflower seeds weighs roughly 4.8 oz, so 0.33 cup is a third of that.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for Sunflower Seeds in Air Fryer Recipes</h2>  
<p>Sunflower seeds add crunch and nutrition to many air fryer dishes. Sprinkle 0.33 cup (1.6 oz) over roasted vegetables, mix into homemade granola, or use as a coating for chicken or fish. Their high oil content means they toast beautifully in the air fryer, enhancing flavour without added fats.</p>  

<p>For recipe inspiration, browse our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> collection. From seed-crusted salmon to energy bites, you’ll find creative ways to use 0.33 cup of sunflower seeds. Many of these dishes are perfect for meal prep, so you can enjoy healthy snacks all week.</p>  

<h3>Converting Other Sunflower Seed Quantities</h3>  
<p>Need to scale up or down? Here’s a quick reference: 0.25 cup ≈ 1.2 oz, 0.5 cup ≈ 2.4 oz, and 1 cup ≈ 4.8 oz. These conversions apply to hulled sunflower seeds; unhulled seeds weigh slightly more due to their shells. Always adjust cooking times in the air fryer if quantities change significantly.</p>  

<h2>Tips for Storing Sunflower Seeds</h2>  
<p>To keep sunflower seeds fresh, store them in an airtight container in a cool, dark place. If you’ve measured out 0.33 cup (1.6 oz) but don’t use them all, they’ll stay crisp for weeks. For longer storage, freeze them—they’ll retain their quality for up to a year. Just thaw before using in your air fryer.</p>

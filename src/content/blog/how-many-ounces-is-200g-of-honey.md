<h2>Why accurate honey measurements matter</h2>
<p>Honey is a staple in many air fryer recipes, from glazes to marinades. Its thick consistency means even small measurement errors can affect texture and taste. For example, using too much honey in a glaze can make it overly sticky, while too little might leave your dish lacking sweetness. That’s why converting 200g of honey to ounces (7.05 oz) is so important for consistency. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more handy tips.</p>

<p>Many UK recipes use grams, but ounces are still widely used, especially in older cookbooks. If you’re adapting a recipe for your air fryer, getting the conversion right ensures you don’t end up with a soggy or dry result. Whether you’re making honey-glazed chicken or a sweet dessert, precision is key. Visit our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipes section</a> for inspiration.</p>

<h2>How to measure honey accurately</h2>
<p>Measuring honey can be tricky due to its sticky nature. A digital kitchen scale is the most accurate tool for converting 200g of honey to ounces. Simply place your container on the scale, tare it to zero, and pour the honey until you reach 200g (or 7.05 oz). If you don’t have a scale, use a liquid measuring cup, but remember honey’s density means volume measurements aren’t as precise.</p>

<h3>Tips for sticky situations</h3>
<p>To make measuring honey easier, lightly coat your spoon or cup with oil. This prevents the honey from sticking and ensures you get every last drop. For air fryer recipes, this small step can save time and reduce waste. If you’re working with larger quantities, warming the honey slightly can make it easier to pour. Just avoid overheating, as it can alter the flavour.</p>

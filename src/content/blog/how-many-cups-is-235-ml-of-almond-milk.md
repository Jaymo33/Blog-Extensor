<p>235 ml of almond milk is approximately 1 cup (0.99 cups to be precise). This conversion is essential for baking, cooking, or preparing air fryer recipes where precise measurements matter. Whether you're whipping up a cake or a creamy sauce, knowing how to convert millilitres to cups ensures your dish turns out perfectly every time.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of almond milk can make or break your recipe. Too much liquid can lead to soggy results, while too little might dry out your dish. If you're following an air fryer recipe from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, precise measurements ensure even cooking and perfect texture. Almond milk, being a popular dairy-free alternative, is often used in everything from batters to marinades.</p>  

<p>Many air fryer recipes, especially baked goods like muffins or pancakes, rely on exact liquid ratios. A slight variation in almond milk quantity can affect the rise and consistency of your dish. For example, if a recipe calls for 235 ml of almond milk (just under 1 cup), using a full cup might throw off the balance. Always measure carefully for the best results.</p>  

<h3>Converting 235 ml of Almond Milk to Cups</h3>  
<p>In the UK and US, standard cup measurements differ slightly. A UK cup is 250 ml, while a US cup is 240 ml. This means 235 ml of almond milk is roughly 0.94 UK cups or 0.98 US cups—close enough to 1 cup for most recipes. For air fryer cooking, this small difference usually won’t affect the outcome, but for baking, it’s good to be precise.</p>  

<h2>Using Almond Milk in Air Fryer Recipes</h2>  
<p>Almond milk is a versatile ingredient in air fryer cooking. From creamy sauces to light batters, it adds moisture without overpowering flavours. If you're exploring dairy-free options, check out <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert recipes</a> that use almond milk for a lighter texture. Its mild taste works well in both sweet and savoury dishes.</p>  

<p>When substituting almond milk for dairy milk in air fryer recipes, keep in mind that it has a thinner consistency. If a recipe calls for 235 ml of almond milk (about 1 cup), you might need to adjust other liquids slightly. For example, batters may require a touch less liquid to achieve the right thickness. Always test a small batch first.</p>  

<h3>Common Recipes Using 235 ml of Almond Milk</h3>  
<p>Many air fryer recipes use around 235 ml of almond milk. Popular options include dairy-free pancakes, vegan mac and cheese, or creamy soups. If you're looking for inspiration, <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> has a range of dishes that incorporate this measurement. Whether you're meal prepping or cooking for one, almond milk is a handy staple.</p>  

<h2>Tips for Measuring Almond Milk Accurately</h2>  
<p>To measure 235 ml of almond milk correctly, use a liquid measuring cup with clear markings. Pour slowly to avoid spills and check at eye level for accuracy. If you don’t have a measuring cup, a standard UK metric cup (250 ml) filled just below the rim will give you roughly 235 ml. For US cups, fill to just under the 1-cup line.</p>  

<p>If precision is crucial, a kitchen scale can help. Weighing 235 ml of almond milk (which is approximately 245 grams) ensures exact measurements. This is especially useful for baking, where ratios are critical.

<h3>Storing Leftover Almond Milk</h3>  
<p>If your recipe only uses part of a carton, store leftover almond milk in the fridge for up to 5 days. Shake well before reusing, as separation is natural. For longer storage, freeze almond milk in ice cube trays—each cube is roughly 30 ml, so 8 cubes equal about 235 ml. Thaw in the fridge before using in your next air fryer creation.</p>

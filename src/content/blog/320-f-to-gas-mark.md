<p>320°F is equivalent to Gas Mark 3, making it a moderate heat setting ideal for baking and roasting in both air fryers and conventional ovens. This temperature is commonly used for cookies, cakes, and even some savoury dishes, ensuring even cooking without burning. If you're using an air fryer, you might need to adjust cooking times slightly compared to a traditional oven. For more air fryer tips, check out <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>.</p>

<h2>Why Convert 320 F to Gas Mark?</h2>
<p>Many British recipes still use Gas Mark, especially for baking, so knowing the conversion is essential. Gas Mark 3 (320°F) is a versatile temperature for everything from Victoria sponge cakes to roasted vegetables. Air fryers often display temperatures in Fahrenheit or Celsius, so converting to Gas Mark helps when following older recipes. If you're new to air frying, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> simplifies these adjustments. This ensures your dishes turn out perfectly every time.</p>

<p>Gas Mark settings are particularly useful for those who prefer traditional ovens but want to try air frying. The consistency of Gas Mark 3 makes it easy to replicate results across different appliances. Whether you're baking cookies or roasting chicken, this temperature provides a balance between speed and even cooking. For recipe ideas, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>cake category</a>.</p>

<h3>How to Use 320 F in an Air Fryer</h3>
<p>Air fryers cook faster than ovens, so you may need to reduce the time by 10-20% when using Gas Mark 3 equivalents. Preheat your air fryer to 320°F for best results, especially for baked goods. This ensures the heat distributes evenly, mimicking a conventional oven. For cleaning tips, visit <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>our guide</a>.</p>

<h2>Common Dishes Cooked at 320 F / Gas Mark 3</h2>
<p>This temperature is perfect for delicate bakes like shortbread, scones, and muffins. It’s also great for slow-roasting tomatoes or cooking fish fillets without drying them out. Many <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> adapt well to this setting, especially those requiring gentle heat. Experiment with timing to find what works best for your model.</p>

<p>Roasted nuts and homemade granola also benefit from Gas Mark 3, as the lower heat prevents burning. If you're cooking frozen foods like chips or chicken nuggets, check packaging for equivalent temperatures. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/frozen-foods>frozen foods section</a> has tailored advice.</p>

<h3>Tips for Accuracy</h3>
<p>Use an oven thermometer to verify your air fryer’s temperature, as some models run hotter. If converting from fan-assisted ovens, note that Gas Mark 3 remains the same, but cooking times may vary slightly. Always preheat for consistent results.</p>

<p>235 ml of vegetable oil equals approximately 1 cup (or 0.99 cups to be precise). Whether you're using an air fryer or baking, accurate measurements ensure your dishes turn out perfectly every time. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we know how crucial conversions like these are for hassle-free cooking.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Frying</h2>  
<p>Getting the right amount of vegetable oil can make or break your air fryer recipes. Too little, and your food might stick or dry out. Too much, and you risk soggy results. That’s why converting 235 ml of vegetable oil to cups correctly is essential. Many air fryer recipes, like crispy chicken or roasted vegetables, rely on precise oil measurements for the best texture and flavour.</p>

<h2>How to Measure 235 ml of Vegetable Oil Without a Scale</h2>  
<p>Not everyone has a kitchen scale, but most cooks have measuring cups handy. To measure 235 ml of vegetable oil without one, use a standard metric cup. Since 1 cup is roughly 240 ml, 235 ml is just shy of a full cup. For most recipes, this small difference won’t affect the outcome, but for precision, you can fill the cup just below the brim.</p>  
<p>If you're working with American recipes, note that US cups differ slightly (236.59 ml per cup). However, the difference is minimal, so 235 ml of vegetable oil still rounds to about 1 cup.

<h3>Does the Type of Oil Affect the Measurement?</h3>

    "@type": "Answer",

    "@type": "Answer",
    "text": "No, because double cream’s density differs from water. While 30ml of water weighs 30g, 30ml of double cream weighs slightly more due to its fat content. For accuracy, always measure by weight (30g = 1.06 ounces) in air fryer recipes."

<p>30g of double cream is approximately 1.06 ounces. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes, where precise measurements can make or break your dish. Whether you're whipping up a creamy sauce or baking a decadent dessert, knowing how to convert grams to ounces ensures consistency. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we help simplify these conversions so you can focus on cooking. Let’s dive deeper into why this measurement matters and how to use it effectively.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on precise ingredient ratios to achieve the perfect texture and flavour. Too much or too little double cream can alter the moisture content of your dish. For example, a <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>creamy pasta bake</a> requires just the right amount of double cream to avoid sogginess. Measuring 30g of double cream correctly (1.06 ounces) ensures your recipes turn out as intended. This is especially important for UK cooks, where metric measurements are standard but some recipes use imperial units.</p>  

<p>Double cream is a staple in many air fryer recipes, from desserts to savoury dishes. Whether you're making a <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>decadent chocolate mousse</a> or a rich mushroom sauce, the 30g to ounces conversion is handy. If you’re unsure, use a digital scale for accuracy. For more conversions, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>  

<h3>How to measure 30g of double cream without scales</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have scales, you can estimate 30g of double cream using tablespoons. One tablespoon of double cream weighs roughly 15g, so two tablespoons equal 30g (or 1.06 ounces). This method isn’t as precise but works in a pinch. For best results, especially in baking, we recommend investing in a kitchen scale. You’ll find it invaluable for <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>air fryer cakes</a> and other delicate recipes.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for 30g of double cream in air fryer recipes</h2>  
<p>Double cream adds richness to both sweet and savoury dishes. A 30g portion (1.06 ounces) is perfect for enriching scrambled eggs or creating a velvety glaze for scones. In the air fryer, it helps bind ingredients in dishes like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/breakfast>breakfast muffins</a>. The high-fat content also promotes browning, giving your food a delicious golden finish. Remember, 30g of double cream is a small but impactful amount—use it wisely.</p>

Sticky residues from dairy can be tricky, but proper care keeps your appliance in top condition.

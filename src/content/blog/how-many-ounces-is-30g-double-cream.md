<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on precise ingredient ratios to achieve the perfect texture and flavour. Too much or too little double cream can alter the moisture content of your dish. For example, a <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>creamy pasta bake</a> requires just the right amount of double cream to avoid sogginess. Measuring 30g of double cream correctly (1.06 ounces) ensures your recipes turn out as intended. This is especially important for UK cooks, where metric measurements are standard but some recipes use imperial units.</p>  

<p>Double cream is a staple in many air fryer recipes, from desserts to savoury dishes. Whether you're making a <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>decadent chocolate mousse</a> or a rich mushroom sauce, the 30g to ounces conversion is handy.

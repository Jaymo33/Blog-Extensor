<p>860 ml of tomato sauce equals approximately 3.63 cups. This conversion is essential for accurate cooking, especially when preparing air fryer recipes that require precise measurements. Whether you're making pasta sauces, casseroles, or marinades, knowing how to convert millilitres to cups ensures consistent results. For more air fryer measurement tips, visit <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>our conversion chart</a>.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on even heat distribution, so precise ingredient measurements are crucial. Too much or too little tomato sauce can affect texture and cooking times. For example, 860 ml of tomato sauce (3.63 cups) is a common quantity for family-sized recipes. Using the right amount ensures your dish cooks evenly and retains moisture. Explore more <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> to perfect your technique.</p>  

<p>Incorrect measurements can lead to soggy or dry results, especially with sauces. A slight variation in tomato sauce quantity might alter the dish’s consistency. For best results, use a measuring jug or kitchen scales. If you’re scaling a recipe, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion guide</a> simplifies the process.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure 860 ml of Tomato Sauce Without a Scale</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a measuring jug, use standard cups for approximation. One UK metric cup holds 250 ml, so 860 ml is roughly 3.5 cups (since 3 x 250 ml = 750 ml, plus an extra 110 ml). For US cups (240 ml), it’s about 3.63 cups. This method works well for thick sauces like tomato paste. Need more tips?

<h2>Common Recipes Using 860 ml of Tomato Sauce</h2>  
<p>Many air fryer dishes call for 860 ml of tomato sauce, such as lasagna, meatball subs, or stuffed peppers. This quantity balances flavour without overwhelming other ingredients. For a quick dinner, try our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer pasta bake</a>. The sauce coats evenly, ensuring every bite is delicious.</p>  

<p>Tomato sauce is also great for marinating proteins like chicken or tofu. Using 860 ml (3.63 cups) ensures full coverage. For marinade ideas, browse our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipes</a>. Remember, thicker sauces may require slight adjustments—stirring halfway through cooking helps distribute heat.</p>  

<h3>Adjusting Recipes for Different Cup Sizes</h3>  
<p>Recipes may specify US or UK cups, so always check the standard. 860 ml equals 3.63 US cups (240 ml each) or 3.44 UK cups (250 ml each). Small differences matter in baking, but for sauces, slight variations are forgiving.

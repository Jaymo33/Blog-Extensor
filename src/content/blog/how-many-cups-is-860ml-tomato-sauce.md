<h3>How to Measure 860 ml of Tomato Sauce Without a Scale</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a measuring jug, use standard cups for approximation. One UK metric cup holds 250 ml, so 860 ml is roughly 3.5 cups (since 3 x 250 ml = 750 ml, plus an extra 110 ml). For US cups (240 ml), it’s about 3.63 cups. This method works well for thick sauces like tomato paste. Need more tips?

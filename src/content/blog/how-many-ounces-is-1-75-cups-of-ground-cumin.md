<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of ground cumin can make or break a dish, especially in an air fryer where flavours intensify. Too much can overpower, while too little might leave your meal bland. Air fryers circulate hot air, so spices like cumin distribute evenly, enhancing taste. If you’re experimenting with new recipes, precise measurements ensure repeatable success.

<p>Ground cumin is denser than some spices, so volume-to-weight conversions are crucial. A slight miscalculation could throw off your entire dish. For example, 1.75 cups of ground cumin to ounces is 14 oz, but other spices may differ. Always double-check conversions to avoid kitchen mishaps. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion guide</a> simplifies this process.</p>  

<h3>How to measure ground cumin correctly</h3>  
<p>For the most accurate results, use a kitchen scale to weigh 1.75 cups of ground cumin in ounces. Scooping directly from the bag can compress the spice, leading to inconsistent measurements. Instead, spoon the cumin lightly into a measuring cup and level it off. This method ensures you get the correct 14 oz for your recipe.</p>

<h3>Using 5.5 kg Prawns in Pounds for Air Frying</h3>
<p>When working with 5.5 kg prawns converted to pounds, consider how this quantity fits into your air fryer cooking routine. Air fryers excel at cooking seafood quickly while keeping it juicy and flavourful. For 12.125 pounds of prawns, you will likely need to cook in batches to avoid overcrowding the basket. Preheat your air fryer to around 200°C for the best results, and cook for 6-8 minutes until pink and opaque. This method ensures each prawn is perfectly cooked without becoming rubbery.</p>

<h2>Practical Tips for Cooking 5.5 kg Prawns</h2>
<p>Cooking a large quantity like 5.5 kg prawns requires some planning to ensure everything turns out perfectly. Start by thawing frozen prawns completely in the refrigerator to promote even cooking. Pat them dry with paper towels to help achieve a crispy exterior in the air fryer. Season generously with your favourite spices, such as garlic powder, paprika, or a squeeze of lemon. Toss the prawns in a light coating of oil to help the seasoning adhere and promote browning.</p>
<p>Divide the 12.125 pounds into manageable batches that fit comfortably in your air fryer basket. Overcrowding leads to steaming rather than frying, resulting in less crispy prawns. Shake the basket halfway through cooking to ensure all sides are exposed to the hot air. Keep cooked batches warm in a low oven while you finish the rest.

Having these resources on hand saves time and reduces errors when preparing ingredients. Remember that 1 kg is approximately 2.2 pounds, making mental calculations easier for round numbers.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on even cooking, and incorrect measurements can throw off texture and consistency. Double cream, with its high fat content, behaves differently when measured in grams versus ounces. For example, 250g of double cream to ounces (8.82 oz) ensures your recipes aren’t too runny or thick. Many air fryer desserts, like cheesecakes or custards, require this precision.

<p>Using a kitchen scale is the best way to measure 250g of double cream accurately. If you don’t have one, remember that 1 tablespoon of double cream weighs roughly 15g, so 250g would be about 16-17 tablespoons. However, for air fryer recipes, we always recommend weighing ingredients for consistency.

This is particularly useful for UK cooks following American recipes, which often use ounces. If you’re making a creamy pasta sauce or a dessert in your air fryer, this conversion ensures you’re spot-on.</p>

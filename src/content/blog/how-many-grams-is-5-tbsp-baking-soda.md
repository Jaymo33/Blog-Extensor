<p>5 tablespoons of baking soda equals approximately 60 grams. This conversion is essential for precise baking, especially when using an air fryer where measurements can make or break a recipe. Whether you're making fluffy cakes or crispy snacks, knowing the exact weight ensures consistent results every time.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on precise ingredient ratios to achieve the perfect texture and taste. Too much or too little baking soda can affect the rise of baked goods or the crispiness of fried treats. For example, if you're making air fryer cookies from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>our recipe collection</a>, an extra gram of baking soda could make them spread too thin.</p>  

<p>Using a digital scale is the most accurate way to measure baking soda, but if you only have tablespoons handy, our conversion ensures you won’t go wrong.

<h3>How to measure 5 tbsp of baking soda correctly</h3>  
<p>To get an accurate 60 grams, lightly spoon baking soda into the tablespoon without packing it down. Level it off with a straight edge for consistency. If you scoop directly from the container, you might end up with more than 60 grams due to compaction.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for 5 tbsp of baking soda in air fryer recipes</h2>  
<p>Five tablespoons of baking soda (60 grams) is often used in larger batches of baked goods or for cleaning purposes. For instance, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>air fryer cake recipes</a> might call for this amount if you're doubling the recipe. It’s also handy for DIY <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner</a> solutions to keep your appliance spotless.</p>  

<p>Baking soda isn’t just for baking—it helps neutralise odours and can even crisp up fries when sprinkled lightly before air frying. Just remember, precision is key to avoid overdoing it.</p>  

<h3>Converting other baking soda amounts to grams</h3>  
<p>If your recipe calls for a different amount, here’s a quick reference: 1 tbsp of baking soda equals 12 grams. So, 3 tbsp would be 36 grams, and 10 tbsp would be 120 grams. Bookmark <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> for more handy conversion tips and tricks.</p>

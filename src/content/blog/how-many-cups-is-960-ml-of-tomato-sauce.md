<p>960 ml of tomato sauce equals approximately 4 cups. This conversion is essential for anyone cooking or baking, especially when using an air fryer where precise measurements can make or break a dish. Whether you're following a recipe from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes</a> or improvising, knowing this conversion ensures consistency.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter</h2>
<p>Getting the right amount of tomato sauce is crucial for balancing flavours and textures in your dishes. Too much sauce can make a meal soggy, while too little might leave it dry. This is especially important in air fryer cooking, where even distribution affects crispiness. For example, a <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipe</a> might call for a specific amount of sauce to coat evenly.</p>
<p>Using 960 ml of tomato sauce (or 4 cups) ensures your dish turns out as intended. If you're scaling a recipe up or down, this conversion helps maintain proportions. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more handy measurements.</p>

<h2>How to Measure 960 ml of Tomato Sauce</h2>
<p>Measuring liquids like tomato sauce can be tricky, but there are a few foolproof methods. The easiest way is to use a liquid measuring cup marked in millilitres and cups. Pour the sauce slowly to avoid spills and check at eye level for accuracy. If you don’t have a measuring cup, a standard UK cup holds 240 ml, so four of these will give you 960 ml.</p>

<h3>Using Kitchen Scales</h3>
<p>If you prefer precision, weigh your tomato sauce instead. Since 1 ml of tomato sauce weighs roughly 1 gram, 960 ml equals about 960 grams. This method is great for recipes where exactness matters, like baking or making <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>desserts</a> in your air fryer.</p>

<h2>Common Uses for 960 ml of Tomato Sauce</h2>
<p>This quantity is perfect for batch cooking or family-sized meals. You might use it for a large pasta bake, homemade pizza sauce, or a rich curry. In the air fryer, it’s ideal for coating chicken wings or creating a saucy base for <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable dishes</a>.</p>
<p>Tomato sauce is versatile, and 960 ml (4 cups) gives you enough to experiment with flavours. Add herbs, spices, or a splash of balsamic vinegar to customise your sauce. Remember to clean your air fryer after cooking saucy dishes – our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning guide</a> can help.</p>

<h2>Converting Other Tomato Sauce Quantities</h2>
<p>While we’ve focused on 960 ml, you might need to convert smaller or larger amounts. Here’s a quick reference: 240 ml equals 1 cup, 480 ml equals 2 cups, and 1.2 litres equals 5 cups. Keep these conversions handy for all your cooking needs, whether using an air fryer or traditional oven.</p>

<h3>Adjusting Recipes for Different Servings</h3>
<p>If a recipe serves four but you’re cooking for two, halve the tomato sauce quantity (480 ml or 2 cups). Conversely, double it for eight servings (1.92 litres or 8 cups). This flexibility makes the 960 ml to cups conversion even more valuable in meal planning.</p>

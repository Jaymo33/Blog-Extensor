<p>360 ml of apple cider vinegar equals approximately 1.52 cups. This conversion is essential for recipes where precision matters, especially when using an air fryer. Whether you're marinating chicken, baking a cake, or whipping up a salad dressing, knowing the exact measurement ensures perfect results every time.</p>  

<h2>Understanding the Conversion from ml to Cups</h2>  
<p>Converting millilitres to cups can be tricky, but it’s straightforward once you know the ratio. One standard metric cup holds 250 ml, so 360 ml of apple cider vinegar is just over 1.5 cups. This measurement is crucial for air fryer recipes, where liquid quantities can affect cooking times and textures. For example, adding too much apple cider vinegar to a marinade might make your dish overly tangy or alter its consistency.</p>  

<p>If you’re working with US cups, note that 1 US cup is roughly 240 ml. This slight difference means 360 ml of apple cider vinegar would be about 1.5 US cups. Always double-check your recipe’s origin to ensure accuracy. For more conversion tips, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>  

<h3>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h3>  
<p>Air fryers rely on precise ingredient ratios to achieve crispy, evenly cooked results. Too much liquid, like apple cider vinegar, can lead to steaming instead of frying. This is especially important for recipes like air-fried chicken wings or glazed vegetables, where balance is key. Measuring 360 ml of apple cider vinegar correctly ensures your dish turns out as intended.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for 360 ml of Apple Cider Vinegar</h2>  
<p>Apple cider vinegar is a versatile ingredient in both cooking and baking. From marinades to salad dressings, 360 ml (or 1.52 cups) is a common quantity in many recipes. For instance, a tangy BBQ sauce for air-fried ribs might call for this amount. You can also use it to pickle vegetables or add acidity to baked goods like cakes and cookies.</p>  

<p>If you’re exploring new recipes, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a> includes plenty of dishes that incorporate apple cider vinegar. Whether you’re making crispy tofu or a zesty glaze for salmon, accurate measurements make all the difference.</p>  

<h3>Tips for Measuring Apple Cider Vinegar</h3>  
<p>When measuring 360 ml of apple cider vinegar, use a clear liquid measuring cup for accuracy. Pour slowly to avoid spills, and check the measurement at eye level. If your recipe calls for a fraction of a cup, remember that 0.52 cups is roughly half a cup plus a tablespoon. For sticky ingredients like vinegar, lightly greasing the measuring cup can help it pour smoothly.</p>  

<h2>Converting Other Apple Cider Vinegar Quantities</h2>  
<p>Need to convert a different amount of apple cider vinegar? Here’s a quick reference: 180 ml is about 0.76 cups, and 500 ml is roughly 2.11 cups. These conversions are handy for scaling recipes up or down. For example, if you’re meal prepping and need to double a recipe, knowing these equivalents saves time and avoids mistakes.</p>  

<p>For more baking conversions, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>cake recipes</a>, where precise measurements are critical. Whether you’re making a vinegar-based chocolate cake or a tangy glaze, getting the quantities right ensures success.</p>  

<h3>Cleaning Your Air Fryer After Using Vinegar</h3>  
<p>Apple cider vinegar can leave behind strong odours in your air fryer. To keep it fresh, mix equal parts water and vinegar (about 360 ml total) and run the air fryer for 10 minutes. Wipe down the basket and interior with a damp cloth afterward.

<p>0.75 cup of peanut butter equals 6 ounces, making it easy to measure for your air fryer recipes.

Whether you're making peanut butter protein bites or a glaze for meats, 6 ounces of peanut butter will give you consistent results.</p>  

<h3>How to measure peanut butter for air fryer recipes</h3>

    "text": "No, fluid ounces (volume) and ounces by weight differ. Lime juice weighs roughly 1.04 oz per fluid ounce due to its density, so 6 fl oz is about 6.24 oz by weight. For most recipes, the volume measurement (0.75 cup or 6 fl oz) is sufficient unless specified otherwise."

<p>0.75 cup of lime juice equals 6 fluid ounces (fl oz) in UK measurements. Whether you're preparing a zesty marinade or a tangy glaze for your air fryer dishes, knowing this conversion ensures precision. Lime juice is a common ingredient in many recipes, especially those involving seafood, chicken, or vegetables—all of which cook beautifully in an air fryer. If you're following a recipe from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, accurate measurements like this can make all the difference.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate lime juice measurements matter</h2>  
<p>Getting the right amount of lime juice is crucial for balancing flavours in your air fryer recipes. Too little can leave your dish bland, while too much might overpower other ingredients. For example, a marinade for <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>air fryer chicken</a> often relies on the perfect ratio of lime juice to oil and spices. Since lime juice is acidic, it also helps tenderise meat, making it ideal for air frying. If you're unsure about conversions, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> can be a handy reference.</p>  

<p>Lime juice isn’t just for savoury dishes—it’s also used in desserts like key lime pie or drizzled over air-fried fruit for a refreshing twist. Whether you're squeezing fresh limes or using bottled juice, 0.75 cup (6 fl oz) is a measurement you’ll encounter often. For more recipe ideas, check out the <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipes section</a> on our site, where precise measurements like this are always highlighted.</p>  

<h3>How to measure 0.75 cup of lime juice</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a measuring cup marked in 0.75 increments, you can use a simple trick. Fill a 1-cup measure three-quarters full, or combine ½ cup and ¼ cup for the same result. For even more accuracy, a kitchen scale set to ounces will confirm you’ve got exactly 6 fl oz. This method is especially useful when preparing dishes like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/shrimp>air fryer shrimp</a>, where the lime juice quantity affects both flavour and texture.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for 0.75 cup of lime juice</h2>  
<p>This amount of lime juice is perfect for marinating a medium-sized batch of protein, such as chicken thighs or prawns, before air frying. It’s also ideal for whipping up dressings or sauces to accompany your air-fried meals. For instance, a 0.75-cup portion can be mixed with honey and garlic for a sticky glaze or blended with yoghurt for a creamy dip. If you're experimenting with <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>air fryer vegetables</a>, a lime juice drizzle adds brightness without overwhelming the natural flavours.</p>

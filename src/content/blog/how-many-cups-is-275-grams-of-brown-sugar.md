<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Baking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers cook food quickly and evenly, but only if your ingredient ratios are correct. Too much or too little brown sugar can affect texture, browning, and even cooking times. For example, excess sugar may cause your cookies to spread too thin, while too little can leave them dry. That's why converting 275 grams of brown sugar to cups accurately is crucial.

<p>Brown sugar is denser than granulated sugar, so it packs differently in a measuring cup. Lightly packing it ensures you don’t end up with more sugar than needed. If you're adapting a recipe from grams to cups, always use the spoon-and-level method for consistency. This is especially important for air fryer recipes, where even heat distribution relies on balanced ingredients.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure 275 Grams of Brown Sugar Without Scales</h3>  
<p>No kitchen scales? No problem! You can still measure 275 grams of brown sugar using standard cups. One lightly packed cup of brown sugar weighs roughly 220 grams, so 275 grams is just over 1 1/4 cups. For precision, fill your cup loosely and level it off with a knife. If your recipe calls for tightly packed sugar, you might need slightly less—around 1.2 cups.

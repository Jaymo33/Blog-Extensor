<p>275 grams of brown sugar equals approximately 1.3 cups when lightly packed. This conversion is essential for air fryer baking, where precise measurements can make or break your recipe. Whether you're whipping up cookies or a cake, knowing how to convert grams to cups ensures consistency. For more air fryer conversions, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Baking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers cook food quickly and evenly, but only if your ingredient ratios are correct. Too much or too little brown sugar can affect texture, browning, and even cooking times. For example, excess sugar may cause your cookies to spread too thin, while too little can leave them dry. That's why converting 275 grams of brown sugar to cups accurately is crucial. Visit <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>our recipe hub</a> for foolproof air fryer desserts.</p>  

<p>Brown sugar is denser than granulated sugar, so it packs differently in a measuring cup. Lightly packing it ensures you don’t end up with more sugar than needed. If you're adapting a recipe from grams to cups, always use the spoon-and-level method for consistency. This is especially important for air fryer recipes, where even heat distribution relies on balanced ingredients.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure 275 Grams of Brown Sugar Without Scales</h3>  
<p>No kitchen scales? No problem! You can still measure 275 grams of brown sugar using standard cups. One lightly packed cup of brown sugar weighs roughly 220 grams, so 275 grams is just over 1 1/4 cups. For precision, fill your cup loosely and level it off with a knife. If your recipe calls for tightly packed sugar, you might need slightly less—around 1.2 cups. For more tips, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert category</a>.</p>  

<h2>US vs UK Cup Measurements for Brown Sugar</h2>  
<p>Did you know US and UK cup sizes differ slightly? A US cup holds 240ml, while a UK cup is 250ml. This small variance can add up when converting 275 grams of brown sugar to cups. In the UK, 275 grams equals about 1.25 cups, whereas in the US, it’s closer to 1.3 cups. Always check where your recipe originates to avoid mishaps. For globally inspired treats, browse our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>cake recipes</a>.</p>  

<p>If you're using an American air fryer recipe, stick to US cup measurements for best results. Conversely, UK recipes will specify metric weights for accuracy. When in doubt, weigh your ingredients—especially for finicky bakes like soufflés or macarons. A digital scale is a baker’s best friend, but our cup conversion guide ensures you’re never stuck.</p>  

<h3>Common Recipes Using 275 Grams of Brown Sugar</h3>  
<p>From sticky toffee pudding to chocolate chip cookies, 275 grams of brown sugar is a sweet spot for many desserts. In the air fryer, this amount works perfectly for small-batch bakes or glazes. Try it in our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cookies>cookie collection</a> for chewy, caramelised results. Brown sugar’s moisture content also helps retain tenderness in air-fried cakes.</p>

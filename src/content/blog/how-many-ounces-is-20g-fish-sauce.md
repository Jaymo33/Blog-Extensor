<p>20g of fish sauce equals approximately 0.71 ounces. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements can make or break a dish. Whether you're marinating chicken or adding depth to a stir-fry, knowing the exact weight ensures consistent results. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we focus on making conversions simple so you can cook with confidence.</p>

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on precise cooking times and ingredient ratios to deliver crispy, evenly cooked meals. Too much or too little fish sauce can alter the flavour and texture of your dish. For example, a <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>salmon recipe</a> might call for 20g of fish sauce, and getting it right ensures the perfect balance of umami. Conversions like 20g fish sauce to ounces help you follow recipes accurately, especially when using international guides.</p>  

<p>Many UK cooks prefer working in grams, but some recipes use ounces. Knowing that 20g of fish sauce is 0.71 ounces eliminates guesswork. This is particularly useful for <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken marinades</a>, where even small deviations can affect taste. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a> simplifies these calculations, so you spend less time measuring and more time cooking.</p>  

<h3>How to measure 20g of fish sauce without scales</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a kitchen scale, you can use volume measurements. Roughly, 20g of fish sauce equals 1.5 tablespoons or 4.5 teaspoons. However, weighing is more accurate, as viscosity can vary. For air fryer recipes, precision ensures sauces coat evenly, whether you're preparing <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>roasted vegetables</a> or glazing meats.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for 20g of fish sauce in air fryer recipes</h2>  
<p>Fish sauce adds a savoury kick to many dishes. In an air fryer, 20g (0.71 ounces) is often used for marinades, dressings, or dipping sauces. For example, a Thai-inspired <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/shrimp>shrimp recipe</a> might combine 20g fish sauce with lime and garlic. The air fryer locks in these flavours while crisping the exterior perfectly.</p>  

<p>Another popular use is in stir-fry sauces. A mix of 20g fish sauce, soy sauce, and honey creates a glossy glaze for tofu or chicken. Since air fryers circulate heat so efficiently, these sauces caramelise beautifully. Always measure carefully—20g fish sauce to oz conversions ensure you don’t overpower the dish.</p>  

<h3>Storing fish sauce for long-term use</h3>  
<p>Fish sauce has a long shelf life but should be kept in a cool, dark place. Once opened, refrigerate it to maintain quality. A 20g portion (0.71 ounces) is easy to measure from a well-stored bottle, ensuring your <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer meals</a> taste fresh every time.</p>

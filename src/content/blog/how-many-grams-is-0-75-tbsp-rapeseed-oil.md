<h2>Why accurate oil measurements matter in air frying</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of oil in your air fryer is crucial for achieving that perfect golden crisp without excess grease.

<p>Many air fryer enthusiasts prefer measuring oil by weight rather than volume for greater precision. A kitchen scale ensures you’re adding exactly 10.5 grams of rapeseed oil, eliminating guesswork. This is particularly helpful when preparing dishes from our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipe category</a>, where even coating is key.</p>

<h2>Comparing rapeseed oil to other cooking oils</h2>  
<p>While 0.75 tbsp of rapeseed oil converts to 10.5 grams, other oils have slightly different weights. Olive oil, for instance, weighs about 11 grams for the same volume due to its higher density. This variation matters when substituting oils in air fryer recipes from our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetables category</a>, as it can affect cooking times and results.</p>  

<p>Rapeseed oil’s light texture makes it ideal for air frying, distributing evenly across food surfaces. When you measure out 0.75 tbsp (10.5g), you’re applying just enough to promote browning without drowning your ingredients. This precision is why many <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> favourites specify oil amounts in both volume and weight.</p>  

<h3>Storing and using rapeseed oil for air frying</h3>  
<p>Proper storage maintains rapeseed oil’s quality between uses. Keep it in a cool, dark place to prevent rancidity.

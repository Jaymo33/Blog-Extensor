<p>2 cups of Greek yogurt equals approximately 16 ounces (or 454 grams) in weight. This conversion is essential for precise cooking, especially when using an air fryer where ingredient ratios can affect texture and cooking times. Whether you're meal prepping or following a recipe from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, knowing this measurement ensures consistency.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on even heat distribution, so ingredient quantities must be precise. Too much or too little Greek yogurt can alter moisture levels, affecting dishes like marinades, dips, or baked goods. For example, a <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>chicken marinade</a> with incorrect yogurt amounts might turn out overly dry or soggy. Measuring by weight (ounces) is more reliable than volume (cups) because density varies. Greek yogurt is thicker than regular yogurt, so 2 cups will weigh slightly more than lighter varieties.</p>  

<p>If you're converting 2 cups of Greek yogurt to ounces for a recipe, use a kitchen scale for accuracy. This is particularly helpful for air fryer recipes, where small deviations can impact crisping or browning. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for other common ingredient swaps.</p>  

<h3>How to measure Greek yogurt without a scale</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a scale, use the spoon-and-level method for cups. Stir the yogurt to loosen it, then spoon it into a measuring cup without packing it down. Level off the top with a knife for an approximate 8-ounce cup. Remember, this method isn’t as precise as weighing, but it works in a pinch for recipes like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>air fryer desserts</a>.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for 2 cups of Greek yogurt in air fryer recipes</h2>  
<p>Greek yogurt is a versatile ingredient in air fryer cooking. Two cups (16 ounces) can be used for marinades, such as tandoori chicken or kebabs, where the yogurt tenderizes meat while adding flavour. It’s also great for baking—think yogurt cakes or muffins, which benefit from the air fryer’s rapid heat. For a savoury twist, try mixing it with herbs as a dip for air-fried veggies.</p>  

<p>Cleaning your air fryer after using yogurt-based recipes? Check our guide on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner</a> to prevent residue buildup. Yogurt can stick to baskets, so prompt cleaning ensures longevity.</p>  

<h3>UK vs. US measurements for Greek yogurt</h3>  
<p>In the UK, metric measurements (grams) are more common, but ounces are still used in recipes. Two cups of Greek yogurt translate to roughly 16 UK fluid ounces (by volume) or 454 grams (by weight). If you’re adapting a US recipe, note that UK cups are slightly larger (284ml vs. 240ml), but the weight remains consistent for thick yogurt.</p>  

<h2>Tips for substituting Greek yogurt in air fryer recipes</h2>  
<p>If you’re short on Greek yogurt, you can substitute sour cream or regular yogurt, but adjust the quantity. For example, 2 cups of Greek yogurt (16 oz) can be replaced with 14 oz of sour cream to account for differences in thickness. Always check the recipe on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> for specific guidance, especially for baked goods where acidity matters.</p>  

<p>For dairy-free alternatives, coconut yogurt works but may add a subtle flavour. Reduce liquid elsewhere in the recipe to compensate for extra moisture. Experiment with small batches in your air fryer to perfect the texture.</p>

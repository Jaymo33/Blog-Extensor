<p>60 ml of lemon juice equals approximately 0.25 cups (or 1/4 cup). This conversion is essential for precise baking and cooking, especially when using an air fryer where measurements matter. Whether you're making lemon drizzle cake or zesty chicken marinades, getting the lemon juice quantity right ensures perfect results every time.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Lemon Juice Measurements Matter</h2>
<p>When working with lemon juice in recipes, precision is key. Too much can overpower a dish, while too little might leave it lacking flavour. In air fryer cooking, where ingredients cook quickly at high heat, balanced acidity is particularly important. Lemon juice affects browning, tenderness and overall taste.</p>
<p>Many <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> call for lemon juice as a marinade component or finishing touch. From crispy lemon chicken to citrus-infused vegetables, knowing that 60ml equals 0.25 cups helps you adapt recipes confidently. This measurement applies whether you're using fresh squeezed or bottled lemon juice.</p>

<h3>Metric to Imperial Conversion Basics</h3>
<p>The metric system measures liquids in millilitres while imperial uses cups. For lemon juice and other liquids, 240ml equals 1 cup. Therefore, 60ml is exactly one quarter of that measurement. This conversion works for all types of lemon juice - whether freshly squeezed or store-bought.</p>

<h2>Measuring Lemon Juice for Air Fryer Recipes</h2>
<p>When preparing ingredients for your air fryer, proper measurement ensures consistent results. For 60ml (0.25 cups) of lemon juice, use a liquid measuring cup with clear metric and imperial markings. Alternatively, four 15ml tablespoons will give you the right amount if you don't have a 60ml measure.</p>
<p>Many popular <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>air fryer chicken recipes</a> use lemon juice in marinades. Knowing that 60ml equals 0.25 cups helps you scale recipes up or down. The acidity in lemon juice also helps tenderise meat while adding bright flavour notes that complement the air fryer's crispy cooking style.</p>

<h3>Adjusting Recipes With Lemon Juice</h3>
<p>When modifying recipes that call for 60ml of lemon juice, remember the 0.25 cup equivalent. This knowledge lets you easily double recipes (120ml = 0.5 cups) or halve them (30ml = 0.125 cups). Such adjustments are common when adapting conventional oven recipes for air fryer use.</p>

<h2>Lemon Juice Substitutes and Equivalents</h2>
<p>If you're out of lemon juice but your recipe calls for 60ml (0.25 cups), you can substitute lime juice in equal amounts. For baking, 60ml of lemon juice can be replaced with 45ml of vinegar plus 15ml of water, though the flavour will differ. These substitutions work well in most <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>air fryer dessert recipes</a>.</p>
<p>When working with lemon zest instead of juice, remember that one medium lemon yields about 1 tablespoon (15ml) of juice and 1 teaspoon of zest. So for 60ml juice, you'd need about four lemons. This conversion is handy when following <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion charts</a> that list ingredients differently.</p>

<h3>Storing Leftover Lemon Juice</h3>
<p>After measuring out your 60ml (0.25 cups) of lemon juice, store any leftovers properly. Fresh lemon juice keeps for 2-3 days in the fridge, while bottled juice lasts months unopened. Consider freezing measured portions in ice cube trays for future air fryer recipes - each cube is typically 30ml, so two cubes equal 60ml.</p>

<h2>Common Uses for 60ml Lemon Juice in Air Fryers</h2>
<p>Many air fryer recipes use 60ml (0.25 cups) of lemon juice as a standard measurement. It's perfect for marinating a whole chicken before air frying, creating tangy glazes for fish, or brightening vegetable dishes. The acidity helps balance richer flavours that develop during the air frying process.</p>

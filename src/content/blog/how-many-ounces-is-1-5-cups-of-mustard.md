<h2>Why accurate mustard measurements matter</h2>  
<p>Precision is key when cooking, especially with bold ingredients like mustard. Too much can overpower a dish, while too little might leave it bland.

Whether you're making a glaze for chicken or a dip for veggies, 1.5 cups of mustard (12 ounces) is a common measurement. For more recipe ideas, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a>.</p>  

<h2>How to measure mustard correctly</h2>  
<p>Measuring mustard can be tricky due to its thick consistency. For best results, use a liquid measuring cup for accuracy. Spoon the mustard into the cup and level it off with a knife to avoid excess. If you're converting 1.5 cups of mustard to ounces, remember it’s roughly 12 ounces. This method works for both yellow and Dijon mustard, though grain mustard may vary slightly.</p>  

<h3>Using mustard in air fryer recipes</h3>

<h3>Mustard substitutes in a pinch</h3>

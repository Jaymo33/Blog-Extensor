<p>425 grams of self-raising flour equals approximately 3.4 cups when measured correctly. This conversion is essential for baking, especially when using an air fryer for cakes or bread. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we know precise measurements make all the difference in achieving perfect results. Whether you're following a UK or US recipe, understanding how many cups is 425 grams of self-raising flour ensures consistency.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Flour Measurements Matter</h2>
<p>Baking is a science, and even small measurement errors can lead to dense or dry results. When converting 425 grams of self-raising flour to cups, factors like scooping method and flour settling come into play. For air fryer recipes, where space and heat distribution are critical, precision ensures even cooking. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> simplifies these calculations for all your baking needs.</p>
<p>Self-raising flour contains baking powder, so incorrect measurements can affect rise and texture. Whether making scones or muffins in your air fryer, knowing 425g self-raising flour in cups guarantees the right lift. Visit our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipes section</a> for ideas that put this measurement to delicious use.</p>

<h3>UK vs US Cup Measurements</h3>
<p>The UK and US use slightly different cup sizes, which matters when converting 425 grams of self-raising flour. A UK cup holds 250ml, while a US cup is 240ml. This means 425g of self-raising flour equals roughly 3.4 UK cups or 3.5 US cups. Always check your recipe's origin for the best results.</p>

<h2>How to Measure 425g Self-Raising Flour Correctly</h2>
<p>For the most accurate conversion of 425 grams self-raising flour to cups, spoon the flour into the cup and level it off. Avoid scooping directly from the bag, as this compacts the flour and leads to excess. If your air fryer recipe calls for 425g self-raising flour, this method ensures consistency batch after batch.</p>

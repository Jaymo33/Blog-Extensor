<h3>Using 4.25 kg Prawns in Air Fryer Recipes</h3>
<p>When working with 4.25 kg prawns to pounds conversion, consider how this quantity fits into your air fryer capacity. Most household air fryers can handle around 1-2 pounds of food per batch, so 9.37 pounds will require multiple batches. This is important for planning cooking times and ensuring each batch cooks evenly. Preheat your air fryer between batches to maintain consistent temperature. Season prawns uniformly to guarantee every piece is flavourful.

Keeping a conversion app or chart in your kitchen can prevent these errors. Practice makes perfect, and soon converting 4.25 kg prawns to pounds will become second nature.

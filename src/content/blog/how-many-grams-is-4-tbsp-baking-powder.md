<p>4 tablespoons (tbsp) of baking powder equals approximately 48 grams (g). This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements ensure perfect texture and rise. Whether you're baking cakes, bread, or even savoury dishes in your air fryer, getting the right amount of baking powder is crucial. For more handy conversions, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate baking powder measurements matter</h2>  
<p>Using the correct amount of baking powder ensures your air fryer recipes turn out light and fluffy. Too little, and your baked goods won't rise properly. Too much, and they might collapse or taste bitter. This is especially important in air fryers, where heat distribution differs from conventional ovens. If you're new to air fryer baking, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a> has plenty of tested ideas to get you started.</p>  

<p>Baking powder is a leavening agent that reacts with moisture and heat. In an air fryer, the rapid circulation of hot air means reactions happen faster. That's why measuring 4 tbsp baking powder accurately in grams (48g) helps maintain consistency. For more baking tips, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>cake recipes</a> designed specifically for air fryers.</p>  

<h3>How to measure 4 tbsp baking powder correctly</h3>  
<p>To measure 4 tablespoons of baking powder, use a proper measuring spoon and level it off with a knife. For greater accuracy, a digital kitchen scale is ideal. Scooping directly from the container can compact the powder, leading to incorrect measurements. If you're converting other ingredients, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion guide</a> simplifies the process.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for 4 tbsp baking powder in air fryer recipes</h2>  
<p>Four tablespoons of baking powder (48g) is typically used in larger batches of batter or dough. This could include air fryer cakes, muffins, or even savoury dishes like tempura. The air fryer's intense heat activates the baking powder quickly, so precise measurements prevent over- or under-rising. For inspiration, browse our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert recipes</a> tailored for air fryers.</p>  

<p>When adapting conventional recipes for the air fryer, remember that 4 tbsp baking powder equals 48g. This ensures your conversions are spot-on. If you're working with frozen ingredients, check out our guide on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning your air fryer</a> after cooking with powdery substances like baking powder.</p>  

<h3>Storing baking powder for accurate measurements</h3>  
<p>Keep your baking powder in an airtight container to maintain its potency. Humidity can cause clumping, making it harder to measure precise amounts like 4 tbsp (48g). Store it in a cool, dry place away from direct sunlight for best results in your air fryer creations.</p>

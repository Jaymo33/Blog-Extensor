<p>3 tablespoons (tbsp) of minced garlic equals approximately 45 grams (g). This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements ensure the best flavour and texture. Whether you’re whipping up garlic-infused dishes or adjusting seasoning, knowing the exact weight saves time and hassle. For more handy conversions, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>

<h2>Why accurate garlic measurements matter in air frying</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of minced garlic ensures your dishes aren’t overpowering or bland. In an air fryer, ingredients cook quickly, so balanced seasoning is key. Too much garlic can burn, while too little might leave your meal tasting flat. For recipes like garlic butter shrimp or roasted veggies, 45g (3 tbsp) of minced garlic strikes the perfect balance. Explore more <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> to test this measurement.</p>  

<p>Garlic’s moisture content can slightly affect weight, so finely minced garlic packs more densely. If your recipe calls for heaped tablespoons, expect closer to 50g. For consistent results, level off each tablespoon with a knife. This tip is especially useful for meal prep, where precision matters. Need inspiration? Try our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>garlic chicken recipes</a>.</p>  

<h3>How to measure minced garlic without scales</h3>  
<p>No kitchen scales? A standard UK tablespoon holds about 15g of minced garlic. Use measuring spoons for accuracy, and avoid compacting the garlic. If using store-bought minced garlic, check the label—some brands list tablespoon-to-gram equivalents. For fresh garlic, one medium clove yields roughly 1 tsp (5g), so you’d need 9 cloves for 3 tbsp.

<h2>Common recipes using 3 tbsp minced garlic</h2>  
<p>Many air fryer favourites rely on this quantity. Garlic bread, for instance, uses 3 tbsp (45g) mixed with butter for a rich, aromatic coating. Similarly, garlic mushrooms or tofu benefit from this measurement for bold, even flavouring. Adjust slightly for personal taste, but 45g is a reliable starting point.

<p>For proteins like salmon or lamb, 3 tbsp of minced garlic creates a robust marinade. Combine with olive oil and herbs, then air fry for a restaurant-quality finish. Remember, minced garlic’s intensity mellows when cooked, so don’t shy away from the full 45g. Craving variety? Browse our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/seafood>seafood recipes</a> for garlicky inspiration.</p>  

<h3>Storing minced garlic for future use</h3>  
<p>Pre-minced garlic saves time, but how much equals 3 tbsp? A 200g jar typically contains 4–5 portions of 45g. Transfer leftovers to an airtight container and refrigerate for up to two weeks. For longer storage, freeze minced garlic in ice cube trays—each cube holds about 1 tbsp (15g). Thaw as needed for quick, flavourful meals.</p>

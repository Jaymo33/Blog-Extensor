<p>40 grams of almond butter equals approximately 1.41 ounces. Whether you're whipping up a batch of energy balls or perfecting an air fryer dessert, knowing this conversion ensures your recipes turn out just right. Almond butter is a popular ingredient in healthy snacks and baked goods, so getting the measurements spot-on matters. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we love helping you nail every detail, from conversions to cooking times.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate almond butter measurements matter</h2>  
<p>Almond butter adds richness and moisture to recipes, but too much or too little can throw off the texture. In air fryer baking, precise measurements prevent dry or overly dense results. For example, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>almond butter cookie recipes</a> rely on the perfect 40g-to-ounces ratio for chewy centres. Even savoury dishes, like almond-crusted chicken, benefit from exact quantities to balance flavours.</p>  
<p>Using a kitchen scale is the most reliable method, but if yours only displays ounces, knowing that 40g is 1.41 oz saves time. This conversion also comes in handy when following American recipes, which often list nut butters in ounces rather than grams.

<h3>How to measure 40g of almond butter without scales</h3>  
<p>No scales? No problem. Two level tablespoons of almond butter will give you roughly 40g (1.41 oz). For sticky nut butters, lightly grease the spoon first for cleaner scooping. If your recipe calls for melted almond butter, measure it solid first for accuracy – melting alters the volume but not the weight. This trick works perfectly for our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>air fryer dessert recipes</a>.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for 40g of almond butter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>This quantity is ideal for single-serving treats or recipe components. Blend 40g (1.41 oz) into protein bars, swirl it into air-fried banana oats, or use it as a glaze for roasted vegetables. Our readers love incorporating it into <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/breakfast>air fryer breakfast recipes</a> for a protein boost. The mild nuttiness complements both sweet and savoury dishes without overpowering other ingredients.</p>  
<p>When substituting almond butter for other nut butters in air fryer recipes, stick to the 40g measurement unless adjusting for sweetness or oil content. Cashew butter, for instance, is creamier, while peanut butter has a stronger flavour. Always check our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning guide</a> after working with sticky ingredients to keep your appliance in top condition.</p>  

<h3>Storage tips for leftover almond butter</h3>  
<p>After measuring out your 40g (1.41 oz), store the rest in an airtight container in the fridge. Properly stored almond butter lasts up to three months. Stir in any separated oils before use – this ensures consistent measurements for future recipes. For best results in air fryer cooking, bring chilled almond butter to room temperature before incorporating it into batters or doughs.</p>

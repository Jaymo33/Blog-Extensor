<h2>Practical tips for cooking a 3 kg turkey crown in your air fryer</h2>
<p>Once you've converted your 3 kg turkey crown to pounds (6.61 lbs), you can determine the ideal cooking time. Most air fryers require about 15-20 minutes per pound at 180°C for turkey crowns.

<p>Preparing your turkey crown properly before air frying enhances the results. Pat the skin dry with kitchen paper to ensure it crisps up nicely. Season generously with salt, pepper, and your favourite herbs, and consider rubbing with a little oil for extra crunch. If your air fryer basket is small, you might need to truss the crown to fit comfortably.

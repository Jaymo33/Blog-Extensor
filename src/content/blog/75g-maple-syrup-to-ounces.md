<h2>Why accurate maple syrup measurements matter</h2>
<p>Maple syrup is a sticky, viscous liquid where small measurement differences can significantly impact your recipe's outcome. Too much syrup can make dishes overly sweet or cause burning in air fryers, while too little might leave flavours underwhelming. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we recommend using digital scales for grams or proper liquid measuring cups for ounces to ensure accuracy.</p>
<p>Many popular air fryer recipes, like our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>maple-glazed salmon</a> or <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>sticky maple chicken wings</a>, call for precise syrup measurements. The 75g to ounces conversion becomes particularly important when adapting American recipes that use imperial measurements or when your kitchen scales only measure in grams.</p>

<h2>How to measure 75g of maple syrup without scales</h2>
<p>If you don't have digital scales, you can still measure 75g of maple syrup (approximately 2.65 ounces) using volume measurements. Maple syrup has a density of about 1.37 g/ml, meaning 75g equals roughly 55ml or 3.7 tablespoons. However, we always recommend weight measurements for better accuracy.</p>

<p>0.125 cup of semolina equals approximately 0.53 ounces (or roughly half an ounce). This measurement is essential for air fryer recipes where precision matters, ensuring your dishes turn out perfectly every time. Whether you're making crispy semolina-coated chicken or a light semolina cake, knowing the exact weight helps maintain consistency. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we focus on accurate conversions to make your cooking effortless.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Semolina Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Using the correct amount of semolina ensures your air fryer recipes have the right texture and consistency. Too little, and your coating might not crisp up; too much, and your dish could turn out dry. For example, if you're making semolina-crusted fish, 0.125 cup (0.53 oz) is often the perfect amount for a light, even coating. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more handy measurement tips.</p>  

<p>Semolina is a versatile ingredient, often used in both sweet and savoury dishes. Whether you're baking a semolina cake or coating chicken for a crispy finish, precise measurements ensure success. If you're new to air frying, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a> for inspiration.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure 0.125 Cup of Semolina</h3>  
<p>Measuring small quantities like 0.125 cup can be tricky without the right tools. A digital kitchen scale is the most accurate way, but if you don’t have one, use a standard measuring cup and fill it to the 1/8th mark. For best results, fluff the semolina before scooping and level it off with a straight edge.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for Semolina in Air Fryers</h2>  
<p>Semolina is a staple in many air fryer recipes, from crispy coatings to light batters. A 0.125 cup (0.53 oz) portion is ideal for coating chicken, fish, or even vegetables before air frying. It adds a delightful crunch without overpowering the dish. For more ideas, browse our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipes</a> featuring semolina.</p>  

<p>Another great use is in baking—semolina gives cakes and cookies a unique texture. If you're making semolina biscuits, 0.125 cup provides just the right amount for a batch. Don’t forget to check our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning guide</a> to keep your air fryer in top condition after cooking.</p>  

<h3>Converting Other Semolina Measurements</h3>  
<p>If your recipe calls for a different amount, here’s a quick reference: 1 cup of semolina equals about 4.25 ounces. So, 0.25 cup is roughly 1.06 oz, and 0.5 cup is around 2.13 oz. These conversions ensure you can scale recipes up or down with confidence.</p>

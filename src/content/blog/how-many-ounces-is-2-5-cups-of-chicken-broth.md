<p>2.5 cups of chicken broth equals 20 fluid ounces (or approximately 20 oz by weight for most standard broths). This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes, where precise measurements can make or break a dish. Whether you’re making soups, stews, or marinades, knowing how many ounces are in 2.5 cups of chicken broth ensures consistency. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we focus on making cooking conversions effortless for your kitchen adventures.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on precise ingredient ratios to achieve the perfect texture and flavour. Using the correct amount of chicken broth—whether 2.5 cups or its ounce equivalent—ensures your dishes aren’t too dry or overly soggy. For example, a <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>chicken and vegetable casserole</a> might call for 2.5 cups of broth, and knowing it’s 20 oz helps streamline prep. Consistency is key, especially when adapting stovetop recipes for the air fryer.</p>  

<p>Many air fryer recipes, like those in our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a>, require liquid adjustments. Chicken broth adds moisture and depth, but too much can lead to steaming instead of crisping. If a recipe lists broth in cups but your measuring jug uses ounces, this 2.5-cup-to-20-oz ratio is a lifesaver. It’s one less thing to worry about when experimenting with new dishes.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure Chicken Broth for Air Fryer Recipes</h3>  
<p>For accuracy, use a liquid measuring cup for 2.5 cups of chicken broth, then convert to ounces if needed. If you’re scaling a recipe up or down, remember that 1 cup of broth equals 8 fluid ounces. This makes it easy to halve or double quantities without guesswork. For thicker broths or stocks, weight may vary slightly, but 20 oz is a reliable standard for most cooking needs.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for 2.5 Cups of Chicken Broth in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>From marinades to braising liquids, 2.5 cups (20 oz) of chicken broth is a versatile ingredient. Try it in <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>air-fryer chicken recipes</a>, where it keeps meat juicy while crisping the skin. It’s also ideal for deglazing the air fryer basket after cooking, adding flavour to sauces. For vegetarian dishes, swap chicken broth for vegetable stock, using the same 2.5-cup-to-20-oz conversion.</p>  

<p>Another great use is in grain-based dishes, like air-fryer risotto or couscous. The 20 oz of broth ensures even cooking without drying out the grains. Prefer frozen meals? Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/frozen-foods>frozen foods section</a> for ideas using pre-portioned broth. Proper measurement guarantees your frozen favourites turn out perfectly every time.</p>  

<h3>Tips for Storing Leftover Chicken Broth</h3>  
<p>If your recipe only uses part of a 2.5-cup batch, store leftovers in an airtight container for up to 4 days. Freeze portions in ice cube trays for easy future use—each cube is roughly 1 oz, simplifying small-batch cooking.

<h2>Why accurate mayonnaise measurements matter</h2>
<p>Using the correct amount of mayonnaise can make or break your air fryer dish. Too much can lead to excess oil, while too little might leave your food dry. A precise 14 grams per tablespoon ensures balanced moisture and crispiness. This is especially important for recipes like air-fried chicken or fish, where mayonnaise acts as a binder for breadcrumbs.

<p>Mayonnaise density can vary slightly by brand, but 14 grams is a reliable standard for UK measurements. If you’re using a heaped tablespoon, it might weigh closer to 16 grams. For best results, use a digital kitchen scale to confirm. This small step can elevate your air fryer cooking from good to great.</p>

<h2>How to measure 1 tbsp mayonnaise without scales</h2>
<p>If you don’t have a scale, use a levelled UK tablespoon for the closest approximation. Fill the spoon and scrape off the excess with a straight edge for accuracy. Remember, 1 tbsp of mayonnaise to grams is roughly 14g, but slight variations won’t ruin most dishes. For baking or precise recipes, though, scales are ideal.</p>
<p>Another trick is to check the mayonnaise jar’s nutrition label, which often lists grams per serving. Many UK brands specify 14g per tablespoon, making conversions easier.

<h3>Common mistakes when converting tablespoons to grams</h3>
<p>One error is using a dessert spoon instead of a tablespoon, which holds less mayonnaise. Another is compacting the mayonnaise into the spoon, which increases the weight. Always measure lightly for the most accurate 1 tbsp mayonnaise in grams result. These small details ensure your air fryer meals turn out perfectly every time.</p>

<h2>Mayonnaise conversions for popular air fryer recipes</h2>
<p>Many air fryer recipes, like crispy chicken or potato wedges, use mayonnaise for extra flavour and texture. For example, a coating of 28 grams (2 tbsp) of mayonnaise helps breadcrumbs adhere evenly.

<p>If you’re adapting a recipe from cups to grams, note that 1 cup of mayonnaise weighs around 224 grams (16 tbsp). This conversion is handy for larger batches or meal prep. Whether you’re cooking for one or a family, precise measurements ensure consistent results.</p>

<h3>Does mayonnaise brand affect the weight per tablespoon?</h3>
<p>While most UK mayonnaise brands weigh about 14g per tbsp, lighter or premium versions may differ slightly. Always check the label if precision is crucial. For everyday cooking, the standard 1 tbsp mayonnaise to grams conversion works perfectly.</p>

<h2>Why Convert Tablespoons to Grams?</h2>

<h3>How to Measure Onion Accurately</h3>  
<p>For the most accurate 5 tbsp onion to grams conversion, finely chop the onion before measuring. Pack the tablespoons lightly without pressing too hard, as compacting can alter the weight. A kitchen scale is the best tool for verifying the exact grams.</p>

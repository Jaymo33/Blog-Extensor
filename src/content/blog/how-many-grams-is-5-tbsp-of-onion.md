<p>5 tablespoons of onion roughly equals 50 grams, making it easy to measure for air fryer recipes. Whether you're cooking a stir-fry, soup, or a delicious air-fried dish, knowing this conversion ensures accuracy. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we help simplify cooking measurements so you can focus on flavour.</p>  

<h2>Why Convert Tablespoons to Grams?</h2>  
<p>Converting 5 tbsp of onion to grams ensures consistency in your cooking, especially for air fryer recipes. Unlike volume measurements, grams provide precise weight, reducing the risk of over or under-seasoning. This is particularly useful when following detailed recipes from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes</a>, where accuracy matters.</p>  

<p>Different onion types, such as red, white, or spring onions, may vary slightly in density. However, 5 tablespoons of finely chopped onion generally weigh around 50 grams. If you're using larger chunks, the weight might differ slightly, so adjust accordingly.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure Onion Accurately</h3>  
<p>For the most accurate 5 tbsp onion to grams conversion, finely chop the onion before measuring. Pack the tablespoons lightly without pressing too hard, as compacting can alter the weight. A kitchen scale is the best tool for verifying the exact grams.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for 5 Tbsp Onion in Air Fryer Recipes</h2>  
<p>From stir-fries to stuffed peppers, 5 tbsp of onion (50g) adds depth to many air fryer dishes. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable recipes</a> for inspiration. Onions caramelise beautifully in the air fryer, enhancing flavour without excess oil.</p>  

<p>If you're meal prepping, knowing the 5 tbsp onion in grams conversion helps with portion control. Pre-measured onions save time and ensure even cooking, whether you're making fajitas, soups, or casseroles.</p>  

<h3>Adjusting Recipes for Different Onion Types</h3>  
<p>Spring onions or shallots may weigh slightly less than standard onions per tablespoon. If substituting, use a kitchen scale to confirm the 5 tablespoon of onion to g ratio. This ensures your air fryer dish turns out perfectly every time.</p>  

<h2>Handy Conversion Tips for Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Bookmark our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for quick reference when switching between measurements. Whether it's 5 tbsp equals how many grams of onion or other ingredients, having a guide simplifies cooking.</p>  

<p>For best results, always weigh ingredients when precision mattersâ€”especially in baking or spice-heavy dishes. A small discrepancy in onion quantity can alter the taste, so measuring correctly ensures consistency.</p>  

<h3>Storing Pre-Measured Onions</h3>  
<p>If you've converted 5 tbsp onion to grams and have leftovers, store them in an airtight container. Pre-chopped onions stay fresh for 2-3 days in the fridge, ready for your next air fryer recipe.</p>

<p>20 grams (20g) of minced onion equals approximately 0.71 ounces (0.71 oz). This conversion is handy when following air fryer recipes that list ingredients in grams but require ounces for precise measuring. Whether you're preparing a quick stir-fry or a slow-cooked dish, knowing this conversion ensures your meals turn out perfectly seasoned every time.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Precision is key when using an air fryer, as ingredients cook quickly and evenly. Too much or too little minced onion can alter the flavour balance of your dish. For example, adding 20g of minced onion (0.71 oz) to a chicken marinade or vegetable stir-fry ensures the right amount of savoury depth without overpowering other ingredients.</p>  

<p>Many UK recipes, especially those on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, provide measurements in grams for consistency. If your kitchen scale only displays ounces, this conversion helps bridge the gap. Whether you're cooking frozen foods or fresh vegetables, accurate measurements lead to better results.</p>  

<h3>How to measure 20g of minced onion without a scale</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a digital scale, you can estimate 20g of minced onion using tablespoons. Roughly, 20g equals about 2.5 tablespoons of minced onion. However, for best results in air fryer recipes, investing in a small kitchen scale is ideal. This ensures you’re adding exactly 0.71 oz of minced onion every time.</p>  

<h2>Common recipes using 20g of minced onion</h2>  
<p>Minced onion is a versatile ingredient in many air fryer dishes. From <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipes</a> to vegetable stir-fries, 20g (0.71 oz) adds just the right amount of flavour. For example, a classic air fryer meatloaf might call for 20g of minced onion to enhance its savoury profile without making it too pungent.</p>  

<p>You’ll also find 20g of minced onion in many <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable-based air fryer recipes</a>. Whether you’re roasting potatoes or preparing stuffed mushrooms, this measurement ensures balanced seasoning. Check out <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> for more inspiration on how to use minced onion in your cooking.</p>  

<h3>Converting other minced onion quantities</h3>  
<p>If your recipe calls for more or less minced onion, you can use the same conversion ratio. For instance, 10g of minced onion equals 0.35 oz, while 50g equals 1.76 oz. Keeping a <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a> handy simplifies meal prep and ensures consistency.</p>  

<h2>Tips for storing minced onion</h2>  
<p>To keep minced onion fresh for future air fryer recipes, store it in an airtight container in the fridge. If you’ve pre-measured 20g (0.71 oz) portions, label them for quick access. Frozen minced onion also works well in air fryer dishes, though you may need to adjust cooking times slightly.</p>

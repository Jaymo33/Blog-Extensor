This conversion is essential for precise cooking, especially when using an air fryer where exact measurements can affect texture and flavour. Whether you're making marinades, dressings, or desserts, knowing how to convert cups to ml ensures your recipes turn out perfectly every time.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on precise ingredient ratios to achieve the best results. Too much or too little liquid, like lemon juice, can alter cooking times and textures. For example, a marinade with too much lemon juice might make meat overly acidic, while too little could leave it bland. Using the correct measurement—768.91 ml for 3.25 cups—ensures balanced flavours and even cooking.</p>

<h2>How to Measure Lemon Juice Correctly</h2>  
<p>When converting 3.25 cups of lemon juice to ml, it’s important to measure the juice accurately. Use a liquid measuring cup for the most precise results, and fill it to the 3.25-cup mark at eye level. Avoid using dry measuring cups, as they can lead to inconsistencies. Freshly squeezed lemon juice may contain pulp, so strain it if your recipe requires a smooth consistency.</p>  

<h3>Using Bottled vs. Fresh Lemon Juice</h3>  
<p>Bottled lemon juice is convenient, but its acidity can vary slightly from fresh juice. If your recipe calls for 3.25 cups (768.91 ml) of lemon juice, stick to one type for consistency. Fresh juice adds a brighter flavour, while bottled juice offers longer shelf life. For air fryer recipes like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>lemon garlic chicken</a>, fresh juice often yields the best results.</p>  

<h2>Common Recipes Using 3.25 Cups of Lemon Juice</h2>  
<p>This quantity of lemon juice is often used in large-batch recipes, such as dressings, marinades, or citrus-based desserts. For example, a lemon glaze for cakes or a tangy sauce for air-fried shrimp might require this measurement. If you’re scaling up a recipe, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a> includes portion-adjusted ideas to try.</p>  
<p>Lemon juice also works wonders in <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>air fryer desserts</a>, like lemon drizzle cake or citrus-infused cookies. The acidity helps balance sweetness, creating a well-rounded flavour. Just remember to measure carefully—768.91 ml of lemon juice ensures your dish isn’t too tart or too mild.</p>  

<h3>Adjusting for UK and US Cup Sizes</h3>  
<p>Note that UK and US cup measurements differ slightly. A US cup is 240 ml, while a UK cup is 250 ml. For 3.25 cups, this means 780 ml in the UK versus 768.91 ml in the US. Most recipes on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> use US measurements, but always check the recipe notes to avoid confusion.</p>  

<h2>Tips for Storing Leftover Lemon Juice</h2>  
<p>If you have extra lemon juice after measuring out 3.25 cups (768.91 ml), store it in an airtight container in the fridge for up to a week. For longer storage, freeze it in ice cube trays—each cube holds about 30 ml, making future measurements a breeze. This trick is perfect for air fryer cooks who love citrus flavours but don’t want to waste fresh ingredients.</p>

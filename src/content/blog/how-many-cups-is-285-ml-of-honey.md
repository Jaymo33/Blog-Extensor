<p>285 ml of honey equals approximately 1.2 cups. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes, where precise measurements can make or break your dish. Whether you’re whipping up a glaze or sweetening a marinade, knowing how to convert 285 ml of honey to cups ensures consistency. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we focus on making cooking conversions effortless, so you can focus on creating delicious meals.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Honey Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of honey in your air fryer recipes ensures balanced flavours and textures. Too much honey can make dishes overly sweet or sticky, while too little might leave them bland. For example, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>honey-glazed salmon recipe</a> relies on precise measurements to achieve the perfect caramelisation. Converting 285 ml of honey to cups (1.2 cups) helps maintain this balance, whether you’re baking or cooking.</p>  

<p>Honey’s viscosity means it doesn’t pour like water, making measuring tricky. A kitchen scale can help, but if you’re using cups, levelling off the honey ensures accuracy. For more tips on measuring sticky ingredients, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure 285 ml of Honey Without a Scale</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a scale, use a liquid measuring cup for 285 ml of honey. Lightly grease the cup with oil to help the honey slide out easily. Fill it to the 285 ml mark, then scrape out every last drop for accuracy. This method works well for recipes like our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>honey-drizzled desserts</a>, where precision matters.</p>  

<h2>Converting 285 ml of Honey in Different Cup Sizes</h2>  
<p>In the UK, a standard cup holds 250 ml, meaning 285 ml of honey is roughly 1.14 UK cups. In the US, where a cup is 240 ml, 285 ml equals about 1.19 US cups. This small difference might not seem significant, but for baking, it’s worth noting. Always check which cup measurement your recipe uses to avoid mishaps.</p>  

<p>For air fryer cooking, slight variations can affect browning and texture. If a recipe calls for 285 ml of honey (1.2 cups), stick to the specified measurement for best results. Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>honey-mustard chicken recipes</a> to see how precise measurements elevate flavours.</p>  

<h3>Common Recipes Using 285 ml of Honey</h3>

From glazes for meats like our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/turkey>honey-roasted turkey</a> to sweet sauces for desserts, this measurement appears frequently.

<p>25g of Worcestershire sauce equals approximately 0.88 ounces. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements can make or break a dish. Whether you’re marinating chicken or adding a splash to a beef stir-fry, knowing how to convert grams to ounces ensures consistency. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we focus on making cooking conversions effortless, so you can focus on flavour.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on precise cooking times and ingredient ratios to deliver perfect results. Using too much or too little Worcestershire sauce can alter the taste and texture of your dish. For example, a recipe like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer glazed chicken</a> requires exact measurements to balance sweetness and umami. Converting 25g of Worcestershire sauce to ounces (0.88 oz) ensures your marinade or glaze is spot-on every time.</p>  

<p>Many UK cooks prefer using grams, while others work in ounces, especially when following international recipes. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> simplifies this process, so you never have to guess. Whether you’re preparing <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/beef>air fryer beef dishes</a> or experimenting with <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>roasted vegetables</a>, accurate conversions are key.</p>  

<h3>How to measure Worcestershire sauce without scales</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a kitchen scale, you can still measure 25g (0.88 oz) of Worcestershire sauce using tablespoons. One tablespoon holds roughly 15g (0.53 oz), so 1.5 tablespoons will get you close to 25g. For even more precision, use a measuring spoon set or a graduated liquid measure. This method works well for recipes like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>air fryer chicken wings</a>, where the sauce is a key ingredient.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for Worcestershire sauce in air fryer recipes</h2>  
<p>Worcestershire sauce adds depth to marinades, glazes, and even dry rubs. A 25g (0.88 oz) portion is often used in recipes like air fryer meatloaf or BBQ tofu. Its tangy, savoury flavour enhances dishes without overpowering them. For best results, combine it with other ingredients like soy sauce, honey, or garlic powder.</p>  

<p>Cleaning your air fryer after using sticky sauces like Worcestershire is crucial. Check out our guide on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>how to clean your air fryer</a> to keep it in top condition. Proper maintenance ensures your appliance lasts longer and performs at its best, whether you’re cooking meats, veggies, or desserts.</p>  

<h3>Converting other common sauce measurements</h3>  
<p>If you frequently cook with sauces, knowing conversions for 50g, 100g, or even 200g can save time. For instance, 50g of Worcestershire sauce equals 1.76 oz, while 100g is 3.53 oz.

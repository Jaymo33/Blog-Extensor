<h2>Why Convert 200g of Wholemeal Flour to Ounces?</h2>  
<p>Many UK bakers and air fryer enthusiasts prefer using ounces for measuring ingredients, especially when following older recipes or family traditions. Converting 200g of wholemeal flour to ounces ensures consistency and accuracy in your baking. Wholemeal flour, with its denser texture, requires precise measurements to avoid dry or crumbly results. If you’re experimenting with air fryer recipes, this conversion can help you adapt traditional oven recipes effortlessly.

<p>Using the correct weight ensures your dough or batter has the right consistency, whether you’re making bread, muffins, or air fryer cookies. Wholemeal flour absorbs more liquid than white flour, so measuring accurately is crucial. A kitchen scale is the best tool, but if you only have measuring cups, knowing the ounce equivalent of 200g helps.

<h3>How to Measure 200g of Wholemeal Flour Without a Scale</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a kitchen scale, you can still measure 200g of wholemeal flour using measuring cups. One cup of wholemeal flour weighs roughly 120g, so 200g is about 1 and 2/3 cups. However, this method isn’t as precise as weighing, so for best results, invest in a digital scale. Scooping flour directly from the bag can compact it, leading to inaccurate measurements.

<h3>Tips for Baking with Wholemeal Flour in an Air Fryer</h3>  
<p>Baking with wholemeal flour in an air fryer requires slight adjustments compared to traditional ovens. Reduce the temperature by 10-20°C to prevent over-browning, and check your food a few minutes early. Wholemeal flour can make baked goods denser, so consider adding a bit more liquid to the recipe. Preheating your air fryer ensures even cooking, just like an oven.

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter</h2>
<p>When cooking or baking, especially in an air fryer, precise measurements can make or break a recipe. Heavy cream is a common ingredient in dishes like sauces, soups, and desserts.

<h2>How to Measure 1.5 Cups of Heavy Cream</h2>
<p>Measuring heavy cream accurately is simple with the right tools. A liquid measuring cup is ideal for this task. Pour the cream into the cup until it reaches the 1.5-cup mark, which translates to 355 ml. If you don’t have a measuring cup, a kitchen scale can also help—1.5 cups of heavy cream weighs approximately 360 grams.</p>
<p>For air fryer recipes, precision is key. Too much or too little heavy cream can affect cooking times and results. If you're making a dessert like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>air fryer cheesecake</a>, 355 ml of heavy cream will ensure a rich, creamy texture. Always measure at eye level for accuracy.</p>

<h3>US vs UK Measurements</h3>
<p>It’s worth noting that US and UK cup measurements can differ slightly. In the UK, 1 cup is 284 ml, while in the US, it’s 240 ml. However, for heavy cream, the density is similar, so 1.5 cups will still be around 355 ml in both systems. Always double-check the recipe’s origin to avoid confusion.</p>

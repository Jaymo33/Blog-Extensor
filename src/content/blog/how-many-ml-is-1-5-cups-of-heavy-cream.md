<p>1.5 cups of heavy cream is equivalent to 355 ml. This conversion is essential for precise baking and cooking, especially when using an air fryer where measurements matter. Whether you're whipping up a dessert or a savoury dish, knowing the exact ml for 1.5 cups of heavy cream ensures consistency.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter</h2>
<p>When cooking or baking, especially in an air fryer, precise measurements can make or break a recipe. Heavy cream is a common ingredient in dishes like sauces, soups, and desserts. Using the correct amount ensures the right texture and flavour. For example, if you're making a creamy pasta sauce in your air fryer, 355 ml of heavy cream will give you the perfect consistency.</p>
<p>Many recipes on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> call for heavy cream, and knowing how to convert cups to ml is a game-changer. Whether you're following a British or American recipe, this conversion helps avoid guesswork. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more handy tips.</p>

<h2>How to Measure 1.5 Cups of Heavy Cream</h2>
<p>Measuring heavy cream accurately is simple with the right tools. A liquid measuring cup is ideal for this task. Pour the cream into the cup until it reaches the 1.5-cup mark, which translates to 355 ml. If you don’t have a measuring cup, a kitchen scale can also help—1.5 cups of heavy cream weighs approximately 360 grams.</p>
<p>For air fryer recipes, precision is key. Too much or too little heavy cream can affect cooking times and results. If you're making a dessert like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>air fryer cheesecake</a>, 355 ml of heavy cream will ensure a rich, creamy texture. Always measure at eye level for accuracy.</p>

<h3>US vs UK Measurements</h3>
<p>It’s worth noting that US and UK cup measurements can differ slightly. In the UK, 1 cup is 284 ml, while in the US, it’s 240 ml. However, for heavy cream, the density is similar, so 1.5 cups will still be around 355 ml in both systems. Always double-check the recipe’s origin to avoid confusion.</p>

<h2>Common Uses for 1.5 Cups of Heavy Cream</h2>
<p>Heavy cream is versatile and used in many dishes. From creamy pasta sauces to indulgent desserts, 355 ml of heavy cream can elevate your cooking. In the air fryer, it’s perfect for making rich sauces or even whipped cream for topping desserts. Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> for inspiration.</p>
<p>If you're preparing a savoury dish like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>air fryer chicken Alfredo</a>, 1.5 cups of heavy cream will give you a luscious sauce. For desserts, it’s ideal for custards or ice creams. Remember to store any leftover cream properly to maintain freshness.</p>

<h3>Tips for Working with Heavy Cream</h3>
<p>Heavy cream can be tricky to work with if not handled correctly. Always use cold cream for whipping, and avoid overmixing. When cooking in the air fryer, add the cream gradually to prevent curdling. For best results, follow recipes closely and measure accurately.</p>

<p>296 F converts to approximately 140 C in a fan oven. This temperature is ideal for slow roasting, baking delicate pastries, or cooking casseroles in both conventional ovens and air fryers. Understanding this conversion helps achieve consistent results when switching between appliances.</p>

<h2>Why Convert 296 F to Fan Oven?</h2>
<p>Fan ovens circulate hot air for even cooking, requiring lower temperatures than conventional ovens. When your recipe calls for 296 F, using 140 C in a fan oven prevents overcooking. This is particularly important for air fryers, which essentially function as compact fan ovens. Many <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> originally designed for conventional ovens need accurate temperature adjustments.</p>
<p>The 296 F to fan oven conversion becomes essential when preparing dishes like roasted vegetables or baked goods. At 140 C fan, foods develop perfect texture without drying out.

<p>1.66 cups of buttermilk equals approximately 13.28 ounces. This conversion is essential for anyone using buttermilk in recipes, especially when preparing dishes in an air fryer. Precise measurements ensure your baked goods or marinades turn out perfectly every time. Whether you're following a recipe from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> or experimenting with your own creations, knowing this conversion will save you time and hassle.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate buttermilk measurements matter</h2>  
<p>Buttermilk is a key ingredient in many recipes, from fluffy pancakes to tender fried chicken. Using the right amount ensures the right texture and flavour. Too little, and your dish might be dry; too much, and it could become soggy. For air fryer recipes, especially those involving batters or coatings, precision is crucial. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more handy measurement tips.</p>  

<p>Buttermilk’s acidity also plays a role in baking, activating baking soda for the perfect rise. If you’re scaling a recipe up or down, knowing how to convert cups to ounces helps maintain balance. Whether you’re making a classic buttermilk cake or marinating chicken for the air fryer, 1.66 cups (13.28 ounces) is a measurement you’ll want to get right.</p>  

<h3>How to measure buttermilk correctly</h3>  
<p>For the most accurate results, use a liquid measuring cup for buttermilk. Fill it to the 1.66-cup mark, or weigh it on a kitchen scale for 13.28 ounces. If you don’t have a scale, remember that 1 cup of buttermilk equals 8 ounces, so 1.66 cups is just over 13 ounces. This method works for all <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> requiring buttermilk.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for 1.66 cups of buttermilk</h2>  
<p>This measurement often appears in recipes for small batches of baked goods or marinades. For example, you might use 1.66 cups of buttermilk for a single-layer cake or to marinate chicken wings before air frying. It’s also a handy amount for making pancakes or waffles for a family breakfast. Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>cake recipes</a> to put your buttermilk to good use.</p>  

<p>Buttermilk’s tangy flavour and tenderising properties make it ideal for fried foods, too. If you’re coating chicken or fish for the air fryer, a buttermilk soak ensures a crispy exterior and juicy interior. With 1.66 cups (13.28 ounces), you’ll have enough for a small batch without waste.

<h3>Substitutes if you’re out of buttermilk</h3>  
<p>No buttermilk? Mix 1.66 cups of milk with 1.5 tablespoons of lemon juice or vinegar and let it sit for 5 minutes. This creates a similar acidity and texture. Alternatively, use plain yoghurt thinned with a little water. These swaps work well in air fryer recipes, though the flavour may vary slightly.</p>  

<h2>Converting other buttermilk measurements</h2>  
<p>If your recipe calls for a different amount, here’s a quick reference: 1 cup = 8 ounces, ½ cup = 4 ounces, and ¼ cup = 2 ounces. For larger quantities, 2 cups equal 16 ounces. Bookmark our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a> for easy access. Whether you’re scaling up or down, these conversions ensure consistency in your cooking.</p>  

<p>Remember, air fryer recipes often require precise measurements for best results. If you’re adapting a traditional recipe for the air fryer, double-check your conversions. Too much liquid can affect cooking times and textures. With 1.66 cups of buttermilk equalling 13.28 ounces, you’re set for success.</p>

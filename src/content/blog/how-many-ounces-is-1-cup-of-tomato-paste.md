<p>1 cup of tomato paste equals approximately 8 ounces. This measurement is key for air fryer recipes, ensuring your dishes have the right consistency and flavour. Whether you're making a rich pasta sauce or a marinade for chicken, knowing this conversion helps streamline your cooking process. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we focus on precise measurements to elevate your air fryer meals.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Using the correct amount of tomato paste ensures your recipes turn out as intended. Too much can overpower a dish, while too little might leave it lacking depth. For air fryer cooking, where ingredients cook quickly, precision is even more critical. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for other handy measurement swaps. Tomato paste is a staple in many cuisines, so getting it right makes all the difference.</p>  

<p>Tomato paste is concentrated, so even small variations can affect taste and texture. If you're adapting a recipe from volume to weight, 8 ounces per cup is the standard. This is especially useful for batch cooking or meal prep, where consistency matters.

<h3>Converting Tomato Paste for UK Cooks</h3>  
<p>In the UK, recipes might use grams or millilitres instead of cups. 1 cup of tomato paste (8 ounces) translates to roughly 227 grams. If your recipe calls for millilitres, it's about 240 ml. Always use a kitchen scale for the most accurate results, especially when baking or making sauces. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable recipes</a> often feature tomato paste, so keep this conversion handy.</p>  

<h2>Tips for Measuring Tomato Paste</h2>  
<p>For sticky ingredients like tomato paste, lightly oil your measuring cup or spoon for easy release. Alternatively, use a spatula to scrape out every bit. If you're using canned tomato paste, remember that a standard small can holds about 6 ounces—just under a cup. Leftover paste can be frozen in tablespoon portions for future use.

<p>Tomato paste adds umami and richness to dishes like stews, curries, and even air-fried meats. If you're substituting fresh tomatoes, use 1 cup of paste for about 3 cups of pureed tomatoes. This ratio ensures the right intensity of flavour.

<h3>Common Mistakes to Avoid</h3>  
<p>Don't confuse tomato paste with tomato sauce or puree, as their consistencies differ. Paste is thicker and more concentrated, so substitutions require adjustments. Always check the label if you're using a UK brand, as some might list weights differently. And remember, a heaped cup isn't the same as a level cup—precision matters!</p>

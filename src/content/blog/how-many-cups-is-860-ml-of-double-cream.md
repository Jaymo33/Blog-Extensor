<h2>Common Mistakes When Measuring Double Cream</h2>
<p>One common mistake is using dry measuring cups for liquids like double cream. Dry cups can’t account for the cream’s viscosity, leading to inaccurate measurements. Always use a liquid measuring jug for 860 ml of double cream to ensure you get the correct 3.6 cups. This small step can make a big difference in your air fryer cooking.</p>

<p>Another error is not accounting for the cream’s temperature. Cold double cream is thicker and may not pour evenly, affecting your measurement. Let it sit at room temperature for a few minutes before measuring for accuracy. This tip is especially useful when preparing air fryer desserts or sauces.

<h3>Storing Leftover Double Cream</h3>
<p>If you have leftover 860 ml of double cream, store it in an airtight container in the fridge. It typically lasts up to five days, but always check for spoilage before use. You can also freeze it for longer storage, though the texture may change slightly. Thawed cream works well in cooked dishes or baking, making it a versatile ingredient for your air fryer creations.</p>

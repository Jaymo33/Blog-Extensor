<p>50 grams of cocoa powder equals approximately 0.42 cups in the UK and 0.5 cups in the US. This conversion is essential for baking, especially when using an air fryer for cakes or desserts. Getting the measurement right ensures your recipes turn out perfectly every time.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Cocoa Powder Measurements Matter</h2>

<h3>UK vs. US Cup Measurements</h3>  
<p>In the UK, 50 grams of cocoa powder equals roughly 0.42 cups, while in the US, it’s closer to 0.5 cups. This difference arises because UK and US cups aren’t the same size. Always check which measurement system your recipe uses to avoid mistakes.</p>

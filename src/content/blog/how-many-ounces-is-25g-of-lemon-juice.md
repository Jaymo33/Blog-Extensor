<p>25g of lemon juice equals approximately 0.88 ounces. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements can make all the difference. Whether you’re marinating chicken or adding zest to desserts, knowing how to convert grams to ounces ensures perfect results every time. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we help you nail those measurements for flawless cooking. Let’s dive deeper into why this matters and how to measure lemon juice like a pro.</p>

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>
<p>Air fryers rely on precise cooking times and ingredient ratios to deliver crispy, evenly cooked dishes. Too much or too little lemon juice can alter the texture and flavour of your meal. For example, marinating chicken with 25g of lemon juice (0.88 ounces) ensures the right balance of acidity without overpowering the dish. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> simplifies these calculations for you. Accurate measurements also prevent waste, helping you use ingredients efficiently.</p>
<p>Lemon juice is a common ingredient in air fryer recipes, from glazes to dressings. Whether you’re cooking <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken</a> or baking desserts, 25g of lemon juice (0.88 ounces) is a handy measurement to remember. Unlike bulkier ingredients, liquids like lemon juice require careful measuring to avoid soggy or overly tart results. Investing in a good kitchen scale or measuring spoons can save you from recipe mishaps. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a> for more inspiration.</p>

<h2>How to measure 25g of lemon juice accurately</h2>
<p>Measuring lemon juice by weight (25g) is more precise than using volume (ounces or millilitres), as it accounts for variations in juiciness. To measure 25g of lemon juice, use a digital kitchen scale for the best accuracy. Alternatively, 25g is roughly equivalent to 1.5 tablespoons or 0.88 ounces. Freshly squeezed lemon juice is ideal, but bottled works in a pinch—just check for additives. For more tips on perfecting your air fryer meals, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning guide</a> to keep your appliance in top shape.</p>

<h3>Tools for measuring lemon juice</h3>
<p>A digital kitchen scale is the most reliable tool for measuring 25g of lemon juice. If you don’t have one, use a liquid measuring cup marked in ounces or millilitres. Remember, 25g converts to 0.88 ounces, so fill to just under the 1-ounce line. For small quantities, measuring spoons are handy—1.5 tablespoons will get you close to 25g. Always level off your measurements for consistency.</p>

<h2>Common recipes using 25g of lemon juice</h2>
<p>Many air fryer recipes call for 25g of lemon juice, from marinades to sauces. For example, a lemon-garlic marinade for <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/shrimp>shrimp</a> might use 25g (0.88 ounces) of juice for a bright, tangy flavour. Lemon drizzle cakes or glazes for desserts also benefit from this precise measurement. Whether you’re cooking savoury or sweet, 25g of lemon juice adds the perfect zing. Experiment with our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipes</a> to see how this measurement works in practice.</p>

<h3>Adjusting recipes for personal taste</h3>
<p>While 25g of lemon juice (0.88 ounces) is a standard measurement, you can tweak it to suit your palate. If you prefer a milder flavour, reduce the amount slightly. For extra tang, add a few more grams—just balance it with other ingredients. The air fryer’s intense heat can amplify acidity, so start with 25g and adjust as needed. Always taste your marinades or dressings before cooking.</p>

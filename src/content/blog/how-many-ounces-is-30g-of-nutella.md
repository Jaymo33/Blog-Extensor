<p>30g of Nutella equals approximately 1.06 ounces. Whether you're using an air fryer to bake brownies or drizzle Nutella over desserts, getting the measurements right is key. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we know how crucial accuracy is for perfect results. This guide will help you convert 30g of Nutella to ounces effortlessly.</p>  

<h2>Why Convert 30g of Nutella to Ounces?</h2>  
<p>Many UK recipes use grams, but some kitchen scales or international recipes might list ingredients in ounces. Converting 30g of Nutella to ounces ensures consistency, especially when using an air fryer. Air fryers require precise measurements for even cooking, and Nutella’s thickness means small differences can affect texture. Whether you're making <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>desserts</a> or breakfast treats, knowing the exact weight helps.</p>  

<p>Nutella’s rich, creamy texture means 30g is roughly two tablespoons, but weighing it guarantees accuracy. If you’re adapting a recipe from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>our conversion chart</a>, this measurement ensures your dish turns out perfectly. No more guessing or messy spills—just precise, delicious results every time.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure 30g of Nutella Without Scales</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have scales, use tablespoons to measure 30g of Nutella. One heaped tablespoon is about 15g, so two tablespoons equal roughly 30g (1.06 oz). For sticky ingredients like Nutella, lightly grease the spoon for easier release. This method works well for air fryer recipes like Nutella-stuffed pastries or <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>quick desserts</a>.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for 30g of Nutella in Air Fryers</h2>  
<p>30g of Nutella is perfect for drizzling over air-fried bananas or filling crepes. It’s also ideal for baking small batches of brownies or cookies in your air fryer. Since air fryers cook faster than ovens, precise measurements prevent over- or undercooking.

<h3>Converting Other Nutella Weights to Ounces</h3>

<p>15g of icing sugar equals approximately 0.53 ounces. This conversion is essential for bakers and home cooks who need precise measurements, especially when using an air fryer for delicate desserts. Whether you’re dusting a cake or making air fryer cookies, knowing how to convert grams to ounces ensures perfect results every time.</p>  

<h2>Why Convert 15g of Icing Sugar to Ounces?</h2>  
<p>Many UK recipes use grams, while others rely on ounces, making conversions a common kitchen task. If you’re following an international recipe or using an older cookbook, you might need to convert 15g icing sugar to ounces. Air fryer recipes, like those on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, often require precise measurements for best results.</p>  
<p>Using the correct amount of icing sugar ensures your desserts aren’t too sweet or too bland. A slight miscalculation can affect texture, especially in air fryer baking. For more conversion tips, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>  

<h2>How to Measure 15g of Icing Sugar Accurately</h2>  
<p>The easiest way to measure 15g of icing sugar is with a digital kitchen scale. Simply set it to grams, spoon the sugar into your bowl, and stop at 15g. If you don’t have a scale, you can use a measuring spoon, but this method is less precise.</p>  
<p>For air fryer recipes, accuracy is key. Too much sugar can cause sticking or uneven cooking. If you’re making air fryer cakes or cookies, always sift your icing sugar first to avoid lumps. Explore more <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>cake recipes</a> for inspiration.</p>  

<h3>Common Uses for 15g of Icing Sugar</h3>  
<p>15g of icing sugar is often used for dusting desserts, glazing pastries, or sweetening frostings. In air fryer cooking, it’s perfect for light coatings on doughnuts or finishing touches on baked fruit. A little goes a long way!</p>  

<h2>Converting Other Sugar Measurements</h2>  
<p>If you need to convert other amounts, remember that 1 ounce equals roughly 28.35 grams. So, 30g of icing sugar would be about 1.06 ounces. This rule applies to all types of sugar, making it handy for various recipes.</p>  
<p>Air fryer desserts often require small quantities, so knowing these conversions helps avoid waste. For more baking tips, visit <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>.</p>  

<h3>Tips for Storing Icing Sugar</h3>  
<p>Keep icing sugar in an airtight container to prevent clumping. Humidity can affect its texture, so store it in a cool, dry place. If your sugar hardens, simply sift it before use.</p>

<p>20g of plain yogurt equals approximately 0.7 ounces. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements can impact texture and taste. Whether you’re whipping up a breakfast dish or a dessert, knowing how to convert grams to ounces ensures consistency. For more air fryer conversions, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on precise ingredient quantities to deliver perfect results. Too much or too little yogurt can affect moisture levels, especially in cakes or marinades. For example, a <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>cake recipe</a> might call for 20g of yogurt to keep it light and fluffy. Measuring correctly ensures your dish turns out as intended. It’s also helpful when scaling recipes up or down for meal prep.</p>  

<p>Using a kitchen scale is the most accurate way to measure 20g of plain yogurt. If you don’t have one, remember that 1 tablespoon of yogurt is roughly 15g, so 20g is just over 1 tablespoon. For more tips on air fryer cooking, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a>.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure 20g of Plain Yogurt Without a Scale</h3>  
<p>If you’re without a scale, use a measuring spoon to approximate 20g of plain yogurt. A level tablespoon holds about 15g, so you’ll need slightly more than one. Stir the yogurt first to ensure an even consistency, as thicker yogurts may settle. This method works well for recipes like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/breakfast>breakfast bowls</a> or marinades where precision isn’t critical.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for 20g of Plain Yogurt in Air Fryer Recipes</h2>  
<p>Plain yogurt is a versatile ingredient in air fryer cooking. It’s often used in marinades for chicken or lamb to tenderise the meat. A 20g portion is perfect for coating small batches, like two chicken breasts. Yogurt also adds moisture to baked goods, such as muffins or <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>desserts</a>, without making them soggy.</p>  

<p>For a quick snack, mix 20g of yogurt with spices to create a dip for air-fried vegetables. It’s also a great base for healthier sauces, replacing mayo or cream. After cooking, don’t forget to clean your air fryer with our recommended <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning products</a> to maintain its performance.</p>  

<h3>Converting Other Yogurt Quantities to Ounces</h3>  
<p>If your recipe calls for more or less yogurt, here’s a quick reference: 50g is about 1.76 ounces, and 100g equals 3.53 ounces. These conversions are handy for larger batches or meal prep. Always check whether your recipe uses UK or US measurements, as ounce sizes can vary slightly.</p>

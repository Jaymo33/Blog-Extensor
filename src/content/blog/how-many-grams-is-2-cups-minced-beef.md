<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on hot air circulation to cook food evenly, so ingredient quantities directly impact cooking times and textures. Using 2.0 cups of minced beef without converting to grams could lead to undercooked or overcrowded results. For example, 450 grams of minced beef fits perfectly in most air fryer baskets, allowing optimal airflow. If you're new to air frying, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a> simplifies measurements for all ingredients.</p>  

<p>Recipes often list minced beef in grams because weight is more consistent than volume. A packed cup of minced beef weighs more than a loosely filled one, which is why weighing ensures reliability. For dishes like air-fryer meatloaf or stuffed peppers, 450 grams of minced beef provides the ideal portion.

<h3>Common Mistakes When Measuring Minced Beef</h3>  
<p>Avoid pressing minced beef into the cup, as this compacts it and skews the weight. Similarly, don’t eyeball it—differences in density can lead to uneven cooking. Always use standard measuring cups (not mugs or teacups) for accuracy.

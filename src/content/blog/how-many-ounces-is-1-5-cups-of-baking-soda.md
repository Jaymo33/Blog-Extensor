<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of baking soda can make or break your air fryer recipes. Too little, and your baked goods won’t rise properly. Too much, and you might end up with a bitter taste.

<h3>How to Measure Baking Soda Correctly</h3>  
<p>For the most accurate results, use a kitchen scale to weigh 1.5 cups of baking soda in ounces (12 oz).

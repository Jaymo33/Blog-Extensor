<p>0.25 cup of onion equals approximately 1 ounce (28 grams). This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precision ensures even cooking and perfect results. Whether you're preparing a stir-fry, soup, or a delicious air-fried onion topping, knowing this measurement helps avoid guesswork.</p>

<h2>Why accurate onion measurements matter</h2>  
<p>Using the correct amount of onion ensures your dish has the right balance of flavour. Too much onion can overpower other ingredients, while too little might leave your meal tasting bland. In air fryer cooking, precise measurements also affect texture—onions cook quickly, so getting the quantity right prevents burning or uneven results. For more air fryer tips, visit <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>our conversion chart</a>.</p>  

<p>Recipes often list onions by volume (cups) or weight (ounces). If you're scaling a recipe up or down, converting 0.25 cup of onion to ounces ensures consistency. This is especially useful for meal prepping or batch cooking, where exact proportions matter. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a> for inspiration.</p>  

<h3>How to measure 0.25 cup of onion</h3>  
<p>For the most accurate measurement, use a kitchen scale to weigh 1 ounce of chopped onion. If you don’t have a scale, lightly pack the onion into a measuring cup without compressing it. Remember, finely diced onions will settle more densely than roughly chopped ones, so adjust accordingly. For perfectly cooked onions every time, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable recipes</a>.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for 0.25 cup of onion</h2>  
<p>This small but mighty amount of onion works well in omelettes, sauces, and as a garnish for air-fried dishes. It’s also ideal for adding subtle flavour to marinades or dressings without overwhelming other ingredients. If you're cooking for one or two, 0.25 cup (1 ounce) of onion is often the perfect quantity.</p>  

<p>Many air fryer recipes, like stuffed peppers or kebabs, call for small amounts of onion. Knowing that 0.25 cup equals 1 ounce helps you adapt recipes effortlessly. For more ideas on using onions in your air fryer, browse our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/beef>beef recipes</a>, where onions often play a supporting role.</p>  

<h3>Converting other onion measurements</h3>  
<p>If your recipe calls for a different amount, here’s a quick reference: 1 cup of chopped onion equals about 4 ounces, while 1 tablespoon is roughly 0.25 ounce. These conversions are handy when adjusting portion sizes or substituting ingredients. Keep our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning guide</a> handy to maintain your air fryer after cooking onion-heavy dishes.</p>

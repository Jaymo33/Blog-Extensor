<p>85 ml of single cream is approximately 0.36 cups (just over 1/3 cup). This conversion is essential for precise baking and cooking, especially when using an air fryer where measurements matter. Whether you're whipping up a creamy sauce or a decadent dessert, knowing how to convert millilitres to cups ensures your recipes turn out perfectly every time.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of single cream can make or break your dish. Too little, and your sauce might be too thick; too much, and it could become runny. Air fryers cook food quickly, so precise measurements help maintain the right texture and consistency. For more air fryer tips, check out <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>our conversion chart</a> to simplify your cooking process.</p>  

<p>Single cream is a staple in many recipes, from soups to desserts. If you're using an air fryer for baking, knowing that 85 ml equals roughly 0.36 cups ensures your cakes and custards come out just right. Visit <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>our recipe collection</a> for delicious ideas that make the most of your air fryer.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure 85 ml of Single Cream Without a Measuring Cup</h3>  
<p>If you don't have a measuring cup, you can use a kitchen scale. Since 1 ml of single cream weighs roughly 1 gram, 85 ml would be about 85 grams. Alternatively, use tablespoons—one tablespoon is about 15 ml, so 85 ml is roughly 5.5 tablespoons. For more handy measurement tips, explore <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>our dessert recipes</a> where precision is key.</p>  

<h2>Converting 85 ml of Single Cream for Different Recipes</h2>  
<p>Different recipes may call for slight adjustments. For example, if you're making a creamy pasta sauce in your air fryer, you might need to tweak the quantity based on other ingredients. Always refer to trusted recipes like those on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> for the best results.</p>  

<p>When baking, even small measurement errors can affect texture. If a recipe calls for 85 ml of single cream, stick to 0.36 cups for accuracy. For more baking tips, check out <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>our cake recipes</a> designed for air fryers.</p>  

<h3>Common Mistakes When Measuring Single Cream</h3>  
<p>One mistake is using a liquid measuring cup for thick creams, which can lead to inaccurate readings. Always spoon single cream into the cup and level it off. Another error is confusing double cream with single cream—they have different fat contents and behave differently in recipes.</p>  

<h2>Best Uses for 85 ml of Single Cream in an Air Fryer</h2>  
<p>Single cream works wonderfully in air fryer desserts like custards or creamy fillings. It’s also great for adding richness to sauces without making them too heavy. For savoury dishes, try it in creamy pasta bakes or mashed potatoes.</p>  

<p>If you're experimenting with new recipes, always measure carefully. A little goes a long way with single cream, so 85 ml (0.36 cups) is often enough for small batches.

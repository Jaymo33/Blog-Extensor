<p>1.33 cups of ground coriander equals approximately 3.2 ounces (or 3.2 oz) in UK measurements. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise seasoning makes all the difference. Whether you’re making spiced chicken or vegetable dishes, getting the coriander measurement right ensures balanced flavours. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we know how crucial accurate conversions are for perfect results.</p>

<h2>Why accurate coriander measurements matter</h2>
<p>Ground coriander adds depth to air fryer dishes, but too much or too little can throw off your recipe. 1.33 cups of ground coriander to ounces is a common conversion needed for batch cooking or scaling recipes. Unlike liquid ingredients, spices like coriander settle differently in cups, making weight measurements more reliable. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> helps eliminate guesswork for all your cooking needs.</p>

<p>When preparing air fryer meals, especially <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipes</a>, the right amount of ground coriander enhances flavour without overpowering. 3.2 ounces (from 1.33 cups) balances well in marinades or dry rubs. Remember that freshly ground coriander may weigh slightly less than pre-ground due to air pockets, so always check your measurements twice.</p>

<h3>How to measure 1.33 cups of ground coriander</h3>
<p>For the most accurate 1.33 cups ground coriander to oz conversion, use proper measuring tools. Spoon the coriander into a dry measuring cup without packing it down, then level it off with a straight edge. If you have kitchen scales, weigh out 3.2 ounces directly for precision. This method works perfectly for our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> requiring specific spice quantities.</p>

<h2>Converting other coriander quantities</h2>
<p>Once you know 1.33 cups equals 3.2 ounces, you can easily adjust other measurements. Half (0.665 cups) would be 1.6 ounces, while double (2.66 cups) becomes 6.4 ounces. These conversions help when adapting recipes from American sources that use cups to UK measurements in ounces. Bookmark our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a> for quick reference during meal prep.</p>

<p>For larger batches, like when meal prepping <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable dishes</a>, knowing these conversions saves time. Ground coriander’s weight can vary slightly by brand, so when precision matters (like in spice blends), weighing is best. Keep your air fryer performing at its peak by regularly using our recommended <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning products</a> to maintain flavour purity.</p>

<h3>Common recipes using 1.33 cups ground coriander</h3>
<p>While 1.33 cups (3.2 ounces) of ground coriander might seem like a large quantity, it’s perfect for making spice mixes or cooking for crowds. This amount works well in big batches of air fryer-friendly falafel, curry powders, or marinades for 4-6 people. The earthy, citrusy notes of coriander pair beautifully with chicken, fish, and vegetables in the air fryer.</p>

<p>0.5 tbsp of plain flour equals approximately 4 grams. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements can make or break your dish. Whether you're baking air fryer cookies or coating chicken, knowing the exact weight ensures consistent results every time.</p>

<h2>Why accurate flour measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>
<p>Air fryers cook food quickly and evenly, but they rely on precise ingredient ratios for the best results. Using too much or too little flour can affect texture, browning, and even cooking times. For example, when making <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer chicken tenders</a>, the right amount of flour creates the perfect crispy coating without becoming soggy.</p>
<p>Many UK bakers prefer weighing ingredients rather than using volume measurements like tablespoons. This is because flour can settle or be packed differently in a spoon, leading to inconsistent amounts. By converting 0.5 tbsp to grams, you eliminate this variability for more reliable outcomes in your <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversions</a>.</p>

<h2>How to measure 0.5 tbsp of plain flour accurately</h2>
<p>For the most precise measurement, use digital kitchen scales set to grams. Simply spoon flour into your tablespoon without packing it down, then level off the excess with a straight edge. Remember that 0.5 tbsp is half of a standard UK tablespoon measurement.</p>

<h3>Common uses for 0.5 tbsp of plain flour in air fryer recipes</h3>
<p>This small quantity of flour often appears in recipes as a thickener or coating. You might use it when making <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>air fryer cakes</a> for dusting pans, or in batters for tempura vegetables. It's also perfect for light coatings on fish or chicken before air frying.</p>

<h2>Converting other flour measurements to grams</h2>
<p>If your recipe calls for different amounts, here are some useful conversions: 1 tbsp of plain flour equals about 8 grams, while 1 teaspoon is roughly 3 grams. These measurements apply to standard UK plain flour - other types like self-raising or wholemeal may vary slightly in weight.</p>
<p>For larger batches, remember that 100g of plain flour equals approximately 12.5 tablespoons. You can find more comprehensive conversion guides at <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, including specific measurements for all your favourite air fryer ingredients.</p>

<h3>Tips for working with small flour quantities in air fryers</h3>
<p>When measuring tiny amounts like 0.5 tbsp, use a dedicated measuring spoon set for accuracy. For sticky batters, try dusting your air fryer basket with a small amount of flour to prevent sticking - just remember to account for this in your total measurement.</p>

<h2>Frequently asked measurement questions</h2>
<p>Many home cooks wonder if they can substitute other ingredients when they're short on flour. While possible in some recipes, substitutions can affect texture and cooking times in air fryers.

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Getting the right amount of chicken breast ensures even cooking in your air fryer. Too much can lead to overcrowding, while too little might dry out.

<p>Using cups for measurement is common in the UK and USA, but weight (grams) is often more accurate.

A kitchen scale is your best friend here!</p>  

<h3>How to Measure 275 Grams of Chicken Breast</h3>  
<p>Start by dicing or shredding the chicken breast for consistent cup measurements. Pack it lightly into a measuring cup without pressing down too hard.

<h2>Cooking 275 Grams of Chicken Breast in an Air Fryer</h2>

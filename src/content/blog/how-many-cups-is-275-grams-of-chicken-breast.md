<p>275 grams of chicken breast equals approximately 1.5 cups when diced or shredded. This conversion helps ensure accurate portioning for air fryer recipes, whether you're meal prepping or cooking a single serving. If you're using our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>, you'll find this measurement handy for consistent results.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Getting the right amount of chicken breast ensures even cooking in your air fryer. Too much can lead to overcrowding, while too little might dry out. For <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipes</a>, precision helps achieve that perfect juicy texture. Whether you're baking, grilling, or air frying, 275 grams translates to roughly 1.5 cups—ideal for two servings.</p>  

<p>Using cups for measurement is common in the UK and USA, but weight (grams) is often more accurate. If you're following a recipe from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>our collection</a>, check whether it uses weight or volume to avoid mistakes. A kitchen scale is your best friend here!</p>  

<h3>How to Measure 275 Grams of Chicken Breast</h3>  
<p>Start by dicing or shredding the chicken breast for consistent cup measurements. Pack it lightly into a measuring cup without pressing down too hard. For 275 grams, you'll fill the cup halfway a third time. This method works well for most <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/meal-prep>meal prep</a> needs.</p>  

<h2>Cooking 275 Grams of Chicken Breast in an Air Fryer</h2>  
<p>Once you've measured your 275 grams (1.5 cups) of chicken breast, preheat your air fryer to 180°C. Cook for 12–15 minutes, flipping halfway, until the internal temperature reaches 75°C. This ensures safety without overcooking. For crispy results, pat the chicken dry before seasoning.</p>  

<p>If you're batch-cooking, avoid stacking to ensure even airflow. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning guide</a> can help maintain your air fryer after cooking chicken. Remember, 275 grams fits nicely in most standard air fryer baskets without overcrowding.</p>  

<h3>Recipe Ideas for 275 Grams of Chicken Breast</h3>  
<p>This portion is perfect for stir-fries, salads, or wraps. Try marinating your 1.5 cups of chicken in yoghurt and spices before air frying for tender results. You could also bread it for a crispy coating—just adjust cooking time by 2–3 minutes.</p>

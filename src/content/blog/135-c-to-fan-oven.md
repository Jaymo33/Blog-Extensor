<h2>Understanding 135 C in Fan Ovens</h2>
<p>135 C converts directly to 135 C in a fan oven - no adjustment needed. Fan ovens circulate hot air evenly, meaning the set temperature matches the actual cooking temperature precisely. This differs from conventional ovens where you'd typically reduce temperatures by 20 C. When using an air fryer, which works similarly to a fan oven, you can trust the 135 C setting to deliver consistent results. Many recipes at <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> use this temperature for delicate baking. It's ideal for drying herbs, slow-cooking meats, or making perfect meringues.</p>

<p>The 135 C fan oven setting is particularly useful for dishes requiring gentle heat. Unlike higher temperatures that might burn edges, 135 C ensures even cooking throughout. This makes it excellent for batch cooking or meal prep sessions. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> shows how this compares to other cooking methods. Remember that cooking times may vary slightly between different air fryer models, so always check food at the minimum recommended time.</p>

<h3>Why 135 C Works So Well in Air Fryers</h3>
<p>Air fryers excel at 135 C because their rapid air circulation mimics professional convection ovens. This temperature prevents scorching while thoroughly cooking ingredients. It's perfect for dehydrating fruits or making jerky where low, steady heat is crucial. The compact size of air fryers means 135 C heats the chamber more efficiently than larger ovens. You'll find this temperature used in many <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert recipes</a> for achieving that perfect texture without overbrowning.</p>

<h2>Converting 135 C for Different Cooking Methods</h2>
<p>While 135 C stays the same in fan ovens and air fryers, other appliances require adjustments. Gas mark settings would be approximately mark 1 for 135 C, though gas ovens often lack this precision. Microwave convection modes should also use 135 C directly. For traditional electric ovens without fans, you'd normally set 155 C to achieve similar results to 135 C in a fan oven. These conversions are particularly helpful when adapting recipes from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>our recipe collection</a> for different kitchen setups.</p>

<p>When baking at 135 C in an air fryer, consider using liner papers or silicone mats. These prevent small items from being blown around by the powerful fan. Our guide on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaning</a> shows how to maintain your appliance after low-temperature cooking. The 135 C setting is also brilliant for reheating delicate pastries without drying them out. Just remember to reduce standard cooking times by about 20% when using an air fryer compared to conventional oven instructions.</p>

<h3>Best Foods to Cook at 135 C</h3>
<p>Several dishes shine when cooked at 135 C in a fan oven or air fryer. Slow-roasted tomatoes develop incredible sweetness at this temperature over 2-3 hours. Cheesecakes benefit from the gentle heat that prevents cracking in the surface. For meat lovers, 135 C is ideal for rendering fat in duck or pork belly without shrinking. Many <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable recipes</a> use this temperature to preserve nutrients while achieving perfect tenderness. It's also the secret temperature for reviving stale bread - just 5-10 minutes can work wonders.</p>

<h2>Temperature Accuracy and Calibration</h2>
<p>While 135 C should be consistent across fan ovens and air fryers, appliance accuracy varies. Older ovens may run hot or cold, so an oven thermometer helps verify temperatures. Most modern air fryers maintain precise 135 C settings thanks to digital thermostats. If your food consistently cooks faster or slower than expected at 135 C, your appliance might need recalibration. The compact cooking chamber of air fryers means they often reach and maintain 135 C more reliably than full-sized ovens.</p>

<p>When cooking multiple batches at 135 C, allow the air fryer to reheat between loads. The small capacity means temperature drops faster when adding cold food. For best results, preheat your air fryer for 3-5 minutes before cooking at 135 C. This ensures even cooking from the start, especially important for delicate items like souffl√©s or custards. Many air fryer models have specific presets that include 135 C for optimal results with certain food types.</p>

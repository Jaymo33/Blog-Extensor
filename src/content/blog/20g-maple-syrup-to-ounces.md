<p>20g of maple syrup equals approximately 0.71 ounces. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements can make or break your dish. Whether you’re drizzling it over air-fried pancakes or using it as a glaze for salmon, knowing how many ounces is 20g of maple syrup ensures perfect results every time.</p>

<h2>Why accurate maple syrup measurements matter</h2>  
<p>Maple syrup is a sticky, dense liquid where small weight differences can significantly impact your recipe’s sweetness and texture. In air fryer cooking, where heat circulates rapidly, overly sweet glazes can burn while too little syrup might leave dishes tasting bland. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> helps eliminate guesswork for consistent outcomes.</p>  
<p>British recipes often use grams, while some older cookbooks reference ounces. When adapting <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> across measurement systems, this 20g maple syrup to ounces conversion (0.71 oz) becomes invaluable. For context, 1 UK fluid ounce of maple syrup weighs about 28g – but weight ounces (used here) differ slightly from fluid ounces.</p>  

<h3>Tools for measuring maple syrup</h3>  
<p>Digital kitchen scales are ideal for weighing 20g of maple syrup directly. If using measuring spoons, note that 1 tablespoon equals roughly 20g (0.71 oz), but viscosity varies with temperature. For sticky ingredients like maple syrup, lightly greasing your measuring spoon or cup prevents waste and ensures accuracy.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for 20g maple syrup in air fryers</h2>  
<p>This small-but-mighty quantity shines in glazes for <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>air fryer chicken</a> or roasted vegetables. It’s also perfect for sweetening a single serving of air-fried fruit or drizzling over warm desserts. At 0.71 ounces, 20g adds subtle sweetness without overpowering – ideal for balanced flavours.</p>  
<p>When substituting other sweeteners, remember honey is denser (21g per tablespoon) while agave is lighter (18g). Always adjust cooking times slightly when using syrups in air fryers, as sugars caramelise quickly under intense heat. Keep a <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner</a> handy to tackle any sticky spills promptly.</p>  

<h3>Converting larger batches</h3>  
<p>Need to scale up? Multiply accordingly: 40g = 1.41 oz, 100g = 3.53 oz.

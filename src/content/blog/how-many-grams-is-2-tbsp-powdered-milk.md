<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on even heat distribution, so ingredient ratios must be spot-on. Too much or too little powdered milk can affect browning, moisture, and rise in baked goods. For example, adding extra powdered milk to a cake batter might make it denser. On the flip side, skimping could leave your dish dry. That’s why converting 2 tbsp powdered milk to grams (14g) is a game-changer for consistency.</p>  

<p>Many air fryer recipes, like our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>popular dessert collection</a>, call for powdered milk for richness. Whether you're making custards or breading for fried chicken, precise measurements ensure reliable results every time. A digital kitchen scale is your best friend here—skip the guesswork and measure directly in grams.</p>  

<h3>How to measure powdered milk without a scale</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a scale, use the spoon-and-level method for 2 tbsp powdered milk. Fluff the powder first, then spoon it into a measuring tablespoon without packing it down. Level off the excess with a straight edge for an accurate 14-gram equivalent. This method works well for most <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert recipes</a> where precision matters.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for powdered milk in air fryer recipes</h2>

<h3>Does brand affect the weight of powdered milk?</h3>  
<p>Most powdered milk brands have similar densities, so 2 tbsp should still weigh around 14 grams. However, if your brand is particularly fine or clumpy, it’s worth double-checking with a scale. For best results, stick to the same brand once you’ve nailed a recipe. Need to clean your air fryer after testing?

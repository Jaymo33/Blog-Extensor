<p>160 ml of coconut milk is approximately ⅔ cup, making it a handy measurement for air fryer recipes.

At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we know precise measurements are key to delicious meals. Let’s dive deeper into conversions and tips for using coconut milk in your air fryer.</p>  

<h2>Understanding Coconut Milk Measurements</h2>  
<p>Coconut milk is a staple in many dishes, from creamy curries to rich desserts. Measuring it correctly ensures your recipes turn out just right. While 160 ml of coconut milk equals roughly ⅔ cup, slight variations can occur based on density. For air fryer cooking, accuracy matters—especially when baking or making sauces. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more handy measurement tips.</p>  

<p>Different brands of coconut milk may have varying thicknesses, affecting volume. Always shake the can well before measuring to ensure consistency. If you’re using homemade coconut milk, strain it first for accurate results. For recipes requiring precise amounts, like those in our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a>, a measuring jug or kitchen scale is ideal.</p>  

<h3>Why 160 ml of Coconut Milk Matters in Air Fryer Cooking</h3>  
<p>Many air fryer recipes call for small amounts of liquid, like 160 ml of coconut milk, to avoid sogginess. This measurement is perfect for marinades, glazes, or light sauces. Using too much can lead to uneven cooking, while too little may dry out your dish. For example, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipes</a> often use coconut milk for tender, flavourful results.</p>  

<h2>Converting 160 ml of Coconut Milk for Baking</h2>  
<p>Baking in an air fryer requires precision, especially with wet ingredients like coconut milk. Since 160 ml equals ⅔ cup, it’s easy to adjust recipes without hassle. If a recipe calls for 1 cup but you only have 160 ml, simply reduce other liquids slightly.

<p>When substituting coconut milk in baked goods, remember it adds moisture and richness. If using light coconut milk, you may need slightly more to match the consistency. Always preheat your air fryer for even baking, and avoid overfilling the basket.

<h3>Common Mistakes When Measuring Coconut Milk</h3>  
<p>One mistake is not accounting for the separation in canned coconut milk. Always mix it thoroughly before measuring 160 ml for accurate results. Another error is using a dry measuring cup for liquids—opt for a liquid cup or jug instead. For best results, measure at eye level to avoid over- or under-pouring.</p>

This guide will help you convert 2.0 cups of butter to grams effortlessly, so you never have to second-guess your ingredients again.</p>

<h2>Why Convert Cups to Grams for Butter?</h2>  
<p>Using grams instead of cups for butter measurements eliminates guesswork, especially in air frying. Cups can vary based on how the butter is packed, while grams provide a consistent weight. For air fryer recipes, precision ensures even cooking and perfect texture. Whether you're making crispy garlic bread or buttery pastries, accurate measurements matter.

<p>Butter density can differ slightly between brands, but 2.0 cups of butter generally weigh 454 grams. This standardisation helps when scaling recipes up or down. If you're prepping multiple batches, grams make dividing ingredients simpler.

<h3>US vs UK Butter Measurements</h3>  
<p>In the UK, butter is often sold in 250g blocks, while US sticks are typically 113g each. This means 2.0 cups of butter (454g) equals roughly two UK blocks or four US sticks.

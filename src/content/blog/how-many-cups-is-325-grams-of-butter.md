<p>325 grams of butter is roughly equivalent to 1.42 cups in the UK or 1.37 cups in the US. This conversion is essential for baking and air frying, where precise measurements can make or break a recipe. Whether you're making cakes, cookies, or even savoury dishes in your air fryer, knowing how to convert grams to cups ensures consistency. For more air fryer conversions, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Butter Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Butter is a key ingredient in many recipes, and even small measurement errors can affect texture and taste. Too much butter can make cakes greasy, while too little can leave them dry. For air fryer recipes, precise butter quantities help achieve the perfect crispiness. If you're working with frozen foods or baking, visit our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/frozen-foods>frozen foods category</a> for more tips.</p>  

<p>In the UK, butter is often sold in 250g blocks, making 325g slightly more than one block plus a quarter. In the US, butter comes in sticks, with each stick weighing about 113g. Understanding these differences helps when converting 325 grams of butter to cups. For more baking inspiration, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a>.</p>  

<h3>UK vs. US Cup Measurements</h3>  
<p>UK and US cup measurements differ slightly, which affects how 325 grams of butter converts. A UK cup holds 250ml, while a US cup is 240ml. This means 325g of butter equals 1.42 UK cups or 1.37 US cups. Always check which measurement system your recipe uses to avoid mistakes. For cleaning tips after buttery recipes, see our guide on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner</a>.</p>  

<h2>How to Measure 325 Grams of Butter Without Scales</h2>  
<p>If you don’t have scales, you can still measure 325 grams of butter using tablespoons or the markings on the packaging. One tablespoon of butter weighs about 14g, so 325g is roughly 23 tablespoons. Most butter blocks also have measurement lines for easy cutting. For more measurement hacks, visit <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>.</p>  

<p>Another method is using displacement: fill a measuring cup with water, add butter until the water rises to the 1.42-cup mark (UK) or 1.37-cup mark (US). This works well for sticky ingredients like butter. Whether you're baking or air frying, accurate measurements ensure perfect results every time.</p>  

<h3>Common Recipes Using 325 Grams of Butter</h3>  
<p>325 grams of butter is often used in cakes, cookies, and pastry recipes. For example, a classic Victoria sponge or buttery shortbread might call for this amount. In air frying, butter is great for basting meats or adding richness to vegetables.

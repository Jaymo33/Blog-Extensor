<h2>Maintaining Your Air Fryer at High Temperatures</h2>
<p>Regular use at high temperatures like 463°F (Gas Mark 9) means your air fryer needs proper care. Food particles can burn onto surfaces at these heats, so regular cleaning is essential. We recommend using our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaning guide</a> to keep your appliance in top condition. Always allow the air fryer to cool completely before cleaning to avoid burns or damage to components.</p>
<p>At these high temperatures, it's also important to ensure proper ventilation around your air fryer. The intense heat can cause steam and smoke, especially when cooking fatty foods. Position your air fryer with adequate space around it, and consider using it under your cooker hood if available.

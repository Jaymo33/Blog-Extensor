<h2>Why Convert 250g of Milk to Ounces?</h2>
<p>Converting 250g of milk to ounces is crucial for following recipes accurately, particularly those from international sources. Many UK recipes use grams, while others rely on ounces, so understanding the conversion helps avoid mistakes.

<h2>How to Measure 250g of Milk Accurately</h2>
<p>To measure 250g of milk, you can use a kitchen scale for the most accurate results. Simply pour the milk into a measuring jug on the scale until it hits 250g. If you don't have a scale, 250g of milk is roughly 250ml, as milk's density is close to water.</p>

<p>4 tablespoons (tbsp) of cooked rice weighs approximately 60 grams. This conversion is essential for precise air fryer cooking, ensuring consistent results every time. Whether you’re meal prepping or following a recipe, knowing this measurement helps avoid guesswork. For more handy conversions, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>  

<h2>Why measuring cooked rice matters for air fryer recipes</h2>  
<p>Accurate measurements are crucial when using an air fryer, as cooking times and temperatures rely on portion sizes. Too much rice can lead to uneven cooking, while too little might dry out. By converting 4 tbsp of cooked rice to grams, you ensure perfect results every time. This is especially useful for meal prepping or batch cooking. Visit <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>our recipe hub</a> for more portion-controlled ideas.</p>  

<p>Rice expands when cooked, so volume measurements like tablespoons can be misleading. Weighing in grams provides consistency, whether you’re reheating leftovers or making crispy rice cakes. For best results, use a digital kitchen scale for precision. This method also works well for other grains like quinoa or couscous. Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/meal-prep>meal prep category</a> for more tips.</p>  

<h3>How to measure 4 tbsp of cooked rice without a scale</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a scale, lightly pack the rice into a tablespoon without pressing down. Four level tablespoons should give you roughly 60 grams. For sticky rice, fluff it first to avoid compacting. This method works for most types of cooked rice, from basmati to jasmine. Keep in mind that brown rice may weigh slightly more due to its density.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for 4 tbsp of cooked rice in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>This portion size is perfect for single servings of air-fried rice cakes or crispy rice bowls. It’s also ideal for adding to stuffed peppers or mixing with vegetables. For a quick snack, try air-frying 60 grams of rice with a bit of oil for crunch. You’ll find plenty of inspiration in our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable recipes</a> section.</p>  

<p>When reheating leftovers, 4 tbsp (60g) ensures even warming without drying out. Spread it thinly in the air fryer basket for best results. This amount also works well for binding ingredients in veggie burgers or fritters. For cleaning tips after cooking rice dishes, see our guide on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer maintenance</a>.</p>  

<h3>Nutritional information for 60 grams of cooked rice</h3>  
<p>White rice contains about 70 calories per 60g serving, with minimal fat and 15g of carbohydrates. Brown rice offers more fibre and nutrients for the same weight. This makes 4 tbsp a sensible portion for balanced meals. Adjust quantities based on your dietary needs and recipe requirements.</p>

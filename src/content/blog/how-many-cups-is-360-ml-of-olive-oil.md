<p>360 ml of olive oil is approximately 1.52 cups. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes, where precise measurements ensure the best results. Whether you're baking, frying, or drizzling, knowing how to convert millilitres to cups makes cooking easier. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we help simplify kitchen conversions so you can focus on creating delicious meals.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Olive Oil Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of olive oil in your air fryer recipes ensures even cooking and perfect texture. Too much oil can make food greasy, while too little may cause sticking or dryness. Many air fryer recipes, like crispy potatoes or roasted vegetables, rely on precise oil measurements. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for quick reference when adjusting quantities. Whether you're cooking for one or meal prepping, accuracy is key.</p>  

<p>Olive oil is a staple in Mediterranean and healthy cooking, often used in dressings, marinades, and air-fried dishes. If you're converting 360 ml of olive oil to cups, remember that liquid measurements can vary slightly based on density. For most cooking purposes, 1.52 cups will work perfectly. Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a> for inspiration on using olive oil in your air fryer.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure 360 ml of Olive Oil Without a Scale</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a measuring jug, you can use standard cups to measure 360 ml of olive oil. One UK metric cup holds 250 ml, so 360 ml is roughly 1 and a half cups plus 1 tablespoon. For US cups, which are 240 ml, it’s about 1.5 cups plus 2 teaspoons. This small difference won’t drastically affect most recipes, but precision matters in baking. Keep a conversion guide handy, like the one at <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, for quick checks.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for 360 ml of Olive Oil in Air Fryers</h2>  
<p>360 ml (1.52 cups) of olive oil is enough for multiple batches of air-fried dishes. You might use it for marinating chicken, coating vegetables, or making crispy snacks. Olive oil’s high smoke point makes it ideal for air frying at higher temperatures. Try it in our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipes</a> for juicy, golden results. Proper measurement ensures even distribution, so your food cooks uniformly without excess grease.</p>  

<p>Another great use for 360 ml of olive oil is making homemade air fryer dressings or dips. Combine it with herbs, garlic, or lemon juice for a flavour boost. Since air fryers require less oil than traditional frying, 360 ml can last through several cooking sessions.

<h3>Converting Other Olive Oil Quantities</h3>  
<p>If your recipe calls for a different amount of olive oil, the same principles apply. For example, 180 ml is roughly 0.76 cups, and 500 ml is about 2.11 cups. Memorising these conversions helps streamline meal prep. Whether you’re adjusting a recipe or scaling up, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a> has you covered. Cooking with an air fryer is all about efficiency, and accurate measurements save time and hassle.</p>

<p>185 C in a fan oven is equivalent to approximately 165 C with the fan setting. This reduction accounts for the fan's efficient heat distribution, ensuring even cooking without over-browning. When using an air fryer, which operates similarly to a fan oven, you'll often find recipes calling for this precise temperature adjustment.</p>

<h2>Understanding Fan Oven Conversions</h2>
<p>Fan ovens circulate hot air using a built-in fan, cooking food more evenly than conventional ovens. For most recipes, you'll need to reduce the temperature by 20°C when converting from conventional to fan settings. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> makes these adjustments simple for all your cooking needs.</p>
<p>When dealing with 185 C in a fan oven, remember this applies particularly well to delicate bakes like soufflés or custards. The lower temperature prevents cracking or collapsing while ensuring thorough cooking. Many <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>cake recipes</a> specifically recommend this temperature for perfect rise and texture.</p>

<h3>Why 185 C Works for Fan Cooking</h3>
<p>The 165 C fan setting maintains gentle heat that won't shock delicate ingredients. This makes it ideal for recipes requiring gradual cooking, from meringues to slow-roasted vegetables. In an air fryer, you might need to slightly reduce cooking times compared to a traditional fan oven.</p>

<h2>Air Fryer Equivalent for 185 C</h2>
<p>Modern air fryers essentially function as compact fan ovens, making temperature conversions straightforward. When a recipe states 185 C for a conventional oven, set your air fryer to 165 C for equivalent results. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a> for tested air fryer adaptations.</p>
<p>This conversion proves especially useful for <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken dishes</a> where even cooking matters. The circulating air ensures crispy skin without drying out the meat. Always use a meat thermometer to confirm doneness when trying new temperature settings.</p>

<h3>Adjusting Cooking Times</h3>
<p>While the temperature converts directly, air fryers often cook faster than traditional ovens. Start checking food 5-10 minutes earlier than the recipe suggests. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning guide</a> helps maintain your appliance's efficiency for accurate temperature performance.</p>

<h2>Common Uses for 185 C Fan Setting</h2>
<p>This moderate temperature works beautifully for roasting nuts, toasting breadcrumbs, or dehydrating fruits. The fan-assisted heat prevents burning while drawing out moisture evenly. It's also perfect for reheating <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/frozen-foods>frozen foods</a> without making them soggy.</p>
<p>For baked goods like scones or biscuits, the 165 C fan setting creates ideal lift without excessive browning. The circulating air helps develop that sought-after flaky texture. Remember that oven thermostats can vary, so consider using an independent thermometer for precision.</p>

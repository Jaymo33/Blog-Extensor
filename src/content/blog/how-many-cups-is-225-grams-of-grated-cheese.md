<p>225 grams of grated cheese equals approximately 2.25 cups in standard US measurements, or roughly 2 cups in UK measurements. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes, where precise ingredient quantities can affect texture and cooking times. Whether you're making cheesy garlic bread, stuffed mushrooms, or a crispy topping for baked dishes, knowing how many cups 225 grams of grated cheese yields ensures consistent results.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Cheese Measurements Matter in Air Frying</h2>  
<p>Using the correct amount of grated cheese in air fryer recipes prevents uneven cooking and ensures the perfect melt. Too much cheese can lead to clumping or excess oil, while too little may leave your dish lacking in flavour. For dishes like air-fried nachos or cheesy stuffed peppers, 225 grams of grated cheese provides just the right balance. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipe collection</a> for inspiration on how to use this measurement effectively.</p>  

<p>Different types of cheese (cheddar, mozzarella, parmesan) have slightly varying densities, but 225 grams generally translates to the same cup measurement. If you're adapting a recipe from grams to cups, always lightly pack the grated cheese into the measuring cup for consistency. For more tips on air fryer conversions, visit our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart guide</a>.</p>  

<h3>US vs. UK Cup Measurements for Grated Cheese</h3>  
<p>In the US, 1 cup of grated cheese typically weighs around 100 grams, meaning 225 grams equals roughly 2.25 cups. UK cup measurements are slightly larger, so 225 grams of grated cheese is closer to 2 cups. Always check whether your recipe uses metric or imperial measurements to avoid discrepancies. For British-friendly air fryer dishes like cheesy jacket potatoes, this distinction matters.</p>  

<h2>How to Measure 225 Grams of Grated Cheese Without Scales</h2>  
<p>If you don’t have kitchen scales, use the spoon-and-level method for accuracy. Lightly fill your measuring cup with grated cheese without packing it down, then level off the top with a knife. For 225 grams, you’ll need about 2¼ US cups or 2 UK cups. Recipes like air-fryer mac and cheese or crispy cheese bites rely on this precision for the best results.</p>  

<p>Pre-grated cheese often contains anti-caking agents, which can slightly alter volume. For fresher results, grate your own cheese and measure immediately. Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable-based recipes</a> that pair perfectly with 225 grams of grated cheese, such as cheesy cauliflower bites or stuffed bell peppers.</p>  

<h3>Common Recipes Using 225 Grams of Grated Cheese</h3>  
<p>This quantity works perfectly for family-sized portions of air-fryer favourites. Try it in cheesy garlic bread (spread over a baguette), as a topping for loaded fries, or mixed into dough for cheese-stuffed rolls. For a lighter option, sprinkle 225 grams of grated cheese over air-fried zucchini or aubergine slices.</p>  

<h2>Storing Leftover Grated Cheese</h2>  
<p>If your recipe doesn’t use the full 225 grams, store leftovers in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 5 days. Avoid freezing pre-grated cheese, as it can become crumbly. For more storage tips and cleaning advice, see our guide on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>maintaining your air fryer</a> after cheesy recipes.</p>  

<p>To repurpose extra grated cheese, add it to omelettes, salads, or homemade pizza in your air fryer. For a quick snack, air-fry small piles of cheese into crispy crisps.

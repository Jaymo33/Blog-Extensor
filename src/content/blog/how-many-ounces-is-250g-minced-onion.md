Minced onion is a staple in many recipes, from hearty stews to crispy air-fried snacks, so getting the measurement right is key.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on precise ingredient ratios to deliver even cooking and perfect textures. Too much or too little minced onion can alter the flavour and texture of your dish.

<p>Many UK cooks prefer weighing ingredients in grams, but some recipes, especially older or American ones, use ounces. Knowing how to convert between the two saves time and avoids kitchen mishaps. Whether you're following a classic recipe or experimenting with new ideas, accurate measurements make all the difference.</p>  

<h3>How to measure minced onion correctly</h3>  
<p>For the best results, use a digital kitchen scale to weigh your minced onion. Scoop the onion into a bowl on the scale until it hits 250g (or 8.82 ounces). If you don’t have a scale, loosely packed minced onion fills about 2.5 US cups, but weighing is far more precise. Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a> for dishes that make the most of this versatile ingredient.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for minced onion in air fryer recipes</h2>  
<p>Minced onion adds depth to countless air fryer dishes, from meatloaves to veggie patties. A 250g portion (8.82 ounces) is ideal for larger batches, like family-sized meals or meal prep. Try it in air-fried kebabs, stuffed mushrooms, or even as a topping for loaded fries. The possibilities are endless!</p>  

<p>If you're cooking for one, you might not need the full 250g. Simply halve or quarter the amount, converting to 4.41 or 2.2 ounces accordingly.

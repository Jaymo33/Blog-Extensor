<p>1.5 cups of tomato sauce equals approximately 355 millilitres (ml). This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes, where precise measurements ensure perfect results. Whether you're making a rich pasta sauce or a tangy marinade, knowing the exact ml equivalent helps streamline your cooking process. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we focus on making kitchen conversions simple, so you can spend less time measuring and more time enjoying delicious meals.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Using the correct amount of tomato sauce—355 ml for 1.5 cups—ensures your dish isn’t too dry or overly saucy. Air fryers circulate hot air rapidly, so ingredient ratios directly impact texture and flavour. Too much liquid can lead to soggy results, while too little may dry out your food. For consistent outcomes, always measure sauces like tomato puree or passata accurately. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for other common ingredient swaps.</p>  

<p>Tomato sauce is a staple in many air fryer recipes, from meatball subs to stuffed peppers. If you’re scaling a recipe up or down, converting cups to millilitres (like 1.5 cups to 355 ml) ensures uniformity. This is especially useful when adapting American recipes, which often use cup measurements. For more inspiration, browse our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> collection, featuring everything from crispy chicken to vegetable bakes.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure Tomato Sauce Correctly</h3>  
<p>To measure 1.5 cups (355 ml) of tomato sauce, use a liquid measuring cup for accuracy. Pour the sauce to the 1.5-cup mark, or use a metric jug for millilitres. Stir thicker sauces first to eliminate air pockets. If your recipe calls for a UK or US cup measurement, note that 1 US cup equals 240 ml, while 1 UK cup is 284 ml—though most recipes standardise to the US measurement. For more tips, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable-based recipes</a> that often feature tomato sauce.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for 1.5 Cups (355 ml) of Tomato Sauce</h2>  
<p>This quantity is perfect for coating pasta, creating a pizza base, or marinating proteins like chicken or tofu. In the air fryer, 355 ml of tomato sauce can evenly cover a family-sized portion of meatballs or roasted vegetables. It’s also ideal for layering in lasagna or as a dipping sauce for air-fried snacks. Visit <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> for creative ways to use tomato sauce in your air fryer, such as in our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipes</a>.</p>  

<p>If you’re meal prepping, 1.5 cups (355 ml) of tomato sauce can be divided into portions for multiple dishes. Freeze leftovers in airtight containers for future use. Remember, thicker sauces like passata may require slight adjustments in air fryer cooking times. For cleaning sticky residue, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner guide</a> has you covered.</p>  

<h3>Converting Other Tomato Sauce Quantities</h3>  
<p>Need to adjust your recipe? Here’s a quick reference: 1 cup of tomato sauce is 240 ml, while 2 cups equal 480 ml. For half a cup, use 120 ml. These conversions ensure you’re never left guessing when adapting recipes. Whether you’re cooking for one or a crowd, precise measurements like 1.5 cups (355 ml) guarantee consistent, tasty results every time.</p>

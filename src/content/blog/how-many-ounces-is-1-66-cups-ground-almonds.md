<p>1.66 cups of ground almonds equals approximately 6.5 ounces (oz). This measurement is essential for air fryer recipes, ensuring your bakes and dishes turn out perfectly every time. Whether you're making almond flour cakes or coating chicken, accurate conversions make all the difference.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate measurement matters in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Precision is crucial when using an air fryer, as ingredients cook faster and more evenly than in conventional ovens. Ground almonds, often used in gluten-free baking or as a coating, need exact measurements to avoid dry or overly dense results. A slight variation can affect texture, moisture, and cooking time.</p>  
<p>For example, if you're following a recipe from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> for almond-crusted salmon, knowing that 1.66 cups of ground almonds equals 6.5 oz ensures the right crispiness. Too little, and the coating won’t stick; too much, and it may burn. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more handy measurements.</p>  

<h3>How to measure ground almonds correctly</h3>  
<p>Use a kitchen scale for the most accurate results, especially since ground almonds can settle or fluff up in a cup. If you don’t have one, spoon the almonds into a measuring cup and level it off—never pack it down. This method helps avoid over-measuring, which could throw off your recipe.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for ground almonds in air fryer recipes</h2>  
<p>Ground almonds are versatile in air fryer cooking, from desserts like frangipane tarts to savoury coatings for chicken or fish. They add a nutty flavour and crisp texture, making them a favourite for low-carb and gluten-free diets. For inspiration, browse our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert recipes</a> featuring almonds.</p>  
<p>Another popular use is in energy bites or protein bars, where 1.66 cups (6.5 oz) of ground almonds binds ingredients without needing flour. The air fryer’s rapid circulation ensures even cooking, so your snacks won’t turn out soggy or uneven.</p>  

<h3>Converting other almond measurements</h3>  
<p>If your recipe calls for whole or sliced almonds instead of ground, the weight will differ. For instance, 1 cup of whole almonds weighs about 5 oz, while ground almonds are lighter per cup due to air incorporation. Always check whether your recipe specifies ground or whole for the best results.</p>  

<h2>Tips for storing ground almonds</h2>  
<p>To keep ground almonds fresh, store them in an airtight container in a cool, dark place or the fridge. They can go rancid quickly due to their high oil content. If you buy in bulk, portion them out—knowing that 1.66 cups equals 6.5 oz helps with meal prep efficiency.</p>  
<p>For more storage hacks and cleaning tips, visit our guide on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>keeping your air fryer in top shape</a>. Proper maintenance ensures your almond-based recipes cook evenly every time.</p>  

<h3>Scaling recipes up or down</h3>  
<p>Need to adjust a recipe? If it calls for 3.32 cups of ground almonds (double 1.66 cups), that’s roughly 13 oz. Halving it? Just 3.25 oz. This flexibility is handy for batch cooking or smaller servings, especially when using your air fryer for <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/meal-prep>meal prep</a>.</p>

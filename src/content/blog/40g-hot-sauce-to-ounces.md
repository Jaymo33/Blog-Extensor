<h2>Why accurate hot sauce measurements matter</h2>  
<p>Hot sauce can dramatically alter the flavour of your dish, so getting the amount right is crucial. Too little, and your meal might lack punch; too much, and it could become overpowering. In air fryer cooking, where ingredients cook quickly, precision is key. For example, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>spicy air fryer chicken wings</a> rely on the perfect balance of heat and flavour. Converting 40g of hot sauce to ounces ensures you stay on track.</p>  

<p>Many UK recipes use grams, but some cooks prefer ounces for smaller quantities. This is especially true for condiments like hot sauce, where a slight variation can impact the result. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> simplifies these calculations, so you never have to second-guess your measurements.</p>  

<h3>How to measure 40g of hot sauce without scales</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a kitchen scale, you can still measure 40g of hot sauce using tablespoons. One tablespoon of hot sauce weighs roughly 15g, so 40g is just over 2.5 tablespoons. This method isn’t as precise as weighing, but it works in a pinch. For best results, invest in a digital scale—it’s a game-changer for air fryer cooking.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for 40g of hot sauce in air fryer recipes</h2>

<p>Reheating duck legs in an air fryer is simple and ensures crispy skin without drying out the meat. Set your air fryer to 160°C (320°F) and reheat for 8–10 minutes, flipping halfway for even crispiness. This method works brilliantly for leftover duck legs, whether they’re from the fridge or frozen.</p>  

<h2>Why Use an Air Fryer to Reheat Duck Legs?</h2>  
<p>An air fryer circulates hot air around the duck legs, crisping the skin while keeping the meat tender. Unlike a microwave, which can make the skin soggy, an air fryer restores that delicious crunch. It’s also faster than reheating in an oven, making it perfect for quick meals. If you love crispy duck legs, this method is a game-changer. For more air fryer tips, check out <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>.</p>  

<p>Duck legs contain a good amount of fat, which helps them reheat beautifully in an air fryer. The fat renders slightly, basting the meat as it warms. This prevents dryness, a common issue when reheating poultry. Whether you’re using leftovers or meal-prepped duck, the air fryer delivers consistent results.

<h2>Step-by-Step Guide to Reheating Duck Legs</h2>  
<h3>Preheating the Air Fryer</h3>  
<p>Preheat your air fryer to 160°C (320°F) for 3–5 minutes before adding the duck legs. This ensures even heating from the start. If your air fryer doesn’t have a preheat function, simply run it empty for a few minutes. Preheating helps achieve that perfect crispy texture.</p>  

<h3>Reheating Time and Temperature</h3>  
<p>Place the duck legs in the air fryer basket in a single layer, ensuring they aren’t overlapping. Cook for 8–10 minutes at 160°C (320°F), flipping halfway through. For extra crispiness, spritz lightly with oil before reheating. Adjust the time slightly if reheating from frozen.</p>  

<h2>Tips for the Best Results</h2>  
<p>If your duck legs were refrigerated, let them sit at room temperature for 10 minutes before reheating. This reduces the risk of uneven heating. For frozen duck legs, add 2–3 extra minutes to the cooking time. Always check the internal temperature reaches 74°C (165°F) for food safety.</p>  

<p>Avoid overcrowding the air fryer basket, as this can lead to steaming instead of crisping. If reheating multiple duck legs, work in batches. For extra flavour, brush with a little hoisin or soy sauce before reheating.

<h2>Common Mistakes to Avoid</h2>  
<p>One mistake is reheating at too high a temperature, which can dry out the meat. Stick to 160°C (320°F) for juicy results. Another error is skipping the flip, which leads to uneven crispiness. Always turn the duck legs halfway through cooking. For more troubleshooting, visit <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>.</p>  

<p>Using foil or parchment paper can block airflow, reducing crispiness. Instead, place duck legs directly in the basket. If the skin isn’t crispy enough, increase the temperature to 180°C (356°F) for the last 2 minutes. Keep an eye on them to prevent burning.</p>  

<h2>Serving Suggestions</h2>  
<p>Reheated duck legs pair wonderfully with steamed rice, stir-fried veggies, or a fresh salad. Drizzle with leftover sauce or a quick glaze for extra flavour. They also make a great filling for wraps or bao buns. For more ideas, browse our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>poultry recipes</a>.</p>  

<p>If you’re meal prepping, duck legs reheat beautifully for lunches. Store them in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 3 days. For longer storage, freeze them and reheat straight from frozen, adding a few extra minutes. Always let them rest for a minute before serving.</p>

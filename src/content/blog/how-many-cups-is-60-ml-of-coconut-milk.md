<p>60 ml of coconut milk equals approximately 0.25 cups (or 1/4 cup). This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes, where precise measurements can make or break a dish. Whether you're whipping up a curry, baking a cake, or making a creamy sauce, knowing how to convert 60 ml of coconut milk to cups ensures consistency. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we focus on making cooking conversions simple for home chefs.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on precise ingredient ratios to achieve the perfect texture and flavour. Too much or too little coconut milk can affect moisture levels, especially in baked goods or sauces. For example, if you're making a Thai-inspired curry in your air fryer, 60 ml of coconut milk (or 0.25 cups) provides just the right creaminess without overpowering other ingredients. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more handy measurement tips.</p>  

<p>Many air fryer recipes, like those in our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipes section</a>, call for coconut milk in millilitres or cups. Understanding how to convert 60 ml of coconut milk to cups helps you follow international recipes with ease. Whether you're in the UK or the USA, this conversion remains the same, making it a universal kitchen hack.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure 60 ml of Coconut Milk Without a Scale</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a measuring jug, you can use a standard tablespoon to measure 60 ml of coconut milk. Four tablespoons equal roughly 60 ml, which is close enough for most recipes. For baking, however, we recommend using proper measuring cups or a kitchen scale for accuracy. Visit our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert recipes</a> for ideas where precise coconut milk measurements matter.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for 60 ml of Coconut Milk in Air Fryer Recipes</h2>  
<p>From curries to cakes, 60 ml of coconut milk (0.25 cups) is a versatile ingredient. In air fryer cooking, it’s often used to add moisture to proteins like chicken or tofu. For example, marinating chicken in 60 ml of coconut milk with spices before air frying keeps it tender. You’ll find plenty of inspiration in our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipes</a>.</p>  

<p>Another popular use is in desserts, where 60 ml of coconut milk can replace dairy in vegan-friendly bakes. Try adding it to air fryer banana bread or mug cakes for a rich, tropical twist. Just remember, 60 ml equals 0.25 cups, so adjust your recipe accordingly. For more baking tips, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>cake recipes</a>.</p>  

<h3>Does Coconut Milk Thickness Affect the Measurement?</h3>  
<p>Full-fat and light coconut milk have different consistencies, but 60 ml of either still equals 0.25 cups. However, thicker coconut milk may require stirring before measuring to ensure accuracy. If your recipe calls for 60 ml of coconut milk, always shake the can well or whisk it lightly for uniform texture.</p>

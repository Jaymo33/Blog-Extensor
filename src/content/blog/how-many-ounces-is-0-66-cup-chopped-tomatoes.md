<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Precision is key when using an air fryer, as overcrowding or uneven portions can affect cooking times and texture.

<h3>How to measure chopped tomatoes for air fryer recipes</h3>  
<p>Using a kitchen scale is the most accurate way to measure 0.66 cup of chopped tomatoes, as volume can vary based on how finely they’re diced. If you don’t have a scale, lightly pack the tomatoes into a measuring cup for consistency. This method works well for recipes like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>air fryer ratatouille</a> or tomato-based sauces.</p>  

<h2>Common recipes using 0.66 cup of chopped tomatoes</h2>

The measurement ensures the right balance of moisture and flavour without making the dish too watery.</p>  

<p>If you’re working with frozen chopped tomatoes, the weight remains the same, but thawing may release extra liquid. Adjust cooking times slightly to account for this.

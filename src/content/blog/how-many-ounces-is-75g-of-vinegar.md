    "@type": "Answer",
    "text": "This could happen if your vinegar is stronger than the recipe assumes. Some vinegars, like white wine or sherry vinegar, have higher acidity. Start with slightly less (e.g., 60g or 2.1 ounces) and adjust to taste. Always taste-test marinades before adding them to your dish."

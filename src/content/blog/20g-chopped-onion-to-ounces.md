<p>20g of chopped onion equals approximately 0.7 ounces. This conversion is handy for air fryer recipes where precise measurements ensure the best results. Whether you're prepping a stir-fry or adding onions to a casserole, knowing the exact weight helps maintain consistency.

<h2>Why accurate onion measurements matter</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of chopped onion can make or break a dish. Too little, and you miss out on flavour; too much, and it overpowers other ingredients. In air fryer cooking, even distribution is key for even cooking. Recipes like air-fried fajitas or onion-topped burgers rely on balanced portions. Visit <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>our recipe collection</a> for inspiration.</p>  

<p>Chopped onion adds moisture and depth to air fryer meals. A 20g portion (0.7 oz) is ideal for single servings or small batches. For larger quantities, scale up proportionally. If you're new to air frying, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a> simplifies all your measurement needs.</p>  

<h3>How to measure 20g of chopped onion</h3>  
<p>Use digital kitchen scales for the most accurate 20g measurement. If you don't have scales, roughly 2 tablespoons of finely chopped onion equals 20g. Pack the onions lightly into the spoon for consistency. For recipes requiring precise amounts, like onion rings, weighing is best.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for 20g chopped onion</h2>  
<p>This small-but-mighty portion works well in omelettes, stuffed mushrooms, or as a garnish for air-fried dishes. It's also perfect for seasoning minced meat or adding to marinades. Explore <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable-based recipes</a> that make the most of this quantity.</p>  

<p>When prepping ahead, store unused chopped onion in an airtight container. It keeps for 2-3 days in the fridge - just pat dry before use to prevent excess moisture in your air fryer. For cleaning tips after onion-heavy recipes, see <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>our maintenance guide</a>.</p>  

<h3>Converting other onion amounts</h3>  
<p>The same 1g = 0.035oz ratio applies to any quantity. For example, 50g equals 1.76oz, while 100g is 3.5oz. Bookmark this conversion for all your air fryer adventures. Remember, onion sizes vary - when in doubt, weigh for accuracy.</p>

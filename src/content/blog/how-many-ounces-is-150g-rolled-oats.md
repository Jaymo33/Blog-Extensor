<h2>Why convert 150g rolled oats to ounces?</h2>  
<p>Many UK recipes, especially those for air fryers, list ingredients in grams, while some kitchen scales or older cookbooks use ounces. Converting 150g of rolled oats to ounces (5.29 oz) helps avoid measurement mishaps. This is particularly useful for air fryer recipes, where ingredient ratios affect texture and cooking times.

<h2>How to measure 150g rolled oats without scales</h2>  
<p>If you don’t have digital scales, you can use volume measurements to approximate 150g of rolled oats. One UK metric cup holds roughly 90g of rolled oats, so 150g would be about 1 and 2/3 cups. However, for air fryer recipes where precision matters, investing in a kitchen scale is worthwhile.</p>

<h3>Does oat type affect the weight conversion?</h3>  
<p>While 150g of rolled oats equals 5.29 ounces regardless of variety, different oat types (jumbo, porridge, or quick oats) may settle differently in a measuring cup. For air fryer recipes, we recommend using standard rolled oats unless specified otherwise, as they provide the ideal texture for most dishes.</p>

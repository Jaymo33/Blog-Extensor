<p>200 grams of chopped onion is approximately 7.05 ounces. This conversion is handy for air fryer recipes, ensuring you get the right balance of flavours and textures. Whether you're making crispy onion rings or a savoury stir-fry, knowing the exact weight helps achieve consistent results. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we love simplifying measurements so you can focus on cooking.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air frying</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on precise ingredient quantities to cook food evenly. Too much or too little onion can affect the dish's moisture and crispiness. For example, 200g of chopped onion (7.05 oz) is ideal for recipes like air-fried onion bhajis or caramelised onion toppings.

<p>Using the correct amount ensures your air fryer cooks efficiently without overcrowding. Overloading can lead to uneven cooking, while too little may dry out the food. Whether you're following a recipe from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>our collection</a> or experimenting, accuracy is key.</p>

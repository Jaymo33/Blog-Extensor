<p>200 grams of chopped onion is approximately 7.05 ounces. This conversion is handy for air fryer recipes, ensuring you get the right balance of flavours and textures. Whether you're making crispy onion rings or a savoury stir-fry, knowing the exact weight helps achieve consistent results. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we love simplifying measurements so you can focus on cooking.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air frying</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on precise ingredient quantities to cook food evenly. Too much or too little onion can affect the dish's moisture and crispiness. For example, 200g of chopped onion (7.05 oz) is ideal for recipes like air-fried onion bhajis or caramelised onion toppings. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for other common ingredient weights.</p>  

<p>Using the correct amount ensures your air fryer cooks efficiently without overcrowding. Overloading can lead to uneven cooking, while too little may dry out the food. Whether you're following a recipe from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>our collection</a> or experimenting, accuracy is key.</p>  

<h3>How to measure 200g of chopped onion</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a scale, use measuring cups as a rough guide. 200g of chopped onion equals about 1.5 to 2 cups, depending on how finely it’s chopped. For best results, we recommend using a digital scale for precision. This is especially useful for recipes like our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable-based dishes</a>.</p>  

<h2>Common recipes using 200g of chopped onion</h2>  
<p>From air-fried onion rings to savoury tarts, 200g of chopped onion is a versatile quantity. It’s enough to add depth to soups, stews, or even a quick stir-fry. If you're prepping ahead, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/meal-prep>meal prep ideas</a> for inspiration.</p>  

<p>For crispy results, toss the onions lightly in oil before air frying. This ensures they cook evenly and develop a golden texture. Whether you're a beginner or a pro, our tips at <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> will help you master air-fried onions.</p>  

<h3>Storing chopped onions for future use</h3>  
<p>If you’ve prepped extra, store chopped onions in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 3 days. For longer storage, freeze them in portions—200g (7.05 oz) is a convenient batch size. Just thaw before using in your next air fryer recipe.</p>

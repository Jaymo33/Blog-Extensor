<p>0.75 cup of granulated sugar equals approximately 5.29 ounces (150 grams). This measurement is essential for air fryer baking, where precision ensures perfect results. Whether you’re whipping up cookies or cakes, knowing the exact weight helps avoid dry or overly sweet treats. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we focus on accurate conversions to make your cooking effortless.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Sugar Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Baking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers circulate hot air rapidly, which means ingredients like sugar behave differently than in conventional ovens. Too much sugar can cause excessive browning or even burning, while too little may leave your baked goods bland. Measuring 0.75 cup of granulated sugar correctly (5.29 oz) ensures balanced sweetness and texture. For more tips, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>  

<p>Granulated sugar is a staple in many air fryer recipes, from cookies to crumbles. Since air fryers cook faster, precise measurements prevent under or overcooking. If you’re adapting a traditional recipe, always convert cups to ounces for consistency. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipes section</a> offers plenty of tested ideas to try.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure 0.75 Cup of Granulated Sugar</h3>  
<p>Use a dry measuring cup for granulated sugar, filling it just below the rim without packing it down. For 0.75 cup, you’ll need 5.29 ounces—this is crucial for air fryer desserts. A kitchen scale provides the most accurate results, especially when scaling recipes up or down.</p>  

<h2>Common Air Fryer Recipes Using 0.75 Cup Sugar</h2>  
<p>Many air fryer desserts call for around 0.75 cup of granulated sugar, including shortbread, muffins, and brownies. This amount (5.29 oz) strikes a balance between sweetness and structure. For inspiration, browse our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>cake recipes</a> or <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cookies>cookie collection</a>.</p>  

<p>Air fryers excel at baking, but ingredient ratios must be spot-on. Whether you’re making a small batch or meal prepping, knowing 0.75 cup equals 5.29 ounces simplifies the process. Keep your air fryer clean with our recommended <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning tips</a> to maintain performance.</p>  

<h3>Converting Other Sugar Measurements for Air Fryer Use</h3>

Adjusting measurements ensures your air fryer treats turn out perfectly every time.

<p>5 tablespoons of crushed garlic equals approximately 75 grams. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements can make or break your dish. Whether you're whipping up a garlic-infused marinade or seasoning meats, knowing the exact weight ensures consistency. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we focus on accuracy to help you achieve restaurant-quality results at home.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate garlic measurements matter</h2>  
<p>Garlic is a powerhouse ingredient that can dominate a dish if overused. In air fryer cooking, where flavours intensify due to rapid air circulation, getting the right amount is crucial. Too much garlic can overpower delicate proteins like chicken or fish, while too little might leave your meal tasting bland. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> simplifies these measurements for stress-free cooking.</p>  

<p>Different forms of garlic (minced, crushed, or powdered) have varying densities, which affects their weight. Crushed garlic, being slightly denser than minced, packs more flavour per tablespoon. This makes the 5 tbsp to grams conversion particularly useful for recipes requiring bold garlic notes without the guesswork.</p>  

<h3>How to measure crushed garlic accurately</h3>  
<p>For the most precise results, use a digital kitchen scale when converting 5 tablespoons of crushed garlic to grams. Scoop the garlic lightly into your measuring spoon without packing it down, then level it off with a straight edge. This method prevents over-measuring, which could throw off your recipe's balance. If you're preparing a large batch, multiply the 75-gram baseline accordingly.</p>  

<h2>Garlic measurement conversions for air fryer recipes</h2>  
<p>Beyond the standard 5 tbsp crushed garlic to grams conversion, you might need other measurements for different recipes. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a> includes various garlic quantities, from a single clove to bulk preparations. Remember that 1 tablespoon of crushed garlic weighs about 15 grams, making scaling up or down straightforward.</p>  

<p>When adapting conventional oven recipes for your air fryer, garlic measurements become even more critical. The concentrated heat of air frying can amplify garlic's pungency, so you might slightly reduce the amount compared to traditional methods. Always taste and adjust seasonings after the first cook cycle for perfect results.</p>  

<h3>Common recipes using 5 tbsp crushed garlic</h3>  
<p>Many Mediterranean and Asian-inspired dishes call for generous garlic quantities. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>garlic chicken recipes</a> often use this measurement for marinades that penetrate the meat beautifully during air frying. Garlic butter sauces for shrimp or vegetables also benefit from the 5 tbsp (75g) benchmark for balanced flavour.</p>  

<h2>Storing leftover crushed garlic</h2>  
<p>If your recipe doesn't use all 5 tablespoons of crushed garlic, proper storage maintains freshness. Transfer leftovers to an airtight container, covering the surface with a thin layer of olive oil to prevent oxidation. Stored this way in the refrigerator, crushed garlic keeps for up to two weeks - ready for your next <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>air fryer creation</a>.</p>  

<p>For longer storage, freeze measured portions in ice cube trays. Each cube holds about one tablespoon (15g), making future recipe prep effortless. When needed, simply pop out a cube or two - no need to thaw before adding to marinades or sauces going into the air fryer.</p>  

<h3>Cleaning garlic residue from your air fryer</h3>  
<p>After cooking with generous garlic amounts, you might notice lingering odours. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaning guide</a> shares effective methods to eliminate stubborn garlic smells. A simple solution of baking soda and water works wonders, ensuring your next batch of air-fried goodies tastes exactly as intended.</p>

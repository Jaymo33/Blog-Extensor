<p>1 tablespoon (tbsp) of tomato paste weighs approximately 15 grams in UK measurements. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements can make or break a dish. Whether you're making a rich pasta sauce or a flavourful marinade, knowing the exact weight ensures consistency. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we emphasise accuracy to help you achieve the best results every time.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on even cooking, and incorrect ingredient quantities can lead to uneven results. Too much tomato paste, for example, might make a dish overly thick or acidic. Using the correct grams for 1 tbsp of tomato paste ensures your recipes turn out perfectly balanced. If you're new to air frying, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for other common measurements.</p>  

<p>Tomato paste is a concentrated ingredient, so small variations can significantly impact flavour. Whether you're making a quick <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken dish</a> or a hearty stew, precise measurements help maintain the intended taste. For more recipe ideas, browse our collection at <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes</a>.</p>  

<h3>How to measure tomato paste accurately</h3>  
<p>Using a kitchen scale is the most reliable way to measure 1 tbsp of tomato paste in grams. Scoop the paste into a tablespoon, then weigh it to confirm it's 15 grams. If you don't have a scale, levelling off the tablespoon with a knife ensures consistency. For sticky ingredients like tomato paste, lightly oiling the spoon can help it slide off easily.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for tomato paste in air fryer recipes</h2>  
<p>Tomato paste adds depth to sauces, marinades, and even dry rubs for meats. A precise 15-gram portion ensures the right balance of acidity and sweetness. Try it in our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable recipes</a> for an extra flavour boost. Remember, a little goes a long way with this concentrated ingredient.</p>  

<p>If you're working with larger quantities, scaling up is simple. For example, 2 tbsp of tomato paste equals roughly 30 grams. Always double-check measurements to avoid overpowering your dish. For tips on cleaning sticky residues, visit our guide on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner</a>.</p>  

<h3>Converting other tomato paste measurements</h3>  
<p>If a recipe calls for teaspoons or cups, knowing the gram equivalents is helpful. One teaspoon of tomato paste is about 5 grams, while a US cup is roughly 240 grams. These conversions ensure your air fryer dishes turn out just right, whether you're cooking for one or a family.</p>

The intense air circulation means foods often cook faster, especially smaller items like cookies or mini quiches. Keep notes for your favourite recipes to perfect your timings.</p><h2 id="">178 C to Gas Mark for Speciality Baking</h2><p id="">This temperature works wonderfully for delicate bakes like madeleines or financiers in your air fryer. The 178 celsius gas mark level provides gentle enough heat to prevent burning while ensuring proper rise. When baking at 178 C to Gas Mark oven settings, consider reducing sugar slightly as air fryers can caramelise faster than conventional ovens.</p><p id="">For items that normally bake at Gas Mark 4, like scones or tea cakes, the 178 C setting in your air fryer will give you beautifully even results. The key is monitoring during the last few minutes and remembering that the gas mark equivalent of 178 C might cook slightly differently in your specific air fryer model.

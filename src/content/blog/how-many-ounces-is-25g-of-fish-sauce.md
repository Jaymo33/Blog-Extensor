<p>25g of fish sauce equals approximately 0.88 ounces. This conversion is essential for precise cooking, especially when using an air fryer, where accurate measurements can make or break a dish. Whether you're marinating chicken, seasoning seafood, or adding depth to a stir-fry, knowing how to convert grams to ounces ensures consistency in flavour.</p>  

<h2>Why Convert 25g of Fish Sauce to Ounces?</h2>  
<p>Many recipes, especially those from the UK or US, list ingredients in ounces rather than grams. If you're following an air fryer recipe from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, you might need to adjust measurements to match your kitchen scales. Fish sauce is a potent ingredient, and even small discrepancies can affect the taste of your dish. Converting 25g to ounces (0.88 oz) helps maintain balance in sauces, marinades, and dressings.</p>  

<p>Fish sauce is a staple in Southeast Asian cuisine, adding umami depth to dishes like air-fried spring rolls or glazed salmon. If you're experimenting with <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a>, precise measurements ensure your flavours are spot-on. A little goes a long way, so knowing the exact ounce equivalent of 25g prevents over-seasoning.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure 25g of Fish Sauce Accurately</h3>  
<p>For the most accurate conversion, use a digital kitchen scale set to grams. If your scale only displays ounces, 25g of fish sauce will show as 0.88 oz. Alternatively, you can use a measuring spoon—though this method is less precise. One tablespoon of fish sauce typically weighs around 15g, so 25g would be roughly 1.5 tablespoons.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for 25g of Fish Sauce in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Fish sauce is incredibly versatile in air fryer recipes. A 25g (0.88 oz) portion can be used to marinate chicken wings, glaze shrimp, or enhance the flavour of tofu. Check out <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipes</a> for inspiration on how to incorporate this ingredient. Its salty, savoury profile pairs well with sweet and spicy elements, making it ideal for balanced marinades.</p>  

<p>Another great use for 25g of fish sauce is in dipping sauces. Combine it with lime juice, sugar, and chilli for a classic Thai dip to serve with air-fried spring rolls or dumplings. If you're cooking <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/shrimp>shrimp recipes</a>, a light brush of fish sauce glaze adds incredible depth without overpowering the seafood.</p>  

<h3>Tips for Storing Fish Sauce</h3>  
<p>Once opened, fish sauce should be stored in a cool, dark place to maintain its flavour. A 25g portion is a small amount, so you'll likely have leftovers. Ensure the bottle is tightly sealed to prevent oxidation. Proper storage keeps the sauce fresh for up to a year, ready for your next air fryer adventure.</p>  

<h2>Converting Other Fish Sauce Quantities</h2>  
<p>If your recipe calls for more or less than 25g, you can use the same conversion ratio. For example, 50g of fish sauce equals 1.76 oz, while 10g is roughly 0.35 oz. Bookmark <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>our conversion chart</a> for quick reference when adjusting measurements. This is especially handy for air fryer cooking, where precision matters.</p>  

<p>Fish sauce is a key ingredient in many <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable recipes</a>, adding complexity to stir-fries and roasted dishes. Whether you're using 25g or scaling up, knowing the ounce equivalent ensures your dishes are consistently delicious. Keep your air fryer meals flavourful with accurate measurements every time.</p>

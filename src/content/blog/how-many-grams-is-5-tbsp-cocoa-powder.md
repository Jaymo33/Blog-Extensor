<p>5 tablespoons (tbsp) of cocoa powder equals approximately 25 grams (g). This conversion is essential for precise baking, especially when using an air fryer where measurements matter. Whether you're whipping up brownies or a chocolate cake, knowing the exact weight ensures consistent results every time.</p>

<h2>Why accurate cocoa powder measurements matter</h2>  
<p>Using the correct amount of cocoa powder can make or break your recipe. Too little, and your dessert lacks depth; too much, and it becomes bitter. In an air fryer, precise measurements are even more critical due to the concentrated heat.

<p>Most UK recipes list cocoa powder in grams, but if you only have measuring spoons, this conversion is a lifesaver. Digital scales are more accurate, but tablespoons work in a pinch. Always level off your spoon for the best results.</p>  

<h2>How to measure 5 tbsp cocoa powder without scales</h2>  
<p>If you don’t own kitchen scales, use the spoon-and-level method. Scoop the cocoa powder into your tablespoon without packing it down, then level it off with a straight edge. Repeat this five times for 25 grams. For more measurement hacks, visit <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>our conversion guide</a>.</p>  

<h3>Does cocoa powder type affect the weight?</h3>  
<p>Dutch-processed and natural cocoa powders have slightly different densities, but the difference is minimal for home baking. Stick to 5 tbsp = 25g unless your recipe specifies otherwise. For decadent <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>air fryer chocolate cakes</a>, this ratio works perfectly.</p>  

<h2>Common recipes using 5 tbsp cocoa powder</h2>  
<p>This quantity is ideal for small-batch brownies, mug cakes, or chocolate sauces in your air fryer. It’s also the perfect amount for dusting desserts or mixing into frostings. Need inspiration?

<h3>Converting other cocoa powder amounts</h3>  
<p>For larger batches, simply scale up: 10 tbsp = 50g, 20 tbsp = 100g. This linear conversion works for all UK baking recipes. Always sift your cocoa powder first to eliminate lumps and ensure even distribution in your batter.</p>

<h3>Common Uses for 10g of Granulated Sugar</h3>  
<p>10g of granulated sugar is often used in small-batch recipes, such as single-serving mug cakes or air fryer cookies. It’s also handy for sweetening sauces or glazes. For example, a quick glaze for <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>air fryer cakes</a> might call for 10g of sugar mixed with a splash of lemon juice.</p>  

<h2>Converting Other Sugar Quantities</h2>

<p>Granulated sugar isn’t the only ingredient you might need to convert. Brown sugar, icing sugar, and even honey have different weights per volume. Always double-check if your recipe specifies a type of sugar, as substitutions can alter the outcome.</p>  

<h3>Does Sugar Type Affect Weight?</h3>  
<p>Yes, granulated sugar is denser than powdered sugar, so 10g of each will occupy different volumes. For example, 10g of icing sugar is closer to 0.38 oz due to its finer texture. When adapting recipes, stick to the specified sugar type for the best results in your air fryer.</p>

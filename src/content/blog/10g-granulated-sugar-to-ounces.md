<p>10 grams of granulated sugar equals approximately 0.35 ounces. This conversion is essential for precise baking, especially when using an air fryer where measurements can impact texture and cooking times. Whether you're whipping up a cake or adjusting a recipe, knowing how to convert 10g of granulated sugar to ounces ensures consistent results.</p>

<h2>Why Convert 10g of Granulated Sugar to Ounces?</h2>  
<p>Many UK recipes use grams, while others rely on ounces, making conversions necessary for accuracy. If you're using an air fryer, even small measurement discrepancies can affect how your dish turns out. For example, too much sugar in a cake batter might cause uneven browning or a denser texture. Converting 10g of granulated sugar to ounces (0.35 oz) helps maintain the right balance.</p>  
<p>At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we recommend using digital scales for the most precise measurements. However, if you only have measuring spoons or cups, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> can help you make quick adjustments. Granulated sugar’s weight can vary slightly depending on packing, so always spoon it lightly into your measuring tool.</p>  

<h2>How to Measure 10g of Granulated Sugar Without Scales</h2>  
<p>If you don’t have a scale, you can still measure 10g of granulated sugar using tablespoons. One level tablespoon of granulated sugar is roughly 12.5g, so you’d need just under one tablespoon to hit 10g. For ounces, this translates to about 0.35 oz, or roughly two teaspoons.</p>  
<p>When preparing <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert recipes</a> in your air fryer, accuracy matters. Too little sugar might leave your baked goods bland, while too much can cause excessive caramelisation. For best results, invest in a small kitchen scale—they’re affordable and perfect for air fryer cooking.</p>  

<h3>Common Uses for 10g of Granulated Sugar</h3>  
<p>10g of granulated sugar is often used in small-batch recipes, such as single-serving mug cakes or air fryer cookies. It’s also handy for sweetening sauces or glazes. For example, a quick glaze for <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>air fryer cakes</a> might call for 10g of sugar mixed with a splash of lemon juice.</p>  

<h2>Converting Other Sugar Quantities</h2>  
<p>If your recipe calls for larger amounts, here’s a quick reference: 50g of granulated sugar equals 1.76 oz, and 100g is 3.53 oz. Memorising these conversions can save time when adapting recipes for your air fryer. For more tips, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a>, which includes gram-to-ounce conversions for popular dishes.</p>  
<p>Granulated sugar isn’t the only ingredient you might need to convert. Brown sugar, icing sugar, and even honey have different weights per volume. Always double-check if your recipe specifies a type of sugar, as substitutions can alter the outcome.</p>  

<h3>Does Sugar Type Affect Weight?</h3>  
<p>Yes, granulated sugar is denser than powdered sugar, so 10g of each will occupy different volumes. For example, 10g of icing sugar is closer to 0.38 oz due to its finer texture. When adapting recipes, stick to the specified sugar type for the best results in your air fryer.</p>

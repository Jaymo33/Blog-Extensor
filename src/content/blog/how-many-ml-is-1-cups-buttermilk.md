<p>1.0 cups of buttermilk equals 240 millilitres (ml). This conversion is essential for precise baking and air frying, ensuring your recipes turn out perfectly every time. Whether you're whipping up pancakes, marinades, or cakes in your air fryer, knowing this measurement helps avoid kitchen mishaps. For more handy conversions, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Buttermilk Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of buttermilk can make or break your recipe. Too little, and your baked goods may turn out dry; too much, and they could become soggy. Air fryer recipes, in particular, rely on precise liquid measurements for even cooking. Whether you're making buttermilk fried chicken or fluffy scones, 240 ml (1.0 cups) is the golden standard. For more air fryer-friendly recipes, visit <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>our recipe collection</a>.</p>  

<p>Buttermilk’s acidity also plays a role in activating baking soda, so accuracy is key. If you’re using a UK or US measuring cup, rest assured—1.0 cups of buttermilk is universally 240 ml. This consistency makes scaling recipes up or down a breeze. Need to adjust portion sizes? Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion guide</a> has you covered.</p>  

<h2>Converting Buttermilk for Air Fryer Recipes</h2>  
<p>Air fryers excel at delivering crispy, evenly cooked dishes, but they demand precision. When a recipe calls for 1.0 cups of buttermilk (240 ml), measuring correctly ensures the right texture and moisture. This is especially important for batters, like those used for onion rings or tempura. For more tips on perfecting air fryer recipes, explore <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipes</a> that use buttermilk.</p>  

<h3>Measuring Buttermilk Without a Cup</h3>  
<p>No measuring cup? No problem. Use a kitchen scale set to millilitres for accuracy. Alternatively, a standard UK metric measuring jug will display 240 ml clearly. If scaling a recipe, remember that 0.5 cups of buttermilk equals 120 ml, and 2.0 cups equal 480 ml.

<h2>Common Buttermilk Uses in Air Frying</h2>  
<p>Buttermilk isn’t just for baking—it’s a star in air frying too. Marinating chicken in 1.0 cups (240 ml) of buttermilk tenderises meat and adds flavour. It’s also perfect for creating crispy coatings on fried pickles or mozzarella sticks.

<h3>Buttermilk Substitutes in a Pinch</h3>  
<p>Out of buttermilk? Mix 1.0 cups (240 ml) of milk with 1 tablespoon of lemon juice or vinegar. Let it sit for 5 minutes to thicken. This substitute works well in air fryer recipes, though the flavour may differ slightly. For more baking substitutions, check our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>homepage</a>.</p>

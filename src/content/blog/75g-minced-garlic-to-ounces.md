<p>75g of minced garlic equals approximately 2.65 ounces. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements ensure the best flavour and texture. Whether you're making garlic butter shrimp or a savoury marinade, knowing the exact weight helps avoid overpowering or underwhelming your dish. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we focus on accuracy to elevate your cooking. Keep reading for tips on measuring minced garlic and using it in your air fryer.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on even heat distribution, so ingredient quantities must be precise. Too much minced garlic can burn, while too little may leave your dish bland. Converting 75g minced garlic to ounces (2.65 oz) ensures consistency across recipes. This is especially useful for dishes like garlic bread or roasted vegetables, where balance is key. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more handy measurements.</p>  

<p>Minced garlic packs a punch, so measuring correctly prevents waste. A kitchen scale is the most reliable tool, but if you don’t have one, 75g is roughly 5 tablespoons. For more recipe ideas, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipes</a> section, featuring garlic-infused favourites.</p>  

<h3>How to measure minced garlic without a scale</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a scale, use tablespoons: 1 tablespoon of minced garlic weighs about 15g. So, 75g would be 5 tablespoons. This method works well for most <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable-based recipes</a>. Remember, freshly minced garlic has a stronger flavour than pre-packaged, so adjust accordingly.</p>  

<h2>Using 75g minced garlic in air fryer recipes</h2>  
<p>Garlic adds depth to air-fried dishes like chicken wings or roasted potatoes. For 75g (2.65 oz), mix it with olive oil and herbs for a marinade. Spread it evenly to avoid clumping, which can cause uneven cooking. Discover more tips in our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning guide</a> to keep your air fryer in top shape.</p>  

<p>Pre-minced garlic saves time, but fresh garlic offers a brighter taste. If substituting, note that 75g of fresh garlic yields slightly less when minced. For recipes like garlic butter shrimp, accuracy ensures the perfect garlic-to-seafood ratio. Visit <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> for more inspiration.</p>  

<h3>Storing minced garlic for future use</h3>  
<p>Leftover minced garlic can be stored in the fridge for up to 2 weeks. Freeze it in ice cube trays (each cube holds about 15g) for easy portioning. This way, you’ll always have 75g (2.65 oz) ready for your next air fryer adventure.</p>

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on even heat distribution, and incorrect ingredient quantities can lead to uneven cooking. Too much tomato ketchup, for example, might make your food soggy, while too little could leave it dry. Measuring 100g of tomato ketchup in ounces (3.53 oz) ensures consistency, especially when following recipes from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>. This precision is particularly useful for marinades, glazes, or dipping sauces.</p>  

<p>Many UK cooks use grams, but some recipes list ingredients in ounces. Converting 100g of tomato ketchup to ounces helps avoid confusion and guarantees your dish tastes just right. If you’re working with frozen foods or meal prep, accurate conversions save time and reduce waste. For more tips, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/frozen-foods>frozen foods category</a>.</p>  

<h3>How to measure 100g of tomato ketchup without scales</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a kitchen scale, you can estimate 100g of tomato ketchup using tablespoons. Roughly 6-7 tablespoons equal 100g, but this can vary slightly depending on the brand’s thickness. For the most accurate results, invest in a digital scale—especially if you frequently use your air fryer for recipes like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken dishes</a>.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for 100g of tomato ketchup in air fryer recipes</h2>  
<p>Tomato ketchup isn’t just for burgers—it’s a versatile ingredient in air fryer cooking. A 100g portion (3.53 oz) works perfectly for glazing meatballs, coating chicken nuggets, or adding tang to homemade fries. Many of our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipes</a> use this measurement to balance sweetness and acidity. You can even mix it with spices for a quick marinade.</p>  

<p>For healthier alternatives, consider blending 100g of tomato ketchup with low-sugar or homemade versions. This ensures your air-fried meals stay delicious without excess additives.

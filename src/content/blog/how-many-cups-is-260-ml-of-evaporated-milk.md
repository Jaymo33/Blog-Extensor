<p>260 ml of evaporated milk is approximately 1.1 cups. This conversion is essential for recipes requiring precise measurements, especially in baking or air fryer cooking. Whether you're making a creamy dessert or a savoury dish, knowing how to convert 260 ml of evaporated milk to cups ensures consistency and perfect results every time.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Measurement Matters</h2>
<p>Using the correct amount of evaporated milk can make or break your recipe. Too little, and your dish might lack creaminess; too much, and it could become overly rich or soggy. For air fryer recipes, precise measurements are even more critical because the cooking process is faster and more intense. A slight deviation can affect texture and taste significantly.</p>
<p>At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we emphasise the importance of accurate conversions. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> is a handy tool for all your measurement needs, including liquids like evaporated milk. Bookmark it for quick reference!</p>

<h2>How to Measure 260 ml of Evaporated Milk</h2>
<p>If you don’t have a measuring jug with millilitre markings, you can use standard cups. One cup equals 240 ml, so 260 ml is just slightly more than a cup. For greater accuracy, use a tablespoon—15 ml per tablespoon—to add the extra 20 ml (about 1.3 tablespoons). This method ensures you hit the 260 ml mark perfectly.</p>
<p>For those who prefer visual aids, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipes section</a> includes step-by-step guides with photos to help you measure ingredients like evaporated milk correctly. It’s a great resource for beginners and seasoned cooks alike.</p>

<h3>US vs. UK Cup Measurements</h3>
<p>It’s worth noting that US and UK cup measurements differ slightly. A US cup is 240 ml, while a UK cup is 250 ml. For 260 ml of evaporated milk, this means 1.08 US cups or 1.04 UK cups. The difference is minimal but could matter in delicate recipes like custards or cakes.</p>

<h2>Common Uses for 260 ml of Evaporated Milk</h2>
<p>Evaporated milk is a versatile ingredient. It’s often used in desserts like fudge, pies, or flans, where its concentrated richness adds depth. In savoury dishes, it’s great for creamy sauces or soups. When using an air fryer, evaporated milk can help create a crispy yet moist coating for dishes like fried chicken or casseroles.</p>
<p>Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert category</a> for inspiration on how to use 260 ml of evaporated milk in sweet treats. From air-fryer cheesecakes to custards, the possibilities are endless!</p>

<h3>Substitutes for Evaporated Milk</h3>
<p>If you’re out of evaporated milk, you can make a substitute by simmering regular milk to reduce it by half. For 260 ml, start with 520 ml of whole milk and gently cook until it reaches the desired volume. Alternatively, mix 160 ml of fresh milk with 100 ml of cream for a similar richness.</p>

<h2>Tips for Storing Evaporated Milk</h2>
<p>Once opened, evaporated milk should be refrigerated and used within a few days. Transfer any unused portions to an airtight container to maintain freshness. For longer storage, freeze it in ice cube trays—each cube is roughly 30 ml, making it easy to measure out 260 ml (about 8.5 cubes) for future recipes.</p>
<p>Proper storage ensures your evaporated milk stays fresh for dishes like our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>air-fryer cakes</a>, where quality ingredients make all the difference. Don’t let waste ruin your cooking plans!</p>

<p>260 ml of evaporated milk is approximately 1.1 cups. This conversion is essential for recipes requiring precise measurements, especially in baking or air fryer cooking. Whether you're making a creamy dessert or a savoury dish, knowing how to convert 260 ml of evaporated milk to cups ensures consistency and perfect results every time.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Measurement Matters</h2>
<p>Using the correct amount of evaporated milk can make or break your recipe. Too little, and your dish might lack creaminess; too much, and it could become overly rich or soggy. For air fryer recipes, precise measurements are even more critical because the cooking process is faster and more intense. A slight deviation can affect texture and taste significantly.</p>

<h2>How to Measure 260 ml of Evaporated Milk</h2>
<p>If you don’t have a measuring jug with millilitre markings, you can use standard cups. One cup equals 240 ml, so 260 ml is just slightly more than a cup. For greater accuracy, use a tablespoon—15 ml per tablespoon—to add the extra 20 ml (about 1.3 tablespoons). This method ensures you hit the 260 ml mark perfectly.</p>

<h3>US vs. UK Cup Measurements</h3>

<h2>Common Uses for 260 ml of Evaporated Milk</h2>
<p>Evaporated milk is a versatile ingredient. It’s often used in desserts like fudge, pies, or flans, where its concentrated richness adds depth.

<h3>Substitutes for Evaporated Milk</h3>
<p>If you’re out of evaporated milk, you can make a substitute by simmering regular milk to reduce it by half. For 260 ml, start with 520 ml of whole milk and gently cook until it reaches the desired volume. Alternatively, mix 160 ml of fresh milk with 100 ml of cream for a similar richness.</p>

<h2>Tips for Storing Evaporated Milk</h2>
<p>Once opened, evaporated milk should be refrigerated and used within a few days. Transfer any unused portions to an airtight container to maintain freshness. For longer storage, freeze it in ice cube trays—each cube is roughly 30 ml, making it easy to measure out 260 ml (about 8.5 cubes) for future recipes.</p>

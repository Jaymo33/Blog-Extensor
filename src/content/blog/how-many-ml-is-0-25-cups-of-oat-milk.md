<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on precise ingredient ratios to achieve the best texture and flavour. Using 0.25 cups of oat milk in ml (59 ml) ensures your recipes aren’t too dry or too runny.

This method is handy for quick adjustments, especially when preparing smaller batches in your air fryer.</p>  

<h2>Converting 0.25 Cups of Oat Milk for Baking</h2>

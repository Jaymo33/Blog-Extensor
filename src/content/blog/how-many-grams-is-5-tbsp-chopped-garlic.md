<p>5 tablespoons (tbsp) of chopped garlic equals approximately 75 grams (g). This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements can make all the difference in flavour and texture.</p>

<h2>Why accurate garlic measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of garlic ensures your dishes are perfectly seasoned without overpowering other ingredients. In an air fryer, ingredients cook quickly, so precise measurements prevent burnt or unevenly cooked garlic. Too much garlic can also leave a bitter taste, while too little might not deliver the desired flavour punch. For more air fryer tips, visit <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>.</p>  

<p>Garlic is a staple in many air fryer recipes, from roasted vegetables to marinated meats. Knowing the exact weight helps you follow recipes accurately, especially when scaling up or down. Whether you’re making garlic butter shrimp or crispy garlic potatoes, 5 tbsp of chopped garlic (75g) will give you consistent results every time.</p>  

<h3>How to measure chopped garlic correctly</h3>  
<p>For the most accurate measurement, use a kitchen scale to weigh your chopped garlic. If you don’t have one, lightly pack the garlic into the tablespoon without pressing too hard. Avoid heaping tablespoons, as this can lead to uneven measurements. For more conversion help, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>  

<h2>Common recipes using 5 tbsp of chopped garlic</h2>  
<p>Many air fryer recipes call for 5 tbsp of chopped garlic, especially those with bold flavours. Dishes like garlic butter chicken, roasted garlic mushrooms, or garlic-infused oils rely on this measurement. Visit our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipes section</a> for inspiration.</p>  

<p>Garlic-heavy dishes like garlic bread or garlic prawns often use this quantity to achieve a rich, aromatic taste. If you’re meal prepping, knowing the gram equivalent helps you batch-cook efficiently. For example, 5 tbsp (75g) of chopped garlic is perfect for marinating a whole chicken or a large tray of vegetables.</p>  

<h3>Adjusting garlic quantities for different dishes</h3>  
<p>If you prefer milder garlic flavours, reduce the amount slightly—try 4 tbsp (60g). For stronger tastes, increase to 6 tbsp (90g). Remember, air fryers intensify flavours due to their concentrated heat, so adjust accordingly. Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipes</a> for garlic-forward ideas.</p>  

<h2>Tips for storing chopped garlic</h2>  
<p>Freshly chopped garlic can be stored in an airtight container in the fridge for up to a week. For longer storage, freeze it in ice cube trays with a bit of oil. This way, you’ll always have pre-measured garlic ready for your air fryer creations.</p>  

<p>If you’re using pre-chopped garlic from a jar, note that it may weigh slightly more due to added preservatives. Always check the label for exact conversions. For more storage hacks, visit <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner tips</a>.</p>

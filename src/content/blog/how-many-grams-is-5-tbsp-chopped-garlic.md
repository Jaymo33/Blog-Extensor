<p>5 tablespoons (tbsp) of chopped garlic equals approximately 75 grams (g). This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements can make all the difference in flavour and texture.</p>

<h2>Why accurate garlic measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of garlic ensures your dishes are perfectly seasoned without overpowering other ingredients. In an air fryer, ingredients cook quickly, so precise measurements prevent burnt or unevenly cooked garlic. Too much garlic can also leave a bitter taste, while too little might not deliver the desired flavour punch.

<p>Garlic is a staple in many air fryer recipes, from roasted vegetables to marinated meats. Knowing the exact weight helps you follow recipes accurately, especially when scaling up or down.

<h3>How to measure chopped garlic correctly</h3>  
<p>For the most accurate measurement, use a kitchen scale to weigh your chopped garlic. If you don’t have one, lightly pack the garlic into the tablespoon without pressing too hard.

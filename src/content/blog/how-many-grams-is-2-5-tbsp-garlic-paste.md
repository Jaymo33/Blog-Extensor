<p>2.5 tablespoons (tbsp) of garlic paste equals approximately 37.5 grams (g). This conversion is essential for precise cooking, especially when using an air fryer, where accurate measurements can make or break a dish. Whether you’re whipping up a marinade or seasoning your ingredients, knowing the exact weight ensures consistency. For more air fryer measurement tips, visit <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>our conversion chart</a>.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on even heat distribution, so ingredient proportions must be spot-on. Too much garlic paste can overpower a dish, while too little might leave it bland. Converting 2.5 tbsp of garlic paste to grams (37.5g) helps maintain balance. This precision is particularly useful for recipes like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>garlic chicken</a> or roasted vegetables. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a> for more inspiration.</p>  

<p>Garlic paste is denser than minced garlic, so volume-to-weight conversions differ. A standard UK tablespoon holds 15g of garlic paste, making 2.5 tbsp equal to 37.5g. This measurement is crucial for air fryer recipes, where overcrowding or uneven seasoning affects results. Always level your tablespoons for accuracy, and consider using a kitchen scale for reliability.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure Garlic Paste Without a Scale</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a scale, use the spoon-and-level method for 2.5 tbsp of garlic paste. Fill the tablespoon evenly, scraping off excess with a knife. Repeat for the half tablespoon (1.5 tsp) to total 37.5g. For sticky ingredients like garlic paste, lightly oil the spoon first to prevent sticking. Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning tips</a> to keep your tools in top shape.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for 2.5 Tbsp of Garlic Paste</h2>  
<p>This quantity (37.5g) is perfect for marinades, sauces, or seasoning proteins like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/shrimp>garlic shrimp</a>. In air fryers, garlic paste caramelizes quickly, adding depth to dishes. Try mixing it with olive oil for roasted potatoes or blending it into dips. For larger batches, scale up proportionally—5 tbsp would be 75g. Discover more ideas in our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable recipes</a>.</p>  

<p>Garlic paste’s concentrated flavor means a little goes a long way. Store leftovers in an airtight container in the fridge for up to two weeks. For longer storage, freeze portions in ice cube trays (each cube ≈ 1 tbsp or 15g). Thaw as needed for future air fryer meals. Proper storage ensures you always have the right amount on hand.</p>  

<h3>Converting Other Garlic Measurements</h3>  
<p>If a recipe calls for fresh garlic instead of paste, 1 clove ≈ 1 tsp minced garlic or 5g paste. Adjustments may be needed based on potency. For 2.5 tbsp of garlic paste (37.5g), you’d need about 7-8 cloves. Always taste-test when substituting forms. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> guides simplify these swaps for stress-free cooking.</p>

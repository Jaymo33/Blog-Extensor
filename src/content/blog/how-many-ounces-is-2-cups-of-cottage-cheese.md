For example, if you're making a <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/breakfast>breakfast casserole</a>, 16 ounces of cottage cheese provides the ideal creamy texture. Many UK cooks rely on cups, but ounces give a more precise measurement for consistent results.

<h3>How to measure cottage cheese for air fryer recipes</h3>  
<p>The easiest way to measure cottage cheese is by using a kitchen scale for ounces. If you don't have one, spoon the cottage cheese into a measuring cup without packing it down. For 2 cups, you'll need about 16 ounces, which is roughly the size of a standard UK tub. This method works well for recipes like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>cheesecake bites</a> or stuffed mushrooms. Remember, air fryers cook quickly, so precise measurements prevent overcooking or undercooking.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for 2 cups of cottage cheese in air frying</h2>  
<p>Two cups (16 ounces) of cottage cheese can be used in countless air fryer recipes. Try mixing it into mashed potatoes for extra creaminess or using it as a filling for stuffed peppers. It's also a great base for high-protein dips or as a topping for <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer baked potatoes</a>. The mild flavour of cottage cheese pairs well with herbs and spices, making it a versatile ingredient. Whether you're cooking for one or meal prepping, 16 ounces is a handy quantity to work with.</p>

<h3>Tips for substituting cottage cheese in recipes</h3>  
<p>If you're out of cottage cheese, ricotta or Greek yogurt can work as substitutes, but the texture will vary. Keep in mind that 2 cups of these alternatives may weigh slightly different in ounces. For best results in air fryer recipes, stick to the original measurement of 16 ounces whenever possible. This ensures your dishes have the right consistency and cook evenly in the air fryer.</p>

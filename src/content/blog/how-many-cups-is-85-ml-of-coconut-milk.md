<p>85 ml of coconut milk equals approximately 0.36 cups (just over 1/3 cup). This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precision matters, especially when working with rich ingredients like coconut milk. Whether you’re whipping up a curry or baking a dessert, knowing this measurement ensures consistent results every time.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>
<p>Air fryers rely on precise ingredient ratios to achieve the perfect texture and flavour. Too much or too little coconut milk can throw off the balance of your dish. For example, adding 85 ml of coconut milk (0.36 cups) to a marinade ensures even coating without sogginess. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more handy tips.</p>
<p>Coconut milk adds creaminess to dishes like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>air fryer chicken curry</a> or <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>desserts</a>. Measuring 85 ml correctly (0.36 cups) guarantees the right consistency. If you’re using tinned coconut milk, stir it well before measuring to incorporate the cream and liquid.</p>

<h3>How to Measure 85 ml of Coconut Milk Without a Scale</h3>
<p>If you don’t have a measuring jug, use a standard tablespoon: 85 ml is roughly 5.5 tablespoons. For cups, fill just over 1/3 of a standard 240 ml cup. Visit <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> for more measurement hacks and <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe ideas</a>.</p>

<h2>Converting 85 ml of Coconut Milk for Different Recipes</h2>
<p>Whether you’re making a Thai-inspired dish or a vegan dessert, 85 ml of coconut milk (0.36 cups) is a common measurement. For savoury dishes, this amount adds richness without overpowering other flavours. In baking, it keeps cakes moist—try it in our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>air fryer cake recipes</a>.</p>
<p>Remember that coconut milk brands vary in thickness. For thicker milk, 85 ml might measure slightly less in cups due to density. Always adjust cooking times in your air fryer if the consistency changes.</p>

<h3>Common Mistakes When Measuring Coconut Milk</h3>
<p>Avoid pouring straight from the tin—it’s easy to misjudge 85 ml. Instead, use a clear measuring cup at eye level. For sticky coconut cream, lightly grease the cup first. Need cleaning tips?

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of liquid, like 210 ml of water, can affect texture and cooking time in your air fryer. Too much water might make food soggy, while too little could dry it out. Many air fryer recipes rely on precise measurements to achieve that perfect crispiness. If you're new to air frying, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a> offers plenty of inspiration with clear measurements.</p>  

<p>Measuring 210 ml of water correctly ensures your dishes turn out as intended. A slight variation can alter the outcome, especially in baking. For example, a cake batter with too much liquid might not rise properly. Always use a measuring jug or digital scale for accuracy. If you're unsure, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert recipes</a> include foolproof measurements.</p>  

<h3>UK vs. US Cup Measurements</h3>  
<p>In the UK, 1 cup is 250 ml, so 210 ml of water is roughly 0.89 cups. In the US, 1 cup is 240 ml, making 210 ml about 0.88 cups. This small difference might not seem significant, but it can matter in precise recipes. Always check whether your recipe uses UK or US measurements to avoid mistakes.</p>  

<h2>How to Measure 210 ml of Water Without a Measuring Cup</h2>  
<p>If you don't have a measuring cup, you can use a standard mug or glass to estimate 210 ml of water.

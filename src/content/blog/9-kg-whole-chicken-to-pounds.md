The internal temperature should reach 75°C in the thickest part of the thigh.\n\nDue to the extended cooking time, you may need to pause and rotate the chicken periodically for even browning. Consider cooking in parts if your air fryer struggles with such a large item, and always allow the chicken to rest before carving to retain juices."

<h2>Practical tips for cooking a 9 kg whole chicken in your air fryer</h2>
<p>Cooking a 9 kg whole chicken in your air fryer requires some preparation due to its size. First, ensure your air fryer basket is large enough to accommodate the chicken without overcrowding.

Preheating your air fryer can help achieve a crispy skin from the start.</p>

<h3>9 kg whole chicken pounds converter tools</h3>
<p>If you frequently need to convert weights like 9 kg whole chicken to pounds, using an online converter can save time. Many websites and apps offer instant conversions between kilograms and pounds.

Always use the most precise conversion available for best results in your air fryer cooking.</p>
<p>Another pitfall is not considering the exact weight when following air fryer cooking times. A 9 kg whole chicken to pounds conversion might be approximate, but your actual chicken could weigh slightly more or less.

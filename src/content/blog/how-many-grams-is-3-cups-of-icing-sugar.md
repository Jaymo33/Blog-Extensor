<p>3.0 cups of icing sugar equals approximately 360 grams. This conversion is essential for baking precision, especially when using an air fryer for desserts like cakes or cookies. Getting the measurement right ensures your recipes turn out perfectly every time.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Baking</h2>  
<p>Baking is a science, and even small measurement discrepancies can affect texture and taste. Icing sugar, also known as powdered sugar, is often used in frostings, glazes, and delicate desserts. Converting 3.0 cups of icing sugar to grams ensures consistency, whether you're following a British or American recipe. For more baking tips, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer dessert recipes</a>.</p>  

<p>Using a kitchen scale is the most reliable method, as cup measurements can vary based on how the sugar is packed. If you're adapting a recipe for your air fryer, precise grams help maintain the right moisture balance. Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for other common ingredient conversions.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure Icing Sugar Correctly</h3>  
<p>Spoon the icing sugar into your measuring cup lightly without packing it down, then level it off with a knife. This avoids over-measuring, which can make frostings too sweet or dense. For air fryer baking, where even heat distribution is key, accuracy ensures your desserts cook evenly.</p>  

<h2>UK vs. US Cup Measurements</h2>  
<p>While 3.0 cups of icing sugar in the UK and US both convert to roughly 360 grams, slight differences exist due to cup sizing standards. British cups are typically 250ml, whereas American cups are 240ml. For air fryer recipes, sticking to weight (grams) eliminates confusion. Find more measurement guides at <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>.</p>  

<p>If your recipe specifies 3.0 cups of icing sugar in grams, itâ€™s safest to weigh it. This is especially useful for air fryer bakes, where precise ratios affect cooking times. For cleaning tips after sugary bakes, see our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner guide</a>.</p>  

<h3>Common Recipes Using 3.0 Cups of Icing Sugar</h3>  
<p>This quantity is perfect for buttercream frosting, glaze for doughnuts, or dusting over air-fried churros. Whether you're baking a classic Victoria sponge or trying <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>air fryer cakes</a>, knowing the gram equivalent saves time and hassle.</p>

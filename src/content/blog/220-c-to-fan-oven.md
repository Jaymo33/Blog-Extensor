<p>220 C in a fan oven is equivalent to 200 C, as fan ovens circulate hot air for even cooking, allowing you to reduce the temperature by 20 degrees. This adjustment ensures your food cooks evenly without drying out or burning. Whether you're baking, roasting, or air frying, understanding this conversion is key to perfect results.

<h2>Why Convert 220 C to Fan Oven?</h2>  
<p>Fan ovens distribute heat more efficiently than conventional ovens, so lowering the temperature prevents overcooking. Recipes often list temperatures for traditional ovens, so converting 220 C to fan oven settings (200 C) ensures accuracy. This is especially useful for baking cakes or roasting meats, where precise heat matters. If you're using an air fryer, the same principle applies—reduce the temperature slightly for even crisping. Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a> for fan-oven-friendly dishes.</p>  

<p>Many UK kitchens rely on fan ovens, making this conversion a daily necessity. For example, a classic Victoria sponge baked at 220 C in a conventional oven would need just 200 C in a fan oven. The same logic applies to air fryers, which work similarly to fan ovens but with faster cooking times. Always preheat your appliance for consistent results, and consider using an oven thermometer for precision.</p>  

<h3>How Does This Apply to Air Fryers?</h3>  
<p>Air fryers use rapid air technology, much like fan ovens, so the 220 C to fan oven rule often translates directly. If a recipe calls for 220 C in a conventional oven, try 200 C in your air fryer for similar results. However, cooking times may be shorter, so keep an eye on your food. For crispy favourites like roast potatoes or chicken wings, this adjustment is a game-changer. Need cleaning tips?

<h2>Common Uses for 220 C in Fan Ovens</h2>  
<p>This temperature is ideal for roasting vegetables, baking bread, or crisping up frozen foods. At 200 C (fan), you'll achieve golden, evenly cooked dishes without hot spots. For example, roasting Brussels sprouts at this temperature caramelises them perfectly. Air fryers excel here too—try our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable recipes</a> for inspiration.</p>  

<p>Another great use is baking cookies; reducing 220 C to 200 C in a fan oven prevents burnt edges. The same goes for air-frying frozen snacks like spring rolls—adjusting the temperature ensures a crisp exterior without sogginess. Always shuffle trays or baskets midway for even browning, especially in larger ovens or multi-layer air fryers.</p>  

<h3>Tips for Perfect Conversions</h3>  
<p>When converting 220 C to fan oven settings, also consider your appliance's quirks. Some models run hotter or cooler, so a trial run with simple dishes helps. For air fryers, start checking food 5-10 minutes earlier than the recipe suggests.

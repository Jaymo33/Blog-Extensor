<p>0.5 cups of coconut milk equals 118.29 ml, making it easy to measure for your air fryer recipes. Whether you’re whipping up a curry, baking a cake, or preparing a creamy sauce, knowing this conversion ensures accuracy in your cooking. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we understand how precise measurements can elevate your dishes, especially when using an air fryer.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of coconut milk can make or break a recipe. Too little, and your dish might lack creaminess; too much, and it could become overly soggy. Air fryers cook food quickly and evenly, so precise measurements help maintain the perfect texture. For example, if you’re making a Thai-inspired curry in your air fryer, 0.5 cups (118.29 ml) of coconut milk will blend perfectly with your spices and proteins.</p>  

<p>Many air fryer recipes, like those found on our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipes page</a>, rely on exact liquid measurements to ensure even cooking. Coconut milk is a common ingredient in both sweet and savoury dishes, from dairy-free desserts to rich stews. Measuring it correctly ensures your meals turn out just as intended, whether you’re following a UK or US recipe.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure 0.5 Cups of Coconut Milk Without a Measuring Cup</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a measuring cup handy, you can still measure 0.5 cups of coconut milk using a kitchen scale. One ml of coconut milk weighs roughly 1 gram, so 118.29 ml would be about 118 grams. Alternatively, a standard UK tablespoon holds 15 ml, meaning 8 tablespoons (or 4 dessert spoons) will give you close to 118 ml. For more conversion tips, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for 0.5 Cups of Coconut Milk in Air Fryer Recipes</h2>  
<p>This measurement is perfect for small-batch cooking, such as single-serve desserts or marinades. For instance, a creamy coconut milk marinade for chicken or tofu only needs 0.5 cups (118.29 ml) to coat your protein evenly before air frying. You’ll find plenty of inspiration in our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipes</a> section.</p>  

<p>Coconut milk is also great for baking in the air fryer. A half-cup (118.29 ml) can be used in dairy-free cakes or muffins, adding moisture without overwhelming the batter. If you’re experimenting with vegan air fryer desserts, this measurement is a handy starting point. For more ideas, browse our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert recipes</a>.</p>  

<h3>Does the Type of Coconut Milk Affect the Measurement?</h3>  
<p>Full-fat and light coconut milk have slightly different densities, but the ml measurement remains the same for 0.5 cups. However, full-fat coconut milk may thicken when chilled, so stirring it before measuring ensures accuracy. If you’re using canned coconut milk, shake the tin well to blend the cream and liquid for a consistent measurement.</p>  

<h2>Converting Other Coconut Milk Measurements for Air Fryer Recipes</h2>  
<p>If your recipe calls for a different amount, here’s a quick reference: 1 cup of coconut milk equals 236.59 ml, while 1/4 cup is 59.15 ml. These conversions are useful when scaling recipes up or down for your air fryer. For more detailed guides, visit <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>.</p>  

<p>Remember, air fryers excel at cooking with minimal oil, so coconut milk can add richness without excess fat. Whether you’re making a curry, soup, or dessert, precise measurements help you achieve the best results. Keep our conversion tips handy for stress-free cooking every time.</p>

<p>0.375 cup of baking powder equals approximately 3 ounces. This conversion is essential for precise baking, especially when using an air fryer where measurements can make or break a recipe. Whether you're whipping up cakes, cookies, or savoury dishes, knowing the exact weight ensures consistency. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we focus on helping you get the best results with accurate conversions.</p>

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer baking</h2>
<p>Baking powder is a leavening agent, and even small deviations can affect the texture and rise of your baked goods. In an air fryer, where heat distribution is rapid, precise measurements are even more critical. Too much baking powder can lead to a bitter taste, while too little might result in dense, flat treats. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> simplifies these calculations for you.</p>
<p>For example, if you're making air fryer cakes or muffins, 0.375 cup of baking powder (3 ounces) is often the perfect amount for light, fluffy results. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipes</a> section for inspiration on how to use this measurement in delicious dishes.</p>

<h2>How to measure 0.375 cup of baking powder</h2>
<p>Measuring 0.375 cup of baking powder can be tricky if you don’t have a 3/8 cup measure. Here’s a simple trick: use a 1/4 cup measure and fill it halfway again. Alternatively, weigh it out on a kitchen scale for absolute precision. A digital scale set to ounces will show you exactly 3 ounces for 0.375 cup.</p>

<h3>Using a kitchen scale for accuracy</h3>
<p>If you're serious about baking, investing in a kitchen scale is a game-changer. It eliminates guesswork and ensures your 0.375 cup of baking powder translates perfectly to 3 ounces. This is particularly useful for air fryer recipes, where consistency is key. Browse our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>cake recipes</a> to see how precise measurements elevate your baking.</p>

<h2>Common recipes using 0.375 cup baking powder</h2>
<p>Many air fryer recipes call for 0.375 cup of baking powder, especially those designed for fluffy textures. Classic examples include scones, pancakes, and certain types of bread. The 3-ounce measurement ensures the right amount of lift without overpowering the flavour.</p>
<p>For savoury dishes, like air fryer onion rings or tempura, 0.375 cup of baking powder (3 ounces) can create a light, crispy coating. Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable recipes</a> for creative ways to use this measurement.</p>

<h3>Adjusting for altitude or humidity</h3>
<p>If you live in a high-altitude or humid area, you might need to tweak the 0.375 cup (3 ounces) of baking powder slightly. Humidity can affect how baking powder reacts, so keep an eye on your batter’s consistency.

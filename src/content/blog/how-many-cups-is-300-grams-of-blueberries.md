<p>300 grams of blueberries is roughly equivalent to 2.4 US cups or 2 UK cups. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements ensure even cooking and perfect results. Whether you're making blueberry muffins or a fruity compote, knowing how to convert grams to cups makes all the difference.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Blueberry Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of blueberries ensures your air fryer recipes turn out as intended. Too many berries can make dishes soggy, while too few might leave them dry. For example, our <a href="https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes">blueberry muffin recipe</a> relies on this exact conversion for fluffy, evenly baked results. Measuring correctly also helps with portion control, especially if you're meal prepping or following a specific diet.</p>  

<p>Blueberries vary slightly in size, but 300 grams generally fills just over two standard US cups. If you're in the UK, where cup sizes differ slightly, it's closer to two full cups. Always lightly pack the berries when measuring—don’t crush them, but ensure there are no large gaps. This method gives the most consistent results for air frying or baking.</p>  

<h3>US vs. UK Cup Measurements</h3>  
<p>In the US, a standard cup holds 240ml, while a UK cup is 250ml. This small difference means 300 grams of blueberries equals about 2.4 US cups or 2 UK cups. If you're using a kitchen scale, weighing is the most accurate method. For those without scales, our <a href="https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart">air fryer conversion chart</a> simplifies these calculations for all your cooking needs.</p>  

<h2>Converting Grams to Cups for Air Fryer Recipes</h2>  
<p>Air fryers cook food quickly and evenly, but precise measurements are crucial. Whether you're making a blueberry crumble or adding berries to pancakes, 300 grams translates to just over two cups.

<p>If you're scaling a recipe up or down, remember that 150 grams of blueberries equals roughly 1.2 US cups or 1 UK cup. This makes it easy to adjust portion sizes without guesswork. For best results, always use the same measuring system (metric or imperial) throughout your recipe to avoid inconsistencies.</p>  

<h3>Tips for Measuring Blueberries</h3>  
<p>For the most accurate measurement, use a kitchen scale. If you don’t have one, gently fill your measuring cup without packing the berries too tightly. Avoid shaking or tapping the cup, as this can compress the fruit and lead to over-measuring. For sticky recipes like compotes, slightly heaping cups are fine, but precision matters in baked goods.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for 300 Grams of Blueberries</h2>

If you're meal prepping, 300 grams divides neatly into four 75-gram servings for yogurt toppings or smoothies.

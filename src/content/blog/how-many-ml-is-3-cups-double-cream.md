<h3>How to Measure Double Cream Correctly</h3>

<h2>Converting Cups to ml for Different Ingredients</h2>  
<p>While 3.0 cups of double cream equals 710 ml, other ingredients may vary. For example, 3.0 cups of flour or sugar won’t convert the same way due to density differences.

This is especially important for air fryer baking, where precision matters.</p>

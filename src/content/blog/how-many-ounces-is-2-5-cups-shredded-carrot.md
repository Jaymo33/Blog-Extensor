<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on precise cooking times and temperatures, making ingredient measurements crucial. Too much or too little shredded carrot can affect texture and cooking time.

<h3>How to measure shredded carrot correctly</h3>  
<p>For the most accurate conversion from cups to ounces, lightly pack the shredded carrot into the measuring cup without pressing too firmly. Overpacking can lead to more carrot than needed, while loosely filling may result in less. If you have a kitchen scale, weighing 10 ounces (283 grams) is the most reliable method.</p>

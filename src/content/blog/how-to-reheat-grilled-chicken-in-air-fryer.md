<p>To reheat grilled chicken in an air fryer, set it to 160°C (320°F) for 3-5 minutes until piping hot. This method preserves moisture while crisping the skin better than a microwave. Your air fryer circulates hot air around the chicken, reviving its texture without the sogginess or uneven heating of other methods.</p>

<h2>Why Use an Air Fryer for Reheating Grilled Chicken?</h2>
<p>Air fryers excel at reheating grilled chicken because their rapid air circulation mimics the original cooking process. Unlike microwaves that steam food, air fryers restore crispiness to the skin while maintaining tender meat inside. The compact size also means faster preheating compared to conventional ovens, making it ideal for quick meals. At airfryerrecipe.co.uk, we’ve tested this method across multiple <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipes</a> with consistent success. Whether you’re reheating last night’s dinner or meal-prepped chicken, this appliance delivers superior results.</p>

<p>Another advantage is temperature control – most air fryers allow precise settings between 120°C and 200°C. This range lets you gently warm delicate chicken breasts at lower heats or crisp up thighs and drumsticks more aggressively. According to our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>, 160°C strikes the perfect balance for most grilled chicken cuts. The enclosed cooking space also prevents the dry-out effect you’d get from reheating under a grill or in a toaster oven.</p>

<h3>Preparing Your Chicken for Reheating</h3>
<p>Start by patting the chicken dry with kitchen paper – any surface moisture will hinder crisping. For bone-in pieces, consider lightly brushing with oil to help conductivity, especially if the skin looks dry. Arrange pieces in a single layer with space between them; overcrowding causes steaming. If reheating a large batch, work in stages or use an <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner</a> between loads to maintain performance.</p>

<h2>Optimal Temperature and Time Settings</h2>
<p>The safest temperature to reheat grilled chicken in an air fryer is 160°C (320°F), ensuring thorough heating without overcooking. At this temperature, boneless cuts typically need 3 minutes, while bone-in pieces may require 4-5 minutes. Always check that the internal temperature reaches 74°C (165°F) using a meat thermometer. Our testing at airfryerrecipe.co.uk found these settings work for most <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> involving reheated poultry.</p>

<p>For extra crispy skin, some models have a ‘reheat’ preset or you can manually increase to 175°C (350°F) for the last minute. Be cautious with thin cuts like chicken escalopes – they reheat in just 2-2.5 minutes at 150°C (300°F). If your chicken was originally marinated or sauced, place a piece of foil underneath to catch drips and prevent smoking. The air fryer’s efficiency means even cold chicken straight from the fridge reheats evenly without the dreaded dry edges.</p>

<h3>Techniques for Different Chicken Cuts</h3>
<p>Bone-in thighs benefit from starting skin-side down, then flipping halfway. Chicken breasts should be lightly spritzed with water or broth if they appear dry. For shredded chicken, spread it thinly on parchment paper and stir midway. Drumsticks reheat best when stood upright in the basket to expose all surfaces to airflow. Always let reheated chicken rest for 1-2 minutes before serving – this allows juices to redistribute.</p>

<h2>Troubleshooting Common Reheating Issues</h2>
<p>If your reheated grilled chicken turns out dry, try lowering the temperature by 10°C next time and adding a minute. Uneven heating often means the pieces are too crowded – air fryers need space for proper circulation. For chicken that’s hot outside but cold inside, check your appliance’s calibration with an oven thermometer. Some users report success by placing a small oven-safe dish of water in the basket to create steam.</p>

<p>Smoking usually indicates fat dripping onto heating elements – use the drip tray or foil barrier mentioned earlier. If the skin becomes too dark, cover problem areas with foil strips during reheating. Remember that air fryers vary by model, so our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a> provides adjustments for different capacities. With practice, you’ll learn your appliance’s quirks for perfect reheating every time.</p>

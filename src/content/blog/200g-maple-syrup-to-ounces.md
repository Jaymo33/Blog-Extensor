Whether you're drizzling it over air-fried pancakes or using it in a glaze, precise measurements matter. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we know accuracy makes all the difference in cooking. Let’s dive deeper into why this conversion matters and how to use it.</p>  

<h2>Why Convert 200g of Maple Syrup to Ounces?</h2>  
<p>Many UK recipes use grams, while others rely on ounces, especially for baking or air fryer dishes. Converting 200g of maple syrup to ounces ensures consistency, whether you're following a British or international recipe. Maple syrup’s thickness means volume measures (like tablespoons) can vary, but weight is always precise. For air fryer cooking, where timing and ratios are key, accuracy prevents soggy or overly sweet results. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more handy tips.</p>  

<p>Air fryer recipes, like sticky glazed salmon or maple-roasted vegetables, often call for small syrup quantities. A slight mismeasurement could throw off the balance.

<h3>How to Measure 200g of Maple Syrup Accurately</h3>  
<p>Use a digital kitchen scale for the most reliable results. Place your container on the scale, tare it to zero, then pour the syrup until it hits 200g. If you don’t have a scale, 200g of maple syrup is roughly ⅔ cup, but this can vary with density. For sticky ingredients like syrup, a silicone spatula helps scrape every last gram.

<p>This quantity is perfect for glazes, marinades, or drizzles. Try brushing 200g of maple syrup over air-fried bacon for a sweet-savory twist, or mix it with mustard for a chicken glaze. It’s also ideal for desserts—think maple-coated nuts or air-fried apple slices. Since 200g maple syrup to ounces is 7.05 oz, you can easily halve or double recipes.

Always preheat your air fryer to avoid uneven cooking. For sticky meats like ribs, apply the syrup in the last 5 minutes to avoid mess. And remember: a little goes a long way—200g can cover multiple meals!</p>

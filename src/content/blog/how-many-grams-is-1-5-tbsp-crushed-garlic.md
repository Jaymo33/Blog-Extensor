    "@type": "Answer",
    "text": "Air fryers circulate hot air intensely, which can concentrate flavours. Try reducing to 1 tbsp (15g) crushed garlic if your dish tastes overpowering. Also, distribute garlic evenly—clumps burn and create bitter spots. Pre-mixing with oil helps disperse flavour more uniformly during cooking."

<p>1.5 tablespoons (tbsp) of crushed garlic equals approximately 22.5 grams (g). This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements can make or break your dish. Whether you’re whipping up garlic-infused chicken or roasted vegetables, knowing the exact weight ensures consistent flavour. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we help simplify kitchen maths so you can focus on cooking. Let’s dive deeper into why accurate conversions matter.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate garlic measurements matter in air frying</h2>  
<p>Air fryers cook food quickly and evenly, but too much or too little garlic can overpower or underwhelm your dish. Using 1.5 tbsp of crushed garlic (22.5g) guarantees balanced flavour without wasting ingredients. For example, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>garlic butter shrimp recipe</a> relies on this exact measurement for perfection. Overdoing garlic can also cause burning, leaving a bitter taste. Stick to 22.5g for foolproof results every time.</p>  

<p>Precision is especially crucial for meal preppers scaling recipes. If a dish calls for 1.5 tbsp of crushed garlic per serving, converting to grams (22.5g) ensures uniformity across batches. No more guessing—just consistent, restaurant-quality meals. Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more handy tips. Accurate measurements also help when substituting fresh garlic for jarred varieties, which can differ in density.</p>  

<h3>How to measure 1.5 tbsp of crushed garlic correctly</h3>  
<p>For the most accurate 1.5 tbsp (22.5g) measurement, use a flat-edged knife to level off the garlic in your spoon. Packed or heaped tablespoons can skew the weight by up to 5g. If using a kitchen scale, tare your bowl first, then add crushed garlic until it hits 22.5g. This method is foolproof for recipes like our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>garlic chicken thighs</a>, where precision is key.</p>  

<h2>Common mistakes when converting tbsp to grams</h2>  
<p>Many home cooks assume all ingredients weigh the same per tablespoon, but density varies wildly. For instance, 1.5 tbsp of minced garlic weighs slightly less than crushed (about 20g). Always check whether your recipe specifies crushed, minced, or pureed garlic. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> team verifies each conversion to eliminate guesswork. Another pitfall? Using US tablespoons (14.79ml) instead of UK (15ml), which affects the gram equivalent.</p>  

<p>Temperature also plays a role—cold garlic from the fridge is denser than room-temperature paste. For 1.5 tbsp (22.5g) of crushed garlic, let refrigerated jars sit for 10 minutes before measuring. This ensures your <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>garlic roasted veggies</a> turn out perfectly seasoned. When in doubt, weigh rather than scoop for air fryer success. Keep our conversion guide bookmarked for quick reference mid-recipe.</p>  

<h3>Garlic measurement tips for air fryer beginners</h3>  
<p>New to air frying? Start with 1.5 tbsp (22.5g) of crushed garlic as your baseline for single-serving recipes. Adjust up or down once you’ve tested your machine’s heating pattern—some models intensify flavours more than others. For cleaning sticky garlic residue, try our recommended <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner</a> to maintain your appliance. Remember: fresh garlic cloves yield about 1 tbsp (15g) when crushed, so you’d need 2-3 medium cloves for 1.5 tbsp (22.5g).</p>

<p>20g of butter equals approximately 0.71 ounces. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes, where precise measurements can make or break your dish. Whether you’re baking, frying, or melting butter for a recipe, knowing how to convert grams to ounces ensures accuracy. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we understand the importance of getting measurements right, especially when working with smaller quantities like 20g of butter.</p>  

<h2>Why Convert 20g of Butter to Ounces?</h2>  
<p>Many UK air fryer recipes use grams, but some kitchen scales or international recipes might list butter in ounces. Converting 20g of butter to ounces (0.71 oz) helps maintain consistency. This is particularly useful for baking, where precision matters. If you’re using an American recipe or a scale that only measures in ounces, this conversion will save you time and hassle.</p>  

<p>Butter is a common ingredient in air fryer recipes, from crispy coatings to rich desserts. Whether you’re making garlic butter prawns or a buttery cake, knowing how much 20g translates to in ounces ensures your dish turns out perfectly. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more handy measurement swaps.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure 20g of Butter Without a Scale</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a scale, you can still measure 20g of butter using tablespoons. One tablespoon of butter weighs about 14g, so 20g is roughly 1.5 tablespoons. For softer butter, pack it lightly into a measuring spoon for accuracy. This method works well for air fryer recipes where small adjustments matter.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for 20g of Butter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>20g of butter might seem like a small amount, but it’s perfect for adding richness to air fryer dishes. Use it to baste chicken, toss with vegetables, or drizzle over popcorn for a quick snack. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes</a>, we feature dozens of dishes where 20g of butter makes all the difference.</p>  

<p>For example, our garlic butter mushrooms recipe calls for precisely 20g of butter to coat the mushrooms evenly. Too much, and they’ll become greasy; too little, and they’ll dry out. This is why converting 20g of butter to ounces (0.71 oz) is so helpful—it ensures perfect results every time.</p>  

<h3>Butter Substitutes for 20g Measurements</h3>  
<p>If you’re out of butter, you can substitute 20g (0.71 oz) with margarine, coconut oil, or olive oil in most air fryer recipes. Each substitute will slightly alter the flavour and texture, so adjust accordingly. For baking, stick to butter for the best results, but for savoury dishes, alternatives work well.</p>  

<h2>Tips for Storing and Handling Butter</h2>  
<p>Butter should be stored in an airtight container in the fridge to maintain freshness. If you’re measuring 20g frequently, consider pre-portioning it into small cubes for convenience. For air fryer recipes, softened butter blends more easily with other ingredients, while cold butter works better for pastry.</p>  

<p>Cleaning your air fryer after cooking with butter is simple with our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner guide</a>. Butter can leave residue, so a quick wipe-down keeps your appliance in top condition. Whether you’re converting 20g to ounces or experimenting with new recipes, precise measurements lead to better cooking.</p>

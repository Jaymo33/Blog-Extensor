<p>163 C in a fan oven is equivalent to approximately 145 C when using conventional oven settings. This 20-degree reduction is standard for fan-assisted cooking, as the circulating air distributes heat more efficiently. When using your air fryer, which works similarly to a fan oven, you'll typically use the same temperature as a fan setting - making 163 C the ideal temperature for many recipes.</p>

<h2>Understanding Fan Oven Conversions</h2>
<p>The key principle when converting 163 C to fan oven is the 20-degree rule. Traditional ovens without fans require higher temperatures because heat isn't distributed as evenly. Fan ovens and air fryers both use forced air circulation, meaning you can achieve perfect results at slightly lower temperatures. This makes 163 C an excellent choice for delicate bakes that might brown too quickly in conventional ovens.</p>
<p>Many modern recipes at <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes</a> now specify fan oven temperatures precisely because they're more consistent. When you see 163 C in a recipe, it's typically written with fan ovens in mind. If you're adapting an older recipe that doesn't specify, simply reduce the suggested temperature by 20 degrees when using your fan oven or air fryer.</p>

<h2>Air Fryer Temperature Equivalents</h2>
<p>Your air fryer essentially functions as a compact fan oven, making 163 C an ideal temperature for many dishes. At this setting, you can achieve perfect crispness without drying out your food. The circulating hot air mimics professional convection ovens, cooking food evenly from all angles. This is why 163 C works so well for everything from roasted vegetables to baked goods.</p>
<p>For specific air fryer recipes, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> which includes detailed temperature guides. Remember that cooking times may vary slightly between fan ovens and air fryers due to size differences, but the temperature principles remain the same. At 163 C, you're in the sweet spot for most balanced cooking.</p>

<h3>Best Uses for 163 C in Fan Ovens</h3>
<p>163 C is particularly good for delicate cakes, biscuits, and pastries that need gentle, even heat. The fan setting prevents hot spots that can cause uneven baking. It's also excellent for roasting vegetables - the circulating air helps achieve that perfect caramelisation without burning. Many of our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>cake recipes</a> specifically recommend 163 C for optimal results.</p>

<h3>Adjusting Cooking Times</h3>
<p>While 163 C translates directly between fan ovens and air fryers, cooking times may need slight adjustment. Air fryers typically cook faster due to their compact size and powerful fans. Start checking your food about 5 minutes before the recipe suggests, especially when trying new dishes. This is particularly important for baked goods where precise timing affects texture.</p>

<h2>Temperature Accuracy and Calibration</h2>
<p>Not all ovens maintain exact temperatures, so it's worth verifying your 163 C setting. An inexpensive oven thermometer can confirm if your appliance runs hot or cold. This is especially useful when moving between conventional and fan oven settings. Air fryers tend to be more accurate due to their smaller cavities and digital controls.</p>
<p>If you find your fan oven doesn't quite match 163 C, small adjustments can make all the difference. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> team recommends testing with simple recipes first to learn your appliance's quirks. Once you've mastered 163 C conversions, you'll find it becomes second nature for all your baking and roasting needs.</p>

<h3>Energy Efficiency Considerations</h3>
<p>Using 163 C in a fan oven or air fryer isn't just about perfect results - it's also more energy efficient. The lower temperature requirement (compared to conventional ovens) means less energy consumption. Air fryers are particularly efficient at this temperature, often using 30-50% less energy than full-sized ovens for the same dishes.</p>

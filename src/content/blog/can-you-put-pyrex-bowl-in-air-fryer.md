<p>No, you should not put a Pyrex bowl in an air fryer. While Pyrex is oven-safe, the intense, direct heat and rapid air circulation in air fryers can cause thermal shock, potentially shattering the glass. At airfryerrecipe.co.uk, we always prioritise safety alongside convenience in kitchen gadgets.</p>

<h2>Why Pyrex and Air Fryers Don't Mix</h2>
<p>Pyrex bowls are designed for conventional ovens where heat distributes evenly and gradually. Air fryers blast food with concentrated hot air at speeds up to 200°C, creating sudden temperature changes that glass struggles to handle. The manufacturer doesn't certify Pyrex as air fryer safe, and many users report cracked or exploded bowls when attempting this combination.</p>
<p>Thermal shock occurs when different parts of the glass expand at different rates. A Pyrex bowl might survive one use but could fail unpredictably on subsequent attempts. For safer alternatives, check our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> to adapt oven recipes properly.</p>

<h2>What Happens If You Use Pyrex in an Air Fryer?</h2>
<p>Attempting to use a Pyrex bowl in an air fryer risks several dangerous outcomes. The bowl could crack mid-cycle, scattering glass shards and hot food. In worst cases, thermal stress might cause the bowl to explode, damaging your appliance and potentially causing burns. Even if the bowl survives, the uneven cooking from blocked airflow defeats the purpose of using an air fryer.</p>
<p>Some Ninja air fryer owners wonder about specific compatibility, but the answer remains the same across all models. The <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipes</a> section offers plenty of ideas that don't require risky glassware substitutions.</p>

<h3>Safer Alternatives to Pyrex in Your Air Fryer</h3>
<p>For foods needing containers, use air fryer-safe metal pans or silicone dishes. These materials withstand rapid temperature changes and allow proper air circulation. Many air fryer accessories are specifically designed to fit your model's basket while providing the containment you'd expect from a bowl.</p>

<h2>When Might Pyrex Seem to Work?</h2>
<p>Some users report successfully reheating leftovers in Pyrex bowls at lower temperatures. However, this remains risky as most air fryers don't maintain perfectly even heat distribution. The bowl's base might overheat while the sides stay cooler, creating stress points. For reheating, we recommend transferring food to an air fryer-safe container or using our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/meal-prep>meal prep</a> techniques optimised for air frying.</p>
<p>If you absolutely must use glass, choose borosilicate varieties specifically marked as air fryer safe, though these are rare. Always preheat the air fryer with the empty glass inside to minimise thermal shock, and never exceed 150°C.</p>

<h3>Cleaning Up After Glass Mishaps</h3>
<p>Should a Pyrex bowl break in your air fryer, unplug immediately and let it cool completely. Use our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning guide</a> for detailed instructions on removing glass safely. Check the heating element and fan for damage before next use.</p>

<h2>Manufacturer Guidelines and Expert Opinions</h2>
<p>Pyrex's official stance warns against using their products in countertop convection ovens or air fryers. The UK Glass Manufacturers' Federation confirms that thermal shock resistance varies by glass composition. Modern soda-lime Pyrex is more prone to shattering than older borosilicate versions.</p>
<p>Air fryer brands similarly caution against unauthorised cookware. For perfect results every time, browse our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipes</a> designed specifically for air fryer baskets and approved accessories.</p>

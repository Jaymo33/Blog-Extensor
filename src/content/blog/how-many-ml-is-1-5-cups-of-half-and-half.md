<p>1.5 cups of half and half equals approximately 355 ml, making it easy to measure for your air fryer recipes. Whether you’re whipping up a creamy sauce or baking a decadent dessert, precise measurements are key. Half and half, a blend of equal parts milk and cream, is a staple in many recipes, and converting cups to millilitres ensures accuracy. If you’re using an air fryer, getting the right consistency can make all the difference.

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Using the correct amount of half and half ensures your air fryer dishes turn out perfectly every time. Too little liquid can lead to dry, unevenly cooked food, while too much might make dishes soggy. Air fryers rely on rapid air circulation, so ingredient ratios are crucial. Whether you’re making a creamy pasta bake or a rich dessert, 355 ml of half and half is the ideal amount for 1.5 cups.

When converting 1.5 cups to 355 ml, you can easily adapt recipes from traditional ovens to air fryers. Its balanced fat content ensures richness without overpowering other flavours.

Whether you're marinating chicken or glazing ribs, knowing the exact weight ensures consistent results every time. For more air fryer tips, visit <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>.</p>  

<h2>Why Convert 5g of BBQ Sauce to Ounces?</h2>  
<p>Many UK recipes use grams, but some air fryer guides or international recipes might list ingredients in ounces. Converting 5g of BBQ sauce to ounces (0.18 oz) helps you follow these recipes accurately. This is especially useful for sauces, where even small differences can affect flavour and texture. If you're exploring new dishes, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a> for inspiration.</p>  

<p>Precision matters when cooking with an air fryer, as the compact space requires balanced ingredient ratios. Too much sauce can make food soggy, while too little might leave it dry. Converting 5g of BBQ sauce to ounces ensures you get the perfect coating every time. For more measurement tips, see our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a>.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure 5g of BBQ Sauce</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a digital scale, you can estimate 5g of BBQ sauce using a teaspoon. One level teaspoon holds roughly 5g (0.18 oz) of thick sauces like BBQ. For a more accurate measure, invest in a kitchen scale—it’s a game-changer for air fryer cooking. You’ll find plenty of scale recommendations at <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for 5g of BBQ Sauce</h2>  
<p>5g of BBQ sauce is perfect for lightly coating small portions, like chicken wings or shrimp skewers in the air fryer. It’s also ideal for meal prep—divide 5g per serving to keep flavours balanced. For larger batches, scale up the conversion (e.g., 50g = 1.76 oz). Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipes</a> for saucy ideas.</p>  

<p>Another great use for 5g of BBQ sauce is as a dipping portion. This amount is just right for one serving without overwhelming the dish. If you’re cooking for a crowd, multiply the conversion accordingly. And don’t forget to clean your air fryer after saucy meals—our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning guide</a> makes it easy.</p>  

<h3>Tips for Storing Leftover BBQ Sauce</h3>  
<p>If you’ve measured out 5g of BBQ sauce and have leftovers, store them in an airtight container in the fridge. Homemade BBQ sauce lasts up to a week, while store-bought varieties can keep for months. Always check for spoilage before reusing.

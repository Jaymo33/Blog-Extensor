<p>2.5 cups of orange juice equals 20 fluid ounces (fl oz) in the UK and US measurement systems. Whether you're making a marinade, glaze, or a refreshing drink, knowing this conversion ensures accuracy in your recipes. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we love helping you get the measurements spot-on for perfect air fryer dishes every time.</p>  

<h2>Understanding Cup to Ounce Conversions</h2>  
<p>When converting cups to ounces, it's essential to know whether you're measuring liquid or dry ingredients. For liquids like orange juice, 1 cup equals 8 fluid ounces. This means 2.5 cups of orange juice translates neatly to 20 fluid ounces. This conversion is handy for recipes where precision matters, such as glazes for air-fried chicken or citrus-infused desserts.</p>  

<p>If you're working with a recipe from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>our collection</a>, you'll often find measurements in cups or ounces. Keeping a conversion chart handy, like the one on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>our conversion page</a>, can save time and avoid mistakes. Whether you're scaling up or down, understanding these basics ensures your dishes turn out just right.</p>  

<h3>Why Accuracy Matters in Air Fryer Cooking</h3>  
<p>Air fryers rely on precise measurements to achieve the perfect texture and flavour. Too much liquid, like orange juice, can make food soggy, while too little might leave it dry. For example, a marinade with 2.5 cups of orange juice (20 oz) should balance acidity and sweetness perfectly for dishes like air-fried citrus salmon or glazed chicken.</p>  

<h2>Using Orange Juice in Air Fryer Recipes</h2>  
<p>Orange juice isn't just for drinking—it's a versatile ingredient in air fryer cooking. From tenderising meats to adding a zesty kick to desserts, 2.5 cups (20 oz) can go a long way. Try it in a marinade for air-fried turkey or as a base for a tangy glaze on roasted vegetables. Check out <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>our chicken recipes</a> for inspiration.</p>  

<p>If you're experimenting with new flavours, remember that 2.5 cups of orange juice equals 20 fluid ounces, making it easy to adjust recipes. For a refreshing twist, mix it with herbs and spices for a marinade, or reduce it into a syrup for drizzling over air-fried desserts. The possibilities are endless!</p>  

<h3>Tips for Measuring Orange Juice</h3>  
<p>To measure 2.5 cups (20 oz) of orange juice accurately, use a liquid measuring cup with clear markings. Pour slowly to avoid spills, and check at eye level for precision. If your recipe calls for weight instead of volume, note that 20 fluid ounces of orange juice weighs approximately 567 grams.</p>  

<h2>Common Questions About Orange Juice Measurements</h2>  
<p>Many home cooks wonder if freshly squeezed orange juice measures the same as store-bought. The answer is yes—2.5 cups (20 oz) is the same regardless of the source. However, fresh juice may have more pulp, which can affect texture but not volume. For air fryer recipes, either works, but fresh juice often delivers brighter flavour.</p>  

<p>If you're scaling a recipe, remember that 2.5 cups of orange juice equals 20 fluid ounces. This makes it easy to halve or double quantities without guesswork.

<p>785 ml of orange juice equals approximately 3.32 cups (US) or 3.5 cups (UK). Whether you're baking a citrus-infused cake or preparing a marinade, knowing this conversion ensures your recipes turn out perfectly. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we understand how precise measurements can make or break a dish, especially when using an air fryer.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Using the correct amount of orange juice in recipes ensures balanced flavours and textures. Too much liquid can make batters runny, while too little may dry out baked goods. For air fryer recipes, precise measurements are even more critical due to the appliance's rapid cooking process. A slight variation can affect cooking times and results.</p>  
<p>If you're working with frozen orange juice, check our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for adjustments. Conversions may vary slightly between US and UK cup measurements, so always double-check which standard your recipe follows.</p>

<h2>Converting 785 ml of Orange Juice to Cups</h2>  
<p>In the US, 1 cup equals 240 ml, so 785 ml is roughly 3.32 cups. In the UK, 1 cup is 250 ml, making 785 ml approximately 3.5 cups. This difference might seem small, but it can impact recipes requiring exact ratios, like cakes or glazes.</p>  
<p>For air fryer cooking, we recommend using a measuring jug with both metric and imperial markings. This ensures accuracy whether you're following a recipe from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>our collection</a> or adapting a family favourite.</p>

<h3>Measuring Without a Jug</h3>  
<p>If you don't have a measuring jug, use standard tablespoons. 15 ml equals 1 tablespoon, so 785 ml is about 52 tablespoons. While not as precise, this method works in a pinch for marinades or dressings where exact measurements are less critical.</p>

<h2>Common Uses for 785 ml of Orange Juice</h2>  
<p>This quantity is perfect for citrus cakes, marinades, or homemade orange glaze. In air fryer cooking, orange juice adds moisture and flavour to poultry or pork dishes. Try it in our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>air fryer chicken recipes</a> for a tangy twist.</p>  
<p>When baking, 785 ml of orange juice can make enough batter for a large cake or multiple smaller treats. Always check your recipe's liquid requirements, as air fryer baking often needs slightly less moisture than conventional oven methods.</p>

<h3>Storing Leftover Orange Juice</h3>  
<p>If your recipe doesn't use all 785 ml, store leftovers in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 3 days. For longer storage, freeze in ice cube trays and use as needed. This works perfectly for adding small amounts to <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>air fryer desserts</a> or sauces.</p>

<h2>Conversion Tips for Perfect Results</h2>  
<p>Always use room temperature orange juice for accurate measuring, as cold liquids can contract slightly. When converting between ml and cups, round to the nearest practical measurement - professional bakers might use 3.32 cups, but home cooks can usually use 3 1/3 cups without issues.</p>

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on even cooking, and incorrect measurements can lead to uneven results. Too much garlic paste might overpower the dish, while too little could leave it bland. Unlike traditional ovens, air fryers circulate hot air rapidly, so ingredients need to be well-balanced. Using the right amount of garlic paste ensures your food cooks evenly and tastes perfect.

<p>Garlic paste is denser than minced garlic, so volume measurements like teaspoons can be misleading. Weight measurements, such as grams or ounces, provide accuracy. If you're converting 5g of garlic paste to ounces, a digital kitchen scale is your best friend. This small investment can save you from recipe mishaps and elevate your air fryer game.

<p>Measuring sticky substances like garlic paste can be tricky, but a few simple tricks make it easier. Lightly oil your spoon or measuring cup to help the paste slide off smoothly.

This method ensures you get exactly 5g (or 0.18 ounces) without waste.</p>

<h3>Converting other garlic measurements</h3>  
<p>If you donâ€™t have garlic paste, you can substitute fresh garlic or minced garlic. One clove of garlic is roughly equivalent to 5g of paste, but the flavour intensity may vary. For minced garlic, 5g equals about one teaspoon. Always adjust to taste, especially in air fryer recipes where flavours concentrate.

<p>5g of garlic paste equals approximately 0.18 ounces. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements can make or break the dish. Whether you're whipping up a marinade or seasoning your ingredients, knowing the exact weight ensures consistent results every time. Garlic paste is a staple in many recipes, and getting the measurement right is key to balancing flavours. For more air fryer conversion tips, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on even cooking, and incorrect measurements can lead to uneven results. Too much garlic paste might overpower the dish, while too little could leave it bland. Unlike traditional ovens, air fryers circulate hot air rapidly, so ingredients need to be well-balanced. Using the right amount of garlic paste ensures your food cooks evenly and tastes perfect. For more recipe ideas, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> collection.</p>  

<p>Garlic paste is denser than minced garlic, so volume measurements like teaspoons can be misleading. Weight measurements, such as grams or ounces, provide accuracy. If you're converting 5g of garlic paste to ounces, a digital kitchen scale is your best friend. This small investment can save you from recipe mishaps and elevate your air fryer game. Visit <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> for more cooking tips and tricks.</p>  

<h3>How to measure sticky ingredients like garlic paste</h3>  
<p>Measuring sticky substances like garlic paste can be tricky, but a few simple tricks make it easier. Lightly oil your spoon or measuring cup to help the paste slide off smoothly. Alternatively, use a small spatula to scrape out every bit. For precise measurements, weigh the container before and after adding the paste. This method ensures you get exactly 5g (or 0.18 ounces) without waste.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for garlic paste in air fryer recipes</h2>  
<p>Garlic paste is incredibly versatile and works well in marinades, dips, and seasoning blends. A small amount, like 5g, can add depth to chicken, vegetables, or even tofu. Try mixing it with olive oil and herbs for a quick marinade, or stir it into yoghurt for a flavourful dip. For inspiration, browse our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipes</a> section.</p>  

<p>Many air fryer enthusiasts use garlic paste to enhance frozen foods like fries or onion rings. Just 5g (0.18 ounces) can transform a simple snack into a gourmet treat. If you're cooking frozen foods, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/frozen-foods>frozen foods recipes</a> for more ideas. Remember, a little goes a long way with garlic paste, so measure carefully!</p>  

<h3>Converting other garlic measurements</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have garlic paste, you can substitute fresh garlic or minced garlic. One clove of garlic is roughly equivalent to 5g of paste, but the flavour intensity may vary. For minced garlic, 5g equals about one teaspoon. Always adjust to taste, especially in air fryer recipes where flavours concentrate.

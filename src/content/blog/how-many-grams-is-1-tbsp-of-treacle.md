<p>1 tablespoon (tbsp) of treacle weighs approximately 20 grams. This measurement is essential for baking and cooking, especially when using an air fryer, where precision can make all the difference. Whether you're making sticky toffee pudding or glazing meats, knowing the exact weight ensures consistent results.

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on even heat distribution, so using the right amount of ingredients is crucial. Too much treacle can cause uneven cooking or excessive browning, while too little might leave your dish lacking flavour. Measuring 1 tbsp of treacle to grams ensures your recipes turn out perfectly every time. If you're new to air frying, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> for inspiration.</p>  

<p>Treacle is a thick, sticky syrup, so measuring it by volume can be tricky. A kitchen scale eliminates guesswork, giving you the exact 20 grams per tablespoon. This precision is especially helpful for desserts like treacle tart or gingerbread, where balance is key. For more baking tips, visit our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>cake recipes</a> section.</p>  

<h3>How to measure treacle without a scale</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a scale, use a levelled tablespoon for the most accurate 1 tbsp treacle to grams conversion. Lightly grease the spoon to help the treacle slide off easily. Remember, 1 tbsp equals roughly 20 grams, so adjust your recipe accordingly. For sticky ingredients like treacle, a <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>non-stick air fryer liner</a> can make cleanup a breeze.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for treacle in air fryer recipes</h2>  
<p>Treacle adds depth and sweetness to both sweet and savoury dishes. In the air fryer, it works beautifully as a glaze for meats or a base for desserts. Knowing that 1 tbsp of treacle in grams is 20 helps you tweak recipes without compromising texture or taste. Try it in our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert recipes</a> for a rich, caramelised finish.</p>  

<p>From marinades to cakes, treacle’s robust flavour pairs well with spices like cinnamon and ginger. Since air fryers cook faster than conventional ovens, precise measurements prevent burning or undercooking. Stick to 20 grams per tablespoon, and your dishes will come out perfectly balanced every time.</p>  

<h3>Converting other treacle measurements</h3>  
<p>Need more or less than 1 tbsp? Here’s a quick guide: 1 teaspoon of treacle is about 7 grams, while 100 grams equals roughly 5 tablespoons. These conversions are handy for scaling recipes up or down. For more measurement tips, browse our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> guides.</p>

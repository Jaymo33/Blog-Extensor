<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on even heat distribution, so ingredient quantities must be spot-on. Too much or too little milk can throw off textures, especially in baked goods like muffins or pancakes. For example, adding 75 grams of milk instead of eyeballing 5 tbsp ensures your batter isn’t too runny or thick.

<p>UK tablespoons differ slightly from other regions, holding 15ml each. This means 5 tbsp of milk equals 75ml, which converts neatly to 75 grams due to milk’s density. Always use a kitchen scale for reliability, especially when adapting recipes from cups or ounces. Need more tips?

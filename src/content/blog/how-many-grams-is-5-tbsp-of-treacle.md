<p>5 tablespoons of treacle is approximately 100 grams. This conversion is essential for precise baking and cooking, especially when using an air fryer where measurements can make or break a recipe. Whether you’re whipping up a sticky pudding or a glaze for meats, knowing the exact weight ensures consistency and perfect results every time.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>
<p>Air fryers rely on precise cooking times and temperatures, and ingredient measurements are just as crucial. Using the correct amount of treacle—100 grams for 5 tablespoons—ensures your recipes turn out as intended. Too much or too little can affect texture, sweetness, and even cooking time.</p>
<p>For example, if you’re making a treacle tart in your air fryer, an extra 10 grams of treacle could make it overly sticky or alter the baking time. That’s why we recommend using a kitchen scale for accuracy. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more handy measurements.</p>

<h2>How to Measure Treacle Without a Scale</h2>
<p>If you don’t have a kitchen scale, you can still measure treacle accurately using tablespoons. One level tablespoon of treacle weighs about 20 grams, so 5 tablespoons equal roughly 100 grams. To avoid sticky messes, lightly grease your measuring spoon first—this helps the treacle slide off easily.</p>
<p>Treacle’s thick consistency means it’s easy to over-pour, so take your time when measuring. For more tips on working with sticky ingredients, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> section, where precision is key to delicious results.</p>

<h3>UK vs. US Tablespoon Measurements</h3>
<p>It’s worth noting that UK and US tablespoons differ slightly in volume. A UK tablespoon holds 17.7 ml, while a US tablespoon is 14.8 ml. For treacle, this means 5 UK tablespoons equal 100 grams, whereas 5 US tablespoons would be closer to 85 grams. Always double-check which measurement system your recipe uses.</p>

<h2>Common Recipes Using 5 Tbsp of Treacle</h2>
<p>Treacle is a staple in many British desserts and savoury dishes. Here are a few air fryer-friendly recipes where 5 tablespoons (100 grams) of treacle might come in handy:</p>
<ul>
<li>Treacle tart: A classic dessert with a buttery crust and gooey filling.</li>
<li>Gingerbread cakes: Treacle adds depth and moisture to spiced bakes.</li>
<li>Glazed ham: A sticky treacle glaze caramelises beautifully in the air fryer.</li>
</ul>
<p>For more inspiration, browse our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert category</a>, where treacle often takes centre stage.</p>

<h3>Storing and Handling Treacle</h3>
<p>Treacle can crystallise or harden over time, making it tricky to measure. To soften it, gently warm the tin in a bowl of hot water before measuring. Store opened treacle in a cool, dry place, and always wipe the rim of the tin to prevent sticking. For sticky air fryer messes, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning guide</a> has you covered.</p>

<h2>Converting Other Treacle Measurements</h2>
<p>Need to adjust your recipe? Here’s a quick reference for treacle conversions:</p>
<ul>
<li>1 tbsp treacle = 20 grams</li>
<li>50 grams treacle = 2.5 tbsp</li>
<li>200 grams treacle = 10 tbsp</li>
</ul>
<p>Whether you’re scaling up or down, these conversions ensure your air fryer dishes turn out perfectly every time. For more measurement tips, visit <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>.</p>

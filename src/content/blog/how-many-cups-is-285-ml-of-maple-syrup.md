<p>285 ml of maple syrup is approximately 1.2 cups. This conversion is essential for baking, cooking, or preparing air fryer recipes where precise measurements matter. Whether you're making glazes, marinades, or sweet treats, knowing how to convert millilitres to cups ensures consistent results every time.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of maple syrup can make or break your air fryer recipes. Too much can lead to overly sticky or burnt results, while too little might leave your dish lacking flavour. For perfect air fryer meals, always measure liquids like maple syrup carefully. Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more handy measurement tips.</p>  

<p>Maple syrup is a popular ingredient in both sweet and savoury dishes. From glazed salmon to air-fried doughnuts, its rich flavour enhances many recipes. If you're new to air frying, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a> for inspiration.</p>  

<h2>How to Measure 285 ml of Maple Syrup Without a Measuring Cup</h2>  
<p>If you don’t have a measuring cup, you can still measure 285 ml of maple syrup accurately. A standard metric measuring jug will give you the exact amount needed. Alternatively, use a kitchen scale—285 ml of maple syrup weighs roughly 357 grams.</p>  

<h3>Using a Kitchen Scale for Precision</h3>  
<p>For the most accurate results, weigh your maple syrup instead of relying solely on volume. Since maple syrup is denser than water, 285 ml won’t equate to 285 grams. Instead, it’s closer to 357 grams, making a scale a reliable tool for perfect measurements.</p>  

<h2>Common Recipes Using 285 ml of Maple Syrup</h2>  
<p>Many air fryer recipes call for around 285 ml of maple syrup. Popular dishes include maple-glazed chicken, candied nuts, and air-fried pancakes. For more ideas, browse our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert recipes</a> featuring this sweet ingredient.</p>  

<p>If you’re cooking for a crowd, doubling or halving the recipe may be necessary. Remember that 285 ml equals 1.2 cups, so adjust accordingly. Keeping your air fryer clean is also crucial—check out our guide on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaning</a> for best practices.</p>  

<h3>Adjusting Recipes for Different Serving Sizes</h3>  
<p>Scaling recipes up or down? Simply multiply or divide the 285 ml measurement as needed. For example, half of 285 ml is 142.5 ml (about 0.6 cups), while double is 570 ml (roughly 2.4 cups). This flexibility makes meal prep a breeze.</p>  

<h2>UK vs. US Cup Measurements</h2>  
<p>It’s worth noting that UK and US cup measurements differ slightly. In the UK, 1 cup is 250 ml, whereas in the US, it’s 240 ml. For 285 ml of maple syrup, this means approximately 1.14 UK cups or 1.2 US cups. Always check which standard your recipe follows.</p>

<p>60 ml of buttermilk is equal to approximately 1/4 cup. This conversion is essential for baking and cooking, especially when using an air fryer for recipes that require precise measurements. Whether you're whipping up pancakes, cakes, or marinades, knowing how to convert 60 ml of buttermilk to cups ensures your dishes turn out perfectly every time.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Buttermilk Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of buttermilk can make or break a recipe. Too little, and your baked goods might turn out dry; too much, and they could become soggy. For air fryer recipes, precision is key because the cooking environment is more concentrated than a conventional oven. A slight variation in liquid measurements can affect texture and cooking time.</p>  
<p>Buttermilk adds tanginess and moisture to dishes, making it a staple in many recipes. If you're following a recipe from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, you'll often find buttermilk used in everything from fried chicken to fluffy cakes. Measuring 60 ml of buttermilk correctly ensures consistency, whether you're cooking for one or meal prepping for the week.</p>  

<h2>Converting 60 ml of Buttermilk to Cups</h2>  
<p>To convert 60 ml of buttermilk to cups, you'll need to know that 1 cup equals 240 ml. This means 60 ml is exactly 1/4 cup. If you don't have a measuring cup handy, you can use a tablespoon—60 ml is roughly 4 tablespoons. However, for baking, using a proper measuring cup or scale is recommended for accuracy.</p>  
<p>If you're working with a recipe that lists buttermilk in grams, 60 ml of buttermilk weighs about 61 grams. This is useful if you're using a kitchen scale instead of volume measurements.

<h3>Measuring Buttermilk for Air Fryer Recipes</h3>  
<p>When using buttermilk in air fryer recipes, accuracy is crucial. For example, if you're making buttermilk fried chicken, the marinade needs the right consistency to coat the chicken evenly.

<h2>Common Uses for 60 ml of Buttermilk</h2>  
<p>Buttermilk is versatile and can be used in both sweet and savoury dishes. A 60 ml portion is perfect for small batches of pancakes, muffins, or even salad dressings. If you're exploring <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>cake recipes</a>, buttermilk adds a lovely tang and lightness to the batter.</p>  
<p>In savoury dishes, 60 ml of buttermilk works well as a marinade for chicken or a base for creamy sauces. It's also great for making fluffy biscuits or scones in your air fryer.

<h3>Tips for Storing Buttermilk</h3>  
<p>If you don't use all your buttermilk at once, store it in an airtight container in the fridge for up to two weeks. You can also freeze buttermilk in ice cube trays for smaller portions—each cube is roughly 30 ml, so two cubes equal 60 ml. This makes it easy to measure out the exact amount you need for future recipes.</p>  

<h2>Substitutes for Buttermilk</h2>  
<p>If you're out of buttermilk, you can make a quick substitute by adding 1 tablespoon of lemon juice or vinegar to 60 ml of milk. Let it sit for 5 minutes to thicken before using. This works well in most recipes, though the flavour might be slightly different. For best results, stick to real buttermilk when possible.</p>  
<p>Another option is using plain yoghurt thinned with a little water to match the consistency of buttermilk. This substitute works particularly well in baked goods and marinades.

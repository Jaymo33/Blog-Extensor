<p>275 grams of cream is approximately 1.16 cups in the UK and 1.1 cups in the US. This conversion is essential for baking and cooking, especially when using an air fryer. Whether you're whipping up a dessert or a savoury dish, knowing the exact measurement ensures perfect results every time.</p>

<h2>Understanding Cream Measurements</h2>
<p>Cream can be tricky to measure because its density varies slightly depending on its fat content. For most cooking purposes, 275 grams of cream translates to roughly 1.16 cups in the UK and 1.1 cups in the US. This difference arises because UK and US cup measurements aren't identical. If you're using an air fryer, precise measurements are crucial for achieving the right texture and consistency in your dishes.</p>
<p>For those who love baking, a slight miscalculation can lead to overly dense or runny results. That's why we recommend using a kitchen scale for accuracy. If you don't have one, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> can help you navigate these measurements effortlessly.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter</h2>
<p>When cooking or baking, especially in an air fryer, precision is key. Too much cream can make your dish soggy, while too little can leave it dry. For example, if you're making a creamy pasta sauce or a decadent dessert, 275 grams of cream should be measured carefully to avoid disappointment. Air fryers cook food quickly, so imbalances in ingredients can be more noticeable.</p>

<h3>UK vs. US Cup Measurements</h3>
<p>It's important to note that UK and US cup measurements differ slightly. In the UK, 1 cup is 284 ml, while in the US, it's 240 ml. This means 275 grams of cream is about 1.16 cups in the UK and 1.1 cups in the US. Always check which measurement system your recipe uses to avoid mistakes.</p>

<h2>Tips for Measuring Cream Without a Scale</h2>
<p>If you don't have a kitchen scale, you can still measure 275 grams of cream accurately. Use a liquid measuring cup and fill it to the 1.1-cup mark for US recipes or 1.16 cups for UK recipes. Remember to level off the cream for the most accurate measurement. This method works well for most <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert recipes</a> and savoury dishes.</p>
<p>Another handy tip is to use tablespoons as a reference. There are 16 tablespoons in a US cup and 17.7 tablespoons in a UK cup. So, 275 grams of cream would be roughly 17.6 US tablespoons or 19.5 UK tablespoons. This can be useful for smaller adjustments.</p>

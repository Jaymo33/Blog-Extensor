<p>5 grams of crushed garlic equals approximately 0.18 ounces. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements can make or break a dish. Whether you're whipping up garlic-infused chicken or a quick vegetable stir-fry, knowing the exact weight ensures consistent flavour. For more handy conversions, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>

<h2>Why accurate garlic measurements matter</h2>  
<p>Garlic is a powerhouse ingredient that can easily overpower a dish if used incorrectly. In an air fryer, where flavours intensify due to concentrated heat, getting the right amount is crucial. Too much garlic can make your meal bitter, while too little might leave it bland. For recipes like garlic butter shrimp or roasted potatoes, 5g (0.18 oz) of crushed garlic strikes the perfect balance. Explore more <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>garlic-heavy recipes</a> on our site.</p>  

<p>Many UK cooks prefer weighing ingredients like garlic for consistency. While some recipes call for cloves, others specify grams or ounces. If you're adapting a recipe from another source, converting 5g of crushed garlic to ounces ensures you stay on track. This is especially useful for air fryer cooking, where small batches are common.</p>  

<h3>How to measure 5g of crushed garlic</h3>  
<p>If you don't have scales, visual cues can help. One medium-sized garlic clove yields about 5g when crushed. That's roughly half a tablespoon or one heaped teaspoon. For best results in air fryer cooking, crush garlic just before use to preserve its pungent flavour. Need tips on prepping ingredients? Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable prep guide</a> has you covered.</p>  

<h2>Converting grams to ounces for air fryer recipes</h2>  
<p>The metric system (grams) is standard in the UK, but some older recipes use imperial (ounces). To convert 5g of crushed garlic to ounces, multiply by 0.035. This gives you 0.18 oz â€“ a measurement that's spot-on for air fryer portions. Whether you're making garlic bread or marinating chicken, this conversion ensures accuracy.</p>  

<p>For larger batches, scaling up is simple. 10g of crushed garlic equals 0.35 oz, while 15g is 0.53 oz. These conversions work for all air fryer recipes, from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>garlic chicken wings</a> to roasted veggies. Remember, fresh garlic varies in potency, so adjust to taste after converting.</p>  

<h3>Common mistakes when measuring garlic</h3>  
<p>One error is using pre-minced jarred garlic instead of fresh. While convenient, jarred garlic lacks the vibrant taste of fresh and often requires double the amount. Another pitfall is packing crushed garlic into measuring spoons, which can nearly double the weight. For true 5g (0.18 oz) measurements, lightly spoon crushed garlic into scales.</p>  

<h2>Garlic in air fryer cooking: pro tips</h2>  
<p>Garlic burns easily in air fryers due to high heat. To prevent this, mix crushed garlic with oil or other ingredients before cooking. For even distribution, toss foods like potatoes or broccoli with garlic halfway through cooking. This technique ensures every bite is flavourful without bitterness.</p>  

<p>After cooking with garlic, clean your air fryer promptly to prevent lingering odours. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning guide</a> shows how to maintain your appliance. Proper care ensures your next batch of garlicky goodness tastes fresh, not like yesterday's dinner.</p>

<h2>Why accurate garlic measurements matter</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of minced garlic is crucial for balancing flavours in air fryer dishes. Too little, and your meal might lack depth; too much, and it can overpower other ingredients. Garlic’s potency varies depending on how finely it’s minced, so weight-based measurements (like grams) are more reliable than volume (like tablespoons).

For dishes like garlic mushrooms or roasted potatoes, this measurement is a game-changer. Need cleaning tips after cooking?

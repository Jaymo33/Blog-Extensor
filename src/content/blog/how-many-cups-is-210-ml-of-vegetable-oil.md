<p>210 ml of vegetable oil equals approximately 0.89 cups (just under 1 cup). This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes, where precise measurements can make or break your dish. Whether you're frying, baking, or roasting, knowing how to convert ml to cups ensures consistent results every time.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of vegetable oil in your air fryer is crucial for achieving crispy, golden results without excess grease. Too little oil can leave food dry, while too much can make it soggy. For example, recipes like air-fried chicken or roasted vegetables often call for 210 ml of vegetable oil, which is just under a full cup. This measurement ensures even coating and perfect texture.</p>  
<p>At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we emphasise precision in cooking conversions. If you're working with a recipe that lists oil in ml but prefer cups, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> can help. This is especially useful for baking, where exact proportions matter.</p>

<h2>How to Measure 210 ml of Vegetable Oil Without a Measuring Cup</h2>  
<p>Don’t have a measuring cup? No problem. You can use a standard metric measuring jug or even a tablespoon to approximate 210 ml of vegetable oil. Since 1 tablespoon holds about 15 ml, 14 tablespoons will give you roughly 210 ml. Alternatively, a UK metric cup holds 250 ml, so filling it to just below the brim will get you close to 210 ml.</p>  
<p>For more tips on measuring ingredients for air fryer recipes, check out our guide on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a>. Whether you're making crispy tofu or golden shrimp, precise oil measurements elevate your dish.</p>

<h3>US vs. UK Cup Measurements</h3>  
<p>It’s worth noting that a US cup (240 ml) and a UK cup (250 ml) differ slightly. For 210 ml of vegetable oil, the difference is minimal—about 0.87 US cups vs. 0.84 UK cups. Most air fryer recipes account for this, but if you’re following a specific regional recipe, double-check the cup size.</p>

<h2>Common Recipes Using 210 ml of Vegetable Oil</h2>  
<p>Many air fryer recipes, like battered fish or onion rings, use around 210 ml of vegetable oil for coating. This amount ensures even crispiness without overpowering the food’s natural flavours. For example, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>air-fryer chicken recipes</a> often recommend this measurement for optimal results.</p>  
<p>If you’re experimenting with homemade air fryer chips, 210 ml of oil is perfect for tossing potato slices before cooking. For more inspiration, browse our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/potatoes>potato recipes</a> section.</p>

<h3>Cleaning Your Air Fryer After Using Oil</h3>  
<p>After cooking with vegetable oil, it’s important to clean your air fryer properly to avoid residue buildup. Check out our guide on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaning</a> for easy maintenance tips.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on precise ingredient ratios to achieve the perfect texture and flavour. Using the correct amount of evaporated milk—240 ml for 1.0 cups—ensures your recipes turn out as intended. Too much or too little can affect moisture levels, browning, and even cooking times. If you’re experimenting with new dishes, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a> for foolproof ideas.</p>  

<p>Evaporated milk is thicker and richer than regular milk, so measuring it accurately is crucial. A slight deviation could lead to overly dense cakes or sauces that split. For best results, use a liquid measuring cup or a kitchen scale for ml conversions. Need more tips?

<h3>How to Measure Evaporated Milk Correctly</h3>  
<p>To measure 1.0 cups of evaporated milk (240 ml), pour it into a liquid measuring cup and check the ml markings at eye level. Avoid using dry measuring cups, as they won’t give you an accurate ml reading. If your recipe calls for smaller increments, remember that ½ cup equals 120 ml, and ¼ cup is 60 ml.

<p>1.66 cups of frozen peas equals approximately 8.8 ounces. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes, ensuring you get the right portion size for perfect results every time. Whether you're making a quick side dish or adding peas to a larger meal, accurate measurements matter.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Cooking with an air fryer requires precision, especially when dealing with frozen ingredients like peas. Too much or too little can affect cooking times and texture. Frozen peas, for example, cook quickly, so knowing the exact weight helps avoid over or undercooking. For more air fryer tips, check out <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>our conversion chart</a>.</p>  

<p>Using 1.66 cups of frozen peas translates to 8.8 ounces, a measurement that ensures even cooking. This is particularly useful for recipes like air-fried pea fritters or adding peas to stir-fries. If you're unsure about other conversions, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe section</a> has plenty of ideas.</p>  

<h3>How to measure frozen peas accurately</h3>  
<p>Measuring frozen peas can be tricky since they don’t settle like dry ingredients. For 1.66 cups, lightly fill the measuring cup without packing the peas down. This prevents over-measuring and ensures you get the correct 8.8-ounce weight. A kitchen scale can also help for ultimate precision.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for 1.66 cups of frozen peas</h2>  
<p>This measurement is perfect for side dishes or incorporating peas into larger meals. Try air-frying them with a bit of olive oil and salt for a crispy snack. You can also mix them into <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable-based recipes</a> for added texture and nutrition.</p>  

<p>Another great use is in meal prep—8.8 ounces of peas can be portioned into multiple servings. For more inspiration, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning guide</a> to keep your air fryer in top shape between recipes.</p>  

<h3>Converting other frozen vegetable measurements</h3>  
<p>If you’re working with other frozen veggies, the same principles apply. Lightly fill the measuring cup and avoid packing. For example, 1.66 cups of frozen corn also weighs roughly 8.8 ounces. Always double-check with a scale if precision is crucial for your recipe.</p>  

<h2>Tips for cooking frozen peas in an air fryer</h2>  
<p>Frozen peas cook quickly in an air fryer—usually in just 3-5 minutes at 180°C. Toss them in a bit of oil and seasoning for extra flavour. Avoid overcrowding the basket to ensure even cooking.

<p>If you’re adding peas to a larger dish, like a stir-fry or casserole, adjust cooking times accordingly. The 8.8-ounce measurement ensures they’ll cook through without becoming mushy. Experiment with different seasonings to find your favourite way to enjoy them.</p>

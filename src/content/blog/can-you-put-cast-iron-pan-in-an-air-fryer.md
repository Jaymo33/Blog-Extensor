<p>Yes, you can put a cast iron pan in an air fryer, but with caution. Cast iron is durable and retains heat well, but its weight and size may not suit all air fryer models. Always check your air fryer’s manual for compatibility before attempting this. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we recommend testing with small, lightweight cast iron pans first.</p>  

<h2>Is It Safe to Use Cast Iron in an Air Fryer?</h2>  
<p>Safety is the top concern when using a cast iron pan in an air fryer. Cast iron doesn’t melt, but it can get extremely hot and may damage the air fryer basket or heating element. Ensure your pan fits without touching the heating coils. Overheating can also cause smoke or even fire, so never leave it unattended. For safer alternatives, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for optimal cooking settings.</p>  

<p>Another risk is the pan’s weight. Many air fryers have lightweight baskets not designed for heavy cast iron. Dropping or forcing it in could crack the basket. Always lift the pan carefully to avoid accidents. If you’re unsure, stick to air fryer-safe accessories listed in your manual.</p>  

<h3>Will a Cast Iron Pan Damage My Air Fryer?</h3>  
<p>Using a cast iron pan could scratch or dent your air fryer basket over time. The pan’s rough surface may also wear down non-stick coatings. To minimise damage, place a liner or parchment paper underneath. For more tips, explore our guide on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning your air fryer</a> after use.</p>  

<h2>Best Practices for Using Cast Iron in an Air Fryer</h2>  
<p>If you decide to proceed, preheat the pan separately to avoid thermal shock. Sudden temperature changes can warp cast iron. Keep cooking times short and monitor closely. Smaller pans work best—avoid oversized skillets that block airflow. For recipe ideas, browse our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipes</a> designed for air fryers.</p>  

<p>Season your cast iron well to prevent rust and sticking. A well-maintained pan conducts heat more evenly. Remember, cast iron retains heat longer than air fryer baskets, so handle with oven mitts. Always let it cool before cleaning to avoid burns.</p>  

<h3>What Happens If You Use Cast Iron Incorrectly?</h3>  
<p>Improper use can lead to smoke, burnt food, or even fire. Overcrowding the pan restricts airflow, leading to uneven cooking. Excess oil can drip and cause flare-ups. Stick to thin layers of food for best results. For more safety tips, visit <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>.</p>  

<h2>Alternatives to Cast Iron for Air Frying</h2>  
<p>If cast iron seems risky, try air fryer-safe ceramic or stainless steel pans. Silicone molds are another lightweight option. Many <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> work perfectly without additional cookware. Always prioritise safety and convenience over tradition.</p>  

<p>Some air fryers come with compatible baking pans or racks. These are designed to withstand high heat without the risks of cast iron. Check your model’s accessories for the best fit. Experimenting with different materials can yield great results without the hassle.</p>

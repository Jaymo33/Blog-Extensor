<h2>How to Measure 1.66 Cups of Breadcrumbs Correctly</h2>  
<p>For the most accurate results, use a kitchen scale to weigh your breadcrumbs. If you don’t have one, lightly spoon the breadcrumbs into a measuring cup without packing them down. This prevents over-measuring, which can throw off your recipe. A standard US cup holds about 4 ounces of breadcrumbs, so 1.66 cups equals 6.64 ounces.</p>  

<p>Different types of breadcrumbs (panko, fresh, or dried) can vary slightly in weight. Panko, for example, is lighter, so you might need a bit more by volume. For air fryer cooking, stick to the 6.64-ounce benchmark unless your recipe specifies otherwise. Need cleaning tips for your air fryer after cooking?

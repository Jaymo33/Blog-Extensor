<h2>Why Accurate Pasta Measurements Matter</h2>

<p>Different pasta shapes have varying densities, which means 2.75 cups of penne won’t weigh the same as 2.75 cups of spaghetti. That’s why weighing your pasta in grams is often more reliable than using cup measurements.

<h2>How to Measure Pasta Without a Scale</h2>  
<p>If you don’t have a kitchen scale, you can still estimate 2.75 cups of pasta in grams using simple tricks. A standard measuring cup holds about 120 grams of dry pasta, so 2.75 cups would be close to 330 grams. However, this method isn’t as precise as weighing, so consider investing in a scale for better accuracy.

<p>Another handy tip is to use portion guides—for example, a single serving of pasta is typically around 75 grams. So, 2.75 cups (330 grams) would serve about four people. This is especially useful when planning meals for a family or gathering.

<h3>Adjusting Cooking Times for Perfect Pasta</h3>

<p>350 grams of olive oil equals approximately 1.54 cups (UK) or 1.48 cups (US). This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes, where accuracy ensures crispy, evenly cooked dishes. Whether you're making roasted vegetables or frying chicken, knowing how to measure olive oil correctly can make all the difference.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Olive Oil Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of olive oil in your air fryer prevents soggy or overly dry results. Too little oil, and your food won’t crisp up properly. Too much, and you risk uneven cooking or excess smoke. For perfect air-fried dishes, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> to streamline your cooking process.</p>  

<p>Olive oil is a staple in many air fryer recipes, from Mediterranean-style dishes to simple roasted potatoes. If you're working with 350 grams of olive oil, knowing its cup equivalent helps you follow recipes precisely. This is especially useful when scaling recipes up or down for meal prep.</p>  

<h3>UK vs. US Cup Measurements</h3>  
<p>The slight difference between UK and US cup sizes means 350 grams of olive oil converts to 1.54 cups in the UK and 1.48 cups in the US. Always check which measurement system your recipe uses to avoid mistakes. For more air fryer tips, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a>.</p>  

<h2>How to Measure 350 Grams of Olive Oil Without Scales</h2>  
<p>If you don’t have a kitchen scale, use a liquid measuring cup to approximate 350 grams of olive oil. One cup of olive oil weighs roughly 227 grams, so 1.5 cups will get you close to 350 grams. For best results, invest in a digital scale for precise measurements.</p>  

<p>Another trick is to use tablespoons—15 grams per tablespoon—meaning 350 grams is about 23 tablespoons. This method works well for smaller batches or dressings. For more air fryer hacks, visit <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>.</p>  

<h3>Best Olive Oil for Air Frying</h3>

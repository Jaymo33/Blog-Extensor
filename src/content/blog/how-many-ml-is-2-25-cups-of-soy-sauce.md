<p>2.25 cups of soy sauce equals approximately 532.32 millilitres (ml). This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes, ensuring your marinades and sauces have the perfect consistency. Whether you're whipping up a quick stir-fry or marinating chicken for the air fryer, precise measurements make all the difference.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Soy Sauce Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of soy sauce ensures your dish isn’t too salty or bland. Many air fryer recipes, like teriyaki chicken or glazed salmon, rely on balanced flavours. A slight miscalculation can throw off the entire dish. For example, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer teriyaki chicken</a> requires exact measurements to achieve that perfect glaze.</p>  

<p>Converting cups to millilitres is especially helpful for UK cooks, where metric measurements are standard. If you’re following an American recipe, knowing that 2.25 cups of soy sauce is roughly 532.32 ml ensures consistency. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more handy conversions.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure Soy Sauce Correctly</h3>  
<p>For best results, use a liquid measuring cup or a kitchen scale. Pour the soy sauce to the 2.25-cup mark, or weigh it (1 cup ≈ 236.59 ml). If you’re prepping a large batch, like our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>air fryer chicken recipes</a>, accuracy saves time and ingredients.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for 2.25 Cups of Soy Sauce</h2>  
<p>This quantity is ideal for marinades, stir-fry sauces, or glazes. For example, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/salmon>air fryer salmon recipes</a> often call for a soy-based marinade. A 532.32 ml measurement ensures even coating without waste.</p>

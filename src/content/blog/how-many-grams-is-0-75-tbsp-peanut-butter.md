    "@type": "Answer",
    "text": "Weight measurements (grams) are more accurate than volume (tablespoons) for air fryer cooking because they're not affected by how ingredients are packed or settled. This precision matters more in the compact, intense heat of an air fryer where small measurement differences can significantly affect results, especially in baking."

However, very runny or particularly thick specialty nut butters might vary slightly. When substituting in air fryer recipes, it's always safest to weigh ingredients for the most accurate results."

<p>0.75 tablespoons (tbsp) of peanut butter equals approximately 11.25 grams (g) in UK measurements. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precision matters, especially when baking or preparing sauces. Peanut butter's density can vary slightly between brands, but this measurement provides a reliable standard for most cooking needs. If you're using an air fryer for recipes like peanut butter cookies or satay sauces, knowing this conversion ensures consistent results. Bookmark <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>our conversion chart</a> for quick reference during your cooking sessions.</p>

<h2>Why accurate peanut butter measurements matter</h2>
<p>When using your air fryer, especially for baking, precise measurements make all the difference between success and disappointment. Too much peanut butter can make cookies spread too thin, while too little might leave them dry. For savoury dishes like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>air fryer chicken satay</a>, the right peanut butter quantity ensures perfect sauce consistency. Digital scales provide the most accurate method, but tablespoon conversions help when scales aren't available. Remember that natural peanut butter may measure differently due to oil separation, so stir well before measuring.</p>

<p>Many air fryer enthusiasts prefer weighing ingredients rather than using volume measurements for better consistency. This is particularly true for sticky ingredients like peanut butter that can be difficult to level off in spoons. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a> includes both weight and volume measurements to accommodate all cooking preferences. When developing your own air fryer creations, starting with accurate measurements like this 0.75 tbsp to gram conversion gives you a reliable foundation to experiment from.</p>

<h3>How to measure peanut butter without scales</h3>
<p>If you don't have digital scales, there are tricks to measure 0.75 tbsp (11.25g) of peanut butter accurately. First, use proper measuring spoons rather than tableware - standard UK tablespoons hold 15ml. For 0.75 tbsp, fill the spoon three-quarters full, using a knife to level it off. Alternatively, measure 1 tbsp and remove about a quarter of it. Warming the peanut butter slightly can make it easier to work with, but don't overheat as this affects the weight. These methods work well for most <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>air fryer desserts</a> requiring peanut butter.</p>

<h2>Peanut butter conversions for different recipes</h2>
<p>Understanding how 0.75 tbsp converts to grams opens up countless air fryer recipe possibilities. For peanut butter cookies, you might need multiples of this measurement - 3 tbsp would be 45g. When making satay sauce for <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/shrimp>air fryer shrimp</a>, you could scale up to 6 tbsp (90g) for more servings. The same conversion applies whether you're using smooth or crunchy peanut butter, though the latter may pack slightly differently. Always check if your recipe specifies packed or loose measurements, as this affects the final weight.</p>

<p>For those watching their intake, knowing that 0.75 tbsp of peanut butter equals 11.25g helps with accurate calorie counting. This measurement contains about 70 calories, making it easy to portion control when creating healthier air fryer meals. When substituting peanut butter in recipes, remember that almond or cashew butter have similar weights per tablespoon. Keep your air fryer in top condition with our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning guide</a> to ensure perfect results every time you cook with sticky ingredients like peanut butter.</p>

<h3>Common peanut butter measurement equivalents</h3>
<p>Beyond 0.75 tbsp, it's helpful to know other common peanut butter conversions. 1 tablespoon equals 15g, while 1 teaspoon is 5g. For larger quantities, Â¼ cup is about 60g and Â½ cup approximately 120g. These conversions work for most UK peanut butter brands, though checking your specific product's nutrition label can provide the most accurate weight per volume. When adapting conventional oven recipes for your air fryer, these measurements ensure you maintain the right ingredient ratios for success.</p>

<h2>How to Measure 500g of Almond Butter Accurately</h2>  
<p>Using a digital kitchen scale is the most accurate way to measure 500g of almond butter. Set your scale to grams, tare the container, and scoop the almond butter until it hits 500g. If your scale only shows ounces, aim for 17.64 oz. For those without scales, tablespoons can work in a pinch—but this method is less precise.</p>  
<p>Almond butter’s density can vary depending on whether it’s natural or processed. Stirring it well before measuring ensures consistency.

<p>2 tablespoons (tbsp) of icing sugar equals approximately 16 grams (g) in the UK. This conversion is essential for precise baking, especially when using an air fryer, where accurate measurements can make or break your recipe. Whether you’re whipping up a quick cake or dusting desserts, knowing how many grams are in 2 tbsp of icing sugar ensures consistency.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Baking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers cook food quickly and evenly, but they rely on precise ingredient ratios for the best results. Too much or too little icing sugar can affect texture and taste, particularly in delicate bakes like sponges or cookies. For example, if you’re making <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer cookies</a>, an extra gram or two of icing sugar could make them overly sweet or crumbly.</p>  

<p>Using a digital scale is the most reliable way to measure 2 tbsp of icing sugar in grams. Scooping directly from the bag can lead to inconsistencies due to settling or packing. For reference, 1 tbsp of icing sugar is roughly 8 grams, so doubling that gives you the 16-gram measurement for 2 tbsp. This precision is especially helpful for <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>air fryer cakes</a>, where balance is key.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure Icing Sugar Without a Scale</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a scale, lightly spoon the icing sugar into a tablespoon and level it off with a knife for the most accurate volume measurement. Avoid packing it down, as this can add up to 20% more sugar than intended. For context, 2 tbsp of icing sugar is about ⅛ of a standard UK cup (120g).</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for 2 Tbsp of Icing Sugar in Air Fryer Recipes</h2>  
<p>This small but mighty measurement pops up in many air fryer recipes. From dusting <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>air fryer desserts</a> like doughnuts to sweetening glazes for pastries, 16 grams of icing sugar delivers just the right touch of sweetness. It’s also perfect for light frostings or mixing into batters for a subtle sugar lift.</p>  

<p>For savoury-sweet balance, try adding 2 tbsp (16g) of icing sugar to a spice rub for <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>air fryer chicken wings</a>. The sugar caramelises during cooking, creating a deliciously sticky glaze. Check our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more measurement hacks.</p>  

<h3>UK vs. US Measurements: A Quick Note</h3>  
<p>While UK and US tablespoons are similar (15ml vs. 14.8ml), slight variations can affect grams. The 16g measurement applies to UK tablespoons. If using US recipes, the difference is negligible for icing sugar but worth noting for other ingredients.</p>

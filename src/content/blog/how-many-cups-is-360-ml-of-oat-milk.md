<p>360 ml of oat milk is approximately 1.52 cups in the US and 1.27 cups in the UK. This conversion is essential for recipes, especially when using an air fryer, where precise measurements can make or break a dish. Whether you're baking or cooking, knowing how to convert 360 ml of oat milk to cups ensures consistency and perfect results every time.</p>

<h2>Understanding the Conversion</h2>
<p>Converting 360 ml of oat milk to cups depends on the cup measurement system you're using. In the US, a standard cup is 240 ml, while in the UK, it's 284 ml. This means 360 ml of oat milk equals roughly 1.52 US cups or 1.27 UK cups. For air fryer recipes, accuracy is key, so always double-check your measurements.</p>
<p>If you're using a recipe from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, it might follow UK measurements. However, many online recipes use US cups, so it's helpful to know both conversions. A handy tip is to keep a conversion chart, like the one on our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>, nearby for quick reference.</p>

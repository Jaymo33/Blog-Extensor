<p>360 ml of oat milk is approximately 1.52 cups in the US and 1.27 cups in the UK. This conversion is essential for recipes, especially when using an air fryer, where precise measurements can make or break a dish. Whether you're baking or cooking, knowing how to convert 360 ml of oat milk to cups ensures consistency and perfect results every time.</p>

<h2>Understanding the Conversion</h2>
<p>Converting 360 ml of oat milk to cups depends on the cup measurement system you're using. In the US, a standard cup is 240 ml, while in the UK, it's 284 ml. This means 360 ml of oat milk equals roughly 1.52 US cups or 1.27 UK cups. For air fryer recipes, accuracy is key, so always double-check your measurements.</p>
<p>If you're using a recipe from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, it might follow UK measurements. However, many online recipes use US cups, so it's helpful to know both conversions. A handy tip is to keep a conversion chart, like the one on our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>, nearby for quick reference.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter</h2>
<p>When cooking or baking, especially in an air fryer, precise measurements ensure your dishes turn out as intended. Too much or too little liquid, like 360 ml of oat milk, can affect texture and taste. For example, adding 1.52 US cups instead of 1.27 UK cups could make your batter too runny.</p>
<p>Oat milk is a popular dairy alternative, and its consistency can vary slightly between brands. Measuring 360 ml of oat milk accurately helps maintain recipe integrity. If you're exploring new recipes, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a> for inspiration.</p>

<h3>Tools for Measuring 360 ml of Oat Milk</h3>
<p>Using a liquid measuring cup is the easiest way to measure 360 ml of oat milk. Look for one with both metric and imperial markings for versatility. If you don't have a measuring cup, a kitchen scale can helpâ€”oat milk weighs roughly 1 gram per ml, so 360 ml equals 360 grams.</p>

<h3>Common Uses for 360 ml of Oat Milk</h3>
<p>360 ml of oat milk is a common measurement in many recipes, from pancakes to sauces. In air fryer cooking, it's often used for batters or marinades. For example, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/breakfast>breakfast recipes</a> often call for this amount to create fluffy, dairy-free pancakes.</p>

<h2>Converting Other Amounts</h2>
<p>If you need to convert amounts other than 360 ml of oat milk, the same principles apply. For instance, 180 ml is roughly 0.76 US cups or 0.63 UK cups. Keeping a conversion chart handy, like the one on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, simplifies the process.</p>
<p>Remember, air fryer cooking often requires precision, so always measure carefully. Whether you're making a cake or a creamy sauce, knowing how to convert 360 ml of oat milk to cups ensures success.</p>

<h3>Tips for Baking with Oat Milk</h3>

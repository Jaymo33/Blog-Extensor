<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on even cooking, and the right amount of sauce ensures your food isn’t too dry or soggy. Using 25g of BBQ sauce (0.88 ounces) guarantees balanced flavour without overwhelming the dish. Many recipes on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> specify weights in grams, so conversions like 25g to ounces are handy. This is especially true for marinades, where consistency affects texture. Too much sauce can lead to uneven cooking, while too little might leave your meal bland.</p>  

<p>For example, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipes</a> often call for precise BBQ sauce quantities. A 25g (0.88-ounce) coating ensures crispy skin without excess drips. If you’re meal prepping, converting 25g of BBQ sauce to ounces helps standardise portions. This way, every batch tastes just as good as the last.</p>  

<h3>How to measure 25g of BBQ sauce without scales</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have digital scales, you can estimate 25g of BBQ sauce using tablespoons. One tablespoon is roughly 15g, so 25g is just under two tablespoons. For UK cooks, this means 1.5 tablespoons equals about 0.88 ounces. A <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>clean air fryer basket</a> also ensures even distribution, preventing clumping.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for 25g of BBQ sauce in air fryer recipes</h2>  
<p>From glazes to dips, 25g of BBQ sauce (0.88 ounces) is versatile. It’s enough to coat six chicken wings or a single salmon fillet perfectly. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a> includes dishes where this measurement shines, like sticky ribs or BBQ cauliflower bites. The key is spreading the sauce evenly for maximum flavour.</p>  

<p>For frozen foods like nuggets or prawns, 25g of BBQ sauce makes a great dipping portion. Converted to ounces (0.88), it’s easy to divide for meal prep. Whether you’re cooking for one or a family, this measurement keeps things consistent. Plus, it’s easy to scale up if you’re batch-cooking.</p>  

<h3>Converting other BBQ sauce quantities</h3>  
<p>Need 50g? That’s 1.76 ounces. For 100g, it’s 3.53 ounces. These conversions help when adjusting recipes. Remember, air fryers cook quickly, so precise sauce amounts prevent burning. Too much sugar in BBQ sauce can caramelise too fast, so sticking to 25g (0.88 ounces) is often ideal.</p>

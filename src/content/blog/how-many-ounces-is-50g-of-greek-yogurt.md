<h2>Why convert 50g of greek yogurt to ounces?</h2>

<h2>How to measure 50g of greek yogurt without scales</h2>
<p>If you don’t have scales, you can still measure 50g of greek yogurt accurately. One tablespoon of greek yogurt weighs around 15g, so 3 tablespoons plus a teaspoon will give you roughly 50g. This equals about 1.76 ounces, making it easy to portion for air fryer recipes.</p>
<p>For thicker greek yogurt, you might need to level off the tablespoons for an exact measure.

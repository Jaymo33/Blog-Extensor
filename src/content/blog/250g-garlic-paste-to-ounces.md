<p>250g of garlic paste equals approximately 8.82 ounces. This conversion is handy for air fryer recipes, ensuring you get the right flavour balance in your dishes. Whether you’re whipping up a marinade or adding a punch to your meal prep, knowing this measurement saves time and hassle.</p>  

<h2>Why convert 250g of garlic paste to ounces?</h2>  
<p>Many UK recipes, especially those for air fryers, list ingredients in grams, while some cooks prefer using ounces. Converting 250g of garlic paste to ounces ensures accuracy, whether you’re following a recipe from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> or improvising. Garlic paste is a staple in dishes like marinades, sauces, and even <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipes</a>, so getting the measurement right matters.</p>  

<p>Using the correct amount of garlic paste avoids overpowering your dish or diluting the flavour. For air fryer cooking, precise measurements help achieve consistent results, whether you’re roasting vegetables or preparing a protein-packed meal. If you’re unsure about other conversions, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for quick reference.</p>  

<h3>How to measure 250g of garlic paste accurately</h3>  
<p>A kitchen scale is the easiest way to measure 250g of garlic paste. If you don’t have one, tablespoons can work in a pinch—roughly 16 tablespoons equal 250g. However, scales are more reliable for air fryer recipes, where precision affects cooking times and textures.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for 250g of garlic paste in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Garlic paste adds depth to marinades for meats like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/beef>beef</a> or <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/shrimp>shrimp</a>. A 250g portion is ideal for batch cooking, ensuring you have enough for multiple meals. It’s also great for seasoning roasted vegetables or mixing into dips.</p>  

<p>Since air fryers cook food quickly, garlic paste infuses flavours faster than raw garlic. This makes it a go-to for busy cooks. If you’re cleaning your air fryer after using garlic-heavy recipes, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning guide</a> has handy tips to remove lingering odours.</p>  

<h3>Storing leftover garlic paste</h3>  
<p>If you don’t use all 250g of garlic paste at once, store it in an airtight container in the fridge for up to two weeks. For longer storage, freeze it in ice cube trays—each cube holds about 15g, making future conversions even easier.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of tomato sauce can make or break your dish. Too much, and your meal might turn soggy; too little, and it could end up dry. The air fryer's rapid circulation means ingredients cook faster, so precision is key. For dishes like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>air fryer chicken recipes</a>, a well-measured sauce ensures even coating and perfect crispiness. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more handy measurement swaps.</p>  

<p>Tomato sauce is a staple in many cuisines, from Italian pastas to Mexican enchiladas. When adapting these for the air fryer, 285 ml of tomato sauce (or 1.2 cups) is a common measurement. Whether you're cooking for one or meal prepping, this conversion saves time and reduces waste.

<h3>How to Measure 285 ml of Tomato Sauce Without a Measuring Cup</h3>  
<p>No measuring cup? No problem. A standard UK mug holds roughly 284 ml, making it a close substitute for 285 ml of tomato sauce. Alternatively, use a kitchen scale—285 ml weighs about 300 grams. For sticky sauces, lightly grease your measuring tool to ensure every drop counts. These hacks are especially useful for <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable-based dishes</a> where sauce consistency is crucial.</p>  

<h2>Common Recipes Using 285 ml of Tomato Sauce</h2>  
<p>Many air fryer recipes call for 285 ml (1.2 cups) of tomato sauce. Think homemade pizzas, stuffed peppers, or even meatball subs. The air fryer locks in moisture, so the sauce stays rich and flavourful. For frozen foods like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/frozen-foods>air fryer frozen meals</a>, adding 285 ml of tomato sauce can elevate store-bought basics into gourmet delights.</p>  

<p>If you're batch-cooking, remember that 285 ml of tomato sauce covers roughly 2-3 servings. Adjust accordingly for larger families or meal prep. Leftover sauce? Store it in an airtight container and reheat it in the air fryer for 2-3 minutes.

<h3>US vs. UK Cup Measurements for Tomato Sauce</h3>  
<p>In the UK, 1 cup equals 284 ml, while the US uses 240 ml. This means 285 ml of tomato sauce is 1.2 US cups or 1 UK cup plus a teaspoon. Always check your recipe's origin to avoid mishaps. Most modern air fryer recipes specify which standard they use, but when in doubt, stick to millilitres for precision.</p>

<p>2 tablespoons (tbsp) of butter equals approximately 28 grams (g). This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes, where precise measurements can make or break your dish. Whether you’re whipping up a batch of cookies or preparing a savoury meal, knowing the exact weight ensures consistency. For more air fryer conversions, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Butter Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Using the correct amount of butter is crucial for achieving the perfect texture and flavour in your air fryer dishes. Too much butter can lead to greasy results, while too little might leave your food dry. For example, if you’re making air fryer cookies, 28 grams of butter per 2 tbsp ensures the dough binds properly without becoming overly rich. Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> for inspiration on how to use butter effectively.</p>  

<p>In the UK, butter is often sold in blocks with markings for tablespoons and grams, making it easier to measure. However, if you’re using a kitchen scale, weighing 28 grams for 2 tbsp guarantees precision. This is especially helpful for recipes like air fryer cakes, where exact proportions are key. For more baking tips, visit our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>cake recipes</a> section.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure Butter Without Scales</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a kitchen scale, you can still measure 2 tbsp of butter accurately. Most UK butter blocks have tablespoon markings on the wrapper, so simply cut along the indicated lines. Alternatively, a standard tablespoon holds about 14 grams of butter, so two level tablespoons will give you roughly 28 grams. For more measurement hacks, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion guide</a>.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for 2 Tbsp of Butter in Air Fryers</h2>  
<p>Two tablespoons of butter (28 grams) are often used in air fryer recipes to add richness and moisture. For instance, brushing melted butter on air fryer garlic bread or mixing it into mashed potatoes enhances flavour. You can also use it to grease the air fryer basket lightly, preventing sticking without excess oil.

<p>Another popular use is in air fryer desserts, like cinnamon rolls or shortbread, where butter is a key ingredient. Measuring 28 grams ensures the right balance of crispiness and tenderness.

<h3>Butter Substitutes and Their Gram Equivalents</h3>  
<p>If you’re out of butter, you can substitute margarine or coconut oil, but the gram measurement may vary slightly. For example, 2 tbsp of margarine also weighs around 28 grams, while coconut oil is closer to 30 grams. Always adjust based on the substitute’s density for best results in your air fryer.</p>

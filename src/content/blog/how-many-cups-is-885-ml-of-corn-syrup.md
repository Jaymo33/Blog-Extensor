<p>885 ml of corn syrup is equivalent to approximately 3.75 cups. This conversion is essential for baking and cooking, especially when using an air fryer for recipes that require precise measurements. Whether you're making sticky buns, pecan pie, or glazes, knowing how to convert millilitres to cups ensures consistency in your dishes.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Baking is a science, and even small measurement discrepancies can affect the texture and taste of your final product. Corn syrup, with its thick consistency, needs precise measuring to avoid overly sticky or dry results. If you're using an air fryer for desserts like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>air fryer desserts</a>, getting the syrup ratio right is crucial for perfect caramelisation.</p>  

<p>Using a liquid measuring cup for corn syrup ensures accuracy. Pouring it slowly and levelling it off prevents air bubbles, which can throw off your measurements.

<h3>UK vs. US Cup Measurements</h3>  
<p>It's worth noting that UK and US cup measurements differ slightly. In the UK, 1 cup equals 284 ml, while in the US, it's 236.6 ml. For 885 ml of corn syrup, this means roughly 3.75 US cups or 3.1 UK cups. Always double-check which standard your recipe follows to avoid errors.</p>  

<h2>How to Measure Corn Syrup Without a Cup</h2>  
<p>If you don’t have a measuring cup, you can use a kitchen scale. Corn syrup weighs about 1.42 grams per ml, so 885 ml would be around 1257 grams. Alternatively, tablespoons can help—16 tablespoons make 1 US cup, so 885 ml would be about 60 tablespoons. This method is handy for smaller batches.</p>  

<p>For air fryer recipes requiring corn syrup, like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer cookies</a>, precision ensures even cooking. Too much syrup can cause burning, while too little may leave your treats dry. Always measure carefully for the best results.</p>  

<h3>Common Recipes Using 885 ml of Corn Syrup</h3>  
<p>This quantity is often used in large-batch baking, such as pecan pies, marshmallow treats, or homemade candies. In an air fryer, you might use it for glazing ham or making sticky ribs. The key is to distribute the syrup evenly for consistent flavour and texture.</p>  

<h2>Cleaning Up After Using Corn Syrup</h2>  
<p>Corn syrup is notoriously sticky, so cleanup is essential. Wipe your air fryer basket with warm, soapy water immediately after use. For stubborn residue, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner guide</a> has handy tips to keep your appliance spotless.</p>

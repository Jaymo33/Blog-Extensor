<p>3 tablespoons of milk weigh approximately 45 grams. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements can make all the difference. Whether you're baking, making sauces, or preparing batters, knowing the exact weight ensures consistency. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we focus on accuracy to help you achieve the best results every time.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on even heat distribution, and incorrect measurements can throw off cooking times and textures. For example, using too much milk in a batter can make it too runny, while too little can dry it out. Converting 3 tbsp of milk to grams (45g) ensures your recipes stay balanced. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more handy measurements.</p>  

<p>Many air fryer recipes, like cakes or pancakes, require milk for moisture and richness. If you're working with a UK recipe, it’s especially important to use grams for accuracy, as tablespoon sizes can vary slightly. For more delicious ideas, browse our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> collection.</p>  

<h3>How to measure 3 tbsp of milk correctly</h3>  
<p>Use a standard UK tablespoon (15ml) to measure your milk. Fill it to the brim without overflowing for an accurate 15ml per tablespoon. Three level tablespoons will give you roughly 45 grams of milk. For sticky ingredients, a digital kitchen scale is even more reliable.</p>  

<h2>Common recipes using 3 tbsp of milk</h2>  
<p>From fluffy pancakes to creamy sauces, 3 tbsp of milk (45g) is a common measurement in air fryer cooking. Try it in our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>air fryer cake recipes</a> for a moist crumb. You can also use it in batters for crispy chicken or fish, ensuring a perfect golden finish.</p>  

<p>If you're reheating leftovers, a splash of milk (about 3 tbsp) can revive dishes like mashed potatoes or soups. For tips on keeping your air fryer in top shape, visit our guide on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning your air fryer</a>.</p>  

<h3>Does milk type affect the weight?</h3>  
<p>Whole milk, skimmed milk, and plant-based alternatives like almond milk have similar densities, so 3 tbsp will still weigh around 45 grams. However, condensed milk is much thicker, so adjust accordingly if substituting.</p>

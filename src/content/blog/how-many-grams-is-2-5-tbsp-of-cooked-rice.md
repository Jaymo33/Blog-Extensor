Itâ€™s also useful when adapting stovetop recipes for your air fryer. For recipe ideas, browse our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> collection.</p>

<p>Rice expands when cooked, so volume measurements like tablespoons can be tricky. Weighing in grams gives precision, whether you're cooking for one or meal prepping. If you're using leftover rice, 2.5 tbsp cooked rice in grams helps maintain recipe accuracy. This is particularly helpful with fried rice dishes that cook beautifully in air fryers.</p>

<h2>How we calculated 2.5 tbsp cooked rice to grams</h2>
<p>Our conversion is based on standard UK measurements where 1 tablespoon of cooked rice equals 15 grams. Therefore, 2.5 tbsp cooked rice weight in grams is simply 15 x 2.5 = 37.5g.

<h3>Factors that affect rice weight</h3>
<p>The exact grams in 2.5 tablespoon of cooked rice can vary based on rice type and cooking method. Overcooked rice holds more water, while undercooked grains are drier.

<h2>Converting other rice measurements</h2>
<p>If you need to convert different amounts, here's a quick reference: 1 tbsp = 15g, 2 tbsp = 30g, 3 tbsp = 45g, and so on. These conversions work for most UK tablespoon measurements of cooked rice. When adapting recipes from cups to grams, remember that 1 cup of cooked rice is about 185g.</p>

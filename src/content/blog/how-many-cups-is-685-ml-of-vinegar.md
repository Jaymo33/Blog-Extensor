<p>685 ml of vinegar equals approximately 2.89 cups. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes, where precise measurements can make or break a dish. Whether you're whipping up a tangy marinade or a zesty sauce, knowing how to convert millilitres to cups ensures consistency. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we understand the importance of accurate measurements for perfect results every time.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Vinegar Measurements Matter</h2>
<p>Using the right amount of vinegar in your air fryer recipes ensures balanced flavours and optimal cooking. Too much vinegar can overpower a dish, while too little might leave it bland. For example, a recipe like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer chicken wings</a> relies on the perfect vinegar-to-sauce ratio for that crispy, tangy finish. Measuring 685 ml of vinegar correctly guarantees your marinades, dressings, and sauces turn out just right.</p>
<p>Vinegar also plays a key role in tenderising meats and adding acidity to balance rich flavours. Whether you're cooking <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>roasted vegetables</a> or marinating proteins, precise measurements ensure consistency. A slight miscalculation could alter the dish’s taste or texture, so it’s worth double-checking your conversions.</p>

<h2>How to Measure 685 ml of Vinegar Without a Measuring Cup</h2>
<p>If you don’t have a measuring cup handy, you can still measure 685 ml of vinegar using common kitchen tools. A standard UK tablespoon holds 15 ml, so 685 ml would be roughly 45.6 tablespoons. Alternatively, a large mug typically holds around 300 ml, so two mugs plus a bit extra would get you close to 685 ml.

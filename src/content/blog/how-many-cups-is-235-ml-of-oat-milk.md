<p>235 ml of oat milk is approximately 1 cup. This conversion is essential for baking, cooking, or preparing air fryer recipes where precise measurements matter. Whether you're whipping up a cake or a creamy sauce, knowing how to convert millilitres to cups ensures your dish turns out perfectly.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of oat milk can make or break your recipe. Too little, and your baked goods might turn out dry. Too much, and they could become soggy. For air fryer recipes, precise measurements help achieve that perfect crispiness. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we emphasise the importance of accuracy for consistent results.</p>  

<p>Oat milk is a popular dairy-free alternative, but its consistency can vary slightly between brands. Measuring 235 ml of oat milk correctly ensures your recipes maintain the right texture and flavour. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more handy measurement tips.</p>  

<h2>Converting 235 ml of Oat Milk to Cups</h2>  
<p>In the UK and the US, cup measurements differ slightly. A standard UK cup holds 250 ml, while a US cup is about 240 ml. For 235 ml of oat milk, you’re looking at just under 1 UK cup or roughly 0.98 US cups. This small difference usually won’t affect most recipes, but it’s good to be aware of.</p>  

<p>If you’re using an air fryer, slight variations in liquid measurements can impact cooking times. For example, adding a bit more oat milk might require adjusting the temperature or duration. Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipes</a> for inspiration on how to use oat milk in your air fryer dishes.</p>  

<h3>Measuring Without a Scale</h3>  
<p>Don’t have a measuring jug? You can use a standard drinking glass or mug to estimate 235 ml of oat milk. Most mugs hold around 250 ml, so filling it just below the rim should give you roughly the right amount. For more precise methods, check our guide on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning and maintaining your air fryer</a> to keep your tools in top shape.</p>  

<h2>Using Oat Milk in Air Fryer Recipes</h2>  
<p>Oat milk works wonderfully in air fryer recipes, from batters to sauces. Its mild, slightly sweet flavour complements both sweet and savoury dishes. Whether you’re making pancakes or a creamy pasta bake, 235 ml of oat milk (or roughly 1 cup) is a versatile measurement to remember.</p>  

<p>For those who love baking, oat milk can replace dairy milk in most recipes without altering the texture. Try it in our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>cake recipes</a> for a delicious dairy-free twist. The air fryer’s even heat distribution ensures your bakes come out perfectly every time.</p>  

<h3>Common Mistakes to Avoid</h3>  
<p>One mistake people make is assuming all plant-based milks measure the same. Oat milk is slightly thicker than almond milk, so 235 ml of oat milk might behave differently in recipes. Always measure carefully to avoid inconsistencies.</p>

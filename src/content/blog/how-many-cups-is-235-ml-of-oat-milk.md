<p>235 ml of oat milk is approximately 1 cup. This conversion is essential for baking, cooking, or preparing air fryer recipes where precise measurements matter. Whether you're whipping up a cake or a creamy sauce, knowing how to convert millilitres to cups ensures your dish turns out perfectly.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of oat milk can make or break your recipe. Too little, and your baked goods might turn out dry. Too much, and they could become soggy. For air fryer recipes, precise measurements help achieve that perfect crispiness. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we emphasise the importance of accuracy for consistent results.</p>  

<p>Oat milk is a popular dairy-free alternative, but its consistency can vary slightly between brands.

<h2>Converting 235 ml of Oat Milk to Cups</h2>  
<p>In the UK and the US, cup measurements differ slightly. A standard UK cup holds 250 ml, while a US cup is about 240 ml. For 235 ml of oat milk, you’re looking at just under 1 UK cup or roughly 0.98 US cups. This small difference usually won’t affect most recipes, but it’s good to be aware of.</p>  

<p>If you’re using an air fryer, slight variations in liquid measurements can impact cooking times. For example, adding a bit more oat milk might require adjusting the temperature or duration.

<p>3 tablespoons of onion equals approximately 30 grams. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes, where precise measurements can make or break a dish. Whether you're prepping a stir-fry, soup, or crispy onion toppings, knowing the exact weight ensures consistency. For more air fryer conversions, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>handy conversion chart</a>.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate onion measurements matter</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of onion can significantly impact flavour and texture in air fryer dishes. Too little, and your meal might lack depth; too much, and it could overpower other ingredients. Onions also vary in density—finely chopped vs. roughly diced—so weighing ensures accuracy. For recipe inspiration, browse our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> featuring onions.</p>  

<p>Air fryers cook food quickly, so balanced proportions are key. A 30-gram portion of onion (3 tbsp) works perfectly for most single-serving dishes. If you're meal prepping, scale up accordingly and store leftovers properly. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable category</a> includes more onion-based ideas.</p>  

<h3>How to measure 3 tbsp of onion correctly</h3>  
<p>For the most accurate 3 tbsp onion to grams conversion, lightly pack the chopped onion into a tablespoon without pressing too hard. Level off the top with a knife for consistency. If your recipe calls for grams, a kitchen scale is your best friend—especially for air fryer cooking, where precision matters.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for 3 tbsp onion in air fryer recipes</h2>  
<p>Thirty grams of onion (3 tbsp) is ideal for adding flavour to smaller dishes. Try it in air-fried frittatas, stuffed mushrooms, or as a base for mini kebabs. It's also the perfect amount for seasoning breadcrumbs or topping loaded fries. Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/breakfast>breakfast recipes</a> for onion-infused morning ideas.</p>  

<p>For larger batches, multiply the 3 tbsp onion to grams ratio accordingly. Remember that onions shrink when cooked, especially in the air fryer's intense heat. Always account for this when prepping ingredients. Keep your air fryer in top shape with our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning guide</a> to maintain optimal performance.</p>  

<h3>Converting other onion measurements</h3>  
<p>If your recipe uses different units, here's a quick reference: 1 small onion (70g) equals about 7 tbsp chopped, while 1 medium onion (110g) is roughly 11 tbsp. For minced onion, 1 tbsp weighs around 8 grams. Bookmark <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> for more conversion tips and tricks.</p>

<p>5 tablespoons (tbsp) of margarine equals approximately 70 grams (g). This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precision matters. Whether you’re baking, frying, or roasting, knowing the exact weight ensures consistent results. Margarine’s density can vary slightly, but 70g is the standard UK measurement for 5 tbsp. Stick to this for foolproof cooking in your air fryer.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on even heat distribution, and incorrect ingredient quantities can throw off your dish. Too much margarine might make food greasy, while too little can dry it out. That’s why converting 5 tbsp of margarine to grams (70g) is so useful. For more air fryer tips, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>. It’s a lifesaver for baking and frying alike.</p>  

<p>Many UK recipes use grams for precision, especially in baking. If you’re adapting a traditional recipe for your air fryer, converting tablespoons to grams is a must. Margarine is a common ingredient in cakes, cookies, and even savoury dishes. Visit our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipes section</a> for inspiration on how to use 5 tbsp (70g) of margarine in delicious air fryer meals.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure Margarine Without Scales</h3>  
<p>Don’t have kitchen scales? No problem! You can still measure 5 tbsp of margarine accurately. Most UK margarine tubs have markings on the side indicating tablespoons or grams. Alternatively, use a standard tablespoon—level it off for an exact measure. Remember, 1 tbsp of margarine is roughly 14g, so 5 tbsp equals 70g. For more handy tips, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning and maintenance guide</a> to keep your air fryer in top shape.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for 5 tbsp of Margarine in Air Fryer Recipes</h2>  
<p>From crispy roast potatoes to fluffy cakes, margarine is a versatile ingredient. Using 70g (5 tbsp) ensures your dishes turn out perfectly. Try it in air fryer cookies for a buttery texture or brush it over vegetables before roasting. For savoury ideas, browse our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/potatoes>potato recipes</a>, where margarine adds richness without excess oil.</p>  

<p>Margarine also works well in air fryer pastry dishes. Whether you’re making sausage rolls or shortcrust pies, 70g (5 tbsp) provides the right consistency. If you’re new to air frying, start with simple recipes and gradually experiment. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert category</a> has plenty of sweet treats that use this measurement.</p>  

<h3>Does Margarine Type Affect the Weight?</h3>  
<p>While most margarines weigh roughly the same per tablespoon, some low-fat versions may differ slightly. Always check the packaging for exact conversions if you’re using a specialty product. For standard UK margarine, 5 tbsp will reliably equal 70g. Stick to trusted brands for consistent results in your air fryer creations.</p>

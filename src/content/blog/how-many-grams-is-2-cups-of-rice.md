<p>2.0 cups of rice equals approximately 400 grams, though this can vary slightly depending on the type of rice and how it’s packed. Whether you're cooking in an air fryer or preparing a stovetop dish, accurate measurements ensure perfect results every time. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we know how crucial conversions are for hassle-free cooking.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Rice Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Getting the right amount of rice is essential, especially when using an air fryer for recipes like crispy rice cakes or stuffed peppers. Too much rice can lead to uneven cooking, while too little might leave your dish dry. Converting 2.0 cups of rice to grams helps standardise measurements, whether you’re following a UK or US recipe.

<p>Different rice types, such as basmati, jasmine, or brown rice, have slightly varying weights per cup. For example, 2.0 cups of long-grain white rice typically weigh around 400 grams, while short-grain might be denser. Always fluff the rice before measuring for consistency.

<h3>UK vs. US Cup Measurements</h3>  
<p>Did you know a UK cup (250ml) differs slightly from a US cup (240ml)? For 2.0 cups of rice, this means a small variance in grams. In the UK, 2.0 cups equal roughly 400 grams, while in the US, it’s closer to 384 grams. If precision matters, use a kitchen scale or refer to our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe guides</a> for foolproof results.</p>  

<h2>How to Measure Rice Correctly</h2>  
<p>Scooping rice directly from the bag can pack it down, leading to inaccurate measurements. Instead, spoon rice lightly into the measuring cup and level it off with a knife. For 2.0 cups of rice, this method ensures you’re closer to the 400-gram mark. If you’re adapting stovetop recipes for the air fryer, precise grams-to-cups conversions prevent under or overcooking.</p>  

<p>For dishes like air-fried rice balls or sushi, consistency is key. Brown rice, for instance, absorbs more water and may need adjustments.

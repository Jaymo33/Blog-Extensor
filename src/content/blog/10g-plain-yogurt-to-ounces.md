<p>10g of plain yogurt equals approximately 0.35 ounces. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precision matters, especially when baking or making sauces. Whether you’re following a recipe from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> or creating your own, knowing this measurement ensures consistency. Plain yogurt is a versatile ingredient, often used in marinades, dips, or even air-fried desserts like cakes and muffins.</p>

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on even cooking, and incorrect ingredient quantities can throw off textures and flavours. For example, adding too much yogurt to a batter might make it overly dense, while too little could dry it out. Many recipes on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes</a> specify weights in grams, so converting to ounces helps if your scales only display imperial units. This is particularly useful for UK cooks who might use both measurement systems interchangeably.</p>  

<p>Yogurt also plays a role in tenderising meats or adding moisture to baked goods. If you’re meal prepping with your air fryer, precise measurements ensure your dishes turn out perfectly every time.

<h3>How to measure 10g of plain yogurt without scales</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have digital scales, you can use a measuring spoon for a close approximation. One tablespoon of plain yogurt is roughly 15g, so two-thirds of a tablespoon will give you about 10g. For ounces, this translates to just over a third of an ounce. While not as precise as weighing, this method works well for most air fryer recipes, especially when making sauces or marinades.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for 10g of plain yogurt in air fryer recipes</h2>  
<p>Plain yogurt is a staple in many air fryer dishes, from marinades for chicken to creamy dips for vegetables. A 10g portion might seem small, but it’s often enough to coat a single chicken breast or mix into a batter for air-fried desserts. For inspiration, browse the <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipe category</a> on our site, where yogurt-based marinades feature prominently.</p>  

<p>Yogurt also works wonders in air-fried cakes or muffins, adding moisture without excess fat. If you’re making a small batch, 10g could be the perfect amount. For cleaning your air fryer afterward, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner guide</a> has tips to keep it spotless.</p>  

<h3>Converting other yogurt quantities to ounces</h3>  
<p>If your recipe calls for larger amounts, here’s a quick reference: 50g of plain yogurt equals about 1.76 ounces, while 100g is roughly 3.53 ounces. These conversions are handy when scaling recipes up or down for your air fryer. Remember, thicker Greek yogurt will weigh slightly more per volume than regular plain yogurt, so adjust accordingly.</p>

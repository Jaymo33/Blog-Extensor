<p>110 ml of double cream is approximately 0.46 cups (just under half a cup). This conversion is essential for baking and cooking, especially when using an air fryer for creamy desserts or sauces. Whether you're whipping up a cake or a rich pasta dish, knowing this measurement ensures consistency in your recipes.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Precision is key in cooking, especially when working with rich ingredients like double cream. Too much or too little can alter the texture and taste of your dish. For air fryer recipes, where even heating is crucial, accurate measurements help achieve the perfect result. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more handy tips.</p>  

<p>Double cream is thicker than single cream, so its volume-to-weight ratio differs slightly. This means 110 ml won’t perfectly match standard cup measurements, but 0.46 cups is a reliable approximation.

<h3>Measuring Double Cream Without Scales</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a measuring jug, use a standard metric cup (250 ml) and fill it just under halfway for 110 ml. Alternatively, tablespoons can help—7 tablespoons of double cream roughly equal 110 ml. This method works well for quick adjustments in recipes like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>air fryer desserts</a>.</p>  

<h2>UK vs. US Cup Measurements</h2>  
<p>In the UK, a standard cup is 250 ml, while in the US, it’s 240 ml. This slight difference means 110 ml of double cream is 0.44 US cups and 0.46 UK cups. For most recipes, this variance won’t make a noticeable difference, but it’s good to know for precision baking.</p>  

<p>If you’re adapting a US recipe, stick to the 0.44-cup measure. For UK recipes, use 0.46 cups. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> guides are tailored to UK measurements, so you’ll always get accurate results.</p>  

<h3>Common Uses for 110 ml of Double Cream</h3>

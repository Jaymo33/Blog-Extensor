<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of fish sauce can elevate your air fryer dishes, from crispy salmon to flavourful tofu. Too little, and your meal might lack depth; too much, and it could become overpowering. Fish sauce is a staple in many Asian-inspired air fryer recipes, so getting the 2 cups to ounces conversion right is key. Visit <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>our recipe collection</a> for inspiration on how to use fish sauce effectively.</p>  

<p>Most UK kitchens measure liquids by volume (cups) rather than weight (ounces), but weight is often more precise. This is especially true for air fryer cooking, where even small imbalances can affect texture and taste. If you're working with 2 cups of fish sauce, knowing it’s roughly 16 ounces helps streamline your prep.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure Fish Sauce for Air Fryer Recipes</h3>  
<p>For best results, use a liquid measuring cup for fish sauce rather than dry cups. The viscosity of fish sauce means it can cling to the sides, so level it off with a spatula. If you’re converting 2 cups of fish sauce to ounces, a kitchen scale set to fluid ounces (fl oz) will give the most accurate reading. Need cleaning tips for sticky fish sauce spills?

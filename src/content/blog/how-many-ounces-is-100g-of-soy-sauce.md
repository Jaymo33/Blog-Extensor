<p>100g of soy sauce equals approximately 3.53 ounces. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements can make or break your dish. Whether you’re marinating chicken, seasoning tofu, or whipping up a stir-fry, knowing how to convert grams to ounces ensures consistency. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we help you master these conversions for flawless cooking every time.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on even cooking, and incorrect measurements can lead to overly salty or bland dishes. Soy sauce, with its strong flavour, requires precision. Too much can overpower your meal, while too little might leave it tasting flat. By converting 100g of soy sauce to ounces (3.53 oz), you ensure balanced flavours. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for other common ingredient conversions.</p>  

<p>Many air fryer recipes, like our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipes</a>, call for soy sauce as a key ingredient. Whether you’re making teriyaki chicken or glazed salmon, knowing the exact ounce equivalent of 100g helps you follow recipes accurately. This is especially useful if your kitchen scale only measures in grams or ounces.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure Soy Sauce Without a Scale</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a scale, you can use volume measurements. One tablespoon of soy sauce weighs roughly 15g, so 100g is about 6.5 tablespoons. However, this method isn’t as precise as weighing, so a digital scale is recommended. For more tips, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a>, where we highlight the best tools for air fryer cooking.</p>

It’s also ideal for stir-fry sauces or as a base for dipping sauces. Visit <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> for creative ways to use soy sauce in your air fryer meals.</p>

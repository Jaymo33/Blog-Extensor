<p>0.125 cup of thai curry paste equals approximately 1 ounce (oz). This measurement is crucial for air fryer recipes where precise quantities ensure the perfect balance of flavours. Whether you’re making a spicy curry or a marinade, knowing this conversion helps avoid over or under-seasoning.</p>

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on even cooking and balanced flavours, so precise measurements are key. Too much thai curry paste can overpower your dish, while too little might leave it bland. Using 0.125 cup (1 oz) ensures consistency, especially when following recipes from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>.</p>  
<p>Many air fryer recipes, like those for <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken</a> or <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetables</a>, call for small amounts of paste. Measuring 0.125 cup correctly guarantees the right heat and flavour profile. It’s also useful for meal prepping, where batch cooking requires accuracy.</p>  

<h2>How to measure 0.125 cup of thai curry paste</h2>  
<p>Measuring 0.125 cup can be tricky without the right tools. A standard US cup holds 8 fluid ounces, so 0.125 cup is 1 ounce. For UK cooks, this translates to roughly 28 grams if using a kitchen scale. A tablespoon measure can help—0.125 cup equals 2 tablespoons.</p>  
<p>If you’re using a jar of thai curry paste, check the label for weight equivalents. Many brands list grams or ounces per tablespoon, making it easier to portion out 0.125 cup. For more conversions, refer to our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>  

<h3>Common mistakes when measuring thai curry paste</h3>  
<p>One mistake is using a heaped tablespoon instead of a level one, which can add extra ounces. Another is confusing fluid ounces with weight ounces—thai curry paste is dense, so weight matters more. Always use measuring spoons or a scale for accuracy.</p>  

<h2>Using 0.125 cup of thai curry paste in air fryer recipes</h2>  
<p>This quantity is perfect for marinades or sauces in air fryer dishes. For example, mix 0.125 cup (1 oz) with coconut milk for a <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/shrimp>shrimp</a> or tofu glaze. It’s also ideal for spicing up <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/potatoes>roasted potatoes</a> or wings.</p>  
<p>Remember, air fryers intensify flavours, so start with 0.125 cup and adjust to taste. For cleaning sticky paste residue, try our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner guide</a>.</p>  

<h3>Scaling up or down</h3>  
<p>Need more or less than 0.125 cup? Double it to 0.25 cup (2 oz) for larger batches or halve it to 1 tablespoon for milder dishes. The key is maintaining the ratio for consistent results.</p>

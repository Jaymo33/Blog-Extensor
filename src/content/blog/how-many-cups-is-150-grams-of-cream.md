<p>150 grams of cream is roughly equivalent to 0.63 cups (or just over half a cup) in standard UK and US measurements. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precision matters, especially in baking or creamy sauces. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we know how frustrating inaccurate measurements can be, so we’ve broken it down for you.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Cream Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of cream ensures your air fryer dishes turn out perfectly—whether you’re making a rich sauce, a fluffy cake, or a creamy pasta bake. Too much cream can make dishes soggy, while too little might leave them dry. For example, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer cheesecake</a> relies on precise cream measurements for the ideal texture. Always measure carefully, especially when converting grams to cups.</p>  

<p>Different types of cream (single, double, or whipping) have slight density variations, but 150 grams of any cream will still hover around 0.63 cups. If you’re using a kitchen scale, weigh the cream directly. No scale? Spoon the cream into a measuring cup without packing it down for the closest approximation.</p>  

<h2>Converting 150 Grams of Cream to Cups: Step-by-Step</h2>  
<p>To convert 150 grams of cream to cups, divide the weight by the density of cream (approximately 240 grams per cup). This gives you 150 ÷ 240 = 0.625 cups, which rounds to 0.63 cups.

<h3>US vs. UK Cup Measurements</h3>  
<p>While US and UK cups are nearly identical (1 US cup = 240 ml, 1 UK cup = 250 ml), the difference is negligible for cream conversions. Whether you’re following a British or American recipe, 150 grams of cream will still be roughly 0.63 cups.

<h2>Common Air Fryer Recipes Using 150 Grams of Cream</h2>

<h3>Tips for Measuring Cream Without a Scale</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a scale, use the displacement method: fill a liquid measuring cup to 1 cup, then add cream until the liquid rises to 1.63 cups (1 cup + 0.63 cups). This hack works well for thick creams like double or clotted cream, ensuring your air fryer recipes stay on track.</p>

<p>Lentils come in different varieties, such as green, red, and brown, but the weight per cup remains relatively consistent. However, slight variations may occur based on packing density. For best results, use a kitchen scale to measure 150 grams directly. This eliminates guesswork and guarantees perfect results every time.</p>

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on precise ingredient ratios to deliver crispy, evenly cooked results. Using the wrong amount of margarine can affect texture and browning. For example, too little margarine might leave your dish dry, while too much could make it greasy. That’s why converting 200g of margarine to ounces (7.05 oz) is so important. If you’re working with other ingredients, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a> offers plenty of inspiration.</p>  

<p>Margarine is a common ingredient in air fryer recipes, from cakes to roasted vegetables. Knowing the exact weight ensures consistency, especially when scaling recipes up or down. A digital kitchen scale is the best tool for accuracy, but if you don’t have one, our conversion guide is a lifesaver.

<h3>How to measure 200g of margarine without a scale</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a scale, you can use tablespoons to measure margarine. One tablespoon of margarine weighs roughly 14g, so 200g would be about 14 tablespoons. However, this method isn’t as precise as weighing, so for best results, invest in a scale. For more measurement hacks, visit <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>.</p>

<p>200g of margarine (7.05 oz) is a versatile amount for many air fryer dishes. It’s perfect for baking cakes, greasing trays, or adding richness to roasted potatoes.

<h3>Margarine vs. butter in air fryer cooking</h3>

For most recipes, 200g of margarine (7.05 oz) works well, but adjustments may be needed. Experiment to find what suits your taste.</p>

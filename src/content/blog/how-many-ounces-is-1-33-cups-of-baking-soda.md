<p>1.33 cups of baking soda equals approximately 10.64 ounces. This conversion is essential for precise baking, especially when using an air fryer where measurements can make or break a recipe. Whether you're whipping up a batch of air fryer cookies or a savoury dish, knowing the exact weight ensures perfect results every time.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>
<p>Using the right amount of baking soda is crucial in air fryer recipes. Too little, and your baked goods won’t rise properly. Too much, and you’ll end up with a bitter taste. Air fryers cook food faster than conventional ovens, so precision is key to avoid mishaps.

<p>Baking soda is a leavening agent, and its weight can vary slightly depending on how it’s packed. Scooping it directly from the bag versus spooning it into a measuring cup can yield different results. That’s why weighing ingredients, like converting 1.33 cups of baking soda to ounces, ensures consistency.

<h2>How to Convert 1.33 Cups of Baking Soda to Ounces</h2>
<p>The standard conversion for baking soda is 1 cup = 8 ounces. Therefore, 1.33 cups of baking soda equals 10.64 ounces.

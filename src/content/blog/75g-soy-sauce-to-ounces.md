<h2>Why Convert 75g of Soy Sauce to Ounces?</h2>  
<p>Many air fryer recipes, especially those from the UK, use metric measurements like grams. However, some kitchen scales or recipes might list ingredients in ounces. Converting 75g of soy sauce to ounces (2.65 oz) helps avoid guesswork and ensures consistency. Whether you're preparing a <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken dish</a> or a tofu marinade, precise measurements matter. A slight overpour of soy sauce can overpower other flavours, so accuracy is key.</p>

<h3>How to Measure 75g of Soy Sauce Without a Scale</h3>  
<p>Don’t have a kitchen scale? No problem. One tablespoon of soy sauce weighs roughly 15g, so 75g would be about 5 tablespoons.

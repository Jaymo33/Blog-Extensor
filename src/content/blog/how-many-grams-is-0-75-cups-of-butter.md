<h2>How to Measure 0.75 Cups of Butter in Grams</h2>
<p>The simplest way to measure 0.75 cups of butter in grams is by using a kitchen scale. Place your bowl or container on the scale, tare it to zero, then add butter until it reaches 170 grams. This method is foolproof and works for both salted and unsalted butter. If you're prepping for an air fryer recipe, precise measurements like these are key to success.</p>

<h3>Using Measuring Cups for Butter</h3>
<p>If you don’t have a scale, you can still measure 0.75 cups of butter using standard measuring cups. One cup of butter equals 227 grams, so 0.75 cups is roughly 170 grams. Pack the butter firmly into the cup to avoid air gaps, ensuring accuracy. For air fryer recipes, like those found on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes</a>, this method works perfectly.</p>

<h2>Butter Conversions for UK and US Measurements</h2>
<p>In the UK, butter is often sold in 250g blocks, while in the US, it’s commonly packaged in 1-cup sticks (227g). This means 0.75 cups of butter in the US is about 170 grams, while UK measurements align closely. Always check your recipe’s origin to ensure accuracy.

Air fryers cook faster and more evenly, so precise measurements prevent overcooking or uneven results. Whether you're baking or frying, 170 grams of butter ensures your dish turns out perfectly every time.</p>

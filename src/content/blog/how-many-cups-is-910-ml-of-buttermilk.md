<p>910 ml of buttermilk is approximately 3.84 cups. This conversion is essential for anyone using recipes that call for buttermilk, especially when preparing dishes in an air fryer. Whether you're baking fluffy pancakes or marinating chicken, knowing the exact measurement ensures your dish turns out perfectly every time.</p>

<h2>Understanding Buttermilk Measurements</h2>
<p>Buttermilk is a staple in many recipes, from cakes to fried chicken, and getting the measurement right is crucial. In the UK and the US, cup measurements can vary slightly, but for most practical purposes, 1 cup equals 240 ml. This means 910 ml of buttermilk converts to roughly 3.84 cups. If you're using an air fryer, precise measurements like this can make all the difference in texture and flavour.</p>
<p>For those who love baking, you might find our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> incredibly useful. It covers common ingredient conversions, including buttermilk, to help you adapt recipes effortlessly. Whether you're making buttermilk biscuits or a tangy marinade, knowing how to measure buttermilk correctly ensures consistent results.</p>

<h3>Why Accurate Measurements Matter</h3>
<p>Using the right amount of buttermilk affects the acidity and moisture content of your dish. Too much can make baked goods soggy, while too little might leave them dry. This is especially important in air fryer cooking, where precise ratios impact how evenly your food cooks. For example, a buttermilk batter for fried chicken needs the perfect balance to achieve that crispy exterior.</p>

<h2>Converting 910 ml of Buttermilk to Cups</h2>
<p>To convert 910 ml of buttermilk to cups, divide the millilitres by 240 (the standard cup size in ml). This gives you 3.84 cups. If your recipe calls for a round number, you can use 3 and 3/4 cups, which is close enough for most purposes. For more precise baking, consider using a kitchen scale to weigh the buttermilk.</p>
<p>If you're working with a recipe that uses metric measurements, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a> includes plenty of options tailored for air fryers. From buttermilk pancakes to tenderising marinades, these recipes take the guesswork out of conversions.</p>

<h3>Tips for Measuring Buttermilk</h3>
<p>Always shake the buttermilk well before measuring, as it can separate. Use a liquid measuring cup for accuracy, and check the measurement at eye level. If you're short on buttermilk, you can make a substitute by adding 1 tablespoon of lemon juice or vinegar to 240 ml of milk and letting it sit for 5 minutes.</p>

<h2>Common Uses for Buttermilk in Air Fryer Recipes</h2>
<p>Buttermilk is a versatile ingredient that adds tenderness and flavour to air fryer dishes. It's perfect for marinating chicken, making fluffy pancakes, or even creating a tangy glaze for vegetables. The acidity in buttermilk helps break down proteins, resulting in juicier meats and lighter baked goods.</p>

<h3>Storing Buttermilk for Later Use</h3>
<p>If you have leftover buttermilk, store it in an airtight container in the fridge for up to two weeks. You can also freeze it in ice cube trays for smaller portions. Thawed buttermilk might separate, but a quick stir will bring it back together.</p>

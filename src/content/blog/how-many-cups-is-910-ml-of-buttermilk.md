<h3>Why Accurate Measurements Matter</h3>
<p>Using the right amount of buttermilk affects the acidity and moisture content of your dish. Too much can make baked goods soggy, while too little might leave them dry.

For example, a buttermilk batter for fried chicken needs the perfect balance to achieve that crispy exterior.</p>

<h2>Converting 910 ml of Buttermilk to Cups</h2>
<p>To convert 910 ml of buttermilk to cups, divide the millilitres by 240 (the standard cup size in ml). This gives you 3.84 cups. If your recipe calls for a round number, you can use 3 and 3/4 cups, which is close enough for most purposes. For more precise baking, consider using a kitchen scale to weigh the buttermilk.</p>

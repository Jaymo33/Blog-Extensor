<p>325 grams of rolled oats is roughly equivalent to 3.5 cups, though this can vary slightly depending on how tightly packed the oats are. If you're using an air fryer for recipes like granola or oat-based snacks, getting this measurement right ensures perfect results every time. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we know precise conversions make all the difference in cooking and baking.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter for Air Fryer Recipes</h2>  
<p>Using the correct amount of rolled oats ensures your air fryer recipes turn out just right. Too many oats can make dishes dry, while too few might leave them soggy. Whether you're making granola, oat bars, or coating chicken, 325 grams of rolled oats should fill about 3.5 standard measuring cups. For more air fryer-friendly recipes, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipes section</a>.</p>  

<p>Different brands of rolled oats may have slight variations in density, so it's always best to measure by weight if possible. If you don't have a kitchen scale, fluff the oats lightly before spooning them into a measuring cup. Avoid packing them down, as this can lead to using more oats than intended. This is especially important for air fryer cooking, where even heat distribution relies on proper ingredient ratios.</p>  

<h3>UK vs. US Cup Measurements</h3>  
<p>In the UK, a standard cup measurement is 250ml, while in the US, it's 240ml. This small difference means 325 grams of rolled oats might fill slightly more than 3.5 cups in the UK. If precision is key, weighing your oats is the best approach.

<h2>Best Air Fryer Recipes Using Rolled Oats</h2>  
<p>Rolled oats are incredibly versatile in the air fryer. From crunchy granola to savoury coatings, they add texture and nutrition to many dishes. If you're working with 325 grams of rolled oats, try making homemade granola clusters or oat-crusted chicken tenders. For inspiration, browse our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/breakfast>breakfast recipe category</a>, packed with oat-based ideas.</p>  

<p>Another great way to use 325 grams of rolled oats is in energy bars or cookies. The air fryer gives them a lovely crispness without drying them out. Just remember to adjust cooking times based on your specific air fryer model. Keeping your appliance clean is also crucial—visit our guide on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaning</a> for best practices.</p>  

<h3>Storing Leftover Rolled Oats</h3>  
<p>If you don't use all 325 grams of rolled oats at once, store them in an airtight container to maintain freshness. They'll keep for months in a cool, dry place. For longer storage, consider freezing them in portioned bags—just bring them to room temperature before using in your next air fryer creation.</p>

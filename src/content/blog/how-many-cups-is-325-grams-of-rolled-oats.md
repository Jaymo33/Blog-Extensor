<p>325 grams of rolled oats is roughly equivalent to 3.5 cups, though this can vary slightly depending on how tightly packed the oats are. If you're using an air fryer for recipes like granola or oat-based snacks, getting this measurement right ensures perfect results every time. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we know precise conversions make all the difference in cooking and baking.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter for Air Fryer Recipes</h2>  
<p>Using the correct amount of rolled oats ensures your air fryer recipes turn out just right. Too many oats can make dishes dry, while too few might leave them soggy.

<p>Different brands of rolled oats may have slight variations in density, so it's always best to measure by weight if possible. If you don't have a kitchen scale, fluff the oats lightly before spooning them into a measuring cup. Avoid packing them down, as this can lead to using more oats than intended. This is especially important for air fryer cooking, where even heat distribution relies on proper ingredient ratios.</p>  

<h3>UK vs. US Cup Measurements</h3>  
<p>In the UK, a standard cup measurement is 250ml, while in the US, it's 240ml. This small difference means 325 grams of rolled oats might fill slightly more than 3.5 cups in the UK. If precision is key, weighing your oats is the best approach.

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>

<h3>How to measure rolled barley for air fryer recipes</h3>  
<p>For the most accurate results, use a kitchen scale to weigh 1.66 cups of rolled barley as 5.3 ounces. If you don’t have a scale, fluff the barley in the bag before lightly spooning it into a measuring cup. Avoid packing it down, as this can lead to over-measuring. This method ensures your air fryer dishes, like barley crisps or grain bowls, turn out just right.</p>

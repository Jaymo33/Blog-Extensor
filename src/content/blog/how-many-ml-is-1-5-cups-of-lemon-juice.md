<p>1.5 cups of lemon juice equals 355 ml. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements can affect the texture and flavour of your dishes. Whether you’re making a zesty marinade or a tangy dessert, knowing the exact ml equivalent ensures consistency. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we focus on helping you achieve perfect results every time. Let’s dive deeper into why this conversion matters and how to use it effectively.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Using the correct amount of lemon juice can make or break a recipe. Too much can overpower other flavours, while too little might leave your dish lacking brightness. The air fryer’s intense heat means liquids evaporate faster, so precision is key. For example, a marinade with 355 ml of lemon juice will coat chicken evenly, ensuring juicy, flavourful results. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more handy measurement tips.</p>  

<p>Many air fryer recipes, like lemon drizzle cakes or citrus-glazed salmon, rely on balanced acidity. If you’re adapting a traditional recipe, converting cups to ml ensures you don’t overdo it. A 1.5 cups to ml conversion is straightforward, but always double-check for accuracy. For more recipe ideas, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipes section</a>, where precision meets creativity.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure Lemon Juice Correctly</h3>  
<p>To measure 1.5 cups of lemon juice (355 ml), use a liquid measuring cup for accuracy. Freshly squeezed juice is best, but bottled works in a pinch—just check for additives. If your recipe calls for millilitres, a kitchen scale with a ml function can also help. For sticky ingredients like honey or syrup, lightly grease the measuring cup first. Proper measuring ensures your air fryer dishes turn out as intended every time.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for 1.5 Cups of Lemon Juice in Air Fryer Recipes</h2>  
<p>Lemon juice is incredibly versatile in air fryer cooking. From marinades to desserts, 355 ml can transform your dishes. Try it in a lemon-herb marinade for chicken or a citrus glaze for salmon—both cook beautifully in the air fryer. You can even use it to brighten up roasted vegetables or add tang to cakes. For inspiration, browse our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipes</a>, where lemon plays a starring role.</p>  

<p>Another great use is in cleaning your air fryer! A mix of 1.5 cups lemon juice (355 ml) and water can help remove grease and odours. After cooking, let the solution sit in the basket before wiping it down. For more cleaning tips, visit our guide on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner</a>. Lemon’s natural acidity makes it a powerhouse in both cooking and maintenance.</p>  

<h3>Converting Other Cup Measurements to ml</h3>  
<p>If you frequently work with cups, knowing a few key conversions is helpful. For example, 1 cup equals 237 ml, while 2 cups equal 473 ml. This knowledge is handy when scaling recipes up or down. Always measure liquids at eye level for accuracy, especially in air fryer cooking where every drop counts. Whether you’re baking or prepping a marinade, precise measurements lead to better results.</p>

    "@type": "Answer",
    "text": "If your dish tastes overly tart, you may have mismeasured the lemon juice. Double-check that 1.33 cups equals 10.64 ounces. Alternatively, balance acidity with a pinch of sugar or honey. Air fryers intensify flavours, so slight adjustments go a long way."

<p>1.33 cups of lemon juice equals approximately 10.64 ounces (UK). Whether you're whipping up a zesty marinade or a tangy glaze for your air fryer dishes, getting the measurements right is crucial for perfect results every time.</p>  

<h2>Understanding Lemon Juice Measurements</h2>  
<p>When working with lemon juice in recipes, especially for air fryer cooking, accuracy matters. A standard UK cup holds 8 fluid ounces, but lemon juice’s density means 1.33 cups translates to roughly 10.64 ounces. This conversion ensures your dressings, sauces, or marinades have the right balance of acidity and flavour.</p>  

<p>If you’re prepping a dish like lemon garlic chicken or a citrus-glazed salmon in your air fryer, precise measurements prevent overpowering tartness. For more air fryer recipe ideas, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipes section</a>, where we share tips for perfecting every meal.</p>  

<h3>Why Accurate Conversions Matter</h3>  
<p>Air fryers cook food quickly, so imbalances in liquid ingredients like lemon juice can affect texture and taste. Too much juice might make proteins soggy, while too little could leave flavours flat. Using 10.64 ounces (from 1.33 cups) ensures consistency.</p>  

<h2>Tools for Measuring Lemon Juice</h2>  
<p>A liquid measuring cup is ideal for lemon juice, but a kitchen scale provides even greater precision. If your recipe calls for 1.33 cups (10.64 ounces), weigh it for foolproof results. For other conversions, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> simplifies the process.</p>  

<p>Lemon juice’s acidity can also impact cooking times in air fryers. Recipes like lemon drizzle cake or citrus-marinated shrimp benefit from exact measurements. Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert category</a> for sweet and tangy inspiration.</p>  

<h3>Adjusting Recipes for Air Fryers</h3>  
<p>Since air fryers circulate hot air, liquids evaporate faster. If substituting bottled lemon juice for fresh, note that concentrations vary. Stick to 10.64 ounces (1.33 cups) unless the recipe specifies otherwise.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for Lemon Juice in Air Fryers</h2>  
<p>From deglazing pans to tenderising meats, lemon juice is a versatile ingredient. In air fryers, it’s great for marinades (like our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>lemon-herb chicken</a>) or adding brightness to roasted veggies. Always measure carefully to avoid over-acidifying dishes.</p>  

<p>For cleaning your air fryer after cooking with lemon juice, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning guide</a> helps maintain its performance. Residual acidity can affect future meals if not properly removed.</p>  

<h3>Storing Lemon Juice for Future Use</h3>  
<p>If you’ve measured 1.33 cups (10.64 ounces) but only need half, freeze the rest in ice cube trays. Thawed cubes retain flavour and simplify future conversions.</p>

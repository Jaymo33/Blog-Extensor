<p>85 ml of corn syrup is approximately 0.36 cups. This conversion is essential for anyone using an air fryer or baking, where precise measurements can make or break a recipe. Whether you're whipping up a dessert or a savoury glaze, knowing how to convert millilitres to cups ensures consistency. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we understand the importance of accurate measurements, especially when working with sticky ingredients like corn syrup.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Corn syrup is a common ingredient in many air fryer recipes, from glazes to desserts. Using the correct amount ensures the right texture and sweetness. Too much or too little can throw off the balance of your dish. For example, if you're making air-fried doughnuts and the glaze is too thin, it won't stick properly. Conversely, if it's too thick, it might overpower the flavour. That's why converting 85 ml of corn syrup to cups correctly is crucial.</p>  

<p>Many UK recipes use millilitres, while others rely on cup measurements. This can be confusing, especially if you're following an international recipe. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> makes it easy to switch between units, so you never have to guess. Whether you're making sticky buns or a savoury glaze for meats, precision is key.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure 85 ml of Corn Syrup</h3>  
<p>Measuring corn syrup can be tricky due to its sticky consistency. For the most accurate results, use a liquid measuring cup with clear markings. Lightly grease the cup with oil to help the syrup slide out easily. Alternatively, weigh it on a kitchen scale—85 ml of corn syrup weighs roughly 115 grams. If you're using a standard US cup, remember that 1 cup equals 240 ml, so 85 ml is just over a third of a cup.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for 85 ml of Corn Syrup</h2>  
<p>Corn syrup is a versatile ingredient in both baking and air frying. It adds sweetness, moisture, and a glossy finish to dishes. For example, 85 ml of corn syrup is perfect for glazing air-fried ham or making a caramel sauce for desserts. It's also a key component in many <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert recipes</a>, like pecan pie or marshmallow treats.</p>  

<p>If you're making a marinade or sauce, 85 ml of corn syrup can help balance acidity and add depth. It's also great for preventing crystallisation in homemade candies or frostings.

<h3>Converting Other Corn Syrup Measurements</h3>  
<p>If your recipe calls for a different amount of corn syrup, here are some quick conversions: 100 ml is about 0.42 cups, 50 ml is roughly 0.21 cups, and 200 ml equals approximately 0.85 cups. Keeping these conversions handy can save time and ensure accuracy.

<p>935 ml of orange juice equals approximately 3.95 cups in the US measurement system and 3.29 cups in the UK system. If you're preparing a recipe for your air fryer, knowing this conversion ensures accuracy, especially when baking cakes or glazing meats. Whether you're following a recipe from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> or adapting a family favourite, precise measurements matter.</p>  

<h2>Understanding Cup Measurements for Orange Juice</h2>  
<p>Cup sizes vary between the US and UK, which can affect your cooking results. In the US, 1 cup equals 240 ml, while in the UK, it's 284 ml. This means 935 ml of orange juice converts to roughly 3.95 US cups or 3.29 UK cups. If you're using an air fryer for recipes like orange-glazed chicken or citrus-infused desserts, this distinction is crucial for consistency.</p>  

<p>For air fryer cooking, liquid measurements impact texture and flavour. Too much orange juice in a marinade could make food soggy, while too little might leave it dry.

<h3>Why Accuracy Matters in Air Fryer Recipes</h3>  
<p>Air fryers circulate hot air rapidly, so ingredient ratios must be precise. If a recipe calls for 935 ml of orange juice, using the correct cup measurement ensures even cooking. This is especially important for dishes like orange cake or glazed salmon, where excess liquid can alter results.</p>  

<h2>Converting 935 ml of Orange Juice for Baking</h2>  
<p>Baking in an air fryer requires exact measurements for the best rise and texture. If a cake recipe lists 935 ml of orange juice, converting it correctly prevents a dense or overly moist outcome. For UK bakers, 3.29 cups (using 284 ml per cup) is the right amount, while US bakers should use 3.95 cups (240 ml per cup).</p>

<h3>Adjusting Recipes for Different Cup Sizes</h3>  
<p>If you're adapting a US recipe to UK measurements (or vice versa), recalculating 935 ml of orange juice ensures consistency. A slight variation might not ruin a dish, but for baking, it's best to stick to the correct conversion. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert category</a> includes tips for perfect air fryer cakes every time.</p>  

<h2>Practical Tips for Measuring Orange Juice</h2>  
<p>To measure 935 ml of orange juice accurately, use a liquid measuring cup with clear ml and cup markings. If you don't have one, a standard UK cup (284 ml) holds slightly more than a US cup (240 ml), so adjust accordingly. For air fryer recipes, precision ensures even cooking and optimal flavour.</p>  

<p>After cooking, keep your air fryer clean with our recommended <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning tips</a>. Sticky orange juice residues can build up, so regular maintenance keeps your appliance in top condition.</p>  

<h3>Using Orange Juice in Savoury Air Fryer Dishes</h3>  
<p>Orange juice adds brightness to marinades and glazes. For example, 935 ml of orange juice can be reduced to a syrup for glazing chicken or tofu in the air fryer. The correct measurement ensures balanced sweetness and acidity.</p>

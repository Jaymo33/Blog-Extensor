<p>635 ml of soy sauce is roughly 2.68 cups in US measurements or 2.23 cups in UK imperial measurements. Whether you're following a recipe from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> or adjusting a marinade for your air fryer, knowing this conversion ensures accuracy. Soy sauce is a staple in many dishes, from stir-fries to glazes, so getting the measurement right matters. This guide will help you convert 635 ml of soy sauce to cups with ease.</p>  

<h2>Understanding the Conversion</h2>  
<p>Converting millilitres to cups depends on whether you're using US or UK measurements. In the US, 1 cup equals 240 ml, while in the UK, 1 cup is 284 ml. For 635 ml of soy sauce, this means approximately 2.68 US cups or 2.23 UK cups. If you're working with an air fryer recipe, precision is key—especially when balancing flavours like soy sauce in marinades or sauces.</p>  

<p>Many recipes on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes</a> call for precise measurements to ensure the best results. Whether you're making teriyaki chicken or a soy-glazed salmon, knowing how 635 ml translates to cups helps avoid over-seasoning. For baking or meal prep, this conversion ensures consistency every time.</p>  

<h3>Why Accuracy Matters in Air Fryer Cooking</h3>  
<p>Air fryers cook food quickly, and imbalances in liquid measurements can affect texture and taste. Too much soy sauce can make a dish overly salty, while too little may leave it bland. Measuring 635 ml of soy sauce correctly ensures your air fryer meals turn out perfectly seasoned. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air-fryer conversion chart</a> for more handy measurement tips.</p>  

<h2>Practical Uses for 635 ml of Soy Sauce</h2>  
<p>635 ml of soy sauce is a common quantity in bulk cooking or meal prep. If you're marinating proteins like chicken or tofu for the air fryer, this amount can cover multiple servings. For example, a soy-honey glaze for air-fried salmon might use 100 ml, leaving plenty for other dishes. Storing leftover soy sauce properly ensures it stays fresh for future recipes.</p>  

<p>Looking for inspiration? Browse <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken</a> for soy-based marinades. From sticky wings to crispy thighs, precise measurements make all the difference. If you're scaling a recipe up or down, converting 635 ml to cups helps maintain the right ratios.</p>  

<h3>Tips for Measuring Soy Sauce</h3>  
<p>Use a liquid measuring cup for accuracy when converting 635 ml of soy sauce to cups. Pour slowly to avoid spills, and check at eye level. For sticky sauces like soy, a silicone spatula can help scrape every last drop. Clean your air fryer basket afterward with <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner</a> to prevent residue buildup.</p>

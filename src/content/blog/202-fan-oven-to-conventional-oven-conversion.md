<p>202°C in a fan oven converts to approximately 220°C in a conventional oven. This 10-20°C increase compensates for the fan oven's efficient heat circulation. Understanding this conversion is crucial when adapting recipes between oven types or using an air fryer, which operates similarly to a fan oven.</p>

<h2>Why Fan Oven Temperatures Differ</h2>
<p>Fan ovens cook faster and more evenly than conventional ovens due to their built-in fan that circulates hot air. This means you'll typically need to reduce temperatures by 10-20°C when converting from conventional to fan settings. The reverse applies when going from fan to conventional - you'll need to increase the temperature slightly. This principle applies whether you're baking cakes at <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>200°C</a> or roasting vegetables at higher heats.</p>

<p>When converting 202 fan oven to conventional oven temperatures specifically, we recommend rounding up to 220°C for simplicity. This slight increase ensures your food cooks through properly without drying out. Many modern recipes now include both fan and conventional oven temperatures, but older cookbooks often require these conversions.</p>

<h3>How This Affects Air Fryer Cooking</h3>
<p>Air fryers essentially function as compact fan ovens, making the 202 fan oven to conventional oven conversion particularly relevant. If a recipe states 202°C for a fan oven, you can typically use the same temperature in your air fryer. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>comprehensive conversion chart</a> shows how these temperatures translate across different cooking appliances.</p>

<h2>Practical Conversion Examples</h2>
<p>Let's examine some common scenarios where you might need to convert 202 fan oven to conventional oven settings. Baking cookies at 202°C in a fan oven would require about 220°C in a conventional oven. Similarly, roasting chicken at this temperature would follow the same conversion principle. The key is maintaining cooking times while adjusting the heat accordingly.</p>

<p>For delicate items like soufflés or custards, you might opt for a more conservative 15°C increase rather than the full 20°C. This prevents over-browning while ensuring proper cooking. Always monitor your food closely the first time you try a converted temperature, especially when using an air fryer where cooking times can be significantly shorter.</p>

<h3>Temperature Conversion Chart</h3>
<p>While we've focused on 202 fan oven to conventional oven conversion, here's a quick reference for other common temperatures: 180°C fan = 200°C conventional, 190°C fan = 210°C conventional, and 200°C fan = 220°C conventional. These conversions work for most <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>everyday recipes</a> from roasted vegetables to baked goods.</p>

<h2>Special Considerations for Air Fryers</h2>
<p>When using 202°C fan oven settings in an air fryer, remember these appliances heat up much faster than traditional ovens. You may need to reduce cooking times by 20-30% even when using the same temperature. The compact space and intense air circulation can lead to quicker browning, so it's wise to check food several minutes before the recommended time.</p>

<p>For foods that typically cook at 202°C in a fan oven, like homemade chips or chicken wings, your air fryer will deliver crispier results in less time. Just be sure not to overcrowd the basket, as this affects air circulation. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning guide</a> helps maintain optimal performance after cooking greasy items at these temperatures.</p>

<h3>Testing Your Conversions</h3>
<p>The best way to verify your 202 fan oven to conventional oven conversions is with simple test recipes. Try baking a small batch of cookies or roasting some vegetables at the converted temperature and adjust as needed. Ovens vary, so you might find yours runs hot or cold compared to the standard conversion.</p>

<p>335 ml of maple syrup equals approximately 1.42 cups (US) or 1.18 cups (UK). This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes, baking, and precise cooking measurements. Whether you're making glazes, marinades, or sweet treats, knowing how to convert ml to cups ensures perfect results every time.</p>

<h2>Understanding Maple Syrup Measurements</h2>  
<p>Maple syrup is a staple in many kitchens, especially for those who love baking or air fryer recipes. Unlike water, maple syrup has a thicker consistency, which can sometimes make measuring tricky. However, the conversion from millilitres to cups remains straightforward once you know the ratios. For US measurements, 335 ml translates to roughly 1.42 cups, while in the UK, it's about 1.18 cups.</p>  

<p>If you're using an air fryer, precise measurements matter. Too much or too little syrup can affect the texture and flavour of your dish. For example, a sticky glaze for <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer chicken wings</a> requires the right balance. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more handy tips.</p>  

<h3>Why Accuracy Matters in Air Fryer Cooking</h3>  
<p>Air fryers cook food quickly and evenly, but they rely on precise ingredient ratios. A slight miscalculation in liquid measurements, like 335 ml of maple syrup, can lead to overly soggy or dry results. This is especially important for recipes like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>air fryer desserts</a>, where syrup acts as a key ingredient.</p>  

<h2>Converting 335 ml of Maple Syrup for Different Recipes</h2>  
<p>Whether you're making pancakes, glazes, or marinades, converting 335 ml of maple syrup to cups is simple. In the US, 1 cup equals 236.59 ml, so 335 ml is roughly 1.42 cups. In the UK, where 1 cup is 284 ml, it's closer to 1.18 cups. Always double-check your recipe's measurement system to avoid mistakes.</p>  

<p>For those who love experimenting with <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/breakfast>air fryer breakfast recipes</a>, this conversion is a game-changer. Imagine drizzling the perfect amount of syrup over air-fried French toast or pancakes. Too little, and it's bland; too much, and it's overwhelming. Precision ensures delicious results every time.</p>  

<h3>Tips for Measuring Sticky Syrups</h3>  
<p>Measuring thick liquids like maple syrup can be messy. To make it easier, lightly coat your measuring cup with oil or cooking spray. This helps the syrup slide out smoothly, ensuring you get an accurate 335 ml measurement. For sticky cleanup, check out our guide on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning your air fryer</a>.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for 335 ml of Maple Syrup</h2>  
<p>From glazes to desserts, 335 ml of maple syrup is a versatile ingredient. It's enough to coat a batch of air-fried salmon or sweeten a tray of roasted vegetables. If you're baking, this quantity works perfectly for cakes or cookies, adding a rich, caramelised flavour.</p>  

<p>For savoury dishes, try using 335 ml of maple syrup in a marinade for <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>air fryer chicken</a>. The sweetness balances spices beautifully, creating a delicious crust. Whether you're cooking for one or meal prepping, knowing this conversion saves time and hassle.</p>  

<h3>Adjusting Recipes for Different Cup Sizes</h3>  
<p>Recipes often don't specify whether they use US or UK cup measurements. If you're unsure, assume US cups (236.59 ml) unless stated otherwise. For 335 ml of maple syrup, this small difference can impact your dish. When in doubt, refer to a reliable conversion tool or chart.</p>

<p>500g of granulated sugar equals approximately 17.64 ounces. This conversion is essential for anyone baking or cooking with precise measurements, especially when using an air fryer where accuracy can impact texture and cooking times. Whether you're whipping up a cake or caramelising sugar for a dessert, knowing how to convert grams to ounces ensures consistency in your recipes.</p>

<h2>Why convert 500g of granulated sugar to ounces?</h2>
<p>Many UK recipes, especially those from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, provide measurements in grams, but some kitchen scales or older recipes might use ounces. Converting 500g of granulated sugar to ounces (17.64 oz) helps bridge this gap. This is particularly useful for air fryer recipes, where precise measurements can affect how evenly your food cooks. For example, a slight variation in sugar quantity can alter the browning of cookies or the rise of a cake.</p>
<p>Granulated sugar is a staple in baking, and 500g is a common quantity used in larger recipes. Whether you're making a batch of cupcakes or a syrup for glazing, knowing the ounce equivalent ensures you're following the recipe correctly. If you're working with an air fryer, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for other handy measurement swaps.</p>

<h2>How to measure 500g of granulated sugar accurately</h2>
<p>Using a digital kitchen scale is the most accurate way to measure 500g of granulated sugar. If your scale displays ounces, you'll see it registers around 17.64 oz for this amount. For those without scales, 500g of granulated sugar roughly fills 2½ standard UK measuring cups, but this method is less precise. When baking in an air fryer, even small measurement discrepancies can affect cooking times and results.</p>
<p>For best results, always spoon granulated sugar into your measuring cup rather than scooping directly from the bag. This prevents compacting, which could lead to using more sugar than intended. If you're adapting a traditional oven recipe for your air fryer, precise sugar measurements become even more critical due to the air fryer's concentrated heat and faster cooking times.</p>

<h3>Does granulated sugar weight vary by brand?</h3>
<p>While 500g of granulated sugar should always equal 17.64 ounces regardless of brand, some sugars may be slightly more or less dense due to crystal size variations. However, these differences are minimal and unlikely to significantly impact most recipes. When using your air fryer, stick to the 500g to 17.64 oz conversion for consistent results.</p>

<h2>Common recipes using 500g of granulated sugar</h2>
<p>Many <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>cake recipes</a> call for 500g of granulated sugar, especially larger or layered cakes. This quantity is also common in preserves, syrups, and bulk baking. When adapting these recipes for your air fryer, remember that the 500g (17.64 oz) sugar measurement affects not just sweetness but also texture and browning.</p>
<p>For example, a classic Victoria sponge might use 500g of sugar divided between two large cakes. In an air fryer, you'd typically make smaller batches, so you'd need to proportionally reduce the sugar while maintaining the same 500g to 17.64 oz ratio. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> features many recipes where precise sugar measurements are key to success.</p>

<h3>Can I use this conversion for other types of sugar?</h3>
<p>While 500g of granulated sugar equals 17.64 ounces, this conversion differs slightly for other sugar types due to varying densities. For instance, 500g of icing sugar would measure more ounces by volume but weighs the same. Always check specific conversions when working with brown sugar, caster sugar, or other varieties in your air fryer recipes.</p>

<h2>Tips for working with 500g of granulated sugar in air fryers</h2>
<p>When using 500g of granulated sugar (17.64 oz) in air fryer recipes, remember that sugar behaves differently under the intense, circulating heat. It caramelises faster, so you might need to reduce cooking times or temperatures slightly. This is particularly important for recipes like crumbles or glazes where sugar plays a structural role beyond just sweetness.</p>
<p>Always store your measured 500g portions in airtight containers to prevent moisture absorption, which can affect both weight and performance in recipes. For cleaning sticky sugar residues from your air fryer after use, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning guide</a> has helpful tips to maintain your appliance.</p>

<h2>Why accurate fish sauce measurements matter</h2>  
<p>Fish sauce is a potent ingredient, and even a small variation can overpower your dish. In air fryer cooking, where flavours intensify due to rapid air circulation, precision is key.

<h3>Common mistakes when measuring fish sauce</h3>  
<p>Many home cooks eyeball liquid measurements, but this often leads to inconsistent results. When converting 2.5 tbsp of fish sauce to grams, use proper measuring spoons and level them off. Don’t pack the fish sauce into the spoon, as this can add extra grams and overpower your dish. For sticky sauces, lightly grease the spoon first for easier pouring.</p>  

<h2>Fish sauce alternatives and conversions</h2>  
<p>If you’re out of fish sauce, you can substitute Worcestershire sauce or soy sauce using the same 2.5 tbsp to grams conversion. Keep in mind these alternatives have different salt levels, so adjust other seasonings accordingly. The air fryer’s concentrated heat means flavours become more pronounced, so err on the side of caution when substituting. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable recipes</a> show how to balance these strong flavours.</p>  

<p>When storing fish sauce, keep it in a cool, dark place to maintain its quality. Proper storage ensures your 2.5 tbsp to grams conversions remain accurate over time. Fish sauce doesn’t need refrigeration, but chilling it can reduce its pungent aroma if that bothers you. Always give the bottle a gentle shake before measuring, as some separation is normal.</p>

<p>40g of granulated sugar equals approximately 1.41 ounces. This conversion is essential for anyone using UK recipes or working with air fryer measurements, where precision can make or break a dish. Whether you're baking a cake or whipping up a dessert in your air fryer, knowing how to convert grams to ounces ensures your recipes turn out perfectly every time.</p>

<h2>Why accurate sugar measurements matter</h2>
<p>Granulated sugar is a staple in both baking and air fryer cooking, and getting the measurements right is crucial. Too much sugar can make desserts overly sweet or affect texture, while too little can leave them bland. For air fryer recipes, precise measurements ensure even cooking and perfect results. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we emphasise the importance of accuracy, especially when converting between metric and imperial units.</p>
<p>Many UK recipes use grams, while some older or international recipes might list ingredients in ounces. If you're using an air fryer, you might find our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> handy for other common ingredient conversions. Whether you're making cookies, cakes, or even savoury dishes with a touch of sweetness, knowing that 40g of granulated sugar is 1.41 ounces will help you stay on track.</p>

<h2>How to measure 40g of granulated sugar</h2>
<p>If you don't have a digital scale, you can still measure 40g of granulated sugar accurately. One level tablespoon of granulated sugar is about 12.5g, so 40g would be roughly 3 tablespoons plus 1 teaspoon. However, for the most precise results, especially in baking or air fryer recipes, we recommend using a kitchen scale. This ensures your <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipes</a> turn out as intended.</p>

<h3>Using a digital scale</h3>
<p>Place your bowl or container on the scale, tare it to zero, then add granulated sugar until it reads 40g. This method eliminates guesswork and is particularly useful for air fryer cooking, where small deviations can affect cooking times and results. If you're new to using scales, check out our guide on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>keeping your air fryer clean</a> after working with sticky ingredients like sugar.</p>

<h2>Common uses for 40g of granulated sugar</h2>
<p>40g of granulated sugar is a common measurement in many recipes, from cakes to glazes. In air fryer cooking, it might be used for caramelising fruits, making quick desserts, or balancing flavours in savoury dishes. For example, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert category</a> features several recipes where 40g of sugar is the perfect amount to sweeten treats like air-fried doughnuts or fruit crumbles.</p>
<p>If you're adapting a traditional oven recipe for the air fryer, remember that cooking times and temperatures may vary. The sugar content can affect browning and caramelisation, so sticking to the recommended 40g (1.41 ounces) ensures consistent results.

<h3>Storing granulated sugar</h3>

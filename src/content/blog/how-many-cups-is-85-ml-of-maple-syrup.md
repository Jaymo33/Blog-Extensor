<p>85 ml of maple syrup is roughly 0.36 cups (just over 1/3 cup). If you're using an air fryer for baking or glazing, this conversion ensures your recipes turn out perfectly every time. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we know precise measurements make all the difference in air fryer cooking.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Maple Syrup Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Getting the right amount of maple syrup is crucial for balancing sweetness and texture in air fryer recipes. Too much can make dishes overly sticky, while too little might leave them dry. Whether you're making glazed salmon or maple-infused desserts, 85 ml of maple syrup (0.36 cups) is a common measurement in many recipes. For more conversion help, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>  

<p>Maple syrup is denser than water, so volume conversions aren't always straightforward. Unlike liquids like milk, 85 ml of maple syrup won't fill the same space as 85 ml of water. That's why using proper measuring tools—like a liquid measuring cup or kitchen scale—ensures accuracy. If you're baking cakes or cookies in your air fryer, precise measurements prevent soggy or uneven results.</p>  

<h3>Tools for Measuring 85 ml of Maple Syrup</h3>  
<p>For the most accurate conversion of 85 ml of maple syrup to cups, use a liquid measuring cup with metric and imperial markings. A standard UK metric measuring cup holds 250 ml, so 85 ml is just over a third of that. Alternatively, a kitchen scale set to grams can help—85 ml of maple syrup weighs approximately 113 grams. Explore more <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> that use maple syrup for inspiration.</p>  

<h2>Common Recipes Using 85 ml of Maple Syrup</h2>  
<p>Many air fryer recipes call for 85 ml (0.36 cups) of maple syrup, especially in glazes, marinades, and desserts. For example, maple-glazed chicken or roasted vegetables often use this amount for a perfect balance of sweetness. If you're meal prepping, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/meal-prep>meal prep recipes</a> featuring maple syrup.</p>  

<p>Baking in the air fryer? Cakes and cookies with 85 ml of maple syrup stay moist without becoming overly dense. Since air fryers circulate heat differently than ovens, precise measurements prevent burning or undercooking. For cleaning sticky maple syrup residue, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner guide</a> has handy tips.</p>  

<h3>Adjusting Recipes for Different Syrup Types</h3>  
<p>If substituting golden syrup or honey for maple syrup, note that 85 ml of these alternatives may slightly alter texture and sweetness. Honey is thicker, while golden syrup is lighter, so adjustments might be needed. Always taste-test batters or marinades before cooking in your air fryer.</p>  

<h2>Converting 85 ml of Maple Syrup for US and UK Cooks</h2>  
<p>In the UK, 85 ml of maple syrup is roughly 0.36 cups, while US cups are slightly different (0.38 cups). For air fryer recipes, this small variance usually doesn't affect results. However, if precision is key—like in baking—stick to one measurement system. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a> covers both standards.</p>  

<p>Most air fryer recipe books and sites, including <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, provide measurements in both ml and cups. If a recipe lists 85 ml of maple syrup and you prefer cups, now you know it's about 1/3 cup.

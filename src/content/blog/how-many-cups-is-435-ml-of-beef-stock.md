<p>435 ml of beef stock equals approximately 1.84 cups in the UK or 1.8 cups in the US.

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of beef stock can make or break a recipe. Too little, and your dish might lack depth; too much, and it could become soggy.

<h3>UK vs. US Cup Measurements</h3>  
<p>In the UK, 1 cup equals 250 ml, making 435 ml of beef stock roughly 1.84 cups. In the US, where 1 cup is 240 ml, the same amount comes to about 1.8 cups. This small difference might not seem significant, but for baking or reducing sauces, precision matters. Always check whether your recipe uses UK or US measurements to avoid mishaps.</p>  

<h2>How to Measure 435 ml of Beef Stock Without a Measuring Cup</h2>  
<p>If you don’t have a measuring cup, you can still measure 435 ml of beef stock accurately. A standard UK mug holds about 300 ml, so filling it just under one and a half times will give you close to 435 ml. Alternatively, use a kitchen scale—1 ml of beef stock weighs roughly 1 gram, so 435 grams equals 435 ml.

<p>Another handy trick is using tablespoons—15 ml per tablespoon means 435 ml is about 29 tablespoons. While this method is less precise, it works in a pinch. Just remember that air fryer recipes often benefit from exact measurements, so investing in a good measuring jug is worthwhile.</p>

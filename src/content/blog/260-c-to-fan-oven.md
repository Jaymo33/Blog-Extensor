<p>260°C in a conventional oven converts to approximately 220°C in a fan oven. This 20% reduction accounts for the fan's efficient heat distribution, ensuring even cooking without overheating. When using an air fryer, which operates similarly to a fan oven, you'll often find recipes calling for this adjusted temperature.</p>

<h2>Why Convert 260 C to Fan Oven?</h2>
<p>Fan ovens circulate hot air constantly, cooking food faster and more evenly than conventional ovens. The general rule is to reduce the temperature by 20°C when converting from conventional to fan settings. This means 260°C becomes 220°C in a fan oven - a crucial adjustment to prevent burning or uneven results.</p>
<p>For air fryer users, this conversion is particularly important as most air fryers function like compact fan ovens. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we recommend checking our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for precise temperature adjustments when adapting traditional recipes.</p>

<h2>260 C Fan Oven Equivalent in Air Fryers</h2>
<p>Modern air fryers typically have temperature ranges that include 220°C, making them perfect for recipes requiring 260°C in conventional ovens. The circulating hot air mimics a fan oven's environment, cooking food quickly while maintaining moisture. This makes air fryers ideal for crispy results without excessive drying.</p>
<p>When baking at high temperatures like 260°C (220°C fan), consider reducing cooking times by 5-10 minutes. The powerful convection in both fan ovens and air fryers accelerates cooking. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a> includes specific timing adjustments for various dishes at these temperatures.</p>

<h3>Common Uses for 260 C (220 C Fan)</h3>
<p>This high temperature range is perfect for achieving professional-quality crusts on bread, pizzas, and pastries. In an air fryer, it creates wonderfully crispy textures on roasted vegetables or chicken wings. The intense heat quickly seals in juices while creating that desirable golden-brown finish.</p>

<h2>Temperature Accuracy in Fan Ovens and Air Fryers</h2>
<p>Not all appliances maintain exact temperatures, especially at higher settings like 260°C (220°C fan). Oven thermometers can verify your appliance's accuracy. For air fryers, which have smaller cavities, temperature distribution is generally more consistent than in full-size ovens.</p>
<p>If you're adapting a 260°C conventional recipe for an air fryer, start checking for doneness a few minutes early. The compact space and powerful fan can sometimes cook food faster than expected. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipes</a> section includes specific tips for high-temperature air frying.</p>

<h3>Safety Considerations at High Temperatures</h3>
<p>When working with 260°C (220°C fan) temperatures, always use appropriate cookware. Metal and ceramic withstand these heats better than plastic. For air fryers, ensure baskets and trays are properly seated to prevent hot air leaks. Regular <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning</a> prevents smoke from built-up grease at high temps.</p>

<h2>Converting Other Temperatures to Fan Oven</h2>
<p>The 20°C reduction rule applies across most temperature ranges. For example, 200°C conventional becomes 180°C fan, while 180°C conventional converts to 160°C fan. This consistent conversion makes adapting recipes straightforward once you understand the principle.</p>
<p>Air fryer temperatures typically follow fan oven conventions, though some models may require additional adjustments. When trying new recipes at <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we provide specific temperature guidance for optimal results in different appliance types.</p>

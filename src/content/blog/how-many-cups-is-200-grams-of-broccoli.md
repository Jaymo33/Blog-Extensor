<p>200 grams of broccoli is roughly equivalent to 2.5 cups when chopped, though this can vary slightly depending on how finely it's cut. If you're using an air fryer, getting the right measurement ensures even cooking and perfect texture. Whether you're following a recipe from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> or improvising, knowing this conversion helps avoid over or underfilling your air fryer basket.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter for Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Using the correct amount of broccoli ensures even cooking and prevents overcrowding in your air fryer. Overcrowding can lead to unevenly cooked veggies, while too little might dry them out. If you're working with 200 grams of broccoli, knowing it's about 2.5 cups helps you portion it correctly. This is especially useful for recipes like roasted broccoli or air-fried stir-fries from our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipes section</a>.</p>  

<p>Broccoli’s density can vary based on whether it's chopped, florets, or stems. For precise results, lightly pack the broccoli into your measuring cup without pressing down.

<h3>UK vs. US Cup Measurements</h3>  
<p>While the difference is minor, UK and US cup sizes aren’t identical. A UK cup holds 250ml, whereas a US cup is 240ml. For 200 grams of broccoli, this means roughly 2.5 UK cups or 2.6 US cups. Most air fryer recipes on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> use UK measurements, but always double-check if following an international recipe.</p>  

<h2>Tips for Measuring Broccoli for Air Frying</h2>  
<p>For best results, chop broccoli into even-sized florets to ensure uniform cooking. If your air fryer basket is small, work in batches to avoid overcrowding. You can also toss the broccoli in a bit of oil and seasoning before air frying for extra crispiness.

<p>If you're prepping ahead, 200 grams of broccoli (about 2.5 cups) is perfect for a single serving or side dish. For larger batches, scale up accordingly.

<h3>Common Mistakes When Measuring Broccoli</h3>  
<p>Packing broccoli too tightly into a cup can lead to inaccurate measurements. Instead, lightly fill the cup and level it off. Also, avoid using whole stalks without chopping, as they take longer to cook. For 200 grams of broccoli, aim for bite-sized pieces to ensure even air frying.</p>

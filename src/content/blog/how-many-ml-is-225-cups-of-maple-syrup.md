<p>2.25 cups of maple syrup equals approximately 532.32 millilitres (ml). This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements can make or break your dish. Whether you’re drizzling it over air-fried pancakes or using it as a glaze for salmon, knowing the exact ml equivalent ensures consistency and flavour balance.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>
<p>Air fryers rely on even heat distribution, and using the right amount of ingredients like maple syrup ensures your food cooks perfectly. Too much syrup can lead to excessive caramelisation or burning, while too little might leave your dish lacking in flavour.

<p>Maple syrup is a versatile ingredient in air fryer recipes, from sweet treats like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>cakes</a> to savoury dishes like glazed vegetables. Its viscosity means it’s crucial to measure it correctly—especially when scaling recipes up or down. A slight miscalculation could throw off the entire dish.</p>

<h3>How to Measure Maple Syrup for Air Fryer Recipes</h3>
<p>For the most accurate results, use a liquid measuring cup or a kitchen scale. If you’re converting 2.25 cups of maple syrup to ml, remember that 1 cup equals roughly 236.59 ml. Multiply this by 2.25, and you’ll get 532.32 ml. This precision is particularly helpful for recipes like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer desserts</a>, where consistency is key.</p>

<h2>Common Uses for Maple Syrup in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>

For inspiration, browse our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable recipes</a> that incorporate maple syrup.</p>
<p>Another popular use is in marinades. A mix of maple syrup, soy sauce, and garlic makes a delicious glaze for tofu or salmon. Just remember to measure the syrup accurately to avoid overpowering the dish. Too much sweetness can clash with other flavours.</p>

<h3>Tips for Working with Maple Syrup in the Air Fryer</h3>

For easy cleanup, try our recommended <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner</a>. Also, consider diluting the syrup with a bit of water or oil if you’re using it as a glaze to prevent burning at high temperatures.</p>

<h2>Converting Other Maple Syrup Measurements</h2>

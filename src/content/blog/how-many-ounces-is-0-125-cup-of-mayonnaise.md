<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>
<p>Air fryers rely on even cooking, and incorrect measurements can lead to uneven results. Too much mayonnaise might make your dish greasy, while too little could leave it dry.

If you’re experimenting with new dishes, precise measurements are your best friend. Visit our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipes section</a> for inspiration.</p>

<h3>How to measure 0.125 cup of mayonnaise</h3>
<p>Measuring small quantities like 0.125 cup can be tricky without the right tools. Use a liquid measuring cup with clear markings or a kitchen scale for accuracy.

<h2>Common uses for 0.125 cup of mayonnaise in air fryer recipes</h2>
<p>Mayonnaise is a versatile ingredient in air fryer cooking. A 0.125 cup (1 oz) portion is perfect for coating chicken wings, creating a crispy crust on fish, or mixing into dips. Its high fat content helps achieve that golden-brown finish air fryers are known for.

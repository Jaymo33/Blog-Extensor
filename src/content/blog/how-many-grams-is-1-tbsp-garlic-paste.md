<p>1 tablespoon (tbsp) of garlic paste weighs approximately 15 grams. This measurement is essential for air fryer recipes where precise ingredient quantities can make or break a dish. Whether you're marinating chicken or seasoning vegetables, knowing the exact weight ensures consistent results every time.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate garlic paste measurements matter</h2>  
<p>Garlic paste is a staple in many air fryer recipes, from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>garlic chicken</a> to roasted vegetables. Using too much or too little can drastically alter the flavour. A precise 15-gram measurement per tablespoon helps maintain balance, especially in dishes where garlic is the star ingredient.</p>  
<p>For those who love experimenting with <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a>, accurate conversions prevent overpowering or underwhelming results. Whether you're following a recipe or creating your own, this conversion ensures your dish turns out just right.</p>  

<h2>How to measure garlic paste correctly</h2>  
<p>Measuring garlic paste can be tricky due to its thick consistency. For the most accurate results, use a digital kitchen scale. Scoop the paste into a tablespoon, level it off, and weigh it. If you don't have a scale, a standard UK tablespoon holds roughly 15 grams of garlic paste.</p>  
<p>For those who prefer visual cues, 1 tbsp of garlic paste is about the size of a walnut. This estimation works in a pinch, but for best results, stick to weighing. Consistency is key, especially when preparing marinades or sauces for your air fryer.</p>  

<h3>Common mistakes when measuring garlic paste</h3>  
<p>One frequent error is using a heaped tablespoon, which can add up to 20 grams or more. Another is confusing UK and US tablespoons—UK tablespoons are slightly larger (15ml vs. 14.8ml). Always double-check your measurements to avoid these pitfalls.</p>  

<h2>Garlic paste conversions for air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Many air fryer recipes call for garlic paste in tablespoons, but gram measurements are often more precise. If a recipe requires 30 grams of garlic paste, you'll know that's exactly 2 tablespoons. This precision is particularly useful for <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion-heavy recipes</a>.</p>  
<p>Garlic paste is also a key ingredient in <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable dishes</a>, where even distribution is crucial. Knowing the gram equivalent helps you adjust quantities without guesswork, ensuring every bite is flavourful.</p>  

<h3>Storing garlic paste for freshness</h3>  
<p>To keep garlic paste fresh, store it in an airtight container in the fridge. Proper storage ensures consistent weight and flavour, so your measurements remain accurate over time. Always check for spoilage before use, as spoiled paste can throw off both taste and weight.</p>  

<h2>Using garlic paste in air fryer recipes</h2>  
<p>Garlic paste is versatile—it works in marinades, rubs, and even as a base for sauces. For example, mix 1 tbsp (15g) with olive oil and herbs for a quick <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/potatoes>garlic potato seasoning</a>. The precise measurement ensures the garlic flavour isn't overwhelming.</p>

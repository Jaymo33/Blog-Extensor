<p>1.25 cups of tahini equals approximately 10 ounces. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements can make or break your dish. Whether you're making hummus, dressings, or marinades, knowing the exact weight ensures consistency. Tahini’s thick, paste-like texture means volume measurements can vary, so weighing it is often more accurate. For more air fryer conversions, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>  

<h2>Why measuring tahini accurately matters</h2>  
<p>Tahini is a staple in Middle Eastern cuisine and a versatile ingredient in air fryer cooking. Its rich, nutty flavour enhances dips, sauces, and even baked goods. However, its dense consistency means 1.25 cups can weigh differently depending on how it’s packed. Using ounces instead of cups eliminates guesswork, especially for recipes requiring precision. If you’re experimenting with tahini in your air fryer, accurate measurements ensure perfect results every time. Visit <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>our recipe hub</a> for tahini-inspired dishes.</p>  

<h3>How to measure tahini correctly</h3>  
<p>For the most accurate conversion, use a kitchen scale to weigh tahini directly in ounces. If you don’t have one, spoon the tahini into a measuring cup and level it off without packing it down. Remember, 1.25 cups of tahini is roughly 10 ounces, but slight variations can occur. This method works well for both UK and US measurements, so you can confidently follow any recipe. For more tips, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable-based recipes</a> featuring tahini.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for tahini in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Tahini isn’t just for hummus—it’s a fantastic addition to air fryer dishes. Try mixing it into marinades for chicken or drizzling it over roasted vegetables. Its creamy texture also works well in dressings for air-fried salads or grain bowls. Since 1.25 cups equals about 10 ounces, you can easily scale recipes up or down. For inspiration, browse our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipes</a> that incorporate tahini for extra flavour.</p>  

<h3>Storing tahini for freshness</h3>  
<p>To keep tahini fresh, store it in an airtight container in the fridge after opening. Stir well before measuring, as oil separation is common. If your recipe calls for 1.25 cups (10 ounces), ensure the tahini is well-mixed for consistent results. Proper storage extends its shelf life, so you can enjoy its nutty goodness in countless air fryer meals.

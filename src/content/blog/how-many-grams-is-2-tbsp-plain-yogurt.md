<p>2 tablespoons (tbsp) of plain yogurt weigh approximately 30 grams. This measurement is handy for air fryer recipes where precision matters, ensuring your dishes turn out perfectly every time. Whether you're making marinades, dips, or baked goods, knowing this conversion helps streamline your cooking process.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on precise ingredient ratios to achieve the best texture and flavour. Too much or too little yogurt can affect moisture levels, cooking times, and even browning. For example, adding the right amount of yogurt to a marinade ensures your chicken stays juicy while crisping up nicely.

<p>Many air fryer recipes, like our popular <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken dishes</a>, call for yogurt as a tenderiser. Measuring by weight (grams) rather than volume (tablespoons) eliminates guesswork, especially since yogurt thickness can vary. A kitchen scale is your best friend here, but if you don’t have one, our conversion guide ensures accuracy.</p>  

<h3>How to measure 2 tbsp of plain yogurt without scales</h3>  
<p>If you don’t own a kitchen scale, use standard measuring spoons for 2 tbsp of plain yogurt. Fill the spoon evenly without packing it down, and level off the excess with a knife. Remember, thicker Greek yogurt may weigh slightly more—around 35 grams per 2 tbsp—so adjust accordingly.

<p>0.125 cup of chicken broth equals 1 fluid ounce (oz). This measurement is essential for precise cooking, especially when using an air fryer where ingredient ratios can affect the outcome. Whether you're making soups, sauces, or marinades, knowing this conversion ensures your dishes turn out perfectly every time.</p>

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>
<p>Air fryers rely on precise ingredient ratios to achieve the best results. Too much or too little liquid, like chicken broth, can affect texture and cooking times. For example, adding 0.125 cup (1 oz) of chicken broth to a marinade ensures your meat stays moist without becoming soggy. This is particularly important for recipes like air fryer chicken thighs or vegetables.</p>
<p>At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we emphasise the importance of accurate measurements. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> helps you convert between cups, ounces, and grams effortlessly. This ensures your air fryer dishes are consistently delicious, whether you're cooking for one or meal prepping for the week.</p>

<h2>How to measure 0.125 cup of chicken broth</h2>
<p>Measuring small amounts like 0.125 cup (1 oz) of chicken broth can be tricky without the right tools. A liquid measuring cup with clear markings is ideal, but if you don't have one, you can use tablespoons. Since 0.125 cup equals 2 tablespoons, this method works in a pinch. Just be sure to level off the broth for accuracy.</p>
<p>For those who prefer weight measurements, 1 oz of chicken broth is approximately 28 grams. This is handy if you're using a kitchen scale, which many air fryer enthusiasts find helpful for precision. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipes section</a> for dishes that use chicken broth, like air fryer risotto or gravy.</p>

<h3>Common uses for 0.125 cup of chicken broth</h3>
<p>0.125 cup (1 oz) of chicken broth is often used in small-batch recipes or as a flavour enhancer. It's perfect for deglazing an air fryer pan, adding moisture to roasted vegetables, or creating a light sauce. This amount is also ideal for marinades, ensuring your proteins absorb just enough flavour without becoming waterlogged.</p>

<h2>Converting other chicken broth measurements</h2>
<p>If you need to scale up or down, here are some common conversions: 0.25 cup equals 2 oz, 0.5 cup equals 4 oz, and 1 cup equals 8 oz. These conversions are useful when adjusting recipes for your air fryer. For example, if a recipe calls for 0.25 cup (2 oz) of chicken broth and you only need half, you now know to use 0.125 cup (1 oz).</p>
<p>Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipe category</a> features many dishes that use chicken broth, from soups to stir-fries. Accurate measurements ensure these recipes turn out perfectly in your air fryer every time.</p>

<h3>Tips for storing chicken broth</h3>
<p>If you're using chicken broth frequently, consider storing it in pre-measured portions. Freezing 0.125 cup (1 oz) portions in ice cube trays makes it easy to grab just what you need. This is especially handy for air fryer cooking, where small amounts are often required. Just thaw the cubes as needed for your recipes.</p>

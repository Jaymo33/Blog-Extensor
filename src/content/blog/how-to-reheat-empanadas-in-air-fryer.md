<p>To reheat empanadas in an air fryer, set the temperature to 160°C (320°F) and cook for 3–5 minutes until crispy and heated through. This method ensures the pastry stays flaky while the filling warms evenly, making it the best way to enjoy leftover empanadas. Whether you’re reheating from the fridge or freezer, the air fryer delivers superior results compared to a microwave or oven.</p>

<h2>Why Use an Air Fryer to Reheat Empanadas?</h2>
<p>Air fryers excel at reheating empanadas because they circulate hot air evenly, crisping the pastry without drying out the filling. Unlike microwaves, which can make the pastry soggy, or ovens, which take longer, air fryers offer speed and precision. The compact size of an air fryer also means less energy is wasted, making it an efficient choice for small batches.

<p>Another advantage is the ability to control the temperature precisely. Empanadas need gentle reheating to avoid burning the edges while ensuring the centre is piping hot. The air fryer’s rapid heating mechanism is perfect for this balance. Plus, you won’t need to preheat the appliance, saving you time.

<h2>Step-by-Step Guide to Reheating Empanadas</h2>
<h3>Reheating from the Fridge</h3>
<p>If your empanadas are refrigerated, place them in the air fryer basket in a single layer, leaving space between each for air circulation. Set the temperature to 160°C (320°F) and cook for 3–4 minutes. Check halfway through to ensure even heating. For extra crispiness, lightly spray the empanadas with oil before reheating.</p>

<h3>Reheating from the Freezer</h3>
<p>Frozen empanadas require a slightly longer cooking time. Preheat your air fryer to 160°C (320°F) for 2 minutes, then add the empanadas. Cook for 5–7 minutes, flipping halfway through. This ensures the filling thaws and heats evenly without overcooking the pastry. For more tips on reheating frozen foods, visit <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>.</p>

<h2>Best Practices for Crispy Results</h2>
<p>To achieve the perfect crispiness, avoid overcrowding the air fryer basket. Overlapping empanadas will steam instead of crisp, leading to soggy results. If reheating a large batch, work in smaller portions. For added texture, lightly brush the empanadas with oil or egg wash before reheating. This trick works especially well for homemade empanadas.</p>
<p>Another tip is to reheat empanadas at a lower temperature if they’re particularly thick or stuffed with moist fillings. Reducing the temperature to 150°C (300°F) and extending the time by a minute or two can prevent the pastry from burning while ensuring the centre is hot.

<h2>Common Mistakes to Avoid</h2>
<p>One of the biggest mistakes is reheating empanadas straight from the freezer without adjusting the time. Frozen empanadas need extra minutes to heat through properly. Similarly, skipping the preheat step for frozen empanadas can lead to uneven results. Always preheat your air fryer when dealing with frozen foods.</p>
<p>Another pitfall is using too high a temperature, which can cause the pastry to burn before the filling warms up. Stick to 160°C (320°F) for optimal results. If your air fryer tends to run hot, consider lowering the temperature slightly.

<p>4 tablespoons (tbsp) of soy milk is approximately 60 grams (g). This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements can make or break your dish. Whether you’re whipping up a cake, marinating tofu, or creating a creamy sauce, knowing the exact weight ensures consistency.</p>  

<h2>Why measuring soy milk accurately matters</h2>  
<p>Air fryer cooking relies on precise ingredient ratios to achieve the perfect texture and flavour. Too much or too little soy milk can affect the moisture balance in batters, sauces, or marinades. For example, a <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>soy milk-based batter</a> for crispy tofu needs the right consistency to coat evenly. Measuring by weight (grams) is more reliable than volume (tablespoons) because it accounts for density variations.</p>  

<p>Different brands of soy milk may have slight density differences, but 4 tbsp generally converts to 60g. If you’re using a thicker or lighter variety, a kitchen scale is your best friend.

<h2>How to measure soy milk for air fryer recipes</h2>  
<p>For the most accurate results, use a digital kitchen scale. Place your measuring cup on the scale, tare it to zero, then pour the soy milk until it reaches 60g. If you don’t have a scale, fill a tablespoon measure to the brim without packing it down. Level off the excess with a straight edge for consistency.</p>  

<h3>Common recipes using 4 tbsp soy milk</h3>  
<p>Many air fryer recipes call for 4 tbsp of soy milk, such as vegan pancakes, creamy dressings, or <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert sauces</a>. In baking, this amount helps bind ingredients without making the mixture too wet. For savoury dishes, it adds creaminess to marinades or dips.</p>  

<h2>Converting other soy milk measurements</h2>  
<p>If your recipe requires a different amount, here’s a quick reference: 1 tbsp soy milk = 15g, 2 tbsp = 30g, and 8 tbsp = 120g. These conversions work for most standard soy milk varieties. For thicker or sweetened versions, adjust slightly based on consistency.</p>

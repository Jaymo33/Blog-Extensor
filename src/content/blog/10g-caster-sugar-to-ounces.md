<p>10g of caster sugar equals approximately 0.35 ounces. This precise conversion is essential for UK bakers who need accurate measurements for air fryer recipes. Whether you're whipping up cakes, cookies, or desserts in your air fryer, getting the sugar quantity right makes all the difference to your baking results.</p>

<h2>Understanding caster sugar measurements</h2>
<p>Caster sugar, known for its fine granules, is a staple in British baking. When converting 10g of caster sugar to ounces, it's helpful to understand both metric and imperial systems. The conversion from grams to ounces isn't straightforward, as 1 ounce equals about 28.35 grams. This means 10g of caster sugar converts to roughly 0.35 ounces, a measurement you'll often see in <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a>.</p>
<p>For those using air fryers, precision matters more than you might think. Unlike conventional ovens where measurements can be forgiving, air fryers work best with exact quantities. Whether you're making <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>air fryer cakes</a> or cookies, 10g of caster sugar (0.35 oz) could be the difference between perfect texture and disappointing results. Keep a digital scale handy for these small but crucial measurements.</p>

<h2>Why accurate sugar conversion matters</h2>
<p>In air fryer baking, every gram counts. The confined space and rapid air circulation mean ingredients behave differently than in traditional ovens. When a recipe calls for 10g of caster sugar (0.35 oz), using even slightly more can affect browning and texture. This is particularly important for delicate bakes like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cookies>air fryer cookies</a> where sugar plays multiple roles.</p>
<p>The 10g caster sugar to ounces conversion becomes even more critical when scaling recipes up or down. Air fryer capacities vary, so you might need to adjust quantities from standard recipes. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> can help with these adjustments, ensuring your bakes turn out perfectly every time.</p>

<h3>Measuring without scales</h3>
<p>If you don't have digital scales, you can approximate 10g of caster sugar (0.35 oz) using measuring spoons. Two level teaspoons will give you roughly the right amount, though for best results we recommend investing in a small kitchen scale. This is especially true for air fryer baking where precision impacts the final product.</p>

<h2>Common uses for 10g caster sugar</h2>
<p>You'll often find 10g measurements in small-batch air fryer recipes. This quantity might be used to sweeten a single portion of <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>air fryer desserts</a> or as part of a larger recipe's sugar component. Understanding the 10g caster sugar to ounces conversion helps when following both UK and international recipes.</p>
<p>When preparing items like air fryer sponge cakes or meringues, the 10g measurement might represent the sugar for egg whites or a small quantity needed for balancing flavours. The rapid cooking in air fryers means sugar caramelises quickly, so getting your 0.35 ounces (10g) measurement spot on ensures perfect results without burning.</p>

<h3>Storing caster sugar properly</h3>
<p>To maintain accuracy in your 10g caster sugar measurements, store it in an airtight container. Humidity can cause caster sugar to clump, making precise measurements difficult. This is particularly important for air fryer users, as consistent ingredient quality leads to better baking outcomes.</p>

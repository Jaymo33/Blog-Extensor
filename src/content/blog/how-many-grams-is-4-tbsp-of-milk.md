<p>4 tablespoons (tbsp) of milk weigh approximately 60 grams in the UK. This conversion is essential for precise cooking, especially when using an air fryer where measurements can affect texture and cooking times. Whether you're whipping up a cake or a creamy sauce, knowing the exact weight ensures consistency. For more air fryer-friendly conversions, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate milk measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on precise ingredient ratios to deliver perfect results. Too much or too little milk can alter the texture of batters, sauces, or baked goods. For example, adding extra milk to a cake mix might make it too dense, while too little could dry it out. Many <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> call for milk, so getting the grams right is key. This is especially true for UK cooks, where tablespoon sizes align with metric measurements.</p>  

<p>Milk is a common ingredient in air fryer recipes, from pancakes to creamy pasta sauces. If you’re working with frozen ingredients, like those in our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/frozen-foods>frozen foods section</a>, precise milk measurements help balance moisture levels. A 60-gram equivalent for 4 tbsp ensures your dish turns out as intended. No guesswork needed!</p>  

<h2>How to measure 4 tbsp of milk accurately</h2>  
<p>For the most precise measurement, use a digital kitchen scale to weigh your milk. If you don’t have one, a standard UK tablespoon holds 15ml, so 4 tbsp equal 60ml. Since milk’s density is close to water (1g/ml), this translates to roughly 60 grams. However, factors like fat content (whole vs. skimmed) can cause slight variations. For air fryer baking, sticking to 60 grams is a safe bet.</p>  

<h3>Converting other milk quantities</h3>  
<p>Need to adjust your recipe? Here’s a quick reference: 1 tbsp of milk = 15 grams, 2 tbsp = 30 grams, and 3 tbsp = 45 grams. If you’re scaling up, 8 tbsp (½ cup) would be around 120 grams. Bookmark our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a> for easy access during cooking sessions.</p>  

<h2>Common air fryer recipes using 4 tbsp of milk</h2>  
<p>Many air fryer favourites call for this measurement. For instance, a classic pancake batter might use 4 tbsp (60g) of milk for lightness. Similarly, breaded chicken or fish coatings often include milk to help crumbs adhere. Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipes</a> for inspiration where milk plays a key role.</p>

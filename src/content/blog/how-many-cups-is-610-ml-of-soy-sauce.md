<h2>Why Accurate Soy Sauce Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of soy sauce is crucial in air fryer cooking. Too little, and your dish may lack depth; too much, and it can become overly salty. Converting 610 ml of soy sauce to cups (about 2.58 UK cups) ensures balanced flavours. Many air fryer recipes, like our popular <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>teriyaki chicken</a>, rely on precise soy sauce measurements for the best results. A slight variation can alter the taste significantly, so measuring correctly is key.</p>  

<p>For baking or glazing, 610 ml of soy sauce (2.57 US cups) provides enough liquid for even coating without overpowering other ingredients. If you're working with smaller quantities, check our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for quick reference. Whether you're cooking for one or meal prepping, accurate measurements save time and reduce waste.</p>  

<h3>UK vs. US Cup Measurements</h3>  
<p>In the UK, 1 cup equals 284 ml, while in the US, it's 237 ml. This means 610 ml of soy sauce converts to 2.58 UK cups or 2.57 US cups. The difference is minimal but worth noting for precision. If you're following a recipe from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken dishes</a>, always check which measurement system it uses. Most air fryer recipes on our site specify UK measurements unless stated otherwise.</p>  

<h2>How to Measure 610 ml of Soy Sauce Without a Measuring Cup</h2>  
<p>No measuring cup? No problem. A standard UK mug holds about 300 ml, so 610 ml of soy sauce is roughly two mugs minus a tablespoon. For US measurements, use a 240 ml cup (common in American kitchens) and fill it 2.5 times. If precision is critical, a kitchen scale set to grams (610 ml â‰ˆ 625g) can help.

<p>Another trick is to use tablespoons: 1 UK cup = 16 tbsp, so 610 ml (2.58 cups) equals about 41 tbsp. This method works well for smaller adjustments. If you're preparing a <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable stir-fry</a>, you can gradually add soy sauce until the flavour is just right. Remember, soy sauce reduces during cooking, so start with slightly less if unsure.</p>

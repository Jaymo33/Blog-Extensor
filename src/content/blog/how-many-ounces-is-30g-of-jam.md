<p>30 grams of jam is approximately 1.06 ounces. This conversion is handy when following air fryer recipes that require precise measurements. Whether you’re making a glaze for air-fried pastries or adding a sweet touch to desserts, knowing how to convert grams to ounces ensures accuracy. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we love helping you get the measurements spot on for perfect results every time.</p>

<h2>Why Convert 30g of Jam to Ounces?</h2>  
<p>Many UK recipes use grams, while others rely on ounces, especially when referencing older cookbooks or international guides. Converting 30g of jam to ounces (1.06 oz) helps maintain consistency in your air fryer cooking. Whether you’re preparing a <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert</a> or a savoury dish with a jam glaze, precise measurements matter. Air fryers cook quickly, so even small measurement errors can affect texture and flavour.</p>  

<p>Using 30g of jam (1.06 oz) ensures your recipes stay balanced. For example, if you’re making air-fried doughnuts, too much jam can make them soggy, while too little might leave them dry. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> simplifies these calculations, so you can focus on cooking.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure 30g of Jam Accurately</h3>  
<p>To measure 30g of jam, use a digital kitchen scale for precision. If you don’t have one, two level teaspoons roughly equal 30g (1.06 oz). For sticky ingredients like jam, lightly grease the spoon to help it slide off easily. This method works well for air fryer recipes like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/breakfast>breakfast pastries</a> or glazed meats.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for 30g of Jam in Air Fryers</h2>  
<p>30g of jam (1.06 oz) is perfect for glazing air-fried chicken wings or brushing over pastries. It’s also ideal for filling thumbprint cookies or adding sweetness to <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>cakes</a>. Since air fryers circulate hot air, a light layer of jam caramelises beautifully without burning.</p>  

<p>For a quick dessert, try spreading 30g of jam over puff pastry before air frying. The result is a crispy, golden treat with a gooey centre. Visit <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>our recipe hub</a> for more creative ways to use 30g of jam in your air fryer.</p>  

<h3>Tips for Storing and Using Jam in Air Fryer Recipes</h3>

Always clean your air fryer basket after using sticky ingredients like jam—our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning guide</a> makes it effortless.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of coconut milk can make or break your dish, especially in an air fryer where consistency is key. Too much liquid can lead to soggy results, while too little might dry out your food. For recipes like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>air fryer chicken curry</a>, 0.25 cups of coconut milk (59 ml) provides the perfect balance of creaminess without overwhelming the dish. Precision ensures your meals turn out just as intended, whether you're cooking for one or meal prepping for the week.</p>  

<p>Many air fryer recipes, like those found on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>our recipe page</a>, rely on exact measurements to achieve the best texture and flavour.

<h3>How to Measure 0.25 Cups of Coconut Milk Without a Measuring Cup</h3>  
<p>Don’t have a measuring cup handy? No problem. You can use a standard tablespoon to measure out 0.25 cups of coconut milk. Since 1 tablespoon is roughly 15 ml, you’ll need about 4 tablespoons to reach 59 ml. For thicker coconut milk, stir it well before measuring to ensure consistency. This method works perfectly for recipes like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>air fryer desserts</a>, where precision matters.</p>  

<h2>Converting 0.25 Cups of Coconut Milk for Different Recipes</h2>  
<p>Whether you're making a savoury or sweet dish, 0.25 cups of coconut milk (59 ml) can be used in countless ways. For example, in a <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/shrimp>shrimp curry</a>, this amount adds just enough creaminess without overpowering the seafood. In desserts like coconut rice pudding, 59 ml of coconut milk delivers a subtle tropical flavour. Always check your recipe’s requirements, as some may call for light or full-fat coconut milk, which can slightly affect the measurement.</p>

<h3>Common Mistakes When Measuring Coconut Milk</h3>  
<p>One frequent error is not shaking the coconut milk can before measuring, leading to inconsistent results. The thicker cream often separates from the liquid, so mixing ensures uniformity. Another mistake is using a liquid measuring cup for small amounts like 0.25 cups (59 ml)—a kitchen scale or tablespoon is often more accurate. For best results, always level off your measurements with a straight edge.</p>

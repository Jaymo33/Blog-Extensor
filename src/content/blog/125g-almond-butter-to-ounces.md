<p>125g of almond butter equals approximately 4.41 ounces. Whether you're whipping up a batch of air fryer cookies or a nutty glaze for chicken, precise measurements matter. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we know how frustrating it can be to juggle metric and imperial units mid-recipe. That’s why we’ve broken down the conversion so you can focus on cooking, not calculations.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on even cooking, and ingredient proportions play a huge role. Too much almond butter in a batter, for instance, can make it dense or oily. Conversely, too little might leave your dish lacking richness. By converting 125g of almond butter to ounces correctly, you ensure consistency in every batch. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> simplifies these adjustments for all your favourite recipes.</p>  

<p>Almond butter’s density means 125g isn’t a straightforward cup measurement—it’s weight-based. This is especially crucial for air fryer baking, where precision affects texture.

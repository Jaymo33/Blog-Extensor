<p>150g of soy sauce equals approximately 5.29 ounces. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements can make or break a dish. Whether you’re marinating chicken or whipping up a stir-fry, knowing how to convert grams to ounces ensures your flavours are spot-on. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we help you nail these details for perfect results every time.</p>  

<h2>Why converting 150g of soy sauce to ounces matters</h2>  
<p>Many UK recipes, especially those for air fryers, use metric measurements like grams. However, some kitchen scales or older cookbooks might list ounces instead. Converting 150g soy sauce to ounces (5.29 oz) ensures you’re using the right amount for marinades, glazes, or dipping sauces. Too much soy sauce can overpower a dish, while too little might leave it bland. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> makes these swaps effortless.</p>  

<p>Air fryer cooking thrives on precision, especially with liquids like soy sauce. A slight miscalculation can affect texture and flavour. For example, 150g of soy sauce (5.29 oz) is roughly half a UK cup. If your recipe calls for this amount, measuring accurately ensures your air-fried tofu or chicken isn’t too salty or under-seasoned. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a> for perfectly balanced dishes.</p>  

<h3>Tools to measure 150g soy sauce in ounces</h3>  
<p>Digital kitchen scales are the easiest way to measure 150g of soy sauce (5.29 oz). Look for one with unit switching between grams and ounces. If you don’t have scales, a liquid measuring jug with metric and imperial markings works too. Just pour slowly to avoid spills—soy sauce stains are stubborn!

<h2>Common uses for 150g of soy sauce in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>This quantity (5.29 oz) is ideal for marinating proteins like chicken or tofu. A 150g soy sauce marinade can cover 4-6 chicken thighs or a block of pressed tofu. The air fryer’s high heat caramelises the soy sauce, creating a delicious glaze. Try it in our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipes</a> for sticky, flavourful results.</p>  

<p>You might also use 150g of soy sauce (5.29 oz) in stir-fry sauces or as a base for homemade teriyaki. When air-frying vegetables like broccoli or mushrooms, a light soy sauce toss adds umami depth. Remember, soy sauce reduces during cooking, so start with the measured 150g and adjust to taste.

<h3>Adjusting recipes when converting 150g soy sauce to ounces</h3>  
<p>Some recipes may need tweaking after converting 150g soy sauce to 5.29 oz. If the dish seems too salty, balance it with a splash of water or a squeeze of citrus. For thicker sauces, reduce the quantity slightly or add a teaspoon of cornflour. Always taste as you go—air frying intensifies flavours compared to traditional cooking methods.</p>

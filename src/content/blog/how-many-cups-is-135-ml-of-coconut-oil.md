<p>135 ml of coconut oil is roughly 0.57 cups (just over half a cup). This conversion is essential for baking, frying, or air frying, where precise measurements matter. Whether you're following a recipe from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> or adjusting quantities, knowing this conversion ensures your dishes turn out perfectly.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Frying</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of coconut oil can make or break your air-fried dishes. Too little, and your food may stick or dry out; too much, and it can become greasy. Many <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> call for coconut oil due to its high smoke point and health benefits. Measuring 135 ml of coconut oil correctly ensures even cooking and better texture.</p>  

<p>For example, if a recipe requires 135 ml of coconut oil, knowing it’s about 0.57 cups helps avoid guesswork. This is especially useful when scaling recipes up or down.

<h2>How to Measure 135 ml of Coconut Oil Without a Measuring Cup</h2>  
<p>If you don’t have a measuring cup, you can still measure 135 ml of coconut oil accurately. One tablespoon holds about 15 ml, so 135 ml equals roughly 9 tablespoons. Alternatively, a standard UK metric cup holds 250 ml, so 135 ml is just over half a cup.</p>  

<h3>Using a Kitchen Scale for Precision</h3>  
<p>For even more accuracy, weigh your coconut oil. Coconut oil weighs approximately 0.92 grams per ml, so 135 ml is about 124 grams. This method eliminates any uncertainty, especially when working with sticky or solid coconut oil.</p>  

<h2>Common Recipes Using 135 ml of Coconut Oil</h2>

Similarly, baked goods like muffins or cookies benefit from precise measurements.</p>

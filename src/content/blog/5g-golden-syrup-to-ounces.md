<h2>Why accurate conversions matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Golden syrup is a staple in many British recipes, from sticky puddings to glazes for meats. When using an air fryer, precise measurements ensure even cooking and perfect texture. Too much syrup can make dishes overly sweet or sticky, while too little might leave them lacking flavour. Converting 5g of golden syrup to ounces (0.18 oz) helps you follow recipes accurately, whether you’re baking or cooking savoury dishes.</p>

It’s packed with handy conversions for grams, ounces, and other common units.

<h2>How to measure 5g of golden syrup without scales</h2>  
<p>Not everyone has a kitchen scale, but you can still measure 5g of golden syrup accurately. A teaspoon holds roughly 7g of golden syrup, so slightly less than a level teaspoon will give you about 5g. Alternatively, a metric measuring spoon set often includes a 5g spoon, which is perfect for this measurement. Remember, golden syrup is sticky, so lightly greasing your spoon can help it slide off easily.</p>  

<h3>Using volume measurements for golden syrup</h3>  
<p>If you prefer volume measurements, 5g of golden syrup is roughly 1.2 teaspoons. This is useful if your recipe calls for volume rather than weight. However, weight measurements are more accurate, especially for sticky ingredients like golden syrup.

<h2>Common uses for 5g of golden syrup in air fryer recipes</h2>  
<p>Golden syrup adds a rich, caramel-like sweetness to both sweet and savoury dishes. In your air fryer, 5g of golden syrup can be used to glaze roasted vegetables, add shine to pastries, or sweeten marinades. It’s also a key ingredient in many British desserts, like treacle tart or flapjacks. Measuring 5g accurately ensures your dishes have the perfect balance of sweetness.</p>

<h2>Tips for storing and handling golden syrup</h2>  
<p>Golden syrup is thick and sticky, making it tricky to measure and store. To keep it fresh, store it in a cool, dry place and ensure the lid is tightly sealed. If your syrup crystallises, gently warm the jar in hot water to return it to its smooth consistency. When measuring 5g, a silicone spatula can help scrape every last bit from your spoon or measuring cup.</p>

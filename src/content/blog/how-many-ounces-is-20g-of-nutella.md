<p>20g of Nutella equals approximately 0.71 ounces. This conversion is handy when following air fryer recipes that require precise measurements, especially for baking or dessert prep. Whether you're making Nutella-stuffed cookies or a quick chocolate drizzle, knowing the exact weight ensures perfect results every time.</p>  

<h2>Why Convert Grams to Ounces for Nutella?</h2>  
<p>Many UK air fryer recipes use grams, but some kitchen scales or older cookbooks might list ingredients in ounces. Converting 20g of Nutella to ounces (0.71 oz) helps avoid guesswork, ensuring your treats turn out just right. Nutella’s thick consistency makes it tricky to measure by volume, so weight is far more accurate.</p>  

<p>If you're prepping a batch of <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer cookies</a>, precise measurements prevent dough from becoming too sticky or dry. A digital kitchen scale is your best friend here—simply tare your bowl, scoop Nutella, and check the display.

<h3>How to Measure 20g of Nutella Without a Scale</h3>  
<p>No scale? No problem. A heaped tablespoon of Nutella weighs roughly 20g (0.71 oz), though this can vary slightly depending on how tightly packed it is. For sticky spreads, lightly grease your spoon or use a spatula to scrape it clean. This method works well for recipes like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>air fryer desserts</a> where precision matters less.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for 20g of Nutella in Air Fryer Recipes</h2>  
<p>This small amount of Nutella is perfect for drizzling over air-fried bananas, filling crepes, or mixing into brownie batter. Its rich flavour means a little goes a long way. Try swirling 20g into muffin batter before air frying for a gooey centre—just ensure it’s evenly distributed to avoid burning.</p>  

<p>For a quick snack, spread 20g (0.71 oz) of Nutella on toast and air fry for 2 minutes until warm and melty. Pair it with <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/breakfast>air fryer breakfast recipes</a> like croissants or pancakes. Remember, Nutella burns easily, so keep an eye on cooking times and temperatures.</p>  

<h3>Storing Nutella for Accurate Measurements</h3>  
<p>Nutella hardens slightly when refrigerated, making it harder to scoop. For easy measuring, store it at room temperature and stir well before use. If your recipe calls for melted Nutella, gently warm 20g (0.71 oz) in a microwave-safe bowl for 10-second intervals, stirring between each.</p>

<p>Cleaning Nutella residue from your air fryer basket? Soak it in warm, soapy water or use a dedicated <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner</a> to avoid scratches. Sticky spills can smoke at high temperatures, so wipe surfaces promptly after cooking.</p>

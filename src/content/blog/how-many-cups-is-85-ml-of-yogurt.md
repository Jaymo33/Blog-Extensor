<p>85 ml of yogurt is approximately 0.36 cups in the US measurement system and 0.3 cups in the UK. This conversion is essential for baking, cooking, or preparing air fryer recipes where precise measurements matter. Whether you're whipping up a cake or marinating chicken for the air fryer, knowing how to convert 85 ml of yogurt to cups ensures your dish turns out perfectly.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of yogurt can make or break a recipe. Too much can make baked goods soggy, while too little might leave them dry. For air fryer cooking, precise measurements help maintain texture and flavour. If you're following a recipe from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, getting the yogurt quantity right ensures your dish matches the intended result.</p>  

<p>Yogurt is often used in marinades, dressings, and baking for its creamy texture and tangy taste. Whether you're making a <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken dish</a> or a <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert</a>, converting 85 ml of yogurt to cups correctly guarantees consistency. A slight variation might not ruin a dish, but precision elevates your cooking.</p>  

<h2>Converting 85 ml of Yogurt to Cups</h2>  
<p>The conversion depends on whether you're using US or UK measurements. In the US, 1 cup equals 240 ml, so 85 ml is roughly 0.36 cups. In the UK, 1 cup is 284 ml, making 85 ml about 0.3 cups. This difference might seem small, but it's crucial for recipes requiring exact proportions.</p>  

<h3>Using a Measuring Cup</h3>  
<p>If you don't have a metric measuring tool, use a standard cup and fill it just over a third for US measurements or slightly less for UK. For air fryer recipes, especially those involving marinades or batters, accuracy ensures even cooking and perfect results every time.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for 85 ml of Yogurt</h2>  
<p>Yogurt is versatile in cooking. You might use 85 ml in a marinade for <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/beef>beef</a> or as a base for dips. It's also great in baking, adding moisture to cakes and muffins. For air fryer users, yogurt helps create crispy coatings or tenderises proteins.</p>  

<h3>Air Fryer Recipe Ideas</h3>  
<p>Try using 85 ml of yogurt in a tandoori marinade or mixing it with spices for a creamy dip. Check out <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> for inspiration. Their <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a> can also help adjust other ingredients.</p>  

<h2>Tips for Measuring Yogurt</h2>  
<p>Stir yogurt before measuring to ensure consistency. If a recipe calls for 85 ml of yogurt in cups, use a liquid measuring cup for accuracy. For thicker yogurts, like Greek, spoon it into the cup and level it off. This method prevents air gaps and ensures the right amount.</p>

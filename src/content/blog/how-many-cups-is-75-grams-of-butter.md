<p>Butter measurements can vary slightly between the UK and US due to cup size differences. In the UK, a standard cup holds 250ml, while in the US, it’s 240ml. This means 75 grams of butter in the UK might fill a cup slightly differently than in the US, though the difference is minimal for most home cooking. Always check your recipe’s origin to ensure accuracy.</p>

<h2>How to Measure 75 Grams of Butter Without Scales</h2>
<p>Don’t have kitchen scales? No problem! You can measure 75 grams of butter using tablespoons or the markings on a butter wrapper. One tablespoon of butter weighs about 14 grams, so 75 grams is roughly 5.5 tablespoons. Alternatively, a standard UK butter block is often marked in 50-gram increments—just cut slightly over halfway between 50g and 100g.</p>
<p>For air fryer recipes, softened butter is easier to measure accurately. If your recipe calls for melted butter, note that 75 grams of melted butter will still equate to roughly 1/3 cup.

    "@type": "Answer",
    "text": "Yes, you can substitute margarine for butter in equal amounts (75 grams or 1/3 cup), but be aware it may alter flavour and texture. Margarine often has higher water content, which can affect crispiness in air-fried foods. For best results, stick to butter unless the recipe specifies otherwise."

<p>75 grams of butter is roughly equivalent to 1/3 cup (or 0.33 cups to be precise). This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements can make or break your dish. Whether you’re whipping up crispy cookies or a buttery cake in your air fryer, knowing how many cups 75 grams of butter equals ensures perfect results every time.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Butter Measurements Matter in Air Frying</h2>
<p>Air fryers rely on precise ingredient ratios to achieve that perfect crispiness without overcooking. Using too much butter can lead to greasy results, while too little may leave your dish dry. Converting 75 grams of butter to cups (approximately 1/3 cup) helps maintain balance in recipes like air-fried pastries or roasted vegetables. For more air fryer tips, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>
<p>Butter measurements can vary slightly between the UK and US due to cup size differences. In the UK, a standard cup holds 250ml, while in the US, it’s 240ml. This means 75 grams of butter in the UK might fill a cup slightly differently than in the US, though the difference is minimal for most home cooking. Always check your recipe’s origin to ensure accuracy.</p>

<h2>How to Measure 75 Grams of Butter Without Scales</h2>
<p>Don’t have kitchen scales? No problem! You can measure 75 grams of butter using tablespoons or the markings on a butter wrapper. One tablespoon of butter weighs about 14 grams, so 75 grams is roughly 5.5 tablespoons. Alternatively, a standard UK butter block is often marked in 50-gram increments—just cut slightly over halfway between 50g and 100g.</p>
<p>For air fryer recipes, softened butter is easier to measure accurately. If your recipe calls for melted butter, note that 75 grams of melted butter will still equate to roughly 1/3 cup. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipes section</a> for ideas on using butter in air-fried dishes like garlic bread or shortbread.</p>

<h3>Butter Conversions for Common Air Fryer Recipes</h3>
<p>Many air fryer recipes, from cakes to savoury dishes, use butter as a key ingredient. Here’s a quick reference for 75 grams of butter in other units: 2.65 ounces, 5.5 tablespoons, or 0.33 cups. This versatility makes it easy to adapt recipes whether you’re making air-fried <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>cakes</a> or crispy potatoes.</p>

<h2>Tips for Using Butter in Your Air Fryer</h2>
<p>Butter can enhance flavour and texture in air-fried dishes, but it’s important to use it wisely. For 75 grams of butter (1/3 cup), consider brushing it lightly onto foods like corn on the cob or toast rather than drowning them. Too much butter can cause smoking in your air fryer, so moderation is key. Always preheat your air fryer to avoid uneven cooking.</p>
<p>If you’re health-conscious, you can substitute part of the 75 grams of butter with alternatives like olive oil or applesauce in certain recipes. However, for baking, butter’s fat content is often crucial for texture.

<h3>Butter Measurement FAQs for Air Fryer Cooking</h3>
<p>Struggling with conversions? Remember that 75 grams of butter equals about 1/3 cup, but always double-check if your recipe specifies packed or melted butter. For more precision, invest in a small kitchen scale—they’re inexpensive and perfect for air fryer enthusiasts who love experimenting with <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>desserts</a> or savoury dishes.</p>

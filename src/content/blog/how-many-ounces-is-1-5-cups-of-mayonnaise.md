<p>1.5 cups of mayonnaise equals approximately 12 ounces. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements can make all the difference. Whether you’re whipping up a batch of crispy chicken or a creamy dip, knowing how many ounces are in 1.5 cups of mayonnaise ensures your dish turns out perfectly every time.</p>

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>
<p>Air fryers rely on precise ingredient ratios to achieve that perfect crispiness. Too much or too little mayonnaise can affect the texture and flavour of your dish. For example, a <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>mayo-coated chicken recipe</a> might turn out soggy if you use more than 12 ounces of mayonnaise for 1.5 cups. On the other hand, too little could leave your dish dry.</p>
<p>Many air fryer enthusiasts swear by using a kitchen scale for accuracy. While measuring cups are convenient, weighing ingredients like mayonnaise ensures consistency. If you’re serious about air fryer cooking, consider checking out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>comprehensive conversion chart</a> for other common ingredients.</p>

<h2>How to measure 1.5 cups of mayonnaise correctly</h2>
<p>Measuring sticky ingredients like mayonnaise can be tricky. Here’s a pro tip: lightly grease your measuring cup with oil before scooping the mayonnaise. This helps it slide out easily, giving you a more accurate measurement. Alternatively, you could use the displacement method – fill a liquid measuring cup with water to the 1.5 cup mark, then add mayonnaise until the water reaches 3 cups.</p>
<p>For UK cooks, remember that our cups are based on the metric system. A UK cup is 284ml, slightly different from the US cup (240ml). This means 1.5 UK cups of mayonnaise would be about 426ml, which converts to roughly 14.4 ounces. Always check which cup measurement your recipe uses!</p>

<h3>Common mayonnaise measurements for air fryer recipes</h3>
<p>Many air fryer recipes call for mayonnaise as a binder or coating. Here are some typical amounts you might encounter: 1/4 cup (2 oz) for a small batch of <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>air fryer chicken wings</a>, 1/2 cup (4 oz) for a family-sized portion, or our 1.5 cups (12 oz) for larger recipes. Knowing these conversions helps you scale recipes up or down as needed.</p>

<h2>Converting other mayonnaise amounts to ounces</h2>
<p>While we’ve focused on 1.5 cups, you might need other conversions too. One cup of mayonnaise equals 8 ounces, so simple multiplication gives you other amounts. Two cups would be 16 ounces, half a cup is 4 ounces, and so on. These conversions are particularly useful when adapting recipes for your air fryer.</p>
<p>If you’re working with a recipe that uses grams instead, remember that 1 ounce equals about 28 grams. So our 12 ounces of mayonnaise would be approximately 340 grams. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a> includes these metric measurements too, making it a valuable resource for all your air fryer cooking needs.</p>

<h3>Tips for working with mayonnaise in air fryers</h3>
<p>Mayonnaise can behave differently in air fryers compared to conventional ovens. Its high fat content means it browns quickly, so you might need to adjust cooking times. For best results, apply mayonnaise coatings thinly and evenly. Thick globs can lead to uneven cooking or dripping, which might require extra <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning</a> afterwards.</p>

<h2>Frequently used mayonnaise measurements in air fryer cooking</h2>
<p>Beyond our 1.5 cups (12 ounces) conversion, here are some other common mayonnaise measurements you’ll encounter in air fryer recipes: 1 tablespoon (0.5 oz) for small batches, 1/4 cup (2 oz) for coatings, and 1 cup (8 oz) for larger recipes. Keeping these in mind helps you quickly adapt any recipe to your needs.</p>
<p>When experimenting with your own creations, start with these standard amounts and adjust as needed. The beauty of air fryer cooking is its flexibility – once you master basic measurements like our 1.5 cups of mayonnaise to ounces conversion, you can confidently create your own <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable coatings</a> and marinades.</p>

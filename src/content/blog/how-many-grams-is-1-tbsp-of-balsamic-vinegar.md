<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on hot air circulation, so ingredient ratios can make or break a dish. Too much liquid, like balsamic vinegar, can lead to steaming instead of crisping. On the other hand, too little might leave your food bland. By converting 1 tbsp of balsamic vinegar to grams, you ensure consistency across recipes. This is especially useful when scaling up or down for meal prep.</p>  

<p>Many air fryer recipes, like our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>balsamic-glazed salmon</a>, depend on balanced acidity and sweetness. A precise 15-gram measure of balsamic vinegar guarantees the right caramelisation without burning. If you're experimenting with new dishes, always weigh ingredients for reliable results.</p>  

<h3>How to measure balsamic vinegar correctly</h3>  
<p>For the most accurate conversion of 1 tbsp balsamic vinegar to grams, use digital kitchen scales. Scoop the vinegar into a measuring spoon, then pour it onto the scale. If you don’t have scales, remember that UK tablespoons hold 15ml, which roughly equals 15 grams for balsamic vinegar due to its density. Avoid guessing—especially when preparing <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>air fryer chicken recipes</a>, where marinades need precision.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for balsamic vinegar in air fryers</h2>  
<p>Balsamic vinegar adds depth to air-fried vegetables, meats, and even desserts.

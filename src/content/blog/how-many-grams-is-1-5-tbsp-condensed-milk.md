<p>1.5 tablespoons of condensed milk equals approximately 30 grams. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precision matters, especially in baking or dessert-making. Whether you're whipping up a cake or a creamy sauce, knowing the exact weight ensures consistency. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we focus on helping you achieve perfect results with accurate measurements.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Using the correct amount of condensed milk can make or break your air fryer recipes. Too little, and your dessert might lack sweetness; too much, and it could become overly dense. Condensed milk is a staple in many treats, from fudgy brownies to sticky toffee puddings. For more air fryer baking tips, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipes section</a>.</p>  

<p>Air fryers distribute heat differently than conventional ovens, so precise ingredient ratios are crucial. A slight variation in condensed milk can affect texture and cooking time. That’s why converting 1.5 tbsp of condensed milk to grams (30g) ensures reliability. Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a> for other common measurements.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure Condensed Milk Correctly</h3>  
<p>For the most accurate results, use a digital kitchen scale to weigh your condensed milk. Scoop the milk gently with a tablespoon, levelling it off for consistency. If you don’t have a scale, remember that 1.5 tbsp is roughly 30 grams. This method works for UK measurements and ensures your air fryer desserts turn out perfectly every time.</p>  

<h2>Common Recipes Using 1.5 Tbsp Condensed Milk</h2>  
<p>Many air fryer recipes call for small amounts of condensed milk, such as glazes, fillings, or no-bake treats. For example, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert category</a> features recipes like air-fried banoffee pie or caramel drizzle cakes. Knowing that 1.5 tbsp equals 30 grams helps streamline your prep.</p>  

<p>Condensed milk adds richness to air fryer cookies and cheesecakes, so precise measuring ensures balanced flavours. If you’re experimenting, start with 30 grams (1.5 tbsp) and adjust to taste. For more inspiration, browse our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning guide</a> to keep your appliance in top shape between bakes.</p>  

<h3>Converting Other Condensed Milk Measurements</h3>  
<p>Need to scale up or down? Here’s a quick reference: 1 tbsp condensed milk = 20 grams, while 2 tbsp = 40 grams. This flexibility lets you adapt recipes without guesswork. Whether you’re making a single serving or a batch, these conversions ensure consistency across all your air fryer creations.</p>

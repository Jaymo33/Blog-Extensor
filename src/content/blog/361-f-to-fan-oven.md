<p>361 F converts to approximately 183 C in a fan oven. This temperature is ideal for achieving crispy yet tender results when air frying or baking. Whether you're adapting an American recipe or fine-tuning your air fryer settings, understanding this conversion ensures perfect cooking every time.</p>

<h2>Why Convert 361 F to Fan Oven?</h2>
<p>Many recipes, especially those from the US, use Fahrenheit measurements that need converting for UK fan ovens. The 361 F to fan oven conversion is particularly useful for air fryer cooking, where precise temperatures matter. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we recommend this temperature for dishes requiring a balance between browning and thorough cooking.</p>
<p>Fan ovens circulate hot air for even heat distribution, similar to air fryers. Converting 361 F ensures your oven matches the cooking environment of an air fryer. This is crucial when following recipes from our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a> that specify air fryer temperatures.</p>

<h2>How to Use 361 F in Your Fan Oven</h2>
<p>When setting your fan oven to 183 C (the 361 F equivalent), preheating is essential. This gives the best results for crispy chicken, roasted vegetables or baked goods. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a> shows this is the sweet spot for many air fryer recipes.</p>
<p>For foods that normally cook at 361 F in an air fryer, you'll typically need to add 5-10 minutes to the cooking time in a fan oven. The larger space means heat distributes differently, though the 361 F to fan oven conversion maintains the same cooking intensity.</p>

<h3>Adjustments for Different Foods</h3>
<p>When cooking meat at 361 F fan oven temperature, use a meat thermometer to check doneness. For vegetables, toss them in oil first to promote even browning at this temperature. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable recipes</a> specifically benefit from this conversion.</p>

<h2>361 F Fan Oven vs Conventional Oven</h2>
<p>The 361 F to fan oven conversion differs from conventional oven settings. In a traditional oven without fan assistance, you'd need to increase the temperature by about 20 C to achieve similar results. This makes the 361 F fan oven equivalent more energy efficient.</p>
<p>Air fryers operate similarly to fan ovens but with more intense air circulation. That's why the 361 F air fryer setting converts directly to fan oven temperature without adjustment. For cleaning tips after high-temperature cooking, see our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning guide</a>.</p>

<h3>Common Uses for 361 F in Fan Ovens</h3>
<p>This temperature works perfectly for reheating fried foods, baking cookies, or roasting nuts. The 361 F fan oven setting gives that ideal balance between thorough cooking and surface crispness that air fryer users appreciate.</p>

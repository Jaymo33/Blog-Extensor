<p>1 cup of ground coriander equals approximately 3.5 ounces (or 3.5 oz). This measurement is essential for air fryer recipes, ensuring your dishes have the perfect balance of flavour. Whether you're making spiced chicken, roasted vegetables, or a fragrant curry, accurate measurements make all the difference.</p>

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Using the correct amount of ground coriander ensures your dishes aren't overpowering or bland. The air fryer's intense heat can amplify flavours, so precision is key. Too much coriander might make your meal bitter, while too little could leave it tasting flat. For more tips on perfecting your air fryer meals, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipes section</a>.</p>  

<p>Ground coriander is a staple in many cuisines, from Indian curries to Middle Eastern dips. Knowing how many ounces are in 1 cup helps you adapt recipes effortlessly. If you're scaling up a dish or adjusting flavours, this conversion is invaluable. For more measurement guides, visit our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>  

<h3>How to measure ground coriander correctly</h3>  
<p>For the most accurate results, use a kitchen scale to weigh your ground coriander. If you don't have one, spoon the coriander into a measuring cup and level it off with a knife. Avoid packing it down, as this can lead to an uneven measurement. This method ensures you get the right 3.5 ounces per cup.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for ground coriander in air fryer recipes</h2>  
<p>Ground coriander adds warmth and depth to many air fryer dishes. Try it in spiced chicken wings, roasted potatoes, or even homemade falafel. It pairs beautifully with cumin, turmeric, and chilli powder for a flavourful rub. Explore more ideas in our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipe category</a>.</p>  

<p>You can also use ground coriander to season vegetables like carrots, cauliflower, or sweet potatoes before air frying. A little goes a long way, so stick to the 1 cup to 3.5 ounces ratio for best results. For cleaning tips after cooking with spices, see our guide on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner</a>.</p>  

<h3>Converting other measurements for ground coriander</h3>  
<p>If your recipe calls for tablespoons or grams instead of cups, here's a quick reference: 1 tablespoon of ground coriander is roughly 0.2 ounces, and 100 grams equals about 3.5 ounces. These conversions help when adjusting portion sizes or trying new dishes.</p>  

<h2>Storing ground coriander for freshness</h2>  
<p>To keep your ground coriander fresh, store it in an airtight container away from heat and light. Proper storage ensures the spice retains its flavour, making your 1 cup (3.5 ounces) measurement consistently tasty. For more storage tips, visit <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>.</p>  

<p>Ground coriander loses potency over time, so it's best used within six months. If your spice smells faint or lacks aroma, it might be time to replace it. Freshly ground coriander will give your air fryer dishes the best flavour, so measure carefully and enjoy the results.</p>

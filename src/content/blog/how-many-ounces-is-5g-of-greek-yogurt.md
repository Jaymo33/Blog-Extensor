<h2>Why Convert 5g of Greek Yogurt to Ounces?</h2>

Greek yogurt is a versatile ingredient, often used in healthy air fryer dishes like marinades or dips. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we recommend precise measurements for consistent results.

Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more handy tips. This small measurement is often used in dressings or as a binding agent in air fryer recipes.</p>

<h2>How to Measure 5g of Greek Yogurt Accurately</h2>
<p>Using a digital kitchen scale is the best way to measure 5g of Greek yogurt. Scales provide precise measurements, ensuring your recipes turn out as intended. If you don’t have a scale, 5g is roughly a teaspoon, but this can vary with yogurt thickness. For air fryer cooking, accuracy matters—especially in recipes like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>air fryer chicken</a> marinades.</p>

<h3>Using Measuring Spoons</h3>
<p>If you’re without a scale, a level teaspoon of Greek yogurt is close to 5g. However, thicker yogurts may require slightly less to hit the mark. For recipes on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we always recommend weighing ingredients when possible. This ensures your air fryer dishes have the perfect texture and flavour every time.</p>

<h2>Common Uses for 5g of Greek Yogurt in Air Fryer Recipes</h2>
<p>Though 5g seems small, it’s often used in dressings, glazes, or as a binder. For example, a 5g portion can add creaminess to a marinade for air-fried salmon. It’s also great in light dips for air-fried veggies or as a topping for baked potatoes. Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable recipes</a> for inspiration on how to use small amounts of Greek yogurt.</p>

<p>Greek yogurt is a healthier alternative to mayo or sour cream in air fryer dishes. Even 5g can make a difference in texture and taste. Whether you're making a tangy glaze or a light sauce, precise measurements ensure success.

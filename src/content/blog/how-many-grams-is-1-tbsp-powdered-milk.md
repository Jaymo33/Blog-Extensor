<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>

Unlike liquid milk, powdered milk has a concentrated flavour and texture, so even small deviations can affect the outcome. Always measure by weight for the best results.</p>

A kitchen scale eliminates guesswork, especially when working with ingredients like powdered milk that can settle or vary in density.

<p>0.125 cup of sesame oil equals 1 fluid ounce (oz). This measurement is crucial for precise cooking, especially when using an air fryer, where accurate ingredient quantities can make or break a recipe.</p>

<h2>Understanding the Conversion</h2>
<p>When converting 0.125 cup of sesame oil to ounces, it’s important to note that liquid measurements differ from dry ones. Sesame oil, like other liquids, follows a standard conversion where 1 cup equals 8 fluid ounces. Therefore, 0.125 cup is simply 1 ounce. This small measurement is often used in marinades, dressings, or air fryer recipes where a little goes a long way.</p>
<p>For those using UK measurements, the conversion remains the same, as fluid ounces are consistent across both systems. Whether you’re preparing a stir-fry or a glaze for your air-fried salmon, knowing how many ounces are in 0.125 cup of sesame oil ensures your dish turns out perfectly. Visit <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>our conversion chart</a> for more handy measurements.</p>

<h2>Why Precision Matters in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>
<p>Air fryers rely on precise ingredient ratios to achieve the best texture and flavour. Too much oil can make food greasy, while too little may result in dryness. Measuring 0.125 cup of sesame oil accurately (1 oz) helps maintain balance, especially in recipes like air-fried vegetables or tofu.</p>
<p>If you’re experimenting with new dishes, such as those in our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a>, precise measurements ensure consistency. Sesame oil adds a rich, nutty flavour, so getting the amount right is key. A kitchen scale can also help verify your measurements for foolproof results.</p>

<h3>Common Uses for 0.125 Cup of Sesame Oil</h3>
<p>This small quantity of sesame oil is perfect for drizzling over air-fried dishes or mixing into sauces. Try it in a marinade for chicken or as a finishing touch for roasted potatoes. Its intense flavour means a little goes a long way, making 0.125 cup (1 oz) ideal for most home cooking needs.</p>

<h2>Tips for Measuring Sesame Oil</h2>
<p>To measure 0.125 cup of sesame oil accurately, use a liquid measuring cup with clear markings. Alternatively, a tablespoon measure can help—0.125 cup equals 2 tablespoons. For sticky oils like sesame, lightly greasing the measuring spoon can help it slide out easily.</p>

<h3>Converting Other Sesame Oil Quantities</h3>

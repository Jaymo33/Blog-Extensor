<p>1.33 cups of lime juice equals approximately 10.64 ounces. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements can make or break a dish. Whether you’re marinating chicken or whipping up a zesty dessert, knowing the exact weight ensures consistency. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we help you nail every recipe with accurate conversions like this one.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Lime Juice Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of lime juice is crucial in air fryer cooking. Too little, and your dish might lack flavour; too much, and it could become overly acidic. For example, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer lime chicken recipe</a> relies on a perfect balance of citrus to achieve that tangy, tender result. Measuring 1.33 cups of lime juice to ounces (10.64 oz) ensures you stay on track.</p>  

<p>Lime juice also plays a key role in marinades, dressings, and even desserts like key lime pie. If you’re prepping a batch of <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>air fryer desserts</a>, precise measurements prevent soggy or dry outcomes. A kitchen scale can help, but our conversion chart makes it easy even without one.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure Lime Juice Without a Scale</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a scale, use liquid measuring cups for accuracy. Pour the lime juice to the 1.33-cup mark, then check our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a> for the ounce equivalent. Freshly squeezed lime juice may vary slightly in density, but 10.64 ounces is a reliable benchmark for most recipes.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for 1.33 Cups of Lime Juice</h2>  
<p>This quantity is perfect for marinating proteins like shrimp or chicken in your air fryer. A <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/shrimp>citrus shrimp recipe</a> might call for 1.33 cups of lime juice to infuse bold flavour. Alternatively, use it in dressings for air-fried vegetable dishes, ensuring every bite is vibrant and fresh.</p>  

<p>For desserts, 10.64 ounces of lime juice can transform into a creamy filling or glaze. Pair it with our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>air fryer cake recipes</a> for a tangy twist. Remember, precise measurements like 1.33 cups to ounces guarantee the right consistency and taste every time.</p>  

<h3>Tips for Storing Leftover Lime Juice</h3>  
<p>If you have extra lime juice, store it in an airtight container in the fridge for up to a week. Freezing in ice cube trays is another great option for future use. Just thaw and measure as needed for your next air fryer creation.</p>

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on even cooking, and small discrepancies in ingredient weights can affect texture and taste. Cream cheese, for example, can make a dish too dense or too runny if not measured correctly. Using grams instead of tablespoons ensures consistency, especially when scaling recipes up or down. Many UK cooks prefer weight measurements for baking and air frying, as they’re more reliable than volume.

<h2>Tips for working with cream cheese in air fryer recipes</h2>  
<p>Cream cheese can melt quickly in the air fryer, so it’s best used in layers or as a filling rather than exposed to direct heat. For stuffed recipes, chill the cream cheese mixture first to help it hold its shape. If you’re making a glaze, mix it with other ingredients to prevent burning.

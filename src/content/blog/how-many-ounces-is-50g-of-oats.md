<h3>How to Measure 50g of Oats Without Scales</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a kitchen scale, you can estimate 50g of oats using measuring cups. Roughly, 50g of oats equals about half a cup. However, this can vary slightly depending on the oat type (rolled, quick, or steel-cut). For the most accurate results, investing in a digital scale is best.</p>

<h3>Does the Type of Oat Affect the Weight?</h3>

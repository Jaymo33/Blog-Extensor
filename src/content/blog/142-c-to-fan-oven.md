<p>142 C converts to approximately 125 C in a fan oven. This 15-20°C reduction is standard when switching from conventional to fan-assisted cooking. Whether you're baking, roasting, or using your air fryer, understanding this conversion ensures perfect results every time.</p>

<h2>Why Fan Oven Temperatures Differ</h2>
<p>Fan ovens circulate hot air constantly, cooking food more evenly and efficiently. This means you can typically reduce the temperature by 15-20°C compared to conventional ovens. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we recommend starting with a 15°C reduction and adjusting based on your appliance. Many modern fan ovens even have specific air fryer functions that mimic this temperature conversion automatically.</p>
<p>The science behind this is simple: moving air transfers heat more effectively than still air. When converting 142 C to fan oven settings, you're compensating for this increased efficiency. This principle applies whether you're making <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>cakes</a> or roasting vegetables - the circulating air prevents hot spots and ensures even browning.</p>

<h2>Air Fryer Equivalent for 142 C</h2>
<p>Air fryers work similarly to fan ovens but with more intense air circulation. For most models, you can use the same 125 C setting as a fan oven. However, cooking times will typically be 20-30% shorter in an air fryer. We've tested this extensively at <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> with everything from frozen chips to homemade cookies.</p>
<p>Some premium air fryers have specific presets that handle the conversion automatically. If yours has a "bake" function, it will likely adjust the 142 C input to the appropriate fan-assisted temperature. For <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/potatoes>roast potatoes</a>, we find 125 C in the air fryer gives that perfect crisp exterior and fluffy interior.</p>

<h3>Adjusting Cooking Times</h3>
<p>When using 142 C in fan oven conversion, remember to check food 5-10 minutes earlier than the recipe suggests. The efficient heat distribution means dishes often cook faster. This is especially true for delicate items like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cookies>cookies</a> or soufflés that can over-brown quickly.</p>

<h2>Common Uses for 142 C Fan Setting</h2>
<p>The 125 C fan oven equivalent of 142 C is ideal for slow roasting and delicate baking. It's perfect for drying herbs, making meringues, or dehydrating fruits. In an air fryer, this temperature works wonderfully for reheating without drying food out.</p>
<p>Many <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> suggest this temperature range for cooking frozen foods evenly. The gentle heat prevents the outside from burning before the inside thaws. It's also great for keeping batches of roasted nuts or homemade granola warm without continuing to cook them.</p>

<h3>Troubleshooting Temperature Issues</h3>
<p>If food isn't cooking evenly at 125 C fan (142 C conventional), your oven might need recalibrating. Use an independent oven thermometer to verify the actual temperature. For air fryers, shaking the basket halfway through cooking helps ensure even results at this temperature.</p>

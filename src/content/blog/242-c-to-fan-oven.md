<p>242 C converts to approximately 220 C in a fan oven. This 20-degree reduction is standard for fan-assisted cooking, ensuring even heat distribution without overcooking. Whether you're baking cakes or roasting meats, this conversion keeps your recipes on track. For air fryer users, this same principle applies—adjusting temperatures prevents drying out your food. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more precise adjustments.</p>

<h2>Why Convert 242 C to Fan Oven?</h2>
<p>Fan ovens circulate hot air, cooking food faster than conventional ovens. At 242 C, this intense heat could burn edges while leaving centres undercooked. Dropping to 220 C balances the temperature for perfect results. This is especially crucial for delicate bakes like soufflés or <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>cakes</a>. Air fryers work similarly—their rapid air circulation mimics fan ovens, so the same 20-degree rule often applies. Always monitor cooking times, as fan-assisted methods can shave 5-10 minutes off recipes.</p>

<p>Many UK recipes now specify fan oven temperatures, but older cookbooks might use 242 C. Our conversion helps bridge this gap. For <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a>, start checking food 5 minutes early to account for faster cooking. Remember: ovens vary, so use these figures as guidelines rather than absolutes. An oven thermometer can verify your appliance’s accuracy.</p>

<h3>Air Fryer Equivalent for 242 C</h3>
<p>Most air fryers recommend reducing temperatures by 20 C from conventional oven settings—just like fan ovens. So 242 C becomes 220 C in both appliances. However, compact air fryer baskets may need slight tweaks. For crispy <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/potatoes>roast potatoes</a>, try 210 C to prevent over-browning. Always preheat your air fryer for consistent results, and shake the basket halfway through cooking.</p>

<h2>Common Uses for 242 C in Fan Ovens</h2>
<p>This high heat suits dishes needing a golden crust or quick bake. Think Yorkshire puddings, puff pastry, or <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cookies>shortbread cookies</a>. In a fan oven at 220 C, these cook evenly without scorching. For meats, sear first at 242 C, then reduce to 200 C to finish cooking through. Air fryers excel here—their concentrated heat mimics professional salamanders. Just remember to spritz oils lightly; their efficiency means less fat is needed.</p>

<p>Cleaning after high-heat cooking? Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner guide</a> tackles baked-on grease. At 242 C (or 220 C fan), sugars caramelise quickly, potentially causing smoke. Keep your appliance’s crumb tray clean to avoid this. For roasting vegetables, toss them in oil first—the fan’s airflow can dry surfaces faster than conventional ovens.</p>

<h3>Adjusting Cooking Times</h3>
<p>When converting 242 C to fan oven 220 C, reduce timings by 10-15%. A 30-minute bake might finish in 25 minutes. With air fryers, check even earlier—their compact space accelerates cooking further. Use visual cues: cakes should spring back when touched, and meats need internal thermometer checks. Resting times remain unchanged; pulled pork still benefits from a 30-minute wrap in foil.</p>

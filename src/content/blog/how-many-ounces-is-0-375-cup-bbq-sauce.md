<p>0.375 cup of BBQ sauce equals 3 ounces. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements ensure the best results. Whether you’re glazing chicken wings or marinating ribs, knowing the exact weight helps avoid overly saucy or dry dishes. For more air fryer conversion tips, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers cook food quickly and evenly, but incorrect measurements can throw off texture and flavour. Too much BBQ sauce can make food soggy, while too little leaves it dry. Measuring 0.375 cup of BBQ sauce as 3 ounces ensures consistency. This is especially important for recipes like sticky ribs or glazed chicken found on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>our recipe page</a>.</p>  

<p>Using a kitchen scale for liquids like BBQ sauce improves accuracy. Cups can vary based on how you fill them, but ounces provide a reliable standard. If you’re prepping multiple dishes, precise measurements save time and reduce waste. For meal prep ideas, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/meal-prep>meal prep category</a>.</p>  

<h2>How to measure 0.375 cup of BBQ sauce without a scale</h2>  
<p>If you don’t have a scale, use measuring spoons to approximate 0.375 cup. Since 1 cup is 8 ounces, 0.375 cup is 3 ounces or 6 tablespoons. This method works well for small batches, like marinating shrimp from our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/shrimp>shrimp recipes</a>.</p>  

<h3>Common mistakes when converting cups to ounces</h3>  
<p>Many people forget that BBQ sauce’s thickness affects volume-to-weight conversions. Thicker sauces may weigh slightly more per cup. Always level off your measuring cup for accuracy. For sticky sauces, lightly grease the cup first to ensure easy pouring.</p>  

<h2>Best air fryer recipes using 0.375 cup BBQ sauce</h2>  
<p>This measurement is perfect for glazing a pound of chicken wings or ribs. Try our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>air fryer chicken recipes</a> for crowd-pleasing dishes. The 3-ounce portion coats evenly without overpowering the meat’s natural flavours.</p>  

<p>For vegetarian options, 0.375 cup BBQ sauce works well with tofu or mushrooms. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/tofu>tofu recipes</a> for inspiration. The key is distributing the sauce evenly during cooking for maximum flavour.</p>  

<h3>Cleaning tips after using BBQ sauce in your air fryer</h3>  
<p>BBQ sauce can caramelise and stick to your air fryer basket. Always wipe excess sauce before cooking, and clean promptly afterwards. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning guide</a> has simple methods to remove stubborn sauce residue.</p>

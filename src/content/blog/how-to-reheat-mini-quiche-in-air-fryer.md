<h2>Why Use an Air Fryer to Reheat Mini Quiche?</h2>

Unlike a microwave, which can make the pastry soggy, the air fryer restores that freshly baked texture.

<h3>Best Temperature for Reheating Mini Quiche</h3>  
<p>160°C (320°F) is the sweet spot for reheating mini quiche in an air fryer. This temperature warms the filling thoroughly without burning the pastry. If your air fryer doesn’t have precise temperature control, use the medium setting. Avoid higher temps, as they can dry out the quiche.

<h2>Step-by-Step Guide to Reheating Mini Quiche</h2>  
<p>Start by preheating your air fryer to 160°C (320°F). Place the mini quiche in the basket in a single layer, leaving space between each for even airflow. Reheat for 3 minutes, then check for crispiness. If needed, add another 1–2 minutes. For frozen mini quiche, extend the time to 5–7 minutes.</p>  

<p>If you’re reheating multiple batches, keep the cooked quiche warm in a low oven. Avoid overcrowding the basket, as this leads to uneven heating. For extra crispiness, lightly spritz the pastry with oil before reheating. Need cleaning tips?

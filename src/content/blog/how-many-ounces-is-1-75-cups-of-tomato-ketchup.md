<p>1.75 cups of tomato ketchup equals approximately 14 ounces. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements can make or break a dish. Whether you’re making glazes, marinades, or dipping sauces, knowing the exact weight ensures consistency. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we focus on delivering accurate conversions to help you achieve perfect results every time.</p>

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>
<p>Air fryers rely on precise ingredient ratios to ensure even cooking and optimal texture. Too much or too little tomato ketchup can alter the moisture balance, affecting crispiness. For example, a glaze with 1.75 cups of tomato ketchup (14 ounces) will coat chicken wings evenly, creating that sticky, caramelised finish. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipes</a> section for more inspiration on perfecting your air fryer dishes.</p>

<p>Many air fryer recipes call for tomato ketchup as a base for sauces or marinades. Whether you’re making BBQ ribs or sweet and sour tofu, the 1.75 cups to ounces conversion ensures you’re using the right amount. This precision is especially important when scaling recipes up or down. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> can help with other common measurements too.</p>

<h3>How to measure 1.75 cups of tomato ketchup accurately</h3>
<p>Using a liquid measuring cup is the easiest way to measure 1.75 cups of tomato ketchup. For sticky ingredients like ketchup, lightly greasing the cup can help it slide out cleanly. If you don’t have measuring cups, a kitchen scale set to ounces will give you the exact 14-ounce equivalent. This method is particularly useful for <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/meal-prep>meal prep</a>, where consistency is key.</p>

<h2>Common uses for 1.75 cups of tomato ketchup in air fryer recipes</h2>
<p>Tomato ketchup is a versatile ingredient in air fryer cooking. A 1.75-cup (14-ounce) quantity is perfect for making large batches of BBQ sauce, meatloaf glaze, or even as a base for homemade ketchup. For example, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipes</a> often use this amount to create sticky, finger-licking coatings. The sweetness and acidity of ketchup also help tenderise meats while adding depth of flavour.</p>

<p>If you’re cooking for a crowd, 1.75 cups of tomato ketchup can be stretched across multiple dishes. Mix it with spices for a quick marinade or dilute it slightly for a dipping sauce. After cooking, don’t forget to check our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner</a> guide to keep your appliance in top condition despite sticky ketchup residues.</p>

<h3>Adjusting recipes that call for 1.75 cups of tomato ketchup</h3>
<p>Some recipes may need slight adjustments based on your preferred consistency. If a sauce seems too thick when using 1.75 cups (14 ounces) of tomato ketchup, add a tablespoon of water at a time until desired texture is achieved. Conversely, if it’s too runny, simmering it in the air fryer for a few extra minutes can help reduce and concentrate the flavours. This flexibility makes tomato ketchup a staple in air fryer cooking.</p>

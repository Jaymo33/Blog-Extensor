<p>150 grams of brown sugar equals approximately 5.29 ounces. This conversion is essential for anyone using an air fryer to bake or cook, ensuring precise measurements for perfect results. Whether you're making cookies, cakes, or glazes, knowing how to convert grams to ounces can make all the difference. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we understand the importance of accuracy in recipes, especially when using an air fryer where measurements can affect cooking times and textures.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Recipes</h2>  
<p>Using the correct amount of brown sugar ensures your air fryer recipes turn out just right. Too much sugar can cause burning or uneven cooking, while too little might leave your dish lacking in flavour. Brown sugar, in particular, adds moisture and depth to baked goods, so getting the measurement spot-on is crucial.

<p>Many UK recipes use grams, while others rely on ounces, so knowing how to switch between the two is a handy skill. If you're working with a recipe from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>our collection</a>, this conversion will help you adapt measurements effortlessly.

<h3>How to Measure Brown Sugar Correctly</h3>  
<p>Brown sugar should be packed firmly into your measuring cup or spoon for accuracy. Unlike granulated sugar, it tends to clump, so pressing it down ensures you get the right amount. If you're using scales, simply weigh out 150g, which is equivalent to 5.29 ounces. For more precision, digital kitchen scales are a great investment for air fryer cooking.</p>

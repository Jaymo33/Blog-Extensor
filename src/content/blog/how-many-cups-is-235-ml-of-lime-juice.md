<p>235 ml of lime juice is approximately 1 cup, but precise measurements can vary slightly depending on the cup standard used. Whether you're baking a zesty lime cake or marinating chicken for the air fryer, getting the conversion right ensures your dish turns out perfectly. This guide breaks down the exact conversion and offers tips for measuring lime juice accurately in your kitchen.</p>  

<h2>Understanding the Conversion: 235 ml to Cups</h2>  
<p>In the UK, 1 metric cup equals 250 ml, meaning 235 ml of lime juice is just under 1 cup (about 0.94 cups). However, in the US, where 1 cup is 240 ml, 235 ml is roughly 0.98 cups—almost a full cup. For most recipes, this small difference won’t drastically affect the outcome, but precision matters in baking. If you're using an air fryer, consistent measurements ensure even cooking and perfect textures.</p>  

<p>For air fryer recipes, especially those involving marinades or glazes, exact lime juice measurements can enhance flavour balance. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for other common ingredient conversions. Whether you're making lime-infused shrimp or a citrusy dessert, knowing how to measure lime juice correctly saves time and avoids mishaps.</p>  

<h3>Why Lime Juice Measurements Matter</h3>  
<p>Lime juice adds acidity and brightness to dishes, but too much or too little can throw off flavours. In air fryer cooking, marinades with lime juice help tenderise meats like chicken or shrimp. For example, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>lime-marinated air fryer chicken</a> relies on the right balance of citrus to achieve the perfect tang. Measuring 235 ml of lime juice accurately ensures your marinade isn’t overly sour or bland.</p>  

<h2>How to Measure 235 ml of Lime Juice Without a Scale</h2>  
<p>If you don’t have a measuring jug, use a standard metric cup (250 ml) and fill it just below the rim for 235 ml. Alternatively, 16 UK tablespoons equal roughly 235 ml, though this method is less precise. For air fryer recipes, we recommend using liquid measuring cups for accuracy, especially when working with sticky or dense ingredients like lime juice.</p>  

<p>Another tip is to use freshly squeezed lime juice for the best flavour. About 4–5 medium limes yield 235 ml of juice. If you’re using bottled lime juice, check the label—some brands contain additives that alter the taste.

<h3>Common Recipes Using 235 ml of Lime Juice</h3>  
<p>From ceviche to key lime pie, 235 ml of lime juice is a versatile quantity. In air fryer cooking, it’s ideal for glazes, such as a lime-honey drizzle for salmon or a spicy lime coating for wings.

<h2>Adjusting Recipes for Different Cup Standards</h2>  
<p>If a recipe calls for 1 cup of lime juice (250 ml in the UK or 240 ml in the US), 235 ml is close enough for most dishes. However, for delicate desserts like lime cheesecake, consider adjusting slightly. Adding an extra 5–10 ml (about 1–2 teaspoons) can make up the difference without overpowering the dish. Always taste as you go when tweaking measurements.</p>

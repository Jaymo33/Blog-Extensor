<h3>How to Measure 260 ml of Tomato Sauce Without a Scale</h3>

<h2>Common Recipes Using 260 ml of Tomato Sauce</h2>

This quantity is perfect for coating ingredients without overwhelming them. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipes</a> for saucy ideas.

<h3>Does Tomato Sauce Thickness Affect the Measurement?</h3>  
<p>Thicker sauces like passata may settle differently in a cup compared to runny sauces. For 260 ml of thick tomato sauce, lightly stir it first for an accurate measure. Air fryer recipes often specify sauce consistency, so adjust as needed. Visit <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> for recipes tailored to your air fryer model. A slight variance won’t ruin your dish, but precision helps.</p>

<p>285 ml of oat milk equals approximately 1.2 cups in the UK and 1.2 cups in the US. This measurement is essential for baking, cooking, or even making your morning coffee in an air fryer-friendly recipe. Whether you're following a recipe from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> or converting a family favourite, knowing this conversion ensures accuracy.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of oat milk can make or break a recipe. Too much liquid can lead to soggy cakes or runny sauces, while too little might dry out your dish. For air fryer recipes, precision is key, as the cooking process is faster and more intense. If you're whipping up a batch of <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>air fryer cakes</a>, 285 ml of oat milk ensures the perfect texture.</p>  

<p>Oat milk is a popular dairy-free alternative, but its consistency can vary by brand. Measuring 285 ml of oat milk correctly ensures your recipes turn out just right. Whether you're making pancakes, custards, or even a creamy pasta sauce, this conversion is a handy reference.</p>  

<h3>UK vs. US Cup Measurements</h3>  
<p>While 285 ml of oat milk is roughly 1.2 cups in both the UK and US, slight variations exist due to different cup sizes. A UK cup holds 284 ml, while a US cup is 240 ml. For most recipes, the difference is negligible, but for precision baking, it's worth noting. Check <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>our conversion chart</a> for more details.</p>  

<h2>How to Measure 285 ml of Oat Milk Without a Scale</h2>  
<p>If you don't have a measuring jug, you can use standard cups to measure 285 ml of oat milk. A UK metric cup (250 ml) plus a tablespoon (15 ml) will get you close. Alternatively, use a US cup (240 ml) and add an extra tablespoon and a half. This method works well for recipes like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/breakfast>air fryer breakfasts</a> where slight variations won't ruin the dish.</p>  

<p>For those who prefer visual cues, 285 ml of oat milk fills a standard mug about halfway. This is handy for quick recipes or when you're in a rush. Just remember, eyeballing isn't ideal for baking, where precision matters most.</p>  

<h3>Common Recipes Using 285 ml of Oat Milk</h3>

It's also great for smoothies or overnight oats.</p>  

<h2>Converting Other Liquid Measurements</h2>

Whether you’re making a creamy pasta or a custard, accurate ml measurements guarantee success.</p>  

<p>Single cream is thinner than double cream, so its volume-to-weight ratio differs slightly. This makes conversions like 2.75 cups to ml especially useful for air fryer recipes.

<h3>How to Measure Single Cream Without a Measuring Cup</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a measuring cup, use a kitchen scale: 1 ml of single cream weighs roughly 1 gram, so 650 ml equals about 650 grams. Alternatively, a standard UK tablespoon holds 15 ml, meaning 2.75 cups is roughly 43 tablespoons. For air fryer recipes, consistency matters, so avoid eyeballing measurements. Need more tips?

Try it in a mushroom stroganoff or a silky caramel flan—both work brilliantly in an air fryer. The 650 ml measurement ensures your dish has just the right creaminess.</p>  

<p>For baking, 2.75 cups of single cream can be used in sponges, scones, or even air-fried doughnuts. Its lower fat content compared to double cream makes it a lighter option.

<h3>UK vs. US Cup Measurements for Single Cream</h3>

Always clarify which cup measurement your recipe uses. For air fryer cooking, sticking to one system avoids mishaps.

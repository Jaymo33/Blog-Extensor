<p>1.66 cups of sweet chilli sauce equals approximately 13.28 ounces. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes that require precise measurements to achieve the perfect balance of flavours. Whether you're marinating chicken, glazing shrimp, or adding a kick to vegetables, knowing the exact weight ensures consistent results every time.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on even cooking, and incorrect measurements can throw off the texture and taste of your dish. Too much sauce can make food soggy, while too little might leave it dry. Sweet chilli sauce, with its sticky consistency, needs careful measuring to avoid mess and ensure even coating. For more air fryer tips, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>  

<p>Using 1.66 cups of sweet chilli sauce in ounces (13.28 oz) helps standardise recipes, especially when scaling up or down. This is particularly useful for meal preppers or those cooking for larger groups. If you're experimenting with new dishes, precise measurements ensure your creations turn out just right.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure Sweet Chilli Sauce Correctly</h3>  
<p>For the most accurate conversion, use a liquid measuring cup for the 1.66 cups and a kitchen scale for the ounces. Sweet chilli sauce is thick, so levelling it off with a spatula ensures you don’t over-pour. If you don’t have a scale, remember that 1 cup equals roughly 8 ounces, making 1.66 cups about 13.28 ounces.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for Sweet Chilli Sauce in Air Fryers</h2>  
<p>Sweet chilli sauce is a versatile ingredient that works wonders in air fryers. From glazing chicken wings to tossing with shrimp or even drizzling over roasted vegetables, it adds a sweet and spicy kick. For recipe inspiration, browse our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> collection.</p>  

<p>When using 1.66 cups (13.28 oz) of sweet chilli sauce, consider marinating proteins like chicken or tofu for at least 30 minutes before air frying. This allows the flavours to penetrate deeply. Alternatively, brush it on during the last few minutes of cooking for a glossy, caramelised finish.</p>  

<h3>Converting Other Sweet Chilli Sauce Measurements</h3>  
<p>If your recipe calls for a different amount, here’s a quick reference: 1 cup = 8 oz, 0.5 cup = 4 oz, and 2 cups = 16 oz. This makes scaling recipes simple, whether you’re cooking for one or a crowd. For more conversions, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a> has you covered.</p>  

<h2>Cleaning Your Air Fryer After Using Sweet Chilli Sauce</h2>  
<p>Sweet chilli sauce can be sticky and may leave residue in your air fryer basket. To keep it in top condition, wipe down the basket immediately after use with warm, soapy water. For tougher stains, check out our guide on the <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>best air fryer cleaners</a>.</p>  

<p>Regular maintenance ensures your air fryer performs optimally and extends its lifespan. Since sweet chilli sauce contains sugar, it can caramelise and harden if left unattended. A quick clean after each use prevents buildup and keeps your machine running smoothly.</p>  

<h3>Storing Leftover Sweet Chilli Sauce</h3>  
<p>If you have leftover sauce after measuring out 1.66 cups (13.28 oz), store it in an airtight container in the fridge. It typically lasts up to a month, though always check for signs of spoilage.

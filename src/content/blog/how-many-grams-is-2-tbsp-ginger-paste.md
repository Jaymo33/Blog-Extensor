<p>2 tablespoons (tbsp) of ginger paste equals approximately 30 grams (g). This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements can make or break your dish. Whether you're marinating chicken, spicing up vegetables, or preparing a fragrant curry, knowing the exact weight ensures consistent results. For more air fryer conversions, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate ginger paste measurements matter</h2>  
<p>Ginger paste adds a punch of flavour to dishes, but too much or too little can throw off your recipe. In an air fryer, where cooking times are shorter, balanced flavours are crucial. A precise 30g of ginger paste for every 2 tbsp ensures your marinades, sauces, and rubs are spot-on. If you're prepping a <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken dish</a>, this accuracy guarantees the perfect spice level.</p>  

<p>Many air fryer recipes rely on ginger paste for its convenience and intense flavour. Unlike fresh ginger, which requires grating, the paste blends seamlessly into mixes. Whether you're making a quick stir-fry or a slow-cooked curry, 30g of ginger paste per 2 tbsp keeps things simple. Visit <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> for more tips on perfecting your air fryer meals.</p>  

<h2>How to measure ginger paste correctly</h2>  
<p>Using a kitchen scale is the most accurate way to measure 30g of ginger paste. If you don’t have one, levelling off your tablespoons ensures consistency. Scoop the paste into the spoon and scrape off the excess with a straight edge. This method works well for sticky ingredients like ginger paste, ensuring you don’t over-measure.</p>  

<h3>Converting other ginger paste quantities</h3>  
<p>If your recipe calls for more or less ginger paste, here’s a quick guide: 1 tbsp equals about 15g, while 3 tbsp would be roughly 45g. These conversions are handy for scaling recipes up or down. For more air fryer-friendly measurements, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a>.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for ginger paste in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Ginger paste is a staple in many air fryer recipes, from marinades to glazes. Its concentrated flavour works wonders on proteins like chicken, beef, or tofu. A 30g (2 tbsp) portion is ideal for coating 500g of meat or vegetables evenly. Try it in a <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable stir-fry</a> for an extra kick.</p>  

<p>Beyond savoury dishes, ginger paste can enhance desserts like ginger cookies or cakes. The key is measuring accurately—30g per 2 tbsp—to avoid overpowering other flavours.

<h2>Why Accurate Semolina Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Semolina is a versatile ingredient used in everything from pasta to desserts. Measuring it correctly ensures your dishes have the right texture and consistency.

<p>Using 0.375 cup of semolina in ounces (1.5 oz) is particularly useful for small batches. This measurement is common in UK recipes, so knowing the conversion saves time. If you're scaling up or down, precise weights prevent mishaps. Semolina's density can vary slightly, so weighing it removes guesswork.

<h3>How to Measure Semolina Without Scales</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a kitchen scale, measuring cups are a reliable alternative. Spoon the semolina into the cup and level it off for accuracy.

This method ensures you get close to the 1.5-ounce mark without scales.</p>

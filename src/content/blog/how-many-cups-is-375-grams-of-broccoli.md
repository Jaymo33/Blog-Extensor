<p>375 grams of broccoli is roughly equivalent to 4.5 to 5 cups when chopped. This measurement can vary slightly depending on how finely the broccoli is cut, but it’s a reliable starting point for air fryer recipes. Whether you’re prepping a veggie stir-fry or roasting florets, knowing this conversion ensures consistent results every time.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter for Air Fryer Cooking</h2>
<p>Getting the right amount of broccoli is crucial for even cooking in your air fryer. Too much can lead to steaming instead of crisping, while too little might dry out. Using 375 grams of broccoli (about 4.5 to 5 cups) ensures the perfect balance for most recipes.

<p>Broccoli’s density changes based on whether it’s raw, cooked, or frozen. Raw chopped broccoli fills more volume per gram compared to cooked, which shrinks. If you’re adapting a recipe from grams to cups, always note the broccoli’s state.

<h3>How to Measure 375 Grams of Broccoli Without a Scale</h3>
<p>No scale? No problem. A standard US cup holds about 90 grams of chopped raw broccoli, so 375 grams would be just over 4 cups. For UK cup measurements (which are slightly larger at 250ml), it’s closer to 3.5 cups. Pack the broccoli lightly—don’t press it down—for the most accurate result.</p>

<h2>Adjusting Recipes for 375 Grams of Broccoli</h2>
<p>Many air fryer recipes call for 375 grams of broccoli, a common portion for 2–3 servings. If your recipe lists cups instead, now you know the conversion. Try our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable recipes</a> for inspiration, like crispy garlic broccoli or cheesy florets.</p>
<p>Remember that air fryer baskets vary in size. If yours is smaller, split 375 grams (about 5 cups) into batches to avoid overcrowding. Overcrowding leads to uneven cooking, a common issue with dense veggies like broccoli.

<h3>Does Chopped vs. Florets Affect the Cup Measurement?</h3>
<p>Yes! Chopped broccoli packs more tightly into a cup than whole florets. For 375 grams, you’ll need about 4 cups of florets versus 4.5 cups of chopped. If precision matters (like for baking), weigh the broccoli instead. For quick meals, the cup approximation works fine.</p>

<h2>Common Uses for 375 Grams of Broccoli in Air Fryers</h2>
<p>This amount is perfect for sides, like roasted broccoli with parmesan, or mains like stir-fries. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we love recipes that use 375 grams efficiently—try our buffalo broccoli bites or lemon-pepper florets.</p>
<p>Broccoli’s versatility shines in air fryers: it crisps beautifully at 190°C for 10–12 minutes. Toss 375 grams (4.5–5 cups) with oil and seasoning for a foolproof side. Leftovers? Store them airtight for up to 3 days—they reheat wonderfully in the air fryer.</p>

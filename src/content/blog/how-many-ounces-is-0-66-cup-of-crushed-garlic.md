<p>0.66 cup of crushed garlic equals approximately 3.17 ounces (90 grams). This measurement is essential for air fryer recipes, ensuring your dishes have the perfect garlic flavour without overpowering them. Whether you're making garlic bread, roasted vegetables, or marinades, knowing this conversion helps streamline your cooking process.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Garlic Measurements Matter in Air Fryers</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of crushed garlic ensures your air fryer dishes are flavourful but not overwhelming. Too much garlic can dominate other ingredients, while too little might leave your dish tasting bland. For recipes like garlic butter shrimp or crispy garlic potatoes, precision is key. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more handy measurement tips.</p>  

<p>Garlic’s potency varies depending on how it’s prepared—minced, crushed, or powdered. Crushed garlic tends to be denser, so 0.66 cup translates to roughly 3.17 ounces. If you’re adapting a recipe from cups to weight, this conversion ensures consistency. For more recipe ideas, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipe collection</a>.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure Crushed Garlic Correctly</h3>  
<p>For the most accurate measurement, lightly pack the crushed garlic into a measuring cup without pressing too hard. Overpacking can lead to more garlic than needed, altering the dish’s taste. If you prefer weight measurements, a kitchen scale is your best friend—simply weigh out 3.17 ounces for 0.66 cup.</p>  

<h2>Common Recipes Using 0.66 Cup Crushed Garlic</h2>  
<p>Many air fryer recipes call for crushed garlic, especially in marinades and rubs. Dishes like garlic butter chicken or roasted garlic mushrooms often use this quantity. If you love bold flavours, try our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>garlic chicken recipes</a> for a delicious meal.</p>  

<p>Garlic also pairs well with vegetables. Tossing 0.66 cup (3.17 oz) of crushed garlic with broccoli or Brussels sprouts before air frying enhances their natural flavours. For more veggie inspiration, browse our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable air fryer recipes</a>.</p>  

<h3>Adjusting Garlic Quantities for Personal Taste</h3>  
<p>If you prefer milder or stronger garlic flavours, you can adjust the amount slightly. Start with 2.5 ounces (about 0.5 cup) for a subtler taste or go up to 4 ounces (0.8 cup) for an intense kick. Always taste as you cook to find your perfect balance.</p>  

<h2>Cleaning Your Air Fryer After Garlic-Heavy Recipes</h2>  
<p>Garlic leaves a strong aroma, so cleaning your air fryer promptly is crucial. Wipe down the basket and interior with warm, soapy water, and use our recommended <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner</a> for stubborn residues. Regular maintenance keeps your appliance fresh and ready for the next recipe.</p>  

<p>Storing crushed garlic properly also matters. Keep unused portions in an airtight container in the fridge for up to a week, or freeze them for longer storage. This ensures you always have garlic on hand for quick air fryer meals.</p>

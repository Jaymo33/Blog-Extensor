<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of evaporated milk can make or break your dish. Too little, and your recipe might lack creaminess; too much, and it could become overly dense. Air fryers cook quickly, so precise measurements ensure even cooking. If you’re whipping up a <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert</a>, 591.47 ml of evaporated milk will give you the perfect texture. Always measure liquids in a clear jug for accuracy.</p>  

<p>Evaporated milk is thicker than regular milk, so ml conversions are especially useful. Unlike water, its density means volume and weight aren’t interchangeable. For air fryer recipes like custards or creamy sauces, 2.5 cups (591.47 ml) delivers consistent results. Need more inspiration? Browse our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a> for ideas.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure Evaporated Milk Correctly</h3>  
<p>Use a liquid measuring cup for the most accurate results. Pour the evaporated milk to the 591.47 ml mark, or fill to 2.5 cups if your jug has cup measurements. Avoid using dry measuring cups, as they can lead to errors. For sticky ingredients like evaporated milk, lightly grease the measuring cup for easy pouring.</p>  

<h2>Common Recipes Using 2.5 Cups of Evaporated Milk</h2>  
<p>Many air fryer recipes call for this exact measurement. Creamy mac and cheese, flans, and even <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>cakes</a> often require 591.47 ml of evaporated milk. Its rich texture enhances flavour without adding excess moisture. If you’re adapting a stovetop recipe for the air fryer, this conversion ensures success.</p>

<h3>UK vs. US Cup Measurements</h3>  
<p>In the UK, 1 cup equals 284 ml, while in the US, it’s 236.59 ml. However, for evaporated milk, 2.5 cups universally convert to 591.47 ml. Always check your recipe’s origin to avoid confusion. Most modern recipes specify ml for clarity, especially in air fryer cooking.</p>  

<h2>Tips for Substituting Evaporated Milk</h2>  
<p>If you’re out of evaporated milk, you can make a substitute with regular milk. Simmer 591.47 ml of whole milk until it reduces by half. This mimics evaporated milk’s thickness. For air fryer recipes, this swap works well in <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable gratins</a> or sauces. Just avoid using skim milk, as it won’t provide the same richness.</p>  

<p>Another option is using coconut milk for a dairy-free alternative. Replace 591.47 ml of evaporated milk with an equal amount of full-fat coconut milk. The flavour will differ slightly, but the texture remains creamy. Experiment with different substitutes to find your favourite.</p>

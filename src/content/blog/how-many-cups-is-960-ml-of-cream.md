<p>960 ml of cream equals approximately 4.06 cups in the UK or 4.23 cups in the US. This conversion is essential for recipes requiring precise measurements, especially when using an air fryer for baking or cooking creamy dishes. Whether you're making a rich dessert or a savoury sauce, knowing how to convert millilitres to cups ensures perfect results every time.</p>

<h2>Understanding Cream Measurements</h2>  
<p>When working with cream in recipes, accuracy matters. Cream has a different density compared to water, but for most cooking purposes, the standard liquid conversion applies. In the UK, 1 cup equals 250 ml, while in the US, 1 cup is 240 ml. This slight difference means 960 ml of cream converts to roughly 4.06 UK cups or 4.23 US cups.</p>  
<p>For air fryer recipes, precise measurements help maintain consistency. Whether you're making a creamy pasta bake or a decadent cheesecake, knowing how much cream to use ensures the right texture and flavour.

<h2>Why Accurate Cream Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Using the correct amount of cream can make or break a dish. Too little, and your sauce might be too thick; too much, and it could become runny. This is especially important in air fryer cooking, where even heat distribution relies on balanced ingredients. For example, a creamy mushroom sauce requires just the right ratio of cream to other liquids.</p>  
<p>If you're experimenting with new recipes, always measure your cream carefully. A digital kitchen scale can help, but if you're using cups, remember the UK and US differences.

<p>635 ml of double cream is approximately 2.68 cups. This conversion is essential for recipes, especially when using an air fryer, where precise measurements can make all the difference. Whether you're whipping up a dessert or preparing a creamy sauce, knowing how to convert ml to cups ensures your dish turns out perfectly every time.</p>

<h2>Understanding the Conversion</h2>  
<p>Converting millilitres to cups can be tricky, especially with ingredients like double cream, which has a different density than water. For most liquid measurements, 1 cup equals 237 ml, but double cream is slightly thicker. That's why 635 ml of double cream translates to roughly 2.68 cups. This measurement is particularly useful for air fryer recipes, where consistency matters.</p>  

<p>If you're working with a recipe from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, you'll often find measurements in both ml and cups. Having a reliable conversion chart, like the one on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>our conversion page</a>, can save time and ensure accuracy. Double cream is a staple in many desserts, so getting the measurement right is key.</p>  

<h3>Why Accuracy Matters in Air Fryer Cooking</h3>  
<p>Air fryers rely on even heat distribution, and incorrect measurements can throw off the texture of your dish. Too much double cream might make a sauce too runny, while too little could leave it dry. For perfect results, always measure carefully. If you're unsure, check our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning guide</a> to ensure your air fryer is in top condition for cooking.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for 635 ml of Double Cream</h2>  
<p>Double cream is versatile, and 635 ml (or 2.68 cups) is a common quantity in many recipes. From rich desserts like custards and mousses to savoury dishes like creamy pasta sauces, this measurement pops up frequently. If you're exploring <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert recipes</a>, you'll likely encounter this amount.</p>  

<p>For air fryer users, double cream can be used in batters or as a topping. Whether you're making a quick cake or a decadent dip, knowing how much 635 ml translates to in cups ensures consistency. If you're meal prepping, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/meal-prep>meal prep section</a> for ideas.</p>  

<h3>Tips for Measuring Double Cream</h3>

If your recipe calls for 635 ml, you can confidently use 2.68 cups instead. For more air fryer tips, visit <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>.</p>

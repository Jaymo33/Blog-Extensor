<p>635 ml of double cream is approximately 2.68 cups. This conversion is essential for recipes, especially when using an air fryer, where precise measurements can make all the difference. Whether you're whipping up a dessert or preparing a creamy sauce, knowing how to convert ml to cups ensures your dish turns out perfectly every time.</p>

<h2>Understanding the Conversion</h2>  
<p>Converting millilitres to cups can be tricky, especially with ingredients like double cream, which has a different density than water. For most liquid measurements, 1 cup equals 237 ml, but double cream is slightly thicker. That's why 635 ml of double cream translates to roughly 2.68 cups. This measurement is particularly useful for air fryer recipes, where consistency matters.</p>

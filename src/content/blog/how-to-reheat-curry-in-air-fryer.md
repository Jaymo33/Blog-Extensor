<p>Reheating curry in an air fryer takes just 3-5 minutes at 160°C, giving it a crispy edge while keeping the centre moist. This method beats microwaving, which often leaves curries soggy or unevenly heated. Whether it’s a creamy korma or a spicy vindaloo, your air fryer can revive leftovers like a pro.

<h2>Why Use an Air Fryer for Reheating Curry?</h2>
<p>Air fryers circulate hot air to reheat food evenly, avoiding the cold spots microwaves create. This makes them ideal for curries with thicker sauces or chunks of meat. The rapid airflow also adds a slight crispiness to the edges, enhancing texture. Unlike oven reheating, air fryers don’t dry out dishes if you follow the right settings. Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a> for more inspiration.</p>

<p>Curries with rice or naan can be reheated together, but layer them properly to prevent sogginess. Place proteins or vegetables at the bottom, with rice on top to catch excess moisture. For saucier curries like tikka masala, a light stir halfway through ensures even heating. Always use oven-safe containers or foil to avoid spills in your air fryer basket.</p>

<h3>Ideal Temperature and Timing</h3>
<p>Set your air fryer to 160°C for most curries, adjusting slightly for thicker or creamier sauces. Denser dishes like lamb rogan josh may need 5 minutes, while lighter vegetable curries often take just 3. Check our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a> if your model uses Fahrenheit. Stirring halfway prevents hotspots and ensures even crispiness.</p>

<h2>Step-by-Step Reheating Guide</h2>
<p>Start by letting refrigerated curry sit at room temperature for 10 minutes to reduce reheating time. Lightly spray the air fryer basket with oil to prevent sticking, especially for drier curries like jalfrezi. Spread the curry in an even layer, leaving space for air circulation. Avoid overcrowding to achieve that perfect balance of crispy and tender.</p>

<p>For curries with toppings like paneer or fried onions, add them in the last minute to preserve texture. If reheating rice alongside, sprinkle a teaspoon of water to prevent drying out. Always use a meat thermometer to ensure reheated chicken or lamb reaches 75°C internally.

<h3>Pro Tips for Perfect Results</h3>
<p>Add a splash of coconut milk or broth before reheating creamy curries to maintain moisture. For extra crispiness, brush naan or roti with ghee and air fry separately for 1-2 minutes.

<p>1 cup of sweet chilli sauce equals approximately 8.5 ounces (240 grams) in the UK. This measurement is essential for air fryer recipes, ensuring your dishes have the perfect balance of flavour. Whether you’re making glazed chicken wings or dipping sauces, knowing the exact weight helps avoid guesswork. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we provide precise conversions to make cooking effortless. Keep reading for more details on measuring sweet chilli sauce and other handy tips.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on precise ingredient ratios to achieve crispy, evenly cooked results. Using too much or too little sweet chilli sauce can affect texture and taste. For example, marinating chicken with 1 cup of sweet chilli sauce (8.5 oz) ensures a sticky, caramelised finish. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for other common measurements. Accurate weighing also helps when scaling recipes up or down for meal prep.</p>  

<p>Sweet chilli sauce is a versatile ingredient in air fryer cooking, perfect for glazes, dips, and marinades. Whether you’re making crispy tofu or shrimp skewers, the right amount ensures balanced sweetness and heat. Visit our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipes section</a> for inspiration. Measuring by weight (ounces) is more reliable than volume (cups), especially for thick sauces. A kitchen scale is a must-have tool for air fryer enthusiasts.</p>  

<h3>How to measure sweet chilli sauce without a scale</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a scale, use a liquid measuring cup for sweet chilli sauce. Fill it to the 1-cup mark, ensuring the sauce settles evenly. For thicker sauces, gently tap the cup to remove air pockets. Remember, 1 cup equals 8.5 oz, but slight variations can occur based on brand and density. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipe category</a> features dishes that often use this measurement.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for 1 cup of sweet chilli sauce</h2>  
<p>One cup (8.5 oz) of sweet chilli sauce is ideal for marinating 4-6 chicken thighs or wings in the air fryer. It’s also enough for a batch of dipping sauce for spring rolls or crispy tofu. For seafood lovers, try glazing salmon fillets with this amount. Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/shrimp>shrimp recipes</a> for more ideas. The sauce’s sticky consistency helps coatings adhere better during air frying.</p>  

<p>Sweet chilli sauce can also be mixed with other ingredients for versatility. Combine 1 cup (8.5 oz) with soy sauce and garlic for a savoury-sweet marinade. Alternatively, dilute it with a bit of water for a lighter glaze. Cleaning your air fryer after saucy recipes?

<h3>Converting other sweet chilli sauce amounts</h3>  
<p>Need half a cup? That’s 4.25 oz. A quarter cup is roughly 2.1 oz. These smaller quantities work well for single servings or light coatings. For larger batches, double the measurements accordingly. Sweet chilli sauce is a staple in many <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable recipes</a>, adding a kick to roasted veggies. Always measure carefully to avoid overpowering other flavours.</p>

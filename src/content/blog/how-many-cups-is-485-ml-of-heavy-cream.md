<p>485 ml of heavy cream equals approximately 2.05 cups. This conversion is essential for precise baking and cooking, especially when using an air fryer where measurements matter. Whether you're making a rich dessert or a creamy sauce, knowing how to convert millilitres to cups ensures perfect results every time.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>When working with heavy cream, even small measurement errors can affect texture and consistency. Air fryer recipes, like those on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes</a>, often require exact quantities for best results. Too much cream can make dishes overly rich, while too little may leave them dry. Measuring 485 ml of heavy cream correctly ensures your recipes turn out just right.</p>  

<p>Heavy cream is a staple in many dishes, from desserts to savoury sauces. If you're preparing a cake or a creamy pasta in your air fryer, knowing that 485 ml equals roughly 2.05 cups helps streamline the process. For more conversion tips, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air-fryer-conversion-chart</a>.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure 485 ml of Heavy Cream</h3>  
<p>Using a liquid measuring cup is the easiest way to measure 485 ml of heavy cream. Fill the cup to the 2-cup mark, then add an extra teaspoon to account for the 0.05 difference. If you don’t have a measuring cup, a kitchen scale set to grams (485 ml ≈ 485g for heavy cream) works too.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for 485 ml of Heavy Cream</h2>  
<p>This quantity is perfect for whipping up desserts like mousses or custards in your air fryer. It’s also ideal for creamy pasta sauces or soups. If you're exploring new recipes, <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert</a> has plenty of inspiration.</p>  

<p>Heavy cream adds richness to dishes, and 485 ml is a common measurement in many recipes. Whether you're baking or cooking, this amount ensures balanced flavours.

<h3>Converting Other Cream Measurements</h3>  
<p>If your recipe calls for a different amount, remember that 1 cup equals roughly 237 ml. This makes scaling recipes up or down simple. For example, 250 ml is about 1.06 cups, while 500 ml is roughly 2.11 cups.</p>  

<h2>Tips for Working with Heavy Cream</h2>  
<p>Always use cold heavy cream for whipping, as it holds its shape better. When substituting, full-fat coconut milk can work in some recipes, but the texture may vary. For more air fryer-friendly tips, browse <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>.</p>  

<p>Storing heavy cream properly extends its shelf life. Keep it refrigerated and use it within a few days of opening. If you’re unsure about conversions, our guide ensures you’ll never second-guess measurements again.</p>

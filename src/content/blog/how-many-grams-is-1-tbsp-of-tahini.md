<p>1 tablespoon (tbsp) of tahini weighs approximately 15 grams. This measurement is essential for precise cooking, especially when using an air fryer where ingredient ratios can affect texture and cooking times. Whether you're making dressings, dips, or marinades, knowing the exact weight ensures consistency in your dishes. For more air fryer measurement tips, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate tahini measurements matter</h2>  
<p>Tahini’s thick, paste-like consistency means volume measurements like tablespoons can vary slightly. Weighing it in grams guarantees accuracy, which is crucial for air fryer recipes where even small deviations can alter results. Too much tahini in a marinade, for example, might make it overly dense, while too little could leave flavours lacking. For perfectly balanced dishes, always measure by weight when possible. Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> for inspiration on using tahini in meals like roasted vegetables or falafel.</p>  

<h2>Converting tahini for UK recipes</h2>  
<p>In the UK, recipes often list tahini in grams rather than tablespoons. If your recipe calls for 30g of tahini, you’ll need 2 level tablespoons. Remember that tahini can settle or separate, so stir it well before measuring to ensure uniformity. For more UK-specific conversions, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion guide</a> simplifies baking and cooking in grams.</p>  

<h3>Tips for measuring tahini</h3>  
<p>Use a flat-edged knife to level off your tablespoon for the most accurate 15g measure. If your tahini is particularly thick, lightly greasing the spoon can help it slide off easily. For sticky ingredients like tahini, a digital kitchen scale is a game-changer—especially when prepping air fryer recipes where precision matters. Need to clean sticky residue? Try our recommended <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner</a>.</p>  

<h2>Using tahini in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Tahini adds richness to air-fried dishes, from drizzling over roasted chickpeas to blending into sauces. Since air fryers cook quickly, evenly measured ingredients prevent burnt or undercooked spots. For example, 15g (1 tbsp) of tahini mixed with lemon juice and garlic makes a perfect dip for air-fried pita. Discover more ways to use tahini in our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable recipe category</a>.</p>  

<h3>Common tahini substitutes</h3>  
<p>If you’re out of tahini, almond or cashew butter can work in a pinch, though their weights per tablespoon may differ slightly. Always check conversions to avoid throwing off your recipe’s balance. For nut-free alternatives, sunflower seed butter is a great option with a similar gram-to-tablespoon ratio.</p>

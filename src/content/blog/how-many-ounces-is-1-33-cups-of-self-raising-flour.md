<p>1.33 cups of self-raising flour equals approximately 5.3 ounces (150 grams). This conversion is essential for air fryer baking, where precision ensures perfect texture and rise. Whether you're making cakes, muffins, or bread, knowing the exact weight of your flour can make or break your recipe.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Flour Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Baking is a science, and self-raising flour is no exception. Too much or too little can affect the rise and texture of your baked goods. For air fryer recipes, where cooking times are shorter, precise measurements are even more critical. A slight variation can lead to undercooked or overly dense results.</p>  
<p>Using weight measurements (ounces or grams) instead of volume (cups) eliminates guesswork. A kitchen scale is your best friend here, especially for air fryer baking. If you're new to conversions, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for quick reference.</p>  

<h2>How to Measure 1.33 Cups of Self-Raising Flour</h2>  
<p>Measuring flour by volume can be tricky due to settling and packing. For the most accurate 1.33 cups to ounces conversion, fluff the flour with a spoon before lightly scooping it into your measuring cup. Level it off with a straight edge for consistency.</p>  
<p>If you're scaling a recipe, remember that 1 cup of self-raising flour weighs about 4 ounces (113 grams). So, 1.33 cups would be roughly 5.3 ounces. For more air fryer-friendly recipes, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipes section</a> for inspiration.</p>  

<h3>Common Mistakes When Measuring Flour</h3>  
<p>One of the biggest mistakes is packing flour into the measuring cup, which can add up to 25% more flour than intended. This leads to dry, dense bakes. Another error is using liquid measuring cups for dry ingredients, as they aren’t designed for leveling off.</p>  

<h2>Converting Other Flour Amounts</h2>  
<p>Need to adjust your recipe? Here’s a quick reference for other common conversions: 1 cup = 4 ounces, 0.5 cups = 2 ounces, and 2 cups = 8 ounces. For larger batches, multiply accordingly. If you're working with UK measurements, note that our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a> includes metric equivalents.</p>  
<p>Self-raising flour is a staple in many <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>cake recipes</a>, so getting the measurements right ensures a light, fluffy texture. Always sift your flour before measuring to avoid clumps and ensure even distribution in your batter.</p>  

<h3>Using Self-Raising Flour in Air Fryer Recipes</h3>  
<p>Air fryers excel at baking small batches, from muffins to scones. Since they cook faster than conventional ovens, precise measurements prevent over-drying. For best results, preheat your air fryer and lightly grease baking pans or use parchment liners.</p>  

<h2>Tips for Perfect Air Fryer Baking</h2>  
<p>Always check your air fryer’s manual for recommended baking settings. Most models work well at 160-180°C for cakes and bread. Rotate or shake the basket halfway through cooking for even browning. Keep an eye on the timer, as air fryers cook faster than traditional ovens.</p>  
<p>For easy cleanup, use our recommended <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner</a> to maintain your appliance. A well-maintained air fryer ensures consistent results and extends its lifespan. Happy baking!</p>

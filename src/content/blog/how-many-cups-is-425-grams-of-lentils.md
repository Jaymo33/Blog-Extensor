<p>425 grams of lentils is roughly equivalent to 2.1 cups, though this can vary slightly depending on the type and packing of the lentils. Whether you're using an air fryer or a traditional oven, accurate measurements are key to perfecting your dishes. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we know how crucial precise conversions are for hassle-free cooking.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter for Lentils</h2>  
<p>Getting the right amount of lentils ensures your recipes turn out just as intended. Too many lentils can make dishes dry or overly dense, while too few might leave them lacking in texture. For air fryer recipes, consistency is especially important because cooking times are shorter and more precise.

<p>Different types of lentils—such as red, green, or brown—may have slight variations in volume per gram. That’s why weighing them first is always the best approach. If you don’t have a scale, using the standard 2.1 cups for 425 grams will work in most cases.

<h3>Types of Lentils and Their Measurements</h3>  
<p>Red lentils tend to be smaller and pack more densely, meaning 425 grams might be closer to 2 cups. Green or brown lentils are slightly larger, so 425 grams could fill closer to 2.2 cups. Always fluff the lentils before measuring to avoid compacting them too much.</p>  

<h2>How to Measure Lentils Without a Scale</h2>  
<p>If you don’t have a kitchen scale, use a dry measuring cup and spoon the lentils in gently. Avoid tapping the cup, as this compresses the lentils and leads to inaccurate measurements. For best results, level off the top with a straight edge. Need more tips? Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable recipes</a> often include lentil measurements for easy reference.</p>  

<p>Another handy trick is to use a standard metric conversion: 1 cup of uncooked lentils weighs about 200 grams. So, 425 grams would be just over 2 cups. Keep in mind that cooked lentils expand, so adjust your recipes accordingly.

<h3>Converting Lentils for Air Fryer Recipes</h3>  
<p>Air fryers require precise measurements to ensure even cooking. If a recipe calls for 425 grams of lentils and you’re using cups, stick to the 2.1-cup measurement for consistency. Pre-soaking lentils can also affect volume, so always check your recipe notes.</p>

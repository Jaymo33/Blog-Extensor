<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>

<p>Sesame oil adds a rich, nutty flavour to dishes, but its density means weight-to-volume conversions aren’t always straightforward. That’s why we’ve broken it down for you.

<h2>How to measure sesame oil for air fryer recipes</h2>
<p>If you don’t have a kitchen scale, you can still measure sesame oil accurately. One fluid ounce is roughly 28.35 grams, so 150g translates to just over 5 ounces. For best results, use a liquid measuring cup with clear markings. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> simplifies these calculations for all your cooking needs.</p>
<p>When working with sesame oil in an air fryer, remember it has a low smoke point. Light sesame oil is better for frying, while toasted sesame oil is best used as a finishing touch. Either way, measuring correctly ensures your dish isn’t overwhelmed by the oil’s strong flavour.</p>

<h2>Tips for cooking with sesame oil in an air fryer</h2>
<p>Always preheat your air fryer to ensure even cooking. When using sesame oil, a little goes a long way—coat food lightly rather than drenching it. Too much oil can cause smoking or uneven browning.

<p>Store sesame oil in a cool, dark place to preserve its flavour. Over time, exposure to light and heat can make it rancid. Fresh oil has a vibrant aroma, so if yours smells off, it’s time to replace it. Proper storage ensures your 150g (or 5.29-ounce) measurements always deliver the best results.</p>

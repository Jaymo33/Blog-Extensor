<p>150g of sesame oil is approximately 5.29 ounces. Whether you're preparing a marinade, dressing, or stir-fry in your air fryer, knowing this conversion ensures your recipe turns out perfectly every time. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we understand how crucial precise measurements are for cooking success, especially when using an air fryer.</p>

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>
<p>Using the right amount of sesame oil can make or break your dish. Too little, and your food might stick or dry out; too much, and it could become greasy. Air fryers rely on even heat distribution, so precise measurements help maintain balance. For more tips on perfecting your air fryer meals, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipes section</a>.</p>
<p>Sesame oil adds a rich, nutty flavour to dishes, but its density means weight-to-volume conversions aren’t always straightforward. That’s why we’ve broken it down for you. Whether you’re making crispy tofu or marinating chicken, knowing 150g equals roughly 5.29 ounces takes the guesswork out of cooking.</p>

<h2>How to measure sesame oil for air fryer recipes</h2>
<p>If you don’t have a kitchen scale, you can still measure sesame oil accurately. One fluid ounce is roughly 28.35 grams, so 150g translates to just over 5 ounces. For best results, use a liquid measuring cup with clear markings. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> simplifies these calculations for all your cooking needs.</p>
<p>When working with sesame oil in an air fryer, remember it has a low smoke point. Light sesame oil is better for frying, while toasted sesame oil is best used as a finishing touch. Either way, measuring correctly ensures your dish isn’t overwhelmed by the oil’s strong flavour.</p>

<h3>Common uses for sesame oil in air fryer cooking</h3>
<p>Sesame oil is a staple in Asian-inspired dishes, from stir-fries to marinades. Try tossing vegetables or proteins in a light coating before air frying for extra crispiness. For more inspiration, browse our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable recipes</a> featuring sesame oil.</p>

<h3>Converting other amounts of sesame oil</h3>
<p>If your recipe calls for a different quantity, the same conversion applies: 1 gram equals roughly 0.035 ounces. For example, 100g is about 3.53 ounces, while 200g is approximately 7.05 ounces. Keep our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a> handy for quick reference.</p>

<h2>Tips for cooking with sesame oil in an air fryer</h2>
<p>Always preheat your air fryer to ensure even cooking. When using sesame oil, a little goes a long way—coat food lightly rather than drenching it. Too much oil can cause smoking or uneven browning. For easy cleanup, check out our guide on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer maintenance</a>.</p>
<p>Store sesame oil in a cool, dark place to preserve its flavour. Over time, exposure to light and heat can make it rancid. Fresh oil has a vibrant aroma, so if yours smells off, it’s time to replace it. Proper storage ensures your 150g (or 5.29-ounce) measurements always deliver the best results.</p>

<p>100 grams of honey is roughly equivalent to 0.3 cups or just under 1/3 cup. This conversion is essential for baking, cooking, or even preparing air fryer recipes where precise measurements ensure perfect results. Whether you're whipping up a cake or glazing chicken in your air fryer, knowing how to convert grams to cups saves time and avoids kitchen mishaps.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Honey Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of honey ensures your recipes turn out as intended. Too much can make dishes overly sweet, while too little may leave them lacking flavour. For air fryer cooking, precise measurements help with marinades, glazes, and even baking.

<p>Honey’s thickness and density mean it doesn’t pour like water, making measuring by volume trickier than by weight. A kitchen scale is ideal, but if you don’t have one, knowing that 100g of honey equals roughly 0.3 cups is a handy shortcut. Check out <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>our recipe collection</a> for inspiration on using honey in air fryer dishes.</p>  

<h2>Converting 100 Grams of Honey to Cups</h2>  
<p>Since honey is denser than water, 100 grams takes up less space in a cup. The exact conversion can vary slightly depending on honey type (raw, processed, or creamed), but 0.3 cups is a reliable standard. For baking or glazing meats in your air fryer, this measurement ensures consistency.</p>  

<h3>Measuring Without a Scale</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a scale, use a liquid measuring cup and fill it just below the 1/3 cup mark for 100 grams of honey. Stirring first helps eliminate air pockets for a more accurate measure. For sticky ingredients like honey, lightly greasing the cup or spoon makes cleanup easier—find tips in <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>our cleaning guide</a>.</p>  

<h2>Using Honey in Air Fryer Recipes</h2>  
<p>Honey adds sweetness and caramelisation to air-fried dishes, from glazed salmon to honey-roasted vegetables. For example, drizzle 100 grams (about 0.3 cups) over chicken wings before air frying for a sticky, golden finish.

<p>When substituting honey for sugar in air fryer baking, reduce liquids slightly, as honey adds moisture. A 100-gram portion works well in cakes or cookies, giving them a rich flavour.

<h3>Storing Honey for Freshness</h3>  
<p>Keep honey in an airtight container at room temperature to prevent crystallisation. If it hardens, gently warm the jar in warm water to restore its pourable consistency—perfect for measuring out 100 grams whenever needed.</p>

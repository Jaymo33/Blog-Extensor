<p>360 ml of half and half equals approximately 1.5 cups. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes, baking, or any cooking where precise measurements matter. Whether you're in the UK or the US, knowing how to convert millilitres to cups ensures your dishes turn out perfectly every time.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter</h2>
<p>Using the right amount of half and half can make or break a recipe. Too much or too little can affect texture, flavour, and cooking time.

<h2>How to Measure 360 ml of Half And Half</h2>
<p>Measuring liquids like half and half can be tricky if you don't have a metric measuring jug. A standard US cup holds 240 ml, so 360 ml is 1.5 cups. In the UK, a metric cup is 250 ml, making 360 ml roughly 1.44 cups. For most recipes, this small difference wonâ€™t matter, but for precision, use a kitchen scale or measuring jug.</p>
<p>If you're working with an air fryer, consider using a liquid measuring cup with clear markings. This helps avoid spills and ensures you get the exact amount needed. For more air fryer tips, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipes section</a>.</p>

<h3>US vs. UK Cup Measurements</h3>
<p>The difference between US and UK cup measurements can cause confusion. In the US, 1 cup is 240 ml, while in the UK, it's 250 ml. For 360 ml of half and half, this means 1.5 US cups or 1.44 UK cups. Most recipes account for this variance, but it's good to know which standard your recipe follows.</p>

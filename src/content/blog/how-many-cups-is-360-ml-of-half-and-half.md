<p>360 ml of half and half equals approximately 1.5 cups. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes, baking, or any cooking where precise measurements matter. Whether you're in the UK or the US, knowing how to convert millilitres to cups ensures your dishes turn out perfectly every time.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter</h2>
<p>Using the right amount of half and half can make or break a recipe. Too much or too little can affect texture, flavour, and cooking time. For air fryer recipes, precise measurements are especially important because the cooking process is faster and more intense. A slight deviation can lead to undercooked or overcooked results.</p>
<p>At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we emphasise the importance of accurate conversions. Whether you're making a creamy sauce or a decadent dessert, knowing how many cups 360 ml of half and half equals ensures consistency. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more handy tips.</p>

<h2>How to Measure 360 ml of Half And Half</h2>
<p>Measuring liquids like half and half can be tricky if you don't have a metric measuring jug. A standard US cup holds 240 ml, so 360 ml is 1.5 cups. In the UK, a metric cup is 250 ml, making 360 ml roughly 1.44 cups. For most recipes, this small difference won’t matter, but for precision, use a kitchen scale or measuring jug.</p>
<p>If you're working with an air fryer, consider using a liquid measuring cup with clear markings. This helps avoid spills and ensures you get the exact amount needed. For more air fryer tips, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipes section</a>.</p>

<h3>US vs. UK Cup Measurements</h3>
<p>The difference between US and UK cup measurements can cause confusion. In the US, 1 cup is 240 ml, while in the UK, it's 250 ml. For 360 ml of half and half, this means 1.5 US cups or 1.44 UK cups. Most recipes account for this variance, but it's good to know which standard your recipe follows.</p>

<h2>Common Uses for Half And Half in Air Fryer Recipes</h2>
<p>Half and half is a versatile ingredient in air fryer cooking. It adds richness to sauces, custards, and even baked goods. For example, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert recipes</a> often call for half and half to create creamy textures. Whether you're making a savoury dip or a sweet treat, 360 ml of half and half (1.5 cups) is a common measurement.</p>
<p>Another popular use is in air fryer mashed potatoes or creamy pasta dishes. The fat content in half and half helps achieve a smooth, velvety consistency. For more inspiration, browse our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetables category</a>.</p>

<h3>Substitutes for Half And Half</h3>
<p>If you're out of half and half, you can mix equal parts whole milk and heavy cream to get a similar consistency. For 360 ml of half and half, use 180 ml of milk and 180 ml of cream. This substitute works well in most air fryer recipes without compromising flavour or texture.</p>

<h2>Tips for Storing Half And Half</h2>
<p>Once opened, half and half should be refrigerated and used within 7-10 days. To extend its shelf life, freeze it in ice cube trays for later use. When measuring 360 ml of half and half for a recipe, ensure it's fresh for the best results.

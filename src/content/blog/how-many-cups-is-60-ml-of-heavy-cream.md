<p>60 ml of heavy cream is approximately 0.25 cups (or 1/4 cup). This conversion is essential for baking and cooking, especially when using an air fryer for recipes that require precise measurements. Whether you're whipping up a dessert or adding richness to a savoury dish, knowing how to convert millilitres to cups ensures your recipes turn out perfectly every time.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Precision is key in baking and cooking, especially when using an air fryer. Heavy cream is a common ingredient in many recipes, from creamy sauces to decadent desserts. Using too much or too little can affect texture and flavour. For example, adding too much heavy cream to a cake batter might make it overly dense, while too little could leave it dry. That’s why converting 60 ml of heavy cream to cups (0.25 cups) is so important.</p>  

<p>If you’re using an air fryer, accurate measurements ensure even cooking and perfect results. Whether you’re making a <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>rich custard</a> or a creamy pasta sauce, knowing your conversions saves time and avoids kitchen mishaps.

<h3>How to Measure 60 ml of Heavy Cream</h3>  
<p>Measuring 60 ml of heavy cream is simple with the right tools.

For best results, pour the cream slowly to avoid spills and check the measurement at eye level.

<h2>Tips for Working with Heavy Cream</h2>  
<p>Heavy cream can be tricky to work with if not handled properly. When measuring 60 ml (0.25 cups), make sure your cream is cold for best results, especially if you’re whipping it.

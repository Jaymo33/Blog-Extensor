The weight of heavy cream can vary slightly depending on its fat content, but generally, 60 ml of heavy cream weighs around 58-62 grams. For precise baking, it’s best to measure by volume (ml or cups) unless the recipe specifies weight."

    "text": "You can substitute milk for heavy cream, but the results will differ. Heavy cream has a higher fat content, which adds richness and thickness. For 60 ml of heavy cream, you could use 60 ml of whole milk mixed with 1-2 tablespoons of melted butter to mimic the fat content. However, for air fryer recipes like sauces or custards, heavy cream is often preferred for its texture."

Alternatively, a standard shot glass often holds around 30-50 ml, so you could estimate using that. For air fryer recipes, accuracy is key, so investing in a simple measuring cup is worthwhile."

In the UK, 1 cup is 250 ml, while in the USA, it’s 240 ml. For 60 ml (0.25 cups), the difference is negligible, so you can use the same conversion in both regions."

<p>60 ml of heavy cream is approximately 0.25 cups (or 1/4 cup). This conversion is essential for baking and cooking, especially when using an air fryer for recipes that require precise measurements. Whether you're whipping up a dessert or adding richness to a savoury dish, knowing how to convert millilitres to cups ensures your recipes turn out perfectly every time.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Precision is key in baking and cooking, especially when using an air fryer. Heavy cream is a common ingredient in many recipes, from creamy sauces to decadent desserts. Using too much or too little can affect texture and flavour. For example, adding too much heavy cream to a cake batter might make it overly dense, while too little could leave it dry. That’s why converting 60 ml of heavy cream to cups (0.25 cups) is so important.</p>  

<p>If you’re using an air fryer, accurate measurements ensure even cooking and perfect results. Whether you’re making a <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>rich custard</a> or a creamy pasta sauce, knowing your conversions saves time and avoids kitchen mishaps. For more handy conversions, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure 60 ml of Heavy Cream</h3>  
<p>Measuring 60 ml of heavy cream is simple with the right tools. A liquid measuring cup with millilitre markings is ideal, but if you only have standard cups, remember that 60 ml equals roughly 1/4 cup. For best results, pour the cream slowly to avoid spills and check the measurement at eye level. If you’re using an air fryer for recipes like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>desserts</a>, precision ensures your treats come out perfectly every time.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for 60 ml of Heavy Cream</h2>  
<p>Heavy cream is a versatile ingredient, and 60 ml (or 0.25 cups) is just the right amount for many recipes. In an air fryer, you might use it to make creamy scrambled eggs, rich mashed potatoes, or even a quick Alfredo sauce. It’s also perfect for adding moisture to cakes or creating a luscious topping for fruit.</p>  

<p>If you’re experimenting with air fryer recipes, 60 ml of heavy cream can elevate dishes like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/breakfast>breakfast casseroles</a> or creamy dips. Just remember to measure accurately to avoid overpowering other flavours. For more inspiration, browse our collection of <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a>.</p>  

<h3>Converting Other Measurements</h3>  
<p>If you need to convert other amounts of heavy cream, here’s a quick reference: 30 ml is about 0.125 cups (1/8 cup), and 120 ml is roughly 0.5 cups (1/2 cup). These conversions are handy when scaling recipes up or down. For air fryer cooking, precise measurements ensure consistent results, whether you’re making a small batch or a family-sized meal.</p>  

<h2>Tips for Working with Heavy Cream</h2>  
<p>Heavy cream can be tricky to work with if not handled properly. When measuring 60 ml (0.25 cups), make sure your cream is cold for best results, especially if you’re whipping it. Overheating can cause it to separate, so be cautious when using it in hot dishes. In an air fryer, heavy cream works well in sauces and batters, but avoid overfilling to prevent spills.</p>

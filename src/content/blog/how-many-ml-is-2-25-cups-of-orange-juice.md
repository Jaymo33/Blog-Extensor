Whether you’re making a glaze, marinade, or baking a citrus-infused dessert, knowing how many ml is 2.25 cups of orange juice helps avoid kitchen mishaps. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we focus on making conversions simple for home cooks. Keep reading for tips on measuring liquids and adapting recipes for your air fryer.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on precise ingredient ratios to achieve crispy, evenly cooked dishes. Using the correct ml measurement for 2.25 cups of orange juice ensures your recipe’s flavour and texture stay balanced. Too much liquid can make food soggy, while too little may dry it out. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> simplifies these adjustments, especially for baking recipes like orange drizzle cake. Always measure liquids at eye level for accuracy—this small step makes a big difference.</p>  

<p>Many air fryer recipes, such as glazed chicken or citrus-infused salmon, call for orange juice as a key ingredient. Converting 2.25 cups of orange juice to ml (532.32 ml) ensures consistency across different measuring systems. If you’re scaling a recipe up or down, this conversion helps maintain proportions. For more inspiration, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> collection, where precise measurements lead to delicious outcomes every time.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure 2.25 Cups of Orange Juice Without a Measuring Cup</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a measuring cup, use a kitchen scale: 2.25 cups of orange juice weighs roughly 540 grams, which converts to 532.32 ml. Alternatively, a standard UK metric measuring jug will show millilitres clearly. For smaller quantities, remember that 1 cup equals 236.59 ml, so 2.25 cups is simply 2.25 multiplied by 236.59. This method works for any liquid, from orange juice to stock, ensuring your air fryer dishes turn out perfectly.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for 2.25 Cups of Orange Juice in Air Fryer Recipes</h2>  
<p>Orange juice adds brightness to both savoury and sweet air fryer dishes. A marinade made with 532.32 ml (2.25 cups) of orange juice tenderises chicken or pork while adding a tangy flavour. For desserts, this quantity is ideal for syrups or glazes—try it in our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>air fryer dessert recipes</a>. The acidity in orange juice also helps break down proteins, making it great for pre-cooking marinades. Just ensure you pat meat dry before air frying to avoid excess moisture.</p>  

<p>Another popular use is in citrus-based sauces for seafood, like prawns or salmon. Combining 2.25 cups of orange juice (532.32 ml) with garlic, honey, and soy sauce creates a sticky glaze that caramelises beautifully in the air fryer. For vegetarian options, toss tofu or vegetables in a mix of orange juice and spices before air frying. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/tofu>tofu recipes</a> for creative ways to use this versatile ingredient.</p>  

<h3>Adjusting Recipes for UK vs. US Measurements</h3>  
<p>In the UK, recipes often list liquids in millilitres, while US recipes use cups. Knowing that 2.25 cups of orange juice equals 532.32 ml helps bridge this gap. If a recipe calls for 2.25 cups (US), stick to 532.32 ml for accuracy. For larger batches, double or triple the amount proportionally—e.g., 4.5 cups would be 1064.64 ml. Keep our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a> handy for quick reference during cooking.</p>  

<h2>Tips for Storing Leftover Orange Juice</h2>  
<p>After measuring out 2.25 cups (532.32 ml) of orange juice, store any leftovers in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 3 days. Freezing in ice cube trays is another option—each cube holds about 30 ml, making future measurements easy. Use thawed juice in marinades, smoothies, or our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/breakfast>air fryer breakfast recipes</a>. Avoid storing juice in metal containers, as the acidity can react with the metal and alter the flavour.</p>  

<p>For best results, always use fresh orange juice when possible, as it lacks the preservatives found in store-bought varieties. If using concentrate, reconstitute it according to package instructions before measuring 2.25 cups (532.32 ml). Fresh juice not only tastes better but also enhances the nutritional value of your air fryer dishes.

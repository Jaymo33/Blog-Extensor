<p>285 ml of evaporated milk is roughly 1.2 cups, making it easy to measure for recipes. Whether you're baking a cake or preparing a creamy sauce in your air fryer, knowing this conversion ensures perfect results every time. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we understand how precise measurements can make or break a dish.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter</h2>
<p>Using the right amount of evaporated milk is crucial for texture and flavour. Too little, and your dish might turn out dry; too much, and it could become overly soggy. Air fryer recipes, like those found on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>our recipes page</a>, often rely on precise liquid measurements for even cooking. Evaporated milk, being thicker than regular milk, requires careful conversion to avoid mistakes.</p>
<p>For example, if a recipe calls for 285 ml of evaporated milk and you eyeball it, you might end up with a denser or runnier result than intended. That’s why we recommend using measuring cups or a kitchen scale for accuracy. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more handy measurement tips.</p>

<h2>How to Measure 285 ml of Evaporated Milk</h2>
<p>If you don’t have a metric measuring jug, you can still measure 285 ml of evaporated milk using standard cups. Since 1 cup equals 240 ml, 285 ml works out to just over 1 cup (1 cup + 1½ tablespoons). For air fryer recipes, this small difference can matter, especially in baked goods or custards.</p>
<p>Another method is to use a kitchen scale. Evaporated milk weighs roughly 1.04 grams per ml, so 285 ml would be about 296 grams. This method is especially useful for recipes where precision is key, like the desserts in our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert category</a>.</p>

<h3>Common Uses for 285 ml of Evaporated Milk</h3>
<p>Evaporated milk is a staple in many recipes, from creamy pasta sauces to rich desserts. In air fryer cooking, it’s often used in dishes like mac and cheese or bread pudding. If you’re making a recipe that calls for 285 ml, knowing the cup equivalent ensures you get the right consistency.</p>

<h3>UK vs. US Cup Measurements</h3>
<p>It’s worth noting that UK and US cup measurements differ slightly. A UK cup is 284 ml, while a US cup is 240 ml. For 285 ml of evaporated milk, this means roughly 1.2 US cups or just over 1 UK cup. Always check which measurement system your recipe uses to avoid errors.</p>

<h2>Tips for Cooking with Evaporated Milk</h2>
<p>Evaporated milk adds richness without the fat of cream, making it a versatile ingredient. When using it in air fryer recipes, like those in our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>cakes category</a>, remember it’s more concentrated than regular milk. You might need to adjust other liquids slightly to balance the recipe.</p>

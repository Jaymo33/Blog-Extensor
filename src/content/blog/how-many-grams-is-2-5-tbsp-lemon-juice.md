<p>2.5 tablespoons (tbsp) of lemon juice equals approximately 37 grams. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precision ensures perfect results. Whether you're marinating chicken or adding zest to a dessert, knowing the exact weight helps avoid over or under-seasoning. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we focus on accurate measurements to elevate your cooking.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Lemon Juice Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of lemon juice can make or break a dish. Too little, and your marinade lacks tang; too much, and it overpowers other flavours. In air fryer cooking, precise measurements ensure even cooking and balanced taste. For example, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>lemon herb chicken</a> relies on exact lemon juice quantities for optimal flavour. Converting 2.5 tbsp of lemon juice to grams eliminates guesswork.</p>  

<p>Lemon juice density can vary slightly, but 1 tbsp typically weighs around 15 grams. This means 2.5 tbsp translates to roughly 37 grams. If you’re scaling a recipe, this conversion ensures consistency. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more handy measurement swaps.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure Lemon Juice Correctly</h3>  
<p>For the most accurate results, use a digital kitchen scale. Pour the lemon juice into a measuring spoon, then transfer it to the scale for the exact weight. If you don’t have a scale, levelling off the tablespoon ensures minimal variance. Recipes like our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>lemon drizzle cake</a> benefit from this precision.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for 2.5 tbsp of Lemon Juice</h2>  
<p>This quantity is perfect for marinades, dressings, or glazes. A 37-gram portion of lemon juice adds brightness to air-fried salmon or roasted vegetables. It’s also ideal for balancing rich dishes, like our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>garlic lemon chicken thighs</a>. The acidity tenderises meat while enhancing flavour.</p>  

<p>Beyond savoury dishes, 2.5 tbsp of lemon juice works wonders in desserts. From light glazes to tangy curds, it’s a versatile ingredient. For cleaning your air fryer, a mix of lemon juice and water can help remove grease—visit our guide on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaning</a> for tips.</p>  

<h3>Adjusting Recipes with Lemon Juice</h3>  
<p>If a recipe calls for millilitres instead of grams, note that 2.5 tbsp equals about 37 ml. This interchangeability simplifies adjustments. For frozen or concentrated lemon juice, check labels for density differences. Always taste-test when substituting to ensure the desired acidity.</p>

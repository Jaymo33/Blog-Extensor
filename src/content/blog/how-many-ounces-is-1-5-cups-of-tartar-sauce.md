<p>1.5 cups of tartar sauce equals approximately 12 ounces. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements ensure perfect results. Whether you're coating fish fillets or whipping up a quick dipping sauce, knowing the exact weight helps maintain consistency.

Let’s dive deeper into why this measurement matters and how to use it effectively.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate tartar sauce measurements matter</h2>  
<p>Getting the right amount of tartar sauce ensures your dishes aren’t overly soggy or dry. In air fryer cooking, balance is key—too much sauce can lead to uneven cooking, while too little may leave your meal lacking flavour. For example, when preparing crispy air fryer cod, 1.5 cups of tartar sauce (or 12 ounces) is often ideal for coating four fillets. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> simplifies these calculations, so you never second-guess quantities.</p>  

<p>Precision also matters for meal prep. If you’re batch-cooking fish cakes or seafood bites, knowing that 1.5 cups of tartar sauce converts to 12 ounces helps scale recipes accurately. This is especially useful when following UK-based recipes, where weights are often preferred over volumes.

<h3>How to measure tartar sauce correctly</h3>  
<p>For the most accurate conversion of 1.5 cups of tartar sauce to ounces, use a kitchen scale. Scoop the sauce into a measuring cup, then weigh it to confirm it’s 12 ounces. If you don’t have a scale, remember that 1 cup of tartar sauce typically weighs 8 ounces, making 1.5 cups equal to 12 ounces. This method works for both homemade and store-bought sauces.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for 1.5 cups of tartar sauce</h2>  
<p>This quantity is perfect for family-sized portions. For instance, air fryer fish and chips often call for 1.5 cups of tartar sauce (12 ounces) to serve four people.

<h3>Adjusting recipes for different serving sizes</h3>

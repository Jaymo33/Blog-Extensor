If using bottled, check that it's 100% lemon juice without additives. The conversion remains the same - 335 ml of bottled juice equals the same amount in cups as fresh."

Cups can vary slightly between countries and even between different measuring cups.

<p>335 ml of lemon juice equals approximately 1.42 cups in the UK or 1.41 cups in the US. This conversion is essential for recipes, especially when using an air fryer for dishes like lemon drizzle cake or tangy marinades. Whether you're baking or cooking, knowing how many cups is 335 ml of lemon juice ensures your dish turns out perfectly every time.</p>

<h2>Understanding Lemon Juice Measurements</h2>
<p>Lemon juice is a common ingredient in many recipes, from desserts to marinades. When a recipe calls for 335 ml of lemon juice, it's crucial to know the equivalent in cups for accurate measuring. In the UK, 335 ml converts to roughly 1.42 cups, while in the US, it's about 1.41 cups. This slight difference matters in baking, where precision is key.</p>
<p>Using the correct measurement ensures your dish has the right balance of acidity and flavour. For air fryer recipes, like lemon-glazed chicken or citrus-infused desserts, getting the lemon juice measurement spot-on makes all the difference. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more handy measurement tips.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Conversions Matter</h2>
<p>In baking and cooking, especially with air fryers, precise measurements can make or break a dish. Too much lemon juice can overpower other flavours, while too little might leave your recipe lacking zest. Converting 335 ml of lemon juice to cups correctly ensures consistency in your cooking.</p>
<p>For example, if you're making a lemon drizzle cake in your air fryer, the 335 ml of lemon juice needs to be measured accurately for the perfect tangy glaze. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipes section</a> has plenty of ideas where this conversion will come in handy.</p>

<h3>UK vs US Cup Measurements</h3>
<p>It's worth noting that UK and US cup measurements differ slightly. A UK cup is 284 ml, while a US cup is 240 ml. This means 335 ml of lemon juice is 1.42 cups in the UK and 1.41 cups in the US. For most home cooking, this small difference won't be noticeable, but for precision baking, it's good to know.</p>

<h2>How to Measure 335 ml of Lemon Juice</h2>
<p>If you don't have a measuring jug with millilitre markings, you can still measure 335 ml of lemon juice using cups. Simply use the conversion of 1.42 cups (UK) or 1.41 cups (US) to get the right amount. For best results, use a liquid measuring cup rather than dry measuring cups.</p>
<p>When preparing air fryer recipes, like lemon-infused salmon or citrus-marinated veggies, accurate measurements ensure even cooking and perfect flavour.

<h3>Tips for Working With Lemon Juice</h3>
<p>Fresh lemon juice always delivers the best flavour, but bottled works in a pinch. If using fresh lemons, you'll need about 6-7 medium lemons to get 335 ml of juice. Remember to strain the juice to remove pulp and seeds for smooth measurements.</p>

<h2>Common Recipes Using 335 ml of Lemon Juice</h2>
<p>Many delicious recipes call for approximately 335 ml of lemon juice. Lemon curd, salad dressings, and marinades often use this quantity. In air fryer cooking, this amount is perfect for glazes or to add brightness to chicken and fish dishes.</p>

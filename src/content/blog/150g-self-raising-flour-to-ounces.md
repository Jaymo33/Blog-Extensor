    "@type": "Answer",
    "text": "You can use cups (150g is roughly 1 UK cup), but weighing is more accurate for air fryer recipes. Flour settles in storage, so cup measurements can vary. For consistent results in air fryer baking, especially with self-raising flour, digital scales are best."

    "acceptedAnswer": {
    "@type": "Answer",
    "text": "At higher altitudes, self-raising flour's effectiveness changes due to air pressure differences. While 150g still equals 5.29 ounces, you might need to adjust raising agents. For air fryer baking at altitude, slightly reduce the flour amount or increase liquid."

    "@type": "Answer",
    "text": "If your 150g (5.29 oz) flour measurement is correct, density could come from overmixing, old flour, or incorrect air fryer temperature. Always use fresh self-raising flour and avoid opening the air fryer during baking. Check your air fryer's temperature accuracy too."

<p>150 grams of self-raising flour equals approximately 5.29 ounces. This conversion is essential for anyone using UK recipes or air fryer baking, where precision matters. Whether you're whipping up cakes, cookies, or savoury dishes, getting the measurements right ensures perfect results every time.</p>

<h2>Why converting 150g of self-raising flour to ounces matters</h2>
<p>Many UK recipes, especially those for air fryers, list ingredients in grams, while some cooks prefer using ounces. Converting 150g of self-raising flour to ounces (around 5.29 oz) helps maintain accuracy. This is particularly important for baking, where even small measurement errors can affect texture and rise.</p>
<p>Air fryer recipes, like those on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, often require precise flour amounts to achieve the right consistency. Whether you're making air fryer cakes or bread, knowing how many ounces are in 150g of self-raising flour ensures your baked goods turn out light and fluffy.</p>

<h2>How to measure 150g of self-raising flour accurately</h2>
<p>For the most accurate conversion of 150g self-raising flour to ounces, use digital kitchen scales. Scoop the flour into your measuring tool without packing it down, then level it off. This avoids over-measuring, which can lead to dense bakes.</p>
<p>If you don't have scales, the spoon-and-level method works too. Gently spoon the flour into a measuring cup, then level it with a knife. Remember, 150g of self-raising flour equals about 1 UK cup (which is roughly 5.29 oz). For more conversion help, check our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>

<h3>The science behind self-raising flour measurements</h3>
<p>Self-raising flour contains added raising agents, so its weight differs slightly from plain flour. When converting 150g self-raising flour to oz, it's crucial to use fresh flour for accurate results. Old or compacted flour can throw off your measurements and affect your air fryer bakes.</p>

<h2>Common uses for 150g of self-raising flour in air fryer cooking</h2>
<p>150g (5.29 oz) of self-raising flour is a common measurement in many air fryer recipes. It's perfect for small batches of scones, muffins, or even air fryer pancakes. The quantity works well for 2-4 portion recipes, making it ideal for smaller households.</p>
<p>You'll find this measurement in many cake recipes on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>airfryerrecipe.co.uk's cake category</a>. Whether you're making a Victoria sponge or fairy cakes, knowing that 150g equals about 5.29 ounces helps ensure consistent results across different recipes.</p>

<h3>Adjusting recipes when you only have cup measurements</h3>
<p>If your recipe calls for 150g of self-raising flour (5.29 oz) but you only have cups, remember that 1 UK cup equals approximately 150g. However, for best results in air fryer baking, we always recommend weighing ingredients. The compact nature of air fryer cooking demands precision for even cooking and perfect texture.</p>

<h2>Tips for working with self-raising flour in your air fryer</h2>
<p>When using 150g of self-raising flour (5.29 oz) in air fryer recipes, always preheat your air fryer first. This helps create the perfect environment for the raising agents to work. Also, avoid opening the basket frequently, as this can cause temperature fluctuations that affect the rise.</p>
<p>For cleaning your air fryer after flour-based recipes, try our recommended <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner</a> to remove any stubborn flour residue. Keeping your appliance clean ensures better performance and tastier results every time you cook.</p>

<h3>Storing self-raising flour for accurate measurements</h3>
<p>To maintain the accuracy of your 150g to ounces conversions, store self-raising flour in an airtight container in a cool, dry place. This prevents moisture absorption which can affect both weight and raising power. For best results in air fryer baking, use flour within its best-before date.</p>

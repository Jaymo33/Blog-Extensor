<h3>The science behind self-raising flour measurements</h3>
<p>Self-raising flour contains added raising agents, so its weight differs slightly from plain flour. When converting 150g self-raising flour to oz, it's crucial to use fresh flour for accurate results. Old or compacted flour can throw off your measurements and affect your air fryer bakes.</p>

<h2>Common uses for 150g of self-raising flour in air fryer cooking</h2>

<h3>Adjusting recipes when you only have cup measurements</h3>

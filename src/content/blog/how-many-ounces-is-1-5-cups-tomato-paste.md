<p>1.5 cups of tomato paste equals approximately 12 ounces (340 grams) in the UK. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements can make or break your dish. Whether you're making a rich pasta sauce or a flavourful marinade, knowing the exact weight ensures consistency.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on even cooking, and incorrect ingredient quantities can lead to dry or undercooked meals. Tomato paste, being a concentrated ingredient, requires careful measurement. Too much can overpower a dish, while too little might leave it lacking depth. For perfect results every time, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> to simplify your cooking process.</p>  

<p>Many air fryer recipes, like those found on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, call for tomato paste in ounces rather than cups. This avoids discrepancies caused by packing density or scooping methods. Using a kitchen scale for precise ounces ensures your dish turns out as intended.</p>  

<h3>How to measure tomato paste without a scale</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a scale, you can still measure 1.5 cups of tomato paste accurately. A standard UK cup holds 8 fluid ounces, but tomato paste is denser than liquids. Spoon the paste into a measuring cup, levelling it off for consistency. For more tips, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable-based recipes</a> that frequently use tomato paste.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for tomato paste in air fryer recipes</h2>  
<p>Tomato paste adds richness to dishes like air-fried meatballs, stuffed peppers, or even homemade pizza. Its concentrated flavour means a little goes a long way, making the 1.5 cups to ounces conversion crucial. For inspiration, browse our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipes</a>, where tomato paste often features in marinades.</p>  

<p>Storing leftover tomato paste is easy—transfer it to an airtight container or freeze it in portions. This way, you’ll always have the right amount on hand for your next air fryer creation. Need cleaning tips for sticky tomato paste residue? Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner guide</a> has you covered.</p>

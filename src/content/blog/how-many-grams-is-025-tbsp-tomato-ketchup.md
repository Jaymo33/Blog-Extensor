<p>0.25 tbsp of tomato ketchup weighs approximately 3.75 grams. This measurement is essential for air fryer recipes where precise ingredient quantities can make all the difference. Whether you're whipping up a quick sauce or marinating chicken, knowing the exact weight ensures consistent results every time. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we understand the importance of accurate conversions for perfect dishes.</p>  

<h2>Why measure tomato ketchup in grams?</h2>  
<p>Measuring ingredients by weight, especially in grams, offers greater accuracy than volume measurements like tablespoons. Tomato ketchup can vary in density depending on brand and storage conditions, making weight a more reliable metric. For air fryer recipes, where even small deviations can affect texture and cooking time, grams provide consistency. If you're following a recipe from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>our collection</a>, converting 0.25 tbsp of tomato ketchup to grams ensures you stay on track.</p>  

<p>Using grams also simplifies scaling recipes up or down. Whether you're meal prepping or cooking for one, knowing that 0.25 tbsp of tomato ketchup equals 3.75 grams makes adjustments effortless. This precision is particularly useful for sauces and marinades, where balance is key. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a> for other common ingredients.</p>  

<h3>How to measure 0.25 tbsp of tomato ketchup</h3>  
<p>Measuring small quantities like 0.25 tbsp can be tricky without the right tools. A set of measuring spoons with fractional markings is ideal, but if you don't have one, you can estimate. A standard UK tablespoon holds 15ml, so 0.25 tbsp is roughly 3.75ml. For accuracy, a digital kitchen scale is your best bet—simply tare the scale with your container and add ketchup until it reads 3.75 grams.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for 0.25 tbsp of tomato ketchup</h2>  
<p>Though it might seem like a small amount, 0.25 tbsp of tomato ketchup can enhance many air fryer dishes. It's perfect for glazing mini meatballs, adding a tangy touch to roasted vegetables, or mixing into marinades for chicken or tofu. For inspiration, browse our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipes</a>, where ketchup often plays a supporting role.</p>  

<p>You might also use 0.25 tbsp of tomato ketchup in homemade BBQ sauces or as a base for dipping sauces. Combined with other ingredients like honey or mustard, it creates a balanced flavour profile. If you're cooking frozen foods in your air fryer, a small amount of ketchup can elevate the dish without overpowering it.

<h3>Tips for storing tomato ketchup</h3>  
<p>To ensure your tomato ketchup remains fresh and easy to measure, store it in a cool, dry place before opening. Once opened, refrigeration helps maintain its consistency, making it easier to measure precise amounts like 0.25 tbsp. If your ketchup thickens over time, a quick stir or a few seconds in the microwave can restore its pourable texture.</p>

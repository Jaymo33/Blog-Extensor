<p>1.5 tablespoons of plain yogurt equals approximately 22.5 grams. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements can make or break your dish. Whether you're making marinades, dips, or baked goods, knowing the exact weight ensures consistency. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we emphasise accuracy to help you achieve the best results. Let’s dive deeper into why this measurement matters and how to use it effectively.</p>

<h2>Why accurate yogurt measurements matter</h2>  
<p>Using the correct amount of plain yogurt in your air fryer recipes ensures the right texture and moisture level. Too much yogurt can make batters runny, while too little may dry out your dish. For example, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer chicken marinade</a> relies on precise yogurt quantities for perfect tenderness. Grams provide a more reliable measurement than volume, especially for thicker ingredients like yogurt. This is why we recommend using a kitchen scale for accuracy.</p>  

<p>Many air fryer recipes, like those in our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a>, list ingredients by weight for consistency. Whether you're making a creamy dip or a fluffy cake, 22.5 grams of yogurt ensures your dish turns out as intended. This small detail can elevate your cooking from good to great. Plus, it eliminates the hassle of scooping and levelling tablespoons, saving you time and effort.</p>  

<h3>How to measure 1.5 tbsp of plain yogurt without scales</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a kitchen scale, you can still measure 1.5 tablespoons of plain yogurt accurately. Use a standard UK tablespoon (15ml) and fill it level to the brim for each scoop. For thicker yogurts like Greek yogurt, gently stir to loosen it before measuring. This method works well for recipes like our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>air fryer desserts</a>, where precision is key. Remember, slight variations won’t ruin your dish, but sticking close to 22.5 grams ensures reliability.</p>

<p>85 fan oven converts to approximately 100°C in a conventional oven. This 15-20°C difference accounts for the efficient heat distribution in fan-assisted ovens. Whether you're baking cakes or roasting vegetables, understanding this conversion is key to perfect results in your air fryer or traditional oven.</p>

<h2>Why Fan Oven Temperatures Differ</h2>
<p>Fan ovens circulate hot air constantly, cooking food faster and more evenly. This means recipes often specify lower temperatures than conventional ovens. The 85 fan oven to conventional oven conversion reflects this efficiency difference. Most manufacturers recommend reducing conventional oven temperatures by 15-20°C when using fan mode.</p>
<p>This principle applies equally to air fryers, which work similarly to fan ovens. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we've found many recipes need adjustment when moving between appliance types. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> can help simplify these calculations for perfect results every time.</p>

<h2>Practical Conversion Examples</h2>
<p>Let's explore some common 85 fan oven to celsius conversions for different cooking methods. For delicate bakes like soufflés or custards, 85°C fan equals about 100°C conventional. When roasting vegetables or cooking <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipes</a>, you might need to adjust slightly higher to 105°C.</p>
<p>Remember that oven thermostats can vary, so it's worth investing in an oven thermometer. We've tested dozens of models at <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> and found even new ovens can be 5-10°C off their displayed temperature.</p>

<h3>Air Fryer Equivalent Temperatures</h3>
<p>Since air fryers use rapid air technology like fan ovens, their temperature settings are often identical. An 85°C fan oven setting typically converts directly to 85°C in an air fryer. However, cooking times may be shorter due to the compact size and intense air circulation.</p>

<h2>Adjusting Cooking Times</h2>
<p>When converting 85 fan oven to conventional oven temperatures, timing adjustments are just as important as temperature changes. As a general rule, increase conventional oven cooking times by 10-15% when converting from fan settings. For example, a recipe calling for 30 minutes at 85°C fan might need 33-35 minutes at 100°C conventional.</p>
<p>This principle holds true for <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/potatoes>potato dishes</a> and other staples. Our testing at <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> shows that thicker cuts of meat or dense baked goods may need even more time adjustment when converting between oven types.</p>

<h3>Special Cases and Exceptions</h3>
<p>Some recipes, particularly those involving sugar work like caramel or meringues, require more precise temperature control. In these cases, the 85 fan oven to conventional oven conversion might need finer adjustment. We recommend checking progress frequently and using visual cues alongside timer settings.</p>

<h2>Oven Type Comparison</h2>
<p>Understanding how 85 fan oven compares to other oven types helps achieve consistent results. Gas ovens, for instance, often have more temperature fluctuation than electric models. When converting 85°C fan to a gas oven, you might need to use gas mark ¼ (approximately 110°C) for similar results.</p>
<p>For those using combination microwave ovens, the conversion becomes more complex. These appliances often cook faster still, so you might need to reduce both temperature and time compared to standard 85 fan oven to conventional oven conversions.</p>

<h3>Maintaining Your Appliances</h3>
<p>Regular cleaning ensures accurate temperature readings in all oven types. Our guide to <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaning</a> applies equally to conventional and fan ovens. Built-up grease and food debris can affect heat distribution and thermostat accuracy over time.</p>

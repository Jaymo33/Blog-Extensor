<p>1 tablespoon (tbsp) of sunflower oil weighs approximately 13.6 grams in the UK. This measurement is essential for air fryer cooking, where precise quantities can make all the difference in texture and flavour. Whether you’re frying, roasting, or baking, knowing the exact weight helps you achieve consistent results every time. For more handy conversions, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Using the correct amount of oil ensures your food cooks evenly and doesn’t become overly greasy. Too much oil can lead to soggy results, while too little might leave your dish dry. Sunflower oil is a popular choice for air fryers due to its high smoke point and neutral flavour. If you’re new to air frying, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a> offers plenty of inspiration for healthy, oil-conscious meals.</p>  

<p>Many air fryer recipes call for just a tablespoon or two of oil, so knowing the gram equivalent helps with portion control. This is especially useful if you’re tracking calories or following a specific diet. For example, 1 tbsp sunflower oil to grams is a common query among health-conscious cooks. Measuring by weight rather than volume can also improve accuracy, as spoon sizes can vary slightly.</p>  

<h3>How to measure sunflower oil for air fryer recipes</h3>  
<p>The easiest way to measure 1 tbsp of sunflower oil in grams is with digital kitchen scales. Simply place your measuring spoon on the scales, tare to zero, then pour in the oil until it reaches 13.6g. If you don’t have scales, a standard UK tablespoon holds about 15ml of liquid, which equates to roughly 13.6g for sunflower oil. Remember that different oils have slightly different densities, so this conversion is specific to sunflower oil.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for sunflower oil in air frying</h2>  
<p>Sunflower oil works brilliantly for coating vegetables before air frying, giving them a crisp exterior without excess oil. Try it with potatoes for perfect chips or with <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipes</a> for golden, crispy skin. Because it’s light in flavour, it won’t overpower other ingredients, making it versatile for both savoury and sweet dishes. Many bakers even use it in <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>air fryer cakes</a> where butter isn’t suitable.</p>  

<p>When reheating food in your air fryer, a light spray or brush of sunflower oil can revive leftovers beautifully. Just 1 tbsp sunflower oil how many grams becomes important when you want to add just enough to refresh pizza or bring back crispness to fried foods. For cleaning your appliance afterwards, our guide to the best <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaners</a> makes maintenance simple.</p>  

<h3>Comparing sunflower oil to other cooking oils</h3>  
<p>While sunflower oil weighs about 13.6g per tablespoon, other oils have slightly different weights. Olive oil, for instance, is roughly 14g per tbsp, while coconut oil is about 13.5g when melted. These small differences matter when you’re being precise with measurements. Sunflower oil’s high smoke point (around 230°C) makes it particularly good for air frying at higher temperatures without burning.</p>  

<h2>Tips for using sunflower oil in your air fryer</h2>  
<p>To distribute oil evenly, toss ingredients in a bowl with the measured amount before adding to the basket. For delicate items like fish or <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/tofu>tofu recipes</a>, brush the oil on lightly to prevent sticking. Remember that 1 tbsp equals how many grams of sunflower oil is just the starting point – you can often reduce this amount further for healthier cooking. The air fryer’s circulating heat means you need less oil than traditional frying methods.</p>  

<p>Store your sunflower oil in a cool, dark place to maintain its quality. If you notice any off smells or flavours, it’s time to replace it – rancid oil can affect both taste and health benefits.

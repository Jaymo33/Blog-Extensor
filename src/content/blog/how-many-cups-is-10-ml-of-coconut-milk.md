<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on circulating hot air to cook food evenly, so ingredient ratios are crucial. Too much liquid, like coconut milk, can make food soggy instead of crispy. For example, a marinade with 10 ml of coconut milk needs the right balance to coat without dripping. Many <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> call for small amounts of liquids to avoid excess moisture. Always measure carefully for consistent results.</p>  

<p>Using 10 ml of coconut milk in a recipe? A kitchen scale or graduated measuring spoons can help. For context, 10 ml is about two teaspoons—just enough to add richness without overpowering.

<h2>How to Measure 10 ml of Coconut Milk Without a Scale</h2>  
<p>No measuring tools? A standard teaspoon holds roughly 5 ml, so two level teaspoons equal 10 ml. For thicker coconut milk, stir it first to ensure consistency. If your recipe calls for 10 ml of coconut milk in cups, a 1/4 cup measure filled to just under the 1/8 mark will work. Precision matters, especially in <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken marinades</a> or glazes.</p>

<p>10 ml of coconut milk is approximately 0.042 cups (or roughly 1/24 of a cup). This small measurement is often used in air fryer recipes for sauces, marinades, or light coatings. Precise conversions like this ensure your dishes turn out perfectly every time. If you're using an air fryer, even slight measurement differences can affect texture and cooking time. Bookmark <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>our conversion chart</a> for quick reference.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on circulating hot air to cook food evenly, so ingredient ratios are crucial. Too much liquid, like coconut milk, can make food soggy instead of crispy. For example, a marinade with 10 ml of coconut milk needs the right balance to coat without dripping. Many <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> call for small amounts of liquids to avoid excess moisture. Always measure carefully for consistent results.</p>  

<p>Using 10 ml of coconut milk in a recipe? A kitchen scale or graduated measuring spoons can help. For context, 10 ml is about two teaspoons—just enough to add richness without overpowering. Check out <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert recipes</a> where coconut milk enhances flavour without weighing dishes down.</p>  

<h2>How to Measure 10 ml of Coconut Milk Without a Scale</h2>  
<p>No measuring tools? A standard teaspoon holds roughly 5 ml, so two level teaspoons equal 10 ml. For thicker coconut milk, stir it first to ensure consistency. If your recipe calls for 10 ml of coconut milk in cups, a 1/4 cup measure filled to just under the 1/8 mark will work. Precision matters, especially in <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken marinades</a> or glazes.</p>  

<h3>Converting 10 ml of Coconut Milk for Different Recipes</h3>  
<p>Whether you're baking or sautéing, 10 ml of coconut milk adds subtle creaminess. In air fryer baking, this amount can replace butter or oil in some recipes. For savoury dishes, it’s ideal for light sauces. Need more conversions? Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning guide</a> also includes measurement tips.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for 10 ml of Coconut Milk in Air Fryers</h2>  
<p>This small quantity is perfect for brushing onto fish or vegetables before air frying. It adds moisture without making food greasy. Try it in <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable recipes</a> for a hint of tropical flavour. You can also mix 10 ml with spices for a quick glaze.</p>  

<p>For desserts, 10 ml of coconut milk can be drizzled over air-fried fruit or used in batters. Its high fat content helps with browning and crispiness. Always adjust cooking times slightly when adding liquids to avoid sogginess.</p>

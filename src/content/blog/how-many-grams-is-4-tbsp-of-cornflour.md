<p>4 tablespoons (tbsp) of cornflour equals approximately 32 grams (g). This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements ensure the best texture and consistency. Whether you're coating chicken or thickening a sauce, knowing how many grams 4 tbsp of cornflour is can make all the difference.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Cornflour Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Using the correct amount of cornflour ensures your air fryer dishes turn out perfectly crispy or smoothly thickened. Too little, and your coating might not stick; too much, and your food could become overly dense. For recipes like crispy air-fried chicken or tempura vegetables, 4 tbsp of cornflour (32g) is often the ideal amount.</p>  

<p>Cornflour is a staple in many air fryer recipes found on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, especially for creating light, crunchy coatings. If you're unsure about conversions, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> can help simplify the process.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure Cornflour Correctly</h3>  
<p>For the most accurate results, spoon the cornflour into the tablespoon and level it off with a knife. Scooping directly from the bag can compact the flour, leading to an incorrect measurement. This method ensures you get exactly 32g for 4 tbsp of cornflour.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for 4 Tbsp of Cornflour in Air Fryers</h2>  
<p>Many air fryer recipes call for 4 tbsp of cornflour to achieve the perfect texture. From crispy tofu to golden shrimp, this measurement is a game-changer. You’ll find plenty of inspiration in our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipes</a> section, where cornflour is often used for breading.</p>  

<p>If you're reheating leftovers in the air fryer, a light dusting of cornflour can restore crispiness. Just 4 tbsp (32g) is enough to coat several portions, making it a versatile ingredient for quick meals.</p>  

<h3>Converting Other Cornflour Measurements</h3>  
<p>If your recipe requires more or less cornflour, here’s a quick guide: 1 tbsp = 8g, 2 tbsp = 16g, and 3 tbsp = 24g. This makes scaling recipes up or down simple, whether you're cooking for one or a family.</p>  

<h2>Tips for Storing Cornflour</h2>  
<p>To keep your cornflour fresh, store it in an airtight container in a cool, dry place. This prevents clumping and ensures accurate measurements every time. Proper storage also extends its shelf life, so you’re always ready for your next air fryer adventure.</p>

At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we understand the importance of getting measurements right for flawless results.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate butter measurements matter</h2>  
<p>Using the correct amount of butter is crucial for texture and flavour in air fryer cooking. Too much butter can lead to greasy, unevenly cooked food, while too little might leave your dish dry.

<p>Butter measurements also affect baking times in the air fryer. Since air fryers cook faster than conventional ovens, precise quantities help avoid undercooked or burnt results.

<h2>How to measure 50g of butter without scales</h2>  
<p>If you don’t have a kitchen scale, you can still measure 50g of butter (1.76 ounces) using tablespoons. One tablespoon of butter typically weighs around 14g, so 3.5 tablespoons will give you roughly 50g. This method is handy when you're in a pinch and need to follow a recipe precisely.

<h3>Converting butter for different recipes</h3>  
<p>Different recipes may require butter in various forms—melted, softened, or cold. When converting 50g of butter to ounces, remember that the state of the butter doesn’t change its weight. Whether you're making air fryer garlic bread or a buttery cake, 50g will always be 1.76 ounces.

<h2>Common mistakes when measuring butter</h2>  
<p>One common error is using volume measurements (like cups) instead of weight, which can lead to inconsistencies. For example, a cup of melted butter weighs differently than a cup of solid butter. Always opt for weight measurements like grams or ounces for accuracy. If you're unsure, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner</a> guide also includes tips on maintaining your appliance for perfect cooking.</p>  

<p>Another mistake is not accounting for the wrapper’s weight when measuring butter. Most butter wrappers have markings for grams and ounces, making it easy to slice off 50g (1.76 ounces) without guesswork. This small step can make a big difference in your air fryer dishes, ensuring consistent results every time.</p>

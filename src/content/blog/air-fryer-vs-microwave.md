title: "air fryer vs Microwave"
description: "For UK households constantly juggling speed and taste, the air fryer vs microwave debate is becoming hard to ignore. Microwaves are champions at reheating leftovers and defrosting frozen meals, but that’s where their powers end. They rely on electromagnetic waves, which often leave food rubbery or soggy — not exactly what you'd want after a long day. Enter air fryers, with their ability to crisp, brown, and deliver proper texture. By circulating hot air, they mimic convection oven cooking without the long wait times or bulk."

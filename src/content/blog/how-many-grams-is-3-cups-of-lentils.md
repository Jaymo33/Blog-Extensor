<h2>How to Measure 3.0 Cups of Lentils Correctly</h2>
<p>To measure 3.0 cups of lentils accurately, use a dry measuring cup and level off the top. Avoid packing the lentils down, as this can lead to an incorrect weight.

<h2>Common Mistakes When Measuring Lentils</h2>
<p>One common error is using a liquid measuring cup for dry lentils, which can lead to inaccuracies. Another is eyeballing the amount, which often results in too much or too little. Always use proper tools to measure 3.0 cups of lentils (600 grams) for consistency. Overfilling the air fryer basket with lentils can also affect cooking times.

<p>Storing lentils properly ensures they retain their weight and quality. Keep them in an airtight container to prevent moisture absorption, which can alter measurements. If you’re cooking from frozen, adjust slightly as frozen lentils may weigh more. For more storage hacks, browse our meal prep section. Accurate measurements start with properly stored ingredients.</p>

<p>100g of flour equals approximately 3.5 ounces. This conversion is essential for air fryer baking, where precise measurements can make or break your recipe. Whether you're whipping up cakes, cookies, or bread, knowing how to convert grams to ounces ensures consistency. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we focus on making these conversions simple so your dishes turn out perfectly every time.</p>

<h2>Why Convert 100g of Flour to Ounces?</h2>  
<p>Many UK recipes use grams, while others rely on ounces, especially older cookbooks or international guides. Converting 100g of flour to ounces (3.5 oz) helps you follow recipes accurately. Air fryer baking, in particular, benefits from precise measurements because the cooking process is faster and more intense. A slight imbalance in flour can affect texture, rise, and browning.

<p>Using a kitchen scale is the most accurate way to measure flour, but if you only have measuring cups, our conversion ensures you’re close enough. Remember, 100g of flour to oz is a standard weight, but flour type (plain, self-raising, or wholemeal) can slightly vary in density. For foolproof results, stick to weighing ingredients whenever possible.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure 100g of Flour Without a Scale</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a scale, you can approximate 100g of flour using measuring cups. One cup of all-purpose flour weighs around 120g, so 100g is just under a cup. However, this method isn’t as precise—flour settles and compacts, leading to inconsistencies. For air fryer recipes, where precision matters, we recommend investing in a cheap digital scale.

<h2>Common Uses for 100g of Flour in Air Fryer Recipes</h2>  
<p>100g of flour is a common measurement in small-batch baking, perfect for air fryer recipes. You might use it for single-serving cakes, cookies, or even coating for fried foods. For example, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>air fryer cake recipes</a> often call for 100g of flour to ensure the right crumb structure. The air fryer’s rapid circulation cooks batters quickly, so accurate measurements prevent dryness or sogginess.</p>  

<p>Another great use is for breaded dishes like chicken or fish. A 100g flour to oz conversion ensures your coating isn’t too thick or thin. Too much flour can make coatings doughy, while too little won’t crisp properly. For crispy, golden results, measure carefully and pair with our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning tips</a> to keep your air fryer in top shape.</p>  

<h3>Does Flour Type Affect the 100g to Ounce Conversion?</h3>  
<p>While 100g of any flour equals roughly 3.5 ounces, different types have varying densities. For example, wholemeal flour is denser than plain flour, so 100g might take up slightly less volume. This matters less for weight measurements but can affect cup conversions. For air fryer recipes, stick to the type specified—swapping plain for self-raising flour, for instance, alters rise and texture.</p>

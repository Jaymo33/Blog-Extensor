<p>500 grams of cocoa powder is roughly equivalent to 4.2 cups in the UK and 4.8 cups in the US, depending on how tightly it's packed. This conversion is essential for baking, especially when using an air fryer for cakes or desserts. Precise measurements ensure your recipes turn out perfectly every time.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Cocoa Powder Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Getting the right amount of cocoa powder is crucial for achieving the perfect texture and flavour in your baked goods. Too much can make your dessert overly bitter, while too little might leave it lacking richness. Whether you're making brownies, cakes, or cookies, accuracy is key.</p>  
<p>If you're using an air fryer for baking, precise measurements become even more important. Air fryers cook food faster and more evenly, so ensuring your ingredients are correctly portioned helps avoid under or overcooking.

<h3>UK vs. US Cup Measurements</h3>  
<p>In the UK, a standard cup holds 250ml, while in the US, it's 240ml. This slight difference means 500 grams of cocoa powder converts to approximately 4.2 UK cups or 4.8 US cups. Always check which measurement system your recipe uses to avoid mistakes.</p>  

<h2>How to Measure Cocoa Powder Correctly</h2>  
<p>For the most accurate results, use a kitchen scale to weigh your cocoa powder. If you don't have one, lightly spoon the powder into a measuring cup and level it off with a knife. Avoid packing it down, as this can lead to using too much.</p>  
<p>If you're adapting a traditional oven recipe for an air fryer, precise measurements ensure the cooking time and temperature adjustments work correctly.

<h2>Storing Cocoa Powder for Freshness</h2>

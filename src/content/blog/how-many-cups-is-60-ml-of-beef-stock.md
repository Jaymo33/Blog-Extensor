<p>60 ml of beef stock equals approximately ¼ cup. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements can make or break a dish. Whether you're making a rich gravy, a hearty stew, or a flavourful marinade, knowing how to convert 60 ml of beef stock to cups ensures consistency. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we focus on making cooking conversions simple so you can focus on creating delicious meals.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>
<p>Using the right amount of beef stock can significantly impact the texture and flavour of your dish. Too little, and your recipe might turn out dry; too much, and it could become soggy. The air fryer’s rapid cooking process means liquids evaporate quickly, so precise measurements are crucial. For example, if a recipe calls for 60 ml of beef stock, using ¼ cup ensures the perfect balance. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more handy tips.</p>

<p>Many air fryer recipes, especially those involving sauces or marinades, rely on accurate liquid measurements. Beef stock adds depth to dishes like air-fried meatballs or roasted vegetables. By converting 60 ml of beef stock to cups correctly, you avoid guesswork and achieve restaurant-quality results every time. Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a> for inspiration on using beef stock in your air fryer.</p>

<h2>How to Measure 60 ml of Beef Stock Without a Measuring Cup</h2>
<p>Don’t have a measuring cup? No problem. You can use a tablespoon to measure 60 ml of beef stock. Since 1 tablespoon equals 15 ml, you’ll need 4 tablespoons to reach 60 ml. This method is handy for quick adjustments while cooking. Alternatively, a standard UK metric cup holds 250 ml, so 60 ml is just under a quarter of that.</p>

<h3>Using Kitchen Scales for Precision</h3>
<p>For those who prefer weighing ingredients, 60 ml of beef stock weighs roughly 60 grams. This is because the density of beef stock is close to water (1 ml = 1 g). A kitchen scale can be a game-changer for air fryer cooking, ensuring your measurements are spot-on. Visit <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> for more measurement hacks.</p>

<h2>Common Recipes Using 60 ml of Beef Stock</h2>
<p>Beef stock is a versatile ingredient in air fryer cooking. From savoury gravies to succulent roasts, here are some dishes where 60 ml of beef stock shines. Try adding it to air-fried sausages for extra juiciness or mixing it into a marinade for steak. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/beef>beef recipe category</a> has plenty of ideas to get you started.</p>

<h3>Adjusting Recipes for Different Measurements</h3>

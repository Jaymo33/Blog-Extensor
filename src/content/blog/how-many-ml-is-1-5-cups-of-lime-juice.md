    "@type": "Answer",
    "text": "While you can substitute lemon juice at a 1:1 ratio (355 ml lemon juice for 355 ml lime juice), the flavour profile will differ. Lemon juice is slightly sweeter and less floral than lime. For air fryer recipes where acidity matters (like ceviche-style dishes), this swap works, but adjust other seasonings accordingly."

    "acceptedAnswer": {
    "@type": "Answer",
    "text": "Grams measure weight, while ml measure volume. Lime juice weighs about 1.04 grams per ml, so 355 ml equals roughly 369 grams. Professional recipes often use weight for precision, especially in baking. For air fryer cooking, ml measurements are typically sufficient unless making delicate items like macarons."

<p>1.5 cups of lime juice equals 355 ml, making it easy to measure for your air fryer recipes. Whether you're whipping up a citrusy marinade or adding a tangy twist to desserts, precise measurements ensure perfect results every time. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we know how crucial accuracy is in cooking, especially when using an air fryer.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Lime Juice Measurements Matter</h2>
<p>Using the right amount of lime juice can make or break a dish. Too little, and your recipe lacks zest; too much, and it becomes overpowering. In air fryer cooking, balanced flavours are key, as the intense heat locks in tastes quickly. Whether you're making <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>lime-marinated chicken</a> or a zesty dessert, 355 ml (1.5 cups) ensures consistency.</p>
<p>Lime juice also affects texture and acidity in recipes like ceviche or glazes. For air fryer users, precise conversions prevent soggy or overly dry outcomes. Check our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for other common measurements to streamline your cooking process.</p>

<h2>Converting Cups to Millilitres for Lime Juice</h2>
<p>While 1.5 cups of lime juice is 355 ml, note that cup sizes vary slightly between the UK and US. The UK metric cup holds 250 ml, whereas the US customary cup is 236.59 ml. For air fryer recipes, we recommend sticking to the UK standard unless specified otherwise.</p>
<p>If you're working with bottled lime juice, check the label—some brands list both cup and ml measurements. Freshly squeezed lime juice may yield slightly different volumes due to pulp content. For best results, strain it before measuring for recipes like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>citrus-infused desserts</a>.</p>

<h3>Tools for Measuring Lime Juice</h3>
<p>A liquid measuring cup with ml markings is ideal for accuracy. For smaller quantities, use a 100 ml graduated cylinder or a kitchen scale set to ml mode. These tools help avoid guesswork, especially when preparing marinades for <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/shrimp>air-fried shrimp</a>.</p>

<h3>Adjusting Recipes for Air Fryer Use</h3>
<p>Air fryers cook faster than conventional ovens, so lime juice reductions happen quicker. If a recipe calls for 1.5 cups (355 ml) of lime juice glaze, consider reducing it by 10-15% to account for evaporation. Always preheat your air fryer to ensure even cooking.</p>

<h2>Common Uses for 1.5 Cups of Lime Juice</h2>
<p>This quantity is perfect for batch cooking—think marinades for 4-6 chicken breasts or a large tray of roasted vegetables. It's also ideal for making lime curd or sorbet in your air fryer. Visit <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>our recipe hub</a> for inspiration using this measurement.</p>
<p>For cleaning your air fryer, a mix of 355 ml lime juice and water can help dissolve grease. After use, always rinse thoroughly—see our guide on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer maintenance</a> for best practices.</p>

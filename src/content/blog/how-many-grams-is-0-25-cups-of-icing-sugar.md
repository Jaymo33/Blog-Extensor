<p>0.25 cups of icing sugar equals approximately 30 grams in the UK and 28 grams in the US. This conversion is essential for air fryer baking, where precision ensures perfect texture and sweetness in cakes, cookies, and desserts. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we know accurate measurements make all the difference in air fryer recipes.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Icing Sugar Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Getting the right amount of icing sugar ensures your air fryer bakes turn out perfectly every time. Too much sugar can make desserts overly sweet or affect texture, while too little might leave them bland. Whether you're making <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>air fryer cakes</a> or dusting <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cookies>cookies</a>, 0.25 cups of icing sugar (30g UK/28g US) is a common measurement for glazes and toppings. Digital scales provide the most accuracy, especially for small quantities like this.</p>  

<p>Air fryers circulate hot air, which can dry out baked goods if the sugar ratio is off. That's why converting 0.25 cups of icing sugar to grams helps maintain moisture and structure. For more conversions, check our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> to streamline your baking process.</p>

<h3>UK vs. US Cup Measurements</h3>  
<p>In the UK, 1 cup of icing sugar weighs 120g, making 0.25 cups equal to 30g. In the US, 1 cup is lighter at 112g, so 0.25 cups equals 28g. This slight difference matters in recipes where precision is key. Always specify which measurement system your recipe uses to avoid inconsistencies.</p>

<h2>How to Measure 0.25 Cups of Icing Sugar Without Scales</h2>  
<p>If you don’t have scales, spoon the icing sugar into a measuring cup and level it off with a knife. Avoid packing it down, as this can lead to over-measuring. For 0.25 cups, fill a 1-cup measure to the quarter mark. Sifting the sugar beforehand ensures uniformity, especially for delicate <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>air fryer desserts</a>.</p>  

<p>Remember, air fryers cook faster than conventional ovens, so even small measurement errors can amplify. Using grams (30g UK/28g US) for 0.25 cups of icing sugar eliminates guesswork. For more tips, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipe collection</a>.</p>

<h3>Common Uses for 0.25 Cups of Icing Sugar</h3>  
<p>This quantity is perfect for dusting air-fried pastries, making small batches of glaze, or sweetening whipped cream. It’s also ideal for adjusting sweetness in <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/frozen-foods>frozen desserts</a> revived in the air fryer. Clean your air fryer afterward with our recommended <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning guide</a> to prevent sugar buildup.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of buttermilk can make or break your air fryer recipes. Too much liquid can lead to soggy results, while too little might dry out your dish. For example, if you're making <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer buttermilk chicken</a>, 535 ml of buttermilk (or roughly 2.26 cups) is often the perfect amount for a tender, juicy marinade. Always measure carefully to avoid disappointing outcomes.</p>

<h3>How to Measure 535 ml of Buttermilk Without a Scale</h3>  
<p>If you don't have a kitchen scale, use a liquid measuring cup for accuracy. Pour the buttermilk up to the 2.25-cup mark, then add an extra splash to reach 2.26 cups. For recipes like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>air fryer cakes</a>, this precision ensures the batter consistency is just right.</p>  

<h2>Converting 535 ml of Buttermilk in Different Cup Sizes</h2>

<p>For air fryer cooking, sticking to one system (preferably metric for precision) is best. If your recipe is American, 535 ml of buttermilk equals about 2.26 cups. For UK recipes, you'd use roughly 1.88 cups. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion guide</a> simplifies this for you.</p>

<h2>Tips for Storing Leftover Buttermilk</h2>

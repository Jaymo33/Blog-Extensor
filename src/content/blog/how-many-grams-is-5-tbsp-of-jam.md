<p>5 tablespoons of jam is approximately 100 grams. This conversion is handy for air fryer recipes where precision matters, ensuring your dishes turn out perfectly every time. Whether you're making a jam-filled pastry or glazing meats, knowing the exact weight helps avoid guesswork.</p>

<h2>Why convert tablespoons to grams?</h2>
<p>Converting tablespoons to grams ensures accuracy, especially in baking and air fryer cooking where measurements can make or break a recipe. Unlike volume measurements, grams provide a consistent weight, eliminating variations caused by how the jam is scooped or packed. This is particularly useful for recipes on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, where precision leads to better results. Plus, many modern recipes, especially those from the UK, list ingredients by weight for reliability.</p>
<p>Using grams also simplifies scaling recipes up or down. If you're adjusting a jam-based glaze for your air fryer chicken or doubling a dessert recipe, grams make the math straightforward. No more wondering if your tablespoons are heaped or level—just weigh and go.

<h2>How to measure 5 tbsp of jam accurately</h2>
<p>To measure 5 tablespoons of jam, use a standard UK tablespoon (15ml per tbsp). Scoop the jam without packing it down, then level it off with a knife for consistency. If your recipe calls for grams, transferring the jam to a kitchen scale is the most reliable method. This ensures you're using exactly 100 grams, whether for a cake or an air fryer glaze.</p>
<p>For sticky ingredients like jam, lightly greasing the spoon or using a silicone spatula can help release every bit. If you're working with a particularly thick jam, warming it slightly (without cooking) can make measuring easier. Remember, accuracy matters most in recipes like those found in our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert category</a>, where texture and sweetness need to be just right.</p>

<h3>Does jam type affect the weight?</h3>
<p>Yes, the type of jam can slightly alter the weight per tablespoon. Thicker jams like marmalade or fruit preserves may weigh more per tablespoon (up to 22g), while runnier jams could be closer to 18g. However, for most standard jams, 20g per tablespoon (totalling 100g for 5 tbsp) is a reliable average. When in doubt, check the jar's nutritional info—many brands list the weight per serving.</p>

<h2>Common uses for 5 tbsp of jam in air fryer cooking</h2>
<p>Five tablespoons of jam (100g) is a versatile quantity for air fryer recipes. It's enough to glaze a whole chicken or pork tenderloin, adding a sweet caramelised finish. For desserts, it can fill 6-8 small pastries or top a batch of air-fried pancakes. You might also mix it into a marinade or sauce for a fruity twist on savoury dishes.</p>

<h3>Storing leftover jam</h3>
<p>After measuring out your 5 tablespoons, ensure the remaining jam is stored properly. Always use a clean spoon to prevent mould, and keep the jar refrigerated after opening. Most jams last 1-2 months in the fridge—check for any off smells or discolouration before use. For longer storage, consider freezing small portions in airtight containers.</p>

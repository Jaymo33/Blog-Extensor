<p>660 ml of water equals approximately 2.79 cups in the UK or 2.8 cups in the US. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes, where precise measurements can make or break your dish. Whether you're cooking, baking, or just need to measure liquids, knowing how to convert millilitres to cups is a kitchen must-have.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>
<p>Air fryers rely on precise ingredient ratios to ensure even cooking and perfect results. Using the wrong amount of water can affect texture, cooking time, and overall dish quality. For example, adding too much water to a batter or marinade can make it too runny, while too little might leave it overly thick. That's why converting 660 ml of water to cups correctly is so important.</p>
<p>At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we emphasise the importance of accurate measurements for consistent results.

<h2>UK vs US Cup Measurements</h2>
<p>It's worth noting that UK and US cup measurements differ slightly. In the UK, 1 cup equals 250 ml, while in the US, it's 240 ml. This means 660 ml of water converts to 2.79 cups in the UK and 2.8 cups in the US. While the difference seems small, it can add up in recipes requiring multiple cup measurements.</p>
<p>For air fryer recipes, especially those involving batters or sauces, sticking to one measurement system is best. If you're using a recipe from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>our collection</a>, note whether it follows UK or US measurements to ensure accuracy.</p>

<p>Cooking prawns in the air fryer is quick, healthy, and delivers fantastic results when done correctly. After converting 9.25 kg prawns to pounds, pat them dry to ensure crispiness and toss lightly in oil or your favourite spices. Avoid overcrowding—cook in batches if necessary—to allow hot air to circulate freely around each prawn. This technique prevents sogginess and ensures every piece is evenly cooked.

After cooking, remember to clean your air fryer promptly to maintain its performance; our guide on <a href="https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner">air fryer cleaner</a> offers practical tips.

<h3>Common Mistakes When Converting and Cooking Prawns</h3>
<p>One common error is misinterpreting the conversion from 9.25 kg prawns to pounds, leading to inaccurate portioning. Always double-check your math or use a reliable converter to avoid under or over-seasoning. Another mistake is assuming all prawns are the same size; larger prawns may require slightly longer cooking times even at the correct weight. Also, forgetting to account for shell-on versus shell-off prawns can affect both weight and cooking duration. Shell-on prawns might weigh more but take longer to cook through, so adjust accordingly for best results.</p>

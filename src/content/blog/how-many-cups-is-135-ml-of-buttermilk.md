<p>135 ml of buttermilk is roughly 0.57 cups, making it just over half a standard US cup. This conversion is essential for baking and cooking, especially when using precise measurements for air fryer recipes. Whether you're whipping up pancakes or a tender cake, knowing how to convert 135 ml of buttermilk to cups ensures consistent results every time.</p>

<h2>Understanding Buttermilk Measurements</h2>
<p>Buttermilk is a staple in many recipes, from fluffy pancakes to moist cakes. When a recipe calls for 135 ml of buttermilk, it’s helpful to know the cup equivalent to avoid guesswork. In the UK, a standard metric cup holds 250 ml, while a US cup is about 237 ml. This means 135 ml of buttermilk is approximately 0.57 US cups or just over half a UK cup.</p>
<p>For air fryer recipes, precision matters. Too much or too little buttermilk can affect texture and rise. If you’re using an American recipe, stick to the 0.57 US cup measurement. For UK recipes, 135 ml is slightly more than half a metric cup. Always use a liquid measuring jug for accuracy, especially when working with air fryer batters or marinades.</p>

<h2>Why Buttermilk Matters in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>
<p>Buttermilk adds tanginess and tenderness to dishes, making it a favourite for fried chicken, scones, and even some air fryer cakes. Its acidity helps activate baking soda, giving baked goods a light, airy texture. When converting 135 ml of buttermilk to cups, you ensure your air fryer recipes turn out just right.</p>
<p>If you’re exploring <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a>, buttermilk is often used in marinades for chicken or as a base for batters. Measuring 135 ml accurately means your coatings will crisp up perfectly without becoming soggy. For best results, use a kitchen scale alongside measuring cups to double-check your conversions.</p>

<h3>Converting 135 ml of Buttermilk for Different Recipes</h3>
<p>Whether you’re baking or frying, 135 ml of buttermilk can be used in various ways. For example, in a classic buttermilk pancake recipe, this amount provides just the right moisture. If you’re adapting a traditional oven recipe for the air fryer, precise measurements like 135 ml ensure even cooking.</p>

<h2>Handy Tips for Measuring Buttermilk</h2>
<p>Measuring liquids like buttermilk can be tricky, especially when converting between millilitres and cups. To measure 135 ml of buttermilk accurately, use a clear liquid measuring cup with millilitre markings. Pour slowly to the 135 ml line, checking at eye level to avoid over-pouring.</p>
<p>If you don’t have a measuring cup, a kitchen scale can help. Buttermilk weighs roughly 1.03 grams per ml, so 135 ml should be about 139 grams. This method is especially useful for <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion charts</a>, where precision is key.

<h2>Common Uses for 135 ml of Buttermilk</h2>

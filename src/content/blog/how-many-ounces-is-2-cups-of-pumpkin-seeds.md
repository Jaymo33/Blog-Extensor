<p>2 cups of pumpkin seeds weigh approximately 10 ounces (283 grams). This measurement is key for air fryer recipes, ensuring accurate portions for roasting or baking. Whether you're prepping a snack or adding crunch to salads, knowing this conversion helps avoid guesswork.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air frying</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of pumpkin seeds ensures even cooking and perfect crispiness in your air fryer. Too many seeds can overcrowd the basket, leading to uneven roasting. Too few might burn quickly due to excess air circulation. For best results, stick to the 2 cups = 10 ounces rule.</p>  
<p>If you're exploring more air fryer conversions, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>. It covers common ingredients, making meal prep a breeze. Pumpkin seeds are versatile—try them in <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> for salads, granola, or as a standalone snack.</p>  

<h3>How to measure pumpkin seeds correctly</h3>  
<p>For precise results, use a dry measuring cup and level off the top with a knife. Don’t pack the seeds down, as this can skew the weight. If you’re using a kitchen scale, 10 ounces is your target for 2 cups. This method works for both raw and roasted pumpkin seeds.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for pumpkin seeds in air fryers</h2>  
<p>Pumpkin seeds add texture and nutrition to many dishes. Roast them in your air fryer with a bit of oil and salt for a crunchy snack. They’re also great sprinkled over soups or mixed into trail blends. For recipe inspiration, browse our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/snacks>snack category</a>.</p>  
<p>Storing pumpkin seeds properly keeps them fresh. After air frying, let them cool completely before sealing in an airtight container. They’ll stay crisp for up to two weeks. For cleaning tips, visit our guide on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer maintenance</a> to keep your appliance in top shape.</p>  

<h3>Adjusting recipes for different quantities</h3>  
<p>Need more or less than 2 cups? Here’s a quick reference: 1 cup = 5 ounces, and ½ cup = 2.5 ounces. Scaling recipes is simple once you know these conversions. Always preheat your air fryer for consistent results, especially when working with seeds or nuts.</p>  

<h2>Nutritional benefits of pumpkin seeds</h2>  
<p>Pumpkin seeds are rich in magnesium, zinc, and healthy fats. Air frying preserves these nutrients better than deep-frying. A 10-ounce (2-cup) serving provides a hearty dose of protein and fiber, making them a smart snack choice. For healthy meal ideas, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/meal-prep>meal prep section</a>.</p>  
<p>Experiment with flavors by adding spices like paprika or cinnamon before air frying. Sweet or savory, pumpkin seeds adapt to your taste. Just remember: 2 cups = 10 ounces, the golden ratio for perfect batches every time.</p>

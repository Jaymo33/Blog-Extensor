<p>1.5 tablespoons of Nutella equals approximately 28 grams. This measurement is essential for air fryer recipes where precision can make or break your dish. Whether you’re making Nutella-filled pastries or a quick chocolate spread for toast, knowing the exact weight ensures consistency. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we understand the importance of accurate measurements for perfect results every time.</p>

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>
<p>Air fryers rely on even heat distribution, and incorrect measurements can lead to uneven cooking. Using 28 grams of Nutella instead of eyeballing 1.5 tbsp ensures your recipes turn out as intended. This is especially crucial for baked goods like Nutella brownies or stuffed pancakes, where too much or too little can affect texture. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more handy measurements.</p>
<p>Many air fryer recipes call for Nutella as a filling or topping, and precise measurements help avoid messes. Overfilling can cause leaks, while underfilling might leave your dish lacking flavour. Whether you’re making a quick dessert or meal prepping, 28 grams is the sweet spot for 1.5 tbsp of Nutella.</p>

<h2>How to measure Nutella for air fryer recipes</h2>
<p>Measuring Nutella can be tricky due to its sticky consistency. For the most accurate 28 grams, use a digital kitchen scale. Scoop 1.5 tbsp onto the scale and adjust until it hits the right weight. If you don’t have a scale, levelling off the tablespoon with a knife helps approximate the amount. Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipes</a> for creative ways to use Nutella in your air fryer.</p>

<p>Different rice types, like basmati or jasmine, have slight variations in volume per gram. However, the standard conversion for 425 grams works well for most white and brown rice varieties. For best results, fluff the rice before measuring to avoid compacting it into the cup.</p>  

<h3>UK vs. US Cup Measurements</h3>  
<p>In the UK, 1 cup of rice is roughly 200 grams, so 425 grams equals about 2.1 cups. In the US, a cup is closer to 170 grams, making 425 grams approximately 2.5 cups.

<h2>How to Measure Rice for Air Fryer Recipes</h2>

<p>Pre-rinsing rice removes excess starch, which can affect volume. After rinsing, let the rice drain well before measuring 425 grams. This step is especially useful for sticky rice dishes or fried rice made in the air fryer.</p>  

<h3>Common Mistakes When Converting Grams to Cups</h3>  
<p>Using a liquid measuring cup for rice is a frequent error, as it can lead to incorrect readings. Always use dry measuring cups for grains. Another pitfall is ignoring rice type—short-grain rice may need slightly fewer cups than long-grain for 425 grams.</p>  

<h2>Air Fryer Rice Cooking Tips</h2>

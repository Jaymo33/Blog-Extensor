<p>425 grams of butter is roughly equivalent to 1.87 cups in the US and 1.76 cups in the UK. This conversion is essential for baking and cooking, especially when using an air fryer where precise measurements can make or break a recipe. Whether you're whipping up a cake or preparing a savoury dish, knowing how to convert grams to cups ensures consistent results every time.</p>

<h2>Understanding Butter Measurements</h2>
<p>Butter can be tricky to measure because its density varies slightly depending on temperature and brand. In the UK, butter is often sold in 250g blocks, making it easier to portion, while in the US, it’s typically sold in sticks. For 425 grams of butter, you’ll need to measure carefully to avoid over- or under-using this key ingredient. If you’re using an air fryer, precise measurements are even more critical to avoid greasy or dry outcomes.</p>
<p>Many air fryer recipes, like those on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, rely on accurate butter measurements for perfect texture and flavour. Whether you're making cookies or a savoury dish, knowing how many cups 425 grams of butter equals ensures your dish turns out just right.

<h2>US vs UK Cup Measurements</h2>
<p>It’s important to note that US and UK cup measurements differ slightly. In the US, 1 cup of butter is about 227 grams, while in the UK, it’s closer to 240 grams. This means 425 grams of butter converts to approximately 1.87 cups in the US and 1.76 cups in the UK. These small differences can affect your baking, so always double-check which measurement system your recipe uses.</p>
<p>If you’re adapting a recipe for your air fryer, like those in our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>cake category</a>, precise conversions are key. A slight mismeasurement can lead to uneven cooking or texture issues. For best results, use a kitchen scale to weigh your butter, especially when dealing with larger quantities like 425 grams.</p>

<h3>Why Accuracy Matters in Air Fryer Cooking</h3>
<p>Air fryers circulate hot air rapidly, which means ingredients cook faster and more evenly. If you use too much butter, your dish could become greasy or even cause smoking. Too little butter, and your baked goods might turn out dry. Measuring 425 grams of butter correctly ensures your air fryer recipes, whether sweet or savoury, come out perfectly every time.</p>

<h2>Tips for Measuring Butter Without a Scale</h2>
<p>If you don’t have a kitchen scale, you can still measure 425 grams of butter using cup measurements. In the US, 1 stick of butter is 113 grams, so 425 grams would be roughly 3.75 sticks. In the UK, a 250g block of butter is about 1 cup plus 2 tablespoons, so 425 grams would be 1.76 cups. For air fryer recipes, like those in our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert section</a>, these approximations can help you get close enough.</p>
<p>Another handy trick is to use tablespoon measurements. Since 1 tablespoon of butter is about 14 grams, 425 grams would be roughly 30 tablespoons. This method is especially useful for smaller batches or when adjusting recipes for your air fryer.

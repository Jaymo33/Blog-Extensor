<p>200 grams of yogurt is roughly 0.85 cups in standard US measurements, or just under 1 cup in UK metric conversions. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes, where precise measurements can make or break your dish. Whether you’re whipping up a cake, marinade, or dip, knowing how many cups 200 grams of yogurt equals ensures perfect results every time.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Yogurt Measurements Matter</h2>
<p>Using the right amount of yogurt in your air fryer recipes is crucial for texture and flavour. Too much yogurt can make cakes soggy, while too little might leave marinades dry. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we emphasise precision for dishes like air-fryer yogurt cake or creamy dips. A slight variation in measurement can alter cooking times and outcomes, especially in air fryers where heat distribution is intense.</p>
<p>For example, if a recipe calls for 200 grams of yogurt and you mistakenly use a full cup (240 grams), the excess moisture could affect baking times. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> helps avoid such mishaps, ensuring your yogurt-based recipes turn out flawless. Whether you’re in the UK or US, these conversions are tailored for air fryer cooking.</p>

<h2>UK vs. US Cup Measurements for Yogurt</h2>
<p>In the UK, a standard metric cup holds 250ml, while a US cup is 240ml. This small difference means 200 grams of yogurt equals about 0.8 UK cups or 0.85 US cups. For air fryer recipes, this distinction matters—especially when following international recipes. Always check whether your recipe uses UK or US measurements to avoid errors.</p>
<p>If you’re using a kitchen scale, weighing yogurt is more accurate than cup measurements. However, if you don’t have one, our guide ensures you can still measure 200 grams of yogurt correctly. Visit <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>our recipe section</a> for yogurt-based air fryer dishes that rely on precise measurements.</p>

<h3>How to Measure 200 Grams of Yogurt Without a Scale</h3>
<p>If you don’t have a scale, use a liquid measuring cup for 200 grams of yogurt. Fill it to just below the 1-cup mark (0.85 cups in the US or 0.8 UK cups). Stir the yogurt first to ensure consistency, as thickness varies between brands. Greek yogurt, for instance, is denser than regular yogurt, so adjustments may be needed.</p>

<h2>Common Recipes Using 200 Grams of Yogurt</h2>
<p>Many air fryer recipes call for 200 grams of yogurt, from marinades to baked goods. For example, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>air-fryer yogurt-marinated chicken</a> relies on this measurement for perfect tenderness. Yogurt also works wonders in air-fryer cakes, adding moisture without excess fat.</p>
<p>Another favourite is yogurt-based dips, like tzatziki, which pair perfectly with air-fryer veggies or pita chips. Check out <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>our cleaning tips</a> to keep your air fryer spotless after sticky yogurt recipes. With 200 grams of yogurt, the possibilities are endless—just measure accurately for best results.</p>

<h3>Adjusting for Different Yogurt Types</h3>
<p>Greek yogurt is thicker than regular yogurt, so 200 grams may take up slightly less cup space. For strained or skyr yogurt, you might need to pack it lightly into the cup. Always check your recipe notes for specifics, as some air fryer dishes are sensitive to yogurt density.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on precise ingredient ratios to ensure even cooking and perfect textures. When converting 3.25 cups of condensed milk to ml, accuracy prevents overly dense or runny results. Many air fryer recipes, especially desserts, depend on the right consistency of condensed milk. A slight miscalculation could alter the cooking time or final outcome. For foolproof baking, always measure liquids like condensed milk correctly.</p>  

<p>Using millilitres instead of cups can simplify recipes, especially if you're scaling quantities up or down. If you're exploring new <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a>, ml measurements provide consistency. Whether you're making caramel flan or sticky toffee pudding, knowing 3.25 cups of condensed milk is 768 ml helps streamline prep. Air fryers heat quickly, so having ingredients ready in the right amounts saves time.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure Condensed Milk Without a Measuring Cup</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a measuring cup, a kitchen scale can help. One ml of condensed milk weighs roughly 1.3 grams, so 768 ml would be about 998 grams. Alternatively, use a tablespoon (15 ml) and measure out 51 tablespoons for 3.25 cups. This method works well for smaller batches or when precision is crucial.

<h2>Common Uses for Condensed Milk in Air Fryer Recipes</h2>  
<p>Condensed milk adds richness to air fryer desserts like banoffee pie or tres leches cake. Knowing that 3.25 cups equals 768 ml helps when doubling or halving recipes. It’s also a key ingredient in no-churn ice creams and fudgy brownies made in the air fryer. The creamy texture binds ingredients while adding sweetness, so accurate measurement is essential. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>cake recipes</a> for inspiration.</p>  

<p>Beyond desserts, condensed milk can glaze meats or sweeten sauces in savoury air fryer dishes. A precise 768 ml (3.25 cups) ensures balanced flavours without overpowering other ingredients. If you're experimenting, start with smaller quantities and adjust.

<h3>UK vs. US Cup Measurements for Condensed Milk</h3>  
<p>In the UK, 1 cup is 284 ml, while in the US, it’s 240 ml. However, condensed milk is often sold in standardised cans, so 3.25 cups (768 ml) applies universally.

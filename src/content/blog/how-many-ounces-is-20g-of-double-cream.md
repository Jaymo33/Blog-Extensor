<p>20 grams of double cream equals approximately 0.71 ounces. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes that require precise measurements, especially when making desserts, sauces, or creamy dishes. Whether you're whipping up a batch of scones or a rich carbonara, knowing how to convert grams to ounces ensures your dish turns out perfectly every time.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on precise ingredient ratios to deliver consistent results. Using the correct amount of double cream—like 20g (0.71 oz)—can make or break a recipe. Too much cream might make your dish overly rich, while too little could leave it dry. For more air fryer tips, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> to simplify your cooking process.</p>  

<p>Many UK recipes use grams, but if your kitchen scale only measures ounces, this conversion is a lifesaver. Whether you're making a classic Victoria sponge or a creamy pasta sauce, knowing that 20g of double cream is 0.71 ounces ensures you stay on track. Explore more <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> to put your measurements to the test!</p>  

<h3>How to Measure 20g of Double Cream Without a Scale</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a scale, you can use tablespoons to measure double cream. One tablespoon of double cream weighs roughly 15g, so 20g would be just over 1.3 tablespoons. This method isn’t as precise as weighing, but it works in a pinch for recipes where slight variations won’t ruin the dish.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for 20g of Double Cream in Air Fryer Recipes</h2>  
<p>Double cream adds richness to both sweet and savoury dishes. In your air fryer, 20g (0.71 oz) of double cream can be used to make creamy scrambled eggs, luscious cheesecakes, or even a decadent chocolate fondant. For inspiration, browse our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert recipes</a> that feature this versatile ingredient.</p>  

<p>Another great use for 20g of double cream is in sauces. Whether you're making a mushroom stroganoff or a garlicky dip, this small amount can elevate the flavour and texture. Just remember to store any leftover cream properly—check our guide on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>keeping your air fryer clean</a> to avoid sticky messes.</p>  

<h3>Converting Other Dairy Products from Grams to Ounces</h3>  
<p>If you're working with other dairy ingredients, like milk or yoghurt, the conversion rate is similar. For example, 20g of milk is also roughly 0.71 ounces. However, thicker products like clotted cream may vary slightly, so always double-check if precision is key.</p>  

<h2>Tips for Storing Double Cream After Measuring</h2>  
<p>Once you’ve measured out your 20g (0.71 oz) of double cream, store any leftovers in an airtight container in the fridge. Double cream typically lasts 3–5 days, but always check for sour smells or separation before using. For more storage hacks, visit <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>.</p>  

<p>If you frequently use small amounts of double cream, consider freezing it in ice cube trays. Each cube holds about 15–20g, making it easy to grab the exact quantity you need for future air fryer recipes. Just thaw it overnight in the fridge before use.</p>

<p>10g of peanut butter is approximately 0.35 ounces. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements can make all the difference. Whether you're whipping up a batch of peanut butter cookies or adding a dollop to your air-fried desserts, knowing this conversion ensures accuracy.</p>

<h2>Why Convert 10g of Peanut Butter to Ounces?</h2>  
<p>Many UK recipes, especially those for air fryers, use grams, while some prefer ounces. Converting 10g of peanut butter to ounces (0.35 oz) helps you follow recipes seamlessly. If you're using an American cookbook or an older UK recipe, this conversion ensures you get the right consistency and flavour.</p>  
<p>Peanut butter is a staple in many air fryer recipes, from glazes to energy bites. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we recommend measuring ingredients like peanut butter accurately for the best results. Too much or too little can affect texture and taste, especially in baked goods.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure 10g of Peanut Butter</h3>  
<p>Using a digital kitchen scale is the most accurate way to measure 10g of peanut butter. If you don’t have one, two level teaspoons roughly equal 10g. For sticky ingredients like peanut butter, lightly oil the spoon first to help it slide off easily.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for 10g of Peanut Butter in Air Fryer Recipes</h2>  
<p>Peanut butter adds richness to both sweet and savoury dishes. A 10g portion is perfect for drizzling over air-fried bananas or mixing into a marinade for chicken. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipes section</a> for creative ways to use peanut butter in your air fryer.</p>  
<p>For desserts, 10g of peanut butter can be swirled into brownie batter or used as a filling for air-fried pastries. Its high fat content helps keep baked goods moist, making it a favourite among air fryer enthusiasts. Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert category</a> for more inspiration.</p>  

<h3>Converting Other Peanut Butter Measurements</h3>  
<p>If your recipe calls for larger amounts, remember that 100g of peanut butter equals roughly 3.5 ounces. For smaller quantities, 5g is about 0.18 ounces. Keep our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> handy for quick reference.</p>  

<h2>Tips for Working with Peanut Butter in Air Fryers</h2>  
<p>Peanut butter can burn quickly due to its sugar content. When using it in air fryer recipes, opt for natural peanut butter without added sugars. Stir it well before measuring to ensure consistency, as oils can separate.</p>  
<p>For easy cleanup, line your air fryer basket with parchment or use our recommended <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner</a> to remove sticky residues. Peanut butter can be messy, but these tips keep your appliance in top shape.</p>  

<h3>Storing Peanut Butter for Air Fryer Recipes</h3>  
<p>Store opened peanut butter jars upside down to prevent oil separation. If you’re measuring 10g frequently, consider pre-portioning it into small containers. This saves time and ensures accuracy for your air fryer meal prep.</p>

<p>30g of lemon juice is approximately 1.06 ounces. Whether you’re whipping up a zesty marinade or adding a tangy twist to your air fryer dishes, getting the measurements right is key. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we know precision matters, especially when working with bold flavours like lemon juice.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Using the correct amount of lemon juice can make or break a recipe. Too little, and your dish might lack brightness; too much, and it could become overpowering. The air fryer’s intense heat concentrates flavours, so measurements need to be spot-on. For example, a marinade with 30g of lemon juice (1.06 oz) will behave differently than one with a rough estimate.</p>  

<p>Many air fryer recipes, like those in our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipes section</a>, rely on precise ratios for the best results. Whether you’re cooking chicken, fish, or vegetables, knowing how to convert 30g of lemon juice to ounces ensures consistency. It’s especially handy when scaling recipes up or down for meal prep.</p>  

<h3>How to measure 30g of lemon juice without scales</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have digital scales, you can still measure 30g of lemon juice (1.06 oz) using volume. One medium lemon yields about 45-60ml (1.5-2 oz) of juice, so 30g is roughly half a lemon’s worth. For more accuracy, use a measuring spoon—two tablespoons equal about 30ml, which is close to 30g for lemon juice.</p>  

<h2>Converting 30g lemon juice to ounces for UK cooks</h2>  
<p>In the UK, recipes often use grams, while some air fryer manuals or older cookbooks reference ounces. To convert 30g of lemon juice to ounces, divide by 28.35 (since 1 oz = 28.35g). This gives you 1.06 oz, which you can round to 1 oz for simplicity in most recipes.</p>

Whether you’re adjusting a marinade for <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>air fryer chicken</a> or a glaze for desserts, knowing that 30g lemon juice equals 1.06 oz saves time and guesswork.</p>  

<h3>Common uses for 30g of lemon juice in air fryer recipes</h3>  
<p>Thirty grams of lemon juice (1.06 oz) is a versatile amount. It’s perfect for coating 500g of chicken wings before air frying, or for brightening up a tray of roasted vegetables. You’ll also find it in dressings for <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/salmon>air fryer salmon</a>, where acidity balances rich flavours.</p>  

<h2>Storing leftover lemon juice for future air fryer meals</h2>  
<p>If your recipe only needs 30g of lemon juice (1.06 oz), store the rest properly. Pour it into an ice cube tray—each cube holds about 15g (0.5 oz), so two cubes equal 30g. Frozen lemon juice keeps for months and is ready to toss into your next air fryer creation.</p>

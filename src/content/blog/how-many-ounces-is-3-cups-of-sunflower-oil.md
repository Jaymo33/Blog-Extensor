<p>3 cups of sunflower oil equals approximately 24 fluid ounces (or 24 oz). This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements ensure perfect results every time. Whether you're frying, baking, or making dressings, knowing the exact weight helps maintain consistency in your cooking.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Using the correct amount of oil in your air fryer ensures even cooking and prevents food from becoming too greasy or dry. Sunflower oil is a popular choice due to its high smoke point and neutral flavour, making it ideal for air frying. If you’re following a recipe from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, getting the oil measurement right is crucial for the best outcome.</p>  

<p>Too much oil can lead to soggy food, while too little may cause sticking or uneven browning. For dishes like crispy chicken or roasted vegetables, 3 cups of sunflower oil (24 oz) is often used for deep-frying or coating. Always check your air fryer’s capacity to avoid overfilling.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure Sunflower Oil Correctly</h3>  
<p>To measure 3 cups of sunflower oil accurately, use a liquid measuring cup with clear markings. Fill it to the 3-cup line, ensuring the oil sits level for an exact measurement. If you’re converting to ounces, remember that 1 cup of sunflower oil equals 8 fluid ounces, so 3 cups would be 24 oz.</p>  

<h2>Converting 3 Cups of Sunflower Oil to Other Units</h2>  
<p>If your recipe uses different units, here’s how 3 cups of sunflower oil translates: 24 fluid ounces, 710 millilitres, or 0.71 litres. For weight in grams, 3 cups of sunflower oil weigh around 680 grams. These conversions are handy when using international recipes or scaling portions.</p>

It’s also great for marinating or coating vegetables before roasting. If you’re preparing a large batch, this measurement ensures even cooking and golden results.</p>  

<h2>Tips for Storing and Reusing Sunflower Oil</h2>  
<p>After using 3 cups of sunflower oil in your air fryer, strain and store it in a cool, dark place for reuse. Properly stored oil can be used 2-3 times before losing quality. Avoid mixing old and new oil, as this can affect flavour and cooking performance.</p>

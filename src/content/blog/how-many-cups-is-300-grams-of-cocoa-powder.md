<h3>US vs. UK Cup Measurements</h3>  
<p>The difference between US and UK cup measurements might seem minor, but it can affect your recipe. A US cup holds 240ml, while a UK cup is 250ml. For 300 grams of cocoa powder, this translates to roughly 2.5 US cups or 2.4 UK cups. Always check which measurement system your recipe uses to avoid mishaps.</p>  

<h2>How to Measure Cocoa Powder Correctly</h2>  
<p>Scooping cocoa powder directly from the bag can lead to inconsistent measurements due to compaction. Instead, spoon the powder lightly into your measuring cup and level it off with a knife. This method ensures you're not packing in too much, which could throw off your recipe. For air fryer baking, precision is keyâ€”so take your time measuring.</p>  

<p>If you're scaling up a recipe, converting 300 grams of cocoa powder to cups becomes even more important. Doubling or halving a recipe requires exact measurements to maintain balance.

<h3>Common Mistakes When Measuring Cocoa Powder</h3>

Another error is tapping the cup to settle the powder, which can lead to over-measuring. Always measure cocoa powder as lightly as possible for the best results.</p>  

<h2>Using Cocoa Powder in Air Fryer Recipes</h2>

<p>350 grams of yogurt is approximately 1.4 cups in the UK or 1.5 cups in the US. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes, where precise measurements can make or break your dish. Whether you're whipping up a creamy dessert or a savoury marinade, knowing how to convert grams to cups ensures consistency. For more handy conversions, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Yogurt Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of yogurt in your air fryer recipes ensures the perfect texture and flavour. Too much yogurt can make dishes soggy, while too little might leave them dry. Whether you're making a <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert</a> or a marinade, precision is key. Air fryers cook food quickly, so even small measurement errors can affect the outcome. Stick to 350 grams of yogurt (or 1.4-1.5 cups) for reliable results every time.</p>  

<p>Different yogurt types—Greek, natural, or flavoured—have slightly varying densities, but 350 grams generally translates to the same cup measurement. If you're unsure, weigh your yogurt for accuracy. For more air fryer tips, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a>.</p>  

<h3>UK vs. US Cup Measurements</h3>  
<p>In the UK, 1 cup equals 250ml, while in the US, it's 240ml. This slight difference means 350 grams of yogurt is roughly 1.4 UK cups or 1.5 US cups. Always check your recipe's origin to avoid confusion. Most air fryer recipes on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> use UK measurements unless specified.</p>  

<h2>How to Measure Yogurt Without Scales</h2>  
<p>If you don’t have scales, use a measuring cup to portion 350 grams of yogurt. Spoon the yogurt into the cup without packing it down, then level it off with a knife. For thicker yogurts like Greek, fluff it lightly first. This method isn’t as precise as weighing but works in a pinch. Need more measurement hacks? Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning and usage guides</a> include handy tips.</p>  

<p>Remember, air fryer recipes often rely on exact ratios for even cooking. If you’re adapting a traditional recipe, converting grams to cups (like 350g yogurt to cups) ensures success. For example, a <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>cake</a> recipe with yogurt benefits from precise measurements.</p>  

<h3>Common Recipes Using 350 Grams of Yogurt</h3>  
<p>Many air fryer favourites, like marinades, dips, and baked goods, call for 350 grams of yogurt. Try it in tandoori chicken, creamy dressings, or even air-fryer cheesecake. The versatility of yogurt makes it a staple in many cuisines. For inspiration, browse our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe hub</a>.</p>

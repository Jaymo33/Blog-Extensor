<p>250g of tahini equals approximately 8.82 ounces. This conversion is essential for anyone using an air fryer to ensure precise measurements in recipes, whether you're making dips, dressings, or marinades. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we know how crucial accurate measurements are for perfect cooking results.</p>  

<h2>Why Convert 250g of Tahini to Ounces?</h2>  
<p>Many UK recipes, especially those for air fryers, list ingredients in grams, while some kitchen scales or international recipes use ounces. Converting 250g of tahini to ounces (8.82 oz) helps avoid guesswork and ensures consistency. Whether you're preparing a tahini-based sauce for air-fried chicken or a drizzle for roasted vegetables, precision matters.</p>  
<p>Air fryers cook food quickly, so balanced flavours are key. Too much tahini can overpower a dish, while too little might leave it lacking.

<h3>How to Measure Tahini for Air Fryer Recipes</h3>  
<p>Measuring tahini can be tricky due to its thick, sticky texture. For 250g (8.82 oz), use a digital kitchen scale for accuracy. If using measuring spoons, note that 1 tablespoon of tahini weighs roughly 15g (0.53 oz), so 250g would be about 16-17 tablespoons. Stir well before measuring, as oil separation can affect consistency.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for 250g of Tahini in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Tahini adds richness to many air fryer dishes. With 250g (8.82 oz), you could make a batch of creamy hummus to pair with air-fried pita chips or a tahini glaze for salmon.

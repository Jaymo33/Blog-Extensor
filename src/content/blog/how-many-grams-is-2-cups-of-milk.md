<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter</h2>
<p>When it comes to cooking and baking, precision is key. Using the correct amount of milk can make or break a recipe. Too little, and your dish might turn out dry; too much, and it could become soggy or unbalanced. For air fryer recipes, especially those involving batters or coatings, the right milk measurement ensures even cooking and perfect texture.</p>

This is particularly useful for international cooks who might use metric measurements more frequently.</p>

<h2>How to Measure 2.0 Cups of Milk Correctly</h2>
<p>Measuring liquids like milk can be tricky if you're not using the right tools. For the most accurate results, use a liquid measuring cup specifically designed for fluids. These cups have a spout and clear markings, making it easy to measure 2.0 cups of milk without spills or errors.</p>

For air fryer recipes, consistency is crucial, so stick to the recommended measurements.</p>

<p>Honey’s viscosity means it doesn’t pour like water, so measuring by volume (cups) can be tricky. Converting to millilitres ensures you’re using the exact amount needed. This is particularly important for air fryer recipes, where even small deviations can affect cooking times and results. If you’re working with sticky ingredients like honey, consider using a <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>non-stick air fryer liner</a> to make cleanup easier.</p>

<h2>Tips for Working with Honey in the Air Fryer</h2>  
<p>Honey can caramelise quickly in the air fryer, so keep an eye on cooking times to prevent burning. If using 2.75 cups of honey in ml (651.6 ml) for a glaze, apply it in layers during the last few minutes of cooking. This ensures a glossy finish without overdoing it.

<h3>Storing Leftover Honey</h3>  
<p>If you have leftover honey after measuring out 2.75 cups (651.6 ml), store it in an airtight container at room temperature. Honey has a long shelf life but can crystallise over time. To liquefy it, gently warm the jar in a bowl of hot water. Avoid microwaving, as this can degrade its quality.</p>

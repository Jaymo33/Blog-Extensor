<p>Reheating tofu in an air fryer takes just 3-5 minutes at 180°C (350°F), restoring its crispy exterior while keeping the inside tender. This method beats microwaving hands down, preventing that dreaded soggy texture. Whether you’ve got leftover takeaway tofu or meal-prepped batches from <a href="https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes">our tofu recipes</a>, your air fryer delivers superior results.</p>

<h2>Why an Air Fryer is Best for Reheating Tofu</h2>
<p>The air fryer’s rapid hot air circulation works wonders on previously cooked tofu. Unlike microwaves that steam food, the air fryer recrisps the outer layer while gently warming the centre. This makes it ideal for dishes like mapo tofu or crispy fried tofu where texture matters. Even tofu stored overnight in the fridge regains its appetising crunch. For best results, pat dry any excess moisture before reheating – a tip we swear by at <a href="https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk">airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>.</p>
<p>Compared to conventional ovens, air fryers reheat tofu faster while using less energy. Their compact size means concentrated heat reaches every nook of your tofu pieces. No more unevenly warmed leftovers with cold spots in the middle. Whether you’re working with firm, silken, or pressed tofu, adjusting the temperature slightly can accommodate different textures.

<h2>Step-by-Step Guide to Reheating Tofu</h2>
<h3>Preparing Your Tofu</h3>
<p>Start by arranging tofu pieces in a single layer in your air fryer basket – overcrowding leads to steaming rather than crisping. If reheating saucy tofu like in curry, gently blot excess liquid with kitchen paper. For extra crispiness, lightly spray with oil (though this isn’t essential). Most air fryers will perfectly reheat 200-300g of tofu in one batch.</p>

<h3>Time and Temperature Settings</h3>
<p>Set your air fryer to 180°C (350°F) for 3-5 minutes – the sweet spot for most tofu varieties. Check at 3 minutes; firm tofu may need the full 5 minutes while silken tofu reheats faster. No need to preheat for reheating purposes. If your tofu was originally breaded or deep-fried, these settings will restore that golden crunch beautifully.</p>

<h2>Pro Tips for Different Tofu Types</h2>
<p>Firm and extra-firm tofu withstand higher heat better – you can push to 190°C (375°F) for extra crispness. Silken tofu benefits from lower heat (160°C/320°F) to prevent breaking. Marinated tofu reheats wonderfully but watch for sugary glazes that might burn. For meal-prepped tofu from our <a href="https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/tofu">tofu category</a>, reheat straight from fridge to air fryer – no thawing needed.</p>
<p>If your reheated tofu seems dry, spritz lightly with water or broth before serving. Leftover tofu scramble? Reheat at 170°C (340°F) and stir halfway. Always let reheated tofu rest 1 minute – it continues crisping slightly after removal.

<h2>Troubleshooting Common Reheating Issues</h2>
<p>If tofu sticks to your air fryer basket, ensure it’s properly cleaned between uses or use parchment liners. Uneven reheating usually means overcrowding – work in batches if needed. For particularly dry results, reduce time by 30 seconds next attempt. Remember, air fryer models vary slightly, so note what works best with your specific appliance.</p>

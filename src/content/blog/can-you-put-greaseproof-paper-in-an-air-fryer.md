<p>Yes, you can use greaseproof paper in an air fryer, but it must be heat-resistant and properly secured to prevent fire hazards. Greaseproof paper designed for high temperatures (usually up to 220°C) works best in air fryers, preventing food from sticking while allowing proper air circulation.</p>

<h2>Understanding Greaseproof Paper for Air Fryers</h2>
<p>Greaseproof paper differs from regular baking paper in its composition and heat resistance. While both serve similar purposes, proper air fryer greaseproof paper typically has silicone coatings that withstand higher temperatures. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we recommend checking manufacturer specifications before use, as some budget papers may not be air fryer safe.</p>
<p>When shopping for greaseproof paper, look for products specifically labelled as air fryer compatible. These often come pre-cut to fit popular air fryer basket sizes, like those for Ninja or Philips models. The right paper should lie flat without obstructing the air fryer's fan or heating elements, which could otherwise cause uneven cooking or potential safety issues.</p>

<h3>Temperature Limits for Greaseproof Paper</h3>
<p>Most quality greaseproof papers can handle temperatures up to 220°C, which covers most air frying needs. However, some recipes on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>our recipes page</a> might require higher heat for crisping, so always verify your paper's maximum temperature rating. Exceeding this limit risks melting or even combustion, especially in smaller air fryers where heat concentrates quickly.</p>

<h2>Proper Usage Techniques</h2>
<p>Correct placement of greaseproof paper prevents most air fryer mishaps. Never simply lay sheets loosely in the basket - they must be weighted down with food or secured with safe methods. Many cooks find success by slightly crumpling the edges to create a stable base that won't fly up during cooking.</p>
<p>For particularly lightweight foods like vegetables or fish fillets from our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/white-fish>white fish recipes</a>, consider using air fryer-safe parchment with perforations. These small holes allow better airflow while still preventing sticking. Some manufacturers even produce reusable silicone-coated greaseproof sheets that withstand repeated air frying cycles.</p>

<h3>Safety Considerations</h3>
<p>Never leave greaseproof paper unattended during air frying, especially when trying new recipes. While modern air fryers have safety features, paper contacting heating elements can still pose fire risks. Always ensure at least an inch of clearance around the basket's edges and never cover the entire base - leave space for proper air circulation.</p>

<h2>Alternatives to Greaseproof Paper</h2>
<p>If you're uncomfortable using greaseproof paper, several alternatives work well in air fryers. Silicone mats designed for air fryers provide similar non-stick benefits without combustion risks. Lightly oiling the basket works for many foods, especially when following our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/potatoes>potato recipes</a> that naturally release oils during cooking.</p>
<p>Some cooks prefer using perforated parchment paper instead of greaseproof paper for certain applications. While both prevent sticking, perforated versions promote better airflow for crispier results. Whatever you choose, always monitor your air fryer during use and keep our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning guide</a> handy for post-cooking maintenance.</p>

<h3>Cleaning After Using Greaseproof Paper</h3>
<p>While greaseproof paper reduces cleanup, some oil or food particles may still reach the basket. Always remove and properly dispose of used paper immediately after cooking, then wipe down your air fryer while it's still warm (but not hot) for easiest cleaning. Residual paper fragments can burn during subsequent uses if not removed.</p>

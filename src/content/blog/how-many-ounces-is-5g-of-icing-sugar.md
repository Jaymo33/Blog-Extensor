<p>5 grams of icing sugar is equal to approximately 0.18 ounces. This conversion is essential for precision in baking, especially when using an air fryer where measurements can make or break a recipe. Whether you're dusting desserts or whipping up a cake, knowing the exact weight ensures consistency. For more air fryer baking tips, visit <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>.</p>

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer baking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers cook food quickly and evenly, but only if the ingredients are measured correctly. Too much or too little icing sugar can affect texture and taste. For example, 5g of icing sugar might seem small, but it’s crucial for delicate recipes like macarons or glazes. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> can help you avoid mistakes.</p>  
<p>Many UK bakers prefer using grams, but some recipes call for ounces. Converting 5g of icing sugar to ounces (0.18 oz) ensures you follow the recipe precisely. This is especially important for air fryer desserts, where even slight deviations can lead to uneven cooking. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>dessert recipes</a> for inspiration.</p>  

<h2>How to measure 5g of icing sugar without scales</h2>  
<p>Not everyone has a kitchen scale, but you can still measure 5g of icing sugar accurately. A level teaspoon holds about 4g, so 5g is just over one teaspoon. For ounces, this translates to roughly 0.18 oz. If you’re baking in an air fryer, consistency is key, so consider investing in a scale for perfect results.</p>  

<h3>Using conversions in air fryer recipes</h3>  
<p>Air fryer recipes often require precise measurements to ensure even cooking. Converting 5g of icing sugar to ounces (0.18 oz) helps when following American or older UK recipes. For more tips on air fryer baking, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>cake recipes</a>.</p>  

<h2>Common mistakes when converting grams to ounces</h2>  
<p>One of the biggest mistakes is confusing fluid ounces with weight ounces. Icing sugar is measured by weight, so 5g equals 0.18 oz, not fluid ounces. Another error is rounding too early—0.18 oz is more precise than 0.2 oz for baking. For more air fryer measurement tips, visit <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>our cleaning guide</a>.</p>  
<p>Using the wrong type of measuring spoon can also throw off your recipe. Always use dry measuring tools for icing sugar, not liquid ones. This ensures your 5g (0.18 oz) measurement is spot-on for air fryer baking.</p>  

<h3>Why UK bakers need to know this conversion</h3>  
<p>Many UK recipes use grams, but international or older cookbooks might list ounces. Knowing that 5g of icing sugar is 0.18 oz helps you adapt recipes effortlessly. This is especially useful for air fryer users, where precision ensures perfect results every time.</p>

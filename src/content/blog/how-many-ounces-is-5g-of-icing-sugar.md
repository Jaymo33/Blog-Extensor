<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer baking</h2>

For example, 5g of icing sugar might seem small, but it’s crucial for delicate recipes like macarons or glazes.

<p>Many UK bakers prefer using grams, but some recipes call for ounces. Converting 5g of icing sugar to ounces (0.18 oz) ensures you follow the recipe precisely. This is especially important for air fryer desserts, where even slight deviations can lead to uneven cooking.

<h2>How to measure 5g of icing sugar without scales</h2>  
<p>Not everyone has a kitchen scale, but you can still measure 5g of icing sugar accurately. A level teaspoon holds about 4g, so 5g is just over one teaspoon. For ounces, this translates to roughly 0.18 oz. If you’re baking in an air fryer, consistency is key, so consider investing in a scale for perfect results.</p>

<h2>Common mistakes when converting grams to ounces</h2>  
<p>One of the biggest mistakes is confusing fluid ounces with weight ounces. Icing sugar is measured by weight, so 5g equals 0.18 oz, not fluid ounces. Another error is rounding too early—0.18 oz is more precise than 0.2 oz for baking.

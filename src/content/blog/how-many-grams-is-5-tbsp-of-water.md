<h2>Why Convert 5 tbsp of Water to Grams?</h2>  
<p>Converting tablespoons to grams is crucial for accuracy, particularly in air fryer cooking where small variations can affect outcomes. Grams provide a universal measurement, eliminating inconsistencies caused by scooping techniques or tablespoon sizes. For example, a recipe on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes</a> might list liquids in grams to ensure perfect crispiness or moisture levels.</p>  
<p>Using weight measurements like grams also simplifies scaling recipes up or down. If you're meal prepping or adjusting portion sizes, converting 5 tbsp of water to grams (74g) ensures precision. This is especially useful for air fryer dishes like steamed vegetables or marinades, where liquid ratios matter.</p>  

<h2>How to Measure 5 tbsp of Water Accurately</h2>  
<p>For the most accurate conversion of 5 tbsp water to grams, use a digital kitchen scale. Place a measuring cup on the scale, tare it to zero, then add water until it reaches 74 grams. This method avoids discrepancies from manual tablespoon measurements.</p>  
<p>If you don't have a scale, use a standard UK tablespoon (15ml per tbsp). Fill it level to the brim without overflowing for consistency. Avoid using cutlery tablespoons, as their sizes vary. For air fryer recipes like those in the <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetables category</a>, precise water measurements help achieve even cooking.</p>

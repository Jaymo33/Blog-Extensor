<p>1 cup of chopped onion weighs approximately 4.5 ounces (or 128 grams). This measurement is key for air fryer recipes, where precision ensures even cooking and perfect results every time. Whether you're making crispy onion rings or adding onions to a stir-fry, knowing the weight helps you nail the recipe.</p>

<h2>Why accurate onion measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on even heat distribution, and the right amount of ingredients ensures everything cooks uniformly. Too much onion can lead to steaming instead of crisping, while too little might leave your dish lacking flavour. For recipes like air-fried onion bhajis or caramelised onions, precise measurements make all the difference.</p>  
<p>If you're unsure about conversions, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for quick reference. It covers everything from cups to grams and ounces, so you'll never second-guess your measurements again. Plus, it's especially handy for UK cooks who need to switch between metric and imperial units.</p>

<h3>How to measure chopped onions correctly</h3>  
<p>To get an accurate 1 cup measurement, chop your onions uniformly—neither too fine nor too chunky. Pack the onions lightly into a measuring cup without pressing down, as compacting them can skew the weight. If you're using a kitchen scale, simply tare the bowl and add onions until you hit 4.5 ounces.</p>

<h2>Common recipes using 1 cup of chopped onion</h2>  
<p>Many air fryer dishes call for this measurement, from savoury frittatas to hearty stews. Onions add depth to meals like air-fried sausage rolls or stuffed peppers, and knowing the ounce equivalent helps scale recipes up or down. For inspiration, browse our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> collection, where precise measurements lead to foolproof results.</p>  
<p>If you're prepping ahead, note that 1 cup of chopped onion translates to roughly half a large onion or one medium onion. This tip saves time when you're mid-recipe and realise you haven't measured ahead. For more veggie-centric dishes, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable recipes</a>, where onions often play a starring role.</p>

<h3>Tips for storing chopped onions</h3>  
<p>Pre-chopped onions can be stored in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 3 days. If you've measured out 1 cup (4.5 oz) but only need half, freeze the rest in a labelled bag for future use. This trick minimises waste and speeds up meal prep for busy weeknights.</p>

<h2>Converting other onion measurements</h2>  
<p>If a recipe calls for diced or minced onion instead of chopped, the weight may vary slightly. Diced onions pack more tightly, so 1 cup could weigh closer to 5 ounces. Always adjust cooking times in the air fryer if the onion texture changes—finer cuts cook faster and may need less time.</p>

<h3>Scaling recipes with onion measurements</h3>  
<p>Doubling a recipe? Remember that 2 cups of chopped onion equal about 9 ounces. For larger batches, like meal-prepping <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/meal-prep>air fryer meals</a>, a kitchen scale is your best friend. It eliminates guesswork and guarantees your dishes turn out as intended.</p>

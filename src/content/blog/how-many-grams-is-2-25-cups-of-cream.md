<h2>Why Accurate Cream Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Using the correct amount of cream ensures your dishes turn out as intended. Too much or too little can affect texture, flavour, and cooking time.

This standardisation simplifies recipes, whether you’re following British or American measurements. If you’re experimenting with <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert recipes</a>, this conversion will be your best friend. Always measure cream properly for consistent, delicious outcomes.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure Cream Correctly</h3>  
<p>For the most accurate results, use a kitchen scale to weigh your cream in grams. If you don’t have one, spoon the cream into a measuring cup and level it off. Avoid packing it down, as this can lead to over-measuring. Liquid measuring cups are best for cream, as they account for its viscosity. Need more tips?

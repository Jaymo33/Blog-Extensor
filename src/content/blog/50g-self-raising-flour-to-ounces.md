<p>50g of self-raising flour equals approximately 1.76 ounces. This conversion is essential for UK bakers using air fryers, where precise measurements can make or break a recipe. Whether you’re making fluffy cakes or crispy batters, knowing how to convert grams to ounces ensures consistency. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we specialise in helping you nail these conversions for perfect results every time.</p>

<h2>Why accurate flour measurements matter</h2>  
<p>Self-raising flour is a staple in British baking, and getting the weight right is crucial for texture and rise. Too much or too little can lead to dense cakes or flat breads. In an air fryer, where heat distribution is rapid, precision is even more important. A slight miscalculation could mean uneven cooking or a soggy outcome. That’s why converting 50g of self-raising flour to ounces (1.76 oz) correctly is key.</p>  
<p>For air fryer recipes, especially those from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>our collection</a>, sticking to the recommended weight ensures your bakes turn out light and airy. Whether you’re adapting a traditional oven recipe or trying a new creation, this conversion removes the guesswork.</p>  

<h2>How to measure 50g of self-raising flour without scales</h2>  
<p>Not everyone has kitchen scales handy, but there are easy ways to estimate 50g of self-raising flour. A standard UK tablespoon holds about 8g of flour, so 6 slightly heaped tablespoons will get you close to 50g. Alternatively, a metric cup (250ml) filled loosely with self-raising flour weighs roughly 120g, so filling it just under halfway will give you the right amount.</p>  
<p>For air fryer users, consistency is key—especially when making batters or doughs. If you’re baking frequently, investing in a small set of digital scales from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>our recommended tools</a> can save time and improve accuracy. But in a pinch, these visual methods work well for most recipes.</p>  

<h3>Converting other flour amounts</h3>  
<p>Once you’ve mastered the 50g self-raising flour to ounces conversion, you can apply the same logic to other quantities. For example, 100g equals 3.53 oz, and 25g is roughly 0.88 oz. This flexibility is handy when scaling recipes up or down for your air fryer’s capacity.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for 50g of self-raising flour in air fryers</h2>  
<p>This small but mighty amount of flour is perfect for single-serving bakes. Think individual muffins, small batches of scones, or coating for air-fried chicken. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>our cake recipes</a>, you’ll find plenty of ways to put 50g of self-raising flour to good use. It’s also ideal for thickening sauces or creating light tempura batters for vegetables.</p>  
<p>The air fryer’s compact size makes it great for testing small-batch recipes without waste. Whether you’re experimenting with gluten-free blends or classic British bakes, starting with 50g (1.76 oz) of self-raising flour gives you room to tweak and perfect your technique.</p>  

<h3>Storing self-raising flour for best results</h3>  
<p>To maintain its raising power, store self-raising flour in an airtight container in a cool, dry place. The air fryer’s environment can be humid, so keeping your flour fresh ensures consistent results when you need exactly 50g (1.76 oz) for a recipe.</p>

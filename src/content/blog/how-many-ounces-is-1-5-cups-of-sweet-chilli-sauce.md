<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on even heat distribution, and incorrect ingredient quantities can lead to uneven cooking. Sweet chilli sauce, with its sticky texture, needs precise measurements to avoid overpowering or underwhelming flavours. Too much sauce can make dishes soggy, while too little might leave them dry. That’s why converting 1.5 cups of sweet chilli sauce to ounces (12 oz) is so useful. For more recipe ideas, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a>.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure Sweet Chilli Sauce Correctly</h3>  
<p>Use a liquid measuring cup for accuracy when portioning out 1.5 cups of sweet chilli sauce. If you’re converting to ounces, a kitchen scale is your best friend. Simply tare the scale with your container, then pour the sauce until it hits 12 ounces. This method eliminates guesswork and ensures your air fryer dishes turn out perfectly every time.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for Sweet Chilli Sauce in Air Fryer Recipes</h2>  
<p>Sweet chilli sauce is a versatile ingredient that works wonders in air fryer cooking. From glazing chicken thighs to marinating shrimp, its sweet and spicy profile elevates any dish. A 1.5-cup (12 oz) quantity is ideal for batch cooking or meal prep. Try it in our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipes</a> for an irresistible sticky glaze.</p>  

<h3>Adjusting Recipes for Different Sauce Quantities</h3>  
<p>If a recipe calls for 1.5 cups of sweet chilli sauce but you only have ounces, remember that 12 oz is the equivalent. Scaling up or down? Just keep the ratio consistent—1 cup equals 8 ounces. This flexibility makes it easy to adapt recipes without compromising on flavour. For more tips, visit <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>.</p>

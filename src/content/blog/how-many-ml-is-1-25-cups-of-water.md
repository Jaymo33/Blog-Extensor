<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on precise measurements to achieve the best results. Too much or too little liquid can affect texture, cooking time, and even safety.

This is especially important for dishes like steamed vegetables or air-fried cakes, where exact proportions are key.</p>  

<p>At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we emphasise the importance of accurate conversions.

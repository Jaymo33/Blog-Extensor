<p>3 cups of sesame seeds equal approximately 24 ounces. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements ensure perfect results. Whether you're making sesame-crusted chicken or baking sesame seed cookies, knowing the weight helps avoid under or over-seasoning. For more air fryer conversions, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Using the correct amount of sesame seeds can make or break a dish. Too few, and you lose flavour; too many, and the texture becomes overwhelming. Air fryers cook food quickly, so balanced ingredients are key. For example, sesame seeds add crunch to air-fried salmon or tofu. Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/salmon>salmon recipes</a> for inspiration.</p>  

<p>Measuring by weight (ounces) is often more reliable than volume (cups) because seeds can settle or vary in density. A kitchen scale ensures consistency, especially for recipes like sesame-crusted chicken or baked goods. If you’re new to air frying, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipe collection</a> has plenty of ideas to get started.</p>  

<h3>How to Measure Sesame Seeds Without a Scale</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a scale, use the spoon-and-level method for cups. Gently spoon sesame seeds into a measuring cup and level off the top. Avoid packing them down, as this leads to inaccurate measurements. For sticky ingredients like tahini, check our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning tips</a> to keep your air fryer mess-free.</p>  

<h2>Common Uses for Sesame Seeds in Air Fryer Recipes</h2>  
<p>Sesame seeds add nutty flavour and crunch to air-fried dishes. Try them in coatings for chicken, fish, or tofu, or sprinkle over roasted vegetables. They’re also great in homemade granola or energy bars cooked in the air fryer. For more creative ideas, browse our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable recipes</a>.</p>  

<p>Toasting sesame seeds in the air fryer enhances their flavour. Spread them in a single layer and cook at 160°C for 3–4 minutes, shaking halfway. Store leftovers in an airtight container to maintain freshness. Need more tips? Visit <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> for expert advice.</p>  

<h3>Converting Other Sesame Seed Measurements</h3>  
<p>If your recipe calls for grams, 3 cups (24 ounces) of sesame seeds equal roughly 680 grams. For smaller amounts, 1 cup is about 8 ounces or 227 grams. Always adjust cooking times in the air fryer based on ingredient density. Stuck on conversions? Our air fryer chart simplifies the process.</p>

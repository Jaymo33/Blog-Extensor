<p>85 ml of condensed milk is approximately 0.36 cups. This conversion is essential for precise baking and cooking, especially when using an air fryer where measurements matter. Whether you're whipping up a dessert or a savoury dish, knowing how to convert ml to cups can make all the difference.</p>

<h2>Understanding the Conversion</h2>
<p>Converting 85 ml of condensed milk to cups is straightforward once you know the ratio. One cup equals 236.59 ml, so 85 ml is roughly 0.36 cups. This measurement is particularly useful for recipes that require exact quantities, such as those found on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>.</p>
<p>Condensed milk is a common ingredient in many desserts, and getting the measurement right ensures your dish turns out perfectly. If you're using an air fryer, precise measurements can affect cooking times and results, so it's worth double-checking.</p>

<h2>Why Accuracy Matters</h2>
<p>When baking or cooking with condensed milk, accuracy is key. Too much or too little can alter the texture and flavour of your dish. For example, a cake might turn out too dry or too moist if the measurements are off. This is especially true for air fryer recipes, where even small deviations can impact the outcome.</p>
<p>If you're unsure about your measurements, consider using a digital scale or a measuring jug for more precision. Many recipes on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> provide both metric and imperial measurements to make things easier.</p>

<h3>Common Uses for 85 ml of Condensed Milk</h3>
<p>85 ml of condensed milk is often used in small batches of desserts like fudge, caramel, or no-bake cheesecakes. It's also a great addition to coffee or tea for a creamy, sweet touch. If you're using an air fryer, you might find this measurement in recipes for mini cakes or tarts.</p>

<h2>Converting Other Measurements</h2>
<p>If you need to convert other amounts of condensed milk, the same principle applies. For example, 100 ml is roughly 0.42 cups, and 50 ml is about 0.21 cups. You can find a handy conversion chart on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> for quick reference.</p>
<p>Having these conversions at your fingertips can save time and reduce stress in the kitchen. Whether you're baking or using your air fryer, knowing how to switch between ml and cups is a valuable skill.</p>

<h3>Tips for Measuring Condensed Milk</h3>
<p>When measuring condensed milk, it's best to use a liquid measuring cup for accuracy. If you don't have one, a standard tablespoon holds about 15 ml, so 85 ml would be roughly 5.5 tablespoons. This method is less precise but can work in a pinch.</p>

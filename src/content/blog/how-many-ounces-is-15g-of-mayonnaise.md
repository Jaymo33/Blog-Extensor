<p>15 grams of mayonnaise is approximately 0.53 ounces. This conversion is essential for precise cooking, especially when using an air fryer where measurements can make or break a recipe. Whether you're whipping up a quick sauce or adjusting a dish, knowing this conversion ensures accuracy.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of ingredients is crucial for air fryer recipes. Too much mayonnaise can make food greasy, while too little might leave it dry. For example, if you're making crispy chicken or a quick aioli, 15g of mayonnaise (0.53 ounces) is a common measurement. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more handy tips.</p>  
<p>Mayonnaise is often used as a binder or coating in air fryer recipes. Whether you're making fish, chicken, or even roasted vegetables, the right amount ensures perfect texture. For more recipe ideas, visit our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipes section</a>.</p>  

<h2>How to Measure 15g of Mayonnaise Without a Scale</h2>  
<p>If you don’t have a kitchen scale, you can use a tablespoon to measure mayonnaise. One tablespoon of mayonnaise is roughly 14-15 grams, so it’s a close approximation. For more precise cooking, especially in air fryers, a digital scale is recommended.</p>  
<p>Another method is using teaspoons—three level teaspoons equal about 15g. This is handy for smaller quantities, like when making dressings or marinades. For more measurement hacks, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable recipes</a> where precise amounts matter.</p>  

<h3>Common Uses for 15g of Mayonnaise in Air Fryer Recipes</h3>  
<p>This small amount of mayonnaise is perfect for coating chicken tenders or fish fillets before air frying. It helps breadcrumbs stick and adds moisture. You can also mix it with spices for a quick marinade.</p>  

<h2>Converting Other Mayonnaise Measurements</h2>  
<p>If you need larger or smaller amounts, here’s a quick guide: 30g is about 1.06 ounces, and 5g is roughly 0.18 ounces. These conversions are useful for scaling recipes up or down. For more tips, check our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning guide</a> to keep your air fryer in top shape.</p>  
<p>Mayonnaise measurements are also handy for baking. Some air fryer cake or cookie recipes might call for small amounts to add richness. Always measure carefully for the best results.</p>  

<h3>Storing Mayonnaise for Air Fryer Recipes</h3>  
<p>Keep your mayonnaise sealed and refrigerated to maintain freshness. If you’re prepping ahead, measure out 15g portions for easy use. This saves time and ensures consistency in your cooking.</p>

<h2>Why Convert 150g of Jam to Ounces?</h2>  
<p>Many UK recipes use grams, while others reference ounces, especially older cookbooks or international guides. Converting 150g of jam to ounces (5.29 oz) helps avoid guesswork.

<h3>How to Measure 150g of Jam Without Scales</h3>  
<p>No scales? No problem. A standard UK tablespoon holds about 20g of jam, so 150g is roughly 7.5 tablespoons. For ounces, that’s just under 5.3 oz. Use a levelled spoon for accuracy, and avoid compacting the jam. This method works well for air fryer recipes like thumbprint cookies or sticky ribs.

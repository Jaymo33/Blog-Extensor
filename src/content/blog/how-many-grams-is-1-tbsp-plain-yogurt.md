<p>1 tablespoon (tbsp) of plain yogurt weighs approximately 15 grams. This measurement is standard for UK recipes, ensuring accuracy whether you're baking, cooking, or preparing dips for your air fryer. Knowing the exact weight helps maintain consistency, especially when following recipes from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> or adjusting portion sizes.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate yogurt measurements matter</h2>  
<p>Using the correct amount of plain yogurt can make or break a recipe. Too much can make batters runny, while too little might dry out dishes like air-fried cakes or marinades. For example, a <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>yogurt-based marinade</a> for chicken needs precise measurements to ensure even coating and flavour. A 15-gram tablespoon ensures you get it right every time.</p>  

<p>Many air fryer recipes, especially those involving baking, rely on yogurt for moisture and texture. If you're making <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>air fryer cakes</a>, even a small deviation in yogurt quantity can affect the rise and crumb. Measuring by weight (grams) is more reliable than volume (tablespoons) because it accounts for density variations.</p>  

<h3>How to measure 1 tbsp plain yogurt accurately</h3>  
<p>For the most precise measurement, use a digital kitchen scale. Scoop the yogurt into a tablespoon, level it off with a knife, and weigh it. If you don't have scales, fill the spoon evenly without packing it down. Strained or Greek yogurt may weigh slightly more per tablespoon due to reduced water content.</p>  

<h2>Converting other yogurt quantities to grams</h2>  
<p>If a recipe calls for larger amounts, here's a quick reference: 1 teaspoon (tsp) is about 5 grams, 2 tbsp equal 30 grams, and 1/4 cup roughly translates to 60 grams. These conversions are handy for scaling up <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer recipes</a> or adjusting serving sizes.</p>  

<p>For batch cooking or meal prep, knowing these conversions saves time. If you're preparing a <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/meal-prep>yogurt-based sauce</a> for multiple portions, calculating in grams ensures uniform flavour and consistency across servings. This is particularly useful for air fryer dishes where even cooking is key.</p>  

<h3>Common mistakes when measuring yogurt</h3>  
<p>One frequent error is using heaped tablespoons, which can add up to 20 grams instead of 15. Another is not stirring the yogurt first, leading to inconsistent measurements due to separation. Always give it a quick mix before scooping for reliable results in your air fryer creations.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of ingredients, like 0.66 cup of mustard, ensures your air fryer dishes turn out perfectly every time. Too much or too little can affect cooking times and results. For example, a marinade with 0.66 cup of mustard (5.28 oz) will coat chicken evenly, giving it a tangy kick without overpowering other flavours.</p>

<h2>How to Measure 0.66 Cup of Mustard Correctly</h2>  
<p>Measuring 0.66 cup of mustard can be tricky without the right tools. Use a liquid measuring cup for the most accurate results. Fill it to the 2/3 cup mark, then subtract a tiny bit to get 0.66 cup. Alternatively, weigh it on a kitchen scale for 5.28 ounces.</p>  

<h3>Using a Kitchen Scale for Precision</h3>  
<p>A digital kitchen scale is the best way to measure 0.66 cup of mustard in ounces. Simply tare your scale with the container, then pour the mustard until it reads 5.28 oz. This method eliminates guesswork and ensures your air fryer recipes are spot-on.</p>  

<h2>Common Recipes Using 0.66 Cup of Mustard</h2>  
<p>Many air fryer recipes call for 0.66 cup of mustard, especially for glazes and sauces.

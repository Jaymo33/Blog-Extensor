<p>1.5 cups of butter equals approximately 340 grams. This conversion is essential for precise baking and air frying, ensuring your recipes turn out perfectly every time. Whether you're whipping up a cake or preparing a savoury dish in your air fryer, knowing the exact gram measurement for 1.5 cups of butter makes all the difference. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we understand the importance of accurate measurements, especially when adapting traditional recipes for air fryers.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Butter Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Butter is a key ingredient in many recipes, and even small measurement errors can affect texture and taste. When using an air fryer, precise measurements ensure even cooking and perfect results. For example, if you're making cookies or a cake, too much butter can make them greasy, while too little can leave them dry. Converting 1.5 cups of butter to grams eliminates guesswork, giving you consistent outcomes every time.</p>  

<p>If you're new to air frying, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for other common ingredient conversions. This handy resource helps you adapt your favourite recipes effortlessly. Whether you're cooking <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>cakes</a> or savoury dishes, accurate measurements are the foundation of great results.</p>  

<h3>Butter Conversions: UK vs. US Measurements</h3>  
<p>It's worth noting that cup measurements can vary slightly between the UK and the US. In the UK, 1 cup of butter is typically 227 grams, while in the US, it's around 226 grams. For 1.5 cups, this means roughly 340 grams in the UK and 339 grams in the US. The difference is minimal but worth considering for precision baking.</p>  

<h2>How to Measure 1.5 Cups of Butter in Grams</h2>  
<p>The easiest way to measure 1.5 cups of butter in grams is by using a kitchen scale. Simply place your butter on the scale and measure until you reach 340 grams. If you don't have a scale, you can use the markings on butter packaging—most blocks are divided into 50-gram increments, making it easy to portion out the correct amount.</p>  

<p>For those who love baking, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipes</a> section features a variety of air fryer-friendly treats that use precise measurements. From cookies to muffins, these recipes are tested to perfection, ensuring delicious results every time.</p>  

<h3>Common Recipes Using 1.5 Cups of Butter</h3>  
<p>Many classic recipes call for 1.5 cups of butter, including pound cakes, shortbread, and flaky pastries. When adapting these for the air fryer, accurate measurements are crucial. For example, a pound cake made with 1.5 cups of butter (340 grams) will have the perfect crumb and moisture when air-fried.</p>  

<h2>Tips for Measuring Butter Without a Scale</h2>  
<p>If you don't have a kitchen scale, you can still measure 1.5 cups of butter accurately. Most butter sticks have tablespoon markings, with 1 cup equating to 16 tablespoons (or 2 sticks). For 1.5 cups, you’d need 24 tablespoons (3 sticks) of butter. This method ensures you get close to the 340-gram mark without a scale.</p>

<h3>Converting Other Butter Measurements</h3>  
<p>If your recipe calls for a different amount of butter, here are some quick conversions: 1 cup = 227 grams, ½ cup = 113 grams, and ¼ cup = 57 grams. These conversions are handy for scaling recipes up or down, especially when experimenting with air fryer adaptations.</p>

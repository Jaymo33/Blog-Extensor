<p>100 grams of lentils equals approximately ½ cup, though this can vary slightly depending on the lentil type and how they're packed. Whether you're prepping a hearty air fryer stew or baking lentil-based snacks, getting the measurement right is key. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we know precision matters for perfect results every time.</p>  

<h2>Understanding Lentil Measurements</h2>  
<p>Lentils come in different varieties, from red and green to Puy and black, each with slight density differences. While 100 grams of red lentils may fill about ½ cup, green lentils could be slightly less due to their smaller size. For air fryer cooking, consistency is crucial—especially when making crispy lentil bites or protein-packed snacks. If you're unsure, a kitchen scale is your best friend, but cup measurements work well too.</p>  

<p>For those without scales, fluffing the lentils before measuring helps avoid overpacking the cup. Spoon them lightly into the measuring cup and level off the top for accuracy. Need more conversions? Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> covers everything from grams to cups for all your favourite ingredients.</p>  

<h3>Why Accurate Measurements Matter</h3>  
<p>Using the right amount of lentils ensures your air fryer recipes cook evenly and taste great. Too many lentils can lead to clumping or uneven crisping, while too few might leave dishes dry. Whether you're making lentil patties or adding them to a veggie mix, 100 grams (about ½ cup) is a handy standard portion.</p>  

<h2>Converting Grams to Cups for Different Lentils</h2>  
<p>Not all lentils weigh the same per cup. Red lentils, often split, take up more space, while smaller black lentils pack tighter. Here’s a quick guide: 100 grams of red lentils ≈ ½ cup, green lentils ≈ ⅜ cup, and black lentils ≈ ⅓ cup. For air fryer recipes like spiced lentil crisps, this small difference can affect texture.</p>  

<p>Pre-soaking lentils? Remember they’ll expand, so adjust measurements accordingly. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>lentil recipe collection</a> for inspiration, from curries to crunchy snacks. And if you’re batch-cooking, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/meal-prep>meal prep tips</a> will save you time.</p>  

<h3>Common Mistakes When Measuring Lentils</h3>  
<p>Packing lentils too tightly into a cup is a frequent error, leading to more than 100 grams. Always spoon them in loosely for accuracy. Another pitfall? Not accounting for pre-cooked vs. dry weights—100 grams of cooked lentils fills about ¾ cup, nearly double the volume of dry.</p>  

<h2>Using Lentils in Air Fryer Recipes</h2>  
<p>Lentils are a fantastic air fryer ingredient, adding protein and texture to dishes. For crispy lentil falafel or veggie burgers, start with 100 grams (½ cup) of soaked lentils. Mix with spices, shape, and air fry at 180°C for 10–12 minutes. Need cleaning tips after cooking? Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner guide</a> keeps your appliance spotless.</p>  

<p>For lighter bites, try lentil-based dough for flatbreads or crackers. The key is balancing moisture—100 grams of lentils pairs well with 2–3 tablespoons of water or oil. Experiment with flavours, from smoky paprika to zesty lemon, and share your creations with us!</p>

<h3>How to measure 0.75 cup of raisins correctly</h3>  
<p>For the most accurate measurement, lightly pack the raisins into a dry measuring cup without crushing them. Level off the top with a straight edge.

<h2>Tips for working with raisins in the air fryer</h2>  
<p>Raisins can burn quickly in the air fryer due to their sugar content. To prevent this, toss them with a bit of oil or mix them into batters or doughs. For even cooking, spread them out rather than clumping them together. This ensures they caramelise without charring.</p>  
<p>If your recipe calls for plump raisins, soak them in warm water for 10 minutes before use. Drain and pat dry to avoid excess moisture in your air fryer. This trick works wonders for <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/breakfast>breakfast bakes</a> or energy bars.</p>  

<h3>Storing leftover raisins</h3>  
<p>After measuring out 0.75 cup, store any unused raisins in an airtight container in a cool, dark place. They’ll stay fresh for months, ready for your next air fryer adventure. For longer storage, refrigerate or freeze them to maintain their chewy texture.</p>

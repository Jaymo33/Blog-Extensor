<p>0.75 cup of raisins equals approximately 3.5 ounces (100 grams). This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes, baking, or meal prep where precise measurements matter. Whether you're making a fruity dessert or a savoury dish, knowing the weight ensures consistent results.</p>

<h2>Why accurate raisin measurements matter</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of raisins can make or break your recipe. Too few, and your dish lacks sweetness; too many, and it becomes overpowering. For air fryer recipes, precise measurements ensure even cooking and perfect texture. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more handy tips.</p>  
<p>Raisins are a popular ingredient in both sweet and savoury dishes, from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>cakes</a> to roasted vegetables. Their natural sugars caramelise beautifully in the air fryer, adding depth to your meals. Measuring by weight (ounces) is often more reliable than volume (cups), especially for sticky ingredients like raisins.</p>  

<h3>How to measure 0.75 cup of raisins correctly</h3>  
<p>For the most accurate measurement, lightly pack the raisins into a dry measuring cup without crushing them. Level off the top with a straight edge. If you're using a kitchen scale, 0.75 cup should weigh around 3.5 ounces. This method works for all types of raisins, including golden or jumbo varieties.</p>  

<h2>Converting 0.75 cup of raisins to other units</h2>  
<p>Besides ounces, you might need to convert 0.75 cup of raisins to grams or other units. Here’s a quick reference: 0.75 cup ≈ 3.5 oz ≈ 100 grams. For UK bakers, this conversion stays the same, as ounces are consistent across measuring systems. Need more conversions? Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipes section</a> has detailed guides.</p>  
<p>If you're scaling a recipe up or down, remember that raisins expand slightly when soaked or cooked. For air fryer dishes like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>desserts</a>, this can affect texture, so measure carefully. A little precision goes a long way in achieving the perfect result.</p>  

<h3>Common uses for 0.75 cup of raisins</h3>  
<p>This quantity is ideal for small batches of oatmeal raisin cookies, fruit-studded granola, or a single-serving air fryer cake. It’s also perfect for adding sweetness to savoury dishes like Moroccan-inspired <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/lamb>lamb</a> or roasted vegetables. Keep your air fryer clean after sticky recipes with our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning guide</a>.</p>  

<h2>Tips for working with raisins in the air fryer</h2>  
<p>Raisins can burn quickly in the air fryer due to their sugar content. To prevent this, toss them with a bit of oil or mix them into batters or doughs. For even cooking, spread them out rather than clumping them together. This ensures they caramelise without charring.</p>  
<p>If your recipe calls for plump raisins, soak them in warm water for 10 minutes before use. Drain and pat dry to avoid excess moisture in your air fryer. This trick works wonders for <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/breakfast>breakfast bakes</a> or energy bars.</p>  

<h3>Storing leftover raisins</h3>  
<p>After measuring out 0.75 cup, store any unused raisins in an airtight container in a cool, dark place. They’ll stay fresh for months, ready for your next air fryer adventure. For longer storage, refrigerate or freeze them to maintain their chewy texture.</p>

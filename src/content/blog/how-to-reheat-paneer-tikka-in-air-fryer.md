<p>Reheating paneer tikka in an air fryer is simple—set it to 160°C for 3-5 minutes to restore its crispiness without drying it out. This method works brilliantly for leftovers or refrigerated paneer tikka, giving it that just-cooked texture. If you love Indian cuisine, you’ll appreciate how the air fryer revives the smoky flavours while keeping the paneer soft inside.</p>  

<h2>Why Use an Air Fryer to Reheat Paneer Tikka?</h2>  
<p>The air fryer circulates hot air evenly, ensuring your paneer tikka reheats uniformly without becoming soggy or overcooked. Unlike a microwave, which can make paneer rubbery, the air fryer maintains the dish’s signature charred edges. It’s also quicker than using an oven, making it ideal for busy weeknights. For more air fryer tips, check out <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes</a>.</p>  

<p>Paneer tikka reheated in an air fryer tastes almost as good as freshly made, especially if you lightly spritz it with oil before reheating. This trick enhances crispiness while preventing dryness. If you’re reheating multiple skewers, arrange them in a single layer for even heating.

<h3>Best Temperature to Reheat Paneer Tikka</h3>  
<p>160°C is the sweet spot for reheating paneer tikka—hot enough to crisp the exterior but gentle enough to avoid toughening the cheese. If your air fryer has a reheat preset, use it for foolproof results. For firmer paneer, increase to 170°C, but reduce the time to 3 minutes to prevent over-drying.</p>  

<h2>Step-by-Step Reheating Instructions</h2>  
<p>Start by preheating your air fryer to 160°C for 2 minutes—this ensures even heating from the first second. Place the paneer tikka in the basket, leaving space between pieces for airflow. If reheating refrigerated paneer, let it sit at room temperature for 10 minutes first. For extra crispiness, brush with a teaspoon of ghee or oil.</p>  

<p>Cook for 3-5 minutes, checking at the 3-minute mark to avoid overcooking. Shake the basket halfway for uniform crispness. Serve immediately with mint chutney or alongside <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air-fryer-friendly sides</a>. Leftovers? Store them properly using our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>cleaning guide</a> to maintain your appliance’s performance.</p>  

<h3>Tips to Prevent Dryness</h3>  
<p>If your paneer tikka was originally lean on marinade, drizzle a teaspoon of yogurt or cream before reheating. Covering the paneer loosely with foil for the first 2 minutes can also lock in moisture. For skewered paneer, remove wooden sticks if reheating longer than 3 minutes to avoid charring.</p>  

<h2>Common Mistakes to Avoid</h2>  
<p>Overcrowding the basket is the top mistake—it leads to uneven reheating and soggy paneer. Always reheat in batches if needed. Another pitfall is skipping preheating, which extends cooking time and risks dryness. Avoid using high heat (above 180°C), as paneer can turn rubbery quickly.</p>  

<p>Never reheat paneer tikka straight from the freezer in the air fryer—thaw it in the fridge overnight first.

The whole number is 20 pounds, and the decimal 0.94389 represents the ounces—multiply this by 16 (since there are 16 ounces in a pound) to get approximately 15.1 ounces. So, 9.5 kg is roughly 20 pounds and 15 ounces. This precise conversion is useful for detailed recipe planning and accurate batch division in air frying."

    "acceptedAnswer": {
    "@type": "Answer",
    "text": "No, you should not cook all 9.5 kg prawns (about 20.94 pounds) at once in your air fryer. Air fryers require space for hot air to circulate around the food for even cooking. Overcrowding leads to steaming instead of crisping, resulting in unevenly cooked prawns. Cook in single-layer batches based on your air fryer’s capacity, which usually means 200-400 grams per batch for most models. This ensures each prawn is perfectly cooked and crispy."

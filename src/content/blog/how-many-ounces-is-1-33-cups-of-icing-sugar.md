<h2>How many ounces is 1.33 cups of icing sugar?</h2>  
<p>1.33 cups of icing sugar equals approximately 5.3 ounces (or 5.29 oz to be precise). This conversion is essential for air fryer baking, where precise measurements can make or break your recipe. Whether you’re whipping up a cake or dusting desserts, knowing the exact weight ensures consistency. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we focus on accuracy to help you achieve perfect results every time. No more second-guessing—just reliable conversions for your kitchen needs.</p>  

<p>Converting cups to ounces can be tricky, especially with ingredients like icing sugar, which can vary in density. In the UK, where metric measurements are standard, this conversion is particularly useful for air fryer recipes. If you’re working with a recipe from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>our collection</a>, this measurement will come in handy. Remember, slight variations can occur based on how tightly packed the sugar is, so always measure carefully for the best outcome.</p>  

<h3>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer baking</h3>  
<p>Air fryers cook food quickly and evenly, but they rely on precise ingredient ratios for optimal results. Too much or too little icing sugar can affect texture and taste, especially in delicate recipes like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>air fryer cakes</a>. Using a kitchen scale for ounces ensures consistency, but if you only have cups, our conversion guide saves the day. For more tips, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a> to streamline your baking process.</p>  

<h2>How to measure 1.33 cups of icing sugar correctly</h2>  
<p>To measure 1.33 cups of icing sugar accurately, fluff the sugar first to avoid compacting it. Spoon it lightly into your measuring cup, then level it off with a straight edge. This method prevents overpacking, which could skew your conversion to ounces. If you’re scaling up a recipe from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, double-check your measurements to maintain the right balance of ingredients.</p>  

<p>For those without a measuring cup, a kitchen scale is your best friend. Simply set it to ounces and weigh out 5.3 oz of icing sugar. This eliminates guesswork and ensures your air fryer desserts turn out perfectly every time.

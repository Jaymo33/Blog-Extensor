<p>20g of chopped garlic equals approximately 0.7 ounces. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes, where precise measurements can make all the difference in flavour and texture. Whether you’re whipping up a garlic-infused dish or following a recipe from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, knowing how to convert grams to ounces ensures accuracy.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate garlic measurements matter</h2>  
<p>Garlic is a powerhouse ingredient that can elevate any dish, but too much or too little can throw off the balance. In an air fryer, where cooking times are shorter, precise measurements ensure even cooking and perfect flavour distribution. For example, if a recipe calls for 20g of chopped garlic (or 0.7 ounces), using the correct amount prevents overpowering or underwhelming results. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for more handy measurements.</p>  

<p>Many UK cooks rely on grams, but some recipes, especially older or international ones, use ounces. Converting 20g of chopped garlic to ounces (0.7 oz) bridges this gap, making it easier to follow any recipe. Whether you’re making garlic bread, roasted vegetables, or a marinade, this conversion ensures consistency. For more garlic-heavy dishes, browse our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable recipes</a>.</p>  

<h3>How to measure chopped garlic</h3>  
<p>Measuring chopped garlic can be tricky due to its sticky texture. For 20g (0.7 ounces), use a digital kitchen scale for the most accurate results. If you don’t have one, a tablespoon of finely chopped garlic is roughly 10g, so two tablespoons will get you close to 20g. Remember, air fryer recipes often benefit from precise measurements, so investing in a scale is worthwhile.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for 20g of chopped garlic</h2>  
<p>20g of chopped garlic (0.7 ounces) is a versatile amount used in many air fryer dishes. It’s perfect for seasoning meats, enhancing roasted vegetables, or creating a bold marinade. For example, our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>garlic butter shrimp recipe</a> uses this exact measurement for balanced flavour. Garlic’s potency means even small adjustments can impact the dish, so sticking to 20g ensures consistency.</p>  

<p>If you’re prepping multiple meals, 20g of chopped garlic can be portioned and stored for later use. Simply freeze it in ice cube trays or airtight containers. When you’re ready to cook, toss a portion into your air fryer for instant flavour. For more meal prep tips, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/meal-prep>meal prep category</a>.</p>  

<h3>Converting other garlic measurements</h3>  
<p>While 20g of chopped garlic equals 0.7 ounces, other forms of garlic have different conversions. For instance, minced garlic is denser, so 20g might fill less volume. Always check whether your recipe calls for chopped, minced, or crushed garlic to ensure accuracy. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion chart</a> includes these variations for easy reference.</p>

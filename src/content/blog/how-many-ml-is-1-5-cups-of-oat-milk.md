<p>1.5 cups of oat milk equals 355 millilitres (ml). This conversion is essential for precise cooking and baking, especially when using an air fryer where measurements can make or break a recipe. Whether you're whipping up a cake or preparing a creamy sauce, knowing the exact ml equivalent ensures consistency.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>When using an air fryer, precise measurements are crucial for even cooking and perfect texture. Too much or too little liquid can affect the outcome of your dish. For example, adding the correct amount of oat milk ensures your <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a> turn out moist and flavourful. This is particularly important for baked goods like muffins or pancakes.</p>  
<p>Oat milk is a popular dairy-free alternative, but its consistency can vary slightly between brands. Measuring 1.5 cups (355 ml) guarantees you’re using the right amount, whether you’re following a UK or US recipe. For more conversion tips, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>  

<h3>Converting Cups to Millilitres</h3>  
<p>The standard conversion for 1 cup of liquid is 237 ml, making 1.5 cups equal to 355 ml. This applies to oat milk, almond milk, and other plant-based alternatives. If you’re scaling a recipe up or down, this measurement ensures accuracy. For example, halving a recipe would mean using 177.5 ml of oat milk.</p>  

<h2>Using Oat Milk in Air Fryer Recipes</h2>  
<p>Oat milk works wonderfully in air fryer recipes, from batters to sauces. Its mild flavour and creamy texture make it ideal for dishes like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>air fryer cakes</a> or custards. Measuring 1.5 cups (355 ml) correctly ensures your recipes turn out just right. Too much liquid can lead to soggy results, while too little may dry out your dish.</p>  
<p>For savoury recipes, such as creamy pasta sauces or mashed potatoes, oat milk adds richness without dairy. Always measure carefully to maintain the perfect balance. If you’re unsure, refer to our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>conversion guide</a> for other common measurements.</p>  

<h3>Common Mistakes to Avoid</h3>  
<p>One common mistake is using a dry measuring cup for liquids, which can lead to inaccurate amounts. Always use a liquid measuring cup for oat milk. Another pitfall is not levelling off the measurement, which can add extra ml unintentionally. For best results, pour oat milk to the 355 ml mark on your measuring jug.</p>  

<h2>Oat Milk Substitutes in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>  
<p>If you run out of oat milk, you can substitute it with almond milk, soy milk, or even coconut milk in a 1:1 ratio. Just remember that each alternative may slightly alter the flavour and texture. For example, coconut milk will add a tropical twist to your <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>air fryer desserts</a>.</p>  
<p>When substituting, still aim for 355 ml (1.5 cups) to maintain recipe integrity. For more tips on dairy-free cooking, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> collection of plant-based recipes.</p>  

<h3>Cleaning Your Air Fryer After Use</h3>  
<p>After cooking with oat milk, it’s important to clean your air fryer properly to prevent residue buildup.

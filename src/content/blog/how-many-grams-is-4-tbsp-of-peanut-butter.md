<p>4 tablespoons (tbsp) of peanut butter weigh approximately 64 grams (g). This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements can make or break your dish. Whether you're making peanut butter cookies, satay sauce, or energy bites, knowing the exact weight ensures consistency. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we focus on delivering accurate conversions to help you nail every recipe.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate peanut butter measurements matter</h2>  
<p>Using the correct amount of peanut butter ensures your air fryer recipes turn out perfectly. Too much can make dishes overly dense, while too little might leave them dry. For example, if you're making <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>peanut butter cookies</a>, 64 grams of peanut butter per 4 tbsp guarantees the right texture. Precision is especially crucial in baking, where ratios affect rising and browning.</p>  

<p>Peanut butter’s density can vary slightly between brands, so weighing it removes guesswork. Natural peanut butter, which often separates, may measure differently than stabilised varieties. If you’re unsure, check our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for other common ingredient conversions. This way, you’ll never second-guess your measurements again.</p>  

<h3>How to measure peanut butter for air fryer recipes</h3>  
<p>The easiest way to measure peanut butter is by using a kitchen scale. Scoop your peanut butter into a bowl and zero out the scale for an exact 64-gram measurement. If you don’t have a scale, lightly pack the peanut butter into a tablespoon and level it off. Avoid compacting it too tightly, as this can skew the weight.</p>  

<h2>Common recipes using 4 tbsp peanut butter</h2>  
<p>Many air fryer recipes call for 4 tbsp (64g) of peanut butter. Popular options include peanut butter granola, protein bars, and even savoury dishes like satay chicken. For a quick <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert</a>, try air-fried peanut butter-stuffed dates. The creamy texture pairs perfectly with the air fryer’s crisp finish.</p>  

<p>If you’re meal prepping, peanut butter is a great ingredient for energy bites or overnight oats. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/breakfast>breakfast recipes</a> for more inspiration. Remember, accurate measurements ensure your dishes taste just as good as they look.</p>  

<h3>Adjusting recipes for different peanut butter types</h3>  
<p>Natural peanut butter tends to be runnier, while commercial brands are thicker. If using natural peanut butter, you might need to adjust other liquids in your recipe. For sticky doughs, chilling the mixture before air frying helps maintain shape. Always refer to trusted sources like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a> for tested conversions.</p>  

<h2>Storing peanut butter for air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>To keep peanut butter fresh, store it in a cool, dark place. Stir well before measuring to redistribute oils. If your peanut butter hardens, gently warm it for easier scooping. Proper storage ensures consistent results in every air fryer recipe.</p>

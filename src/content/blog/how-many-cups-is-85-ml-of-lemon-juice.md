<p>85 ml of lemon juice equals approximately 0.36 cups (US) or 0.34 cups (UK). Whether you're baking a lemon drizzle cake or marinating chicken for your air fryer, precise measurements ensure perfect results every time. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we know how crucial accuracy is in recipes, especially when working with tangy ingredients like lemon juice.</p>  

<h2>Why Accurate Lemon Juice Measurements Matter</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of lemon juice can make or break a dish. Too little, and your recipe lacks zing; too much, and it becomes overpoweringly sour. For air fryer recipes like lemon garlic shrimp or lemon herb chicken, 85 ml of lemon juice provides the ideal balance. If you're unsure about conversions, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for quick reference.</p>  

<p>Lemon juice also plays a key role in baking, from lightening sponge cakes to adding acidity in cookies. Whether you're following a UK or US recipe, knowing that 85 ml of lemon juice is roughly 0.34–0.36 cups helps avoid mishaps. For more baking inspiration, browse our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>lemon cake recipes</a>.</p>  

<h3>US vs. UK Cup Measurements</h3>  
<p>In the US, 1 cup equals 240 ml, while in the UK, it's 250 ml. This means 85 ml of lemon juice converts to 0.36 cups (US) or 0.34 cups (UK). If your air fryer recipe originates from another country, always double-check which measurement system it uses. A slight variance might not ruin a marinade, but it can affect delicate desserts.</p>  

<h2>How to Measure 85 ml of Lemon Juice Without a Scale</h2>  
<p>Don’t have a measuring jug? No problem! A standard tablespoon holds about 15 ml, so 85 ml of lemon juice is roughly 5.5 tablespoons. For smaller quantities, a teaspoon holds 5 ml, meaning you’d need 17 teaspoons. If precision is critical, invest in a kitchen scale or measuring spoons—especially for recipes like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer lemon drizzle cake</a>.</p>  

<p>Freshly squeezed lemon juice is always best, but bottled works in a pinch. Just ensure it's pure lemon juice without added sugars or preservatives.

<h3>Common Recipes Using 85 ml of Lemon Juice</h3>  
<p>This quantity is perfect for dressings, marinades, and desserts. Try it in air fryer lemon pepper salmon, tangy lemon glazed tofu, or a refreshing lemon sorbet. For more ideas, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert collection</a>.</p>

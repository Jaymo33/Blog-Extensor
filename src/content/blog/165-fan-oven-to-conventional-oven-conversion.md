<p>165 fan oven converts to approximately 145°C in a conventional oven. This conversion is essential for air fryer users who want to replicate fan oven recipes accurately. Fan ovens circulate hot air, cooking food faster and more evenly, while conventional ovens rely on radiant heat. Understanding this difference ensures your air fryer meals turn out perfectly every time.

<h2>Why Convert 165 Fan Oven to Conventional?</h2>
<p>Converting 165 fan oven to conventional oven temperatures is crucial for air fryer cooking. Air fryers work similarly to fan ovens, circulating hot air around the food. However, many recipes still use conventional oven temperatures as the standard. This conversion helps bridge the gap between different cooking methods. It ensures your air fryer dishes maintain the right texture and doneness. Whether you're baking cakes or roasting vegetables, accurate temperature conversion makes all the difference.</p>

<p>Most modern air fryers include both fan and conventional oven settings. Yet understanding the underlying conversion principles gives you more control. The general rule is to reduce conventional oven temperatures by 20°C when using a fan oven or air fryer. This means 165°C fan oven equals 145°C in a conventional oven.

This temperature works beautifully for items like cheesecakes, custards, or tender meats. The circulating air in an air fryer mimics a fan oven's efficiency, often reducing cooking times. However, monitoring your food is still important to prevent over-browning.</p>

<h2>Conversion Tips for Perfect Results</h2>
<p>When converting 165 fan oven to conventional oven temperatures, consider your air fryer's size. Smaller basket models may require slight temperature adjustments.

<p>Different air fryer brands might have slight variations in heat distribution. If you notice uneven cooking at 165 fan oven equivalent, try rotating the basket halfway through. For foods that brown too quickly, you can reduce the temperature by 5-10°C. Keep a cooking journal to note what works best with your specific model. With practice, converting 165 fan oven to conventional oven settings will become second nature.</p>

<h2>Common Conversion Mistakes to Avoid</h2>
<p>One frequent error is assuming fan and conventional oven temperatures are identical. This can lead to undercooked or overcooked dishes in your air fryer. Another mistake is forgetting to adjust cooking times when converting 165 fan oven to conventional oven settings. Air fryers typically cook faster than conventional ovens, so start checking for doneness early. Also, avoid overcrowding the basket, as this affects heat circulation. Proper spacing ensures the 165 fan oven equivalent cooks food evenly throughout.</p>

<h3>When to Use Higher or Lower Temperatures</h3>
<p>While 165 fan oven (145°C conventional) works for many dishes, some require adjustments. For crispy foods like roast potatoes, you might increase to 180°C conventional. Delicate items like soufflés may need a lower temperature to prevent collapsing. Consider the food's density and moisture content when making conversions.

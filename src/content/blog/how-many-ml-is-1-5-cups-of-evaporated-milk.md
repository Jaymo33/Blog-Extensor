<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>

<p>Evaporated milk is a staple in many recipes, from custards to casseroles. Its concentrated nature means small measurement errors can have a big impact. By converting cups to millilitres, you eliminate guesswork and achieve consistent results. This is especially useful for air fryer baking, where precision is key.</p>

<h2>How to Measure 1.5 Cups of Evaporated Milk Correctly</h2>
<p>To measure 355 ml of evaporated milk, use a liquid measuring jug with clear millilitre markings. Pour the milk slowly to avoid spills and check at eye level for accuracy. If you don’t have a measuring jug, a kitchen scale can also work—1.5 cups weighs roughly 340 grams.</p>

<h3>Using Metric vs. Imperial Measurements</h3>
<p>In the UK, millilitres are the standard for liquid measurements, while cups are more common in the US. Converting 1.5 cups of evaporated milk to ml (355 ml) bridges this gap, making recipes accessible no matter where you are. This is particularly helpful when following international air fryer recipes.</p>

<p>2.5 cups of self-raising flour equals approximately 300 grams. This conversion is essential for air fryer baking, where precision ensures light, fluffy results. Whether you’re making cakes, muffins, or scones, knowing the exact gram measurement helps avoid dense or dry outcomes. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we emphasise accurate measurements for foolproof recipes. Keep reading to master this conversion and elevate your air fryer baking.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Flour Measurements Matter</h2>
<p>Baking is a science, and even small deviations in flour quantity can affect texture and rise. Self-raising flour contains baking powder, so precise measurements ensure consistent leavening. In an air fryer, where heat distribution differs from conventional ovens, accuracy is even more critical. Too much flour can lead to dry, crumbly results, while too little may cause collapsing. For perfect air fryer cakes or bread, stick to the 300-gram benchmark for 2.5 cups of self-raising flour.</p>

<p>Many bakers rely on volume measurements, but weight (grams) is far more reliable. Cups can vary based on how the flour is scooped or packed, leading to inconsistencies. A kitchen scale eliminates guesswork, especially for air fryer recipes where space and heat are limited. Explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> for other common ingredient conversions. Trusting grams over cups guarantees bakery-quality results every time.</p>

<h2>How to Measure 2.5 Cups of Self-Raising Flour Correctly</h2>
<p>For the most accurate 300-gram equivalent, spoon the flour into your measuring cup and level it off with a knife. Avoid scooping directly from the bag, as this compacts the flour and skews the measurement. If using a scale, tare it with your bowl before adding flour until it hits 300 grams. This method is foolproof for air fryer recipes, where even small imbalances can affect cooking.</p>

<h3>UK vs. US Cup Measurements</h3>
<p>Note that UK and US cup sizes differ slightly. A UK cup holds 284 ml, while a US cup is 240 ml. However, for self-raising flour, the weight per cup is similar (120 grams per cup). Thus, 2.5 cups in either system will still be close to 300 grams. For absolute precision, always weigh your flour, especially when adapting recipes from <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>our global collection</a>.</p>

<h2>Common Recipes Using 2.5 Cups of Self-Raising Flour</h2>
<p>This quantity is perfect for air fryer cakes, such as vanilla sponge or lemon drizzle. It’s also ideal for scones, muffins, or even quick bread like banana loaf. The air fryer’s rapid circulation ensures even baking, but only if measurements are spot-on. Visit our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/cakes>cake category</a> for inspiration. Remember, 300 grams of self-raising flour is your starting point for these delights.</p>

<h3>Adjusting for Humidity and Altitude</h3>
<p>In humid climates, flour absorbs moisture and may weigh slightly more. If your dough feels sticky, add a tablespoon less flour (about 10 grams less). At high altitudes, reduce baking powder slightly to prevent over-rising. These tweaks ensure your air fryer treats turn out perfectly, whether you’re at sea level or in the mountains.</p>

<h2>Tools for Perfect Flour Measurements</h2>
<p>Invest in a digital kitchen scale for reliable grams-to-cups conversions. Scales are inexpensive and indispensable for air fryer baking. Alternatively, use a graduated measuring jug for liquids and a dedicated dry-ingredient cup set. For more tips, check our guide on <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>maintaining your air fryer</a> to keep it in top shape for baking. Precision tools paired with 300 grams of self-raising flour guarantee success.</p>

<h2>Why Accurate Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Cooking</h2>
<p>Using the right amount of coconut oil can make or break your air fryer recipes. Too little, and your food may stick or dry out; too much, and it could become greasy.

<h2>How to Measure Coconut Oil for Air Fryer Recipes</h2>
<p>Measuring coconut oil can be tricky since it changes form depending on temperature. Solid coconut oil can be scooped, while melted oil should be poured into a liquid measuring cup. For 1.0 cups of coconut oil (237 ml), use a clear measuring jug for accuracy.</p>

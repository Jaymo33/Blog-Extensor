<p>40g of garlic paste equals approximately 1.41 ounces. This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precise measurements can make or break your dish. Whether you’re whipping up a marinade or adding flavour to your favourite <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes</a>, knowing the exact weight ensures consistency. Garlic paste is a staple in many kitchens, and getting the measurement right helps avoid overpowering or underwhelming flavours. Let’s dive deeper into how this conversion works and why it matters for your air fryer cooking.</p>

<h2>Why accurate measurements matter in air fryer cooking</h2>  
<p>Air fryers rely on even cooking, and incorrect ingredient quantities can throw off the balance. Too much garlic paste might burn or create an overly strong taste, while too little could leave your dish bland. For dishes like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>garlic chicken</a>, the right amount of paste ensures the perfect flavour infusion. Precision is key, especially when working with concentrated ingredients like garlic paste. A small error in measurement can significantly alter the outcome of your meal.</p>  

<p>Using a kitchen scale is the most accurate way to measure 40g of garlic paste. If you don’t have one, knowing that 40g equals roughly 1.41 ounces helps you approximate with measuring spoons. This is particularly useful for <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>converting other ingredients</a> in your recipe. Consistency in measurements leads to repeatable, delicious results every time you use your air fryer. It’s a small step that makes a big difference in your cooking.</p>  

<h3>How to measure 40g of garlic paste without a scale</h3>  
<p>If you don’t have a scale, you can use volume measurements to approximate 40g of garlic paste. One tablespoon of garlic paste weighs around 15g, so 40g would be roughly 2.5 tablespoons. However, this method isn’t as precise as weighing, so adjust to taste if needed. For recipes where exactness matters, like <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>roasted vegetables</a>, investing in a cheap digital scale is worthwhile. It eliminates guesswork and ensures your dishes turn out perfectly every time.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for garlic paste in air fryer recipes</h2>  
<p>Garlic paste is a versatile ingredient that adds depth to many air fryer dishes. From marinades for meats to seasoning for roasted veggies, it’s a flavour powerhouse. For example, a 40g portion of garlic paste can be mixed with olive oil and herbs for a quick <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer marinade</a>. It’s also great for adding a punch to dips or sauces served with air-fried snacks. Knowing the ounce equivalent helps when adapting recipes from different sources or scaling quantities up or down.</p>  

<p>Another popular use is in garlic bread or naan made in the air fryer. A 40g portion (1.41 ounces) of garlic paste mixed with butter creates a rich, even coating. This ensures every bite is packed with flavour without being overwhelming. For those who love meal prep, pre-measuring 40g portions of garlic paste saves time during busy weeknights. Store it in an airtight container or ice cube trays for easy access. Proper measurement guarantees your dishes are consistently delicious.</p>  

<h3>Tips for storing garlic paste in your kitchen</h3>  
<p>Garlic paste can lose its potency if not stored correctly. After measuring out your 40g (1.41 ounces), keep the remainder in an airtight container in the fridge. For longer storage, freeze it in 40g portions so you always have the right amount on hand. This is especially handy for frequent <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer users</a> who want to minimise prep time. Proper storage ensures your garlic paste stays fresh and flavourful for future recipes.</p>

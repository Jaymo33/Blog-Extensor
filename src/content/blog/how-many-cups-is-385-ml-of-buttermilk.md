<p>385 ml of buttermilk is approximately 1.63 cups in the US measurement system and roughly 1.35 cups in the UK measurement system. This conversion is essential for anyone using recipes that switch between metric and imperial measurements, especially when baking with an air fryer. At <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk>airfryerrecipe.co.uk</a>, we understand how precise measurements can make or break your air fryer creations.</p>

<h2>Understanding Buttermilk Measurements</h2>
<p>Buttermilk is a staple in many baking recipes, from fluffy pancakes to tender cakes. When a recipe calls for 385 ml of buttermilk, it's crucial to know how that translates to cups. The difference between US and UK cup measurements can affect your recipe's outcome. For air fryer recipes, where precision matters, getting this conversion right ensures your baked goods turn out perfectly every time.</p>

<p>In the US, 1 cup equals 240 ml, while in the UK, 1 cup is 284 ml. This means 385 ml of buttermilk converts to about 1.63 US cups or 1.35 UK cups. If you're using an air fryer for baking, check whether your recipe uses US or UK measurements. Our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a> can help you navigate these differences effortlessly.</p>

<h3>Why Buttermilk Measurements Matter in Air Fryer Baking</h3>
<p>Buttermilk adds moisture and acidity to baked goods, helping them rise and develop a tender crumb. Using the correct amount ensures your air fryer cakes, muffins, or breads have the right texture. Too much buttermilk can make your batter too wet, while too little can result in a dry, dense product. That's why converting 385 ml of buttermilk to cups accurately is so important.</p>

<h2>Converting 385 ml of Buttermilk to Cups</h2>
<p>To convert 385 ml of buttermilk to US cups, divide 385 by 240 (the ml per US cup). This gives you approximately 1.63 cups. For UK cups, divide 385 by 284, resulting in about 1.35 cups. These conversions are particularly useful when adapting recipes for your air fryer, where space and cooking times differ from conventional ovens.</p>

<p>If you don't have measuring cups, you can use a liquid measuring jug marked in millilitres. Simply pour your buttermilk to the 385 ml line. For more air fryer baking tips, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>recipes section</a>, which includes delicious buttermilk-based treats perfect for your air fryer.</p>

<h3>Measuring Buttermilk Without a Scale</h3>
<p>If you don't have measuring tools, remember that 385 ml of buttermilk is slightly more than 1½ US cups (360 ml) but less than 2 cups (480 ml). For UK measurements, it's just over 1¼ cups (355 ml). When using your air fryer, precise measurements help ensure even cooking and perfect results every time.</p>

<h2>Buttermilk Substitutes and Conversions</h2>
<p>If you're out of buttermilk, you can make a substitute by adding 1 tablespoon of lemon juice or vinegar to 385 ml of regular milk (about 1.63 US cups). Let it sit for 5-10 minutes until slightly thickened. This substitute works well in air fryer recipes, though the taste may be slightly different from true buttermilk.</p>

<p>For those watching their dairy intake, you can use 385 ml (1.63 US cups) of plant-based milk with 1 tablespoon of acid as a buttermilk alternative. Check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/dessert>dessert recipes</a> for inspiration on using buttermilk substitutes in your air fryer creations.</p>

<h3>Cleaning Your Air Fryer After Using Buttermilk</h3>
<p>Buttermilk can leave residue in your air fryer basket. After cooking, wipe down your air fryer with a damp cloth and use our recommended <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>air fryer cleaner</a> to maintain your appliance. Regular cleaning ensures your air fryer continues to perform at its best for all your cooking needs.</p>

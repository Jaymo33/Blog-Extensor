<p>5 tablespoons (tbsp) of mayonnaise weigh approximately 70 grams (g). This conversion is essential for air fryer recipes where precision matters, ensuring your dishes cook evenly and taste perfect. Whether you're whipping up a quick sauce or coating chicken for a crispy finish, knowing the exact weight saves time and guarantees consistency. For more air fryer measurement tips, check out our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-conversion-chart>air fryer conversion chart</a>.</p>  

<h2>Why accurate mayonnaise measurements matter</h2>  
<p>Using the right amount of mayonnaise can make or break your air fryer dish. Too little, and your food might dry out; too much, and it could become greasy. Converting 5 tbsp of mayonnaise to grams (70g) ensures you hit the sweet spot for texture and flavour. This is especially useful for recipes like air-fried chicken tenders or crispy potatoes, where even distribution is key. For more recipe ideas, explore our <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipes>air fryer recipes collection</a>.</p>  

<p>Mayonnaise density can vary slightly between brands, but 70g is a reliable average for most UK supermarket varieties. If you're using a particularly thick or thin mayo, a digital kitchen scale will give you the most accurate measurement. This small step can elevate your air fryer cooking from good to great, ensuring professional results every time.</p>  

<h3>How to measure mayonnaise without scales</h3>  
<p>If you don't have kitchen scales, you can still measure 5 tbsp of mayonnaise accurately. Use standard UK tablespoons (15ml each) and level off the top with a knife for precision. Remember that 1 tbsp equals about 14g, so 5 tbsp will be roughly 70g. This method works well for most <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/chicken>chicken recipes</a> where mayonnaise acts as a binder or coating.</p>  

<h2>Common uses for 5 tbsp of mayonnaise in air fryers</h2>  
<p>Five tablespoons of mayonnaise (70g) is the perfect amount for many air fryer dishes. It's enough to coat 4-6 chicken thighs for a crispy exterior, or to mix with breadcrumbs for a flavourful topping. You could also use it to bind ingredients in <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/potatoes>potato recipes</a>, creating a deliciously moist texture without excess oil.</p>  

<p>Another great use is creating marinades or dips. Combine your 70g of mayonnaise with herbs, garlic, or spices for an instant flavour boost. The air fryer's circulating heat will help these flavours penetrate your ingredients beautifully. Just remember to clean your air fryer basket afterwards - our guide to the <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/air-fryer-cleaner>best air fryer cleaners</a> makes this quick and easy.</p>  

<h3>Adjusting recipes for different mayonnaise types</h3>  
<p>Light or reduced-fat mayonnaise may weigh slightly less than the standard 70g for 5 tbsp. If you're substituting, start with a little less and adjust to taste. For recipes where texture is crucial (like coatings), stick to full-fat mayo for best results. When trying new <a href=https://www.airfryerrecipe.co.uk/recipe-category/vegetables>vegetable recipes</a> in your air fryer, the 5 tbsp (70g) measurement works perfectly for creating creamy dressings or crispy toppings.</p>
